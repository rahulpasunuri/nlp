I love the premise for this recipe. I modified it a lot - I used ground turkey cooked off in a 1/4 cup of chicken stock and a 1/4 cup of white wine. I also used canelenni beans instead of black and added spinach and diced sweet potatoes, as well as some frsh sage. Making it in the slow cooker really blended all of the flavors so well. I served it with avocado, per the recommendation, and I also added cayenne cornbread croutons on top. So delicious!!!! I will make this again and again!

Great recipe, easy and flavourful. I added tomato paste, celery, garlic and corn and served it with yogurt lightly spiced with cinnamon, and the avocado and lime wedges suggested. Delicious and healthy.

It was a good way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey however it was a little on the bland side. I think if I were to make it again I'd probably add some cumin for a little extra flavour.

This is very delicious! I found a another recipe online for cooking ground turkey in 1/4 cup white wine, with 1/4 cup diced onions and 1 clove of garlic. I then added that ground turkey to this recipe with a little extra chili powder to take it up a notch! Awesome with some good corn bread.

Easy. Sweet and slightly spicy. Overall, this is great easy recipe. It's a nice change from the usual chili. You make your own adjustments. ie. Ground turkey, corn, white beans and rice. Try it!

Oh my, this is lovely. So nice and peppery. I followed it to the letter and tried it before modifying anything. It was delicious but I like my dishes a bit more spicy/garlic-y, so I added a thai chili, some cumin, and a few cloves of garlic. Exactly what the doctor ordered. It's perfect now. Just heavenly.

Quick and easy chili. I didn't have cooked turkey prepared, so I used ground turkey which I cooked in with the oil, onions and peppers. I prefer my chili to be a bit thicker, so didn't end up using the 1/2 cup water. I actually let the chili simmer closer to 25 minutes to burn off some more of the liquid. I also added in red pepper flakes to give it extra heat and topped it off with some blue corn tortilla chips and mexican cheese. Delish!

What an awesome chili! It has the right spice and a lot of flavor. I didn't have much time to make dinner but also wanted to get ride of some of my canned items and my ground turkey. I changed the recipe a little bite because I didn't have all the ingredients. Added 1 can of Kidney beans, Black beans, diced tomato, diced tomato with green chillies, diced green chillies, tomato paste,1 cup chicken broth, chipotle pepper flakes, ground red pepper. Also, topped it off with avocado and plain yogurt instead of sour cream. My husband asks for this all the time.

My husband and I really liked this chili. Very tasty and light. I added a can of baked beans which added a bit of savoriness to it.

I used fresh ground turkey, Ancho chile powder and yellow and orange bell pepper and it came out very well. Had to thicken it a bit with some tomoato paste, whch gave it a deeper flavor I think. My 4 year old is gobbling it up, so it's got my vote!

This is my favorite chili recipe ever since it is quick, easy, and healthy. I used ground turkey and it has always been awesome.

Love this chili - perfect for using up that holiday bird! I made a few changes: One red pepper & 2 pablanos Added some fresh cilantro that I needed to use up Used left over chicken broth instead of water. And tossed in some left over succotash just before the turkey. Perfect with tortilla chips & football!

I made this recipe as I had turkey leftovers from Thanksgiving and I had all the ingredients in the house. It was extremely simple and quick to make. However the chili was just average - nothing special.

I kept to this recipe closely with only a few minor substitutions. 1) I didn't have any pre-cooked Turkey, so I used a pound of ground turkey and sauteed it with the onion and bell pepper. It looks and tastes delicious with the ground turkey. Next time I have left over turkey from Thanksgiving I'll try it the way the recipe says. :-) 2) I did not have any Chipotle Chili Powder and did not feel like running to the store to pick up yet another spice- so I used 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and a 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika, instead. It seemed to have worked just fine, the cayenne gave it the extra heat and the smoked paprika gave it the smokey sweetness. oh and, out of habit, I threw in a bay leaf. I will surely make Turkey Chili again using this recipe as my guideline.

Turned out awesome...gave it 3 forks because I made some adjustments to make it awesome. I used ground turkey, canned chipotles in adobo (3 chopped) instead of chipotle powder, added garlic and cumin, added half a Serrano pepper (seeds out), and chicken stock instead of water. Yummy!! Chipotles in adobo give it a nice smoky flavor. Good heat. Excited for leftovers.

I use ground turkey for this recipe and love it. This is becoming a staple around our house. We use red peppers and combined with the brown sugar and the lack of garlic or cumin this is rather sweet and totally delicious.

This is a great and simple recipe! To ramp up the flavor I added quite a bit of cumin and some cinnamon. I also added an additional can of beans and omitted the water.

This is a wonderful, quick recipe to whip up after a day at work. It's healthy and very filling. I am just starting to cook... and it's easy to prepare, also a huge plus!

I thought this was "just ok." Added extra beans and a real chipotle in sauce, used beer instead of water...but it had a strangely watery flavor to the "broth." So, I'd say it's fine, but will probably try another recipe next time.

I came across this recipe when I was looking for something to use up some leftover roast turkey from the holidays. This chili was just the thing! Very simple to prepare and everyone loved it. I did modify it a little. To add some extra heat, I tossed in a little diced habenero. It gave it the perfect amount of spiciness. I will definitely make this again.

An easy and tasty chili recipe. I used ground turkey and a few chopped chipotles in adobo sauce as substitutes. As written, a little too chunky for my kids' taste; so I gave it a round in the food processor before adding the (pre- browned)turkey. Next time I will probably just chop the peppers much smaller to avoid this step.

GREAT dish to prepae with leftover turkey! By accident we bought "ground tomatoes, chunky style" instead of whole tomatoes in juice. This worked fine, except that the dish was perhaps a little too thick and tomato-dominated. I agree with adding cumin, and maybe next time I"ll cut back on the brown sugar a bit. Towards the end I added 1/2C chicken broth for a meatier flavor. I think next time I'll substitute 1C chicken broth for the 1/2C water for a richer flavor. MIght also use "diced tomatoes in juice" rather than the whole tomatoes called for.

I had no peppers, but I used celery instead.

I've made this recipe twice, both times following the recipe exactly (except for adding an extra can of white beans) and received big thumbs up! I used leftover TG turkey the first time; 2.5 lbs oven roasted boneless turkey breast the 2nd - both worked beaitifully. This is great chili for folks who like lots of flavor without a lot of spice.

Very good way to use up post-Thanksgiving turkey left overs. Added a can of corn and a can of kidney beans (in addition to the black beans). Delicious and made for a nice change of pace. Will definitely make this again!

Made this for a party and it was a huge hit. I used 30 oz of black beans, substituted 1 lb ground turkey for cooked turkey, and used 2 tbls canned chipotle sauce in place of powder.

This is a good dish garnished with chopped onion and cilantro, maybe a little grated cheddar and served with a simple salad. I got some taco shells, too, to make lunch with the leftovers.

Good recipe, I added 1/2 a bottle of lager, 2 cloves minced garlic, and a can of hot/habanero-sytle Rotel tomatoes *also left out the sugar* Mmmmmmmmm.

This was a satisfying delicious dinner! I used ground turkey instead which turned out great. I also added cumin, used less brown sugar and added a touch of cinnamon. I also added carrots to bring out the sweetness. Garlic is a good addition too. I used some mexican style stewed tomatoes to add some flavor and some taco seasoning. And almost doubled the beans as well. Can't wait to make it again and eat leftovers!

Great recipe! Made it twice before, the first time with ground turkey and the second time with leftover turkey breast. Much better with the turkey breast. Followed recipe as is. Would make again and again, a big hit all the way around with everyone, including some really picky eaters.

For what it is--a nice and quick weekday chili recipe that uses some leftover turkey--this worked quite nicely. Used many of the same changes as others: extra spices, beans, diced tomatoes (nearly always instead of whole...why not?) etc. Re: the sugar, I generally concur w/ earlier comment though in this case I think I used a reduced amt rather than eliminating it altogether. But I have to question then adding a can(!?!) of tomato paste, which will certainly up the sweetness level too. Whether added or "natural", sugar is sugar.

Made a quick and easy meal from leftover turkey. Gone in one day. I added a bit more chili powder, 2 tsp cumin, 2 minced garlic cloves, and omitted the water.

I liked the flavors in this dish. I also added more beans - I used two 15 oz cans and would probably eliminate the water and some of the juice from the tomatoes as I felt it was a bit too soupy for my taste. But great flavors.

No dish requires sugar in it - we are making our children diabetic & obese as well as hyper with this kind of logic. So I eliminated that. I used a package of taco seasoning instead of the chili and chipotle powder and added red kidney beans because I like the color better, as well as a small can of tomato paste. Tasty idea for leftover turkey.

I thought this recipe was above average, and I made a few modifications that I thought helped. I added a can of chopped Anaheim chilies and almost doubled the beans. Also, I did not like the whole tomatoes because I couldn't break them up into bite sized pieces easily. This was a good comfort food dish that aged well over about 2 weeks.
