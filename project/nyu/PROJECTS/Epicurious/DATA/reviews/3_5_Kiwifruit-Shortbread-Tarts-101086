Very quick and easy to make. For most effective approach: Mix the Shortbread with a fork and your hands. I replaced the Sour Cream with Plain Greek Yoghurt, added a splash of vanilla and sprinkle of cinnamon, and used fresh orange juice rather than lime juice (as that is what I had in the house). Additionally I added strawberry slices. Mmm, mmm, mmm!

I really liked this recipe! It's a great combination of flavors. The shortbread crust is delicious--it's like a cookie, but is tender in the middle. I had a little difficulty with the shortbread--it didn't bind easily (it's dry here). I just kept gathering in the edges until it all stuck together.

I made this for a quick dessert after a light pasta dish with lots of garlic. This dessert hit the spot and went well with the wine choice - a good sauvignon blanc.
