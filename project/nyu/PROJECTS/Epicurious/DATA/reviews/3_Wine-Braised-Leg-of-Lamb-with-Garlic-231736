This is by far of of the easiest and best dishes I have ever made. However I really don't bother with the heads of garlic after a few tries as I have found the best way to cook this is in a braising pan that the lamb just barely fits in. That way the wine keeps the lamb moister than if you used a larger pan with the garlic heads. Rosemary and the barest touch of mint and a little celery salt make this truly a great one.

This was a great recipe. I love lamb and I think this will be my preferred way of preparing lamb in the future. The garlic was just right and I didn't need to add any more liquid. It was perfect without any changes to the recipe.

Outstanding flavors. Especially good for those guests that do not like lamb or meat that is served rare to medium rare. We served this with the white bean and spinach recipe in the same issue. My guests can't wait to return for the same meal again.

This recipe was a disaster. I made it for a dinner party and was embarrassed to serve it. There is something wrong with the recipe. The lamb was totally dry and tasteless, though the wine sauce around it was delicious when reduced. I make braised lamb shanks all the time and they are simple and delicious. I don't believe that you can give the same treatment to a leg because legs are too lean. Also, when I braise shanks, the oven temperature is 275F, not 350. I'll stick to my normal way of cooking a boneless leg of lamb roast, which is to unroll it, stuff it with chopped garlic and rosemary, lemon slices, salt and pepper, roll it back up again, and then roast it at high heat until rare in the middle. That is easy and delicious.

This was quite easy to make, but I think there may be a typo in either the time or the temperature. We cooked for 1 hour 45 minutes and it was cooked through. I actually like it wuite a bit rare-er than it was. Next time I think we will reduce the temperature dramatically and try it for a longer cooking time. Overall though a really easy no fuss preperation with wonderful results.

This is the best lamb ever! It was so very succulent...very juicy and oh so tender. I have found my favourite recipe for leg of lamb!

At my suggestion, my British neighbor made this for our Easter dinner. This American and the rest of the Brits and Scots loved it! Wonderful balance of fresh, bright wine taste and rich, mellow garlic flavor. Because my friend knows that oven temps vary widely (and wildly), he paid careful attention to the meat, not the time. (The leg was well-trimmed.) It was succulent - fully-cooked but not overdone. Served with oven-roasted potatoes and steamed curly kale. Would definitely eat it/make it again - I much prefer it to lamb cooked with red wine.

This recipe may appeal to those who like their lamb "well-done," but it is a waste of tender, and yes, expensive, leg meat, to those among us who like it rare. The last time I got a leg of lamb from the butcher it set me back $64, and for that, I want intensely flavored, rare meat that melts in the mouth, not some over-cooked, cafeteria-style braised mystery meat. The recipe works well with lamb shanks, though, which are meant to be cooked into submission.

I made this recipe for a friend's family this past Easter. We used a 10 pound leg of spring lamb and increased the garlic and wine. A key to this recipe is to really trim all of the fat from the leg. We then covered the meat with a very light coating of olive oil, lots of minced garlic and srinkled with oregano, placed the lamb in a covered pan and put it in the refrigerator for the night. The next day we removed from the fridge, seasoned with salt and pepper and placed uncovered in the hot oven for 30 minutes. We then lowered the temperature and covered the lamb in the oven. We were surprised to find that it was done an hour earlier than we planned according to the recipe. This was even more surprising based on the larger leg of lamb that we used. None the less, the lamb played to rave reviews and my friends family is still talking about this dinner today. We also made the bean recipe to go along with the lamb. This is a very easy meal and one that we will make again.

I was checking for this recipe which i made for company in March, so that I could make it tomorrow for Easter, when I saw the 53% rating. I was shocked! This recipe was easy, and delicious, we had NO leftovers, maybe the quality of the wine has an impact, be sure to cook with a wine you enjoy drinking.

Since when did "leg of lamb" become an "expensive" cut of lamb? Rack of lamb is expensive - but not the leg. This class of meat is PERFECT for braising. It's the best way to get everything all melted and tender, as another reviewer suggested. I think some people base these flawed arguments on their own experiences, and totally ignore the science and tradition of classic cuisine.

Overall this recipe was good. However, I had a 6 pound semi boneless leg and followed the cooking time exactly which produced a very overdone roast. The saving grace was the wonderful flavors of the ingredients and the flavorful sauce to rehydrate the meat. I added fresh rosemary and the juice of 1/2 lemon to the initial roasting. Didn't need the reserved garlic for the sauce, quite flavorful with out it. I made it a day ahead which allowed for the removal of the fat, yielding a less greasy sauce. Next time will cut back on the cooking time and believe it will earn 4 forks.

i just wanted to say that these reviews kill me......... i cannot believe how some people would put such time and energy into writing the drivel they do....... anyways, keep it coming as it is good comedic relief. by the way, i did not try this recipe but why anyone would braise a leg of lamb is beyond me.

This recipe effectively takes an expensive cut of lamb and a nice bottle of wine and turn them into a terrible version of lamb pot roast. I have learned my lesson. Shanks are for braising--legs for roasting. The gravy was bad too by the way. Just skip this recipe. No rehab possible in my opinion. The bean side dish was delicious. A keeper.

This dish was fantastic and easy to make. After adding the wine, you just turn down the temp to 350°F and put on the cover and basically forget about it for 2 3/4 hours. I made the beans dish along with the leg of lamb and it was delicious as well. I, however, did have serious doubts when I tasted the beans dish and the sauce/jus on the stove. I thought both tasted very bland, and I warned everyone that I wasn't making any promises. Well, at the table everything came together and was just delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I read the first posted reviews after I had already started preparing this. Wish I had seen them earlier. I thought this was a totally bland dish and only substituted lamb shanks for the leg to test the recipe. Otherwise, no changes. Glad I did substitute for my test, given the price difference between the two cuts. Besides, as it says in the recipe, shanks are for braising. I even mashed up all the roasted garlic from the pan into the au jus, but still found it totally lacking. Wish I'd gone with a couple of other recipes in the database for braised lamb shanks that had much higher ratings. The beans shown accompanying this dish in the magazine were much better.

prefer red wine with it.

I made the shanks, which are more work, since they require braising. They were delicious, but next time I'll try the leg of lamb instead.

I made this dish a couple of weeks ago and it was absolutely delicious. I can't imagine what the other reviewer did that it didn't turn out for them. I used exactly what the recipe called for, and didn't find that the wine or thyme overwhelmed the taste of the lamb at all. It was tender and very flavorful. I served it for a birthday dinner and all of my guests were impressed and everyone found it to be quite wonderful.

. I have not made it yet but, being a lover of lamb -- because I like the taste of it and it's healthier than beef or pork -- I will try this recipe the next time lamb is on sale, using only half the thyme and half the wine, I'm afraid too much will hide too much of the lamb flavor, though this combination does appeal to me -- thank for that.

I have been cooking all cuts of lamb this way for years. Sometimes I use rosemary instead of or with thyme. My son who is a chef in London UK does as well. It is delicious without fail. If you peel the garlic and throw a few cans of beans, bay leaves, sliced onions and a grated carrot around the meat, you have a simple version of cassoulet. Seriously, you threw out all that food???

I'm confused as to how you do lamb shanks, if you don't braise them. Are you telling us this dish was deemed inedible? You threw it out? I'm going to have to try it just to be able to see how good/bad it is.

This was really awful. A waste of a leg of lamb and a bottle of wine. I've done braised lamb shanks lots of times and loved them but this recipe had no flavour what so ever. I was really disappointed. We threw it out and vowed to stick to shanks or roast lamb in future.

This dish was easy to make with simple ingredients and very tasty. If available use New Zealand lamb as it is much more tender.
