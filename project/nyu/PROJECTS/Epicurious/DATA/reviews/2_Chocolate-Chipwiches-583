Yum. Although it was a very good dish, it fell short of my expectations. It was easy to make but why even have the 'novelty' of making them when they sell them down the street for half the price? Although they are good when you just follow the recipe, I'll be sure to tweak them a little -or alot *wink wink*- in the future to meet my expectations.muahahahaha...
