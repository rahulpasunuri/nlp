Made this after having made the blueberry compote/sauce with black pepper, which was AMAZING. This was only okay in comparison.

This is a delicious recipe to serve with pancakes, much better than pancake syrup. I omitted the lemon juice because I used fresh blackberries and did not want it to be too tart. Added some dried blueberries which was a nice touch. I made some without allspice and it was just fine.

I may re-rate this again once I've done it exactly as described, as I did not have any allspice at the time I decided to try it out. I substituted in four whole peppercorns and I feel this probably hardly did any justice to the recipe as allspice is said to be a more complex and flavorful spice. I also used a generous 1 1/2c of blackberries and topped it up with fresh blueberries to make the 2c of fruit. I will make this dish again, as my backyard is brimming with blackberries that are just waiting to be plucked, and next time I will follow the recipe to the letter. Delicious!

This topping is so delicious and incredibly easy. As directed, I used whole allspice, which brings a lot of flavor. I didn't, however, have a seive, but I guess it just depends on how much you hate the seeds. I poured mine over some vanilla ice ceam, but I would try it on just about anything... yum!
