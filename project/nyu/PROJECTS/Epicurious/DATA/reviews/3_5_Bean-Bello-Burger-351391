We thought these were some of the best black bean burgers that we've had. I wrote down the ingredients, so I didn't realize that the beans weren't mashed separately. I added the water sauteed veggies to my mashed beans then added my flax 'eggs' and remaining ingredients. These changes really reduces the amount of fat in the recipe. I didn't change the amount of seasoning, but did add a small amount of smoked paprika.

Whoa, these are tasty! Following other reviewers suggestions, I doubled the spices, added a dash of cayenne pepper, used one whole egg instead of two whites, and added a tbsp or two more breadcrumbs. I also let the veggie/spice mixture cook a bit longer on the stove before mashing it with a potato masher to dry it out and develop the flavors. My patties held together perfectly and received rave reviews around the dinner table.

Everyone loved these...only change was adding a bit more bread crumbs and baking in the oven!!

Easy to make and the results are pretty good. I would mash the beans separately next time and spend less time softening the bell pepper. Too much heat releases a lot of water from the veggies and the pattys can end up soupy if you're not careful.

This was good and pretty easy, but not outrageous. I did not have onion but I used a whole jalapeno, and tripled the spices including Worcestershire. I used one whole egg and the consistency was fine. Fresh lettuce and tomato are important to put on the burger. Get creative, quick and cheap meal.

Worcestershire sauce is NOT vegetarian!! Haven't tried yet, but sounds great minus that ingredient.

I loved this! Not my favorite veggie burger ever, but I'm not always looking for spicy, very flavorful burgers. I added sauteed mushrooms and red onion rings. Wonderful!

Rating: 2
Its good and not to complicated but it needs some major seasoning. I'm surprised that a veggie dish has no salt in the recipe. I would add salt and a jalepeno.

Really good veggie casual lunch or dinner. If you think of it as competing with a hamburger, you may be disappointed as it is as different from a hamburger as chicken. It is delicious in its own right.

To "A Cook from Boone, NC". Annie's Naturals has a vegan Worscestershire sauce.

Tried this last night and was very happy with the results. Good consistency and very tasty, will definitely make this again.

many Worcestershire Sauces have anchovies in them, so unless you are a vegetarian who eats fish, this recipe is NOT for you!!!!!

Hands down, this is the best veggie burger I've ever had.

neither my husband nor i are vegetarians and we thought these burgers were delicious. i mashed the black beans with a potato masher and let the mixture cook a bit longer to get all the moisture out. i wound up using more bread crumbs than called for, and the consistency turned out perfect. the honey mustard and worcestershire sauce add a really nice depth of flavor.

Absolutely delicious! You do have to be sure and cook the liquid out of the mushrooms, onion and pepper mixture prior to adding the beans...and than equally make sure the mixture is cooked to a pretty dry product before adding to the egg whites, etc. Mine turned out perfect in consistency and texture. I didn't add as much oil as noted, as I didn't think it was necessary. Perfect and easy garden burgers and I'll never buy another store bought again. :-)

I see that this recipe is 18.2 grams of fat per serving (I'm assuming that a serving is one patty?). This seems like a lot of fat. Does anyone know where the fat is coming from? Are these burgers huge?

Rating: 4
Great recipe! You really have to use your judgment though when it comes to the consistency. Also, smashing the beans with a spoon did not work. I just let the mixture cool then transferred it into a bowl and squeezed it with my hand. Worked great.

Delicious. But the texture is completely wrong: far too watery. Sloppy Joe indeed. At a minimum, omit the egg whites. And be prepared to bash in the breadcrumbs. For what it's worth, I used smoked hot paprika and a dash of salt. Definitely adds depth of flavor.

We loved this recipe. Will never buy ready made veggie burgers again! I was alarmed when I flipped them as they looked burned, not to worry it's the black beans.

I loved this! It was a little confusing to make at first, but my whole family loved it.

Rating: 1
I had high hopes for this given the great reviews. I didn't let the fact that they completely fell apart bother me (I should have used a non- stick skillet), just figured I'd eat it sloppy joe style. But that slop tasted like refried beans gone wrong. One bite and the rest went in the garbage. I only rated it one fork because I don't know if zero forks counts towards the average.

This recipe works really really well! However, the consistency of the uncooked burger is a bit too liquidy... need to adjust things accordingly with the bread crumbs. My family loved the burgers and they are somewhat anti-vegetarian substitute foods. Now that is saying something :-).

It is possible to find vegetarian Worcestershire sauce if you find that the flavor is necessary but want the dish to be truly vegetarian.

Rating: 0
I would like to make this recipe and will soon, but being a vegetarian I noticed it had Worcestershire sauce which I'll leave out as that has anchovies in it. I'll post a review later, but wanted to let folks know who might have thought this recipe was vegetarian as is. It's not.

Even better than real burgers!! I added some liquid smoke to give them an even more BBQ flavor. I also ate mine without a bun just used lettuce, excellent!

Delicious recipe and much better than frozen ones. I love vegetables and can definitely live without meat. Do include some in diet but not a big fan of meats. Trolls still exist I guess but like Detroit and others stated, they don't count

Being that I was raised on a beef ranch and raise market lanbs now.. this is a really good burger! Its refreshing to get away from meat once in awhile in a different way other than salads.

the burgers were very good. Cope sounds like a troll - someone who likes to add offensive posts to boards/forums just to stir up trouble and watch the fireworks. Trolls are best ignored - they get bored easily and go away.

Cope, haven't tried it yet...but you're the guy who says they don't like something that they've never tried because it doesn't "sound" good. Not a vegetarian, but vegetarian dishes rock. Expand your brain a bit.

I thought these were delicious and pretty easy. Better than the frozen ones I've bought in the past. You can find vegetarian Worcestershire sauce in some specialty food stores or online. WOW FreshCope, that's a pretty broad (and false) generalization about all vegetarians. Why don't we stick to reviewing the recipes/offering helpful information here, eh?

Rating: 0
Wow - fresh cope should try opening their mind a bit to new foods! You dont have to be a vegetarian to enjoy a meatless meal - many people are eating one or two meals a week that are meatless, and they can be equally tasty. This burger was easy and really yummy (on the bbq!) and my hardcore CARNIVORE of a boyfriend loved it.

Wonderful flavors, but how do you hold the burger together? Mine just fell apart when I attempted to brown them.

While I was making this I was trying to figure out why I was making a black bean burger from scratch when there are so many good ones on the market. This one rocked. I would definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Yummy and easy. I used a small yellow onion instead of purple. I think I cooked the mushrooms for too long because the patties seemed too wet so I had to add more breadcrumbs. I think mashing the beans more than I did would help too with the too wet problem.

Delicious. I added cumin and fresh parsley. In place of worcestershire I used some soy sauce and hot sauce; and replaced the garlic powder with fresh garlic. Served with salsa and pea shoots; would make them again any time.
