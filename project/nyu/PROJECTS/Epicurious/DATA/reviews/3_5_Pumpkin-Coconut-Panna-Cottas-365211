I love to serve Panna Cottas and this one is no exception. However, perfectly browned coconut and a high quality honey (local if available) make this Panna Cotta the superb dessert that it is.

I used four teaspoons of gelatin because mine didn't set up as much as I wanted the first time around. Second time around I infused kafir lime and cardamom into the cream and it was a lovely addition.

Sooooo good! So delicate and I loved the coconut and pumpkin. Only problem for me was that it didn't completely set, but I think it's because I used a fresh, roasted pumpkin, which I think was maybe a little more watery.
