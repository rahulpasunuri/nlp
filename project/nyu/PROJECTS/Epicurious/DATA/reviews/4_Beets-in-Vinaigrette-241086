This is as good as everyone says. I used every part of the beet. Stems got sliced very very thin and sauted with a couple of cloves of garlic in olive oil. Leaves were chiffonaded as another person suggested. Both were added to the beets, parsley and dressing. As others suggested I roasted the beets then tossed beets, leaves, stems together in the dressing. Added a little extra vinegar and threw in a few slivered almonds. It was wonderful. If people are chary about using the leaves (a bit too bitter?) or the stems (a bit too tough?) then the beets alone with this dressing are fine. But not as good as they could be! I like someone's idea of crumbling some blue cheese on the salad and thought pignolis or currants might also be good too but will try those another time.

Perfect! The right balance between tart and sweet and oily. Made it as written and my dinner companions ate it right up. A really nice way to eat beets.

This recipe is so easy and just awesome full of flavor. I steamed the beets, I think you may keep more of the flavor and goodness this way, the texture was perfect. I backed off the amount of olive oil and like other reviewers found that it was even better the next day. Thank you for this one.

I agree with the last reviewer that roasting the beets is the way to go. Great cold for a picnic!

Excellent the first time around...even better the second time since I opted to roast the beets instead. It takes the same amount of time and yields a much better texture of the beets.

I thought these were great. They were even better the next day at room temperature! My only suggestion would be to roast the beets rather than boil them.

Yum! I only used 1/8 c. olive oil, and added 2 T. crumbled blue cheese just before serving. It is perfect served just slightly warm.

Loved it! Too hot to roast beets in the summer...this is a great alternative recipe

This recipe was quite good. My hubby (who says he doesn't care for beets) took the leftovers for lunch the next day.

I loved this, my ten year old loved this. Quick and easy, which is always a favorite for me. Will use a little less oil next time.

very good but what really made it excel were the handful of Trader Joe's candied pecans I added. Needs more vinegar too.

I added crumbled roquefort cheese on top to give it a bit more flavour, but this recipe would be good as it is anyway.

This has become a staple in our household, and it gets better the next day.

I used a variety of different types of fresh beets - this dish is beautiful! I used honey instead of sugar (didn't have any) and thought it was quite nice!

I made this but without the parsley (didn't have any) and it was fantastic. I plan to make it for my Gourmet Club dinner.

my husband and i LOVE beets so we always have cans on hand. i have never worked with fresh beets before so i was excited to see how easy it was. and so MUCH BETTER than canned! i'll definitely keep making them.

Good easy recipe for beet fans. Really complements rather than overwhelming the flavor of the beets. I have a confession: I made this with CANNED BEETS!! (maniacal laughter) And it was still very good.

We didn't have cider vinegar so used rice wine vinegar instead. It's a great recipe. the vinaigrette is light and the flavor of the beets really shines. We'll make this one again.

I made this the other night, using Splenda instead of sugar; it's delish. However, because I make beet borscht regularly, using the leaves (personal preference), I did the same. I thinly sliced (chiffonade) them and left them in the dressing with the beets. For my family and our taste, it is great.
