A nice piece of fish doesn't need a lot of adornment, which is why I think this is a great recipe. Super easy and simple, with a subtle fennel flavor.

Nothing special, but quick and simple and ingredients that I always have on hand.

This recipe depends on the quality of the olive oil. I've made it twice - once with inexpensive 'cooking' olive oil and the second with dark green, fruity extra-virgin oil we bought in Tuscany. The second incarnation was a revelation - definitely use the best oil you can find for the best results. This dish needs a strong side-dish - I paired it with cherry tomatoes tossed with garlic, cardamom, orange peel, and more olive oil which I put in a 450 degree oven for 10 minutes.

Don't bother with this recipe, it is very blah. There are a lot better uses for expensive sea bass fillets than this uninteresting and unattractive dish. It was very blah. Also, the parsnip/fennel puree was too sweet for my taste and in my opinion did not blend well with this dish at all. All in all a big flop.

Outstanding, It was well worth the preparation time! We will prepare this again!!!!!

This is a light recipe and very good, specifically if you enjoy the taste of fennel, although the fennel is not overbearing.

was looking for something to do with Snook, a warm water game fish we get in Fl. if we're lucky, When I read this recipe I knew it was ordained that I make it , as how often does one have parsnips and fennel on hand!! I did and my husband said it was the best fish fish he"d eaten anywhere and I couldn"t have agreed more.The combination of flavors was just right. I'm going to try this with other firm white fish soon. I loved the compliments it got!!
