I found that the grapefruit juice made the sauce bitter. Tried making a 2nd time w/out grapefruit adding a little extra oj and it was too much citrus, sauce is just okay. After two tries, will not make again

Well I was looking for a great grilled whole fish recipe and decided on this for lack of choice. A heck of a lot of work for not much bang. For me the purpose of grilling a whole fish is to enjoy the fish and while I was looking for a little spice, I will stick to a simple pepperoncini glaze.
