Added cream cheese, dill and parsley to the basic recipe. Put a tsp into little phillo pastry cups, and topped with smoked salmon. Excellent appetizer.

Excellent and easy starter. Reduced fat sour cream works just as well. We often just put the sauce in a nice bowl and serve alongside a whole smoked fillet.

I used some dill rather than the parsley and added a little cream cheese to give it some body. Served it on serving individual serving spoons for a Christmas party. Tasted as good as it looked. Everyone loved it.

I served this sauce with Home-Smoked Salmon Fillets (also from this site) and it was fabulous! The combination of flavors was perfect.

Served the sauce with meat and it was a hit! However, I added about 2 tsp of the juices from the capers to give it a bit of a stronger flavor.

I found this recipe a disappointment. However, my German guests (echte Deutsche) enjoyed this appetizer.

My husband had a craving for smoked salmon but I didn't have anything in mind for it. I thought this sounded good and it definitely turned out to be a hit! It was so easy and didn't overwhelm the salmon. Just a very nice compliment. Will definitely make this again.

The sauce is wonderful, even when made with reduced fat sour cream. It taste good, also, as a dip for raw vegetables.
