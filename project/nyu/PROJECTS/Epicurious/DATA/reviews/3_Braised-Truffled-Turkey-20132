Mark Bittman at NYtimes.com has an excellent recipe for braised turkey thighs and breasts. No truffles though.

I found this recipe last Thanksgiving when my oven broke a week before the Big Dinner and couldn't be replaced in time. I had only a stove top and a toaster oven to make dinner for 4. The technique in this recipe is wonderful for braising a bone-in turkey breast-- just leave out the pork & truffles, etc. I'm going to make it again this year.

First of all, you better be strong--no carpal tunnel, no rheumatiz. You have to lift and turn a HOT stuffed turkey. Secondly, you don't need as many truffles as possible--you need TONS of truffles in order to taste them after they've been steamed to death, and fresh truffles are very expensive (currently, $1500+ per lb.)--far too expensive to squander. The meat stuffing was nice (just in case you don't have enough turkey meat). The braising turned the beautifully browned skin (that I killed myself trying to brown) into gelatin. In an effort to remedy the situation, I roasted the bird about a half hr. or so--the skin was absolutely gorgeous, but the bird was too dry for me (others liked it). By the time I finished, I wanted to put myself out of my misery with the trussing pins! This wasn't a bad recipe, but it's not one I would make again soon--maybe when senility sets in.
