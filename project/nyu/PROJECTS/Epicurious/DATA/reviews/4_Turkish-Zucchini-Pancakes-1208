I've made this before, but lost the recipe. I added shredded carrots for crunch & use regular onion to replace green onion. Also added more nuts & cheese, it came out great. I even ate it cold for breakfast the next day. Definitely a satisfying vegetarian dish.

This was very okay. It's very easy to get sick of these, I think; the spices are kind of harsh to me. Unfortunately, I didn't use scallions, I used chives, and--being a bit overwhelmed by the smell of the chives--I used probably 1 cup rather than 2. This may have been a stupid idea.

These are the best zucchini pancakes I have ever made, the greens and the herbs giving a much-needed flavor, and feta cheese an extra spike of taste. I made it with 2 eggs and served with sour cream. Thank you!

These were amazing. They are incredible simple to make, just like whipping together pancakes except you have to cut the vegetables first. I stuck to the recipe exactly, and as some people suggested, topped them with the Turkish Mint Marinade Delight. If I made them again I wouldn't go out of my way to make the sauce, but I will certainly be making these delicious and healthy zucchini pancakes again!

I thought these were very good, and I'll definitely make them again. I used regular white onion, grated in my food processor instead of green onion, and cilantro instead of parsley because it was what I had (I think parsley would be better.) But I thought the seasoning was very good - I wouldn't have known to try dill and tarragon together, but neither was too noticable, just made a nice herbal layer. I cooked these on a cast-iron griddle, and that made it hard to control the temperature of the oil, so a pan would be better, but I made these about 30 minutes in advance and kept them warm in the oven and they held up fine. They're also yummy right from the fridge!

Absolutely wonderful! Really well balanced flavors, not heavy and great left over. I served them with the Basil Chive Cream recipe that goes with another zucchini pancake recipe, but substituted mint for the basil, rather than put mint in the pancake itself, as several people suggested. This is a great recipe!

this is great! had this with the turkish yogurt&mint sauce someone else recommended. It was a remarkable match. We had this as a side dish to grilled lamb steaks. A nice zinfandel made it a great meal.

We had an entire Turkish meal and this, along with the Epicurious recipe for Turkish Delight marinade (used as dipping sauce) were the two big hits! Here's the marinade... http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Minted-Turkish-Delight-Marinade-675

Superb. I found 2 eggs and 1/3 cup flour to be sufficient but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

Terrific! I made the recipe exactly as directed, keeping the patties the recommended size so they would hold together. I served them with a very simple sauce of lightly cooked fresh tomato with a touch of garlic. I did need to change oil halfway thru frying--olive oil doesn't hold up well to repeated use. Next time I'll use a larger griddle to avoid this problem.

I've made this recipe twice and will make it again. Terrific summer supper with a salad. Just used whatever herbs I had around, some dill, some parsley. Used very little oil, just a tablespoon or two in the skillet and they browned nicely.

This is the best zucchini pancake I've ever eaten! I served to company who gave rave reviews. I followed every step, but I cut the onion down to 3/4 cup, used half the amt of dill, and half the tarragon. I kept the walnuts--they made them extra special!

Rating: 4
Omg, these were SO GOOD! I don't know how this recipe was supposed to make 20, though, because I was able to make 12. I omitted the walnuts and used eggbeaters to save on calories and they turned out to be a wonderfully healthy, different way to enjoy zucchini. With those substitutions, 2 pancakes (out of my 12) came out to about 130 calories.

These are a great compromise between my taste and my Turkish mother-in- laws. While she cooks them with more cheese, no nuts, less fresh herbs, and all in a TON of olive oil...I prefer the lighter flavor of these. My husband has stayed neutral (smart man) and states he loves both but for very differnt reasons! They are great with a tomato based sauce as well, and can be reheated to recrisp them up in the oven if need be.

Easy, delicious, makes you feel like you're cooking, but with minimal effort. YUM YUM YUM!!!!! (better warm than cold -- gets soggy after a while)

I usually cut the herbs a bit. I've used mint, then dill; like them both. Walnuts chopped in the food processor worked well. Tasty hot, warm, or chilled with sour cream or yogurt. A nice use for all that zucchini.

Really, really tasty. One note: be sure to chop the green onion (scallion) very fine. Otherwise, you end up with chunks of scallion in the pancakes. I served this with Spicy Yoghurt Dip. Delicious.

I loved these pancakes and made them exact to the recipe except I didn't use the walnuts. They were yummy!!

What a surprise! Pulled the recipe from an old Bon Appetit, with no particular expectation, and found it to be WONderful, with no substitutions. In subsequent preparations, I'll try some of the other reviewers' suggestions. A real vegetarian find!

Very tasty, but with some changes. Had no dill nor tarragon, so I used fresh basil and mint. Also used only 2 eggs and increased a bit on the flour to make the pancake a bit more thicker. Served it with a roasted red pepper sauce.

I thought the herbs really overwhelmed the flavor of the zucchini. Next time, I'd cut the amount of fresh dill by about half. As it was, I only used 1 T. of French tarragon, and I'm glad I did; more than that would've been overkill. I'd also increase the amount of feta by 1/4 to 1/2 cup.

This is a very good variation of a dish we call "mucver" in Turkish. The traditional version uses mint instead of tarragon; omits the walnuts, and is served with a dollop of yoghurt mixed with crushed garlic. It is a real treat!

There is always a fight with my son when food is vegetable dish. But this recipe helps me to get 'mmmmm mmmmm good' always. And I agree, omit wulnuts but better to use dry or fresh dill and originally no feta and can add 2-3 mashed garlic cloves.

This is absolutlely easy and delicious! I substituted mint for the dill as was suggested in the reviews and would do it again. The mint added a wonderful layer in the hodgepodge of flavor. I served with hummus and pita bread. The mixture seemed weird and too thick but once I put it in the frying pan, everything worked like magic. Use less onion than the recipe calls for. mmmmmmmmmmm

DO NOT CHANGE A THING!!! These are wonderful! However, do be careful not to salt the zucchini too much when setting to drain (as I did the first time) or you have to rinse, drain and squeeze again. Everyone loves these and asks for the recipe. Another danger is that you just can't stop eating them!

Almost like my Mom's. I am Turkish. Try it with peppermint instead of tarragon and no walnuts, which is how she made this dish.

Wonderful! I love these pancakes. The walnuts and feta really give them something special. Aside from draining and squeezing out the zucchini, a quick recipe. The only change I made was using mint instead of dill. They are perfect! I think my friend Karen would really like these!

These were delicious. I only used salt and pepper for spice and they vanished. I added cooked chicken in 1/2 the batch and they were just as good.

I used mint instead of the dill, (I don't care for dill), and they were yummy! I served them with yogurt. Husband licked the plate clean!

These are delicious. The nuts are a wonderful addition. They also taste great with garlic mashed potatoes and a glass of white wine.

These are yummy! Our favorite version is making small, well-browned till crispy pancakes, keeping batches warm on a baking sheet in the oven. Serve with chicken and a well-reduced wine sauce over the pancakes. Awesome!

Delicious. Skipped the walnuts, didn't have the tarragon, added more feta. I fried them to a variety of "donenesses" and found that the less well-done cakes had a delicate creamy texture.

What a delicious recipe for one of my not so favourite vegetables. I remember these pancakes as a child when my Greek neighbours used to make them. The version I remember had chopped mint in it and no nuts. But this version is excellent.

My mother-in-law is from Turkey, and my husband said these were better than hers! I doubled the flour to make them heartier, and ommited the walnuts. I also used 1/2 cup minced white onion in place of the green, just because I didn't have any on hand. I served with sour cream, but if you really want to make it Turkish, put a spoonful of yoghurt on top.

I followed this recipe exactly, which I rarely do. It seemed like an odd mix, but they turned out great! The walnuts added nice texture, the feta was not overbearing. I served with a Morrocan chicken and couscous dish & got rave reviews from my guests!

I realized at the last moment that I didn't have any tarragon, but it still turned out ok. I think it must be much better with tarragon. They were even better the next day.

I used extra-firm tofu in place of the feta cheese and used 4 egg whites and only one whole egg to make a healthier version. Yum for sure.

These little pancakes are great, but you really need to double the recipe to get 20. I make them silver dollar size. They reheat well at a high oven.
