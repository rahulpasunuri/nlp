I made this exactly as the recipe indicated and was very disappointed with the result. The panna cotta turned out very stiff and very bland. Tasted like kid's glue, according to one of my guests. The figs in sauternes were very good, so at least there was something edible in this dessert. This recipe goes straight into my waste bin.

So simple and the outcome is delicious. I made these without the topping mentioned here (I had some 99% cocao chocolate I melted to put a thin cover on them), only other change I made was I used 2 inches of vanilla bean instead of the vanilla essence (put it in at the start, removed before putting in molds). I'd say they were a rich version of panna cotta and I would consider altering the milk:cream ratio (instead of 1:3 cups ... maybe 2:2) for a lighter dessert. It was even a "lick the bowl" kind of recipe - honey flavoured warm milk/cream!

I used this recipe last weekend for my mother's birthday dinner. She loves Panna Cotta and thought this one was fantastic.

An amended version of this recipe has made its way into my repertoire because I didn't love the fig mixture and thought the proportion of milk to cream made the panna cotta too heavy. I use 2C. whole milk, 2C. cream, and 6 tbsp combined honey and/or sugar. I don't make the sauce. At times, I have mixed in cocoa or jam when the milk/cream is heated, and the results were very good. Anyway, the base recipe here is very good, and you can top the panna cotta with whatever you want (try rosewater syrup and crushed pistachios, for example).

This was delicious, and looks very beautiful. I would not change the basic idea of the topping--the dessert would be boring otherwise. I also would not change the proportions of milk and cream. In my opinion, the texture was not too rich at all with all that gelatin, and I do think it needs to be creamy to stand up to the strong syrup. I did use about half the honey, though, which may be what made it taste not overly rich. I agree that this makes more like 6-7 servings if you are using standard wine glasses.

I made this panna cotta recently for a dinner party and it was a big hit!! I made a raspberry sauce to pour over the top and then sprinkled fresh raspberries over that. Made for a lighter less sweet topping than the figs. We thought the creamy texture was just like what we had in Italy!! YUM!!

I agree with the last cook, I'd use equal parts of milk and cream, this is a very rich dessert. When making a batch, you may need to refridgerate the panna cotta a little while longer than 5 hours OR at a very cold temperature. Mine was not set in the center and had a slightly thicker consistency than melted ice-cream; I'd give it 7 hours next time. Also, I used Muscat made from Canelli grapes since our local wine store did not carry the required dessert wine; and dates instead of figs because the later wasn't available at our grocery market. I guess figs are hard to come by in the east during certain times of the year.

This version of panna cotta is very rich. My husband loved it but I like panna cotta to be more milky. Also, the honey taste didn't really come through and the Sauternes/fig sauce was too sharp for my taste. I would make it again using 1/2 milk 1/2 cream and including a different topping.

Really nice make-ahead dessert. I serve in more generous portions than the recipe does, their portion per person seems a little skimpy.

I don't like figs--are their other good toppings?

This was so easy, but looks like it was a lot of work. Very impressive and delicious. I loved all the scraping sounds of the spoons as my guests tried to get every last bit out of their dessert glasses. I think fresh figs would be even better in this dessert, but they are a rare find on the East Coast, and expensive when you can find them.

Subtle, sophisticated, and absolutely delicious! This is very easy to make, and will impress the pants off of your guests. You only need to chill the panna cotta for ~2 hours, not 5.
