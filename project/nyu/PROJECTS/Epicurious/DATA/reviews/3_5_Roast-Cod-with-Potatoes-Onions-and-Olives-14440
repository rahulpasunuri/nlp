I made some modifications and this is a good recipe for a nice week lunch or dinner. I added more garlic, used only olive oil, fresh chopped rosemary, much more parsley. I also used the same skillet for onion mix and potatoes, making onion mix first. I added freshly grind black pepper to potatoes and onions when mixed together. Along with potatoes, I used carrots and took the same time and prep than potatoes. I marinaded the cod with lemon and fresh onion and garlic paste, adding some "21 spices" from Trader Joes (it is great for marinating fish and has no salt added). I baked for 25 minutes but I guess if I had baked for 20 would be better. The cod got a little dry with 25.

This is a great dish but it would be improved with less oil, both for the onion and potato preparation. I served it with grilled radiccio and apple.

This was a bad, bad recipe. Even using good quality, fresh ingredients, the outcome was a horrible melding of insipid flavours. I will not be making this again.

Yum! I needed a recipe for some frozen cod loin from Sam's club and found this one. It was great for dinner & I'm enjoying the leftovers today for lunch. To save cleanup and amount of oil needed I cooked the onion and garlic (6 cloves)first while I preped the potatoes and then did the potatoes in the same skillet. I had some Black Olive Tepenade (also from Sam's) on hand so substituted it (1/4 cup or so) for the olives and rosemary. To keep fish from sticking I put it on top of the onion/potato mix in the baking dish and sprinked with smoked Spanish paprika (Penzy's) for a touch of color and flavor. This one definitely goes into the keeper file. Next time I may try the spicy tomato sauce for the companion cannelloni recipe as a side sauce for this dish.

I read the reviews about the onions but thought I would try it as is first. 1lb of onions is 2 large and I think it should say to cook them for about 25 minutes till they are golden. The potato onion mixture serves 3 with no leftovers. The olives add a lot of salt so go lightly on adding more. Will make this again and try oven roasting quartered golf ball size potatoes to make it even easier. The presentation is rustic and beautiful.

I have made this twice in two weeks. I loved it with the following changes:I used only one onion (the first time was too many onions for me) and increased the potatoes (added about 2-3 more). Finally I used in total only slightly over 1/4 c olive oil. Did potatoes first for several minutes and then added onion. This simplified the whole process & went much faster. I loved the taste.

This was very tasty. 3 changes: I substituted fennel seed for rosemary; left the skins on the taters, and I upped the potato and lowered the onion to get the following portions: 1.5lbs cod, 1lb potato, 1 lg onion. Also added a dose of red pepper flakes, as per other review, which gave it a pleasant bit of bite. Will make this one again.

The cod was tender and the potatoe mixture was good, but overall the taste was very bland. I even drizzled some flavored oil over the fish just before taking it out of the oven. Everything covered up the taste of the fish, which is fine, if the taste is very good. In this case, it is not.

My husband and I just got home last week from vacationing in Maine. We went deep-sea fishing while there, and caught a lot of cod. Found this recipe and made it for our daughter and son-in-law, and they LOVED it! I also made extra potatoes. Had to print the recipe for my daughter, and I will definately be making this again. The olives were a great touch.

We really enjoyed this dish too. I added tomatoes and more garlic.

I didn't like this as much as everyone else did! The olives seemed to overpower the fish. All these people can't be wrong though - Maybe I'll try it again and see how it goes with fewer olives.

I enthusiastically joine the fan club. This is a wonderful dish. The olives really makes the flavor different, unique and heavenly. I used fresh rosemary instead of dried rosemary. I also blached the potatoes and then sauteed them in the pan that was used to saute the onions and garlic adding just a little extra olive oil. Adding the potatoes to the fish 10 minutes after it had been placed in the over to prevent overcooking the potatoes. Slight problem with fish sticking to the casserole dish so I would recommend adding a little oil to the casserole dish before placing the fish in the oven. I'm going back for seconds right now. Great recipe!

I can't even begin to tell you just HOW delicious this recipe was. If you're a fish lover then this is the recipe for you. The cod turned out sooo tender. The potatoes were to die for. I made 2LB of potatoes to 2 1/2 LB of cod. I also added some chili pepper. My boyfriend who's Portugese and an expert on this dish gave it 2 thumbs up. Please give it a shot!! I might try to bake the potatoes next time, I stunk of frying oil afterwards.

A great cod dish! I agree with the cook who suggested using more potatoes. Also, we did add more salt and rosemary. There is a great picture on page 166 of Gourmet Fresh, the cookbook that highlights vegetables from the Farmers Market!

A good, hearty cod and potatoes dish with a healthy dose of oil. Not outstanding, but certainly a good everyday meal. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) Instead of 1LB onions to 1LB potatoes, I would increase the potatoes to 1.5 pounds. 2) I found it just a little bland, so would use a liberal amount of salt and double the crushed rosemary to 1 tsp. I might also increase the olives, however my wife thought any more would be overkill. NOTE: Be sure to cut your olives in half and remove the pits.

This is my favorite cod recipe. A wonderful combination of tastes. The juice is to die for.

It is an excellent dish. I tried it with salmon, with very good results. Instead of frying the potatoes I blanched them in chicken broth, to cut the oil.

I lost my issue with this cod dish and now I can make it again and again! It is always a favourite! THANK YOU
