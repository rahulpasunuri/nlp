This does taste good. But it never set up, so I wasn't that impressed. I do plan on using the tasty crust for a different dessert, though.

I just made this, but it's still in the freezer. I imagine it will taste fine because I like orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream (I substituted). One thing I want to note, in the preparation, it says to freeze the first layer for 30 minutes and to soften the vanilla during that time. I would increase that amount next time. I didn't make sure the orange part was frozen enough and the vanilla part was too hard to spread and I almost had a disaster. I managed to fix it. I just think it will take a lot longer to freeze solid enough to make a good presentation. I'm looking forward to trying new flavor combos.

Used organic vanilla wafers for the "crust" and substituted raspberry sorbet and fresh raspberries for garnish, as a variation on theme. This was a nice light dessert, we enjoyed it after a big Christmas dinner, it would also be a great dessert for a hot summer day.

Very tasty! I used light whipped topping on top instead of the yogurt and it lightened the whole thing up to perfect. I also used orange extract instead of orange zest in the crust, and added a hint of vanilla extract to the crust mix. As a previous review noted, hot day, perfect dessert.

I just love this dessert. It is so easy and is a very nice presentation as well. There are many variations. You could use vanilla and chocolate ice cream, add nuts, etc. I find it very refresing and a nice way to end a meal.

I made this recipe with the following substitutions:mango sorbet,vanilla icecream and a local cookie called speculoos.It turned out very well and I will make it again.

I really enjoyed this but I don't think the sorbet had enough flavor. Next time I'll use sherbet and french vanilla ice cream. Not as fat conscious, but tastes better. ;-)

Very easy to prepare and a very tasty low-fat dish! Couldn't find orange sorbet, so I substituted orange sherbert which worked fine.

This was a very refreshing dessert on a hot day. It was just as I had expected, so I was pleased and everyone seemed to enjoy it.

My crust was hard as a rock. No idea what went wrong, but I wouldn't try it again.

Curious to know what the "cook" from the UK did incorrectly to make this dessert so disastrous??? Personally, I was disappointed in this as well, but to go so far as disgusting on something so plain and simple to make is a bit extreme. It was just that...plain and simple.

This was probably the most disgusting recipe we have ever 'cooked' - disastrous.

Refreching and repeatable. Used Haagen-Dazs Peach Sorbet in lieu of orange sorbet, and french vanilla ice cream. Had no problem with the crust, and found it to be fantastic. Would like some suggestions as to dressing up the top layer for enhanced presentation. Thx!

I made this for a large group (12) in a 11x9 pan (quadrupled the recipe). I made the orange sorbet and used french vanilla ice cream, putting the sorbet as the first and third layer, with the vanilla ice cream in the middle. I grated orange peel on the top. Everyone raved and went back for second (and some third) helpings! I did not have the problem with the crust. The first layer, without the orange peel, was not very flavorful, so will put orange peel in both layers next time. Definitely a WINNER!

I thought this recipe was quite tasty. I made the sorbet, and I froze yogurt in my machine as well. I wasn't all that pleased with the yogurt, but I will try again with another brand, perhaps. I will say if you want something truly refreshing, make the orange sorbet from the 2002 April issue, of Bon Appetit,and keep it simple.

I made this with berry sorbet and vanilla ice cream. Decorated the top with berries I snuck from the neighbor's garden. I would give this recipe a 3 1/2 forks. I thought that it tasted great and looked very attractive. My guests loved it. Unlike other reviews, I thought the crust was excellent. Sometimes "simple" can be a wonderful surprise.

Save yourself the trouble and buy a premade reduced fat graham cracker crust. It tastes better and is MUCH easier to cut. This is a pretty good low cal dessert if you're counting calories. I prefer it with raspberry sorbet, but that's just me.

Made this with some modifications for a light finish to a fried chicken dinner. Substituted lemon sorbet and lemon zest so in order to take advantage of some fabulous fresh Jersey blueberries I got at the farmers market -- added them as a separate layer after softening them SLIGHTLY with a couple of teaspoons of water and a little sugar. I'm going to try the creamsicle version when blueberry season is past (sniff!)

Perfect end to a "chick lunch"-- my friends appreciated the low-fat nature of this recipe. I used decent quality sherbert/yogurt and received raves.

Do not try this on a really hot day if your freezer isn't up to it! I tried the tip of coffee ice cream (actually coffee toffee) and one layer added a nice touch. I also made it in a large pan, added additional layers and put the cookies on the top. Pretty good, I'll try again on a cooler day!

This was very ordinary. Light & refreshing but nothing special.

Delicious and refreshing. I followed the recipe but had to increase ingredients to fit in a slightly larger size loaf pan. Also made the pork wraps on the same page of that issue of Gourmet and they are fabulous!!!

A very nice, refreshing dessert that is very easy to prepare. I doubled the recipe and it fit nicely in an 8x8 baking pan. I will definitely make this again.

Hey Boston cook - I was at that dinner party (I think!), and loved it! I'm printing it out to use for a book club dessert next week. Thanks for the yummy dessert. JH

OK, this recipe was good, but I think I improved it. I made this first by the recipe (used sherbet, as my grocery store didn't have sorbet)and it was tasty. The second time however, I combined this with a funky suggestion of my Mom's, from her youth. Instead of vanilla ice cream, try coffee with the orange (either sorbet or sherbet). So it's no longer 'creamsicle', but I'll bet you'll like it better!

I made this for a small dinner party and they really enjoyed it. Next time, I will layer everything upside down so the top layer of vanilla looks neater.

Haven't tried this, but I have a question. I'm considering making this for a July 4th party which is 45 minutes from my home. Will it stand up to the travel or does it melt quickly? thanks!

Just thought I'd point out, sherbert and sorbet are not the same thing, at least not in America. Generally sorbet is dairy/egg free, while sherbet is not.

It was a light and refreshing dessert. Really easy to make, and everyone seemed to like it. Yet, it did not "WOW" anyone. When cooking for others we are always wanting to impress and this was not all that impressive. Just okay.

This was very good and very simple. I used an almond cookie type crust that belongs to a cheesecake recipe I have instead of this one. By the way, "sorbet" is french for "sherbet", so you used the right stuff, Claremont.

I couldn't find Orange Sorbet so substituted Orange Sherbet and also doubled the recipe. Everyone has said it's delicious-I agree-and very easy and fast.

I changed the crust instructions and got WONDERFUL results. 1. I used a combo of ground grahams and pistachios and 2.I layered the cake in reverse order (crust on top); that gave the cake a nicer shape, and allowed for a very thick (and not rock-solid-packed) crust.

I thought this was a great simple low cal desert I thought the texture of the crust was complimentary with the sorbet and frozen yogurt.

I thought the crust was not good in its texture, though the flavor was nice.

Agreed! The crust was too hard to enjoy. I also thought it was comparable to sorbet and frozen yogurt on a bowl - adding some sugar wafers instead of vanilla to that would even be better.

Rating: 1
Agree with Joe. You can get the very same effect by putting the 2 ice creams in a bowl as the crust gets too hard anyway and tastes like hard lumps in the ice cream. And if you don't cover it in an airtight way it can get that freezer taste.

I was disappointed. I used the best ingredients according to the directions, and honestly when done I felt like it would have been just as good with just the sherbet and frozen yogurt spooned on the vanilla wafers. The only thing the butter and corn syrup did was add fat and calories. It was a waste of time processing the wafers and orange peel and using up good plastic wrap. However, the combination of the sherbert, frozen yogurt and vanilla wafers is very good, it is just that this recipe wasted my time.

I cheated and used vanilla ice cream with the orange sorbet. Even if it wasn't "low-fat" it was truly refreshing and the whole family asked for it again. Next time I will try Peach Sorbet or Mango.

I doubled the recipe in order to serve 8. I also melted 2 squares of chocolate to drizzle between the layers. Next time I would make smaller layers and make more than two. I think it would look nicer when sliced. Served with walnut cookies, my guests loved it.

I like the idea of using different flavors (not a big orange fan). For those of you who substituted other flavors, did you use anything in place of the orange zest?

Made this for company and everyone loved it. Used "light" vanilla ice cream instead of yogurt. Served with sliced fresh strawberries. Yummy This will be a "go to" recipe because it was so easy and delish!

THIS IS A REALLY FAST AND EASY RECIPIE THAT WOULD MAKE A GREAT CAKE TO HAVE IN THE FREEZER ALL THE TIME. I MADE IT WITH RASPBERRY SORBET AND VANILLA ICE CREAM. I THINK IT CAN BE MADE WITH ANY COMBINATION AND BE A SUCCESS. A LITTLE RASPBERRY PUREE AROUND THE PLATE AND IT LOOKS ELEGANT.

I haven't made this yet, but it sounds great!! Nothing to feel guilty about if you have this for dessert! I will substitute chocolate frozen yogurt for the vanilla, as vanilla has a funny after-taste. Hagaan Daz, here I come!

Delicious, light and refreshing. For a more creamy taste, I would substitute real vanilla ice cream for the vanilla frozen yogurt. My family asked for more.
