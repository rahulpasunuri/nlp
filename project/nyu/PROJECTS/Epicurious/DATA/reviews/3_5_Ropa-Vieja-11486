Successful recipe with one important modification. I agree that the taste is bland when following recipe 'as is'. Adding 1tb+ of sherry vinegar once fully cooked adds an amazing dimension to this dish. I also served the red and yellow peppers separately (did not want to deter my kids), and added to the leftovers. Also, this meal was definitely more flavorful the next day. Consider making in advance.

Great recipe with some minor modifications based on other reviewer's suggestions. Make sure you have enough time and if possible, a dish washer because you can create quite a mess with this dish. I used a pressure cooker to get the meat (pot roast) extra tender and then used a crock pot for 8 hours to blend the flavors together at the end. I significantly increased the spices for extra flavor, including the addition of thyme. Fresh peas are a must as I detest frozen ones. Because no reviewer seemed to love the rice recipe, I served this dish with mashed sweet plantains mixed with sour cream and greek yogurt. While I typically lean towards spicy food, I don't think this particular dish benefits from heat as much as it does from simmering time to bring together the flavors.

Absolutely loved it, but I reduced the amount of peppers--only because my husband can't stand them. I couldn't get over how tasty everything was.

This recipe is nothing like authentic ropa vieja. Even if it wasn't authentic, the taste is just bland. Nothing pops out about and its just something to get through rather than enjoy. Considering the amount of time it takes to make it and the taste of the end result, I would not recommend anyone make it.

This was easy to do. I did not use the green peppers and it did need some more spicing up. I added more cumin and oregano to the second part of the recipe. We added some chopped cilantro at the end and served it with black beans and mashed ripe plantains.

If you have a pressure cooker, use it for the braise (15-mins at medium pressure, let it cool naturally). I then reduced the liquid with the vegies still in the pot, mashing them slightly with a potato masher. I then strained directly into a straight-sided skillet with the sauteed peppers/onions to speed the recipe, and reduce the number of pots. With a pressure cooker, you can use any pot-roast type meat on sale - 7-blade works fine. The braise takes a fair amount of salt to freshen the flavors, else will be bland. Excellent recipe. If you must use peppers, try Chile Molido, a mild form of pepper used in many Southwestern dishes. Adds depth/complexity without adding inauthentic heat.

The number of (simple)steps involved in this dish, provide the layering of texture, colors and flavors that make Ropa Vieja the exciting dish that it is. As to someone saying they would be ahead by bypassing the kitchen to order in a restuarant instead; well... Olive Garden has an excellent website..

this is a very delicious week night meal. i cooked the flank steak in the crock pot instead of on the stove and i used 2 less peppers because i don't remember ropa vieja being so peppery. it came well. good flavors and tons of leftovers. i think it's one of those dishes that will be even better the next day.

I (almost) followed this recipe to a 't'. The only change I made was to use leftover beef broth along with the water. This recipe was SO good, it has GREAT flavor and can be served different ways. I chose not to add extra braising liquid because I was serving the ropa vieja in tortillas. I served the rice (with added black beans) on the side. We didn't care for the rice. It was pretty bland. Maybe if you're serving the ropa vieja on top of the rice that blandness wouldn't matter. This recipe would easily serve 12.

Tasty and easy! This recipe was delicious as is the first time around and made better for our tastes on the second try with the following additions/changes: Used 4 pounds of meat; needed to cook for three hours to get the meat fork tender; used a food mill to process the cooked vegetables and added to the reduced braising liquid; doubled all the dry spices; substituted capers for olives.

This recipe was tasty, but much more trouble and expense that it was worth. Go out for Cuban. It will be as tasty, much less trouble, and probably cheaper.

Fabulous dish! The meat needs to cook longer than the recipe calls for to be "fork tender". I also reduced the stock a bit more and added some wine to enhance the flavors. Great leftovers. I can't wait to make it again.

very good, but a pork butt either roasted or boiled (with bay leaf) is awesome. When I ate this at cuban restaurant in key west, they used pork, hence my substittion. Pork butt, Pork steaks, or Pork country style ribs (all the same thing) cooked down and then shredded is unbelievable.

Very authentic, as I remembered it from my favorite Cuban/chinese restaurants in NYC. I substituted a pot roast for the flank steak, and stewed it for quite a bit longer (~90 min) at the end before adding in the sauteed peppers and tomatoes (I substituted fresh firm peeled Roma tomatoes for the canned ones). I also used a good measure of thyme, and a dollop of achiote paste dissolved in warm water intensified that deep red color. When making the yellow rice, I added some of the stewed chopped vegetables (onion, carrot and celery) left over from the original stew pot, sauteeing them with the cumin seed, saffron and rice (with a bit of turmeric as well), and used chicken broth as well as some of the stewed beef broth to finish cooking it.

Make as is - excellent flavors. Cuban food is about flavor, not spice.

Noooooooo habenero or other hot peppers needed or wanted w/ this dish should you want an authentic flavour. Originally, this dish was made with tougher cuts of meat hence the skirt or flank makes good sense as would a chuck roast.....I use gandules or pigeon peas instead of green peas but that's just honouring "Abuelita". Next time I'll add some thyme what sadly seems to be missing from here for that true Island flav. Luverly beginning on a Cubano classic.

This dish has great flavor, including the rice. The only change we made was substituting Pablanos for the green peppers to add a little heat. This makes at least six generous portions. Highly recommended.

This is good to start, but only goes so far. Simmering at the end for twenty mins will not give you the marriage of the flavors an will probably leave you disatisfied. This is A STEW not a quick sauce. Before braising please brown the meat then add braising liquid and meat. You could accelerate this step by using a pressure cooker. Then the rest as in the recipe but LET IT STEW for 2-3 hours until everything gets this dark red hue that will leave wanting to come back for more.

This was delicious, and in true epicurious review fasion, I did change some things. I blended up the braising vegetables, and added them to the finished product rather than tomato paste. But over all, really excellent.

Husband's turn to cook last night and he made this for me - we both thought it was was amazing. We did not think it was bland - it was just right and the aroma was out of this world. When I added a little habanero (just to see), the habanero completely overwhelmed the flavour. I am looking forward to leftovers today and encounters with this dish frequently in the future.

After having Ropa Veija in a Key West Cuban resturant (one recommended by Gourmet in fact). I went on a search for a recipe for to replicate the experience and this one comes pretty close. Flank and skirt steak give so much more flavor than other cuts that may be more tender. It's worth the extra effort to shred more carefully and chew a little longer. 2001 review! Substitute Pablano chilies for the green bell peppers for more flavor and a bit of heat. I've never added the peas because this recipe gets better on each reheat and I think the peas would suffer greatly. It's still one of my sons favorite meals. 2007- this time I paired it with "my" version of Saffron Orzo from this site. We like it better than the Yellow rice.

delicious, made it w/ good quality pork instead of beef(just bc thats what I had and needed to do something w/ it), was really delicious still, meat flaked perfectly and was so moist, cooked half beef broth instead of water for a little more beef flavor tho, served w/ jasmine rice, time consuming, but not too labor intensive, really worth the effort. Thanks!

..added recaito when simmering meat and tomatoes/paste in order to give it that authentic flavor. Did not need the peas, the bell peppers lent plenty of flavor and color to this dish. I served with white rice, yucca (con mojo) and black bean soup. Fantastic recipe!

Rating: 4
Unlike the numerous suggestions below, do not add hot peppers or crushed red pepper to make this dish "spicier." Ropa vieja is not like Mexican food and does not have an overwhelming spiciness to it; it is mostly sweet. For that reason, I would also stick with sweet peppers. And for the love of God, do not substitute a frozen vegetable mix for the peas! (Oh, the humanity!) Just omit the peas.

Soooo yummy. I made this for a small casual dinner party with a group of college buddies. This is the great recipe for getting all your friends into the kitchen chopping and shredding and chatting. This is as good as the Ropa Vieja I've had in some Houston Cuban restaurants, which are really very good. Put one friend in charge of making Mojitos and you're sure to have a good time.

This dish is utterly sublime! And while the preparation may take a bit of time, none of the steps is complicated at all, and there's plenty of time in between to do other stuff in or out of the kitchen. Of course I did make some changes. I couldn't bring myself to boil flank steak so I bought a brisket of bison meat. My impetus for preparing this dish was that I wanted to boil the meat in water, not wine, beer, or tomato juice as with so many brisket recipes. (At the end of this I had an ice cube tray of delicous beef broth BTW.) I also wanted to use my slow cooker, which meant that the braising step took 6 hours on low but came out perfectly tender (plus I had time to go to a movie). I also loved finishing the dish and bringing together the flavor components: the sauteed veggies, the reduced broth, the shredded meat, even the frozen veggies really produced a delicious result, which of course was even better the next day! And BTW, most of us who want to try new dishes don't have a grandmother's version to compare it to. So if someone's palate prefers more spice or other nontraditional ingredients, who cares? No one's in the kitchen but you and the only people whose opinions matter, if at all, are the ones who actually tasted the dish. For instance, I didn't have frozen peas but I did have a frozen combo of peas, corn, carrots, and green beans. That may not be traditional, but hey, it's the first itme I made this dish and I made it my own, now didn't I?

My husband and I thought this was wonderful. I used half water and half beef stock for the braising liquid. Next time will add more olives, it's not enough for the entire dish. Also spice it up a bit with fresh crushed red pepper. It's a bit time consuming but worth it.

Loved it! Tasted just like I remembered from a Cuban restaurant in Miami, FL. Cubans there told me Ropa Vieja was traditionally made from left over Vaca Frita ("fried cow") which is a pan sauteed flank steak topped with onions and garlic. The left over steak was shredded and stewed with the vegetables noted in this recipe. Anyway, would definitely make this tasty dish again.

Prepared my own version of this recipe from left-over beef fajitas ingredients. Included grilled flank steak with a chili and cumin rub, sauteed red onions, peppers, and garlic, as well as homemade salsa fresca. Added sliced beef to pan to warm, then poured on salsa, red wine, small spanish olives, and capers as well. Topped off with pepper and onion mixture. Let braise for 30 minutes and Voila! Served over red spanish rice. Nice use of left-overs.

After reading all of the reviews I have to say this: Hispanic cooking is not homogenous. There are many spanish speaking countries with many different spices. This receipe is fine the way it is! Ropa vieja is not a spicy dish. Period.

Rating: 3
The key to this recipe is to make sure that the broth simmers down to cloudy brown consistency--this ensure a nice strong flavor. If the broth is too thin the end result will be rather bland. As recommended in other posts, the amount of bell peppers can be cut in half. I added a couple dashes of cayenne to add some heat.

my kids have been lusting for ropa vieja since a recent visit to florida and this satisfied their craving beautifully. used beef boullion in the stock, reduced the # of peppers. The rice is a winner, too. I had a recipe years ago, very similar, for the crock pot - cut up the flank steak, and add the tomatoes, and cook all day on low.

This was a winner. Instead of 2 quarts water, I used 1 quart water, 2 cups red wine, and 2 cups beef broth. Also I left out one of the green bell peppers since I'm not a big fan of those. Otherwise followed it exactly.

This was rather time consuming but worth the effort (but I must say that I'm one of those people that doesn't mind being in a kitchen all day cooking for my family). My sister loved it saying that it was one of the best things I made. My mother on the other thought it tasted too much like pepper (but that's also because peppers never settle well with her). I recommend eating this with some white rice.

I simmered the skirt steak much longer than the recipe called for in order for it to become tender. Instead of shredding it with 2 forks, I simply cut across the grain in narrow strips. The meat naturally shredded and was extremely tender! In Miami, this would never be served with saffron/yellow rice. Only white!

Because of the reviews that said the meat was chewy, I cut the meat into 4 pcs before cooking it, and extended the simmer time. It turned out very tender, even though we used tritip instead of flank. I served it with Grilled Jerk Chicken, also from this site, and got more compliments for the Ropa Vieja. It's definitely worth making!

The recepi is pretty closed to the original dish made in Cuba.

The meat was accompany with some steamed white rice. It was delicious.

Rating: 4
Very labor intensive and time consuming BUT absolutely delicious and worth every minute that went into its preparation. Wonderful taste and the meat just melted on our tongues. I used veal instead of beef, so that probably contributed to the tenderness of the meat. Since peppers are expensive this time of the year, I used maybe just about half of the required amount, and it didn't matter a bit. Also, to simplify matters just a tiny bit, I skipped the last step where the peppers are pre-cooked separately and then added into the stew: I just threw them in and I do not think their taste would have been different had I followed the recipy. I do not know much about Cuban food, but this is one of the best things I have ever eaten.

My father used to make this dish, but unfortunately he passed away several years ago, so I could not get the recipe from him. This recipe seems closest to the way he made it, but I would be interested in input from some Cuban cooks on any recommendations to make the dish more authentic. I do agree it is important to take the time to shred the beef very fine with two forks and after shredding it I put the shredded beef back in the braising liquid to keep the beef from drying out, while I cooked the onions, garlic and green peppers.

This dish is very nice, but has a few too many bell peppers to remind me of mom's or grandma's. Also, as a side to those who found this dish "bland," it is only bland if you believe all Latin American cuisine uses hot peppers and must have a "hot bite." As the Brooklyn and Miami cooks have pointed out, do not confuse Mexican (and, at that, peasant Mexican) with the cusine of all Latin America. In fact, the only way most cooks not familiar with Latin American cuisine seem to find to "spice" a Latin American dish is "hot peppers." Unless you also add hot peppers to all Mediterranean cuisine (with which Cuban has much more in common than Mexican), try upping the garlic, oregano, or cumin, and use Spanish or Vidalia onions. Also, to the cook from British Columbia, your idea sounds very nice and, I would also suggest serving it with a cornmeal porridge, atop pasta, or under mashed potatoes for a type of shephards pie. That said, however, while "foodies" do mix cusines, let us not pretend that the sole use of Mexican accompaniments to Cuban cuisine (review other Cuban recipes on-line, apparently the only mix cooks find is Mexican ingredients) creates fusion. I find the single mix terribly ethnocentric, as are the comments that the dishes are bland, which basically means "It isn't as hot as Mexican." Well, its not supposed to be, and thank goodness for that. (Though, I do like Mexican.) It is irritating that if this dish had been labeled Italian, Spanish, or Portuguese, I bet few would have thought it bland or added hot peppers, or thought of it as a filling for Mexican food.

Real, "foodies", borrow from different ethinic cusines all the time to make something, while not "ethinically correct" wonderful to eat....Amazing.... I liked the recipe so I used the base of this dish to make it for chimichangas, IT was incrediable! I simmered the meat for about three hours on low until it was just falling apart. I then took the meat out of the stock and removed the veggies the reduced the stock to 1 cup which I added back to the meat.I then proceded to make chimchangas and my family went crazy. They were awsome with homeade salsa, sour cream, lettuce and cheese. It made 15 so I froze the rest for another dinner when I need to score brownie points

This is not exactly authentic but it is pretty close for a non-Cuban. Traditionally this is served over white rice however. You may need to cook the meat a little longer in the broth to prevent the chewy texture that some have complained about (it should be fork tender). Note to the reviewer that used Mexican seasonings: Mexican and Cuban cuisines are very different (Cuban food isn't spicy as some people believe) so using American 'Mexican Seasoning' would kill this dish. Same goes for making chimichangas out of it (reviewer from B.C.). Amazing....

I did marinate the beef overnight in some cumin, garlic and mexican seasoning - I had orinally planned to grill the flank steak. I also omitted the olives and peas, they're really not necessary. It's a lot of work, best for a rainy Sunday. It's definetly worth it.

I served it with yellow rice and seasoned frijoles negros.

After making this recipe once, I think the ingredients are good but the process is unnecessarily labour intensive. Since I streamlined it, I have been much happier with the results (made it three more times). Basically I put all of the braising veg (onion, carrot, pepper, celery) in the blender with a big can of stewed tomatoes and a cup or so of extra water. Then I cook the meat in the puree few hours on very low heat. After that, the liquid doesn't need much reduction, especially with the paste. I still add the sauteed onion and pepper at the end though. Now I'd give the dish three-four forks!

I've made this dish before (from my mom's recipe) and was curious about how differences would effect the overall presentation. We (mom & I) both agreed that this is an excellent version.

was concerned about cuts of meat used being tough and chewy as some described. Due to busy schedule I cooked a bottom round roast in the crock pot with 1 cup beef broth and seasonings, cooked for 10 hours on low, and the second time 5 hours on high. When cooked, remove and shred with knife and fork. Procede with recipe as is. You can cook and shred the meat one day and do the second part another day, if you are too busy to do all in one day and it comes out fine. Using this cut of meat was much cheaper, bought it on sale for $1.69/lb, alot cheaper than skirt or flank steak and was very tender. We used different colored peppers, green, red, yellow and orange, it presented nicely. We used packaged yellow rice and served with spicy black beans. It was a very good and different meal than we usually do with bottom round roast.

I thought this was a very tasty recipe that looks like it will be hard to make but isn't if you make it when you have ample time. The only suggestion I would have is to shred the meat a little more (my Cuban boyfriend says it should have been shredded more.) I don't know if it was the meat I used or the amount of time I cooked it (I didn't use exact calculations) but the meat was a bit chewy. Otherwise serve with fried plaintains and white rice. YUM
