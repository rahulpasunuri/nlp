We had fresh crabmeat (living near Chesapeake Bay) that we had just picked. It was delicious and easy. Since we get crabs on a regular basis, this will be a favorite for us. Since we just made it last night, we haven't tried it chilled over salad but can predict it will be just as delicious.

I made this for a Christmas party this past season and people devoured it -- it was delicious. I omitted the sundried tomatoes because I thought they'd overwhelm the other flavors. Everyone loved it the way it was.

I was really expecting great things here because I love all the ingredients. The flavors just didn't end up coming together. A waste of expensive crabmeat!
