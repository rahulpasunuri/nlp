I often use this recipe to good effect for spinach as we can't really get much variety in terms of greens here.

This was excellent - my husband and I ate the entire (supposed) 10 servings. Don't use mustard greens - they are too fuzzy and bitter, even when young. I recommend beet greens, spinach, and other tender, less bitter greens. Also, heat dressing in a large pot and add greens to it after you've removed it from the heat. That will allow you to wilt the greens just a bit and increase the overall tenderness of the greens.

Tried this with 100% olive oil & cider vinegar, extra-virgin & cider vinegar, extra-virgin & balsamic....all were delicious, tho we preferred the extra-virgin & cider vinegar
