Thomas Keller does not let down wtih this recipe as usual. I made this just as directed because well, you can't do better than French Laundry. It was amazing. The blend of flavors very well balanced. The sauce was powerful, yet not overbearing with Salmon and the blanched celery which I initially questioned added a freshness that was a phenomenal compliment. This will impress even the most discerning guest. A keeper for me.

Wow; absolutely amazing! We used sourdough instead of brioche and thought it came together perfectly. Sauteed the celery with butter instead of blanching.

a friend suggested I check out this recipe, so I did. I'm not sure if I cut the celery correctly. Using my mandoline was really difficult for a full stick of celery, so I chopped the celery into 1' lengths and then julienned from there with a knife. My husband said there wasn't enough truffle flavor. I used a jarred truffle as fresh was not available. I think you could increase the white truffle oil. Cook the fish a little more if your preference isn't rare. I was able to put this dish together in about 20 minutes start to finish. If you did a little prep beforehand, you could do it in 10, making it perfect for dinner guests!

Great stuff. I actually went all out and made the brioche from scratch too. Hard work; next time I'll buy the brioche but stick to form on everything else.

After having made one other french laundry recipe, we doubled the amount of sauce and increased the salmon portion size from the start. We still would have run short if one of our guests hadn't taken ill. We recommend using 6 oz portions of the salmon and increasing the crouton size and celery stalks as well. Even with frozen himalyan truffles, the interaction of subtle flavors was terrific. Can't wait to try this with fresh truffles.

I made this dish for Valentine's day this year, and my husband told me I brought my cooking talent "to the next level." We were both flabbergasted at how amazing these flavors come together-the brioche, the celery, the buttery truffle sauce with the salmon--absolutely out of this world!
