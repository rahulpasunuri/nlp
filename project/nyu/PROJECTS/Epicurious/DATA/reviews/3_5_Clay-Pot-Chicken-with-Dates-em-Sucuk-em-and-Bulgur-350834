Really easy, super tasty. I'd definitely recommend. I didn't use the sausage, and would probably add more bulgur. Try it!

Even with all my shortcuts and substitutions, this is a hearty dish with interesting flavors. Here is how I butchered it: Used a can of green chiles instead of all the peppers, used canned crushed tomatoes instead of fresh, 2 ounces of bulgur seems like so little so I used six (this made the dish HUGE), used cut up chicken breasts, used lamb sausage instead of whatever sucuk is. This only thing I will probably change next time is to stick to the correct amount of bulgur wheat, the amount I used soaked up all the sauce.

This recipe is easy to make and delicious. And your house smells great while you are cooking it. Highly recommended. (I cut the star anise to half of one, since I'm not a big fan of that "licorice" taste.)
