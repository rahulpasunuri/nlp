Delightful recipe. I made a few changes that made it even better. Someone suggested adding garlic and rosemary. So, I added two minced cloves of garlic and laid a large sprig of rosemary on top of the chicken before putting it in the oven. I added a few drops of Tabasco sauce to the mixture in the pan to boost the flavor. I also raised the oven temperature to 400 degrees and baked the chicken for 30 minutes.

This was tasty and really easy to do. I skipped the bacon (for time purposes and calories), but added some red pepper flakes and baby spinach right at the end. Next time I'll add some fresh herbs and garlic. This will definitely become one of my regular go-to recipes.

This recipe is a great recipe for a cold weather dinner. It is pretty basic, I definitely added my spin. Here goes: I used all pieces of the chicken, not just thighs. I added garlic when I was sauteeing the onions, about 2 TBSP of Herbes de Provence, some fresh sage and a splash of wine to deglaze the pan. I let this all cook together a few minutes, then added the rest of the ingredients. I also added about 2 cups of chicken broth before I put it in the oven, as there wasn't enough liquid to cover the chicken. It baked and came out super tender, and super delicious! I only gave it three forks because I felt it needed a bit more zing added to it. (Gave it a shot of hot sauce in my bowl after serving) I will use this recipe again, putting my own spin on it each and every time!

This recipe is a great jumping off point; the ingredients of this recipe seemed a little bland (and I actually loathe stewed tomatoes), so after reading several reviews I made a lot of changes which resulted in a delicious meal. I substituted boneless, skinless chicken breasts for thighs, and canned diced tomatoes for stewed; reduced onion to one, and added diced carrots to the onions. Then, I added about a teaspoon of crushed garlic and cooked until fragrant, added some white wine and cooked down until almost dry, before adding the tomatoes, along with about a teaspoon of bouquet garni (not being able to decide which herb would be best), simmered the tomato/onion/carrot/garlic mixture for a few minutes, added the beans, nestled the browned chicken breasts into the bean/tomato mix, and cooked on low heat, covered, on the stovetop, rather than the oven. I know that my version is quite different from the recipe as written, but it was really good, and I will definitely make it again. The bouquet garni is a nice mix of various herbs, nothing too overpowering, but gave the beans a good flavor. I had a chicken with bean dish at a pub/restaurant in Vancouver recently, which gave me the idea for chicken and beans in the first place, but knew that just cooking chicken, beans, onions and tomatoes would not be enough. I think that there is a lot of room for creativity in this recipe and I would not hesitate to vary the ingredients depending on individual preferences as well as what is available.

this is a wonderful recipe. but it can be improved. add a small amount of garlic to the tomatoes and a small amount of sage to the mix at the end and after browning the chicken, deglaze the pan with some white wine

Made this for a weeknight meal, and it was wonderful - a perfect dish for fall/winter. I made a few modifications though. I only used one can of beans, and I added mushrooms and garlic to the onions. I also used regular canned tomatoes, skinless boneless chicken thighs, and deglazed the pan with red wine before transferring everything to the oven to bake. This is definitely the kind of recipe that can and should be added to depending on what you have available. I'm sure I will be making this again soon.

i thought this was very tasty! I doubled the amount of chicken and used breasts and drumsticks. based on other reviews, i added several cloves of garlic, carrots, and celery. i used 2 cans of tomato, one diced and one stewed and larger white beans (it was all i had). i sauteed everything in olive oil instead of bacon grease to be a little more healthy. served it with mashed potatoes. i would definitely make it again. the mixture of beans, tomatoes, and bacon was yummy!

I love one pot meals and this is a keeper. You can basically toss in whatever fresh ingredients you have as well...I used fresh cherry tomatoes and added garlic, mushrooms and some thyme which helped the dish I thought. I agree some white wine would be a nice addition as well. I used leg thigh quarters and so needed to saute a bit longer. All in all delicious.

I've made this recipe several times, and it was well received. I use diced instead of stewed tomatoes. Keep in mind it takes longer to render the fat off the bacon than you may think. An easy and surprisingly tasty recipe!

Any time you can cook in bacon grease, you are bound to have a wonderful meal. This was a very easy, one pot meal. I made it as Rx'ed and didn't change a thing to it. Next time I may try a little wine and garlic. I may even add in a few mushrooms and some herbs for a bit of a rustic taste...

Rating: 3
Excellent and easy and fast. Added a bit of a fruity reisling and boiled it down (at the same time as the tomatoes) and then a touch of rosemary about five minutes before taking out of the oven. Used organic boneless breasts so kept it in for 20 and it didn't dry out. I might suggest really covering the chicken in the bean/tomato/onion mix.

2 onions seems a bit much but other than that, this one's a winner. I had some extra roasted garlic which I added along with a little chicken stock with the tomatoes, since the tomatoes (Hunt's) didn't have much juice.

Great, very easy. This dish was a huge hit with friends. Made it for an impromptu dinner party. I doubled the recipe using thighs, drumsticks and chicken breasts, based on pantry contents used one can of diced tomatoes and one can of stewed. Also added some chopped fresh sage near the end of cooking time. Will definitely make this again

i have now made this recipe almost 10 times. the basic recipe is great. but as i said before, it benefits greatly from the herbs of your choice. it also benefits from the addition of carrots and celery sauteed with the onion. lastly, i am considered by my friends to be an excellent home chef and the time it takes from start to finish is more like an hour and a half.

1 pan simple, Contains 3 of the major man food groups (beans, bacon, meat). Added the garlic, and some fresh oregano from the garden. If you like this, try sauteed white beans in olive oil with bacon topped with a little Parmesan/ fresh basil. This was nice comfort food, definite 3 forker ( I save 4 for food nirvana)

Rating: 4
Delicious with a few minor modifications. I added 3-4 cloves of garlic to the onions and had fresh tomatoes from my garden so I chopped those and added some chicken broth as a sub for the stewed tomatoes. Also added rosemary and a dash of dried thyme to the tomatoe mixture and used pre-cooked real bacon bits instead of actual bacon so I had to cook everything in olive oil. It was terrific! Yummy and easy. I would have added another can of beans but my husband said it was perfect. Sprinkled fresh basil on before serving.

Rating: 3
I'm not sure if this is even the same recipe... I realized too late that the only beans I had were black. So I used those, and instead of stewed tomatoes, I used one can of Rotel and one can of chipotle diced tomatoes. I was hesitant to use the bacon, but my boyfriend insisted (and afterwards insisted that I was underestimating the flavor they added). I pounded out chicken breasts, added 4 cloves of pressed garlic, and baked for 25 minutes. Served with tortilla.

I have made this many times, and my husband and eleven year old son love it. I have never found it bland, but I always make it with the following modifications: I only use one can of beans, I add garlic and some dried rosemary with the onions, and I deglaze the pan with about a cup of red wine. I also usually use more bacon (I just can't help myself), but I pour off some of the fat.Oh, and I always just use boneless, skinless chicken breasts; once you pile the beans and tomatoes on top, you never miss the extra fat. It cuts down on the cooking time, too.

The recipe looked a bit bland so I followed the advice of another reviewer. Add just a few things did the trick, It was great. I was licking my fingers. I added 3 cloves of garlic to the onions along with 1 teaspoon dried tarragon. Once I added the stewed tomatoes, beans and bacon I also added about ¾-1 cup chicken stock. Brought it all up to a boil, put the top on let it simmer for 20 minutes. Then followed the recipe again.

This is one of my staple recipes; my husband and I both love it. I'm shocked that there are people who don't like it, but to each his own. Like another reviewer, I'm wondering if those who found it bland used regular canned tomatoes instead of stewed, which would really take away from this dish, in my opinion. I add about a cup of chicken broth or stock, whatever I have. This last batch I made with leeks instead of onions (because I had them and wanted to use them up!) and served it with some soft, cheesy polenta amd steamed buttered broccoli. Yum! I usually use boneless, skinless thighs. I also use more beans than called for. I definitely plan to try it using both the pancetta and the wine, and maybe the garlic, too - we use garlic A LOT - so one of the beauties of this recipe was that it could be omitted and still have tons of flavor. Fast, easy, but I think the real beauty of this dish is the LEFTOVERS! Like most stews/casseroles, it's even better after it's sat for a while!

Really great flavors and not hard to make. I used bone in chicken breasts, which took closer to 40 mins to cook. I also incorporated several suggested changes, i.e.: 1) pancetta instead of bacon, 2) took the skin of half of the breasts to cut down on fat, 3) Added garlic to the onion saute, 4) Deglazed the onions with white wine, 5) Added 2 or 3 tbsp of chopped fresh rosemary before adding in the beans and bacon.

Rating: 4
Scrumptious is the word for this simple, mid-week meal. I added a couple of roughly chopped garlic cloves with the onion and chucked in a half-glass of white wine with the tomatoes. In future I will adapt this basic bacon/stewed tomato/white bean base to other main ingredients such as veal, pork and even monkfish. Throwing in some chopped fresh parsley, chives, coriander or basil (depending on your 'main' ingredient) just before serving would liven up the presentation. As for contorni ... just good, crusty rustic bread.

Love this recipe. Be sure to use the small white beans since the white kidneys don't produce the same affect. The pork fat really makes this dish what it is.

This dish was very good, but only after modifications. I added thinly sliced cloves of garlic while sauteeing the onions; and with the addition of the tomatoes and beans, about 1/2 cup or so of chicken broth, thyme and oregano. I broiled the chicken for the last few minutes of cooking to make the chicken skin crisp on top. I served the meal with whole grain egg noodles tossed with a little butter and a smidge of parmesan cheese. I think this would have been horribly bland w/out the modifications.

This was awesome. I followed others' recommendations and deglazed with a bit of Pinot Grigio I had on hand and added some rosemary and thyme with the garlic and onions. I also used turkey bacon and browned the chicken in about two tbsp of olive oil. The flavors were just great and it made me long for cold weather so I could hunker down with a bowlful! Not only will I bring the leftovers to work tomorrow to share with coworkers, but I'll definitely add this to my list of staple recipes. I think using stewed tomatoes is key - it really brought out the flavor.

I loved this dish. These were my substitutions/additions: Wellshire Farms Turkey Bacon (yum) instead of the pork bacon, a pound of ASH free "buffalo wings" instead of the thighs, added about a cup of mushrooms and two cloves of garlic to the sauteeing onions; used chopped tomatoes instead of stewed because that is what I had; added about a 1/2 T. honey and a generous splash of balsamic vinegar to the mixture, and a sprinkling of pepper flakes. Used both cans of beans. Baked about an hour. If anything, a bit salty, but very tasty. The chicken was browned and falling off the bone, and the bean/tomato/onion/mushroom mixture was rich and delicious.

So easy and SO delicious! I added some crushed garlic and just a pinch of thyme along with deglazing the onions with a bit of white wine, as others suggested. I also threw in one extra chicken breast half, along with the thighs. I thought 2 cans of beans would be too much, but it was not! Two cans were perfect. The flavor was huge and my husband loved it. (I find that frying the bacon in whole strips first, then draining and chopping...is much easier for me than frying small cut-up bacon.) I'm wondering if those who didn't like this recipe were using regular tomatoes instead of stewed, which have much more flavor. This is a keeper recipe for me.

I made this recipe last night for guests and thought it was delicious. I more than doubled the chicken throwing in a few breasts for the white meat lovers and doubled everything else, except for the beans which following the advice of previous reviewers, I cut down to three cans. In addition, I deglazed the pan after browning the chicken with a cup of red wine and added some garlic, fresh rosemary and thyme to the onion saute mixture. I also added some chopped escarole to the whole bean mixture before baking. I had to bake it longer than recipe calls for due to the extra chicken and the thickness of the breasts, but overall it was a simple recipe and all thought the results were great. I would definitely make this again!

I made this the other night for the first time and did add a little spice (a dash of crushed red pepper and some herbs de provence to the onions and garlic -- oh, yeah, also some garlic) and a splash of wine to deglaze the pan (makes clean up easier too, and I had a glass in hand). But really, I didn't change the recipe much and it was really easy and fast and quite delicious. Glad I bought some dinner rolls to soak up the sauce, because it was yummy.

I found this only so-so despite using good quality ingredients and paying careful attention to developing the flavors (browning the chicken well and deglazing the pan to get the fond). The chicken was tender and the dish looked & smelled good, it was just kind of blah. I had even added garlic, oregano, and basil during cooking to boost the flavor, as per the suggestions of other reviewers. On the plus side, three small children enjoyed it and cleaned their plates without much coaxing. Overall, this is a pleasant use for chicken thighs but not a dish that really whets the appetite.

Good winter dish. As I was making it I kept thinking "I'm not putting any herbs or spices in this, how is it going to taste good?" But it did and was very flavorful.

This was a wonderful dish. I used both boneless and skinnless thighs and breasts, and both were moist and full of flavor. I added 3 cloves of minced garlic, some dried oregano and tyme with the onions, and deglazed the pan with about 1 cup of good red wine after the onions and garlic were cooked, then followed the recipe from there. I think the added steps made a simple dish better. Thanks to those who made the suggestions from earlier reviews. I also let it cook a little longer than 25 minutes. I will make again and again.

This dish was easy to prepare and delicious. I added fresh parsley. I used a 28 oz can of Muir Glen fire roasted tomatoes instead of the 14 oz stewed tomatoes. I did not add salt other than to the chicken. You need to be very careful because bacon can have alot of salt and canned tomatoes can have alot of salt. Don't ruin the dish by adding 1/4 tsp of salt to the sauce. I grated some fresh parmesiano reggiano cheese into the sauce. I used one can cannellini and one navy bean. EXCELLENT bean combination. You can serve it over angel hair pasta if you use the larger can of tomatoes. If you have extra time leave it in the oven to create a richer stew.

Using the epicurious guide, I'm rating the dish "just so-so". Have a hard time believing anyone could rate this "a dish beyond compare" but I guess it's a matter of personal taste. Also, rewarding high fork ratings seems to happen a lot on this site. Perhaps a little restraint is in order? The beans were great, but what's not to like about bacon and beans. The chicken was just browned and baked chicken, so uninspiring that there were a lot of leftovers that were thrown out a few days later.

Because I used 2 big chicken breasts w/ the bone in, I wanted to be sure they were cooked through so used a meat thermometer which exploded! There were little pieces of glass all over, so couldn't really dig in, but tasted some of the meat and the beans and boy was it tasty. Also, I didn't have red wine on hand so at the last minute decided to add nearly a whone additional can of tomatoes at the last minute. My boyfriend always likes extra sauce on everything, and chicken breasts can be dry, so figured it couldn't hurt. Still came out well. I'd add more tomato or some liquid regardless- there seem to be a lot of beans for not that much sauce if you don't.

A delicious, fast, and inexpensive dish to prepare. There is no need to change a thing about the recipe. My whole family loved it, which is saying a lot. There is a great depth of flavor for so few ingredients.

I made this dish with great anticipation after the rave reviews. It was truly wonderful. I followed the suggestions of the many reviewers and added red wine and garlic. I wondered about using pancetta but wasn't sure if it would provide enough drippings. THe previous reviewer did and loved it. Will have to try next time. This is a new favorite and will be added to the rotation of recipes! Great dinner for cold New England evenings!

I have made this recipe a few times, adding garlic and redwine to add additional flavor. I also tried to make it with bone in chicken breast, but it does not taste as good. This is a great final one dish recipe for a cold winter night. My family and freinds loved it!

Yes, this is an excellent dish. I added garlic and used organic canned white beans but the best thing I did was substitute pancetta for bacon. It added a whole new level of flavor to this dish.

This is such a great meal. I took another cooks idea and added sherry and garlic. Right before I put it in the oven I also added fresh green beans in 1" pieces. It was wonderful! I servrd it with crusty bread and a yummy green salad. Everyone ate it even the kids! The best part is that it was a snap to make.

This dish turned out fantastic! I used two different kinds of white beans, and also added a splash of white wine and about 1 cup of cream of tomato soup that I had leftover. It thoroughly rocked! Will certainly make this one again. It tasted to me a bit like casoulet; nice and rich, but very easy to make.

Very good and simple to make. My teenage boys and their buddies devoured it. I didn't have white beans so used one can of red beans and one can of garbanzo beans. Really yummy!

Wonderful recipe. As others suggested, I added a couple cloves of garlic, a sprig of fresh rosemary and a splash of red wine. My husband AND 3 year old loved it! Nice enough for company, easy enough for a weeknight. Thanks Gourmet!

OMG - yummy comfort food to the max! Must admit I was a little doubtful that it could be so good.....made it last night using rather large skinless boneless chicken breasts.....added some garlic, thyme, a few other spices and sherry....How awesome. This is a definite keeper that I'll be making for years.....so easy to prepare, could be a meal for company, especially during the week....some nice crusty bread a bottle of wine.....I want to go home and have the leftovers now.

Surprisingly good. I added some fresh sage and it was really delicious.

Even with all of the positive reviews, I was skeptical... How could such a simple recipe be THAT good? Well, it was! The only changes I made were to add garlic and I used chicken breasts instead of thighs. Will most definitely make this again.

Very good! I used 5 boneless, skinless breasts, added Italian Seasoning, garlic and some parsely at the end. Very fast and tasty!

Agree that there is little need for the second can of beans. This dish was excellent and pretty easy. Great weeknight meal with lots of leftovers.

FABULOUS and quite simple. 0ne of can of beans might be sufficient (particularly if that's you have on hand). I added 3 cloves of garlic and at least a tsp of dried thyme once the onions were done. After 20 mins I cranked the heat up to 400 degrees for 10 mins, then back down to 250 to hold until hubby was home - i think the extra time in the oven really helped the flavors meld. Also Farmland bacon is the BEST for cooking.

Delicious and easy...it's not unlike the chicken and white bean stew recipe from an earlier Bon Appetit. Both are quite tasty, although this one has fewer ingredients.

What a great, easy, weeknight meal! I doubled the recipe and froze half in a freezer bag before baking. I used a combination of chicken breasts and thighs. I also added garlic, dried thyme and a bit of chicken stock.

This was a tasty, very simple dish. I took other cooks' advice and added red wine and garlic. I also used bone-in chicken breasts. I'll definitely make this again. (It's especially nice to find a good entree that only uses one pan!)

Nice winter dish. Next time I will use chicken breasts on the bone instead of thighs.

We enjoyed this. I will make again.

This dish was very easy to make. I used 5 brothers 4 cheese pasta sauce instead of the can of tomatoes. Everything turned out very delicious. I agree garlic adds more flavor here so I added some. Overall, this recipe is awesome and is easy to make.

Lovely entree! I needed an easy dinner tonight and this was perfect...I did add 2 cloves garlic, crushed, and about 1/3 cup dry red wine. Oh, and don't forget the fresh chopped parsley at the end and/or after you plate it...nice colors!

We enjoyed this and I agree that garlic would make a nice addition.

I agree that this receipe can be greatly improved by adding the following: Add 2-3 cloves of chopped garlic along with a tablespoon of fresh minced rosemary (or a teaspoon of dried, crumbled) a couple of minutes after starting to fry the onions. After adding the beans, add a cup of low-salt chicken broth (Swansons is best!) and simmer for one hour, covered, to allow beans to soften and the flavors to meld. Then add chicken as the recipe states. This produced a kind of "chicken cassoulet" that's yummy. I served it with steamed haricots verts.

This is a good recipe, but very basic. If you really want to make this dish sing and dance, add some persillade (chopped garlic minced with flat-leaf parsley), grated lemon rind, and one or two minced anchovy fillet before it goes in the oven

I was suprised at how good this was. I made as written, except removed the skin from the thighs. Also, one medium onion was enough for the recipe's 1 & 1/2 cup. I used great northern beans. I will try with turkey bacon next time to make it lower in fat, but would recommend you make it with real bacon the first time. The smokey flavor from the bacon was pretty important to the overall taste.

I should note that I also added two cloves of garlic to the onions as it cooked, also.

This is a good weeknight recipe. It's easy to prepare and you can use what you've got in the pantry and freezer. I used chicken breasts on the bone as well as the thighs, and they came out fine. (I worried they would get too dry.) I added some thyme and bay leaf while I was cooking, and a couple of extra cranks of fresh black pepper before serving.

My family loved this dish, even the kids. The flavors blended very well. Will make this again.
