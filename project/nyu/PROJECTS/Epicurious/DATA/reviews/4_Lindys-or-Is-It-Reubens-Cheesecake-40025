I'm not sure if this is an accurate Lindy's recipe. My Great Aunt worked at Lindy's for a long time (our whole family is from Brooklyn) & her copy is very different, the version here seems a little lighter & a little smaller & the crust is treated different. The copy of the recipe in our family also has a pineapple glaze (which I never make  too 1950s with canned fruit & food coloring). Im no cooking historian & I suppose either version could have been altered over the years. Differences: Crust uses only 1/4C butter. It is rolled out into the bottom & the bottom is baked. Than the spring form pan is assembled. Roll out 3 wide strips of the crust between waxed paper & side the spring form pan (dont bake again). Filling: 5pkg Cream cheese, 1-3/4C Sugar, 3TblSpn flour, 5 Eggs plus 2 Egg yolk, 2tsp Lemon rind & 1-1/2tsp Orange rind, 1/2tsp Vanilla, and 1/4C Heavy cream. Blend Cheese, Sugar, Flour, Vanilla & Rinds with electric mixer. Beat in Eggs & Yolk one at a time (!). Beat in Cream. Bake at 450 for 10 mins & 1 hr at 200 (some times I have to bake little longer) Ive tried to speed it up by plopping more than one egg at a time & the final cake can taste a little eggie in places, I recommend the extra effort of beating each egg separately. My family has been making this version since before I was born!

Second: You'll definitely want to pre-bake the bottom shortbread crust or it'll be raw but the sides do fine baked along with the filling. I used about half the dough for the bottom crust and baked it at 450 about 10 minutes to a barely golden color. I refrigerated it briefly, pressed the remaining dough up the sides, then held the crust in the fridge while I prepared the filling. The shortbread dough makes a delicate, easy-to-cut crust which really allows the filling to shine. I'd always used a thick, graham cracker crust before this, but I believe I'm a convert. Third: Use a 9 inch springform and the filling will reach almost to the top. It rises very little during baking, though, so you won't need a larger pan. I did get two small parallel cracks as the cake baked but they didn't detract from its appearance and certainly didn't compromise the flavor. Fourth: I turned down the oven temperature from 450 to 200 right after I put in the cheesecake and baked it for about an hour and a half in my rather slow electric oven. Then I turned off the oven and let the cheesecake sit inside for another two hours while the oven cooled off. To unmold: Once the cheesecake is cool carefully run a long thin knife around the sides so they don't stick to the pan as the butter in the crust hardens up in the refrigerator, but don't release the sides til shortly before you'll be serving. That way you can store the cake in the refrigerator still safely protected by its pan and covered with aluminum foil. It cuts and serves best straight from the fridge. Fifth: This cheesecake doesn't need a topping but I couldn't resist wretched excess. I made both a lemon curd and a sour cherry sauce and served them on the side. My guests were gleeful. Have fun with this-but be prepared to be the designated cheesecake baker for ever and ever after!

I've baked cheesecakes for many years and this is one of the very best I've ever made. I've got lots to say about it so I'll make two entries to cover it all. This cheesecake is very rich but also very light and the crust is a delectable shortbread. If you've never made a cheesecake before make this one. And if you have made a cheesecake before-make this one! The tips provided by Heidi from Bethel, Linda from Phoenix and A Cook (12/20/03) are extremely helpful and well thought out so follow their suggestions for best results. My thanks to them. I'd summarize their tips and add my own as follows: First: You do want a large cake, Lindy's/Reuben's should be huge, so do use those 5 packages of cream cheese, etc. as listed in the comments. I followed Heidi of Bethel's version. I don't think it much matters whether you use five eggs or six, a half cup of heavy cream or a quarter, one yolk or two, just be consistent as to which version of the recipe you use. I didn't use zest in the crust because I wanted the vanilla flavor to predominate but that's a matter of taste, do what you like best. A microplane grater makes tiny rind bits which don't interfere with the smoothness of the filling, so use one. And please, use a mixer, forget about beating the cream cheese with a wooden spoon-no one needs to work that hard! Don't worry about leftovers from this large cake because it lasts perfectly in the refrigerator and even freezes well. We were enjoying it as much a week later as we did when first served. Make it three days before you want to serve it for richest taste.

I have been making this for 4 years now. It is my standard cheesecake. Even when I stray and make another.. I always use the cookie crust. I omitt the orange rind as my family does not care for it.

This cheesecake was absolutely delicious! I follwed the suggestions from the cook in Bethell, CT and the advice was right-on. My cheescake needed a bit more time in the oven but all ovens vary. The one ingredient I forgot to add was vanilla but the cheesecake did not lack in flavor. The zests are not overwhelming and a little zing. For best flavor, let the cheesecake sit all day or overnight in the fridge. The texture and flavor vastly improve. I will be making again.

I've made this many times. Everyone loves it - even people who have often said that they don't really like cheesecake. However, I've always used the additions suggested by Heidi Evans from Bethel, CT in her comment left on 05/05/01. I made it once without and it just seemed lacking!

Of course i would make this recipe again! i made a pecan crust that had less sugar and more flavor than the original and it turned out to be a hit with my family and friends. im now adapting the recipe to make mini cheesecakes to give my friends as gifts. The first time i made this recipe it was my first time ever making cheesecake and it turned out to be one of my signitures at parties and holidays.

This recipe for Lindy's Cheesecake is in the Time/Life Foods of the World, American Cooking: The Melting Pot cookbook. I've been making it for more than 30 years, and believe it is the best cheesecake I've ever had. The Time/Life cookbook includes a recipe for a strawberry topping, which is a perfect foil for the richness of the cheesecake.

This ruinous disaster of a recipe that never had any intention of being Lindy's or anything like cheesecake. and Yeah my mom was from Brooklyn and I grew up in New York. Even the help from all of the other unfortunates that tried to salvage this recipe- this did not work! We will call it "ruin my husbands birthday cake

Excellent. I just used the lemon zest. Also I made a topping of 2 cups sour cream with 1/4 cup sugar. Baked it in the oven until the sugar was melted. Cooled the cake again and decorated it with glazed strawberries.

I have made this recipe as written many times, always to rave reviews. The cooking time key is this: you MUST keep the oven at 475 until you put the whole cheesecake in it. When you read the recipe it seems like you should turn down the oven while the crust cools, but if you do that it will not be warm enough. The time in the recipe is based on the idea of the oven cooling down while the cake is in it. If you cool off the crust in the fridge you won't have to keep the oven hot that long. So finish the filling, pour it in and pop the cake in when your oven is at 475. Turn it down to 200 or 250 right away. Finally, after an hour, turn off the oven but don't open the door. Just leave the cake in there while it cools. More tips- use a food processor for the crust and you can dump it right in the pan, press it down, pop it in the fridge for 10 minutes while you make the filling. This is a big time saver. I use this recipe and crust as the base for all cheesecakes and vary the toppings. It is sooooo good, and pretty forgiving and easy.

I have a copy of the 50th anniversary issue of Gourmet. It has a recipe for Lindy's Cheesecake that is quite different than this and much better. It uses 2 1/2 pounds cream cheese, 1 3/4 cups sugar, 1 1/2 tsp each lemon and ornage zest, 5 whole eggs, 2 egg yolks and 1/2 cup heavy cream.

I think the previous review suggesting changes in this recipe is correct. There is something seriously wrong with the recipe as is.

Flavor is excellent but cooking time is way off. I added 15 minutes extra baking time and the center was still a little runny. Next time I will start with a hot oven and then reduce temperature.

I've been using the original recipe for years. I suggest these changes: CRUST: first pat dough 1/8" thick on bottom only of spring pan, and bake for 10 minutes at 450. Once cool, put the bottom back in the pan, and pat dough around the sides, connecting to the bottom, to about 1/2" below the top. DO NOT BAKE YET CAKE: Change ingredients to: 5 Packages cream cheese (Philly is the best) 1 1/2 C sugar 3 T flour 1 1/2 t grated lemon rind 1 t grated orange rind 6 eggs plus 1 egg yolk 1/4 C heavy cream Assemble as directed, pour in pan, and put into 450 oven for 10 minutes, then lower temp to 200 and continue baking for 1 hr 15 mins. (Like a pumkin pie) This makes a larger cake, and solves the problem of underbaking that seems prevalent with the recipe published! My mother grew up in Brooklyn, and this is the recipe that has been handed down, direct from Lindy's - or so we've been told!

This is by far the best cheesecake recipe I've ever tried. Also, it's very easy to make it low-carb for those of us who watch our sugar intake. Replace the sugar with Splenda and omit the crust, and there you have it. No one will be able to tell the difference. Also, one trick to keep any cheesecake from cracking.....put a pan of water in the oven beside the cheesecake as it bakes.

This was actually the first cheesecake I'd ever made. The cooking time was a problem. I had no way of knowing for sure when it was done. After 60 minutes it seemed quite runny in the center, so I turned off the oven and let the cake sit in there for another 30 minutes. That worked out just fine. The cake was perfect. Not too dense, not too light, just delicious.

For those who thought this recipe needs more time, It comes out beautiful with a commercial gas range, so I eould venture to say it could be any one of the following:1) The type of gas your using(low output) 2) Thermistat is not acurate or faulty 3) Oven seal needs replacing. Remember that electricity has a much slower recovery time. This translates to an average lower temperature as compared to gas.So if your using electricity you might want to increase your seting slighty or allow more time.If electric you might add 10-15 minutes. Also during peak hours electric Co.s tend to drop in voltage, This means less output(watts) due to voltage drop. Watts =Voltage X Amperage. Not all utility co.s give the same service. Some give miminal(105 volts) Others as high as 135 volts per line. For your Range this means 210-270 volts. A lot of difference in output and recovery!

It was so delicious - it just melts in your mouth. I've made it for friends, and got great reviews!

Very refreshing but found also that bake time needed to be increased another 10-15 min, also I would make it with a little less lemon rind, felt it left an aftertaste. I served it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.

This cake had a really nice flavor, but I think the cooking time is way off. Only 60 minutes at 200 degrees is definitely not enough.
