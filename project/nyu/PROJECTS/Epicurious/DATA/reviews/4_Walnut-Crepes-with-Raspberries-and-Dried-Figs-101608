GREAT! As written (w/ the exception of substituting unsweetened raspberries for their sweetened ones) it is delicious but quite fancy. For regular use we do these substitutions: leave out the vanilla bean and add a bit of vanilla just before serving; substitute any fruit finely chopped for the entire raspberry filling; substitute yogurt for crème fraîche etc.; use crepes w/out walnuts or sugar for savory crepes filled with grilled veggies, or cheese, or mushrooms

Loved this recipe! We made this for a Provence-themed supper club. Everyone loved it--the filling was delicious and the creme fraiche topping really made it. I also sprinkled some toasted chopped walnuts on top for a little extra crunch.

This recipe was alright, but not enough bang for the buck. Vanilla beans cost about $10 per bean in Massachusetts. That and the wine made for a pricey recipe. I thought the filling was a bit too rich, but my boyfriend loved it. He thought it had several layers, with the vanilla bean maybe adding extra texture. I'm not convinced. I think you might be able to substitute vanilla extract and save some money. Also, preparation took a lot of time--you have to make the crepe batter in advance and refrigerate over night, then another two hours to make the filling, cook the crepes and bake the whole thing.

Very easy to make- got rave reviews at our Christmas dinner party. Fun presentation -- shaped a bow-tie on the plate with a dollop of creme fraiche, raspberry and mint sprig at intersection of two crepes

Easy. Delicious. I've made this a few times. The batter (actually you can make the crepes ahead) & filling can be made ahead & assembled.
