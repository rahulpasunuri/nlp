I must admit that I was skeptical trying this recipe. It seemed too simple and the cook time seemed too little. Boy was I wrong! I followed the directions. Except used lemon zest from one lemon, didn't do the slices, and added some cherry tomatoes and cubed zucchini on top of the fish. It turned out great! I'm making it again tonight. The cook time is appropriate--if you cook fish too long it dries it out.

I've made this recipe several times now and I love it. It's super-easy and the fish cooks beautifully in the time specified.

My husband and I thought this was very nice. The recipe cooked the fish perfectly. A very simple, yet delicious, fish preparation.

My family didn't love it. I might have overcooked it as my fillets were 8oz and I allowed extra time.

I am not a great cook and hate clean-up. This recipe was quick and easy (except catching the fish!)

This is on my regular rotation as it is so easy. I shred zuchini, squash, and carrot and set fish on top. Can also add jalepeno and tomato for variation. Good w/ almost any fish.

I used parchment paper instead of foil for the pappillotes making a far more elegant presentation for company. In paper the fish needs 7 to 8 minutes to cook. I used a pungent fresh lemon thyme from the garden (cutting out the lemon juice) and used a very rich first press olive oil. It all came together to enhance the flavor of the fish. What a wonderful, simple and healthy way to impress guests.

This wasn't the best dish I've ever tasted. The blend of lemon and thyme was good but I wasn't moved. My dish turned out bitter so my bad first impression could have been due to something I did wrong. However, this was simple and healthy, so meh-

I would make it again - just to see if I could make it right. After 5 minutes the fish is still raw! The flavors had not blended in any way and I love lemon and thyme! The Red Snapper in Browned Butter and capers is far superior to this recipe - no comparison.

This is a great recipe, especially if you are a new cook or you aren't that comfortable cooking fish. The recipe is simple and steam cooking it in the papillotes really infuses all the flavors. Simple, but good. Make sure you use enough salt and pepper, and don't be afraid to use more fresh thyme if the filets are big.

Perfect Monday dinner after a weekend of over indulgence. Simple and impressive.
