Outstanding! I'm a finance and engineering guy who could have trouble cooking a frozen pizza. However, after choosing this recipe based on (1) Minimal ingredients; (2) Minimal and easy cooking steps; and (3) Minimal cost; I must say this was a hit with everyone, from my Italian wife to my 8 year old daughter. Strongly recommended.

Nice veggie recipe. I added a bit of ginger (thank you, Cook from Chicago, for your tip) - I also added a splash of soy sauce and served it over rice. As for the time it takes to prepare, the 45 minutes probably refers to the time it takes to wash, peel, slice/chop etc. as well as the few minutes it takes to cook the carrots. It did say CAN BE PREPARED IN 45 minutes or less.. As one who reads papers, please think about what you are reading.. read the WHOLE CONCEPT.

In the last 3 or 4 minutes, unless I'm mistaking, you sautee the carrots until the liguid reduces...it is always nice to add ginger and/or all-spice to the reduction for extra flavor.
