Excellent little salad...skipped the tomato as well. I used Blue Cheese crumbled instead. Making it again tonight with walnuts instead of pecans! Yes, this one is a keeper...everyone raved :)

Nothing special-tomatoes and cranberries together? Not a good mix-nuts could be sugared to give more flavor

I have made this salad many times, following the recipe exactly, and have always gotten rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I'm making it this weekend for a pot luck!

An elegant salad for a romantic evening dinner. Very good!

This one is excellent and gets 4 forks.It got good reviews at our Thanksgiving dinner. Use a blender for the dressing to prevent the cheese from clumping. Stick to the proportions for the dressing in the recipe and you will find that a little dressing goes a long way. The greens I used, (mostly spinach with some radicchio and chard), remained fresh and did not wilt after being tossed with the dressing, even after one night in the fridge nd the flavour was outstanding. Add the nuts and cranberries and some crumbled cheese after tossing the rest with dressing so as to prevent these goodies from descending to the bottom of the bowl. Great as lunch left-overs with turkey mixed in for protein. Ingrid Nickel, Winnipeg, Manitoba

I love this salad. The tomatoes must be perfect though. The tomatoes called for were not very good when I made this salad, but the small grape tomatoes were an excellent exchange.

This is a wonderful combination of flavors -- I used balsamic vinegar, and substituted red onion the second time. Makes an everyday dinner salad more interesting -- Roquefort is great in it.

I took this salad to a potluck dinner and it was the hit of the evening. I would definitely make it again, but I would leave out the tomatoes especially if they're not in season.

Dressing sounded boring so I added 2T white wine, 2T red wine vinager, 2 green onions (white part only), 1 1/2t dry mustard and 1/2t celery. Turned out great. I also added pumpkin spice and salt & pepper to the pecans while toasting.

Yummy. I swapped out the scallions for julienned red onion (prettier) and left out the dried cranberries completely (my husband hates them!). The dressing is great and the toasted pecans add the perfect crunch. My guests went back for seconds!

I made it for both Thanksgiving and X-mas, as is it is a very holiday salad, both with and without tomatoes. both were excellent. The quality of the cheese is very important.

I agree.. this salad is a winner! I also agree that the tomatoes aren't necessary and I substituted chopped red onion for the scallions. I don't really like the idea of adding mandarin oranges to this particular salad,and believe me, I add them to almost every salad. I feel mandarin oranges would add either an asian twist or a spring/summer feel to the dish and this feels like a fall/winter dish to me.This is an excellent salad and I will make it often.

I also changed a few things as a result of what was on hand. Did the dressing exactly as it was written but used Feta, walnuts, cranberries, mixed greens, and no tomatoes and it was a great salad.

Everyone loved it. I kept the tomatoes in! It was delicious! I used toasted pine nuts and walnuts instead of the pecans, it still turned out wonderfully.

Delicious and easy to prepare. I subsituted feta for roquefort because I'm not a fan. It was a hit at my party. I followed the advice of others and skipped the tomatoes. Definitely will make again.

MAKE THIS SALAD! Served it at a dinner party and it was the menu favorite. Use the raspberry vinegar and small grape tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes. Buy good Roquefort.

Slam Dunk!!! Made it several times. Strongly advise to skip the tomatoes... doesn't do anything but detract from dish. Served this to Georges Perrier (Best chef in the USA) from Le Bec Fin in PA. He couldn't stop rattling in French about how great it was...perfect find: local organic grocer (zagara's) offers dried raspberry flavored cranberries, PERFECT!!! Also, it's worth buying the cheese from a cheese store. it's not wasted.

My Husband liked this so much, he asked for a second salad! His favorite was the dried cranberries; mine the mandarin oranges (at the advise of others, I substituted mandarin oranges for the tomatoes). Also, I put the greens on the individual salad plates and sprinkled the rest of the toppings on top - including the crumbled cheese - then drizzled with the vinaigrette. Next time, I might try fresh raspberries instead of cranberries...

I thought this salad was amazing and was so easy. I received lots of compliments on this when I served it at a party. I couldn't stop eating it myself. This will definitely be showing up at future parties!

I've never served a green salad that made people lick and scrape the bottom of the bowl, but this is it! Everyone wanted the recipe. The only substitution I made was the Roquefort...had a hard time finding any so I used crumbled Mediterranean-style Feta. I also used the tiny sweet baby tomatoes. Great recipe!!

Rave reviews from a large group. I used raspberry vinegar and dried tart cherries in place of the cranberries (since I couldn't find unsweetened cranberries). A most excellent combination!

I had to make some revisions to your recipe due to ingredients on hand. Changed to regular tomatoes, thinly sliced red onions and bleu cheese. Otherwise, followed the recipe!!! It was a wonderful combination of flavors and textures. Definitely made a hit with my dinner guests. It's a keeper.

I changed this salad but it was great. I used mandarin oranges too and used apple balsamic vinegar. Was really great.

Excellent. I was sceptical about the tomatoes but didn't change a thing and it was brilliant. Easy, delicious and everyone wanted the recipe. Of course cheese will go soggy! Only make enough to go around. I used walnuts and danish blue (cheaper!) Thanks!

This salad was excellent! - I used the mandarin oranges, the raspberry vinegar (not balsamic), and Oceanspray Cranberries. Definitely a keeper

Excellent salad. I too substituted the tomatoes with mandarin oranges. I've served it three times now and have received raves about it. Even my mother-in-law wanted the recipe.

I agree with everyone else, no tomatoes... But I have to confess, I completely changed this recipe, instead of pecans, I added toasted walnut pieces, also added the mandarin slices, dried cherries, and I also used the raspberry balsamic vinaigrette (It could have used a little bit of olive oil, but I wanted to keep it low-fat, because I was serving this salad with a blue cheese/prosciutto/tomato pasta.) The entire dinner was delicious!

This is a wonderful salad. I agree to leave out the tomatoes. I used Ocean Spray Craisins (sweetened dried cranberries) and brown suger coated walnuts. I also used a raspberry balsamic vinegar. YUM........Perfect

I took the advice of the previous chef and substituted the tomaotes for some mandarin oranges - it was fantastic! I made it for some friends last night and it got raving reviews! I think the next time I may substitute the Blue Cheese for some Feta, as I had some left over today for lunch and the cheese was sort of soggy.

This is a wonderful salad, but better if another fruit (especially a segmented orange) is substituted for the tomatoes. Tomatoes don't work well with raspberries, in my book. Excellent dressing, and Roquefort makes almost anything better. A keeper!

I made this without the tomatoes, and I added mandarin oranges. Got rave reviews from everyone at the table - for a salad! Added extra cranberries, as someone else suggested, with extra raspberry vinegar. Would definitely make again!

I brought this to a Valentine's Day dinner party and everyone loved it. I forgot to add the tomatoes but they weren't missed. The cranberries added a nice touch of red. I plated the salads individually and it was a nice presentation with the pecans and cranberries on top of the greens and then the dressing over all. I thought it was an elegant and interesting and tasty first course.

A very delicious salad. I came across small "grape tomatoes" at the supermarket and substituted those for the tomatoes called for in the recipe. I cut them in half - the tomatoes were very sweet and delectable. A very nice substitution.

This is delicious and easy. I definitely agree to adding more cranberries, 2 extra tbsp of vinegar (I used raspberry), and plating the salads individually.

This was a very easy and flavorful salad. The addition of either dried cranberries or currants adds an interesting flavor. I used currants because I had them on hand.

i am so happy to have found this recipe again! my husband keeps asking me to make it for him and for the life of me i couldn't remember which issue it was in... so happy about the search function of this website!!

This has been a sure hit each time I have made it. I have added the extra 2 tablespoons of vinegar as suggested along with extra cranberries. I have also tried it with rasberry balsamic vinegar which is quite good. This is an easy to make salad which is sure to win rave reviews.

This is great. However, omitting the tomatoes made this better the second time I made it. I agree that nore vinegar was necessary in the dressing. Also, plating the salads individually elimantes the "goodies on the bottom problem."

This salad is very good! I just added about 2 tablespoons more vinegar to the dressing than suggested and more dried cranberries. Served it at Easter dinner... everyone loved it. As already said, those who served themselves last got all the good stuff!

I got rave reviews from this salad. The contrast between the roquefort and the raspberry vinegar is what makes it good. Also, the nuts and the dried cherries (the good stuff) tend to congregate at the bottom of the bowl, so those who got to the salad last were the most pleased.
