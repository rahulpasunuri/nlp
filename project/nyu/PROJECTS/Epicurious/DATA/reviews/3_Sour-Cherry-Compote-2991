This was wonderfully delicious and easy to make (I used it over cheesecake). Rather than using fresh cherries, I used pitted frozen cherries, which contained a little natural cherry juice. The cherry flavor was very pronounced, perhaps for that reason. I will make this again!

This was OK, but we thought we'd try it with blackberries next time, as they go so well with ginger. Not a strong cherry flavor, and compote as whole was overwhelmed by the ginger in the cheesecake (which was amazingly good!). This would be fine but unremarkable over ice cream or a plain cheesecake.

A medley of aromatic delight! This compote is easy to make and delicious. Tantalizing with the ginger cheesecake or without-could easily double as an ice cream sauce. I used canned cherries and the recipe turned out just fine.
