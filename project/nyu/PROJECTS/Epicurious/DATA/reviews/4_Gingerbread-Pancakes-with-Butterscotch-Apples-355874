Absolutely wonderful. My husband couldn't wait to try these. Perfect for Christmas brunch. I used Red Delicious apples - not overly sweet - I like that.

I thought these were tough. The topping was good, but there are better gingerbread pancakes out there. Also, the batter does not make enough for four people. I would double or triple it if I made it again.

These pancakes are delicious and definitely dessert-like! I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the result. My family loved these as part of our Christmas brunch.

My wife still remembers these when I made them a few years ago. I've never heard of gingerbread pancakes and it seemed like it would be fun for Valentine's Day. I'm going to make them again today for Valentine's Day. She never stops talking about how good they were. Signed up on epicurious today just so I could give this recipe some praise.

These are so good. Next time I would decrease the amount of ginger - it was a bit too spicy for our taste - but will definitely be making these again!

I really hate it when people say nasty things about macIntosh apples. I admit the best :Macs" are from New England, and they are my absolute favorite apple!!!
