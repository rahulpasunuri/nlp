These were pretty easy to make. My husband and I didn't care for how these tasted but our friends really liked them.

oops--I meant one guest dislikes black pepper

totally disagree with previous poster--likely used eggs that were too large. If the dough was runny, that would be the issue. It's pretty obvious they have to hold their shape. The proportions for gougeres is correct. I have been making them for twenty years. "The fault, dear Brutus, is in ourselves" I used white pepper because one guest dislikes it (huh?) it they were incredible. My cheese was smoked blue (Stella Brand) Other than that, no changes and right on the money for rich flavor and texture--a bit crisp with soft, chewy interiors. Making more today form a major wine tasting...

I made this recipe twice. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a failure. For the basic choux pastry, 3 eggs are way too much for the amout of butter and flour called for. The resulting dough was so liquid that I couldn't brush egg was on it. The added salt + the cheese also made the gougeres too salty. The 2nd time I made this, I ommitted the salt, and reduced the amount of pepper to 1/4 tsp. The balance of flavours was just right. I also looked up the proportions for a proper choux pastry, and subsequently reduced the number of eggs from 3 to 2. The gougeres had the correct consistency and turned out beautifully. Colleagues said it was some of the best 'cheese puffs' they'd ever had!

Made these a day ahead for my book group and they came together beautifully. However, they taste terrible. Most stayed on the plate and a few guests could not even finish them. We really like our food but not this recipe.

Very easy to make and went a long way in impressing some guests who dropped in! I made them with egg beaters and gorgonzola cheese, a lot of pepper, and whipped up some butter with aguave necter. The sweetness of the butter with the tangy gorgonzola puffs were amazing! Will make again with blue cheese for sure..would think of adding chives/bacon..possibilities are endless!

Great recipe to impress holiday drop ins with. I took the advice, made them ahead and kept them in the freezer. They heated up beautifully and saved the day!

These were fun to make - and easy. They had really great flavor. I made them 6 hours ahead and reheated and while they weren't quite as good as fresh from the oven, they were still enjoyable. My guests thought I went to a lot of trouble!

These turned out well. They do not need to be perfectly hollow as they are not being filled with anything. Mine turned out mostly hollow, golden on the outside (egg wash was helpful), and had a good texture. People really enjoyed them. Such an easy recipe - I might explore using other cheeses in the future.

These were pretty good, but nothing extraordinary. I doubled the blue cheese becuase other people said that the puffs were bland, and I'm glad that I did. The egg wash makes the puffs brown quickly, but if you're going to take them out, make sure that they're really done (I undercooked mine). They really should sound hollow the way the recipe says that they should. Also, do not open your oven until you're sure that they're pretty much fully cooked, or they won't rise properly.

Easy yet sophisticated and delicious. Peppery with subtle blue cheese flavor.I will absolutely make again.

These delicious puffs were a huge hit and were gobbled up by four people. I made them exactly as written (with just a few grinds of pepper, not 3/4 tsp.). They were very impressive but easy to make. I served them alongside caesar salad, foregoing the croutons. I would certainly make them again.

I'm not sure if this is a fair review so I hope others try it and see what they think. They just weren't what I had expected (although I can't say for certain what I expected). I was going to make them for a party so I tried the recipe a few days before, not sure if I was tired, but I wasn't super impressed. I do agree that they were very subtle in flavor. Maybe I was expecting more blue cheese flavor. On the plus side, they were so easy to make that I will definitely give them another chance.

Easy to make. Subtle in flavor. Mine were, however, more tablespoon than teaspoon sized. Definitely better fresh from the oven, though the first batch had to be reheated and the family thought they were just fine!
