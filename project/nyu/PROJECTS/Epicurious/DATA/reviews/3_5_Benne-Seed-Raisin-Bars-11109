I only used half the sugar called for, since the raisins are already sweet. The result was so yummy that my husband kept sneaking more onto his plate.

It took a little while, but they set as they cooled. If you like halva, you'll almost certainly like this.

Protein, high quality carbs and half a pound of butter! What more can you ask for?! Rich and buttery and a great way to use up some leftover tahini.

For a recipe that has been here so long and is so good I'm surprised I am the first to review it! I had some tahini I didn't know what to do with and found these cookies! Very very good!
