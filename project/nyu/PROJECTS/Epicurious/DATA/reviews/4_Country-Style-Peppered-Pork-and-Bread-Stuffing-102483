I used this recipe to stuff pork chops for grilling. I omitted the ground pork and nutmeg, and added 1/2c. of chicken stock for moisture. Excellent!

The only reason I gave this 2 forks is because my husband liked it..and I think he liked it because I topped the stuffing on the plate with turkey gravy. This stuffing was EXTREMELY dry. If I were to make it again, I would add SOMETHING to make it less dry...perhaps more broth before putting it in the oven??

I've made this 3 years in a row, and this year will make 4. Everyone loves it.

Absolutely delicious. The family loved it. I have never made bread stuffing before, I have always used packet stuffing mixes but since making this recipe I will always use it.

I followed the menu to the tee and the dish turned out beautifully. However, it appears that the supermarket does not ground pork so luckily I had a food grinder which I used for grinding.

AMAZING, but with one change. Next time I will brown the pork separately to get a nice brown color.

This has become my traditional stuffing. If you are rushed for time and can't toast the bread, the rest of the ingredients mix great with a store brand stuffing mix. Works just as good if you are in a pinch.

This is my standard stuffing recipe. Everyone really enjoys it. I use turkey stock instead of chicken broth and plenty of it. I don't believe that I have had a better stuffing.

This is a great, classic stuffing recipe. I baked my own bread (a highly seasoned "stuffing bread" with plenty of sage, garlic, cornmeal and oatmeal for texture). The seasonings can be adjusted up for more flavor. Went very well with the sage/caramelized onion roasted turkey!
