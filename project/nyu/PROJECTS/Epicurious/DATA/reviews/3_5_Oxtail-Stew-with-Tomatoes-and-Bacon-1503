I used olive oil instead of bacon grease and this turned out to be a very tasty stew. The only problem was the oxtail which was very difficult to eat and is too gristley for my taste. I will definitely make this again but I will use a different cut of meat.

While I loved the flavors in this recipe, dealing with the oxtails was a real pain and I don't think the flavor was any better than a regular chuck pot roast. In fact, I made this recipe again and substituted the chuck and it tasted the same.

Great recipe - relatively easy and made a wonderful sauce/gravy. Didn't quite like the texture/taste of the snap peas - my family thought potatoes or carrots would be better in this dish for next time. Tasted even better the next day.

I've got nothing intrinsically against this recipe, but it just doesn't seem the most interesting/best use of oxtails. If I wanted a savory stew like this one, I'd make beef paprika and be much more satisfied.

Enjoyed making this dish as it was straightforward and simple. A small portion is quite filling, so it's relatively economical (oxtails at my grocery costs more than regular cuts of meat...and I couldn't find neck bones). This dish tastes much better than any restaurant version, even though it was a wee bit heavy on the tomato flavor.

Wonderful dish! I've made it several times and it just gets better every time.

Nice. Unless you're using slab bacon w/lots o' fat, you'll need to supplement when you brown. (Veg oil is fine; olive in moderation.) Braise forever. Remember that you shouldn't cook with wine you wouldn't drink, so no skimping. Serve over rice (white, or brown) or flat noodles. And fresh rosemary is *much* better than dried.

Incredible depth of flavor. I simmered it for five hours till the meat fell apart.

Great dish! The bacon that we used did not give enough fat to cook the entire batch of oxtails so we had to add some more oil. We love it! My brother loved it so much that he mopped up ALL the leftovers.

Awesome, rich and quite filling. The Red Cabernet really gives it body. If you prefer it a bit lighter you might want to consider a Merlot. Also I found it a bit acidic by the next day so you might want to add a tablespoon of sugar. The only other things I did differently in my version was to blanch the Sugar Snap Peas rather than cook them in the stew. Which really differentiated the two flavours. Also I let it cool and skimmed the fat then reheated it before serving. This entire meal was a big hit! Did I say Awesome?

Yummy!!!! You'd be crazy if you didn't treat yourself to treat yourself to this recipe...I can't wait to make it again. Wait, I'll make it tonight. Enjoy!

I quite often cook oxtails, but as they can be very fatty, I usually pressure-cook them for an hour first (with pan half filled with water, a bayleaf and some peppercorns) strain the contents, leave the stock to chill then scrape off the fat - there is a lot of this! Then I take the meat off the bones and make the stew with the rich stock and add the other ingredients at this point. No loss of flavour at all, and kinder to the heart.

This is a wonderful dish. I served it with garlic mash potatoes. Very tasty. I omited the peas and added more wine and garlic. Suberb!

I really liked this. It has a strong flavor just as oxtail soup should. A good winter dish.

This is a rewarding and hearty dish which does take a bit of preparation and cooking time so plan ahead. The taste is not an extremely sophisticated one so the results are pretty fool proof. Makes you wonder why restaurants charge so much for the identical product.

If you love braising, you'll love this. If you have trouble getting oxtails, beef short ribs work great. I like serving the sugar snaps on the side.

This is a fabulous recipe, perhaps the most requested by my extended family. I tend to increase the proportion of sugar snap peas, which are a wonderful addition given the richness of the recipe. Perfect for rainy Northwest winter days!

I have a friend who *loves* oxtail stew. She rates this (as do I) the best version she ever tasted. I make it every year for her as her only requested birthday present! I also make it for ourselves at other times.
