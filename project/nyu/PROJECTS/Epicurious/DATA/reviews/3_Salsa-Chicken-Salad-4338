Just made this tonight with my own salsa. Added shredded cheddar and mozarella, and served in flour tortillas. Very nice, yes a bit rich with the mayo. Pretty easy and quick to prepare too.

We tried this for the first time as lunch. The chicken was poached, shredded, and chilled the day before. We just used it as a topper on lettuce and cucumber with some sweet corn mixed in. Didn't use an avocado like the recipe says because of the fat content. Yes, this one will become part of our usual salad rotation. Perhaps next time I'll slice a mango and place it under the salad mix.

This was delicious - and so easy! I served it as a wrap - filled a tortilla with the chicken salad, sliced yellow peppers and avocado. It was great!

I really did'nt like this one, I love chicken and salads, and mexican, but it was not too good to me. I thought salsa and mayo sounded gross, so I used low fat sour cream instead. Except for that I followed it exactly as listed.

This recipe gives a kick to the traditional chicken salad. I made it the night before and used it for sandwiches. Yummy! Definately a keeper!

This is so-o-o-o-o good and amazingly simple to prepare. I just processored the mayo, salsa, cilantro, then added shredded chicken (I used leftover supermarket rotisserie chicken). A must try. Will be on my all-time favorites list for taste and ease of preparation.
