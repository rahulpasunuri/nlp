Oh my gosh! Why didn't I ever think of this? I had quite a bit of leftover pork loin which I used for this recipe. It was quick and easy to prepare -- amazingly so. The result was very tasty -- kind of a manicotti enchilada (only much much easier than either of those). I used slightly more of the cheeses and the sauce. I will certainly make this recipe again. I'd be willing to give it another fork just because it was so easy! Thank you!

We regularly make enchiladas of leftovers this way: corn tortilla rather than wheat, rolled around a mix of whatever leftover meat, + rice, a few sauteed vegetables (mushroom, zucchini, peppers), grated cheese. Place rolls side by side in a 9x13 pan, smother in store-bought enchilada sauce and on top more cheese. Bake until bubbling. Serve with sour cream, salsa, etc.

Some of the simplest recipes are the best!! This has been one of my staples for many years with a million variations...whatever is leftover in the 'frig. A flour tortilla that has been grilled over a open flame is the best base for anything you would put on bread or a bun!! ...I eat my salad wrapped in a tortilla, a good grilled sausage/kraut/mustard is the best, gouda/Swiss cheese melted on a tortilla and then wrapped with grilled vegetables, and...peanut butter and jelly!! Go for it!!

This recipe is a weekly staple in our home. Being a cajun cook, I don't think I would wrap gumbo in a tortilla, but any leftover meat is great. I also like using refried beans with whatever meat I use. Enchilada sauce is what I use most, either canned or homemade. We also like a variety of cheeses and sour cream. Of course the calories are kind of high, but my kinds love this recipe and make it themselves.

We live in Arizona and use a lot of enchilada recipes. We also have a 96 year old grandmother living with us who can't take to many spiced dishes. This was perfect for all of us, a good spaghetti sauce is important and what a good way to use leftover roasted meats. We love the green onion and cilantro garnishes. What a great new dish to add to our menus.

This is a great recipe that I have used for years. I make it with boiled or roasted chicken breasts or leftover chicken or turkey. I use salsa, homemede or from a jar, instead of pasta sauce and sour cream or low fat yogurt instead of ricotta. Most importantly I roast the the tortillas before I put the filling in - either put them directly onto a full-on gas burner for a few seconds each side (flip with tongs) or on a dry fryng pan on medium heat.

I just wanted to say I have not tried this recipe yet but in response to the first review.... Don't have a closed mind. The ingrediants listed in this recipe are very normal ingrediants. She isn't saying to use them all together at the same time. When I try this recipe though I won't use a pasta sauce but instead I will use mild Totinos salsa in the recipe and I might put colby jack cheese in it instead of ricotta. This is a very versitile recipe and it seems it can work several different ways. Don't listen to the first review.......give it a try, make it your own way. :o)
