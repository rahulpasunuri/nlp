So easy and fast to make. I substituted Southern Comfort for the scotch to add an extra bit of orange flavor. Follow the part about soaking the fruit for no more than an hour, however -- I left the extra fruit sitting in the syrup overnight and it wasn't as good the second day.

You really can't go wrong with this recipe using almost any fruit combination. The last time we used some frozen rhubarb--WOW! It's always a big hit!!

The syrup isn't very syrupy, since the Scotch is not heated, but works well anyway. We used blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes and bits of other fruit. Everybody loved it; a great and quick way to dress up an angel food cake!
