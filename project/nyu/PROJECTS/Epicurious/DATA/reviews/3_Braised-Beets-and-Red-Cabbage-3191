I thought this was very good, and very attractive too. It makes quite a lot for a 2 person household but it keeps and reheats well.

I thought the vinegar overpowered most of the taste of the veggies; I softened the taste with the juice of half an orange, but next time will just add the vinegar gradually. A good side dish that requires strong flavors from accompanying food. Some side dishes can double as vegetarian main dishes. This isn't one of them.

Great combination! If you just braise red cabbage alone you'll end up with something which is blue/purple in color. The beets give it a delightful red color. When preparing the recipe I used a cup of white wine insted of balsamic vinegar and chicken stock instead of water. I also added some brown sugar to sweeten it. Everyone loved it.

Flavourless and boring. There are lots of better recipes for red cabbage. (Very healthful though)

I didn't have any onions and I used Barrel Red Cabbage instead of fresh and this was a wonderful side dish. My husband loved it. We grow our own red beets and it is difficult to find interesting red beet recipes. This is a keeper! I cooked the red beets without the cabbage since it was already cooked. Really good recipe!

I served this dish with poached salmon and a cucumber salad. The red ingredients in this recipe looked beautiful on the plate and added perfect texture and taste to the other two items on my menu. I also marinated yellow raisins in balsamic vinegar 2 hours prior to making and then added that to the pot when I added the beets. It was a perfect sweet and savory combo.
