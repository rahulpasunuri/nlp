I make several kinds of sweets over the holidays and this biscotti was the most popular. They were even eaten before the chocolate things I made! Got several requests for the recipe.

I love this little gem as a new take on a traditional biscotti recipe. Sliced super thin, these are addictive! My avid Italian Mother-in-Law and neighbor bakers all love how delicate yet crunchy these are. This is a keeper and something I look forward to making every Christmas..

I'm almost through my second batch in a row. These are relatively easy to make, light, crispy biscotti that really soak up whatever you dip them in without losing their crunch. Delicious. I added dried cranberries for Christmas color (if I do it again, I'd mince the dried cranberries) but tried it straight and liked it both ways.

Actually easy to make and low-fat! I used slivered almonds.

Worth the effort! Makes a lovely little treat with after dinner coffee or cup of afternoon tea.
