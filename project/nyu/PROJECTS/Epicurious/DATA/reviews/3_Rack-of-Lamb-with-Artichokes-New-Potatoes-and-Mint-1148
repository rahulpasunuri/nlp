I first made this when it was part of a Bon Appetite Valentine's Day menu and have made it regularly ever since. It always gets rave reviews. I like to have a little more of the crumb coating than is called for - the bits that fall away get very crispy and are delicious - I also like to use more pine nuts. If you don't have mint, you can omit it and the dish is still excellent. Very quick to put together and has always impressed the dinner guests!
