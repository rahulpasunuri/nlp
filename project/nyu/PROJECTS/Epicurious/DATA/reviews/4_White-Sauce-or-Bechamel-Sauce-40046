Oops, forgot a cup of mithra(sp?) cheese into the sauce.

AWESOMENESS! I've now made about four different variations on this sauce. My family's favorite . . . Cook shallots, garlic and onions in the butter. Not more than 1/3 cup total. Double the recipe here. Cook a pound of noodles - we did fusilli. Put noodles in a metal bowl. Top liberally with whole, fresh cherry tomatoes. Pour the sauce over the whole thing. Mix. Cover with a plate. You'll steam the tomatoes a bit. When the inside swells so the skin pops, serve.

I got this recipe from my Fannie Farmer cookbook years ago and use it all the time! My favorite: over a brunch of spicy roasted potatoes, and fried egg on an English muffin. And it's easy to modify by adding cheese at the end for an exciting veggie gratin. You'll use it so often you'll have it memorized in no time.

Finally a white sauce I didn't ruin! I think the key was warming the milk in the microwave like a few others suggested. I added garlic, parmesan, fresh sage, and a little cinnamon. I'm just pleased it came out smooth!

This was easy. I heated the milk glass measuring cup in the microwave so as to not create another dish. Success!

I have used the Fanny Farmer Basic White Sauce Recipe for over 40 years. It is easy and versatile. Great for Mac and Cheese, Basic White Sauce and for Creamed Chip Beef, etc. These days, I use 1% milk and it still comes out fine.

We made this sauce for a quick and easy "pot pie" weeknight meal. Spiced the sauce with white pepper and some dijon mustard, added some mixed veggies and rotisserie chicken and topped with buttered bread slices into the oven. The bread came out nicely toasted and the chicken/sauce misture was bubbling and very comforting.

Wow! My mom tried to teach me how to make this a long time ago, but it never turned out very well. This one turned out great without much effort at all! I added garlic, cayenne, lots of pepper, and lots of parmesan cheese... delicious and smooth! It is a little thick as others said so I might add a little more milk in the future to avoid that.

I have used this recipe for over 25 years. I never use another. It was in the cookbook I got as a shower gift from my aunt !It makes perfect macaroni cheese sauce.

My daughter is 16 and when she askes for macaroni and cheese this is what I make. It's perfect!

Very easy and delicious, I use this base all the time for cheese sauces. A great way to get the kids to eat vegetables. I usually sautee garlic in the butter before adding the flour, and I always add a 1/4 cup of dry sherry. It gives it a fantastic nutty flavour and adds extra liquid so it isn't as pasty. I also grate some fresh nutmeg in when I add the pepper. I don't use salt, I find the sharp cheese has enough. The kids are grown up and make this recipe for their own families now.

Classic, basic sauce; easy if you follow the instructions. A bit on the thick side, though -- you may want to add a few extra tablespoons of milk. Whisk vigorously as you incorporate the liquid and you should avoid any lumps.

Rating: 3
I found the taste a little too pasty so I added a bit of cream and extra butter once it was done. You don't need to heat the milk if you add it slowly enough that it gets warmed in the pot before you stir it in but nuking the milk in the microwave assures you of a good result.

Very easy, foolproof recipe. The sauce came together very easily and I've been able to use this in a number of recipes. For those who might be interested, I've also successfully made a vegetarian/vegan version of this sauce, using a butter substitute/margarine and rice milk. It comes out great!

If you're in a hurry, you needn't bother warming the milk first -- unless you find you have trouble with lumps. I've been making this since I was a kid and I used to heat the milk but now I skip that step.

Wonderful sauce, and easy. I used it in a pinch for an alfredo-type sauce--just added garlic and a cup of grated parmesan cheese. Anyone ever use it as a base for a sweet sauce?

Excellent over Birdseye frozen pearl onions. We added a bit freshly grated nutmeg + a splash of white wine.

Really easy and very good. I heat the milk in the microwave.(It doesn't get quite as hot as on the stove, but its plenty warm enough to prevent lumping and its one less pot to clean.)

Good Bechamel sauce - easily adapted for cheese dishes, sweet dishes and cream dishes.

I've only made the cheese version of this, as an ingredient for macaroni and cheese. It works, which given my lack of skill is a surprise.

Easiest Bechamel I've ever made. I added cheese for the Mac and Cheese I was making. Terrific!

I added sauteed garlic to it with olive oil(not too big on butter)for bite. Mm!

this is a really nice bechamel; it seems to get all the ratios right. my favorite variant calls for nutmeg (about 1/2 tsp, give or take) in lieu of black pepper - so spiced, it makes an excellent pasta sauce.

Delicious and easy. I followed the advice of others and added bullion.

I have used this recipe over and over with different flavours. The cheese variation is good for macaroni and cheese but a little bland unless you add a chicken oxo to the milk. This last time I made it, instead of 2 1/2 cups of milk I used 1 1/2 cups of milk and a can of Campbell's tomato soup. What an amazing sauce this turned into!

This is my family's favorite knock off of the Colorado restaurant "Noodles" version of mac and cheese. We serve it just like they do--with the dry noodles in a bowl and the sauce poured over, then the kids get to sprinkle their own cheese on top and stir it in. Very tasty!

This is a great basic recipe. Try adding a pinch of nutmeg. Yum. Also, I use white pepper instead of black; its a little more subtle. I will try suggestions of adding some flavors to the milk. Great idea.

This sauce is MUCH better than the sauce I was making before I found this recipe! When I heated the milk I add a chicken bulion cube and poured it over fried chicken and mashed potatoes. Now that's down home cooking!!

So good and very easy! Added white wine to the butter and flour paste. Certainly needs alot of seasoning...I will use this all the time!

Delicious. The Joy of Cooking also suggests adding a quarter of a peeled onion, a few cloves and a bay leaf to the milk while it's warming (take them out before adding to flour/butter mixture). This adds some really nice flavours. Also, I warmed the milk in the microwave, right in my glass measuring cup - avoids using a second pot - and it worked just fine.

I'd like to try this sauce on top of fried chicken breasts for a comfort food meal. What do you all think?

Great recipe. The sauce turned out smooth and flavorful. I used the advice given in the video technique and infused the milk with onion and bay leaf.

It's an excellent sauce for chicken & mushroom pie. Fried the thinly sliced onion in butter added finely cubed chicken and mushroom, cooked for 5 minutes and added the bechamel sauce over it. Added a well beaten egg to the mixture and baked in a pie dish using the baking pastry. It came out excellent! I would use it more often to other dishes.

My wife and I are living in korea, so it was nice to get a bit of the west for dinner. We'd love to add chicken to the Dish, but don't know if we should brown it and add it to the milk. Or brown it and add it later. Send replies to: mrbradleymrmartin@hotmail.com . By the way, it goes great with sake.:-)

Excellent silky, smooth, basic white sauce. I doubled the recipe, using 2 cups half & half and 1/2 cup chicken broth instead of milk. Like the previous reviewer, I added shallots, peppercorns and a bay leaf to the half & half mixture as it warmed. I needed a cheese sauce so I added about 2 cups shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese. Use plenty of salt....it really brings out the cheesy flavor. Would definitely make this one again, using it as the base for many different sauces.

Before making this recipe, I first watched the streaming video presentation, which directs you to warm the milk up with onions, bay leaf, and peppercorn; before adding the infused milk to the roux, you strain them out. I found that this really improves the resulting sauce. I most recently used this as a base for a salmon, shitake mushroom, and leek sauce, served over linguine. Heavenly!
