The grilled meatballs with the sauce combination is very tasty and different. Easy to make. Will probably make it again sometime in the future.

The slightly crunchy grill taste was worth the sacrifice of a couple of the meatballs on the grill. Getting the grill to the correct temperature (hot) and greasing it were key to getting the kebabs to turn without sticking. I skipped the veggies so it took some skill to turn all the meatballs on the same skewer at the same time. The sauce was wonderful. I substituted rice vinegar for cider vinegar and honey for the sugar.

I thought this was very tasty and it was easy to prepare. My husband said the meatballs stuck on the grill a bit, so I'd recommend oiling or spraying the racks first.

This recipe was very authentic. I would, however, add just a little bit more allspice. The Sauce is fantastic! It is one that could be used for many things but exceptional with the meatballs.

I make this all the time, with a few changes: I don't grill the meatballs, I roast them, at 350-deg for 30 minutes. And I make them small, and serve them with the mustard sauce for dipping as an appetizer. It is a huge hit everywhere I take it.

This recipe's ingredients and proportions come closest to my Swedish mother's authentic recipe. Note to those who replace the allspice with anything else: you're not making Swedish meatballs if you don't use mace or nutmeg or allspice as the seasoning. Italian seasoning? Please! And it's Swedish as in from Sweden, not sweetish!

This recipe was good; however, I did make one substitution. I used Italian seasoning instead of allspice

Where is the sugar or honey? Some sweetish meatballs THESE are!

One word:yuk! Bland and uninteresting. The meatballs were crumbly and some wouldn't stay on the kebabs. What a mess!

I love this recipe. I have made it several times for large dinner parties and there has never been any leftover. My guests just love them. They can be assembled ahead of time, however, they do need a pretty good bit of attention during the grilling because of the turning and basting. But well worth the effort.

Ofda any Swede knows that the spices for Swedish Meat Balls are: Salt, Pepper and Nutmeg (although not tto much please) the 3 meats used are used in this portion: 1/2lb Beef, 1/4lb lamb and 1/4lb pork all finely ground (do your own then you know what you are getting) the rest of the receipe is Ok but it sure was not accurate for: Swedish Meat Balls.
