I am in Spain and needed a dessert that would be suitable for Americans and well as local guests. Also needed ingredients that could be found in the market, so I picked this recipe. It was easy and excellent. Used short grain paella rice instead of long grain which I believe made the pudding richer and creamier.

The perfect rice pudding recipe. This rice pudding was a big hit. It's delicious and the perfect combination of flavors and the texture is just right. Made it for my boyfriend's birthday. We ate it for a week! Made it a week later for my father (who had tried some the week before & wanted his own batch!) For him, I halved the recipe. Perfect again. Highly recommended.

I made this exactly as written The flavor was great, but all of the liquid did not absorb. I drained the excess off a few hours before serving. Will try again making sure it simmers at a low boil as one of the other reviewers suggested.

Made this for our Christmas Eve Danish tradition. It was great, everyone loved it. I only had 2% milk and arborio rice but it worked perfectly. Instead of the vanilla I scraped a whole vanilla bean into mixture and a whole cinnamon stick. After adding the eggs I returned to heat for a few minutes then added cream. Set up beautifully, thick and rich, yummy!

My husband's favorite dessert of all time is rice pudding and he said THIS is the best he's EVER had. I cooked with two cinnamon sticks and only used 3/4c of sugar. He's ordered rice pudding from countless restaurants in his life, including the palace of pudding Rice to Riches in NYC. I highly recommend this recipe!

I used some slightly over the best-before date whole milk. It was a fabulous way to use up the perfectly okay milk quickly- and so delicious. I must admit that I pit it on the stove on very low heat and forgot about it. Remembered more then an hour later! Some rice had stuck to the pot bottom, but I just gently added the rest of the ingredients, careful not to disturb the stuck on rice. It hadn't burned, just stuck. It was (is!) absolutely de-lish!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I too used arborio rice and texture was perfect after a little more than an hour, even without adding the egg. Next time I might use a tad less sugar and may omit the egg altogether to see if it changes anything after cooling. This recipe is definitely a KEEPER!

This is the best rice pudding I've ever made. Made it as written except I cooled the cooked pudding and whipped the cream before adding - makes it a little "lighter" (ha!) but I'm sure it would be equally fantastic made as written. Next time I might skip the egg and cream altogether - the pudding is creamy and delicious even before adding those ingredients. This recipe has even managed to win over my husband who disdained rice pudding citing "traumatic childhood memories" of being forced to eat "some sort of milky rice" at summer camp.

Made this for Christmas Day dessert, it was NOMS. Took the advice of other reviewers and added a cinnamon stick and doubled the vanilla. I used basmati rice, so it was very pleasantly fragrant and tasty. I subbed half-n-half for the cream, and added closer to half a cup than a full one. Also added dried sour cherries while the mixture was still warm. DH is already requesting that we have this again sometime! We LOL'd though, at the 6-8 servings, DH said "yeah FIREFIGHTER size servings!" Plenty to go around, and wonderfully easy and fun to make. Does require a lot of stirring and attention, but so worth it.

Great, traditional comfort food. Works great with skim milk to save some fat and calories. I find I have the best results with sushi rice. Have also used arborio with good results. The 1 hour cook time seems to be too long for long-grain rice, I've had a couple of incidents where I've burned the pudding because long grain cooks faster and absorbs all the liquid. The eggs and heavy cream help make a custard-like consistency that is so decadent. I often cook with some orange zest for some complexity flavor. You can definitely experiment with variations on this; for example, using lime zest and coconut extract instead of vanilla.

I make rice pudding every Xmas. My recipe has to be tripled and is time consuming. Xmas 2010, I tried this one .It is easy and bountiful., has just the right creamy consistency and sweetness. I did make some changes. I used 6 cups of milk and 2 cups of whipping cream in the initail stage. I also added a tsp. of almond extract at the end. enjoy!!!

I make it with arborio rice and it is delicious. It needs to cook a little longer but it is creamier than when I made it with long grain. when I have clementines around, I cook the rice with the peel and it gives it a very delicate flavour.

This is the best rice pudding recipe ever. I used arborio rice and you really need to cook it for the full hour stirring OFTEN. The mixture needs to cook for a few more minutes after you pour the tempered egg mix back into the pot with the heavy cream. I added a small box of raisins at the end too.

This is wonderful! It was one of the easiest desserts I've made and one of the most delicious. Not sure why some people had texture issues. I followed the recipe method exactly and it set up very well, especially after chilling overnight. I doubled the vanilla and topped with chopped pistachios and mango. I might try a vanilla bean next time. Super!

Terrific recipe. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. I think the key to it thickening properly is that it simmers at a low boil. Even though it is rich with cream, I served it in small bowls and topped it with a dollop of the Spiced Whipped Cream on this site. My guests loved it!

To JenSam, This is my go to recipe for Rice Pudding and I have made it many times with great success. I think the main problem is because you used arborio rice when the recipe calls for regular long grain rice. Arborio is wonderful rice for risotto but has different properties. Try the recipe with regular long grain (Uncle Ben's) rice and I believe you will love it as much as I do. I also add a handful of raisins to the recipe! Good luck!

Can someone please help me? I made this recipe but it did not thicken enough. When I first cooked the rice with milk over the stove, it became thick and delicious. But after I added the eggs and heavy cream at the end of the recipe, it never re-thickened in the refrigerator. I used arborio rice. Could that be it? Maybe I need to add more arborio rice to these proportions? Am I supposed to put the pot back on the stove after the heavy crem is added? I've never had a problem with rice pudding before, so can't figure out why this one didn't set. The flavor is delicious. Please help.

Delicious but REALLY rich. For a casual weeknight dessert, I might use skim milk instead of whole but it is a lovely treat the way it is.

I halved this recipe but otherwise prepared it as directed. I had no problem with it setting up. Quite the opposite. Most of the milk was fully absorbed after cooking for an hour and stirring vigilantly, but my rice (Uncles Ben's long grain converted) was not as tender as I like. I added more milk and cooked another 15 minutes longer,but still not soft enough. The refrigerated pudding was really stiff and I added 1 cup of cream to the refrigerated pudding. It was very rich, but my family loved it. I prefer short grain rice for rice pudding and I think I'll stick with my standard Greek rice pudding recipe.

I make this recipe almost every Sunday & we enjoy it all week long with fresh fruit on top. For some reason, mine wouldn't thicken up in the fridge, even after sitting for 24 hrs, so here are my now tried & true alterations: * Use 1/2 gallon 2% milk & long grain rice (basmati or jasmine) * Reduce sugar to a little less than 3/4 cup * Skip the addition of cream at the end * After cooking the rice for about 2 hours, temper the eggs & then add back to pudding. Continue cooking for about 5- 10 minutes until desired consistency * Cook with a cinnamon stick. Add 1 tsp of vanilla & 1/2 tsp cardamom at beginning of cooking & again at end of cooking. Can throw a little ginger in too (or cinnamon or nutmeg) * Lots & lots of stirring during cooking

My family loved this recipe! I halved the recipe and had no problems with the consistency of the pudding, though it really does take the full amount of time to cook and chill.

This rice pudding is really wonderful, but it kept coming out runny, so I made a few changes that made it absolutely delicious. I decreased the milk by one cup and increased the rice by 1/4 cup. I added two cinnamon sticks and one vanilla bean while cooking. You may want to decrease your sugar if you don't like your pudding too sweet. The pudding needs the full hour to cook thoroughly and thicken. I added an additional egg, decreased the heavy cream to 1/2 a cup and added a cup of french vanilla ice cream when I mixed in the heavy cream. Allow this pudding to "set" on the counter for a bit before you refrigerate it. This is incredible!!!

This is delicious, but it is so runny once the cream is added. Not sure if anyone else has that problem, but I can't add a cup of cream and have it come out the consistency rice pudding should be. Tastes good though.

This was awesome! I think that next time I make it I am going to infuse someother flavors into the milk... maybe lavendar, maybe rose. It didn't take an hour for the rice to soften, so I pulled it after about 35 minutes and added the eggs and cream. Then I put it in the fridge... because I was in a hurry and needed it before three hours. After twenty minutes, with said time constraint, it was really liquidy so I put it back on the stove and put the heat on high and stirred it for about seven minutes so the egg in the mixture could thicken. I stirred it constantly and wished and wished. Then I put it in the fridge for about an hour. It was amazingly, perfectly thick and creamy when I served it. It was awesome! I will definately use this recipe again.

I have made this pudding 4 or 5 times and absolutely love it. My whole family loves is as well including 3 kids aged 2 5 and 8. When i make it I use whatever milk I have on hand and because I always watch fat content I use either 1% or 2% milk and omit the cream. I usually throw in a cinnamon stick while it simmers and a chunk of orange peel as well. The flavor is divine. Also add scrapings from a vanilla pod as well as pure vanilla. This is my favorite rice pudding recipe hands down. Next time I will try a short grain rice I usually use jasmine.

If I could give this recipe five stars, I would! Want to "bump it up a notch"? Try this: one day I was out of regular rice and whole milk, so I made it with Arborio rice (used to make risottos) and half and half. It was SPECTACULAR! Now whenever a friend of mine (a gourmand from NYC) comes to visit, she insists that I make it. This is the finest rice pudding recipe I've ever encountered (and I've tried MANY).

This is the best rice pudding ever. Rich, creamy and just perfect. I can't understand why people complain about the outcome of a recipe after they've made changes to it - of course the consistency of the pudding will be altered when you use skim milk in place of heavy cream. Keep the recipe as it is and you'll find it's exceptional.

VERY SOUPY even after cooking the pudding for 1-1/2 hours. So, I put it in the fridge overnight and it was still liquidy. It tasted great!! To thicken up the pudding I baked it in the oven for at 350 degrees for 1.5 hours. It definitely was thick, but still not quite so firm. Maybe my mistake was leaving it in the pot and not transferring it to the 9x13 pan. Next time I make this, I am going to reduce the milk by one cup so the pudding doesn't drown when adding the heavy cream. What are Gonzo's recommendations?

Just wanted to follow up to my last comment and say that actually, this recipe needs whole milk -- 2% just didn't cut it. A little less than a full cup of sugar is fine, however.

This is a very classic and delicious rice pudding. The first time I made it I omitted the cream and added cardamom pods and cinnamon sticks as another reviewer had suggested. It was plenty rich, and I devour it so fast that I'm now going to make another batch with 2% milk (and no cream) so that I don't have to feel so guilty about enjoying it. Also, very easy to make. Eggs could also be omitted if necessary, but they firm it up a bit at the end.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! You should definitely make some of your cooking choices for this recipe based on whether you intend to serve it hot or cold. If you're serving it cold, you need to cook the rice much more (since it will be harder and grainy if it's not cooked enough) and use the recommended amount of sugar, since it will seem less sweet when it's cool. If you're serving it warmer, you can cut the sugar back and cook the rice until it tastes just done. Delicious either way!

This is a good rice pudding recipe. However, I would recommend a few changes. The sugar could be cut to 3/4 cup-- it's a little too sweet with a full cup of sugar. Also, I think the heavy cream is unnecessary. It was thick-- almost like custard, when I took it off the stove, and delicious. After adding the egg, it still had a nice consistancy. The heavy cream thinned it out more than I like, and of course, added extra fat and calories. Next time I make this pudding, I will omit the heavy cream.

This is the best rice pudding ever. I use creamy whole milk, and it doesn't really need the heavy cream at the end. We like nutmeg, stirred into it and on top. The only caveat: it needs plenty of time to chill and set up (overnight is best). Even so, it's a creamy, diner-style rice pudding. It makes a lot; I keep a big bowl of it around and the kids dip into it for several days. Very comforting and yummy.

This is exactly what you would imagine rice pudding to be. The texture, the scent, warm or cold. The entire family just loves this one. I did however half the recipe the first time and the second time around, I quartered it, as this recipe could feed the entire neighbourhood. Also the second time around, I did not have vanilla beans, so I took saffron and it really worked very well. I stirred it maybe every 8 min. I first brought the entire mixture to a boil, watching the pot very carefully for 30 seconds. Then I reduced the heat on a gas burner to mid-low heat and let it simmer until most of the fluid evaporated, stirred it carefully, then reduced heat to the lowest temperature, stirred again and waited until I had the consistancy that I wanted. Like the poster right below me, you would then not need an egg.

Due to overwhelming family demand, I've now made this recipe 3 times--with a really different result each time. I'm convinced that the determining factor for each result was the amount of stirring throughout and that the type of pot used may also be important. The first time was perfect--thick consistency, and the sugar even caramelized slightly, yielding a dark beige pudding with a lot of flavor. During the cooking time, I was at the stove preparing something else and stirred the pudding every few minutes. The second time, pudding turned out soupy--I think because I was occupied by a long phone call and stirred only at the beginning and end of cooking. The third batch was stirred more than the second but not as much as the first. Result: pudding set up and was not runny but was not nearly as thick as the first batch. Sugar did not caramelize in the last two batches, either--I believe this is because I did not use the very heavy enamelled cast-iron pot with great heat conduction that I used to make the first batch.

I have made this recipe twice, the first time it was much too liquidy as some other reviews mentioned. The second time, I cooked it a little more than an hour, and made sure to use long grain rice.

This recipe was very easy to cut in half--I knew I would only be making it for my husband and myself. It "set up" and was ready for the egg at 40 minutes! I am surprised that people have said they needed to add extra thickeners. It was very good--not too sweet and very creamy. I refrigerated it for about 2 hours and when we ate it, it wasn't entirely cold, which was really nice. Next time I might mix some golden raisins, simmered first in bourbon or something. I wasn't crazy about the cinnamon on top.

It makes a very large portion.

This recipe had such diverse comments that I had to try it.

It was a good family dessert.

Very good basic rice pudding recipe. I added a bit more sugar for my taste, 2 tablespoons of madagascar vanilla and a grated fresh nutmeg in addition to cinnamon on top. At serving time I sprinkled pomegranate seeds around it. The long grain rice I used was jasmine because I like that flavor, however a basmati or other long grain rice would probably be just fine.

this rice pudding was awesome to make. I used skim milk instead of whole milk and it still turned out fine. it got a little thick but no worries I just added a little more milk to it. this recipe is definately a no-brainer. easy AND delicious. I also added raisins. it was perfectly creamy and not too sweet

This is the best rice pudding recipe I've ever tried. I used 2% milk, arborio rice and instead of the cream, I just used more 2% milk but not as much as 1 cup...just enough to make it a creamy consistency. It is so good warm or cold. Definitely a keeper!

What did I do wrong. Wonderful taste, runny after 10 hours. Followed directions to the letter. No extras and no omissions. After 10 hours in the refridg. it was runny. I am cooking it again to try to get to turn into a pudding consistency. HELP! What a waste to make a wonderful pudding into a milk shake!

My father-in-law is a rice pudding critic and he loved this. He kept asking how I got it to be so creamy. I'm not a huge rice pudding fan, but I really liked it also. I'm making a double batch for Easter.

I made this to use up some half n half and cream leftover from a dinner party. It was so rich, but so good. I actually increased the sugar a little to balance the richness of all the cream. I only added the egg yolks as that is how my favorite custard is made. I added the vanilla at the end. It is a softer pudding but it was thick enough. Next time I will try whole milk and half n half instead of cream. Yummy pudding!

This was a wonderful rice pudding. I used Arborio rice and it came out very nicely. I also used only 2/3 cup of sugar and only 1/3 of the heavy cream called for...and it was still VERY rich and definitely sweet enough.

This is a really delicious dessert. Mine was a little bit runny. I used the extra long grain rice, however. I will try a variation in the future. I would have liked a stronger vanilla flavor. Next time, I'll add it at the end as some of the other reviewers have recommended. I did add raisins however. That's just a personal preference, but it came out wonderfully. I was a little nervous about the eggs but everyone raved about the dish. I used slightly less than a full cup of sugar. Next time I'll try even less. Especially with the raisins, it was a little too sweet.

This is so easy. I used skim milk and no fat 1/2 & 1/2. I also adden a touch of almond extract. My family gobbled it up.

I made it just as it is written to see what the big deal was. It was good, however all that cream and whole milk left a filmy feeling in my mouth. Not very pleasant, I would make it again cutting some of the fat but not all. Maybe a little more rice too.

Absolutely delicious. Reminds me of my favorite restaurant back in VA. I use skim milk and use fat-free half and half for the cream. I've also used left-over rice and adjusted the milk and cook it for half an hour instead of 1 hour. You can use butter flavoring instead of butter.

I have made this recipe numerous times, with both short and long grain rice, and different types of milk, and it has always turned out great-all my friends who've tried it love it too. I add the vanilla at the end, and often add 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of almond extract at the same time-never could bring myslef to cover it with cinnamon though.

I made this for Easter dessert. The flavor was absolutely delicious! However, I did experience the problem of way too much liguid like some previous reviewers stated. I followed the recipe exactly and kept a close eye. It was very liquidy. I decided to strain out the cooked, tender rice and reduce the milk broth. I was careful not to boil the mixture, but came close. It worked. The liquid reduced and I stirred the rice back in. It got rave reviews. QUESTION: I'd love to make this again. Why have some people had this problem and others didn't??? I can't quite figure it out??? Any suggestions?? Should I reduce the milk right from the start??Love to hear some comments.

Absolutely PERFECT. The best rice pudding ever. Don't change a thing.

This has become a family favorite. I followed the recipe to the letter the first time. Long grain rice (not any other kind) unrinsed works perfectly. If you use another rice, then you'll have to experiment with the rinsing thing. The second time I added dried cherries plumped in a bit of hot water. Lordy, it was good. I've read some other reviews regarding using lighter milks and cream and I'll give it the old college try. I would definitely make it more often if it wasn't so heavy in fat. Also, with regards to the "liquidy" problem. My was a little runny the first time. So the second time I set the heat to a higher simmer and kept an eye on it. I was thicker and chilling it as long as it calls for helps the problem.

Great recipe, but I wish I hadn't added the whipping cream -- it made it much too heavy. 2% milk worked great; I think whole milk might be a bit overwhelming. And it does make a lot.

This recipe was so easy to make! Instead of milk I used a non-dairy fat-free creamer and the end result was a rich smelling and rich tasting guilt free treat!! I added a touch of nutmeg to the cinnamon which added an aromatic kick!

This is best recipe for Rice pudding I have found. It is exactly like the one my mother used to make at the Deli's she worked in. Fabulous! I did add the vanilla at the end as one reviewer suggested, keeps the vanilla flavor a little richer.

Rating: 4
After reading all the glowing reviews I felt that I had to try this. I also substitued skim milk and used fat free half and half at the end. I also added raisins and simmered a vanilla bean in the milk mixture. I used short grain rice and added a little extra (reading the reviews of runny pudding). It really is creamy and wonderful. A real comfort food. I found it really creamy and satisfying even though I used the fat free equivalents. I think the reviewer from Hong Kong was a little excessive though. A half cup of sugar would not make this sweet enough at all. Eliminating 2 eggs from this VAT of pudding seems silly. Come on, as far as desserts go, this is a pretty righteous choice.

This recipe is similar to one called Imperial Rice Pudding I've been making for years and years from a Women's Day or Family Circle magazine. It's even richer, calling for half/half instead of milk and egg yolks only, although I make it that way only for special occasions. Usually use whole milk and whole eggs. The method is similar too, but calls for parboiling the rice five minutes before cooking with half/half and sugar. Be sure to let it come to room temp. before covering and refrigerating. It also calls for adding the vanilla with the heavy cream rather than cooking it.

Rating: 4
I've made this at least three times, varying low-fat and whole milk, and also with both cream and fat-free half and half. Always great and very creamy. I've also varied long-grain with medium grain rice. I tend to cook it longer than called for because then it really thickens well. I also use a rounded cup of rice. Hope these suggestions help.

Rating: 3
This was much better than Kozy Shack! It wasn't as creamy as I hoped, so next time I will try it with less milk and more cream and perhaps another egg. I used basmati rice (since it was all I had), but didn't soak it first per instructions; I don't think it made a big difference. Otherwise, yummy!

I halved this recipe, but noted that it was not thickening, even after adding an extra egg. Very good ingredient combinations. tastes great, but needs tweaking. Maybe double uncooked rice. Raisens a great addition!

i made half the recipe (thank god) and used 3 cups skim and one cup fat free half & half. added a cinnamon stick, and half way thru a half cup of raisins. finished with half cup of the fat free half & half. do not cover and put in frig while warm or you will get condensation, which can make it runny. this was sooo great.

This was terrific. I too, used lowfat milk with great results. It is a good thing I cut the recipe in half (i am the only one in my family who likes rice pudding) or else I would have eaten the rest too!! Heaven in a bowl!! Thanks Gonzo and the NYFD!!!

I adore this recipe. I have made it twice, sustituting the whole milk (not the cream) with 2% milk and then with 1% milk. Both versions turned out creamy and set up beautifully. I threw in some dried sour cherries at the end as well. This is the ultimate comfort food.

I also had trouble getting the pudding to thicken and did follow the steps carefully. After 24 hours, it more closely resembled what I thought it should be. Thought the flavor was good and added golden raisins, as previously suggested.

LOVE this recipe. I too used a combination of evaporated skim milk, skim milk and half and half instead of whole milk and cream--and it was plenty rich and creamy. I also cooked it with a cinnamon stick in it, removed it before adding the eggs and cream. Very simple, very delicious comfort food!

This was yummy.....good winter comfort food! I, too, substituted milk to replace the cream and it was still nice and creamy. I guess the egg gives it a richness.

Patricia..maybe you cooked the rice at too high a temperature for the hour..temperature has to be very low after the initial boil..when you add the egg mixture and cream after the hour, let that mixture thicken a bit (about 10 minutes) before pouring it into the dish. Hope this helps!

This recipe is one that I made with my Italian Grandmother when I was younger. She never baked hers and made it exactly like the directions (except she put in a few cinnamon sticks with the milk mixture). I have to admit I did 6 Cups skim/ 2 Cups half&half. It was SOOOOOOOOO creamy. I also used short grain rice. I might cut the last additional cup of cream to 1/2 cup. It was SLIGHTLY looser than I like.

Made this rice pudding this weekend according to the recipe...except I added 2 cups of heavy cream in error at the end. I thought it was wonderful but will not use 2 cups of heavy cream again! Mine was creamy (not runny as a few reviewers indicated). Wonderful recipe!

Patricia, please note that the instructions are to cook the rice in the milk "until very tender". The time given is approximate, and only intended as a guide. If you don't check the rice at the end of the first step, the rest will not turn out well. Please try this again!

My husband and I love rice pudding and I was anxious to make this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, not substituting anything, and cooked the rice for the time specified. Well, the pudding never solidified to "pudding "consistancy after sitting in the refrigerator overnight and (I had to, after all the waiting, taste it) the rice was still hard after the initial hour of cooking. What did I do wrong or was there something left out of the printed recipe? I so looked forward to this only to be disappointed.

Great, pure vanilla flavor--better than baked rice puddings or fancy flavored ones. Just use Penzey's double-strength vanilla in this amount, for the best vanilla flavor. Perfect make-ahead dessert, great w/sliced mangoes on the side. Still super creamy, even w/fat-free half-and-half instead of heavy cream and a mixture of the fat-free half-and-half and 2% milk in place of the whole milk.

This was heavenly! I halved the ingredients with no adverse effects (like "Cook from Orange City", just the two of us) and used an 8 x 8 x 2 glass pan. It was so good, I don't think I'd want to risk making content adjustments when I make it next!

I took some of the other suggestions and used 6 cups skim plus milk and 2 cups fat free half and half, then the fat free half and half instead of cream. Used brown sugar, added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and while the rice cooked I steeped a cup of raisins in a Kahlua and water mixture, drained them and added at the end. Super and you wouldn't know that skim mik and fat free half and half had been used. My guests didn't till I showed them the containers then they had 2nds and thirds.

I thought the flavour was really good but felt it was just a bit too thick. I used Thai Jasmine rice and didn't rinse it, that might have been why it was so thick. But it tasted really nice and didn't last long at all. What I particularly liked was the quantity it made...lots! I've tried many other rice pudding recipes and have always found there wasn't enough and you would have to double it. I will certainly make it again but I might rinse the rice first and use half and half instead of full heavy cream.

Although I love to make desserts and don't usually change a recipe to make it more fat-free, I did change this recipe slightly based on the other reviews. Instead of using whole milk I used 2 percent milk and instead of using heavy cream I used half and half. The rice pudding was creamy and delicious and I can't imagine what it would taste like using the full fat items! I would definitely make this again. Next time I might try using slightly more rice (I used medium grain) as it was just slightly runny. I will also add golden raisins, just as I did in the recipe I tried - they're delicious in it!

Well, I know everyone got irritated with the Hong Kong chef, but I am here to tell you that some really great variations can be made that will turn this truly sinful dessert into a dessert that just tastes sinful. I substituted skim milk for the whole milk, and I used maybe 1/4 of a cup less than was called for because someone had mentioned that it was watery. I used short-grain rice because it really has a lot of starch and can make up for what the skim milk lacks in body. Then, I just used egg whites. I would have added butter, but I forgot, and it still tastes excellent. Then for the cream, I substituted fat-free half-and-half. If you have never tried that stuff, it is fantastic! It can really make or break a low-fat dish. I used all the sugar. One note, if you do make it this way, make sure that you pay close attention to the mixture as it simmers because skim milk can break apart easily. Mine is perfect, and I would put it up against any fattier version. Also, anyone who says, "Live a little," when someone is trying to make a healthy change needs to think again-- "Live a little LONGER." Plus, who wants to be fat? Life is better when you can have your cake and eat it, too. Most dishes can taste just as good with just a few fat/calorie reducing alterations.

Haven't actually made it yet, but it's virtually identical to one from my childhood, except Mom added raisings during the mid-to-latter part of the cooking. In response to the question re cooking eggs, not to worry -- the heat from the hot pudding actually cooks them. You have to stir a small amount of the hot liquid into the eggs to keep them from cooking too quickly (otherwise you would end up with a sweet, rice-y version of egg-drop soup). You shouldn't worry -- even my mother, an RN who is absolutely neurotic about salmonilla, was satisfied with this method. Having said that, there's nothing wrong with baking it if you want ... just a different texture.

Oh come on Hong Kong. Lighten up. Sometimes dessert is just dessert. Don't overindulge. You did make it much healthier, but the original recipe is outstanding. The posted recipe is rich, if you don't like it that's fine, but if you're looking for a reduced calorie dessert, don't be expecting it from a firehouse!! By drastically altering the original, you've turned it into something its not. So how can you rate it on those terms?

This turned out to be a family favorite. With all respect to the review from Hong Kong.. Your recipe is very healthy, but I think it doesn't need to be cut back QUITE so much to still be healthy... You omitted everything that could be considered unhealthy. I don't make a lot of desserts. We consider them a treat so I make the recipe the way it was written and serve small portions so my family can enjoy the treat.

There is no reason why rice pudding should not be both healthy and delicious. To begin with, I used a medium grain rice for a fuller and thicker pudding. I reduced the milk slightly from 2 quarts (8 cups) to 7 cups. I definately omitted the cream, definately omitted the butter and without question omitted the eggs. Also, I believe no more than 1/3 cup of sugar is needed for this recipe, although perhaps up to a 1/2 cup for those with a serious sweet tooth. By actually using one full cup of sugar, you are not only drowning this great recipe with sugar, but not doing your waistline any favor either. If you are a lover of chocolate and want to be decadent, you may want to add a one ounce square of unsweetened chocolate. Delicious! It works well. I also added small bits of dried fruit towards the last 5-10 minutes of the cooking process. I added the vanilla extract only after removing the finished pudding from the stove. My feeling is that the flavor of the vanilla is stronger when not weakened by the cooking process. One last suggestion. I covered my pot during the cooking process. And don't forget that while it's cooking, it is important to stir your pudding about once ever 15 minutes, otherwise you may end up with globs of rice. The pudding was finished in about 50 minutes and was truly delicious.
