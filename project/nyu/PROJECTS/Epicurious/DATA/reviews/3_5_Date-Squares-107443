Easy and yummy. 3 1/2 forks only because I reserve 4 forks for exceptional/unique. My changes: I added ground ginger and used half brown sugar to add chewyness. I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9 pan for 20-25 minutes. It didn't look done, but I wanted to be soft and chewy. I let it set overnight before I cut it into squares.

Absolutely delicious! I've been making these every Christmas for cookie plates & friends always ask for them. Make sure to not overcook them & roll them in xxxx sugar while war, then top with extra xxxx sugar.

This is a wonderful, easy cookie. My daughter has a nut allergy, so I replace the walnuts with crushed graham crackers, and they are great. I also like that they make a large number of cookies but are really easy. And my husband and kids think they're amazing, which is high praise for a cookie with fruit in it! They also freeze very well.

made this for mother-in-law's birthday and she hated me! could not stop eating them, she said. asked for the remainder to take home with her--about two dozen of them. called the next day to tell me they were good fro breakfast. great crowd-pleaser. kids liked it too!

Moist and chewy, fruity and just sweet enough. Make a batch and freeze half. Thaw and toss in powdered sugar for a quick dessert!

Really great, although chopping the dates was tedious. I made it with whole wheat flour plus some rolled oats; one stick of butter plus 1/2 cup applesauce; 3/4 cup sugar. I didn't have enough walnuts & so added slivered almonds. I didn't dust with sugar after (although I'm sure it's a useful step). Begs to be eaten with a little coffee ice cream.

i needed to write back...this is an AMAZING almost no fail recipe. it is not meant to be cdn traditional date squares...substitute oatmeal for 1/4 of the flour..otherwise, its a beautiful, soft, fragrant spicy cake/ square. omit the icing sugar. i used parchment paper with extra paper so you simply pull it out, slice when cooled...absolutely elegant...noone refuses it...good with vanilla icecream

This makes a great "torte" as well, cooked in a buttered, parchment lined 12" springform pan. Cut in narrow wedges, whipped cream as garnish, sprinkled with nutmeg.

To my fellow Torontonian: Try the classic date bar recipe on this site. I think this is what you are looking for. I too tried this recipe and was disappointed. It's not the date square that we are used to here in Canada.

These are good, but not what I was looking for. Very nice and moist, esp. after a day or two. I used way less sugar than called for, added oatmeal, and used half applesauce in place of some of the butter. I'm looking for a recipe with a layer of cooked dates, a cookie like base, and a crumble topping. Anyone out there have one? Perhaps my fellow Canadians?

this will be on our Christmas cookie list for sure. Everyone loved it and commented on it. Be sure not to cook them too long; they get hard.

This were good but not "WOW". I omitted a 1/2 cup of flour and substituted 1/2 cup of oatmeal, just like my other fellow Canadian reviewer suggested. Definitely needed the addition of the oatmeal. I'm going to try the pumpkin date squares on this site the next time.

This is a fabulous recipe. Not as cloyingly sweet as most date square recipes, these were just right. I made them as written except for putting 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg to make up for not putting any cloves, didn't have in the house. Next time I might try the Canadian suggestion and add some oats for texture but otherwise yum. Oh,, a little less icing sugar, definitely did not need lots.

these are good! the yield should be 9.5 dozen minus the "big crumbs" that i eat while cutting them up... anyway, i know healthy modifications can sometimes be overdone, but i experimented a little with these. instead of 2 sticks of butter, i used one stick, and made up the rest with apple butter and apple sauce. and due to that, cut down the sugar to just about one cup. didn't have walnuts, so crushed only about 1/3 cup peanuts to give a little texture. also took canada's suggestion and used some slightly ground oats. i also gave my dates a rough chop. baked for a little less time, and the results are very good! still sticky, chewy, moist, and delicious. i'll be making and experimenting with these again soon. oh, and i felt the extra conf. sugar at the end was not necessary - but for presentation's sake, sure, why not? but when stuffing them into ziplock bags for friends... they won't notice.

a small "canadian suggestion", substitute 1/4 of the quantity of flour for oatmeal. (traditianl canadian date squares need oatmeal) these are better than any date square ever made!!! elegant, adult tasting and dates are good for you. i have made them so many times and even double the recipe and give away plates stacked as gifts. no need at all for icing sugar at the end.

I've made this about 6 times and everytime it's a hit! They are incredibly addicting and for someone like me who doesn't eat what I bake, I couldn't keep my hands off it! I used organic dates and it makes all the difference. Much smoother and nuttier.

Delish!! Nice traditional Christmas spice flavours and a nice break from all those gooey concoctions of the season. Didn't use as much icing sugar. The squares keep nicely in a tin for over a week. My mother-in-law even loved these! They make lots and go equally well with a cup of tea or a glass of Port.

SO SO for a notorious chocoholic baker. Guests liked them and these really do taste like a fall and winter seasonal treat. I thought they would be chewier like that dense date nut bread round. Seemed to be done in a much shorter time than written. Would make than again if I had the stuff on hand and needed treats for a crowd as it makes a hearty pan full ( I used two smaller pans which probably made even more than the 9x13), or if requested.

Outstanding. Made per recipe but dusted the powdered sugar on much less generously than pictured. One thing I really like about these is the lack of cloying sweetness. They are just right, moist and delicious. Only took 45 minutes in my oven.

I've made these twice already and both times they were a big hit. They are great for a party because the recipe makes so many. I also noticed that the flavor gets even better by the second or third day.

Just made these today along with the Cuccidati (Italian Fig Cookies). These were moist, flavorful and down right fabulous! I might even increase the amount of dates next time. Also, try the Cuccidati that is also featured in this issue. I have added both to my cookie collection. You won't be sorry if you try these recipes.

This was a great and easy dish to make. Very good for the holidays and the recipe makes a whole pan full of these delicious little squares.

Delicious! Very moist with more flavor than the average date bar. Didn't bother with the foil and all the buttering- just sprayed the pan with Baker's joy and they popped right out.

These are very good and very rich--I'd give a 3 1/2 if I could! Wish I could have cut them as perfectly as they look in the magazine, though! I halved the recipe with no problem---just shorter baking time about 35 minutes total.
