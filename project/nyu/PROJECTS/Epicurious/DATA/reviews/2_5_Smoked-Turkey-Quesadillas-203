This was great; nice flavourful finger food to go with cocktails. Can't see how it could be called bland. The combo of the tart/sweet grapes with the salt and the lime juice, the subtle smokiness of the turkey and cumin, the crispy tortilla and the creamy cheese - hey, it's all good!

I Just happened to have had a freshly smoked turkey breast (heavey on the smoke!) This dish was anthing but bland. Forget the grapes! Topped with fresh tomatoes , lettuce, and sour cream this was excellent!

I didn't like the cooked green grapes, which tasted strange. Otherwise, the quesadillas were so-so. Next time I'll choose a different recipe.

I didn't use the grapes,but had cut up tomatoes, lettuce and onions with low fat sour cream and salsa to add some jazz. Not too bad. I'm not a huge fan of turkey or chicken luncheon meats, but my husband really enjoyed it. I put the lemon directly on the tortilla and used two instead of one.

Easy to make, but really boring and bland!

We loved this! Used co-jack cheese, lemon instead of lime (rubbed the wedge on the torilla) and used regular salt. Very different and delicious! Even great left over!
