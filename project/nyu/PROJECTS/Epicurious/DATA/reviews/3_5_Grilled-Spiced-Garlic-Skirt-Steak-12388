Delicious. Flavorful, tender, and juicy. My girlfriend and I made this the first time we bought skirt steak and we've never used another recipe. I can't imagine anyone not liking this, I suppose it's not fancy enough for some people's tastes. Prepping the steak is what takes the longest, cutting off all the connective tissue and such. But the steak cooks very fast and a little of the marinade goes a long way.

We did not like this at all. I think that's the first time I've ever said that about a recipe on this site.

Totally adequate, despite following the recipe to the letter. I'm glad I didn't make it for company. Will likely not make this one again. Exponentially better is the Ginger glazed flank steak w/ shiitake vegetables on this site.

I've never prepared skirt steak before and this recipe was quite easy to make and very delicious. I didn't have the ground coriander only the seeds. Came out great-my family & I loved it!

Excellent! I used the marinade for flank steak, and let it marinate for a few hours. I (accidentally) substituted whole coriander seeds, and that was fine.

Wonderful! I served it for a dinner party of 8 and it got rave reviews. I did marinate for 6 hours, however, and added a bit more garlic & a dash of balsmic vinegar. I am, in fact, making it again for a weekend BBQ. Great with garlic roasted mashed potatoes!

Easy to make, I will make this again, however I would add a little more spice and marinate longer than 15 minutes.

I thought this recipe was bland...I even added extra garlic for extra zing. I think there are better ways to make this and wouldn't do this one again.

I thought this was wonderful dish -quick, easy and very tasty. My husband and I are garlic lovers so I added more garlic (2 more cloves) than the recipe called for.

Absolutely delicious! One of the tastiest grilled steak recipes. I marinated mine for 5 hours and it was fabulous. My family loved it!

My husband and I both loved it! I was unable to access the Quesadilla recipe last year but I am looking forward to trying them this year.
