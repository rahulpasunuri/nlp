So simple, so comforting and yummy. I made one loaf by halving the recipe, I used 1/2c all purpose flour and 3/4c whole wheat, added about a tablespoon of grated fresh ginger, used all maple syrup, and omitted the almonds. After the loaf cooled I drizzled a maple glaze (maple syrup and confectioners sugar) generously all over the top, this along with the raisins make it a perfectly moist cake. Looking forward to making this with some variations in the future.

I just made this and it is so hearty and delicious. The only change I made was I put 1 tsp. of real ginger in as an addition. It is wonderful!
