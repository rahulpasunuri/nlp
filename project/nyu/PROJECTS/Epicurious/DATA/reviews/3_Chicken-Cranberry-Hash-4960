Used raisins, red onions and a mixture of 2% milk/EVOO instead of the cream. Also added button mushrooms and 3 garlic cloves (minced). It does stick to the bottom and turns into a mush if not careful. I transferred the hash to the broiler for the last 5 min to brown the top and harden it up a bit. Top with some shredded cheese. Had roasted peppers (chili/garlic spice mix) on the side with some citrus. Will make again using the oven instead of stovetop.

Seems like a tasty combination of ingredients, but the cooking method didn't work for me: the mixture stuck to my cast iron skillet. i don't have a nonstick skillet large enough for the mixture. I might try these ingredients again as a baked casserole.

This is super easy and tastes so good! I only had tater tots in the freezer so I used those; it was probably even better than using regular potatoes. Great dish for colder evenings.

Hubby loved it, easy to make and was great with the poached eggs and aspargus for a side. Would for sure make it again .

Not bad, but it was a little dry, and I kept adding more 1/2 and 1/2 to it. I couldn't really get it crusty either. I used the chicken from a cooked rotisserie chicken from the supermarket. It was very good with the poached eggs, though.

I had leftovers from Boston Market. I used the leftover chicken breast with chopped red onion and used 2% instead of half and half. After 10 minutes I added leftover cranberry sauce(Boston Mkt) and stirred it in. Heavenly!!! Definitely a basic recipe for jumping off.
