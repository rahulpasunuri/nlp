I used 1/3 the amount of amaretto - other than that we loved the flavor of this strange little dish. While it wasn't like any other charoset I've ever tried, it was great for the Hillel sandwich. I'll be making this again.

Made this last night as one of two charosets for Passover seder. Used half orange and half grapefruit, omitted the extra orange juice and the fresh ginger. Added an extra tbsp of honey to make it stick better. Wouldn't recommend eating it right after you've made it, as the amaretto overpowers everything - let it sit for a few hours and the flavors mellow and blend. Everyone at the table agreed it wasn't charoset, but had fun spooning it on to their matzos any way.

I agree with the previous rating - this is not haroset. It's tasty, would be good with strawberries added, but don't be fooled - it's not haroset.

Good as it may be, this is NOT charoset. Charoset is, by definition, something sticky and gooey - like mortar! This is simply orange and almond pieces flavored with amaretto and a little honey. An interesting fruit salad, maybe, but no way is this charoset. PERHAPS SOME CRITICAL INGREDIENTS WERE OMITTED FROM THE RECIPE? I wish I had analyzed it before making it and wasting my last 2 oranges!

It's light and fresh, but too much liquid. Not pasty enough for charoset; I consider it a nice fruit salad.
