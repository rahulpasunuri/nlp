I give the roast itself 4 stars but I wasn't crazy about the stuffing or the gravy. I found that the hot sausage was too spicy, detracting from the roast instead of enhancing it, and it was also greasy. It was also a nuisance to cut around the bones and my butcher was not willing to do it for me just before Christmas as the store was a madhouse. I liked the idea of a wine and whiskey gravy but it took much longer to reduce than the recipe indicated and the cream made it unnecessarily heavy. The horseradish cream was good but the two together is kind of overkill. I made two 5-bone roasts for 20 people and we only ate one of them. I was sorry I had bothered doubling the horseradish cream recipe. These quantities are crazy - no wonder Americans are becoming obese! I'd consider making it again, possibly without the stuffing, but I'd rather find a recipe that is simpler and simply lets the roast itself shine.

First time that my rib roast came out perfectly. It was delicious and a perfect medium rare. The gravy was wonderful as was the stuffing and the horseradish cream. I agree with a previous reviewer that the stuffing was dry so I added some broth prior to cooking. It was great that the recipe also offered ways to prepare items the day before. It made the day of the event so much less stressful.

The rib roast is outstanding! It doesn't need the gravy. The gravy is a lot of work, but my husband and I didn't care for it. The dressing is wonderful! We used the carrots in the picture and they developed this beautiful caramelization during the roasting of the meat.

It is real good as per the recipe and worth the effort. The way I made it from my bon apetit was with sausage & bread in the stuffing and I do not see that listed here. It is well worth trying to find this additional information in order to have this turn out.

Made this for New Year's Eve and it was a hit. Didn't put the stuffing in the meat, but baked in a separate casserole dish - 40 min at 350 or so. It seemed way easier than trying to get the stuffing to stay inside the meat and then trying to dig it out again. Also, used a package of plan stuffing mix instead of the bread. The gravy could have been halved for my group of 8. Do not skip the horseradish cream. I would prepare it the day before so the flavors have time to develop. I had some today (the day after) and it was GREAT!

Wonderful dish! The stuffing was delicious, but after reading the reviews, I decided to just bake it in a separate casserole dish instead if trying to cook it with the meat. The gravy also has a wonderful flavor, though I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it curdled. Is that because of the lower fat content, or just the combo of hot (acidic) wine with milk? It also took forever to make and I think since my roast was only 5 lbs, I could have halved the gravy recipe and saved some time with all of the reductions. Horseradish cream complimented everything well and the entire meal was just lovely and full of well balanced flavor.

Amazing!! The 1st roast I've ever done and the only recipe I will ever use. The garlic and rosemary flavour in the rib-eye marinating overnight really made this roast! I found the gravy to be a bit tricky though, did not turn out very good. But the roast, OHMY!!! One of my favourite recipes now. http://tastynchic.com

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was worth the trouble! The roast was so beautiful and full of flavor from the first bite to the last. The gravy was incredible. I followed the recipe to the letter and would make it again. My guests raved about it. Another homerun from epicurious! I paired it with plain old mashed potatoes and I'm glad I did...they didn't compete with the complex flavors in the roast and gave me another opportunity to taste the gravy.

This was an exceptional recipe. I made the roast as a part of a menu for New Year's Eve and the whole meal was a smashing success. I followed the recipe almost exactly as printed, with a few changes. I didn't have a rack for my roasting pan, so I placed the meat bone side down. I actually think this helped keep the stuffing inside of the roast, as opposed to the vertical preparation method. The horseradish cream was easy to make a tasted great. The red wine - whiskey reduction took a considerable amount of time to complete. I think the recipe calls for 45 minutes to reduce, but plan for more like an hour plus. It is totally worth it though, everyone at the table raved about the sauce. All in all, a great recipe and a great meal. Don't be intimidated, it takes a long time but is pretty straight forward and you and your guests will be well rewarded!

My crew likes their meat medium-well, how is this going to affect the stuffing since I will be cooking it longer?? I dont want dry stuffing.

Complex & complicated recipes do NOT intimidate me . This recipe wasn't worth the effort although I would make the horseradish cream again. The stuffing fell out, in spite of the string and the upright cooking method didn't render better results than horizontal placement.

This recipe is an excellent choice for a Christmas Dinner. The beef roast was really exceptional, and the gravy was out of this world. I made the gravy better by putting it in a blender and pureeing it. Because we didn't have any Irish Whiskey in the house, I substituted a Rye Whiskey, (Crown Royal, as a matter of fact!) The flambe was effective, and it still tasted excellent. My only regret was I did not have the time to prepare the stuffing for this dish, as my 11 month old granddaughter was getting tired from her first Christmas, so something had to go...it was the stuffing! I will definately make this again, with out any fear of failure.

I wish I could tell you how good this combination really is. The flavors are fantastic. I used a 17# roast, so I cooked mine longer (about 4 hours at 375). The Whiskey gravy has such a complex flavor and it adds so much. The Horseradish Cream is excellent also. The stuffing is the best too. This is definitly a keeper!

I made this last night for Christmas eve dinner and holy moly, what a hit. This is a lot of work but the payoff is epic. I followed the recipe exactly as is, gravy, porcini stuffing and horseradish cream too. The smell of the meat cooking is to die for. your house will smell festive and your guest will be wanting. When you flame up the irish whiskey during the gravy stage makes for quit a flame, be careful.

This is an exceptional recipe, not difficult, but allow yourself plenty of time to prep. I used a 5# boneless roast and tied it. I halved the recipe. It was enough for seven guests with leftovers. I skipped the stuffing after reading the comments by others. I strained the final sauce and thickened it a bit with a corn starch slurry. I served the roast with roasted fingerling potatos, red onion, and sweet potatoes and haricots vert. It was a hit.

This recipe is a keeper. We made it just like the recipe suggested and it was "hands down" perfect. I made the complete Dec. 2008 White Christmas Dinner with the exception of the yorkshire pudding. I would recommend starting at least 3 days earlier not the two as recommended. Most housewives have other things to do beside cook.

I was looking for something elegant to cook for Christmas dinner and this was like eating at a four star restaurant...It was gorgeous! The gravy was perfect! It accompanied an au gratin dauphine,green bean almondine and an Bailey's cheesecake. **I left out the stuffing.

This was AMAZING. What an incredible, restaurant-worthy meal. My guests claimed it was the best home-cooked meal they'd ever enjoyed. I began shopping for everything around 2pm, started cooking as soon as I got home, and we finally sat down and ate at about 8pm. It is a labor of love, and though not particularly difficult, it is time-consuming. If you have a man you'd like to fall head-over- heels in love with you, make this dinner.

We made this exactly as specified (except no broccolini) and it was totally fantastic!!! Everyone said we had outdone ourselves again. We had to use broccoli, so I cut it in spears to simulate broccolini and it was close enough. I bought the standing rib roast at Costco and cut the flap myself. It was SO great. Everything was superb!

This was the best standing rib roast we've ever made and it got rave reviews from everyone at Christmas dinner! We splurged and bought USDA Prime. The crust was delicious and the gravy was spectacular--even better on the day after it was originally served (I also was able to remove more fat after it was refrigerated). The only thing I would have changed about the gravy was that it was a little thin, so I would have used a thickener. Also, we were tempted to use scotch whisky (since we had no irish) but realized it was so smokey that it likely would change the flavor. We could only find HUGE bottles of irish whiskey in the grocery stores, but when we went to a regular liquor store they had a small bottle of Bushmills that was just enough. The stuffing was pretty messy when cutting the roast after it was done, but I had forgotten to add the egg so that might be why. The two cooks in our household have a disagreement about the stuffing. It was definitely tasty, but one of us didn't think it added much for the effort whereas the other one did. Also, in terms of timing, it took about a half hour longer to get the roast to medium rare than the recipe projected (we've found this with other prime rib recipes as well). The horseradish cream was very good but it made MUCH more than we needed (leftover cream is great for baked potatoes!). This one's a keeper!

I prepared the rib roast with the stuffing for a New Year Eve dinner. The gravey was a bit time consuming but it was worth it! My guests and I loved the favorful roast with the contrasting stuffing favors. This is definitely a recipe to keep.

This was very good. Why I gave it 3 forks is that I think a nearly as impressive result could have been achieved with much less effort. I love complex/ multi-day recipes but the flavor of this just didn't justify the effort. For leftovers (and an amazing meat pie) I made a reduction of the whiskey and wine which I added to a bechmel sauce. Awesome and in about 15 min.

I made the whole shebang with this menu exactly as provided as bon appetite described but had to substitute rapini for the broccollini which was out of season.Everyone and I mean everyone said it was the best christmas dinner they've ever had.I used the convection roast function on the roast and reduced the temp. by 25 degrees...Amazing menu and finished product...a gorgeous meal

Absolutely the best Xmas roast beef we've ever had. Brocollini was impossible to find so we substituted rapini. Big hit. To finish, I made a roux with the drippings and simply added the gravy base. Easy, thickened quickly and delicious.

Wonderful Holiday Dinner! Made nearly the entire menu (substituted Christmas Cooler for the beverage and green beans for the broccolini), grilled the meat to free up the oven. Substituted beef tenderloin for the standing rib roast (the savings more than made up for the leaner flavor) and my extended family couldn't have been happier. The gravy was delicious and offered a really nice flavor profile for the meat, stuffing and potato gratin.

This was the most delicious and beautiful Christmas dinner ever. I followed the recipe, made the stuffing and gravy base the day before. It was a lot of work, but definitely worth it. The gravy was the only issue we had, we could not get it to reduce enough to cling to the spoon, but we served anyhow. I made all the sides, but did haricots verts with toasted pine nuts rather than the broccolini and I made different popovers as I had a vegetarian at the table. Everyone requested this meal again next year.

Awesome Christmas dinner. As some previous reviewers said, make the gravy base and the stuffing a day ahead. I used dried shiitakes because I couldn't find porcinis. I also added a little Wondra to the gravy because I was sick of waiting for it to reduce. I doubled this recipe for 16 people and there was no food left. Gravy and stuffing are totally worth it - I actually think the stuffing might have been the best part.

The roast was tasty. However, the stuffing was a little too overpowering for the rest of the meal. Everyone loved the horseradish cream, but the gravy is a waste of time. It took FOREVER to make, luckily I started a day ahead, and it was just too rich. Next time, I'll just forget the stuffing and the gravy.

12/25/2008 - Excellent! Probably the best prime rib we've ever made. A LOT of work but worth it. I made this as a recipe for 5. I halved the Horseradish Cream and made the full recipe of stuffing. Worked out perfectly. I made the stuffing, gravy base, and horseradish cream a day ahead to lighten the work on Christmas Day.

The stuffing was outstanding. My butcher felt that creating a flap instead of the tying as instructed would work. It did but the roast came away from the bone and stuffing but it did not dry out. The gravy took forever to reduce much longer than stated directions. I missed the final toasted pepercorn step. The gravy was still tasty. The horseradish sauce was easy and added another layer of flavor. Very rich, very heavy, very tasty. Would make again but do ahead as the recipe recommends rather than all on the day of serving.

One word....Amazing!!! Yes, it took some time, but it was outstanding. I think the gravy was a bit rich but excellent with the roast. The Potates, carrots, and Yorkshire puddings all turned out well. My husband said that it was definitely the best Christmas meal yet. If you love to cook, all the work is well worth the results. I think the next time I would do as much as I can the day before so I am not in the kitchen all day. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

It is Christmas day now, and I just slid over to the laptop to write this review after our meal.Superb! Porchini mushrooms were not in our town at all, so I subbed baby portobellos with a proper ratio, not an equal ratio. Yes, the gravy seemed to take all day. The times stated were a far cry from what it should have been, but once it was reduced and cooked as it should have been, it was amazing. By itself it is a strong gravy, but with the meat, it is great. This has to be the best holiday meat I have ever had. The cost of the ingredients is huge, but it is quite a spread and sure to impress. Follow the suggestions and make what you can the day / night before. This will prove to be a real time saver.

The only thing that kept this from being 4 forks was the gravy. Have to agree the red wine was a little overpowering. The roast and stuffing were terrific, however. Very tender and flavorful. Made a nice presentation for Christmas dinner, I would make the roast and stuffing again but with a different gravy.

Nice recipe but I wouldn't make again. For the amount of work I don't think it was exception. Certainly not a difficult recipe but seemed to take quite a while. I agree with others that the gravy was a bit overpowering. The side dishes were very good - carrots, brocollini and the potatoes. I think the potatoes were the hit of the meal.

The rib roast with the rub and the horseradish cream was very good. The stuffing was not good at all. We did not cook it in the rib roast because after putting the stuffing together we felt it would overwhelm a delicious cut of meat. The gravy did not thicken as we thought it should and the flavor was only OK

I thought this dish was fabulous! The porcini stuffing is so well balanced-- just enough seasoning but still very mild with the addition of the spinach. Wouldn't change a thing. The roast is perfect. The only thing I didn't find a huge hit was the gravy. If I could do it over I would just use the beef stock, chicken or turkey broth, and a bit of whiskey. I thought the red wine overwhelmed it, but that may be my southern roots showing.

We had this after turkey leftovers ran out. It was terrific. It also was alot of work - but worth it. Definitely do the gravy base and stuffing the day before. The gravy base took longer to reduce than stated, but it might just be my bad pot. Mine roast pan also just had burned bits, but still added whiskey & broth as stated. It really was a great taste with the beef. Didn't do the horseradish cream - ran out of energy for that. I also made the sherry vinegar & molasses carrots that were with this recipe in the magazine. That was also a great twist on boring carrots.

This roast was absolutely fantastic. Followed the recipe to a "T" and it was an absolute hit for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner. The stuffing was indeed rich, but it was worth every bite. I didn't have too many pan juices left over after the roasting process (rather I had a lot of burned garlic and herbs from the rub) so I omitted the additional whiskey and chicken broth from the sauce and instead just reheated the base - everyone raved. A true winner!
