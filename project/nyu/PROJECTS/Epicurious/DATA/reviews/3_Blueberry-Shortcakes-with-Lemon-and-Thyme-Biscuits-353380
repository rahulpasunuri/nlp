Loved this recipe! The blueberries were a little sweeter than we like, but that's just personal preference. Biscuits came together nicely and had a wonderful not-too-sweet flavor. Thyme was an interesting and delicious touch.

I love this - made it once and immediately made it again. I skipped the thyme but loved the lemon mixed with the blueberries. Don't give up on the dough - I added some flour to one batch to get it to come together better, and another batch needed a little more liquid, but once you get the right consistency it will puff up nicely and flake apart just right. I thought the blueberry mixture was just right - none of that jammy, commercial blueberry pie stuff, just fresh berries treated gently. Yum!

The blueberry sauce was good and the idea of the recipe sounded good but the biscuits were terrible. They were unlike any shortcake I've ever had and mine browned too quickly in the oven, and the biscuits themselves didn't have good flavour or the texture of shortcake. Not good.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Since fresh blueberries were not in season, I used frozen. I can't wait to make this with Alaska wild blueberries that I hope to pick at the end of August. Forgot the raw sugar and don't think it was missed. Came out perfect, and easy to make. I cut the dough to make square biscuits. Yum...

I made this with a whole bunch of blueberries that we had around on the farm. I made one big shortcake because the dough was so sticky and because it's SO humid here. I made a double recipe of the cake but only 1 1/2 of the blueberries. I loved the sweet/savory-ness of the cake and the soft, tender crumb. We just had the fruit and cake and everyone LOVED it!

Delicious. Used whipped cream instead of ice cream and put it all together like a sandwich. The blueberries were soupy so next time will not add water. Also, it's plenty sweet without the raw sugar . Would use less powdered sugar too and add corn starch to make it less soupy.

I had some concerns about this as I made it to bring to a dinner group: I thought the blueberries were a bit watery and I nearly burned the biscuits--probably because I had to stretch the dough to make 8 and they were thinner than they might have been--but my friends loved this dessert! The lemon and thyme is a great taste. I'll make these again--but I'll watch the timing more closely.

This was delicious. Yes, the dough is sticky but not at all unmanageable. I liked the flavor of the biscuits more than I liked the texture (not as light and crumbly as I like biscuits to be, but I may have handled the dough too much). The lemon and thyme flavors were slight but definitely there, and they made it unique and distinctive. I actually didn't have lemons so I used lime and it was still good. The blueberry sauce was really soupy; not sure what I did wrong there, but hey, the flavor is still very good. I would give this a try!

I gave this two forks, although I had a one fork experience. I was making this 10 hours ahead for a dinner party, so this might have been part of the problem. The dough was very sticky (but work-able, with preserverence) but the biscuits ended up not as flavorful as I'd hoped, nor did the blueberry filling. I think it would be worth someone trying this if it were to be served immediately - both elements tasted better in the morning than they did at night.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be. The biscuit dough is REALLY wet and sticky--I ended up just plopping it on the baking sheet instead of forming true biscuits. The blueberry sauce was okay. I think a much better blueberry dessert is the lemon cornmeal cake with crushed blueberry sauce.
