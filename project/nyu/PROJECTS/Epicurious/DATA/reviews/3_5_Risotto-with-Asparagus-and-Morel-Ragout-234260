i have made tons of risottos, and Epicurious recipes.. this is great! I did not pre-boil the asparagus, left out the chives, and added less broth to the vegetables. truly delicious

Very good but, reduce the liquid in the ragout a little.

I used shallots instead of a regular onion, vegetable broth instead of chicken, cooked the asparagus about 1/2 the time the recipe called for, and used slightly less lemon. This is a good, basic recipe that can easily be played around with, and I'll definitely use it as a standby from now on.

It's the first risotto I've made. Maybe a bit too ambitious(?) but I can say it wasn't a disaster! 1) I used a dried mushroom mix from D'Artagnan and added additional dried porcini mushrooms. Fresh morels would've cost an arm and a leg. 2) I admit, I'm never quite sure how to use frozen vegetables, other than frozen peas. The fresh asparagus at the grocery stores just didn't look good, nor were their stalks slim. So I bought frozen asparagus stalks. I didn't like the way they turned out - not completely mushy but not quite as firm as I like my asparagus to be. Next time, if I can't find good fresh asparagus, I'll probably just omit them from the recipe. and I think I'd do as the previous commenter said - put them in right at the end. 3) I loved the ragout. Looking back, I would've probably tried to double it. Yummy.

This was good, but the asparagus was too cooked for my taste (cooking in the beginning and at the end again). I would just throw it in at the end and cook 2-3 minutes at that time. The lemon zest really pulled this together - don't leave it out!

Lovely and delicious. It presented beautifully.

A really solid recipe. I made it for Easter and it was a great accompaniement for ham (easily served 5 with leftovers.) Next time I'll 1/2 the lemon zest (a bit overpowering), add more garlic (probably 2 cloves), add more parmesan and a little fresh thyme and tarragon.

Overall this was just okay - not the best risotto I've had for sure....a waste of morels too.

WE LOVED IT! What a great idea for my fresh asparagus. I plan on making it again for Easter. One step can be omitted if you simply cook the asparagus in the chicken broth. Simple and Delicious

Excellent risotto. A little bit of excessive prep work but the results were well worth the effort.
