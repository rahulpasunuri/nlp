Quick and easy to make. I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and added more walnuts than the recipe called for. The 'candy' mixture is enough to coat about a cup and a half of nuts.

This recipe is quick and awesome. I made it with pecans instead, and can't recommend that highly enough. Also, I used butter on the baking sheet instead of vegetable oil spray. Yum.

I make these whenever I want a good candied nut for a salad. I always depan them right out of the oven and transfer them to parchment, separating them so they don't clump together. If you leave them on the pan you will need a chisel to pry them off!

Finally made these candied walnuts...the ingredients are wonderful & I might play around by adding some other stuff next time - cinnamon or cardamom...maybe even rosemary! One thing I didnt like is that once the walnuts were clearly done in the oven, they still taste "raw" and untoasted on the inside. I think i'll try to pre-toast the raw nuts next time - then cover w sugar, etc. and finalize in the oven.

These were easy to throw together and great on salads or just a handful for a snack. I took the tips of earlier reviewers and used honey in place of syrup. I also had a pan coated with spray and flipped the walnuts onto that to cool out of the oven.

Made these to go with the Baby greens, pear, walnut, and blue cheese salad. They were good, but would substitute like others have done with either honey or maple syrup. They just didn't have the sweetness I thought they would. They were very good though and will make them again.

i tried these using honey instead of corn syrup last year and they were delicious! i made this recipe again a year later and forgot about the switch. i made them with corn syrup and didn't like them. i then tried them with maple syrup and again didn't like them. my company didn't like them either. so, i am going back to the honey.

Loved these nuts on their own and were excellent in the pear salad. My daughter didn't like the cayenne pepper, so I'd probably make omit the pepper next time.

I don't use the hot spice when I make these nuts, but they are the best. I make them all the time especially for holiday meals. Easy and delicious...I think the market was selling glazed nuts for $7.99 a pound. These have got to be less than that. (Walnuts from Costco)

I took several pieces of advice from these comments: subbed maple syrup for the corn syrup, used a Silpat mat with no oil, and turned them out on parchment to cool. My first batch was too spicy with the cayenne for a mixed crowd of family, and they did not get crispy enough. The second (cayenne-free) batch stayed in about 5 extra minutes and these got nicely crisp. I put the first batch BACK in the oven and those got slightly overdone (due to my inattention) but they are still delicious.

I made these for a baby shower and the bowl was emptied in no time! I made one substitution: I used maple syrup to replace the corn syrup. I made a double batch and left 1/2 of the nuts at home; later, I used them to fill small filo triangles and baked 'em in the oven. I followed the instructions on the filo package to bake it correctly, and brushed each with a small amount of butter. These came out SOOOOO GOOD now all my friends always ask me for more! The nuts were fabulous by themselves--maple sweet plus cayenne heat can't be beat! (groan :-) I'm going to make the filo-filled treats for holiday presents this year--it takes a long time to work the filo dough but it is worth it.

wow, these are the best candied nuts ever! I did not find them too salty at all. I use sea salt and corn syrup. I cook them on a cookie sheet, but immediately transfer them to another cookie sheet sprayed with no stick spary. Otherwise they are really difficult to get off the sheet that they are cooked on. I put them on a bed of spring lettuce, top with chunks of gorgonzola cheese, sprinkle on some raspberries, strawberries or canned oranges and top with a homemade raspberry dressing....sublime!! I make this salad often and always get asked to bring it in to luncheons for both family and work.

So easy and a great gift. I use maple syrup instead of corn syrup. It works great with pecans, too.

Rating: 4
Best recipe I've found so far. Very easy to do. I found that I didn't need the corn syrup (I was out), I used two TBSP maple syrup. Also, didn't have any problems with sticking as I used a Silpat sheet. Finally, the first try I followed the 15 minute oven instructions--BIG mistake. Now, I do 6 minutes at 325 degrees F., and 7-8 minutes at 300 F., watching very carefully. After cooling, excess goes into a baggie and keeps very well. Try this recipe with baby spinach, sliced pears, and a raspberry vinaigrette. . .

I've been making this recipe at least monthly for several years and using the it on arugula salad with blue cheese and apples or pears. It's PERFECT just the way it is. For fun, I've subbed honey for corn syrup and pecans for walnuts, and that's fantastic, too.

I used maple syrup in place of corn syrup. This came out delicious, although I might use slightly less salt next time. I left these around the kitchen after I cooked them, and by the time I went to put them on the salad, there were significantly fewer nuts... oops!

i followed the recipe exactly the first time and wasn't thrilled with the result. the walnuts tasted alright but were overdone and a little bland. the second time, as a result of reading the numerous reviews, i used pecans, a silpat and no oil, turned the temp. down to 300 after about 5 mins, added a bit more cayenne and black pepper and substituted maple syrup for corn syrup ~ spicy sweet and fantastic! thanks everyone.

I love this recipe! I use pecans instead of walnuts and found them to be super delectable on top of the Baby Greens, Pear, Blue Cheese and Walnut recipe on this sight. To make a full meal out of it, also make the Dijon Chicken Breasts, slice thinly and put in the salad...amazing!

Very poor recipe - too much salt, no sweet flavor, just "candied"... I followed the recipe exactly, will look for a better one in spite of the other glowing ratings!

They tasted fine, but not great. The corn syrup makes them taste too much like...corn syrup. I'm going to try maple syrup or just deep dry them in sugar next time.

These are my favorite candied nuts of all time. The key is to not burn them. Make sure you stir them a few times while cooking and I usually turn down the heat to 300 after 5-7 minutes.

Have made this a few times now and get requests for recipe. It always turns out well. I am now going to lessen the salt, remove cayenne and substitute cinnamon to make them for a sweeter treat at a party.

Simple. Good. And easy to change for particular flavor combinations; more sweet, less salty, leave out the cayenne, etc. I've made this numerous times, and use the walnuts (or pecans, or hazelnuts) not only on salads but also as gifts! Wrapped in a glassine bag from the craft store with a pretty ribbon... impressive but terribly easy.

Fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly, although I doubled it, and I'm glad I did. I ate half of them before my party. Spraying the baking sheet is key, as is turning the hot nuts out onto parchment.

This is an excellent basic recipe to build on. I'm in high school and made it for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day - by the end of the week everyone in his family was begging me to make more! Apparently they had been fighting over the last few handfuls for days. I added more cayenne in my recipe, and a bit of cinnamon, clove, and a healthy amount of ground ginger. The spices can vary alot, but one note: don't be afraid to use lots of salt. I thought added more than the recipe calls for and was going to redo it, but the saltier version turned out to be delicious.

This recipe is quick, easy and delicious. I can't keep it in stock. My family nibbles on the walnuts; my guests beg to take some home--and they go as quickly as I can make it. I added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne and use a silpat sheet with no oil. When I can hold on to them long enough, I add them to a salad of mixed greens, pears and balsamic vinaigrette. The salad earned raves every time I have served it.

Excellent recipe! Not too sweet and nicely crispy. I think I'd add more cayenne next time, but then I do like things spicy. They are good enough that I'm giving them as a gift.

Cooling the nuts completely in the pan caused my nuts to be glued to the pan even though it was a nonstick pan sprayed as directed. If this happens to you - put pan briefly back in oven until sugar softens again and then remove from oven and scrape nuts onto parchment paper you have laid out on counter. This worked great for me. Otherwise a good recipe.

Not only are these great tasting this is by far the easiest way to make candied nuts.I leave out the pepper as I just dont care for it on candied nuts.Sometimes I sub pecans for the walnuts. This recipie has never gotten sugary like sometimes making it on the stovetop does.

I was happy to have found this recipe and it came out great. Although next time I will not use pepper or at least a fraction of what the recipe calls for. The pepper can easily take over. Great for snacking on and of course on your favorite mixed green salad.

This is a great and easy recipe. Great to add to Salads. I burnt my first batch. On the second batch, I stirred the walnuts 4-5 times which seemed to help to keep the walnuts coated. Keep the salt in and add enough of the cayenne.

I made these to use as a topping for a spinach salad with a raspberry vinaigrette, and I thought they were perfect. I did crank up the spices a notch, by adding a VERY generous amount of cayenne and black pepper, and I added some turmeric as well, which gave them a slightly more complicated flavor, as well as a beautiful golden yellow colour.

I wasn't thrilled with these - I found they were too sweet and not quite savory enough. I cut down the salt a bit after reading other reviews, then found myself adding it after cooking because the nuts weren't salty enough! Next time I would really spice them up - lots more cayenne or maybe some curry.

This method of making candied walnuts is the best and least messy that I have found! I love it!

Rating: 3
I doctored this recipe by reading all the spiced and candied nut recipes I could find on the website and combining them. I put in 5 spice, black pepper and cayenne, used the Karo and sugar. Would have used maple syrup if I had it, but did not. DO cut down on the salt. Even reduced, it was very salty (and I used unsalted nuts). I didn't stir, but let the whole mess cool and broke it up with my hands. It stores a lot longer than 3 days if it isn't eaten all up! Keeping my kids' hands out of this mix is a challenge. Great in salads or for munching!

Didn't have corn syrup so used 1 T maple syrup, 1 T honey and turned out great. Also, I have super-nonstick pans so made it on top of the stove. Lowest gas heat setting, no Pam or oil, 15 min stirring every once in a while. Perfect!

I came home with a gigantic bag of walnuts from Costco, so gave these a try. This isn't the best candied walnuts recipe I've tasted, but it is the easiest by a very, very long ways. I followed the suggestion of the reviewer that suggested baking them on a silicon mat, and cleanup was a cinch. I used 1T of honey and 1T of corn syrup. I was afraid honey might burn, but it didn't. Next time I'll try all honey. Several reviewers commented that the nuts were too salty. I like a sweet/salty taste -- but I agree with the other reviewers that this recipe overdoes the salt. Finally, I used white pepper instead of black, and mine came out plenty "hot".

Delicious. This is the easiest method I have used so far for preparing candied walnuts, a favorite of mine. To bake the walnuts, I used a Fiberlux nonstick baking mat made of food grade woven silicone. The walnuts came off easily. The sugar residue washed off in seconds. Any upscale kitchen store carries this product such as Sur La Table.

I used pecans instead and it was a real crowd pleaser. People started picking out the nuts and just eating those instead of the salad.

This is the second year in a row that I have used this recipe. If you like nuts, and like the combination of a sweet taste with a bite, then these are for you. I made them this year for little token holiday gifts. Fast, easy, and well worth it. I don't know why the other people had difficulty with burning. Mine stayed in the oven for the time prescribed with great results.

Very easy and versatile. I tried two other recipes but liked this the best. You may need to go heavy handed with the spices to get a tastier nut but I can see how you can get creative with it. I only had dark corn syrup, but it tasted good anyway. I agree watch the time on these I'd check after 2-3 minutes and stir then remove after 5 minutes.

This walnut recipe is a good one and easy to play with. I tend to make the walnuts a little more on the sweet side.....I add a sprinkle of cinnamon...yummy! It also makes a good little host/hostess gift during the holidays. I make a salad with mixed field greens, gorgonzola cheese, thinly sliced fuji apples, candied walnuts and a raspberry vinaigrette dressing.....delicious.

I liked the texture but the taste lacked more spice. I think other sweet spiced nut recipes may be better. My husband was also not that impressed. We had them in a salad and I could see where they add some interesting flavors and texture but not that impressive overall.

Be careful when making these, they can burn quickly! I checked them after about 5 minutes, and then I checked on them about 5 minutes later and they were completely burnt! I really like the idea of them, so I will try to make them again - but I'll watch them with eagle eyes.

I made these for a spinach salad the crumbled blue cheese. When I do it next time I think that I will omit the salt and pepper to see how they are. Watch them carefully in the oven, and make sure to turn them over completely when stirring. The ones that didn't get turned enough had a slightly burned taste.

I love these - though I do alter the recipe and sub pecans for the walnuts. I make them by the bagful and use as munchie for parties. I also put them on my Spinach/strawberry salad
