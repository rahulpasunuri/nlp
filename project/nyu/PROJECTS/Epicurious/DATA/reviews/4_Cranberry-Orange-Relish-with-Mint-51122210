This was a surprise and wonderfully different. I left out the onion, since I have a few onion haters in the house. But even without, it was fresh and tasty. I must admit I was very suspicious about not cooking the cranberries, but I will be repeating this again.

This cranberry relish is delightful. It's nice to have a bite of fresh, slightly sweet and tart relish to round out the savory gravy and turkey at Thanksgiving. I received rave compliments all around. Even more interesting was using fresh, uncooked cranberries which had a nice crispy crunch to them. The recipe is perfect as is.

I made this for Thanksgiving as a change from the usual cooked cranberry sauce. My family loved it - the fresh ginger was a nice taste surprise. Next time I'll add a little more mint, but otherwise won't change a thing.

My brother made this for Thanksgiving. The red onion and mint gave the relish a more complex flavor than the usual cranberry relish. Everyone even the 2 year old loved it. Only one issue I can't use the leftovers for my cranberry pumpkin muffins on Friday morning.

Extremely simple, tastes bright and clean- sweet and slightly savory. An easy addition to Thanksgiving, and the family loves it. Be careful to sample the onion before adding it, as raw onion can vary a lot.
