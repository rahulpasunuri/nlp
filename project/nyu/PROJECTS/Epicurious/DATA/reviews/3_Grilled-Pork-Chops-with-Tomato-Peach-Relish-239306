RELISH WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD! (Can also imagine it with roast chicken.) Baked chops at 350 instead of grilling. Added 1 TBS mango chutney to the relish for extra touch of sweetness. Didn't have jalapeno and used 1 big tomato instead of minis. Fresh basil and mint were from my garden and peaches are in season. Make more relish next time!

Delicious salsa! Heeding the "bland pork" advice of others, I added salt to the lime-garlic-oil marinade and let it marinate for an hour at room temp before putting it in the fridge to marinate for several hours more. It's a good thing I did! Otherwise I'm guessing it would've been bland. I served this dish with summer corn on the cob, green beans and a bold red meritage and thought it made for a great meal!

This is a very good quick and easy recipe for pork chops. Nice week night meal for family, but not "company worthy". I followed the recipe fairly closely. The salsa has a nice fresh flavor, it is good, but not spectacular. I would not hesitate to make this again, but only for family.

I LOVED the salsa part of this, but quite frankly the pork chop was a tad boring. It was missing some oomph, but I don't know what that oomph might be. I gave it two forks b/c the salsa was delicious.

This was fabulous. Used a tenderloin instead of chops. I did make one change, I didn't add jalapeno because I have a two year old.

3 1/2 forks! Really very tasty! I made the relish with white peaches, red grape tomatoes and some reg. yellow tomatoes. Looked great and tasted even better. Grilled boneless pork loin chops. Will definitely make again and again.

Wonderful summer dish with great flavors. I would definitely make the relish with other dishes or as a side.

The salsa tasted amazing for such simple ingredients. The pork on the other hand was a bit bland. I think it needed more time in the marinade. This is definitely worth trying again.

A thoroughly delicious recipe. So many pork chop recipes leave me wishing I had just made them plain and not bothered with wasting other ingredients that don't end up improving the flavor of the dish. This was tasty, easy, and perfect for a summer evening.

I disagree with those who thought chili powder was out of place. The whole dish was very good, no changes necessary.

I did this tonight and the chops were good, but nothing spectacular. The relish was just so-so.

Used chipotle instead of chili powder, and chopped heirloom instead of cherry tomatoes. This is an excellent salsa.

Left out the chili powder as "oakes3" suggested, and it made for a fantastic complement to these chops and several other meat dishes. Yum!

I didn't change a thing and we loved it. Quick, easy, delicious. I would recommend!

Chili powder has no place in this recipe - certainly not a full tablespoon. It complete overwhelms the rest of the flavors. Cayenne might be a good substitute. The garlic-lime marinade is awesome, however. We used beef tenderloin instead of pork chops, and they were great.

Excellent. I changed to Coho salmon, and added honey to the relish. Oh so good!

Very Good. Made the recipe as per the instructions. The pork chops were very tender and the relish was excellent. The relish could be used on chicken and fish. Used fresh ingredients from the farmer's market - what a difference.
