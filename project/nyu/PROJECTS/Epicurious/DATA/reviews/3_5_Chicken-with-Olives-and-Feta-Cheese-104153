This dish has tons of flavor! The sauce is delicious. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and would probably use bone in breasts next time. I'd love to try it with fish. I think that it would work well with cod. I'll definitely keep this recipe handy.

I cannot speak to the recipe as written, but I will say with a couple of modifications we enjoyed an excellent dish. While on vacation, out of necessity, I substituted white wine for the red wine called for in the recipe. Also, out of personal preference, I used fresh tomatoes, rather than canned. I believe the consensus of family members was that it was "delicious."

I found this recipe when looking for an old, favorite, very similar recipe originally printed in Gourmet.The Gourmet recipe uses crushed tomatoes in puree; no wine, no cheese. As a weight watcher, I serve it without cheese and over steamed cauliflower, zucchini or other steamed veggies.

Ive been making this dish, without knowing about this recipe, for years. Always used skinless, boneless thighs and canned tomatoes (the diced ones with garlic, basil and oregano). Always loved it. The extra addition of feta cheese is a very nice touch&who wouldve known you can improve a great recipe? Will make it like this from now on. The chicken is always moist, tender, and the sauce great with mashed potatoes or fresh, crusty bread.

This gets 4 forks as it was fairly quick, easy and very tasty. I followed the directions as stated. I think that next time I will definitely drain the tomatoes, as I had to uncover the skillet the last 10minutes of simmering, to thicken up the sauce. I served over Orzo and it was fabulous! Will not hesitate making this dish again.

We just got done eating this and we thought that it was sooooo great. I did not want to buy dried/fresh oregano for such a small amount that the recipe called for,so instead we added some fresh dill, we also used whole peeled canned tomatoes that we just crushed with our hands and added. this was an easy and inexpensive dish that I will make again!

Rating: 4
I really enjoyed this dish. I used chicken breasts on the bone which took about ten minutes longer to cook through. Next time I'll use boneless breasts for easier eating. I agree with draining the tomatoes to make the sauce a little thicker. I didn't have orzo so I used plain couscous which was delicious too but will try orzo next time since everyone raved about it!

Absolutely scrumptious. We tried this with thighs and again with breasts. The thighs are the best. Like others, I roasted plum tomatoes and used these. I also topped the dish with the feta and ran it under the broiler a bit. This was a big hit!

A terrific recipe - and I only made a couple of changes. I used boneless, skinless thighs for ease of eating. Also sauteed some fresh mushrooms after I took the chicken out of the pan. We've tried different cheeses - I like the feta but my boyfriend likes gruyere. Served with a haricot vert recipe from Bittman's "how to cook everything". One of our winter favorites!

I made this for my husband and a guest, and all three of us enthusiastically wiped our plates clean. I served with orzo, as suggested, drizzled in a bit of olive oil. I browned the thighs for the suggested time, but the skin was still a little soggy at the end. It wasn't a problem, I just pulled the skin off mine, but I think next time I'll just brown it a little more thoroughly to head off the soggy skin. Even with that, though, the chicken itself and the sauce were so delicious that it's got four forks! The cheese starts to melt with the heat of this tangy dish on the platter just before serving, and it becomes just exquisite.

My wife is from Bulgaria (the Bulgarian word for 'cheese'-'sirene'-means feta cheese!). We both found this recipe to be authentic and delicious and it will be a regular visitor to our table.

Made this as part of a Greek Feast for Easter. I dredged boneless, skinless breasts & thighs in seasoned flour and then braised in olive oil. Used leeks instead of onions. Otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe. Delicious! Found an almost identical recipe in one of my Greek cookbooks, which says this recipe is found in various forms throughout the Peloponnisos, so I think it is pretty authentic. I would definitely make it again.

I could not disagree more strongly with the review below. As an American living in Athens, I can testify that this dish is typical of wonderful taverna cooking--quick, full of robust flavors, easy and inexpensive. I know everyone has their own tastes, but please 1) do NOT substitute for the red wine, it is a necessary complement to the richness of the chicken thighs, 2) keep the skin on! Like the one below said, render out the fat before simmering, but the skin keeps the meat moist and is a wonderful flavor element and 3) DO NOT substitute fresh tomatoes for the canned. They won't give you the proper sauce base for simmering. Add them in at the end jusy before serving, but stick with good quality canned tomatoes. On a side note, I am spoiled here in Athens where I wander the markets and buy chicken that tastes like--chicken, not like the plastic tray of mass market supermarket birds. Spend the time (and unfortunately the money) to seek out a good butcher or specialty market with quality poultry. Ya sas, kali orexi! Tom

You will have to change and fix this recipe alot or you won't be happy. Try white wine, fresh tomatoes, sub some of the onions for shallots and add some red pepper for zip. This is not a very good recipe.

Outstanding. A note on the review below, if you brown the chicken sufficiently to render the fat the skin will be delicious. This is a European-style dish, if you don't like KFC-crisp skin, take it off before.

I was so impressed! I had this recipe at a fiends house and she told me where to find it. She went to culinary school so I was worried that I wouldn't compare but when I made it it turned out great!! Make sure to buy pitted olives though.

This was really good, especially considering the fact that it tastes like it should have been much more time-consuming to prepare than it actually was. I followed the recipe, but I used balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine, and used fat-free feta cheese because that is all I had on hand. I was making this for my parents, and my dad is a "foodie". He rated this a ten and he hasn't given that rating to any other recipe that I've made from this site except for the "Tropical Carrot Cake with Coconut Cream Cheese Frosting". You should try that one too...although not as a paring with this recipe! Yum!

This recipe was QTE, Quick, Tasty and Easy. I used skinless thighs since that's what I had on hand, doubled the garlic (if a little is good a lot is better) and added red pepper flakes and capers. I served over orzo as directed, very good.

Rating: 3
If you think this sauce is too thin strain the juice from the tomatoes. They will still give off some liquid as they cook and you can always add some back in if it gets to thick (unlikely). Definitely, up the amount of garlic and leaving chicken skin on when braising is always unappetizing and unnecessary. Finally, to pippininthefield: You forgot to tell us what you made for dessert, what wine you served, and what you did after dinner. Can you blather on a little more next time? Keep cooking!!

This is a keeper! It is easy to prepare, inexpensive (especially when the chicken thighs are on sale) and very flavorful. I served it with polenta and sauteed zucchini - so the meal was colorful and delicious.

I used boneless skinless thighs, added capers, green olives, doubled the garlic, and added fresh basil--delicious. It would have been equally good without the basil. I omitted the feta, because I had some leftover brown rice to use that I added a cup of feta, fresh chopped parsley, 1/2 cup of parmesan and three eggs to and baked for 45 minutes. This light, cheesy but mild dish was delicious served side by side with the bright acid flavor of the tomatoes and olives in the chicken. You could jazz it up with additional cheeses or make it a souffle by separating the eggs and beating the whites and adding in separately. Served with a plain green salad, my husband loved it! I have served it since for guests who raved over it.

Everyone I've served this chicken to loves it. I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs and I've adapted it to make in my crockpot. I do saute the onions and garlic first and have also found that the chicken shrinks less in the crockpot if it is browned first. Then I throw everything else in the crockpot, stir it and cook it for about 6 hours. The chicken is so tender, juicy and flavorful. This dish also freezes very well.

This was delicious! I made two substitutions though. I don't care for olives so used sliced mushrooms instead with boneless breasts replacing the thighs. A simple, no fuss dish that's ideal for a quick dinner. This one's a keeper!

This is one of my favorite recipes. I keep coming back to it and often pair it with Epicurious's Greek Potatoes with Lemon Vinaigrette, the latter of which has produced mixed results (possibly because of variations in the lemon juice??). Not so with the chicken. It's always tender and flavorful and adapts easily to a slow cooker which only makes it more succulent (For slow cooking: I used cubed boneless, skinless breast instead because it was on hand. I'm sure cuts with bones are even better. Try to use whole herbs and add the feta during the last hour, when you may choose to add a little more wine). Consider using shallots in place of onions for slight variation. Regardless of how you prepare it, this dish should be a hit with anyone who loves the flavors of feta, wine, and greek olives as I do.

The great thing about this recipe is that it really can be done two ways... without the feta (like chicken cacciatore (sorry about the spelling) and with feta as is (more Greek). I used a 28 oz can of tomatoes both ways, and just simmered it covered... Also, I cut up the chicken in chunks, to make it more stew-like during this freezing winter..

I made this on Saturday night for some friends after seeing some of the excellent reviews. The presentation was great and the dinner turned out pretty fabulous. I served the chicken with yellow saffron rice and a bottle of pinot noir. I added some crushed red pepper flakes and capers, which others had suggested and it was fine. It could have been a little less greasy, so next time (I will definately make this again) I am going to remove the skin and fat first. I don't see how this can hurt at all with all wonderful flavors flowing from this recipe.

Very nice.Although I think a lot more could be done with this recipe.I know food certainly does'nt have to be complicated to be great,but more could be done with the ingredients of this recipe.Perhaps through employing a different cooking technique,(Perhaps poaching the chicken,using a battoned out breast, as a'boudin'with minced onion,garlic and olives wrapped up in side?) or by adding a few compatable extras. Such as capers,which compliment the flavour of your olives, and change the overall 'taste sensation'. Or by using port instead of red wine can give it a bit more depth. I rated it '3' not because I am desperate to try it again in its current form.But because of its potential!

My Mave loved this dish! We had a romantic little dinner where I done this recipe and it was a great success! We did not need the extra cornstarch to thicken the sauce. This is definitely a winner!

This is easy and quick, and it had good flavor. However, the Wow factor wasn't there for me.

Fine for a family dish, but I wouldn't serve to company.

To the cook from Chicago: to make the dish less salty, use no-salt-added tomatoes, reduce the amount of olives slightly, and feta if necessary. Use a little plain goat cheese in place of some of the feta to reduce the salt. And be sure not to salt your chicken when you brown it, obviously. I am making this tonight, so I won't comment further.

My husband raved about this dish. He thought it was delicious. I'm not quite sure why I wasn't as enthused. Perhaps the chicken could have used some lemon.

I LOVE this recipe!! The great thing is that so does my husband. Another thing is that I usually don't eat olives but when the're cooked they have a totally different taste.

Made a very similar recipe last night. Mashed the feta with a tablespoon of butter and some herbs, then tucked the mixture under the skin of bone-in chicken breasts. Browned skin side down, removed, sauted onion, garlic. Deglazed with wine and broth. Returned chicken with olives to cook through, and reduced sauce before serving. Great! The cheese/butter mixture slowly melts, keeping the white meat perfectly moist, and adds a wonderful suppleness to the finished sauce. Guests never expected the feta cheese tang, but they loved it.

This an amazing and incredibly easy recipe. I, too, used boneless chicken breasts, and it turned out fine. My roommate and I were amazed at the way all the flavors melded together.

A fantastic dish and so easy to prepare on a weeknight! I used boneless, skinless breasts rather than the recommended thighs and the results were exceptional. I'd like to try it with dark meat next time, however. Next time I might also add mushrooms and capers, just because I LOVE the taste of olives and capers together. A similar chicken dish that I would recommend from Epicurious is CHICKEN BREASTS WITH LEEKS AND MUSHROOMS. Enjoy!

This is without a doubt one of the most delicious (and easy) recipes I have ever tried from Bon Appetit! The next time you want Coq Au Vin, make this instead! My husband doesn't get very excited over stew/cassoulet-type dishes, but he loved this one so much I've already made it four times! Here are a few suggestions: 1) take the skin off the thighs after browning and before stewing (the finished product doesn't suffer at all). Leaving them on makes the dish a little too oily; 2) I used herbes de Provence in place of oregano...I really enjoyed the addition of the extra flavors; 3) definitely serve over orzo...rice wasn't nearly as good. One last thing...I know all you fat-conscious folks will want to substitute breasts for the thighs. PLEASE DON'T!!!! I'm really not a big fan of dark meat either, but white meat would really take away from the earthiness of this dish. This would also multiply wonderfully for a crowd.
