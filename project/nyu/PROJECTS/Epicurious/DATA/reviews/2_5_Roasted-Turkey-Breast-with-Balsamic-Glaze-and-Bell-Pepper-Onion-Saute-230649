We liked this very much. Even my son who claimed he would only eat a drumstick had 3 slices. I used a 2.8 lb boneless breast and it actually took 1:10 minutes at 400 to roast. The vegetables were good too--I only had one bell pepper so I added 1/2 zucchini and two seeded chopped tomoatoes. The vinegar was very nice with this.

Easy and delicious. As in another review, I almost doubled the sauce. Easy and very tasteful. Served with mashed sweet potatoes.

This was really good. Simple to make. Even better the next day after the balsamic vinegar glaze soaks into the turkey.

This is a good, simple, low-fat dish. Next time I'll double the sauce. The onion/bell pepper mixture would also be very tasty on grilled bratwursts.
