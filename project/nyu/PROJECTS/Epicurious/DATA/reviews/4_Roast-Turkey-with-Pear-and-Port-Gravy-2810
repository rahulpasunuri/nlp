Very good recipe, but I thought the basting sauce was a bit weak. I added 1/3 cup Date Molasses, plus 3 TBSP Better Than Boullion Turkey Base to the mixture. FANTASTIC! You can buy the Turkey Base at Whole Foods, or go online to Better Than Boullion.

Delicious bird. It came out very moist and didn't even really need the gravy, although that was quite good, too. It won't replace our traditional Thanksgiving turkey but it could be a contender for Christmas.

Made this for Thanksgiving. It was ok. Kind of tired of the pear flavor. If making for a holiday that typically includes stuffing and mashed potatoes, keep in mind that people often put gravy on those as well. In other words, do you want all of your dishes to taste slightly of pear? It's too much.. That said, if for the meat only, it was ok.. Not great, but ok.

Oh! I love this turkey and the leek currant and sausage stuffing that accompanied the printed recipe. I have made this each and every Thanksgiving since 1992. To take turkey and stuffing to the level of Nirvana: fresh herbs, lots and lots and more fresh herbs and of course melted butter in the stuffing. Enjoy your Thanksgiving Day with your friends and family.

This is my favorite turkey recipe, made it two years in a row, took a break last year, but I'm going to make it again this year! It holds up very wll to minor changes, I've used apricot nectar as well. The sausage leek and currant stuffing is also excellent!

I have made this turkey for 4 thanxgivings, and it has become my absolute favorite turkey recipe. Do give time to reduce the sauce, but be assured that it is well worth it. I have served it with old vine zinfandel (one's with a port-like mouth feel) and Oregon Pinot Noir. The gravy has a very subtle sweetness, don't be scared away.

We served this to twenty people on Thanksgiving and it was universally loved.

This is an amazing turkey recipe. I made it for years and then we tired of it and tried some other recipes. Now I am back to it again. It is fabulous. I get my pear nectar at a health food store, by the way. The TP co-op for those in the DC area.

I was worried that the turkey and gravy might be too sweet, but they were perfect. Also, the glaze gave the turkey a beautiful deep brown color, great for presentation.

We enjoyed this recipe. The turkey and gravy had a pleasantly subtle sweet taste. I've recently been wondering why most of us rarely roast a turkey except during the holiday season. Turkey is well liked, cheap, easy and healthy - we should be roasting turkeys most of the year (and the turkey carcass can be used for soup).

I have made this recipe for about 4 years in a row now and never tire of the flavor. Finding pear nectar is not easy -- fortunately Goya makes one that is excellent. I have never made the stuffing but do make the glaze and the gravy. I recommend making as much gravy as you can with extra nectar. Add some chicken broth to thin out the gravy if necessary. It is fantastic on leftover turkey (if you have any) as well as on chicken or pork. Enjoy!

I tried this recipe this Christmas after reading the pros and cons and following the instructions as provided. My 17 lb. turkey was very tender and moist and with no with no overdone crust. My five guests raved. Actually, I had little left. I hardly make gravy but this time I did and everyone liked it. My advice is to use a good roast pan and there will be no need for to keep adding liquid and there will be lots of juice for gravy. I will make this over and over again. I served the turkey with both the dressing and the 1997 root vegetables followed with steamed ginver pudding and cranberry fool. A real smash.

I made this turkey for Thanksgiving this year and it turned out beautifully - brown skin and succulent, juicy meat (without brining) - everyone was raving about how moist the turkey was! The whole turkey was gone, leaving me with no left-overs for the first time! Only problem I had was, the broth and glaze were way too little as it burnt off very quickly - I had to keep adding broth/water to the bottom of the pan to keep all the nectar/sugar from burning.

To me turkey is all about the gravy. This gravy was yummy, although I have to put a however in here and the reason for that is this gravy is not traditional and is on the sweet side. It reminds me a little of the gravy my mom makes on her saurbraten. I would make this recipe again the stuffing was yummy!!

I've beem roasting turkey since I was a kid & helped my parents feed a large family. This is, beyond any doubt, the tastiest, most wine-friendly turkey I have ever encountered. I roasted a smaller turkey, following the directions for a convection oven, but otherwise was faithful to the recipe. This will be my standard Thanksgiving turkey from now on.

I made this one Thanksgiving and loved, loved, loved it. The pear and the honey add a sweetness to an otherwise savory dish. I am making this again; this time in a monthly friendly cooking competition I have with my fellow foodie friends. I'm playing to win.

I made this recipe (with the recommended stuffing) for the first time five years ago, and it's so good, I can't bear to try anything else!! The turkey turns out *even better* if you brine it first. I'm drooling at the thought of making it again in just a few short days for Canadian Thanksgiving. The Roasted Root Vegetables from March of 2001 are also a great accompaniment.

I've made this recipe every Thanksgiving for 4 years now. I shared it with friends and they all raved about it. Every Christmas I wanted to fix it for my family, but they weren't too sure about the port and pear combination. This year I finally talked them into it and they LOVED it! Now they're asking me for the recipe! Last Thanksgiving was the first time I made the gravy. WOW! It's great. This recipe is delicious, the turkey turns out moist and tender, and the accompanying stuffing is WONDERFUL, too. The port wine makes the turkey look a little pink when you first cut into it - scared us a little - we thought it wasn't done! I make sure to baste it every 20 minutes. Some may not like this idea, but I sink the turkey into a tub of cold saltwater for 8 hours prior to roasting. REALLY makes it more moist and tender. I even make this recipe other times of the year - that's how much I love it.

an amendment to my previous review from a year ago ... i received a heavenly set of all clad LTD pots and pans for christmas from my wonderful companion and when using these advanced instruments for culinary success the reducing of the glaze only took 35 minutes as opposed to the 1 1/2 hours it took when using my revolting less than gourmet quality saucepan.

Was this a good turkey. This was only my 2nd or 3rd time making a turkey and it turned out. Moist and a delicate sweet/savory flavor. And with the suggested dressing and gravey I have relived Thankgiving several nights in a row. I have added this to my list of recipes.

Delicious. Unlike other reviewers, my problem was that the skin browned too quickly (although tented completely) and looked burned by the time it was done. Regardless, everything tasted delicious - the gravy was marvelous.

Everyone loved it, I made with a wild rice stuffing and it was wonderful-will make it again next year. Everyone loved the gravy.

Superb recipe with spectacular gravy. Our 10 guests raved... I did uncover the turkey earlier than suggested to get a crisper skin based on one of the earlier comments and the result was not only a spectacular tasting bird, but a picture perfect one. Also now agree with another comment that one could start with less port and nectar to reduce time and quantity. The accompanying stuffing recipe is also very good, but also works well with simple mashed potatoes.

My search is over for the perfect Thanksgiving Turkey recipe! It was so simple (as far as Turkey recipes go) and very yummy! My family is still talking about it! I made it with the Sourdough Cherry stuffing and it was incredible!

Made this for the second time this year and got rave reviews from everyone again - especially for the stuffing and the gravy. Yum

I thought the gravy was excellent. I'm not sure that I'd glaze the Turkey again next time, because it made the skin less crispy (but it did taste great). Instead, I'd cook the turkey unglazed and just pour a little over at the very end. But the gravy was fabulous.

This is so good! I had a really big turkey and ran out of glaze for basting, so I would make twice the glaze next time, and I would add some broth to the pan right off the bat next time, because all that sugar does make for easy burning. And I agree with those who said that it takes longer than 40 minutes to reduce, but it smells so good that I didnt' mind that a bit. :^)

I've made this almost every year since it was first published in '92. There's a reason...it's GREAT!

I really love this recipe. I am not particularly fond of turkey but this recipe gives turkey some wonderful flavors. It also makes it very moist with the basting. My family loved it for Thanksgiving last year so I am making it again this year. Try it. I think that you and yours will enjoy it as well.

Incredibe recipe. Unfortunately I did not make the complete gravy due to my pan running out of liquid in the oven and the sauce on the bottom burning. (That's what I get for trying to get a shower before the guests come.) I just served the pear & port sauce by itself as gravy and it was great. I made a pear and cranberry stuffing to go with it and received rave reviews from everyone. This is a really nice alternative to a more traditional Thanksgiving type turkey recipe. I froze some of the left over sauce to go with a pork tenderloin.

This is the most sublime sauce for Turkey/chicken I have ever made, or tasted, in my many travels. It, by far, deserves a culinary award. By the way, my email is not sharpsoon, it is sharpspoon1@c4.com

I received rave reviews on the gravy. I had to admit that the port and pear nectar gave the gravy a wonderful taste. I didn't follow the recipe to the letter... and when I make it againg I might reduce the amount by a third. Reducing the pear nectar and port took much longer than :40 to be reduced to 2 cups... Make it the day before!

Splendid recipe. The pear nectar and port added a nice touch of sweetness that balanced the richness of the turkey and other sides. I used a rub of fresh rosemary, tarragon, and thyme on the breast below the skin -- which added some nice flavour.

Really fabulous turkey. Not too sweet but brings out the best flavors in the turkey. And, so very easy!
