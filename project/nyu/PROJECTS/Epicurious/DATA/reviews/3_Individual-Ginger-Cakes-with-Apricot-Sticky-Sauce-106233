This makes a wonderful cake, really moist and very gingery....but the sauce was just dreadful, skip it, put something else on this great cake.

Made this cake for my mothers birthday years ago - and took left-overs to friends at work who alos raived about it.. I've made it one time since and thought the receipe was lost for ever. It's great - make it!

This was came out beautifully and I will definitely make again. I substituted golden syrup as I had no molasses on hand. The sauce is outstanding. I used a "Spray 'n Cook" and had no problems getting the cakes out the tin.

Made these for New Years Eve dessert to rave reviews. Used regular molasses and it was fine. Didn't make sauce topped cakes with Ginger Creme Anglais instead which was perfect. It made 7 mini bundt cakes make sure you spray butter and flour as they do stick.

I was supprised at how light and airy these cakes were. I subsituted golden syrup for the light molases but I cut it back to 3/4 cup,next time I would add a bit more fresh ginger

These were a hit. I thought the sauce was going to be too sweet, but on the cake it was fabulous! I made the sauce a few days ahead of time and reheated, it was not a problem. I used homemade crystalized ginger (not much to do here in the winter...:-) This was the first time I used my garland bundt pan, and I ruined two of the cakes trying to unmold. Any suggestions? It was VERY difficult to butter all the crevices...

These were very tasty and moist, and the sticky sauce was GREAT. But I couldn't find light molasses, and thought the taste was a little too heavy when I used regular molasses. Anyone know of a good substitute?

Good desert for a big group. I would recommend making more of the sticky sauce.
