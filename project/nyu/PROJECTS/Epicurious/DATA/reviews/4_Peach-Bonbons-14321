Very very tasty. I modified it a tad - used dried cherries & port instead of brandy & raisins, which came out very well. I think it would be just as good without re-assembling the peach halves, and instead wrapping up peach halves with the raisin/butter mixture.

This is a wonderful dessert. We had this for Thanksgiving dinner last weekend and everyone wanted the recipe. It will be a family favorite. Surprised it has so few reviews.
