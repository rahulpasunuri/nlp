I used canned clams and bottled clam juice, as well as canned garbanzo beans. Turns out great each time. The flavors -- garbanzo beans, rosemary and clams -- go surprisingly well together.

Very good. Made it the easy way -- used canned garbanzo beans and canned clams.

Odd little recipe, but I thought it was quite good. A subtle and slightly unusual flavor and texture.

This was quite good. Not too much work but next time I am using canned chickpeas.

I actually followed the directions and thought it was a great rustic dish. Not overly complicated or fussy, just good food for a cool night. It does need a little s/p, but otherwise works fine as is. People, please don't use canned clams.

I made this using major shortcuts tonight-I sauteed the garlic, rosemary and red pepper flakes in the olive oil before adding a can of chickpeas with their liquid, AND I used canned chopped clams) and I also added a head of roasted garlic and it was a nice, easy, hearty, pretty delicious supper. I might add chopped tomatoes next time to jazz it up a little.
