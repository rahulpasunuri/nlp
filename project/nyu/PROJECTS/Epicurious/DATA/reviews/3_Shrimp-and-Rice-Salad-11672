This is a good basic recipe that lends itself to personal touches. I used basmati rice and added extra lime juice. I think that adding kalamata olives, green onions, cherry tomato halves, and feta cheese in any combination would give the salad that much more snap.

This shrimp and rice dish was a big hit. I did, however, use basmati rice instead of just plain long grain rice. It added a great flavor with the lime juice, garlic, etc.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much. It's quick, simple and flavorful. It's now on my recipe box and I'll make it again for sure!

I was really rushed on time so I used Uncle Ben's 5 minute rice. It worked out well. This recipe was easy and quick. It's a keeper.

A good make-ahead summer main dish. I have added fresh tomato wedges and sliced stuffed olives. Good with toasted french bread with butter and parmesan and a dry white wine. Serve on a bed of torn lettuce with extra salad dressing on the side.
