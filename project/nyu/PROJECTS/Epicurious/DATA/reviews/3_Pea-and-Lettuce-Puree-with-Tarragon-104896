A very delicate flavour... Served this with salmon.

This was an interesting side dish, but not a great one. Worth trying, certainly, but probably not worth trying twice.

Excellent; would make again. Mild yet inviting. Perfect spring dish. I took the advice to the reviewers and added on clove minced fresh garlic with the scallions.

I made this last year for Easter and had to come look up the recipe again on this site because my guests are asking for it this year, too. Very easy, fresh tasting and delicious. I especially like that I can do almost everything aheaad of time and spend more time with my guests.

When I presented the puree to my husband to try on a spoon he grimaced. He tried it and didn't gag so I continued to "tweak" it. I added some grated parmesan cheese and garlic powder with some more salt. After the "tweaking" he gobbled what was on the spoon. Next time I'll use fresh garlic. I must say, I was VERY impressed with the recipe and frankly, I didn't expect it to turn out so well. Bravo epicurious! You tamed my veggie hating beast!

Delicious and very, very easy, this recipe is a must for veggie lovers! Takes no time to make, is simple to clean up, and keeps very well in the fridge. Even yor children who refuse green vegetables will like this...

This was very easy and very tasty. All of my Easter guests commented on it, and my 19 month old daughter couldn't eat enough of it! If you don't have fresh tarragon on hand, don't worry, it's good even without it. I made 2 batches, one with and one without tarragon, and the difference was minimal. Next time I'm going to try it with garlic.
