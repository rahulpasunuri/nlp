I warmed the honey up in microwave and it was soupy when I blended the pecans in. I poured the pecans on a cookie sheet covered with foil and drizzled half the sugar on. Baked in the oven according to the directions. They turned out as good as the recipe is. I was trying to figure out the recipe for some store bought honey roasted pecans but this one was not it. But they are still delicious. I would suggest quickly taking them off the foil once out of the oven. I let them sit a couple minutes to long before I removed them and the foil was difficult to peel off once the honey began to solidify.

As others noted, the recipe needs a little tweaking. I used blossom honey, mixed it with some chopped chili flakes, a little balsamic, some black pepper, mixed it all up, put it on a sheet, sprinkled with sugar. Then added to a spring greens, pear gorgonzola salad and added more pepper, and drizzled with a little more balsamic. absolute rave reviews.

I made these twice - once with honey, and once with maple syrup - and the maple syrup was much better. The honey burned easier, and the maple syrup did not...I used real maple syrup. I also just sprinkled brown sugar and white sugar over the top - much more than the recipe called for, and they came out very nice and crunchy, not sticky. The ones with honey were much stickier, and I followed the recipe exactly.

I tried this recipe with maple syrup instead of honey, and it worked great. Just reduce the total cooking time to about 10 minutes so they don't burn.

Delicious. Be sure to use a cooking sheet with sides as the honey runs. You want to cook these just to the point where you wonder if they're burning. This ensures that the nuts are crunchy, not chewy, and fully glazed.
