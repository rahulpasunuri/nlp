didn't have quite enough un-torn phyllo left for this recipe as is so I lined the pan with phyllo in the traditional manner (butter between the layers), a layer of pistachio mixture, poured the custard in, and then folded the top of the pastry over. It was amazing. With the honey and phyllo it reminded me very much of baklava so I characterize this as a kind of middle eastern cheesecake. It got rave reviews from the entire household.

This recipe was good and easy to make. I made a mistake with the wrapping in my first batch. I folded the phyllo sheet twice to make mini-triangles. The triangles looked nice but the phyllo was too thick in the end and it almost seemed the phyllo didn't cook properly. But when I folded the phyllo the way it was described in this recipe, it turned out much better. I also omitted the nuts because my husband is allergic to them. Instead of grated orange peel, I used lemon zest instead. It was very yummy!!

This was the first think I've ever made, my mom made me do dinner and desert, it turned out great! When my dad took it for lunch the next day his coworker tasted it and asked for the recipe.

Great dish for nutty dessert lovers. Similar to Baklava but less rich and easier to make.
