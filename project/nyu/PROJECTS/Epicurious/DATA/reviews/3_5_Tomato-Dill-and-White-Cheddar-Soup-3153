I agree: one 28oz can of diced tomatoes and two cans of broth is perfect and plenty for 6 people as a first course. I increased the cayenne to 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp of sugar and some black pepper. We swear by Breakstone's light sour cream, but not the non-fat.

This is a great and easy recipe. I add more dill because it really gives it a wonderful flavor. Its works well for dinner with a salad and on a snowy day with grilled cheese sandwiches.

12/25/2008 - I made this as the soup course for Christmas dinner. Based on the reviews I tweaked the recipe by adding 2 tablespoons of sugar and about 1 teaspoon salt. I bought high quality imported Italian canned tomatoes. This recipe would serve as many as 20 as part of a meal. I halved the recipe for 5 of us and could have served 5 more.

Sounded like an awful lot of soup to me. I used one 28-ounce can of San Marzano tomatoes and 2 cans chicken broth. Perfect amount. Pureed the soup with my "boat motor" right in the pot. Added a little extra cayenne pepper - we like hot stuff. Delicious, quick and easy. Would make it again.

"Terrific"? ... nah. Not worth the effort (and I'm willing to expend a whole lot of effort for good results).

I'm in agreement with the other reviewers that this recipe needs "doctoring up" by adding significantly more cayenne and including 2-3 teaspoons of sugar. In addition, I added 3 medium cloves of garlic. My other comment would be that this recipe could feed 10-12 people not the 6 that it suggests. I would make it again but it would not be on my top 10 soups for guests.

I loved this soup! It was so easy to make too. I served it with the grilled cheddar cheese and ham sandwich recipe. What a great combination.

I've made this soup at least 10 times since it first appeared in print. It is a perfect winter tomato soup, for when fresh tomatoes are unavailable. I disagree with the complaints that it is bland, but then I find that I must add extra pepper (both cayanne and black) to almost all recipes.

I agree that this soup was somewhat tart. I added 1 tsp. sugar and almost 1 tsp. cayenne pepper. This made all the difference!

Very good. Took head at the bland comment and used half leeks and half onions- but only about 3 1/2 cups. I also added some chopped garlic and a pinch of sugar. By itself the soup is good, but tart. The cheese balances the flavor and makes it wonderful!

This is a wonderful tomato soup! It has a nice spice. Make sure to use sharp white cheddar cheese. DELICIOUS!

This soup lacked flavor (and I absolutely love tomato soup). It seems anytime canned tomatoes are used (particularly as the main ingredient), everything tastes pretty much the same. Perhaps I'll try it again, but I'll definitely use fresh tomatoes.

Be sure to salt and pepper this soup. It could also benefit from a pinch or two of sugar.
