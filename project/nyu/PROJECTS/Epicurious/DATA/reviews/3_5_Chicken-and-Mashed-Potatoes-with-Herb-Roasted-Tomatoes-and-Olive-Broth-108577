This recipe is exactly the reason I love to cook. It was fun and enjoyable. Everything came together beautifully. The broth was heavenly. I paired mine with Potato-Silk-with-Truffle-Oil-107713 off epicurious which in and of itself is a food lovers experience. Make this for someone special so that you can enjoy that person eating it. What a great dinner!

I do agree that it's time consuming, but it could be broken down to steps. It is very impressive and tasty if you are planning on entertaining guests

This recipe is a lot of work (I think it took me over 2 hours) but really delicious and well worth the effort. The solids are so yummy and I followed other reviewers' advice and kept them in. I thought they made the presentation even better. I can't wait to make this recipe again (probably for a special occasion as it is quite time consuming to prepare).

Awesome dish. Had it to celebrate a birthday and all in attendence raved at the taste and the presentation. The olive broth was so good that the guests kept dipping their fingers in it. Great recipe...definently keep the solids and serve them in a seperate dish so the guests can dish them onto their plate as desired.

Delicious. The only change I made was to omit the fennel (didn't have any on hand) and to use a few TBS of the solids to top the chicken (as many of you wisely suggested!). Also, I will reduce the olive broth down a bit more next time to avoid soupy mashed potatoes!

Didn't make this yet, but to the reviewer below...you had a mixture of 3.5 cups of broth plus ~3.5 cups of sauteed onions and fennel. The directions say to reduce the *mixture* down to 3.5 cups. Hope this turns out ok for me -- I make the world's worst mashed spuds no matter what recipe I follow!

I, too, kept the solids in the broth, but was confused, the recipe calls for 3 1/2 cups of chicken broth and then says to reduce mixture until there is 3 1/2 cups? A lot of work, and the best thing about it was the garlic mashed potatoes.

My entire family thought this dish was just so-so. It was a lot of work for very little flavor.

I've cooked this a number of times and eveyone I've cooked it for has loved it. Like the earlier reviewers, I left the solids in the broth and, in my current incarnation of the dish, I've modified the broth into a sauce with spinach, diced tomatoes, and feta. The mashed potatoes are excellent, but the dish can be prepared with cooked orzo as well. I highly recommend this.

I can't rate this, but as written it sounds wonderful. However, the night I planned to made it, I unexpectedly was left with 1/2 hour to cook and I want to thank the creator of this recipe for the ingredient combinations. The olives and the tomatoes and some of the spices are wonderful as a salad with lemon and olive oil and a little feta. The chicken breasts are wonderful sauteed with the onions and the fennel with a little lemon, olive oil, chicken broth and thyme, then served on top. The spinach, wilted, made a lovely side dish. I only wish I had time to make the potatoes!

i really liked the combination of flavors. it was a great hit with my guests. next time, i think i'll pound the chicken a bit before cooking.

This is excellent...very flavorful. I did not strain the broth. The olives, spinach and fennel are excellent, and I think that straining and discarding them is unneccessary.

Really tasty combination, impressive, and not difficult. Like other reviewers, I hated the idea of throwing out those kalamatas after 1 minute in broth. I pureed a little more than half as suggested, but I'm not sure that was the best way to go. The color is not appealing. Next time I'd just leave solids in broth.

Excellent recipe. I did strain the broth and felt like it was a lot of work to throw it all out. The broth had a grat flavor though. Next time, I'll hang on to it and see what we think.

Rave reviews from family and guests. Instead of draining broth, dumped into blender and osterized to a smooth texture. Excellent.

Excellent! Didn't strain broth either. Tasted wonderful.

This was excellent. We enjoyed this dish last weekend and I would only change one thing. The receipe calls for the broth mixture to be strained and never used again. We tasted the mixture and it was really good. The fennel was not too strong and it added a little extra flavor to the chicken when we put some on the side of the dish.
