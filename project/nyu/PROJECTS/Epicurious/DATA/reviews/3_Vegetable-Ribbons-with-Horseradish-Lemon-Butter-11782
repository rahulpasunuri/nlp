This dish just didn't do it for me. Basically you're just eating vegetable skins. The horseradish butter wasn't bad though. I might try it with tiny baby squash and carrots in the spring.

A delightful low fat vegetable dish. Dresses up any dinner plate with its delicate shapes and colors. I have served it several times and guests are always amazed at its simplicity, beauty and delicate taste. I think it's best with fish because it's so light.

I had to makes 8 servings for Christmas Eve dinner so making all the shredded ribbons was not great. Also, plan on what to do with the leftover veges or else you waste a lot. My guests liked it and thought it was an interesting presentation but I wasn't crazy about it and I love vegetables. Probably will not make it again.

It's so easy to win points on presentation with this dish. It can be arranged quite beautifully with such brightly colored vegetable ribbons. The light flavor is also a treat.
