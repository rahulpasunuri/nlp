Better with butter instead of crisco! I also used brown sugar in place of white. SImple tasty cake, moist, easy to eat. Ideal for breakfast or snack time. My 2.5 year olds even like it. This time I stirred in a diced ripe pear with the raisins to make me feel like it has some health benefits.

This spice cake was great! Taking the advice of the other reviews, I added more cloves and cinnamon. I did not think it was too dry, and next time I will make it with a frosting of some sort.

This is more of a tea cake than a dessert cake -- drier and less rich. Still, it's quite pleasant when you want something sweet but not intense. I used chopped dates instead of raisins, and I also asked added walnuts, which was fine.

I added extra spice (more clove and some ground ginger) and it still wasn't enough. It also is dry and crumbly and a slice of it doesn't stick together. I also added about 3/4 cup walnuts, which added some crunch and texture. It needs about 1/2 cup more raisins.

It is wonderful! So spicy and smells wonderful in the oven. I make it easier by using oil (why cream shortening when you don't have to?) and I increase the spices slightly to get that wonderful spicy smell. Extra raisins make it sooooooooooo good. Definitely a keeper to make again and again

This is a very flavorful cake but bit too crumbly for my taste. I would have liked it a lot more if it was more moiste. Considering how easy it was, I will make again but with perhaps a bit more oil?
