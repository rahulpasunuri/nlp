Definitely going onto the to-make list ! This reminds me of an exquisite crisp I ate at the Wooden Monkey in Halifax. They used Haskap berries though. Oh so good !

I have made so many different varieties of berry, peach, apple tarts, cobblers, crisps and this recipe was by far one of the best. I used the straight cornmeal for the biscuits. Next time I will double it. Absolutely delicious!

When cooking with medium grind polenta, I find that it helps to soak the grain for a while before cooking - even for overnight. Use the liquid called for in the recipe. If you try to bake this without soaking the end result can be gritty.
