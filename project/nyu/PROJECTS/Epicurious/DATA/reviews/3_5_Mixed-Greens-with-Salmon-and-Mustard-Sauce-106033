I was surprised how good this was. It's results would depend upon using the best dijon and olive oil you can get your hands on. Forget the first half of the recipe.I grilled the salmon and the results were better than the poaching. Grill some asparagus while you are at it!!! Too healthy!

My dinner plan for cold salmon and a salad became Mixed Greens with Salmon and Mustard Sauce when I searched epicurious.com recipes! I could only respectfully offer two suggestions; either reduce the bouillon covered, boiling, or uncovered, simmering, as it reduces too fast if left uncovered and boiling; the carrots have to be served along with the salmon, please. Made my hot summer day!
