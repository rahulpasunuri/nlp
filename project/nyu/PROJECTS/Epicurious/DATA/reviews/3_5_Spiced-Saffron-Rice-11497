Quite a nice accompaniment to a spicy curry. I followed the recipe as written and it was just fine.

Easy and delicious. I skipped the boiling saffron separately step and just through the threads after I'd added the rice. Came out great.

Making rice without a rice cooker was a first for me and the results are well worth the effort. I used Jasmine rice and, unfortunately, could not find two of the spices at the supermarket: cloves and cardomom. I imagine the dish would have gotten four forks with those additions. The ratio of water and spices to rice is perfect though.

I liked the previous reviewer's variation (coconut milk adds a nice flavor), but agree with other reviewers that the recipe is fine as it is. Don't worry if you are missing one or two of the spices - whatever combination of cinnamon stick, bay leaf, whole cloves, and/or cardamom pods you have makes a terrifically fragrant rice that goes with just about anything.

This recipe makes things WAY too complicated. Here's how to get a great rice dish without so much effort. in a medium saucepan put 3/4 c water + 1/2 c. coconut milk on to boil. Add 3 cloves, 1 cardamom pod, 1/2 cinn stick, salt, a few black peppercorns, a bay leaf, and a pinch of saffron. When this all boils, add 1 c. of basmati. Put the lid on, turn the heat to LO and wait 20 min. Voila! Perfect spiced rice. Pick out the spices, which will be on top, fluff with a fork, and serve. For something extra special melt a little ghee to pour over the top. It's really great mixed with yogurt. Or add a handful of raisins into the boiling liquid and when the rice is done add a handful of cashew pieces too. The things you can do with this recipe are endless. A bit of shredded coconut is also yummy too. Have fun!

I thought this rice was delicious. I served it with the orange chicken with golden raisins and figs from this site--what a tasty combo!

I took one look at this and said too many pans and too time consuming. So I opted for some shortcuts. I bought saffron rice and when I boiled it I added ground cinnamon and ground caramom with milk. Didn't have any cloves so it was omitted from the recipe. The rice came out great! All of my guests loved it and with these short cuts it took no time to make. Although I would recommend using whole milk instead of the skim I used (too watery) or perhaps substitute heavy cream instead? I served this with tandori chicken, braised eggplant with red peppers and some Naan bread. The entire meal was a success especially when we ate the rice with Bonacchi's Chianti Riserva 1997. I would definitely make this again!

There wasn't anything about this dish that I liked. It had a strange metallic flavor. I'm a fan of cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and rice...I can't quite understand why it wasn't good.

I also served this with the Braised Lamb with Spinach, and used (unwashed) Basmati rice. A terrific combination!

I first served this with the Braised Lamb and Spinach on the complete _Gourmet_ menu. I have made it several times since because it is so marvelous. I used Basmati rice. In a recent _Cook's Illustrated_ article, I read that it is not necessary to wash Basmati rice, so I didn't. The dish turned out beautifully.
