I used purchased salsa verde and homemade corn tortillas from Trader Joe's. The recipe worked fine...and the blender stayed clean. There's something off-putting about boiling tomatillos and running the blender the first thing in the morning. Anyway, I'm looking for a great recipe for huevos rancheros, and this one comes pretty darn close.

I did not make the eggs, just the verde sauce, and it was delicious. I have made this sauce to go with fajitas and burritos. It is versatile and has a refreshing flavor, great for summer and grilled spicy meats.

This is a good breakfast, but in the end it seemed like more trouble than it was worth. I enjoyed it, but the flavors didn't meld and take off in a way that I hoped.

This recipe really surprised me. Usually I know what things will look and taste like. The sauce is a vivid green before cooking. This is a great recipe. I really liked it served with extra warm tortillas, cilantro sprigs and sliced jalapenos. I think you could make this for a big group by making the tortillas and eggs slightly in advance on the cookie sheet and then heating them in the skillet with the sauce and cheese as people wake up.

This is wonderful, a great breakfast dish. I used the leftover sauce on grilled chicken breasts with jack cheese.
