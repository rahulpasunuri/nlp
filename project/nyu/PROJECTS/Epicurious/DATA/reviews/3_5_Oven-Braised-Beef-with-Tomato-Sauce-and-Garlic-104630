I made this today with a 3 1/2 lb roast. I did brown it but followed the recipe after that. I made it in a 5 qt Le Creuset which I think kept it very moist. I cooked it for 3 1/2 hours and the house smelled fantastic. Served it with mashed potatoes and carrots that I steamed and put in the tomato sauce. So easy and so good!

This recipe was beyond bland. Even tho I took the advice of some reviewers and seared the roast, inserted the garlic cloves in slits, added red wine and italian seasoning it was essentially flavorless. I tried to salvage the dish by adding beef broth, kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to the juices to no avail. The meat was incredibly tender after 5 hours in my slow cooker but again, I was terribly disappointed by the lack of flavor.

I will never cook a pot roast any other way. May I add that we re-purpose any leftovers as a savory meat sauce? Two four-fork meals in one. TRY IT as written!

This is a great, adaptable recipe for a lazy cool day that I have made for more than 6 years. I saute onions in the pan first; add red wine to de-glaze after browning the beef, but before the addition of tomatoes; then fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, whatever I have), and ALWAYS lots of garlic. I've added sauteed mushrooms on occasion, if I had them. It's all good. I serve this with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed carrots, sourdough bread. So easy, so good.

Made this a couple of years ago and my notes said it was easy and excellent. Recipe surfaced the other day just as fall was getting started and decided to try it again. Couldn't believe it was so simple. Meat comes out so tender and there's lots of flavor with hardly any ingredients. I used a can of whole tomatoes and just chopped them with scissors instead of hauling out the food processor. I like chunky soups. Next time I make this I will add some mushrooms and onions and herbs, just to be different. Great starter pot roast as is.

I loved this pot roast with very small changes. I cut deep slits in the chuck roast and stuffed them with garlic cloves. I then seared the roast on both sides before topping it with the tomatoes, sprinkling it liberally with Italian seasoning, and braising in a 300 degree oven for 5 hours. I then carmelized 2 onions, adding 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms at the end. All of it was then transferred to a crockpot to transport to a Pot Luck where we set it on "high" for one hour, switching to "warm" until served. It was fall apart tender and very yummy! None was left to take home.

Had made this once before and was inspired by a similar "greek" pot roast recipe. So I browned a 4-lb chuck roast, and added 1 Tb dried oregano to the tomatoes and garlic-all in the crockpot. Crumbled feta cheese and chopped parsley to put on top were great additions. I gave it a little higher rating for the easy:good balance. Just fine as is, with many options!

I followed some suggestions from my fellow cooks/chefs & this is how I made this dish: I seared the meat first, threw in some onions as I was sauteeing the meat, took it off the heat, added canned diced tomatoes, approx 1/2 cup red wine, 1/2 cup beef broth, a about 2 T worcestershire sauce. Oh, I did rub the meat with Emeril's Essence before searing - thought it might "kick it up a notch", I know, I know...All in all, thought it was good, my man loved it. The sauce does come out a bit runny but maybe follow another suggestion to thicken up with cornstarch if you prefer more thickness. Not bad, but not fantastic. That's my opinion anyway.

Like the other reviewers, I added garlic, onions, carrots, celery and fresh oregano to the mix. At 300 degrees for 3 1/2 hours it came out moist, tender and cooked throughout. Next time I will probably cook it for just a little less time to assure some pinkness in the center. Truly a good dish!

I don't feel okay rating this recipe, because I always add additional ingredients (dried funghi porcini, red wine, rosemary, thyme, onions, et cetera) but note that I said "always". This recipe is the jumping-off point for my now-standard pot roast -- the cooking time and temp are just perfect. I literally cannot keep the leftovers around for more than twelve hours, even if I use half the cow. I have learned not to ask my hubby what he wants for dinner... he always gets this wheedling look and says "Pot roast...?" Every time.

This recipe was so easy and so tender. I cooked it in the crock pot as other had suggested and added some onion salt and pepper to the pot, pureed the tomatoes and garlic and it was perfect. Served over garlic and dill mashed potatoes with green beans. Yum!

How can something this easy taste this good? I was skeptical, but tried it anyway. I served this on mashed potatoes. I also added extra garlic cloves and cooked it all day on low in a crock pot while I was at work. I rarely give a four fork rating, but considering the excellent results from almost no work in the kitchen, this one's got it.

I would definately make this again. I added 6 peeled garlic cloves, 1t dried thyme, 1t dried oregano, half an onion, and tons of salt and pepper to to food processer with the tomatoes. So easy. Just pour over roast and cook. The meat was very tender and the sauce gave it good flavor. I served with orzo and green beans and just put the tomato sauce on that as well. I think there are better roast recipes for company, but for and easy, good family meal-this hits the spot. I think I may add some red wine to the sauce next time.

A solidly good dish. I seared the meat on all sides and then browned onions in the drippings and deglazed with a bit of beef broth and added that to the pot. I peeled the garlic, used canned crushed tomatoes and fresh herbs (thyme, oregano, rosemary) from the garden. Cooked in the crockpot for 6 hours, but next time I'll cook it on low, it became a bit tough. The sauce was great, though I did add worst. sauce and thickened with some cornstarch before serving. A nice basic dish you can add to or make as is.

Looking for a recipe suitable for the crock pot, I found this. It turned out perfectly even after a long day cooking. I too peeled the garlic before adding and used canned organic crushed tomatoes. My non-beef eating husband put the sauce on pasta and ate that for dinner instead of the roast.

I'm not a big meat eater, but considering the simplicity of the recipe and all the varying opinions, I had to try it. I followed the recipe pretty closely, used chopped canned tomatoes instead of pureeing, and added fresh thyme. It turned out very well, was easy to make and required very little clean-up. This technique would probably work with many types of roast or even chicken.

Superb, with additions nicked from other reviewers. Did the pokey-garlic thing, browned the beast, then added wine, worcheshire, massive handful of fresh herbs, chopped tomatoes (frozen from last summer's garden). Let it cook 4 hours or more. Everyone raved. Kids had it again next night when we went out; babysitter polished off the meat. Used the sauce over pasta. Perfect.

I substituted a breast of veal and it was terrific. Also took another reviewer's recommendation and added carmilized onions and mushrooms (I used portobello)forty-five minutes before serving.

I followed portions of advice from the other more experienced cooks. I added slivers of garlic to the meat before searing it and slow roasted it at a lower temperature. The flavor and tenderness of the meat was great. I pureed the tomatoes in the pan with the meat before serving it. All in all, it was wonderful.

Rating: 4
Yummy - that would be my word to describe this dish. I admit I made a few enhancements.....seared the meat which I had actually cut into 4 big chunks.....used a head of roasted garlic, added seasonings like many others and some wine and cooked at a lower temp....then about 45 minutes before it was finished took the meat out of the sauce and roughly shredded it, added the meat back to the sauce along with a generous supply of sliced mushrooms...... Only negative was my company cancelled so I have lots of leftovers....guess I'll find out how well it freezes.

This recipe looks very similar to the recipe from Decebmber 2002 "Italian pot roast w/Tomato sauce" a few more ingredients but basically the same. I found that searing the meat on all sides first as well as carmelizing the onions adds 2 more layers of delicious flavour.

Rating: 3
To inhance the flavor of the roast I cut slots in the meat and stuffed extra garlic in the roast, let it stand over-night in the refrigerator. This makes the flavor of the roast very, very good. the slots should be about 1" deep. make several slots. (12) is good, more if you like garlic, less if not.

I liked this prepared according to the directions, but the second time I made it, I found the following adjustments made a huge difference in flavor... sear meat before adding the other ingredients, add Italian seasoning, worcestershire, and sliced onion.

My local butcher recommended shoulder instead of chuck roast and it turned out great. Why would anyone use whole canned tomatoes then crush in a food processer. The recipe should just say a can of puree tomatoes to avoid confusion of novice cooks like me who follow directions to the T.

This recipe made me look like a rock star! VERY simple but turned out really well. I did take past advice and peeled the garlic, and added some red wine and worstersher sauce. I used a chuck roast from a drop calf my dad had raised which I was a bit worried about. The calf was a tad older than it should have been when he had it butchered but it came out very tender. It also only took 2 hrs to cook since it was more of a big steak than a roast (1 1/4 inches thick). Who knows why they cut it that way at the butcher shop but I don't care - my in laws now think I'm the greatest cook! AND I'm not afraid to cook beef anymore which I had been in the past. It's too easy to ruin and have tough chewy meat.

Ok, so some think this is missing something. ANY recipe can have more steps or ingredients added to it; the beauty of this is that it's so simple. With just these 3 ingredients, you can know how it will taste before you make it. We liked it a lot. My husband(who is from Mexico and likes spicy foods as much as you might imagine)also liked this precisely for its simplicity and purity of flavor. Having said that, I did peel the garlic before adding, making it a cinch to smash the cooked garlic into the sauce at the end, thus seasoning it with nothing else but salt and pepper before bringing it to the table. This makes enough sauce to serve over pasta the next day. The essence of comfort food.

I made this dish mostly according to the directions, except that I doubled the quantity of and peeled the garlic (I'm not sure why one wouldn't). The meat came out flaky and tender, but the taste was bland. So, I took a portion of the finished product and, based on others' recommendations, I added McCormick Italian spices and worcestershire sauce, and the flavor significantly improved. The meat, however, remained bland flavored, though this might be fixed the next time if I add the additional flavors at the very beginning. Next time I also might substitute pork to get a more flavorful recipe. Of course, this means it would be a completely different recipe. But I wouldn't cook it as the recipe calls for it again.

I also used bottom round and peeled the garlic. We like to make this with Italian seasoned tomatoes, and then slice up the meat and toss some angel hair pasta into the sauce at the end. Yum! Great for next-day leftovers.

Based on all the "heated" reviews, I had to give this dish a try. I also used bottom round roast (a better cut). Some advice: make sure you trim the fat off well, because it's a yummy sauce and it it ends up too greasy, you'll be sorry. Canned tomatoes work just fine (especially if you get the seasoned kind), double the garlic and peel it for sure, add onions and any spices you love (Italian goes well), and of course take everyone's advice about worctershire & red wine...no need to measure, just generously pour in. If you experiment, have fun, and try different reviewers' suggestions, you'll end up with a great dish; if you make it simply "as is", for some reason it ends up kinda like my grandmother's good old Jewish Brisket. Have fun, and yes...it's OKAY to experiment and have fun. It's not such an expensive meal that you cry if you screw it up!

Made this for Father's Day....HEAVENLY! Took the advice of other reviewers and seared the meat first and added 2 Tbsp. Worcestershire to the tomato juices. After 4 hours, I took the meat out and separated into big chunks and put it back in the oven at 275 degrees for the last 45 minutes so that the meat would soak up the flavor of the delicious juice and added baby carrots. Four adults and two children devoured the entire 3.7 lb roast!

To Carol Bunagan: pot roast requires "slow and low" cooking...set your oven to 350-degrees, you can even go as low as 300-degrees. Personally, I would brown all sides of the roast in a ovenproof skillet first (medium heat on your cooktop, season with salt and pepper and brown in 2T or 3T olive oil), then deglaze the pan with red or white wine and continue with the recipe using the same skillet (covered) to braise the roast in. Browning the roast first will help keep the juices "locked in", additionally the browned bits will add flavor to the sauce.

I made this roast and it smelled wonderful while cooking. We had an unusually late dinner and were famished by the time we ate and thought the roast tasted like the nectar of the gods. I have never made it again as my husband is sure it could never taste as good as it did the first time. After reading all the other reviews I would like to say I do appreciate all the comments on the recipe as it appears. However, if you change so many ingredients that it is really no resemblance to the original and then decide you hate it - well, keep it to yourself.

Here's another way to spice up a roast. This recipe is somewhat like a dish my mother-in-law made. She would add about 1 or 2 cups spicy bbq sauce and sliced onions to the tomatoes and garlic and serve it with mashed potatoes. I thought it was strange when she made this dish but now this is how I make my pot roast. We have fond memories of her everytime we have this for dinner. I miss you Phylis!

We love this recipe. I've made it to the letter as well as with some additions recommended by previous reviewers -- thanks for the inspiration! I have always unpeeled my garlic because garlic is wonderful and the baked pieces are so good smeared on rolls with the sauce. It's a great recipe as is or with some help. Tastes great and leaves me free to do other things.

Yay, New Jersey! and no, I don't drive 54 in the left lane, but I do use most recipes as a starting point. I take a basically good idea and tailor it to my family's preferences; so if it turns out awful, it's usually my fault. And if it looks like something that would not be to our taste, I won't waste my time with it. It's pretty easy to see what works for you upon reading the recipe. These reviews are the best part of Epicurious!

Delicious and effortless. I took the suggestion of adding some red wine and basil. I also uncovered it for the last 1 1/2 - 2 hours to thicken the sauce. I just made sure to baste it often in the end. Incredible! Threw it over pasta with a big hunk of beef on top! YUM. My husband was ranting and raving at how good it was! I had 4 people over for dinner and the meat was gone. The whole dinner was devoured. Thanks for yet another great recipe I'll make again and again.

Our good friend Bob, who is a great cook, bragged about this dish to me, my husband and other friends. Well we got a chance to experience it a couple of weeks ago along with a dish of gnocchi! Wow!

To the Brooklyn cook: Ymm. Your rendition is simply the best "Oven Braised Beef with Tomato Sauce and Garlic" I've ever tried.

How 'bout in your case?

This has become my husband's most-requested dish, and I love it, too. I enjoy reading the on-going reviews -- a sort of pot roast soap opera! I don't have a use for left-over sauce, because there isn't any. I fine-tune the recipe a bit, for our tastes, similar to what others have suggested. Instead of chuck roast, a bottom round is our favorite. It will still slice into beautiful, meltingly tender slices. Add 28 oz. can Italian plum tomatoes with juice (San Marzano are good) -- I squish them up a little with my fingers; splash in some dry red wine, like Chianti; strew the garlic over the top -- definitely prefer it peeled. I agree with some others that a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce are good; then grind a generous amount of black pepper over the top; throw in some whole sprigs of fresh basil; put a lid on and cook it in a slow oven (like 275 or 300 tops) for 5-6 hours.

This smelled divine and tasted very good. It needs aggressive seasoning with salt and pepper, but those round out the flavors nicely. My roast let off a huge amount of liquid, so the sauce turned out to be soupier than I would have liked. While my wife and I ate, I reduced the sauce for when we have the leftovers. You cannot beat the simplicity of this recipe.

Just wanted to respond to my fellow Minnesotan (Iron Range) and to New Jersey. I really appreciate hearing about the improvisations people make to a recipe, and would not want to discourage that.

Besides being tasty comfort food, this recipe transfers VERY well to the crockpot, also. Just throw everything in before leaving for work in the morning and set on low. When you come home, dinner is ready! I've also thrown baby potatoes in for a more well balanced meal-in-a-pot effect and it works too. Just make a salad and butter some rolls and you've got a hearty husband-pleasing meal!

After all the hype this recipe has stirred up, I just HAD to give it a try. I did NOT make the recipe to the letter, but I was close. I peeled my garlic (took all of 2 minutes) and added a couple of splashes of red wine and some Worcestershire (maybe 2 tablespoons or so). Go easy on the salt if you use Worcestershire. This is wonderful. Melts in your mouth. I chose a good, well-marbled piece of beef and cooked it lots longer than it said (at 300 degrees F.) and the result was rich, tender and wonderful, with a fantastic sauce. I would serve this not only to my (wonderful) dog, but to my dearest friend or to the queen. It's lovely.

Yes, it's nothing spectacular or amazingly tasty, but it's very good. It's a good meal that is incredibly easy (and inexpensive) to make when you have a million other things to do around the house. The simple flavors are what make it a delicious dish, which is sometimes a nice change of pace.

Just to be fair to the people who write and publish these recipes...I'd like to remind people who comment negatively to certain dishes that after you tweak it, adding a little bit of this and a little bit of that, this ingredient and that ingredient, and sometimes changing the cut of meat or ingredients completely, the recipe is now a COMPLETELY new and different recipe. How can you comment negatively when you've not followed the directions? You've got to compare apples to apples! It doesn't seem fair to the people in the test kitchen at Gourmet who test these recipes using exacting standards. I personally would not make this recipe, but I sure as heck wouldn't say it was a bad recipe when I used it to inspire me to create a completely different one that turned out badly!

Amazingly simple (and basic) that allows the cook to focus on preparing stunning accompaniments. We peeled the garlic and placed in pan before adding beef and tomatoes.

What you see is what you get. What would you expect this beef to taste like after being cooked? Like tomatoes and garlic, right? In other words, this is a very basic braised beef recipe that is fine for just getting the beef cooked but begs for the addition of flavor that most of us enjoy and crave. There are many wonderful beef recipes on this site. My mouth is watering now just thinking of them.

First of all, the biggest chuck roast at the grocery was 2.2 lbs, so I took it! (But all those reviewers who thought the sauce was the best would agree). I also peeled the garlic (I too don't understand why not?). Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I cooked it at 300 for 4 hours, and could barely wait to taste it, the house smelled so good. It lived up to the smell. The entire family liked it, and we will repeat this one. How can you go wrong, with such an easy prep? I might add onions and carrots sometime, but that would defeat the ease of preparation, wouldn't it. In today's hectic world, it's great to be able to put together slow cooked good food without having many extra hours.

Browned the meat, peeled and doubled the garlic, used a cast iron dutch oven, made it a day ahead so I could easily get rid of the excess fat and served it with orzo and fresh green beans. It was good but as several other reviewers suggest it still lacks pizzazz. For the second meal I added some red pepper flakes before reheating and it helped. Next time I'll try the red wine and a bit of worchestershire. It is similar to another meat dish I make with cumin, fresh cilantro and onions and shred after the long slow cook for a great mexican meal.

Have been making this recipe for years, only we add diced carrots and onions to the pot. Sometimes we add mushrooms, celery, and even eggplant if we have some, and always a splash of worcestershire sauce and red wine. It's a great Sunday evening dish, and you just can't go wrong.

I served with new potatoes, peas, and a great crusty sourdough bread. This was SO EASY with great results. It may become a regular winter weekend dish.

Excellent recipe. I made this in my mother-in-laws cast iron dutch oven, seasoned from years of use. Still the best non-stick I know of if prepared properly. I added a few fresh basil leaves but left the rest of the recipe as is. The meat was succulent and tender with a sweet garlic overtone. One of the best pot roasts I've had. Orzo was a good side dish with fresh green peas and a good cabernet/shiraz. YUM!!!! There is enough left over sauce for a pasta dinner, can't wait!

Prepared this last night. Although I would have probably given this a 2 my husband Loved it! Why is the garlic unpeeled? I peeled some and left some unpeeled. The peeled melted into the tomatoes beautifully.

This was delicious. I made it in a crock-pot (slow cooker) and also added an extra head of garlic. I served it with oven fries, so we just used a bit of the sauce on the meat. The beef was incredibly tender and I froze the leftover sauce to use in the future with pasta or as a sauce on meatloaf or veal patties. An excellent dish.

The flavor was great and really appreciated the simplicity of it, but I do not whether it was the meat I used or what but it was just so incredibly fatty that the sauce was just about inedible. Made the kitchen smell great for hours

This was so easy and we loved it. Used leftover sauce in a baked potatoe with cheddar cheese for lunch. will make again and again.

This is the best pot-roast recipe I have ever tried. My family just loves it. It is also the easiest dish to make -- put it in the oven and forget about it!! I added an extra whole clove of garlic, yummy!!

This was great, we're already looking forward to leftover pasta sauce! In the magazine it says to cook at 300F (the web recipe left out the temp). I tried to cut it but it's so tender and tasty it doesn't matter if you cut it or chunk it! Have plenty of good sourdough bread on hand to spread the garlic with butter on! YUM!

This is a great and easy dinner. The garlic was to die for. I will make this again and again.

What temperature should the oven be heated to? I'd really like to make this, but I'm not going to risk over-cooking or under-cooking my meat!
