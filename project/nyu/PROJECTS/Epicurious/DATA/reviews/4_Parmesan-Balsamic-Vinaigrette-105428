I had a mountain of beautiful end-of-summer basil and REAL tomatoes - as in those grown in REAL dirt - that I used to make a caprese salad. I used this recipe for the dressing along with a really high quality balsamic vinegar. I didn't use the p-cheese as I thought with the mozzarella that was in the wrong direction I wanted to go. I doubled it and made it in a blender. WOW! It's now my house dressing when I have basil. I'll bet a nice peppery arugula would go well as the herb, too, if I don't have nice basil available.

This recipe is ok, not great. The ingredients didn't come together as well as other balsamic vinaigrette recipes I've tried. Also, I would add more balsamic vinegar and less olive oil.

Served this with the couscous vegetable salad last night. What a wonderful summer salad. I couldnt get enough. Yum. I promise you wont be disappointed. (I did add a bit more basil,and garlic)

The original recipe was too olive oily for my liking. I increased the vinegar to 3 tablespoons, decreased the fresh minced basil to 1 tablespoon, decreased the olive oil to 1/4 cup, added 2 tablespoons of water and added 1/2 teaspoon of honey. Excellent!!

I want to love this as much as everyone else seems to, but alas, it's lost on me. OK but not great in my book.

Great, simple recipe. My husband even liked it and he can be picky! Next time I might try it without the parmesan and add after the fact on the salad.

Made this recipe and tossed with roasted yukon gold potatoes, and served at room temperature...awesome combinations, and a great way to dress up plain, old potatoes!

I just made this recipe and it was delicious. But instead of serving it with a salad I made crostini's with baguettes toasted with olive oil, then layered with sliced fire roasted red peppers, fresh mozzeralla (sliced), and sliced tomatoes (seeds removed) then spooned some of this dressing over the top of each one. It was incredibly delicious. I will make this everytime I have a gathering from now on.

I've made, eaten, and served many recipes similar to this one, but I have to admit that I was quite impressed by the different ingredients. No Dijon mustard? No problem. It was also nice to see one that added something a little different (basil) that didn't ruin it with weirdness. This will be the only one I make and serve from now on.

I've been making this dressing for several years now, and just love it. I find it essential to use freshest of everything - cheese, lemon juice, etc. I like to serve this over mixed greens and grape tomatoes as a nice salad for my afternoon tea parties. This recipe makes plenty, so I just store the rest in the fridge. It makes it turn sort of solid, though, but just bring it to room temp a bit before dinnertime, and its no problem. --Janene from theweedpatch.typepad.com

Absolutely loved this vinaigrette. I substituted 1 tablespoon high quality white wine vinegar for the 1 teaspoon lemon juice (personal preference) and served it over a fresh tomato, mozzarella and basil salad. Exceptional!

Very simple to make and adds depth to any salad. I make a full recipe and then use small amounts at a time. I have been known to add sun dried tomatoes and it's fabulous.

Rating: 4
This is really good -- nice depth of flavor. I made it exactly as written and the only thing I will do differently next time is reduce the amount of oil to 1/4 or 1/3 of a cup. I like a less oily dressing in general but that's just my preference!

Simple recipe. Good taste. Made with Sausage, Cheese, and Basil Lasanga so I had fresh basil on hand. Will make again.

Forgot to add garlic and found this recipe to be very sweet. Terrific with a simple bed of greens. Basil adds a very nice twist to the usual vinaigrette.

This dressing is wonderful! I never knew such delicious dressing was so EASY to make. The mashed garlic paste really adds a lot of flavor, the parmesan gives it fantastic body, and the citrus juice (I only had a lime and it was fine) really adds a fresh zing. I also used some water to thin it, less olive oil (even less than 1/3 cup), honey to add another dimension to it and cut the tartness, and the lime zest like the others recommended. I also used 1 tbsp regular balsamic and 1 tbsp white balsamic. it turned out really well, and we served it over baby spinach with the orange, spiced walnut and cranberry salad also listed on this site. Will definitely make again!

I have made this twice, once with the basil and once without. I liked it much better without the basil. I also reverse the proportions of vinegar and oil -- I like a lot of vinegar. I mix it in the blender. I really like the texture and the flavor of the cheese.

This is a delicious versatile vinaigrette to have on hand. I prefer to add a full tablespoon of meyer lemon juice (our tree is full right now) and garlic olive oil to make prep even faster. I agree with a previous reviewer that a bit of grated lemon zest is wonderful as well. Great on mixed greens as well as steamed green beans and asparagus.

Rating: 4
I used 1/2 the amount of basil, because my basil plant seems to have a particularly strong flavor this year. I put all the ingredients in to a 1 cup glass measuring cup and used an immersion blender to "whisk" it. I truly enjoyed this dressing and will definitely make it again. I do think I will add a dash of sugar or a drop of honey next time, though. That is just a personal preference decision.

We put this over chilled green beans and avocados and were quite pleased. I like a previous reviewer's idea of 1/2 tsp lemon zest in the dressing.

This is a very well balanced vinaigrette. When I first saw the recipe, I thought it would need more balsamic vinegar. I was pleasantly surprised, it didn't. I've made this several times now. It is wonderful exactly as printed. Even better with 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest.

Delicious even without basil! Dressed a simple salad of field greens, grape tomatoes, avocado and currants, and it turned out just perfect.

Fanstastic, you can't go wrong! You can also replace a third of the oil with water and its still scrumptious.

A chef-to-be, I have made this dressing over and over. I love it. You can just taste the freshness. My boyfriend loves it too -- he asked for the leftover dressing!

Excellent vinaigrette. Easy preparation and company quality. I used 1/3 cup olive oil.

I whipped up this recipe with some sub-par ingredients that I had on had (rice vinegar, cheap olive oil, bottled lemon juice) and it was still tasty. *Very* potent though--not one to make for a romantic dinner! I like it "chunky"--torn basil and shaved parmesan. Would also recommend *small* garlic clove and only 1/3 cup oil. Tastes even better the next day!

Pretty good vinaigrette. I like that it has a kick and a nice strong flavor. It is a bit oily for me, so I think I would use less oil, more lemon juice, more vinegar, and a little water (?)next time.

Delicious. I've been looking for a good balsamic vinaigrette and I've found it! I used less basil (1 ts) because I didn't have fresh. I also used less oil (1/3 c). Great with your standard spinach salad with roquefort, walnuts, bacon, etc...

Made this for the first time tonight to serve over a simple salad of fresh spinach, red onion, chopped tomatoes, and shredded carrot. Used 1/2 of the amount of salt called for, 1/3 the amount of basil (as I used dried), and increased the pepper slightly. Also replaced 1/3 of the oil with water to cut down on the calories. It was EXCELLENT!!! I only have one question for all of you out there: 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese weighs 1 ounce on my scale, so does the recipe mean 1/2 ounce (as stated) which is 1/8 cup, or the 1/4 cup, which weighs one ounce??? I made the recipe with the lesser amount of cheese, but wonder if I should have used the larger amount... Thank you.

This is a crowd pleaser--I can't imagine anyone not liking this vinaigrette. You can use your inexpensive balsamic for it, too--with all that cheese, you don't need to use the good stuff.

This vinaigrette is fantastic, but beware: the only reason that I gave it a "3" instead of a "4," it's because of the garlic odor that stays in your mouth (i.e., breath) for hours after you have eaten your salad! A little too much for me.

I really enjoy this website and am thankful to epicurious for offering this great source of information to us - I particularly appreciate the comments and critiques of these recipes from the many viewers and great cooks out there. I, however, don't quite understand how one can comment on a recipe without having even made it and savoured it. The cook Judy from Ohio and others who have NEVER attempted these recipes, shouldn't even take up space with a comment - YOU haven't made the dish. Go ahead and try it....if you like it or don't, then say something.

The second time we made this dressing, we tore the basil into shreds and added it at the last moment. The flavor seemed was brighter that way. This is an assertive dressing that works well with with chicken on a salad, too.

Love this vinaigrette! The fresh basil in my store looked awful, so subbed a tablespoon of dried instead. I was doubting the recipe just before the olive oil was added...it was a very dry sludge. But have faith! It's a fairly aggressive dressing, I wouldn't use it on butter lettuce. Gonna try it tonight over green beans!

Wow. This was scrumptious. I had no fresh basil so added a generous pinch of dried.
