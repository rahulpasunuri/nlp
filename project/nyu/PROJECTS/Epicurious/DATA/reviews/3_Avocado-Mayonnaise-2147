I don't understand why I'd want to add mayonnaise to this, so I didn't. It was ok.

When I first tried it, I thought that it was only ok. The more I ate it, however, I really started to like it and put it on everything the next few days. I increased the hot sauce.

This is easy and delicious. I made it with the Swordfish Verde and it was wonderful. This mayonnaise is also great on turkey sandwiches! Yummy!!!
