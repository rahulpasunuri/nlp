I doubled the lemon juice and the result was a very refreshing and vibrant salad. Even beet haters should try it.

Great, simple, delicate dish that feels and looks special. You definitely need a food processor though-helps speed up the time and make the beets just the right size. If you forget the cheese-no worries. It's not necessary at all. Second time I made it, I purposefully did it without the cheese and still tasty.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I thought that this was terrible. The beets were bland and were therefore overwhelmed by the parsley, and you couldn't taste the dressing at all. Considering how time-consuming this was to make, it's rather disappointing. At least it looks pretty.

This was so simple, delicious, and beautiful on the plate; a great way to use beets. I used the shredder blade on my food processor instead of hand slicing...a little less perfect, but the colors of the beets make up for it. One caveat: If you're using beets from your garden, made sure they're young and tender. Older ones can taste too earthy. I could see shredding some carrots into this, too.
