This recipe is a little bland the way it is written, but I added some curry paste for a little more kick and went to town with the cumin, garlic and red pepper. Salt was also needed. It tastes better than it did at first. I also put the tomatoes in the oven on a low heat for 30 minutes. The sweetness brought out by slow roasting the tomatoes rounds out the flavors overall. I also added snow peas and red bell pepper, per other people's suggestions. The recipe is a good start, but, needed a little help. Thank goodness my roommate is a chef!

Why make this lovely, fragrant green rice, then go and pour a ho-hum curry sauce all over it? This may not be the recipe's fault, but I was bored to tears watching the completely untreated, un-marinated tofu cook. I made two batches, experimented with oil and temperatures for each, and each took about 20 mintues to brown all six sides to a nice soft crunch. (I dusted with cornstarch first, thanks other reviewers!) Is this normal? I cross referenced the cook time with other tofu recipes and 6-8 minutes seems to be the norm. My stovetop cooks with the fire of 1000 suns when set to 3, so I don't know what I should have done but didnt. Anyway, rice yes, tofu curry, no. All I could think during dinner last night was how the cool limey-cilantro rice would be awesome as a side dish to grilled jerk chicken.

I gave this 2 forks because while it was good, I found the directions frustrating to follow (when ingredients are divided in the recipe steps, I also want them to be divided in the list so I know how to lay them out) and there was a LOT of chopping/dicing/peeling/washing involved. I think the recipe would be better with shrimp or with smoked or marinated tofu. It's a pretty healthy recipe and we gobbled it up while watching Thursday night football. We'll probably make it for vegetarian friends at some point (this was the practice run) but we'll add veggies and double up on some stuff, like the lime juice. Anyone have a preference as to salted or unsalted peanuts? We didn't have any peanuts at home (5 kinds of nuts, but no peanuts) so they were sadly left out.

I really liked this recipe and so did my boyfriend who is not a fan of tofu. My main comment is to take note that you only use part of the coconut milk, ginger, and garlic in the blender. You use the balance of the ingredients when you stir-fry. Don't do what I did and carelessly blaze throught the recipe put everything in the blender!

I don't have an interest in cooking tofu, but thanks to another review decided to try this with shrimp. It was easy, quick and good. It's definitely going in my weeknight dinner roster. I would give it 2.5 if I could - nothing too special about it, but the shrimp was great with the green rice. I increased the red pepper and added a ton of veggies - peppers, onions, and carrots.

Rating: 3
This recipe was excellent when I cooked it the first time with shrimp. I cooked it again with the tofu, and it was not the same. Not enough flavor or spice. I poured more coconut milk on it to see if it would help, but it did not. I will make this again, but probably not with tofu.

I love this recipe I have made it twice now and it was really easy. Great for a week night dinner. My husband was unsure at first about tofu but after this dish he loves it. I also added extra vegetables right before you add the tomatoes. The vegetables I have used were mushrooms, snow peas and a red or orange pepper. It helps to make this dish a complete meal.

Good recipe - just not good enough. It's a good place for an imaginative cook to start, and i used it as a base and turned it into a green curry by adding another bunch of cilantro, more coconut milk, and of course, more garlic. The tofu portion also needs more veggies, like squash, pea pods etc. The one thing i have not tried, but feel is really needed here is a chutney. There is a sweetness lacking in this recipe that puzzles me and i think a chutney will do the trick.

I just add the coconut milk and lime juice to the tofu after the spices and then serve with plain rice. For the coconut milk, I use some to make 2 pina coladas and use whatever is left for the sauce. The hard part is not getting that stupid song stuck in your head... Thanks to the reviewer with the tip about the cornstarch I liked it.

This is so good, it should be a sin. I used all the coconut milk as per others' advice. I also made it with chicken since a guest was not fond of tofu, and I used 1.5tsp of red pepper flakes because I wanted it hotter. I plan to make it again in a few days with the tofu. It's really an incredible recipe. The rice is just to die for.Rave reviews all around.

Wow! This was really good! I made it for a "dinner/movie date" for a friend of mine and he loved it! I did as other reviews suggested and added more coconut milk...I ended up using the whole can, with most of it going into the rice. The lime really gives it a nice punch of flavor. For the tofu it's crucial to toss with some flour and the spices, it gives it a nice crust on the outside...oh and make sure to "press" the tofu as well! I also made the "Country Tomato Broth" from this site and my friend accidentally put it on top of his rice and tofu...and it turned out to be really delicious that way too! Enjoy!!

I thought this was the best vegetarian tofu recipe I've tried. I followed the recipe except I used regular coconut milk instead of lite and medium firm tofu instead of extra firm because that is what I had on hand. It does take awhile to brown the tofu even on high, so you have to be patient. I will definitely make this again.

As someone who likes tofu on occaision but loves meat, I found the texture a little wanting. I ended up adding some water chestnuts, mushrooms, onions, and baby corn to give it a bit more umph. The rice was good, but I followed the directions and ended up wiht something a little drier than I would like. I think a little more coconut milk in the rice would be good. I thought the curry was ok. Overall, I liked it but didn't love it and will probably not make the dish (except for the rice) again.

Rating: 4
I've been making this dish for at least a year and we LOVE it! I do use the whole can of coconut milk which makes is very saucy and moist (and besides, what do you do with half a can of left over coconut milk?). I also use Garam Masala instead of the curry. I find that adds a lot of umph and probably the salt that others say it needs. The other key thing is to press the tofu between a towel for a few minutes. This pulls out the extra moisture and allows you to really get a golden crispy brown crust (it takes a little longer than you want to totally brown the tofu - be patient). YUM!

Rating: 3
Lovely. I made this with a fresh coconut, which I cut into ribbons with a carrot peeler instead shredding. I used slightly less cilantro (I ran out) with no problem. I also added sliced red bell pepper. Next time I will add more green stuff - maybe extra green onion or some wilted greens?

The tofu dish and rice dish do not go well together in my opinion. The intense flavors of each dish fight each other. For the rice dish, I would not use raw garlic and ginger in the cilantro puree again - too harsh. For the tofu dish, it seems Thai inspired but the spices are not authentic. The result is not worth the effort.

This is a delicious dish. (The raw garlic in the rice sauce probably contributes to that.) If you like anything with coconut, this is a dish for you! I coated the tofu in seasoned Wondra flour before sauteing because I found it difficult in the past to get a good sear on tofu with all it's inner moisture. I found the way the recipe was written very frustrating... kind of out of order, I had to break down where the ingredients that get divided go. It should have been written: Rice/sauce separately and tofu curry separately. We know they go together.

Rating: 2
The tofu was definitely bland and I had even spiced it up/marinated it after reading the other reviews. I think it could use, at minimum, extra salt, chili paste (maybe sriracha?), and garlic. The rice definitely needs a pinch of salt as well. I liked the flavors of the cilantro/coconut in the rice and will try to improve upon both the next time around -- definitely has potential

Rating: 4
Unbelievable! An absolute MUST MAKE! Even better the next day as the flavors continue to blend. BUT ... try serving it cold on a bed of leaf lettuce as a summer luncheon salad with a basket of crusty bread and individual crocks of herbed butter. Pair with a dry Reisling or a Chardonnay. OR for a dinner side-dish serve this with Grilled Lemon Chicken with (or without) Satay Dip - Ina Garten Barefoot Contessa Cookbook p. 48. (forget the wooden skewers in this case) or grilled swordfish. Use medium firm tofu. Halve tomatoes (drain on paper towels) and remember there are many curry blends - just use your favorite.

This is a great use of tofu! Absolutely delicious. I will definitely add this to my repertoire of repeat-dishes.

I agree that the dish it a bit too dry the way it is shown. I would use the whole can of coconut milk (14 oz)in the sauce. I also added mushrooms. I thought it was better the next day (when I added more milk to it when I heated it up). By then I was loving it so much I was daydreaming about when I'd have it again. (oh and I forgot the cumin and the peanuts--didn't need them, I guess)

The best part of this recipe is the green rice. On it's own, I'd probably give the rice 4 forks. I wasn't super thrilled with the tofu at first, as I tend to prefer saucier tofu dishes. The seasoning in this recipe is too dry, and also relatively heavy handed. But it's growing on me after 3 dinners. Maybe by the time I finish the leftovers in another 2 nights I'll be completely in love with it.

I have never liked curry powder so used some leftover homemade Thai yellow curry paste instead of the spices suggested, added some red pepper and mushrooms and the result was delicious. The rice is really tasty too. Tofu is boring unless marinated - a good, quick, all round marinade is dried onion and garlic granules in hot veg stock (from cubes or powder), with tamari, a bit of yeast extract, hot sauce and thyme. Marinade for a few hours if poss. It's great as is just sauteed till browned.

This was delicious! I haven't cooked much with tofu, save for throwing some in wraps or pastas, so I was skeptical as to how it would turn out, but it was surprisingly really, really good!

The rice was delicious - we'd make it again. The tofu, despite the great ingredients, was bland bland bland.

Very good. I added extra coconut, ginger, garlic, and lime, went half and half on parsley and cilantro. It was funny because the first bite I took made me think it would be too spicy to eat, but giving it a couple of minutes to sit made it just perfect.

We substituted parsley for the cilantro because one of us thinks it tastes like soap. He's a little funny that way. We also know someone who thinks gorgonzola tastes like feet, but we digress. Anyhow, the parsley mixture was good enough to drink and the entire recipe was fantastic. Be sure to fully brown the tofu. You really need to make this.

The 3 forks are for the rice - my favorite part of this dish. I cut way back on the cilantro (personal preference), but all the flavors in the rice married quite well. I would eat it alone again and again!! The tofu part was okay - I can't think of a way I would like to change it, so I just enjoyed the rice and didn't concentrate on the blandness of the tofu.

This is a good way to jazz up tofu. I made it last night and thought it was delicious! I steamed some yellow squash, carrots, broccoli and asparagus and layered them between the rice and the tofu. I omitted the tomatoes and the peanuts because I didn't have them. A colorful, tasty dish.

I'd have to agree with Louise from Philadephia. Lovely presentation and the ingredients all make it sound wonderful but when all is said and done, it just doesn't taste like much. I'm sure this is a recipe that can be worked with if one has the inclination.

Because so many cooks called this dish bland, I substituted hot green (Thai) curry for the yellow curry, and put in more of the curry than the recipe called for (also splashed in some yellow curry for fun). The result: A delicious dish, albeit an extremely hot one. I also substituted chicken for the tofu, used 1/4 cup oil, and stir-fried the chicken/onions/etc. mix for a few minutes, not just one, which let the flavors seep through.

Found both components dry, so emptied the rest of the coconut milk(regular fat) into the tofu, which improved it. Made the mistake of using garlic-dill tofu instead of plain. Would also go with firm or medium tofu next time, not extra-firm. To my surprise, loved the tomatoes, and would increase them. Needed a lot of salt, but once salted, enjoyed this and would make it again.

I was surpised, but I didn't really like this that much. It seemed like there are lots of great ingredients, but I just didn't love the end result--it was somehow not as flavorfull as expected. I used red curry paste (and too much of it), so it was also too hot. The rice was good, but it's a good idea to wait on pouring the green sauce over it until when you're almost ready to serve (stays moister that way). Also, make sure to have a non-stick pan--I didn't, and I had to put the tofu under the broiler to crisp/brown it b/c it was just sticking to my pan. Not a bad recipe, but I'm thinking there must be better?

MM MM MM! I followed the recipe except that I used a little more than a tsp. of store-bought red curry paste (Thai Kitchen) instead of the curry powder, because I wanted to ensure it had enough gumption. It did. The tofu fried up nicely with a slightly crispy outside, and the cherry tomatoes were great bursts of flavor. Next time, I will ditch the crushed red pepper, but will gladly eat this one again.

Taking the advice of other reviewers, I increased the amounts of garlic, ginger, and coconut milk. I felt this to be one of the best tofu dishes I have ever tasted. I encourage those who thought this to be bland to try again, and increase the red pepper, or add more curry. This is a great dinner party main course for vegetarian friends.

It's interesting to read the wide variety of opinions here! I'm eating this one as I type and find the rice to be absolutely delicious, but to me the tofu is incredibly bland. Oddly enough, it was the rice I messed up on. (I, er, used 1/2c coconut *juice* instead of coconut milk. Not until I opened my can of coconut milk for the tofu did I realize that the two are different. Insert embarrassed look of an inexperienced coconut-cook here.) I love cilantro, and I wonder if people who can't really smell cilantro (it's one of those genetic things, apparently) would get as much out of a recipe like this. Next time I will double the tofu seasonings since right now I'm tasting zilch curry or cumin. I'm hoping that the leftover tofu will perhaps absorb more flavour as time passes. I will also skip the little tomatoes unless I have company since for me the only thing they add to is the presentation. (Reminding me of a hundred in-flight meals...) But the rice? It's a new favourite!

We were underwhelmed by this great-sounding but mediocre-tasting recipe, which was, admittedly, a lot of fun to make. I enjoyed using the technique of mixing a pureed liquid into rice to totally transform its color. Still, this was a lot of work for very little reward. I have to admit I changed the recipe a bit. I erred and put all the garlic into the rice when the recipe states you should only put half. Also, the only shredded coconut I could find at the store was sweetened, so I used that. The bottom line on this recipe is that it sounded like it would taste much better than it turned out....and, Please pass the salt!!

I had a vegetarian over, and a friend who won't touch tofu unless he's throwing it out. So I did one pan with chicken and one with tofu. Turns out the chicken was a giant hit, the tofu, not as much. Seems that the tofu absorbs the sauce more than the chicken, leaving it drier, and, well, more tofu like. However, the green rice was a hit, and the sauce on the chicken was terrific. I'm making it again tonight!

There are very few dishes I make repeatedly (just too many new ones out there) but this is definately one of them! The entire family LOVED this, even the 2 year old. I did use chicken though as the 9 year old will make herself gag if I make anything with tofu :o) I messed up, but I don't think it made any difference. I put all the garlic and ginger in the processor with the coconut milk and cilantro and made a "pesto" like sauce. I then added just a bit more garlic to the chicken. The family fought over the leftovers.

I followed the rice recipe, making one change. I did not add garlic to the blended mix of cilantro, lime and ginger. For the main dish, I pressed the tofu earlier in the day to reduce the water content. I added two minced carrots, and one cup tiny organic French green beans to the scallion/tomato vegetable mixture. I also added about one-half cup of Korma curry sauce to the coconut milk/spice mixture to beef up the flavor. The tofu portion of the dish is similar to many things I have cooked before. I would definitely consider creating the rice again, as it has a unique flavor that could be used in the cooking of many cultures: Latin, Asian, Indian, African, etc.

I am a huge tofu fan and love both Thai and Indian spices a lot. However, I found this recipie convoluted. For one, the rice was too tart and not the right match for the tofu dish. In hindsight regular white jasmine rice would have been far better. As for the tofu dish itself, I recommend less curry, halving the cherry tomatoes so that the robust tomato flavor mix with sauce during the cooking process, and lastly, maybe a teaspoon of brown sugar stirred into the sauce right at the end to allow a more refined complimentary to the spicy nature of the dish.

This recipe definitely would have been excellent had I found coconut milk. But alas, I was in a hurry, so I used the evaporated skim milk in my cupboard. Also used a fresh jalapeno instead of red pepper flakes and some chopped almonds instead of peanuts. Because I knew I wouldn't have the flavor of the coconut milk, I played w/ the recipe and added some turmeric and used more flavorful sesame oil than plain ol' vegetable oil. Oh, and yellow bell pepper and carrot instead of tomatoes (hubby's not a huge fan of the tomatoes). So I changed the recipe - we're allowed to do that! I enjoyed it, and when I'm not in a hurry, I'll use the coconut milk and see if that really puts the meal over the top. In the meantime, a fun way to get healthy stuff on the table that's much more satisfying than salad!

To cook A Cook from Alaska on 02/10/03. You, of course, are correct that ginger is a digestive, and can aid in aleviating the uncomfortable feeling one sometimes gets when eating a fat-saturated meal (not that this dish qualifies). What I objected to re Boston's comment (i.e. that ginger "helps your body "deal" with fat in your food") is the implication that ginger might somehow help in weight loss ("dealing" with fat). It doesn't.

Sorry everyone, I'm not reviewing this recipe, I just saw the questions about fat and wanted to give a suggestion. A veggie friend of mine uses non-fat evaporated milk and adds a splash of coconut extract to give the flavour without the fat. You can then adjust the intensity of the "coconutiness" to your personal taste. Hope that helps.

Hey Square State, it was probably nothing special to you because you're one of those who made it with evaporated milk... And cook on 2/11, I made it as written - not "totally revamping" the recipe.

Yummy!!!!! Made for family and friends--everyone loved. The rice is delicious on its own, and the tofu is balanced well with grape tomatoes and the spices. One friend mentioned could be spicier, but if you like it spicey-just add chiles or more red pepper. Will make again and again.

I love RThai cuisine and found this to be one of the best Thai curries I have ever eaten anywhere. When I prepare it again I will use chicken,as I found the tofu stuck to the pan and didn't saute well. I served it with Thai peppers sliced and served in fish sauce as a condiment, which complemented the dish very well, if you like spicy Thai. Excellent dish!

I made a half-recipe last night, thinking I could have leftovers today, but YUM! It was so delicious I ate the whole thing! I used peanut oil to saute the tofu but otherwise made it as written and thought it was amazingly flavorful. I don't understand why everyone is fussing so much about the coconut milk--the recipe calls for LIGHT and there really isn't all that much per serving (unless you eat two servings!). So relax and enjoy, it won't kill you!

This dish is very appealing visually. It also has alot of flavor and an exotic appeal when you want something different. I would definately make it again, but maybe try chicken and substitute the tomatoes with red and yellow bell peppers as some others have suggested. Don't expect a light dish because it's meat-free; the coconut milk makes it very rich.

OK people, get off the "fat" thing. Coconut is a natural food that has probably been here since any tropical place existed on this earth. Saturated fat is part of a normal diet, you just have to balance it. If you generally eat a healthy diet full of fruits and veggies, eating a dish with some coconut milk will not cause a cardiac episode. Check your labels on your foods at home-you should be worried about all the hydrogenated oils you consume--thats where the problem is. Eat you your ethnic-inspired recipes and ENJOY!!!!!

A cook from Boston commented on the high fat and saturated fat in coconut milk. I agree it is too high. Even the low fat coconut milk is high so I have started using nonfat evaporated milk when I make Thai green curry and we love it. I like it better than when I did try it with coconut milk.

This is a great vegetarian dish, which is also good made with chicken. It is nice to make a little extra sauce, although the rice tastes great on its own.

(I cooked the tofu first as directed, took it out of the pan, stir-fried the red pepper, then added the tofu back to the pan and proceeded as directed.) Next time, I would consider adding more vegetables (zucchini, yellow bell peppers, and peas come to mind) and increasing the amount of sauce. I would also consider eliminating the tomatoes, which I didn't especially care for. The nice red color can be added with the red bell pepper. The dish also really did need salt.

I made this dish for my husband, who is not a real tofu lover, and I think it is fair to say he is one now. The only thing I changed with this recipe was adding a little salt to taste at the end, and it made such a huge difference in intensifying all the flavors. Will definitely make again!!

I agree with Hudson, NY that there is not much sauce to this dish. Because of that I will either cut back a little on the curry or add some broth at the end maybe. Overall it's a great dish and the rice really is fabulous I would definitely make that on it's own.

I'm a bit confused how a dish with 20 grams of fat per serving - and 5 of saturated fat- could be included in "Cooking for Health" - even if there is no meat. I'm a vegetarian and tofu curries are wonderful; however, I hardly ever eat them because they're not very healthy with the coconut milk. Perhaps substituting a low-fat coconut milk and some broth? Any suggestions from readers?

I have officially reached hero status with my husband! We LOVED this dish! I read the review from Menasha, WI commenting on how the tofu was a little "flat" tasting. I use tofu all the time and I like it but that comment inspired me to use 1/2 chicken and 1/2 tofu. I cut the chicken into 1/2 inch cubes like the tofu. I cooked the chicken at the same time as the tofu and it was cooked through after the recommended 6 mins. The chicken pieces did "carry" the flavor a bit better than the tofu pieces did. This dish doesn't have a lot of sauce, but because the rice is so fabulous on its own, it doesn't need it. But, if you want more sauce (and can afford the calories and fat) use more coconut milk at the end. For dessert I made the "Coconut Lime Rice Pudding" (Gourmet January 1999). What a delicious way to end a great meal!

Visually this dish looked great. I however have not had much experience with cooking tofu and found the taste a little flat and don't know if it was just the dish or if this is going to be a trend in low fat cooking.
