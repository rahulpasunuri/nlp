We just got back from Greece. Santorini specializes in fava and I was very pleased to see your recipe. It was just like the delicious fava we had there. EXCEPT: In Greece we never saw it served with capers or arugula. Instead it was drizzled with olive oil. Once it was served with a side of olive tapenade. Thanks.

I've had fava dip in my favorite greek restraunt and it tasted nothing like this. I would appreciate any tips on how to make a great fava dip. This recipe isn't it.
