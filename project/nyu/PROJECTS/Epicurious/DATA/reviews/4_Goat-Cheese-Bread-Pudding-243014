This was delicious and easy to make. I had a Panera baguette to use and went searching for a savory bread pudding. My husband doesn't like bread pudding as dessert, but loved this! The most time consuming aspect is chopping the rosemary (which adds great flavor) and chopping the bread. Stir the bread while it's sitting in liquid so it gets absorbed.

Added dried, chopped figs before baking and served with grilled lamb chops. Outstanding.

The recipe looked great, but I think it should have a more clear description of what a loaf of ciabatta is. Mine was 18 oz and I think that was too much for the recipe. The flavor was good, but the ratio of bread to cheese and custard was too much. I am looking forward to trying it again and adjusting the amounts - it'll be a four forker for sure!

I took advice from another reviewer and decided to add some carmelized onions to the top. I carmelized 2 sweet onions and added the rosemary to them instead of the milk. Then I put the onions on top of the bread under the cheese. My husband loved it.

I am fortunate enough to own a copy of Dishing Up Vermont. My family loves the Goat Cheese Bread Pudding. We followed the contributor's suggestion and paired it with Rosemary-seared Lamb Loin and Blueberry Mint Relish (both recipes can be found in the book). This made for a delicious added touch.

This is a wonderful pudding. It is a great accompaniment to savory dishes. I served it with grilled lamb chops and a spoonful of cranberry chutney.

While this was kind of bland I think a lot could be done to "doctor" it up to make it more flavorful: add other herbs or spices such as thyme and garlic or maybe give it some texture and heat with some roasted red peppers and dried pepper flakes. I will try some combinations, using this as a base. By itself it is nothing spectacular.
