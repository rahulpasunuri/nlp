Combined this with another recipe on this site for spiced poached pears. They were just OK. Nice presentation, but not a strong spiced flavor. The lemon mousse was definitely the winner here.

My pears took FOREVER to soften. Flavor was ok, but the lemon mousse was the real hit.

Our friend made this for us for dessert. The pears had a great flavor. But, she didn't serve it with the mousse, just a scoop of vanilla ice cream - very good!
