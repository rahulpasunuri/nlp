Loved it - uped the olives to a healthy 1/8 cup and mixed them in instead of sprinkled on top of. Gone in a flash.

I am cracking up that someone thought this was a lot of work! Very quick, easy recipe. Nice taste. But agree that you need to eat it at one meal.

I made this for a tapas dinner and everyone loved it. I make it just as the recipe says and sometimes I don't even want to share.

I love this recipe. It's been a hit with pretty much everyone I've served it to, and I've served it to lots of people. (Naples is right, though - it's not as wonderful the next day.)

Have made this many times as a side dish for bbq and buffets. People like the multi-layers of flavor, and I thought that it was an easy, make-ahead. I will serve it with the grilled morrocan chicken and couscous salad for a dinner party.

I'm the cook from naples, below, and after putting the leftovers in the fridge and tasting them again, I would not make this again unless the occasion warranted all the prep work AND the whole thing would be eaten right away. It is not so special cold the next day, and I don't want to reheat because of the fresh scallions and cilantro.

I don't think that this was all that spectacular. I would make it again if I was making soemthing with similar flavors (middle eastern, perhaps) and needed a veggie side dish, otherwise it was unremarkable.

Exceptionally good. I used scallions because didn't have a purple onion. But beware, this recipe is A LOT of work.

This is a GREAT recipe. As I was making it I didn't think it would taste good - the carrots initially seemed to lose their sweetness in the boiling process. But the end result was a perfect melange of flavors - spice, sweetness, and lemony tang. A real winner, and I wouldn't change a thing.

WOW! I've never had carrots that tasted this good! I cut back on the lemon a bit, and skipped the olives (not a fan). Left the bowl on the counter and half of it was gone before we set the table!

This disappeared quickly! A really yummy way to eat vegetables (my anti-veg husband ate more than I did!).
