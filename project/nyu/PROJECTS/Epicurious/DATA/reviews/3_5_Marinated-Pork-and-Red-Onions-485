I used this simply as a marinade over pork loins tonight when I realized that my bottle of red wine was going to go if I didn't use it up! I broiled the loins and reduced the marinade and was very pleased! I would certainly use this one again!

We really liked this recipe. Sometimes it is nice not to have the meat the most flavourful. I just used pork tenderloins, and butterflied them. I only was able to marinate them for 3 hours, really want to see how they taste after marinating overnight. Served with carmalized red onions, spinach, and almonds, and then I did bacon, onion and cheese potatoes as well. I will serve this again because it is so versatile, lots of things can accompany the meat.

We really liked this recipe - it was delicious (but not an Oh Wow kind of delicious)and so easy to prepare. My only change - used half the amount of oil for the marinade. I did however marinate overnight and brought the marinade to a boil so that we could spoon some over the meat. I served it over Chinese fried rice - got a great recipe from a crazy little Chinese food website.

I used 2 and 1/2 pounds pork tenderloin for this recipe (increased marinade) and thought I would end up with way too much for four people. Wrong, every piece was devoured and they were looking for more. Served on a bed a fresh spinach with grilled tomatoes on the side. Excellent

This is an excellent recipe. I made these kebabs for a big barbeque party, and everyone raved about them. I will definitely make them again. I recommend marinating the meat at least 4 hours.

I made everything ahead of time for a camping trip so my pork marinated 24 hours before I grilled it. I prepared the recipe as directed and grilled over a charcoal fire. Just a little to bland for my taste, although my wife really enjoyed it. I guess I tend to like more of a Robust flavor in my meats, although it was very tender & juicy.

This was an easy recipe to prepare. I did steam the onions a bit to mellow their taste & make them easier to skewer. However, I will try it next time without doing that. I missed the real grilled onion taste. The ginger was strong at times so make sure you like it (maybe more garlic would of been good). I grilled everything skewered on the bbq (soak wooden skewers in water for at least an hour to prevent them from burning on the grill). I found the cooking time was longer than 12 minutes. I served it over rice and might add some other veggies next time.

Excellent! I followed the previous reviewers advice and grilled it in a basket. Wonderful! Good for company! double the garlic, tho

My family LOVES this recipe and I make it all the time. Even my fussy 9 year old loves it over rice. However, I cube the meat, marinate it and then put it in a a bar-b-que basket and toss it while it is cooking instead of making messy kabobs. I double the garlic and marinade - with the onions- all day...it is ready to go when I get home from work.

My fiancee and I have made this dish 2 or 3 times now, and we both like it a lot! We've made it both with the minimum marinade time, and with an entire day of marinade time. It is great either way. Instead of basting with the marinade, we microwave it and spoon some of it over the meal. The marinade is very tasty, and easy to make!
