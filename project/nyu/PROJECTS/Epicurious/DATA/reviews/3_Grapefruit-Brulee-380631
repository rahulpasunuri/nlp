Make sure to use raw sugar, regular granulated will seep right through, and not burn on the top. I used a creme brulee iron. I'm excited to try this again with the right kind of sugar.

it was tasty but I failed with the "brulee." I do not have a torch, so tried it in the broiler. For some reason, the sugar would not harden and if I left it under the broiler a little more, it would just melt completely off the top of the grapefruit. any advice?

Been doing this for a long time. You can make this really elegant by dousing with Chambord before adding sugar then topping with a real Marasca cherry or two. Look for Luxardo brand cherries and expect them to be pricy.
