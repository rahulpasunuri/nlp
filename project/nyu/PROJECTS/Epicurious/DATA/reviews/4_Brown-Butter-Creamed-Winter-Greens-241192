Made a smaller version for 2 people with only collards, didn't bother straining the bechemel, but picked out the bay leaf and peppercorns. Lively and tasty, with a little heat, a terrific way to make winter greens when you want something a little different and comforting.

I was a little hesitant on the bechamel because of the heavy calories so I cut the butter to half a stick and susbstituted the heavy cream for greek yogurt. The flavor in this dish is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I don't think I could labor to cook it more than once a month, but I wish I had it with every meal, so freakin' tasty!

I have permanently broken up with creamed spinach because of this recipe. After I discovered it I made it three times in a week. It's become a sick obsession. One of my faves ever from Epicurious and it's awesome just the way it is, though I feel compelled to point out that it becomes even more amazing if you use as many kinds of greens as possible. Also, it's totally possible to skip the bacon. The menu it's a part of is also great even if you don't celebrate Kwanzaa, incidentally.

I've made this twice now, and both times the dish was fabolous. Once as part of a southern themed dinner using collard greens and kale, and another time as part of a "caveman" themed dinner using dinosaur kale. SOOOO DELICIOUS!!! This takes a little time for a side dish but it's well worth the effort.

Excellent. A keeper. Elegant to serve to dinner quests. I agree with Miss Jenkins, the sauce can be used for other dishes. Thank you John T. Edge and Gourmet.

This recipe is AMAZING! It will definitely become a regular dish in my household. I'd like to find other ways to use the béchamel sauce too. It seems like it could be a tasty base for other dishes.

Seriously sinful veggie - loved it! Added the leftovers to a baked mac and cheese the next day - yum!

I don't know how anyone would dislike this recipe. Greens, cream, bacon, and crushed pepper...delicious.

i love greens any way you can make them, but this was amazing! they were spicier than i expected; however, that was a pleasant surprise. i only used collards from my garden and regular bacon since i had it on hand and it was delicious. i may make them vegetarian next time, will let you know if they are as good. highly recommended from a southern greens connoissuer.

We loved this. I used collard greens from the CSA. I did, however, cut the butter by 3 tbsp, and use a little bit of the rendered bacon fat with the butter. I made the bechamel sauce with skim milk and it was just fine. I added only a tbsp or two of the cream at the end.

we are part of a CSA and I'm always looking for new ways to cook all the winter greens which get, which are A LOT! this was a great take on the usual method of basically just boiling them in cider vinegar. my fiance and i agreed it was like a version of mac and cheese for your greens - creamy, comforting, winter food. and a great way to turn an otherwise healthy meal of greens into something totally opposite! p.s. i didn't have bacon, so i just ignored that part and it was still really good. i think that would be def. added more depth, but don't skip this recipe if you find yourself similarly bacon-less!

in the interest of calories and health used one cup of milk and one cup of broth from preblanching the greens. and i didn't add the heavy cream at the end. my boyfriend says " a little bit of good southern living in every bite." and this is his new favorite way to have his collard greens.

Absolutely delicious; will forever be added to the Thanksgiving cannon. The bitters (I used collard, mustard, turnip and kale) are the perfect antidote to sweet potatoes, cran sauce, etc. THAT SAID: I did not discard the center ribs from my greens -- you should keep them too if you like a touch of crunch. Same effect can be had by sauteeing the greens for maybe 7, instead of 10. mins, which I also did. My bechamel thickened too much so I added another 1/4 cup (2x!) of milk, and it was fantastic. My most favorite new recipe. Excellent!

Fantastic! I didn't have any pork or bacon, but it really didn't even need it (although I'm always a fan of bacon!). I also didn't have any heavy cream, so I just left it out and made more sauce. It was super rich and yum!

Wow! If you're looking to make some really unhealthy veggies, look no more. But seriously, this was exceptionally delicious and I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I'll try subbing low fat milk and using less butter. I think that the dish could stand to be a little less rich.

Made it with Kale; wife is vegetarian so no bacon, but I did add a splash of liquid smoke- divine.

Made this as a side-dish to an X-mas dinner. Used fresh kale and collard greens (spouse will not eat spinach), and thought recipe was pretty good, not spectacular. I wish the bacon had brought more to the dish, but it sort of got lost in all of the milk- and cream-flavor.
