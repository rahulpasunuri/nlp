I made this for my Other Half's birthday in 2007 and it was so good our American Bulldog savaged it, leaving a deep, tongue-formed groove along one side of the cake when a guest left the fridge door open. The Other Half is so into pumpkin anything that he ate the opposite side of the cake despite my protestations. If you know and love a fan of pumpkin, make this cake and be sure to keep it out of reach of any canine pumpkin fans who might be lurking about. It wasn't my favorite -- I love chocolate -- but any fan of pumpkin flavor will wet their pants over it.

When I read the ingredients, my mouth was watering and I was certain the combination would create a flavorful and spectacular ending for my dinner party. I like to bake and never have problems with cakes, but this one just didn't come together for me, on many, many levels. The cake was nothing special, despite all of the spices that had piqued my interest. For all the hassle of making the puree, the frosting was runny and not the pretty shade I had envisioned. My guests said it was good, but I had plenty left over the next day. And -- most telling of all -- my kids didn't eat it.I ended up tossing at least half of the cake. Next time I want that combination of flavors, I'll make my pumpkin roll, which never fails to please.

I had no trouble with the cake. The layers came out of the pan easily and it was light and very flavorful. The frosting, however, was a bit of a bummer. It was so soft, almost gooey. I made the dried apricot cut- outs and decided to pipe a border around the edge, but it wouldn't hold the shape. Did I beat the cream cheese too long? I don't know. Nonetheless, the cake did look beautiful, and my guests thought it tasted wonderful. I'm going to try it again, since it was such a nice combination of flavors, but I hope it works better.

I was so nervous about making this, as I am not much of a baker, and cakes are temperamental (and so is my oven). It was for my best friend's birthday party, too, so I wanted it to be perfect. I'm happy to report that it was a spectacular success! I don't like using canned pumpkin, and it wasn't pumpkin season, so I thought I'd use a butternut--but on shopping day there were no butternuts and I ended up using acorn squash. I'd love to try this with a really vibrant-tasting squash like Hubbard! The frosting is gorgeous, and I made apricot tulips with green icing stems. A huge success!

This was good but not outstanding...would be great for dessert at Thanksgiving dinner or a cool fall night.

Great cake - all the relatives raved about it. Lovely moist, light texture. Also appreciated that it wasn't too tricky to put together. Used parchment paper and had no problem with removing the cakes from the pans.

Loved this cake! I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit: light, moist, with wonderful apricot flavor. Do use parchment paper in the pans as the layers are very delicate. I got tons of compliments on the appearance as well - the frosting is a lovely color and decorating with cut-out apricot leaves turns it into real beauty. Can't wait for an occasion to make this again!

Blah! I was completely unimpressed, as was my boyfriend, and though my guests were polite about it, I got the feeling that none of them loved it either. I made the cake exactly as described, and in terms of texture, moistness, and appearance it was spot on, but the flavor was dull and unimpressive, also the frosting was too soft.

I made this cake with butternut squash puree rathen than pumpkin, golden unrefined sugar, and 1/4 cup of potato flour mixed with unrefined pastry flour, and it made the lightest, most tender cake I have ever tasted. Everyone who ate it raved about it and wants the recipe! All said it was the best cake they ever ate. I agree. Thisone is a sumptious cake, although fragile--must put parchment paper on bottom of pans, then butter it. After cake has baked, let rest in pans for five minutes, then turn out on rack to cool. When cool, place on plate,then peel off parchment. Fill,then place next layer on top, peel off parchment, etc. The cake is so delicate that it needs the parchment to hold it together until frosted. I covered the sides with toasted, chopped walnuts-GORGEOUS. I WILL ALWAYS SERVE THIS CAKE FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS! It looks spectacular, and tastes out of this world.

This recipe was a big success. Even the family members who didn't like pumpkin loved this cake. I used the dried apricots to make little pumpkins to decorate the cake. I carved faces into the apricots with an X-acto knife and they turned out great.

This cake was AWESOME. I bake cakes all the time and I have never received as many compliments as when I baked this for a potluck last week. Moist, delicious, fabulous!

Great - but I cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup, used all purpose flour and homemade apricot preserves, nonfat yogurt instead of buttermilk, baked it in a 8-1/2x11 inch baking pan and it turned out wonderfully!

Excellent! Everyone loved this cake, including one guest who doesn't like pumpkin.

Absolutely fabulous. It stole the show at Thanksgiving - beating out all other desserts on the table. Wonderful blend of flavors. And the leftover puree is excellent on pancakes!

Everybody loved it at my Halloween party and as leftovers the next day. I frosted the top in a chrysanthemum pattern and dusted it with cinnamon. My guess is that Texas used pureed fresh apricots, instead of following the link to the apricot puree recipe.

This is an incredibly beautiful, tasty, and original recipe. Served for my mom's late-October birthday party and it is definitely a "celebration cake". I can't imagine what Texas did to the frosting - it has apricots, nectar, and tons of sugar and nothing tart... maybe the cream cheese was spoiled? I made this a day in advance and it was still gorgeous when we went to serve it. The icing didn't run or melt and the cake layers were firm but so moist. Decorated with an apricot cut like a star in the center with whole pecans around the circumference.

What a disappointment. The frosting is extremely tart. The cake is ok; it does not rise very high, but it is moist. But that frosting! Blech!

Even good for a birthday cake! Try putting chopped and toasted walnut pieces on the sides of the cake.

A professional chef's mom told me this was the best cake she had ever had. Everyone loves this cake. I will definitely make it again.

I made this recipe for a large crowd. I doubled the cake recipe and used two rectangular pans. Everything turned out perfect. I only made one recipe of the frosting, so that was a little scimpy, but the flavor was so great that it didn't matter. I would definately make this again!

This cake was the best cake I have ever made! I added dried cranberries and walnuts. It was such a hit at my christmas dinner party. A perfect winter dessert!!! The apricot puree was totally worth the extra effort!

Great cake, had good reviews from my guests. I added some dried cranberries coated with sugar along with the apricot cut-out (lots of work on those) Well worth the effort.

Great dessert to end a dinner party. Everyone loved it. The cake was very moist. Didn't have the patience to decorate with the apricot leaves, but I don't think it matters. The icing is delicious.

I made this dessert for a company Thankgiving contest and got rave reviews, also beat out all other entries best tasting. After getting all the compliments from strangers, I will now feed one of these fabulous cakes to my family.

Apricots and pumpkin sounded like such a delicious combination, but i was not pleased (and i eat almost anything with sugar in it). i think the apricots soured it.

A wonderful cake. I made this for a family reunion. People loved it. There is a wonderful balance between the apricot and pumpkin.

This is a perfect fall recipe. It's a beautiful and really tasty cake that stays moist. The frosting is perfect for the cake. It takes a little time to make, but is well worth it for a special occasion.

Wonderful, flavorful cake with interesting combination of apricot and pumpkin. Frosting is perfect complement to the spice cake. It has become my favorite fall cake/dessert!

This cake intrigued me with its unusual combination of ingredients. It was easy to make and has a unique but not overpowering flavor and color. Excellent use for fresh pumpkin puree. It is very appealing visually and the taste is quite special. I cut back the cream cheese to 1 lb. and the sugar to 2 c. and still had lots of frosting left over. I think the remainder would taste great on a carrot cake!
