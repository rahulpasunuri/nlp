Absolutely delicious. This pie is a great treat - Its filling is only the gooey top layer of your typical store bought peacn pie, but for me, thats the best part! I recommend using a heavy NON-stick pan to do the caramel in, otherwise you'll spend ages scrubbing the caramel mixture off the pan. I too used my own crust, leftover from apple pie making. It worked fine.

Very good, very easy and very sweet!

This is excellent, although I found the cookie dough crust too sweet with the filling. Next time I'll make my own crust. I used an 11" tart pan so I made 1 1/2 x the nut filling and used cashews and pecans. A little different, beautiful and delicious.

Pretty, simple and absolutely delicious! Use a mix of nuts: 1 c. chopped pecans, 1/2 c. each of walnuts and almonds and 1/4 c. of pine nuts or cashews (more nuts than called for). Also works well using a muffin pan: put cookie dough (1 1/2 cookie) in each of 12 muffin cups, bake slightly less time (you'll still need to press down dough part way through baking), make the same amount of filling and spoon some into each cup. Very easy to remove after they've cooled some and very pretty too! Serve w/ premium vanilla bean ice cream.

A four star holiday dessert. Simple to make but looks flashy.

This quick and delicious recipe will definitely become a requested favorite anywhere you take it. I have used the refridgerated cookie dough and I have used my favorite tart crust recipe. Both are great. Use the cookie dough when pressed for time, but do use a tart crust if you really want to WOW. This is a "must try".

This way so easy to make, and received wonderful reviews at my mother's birthday party (we've given up cake in search of more interesting desserts for birthdays). I prefer a higher filling to crust ratio and used 1.5 recipes of the filling for a 10.5" tart pan...just right!

Wonderful caramel flavor. Even better than pecan pie. This is a very reliable recipe that's turned out great every time I've made it. I make my own crust though, because I think processed, store bought dough tastes a little off.

Excellent! Rave reviews, especially from pecan pie lovers. Don't press sugar cookie dough too far up the sides of tart pan--the cookie dough will fill in up the sides when you pre-bake. Otherwise, it will be difficult to remove pan.
