I'm not rating the recipe due to a couple of changes I made and the addition of another main ingredient. I followed the recipe, otherwise, but used a whole tin of anchovies, skipped the olives, used 1/3 lb of Italian sausage (mild), used half fresh and half dried basil from my patch, and a 14.5 oz. can of the beans-all I could find. It was very good paired with fresh baguettes from the oven to tame the saltiness, but would use maybe another tomato or two to temper this further, otherwise I'll have to reduce the anchovies :(. I'm a big fan of the saltiness from capers and anchovies, though and all of the flavors came through wonderfully. This smelled absolutely divine while I was making it, I did let it sit overnight in the fridge, so ingredients could mingle, and heated again slowly before serving. I'll definitely make this again.

Pretty tasty...fast and easy. I had to use canned tomatoes and it worked, but I don't doubt fresh would be superior.

Thought this was great. I grilled some italian turkey sausages and cut one up and added to my serving. I would agree to use good ingredients but you should always do that!

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be delicious! It's fabulous as a side dish but I think I would even like it by it's self for lunch with some grated parm on top. I do wish that thjadewolf would have just written her notes instead of giving a fork rating since she didn't follow the recipe.

Yummy! I did substitute a half can of Hunts Diced Italian Tomatoes with good success. These beans stick to your ribs and I totally agree that they would be the perfect mate to lamb shanks or a hearty Italian Beef stew. I pan fried pork loin chops in oregano and it was fast and delicious.

I feel I'm being unfair to the recipe by rating based on my experience, but perhaps I can serve as a warning to others: DO NOT substitute cheaper ingredients in this dish. I used canned tomatoes and plain black olives and my husband denied we had capers even though we did, and the result was extremely mediocre. Judging from the other reviews, if I'd sprung for good ingredients, it would have been delicious. I hope I can spare others this mistake.

Great side dish for lamb or italian meal. Cannot taste the anhovies, but they are required.

Very interesting blend of ingredients. To smooth out the tartness (acid), add one small carrot finely shredded. I would also simmer longer and add 1/2 teaspoon of ground oregano. Super dish for person like me who really likes anchovy fillets.

Although this is a three-forker, it's a great, reliable three-forker. Easy to make, a good accompaniment to many dishes, I have already served it several times, inevitably to ooh and ahs.

simple but good really. I have added green beans for a change but generally a quick veggie dish
