Only made the biscuit to make strawberry shortcake. I wanted a recipe that did not require butter and this one worked great.

I made this cobbler for 60 people, it is a very easy recipe to duplicate. I also added raspberries to the mix, it sweetened the mix. Great dish, love it.

This was really good. I liked the biscuit topping procedure. It was really easy, and I had never heard of using whipped cream before. You might want to consider placing a baking sheet of some kind under the cobbler, because I used a 2-qt. dish, and it still bubbled over quite a bit into the oven. But it was still great.

This was an excellent dessert. I made it for a group of friends and I had less than one serving left. We all gave it two thumbs up. I would however, cut down the water a bit so it is less soupy.

The biscuit is without butter?? Not nearly enough flour to make a dough to knead. I had to add another 1/2 to 3/4 cup.
