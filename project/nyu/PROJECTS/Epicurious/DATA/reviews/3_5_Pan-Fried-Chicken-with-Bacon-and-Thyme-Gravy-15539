If you add a nice helping of fresh diced garlic and season with salt the gravy is wonderful. Also, I fried the green onions in with the garlic and bacon over a spoonful of oil in the pan for 3-5 minutes before I added the gravy mixture. In the end the gravy was incredible. Oh, and ignore the flour/stock ratio...blend it to a texture that suits your preference for gravy. It doesn't have to be thick and gooey. I found that this is one of those recipes that works amazingly well if you use it as a guide and free yourself as a cook to create your own thing. My family and I loved it.

i made this last night and it was my first time ever preparing chicken. very easy, but i substituted thyme for sage, buttermilk for heavy cream, green onions for shallots and didn't have any cornmeal. i also doubled the recipe as i had several chicken breasts to cook. i thought it was delicious, and so did my boyfriend. the chicken was so tender we were afraid that i had undercooked it. the gravy was great, though i'd over-salted it slightly. in the future i would add the onions (shallots) to the pan before adding the broth to caramelize them a bit first. also, i'd use a higher quality bacon as the one i'd used wasn't enough to fry the chicken, and i ended up adding butter to stretch it.

We left out of green onions and put in white wine into the sauce. It was good but the sauce didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped. It was rich but plain. Next time we make it, we might add roasted garlic and onions.

Just made this last night- delicious! The posts are right, double your gravy and expect to add salt. People complain if there is too much salt so I can understand that BonAp left room for it to be added, the complaint that the gravy was bland can be remedied. The chicken should be salted on both sides, and the gravy should be salted to taste. This will be a staple in our weekly menu choices.

this was easy and tasty. Reviewer tips I used: doubled the gravy and pounded the breasts down. I too had trouble keeping the breading on, but chalk it up to my own inexperience. Wish I'd seen the tip to go easy on the salt in the gravy though! We were all pleasantly surprised with this one. I put on the rice when I started this recipe and within a half hour we were sitting down to dinner. Mmmm. My two year old loved it.

The chicken took way longer than the recipe said it would, and next time I'll pound it flat. That said, this was really good. I used veggie stock and approximately tripled it, and simmered it for a long time, and the gravy was very good. I had been tempted to omit the bacon, but I'm glad I didn't--it was the perfect touch.

Eh... it was okay. Everything was black before the chicken was done. We dumped the gravy because it came out a yucky gray color. My husband really liked the chicken; it did nothing for me, although it was quite juicy. Maybe I should have pounded the chicken flat. I will make it again just to see how it comes out a second time since it does have potential. I make cornmeal crusted chicken all the time, so I don't know what went wrong with this one. Maybe it was the buttermilk... who knows. It didn't make it into the top 3 worst meal experiments of all time in this house.

The chicken part was great. The gravy did nothing for me. I doubled the gravy recipe, as others suggested, but that gave me way too much. The gravy was too thick, even after I thinned it with additional chicken stock, and it was bland.

I made this for dinner last night and it got rave reviews. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the gravy recipe. It tasted and looked fantastic.

An excellent, easy dish. I made if for friends for New Year's Eve dinner, served with a salad and biscuits it made a hearty and tasty main dish. The flavors balanced very well, the gravy was rich and appealing... I'll definately be making this one again. I did double the gravy, as others had suggested, and added no salt at all. I also used stock from the pan instead of water to mix with the flour before stirring it in to the gravy. Yum!

Like the cook from D.C., I had a little trouble making the breading stick during the frying--would appreciate any tips on avoiding this in the future. Otherwise, everyone agreed that the flavors were wonderful. Definitely use fresh thyme and double the sauce--it's worth it.

Really delicious! It tastes better than it looks, but I'm a better cook than I am a chef. I made this with biscuits and fresh green beans.

Chicken was good, but found the gravy not good at all. Maybe fresh herbs would do the trick.

I was out of cornmeal and buttermilk and green onion. But this recipe sounded good enough to try to fudge it. I used just flour, substuted milk mixed with 1 tsp of vinegar, and skipped the green onions. It was STILL delicious. Served over extra creamy mashed red potatos with skin on, the flavors were even more enhanced. I didn't double the gravy, but wish I had. I will be making this many more times in the future, to be sure.

I used turkey bacon and added butter for more oil. It was delicious and relatively quick. I definitely agree with doubling the gravy recipe! Paired it with Annie's Aged Wisonsin Macaroni and a salad with Ranch dressing. Great week day dining!

An outstanding chicken dish! I've made this one over and over.

I used a whole chicken and tripled the gravy. I actually deep fried the chicken in corn oil and it was outstanding. I am making it again tonight!

Rather dissapointed in all. The actual fried chicken was fine, but nothing special. Found the gravy boring & too salty.

I doubled the gravy for this recipe the first time I made it; next time I would triple it. Served it with roasted red potatoes and rosemary which tasted great with the sauce. Chicken needs to cook a little bit longer than specified, though.

Very tasty (and I don't even like chicken)! Definitely double the sauce.

Loved this recipe. Very quick and easy with little mess and lots of flavor. I would probably doubly the amount of gravy next time as there wasn't much with the standard amounts the recipe called for. Other than that, fantastic dish.

this is an easy and delicious recipe. I served this with the collard greens miniera from the January 2001 Gourmet. Great and easy meal.

I fried the chicken in olive oil. The chicken was very good but the gravy was bland. It needed something else, maybe lemon zest.

I think this recipe would be greatly enhanced if you avoid cooking the chicken in the bacon drippings. I plan to try it again by draining the drippings and cooking the chicken in some olive oil, then proceed with the recipe as is. Don't lose hope, this is the first out of several dozen recipies that I have tried from Bon Apetit that I would rate with just one fork.

it took me longer than the 45 minutes that the recipe said it would take, but organization in the kitchen is not one of my strong suits. I might use a little less thyme in the future.

I enjoyed this recipe-- especially the tasty gravy. Because of the bacon, the gravy was a bit salty, so be sure to use low salt broth. I did have trouble keeping the cornmeal coating on the chicken. I'm not a fried chicken expert-- perhaps someone else can offer advice in that area.
