Lindt chocolate

These are now a family favorite . Instead of cutout cookies I rolled the dough into logs in waxed paper and refrigerated them for a couple of hours.( probably 1hour would do) and then sliced them and baked them. After they cooled I drizzled Lindt white chorale over the tops. Pretty to look at and oh so yummy.

I must say -- I was totally disappointed with this recipe. I read all the reviews, including the ones that mentioned how hard the dough was to work with, but I figured (1) I was up for the challenge, and (2) I'm pretty experienced with baking so no problem. Well, this wasn't dough -- it was crumbs. You don't really roll it out -- you smoosh it flat and cut with cookie cutter. Good luck getting it thin. But the real kicker was, they don't taste very good (note: I used Frangelico instead of rum -- but I can't imagine that's what makes them taste so yuck). These are SOOOO not worth the effort or expense. What a bummer -- I wouldn't recommend this recipe at all.

OMG. These cookies are amazing. It's true they're not much to look at unless you decorate them, but the flavor more than makes up for that. As for cutting them out, it's essential to release both the top sheet of parchment and the bottom one before cutting. Then it will be a cinch.

This is totally yummy! Substitution: use Frangelico hazelnut liqueur instead of the rum... very tasty!

I made these last year for gift boxes and they were extremely well-received. Yes, they are very time-consuming and not as simple as the usual cut-out, but they're worth it! Last year I had to chop the hazelnuts by hand, but got a food processor for Christmas, so I'm expecting this year's batch to go a bit faster. The thickness of the cookie determines it's chewiness or crispiness. As a previous reviewer mentioned, they do look unappetizing without frosting. I recommend making the dough one day, doing the cutting and baking another, and frosting them on a third day. The frosting can be used sparingly, too, so you won't have to spend hours. I used holiday cutters and turned stars into snowflakes with icing, or added a scarf and hat to a snowman. This year I plan to use flavored frosting to complement the rich chocolate cookies (I'm thinking peppermint, orange, raspberry, maybe chili).

These are delicious, very chocolately and crisp. The dough was very easy to work with and they held their shape perfectly after baking. I drizzled them with white chocolate after baking. Very nice. What is the big deal and so much "hard work" about rolling out dough? Becomes easlier with practice. Mich. cook

These are now my favorite cookie. Yes, they were time consuming to make, but worth it. I plan to try rolling the dough into a log and slicing them rather than rolling them out and using a cookie cutter.

Yeah, that was hard work. Still think the cookies are delicious. Recommend using the freshest butter, the best cocoa and 1.5 t of almond extract if you have no rum.

These cookies have a nice rich taste, and my back turned out with just the right amount of crispy-ness, but I gave this recipe a two fork rating for two reasons. First, they are a pain to make. I was hoping for more of a roll-out cookie that the whole family could enjoy, but since they are difficult to work with, it's really a one-person job. And watch the oven. All my cookies baked in less than 12 minutes, and they burn quickly. Second, the cookies without icing do not look very appealing. And by the time you have finished with the cookies, there is little energy left for the icing.

These cookies take a while to make, but are tasty! MIne ended up being a bit more chewy than the ones in the picture look (drier and crispy). Still wonderful
