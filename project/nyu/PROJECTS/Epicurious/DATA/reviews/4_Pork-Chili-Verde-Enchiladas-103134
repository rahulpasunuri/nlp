What a FANTASTIC recipe! I amazed myself. A lot of steps and it takes a while, but well worth the time and effort. I used 2 poblano chiles in the sauce because I like the heat and I charred all of the chiles on a gas grill. Absolutely the best enchiladas I've ever eaten. As others have suggested, I'll try with chicken next time.

Great recipe! Added a dollop of a homemade mole sauce I had frozen a while back. Nice addition but not necessary as the flavors were incredible. On a low sodium kick and this recipe definitely fell in line with this diet restriction!

Excellent - well worth the time. The first time I made these for a dinner party and got rave reviews from everyone. Followed the receipe for the sauce to the letter and there was sufficient. Next time made extra batch to freeze and used with chicken enchiladas - also excellent. The pork chili verde enchiladas were totally amazing and worth the effort - but took some time to put filling together - best enchiladas I've ever served (or had) Relatively simple to make the sauce (and went well with chicken enchiladas too).

Agree with other reviewers, this recipe is good but takes a very long time to make (3 hours). I didn't realize that he pork chili took almost 2 hours to make.

Really good! These are tasty both as enchiladas or a nice bowl of "Chili". I did use a mix of Poblanos and Anaheim chilies. Looking forward to trying this with chicken too.

The first time we made this I don't know what I was thinking ang bought passilla peppers instead of anaheims. The outcome was still delicious despite my goof. We do like it a bit hotter, so we tend to add additional peppers to the tomatillo sauce to up the heat. We've made the chili verde several times since then (often using a combination of passillas and anaheims) and use it for the enchiladas as well as just eating it over rice or with chips. We often start the chili verde on Sunday and let it cook overnight in the crockpot until we're ready to eat dinner Monday. Cooking it that long makes the pork shred really nicely and makes the entire house smell amazing! It's become a favorite at our house.

Yes, a bit of work but wow - amazing flavours. I used leftover roasted pork leg that had been brined and crusted with garlic and chipotles in adobo, and that was a great start. I added a bit of other chiles (pasilla and ancho), used monterey jack. Heated the corn tortillas for 3 - 4 minutes in a 350 oven on a baking sheet sprayed with pam, 6 tortillas at a time, then dipped in sauce. Otherwise, stuck to the recipe. Amazing result! loved it!

As other reviews have mentioned, these enchiladas do require some time to make. The finished dish is worth it, though. Next time I would add a little more heat. The recipe as written is pretty mild. This is definitely not a recipe to make every day, but it's a great recipe of you want to while away a few hours in the kitchen.

I forgot to add that I used the slow-cooker to make the pork so that it was ready in the evening for assembly. Not so time-consuming this way.

Fantastic! Pretty healthy as far as enchiladas go. Has replaced my previous decadent version.

These are delicious, but don't be deceived by the easiness of this recipe. It requires pre-made pork chili verde, which is where the full deliciousness comes in - painstaking slow cooking. Count on a full afternoon to make this.

This was a labor intensive recipe made over a two day period. My wife and daughter liked it immensely - 4 forks. I find it hard to make this again as I thought it was probably in the 3 - 3 1/2 fork range. I liked the fragrance given off by the cumin seeds after they were toasted and subsequently ground.

I cheated, I bought the frozen chile verde at Costco, and went from there! My boyfriend says he's never tasted better! We added extra chiles, as he likes everything HOT! HIGHLY recommend this!

The sauce was amazing. Forgive me for not making the entire recipe but it is over 100 degrees outside. I marinated some diced up steak in cumin, garlic, salt and lime then served it chili verde style with traditional rice and beans. I can't wait to try the pork. Delicious!

Rating: 4
incredible flavor in this dish! I made it with the ranch beans, everything according to the recipe, and it was astoundingly good. I was in the mood to cook, which is lucky because this took me about five hours from start to finish. The cheeses are wonderful, the verde sauce rich and delicious, the pork to die for. Next time I'll double the pork as other folks have suggested- this much work, I'd like to live off the proceeds for a few meals. My wife and I scarfed this up in a single sitting- but we were ravenous. Go, make it!

I made this recipe for a group of friends at a mexican potluck the year it came out.I used shredded chicken and carmelized onions for the filling and got rave reviews and recipe requests! This year I planted tomatillas in my garden which are growing out of control.I didnt want to dig through my endless cooking mags so I thought I would give my old friend epicurious a shot and was siked to find it there!!! Cant wait for dinner,yum yum!

All-in-all, delicious. Not quite restaurant quality enchiladas, though. Couldn't find asadero, used chiuaua cheese and monterey jack instead-- yum. The pork was simply not flavorful enough. Will try marinading it next time. Recipe is time consuming but not difficult: cook pork one day, enchiladas the next. The sauce is very important for the flavor. I made extra and guest poured it on top. Watch the jalapenos, I used 1/8 of the recommended quantity and it still had heat. Probably varies with the jalapeno variety.

This recipte has good flavor, but if I were to make it again I'd use a pork roast and then shred the meat after cooking. I think it would have better flavor and texture.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. It was pretty time consuming, but it wasn't as bad as some people have made it out to be. You want time consuming--try Cook's Illustrated's chicken pot pie. This recipe will seem like nothing in comparison. I think that the worst part was roasting all the chilies, but it occurred to me that if I had had a creme brulee torch, it would have been much easier. I agree with another reviewer who said that they prefer their pork in shreds rather than in chunks, so I may cut it into larger pieces next time, and then shred the pork. I would also suggest adding salt as it cooks rather than just at the end. I actually happened to find Asadero cheese, but I didn't know it at the time. It turns out that it goes by a couple other names --look it up under this site's food dictionary. It's true that Montery Jack is a fine substitute--Asadero is like a better version of it. Overall, I think that this recipe is very much worth trying.

These were amazing. I followed the recipe but instead of the asadero, I used queso fresco and it worked perfectly. Also instead of the pork shoulder, I used pork butt and it worked great as well. Better than any Mexican restaurant enchiladas!

I've been making this to rave reviews ever since it was first published. Everyone loves the authentic flavor; well worth the prep time.

This is exceptionally tasty. The flavors in this dish made exactly as wrtten is beyond your standard enchilada recipe. It is a bit time consuming but not impossible. I made the chili verde right before makng the enchiladas so I didn't chill it and everything worked out fine. This will be standard fare for company in my house if the company appreciates good Mexican food.

I agree with cook from somewhere who used chicken. Done both and chicken is the BEST. I simplified by assembling lasagna style. Made my own salsa verde by cooking tomatillos, onions, fresh cilantro in canned chicken broth. Used immersion blender for sauce. I added a fresh salsa on the side. Huge success!

I tested this recipe this weekend (on my family) and plan on making it for a group of 12 later this month. My family enjoyed the enchilidas - they have a great flavor - but wanted to know if there was something I could do to make the tortillas not so "soggy". Could not locate the asadero cheese so I used Fontina and it tasted great.

Rating: 3
I prefer saucy enchiladas, so I doubled the sauce. I also kept the pork in larger chunks when cooking, so the shreds were larger. Overall this recipe is a lot of work. One might even double the pork and eat it in soft tacos to get the most out from the effort. With the added flavor from the doubled sauce, these are excellent enchiladas.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic dish, yet not something that is just a "whip together" kind of deal. I use chicken instead of pork and like it much better. The fire roasted peppers and proper amounts of cilantro make or break this dish ... follow the recipe and you won't be upset.

These are great. These enchiladas have a very authentic taste. Love the roasted peppers. It is time consuming, but it's great to make the pork and sauce the day before. Assembly is a snap. Heating the tortillas in the microwave instead of quickly frying in oil seemed a bit unorthodox, but truly, didn't seem to make a difference. These are excellent.

I have made this dish many many times and it is probably the ONE DISH my husband requests and looks forward too - i only fix it during the cooler months. I dont use pork, instead I boil a chicken and use the chicken in the enchiladas, and then use the fresh broth in the sauce! WONDERFUL! worth the work. its easier if you do the sauce and chicken one day, and the assembly the next.

This is a fantastic recipe for enchiladas! Less heavy and fat laden than traditional and so much better! Yes, it takes some time, but well worth the effort. I didn't change a thing!

Although asadero cheese and fresh tomatillos are unavailable here, we went ahead anyway with Monterey Jack and canned tomatillos - results were terrific! Made them a few days ago and even assembling them with lots of kids was really fun. We usually shy away from this type of food 'cause it is a bit heavy but it really is deelish!!

Oh, forgot to add: Make your own corn tortillas from masa harina. It completes the recipe. Home made are easier to work with (no cracking), and the taste is AWESOME. One of my guests asked what brand of corn tortillas I used.

EXCELLENT DISH. Made this for party of 8 with excellent reviews. Served it with Mexican Black Beans (recipe at this site). Changes: Used 4 lbs of pork, cut up and put in crock pot. USE LESS chicken broth (only use 1 cup). Season with ample salt, added oregano. To the sauce, added fresh epazote for spectacular flavor. No need to double sauce. Must use the cheese asadero - it makes the recipe. 4 lbs of pork made about 28 enchiladas (leftovers excellent).

My family loved this recipe. Being Hispanic and from Texas, I find my self unable to find authentic tasting recipes here in the Northwest. This one tops my list. I make it with homemade tortillas and Ranch beans. Try experinenting with different types of chilis, such as Ancho, for a more spicy version. This is a winner.

Time-consuming? Yes. Worth it? Heck yeah! Despite the fact that the chili and the tomatillo sauce both took WAY longer to reduce than the scant hour the recipe suggests (like twice as long), it was worth it in the end. Didn't buy enough Anaheims (I misread the recipe), so used reconstituted Pasilla peppers instead - not bad, would would probably have preferred the original ingredients instead. No matter - the recipe was still great. I didn't end up with much sauce left over after I dipped all the tortillas, but then again, the recipe yielded more enchiladas than I thought it would. Couldn't find stright Asadero, but used a combination of Mexican cheeses, which included Asadero and it worked well. Will scour the Latino markets next time I attempt this recipe.

MMMMM GOOD! Best enchiladas ever! Next time I'll make a double batch because they were such a hit in our home.. I followed the recipie exactly- make sure you have the time to do it right because it's worth it! One caution, however- be careful chopping and handling those jalapenos..they can irritate sensitive hands-either use gloves or handle the peppers with a fork and knife-you'll be glad you did!

I have only made the Pork Chili Verde portion of this recipe, still it's one of the most memorable dishes I have ever made. It delivered in more ways than most, and I have surprised guests with it since several times. Great flavor, and worth every bit of the effort to make it. Worth doubling.

We agree, this is one amazing dish! It was the hit of a Cinqo de Mayo party yesterday; I only wish I had another pan of them for today. Although the peppers are pretty time-intensive, the roasted flavor they add is to die for. Try!

This was the most amazing dish! My husband literally picked every scrap out of the pan, my Mother (who had already had dinner) kept picking from the pan. It does take time, but every moment is worth it. You could cut down the chili roasting time by purchasing canned fire-roasted green chilis, but I don't know that it would be the same. I, too, could not find Asadero cheese and used a combination of Jack and Pepper Jack.

Fan-Freakin'-Tastic! The pork cooked down with the aneheims is the reak deal. And the tomatillo sauce is amazing. Do yourself a favor and skip the corn tortillos: use regular flour ones instead. Also, buy REPUTABLE cheese: go to a real Mexican market to get it, not your supermarket, there is some real bad stuff out there.

I followed the recipe exactly but thought this recipe was very bland. Maybe it was the wrong time of year for the peppers - I did use fresh peppers (I love the smell of roasting peppers). I will make it again, but I will add lots more peppers, more tomatillos and some more spices of some kind.

I couldn't find the cheese but jack and/or mozzarella seemed to work well. I wonder, however, what asadaro tastes like and if it make a difference. I like the fact that the tortillas were not dipped in oil. I used low fat sour cream and that worked well.

Yum, yum, yum! Loved this! Yes, it was a lot of work, but it wasn't overwhelming - a lot of inactive time involved. This even surrvived me making a big mistake...I misread the recipie and used 8 chilies for the enchilada sauce and 2 for the verde. I also used a few pablanos. The pork was very tender, and my guests loved it. I thought the sauce was very hot, but no one else did.

A friend of mine and I take turns having dinner parties based on recipes in the magazine. She picked a very labor-intensive choice, but it was well worth it - the dish was amazing. She also made the tortilla soup that appeared in the menu - it too was delicious. I agree about the beans - they were nothing special. When I have the time to devote, I'll definitely make these enchiladas for guests.

This dish tasted absolutely perfect. I don't even like Mexican style dishes usually but this one was awesome. Everyone I fed it to still asks when I will make it again.

I made this recipe with the beans and all as soon as I saw it in my subscription. Came out great. The chili was a little bland so I ended up putting in some extra seasonings. I prepared most of this on a Saturday and served it on Sunday. It is time consuming.

I made this for a small dinner party I had. I had one person say, "this is the best Mexican food I ever had" and my friend's father call me the following day (he was lucky enough to try the leftovers) say "I never like Mexican food before. You've changed me." It was a huge hit! I will definitely make it again. There is a lot of prep that goes into it so be prepared.
