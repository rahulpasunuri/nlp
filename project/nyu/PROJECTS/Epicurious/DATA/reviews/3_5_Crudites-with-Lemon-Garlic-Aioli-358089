Everybody loved the dip. I didn't have Tabasco so I used Crystal hot sauce. So simple to make. highly recommend for crudite platter.

Loved it! Subbed half greek yogurt so it wasn't so heavy. Otherwise made as-is and it was great both on raw veggies and on the little quinoa patties on this site. Will definitely make again.

I liked this aioli a lot, but I should have halved the recipe. I used sriracha sauce because I was out of tabasco, and I actually used the aioli as a dipping sauce for french fries.
