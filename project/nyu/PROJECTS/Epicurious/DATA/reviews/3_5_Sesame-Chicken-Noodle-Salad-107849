I didn't have a garlic-pepper sauce so I substituted with 1 tablespoon Siracha Chili Sauce and one large minced garlic clove. It gave the noodles a latent warmth. Delicious!

I made two versions of this last night, one with real chicken and one with vegetarian chicken, and both turned out very well. I made the full sauce recipe for each, but when the pound of pasta was done, we ended up splitting it between the two bowls. I was afraid it would be too saturated as a result, but it's actually fine as it is. We also added steamed snow peas, and sauteed carrots and bean sprouts since it was begging for veggies. I also didn't add any of the vegetable oil; the sesame oil seemed to be plenty.

We loved this! I used a rotisserie chicken from the store which made it all very easy. I am hopeful that the leftovers will ben even better tomorrow.

This is so easy to make & delicious. I marinated chicken breasts in the dressing before baking which really added some zip. As others, I added some broccoli [next time will add red peppers, any veggies would mix well]. Took everyones advice & only used 1 tbs chili-garlic sauce & it was still very hot & spicy. I will definitely make this again!

This is delicious & so easy & quick to make! I marinated chicken breasts in the dressing before baking which really added some zip. Like others, I added some broccoli [next time will add red peppers, any veggies would mix well]. Took everyones advice & only used HALF the chili-garlic sauce & it was still very hot & spicy. Do not use more! I will definitely make this again!

so good! I made a few changes based on others' recommendations. Halved the chili-garlic sauce and the pasta. Omitted the cilantro (don't care for it) and I was out of green onions. Next time I'll definitely include green onions, but really loved it even without them. Portions were perfect for me with the adjustments!

I've now made this recipe on 3 separate occasions and am about to make it again for a barbecue this evening. This recipe is outstanding with a few minor modifications...1 teaspoon chili-garlic sauce will keep it appealing for the masses...and a variety of lightly steamed veggies for crunch and balance. I like broccoli, strips of carrot and red peppers. This tastes even better cold the next day!

I doubled the dressing and added red pepper, carrots and garlic. Also, the second time I made it, I followed another reviewer's advice and made soup. Yummy both ways.

Hubby really like this. I made 1/2 of the recipe to serve 2, and cut the vegetable oil to 1 Tbs. and the hot chili sauce to 1/2 Tbs. Used 6-1/2 oz. vermicelli and 1-1/2 cups chicken. These proportions worked well, but next time I would cut the chicky back just a bit because I added sliced red and green bell peppers, sliced baby carrots, and toasted sesame seeds, and it turned out to be quite a lot of food for 2. Will make this many times.

My family really liked this dish. I used what I had on hand: angel hair pasta, chopped red onion instead of green onion, and apple cider vinegar instead of the rice wine vinegar. I also added snap peas and sliced red pepper. I omitted the cilantro and ginger and did not feel the flavor was lacking at all. The leftovers were great too.

Made 1 1/2 times the dressing, and waited until just before serving to add a little more dressing to taste. The flavor seems to fade as it cools. Cut the chicken in half and bought the frozen roasted chicken breast strips to save time (make sure you do not get the kind with a smoke-flavor added). Added toasted sesame seeds and snow pea pods. Tastes best served warm, but still good cold.

2 days later... I actually made soup out of the leftovers by adding them to some homemade chicken stock. With a little additional soy sauce it was quite good!

I used the Thai chili-garlic sauce and it was HOT! Next time I would reduce the amount by half. Also added steamed green beans and red cabbage for color and crunch. Used 4 chicken breasts.

this is a favorite! I add peapods and waterchest nuts for crunch. Quick, easy and very tastey!

The proportion of chicken to pasta is rather ridiculous. Half the amount is sufficient. In my opinion this recipe really needs the addition of broccoli, etc. The sauce is quite nice though.

Rating: 2
This was OK, nothing special. Perhaps it would have been better if I had used vermicelli or spaghetti, rather than gemelli pasta, which is hard to pick up with a fork. I added lots of steamed vegies and almost doubled the sauce. Anyway, it is a pretty good and fast way to use up leftover chicken. Problem is, now I have lots of leftover pasta and chicken!

All the proportions are good, but something green and crunchy is needed. I used broccoli, but snow peas and water chestnuts would have been welcome too. I added a teaspoon of honey, and whole wheat pasta and low-sodium soy made the recipe more healthful. Excellent dish, allowing many variations.

This was really good for a simple meal with the family. Unlike others, I thought the amount of vegetable oil and green onions was fine. I made it with chicken the first night; then the next night I added shrimp to the leftovers. Very good. But I used 'Viet Nam Style Chili-Garlic Sauce.' I only used 1/3 of what the recipe called for, but it was so, so hot! So be careful!

I've made this dish twice in just a few days. Delicious. If my kids weren't eating it, I'd add more garlic chili sauce though and fire it up a bit more.

This is a great recipie. It keeps for quite awhile in the fridge, so it is good as a leftover too. I made it for some vegetarians, so I skipped the chicken and added tomatoes and snap peas instead.

Excellent dish hot or cold and works well for leftovers. Like others, I added other ingredients such as tofu, red pepper, broccoli. The vermicelli (rice noodles) package size of 13oz was also plenty for this recipe.

I made this according to the recipe with the exception of adding fresh mint in place of the cilantro - I had it on hand. Overall an excellent easy salad. Even better the next day.

Excellent recipe. The only modification I made to it was reduced the amount of vegetable oil and green onions. Next time I will try adding some red bell pepper, shredded carrot and shrimp or grilled prawns instead of the chicken.

Absolutely wonderful. I added 2 red peppers and a bunch of asparagus, increased the chicken, cut back on the oil for the sauce and didn't put it all in the dish. Also added toasted sesame seeds. So great!

My family really enjoyed the flavor of this dish. For the most part, I followed the recipe as written. However, I did up the chicken quite a bit & added toasted sesame seeds. I will make it again & the only change I will make is to increase the chili-garlic sauce. Others may not wish to do this before trying the original recipe--we just like a lot of spice & heat. I also used whole wheat thin spaghetti.

In response to the question about sesame oil - unless the recipe specifically calls for untoasted, I believe it's best to use dark sesame oil. It has significantly more flavor.

Rating: 0
Please help!!! I have been wanting to know the answer to this Question. When a recipe says "sesame oil", is this the dark toasted kind or the yellow kind that looks like regular oil. I think that I have been messing up recipes for years not knowing the answer. I wanted to try this recipe but don't know which one to use. thanks for any help.

I loved this dish! I left out the ginger b/c I don't care for it. I added sliced radishes, canned baby corn, and shredded carrots. It was colorful and tasted wonderful. I wasn't sure what garlic chili sauce was so I used garlic Tabasco sauce and it was fine.

What great flavor!! This was a hit with my family. I reduced the oil and onions as recommended and it turned out great. We will make this many times over.

It comes out with a huge amount of pasta (one pound is a lot!) to relatively little chicken. So I upped the chicken amount and my family said it still wasn't enough. They loved the taste though! I took the advice to add carrots and cabbage and to decrease the green onion amount, which worked well. I didn't think there was too much dressing at all, because there was such a massive quantity of pasta to soak it all up. But my family did a number on the huge dish, and we barely had any leftovers. Will make it again!

A GREAT alternative for the usual picnic noodle salad! Though I added 1 tbsp of sugar to cut the bite of the vinegar, and added some shredded carrot and chopped red cabbage for crunch and color. Also, make sure to add sesame seeds! EASY AND FLAVORFUL!

Really quick and easy and tasty too. My husband claimed that leftovers the next day were even better than the original. My grocery store was out of cilantro (horrors!) so I didn't use any, yet still I didn't feel as though anything was missing.

Rating: 3
Quick, easy, and good; much better than I expected, to be honest! I left out the cilantro, as I didn't have any, and doubt I'll add it when I remake the recipe. (I don't think it needs it.) I didn't use all the dressing (recipe makes a lot) and probably will use less vegetable oil next time (as someone else suggested.) Also, I shredded rather than chopped the chicken, as I think that works better for this kind of dish.

This recipe is so easy to make -- and tastes like you spent a lot of time in the kitchen. Instead of chicken, I used shrimp. I also added snow peas to the recipe. My husband went crazy over this dish -- I'll definitely make this again and again and will probably spice it up a bit next time.

Rating: 3
We loved this! It was easy to make. It definitely has some heat, which we love. But, if you are making it for a crowd, you may want to cut back on the chili-garlic paste. You could always set some out for those who may want to spice it up. I plan on making this again.

This dish has excellent asian flavor and is easy to whip up once you've got the right ingredients. I serve it semi-warm for better flavor. I also added a little sugar and 1/4 cup of sesame seeds to the sauce. I love this recipe, I've already made it three times.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I used diced (grilled) teriyaki chicken instead of just "cooked" chicken. Next time I plan on substituting shrimp for the chicken.

This was only an okay recipe -- maybe because I took one of the "Variations on a Theme" suggestions and used scrambled eggs rather than chicken. I would make it again because it was quick and not bad tasting and it came together very quickly but I would not serve it to company.

This was extremely HOT! I think 2 tablespoons of the chili-garlic sauce (at least the one I used) was too much. It was impossible to taste anything else due to the peppery heat. We actaully gave up eating it because it was uncomfortable to eat. I will try it again using only 1 teaspoon next time.
