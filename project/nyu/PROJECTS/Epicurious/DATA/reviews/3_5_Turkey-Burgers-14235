I put the mayo directly into the turkey, and had problems with them being too wet and they fell apart. Don't make that mistake! I also added artichoke- yum!

These burgers are awesome, but my friends and I (by mistake the 1st time, but on purpose after that) have taken to putting the mayo and basil straight into the ground turkey with all of the other ingredients. It makes the burgers more moist and they hold together better. We also recommend a slice of fresh mozzerella on top. They are always a tasty treat. Extra olives and tomatoes never hurts

I really love these burgers. I use low-fat Miracle Whip for the dressing, and cook the burgers on a George Foreman grill (reduces fat even more, and it's quick).

Good (and healthful too) but a tad dry. The Curried Turkey Burgers on this site are better. I agree that the basil mayo must be an important part of this recipe, because the basil mayo alone tasted awful (because I used fat-free, sigh) yet burgers tasted even better when accompanied with the basil mayo! Go figure. Next time, I may try increasing the olives, tomatoes, and thyme by 25% or so.

Outstanding flavors. I highly recommend this as an alternative to beef burgers on the grill. The Mayonaise is a key element, but the burgers as well are simply wonderful.

These are the best turkey burgers! I've made them three times, the only thing I do differently is make more of the mayonnaise. I cook them in a cast iron skillet and everyone raves. I serve them with oven roasted rosemary potato wedges. Definitely a keeper.
