Great for an elegant and easy first course/entree. I ended up getting huge "dry" scallops and so it was generous as a first course. Really could be a meal, but it was the holidays, so it was an indulgence! I also could not get endive so used baby spinach and it was very good (though the endive would have provided better color contrast with the beans). I had no problems as others have written about the curry; the flavors balanced well.

Really good. I ate this as an appetizer but it could also be usedas an entree salad. Steam green beans for a few minutes and chill before you addd them to the salad.

Exquisite and very easy to prepare. Blend of flavors is sensational and the presentation lovely. Excellent light summer/spring main course. Make sure to add truffle oil at the very end.

This is in response to the cook from Massachusetts. What was your point about the curry powder? Your sentences seem contradictory. Maybe the problem was in your technique or ingredients. As I had commented before, I thought this recipe made a great first course. We enjoyed it with champagne. I thought the curry powder blended well with the other flavors. The truffle oil really made this dish special.

Come on, what were you people talking about? This was just a nothing of a salad. The flavors were not complimenting each other, the curry powder had no business being on the scallops in this dish and the dressing did nothing for me! Sure, we ate it, but it wasn't worth the effort. I don't think I would like it without the curry powder. Sorry folks, this wasn't for me!

This is a wonderful melange of flavors and textures! I preferred the scallops without the curry powder, however....just seasoned with salt & freshly ground white pepper and sauteed. I also drizzled on a little extra truffle oil to finish. I served it with Gainey '98 Sauvignon Blanc, which was excellent. Incidentally, 4 minutes is about double the time for cooking the haricots verts properly, and the amounts given for the entire salad are way too much for a first course, if you want any appetite left for soup, main course, or dessert. This would make a nice main course lunch. Truffle oil rules! :-)))
