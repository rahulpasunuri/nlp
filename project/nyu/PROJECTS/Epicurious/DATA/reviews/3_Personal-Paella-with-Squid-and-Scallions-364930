I found this to be delicious! I doubled the recipe, and added a little more paprika and saffron than called for and just a pinch of cumin. Also added 1/2 lb of shrimp. Otherwise, stuck to the recipe. Only thing I would change is less liquid, there was too much left after putting it in the oven. I couldn't quite get the browned bottom because of it. Very easy, and will definitely make again!

i had high hopes for this recipe, the smoked paprika & saffron simmering in fish stock, shallots sauteeing with garlic,smelled so amazing! i sat down with my reisling (recommended wine pairing) and tasted...blah. i tried to add more salt but then it was just salty blah. i don't even want the leftovers. the reisling was great
