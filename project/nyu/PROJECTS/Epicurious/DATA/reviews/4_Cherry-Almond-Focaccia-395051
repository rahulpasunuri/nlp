This is a great and very simple recipe. We also found that it was best the day it was baked, but the leftovers were still very tasty. I am looking forward to trying some of the other recipes from this dough.

Correction: I stated that the recipe seemed to lack at least one ingredient; anyone wishing to make this recipe needs to click on "Master Sweet Dough" at top of ingredients list to make that dough as a base for the final focaccia. Sorry!

Recipe seems to be missing something...like flour?

This was an excellent recipe; the dough was quite simple to make, and the presentation was beautiful and unusual. It was best on the day it was made.
