As someone who is not a great fan of roast turkey, I made this dish hoping for something a little different, and I was very pleased with the results. Mine came out more or less as a soup. Turkey actually makes a wonderful broth and this recipe takes full advantage of that, adding just a few extra ingredients that really bring the flavor to life. Very simple recipe and yet very refined flavor.
