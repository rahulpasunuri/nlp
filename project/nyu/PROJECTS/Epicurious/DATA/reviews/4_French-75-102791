This is a great cocktail. Everyone loved it - it did get the party off to a bang! It's the perfect combination of tartness and sweetness, and the champagne makes it very festive!

Awesome! I mixed all the ingredients but the champagne in a cocktail mixer, as suggested by a previous reviewer, and then topped up long thin champagne flutes with champagne, which helped with the lethal dose of alcohol. Everyone loved them. If you enjoyed these, try the Amazonia champagne cocktail - both are great

FANTASTIC! I'm turning people who are not fans of gin onto this drink, and have given out the recipe a number of times. I've also been making my own simple syrup, using raw sugar, which gives it a warm color. Cheers!

Not sure where the recipe came from... but we make them with cointreau, brandy, a twist of lemon and then the champagne. Oh so good - but two is the limit!

I made this drink for a Christmas Eve party, I was surprised that even the guys loved it! It's a strange combination, but very smooth and tasty. I used triple sec instead of sugar. Just don't drink too many, it really sneaks up on you. Not surprising since its all booze besides the lemon juice!

I served this for my birthday party and it was a total hit. It was a delicious and unique drink that was easy on the pallet. I did get some reports the next day of a few headaches because of the mixture of gin with champagne. Hmmm, maybe they were so good they had a few too many.

Do not make this in a collins glass. Shake everything except for the champagne in a cocktail shaker, pour into a flute and top with champagne.
