'As we speak', this recipe is cooking in the oven. I've made it numerous times. It's fast and easy and delicious. Today I'm cooking mushrooms, cauliflower and potatoes with the chicken; I put a rub all over the chicken pieces and refrigerated for about an hour before putting in the oven. As long as I follow the basic recipe - chicken quartered, liquid in the pan, 500 degrees - it has always turned out well. Hope it does the same for you.

My husband made this recipe as written and it was delicious. The chicken was moist and looked beautiful. It's a keeper for a quick and tasty dish.

Good, easy to follow. Not the best chicken I have made and/or eaten - but if you are looking for something filling for the family and without difficulty - this is it.

This was delicious. I appreciate (and used) the suggestions. It was even better the next day

Some of the reviews here almost scared me off, but I took a chance and I'm glad I did. Absolutely delicious. Very moist meat and very crispy skin. I did make some modifications tho, based on other reviewer comments: Doubled the lemon juice, substituted Sauvignon Blanc for chicken broth, added five sliced garlic cloves to the potatoes/onions, skipped the zucchini (doubled the potatoes), added dried thyme (one pinch per piece, under the skin), added dried rubbed sage (one pinch per piece on top of the skin)

The chicken was very moist which I loved....however the taste was not as seasoned as I would have liked.

It was very simple and delicious, my girls loved it, I used baby onions instead and it made the dish prettier. I served it with spanish rice and salad, it was a hit!

This was all right... definitely quick and easy, especially if you purchase chicken that has already been quartered (or know what you're doing). However, the flavor profile just wasn't very compelling. It was tasty and would do for a standard dinner but wasn't anything spectacular. I substituted carrots for the zucchini, and that worked out fine.

This is my dear friend's favorite recipe of all time. Just a couuple of notes, make sure that the onions and potatoes are in the broth and the zucchini are a little above otherwise, you'll end up with drenched zucchini and it's not very nice. I add a few cloves of garlic just for an added yumminess and skip the last part about broiling because my pan won't fit under my broiler but also because it's usually a gorgeous brown when it comes out of the oven.

Not the most exciting, but yummy and comforting. Not to mention super easy. I am sure I'll make it again.

This recipe was horrible and a waste of time and money. It did not cook right and my chicken and veggies were not done. Don't waste your time. Very displeased.

This is a great weeknight meal with leftovers for lunch. I generally use whatever veggies and spices I have on hand. So far zucchini, onion and and rosemary has tasted the best.

Tasty and easy. Added more lemon and italian spices like other reviews said and it worked out well. I'll make it again.

This was super easy to make, almost no prep time. Chicken was moist and tasty. I used Herbs de Provence and put them under the skin with the salt and pepper. I also added parsnips and baby carrots - the baby carrots DID NOT cook through. Would not recommend using them.

I thought this was a nice easy dinner to prepare for the week. I salted the chicken and then added olive oil herbs de provence and garlic. Sliced some idaho potato's into spears and tossed lightly with olive oil and salt. Added to the pan a quartered onion and three carrots thickly sliced. topped the chicken with one juice of a lemon and roasted then broiled the chicken to further crsip everything. The potato's, carrots and onions were nicely carmalized and the chicken moist and delicious. I took the pan juices added some cornstartch, chicken broth and vermouth and made a quick gravy to compliment the meal. very easy quick and only used one pan which is nice during the week!

3.5 forks really. . . but i admit that i changed a few things. . . i put cubed yukon gold potatoes and wedges of fennel under 2 whole chicken legs and seasoned it all with olive oil, dried rosemary, thyme and fennel seed and s&p. came out great! very easy and quick with minimal clean up. . . a winner in my book!

I really loved this delicious recipe as did my family and dinner guests. I'm surprised about some of the other reviews saying this is boring, everyone I served it to loved it. I took the advice of some previous reviewers and only added the zucchini before the broiling step, and I also added some chopped garlic and baby carrots to the recipe. It was delicious!

With a little tweaking, this was a great easy weeknight meal. I'm a garlic fiend so I marinated the chicken in garlic, EVOO, salt and pepper. I also added some wine to the broth/lemon juice and put the zuccini in just before broiling the dish (as recommended by others). It came out wonderfully, flavorful and so easy!

This recipe was okay--not spectacular. The chicken was moist, as were the vegetables. A bit oily, though. The vegetables were not at all crispy, which is what I prefer in a roasted chicken dish. A very plain, uneventful, but acceptable dish.

I thought the zucchini worked well in this dish - but not so if you cook it as long as everything else! We added the zucchini just before the broiling step. We also added a bit of white wine. I agree that the lemon helps to brighten up the dish. I think I'll use quite a bit more than the recipe calls for the next time!

Rating: 4
The little bit of lemon really brightens the flavors in this dish. I have made it many times and have found carrots, parsnips and pearl onions are a winning combination. To prevent darkening or burning of the bottom of the pan make sure every inch is covered with veggies or chicken; over-cover so when the veggies shrink with cooking every inch is still covered

This is without a doubt the best roast chicken I've had. I have made this dish so many times, and every time I make it I am told how wonderful a cook I am...I kid you not, something this easy that wins you this much praise?! Who would have thought! I add baby carrots and eggplant to the roast veggies.

I'm not sure why this hearty recipe did not get higher ratings. It is delicious! The vegetables come out tender, yet a little crispy on the outside, and the chicken is consistently moist and flavorful. We use different varieties of potatoes and onion, which makes it a little different each time. Delicious!

Great basic recipe but there are two things I don't understand. I toss the chicken and veggies together in the baking pan. Since they're both getting the same flavourings I don't see the need for separate tossing or dirtying an extra bowl for nothing. Also, I agree re: zucchini. Bad choice, IMHO. Use small pieces of carrot or parsnip with the potatoes. Adding the bit of broth is a very good addition to get the veggies going and keep them tender. Yes, it's a basic recipe but it is all about method, most cooking, and this is a nice recipe to adapt for one or two people. I added a bit of finely chopped garlic, olive oil and parsely under the skin before cooking. Also, I don't see the need for moving the chicken around before broiling. If the broiler is in the top of your oven, then just leave the chicken where it is under the broiler. Any closer and you risk burning.

Just had to add: made this with sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts today, and got rave reviews! Winter comfort food at its best.

This recipe is a new favorite at our house. I made it as directed once, and since then have used the technique with different cuts of chicken, different veggies and different seasonings, all with great results. The zucchini is really not the best choice - root veggies are more suitable in my opinion. But it's a wonderful template to modify again and again!

A simple and delicious chicken recipe. I doubted that the chicken could be done in 36 minutes and left it to bake 10 extra minutes. I shouldn't have. The recipe is perfect. I added fresh rosemary & thyme to the oil mixture which was tasty and fragrant. If you can do the single layer, you should. You will have nicely browned chicken and potatoes. The zucchini was mushy and bitter but I think that was the extra time in the oven. This is good!!

Nothing so easy should be allowed to taste so gourmet delicious!!! My husband said, "I don't even like chicken but want you to make this again." Feel free to add more veggies, and use chicken breasts/legs instead of quarted chicken. Mouth watering good exactly as it is though!

Rating: 3
Delicious! I used breasts and legs, thereby forgoing the need to quarter the whole bird, and I packed my roasting pan. I'm sure I used more veggies than called for, and everything was crowded and on top of eachother, but it all came out great. I improvised with seasonings (dill, garlic powder, white pepper) and it was delish! The chicken was SO tender, and all my guests LOVED it. Simple comfort food!

Lovely. So delicious and simple -- and the smell was wonderful as it cooked. Added a bit of rosemary, otherwise stayed true to the recipe. Will absolutely make it again.

This was a perfect one-dish dinner for a girls' night in. My friend the chef loved it. We would recommend turning the broiler setting on low, if possible, and next time I would add some sliced red bell peppers and eggplant and, like other cooks, some herbs.

Rating: 4
An excellent fall recipe. I made this for my fiance and myself; the recipe halves well using a 9x13 pan. Reading other reviews, I added a bit of rosemary--highly recommended! If you have a gas oven (with the broiler on the bottom such that the food is fixed distance from the flame) reduce the broiling time in the last step to about 2 minutes.

Very tasty and very moist. Simple and good. A great weekknight dinner.

Chef Walleye clearly has no imagination. I bet he/she has the same 5 or 6 dishes every week. Oh, It's Tuesday. We're having meatloaf! Can you imagine limiting yourself to only one recipe/preparation method per food item?!? I can't.

Chefwalleye did you even try this recipe, or just base your remarks on reading it? In reading this recipe it is not one that I would normally try, however my husband came accross this recipe and asked me to make it. The first time I made it I made it exactly as directed and it was amazing. Chicken was juicy and the vegetables were extremely delicious. At the request of my family (17 year old boy and 16 year old girl) I have made it again twice. I have added lots of garlic and some herbs. I have even done it with turkey parts couple of thighs couple of drums and a couple of breasts. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!

Quick, easy and tasty! My chicken came out moist and flavorful. As someone else mentioned adding their own flavorings, I would point out this recipe is a good base, easily adaptable to other flavors you might wish to add. I would caution against simply leaving the chicken and vegetables under the broiler for the full six minutes -- too much risk of burning the food. I checked mine after three minutes.

A wonderful dish. My chicken has never been so moist and flavorful. A definite keeper!

Booooring! Why roast chicken cut up, without any garlic or herbs? Why cook zucchini that long? Take a whole chicken, stuff a pierced lemon, a halved head of garlic, and a little thyme in the seasoned cavity and roast it til it's done. Put the vegetables in the pan the last 25 minutes. Roast Chicken is sacred, don't screw it up like this!

This recipe was very easy to make. I modified it by adding extra spices to the chicken and potatoes before cooking. The squash at the supermarket didn't look hot, so I bought frozen pearl onions instead. I cooked the chicken for 30 minutes at 500 and did not need to put it under the broiler.... maybe b/c I put a pat of butter on top of each peice of chicken. In all, this recipe is so easy and is great, healthy, comfort food. You can't go wrong.

Quick and easy, but nothing special. Cooked it less than the recipe called for, and zucchini still came out way too soft.

I made this recipe when I saw it in Gourmet's 10/05 issue. It's quick, easy & delicious. The second time I made it I added garlic cloves, carrots, and herbs de Provence.
