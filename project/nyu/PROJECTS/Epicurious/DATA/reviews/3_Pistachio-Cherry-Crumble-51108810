fabulous recipe. made this on a camping trip in a dutch oven and it came out fabulously. it disappeared in no time flat. cardamom puts the topping over the top. will definitely be making this one again.

I originally made this with the last of some Bing cherries that were on their way out (so only about 2 cups), 1 1/2 very ripe peaches (to make up for the rest of the fruit), and instead of dividing the tablespoons, used extra tablespoons of the brown sugar and flour for the topping. It turned out really well, but the second time around I also used a little more oats, kosher salt plus some cinnamon which everyone agreed made it even better, with plums and blueberries in there as well. I think the peaches really made this dessert a lot better and juicier.

This was AWESOME. I bought frozen cherries (Who has time to pit 2 lbs of cherries?) The bag had 3 different kinds so it made for a unique blend. Cardamon is what made this dish. We like lots of crumble in cobbler so next time we will double the amount of crumble and put a layer on the bottom, then cherries then another layer of crumble. My dinner guests didn't leave any for me to take for lunch the next day :(

I made this with Bing cherries. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. The topping is fantastic! I agree with A Cook from Indiana -- I'll use again in other recipes. The cherry taste and texture were not quite raw, not quite cooked. All the cherries were "rubbery". There was virtually no liquid, when compared to the image next to the recipe. I plan to make this again with the following changes: 1. Precook the cherries either on the stove top or covered with foil in the pie pan in the oven. 2. Add water or some fruit juice if needed. 3. Top and cook per recipe.

I used Bing cherries and made no changes. The topping is fantastic! The cherries were a bit rubbery - taste and texture where somewhere between raw and cooked. I'll try this again and will make this change: pre-cook the cherries either on the stove top or in the pie pan with a foil cover and without the topping, then top in the pie pan and bake 25 minutes.

I made this with sweet Bing cherries, too. Very good & easy. This will become a favorite topping for any kind of fruit crumble - peaches, plums, apples. The touch of cardamon is great!

It sure looks like it is made with sweet cherries not sour or pie cherries. Pie cherries are smaller and lighter in color. I make pies with sour cherries a lot and the color never looks that dark red.

Muskoka? Fantastic. Thanks for the reply.

I made this today using sweet cherries, which I halved due to their size. The only change I made was to use pecans instead of the walnuts, since I had those on hand. Oh so good!

I second kahshe's question: Is this made with sweet or sour cherries? Can someone who's made the recipe weigh in? Thanks.

Not a review but a question. Are you using sweet or sour cherries? It doesn't seem like much sugar for sour cherries. Thanks.

We loved this recipe. Light and flavorful. The pistachios added a nice touch, although I used salted nuts.
