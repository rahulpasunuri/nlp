Terrible! I love my mother, but if you've ever had spaghetti sauce made by a woman who learned to cook in 1950s midwestern home ec class, you'll know what I mean when I say this was bland and watery and reminded me of spaghetti night with the big green shaker in the middle of the table and white bread and butter on the side. It's good for sentimental reasons, but otherwise unappetizing.

While this recipe doesn't produce anything that tastes like paella to me, it's still really good. I made it on a weeknight with stuff I already had on hand so had to make some substitutions: clams from a can, spinach instead of zucchini, cherry tomatoes instead of roma, had to leave out the parsley, mild chicken sausage (Candella's) instead of spicy. The taste was great! I also threw in some chopped olives and lemon juice. The broth was really yummy. And I liked that there was a lot of chunky tastes in the pasta. Unlike other reviewers, I like the fact that there was some extra broth to sop up with some bread. Versatile recipe. For guests, I would just make sure to use fresh clams and parsley.

I've made this dish many times. Look for a thin pasta that cooks in 8 minutes. I usually add a few peeled shrimp in the last 3 minutes.

After much work - I cannot get my family to eat the leftovers. Part of the blame is due to the saussage I used being too smokey. However, the broth I ended up with was very runny and my family did not like the flavor. Have some tomato paste on hand to thicken it up if needed - or add the wine in parts.

This is an amazingly easy take on what can be a labor intensive dish. I added some tomatoes a dash of orange juice and a slice of orange peel and it was fabulous. Fast, easy. Good as is or add seafood sausage - whatever. A great weeknight or quick dinner party dish.

Wow, what a sleeper! Threw it together in no time, and the teenager stuck his head out of his room to announce "gee, it smells great in here!" I was a bit concerned that the spaghetti would not cook, but breaking it into 2-inch pieces and the occasional stir guaranteed just the right degree of al dente-ness. I would NOT add more liquid -- it's just right the way it is. Makes a very healthy serving size! I'd say serves 2 growing boys or 4 normal people.

Very tasty. I had to substitute mussels for the clams which changed the cooking time a little bit but maintained the flavor!

Great recipe! Very tasty and easy to make. Everything turned out absolutely perfect except the spaghetti, which needed more time and liquid to fully cook. I'm going to make the recipe again tomorrow night for company, but will use saffron arborio rice instead.

I found that this recipe was easy and inexpensive to make. Items were not hard to find in our area. Good flavour. Served with a nice Red Wine to top off flavour.
