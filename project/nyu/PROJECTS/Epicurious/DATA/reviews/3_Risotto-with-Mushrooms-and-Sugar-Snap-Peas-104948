I added the liquid one cup at a time and stirred until it was incorporated, mainly because that's how I was taught to make risotto. And it IS risotto - I disagree with reviews saying it isn't. We're on a no-dairy diet so I left out the cheese and it was still creamy and delicious. I used a mixture of mint and basil instead of just mint.

I really liked the creamy flavor of the rice despite the fact that the recipe calls for very little fat. To enhance the dish, I would add more mushrooms and peas and replace the mint with basil.

Traditional Risotto is made by SLOWLY adding liquid (one ladle at a time), stirring until it is absorbed, and repeating the process until all liquid is gone (it is best if the remaining liquid is boiling slowly in a separate saucepan)... Arborio rice is not the best option for risotto out there (although in America this seems to be the best available). I came from Italy two days ago with a suitcase full of risotto rice (not Arborio variety), having spoken with many chefs and scoured many a grocery store in Rome and Florence. For the record: risotto is the name of dish, "riso" is Italian for rice...

This dish is certainly easy to make, but my guests universally found the mint weird in a risotto, which they expected to be creamy and rich. The mint makes the dish fresh and zesty, so someone recommended making this with couscous, which is lighter and in keeping with the mint. With couscous, this dish should even be faster (note: will probably require significantly less broth.)

Risotto is the Italian term for this kind of dish. Riso is the Italian word for rice, and Arborio is the kind of rice most commonly used for Risotto.

To previous reviewers: it doesn't matter (except to traditionalists) how much liquid you add at one time - as long as you are using aborio rice and stir constantly until absorbed. I do agree, however, that adding the liquid and cooking for 20 minutes, doesn't give you the same starchy-ness necessary for a great risotto. BTW, I wonder if anyone can answer a question for me? In Italian, is Risotto the Italian name for rice or is Risotto the name of the dish (meaning the cooking technique, type of rice used, etc)?

This is a great rice dish, but not risotto. How about calling it soupy rice with mushrooms etc...?

This is not risotto. Epicurious has a responsibility to teach proper approaches to food. This recipe only fosters miconceptions and misunderstandings. This may be a good rice dish, but it has noting to do with risotto.

This is NOT risotto. It's rice. BIG DIFFERENCE!

I've been terrified about making risotto, but this recipe was easy and turned out delicious! It easily made 3 servings, and the leftovers warmed up well in the microwave. I'm going to try it again and vary the vegetables

I'm an awful cook -- but I made this and it was ok!! We used a lot of pepper on it, so next time I'm gonna try adding a half of a spicy sausage or something!

This was an easy risotto to make. I doubled it for 4 people and that made a lot of rice - maybe 1.5 cups of rice worth would be good for 4. I liked the mint, and served it with lamb.

I quadrupled this recipe to feed 12 people, and it fed them all with a lot left over! I will definitely make this again (after we finish all the leftovers, of course).

Very nice, easy, risotto. The sugar snap peas are wonderful in the creamy rice, and the dish is a nice one-dish sidedish to something like a simple, great grilled steak. I would definitely make it again. Personally I leave out the mint, which is not my favorite flavor, and add garlic along with the mushrooms and peas.

I've made this twice now. The second time I doubled it for four. It needs a large pan for that and I don't think I would do it again. But for two people, it's perfect. The mint and cheese are subtle but really work well.

Easy, rich, delicious. I thought good risotto would be much more labor intensive, but this was a snap. I substituted asparagus for the peas, which worked beautifully.

This recipe was easy to follow with excellent results. I added 1 TBSP minced garlic, sauteing it in olive oil before adding the rice. Will definitely make again.
