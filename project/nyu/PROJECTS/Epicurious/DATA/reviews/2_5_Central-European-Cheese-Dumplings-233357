One of my rare epicurious failures - these were terrible. The dough TASTED great, and it was sticky-dry and formable, but the dumplings came out much too spongy and soft. A shame to waste them, I'll probably bake them into a frittata/quiche sort of thing.

I tried the cornmeal variation and it didn't seem to work out all that well. They fell apart and became mushy instead of firming up. I may try the standard recipe next time.

I found these very interesting on a personal level -- my grandmother (who grew up in Poland) taught my mother how to make something similar to this, which she called "lazy pierogi." (Kluski was the name of another dumpling she made with mashed potatoes.) I always knew that the lazy pierogis as we made them were an Americanized version (we used 1 egg + 1 C flour + 1 C cottage cheese) and that the original recipe used farmer's cheese (very hard to come by where we grew up), but I'd never been able to find a recipe for something similar until now. This recipe is much lighter and spongier than my grandmother's, and very tangy. These also stand well on their own, whereas I wouldn't dream of serving lazy pierogis without frying them in several pounds of sliced, very well-carmelized onions. I served this recipe with carmelized onions and although they were good, my whole family agreed they liked my grandmother's recipe much better. Next time I'll combine the two recipes (use half farmer's cheese/half cottage cheese and half flour/half farina) and see what happens. These were a bit too tangy, and we prefer a bit heavier texture, these were too spongy for us. I'd love to see another review soon!!
