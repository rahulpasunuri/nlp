Perhaps instead of talking about "educated palates," you should educate yourself enough to learn how to spell recipes.

I dont know where you find the chefs that write these recipies, may be they just dont want to share their origional recipies with us, i know i have no problem sharing recipies with my mates who are also chefs & if they want i will bring them into my kitchen & show them how to make them, but excuse my french, this is a shit chutney maybe their palet isnt aducated enough, i made alot of changes to this, added a little mace for spice, substituted cider for vinegar & a few little bits & pieces and it was fantastic, i dont mean to upset the chef but it would be a bit of an idea to taste your food before submitting your recipies first
