This needs salt and pepper, which I think helps the flavors come together. I added a little of each to the marinade. The next time I made it, I patted off the marinade then put salt and pepper on the roast before I cooked it.

This was fantastic. I'm usually very skeptical of recipes on this website that have as many negative or so-so reviews as this one does, but I'm SO glad I gave this one a shot. This recipe will definitely be going into regular rotation for me. My grocery had run out of pork tenderloin, so I had to use chicken breasts. It was still delicious, but I know it would be even better with pork. I followed the marinade recipe exactly. I pricked the chicken breasts several times all over with a fork and marinated for about 5 hours. I placed them on a foil-lined baking sheet, sprinkled with a few extra rosemary sprigs + fresh ground pepper, and roasted at 450 degrees for about 18 mins. They came out perfectly!

I halved the marinade recipe because I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. Next time I will make the full recipe and save half for another night. The flavors were excellent and would go well with poultry too! I might even try grilling the meat next time.

Use the extra marinade as a sauce. Otherwise, this is surprisingly bland, even after marinating overnight.

This recipe was just okay. I would make this again, however, next time I will take the reserve marinade and adjust somewhat to use as a dipping sauce. My husband and I love rosemary and the marinade flavouring throughout was subtle at best.

This is the best marinade for either pork or lamb.

This was easy to make and was pretty good, but I don't think I'd make it again. There wasn't anything wrong with it, but it just wasn't great...

This is without question the best marinade I've encountered for pork roast. Everyone requests the recipe from me once I've prepared it. Definitely marinate overnight if at all possible!

Rating: 1
This was a huge letdown for me. The reviews seemed positive for the most part. It was way too syrupy sweet in the glaze,marinade... just too many things going on. I couldn't taste the pork, just other stuff! I love rosemary but it ruined this dish for me. Just another lesson that more is not always better.

this was a really good dish, i did not use the mustard but it still turned out very good.

Rating: 1
I will admit that I asked my babysitter to mix the marinade up and marinate the meat, so I cannot be 100% sure that everything was done properly; however, as it turned out, the marinade was very sour, tasted a lot like salad dressing. I think it needed a bit less vinegar and mustard, more herbs/garlic.

I'm not going to rate this recipe because I didn't make it exactly as written. I made the Pork Tenderloin Churrasco marinade and was afraid it would be too spicy for my guests. I then decided to marinate half of the meat using this recipe. I did however omit the honey. The marinade was delicious. I prepared the meat as directed in the Churrasco recipe slicing each tenderloin into 4 pieces lenthwise, then marinated 6 hours and grilled over medium-high heat for 2 minutes on each side. The pork using this marinade was the clear cut winner in our unofficial tatste test. I will make this recipe again.

This was without a doubt one of the best pork recipes we've ever eaten. Picky eaters; BIG success! Will make again. I used all balsamic vinegar and marinated 3 hours; still perfect. Used a 2 pound roast too, just for 3 of us and we were fighting over it! We generally eat teriyaki marinade on our pork but this was a nice change and every bit as DE-licious!

I only had time to marinate for an hour (at room temp), but came out delicious. Seared them first, then roast for 20 minutes. I was about to just mince the garlic and rosemary and mix it into the rest of the marinade but at the last minute went ahead and blended it. Very glad I did as I think the emulsification was essential. (I know it says to process, but not everyone follows every rule!)Will make 8 of them for a dinner party this weekend, good warm or room temperature.

I made six of these tenderloins for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it. I increased the amount of garlic, which was good, but I should have also increased the rosemary. I marinated the tenderloins for two days in heavy plastic zip lock bags, then cooked all six sitting on a metal grate in a large roasting pan. They still cooked in 1/2 hour, and were very juicy.

Rating: 3
I decided to make this dish the morning of my dinner party and it literally "made" my dinner party. I was only able to marinate the pork for 4 hours, and yet the flavor was amazing. The balsalmic glaze left a slighty sweet-crispy coating on the outside while bits of garlic and rosemary could be tasted with each bite. I served it with toasted pinenut cous cous, fresh spring salad and fruity merlot. Succulent!

Rating: 3
I thought this was very good, although if you are not a fan of honey-mustard flavor you may want to stick with a basic garlic-rosemary mixture. It is important to not leave too much of the marinade in the roasting pan because the honey in the mixture will burn.

Rating: 3
We marinated two smallish tenderloins. We did not alter the proportions of the marinade. After just 1 1/2 hours, we grilled the smaller tenderloin on the outside gas barbecue: medium/high heat about 15 minutes. We took the meat off the heat before it was completely done because it keeps cooking. Grilling kept in the juices. The pork was DELICIOUS! A real keeper! We will grill the other tenderloin tomorrow, which after 24 hours in the marinade, should be even better. Served today with pineapple salsa: canned chunk pineapple, green onion, chopped fresh Italian parsley, two or three teaspoons of cider vinegar, Tablespoon or so of brown sugar, dash of cayenne pepper. Make salsa just before you serve it.

Rating: 3
I like the simplicity of this recipe and it was okay. However I cut back on the honey and still found it too sweet. It also didn't seem to make the Tenderloin as tender as some other marinades I have used. It was okay.

Rating: 4
I made this for 2002 Xmas dinner.Everyone raved about it & wanted the recipe! I used convection roast & took it out about 30 minutes sooner,it was nice & moist not dry. Served it with a corn pudding & roasted asparagus.

Rating: 4
The simplicity of the preparation and flavor of this recipe make it a perfect answer for serving groups of 6 or more because the recipe increases quite easily. Just keep an close eye on the temperature of the meat to know when it is done, not the timer! I would however, recommend, browning the roast in a pan on the stove prior to putting them in the oven. Getting the outside to a golden brown in spots helps to seal in some of the juices and keep the roast moist, something that is not always so easy with pork!

This is a wonderful recipe. I like to roast with baby turnips and saute the greens serve with gruyere potatoes and it is an incredible meal.

Rating: 2
The marinade was delicious. I heated and served it on the side. The tenderloin was a little dry, even though I only cooked it to 150 degrees. I have definitely prepared a better tasting pork tenderloin, so I'll not make this particular recipe again.

Rating: 3
I thought this dish was wonderful. Now I did make a significant change - after I browned the meat, I added the marinade back and baked the whole thing (I cut my meat in about four large pieces) covered in a 350 oven for about 45 min. I can't imagine discarding such a flavorful marinade! We spooned it on plain rice for an interesting side dish.

Rating: 3
We liked this a lot - easy to make, do the night before and let marinate 24 hours. Does anyone else feel the direction to cook to 150 degrees is a tad long - 140 should be lovely medium (touch of pink) doneness.

Rating: 3
Both my husband and the kids enjoyed this (my kids even complain about the meatballs in spaghetti and meatballs)I seared the pork as suggested by other reviewers, and for the adult piece I poured some of the extra marinade on the tenderloin a couple of times as it cooked. After it was done cooking (20 -25 minutes for a tenderloin worked beautifully!) I put the roasting pan on the stove with all of the marinade and cooked it a bit like a gravy which my husband enjoyed. Served with couscous and green beans ... definately easy and definately a keeper!

Rating: 2
A good, solid midweek family dinner, but I found that despite having a rosy color and exactly 150 degree internal temp, the meat was not as moist as when I have grilled pork tenderloin. I felt it needed a little sauce, but the extra marinade is too much like salad dressing. Why the double batch of marinade, anyway? I did use a food processor as recommended, but don't think it is necessary, a mortar and pestle works well to break up rosemary and makes a fine garlic paste; wire whisk can blend all. I prefer my garlic-ginger-soy-orange marinade for pork tenderloin (found in Williams-Sonoma "Weekends with Friends" cookbook.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent dish with a few minor modifications. I marinated the pork overnight as recommended and I did sear the tenderloin before roasting as recommended by several reviewers. This made all the difference as the wonderful flavor of the marinade came shining through. My guests loved this dish. I did not feel that the garlic was overpowering as others have remarked, however I suppose this depends on ones preference. I did have to cook this for about 45-50 minutes as well.

Rating: 2
3 cloves of garlic was overpowering. Served this to 11 dinner guests and was just so-so received. My oven may be off, but took 50 minutes to reach 150 degrees. I cooked two tenderloins at once. Don't think I'll make this again. Have better recipes.

This recipe was absolutely tops. Marinating it overnight gave it fantastic flavor and the cooking time was right on. I basted it with beef broth while roasting then made red wine sauce from the juices and served with baby carrots and twice-baked potatoes. It was a big hit with both me and my boyfriend, who were the ones eating it.

Rating: 4
Really delicious! My husband is not a big pork fan, but he practically licked the plate with this one. Like some of the other reviewers, I only marinated it for 3 hours and it was still outstanding. I took a tip from another reviewer and also seared the tenderloin in butter and olive oil before roasting; I would definitely do this again. I don't like to make substitutions in recipes the first time I tried them, but I have to confess I was out of dijon mustard when we tried this and we used plain old yellow mustard. It was still wonderful! Next time I'll use whatever mustard I have on hand. This one's a winner!

Wonderful recipe. To the cook below who said it took her an hour to cook - yes a pork LOIN will take that long but a pork TENDERloin (which this recipe calls for) should only take about 25 minutes!

Delicious! Pork roast can be so humdrum, but this recipe gave it a good flavor and a moistness. I used a 3.3 lb. boneless roast, and browned it in olive oil and butter prior to roasting. Added peeled quartered onions to the pan under the roast to add flavor. Marinade was delicious, and I would definitely make this for a party--easy to prepare, cook and serve.

This a truly great recipe! I will marinate it overnight next time, but even so the flavor was really delicious. This is a perfect dish for a dinner party! My only comment was to be sure to allow more cooking time as it took close to an hour. I left out the cider vinegar and added lots of fresh black pepper. A winner!

I used the cider vinegar, but didn't have red wine vinegar handy and substituted with cabernet and white vinegar. I marinated it for almost a full 24 hours.It was awesome! I also seared the pork in a hot pan with some olive oil before putting it in the oven. I served it with french bread and home grown herbs blended with olive oil.I would definitely do this one again. My guests raved!

Thought I'd try this receipe since it got such a high rating. I was very disappointed with the marinade and taste of the pork. I marinated the pork overnight and grilled it. I guess I didn't like the kinda sweet taste. I think it was from the cider vinegar. I would use red wine vinegar if I made it again.

I made note of previous cooks remark that the pork lost flavor in the oven. I browned pork as suggested and used fresh rosemary to brush extra marinade on the meat and left sprig on meat while baking - it was excellent!

I have made this recipe 3 times. Once in the oven and twice on the grill. Grilling gives it much more flavor. The longer you can marinade, the better. As to amount of cooking time, I always use a meat thermometer, but the grill cooks it faster than my oven. 25 to 40 mins depending on the size of the tenderloin. This is a great recipe! I am going to try it with chicken next.

Rating: 2
The marinade/sauce was delicious, but I too thought the meat lost flavor in the oven. I'll try it one more time on the grill to see if that helps, otherwise I wouldn't bother making it again.

This marinade sounded so good, but I thought the meat was a little tasteless. Most of the flavor was lost during the roasting process, because it seemed that most of the marinade burned off in the oven. Maybe next time I'll baste with the extra marinade and that should help keep the flavor intact.

I marinated the pork tenderloin for 48 hours and recommend this for fullest flavor -- it was moist, tender and delicious; however, it took 40 minutes instead of 25 to reach 150 degrees. Great with stir-fry vegetables. My husband pronounced this a "real keeper."

How can all the flavor contained in the marinade disappear to such an extent? I was really disappointed with the results of this recipe. Also, the pork was so severly undercooked I had to stick it back into the oven for much longer than the recipe indicated.

I made this dish for a good friend's biththday. Wonderful...I did change the following. I used a stick blender to make the marinade. This makes it very rich and thick. The emulision will not break with time in the frig. I also seared the tenderloin prior to placing it in the oven

Wow - that's what comes to my mine first! I only marinated the pork for about an hour or so, and that was plenty for the flavor to come through. I browned the pork a bit to give it even more flavor, and I also made a pan gravy to have with it. Also had mashed potatoes and some Zinfandel-glazed baby onions. Mmm...definitely a meal that will make repeat appearances at my table!
