I skipped chipotle and replaced cornmeal with regular weath flour, texture was fantastic, they're easy to make, delicious.

I thought these were very tasty. The batter was a bit wet so I just made drop biscuits instead of kneading the dough.

Second time around with this. First time biscuits were quite thin and disc-like. The medium coarse ground cornmeal was like eating sand. But they were still good. Second time around I froze the butter and grated it like another reviwer. This made the cutting-in process so much easier. The cornmeal was soaked in 1/2 cup buttermilk. Only 1/4 cup buttermilk was mixed in with the egg. Then the egg/bmilk, chipotles and scallions were mixed in with the cornmeal/bmilk mixture. ALL of this was mixed into the dry ingredients at the end. The dough was FAR LESS gooey and I used a 1/4cup measure to scoop out biscuits onto the baking sheet. They were puffy and at least 1.5in thick. Also, I dont use traditional supermarket sharp cheddar. I use a mix of specialty NY, Cabot, Tillamook, and other cheeses - whatever looks good!

These were very light and flavorful. I added 1 Tb. of chives as well. Yes the dough is very soft and sticky, but if you generously flour your board and work the dough very gently, it comes together just fine. I made these for a client to be served with barbecued beef and they were delicious!

Very yummy biscuits. I did not saute the green onions or use the egg wash, and I also subbed some white whole wheat flour which made a nice, tender crumb.

I'VE MADE THIS MANY TIMES AND ALWAYS LOVE THEM.IT DOES TAKE A "GENEROUS" AMOUNT OF FLOUR WHEN YOU BEGIN TO ROLL THE DOUGH AND I USE A GLASS TO FORM THE BISCUITS. PERFECT EACH TIME AND GREAT THE NEXT DAY IF ANY ARE LEFT OVER. LOVE IT WITH CHILI.

These biscuits had delicious flavor, but like many reviewers I found that the dough was very wet & sticky. I compared it to the buttermilk biscuit recipe in the Joy of Cooking, which calls for 3/4 liquid to 2 cups flour -- a 1/4 less liquid to the same amount of dry ingredients. I also think I made things worse by using a very course-ground cornmeal, which possibly absorbed even less of the liquid. This wasn't just a problem for handling the dough: the finished biscuits came out kind of flat & pancake-y instead of tall & biscuit-y. I will definitely make this again, but I'll reduce the total liquid to 3/4 cup.

These were perfect fluffy, moist, crunchy, salty/sweet and just wonderful, and all that despite me forgetting to add the onions and chipotle! Indeed the dough turns out very sticky, but as the recipe directs, I kneaded and patted it out on a generously floured surface and this helped to make the dough easier to handle. I left off the egg glaze too and didn't miss it. Still very very tasty leftovers Two days later. I hid them well, otherwise they'd be long gone!

Everyone raved about these, but I felt like they were more trouble than they were worth. I don't know what happened, but they were WAY too wet -- kneading was out of the question, never mind cutting and reforming the dough. I mixed as much flour in as I could, but it was still really wet. I did make a double batch, and I know my proportions were correct, but maybe that was the problem. One note -- if you do make a double batch, you will need to do two separate batches in the food processor (for a standard size Cuisinart).

These were probably some of the best biscuits I have ever made! I loved the texture that the cornmeal adds. As others have said, they are really sticky. I didn't want to add too much flour so I just 'dropped' some on the baking sheet and they also baked up just fine. I omitted the egg wash and didn't miss. Served with a black bean soup and salad.

This is a good biscuit recipe. I made them without the green onion and chipotle the first time since I was making them for kids. They were a hit. Dough was sticky, but when turned on a generously floured board, they were fine. I rolled them a little more then 3/4 inch thick and made them mini for appetizers. Will be serving them with Niman Ranch ham slices and sweet onion jam.

I've made these many times and they're wonderful. My favorite is with Widmer 6 year cheddar. I usually omit the adobo chilis - it wastes most of a can and I'm not crazy about spicy. Making this weekend again for a friend!

These are incredible, especially when warm. Be sure to served them just after baking, or warm them up before serving. Like other reviewers, mine also were pretty flat. I might try chilliing the dough next time, or even baking in muffin tins so they bake "up" instead of "out." Oh, one note. I was trying to use up a big block of pepper jack cheese so used that instead of cheddar and chipotles. I did add a can of chopped green chiles along with the onion mixture. This truly is a delicious recipe. Try them, you won't be disappointed.

Delicious. I made this for a large brunch party and they were so raved over and quickly devoured, I had to make another batch.

This was great and I would definitely do this one again. I agree with the other comments on adding quite a bit more flour when kneading the dough; otherwise it is just too sticky to handle properly. Also, we enjoyed these even more the next day as a breakfast biscuit of sorts filled with scrambled eggs and chives and slices of crisp bacon. Enjoy!

Scrumptious, moist and tender with great cheesy flavour and lovely golden tops from the egg wash. Like others, I did not saute the green onions first and used finely minced seeded red Thai chilies rather than chipotles which imparted just the right amount of zip and heat. Not having a food processor, I learned a great and quick/easy trick from a pro chef - use frozen butter and grate it on the large holes of a standard box grater. The pieces are just the right size and because the butter is frozen it makes the biscuits especially tender as it melts more slowly while baking. Yes, the batter is on the wet side, just flour generously as you knead and pat it out. This is a super recipe, please do give it a try!

Delicious and pretty. Do not pat too flat - they don't puff up very much.

Delicious and so easy to make! It was a big hit at home and in the office. If you can't find chipotles, use jalapenos, they taste good too.

I have made these 3x already. Absolutely delicious. The 3rd time I wanted minis and I used a scoop, did not roll them out, and put them in my silicone muffin pans. A big hit.

Yes, my dough was very wet and I could not use a biscuit cutter. Ended up patting them down into round shapes. Tasted awesome, just not pretty. Came out flat. I might increase flour to 2 cups next time.

These biscuits were very flavorful and came out just as attractive as the cover photo. Followed the recipe exactly except I did not use a food processor. Chilled the formed buiscuits slightly in the fridge before baking them so they won't melt and spread in the oven. The batter was wet but I understood that's how good biscuit and scone batter are. Finished product froze well, too. Though they went so fast I really didn't have to keep them in the freezer to begin with.

These biscuits are awesome and every bit as pretty as the picture! I didn't use the chipotle peppers as my husband doesn't care for them, but I used all other items and I added fresh ground pepper. Also, I didn't precook the green onions. Just added them at the proper time. The dough was sticky, but I used enough flour when handling and it worked out fine. I make biscuits a lot & these are my new favorite!

I used Grafton cheddar with marvelous results! Go out and buy chipotles + cheddar, and make these biscuits. You won't be disappointed.

I loved these. I've made them twice, and the second time I left out the onions and chipotles. They were still delicious. The consistency was so nice--a lovely crunchy exterior and a moist tender inside. It did make a slightly wet dough but nothing out of the ordinary for biscuits. I found that if I just floured the board I came out fine on the patting out. I'm not sure why people had problems with the dough.

I used the food processor and it was so easy to blend everything, plus adding the cold butter that way is a great idea. The batter was too wet, however, and after turning it onto the counter to knead, I had to add a good bit of flour. That did not seem to make them dry, though.

I had the same problem someone else mentioned - the dough came out way too sticky and I had to add a lot of flour to get it to a usable consistency. Came out too dry. Not worth the trouble!

These biscuits were very tasty and surprisingly, did look like the photo. I did not use a food processor -- just a manual pastry blender. Maybe that helped to keep the dough from being overworked.

I thought that the biscuits were delicious but not worth the effort to make again. I'm not sure if I made a mistake but the dough was more like a thick batter and I had to add a LOT of flour to be able to knead it. Did anyone else have that problem?

This recipe is fabulous! It tasted great and looked just like the photo. This one goes into my permanent files.

The picture looked fab, so I had to try this recipe. I agree that these are good, but not great. Better than plain biscuits. It just overall lacked in flavor. I expected more punch. I will make again, but add maybe a tsp. of salt. And maybe in addition to the wilted green onions, and some fresh green onions. It's not the cheesy, oniony, complex biscuit you see in the picture. Also, my biscuits didn't look like the cover's, they came out flat also. Don't flatten like the recipe suggests...keep it thick as they will spread. Mine looked more like cookies. Maybe the batter should be chilled to prevent spreading?

I hate to lower the ratings on this recipe. It was good but not great. I will not make again but I am not a lover of baking and for those who like it go ahead and try them out.

When we saw the picture of these biscuits on the cover, I knew we'd have to try them. And, they did not disappoint! They are VERY flavorful! My only suggestion: I think I patted the dough out too thin, which made too many biscuits that were a little too flat; next time I'll leave the dough at least an inch thick and only make the suggested 10 biscuits.
