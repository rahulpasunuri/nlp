flavors are excellent but proportions are off. needed twice as much liquid as it calls for. PLUS, i took out the star anise per the directions, but the mixture did not have enough star anise flavor. so i added it back in (in a section of the thick sauce,next to, but not mixed in with, the kumquats)and let it sit in the mixture while it was cooling and for a few more hours. then i removed the star anise.by then , the flavor was there.

This is such an unusual recipe. When you read the ingredients and try to imagine it's taste it is diffcult to comphrend the enchanting exotic taste! After I discarded the star anise, I added 3 tab. of finely minced crystallized ginger. The sweet ginger balanced the slight tart of the kumquats....fantastic. My guests were amazed at the beauty of the sauce spooned over vanilla ice cream and served with a fortune cookies!
