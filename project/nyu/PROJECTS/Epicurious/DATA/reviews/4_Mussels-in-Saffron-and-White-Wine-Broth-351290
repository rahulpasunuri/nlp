I loved this dish, and I did follow some of the recommendations from other reviewers. I made a half batch of this and still used 5 cloves of garlic. Played with the liquid quantities so I had a 2 to 1 ratio of wine to clam juice rather than an equal amount of each. This came out really deliciously, but for me, as good as the saffron was in this dish, it calls for A LOT, and when a recipe calls for that much saffron, I want it to be a really special and integral part of the dish. I didn't wholly get that in this dish. Next time I'll try a new mussel recipe and save the expensive saffron for paella. Really glad I gave this recipe a try - it was almost a 4-forker.

Rather disappointing. I would say, "so so". :(

This is just not a four fork recipe. I'm really surprised by the reviews. If you'd never made mussels before, this would be a good starter recipe. But it's just fine, pretty one-dimensional in flavor (and that was with upping the garlic quite a bit). We eat mussels quite a bit because it's such an easy quick meal, so I try lots of different recipes from this site and others - won't be coming back to this one. If you want a good saffron broth based mussel recipe, look no further than Ina Garten's recipe in Barefoot in Paris. For a nontraditional one, there is a recipe on this site with Moroccan flavors and chickpeas that is really good.

Great recipe. Simple, delicious and easy to modify. I agree with the last comment re: using way more garlic. I halved the recipe and still used five cloves. I also made a few other tweaks.

This dish was very good. I have only made mussels once before, but am a fairly accomplished cook. Two things I would do differently: One, add WAY more garlic. maybe even an entire head.I love mussels and garlic and this dish was not garlicy enough for me. Two, add half as much of the clam sauce. I liked the flavor, but I prefer a more wine, saffron, garlic flavor. And there wnded up being SO much broth, it was nice to let the mussels marinate in the broth, but I felt the broth didn't have enough time to meld the flavors. But over all it was delicious. I used farm-raised mussels from Newfoundland and they were excellent. I would prefer fresh mussels when we are out on Long Island in the summer. But these mussels were fabulous!

I was wandering past the fishmonger by me and he had huge amounts of mussels so I decided to buy a kilo for dinner. I was cooking for 2 and it was more than enough. I forgot to halve the sauce though and had delicious dipping sauce for bread for 2 days after. This was soooo easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly as written. Definitely a go-to mussels recipe and I can't imagine bothering any other way. Two thumbs up.

This was great. I was only cooking for 3 people, so I halved the recipe for the broth and only used 2 pounds of mussels. I also added shallots and red bell pepper, and served it over whole wheat pasta. It was a hit!!

Fantastic! This is a very simple recipe, but elegant. I made it for lunch today and cannot wait to make it again tomorrow! I did saute red onion with the garlic, since I was out of scallions, and substitute fish stock for clam juice, but those are fairly minor changes. I agree with njhastings - a little salt might be good. I didn't add any, and while I loved the recipe salt-free, I think it would have made the flavors pop a little more.

This was great. I did change a bit. If you don't have saffron, add about 3 TBS pesto and some cayenne pepper. A bit more salt is also good. My husband loves it this way. njh

This has fast become my favorite recipe for steamed mussels. It comes together quick for a weeknight dinner, but is special enough to serve to guests. Highly, HIGHLY recommend recipe.

This is SO GOOD! I wish I could eat it every night. I did replace the clam juice with chicken stock, and the shallots with one small, thinly sliced onion, since it was what I had on hand, but I will never go looking for another recipe for mussels again. The flavours are mild enough to not overpower the delicate mussels, but each elements stands out very clearly in the delicious broth. Make sure to serve this dish with lots of bread for dunking, and maybe even a spoon! I drank up the broth like a soup!

Although I do like saffron in dishes like bouillabaise, this was incredibly overpowering. In fact, the huge amount of saffron ruined the dish for me. I would have loved it had I included only a big pinch of the threads. As written, I would not make this recipe again. How disappointing.

Forgot to mention that chicken stock or vegetable stock could substitute for the clam juice.

If you use flour you may end up with paste! I have used a tablespoon or two of corn meal with success. I also add salt to the water to simulate the salt water that they came from. The corn meal acts as enough of an irritant to make the mussels squirt the sand out of their shells. The recipe is superb. This is the first time I have used the saffron and cream and they added a lot of dimension to the flavors.

attn editors: there is a typo in the recipe: "Add the clam juice, scallions, tomato, and lemon juice, scallions, tomato, and lemon juice; simmer for 5 minutes." i have a few questions: -i've read in other recipes that if you scrub the mussel shells they can turn the broth an unappetizing blue-grey color - did anyone experience this? -i just moved to Istanbul where the mussels are not cultivated, and i've read that you can soak the mussels in water & flour so they release their sand - again any experience with this? -& they don't sell clam juice here, what else could i substitute? thanks!

I just made this recipe tonight for dinner-- wonderful!! It was fragrant, pretty, and extremely flavorful, not overpowering and a great broth to sop up with bread.

Absolutely wonderful. Made it exactly as it's written. But be prepared - it makes a huge amount! Have some good crusty bread on hand to soak up the delicious broth. This is now my go-to mussels recipe after trying several.

This was a great dish. Initially I was skeptical over the amount of saffron (seemed like a lot), but cooking seemed to tone it down nicely to a point where it was just right. The broth was delicious over the mussels and served with Belgian frites and several types of breads. I liked the blend of citrus and slight creaminess. Washed it all down with some Belgian beers. Tres magnifique!

Oops, regarding my earlier review, I must have copied the recipe down wrong and turned the dry white wine into sherry. Other comments still apply, but I'm upgrading the recipe to four forks because the original recipe would be better than the one I made.

At first I thought the combination of saffron and sherry might redundant, since sherry and saffron have a similar aromatic quality, but after I saw the stunning color of the orange mussel flesh glowing a brilliant saffron in the black shells against the tomato sauce, I changed my mind. This dish is quite visually stunning. I used about half of the saffron than the recipe called for, because I have a good Iranian saffron and I always powder mine and soaked it (in this case, in the sherry) for a couple of hours before I started cooking. I also added 1/4 tsp smoked Spanish paprika, which was awesome in this recipe, and I also used the Muir fire-roasted tomatoes. I think that next time, though, I will use regular tomatoes as the sauce seemed a little sweet with the roasted tomatoes and I also plan to add a pinch of hot red pepper flakes. This is a great recipe with wonderful ingredients that I loved in combination, but I can't really give it 4 forks because it needs some adjustments.

I rarely give 4 forks, but this is now the only recipe I'll use for mussels! I quartered the recipe since I was only cooking for 2. I made just a couple changes... -I added 1 small onion and omitted the scallion since I was out of scallion. - Added a litle extra saffron just beause we love the flavor. - I went just a little light on the lemon juice because I was concerned it would be too acidic with the tomato. I figured I could add more in if it needed it, but it didn't. I think it came out wonderfully this way. I'll be curious to hear from others that used the full amount of lemon and tomato. This is perfect as a light main course with quality french bread and salad of spring mix (esp with arugula!!) and other veggies.
