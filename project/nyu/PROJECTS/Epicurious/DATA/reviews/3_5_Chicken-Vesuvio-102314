Absolutely lovely. Didn't have peas but it didn't change the taste at all, just the colour. Used less pepper flakes as the kids could't take it and used bone-in thighs. It was a huge hit with the kids. They asked for more and cleaned their plates with bread. All the plates looked like they were just washed. Definitely one for keeps!

Love this dish. Swapped peas for black olives today - good trade for the parents, not so much for the kids. (Tough break, children!) Used boneless skinless today but I think I prefer bone-in thighs.

Delicious! I made this for my boyfriend yesterday with a few tweaks and he LOVED it. I used 2 bone-in chicken breasts, chopped the garlic cloves, deglazed the pan with some white wine and about a cup of chicken broth for 2 servings, since I made a lot of potatoes. The red pepper flakes gave it a great kick... not too spicy. It was soooo yummy!

I've made this many times because it's easy and yummy. However, with some small tweaks it goes from being three forks to four!! For sure, include some roughly chopped onions with the potatoes. Also, I sliced 2 cloves of garlic and inserted slices of 1 clove in small cuts in the chicken, then put the rest in with the potatoes/onions. I would also substitute large carrot chunks for some of the potato, or else something like sweet potato or turnip.

Good but not over the top--I'm not sure I would make it again. The chicken was very moist. I agree with the others that there were too many potatoes--you can cut those down. I also added onions when I cooked the potatoes and it added a nice flavor.

Being a transplanted Chicagoan, I was curious how this would be! And I've been making this for years! Always turns out great. Like everyone, I've tinkered with it a bit -- used boneless, skinless breasts, added more chicken broth, red pepper. One of my faves!

Rating: 3
This dish was easy and tasty. Like other reviewers, I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and doubled the chicken broth. I used Italian flavored chicken broth which added a little more flavor. In the future I will reduce the hot pepper flakes as the amount called for is a little "hot" for my taste.

Wonderful dish--adjusted pepper flakes and garlic to individual taste (less of each) Slow cooked potatoes till brown (no need for high heat--makes a mess of stove) Increased time I sauteed chicken and reduced oven heat to 375degrees to help retain more of the broth--peas add a nice touch!

the chicken was a little dry...

Rating: 3
I was a little concerned about the addition of the peas but found them to be delicious. I also browned the potatoes and chicken longer than the recipe called for but that could be because of the difference between commercial and home stoves. And I added a bit more broth than called for. Simple and delicious - comfort food at its best!

Rating: 4
Have to add a new review for this. I accidentally forgot to buy chicken broth at the store and substituted with a pinot noir I had been drinking...it was fabulous. I still added some onions (which turned brown and lovely) and carrots to the sauteeing and used bone in chicken breasts. If people are finding it bland that might help. We love it and diners actually fight over the potatoes.

The Chicken was very good, I did use boneless, skinless chicken breasts and did double the chicken broth and add a cup of white wine. We enjoyed the meal immensely.

Rating: 4
We thought this was great! I was trying to use up veggies from the fridge, so I also used 1/2 of a red pepper, a few chunks of white onion, and some mushrooms. I used 3 bone-in chicken breasts. I sauted the potatoes much longer than 5 minutes, maybe 12-15 min. Same with the chicken, a bit more like 15 min. rather than 10. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and deglazed the pan after the chicken with white wine. I also used more chicken stock (plus the wine), which probably made more of a "Sauce" for the chicken to bake in, and therefore not dry at all. A great, easy, make-ahead dinner!

Delicious as is. OK - not a parsley fan, so I left that out. Other than that, followed it to the letter. Might brown the potatoes more next time, but I was hungry -- I had to keep it moving! Will definitely make this again.

I thought it was very easy and fast to make. I wasn't sure about the combination of ingredients however they combined perfectly and tasted DELICIOUS! Modifications were: Use 2 skinless chicken legs with thighs and the rest of the ingredients I split in half. Great meal for during the week, easy clean-up too.

I have to say that I think this is GREAT. I heated the olive oil and sauteed the potatoes with a sliced red onion and baby carrots. The onions carmelized nicely and imparted their flavors to the carrots and potatoes. After baking, I deglazed the pan with a nice white wine and thickened the sauce with a bit of flour to drizzle over the chicken and veggies. Very easy and very good.

I am delighted I tried this wonderful chicken recipe. I have added it to my favorites. I think the potato preparation is very easy and not too time consuming. I don't think the dish is spicy hot, just well seasoned and flavorful. I would not decrease the amount of red pepper. I removed the skin from the chicken to reduce fat. The leftovers were tasty and made great sandwich meat and filling for stuffed chiles. I used the broth for soup. Economical and delicious!

In a word, yummy. Great comfort food, I've made it twice for guests and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe both times. Most of the work can be done ahead of time which is always delightful. I made no changes to the recipe as published.

Made this tonight to rave reviews from my husband (with which I totally agree). Only thing is that next time I'll add MORE peas and some pearl onions, mushrooms and maybe even a couple cherry tomatoes. I also like the suggestion of some white wine to add a little dryness to the taste--but even just as the recipe suggested it was great. My husband really RAVED!!!

Rating: 4
Yummy!!!!! I've made this several times now - it has become a staple in my house. The flavors blend so well and the chili gives it a nice kick. And nothing's better than having to only cook with one pot - makes the cleanup a little easier. I would definately recommend this dish.

Rating: 3
I love this dish. However, the potatos are a pain to do and take a long time to make really good. I've begun coating them in olive oil and baking them until crispy. Definitely add more garlic and red pepper. Also add white wine! Spread the garlic on bread with good olive oil handy!

Rating: 3
A very easy dish, and quite tasty. I love one pot cooking. I didn't realize just how hot red pepper flakes are - I would skip them next time because I don't care for spicy foods. I followed other reviewers advice and increased the broth and added wine, but there still wasn't enough sauce! At least double the amount of broth and add more peas too.

I doubled this recipe for a party of eight and though time consuming, (the potatoes take longer than written), the recipe was fairly easy to pull together and the results were tasty, (especially for a comfort food loving crowd like my extended family!) This is one of those recipes that you can make for a diverse crowd, however fussy, and they will all like it. I doubeld the broth and garlic, as recommended and think that the wine was a graet addition. I'll make it again when winter sets in!

I've never been to Chicago so can't compare this to the dish at Harry Caray's but I do know I'll definitely be making this one again! I used boneless, skinless thighs because that's what I had on hand. Also, I followed the suggestions of some and increased the broth to 3/4 cups and also added 1/4 cup of dry vermouth. There weren't any leftovers!

If you have ever found yourself in a family-run Italian restaurant, wanting a change from the pasta / pizza fare, this Italian staple will come to your rescue. As for this recipe, it's on the money. I would be a little more limiting with the red pepper next time (say half the stated amount), and I would recommend the addition of mushrooms. Oh, and if your boyfriend is anything like mine, make extra sauce (its always the same, right?). A Classic Italian dish, guaranteed to wow your dinner guests.

I've made this recipe many times and it's delicious (I do add a splash of wine and more garlic and red pepper). However, I've also recently discovered that these ingredients (minus the peas), when used on boneless skinless chicken breasts, are great in the crock-pot! One of the best smells and dinner that you can come home to after a long day at work!

This is an incredibly easy dish to make and tastes fantastic!! To add a bit more "umph" I added some spicy italian sausage which made a super addition (next time, though, i will cut back a little on the crushed red pepper because, even for a seasoned spice-lover as myself, the spicy sausage made it a tad too fiery :)) This got rave reviews from my boyfriend, as well, who cannot wait to make it for the guys at his firehouse! OH! and btw...I get the distinct impression that many of the reviews are actually referring to the other Chicken Vesuvio recipe found in this website from Gourmet magazine.

To be honest, I think I enjoyed the bantering between reviewers on this recipe more than the chicken itself. It was OK but it was a bit greasy and I got confused when everyone kept talking about adding wine (I kept referring to the recipe and couldn't find wine or vermouth in it). I probably would make it again but not for company (at least not posh company, family company maybe).

I am a crummy cook who loves good food. Reading Bon Appetit and cookbooks is a vicarious pleasure. I follow recipes to a "t" and if we're out of any ingredient, I can't cook it. My only chicken dish is bullseye barbque(not again!). I made this dish using 2 cups of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of white wine. I used about 4 potatoes. It was too juicy and I'd cut back on the broth or add a thickner.The sauce is made for a crusty bread. The taste was great and my husband the consummate cook thought it was delicious. He was really impressed that I innovated. Thanks to all the previous cooks for sharing their tips and inspiring me in the kitchen!

After just dining on this dish at Haray Carey's several days ago, I doubt seriously that this is the authentic house recipe. For example, the taste of dry white wine (perhaps even vermouth) was pleasantly pronounced, the oregano was fresh and there was little,if any, hint of red pepper.

Flavors were very good, but I wouldn't make this again as directed.I'd put everything except the peas in the clay cooker, skipping the browning process and also using skinless chicken.I'd put the peas in shortly before serving.It would be faster, easier & much more healthful, but with all the flavor & less cleanup.

Rating: 4
Follow the recipe but add more garlic and wine as suggested. I browned the potatoes and chicken in a hot skillet or on the grill and then put into a clay cooker. The flavor gets into the chicken and the cooker prevents drying out. Serve with roasted garlic and warm bread to complete the experience. A nice Pinot Noir enhances the flavor and cuts the garlic nicely.

I am with those who said it smelled yummy, but wasn't as good as it smelled. My chicken came out VERY VERY dry and there was no sauce at all....I'm uncertain what I did wrong.

This is a hearty, tasy dish which definately falls in the Comfort Food category. This is something my Grandma would have made and I will make it again--especially with more red pepper flakes. My husband thought it was awesome! I read the review from the Bethesda cook and it made me very sad. I suspect that this gourmand wouldn't be so mean spirited if he or she learned to enjoy the simpler things in life. Please don't subject other readers to your bitter ravings, Bethesda.

This is a simple, tasty & straighforward dish that one can put on the table easily after a day at work. We all need recipes like this. No, I wouldn't necessarily serve it to guests & it certainly isn't haute cuisine. That being said, I'm heartily sick of the kind of snide & superior comments from reviewers like the cook from Bethesda. If you bother to look at the Home Page, it describes Epicurious as a website 'For people who eat' (which I assume includes all of us) - not 'For gourmet cooks only'. There are plenty of publications & presumably websites which cater to the advanced cook. Please get down off your high horse & remember that you, too, were once a novice cook & that many people are only too happy to have easy access to a range of easy and interesting dishes. By the way, I did increase the red pepper flakes to 3/4 tsp & found it a little too spicy for out taste. I would go back to 1/2 tsp next time.

I hope I speak for a few others when I say that, while my Gourmet taste runs a little more complicated than this dish when cooking for guests or when I have a little extra time, throwing chicken and potatoes in a pot is what I resort to on an average day. And while I agree that it isn't very imaginative, it's certainly a good starting point for a budding cook who might be a little intimidated by other recipes. This is a simple, hearty dish that can be doctored a bit, and it's also a kid-pleaser, to be sure!

Please! I hope I speak for at least a few others when I say that this is not the type of recipe I subscribe to Gourmet and Bon Appetite for. If I wanted to know how to throw chiken and potatoes into a pot, I wouldn't even have to look in a 1955 Betty Crocker cookbook to figure out how. And I probably would have done it better myself to boot. What's for dessert? Green jell-o?

We loved this recipe. My husband couldn't stop raving and I loved how easy it was. He has had the vesuvio at Harry Caray's and he agreed it was the best! I added 1 cup of broth, 1/2 cup white wine, 10 cloves of garlic and doubled red pepper. I also added an extra potato. I agree with others to make sure to brown potatoes to crispy (it takes longer than 5 minutes). I also made french bread and smothered the soft garlic on the bread - yum!!

My family loves chicken and this was a great way to spice it up. Next time, I'll add a full teaspoon of crushed red pepper. The potatoes, garlic and peas were excellent too! Very easy to make, a one-pot meal. What more could you want? Also, you could add extra garlic to use as a spread on crusty french bread.

Fantastico! We all loved this easy to make dish, plus I got to use my favorite Le Creuset big pot on and in the stove! This came out so well, I can't believe how easy and delicious this was! No chopping, except the potatoes, which was no big deal. My picky 6-year old son even loved it! (My husband and I were in disbelief at the way he was eating it!) Next time, I'll take the advice of others and add more potatoes and also more broth for extra gravy. To those who complained about all the chicken fat, try trimming the chicken of fat before browning it, which is what I did a little, but I think it would still be much tastier using the bone-in chicken, and tender! Umm-ummm, this was great! We'll be eating this a lot this winter!

I have been looking for a simple, yet different chicken dish. Since my kids aren't a fan of red pepper, I only added a dash to the sauce. And since I am Pennsyvania Dutch, I had to make the sauce into a gravy. My "if-it-ain't-a-nugget, I'm-not-eatin it" kids loved it! Of course we had to make biscuits too.

My husband really loved the recipe and I thought it was well worth the effort. I found that the 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper was too hot for me, and I'd double the amount of liquids to make the sauce; it seemed to evaporate while baking. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead a whole chicken. The recipe was very easy to put together and very quick for those evenings when you need a hearty dinner and you don't have a lot of time to cook!

I like this dish for a number of reasons....first of all, it's a meal in a pan with the chicken, peas and potatoes. It has a spicy flavor, especially if you add extra pepper flakes, which I typically do. It cooks in one pan so the clean up is minimized and it's something different to do with chicken. Sometimes I substitute the russet potatoes for yukon gold which have more of a buttery flavor. I've made this dish several times already.

Rating: 4
Loved it, but admittedly strayed from the recipe a little. I used skinless chicken breasts that I cut a pocket into and stuffed with spinach sauteed in garlic and olive oil and a little bit of mozzerella/asiago/parmesan cheese mix to hold the stuffing together (got the stuffing recipe from "mozzarella, greens, and garlic bruschetta" on this site). I also skipped the peas and added more garlic cloves. The chicken was moist and tender - absolutely delicious. My husband ate every bite and asked when I would be making it again!

Absolutely great! Recommend taking the skin off the chicken; this is not the typical vesuvio; however, my fussy family likes this WAY better than the version made with wine. Add a few more cloves of garlic for the husband who loves to spread it on crusty french bread. Add more crushed red pepper....and a bit more broth to soak into the potatoes....don't skimp when browning the potatoes....the browner the better the flavor. Great dish....a standard in our house!

I really like this recipe. We use frozen corn instead of peas - they are juicier. I always add extra garlic to eat with the potatoes. Boneless and skinless chicken works very well here - the broth keeps things moist and adds flavor.

Chicken and potatoes were very, very tender. Tasted great!

Very, very good. Used 4 chicken breast and it worked out well. Used full can of broth and it was wonderful. For sure will make again!

I guess I'm one of the minority but in the current state of the fat watching population I'm surprised so many people are raving about this. Isn't it really just a form of fried chicken? It smelled great while it was cooking and the flavor was fine and it was colorful. I followed the suggestions to add white wine, more chicken broth and red pepper flakes. There was just a lot of liquified fat at the end. It wasn't clear what you were supposed to do with the cooked garlic.

This was a wonderful, easy, and fun recipe to make! I used a little white wine with the chicken broth. Thanks for helping make a busy mother's life a bit easier.

This dish was incredibly easy and absolutely delicious!! I took the advice of other reviewers and used chili powder rather than the red pepper. (I LOVE spicy food, but I have to comprimise with with my 'better half' on SOME things!) I also use boneless breast halves rather than boned parts. I will definitely make this again and again! (Oh, I would recommend using an entire can of chicken broth rather than half..I have a Calphalon 'everyday pan' that I can use in the oven. Even with the lid on, a lot of the broth evaporated/absorbed, so there wasn't as much juice as I think there was supposed to be.)

This recipe is terrific tasting and easy to make(a combination that you rarely find). Next time I would take the advice of some of the others and add more of the crushed red pepper.

I was disappointed. I found this to be bland and colorless.Would encourage tinkering with the recipe to suit your own tastes.

Really great one-dish meal. Used chili powder and black pepper instead of the crushed red pepper and it worked fine. Also used chicken breasts and wine. Presented nicely on platter with potatoes and peas surrounding chicken.

Turned out great. Easy to make. I sprinkled the potatoes with my standard garlic powder/paprika/salt/pepper combo before browning. A good way to make use of economical bone-in chicken

This was a great one-dish meal. I used Cornish Hen halves (the skin is not nearly as fatty as chicken), trimmed it up some & browned it really well, and it turned out terrific. My husband especially liked this dish, and he isn't usually that fond of 'spicy' foods. We'll do it again.

I took everyone's advice and made this with the boneless skinless chicken breasts. It was wonderful. I spiced up the chicken with paprika. I've already passed the recipe along and have heard only great things about it! I will definitely add this to my favorites!

I am amazed at the complex but subtle flavor that such a simple recipe can produce. Instead of using whole chicken or boneless chicken breast I used boneless chicken legs.....cost less with more flavor. This will be a regular.

I also didn't love this recipe... I agree it might be better with boneless skinless chicken breast...

I tried this recipe using skinless, boneless chicken breasts - everyone loved it. Had two breasts leftover and chopped them up for a kickin' chicken salad. Yummy!

This was a great dish. Too bad the cook from Indianapolis had problems with it. It did smell great while cooking. In fact, we had a man doing some painting on the outside of our house and we had to send him home with a plate of this!

I don't understand all the excitement about this one. It smelled wonderful while cooking but I ended up with an extremely greasy dish full of chicken fat. I might try it again but if I do, it will be with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

Good Garlic flavor. Added canned button mushroom and more red peppers .. simply delicious.

This was a really good, easy recipe. I added a bit more broth and next time I make it I will add more red pepper - it could have been hotter for our tastes and also I would probably throw in a few more garlic cloves - they are delish spread over some crusty bread!

Wonderful recipe! I used chicken breasts and added 1/2 c. white wine and everyone loved it! Good garlicky flavor.

A simple, elegant one-dish meal. I reduced approx. 1/2 c white wine after the chicken was browned and increased the chicken stock to 2/3 cups.

This recipe is fast enough for a weeknight meal, but delicious enough for entertaining. Next time I make it I will add more garlic cloves (which roast very nicely in the pot) and a little more liquid for extra gravy.
