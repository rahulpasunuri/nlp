I made this for dinner last night and my husband loved it. There are a lot of steps to the recipe but it comes together nicely. Although you can just do the lamb the ragout adds a nice complement to the meal. I served with mashed potatoes.

This is beyond douth one of the finest meal you can prepare. Not only does it teast perfect, it is also grand presentation. I also served garlic mashed potatoes. but 135 degrees is a little high for my taste. I perfer 125 and let rest prior to serving.

I made the lamb portion of this recipe to rave reviews. My husband also loved it and always asks for for this lamb recipe on special occaisions. I didn't make the ragout. I prefer potatoes with lamb, so I made some garlic mashed potatoes with the lamb instead.

Works great with a 7-8 pount leg of lamb, as well. Just double the recipe and spread about 1/4"-3/8" of the broad/hazelnut coating across the entire top surface after placing the leg in a roasting pan.

A new client requested rack of lamb on short notice and I didn't want to admit I'd never cooked that cut before. Usually when I've bluffed like that I at least try it at home first, but I didn't have time. This recipe was a life-saver. A complete success. Made me look like a much more experienced caterer than I am. A thermometer is important here--I would have overcooked it otherwise. The ragout was an unusual touch. It went well with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans and glazed carrots. I hope my client doesn't read this!

I prepared this recipe for a dinner party of 20 in our Gourmet Cooking Group. I had men ranting about how wonderful this dish was. There were all but 3 chops left and my son had them on day 2. He wondered if we could have them again that next night! I almost over cooked them, as they were medium-rare when removed from the oven, and cooked almost too much while they were resting. I think the timing is 5 minutes too long.

This is the first time I have done rack of lamb and am converted. While very expensive, the meat was tender and succulent and looked spectacular. However, although this turned out quite well for a gala company dinner, I suspect a simpler treatment would be even better. I also did not think the "ragout" added much. Guests were impressed, in its favor.

I have made this lamb several times and it has always been very well received. I cook it on a charcoal grill with indirect heat.

I am not a meat eater, so I am going on the word of my family, but they thought the lamb was deeelicious. The recipe will definitely be added to the Easter repetoire.

I have served this for Easter dinner every year since the recipe appeared in Bon Appetit. Everyone loves it! It is on my list of "Special Occasion" dishes. Well worth the time and effort.

My brother and sis-in-law have requested this dish every year for their anniversary since the first time I made it & they still love it!! Since my husband doesn't like hazelnuts, I substitute toasted almonds. I make a ratatouille and side of steamed green beans instead of the tomato ragout. This is a family favorite!

I made this dish for a dinner party and it was a hit. I didn't use the ragou. It kept the meet very moist. The people who didn't like lamb usually loved it as well as everyone else.

I made this dish for my matron of honor and her husband as a thank you for all her help at my wedding. The lamb came out very tender and delicious, my only problem was that the crust did not stay on the meat while I was carving. I don't know what I did wrong! Also, the ragout took a little longer to make then indicated. I also served goat-cheese mashed potatoes and Spanish red wine completed the meal. Delicious - but only for special occassions.

I fixed this for Easter dinner and everyone agreed that it rivaled ANY lamb dish they had ever tasted. Could not find hazlenuts so substituted raw almonds which I roasted. I did not serve it with the ragout. Instead I served "Baby carrots & Asparagus", "WIld Mushrooms with Peppers and Goat Cheese" (both from Epicurious) and Twice baked potatoes. Accompanied with Franciscan "Magnificat" meritage red wine. OUTSTANDING!!!

I served this to friends for Easter dinner and one made the comment, "I'm eating at the best restaurant in Chicago." Definitely worth the preparation and effort.

this was very impressive and extremely flavorful. I used the crust for a pork tenderloin with great success, too.

The lamb was great. The only trouble I had was with the ragout. I did not like the flavor of the fennel so the second time I made it I did not use fennel and instead put some leek into it. That was fabuous and that is how I make it now. Great dinner for two on a special occasion.
