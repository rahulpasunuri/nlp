The curd sauce was quite tasty but the pork was just okay. Edible, but only okay. Followed the recipe exactly.

Amazing recipe! Delicious flavor and so easy to prepare. I didn't change a thing, but next time I will check the pork after 1 1/2 hrs of simmering. I'm looking forward to enjoying the left overs. Definitely a keeper.

Really liked this. It took less time than expected so be careful not to let it cook to dryness. Amazing flavors for such a simple recipe

This was a good dish, although my pork was a little bit dry and slightly bland even though it was very tender. After bringing the milk to a boil, I would turn it down to a simmer (not medium low). I was amazed at the transformation of the milk.. the curds/ sauce was delicious. This is definitely worth making and I will try it again.
