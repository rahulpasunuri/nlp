Yikes! I meant "add" to the flavor - sorry if I offended. I was typing too fast!!!

I'd really give this more like 2 1/2 forks. Good but not mind-blowing. I do think letting it sit more would ass to the flavor (I only did it 3 hours ahead) It came together in a snap though, which adds to the appeal. I trimmed part of the rind because I wasn't sure my "audience" would like it as much. Don't skip the toasts - they really made it! I used a mini pump loaf and they came out great.

I have been making this recipe for years. It is always a big hit. Do make the dip a day or two in advance. Don't skip the pumpernickel toasts though! Make them the day you will serve. They really do complete the dish.

I have made this recipe a few times for several groups with varying likes and dislikes in food and it continues to be a big winner. It is true it is better to make it a day or so ahead, but it is still good when made the day of. I'm not sure why somebody left out the caraway seeds. It's sort of the whole point of the recipe, but (as my daughter would say) whateverrrrr! :)

This was easy and popular. I used the fancy packaged pumpernickel.

I am in the catering business and this spead continues to be one of my most requested items. They key is to make it in advance (2 days)and allow the flavors to mellow. I've used both camembert and brie. Yes, use the whole thing, rind and all.

I would like to just confirm, you puree the camembert with the rind attached?

I found this dissappointing - the taste was not exceptional. I added more caraway seeds, and cracked pepper,which helped.

It is a quick and easy recipe. I took it to a party and was a BIG hi. I justed toasted the pumpernicel and thought it was good enough. I may and more caraway and I subed brie instead.

Made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I served it with toasted baguette, and left out the caraway seeds and it was still eaten up pretty quickly. Very good!

I wasn't immediately blown away by this dish. I felt it looked a little bland. It received rave reviews when I took it to a dinner party and it was deemed a "keeper". I will make it again soon!
