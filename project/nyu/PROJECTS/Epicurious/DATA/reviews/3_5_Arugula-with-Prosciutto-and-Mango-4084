my dinner party was wowed by the "fancy" yet simple salad. I used mixed lettuce, could not find straight arugula and it was still delicious.

That was so good and so easy!

I used very, very ripe mango for this recipe which I think makes a big difference in the overall salad. Marsala balances nicely with the sweetness of the mango. I used proscuitto de parma, sliced very thin and hand torn to bite-sized pieces with the fat left behind.

The tropical mango just did not work with the arugula.

A perfect salad! The sweet and bitter are great partners, the trick is finding the ideal mango. I used balsamic vinegar instead of sherry wine vinegar.

Super easy and pretty tasty, great little summer salad. I substituted balsamic vinegar for the Sherry vinegar and it was good. Did I mention how Easy this is?!
