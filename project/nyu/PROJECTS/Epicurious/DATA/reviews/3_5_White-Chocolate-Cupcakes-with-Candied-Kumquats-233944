The taste is great. The totally concave fallen cupcakes, not so much. I read the reviews but thought I'd try it myself. I got totally inconsistent results, some were just flat and others completely fallen in the center to the point of there being virtually no cupcake left, just some cake lining the cupcake paper. I really wish Bon Appetit would test this recipe again and tell us what to do, because the flavor is so good. Very disappointing.

I have made this twice. Its great! (although I only made the cake and used a different frosting each time) It has never fallen as some previous reviewers complained of. It is moist and rich and has a really great white chocolate flavor. If you are paring this with another frosting watch out bc this cake is so sweet that with a really sweet frosting it is sweetness overload. Also, I never used coconut mild w this and instead used regular milk and just a tiny bit of coconut extract (around 1/8 teaspoon).

EPIC FAIL... I only attempted the cake recipe. The flavor was good, the problem was they COLLAPSED. When i say collapse, i mean the entire cupcake basically just coated the paper liner. I didn't even make it to the frosting because I had no cupcake!

I used just the cake part of this recipe. The cake was very moist and had a good flavor. I definitely could taste the white chocolate in them. Be careful and DON'T overbeat your egg whites! I got mine a little harder than soft peak and I could tell by the crunchiness of the tops that they didn't quite bake right because of this.

This was an intense baking experience. I am a novice baker, I screwed up something every step of the way, but somehow I was rewarded with beautiful and delicious cupcakes. I used foil cupcake liners because I don't have a pan, I overcooked the chocolate making it grainy, adding it to the mixture melted the butter and made the batter thick, oily and grainy; I swore they wouldn't turn out. Afraid of them falling, I tested my theory that they fall because of a quick temperature drop upon removal from the oven. When they were done but still not browned I turned off the oven but kept it open a crack and they cooled perfectly. My friends have raved, my boyfriend is obsessed, and my office thanks me. A lot of work but they certainly are a gourmet treat.

very rich. i could definitely taste the white chocolate. my cupcakes also sank. it made me angry. i'm going to do some tests because i think this recipe has too much fat in it and could possibly do pretty nicely without half of the butter and white chocolate.

This recipe was a disaster for me. I read the other reviews so I knew others had problems with fallen cupcakes. I was careful with my mixing technique, measurements, oven temp, etc and these fell like a brick. The middle completely sunk. I also did not think they tasted all that great. I thought the coconut milk overpowered the white chocolate flavor, not enhanced it. I rarely give bad reviews on this website, but I would say don't waste time.

Nice, moist crumb -- not dense. I made these in mini-muffin tins and ended up with 48, with enough for six regular-sized cupcakes to boot. They baked up perfectly domed on top but when cooled, fell in the middle -- although they're fully cooked throughout. Whatever, though... I plan to disguise it with frosting. Will definitely make again.

My review is based solely on the cake portion. These were delicious and moist! Rather than using the accompanying frosting recipe, I used a recipe for chocolate whipped cream frosting. I altered this chocolate frosting by adding raspberry preserves w/ 2Tbsp of brandy. This gave the frosting a delicious, subtle raspberry flavor that went superbly with the white chocolatey goodness of the cupcakes!

I have made this recipe two times. The first time, they rose and came out perfectly. The second time, they fell in the middle. The only difference that I remember is that I used paper liners the second time and just poured the batter into the muffin tins the first time. This is puzzling. They were delicious both times, but I was disappointed with the collapse. It seems that this has happened to a number of the reviewers. I do a fair amount of baking and did not think it would happen to me! Does anyone else have an explanation? In praise of the cupcakes, my family can't get enough of them and didn't care a bit that they fell.

I was cooking for a rather conservative crowd and thought the kumquats might scare them off, so replaced the kumquats with fresh blueberries to delicious effect. I also left the white chocolate out of the frosting and was none the worse for it; I think if I had included it the cupcakes would be far too much.

I only had 11 paper liners and so I filled each to about three-quarters full. This may have been why they fell in the middle slightly after cooling. I am waiting to taste them. They smell intoxicating - and I'll be leaving the white chocolate out of the frosting as there is enough in the batter. So a simple cream cheese icing will suffice. I'm excited to try them - I made them for our pre-celebratory anniversary. I know my husband will enjoy them - he likes anything with white chocolate. One more note: I used Callebaut's white chocolate.

These turned out beautifully. I made them for my boyfriend last weekend and he loved them. They were somewhat dense, but we both like that. The frosting was delicious and the kumquats tasty. I just ate one for breakfast, and even after sitting in the fridge for two days, it was fabulous. Also, I'm saving the kumquat syrup for mixed beverages.

I didn't have enough chocolate so I halved the amount in both the batter and frosting. It worked out really well; you could taste the chocolate but it wasn't overpowering as white chocolate sometimes can be. Definitely do not skimp on the kumquats- a real crowd pleaser.

I loved the density of these cupcakes..I used them as part of a trio dessert for Valentines dinner. Only thing I changed was to put long shedded coconut as garnish with a tiny pink chocolate heart. Guests raved.

i used the kumquats from my new tree for this recipe (candied kumquats also on this site - easy & delicious). i accidentally skipped the egg white step in the first batch, which came out more like blondies. recovered with the second batch, which were delicious. i also chose to leave out the white chocolate from the frosting and it was still delightful. definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe! I have never had a problem with them falling flat or being too greasy. I have made them 3 times and usually can't wait to make them again. My variations are that I use Agave Nectar instead of sugar in the dough recipe. (1/4 cup nectar = 1 c sugar) and I also used candied pineapple instead of kumquats which everyone that has tried them here loves.

Mine fell in the middle too, and I cooked them at 300 for about 30 minutes as some of the other reviewers recommended. They were still very tasty. I also made some mini cupcakes that turned out much better. I decorated them with fresh berries.

We baked it 10 minutes longer than suggested and they were fabulous! The icing was delicious with the salt recommended. We will definitely make these again!

I am an experienced cook, so I was surprised at how poorly these turned out for me! They sunk in the middle and were like heavy little grease balls. I still had to scrub the pan despite using paper liners because the grease bled through. Yuck!

I thought this recipe tasted delicious, however the texture was way too dense. Perhaps I under mixed? Or I probably overbaked somehow... I did check for doneness at 20 minutes and went the full 25. (Or maybe my oven is off?) I still would like to make this again but will ease up on the salt for the frosting.

Delicious! They *did* come out a little flat, rather than perfectly domed like most cupcakes, but who cares?!? I couldn't find kumquats, but I saw blood oranges, so I grabbed them and candied those instead. The cupcakes were really sweet enough without added frosting, so instead I just topped them with the blood oranges and drizzled the syrup over them... ok, I know this is pretty different than the original recipe, but I made the base cupcake exactly to specifications and it was superb. Don't be afraid to leave them in the oven an extra few minutes.

The outstanding feature of this recipe is the Candied Kumquats ! The results for this citrus garnish are nothing short of A + ! You gotta make 'em !

The Lady cook from the Midwest has hit the nail on the head about why they are sinking in the middle. I cooked mine at 300 for about 10 minutes or so longer than the recipe says and I came out with perfectly risen cupcakes that didn't fall in the middle. The flavor was fabulous too. I will definately make them again using my baking alterations.

This was a little different, but really good. Halved the recipe since it's just the two of us, but I can tell you I'll be eating more of my fair share! Had a small problem with the final cupcakes - the middle did sink a bit, but found that was because they weren't entirely done, even after the toothpick test. Nevertheless, still delicious.

The same thing happened to me and I also suspect it was the egg whites. The dough is also very dense and moist, and so while the flavor is fantastic, esp. with all components together, I may try to lighten up the dough by tinkering with the wet ingredients and butter next time.

I'll have to make these cupcakes again, because me first attempt failed. As soon as I took the cupcakes out of the oven, they all sunk in the middle. I fear that my bowl and beater weren't pristinely clean when beating the egg whites. I wasn't able to bring the cupcakes in to work, but my husband and I sampled the wreckage and they were still delicious. They had a great white chocolate flavor and were very moist. The coconut milk was a great addition. A fabulous change from the standard white cupcake, and I will try them again (hopefully with better results!).
