I made the waffles but not the blueberry sauce. The flavor was delicious, adding an additional TBSP of lemon rind, so the lemon flavor was perfect! The waffles were a bit soggy, but I was trying out a new Belgian Waffle maker so maybe this was the issue. My usual Cuisinart waffle maker produces crispy, light waffles, so not sure if it was the batter or the waffle maker. Will have to follow up with additional rating once tested on the old machine.

Waffles aren't as lemon-y as I expected, but they're good, especially with blueberry syrup. That said, I used a different blueberry syrup recipe than this one which was too gloopy and too sweet.

I am also reviewing the blueberry sauce--delicious and great consistency! I made it to go with a lemon curd cheesecake, and I didn't want it to be too sweet, so I only used half the sugar...I also used homemade apple cider. Perfect! :)

I made this recipe the other day. I made the waffles only, without the sauce. I was disappointed that the waffles came out soft and floppy, not crispy as my usual recipe does. I tried cooking some for a bit longer to firm them up, but they ended up getting burnt. Maybe a wafflemaker with an adjustable thermostat would do a better job. In any case, they had a great flavor, and I froze the leftovers, toasted them the next day, and they were wonderful.

This review is for the blueberry sauce only. I made the sauce to go with a lemon yogurt cake, and it was very good. I did not thaw my berries, and I only used 1/4 cup apple juice to make up for the liquid released by the frozen berries. The consistency was perfect. The only change I would make in the future would be to add a little more lemon juice. And to double the recipe, since I only had enough sauce for half the cake (using very generous servings of sauce over each slice).

I was looking for a sauce that would accompany a classic cheesecake and this sauce turned out beautifully. I did not add the additional 2 TBSP apple juice and it turned out delicious! I am looking forward to making the waffles in the near future.

I used oregon wild hucklebery syrup,mixed with some blackberry preserves and added fresh squeezed meyer lemons. Wonderful and the waffles remind me of lemon poppyseed cake, great leftover snacks.

This is the best waffle batter I've found, and I've tried a lot of them. It made 7 waffles in my round Cuisinart and each only took 3 mins 15 secs to cook @ the 3.5 setting. I didn't have apple juice for the sauce or poppy seeds for the waffle batter, but they were wonderful anyway. Next time I won't put QUITE so much sauce on my waffles -- turned my teeth blue. :) And worth it.

Just used the blueberry sauce for a dessert and YUMMM.. I loved it!

Really tasty waffles! Didn't try this blueberry sauce recipe - used the Blueberry Compote recipe instead and it was wonderful. I did not think that the waffles were very lemony - I will probably add more grated lemon next time. I found the waffles very light!

These were wonderful. I didn't have apple juice so used cranberry juice I had on hand and it was fabulous. I used splenda instead of sugar and no one noticed. The waffles turned out nice and crisp ... I didn't over-stir the batter and let it sit for alost 30 minutes before using it.

These were delicious! Unfortunately, I didn't have the ingredients on hand to make the blueberry sauce, but the waffles were perfect in every way! I served them with maple syrup, but I would love try this again with blueberry sauce!

I made these waffles for my mom's birthday and my family LOVED them! I omitted the poppy seeds and used another reviewier's idea for replacing the flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup wheat germ. They stayed very moist and cooked perfectly! Also, I replaced the apple juice in the berry sauce with lemon juice when dissolving the cornstarch and used two splenda packets in place of the sugar.

The blueberry sauce is wonderful. I added honey after it cooked to cut the tartness.

I thought this was good. I used 1 1/2 cups buttermilk by accident, and it was fine. For the sauce, I used mixed berries and orange juice because it was what I had on hand. Very good. The kids wanted to give it four forks.

I made a few changes. I used 1 cup freshly ground whole wheat flour instead of white and 1/2 cup of wheat germ. 3tbl of sugar. This is healthy and yummy.

You know, I thought that the waffles were good but not exceptional. The blueberry sauce was way too sweet for our taste. We ended up scraping it off and eating just with syrup. I don't think I would make this again.

The waffles and blueberry sauce have great flavor but I do not agree with the description that the waffles are light. The batter is extremely thick and heavy. I added about 1/3 cup more milk, separated the eggs and whipped the whites before folding in and I still thought they should be lighter. Next time I will try reducing the amount of flour by 1/4c. Using milk instead of buttermilk would help making a thinner batter but I would miss the flavor, buttermilk complements the lemon so well.

Haven't tried the waffles, but made the blueberry sauce to serve over lemon pound cake at a dinner party. Everyone loved it- two avowed blueberry lovers said it was one of the best desserts they'd ever had! I wouldn't change a thing.

These waffles smell and taste delicious. I added chopped pears, cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. Superb!!

Excellent recipe!

I took the advice of others and only used 2 eggs and butter in place of oil. I had a raspberry sauce in the fridge I wanted to use, so I made these waffles. I used my Belgium waffler and cooked them on the next to last highest setting, and they turn out great, crisp on the outside, almost cake-like on the inside. The kids loved them.

This is the first time I made waffles and they were great. They were nice and crisp on the ouside and soft on the inside - maybe it depends on your waffle maker. They were good with maple syrup also, although everyone preffered the bleuberry sauce!

I was frantically searching for a blueberry sauce recipe to serve with a lemon cheesecake that I had made. This sauce was perfect. I didn't make the waffles, so keep that in mind when reading thsi review, but given some of the other reviews they seemed "iffy" anyway. The sauce was great and I'll keep it for future use!

This recipe came together nicely, in that the lemon poppyseed combination came through and the blueberry sauce was delumptious- especially with wild blueberries- but i did find the waffles a little too chewy and eggy, so maybe less eggs next time. Nice presentation however, along with sliced fresh fruit.

Good receipe, the blueberry sauce is outstanding. However the waffles have a good flavor they are too chewy. The receipe has too many eggs and not enough liquids to obtain a crunchy waffle. Try next time Reduce the eggs to 2 medium sized eggs separating the yolks from the whites, Whipping the whites to form soft peaks and folding at the end into the batter. Also nix buttermilk and use regular and exchange butter for cooking oil.

Mine came out dense and chewier than I would prefer (but I prefer lighter, crisper waffles in general anyway). The blueberries were a little intense, too. Just not my taste, but if you prefer that style, it will be great.

I forgot to add the butter but these were still wonderful. I served them with fruit salad that had been marniaded in cinnamon and honey, and whipped cream. Very Very good

I've made this recipe twice and both times it was absolutely delicious. It's fairly easy and you can purchase blueberry syrup to save time.

FOR THE PAST 32 YEARS I HAVE BEEN MAKING THE SAME WAFFLES. I THOUGHT THE BEST! THESE ARE FABULOUS AND SO ARE THE BLUEBERRIES.

These waffles were loved by my family. They are tasty and mildly sweet. I didn't have enough butter to double this recipe, so I used veg. oil and it tasted real good. I also used eggbeaters instead of eggs, to reduce the fat content.

I had to substitute raspberries for the blueberries as they were unable, the sauce was very nice with a lovely tang to it. I thought the waffles were really yummy and look forward to making them with blueberries next time.

Great tasting waffles! - similar to lemon-poppyseed muffins. Almost dessert-like. I could picture eating them dusted with powdered sugar and topped with fresh fruit. Instead I had them with maple syrup and wasn't crazy about it. Can't wait to try them with the blueberry sauce!!
