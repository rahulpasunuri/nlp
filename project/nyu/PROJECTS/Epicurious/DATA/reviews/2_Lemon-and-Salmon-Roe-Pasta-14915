After receiving several sacs of fresh Salmon roe from a neighbor who fishes and hunts, I was hard pressed to use it until seeing this recipe. To prep the roe, I soaked the sacs in hot salted water and used chopsticks to break them up. Then I drained the liquid and added fresh salted water and picked as many pieces of the sac out of the mixture. I strained the eggs and prepared the sauce and pasta. It's a very salty dish, so perhaps do not add the pasta water if it is very salty. Also, the dish tastes good, but it's so rich! It's more dinner party material.
