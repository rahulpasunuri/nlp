Love this recipe, a quick and delicious dessert. I baked in individual ramekins and served straight from the oven with the ramekins on side plates, this illuminated the process of having to get them out of the pan and onto a dessert plate, whilst still looking pretty. Tastes even better with vanilla ice cream! Enjoy......

A big hit! And easy. I did leave them in the oven for 20 minutes and they turned out perfectly.

I gave it four forks since the taste is amazing. But they did not come out of the pans neatly. What size cupcake pans have people used? The intro says "little cupcake tins" but there is too much batter for the minis?

I have messed up this recipe by not waiting for the chocolate to cool sufficiently before mixing in the egg - the cakes never form up if you make this mistake. Simple recipe that produces excellent results.

These are absolutely phenomenal! The size is perfect to end the meal on a sweet note without going overboard, and refrigerating them in advance worked perfectly. (We had a guest over for dinner, so I made five with the recipe for four... they were a bit small, though.) Garnish with a quartered strawberry and powdered sugar for better presentation!

I had to give this 3 forks because I don't know what happened, but i cannot get them out of the pan!! I made them for the first time for my in-laws, as the first dessert i have ever made for them, and I was embarrassed to serve them because they looked gross, goo all over....but my brother in law found them and they were a hit anyway! Any suggestions as to how to get them out in one piece?

I've made these twice now. I like it since I don't have to separate the eggs and it can be prepared very quickly. The first time I put them in a mini muffin pan and they were great! Since they are so rich, the smaller size was perfect for our kids. The 2nd time (yesterday) I doubled the recipe and made 8. I reduced the butter by 25% and melted this with the chocolate in the microwave. I refrigerated them for at least 4 hours before baking for about 12-13 minutes and flipped them out. If we ate them right away, we had a perfectly warm chocolate sauce ooze out. The ones not eaten right away firmed up into a brownie. Very easy to make with yummy results.

Three forks for simplicity of ingredients, swift prep, and flavor, although presentation isn't great. I followed the recipe almost exactly (I sprayed my cupcake tin with Baker's Joy and added a largish pinch of cinnamon to the batter). Based on reviewers' comments, I upped the cooking time, checking them every 2 minutes (after minute 14), and finally took them out at 20 (though I think they could have used even more time). Out of the oven, they "fell" (the way a souffle does), eventually looking like puffy little fudge cookies on the plate. (Maybe adding more flour or stiffened egg whites might help them hold their structure?) They tasted wonderful, with a nice texture -- chewy, like a macaroon, on top, and velvety soft in the center. I would have liked them to present better, but the recipe is pretty good as is, and is a lovely starting point to incorporate other flavors (5 spice powder, or a hint of wasabi come to mind).

Sadly, these didn't turn out for me. I left them in well over 12 minutes (about 20) and they were still underdone. It was all gooey--no crunchyness to be found. We still ate the goo (because anything warm and chocolate tastes good), but I would definitely recommend a trial run before serving this at a dinner party.

I made these using bittersweet chocolate and used a mini muffin tin and it made 12 mini, bite sized cakes...perfect to pop in your mouth. This is a very good dessert.

This is an amazing recipe -- I have spent many hours making molten chocolate cakes that didn't come close to comparing to this. Made it on a lark because my kids wanted something for dessert on a Tuesday night. The five of us almost came to blows on how to divide the cakes!

Woah. Get this right, and you get rave reviews. A little bit of a crunchy, chewy crust and inside lays the most moist, decadent, warm center you could desire. Make sure that the tops of the cakes are rising a little, and cracked all over-- I found it needed a little more cooking time than the recipe asked for. This got great reviews from snotty New York foodies. And the best part is-- it's SO easy!

Wonderful!! This was incredibly easy and tastey! I added fresh raspberries to the batter and garnished with chocolate shavings and more raspberries. I definatly will be making this again soon.

AMAZING!!! So simple and delicious! Followed the recipe exactly, so if you're making for more then four people, be sure to double the recipe. Unbelievable that something so tasty is so easy to make!
