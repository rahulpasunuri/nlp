I made this tonight as a side to my husbands grilled chicken thighs. It was good! I used the wrong kind of rice, salted butter, and regular sodium chicken stock so....it was a little salty, my fault. I agree with other reviewers that some hot sauce might be a tasty kick. We will eat it again. My first time making okra and I thought it made the dish!

Superb. A deconstructed southern supper. great with traditional vinegar cucumber, tomato, onion salad with lots of black pepper.

This recipe may be delicious, but it's not vegetarian. (Hint: chicken broth comes from chickens.) The recipe should at least have a note saying to use chickpea broth or other mild vegetable broth to make it vegetarian. While vegetarians will make the switch themselves, well-meaning hosts might not. I also wonder at a "quick" dish that takes 50 minutes of active time.

This is excellent! I agree that I also make new recipes by the recipe the first time. This time I had to change it slightly. I can't purchase canned butter beans at any of my local grocery stores, so I used 2 cups of frozen beans that I had cooked and frozen for a later use. I also can't get fresh okra so I used frozen. That was the extent of altering this recipe. Both my children loved it as well!!! I will be making this again!

I thought this was a great southern twist on risotto. I actually modified it to use baby lima beans instead of butter beans. I was afraid that the butter beans would break down and make the risotto even more starchy. I also added some thyme to the risotto to perhaps compensate for the previous reviewers comments about lacking flavor. I thought it was delicious and my guests loved it. I found this receipt from 1991 that is very similar and calls for baby lima beans. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Lima-Bean-Risotto-1610

A tasty twist on the standard risotto. If you've got okra on your hands, this is a great and fairly low maintenance recipe. Makes a yummy one-dish dinner.

Ok. I admit I'm from Huntsville and I know the restaurant and the Chef, but what is going on here? Only one of the reviews actually followed the recipe. My wife & I follow a rule that when trying a recipe for the first time we follow it exactly. The next time we can try variations. We tried it tonight and thought it was excellent. One reviewer tried grilled okra. That is not what the recipe called for. Ok, but don't "dog" the recipe because you wanted to try something different. The crispy fried okra was one of the most important parts of the dish. It was a little different from my usual practice of frying okra. Here in the South, the way my Grandmother did it, we didn't use the buttermilk. We just dipped it in cornmeal and fried it crispy in wesson oil. Nobody in my family knew what olive oil was. The recipe produced a nice okra that was like the risotto, a little al dente. I do agree with the first reviewer in that if you want a little kick, fine, add a little hot sauce, etc. When I do my southern style fried okra, I always add a little cayenne pepper and eat it as an appetizer with an Old Forrester & water. Anyway, I disagree with any reviewer that said this dish didn't have much flavor. It was great and we cannot wait to make it for company. It is a complete meal.

This was okay - a bit bland though. The fried okra was a really nice touch but the risotto needed some flavour. I threw in a jalapeno and used black-eyed peas because TJs didn't have butter beans. I would make this again but would add some herbs and spices.

I love all of the ingredients in this but found the finished dish good but not memorable. I decided to grill the okra which my family felt was a good call- fried okra on risotto w/ beans sounded heavy! The grilled okra was delicious. I used navy beans rather than butter beans as that's what I had on hand. Nice dish, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

Didn't do the okra, but the risotto was perfect! The butter beans and chard made such a nice texture and flavor. Extra Parmesan, coarse black pepper! Yes
