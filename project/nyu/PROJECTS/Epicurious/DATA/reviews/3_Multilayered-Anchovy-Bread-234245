I'm not sure what I did wrong, but my loaf didn't rise very well. The texture was a little too much like corn bread than I would have liked, so next time I'll reduce the semolina flour. The anchovy filling was really tasty -- salty, of course, but very flavorful.

Well, was this a hit or what? My guests loved it so much they almost had no room for supper. I made Roasted Red Pepper and Feta Dip (from this website) and tapenade and they went very well with the bread. The only thing I might change is the semolina. I really was not fond of the grainy texture it gave to the bread.

I would like to add my 2 cents about semolina. It is a wheat flour but it's very coarse. It almost looks like polenta. This recipe looks really good. Even if I don't make the bread I will make the seasoned oil.

To the cook from Frankfurt, "00" flour is a high quality pizza flour sold at fornobravo.com. It probably isn't necessary to spend the money on this ingredient if you want to try this recipe for fun. Regular all-purpose bread flour should do the trick. As for semolina flour, I wonder if it the same thing we call 'cream of wheat' or 'wheatlets'.

This rating is actually in anticipation of how good it'll be. It does sound delicious. I just have one question: for those of us living in Europe (Germany in particular) what are "00" flour and semolina flour? The flours here are graded in terms of numbers, i.e. "405" (regular all-purpose flour) or "550" or "1050". I'd love to make this recipe but am a little timid to start experimenting with flours. Can someone out there help? Thanks in advance, Rosemarie.
