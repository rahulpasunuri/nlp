I have been searching for a good biscotti recipe, and I still need to search. This one is tasty, but not good enough. I chopped up the pistachios, and dried cherries (subbed for cranberries) and it still is difficult to get a clean cut (although a swift cut with a sharp - not serrated - knife worked best). The texture isn't the way they are at coffee shops - crispy on the outside & tender in the inside. Also, this recipe calls for way too much fruit/ nuts - I would use half the amount. My biggest issue is the shape. The recipe (and most others) call for rolling a log... as if it will flatten out as it bakes, so you get the traditional shape. Biscotti recipes vary so much! Some don't even call for butter! Should I try that? Please help.

This is a fairly straightforward recipe. Word of caution: While easy to make overall, do yourself a favor and consider chopping the nuts and cranberries! Otherwise, the dough is difficult (comes apart easy; hard to form).

Wonderful! I had to substitute walnuts, since I had no pistachios. I sprinkled a little red sanding sugar onto the white chocolate before it dried for a festive touch. Just the right texture.

I couldn't believe that Biscotti was so easy to make! I chopped the nuts and cranberries as I didn't think I would be able to cut the logs without crumbling the entire thing. I found that for me, the most effective way to cut it is to use quick sawing motion at the top and when you are halfway through, just give it a quick cut. Then again, I was too impatient to wait for the entire 10 mins for it to cool. And I only baked 4-5 mins each side. I'd imagine 9 mins on each side will make it way too hard for me. This recipe is so easy, I will make it over and over again!

Wonderful recipe!!!! I've used hazel nuts and also brazil nuts instead of pistachios. All are equally good. I make them year round. Many times I omit the chocolate. Be sure to gently cut with sharp knife on a diagonal.

A very delicious holiday treat. The anise and lemon zest provide the perfect balance to the sweet cookie, and the pistachios and cranberries not only give great holiday color, they taste wonderful. A new favorite for our holiday party.

This recipe is fabulous but DO NOT CUT THE LOG IN A "SAWING MOTION". This will cause the cookie to crumble. With a heavy knife slice in one motion. You will have beautiful cookies

Love ittttttt! Such an amazing combination of flavors and textures, and so beautiful. I never knew biscotti was so easy! Some people prefer theirs to be a little more crunchy, so I leave some of the batch in the oven for about 10 more minutes. I did have the slicing problem a bit (small pieces crumbling off), but then again I don't have very good knives... Definitely one of my favorite holiday recipes.

Rating: 4
My local supermarket didn't have shelled pistachios, so I used pecans instead. They were still delicious! If you make the logs wider and shorter, as I did, I recommend baking them at least 10 minutes longer before removing, cooling, slicing and re-baking. Also, do not skip the anise!

Delicious and easy. Chopping cranberries and pistachios as suggested by others definintely makes it easier to cut. Using a serrated tomato knife also is useful. I didn't use the white chocolate as more sweetness is not needed. Try it.

I only have two things to say: - I've made these every year since the recipe came out in 2003 and they've always been a hit! - Let baked logs cool thoroughly before slicing. A wonderful recipe.

These taste good but are too crumbly. I waited at least a half hour before cutting them, and half or more had pieces breaking off. Then I put them back in the oven, and when turning them after baking the first side, more of them crumbled. Since I was hoping to gift these, I need to find another recipe.

What is it with all the reviews leaving out anise seed? Are you kidding me? It's the secret ingredient in this biscotti.People are so unadventurous these days! I added cayenne pepper to the melted white chocolate. Oh my God..these biscotti are out of this world..especially with a hint of heat. Any review that says they left out the Anise Seed consider them idiots!!!!!!!!!

Made this for a party last night and it was a big hit. I hesitated about the anise, because I'm not a big fan, but it gave the biscotti a subtle flavor that really made them. Didn't have white chocolate around and can't see that they needed the sweetness. I would think about shaping the log differently next time to get longer slices.

Rating: 3
A definite keeper. I left out the anise, put in a little extra lemon and they taste great. I also agree that they are delicious on their own without the chocolate so I'm only going to dip half the batch. I highly, highly recommend letting the logs cool completely before cutting. It's SO MUCH easier.

Really easy and great flavour. Makes just less than 3 dozen. Temps & times are accurate. Skipped aniseed due to availability/expense and flavour was still great. Colour on these is really lovely. Do not prepare 3 pans with parchment - that's just silly and wasteful. 1 is fine, 2 luxury.

Rating: 4
Amazing recipe. I have made it at least 4 times since November, and it's been perfect every time. I left out the lemon zest and the white chocolate. But the anise totally makes the recipe, and I don't even like anise. Chopping the cranberries and pistachios before adding them makes the slicing easier (fewer chunks to tear through the dough).

Rating: 4
Made without the anise, these are one of my holiday standards - with or without white chocolate coating. Office mates wait all year for more of them. Word of warning to chill the dough before baking into logs if it's a little runny - I was lazy this year and it thinned out a lot but was still tasty. Just delicious and the red cranberries and green pistachios (trader joes is a great source) make them festive.

Rating: 2
I made these without the anise. My husband loved them, I think they're good but not great. The instructions should say not to even try anything but the very best white chocolate. All I got was a big white lump, which I managed to save by melting sugar in simmering water and whisking that in. The cookies are fine without chocolate anyway. After the 1st baking I froze one log to slice and bake later. After thawing I found that it sliced MUCH more easily than the first one, with a minimum of crumbling. My guess is that the log needs to be cooled more than the recommended 10 minutes before slicing for the best results.

I thought these were just OK. My husband's aunt happened to make a different recipe, which included almond extract and no lemon peel. They also required slightly less baking. Now that biscotti had the flavor I was searching for.

Great year round! I made these for the holidays in 2007 & get requests for them ever since. They can be made with Splenda rather than suger and we can't tell the difference. Also, I melt the white chocolate in a ziplock in the microwave, cut the corner, and drizzle these, rather than dip. It is faster and easier. These are just a good without the chocolate in my opinion, and a great recipe overall.

I just made this for a cookie exchange and it was wonderful! It yielded as specified. The colors were festive with the occassion. The flavor of the citrus, anise and hint of nut was perfect to even eat by itself. The recipe was easy to follow and gave good baking times. However, when slicing the cookie, try use long gradual sawing motions to avoid cookie from crumbling due to the nuts & berries.

I have made these in the past and they always come out perfect.This time I did soak the cranberries in boiling water for ten minutes and then drained them and patted them down very very well with paper towel. I tried the confectioners sugar and it was a major mess, the sugar did not adhere to the dough and it stuck to everything. I switched to flour and it was fine. I doubled the batch...and they are now in the oven.

I have never made biscotti before and tried this recipe yesterday with great success. Honestly, this is some of the best biscotti I have ever had. I did not have anise seeds so substituted 1 tbs Sambuca, which was perfect. I don't care for super sweet things, so left out the white chocolate. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. Very easy to make and so good. I will be making this again often!

these are really great cookies. very flavorful. I made them according to the recipe and everything was easy and turned out beautifully. I feel that anise is an essential flavor to these cookies and traditional biscotti in general, omitting it would really be a detriment to the flavor. It is subtle and really adds something. I understand not liking anise, but I got over my aversion to it recently and it really makes a difference when used correctly.

I have been looking for a holiday cookie recipe like this for years! It has a wonderful, subtle flavor and a delightful color scheme :) I didnt have quite enough aniseed, so I substituted just a bit of fennel. Some family members dont like white chocolate, so I left it off a few. They tasted fine, but the chocolate definitely adds dimension and good texture. I highly recommend these cookies!!

These are beautiful and full of flavor. I like to dip half of them in white chocolate and the other half in dark - the green and red in the biscotti make for a lovely holday presentation! Be careful not to bake them too long, or the pistachios will lose their green color (though they'll still taste great).

Hey what happened to the cranberry pistachio biscotti recipe from 1992 adapted from Carol Field? which appeared in the Dec. 2001 issue of Gourmet???? That recipe is SOOO simple and uses no butter. I slice the logs very thin with a Victorinox tomato knife straight out of the oven. I don't bother cooling the logs and they slice perfectly without crumbs. I don't chop either the pistachios or the cranberries. This way you have beautiful large pieces in every slice. The old recipe used 1 1/3c cranberries, soaked in boiling water 10 min.Then drained and patted dry w. paper towels, and 1c. salted pistachios. Whisk together 2 1/2 c flour, 1 c. sugar, 1/2 tsp each baking soda, baking powder and salt. Beat in just until a dough forms: 3 large eggs and 1 tsp vanilla. Finally add the whole cranberries and whole, unchopped nuts. Brush the logs w. an egg wash. Bake 25-30 min in a 325F oven. Slice and toast 20 min (turning layers over halfway through). VERY EASY and pretty and crisp.

I am a holiday cookie monster, but this was my first attempt at making any kind of biscotti. The reviews were full of helpful hints, and the results were virtually professional. My family does not care for anise, so I added a bit of orange flower water and a tad more vanilla. Next time I will add a little more lemon and perhaps some orange zest.

For those who tend to over scrutinize the details, yes my review (below) has an error. Ghirardelli baking bars come in 4 oz. bars, not 6 oz. as I had stated. I used two 4 oz. bars which gave me a nice thick coating on just the tip with just a very little chocolate left over. Also, I couldn't find unsalted pistachios at any of the supermarkets in my area. I found them at the local health food co-op. Enjoy!

I just made these for Christmas and they turned out wonderful. This was my first attempt at making biscotti, so I read a few of the reviews before starting. I did follow the advice of chopping the pistachios and cranberries and had no crumbling problems when cutting. However, I ignored the advice against domestic chocolates. I used two 6 oz. bars of Ghirardelli white baking chocolate. I had no problems with it separating and it worked beautifully. I can't wait to take them over to my sister's house later today. I love the way they turned out, you can bet I'll be making these again, but next time it will be a double batch. I only got 26 biscotti out of a single batch (30 if you count the ends we ate during the 2nd baking).

This is delicious with coffee for breakfast--for that reason, I leave off the white chocolate. This is also easy to make, especially if you follow the advice of earlier reviewers and let the logs cool longer after the first bake.

Delicious flavor! Definitely spring for the anise - I couldn't imagine the cookies without. We cut one of the two loaves after 20 minutes of cooling and it crumbled a considerable amount. We let the other loaf cool an additional 10 minutes and slicing was significantly easier. The cookies are not quite as handsome as I'd like, but when it comes to gifts, it's the thought (and taste!) that count, eh? When making these cookies again, I'd make sure there was a higher dough to fruit/nut ratio, as a considerable amount of the dough stuck to my fingers despite a considerable amount of flour (I guess mixing in the cranberries and pistachios in with my hands probably contributed to this). Otherwise, I would change nothing!

Many many comments on this recipe. If you want to save yourself a long read, here are the most important tips: Chop the cranberries and the nuts in half (but not finer than that) to minimize crumbling problems when slicing after the first bake. The dough is sticky and can be handled more easily by using powdered sugar in lieu of flour. The logs can range from 12"L x 2" to 15"L x 1-1/4" - suit your own taste. Make sure the logs are smooth on top before you pop them into the oven (another crumble-prevention technique) and use a bit of water to smooth them. First bake (of the logs) should be about 35 minutes max. COOL COMPLETELY before attempting slicing. A large chef knife or cleaver with a straight-through cut works best with no crumbling. Slice at angle to make for longer pieces (if desired). Instead of baking the slices cut sides down and flipping, sit the slices upright on edge and bake them about 11 minutes or until showing brown as indicated in recipe. Finally - two tips based purely on your taste -- consider bumping up the aniseed if you like it and the lemon too. Finally, people are equally divided on whether to dip in chocolate for the finish - either way they'll be delicious, but the chocolate finish will make them beautiful.

These biscotti are amazing!! I followed the recipe, chopped the cranbs and pistachios, rolled the dough out on pdr sugar as suggested, and let the dough cool overnight (and wetted it, as suggested) before cutting. Cutting was easy. They were delicious. I am making them a second time. They loved them at work, too.

What a waste of time! First of all, the picture shows the usual biscotti shape, but the instructions say to roll them into a 'log', which ends up to be 1 1/4" ovals. Also, there are way too many cranberries & nuts, and not enough dough. They completely fell apart, and I ended up with half as much as I expected. Awful.

I've just made this recipe for the first time, making two double batches for gifts, and they came out perfectly. I took earlier reviewers' advice, replacing the lemon with orange zest, painting the loaves with an egg wash before the first baking, and standing them on edge for the 2nd baking to preserve the lovely colours, and the result is picture perfect. (I also omitted the anise as it's not a favourite of my husband's.) Everyone loves them, kids included, but all agreed that the chocolate would be too much.

Excellent but crumbly. Would try baking 40 min at 300, wait 10 minutes then 20 min each side at 300 like my other biscotti to see if that helped. Also didn't use the anise and tasted just fine but would love to try when I do get that spice.

I've made these twice this week and they're wonderful! I live in a rural area and most local stores don't stock Perugina or other imported chocolate. On the 1st attempt, I used Ghirardelli chocolate and it melted fine but wasn't as opaque and velvety-looking as the picture. I changed my technique and drizzled it in a zig-zag using a pastry bag like a previous reviewer said. Much better! This 2nd time, I tried Lindt chocolate - big mistake. It separated in the pan and became a gooey mess. The diminutive size is growing on me. Yummm...

I've never made (or eaten, for that matter) biscotti in my life, but they were so pretty in the picture that I just had to make them for my holiday cookie gift baskets. So, I followed the recipe exactly, but lengthened the cooling time to 20 minutes after the first bake, and baked them on end (as suggested in other reviews here) to keep the pistachios green. I had no problems, no crumbling, and they taste amazing. Husband originally rejected the idea of even trying them, because he "hates biscotti," and lo, and behold, he loved the little end pieces I gave him! Will definitely keep this recipe and make it again.

I was very disappointed in the flavor. I love biscotti and have made other recipes, but this just doesn't compare. For starters, they were too small - I like the longer biscotti. I followed the instructions to a "T" and have to agree that they must cool longer before cutting to avoid crumbling. However, I didn't think these were anything special and my husband agreed. I won't make them again.

I haven't made this yet, but one VERY similar offered on The Food Network by Giada De Laurentiss of Everyday Italian (except she used a whole stick of butter and no aniseed, which is fine with me, as I don't care for the flavor of anis). I think on their website, you can watch the video of her making it. If not, then they're repeating so many of the holiday episodes, it won't be hard to catch it. Two things I did notice while watching her make it...#1 was when she formed the log, she did wet her hands to help handle and smooth the dough and #2, when scraping the dough out of the bowl, it wasn't all that sticky. Even when I prepared it, I got the same result. The dough was not very sticky and easy to handle. She didn't chop the cranberries and pistachios, which I think it a great idea. I've made her's before, and that was the only problem, were the big chunks of pistachios to cut through that would make some of the biscotti break when cutting. But this is a delicious biscotti and so beautiful. The suggestion to sit the biscotti upright to keep the pistachios green is a GREAT idea. For those who don't like dipping in chocolate (I did), filling a pastry bag fitted with a small, round tip and drizzling the chocolate on them is easier...you can even use a ziploc baggie with the end snipped off it you don't have the pastry bag. Being a baker at heart, I have my fishing tackle box that's full of cake decorating equipment with dozens of bags and literally hundreds of different tips. I also used red and green decorating sugar to lightly dust the ends of the wet white chocolate just for that extra festive holiday touch, as specified in Giada's recipe. As I said, they're almost EXACTLY the same. I can't imagine anyone who doesn't love biscotti not rating this one as their favorite. It's excellent.

These turned out sooo good. I wish I would have doubled the recipe. This recipe will definitely be going into my Tastebook! I made the following changes to the recipe: I chopped the cranberries and pistachios as suggested. I substituted orange zest for the lemon zest because that is what I had on hand. I baked for 30 minutes and cooled for 20 minutes before cutting. I had minimal crumbling. Also used an egg white wash as some suggested but it really isn't necessary. I did not dip in white chocolate.

This is one of the best biscotti I have ever tasted. I don't usually make cookies with dried fruit because my family is very picky, but this cookie won them over. It actually reminds me of the Cranberry Bliss bar that Starbucks offers this time of year. I will be entering it in our annual cookie exchange. If this cookie doesn't win hands down, I'll be shocked. Just a note, I chopped both the cranberries and the pistachios like a few other people suggested.

These biscotti are wonderful, even though I omitted the aniseed (not in my pantry). Something I learned from another biscotti recipe is when turning out onto your work surface, use confectioner sugar rather than flour. I tried dipping in white chocolate, and some liked it others did not. I will make these again, after I buy some aniseed; they will probably be a staple in my holiday baking from now on.

If you make the recipe as written, it makes mini biscotti- not the long and lean ones. Next time I'll chop the cranberries as they created difficulty in chopping the biscotti into pieces. Be careful to let the logs cook through the middle before slicing. I'd make again and would guess they'll be prettier!

I have been making these since the recipe was first printed and they are always a big hit. My biggest problem is my own attemp to refrain from gobbling them up before my guests have a chance to savor them. Since I am not a fan of white chocolate, I simply leave that off and they are sweet but not too sweet and moist and perfect with a steaming cup of Earl Grey.

I have made several biscotti recipes recently because my mother loves them. She declared this to be her favorite batch and in her words said, "Don't try any new recipes! These are the best." Following others' suggestions I chopped the cranberries and pistachios before putting them into the batter. I also cooled them overnight after the first baking and sliced with a pizza cutter and had no problems with them breaking. Overall I think these are great and have a lot of depth and flavor. The only tweaks I made to them was to substitute orange zest for lemon and to brush them lightly with an egg white wash before the first baking. Delicious

I admittedly have not made this recipe recently until earlier today when I made them for a church card party with a Christmas theme. I read many of the reviews to refresh my memory of these wonderful biscotti even though I knew that everytime I made them they were a big hit. I have been making biscotti of all sorts for a very, very, very long time and have learned a few things that might be helpful to first time biscotti bakers: I use an egg white wash brushed over the biscotti just before putting them in the oven. The wash gives them a nice sheen without affecting taste or texture. Simply beat one egg white until foamy and brush onto logs. With this type of sticky dough that can make new bakers nervous I very lightly flour one hand and then clap both hands together so there is a light coating of flour that makes handling the dough much easier. I let the logs cool completely before I even think of cutting them into individual cookies. I have let the sit anywhere from one hour to several hours and slicing goes easier. Today, because I was baking other biscotti at 350 I forgot to lower the oven until moments before the timer went off. This meant that they baked at 350 for 28 minutes and came out fine. I would not recommend making a habit of this because there is a purpose to specific oven temps so I was lucky it worked out for me today. I do not dip in white chocolate although I have been known to line up all the cut biscotti after the second baking and drizzle melted chocolate over the top because it gives it just a hint of chocolate. Chopped pistaschio are readily found in Shop- Rite supermarkets in NJ

I make this recipe about once a month. I use macadamia nuts instead of the pistachios. I use a food processor to mix the ingredients and add the nuts and cranberries for the last couple of pulses...that seems to solve the problem of large chunks when cutting the logs. I have also found, through trial and error, that my Chinese cleaver works best for cutting the biscotti. A firm downward motion, no sawing, creates the best cut. I have no problems whatsoever with the recipe.

The biscotti are really good but too sweet for me. I think the cranberries made it sweet. Also because of the cranberries, the biscotti kept falling apart. Next time I would reduce the amt of cranberries. Would love to try it again.

Great recipe, great gift, great compliments! I made them 3 times now. Notes: roughly chop the pistachios and the cranberries, so they won't give you a hard time when you start cutting the logs, the surface should be smooth. Trader Joe has Orange flavored cranberries that gives it an extra punch. The dough does not change shape or size while baking, so make sure you give it the form you like. I flatten the log to a little less than one inch high in the middle and flatten it more on both sides. I cut the logs with my electric knife, that really makes it much easier! Use high quality European chocolate, it melts better and thinner. I keep the bowl with chocolate in the pan with almost boiling water, otherwise the chocolate starts getting thick and makes the dipping difficult. I cool the bakingsheet, so the chocolate dipped biscotti's cool fast. When you use salted pistachio's make sure adjust the amount salt. Ciao!

I wish they had a maybe for "Will you make this dish again?" The first time I made them was a dismal failure, and I am not an amateur cook. They tasted uber-fantastic, but crumbled when I cut them. After reviewing the reviews, for the second batch I: chopped up the cranberries and pistachios, baked the logs longer (about 35 minutes), and allowed them to cool a very long time. Especially the chopping seemed to help because with such small biscotti and such huge hunks of fruit and nuts, they just couldn't hold together. After all of that, I'm not sure I'll attempt them again, and that's saying something because I don't shy away from a challenge in the kitchen. The flavor is to die for, so maybe I'll brave it again next year after the nightmares have stopped.

making more today and wanted to add to the cook from portland, i stand the biscotti upright during the final baking and the pistachios stay green...also, i did two loaves, 2" x 12" at 350 for 30 min, and then back in for 10 min standing upright. i just found that making the loaves 2 inches was a better size...and a full stick of butter.

I made this for our street cookie exchange. It won hands down for best cookie this season. I would also recommend chopping the pistachios as well. Made it much easier for cutting. Definately worth a try! Happy holidays!

these are delish and buttery. with the help of fellow reviewers, i was a biscotti-makin' pro. help #1 handle the dough with wet hands. #2 REALLY make sure the top is smooth (wet hands help), it helps prevent the crumbling when cutting.

These turned out perfectly and are very good - they are the first biscotti recipe that I have had turn out looking like biscotti! I did chop the pistachios so they would be easier to cut and rather than dipping one end in chocolate, I coated the bottom of the biscotti in chocolate so that you get a bit of chocolate with each bite of biscotti. I will make these every Christmas - quite impressive!!

This was really a wonderful and delicious recipe. I made for our office today and they were immediately devoured. I especially enjoy them with a cup of tea. I followed the directions exactly and they were perfect!

As other reviewers have mentioned, these are good for a holiday platter. Few other ingredients could naturally give you red, white and green. I'm not a big fan of white chocolate since it is super sweet, is very messy, and does not harden like real chocolate. It certainly caused problems when I tried putting these in an assortment of biscotti for gift boxes. I had to wrap them in wax paper to keep the white stuff from getting everywhere. In any case, these are sweeter and chewier than a traditional biscotti, and I found them just ok.

Rating: 3
These are a nice addition to a holiday cookie platter. If you have trouble with biscotti crumbling while slicing for the second bake, brush with water about 5 min. before slicing. I sometimes chop my white chocolate and add it to the batter rather than dipping the baked biscotti.

Good recipe, very impressive to take to a holiday. I just had some trouble (I think I undercooked the logs), even after I had let them cool for 15 minutes, they crumbled when I tried to slice them. I salvaged about 1 1/2 dozen, and they were great. I would also buy more white chocolate for the dipping. Next time, I'll make the logs skinnier and cook them a bit longer.

Rating: 4
This recipe is great. The cranberries are chewy and the biscotti crunchy. Great textures going on. I would recommend cooking it in one big log instead of separating into two. I just prefer my biscottis larger. Also, make sure the log is smooth on top before you bake it, this makes it easier to cut without it crumbling apart.

Rating: 3
These were easy to make. I did find it difficult to cut the loaves after the first baking - the pistachios would fall out of the cut pieces. So, next time I would chop the pistachios before mixing into the dough. Also - my first baked loaves did not look nice - there was CONSIDERABLE spread.

I made these twice over the holidays and am revising my earlier comments. Becuase they are holiday biscotti I have decided that the white chocolate is what makes them special and it has to stay. The combination of white chocolate, pistachio and cranberry is festive and makes them eyepopping. I used them as gifts and mixed them in with a holiday cookie platter I took to a party. A big hit.

yum! my pistachios stayed green, but i couldn't find any shelled, unsalted nuts, so it took me over an HOUR to take a cup and half of nuts (i doubled he recipe) out of the shell. it was a little crumbly and difficult to cut at first, maybe i should have let it cool more. i also burnt my chocolate at 1 am, so omitted that and it was still great!

I would make this again without the white chocolate. The white chocolate seems to be an overload and an unnecessary heavy gaudy accessory that weighs down the other ingrediants. Sometimes less is more. These biscotti need no adornment.

First time I made this, I substituted Splenda for the sugar and the dough did not come out sticky. In fact, it was crumbly and would not hold together at all. I added lemon juice from one lemon and this improved the consistency. However after cooking for the appropriate time, the logs did not spread much at all and they were far too crumbly. I ended up with only 18 small biscotti, although they did taste good. The second time, I did not substitute at all and made sure the butter was at room temp. I did add a bit of lemon juice as I liked the added lemon flavor. This time the dough was very sticky, so I made shortened logs and flattened them out a bit. Cooked for about 35 minutes, the dough spread nicely, let cool for 15 mins and sliced with almost no crumbling. I did slice diagonally to get longer cookies. Baked them again upright for about 25 minutes. This time they came out perfect and beautiful with drizzled white chocolate. Dee-lish!

Hmm, my experience is completely different than others. I found the dough not only difficult to work with but the result completely dull. And they don't look HALF so pretty as in the picture! I did cut the sugar considerably, but can't think that was the difference since so many others said they used fresh cranberries and I used dried.

These are delicious, easy and very pretty as gifts for the holidays. In all honesty I skipped the white chocolate step as I packaged these with other biscotti from Epicurious and the "trio of truffles" also here- thought that enough was enough. Everyone loved the gifts. The best biscotti of the three that I made, however, are the anise-almond ones, also on this site. They are the real, classic biscotti that just trump everything else, in my opinion. It was a good idea to offer variety in the gift packs.

Made with sliced almonds, fresh cranberries, and coated the top with turbinado sugar. Could use more anise seed. I cooked for almost 45 minutes and they were still crumbly. We usually make the biscotti from the Tra Vigne cookbook. Those are beyond compare. These were a nice change for the holidays though.

These are divine. They look gorgeous too. I took one reviewer's advice and sliced them on the diagonal. I got about 30 cookies, not 3 1/2 dozen. You really could get away without doing the white chocolate part at all. Since it's Christmas and I'm bringing them to a nice dinner, I think I will though. I used Trader Joe's orange flavored dried cranberries. Very nice.

Terrific biscotti recipe; definitely a do-over! Slice on the diagonal and drizzle with chocolate for the "bakery look." I made a double batch and froze half of it after the first baking. After defrosting I sliced, baked and drizzled and had it on the table in no time.

Wonderful flavor and festive looking for Christmas. I would coarsely chop the pistachios and cranberries to ease in slicing. Also, cutting the log on a diagional gives a more elegant presentation.

Yummy! Beautiful biscotti. And this was the first biscotti recipe that I ever made. I made the recipe as instructed and found the dough VERY sticky. I formed it into logs as stated, but I smoothed it out with wet hands and it worked well. I did not have parchment paper to used, so I buttered the cookie sheet and had no problems. I would use a bit more anise seed, but I thought that lemon zest was perfect. You have a lot of flavors...lemon, vanillia, pistachios, cranberries, and I would rather taste the medley of flavors that combine to become somewhat sublime, rather than one individual flavor most strongly. I would strongly recommend making these!!

Rating: 2
Was excited to try this recipe after reading all the reviews. Maybe I should have read the reviews more closely when they said that the lemon and aniseed flavors were too mild. I did increase the amount on both ingredients but still lacked the depth of flavors. Took much longer to cook than stated (I believe almost for another 15-20 minutes for me!). Cooled for 20 minutes before cutting so no problem with crumbling. As for forming the logs, the dough was very sticky so I just scooped the dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and formed it into a log with the spoon. Flavor-wise, I would increase the aniseed and likely add alittle ground aniseed. And definitely up the lemon zest!

This is a wonderful recipe. I get rave reviews about this and have been asked for the recipe by almost all who have tried this. I add a little extra lemon zest and aniseed (just personal taste). Very easy, time saver: place cookies so standing up when cooking the 2nd time and cook for 15 minutes, thus avoiding the 3rd baking.

Rating: 4
This recipe is really good and easy. I substituted chopped fresh cranberries. I bumped up the sugar a bit to counteract any bitterness, and they worked fine. The easiest way to get the logs on the cookie sheet is to roll them right there on a sheet of parchment paper. No need for a floured surface, and no need to transfer a floppy log of dough! I used a Global chef's knife to cut the log. Crumbling was minimal, even though I had to cut the log before it cooled because my boyfriend was hovering over it with a glass of cold milk and Bad Intent in his eyes.

I made these and the double chocolate walnut biscotti. Liked the chocolate ones better. These are good in that they are not rock hard. I actually thought I had under cooked them but they turned out fine. It's a good recipe and maybe if I had used the white chocolate it would have been a great recipe.

Rating: 4
I brought these back to Texas from a New Jersey bakery a few months ago and have been dreaming about them ever since. This recipe is outstanding. One substitution (don't call the biscotti police) but I did not have the aniseed on hand and used 1/8 tsp. of allspice instead. I'm not a big fan of anise flavoring anyway and the allspice, combined with the lemon peel was deliciously aromatic. Every time I took the lid off the cookie tin I was greeted with the most wondrous nose hit. Skip the white chocolate; these are perfection without that heavy goo. Have one or two--or ten--with a strong cup of Italian roast.

Rating: 3
I didn't do the chocolate, just because I didn't have any and didn't want to bother. Now that I've tasted them, I think it'd be overkill! These are very good. Thanks to the cooks who suggested using the chefs knife--it really did work better for slicing. I'll definitely make again, and the only change will be to increase the lemon and the anise seed (also previously mentioned), as those flavors don't quite shine the way I'd hoped. Very, very good.

This is the second time I've made this recipe-it's fantastic. I slightly increased the lemon zest and anise seed both times, as I liked a little stronger flavor. I accidentally used salted pistachios the first time; rinsed them before adding them, but still should have cut the salt back, as I'd also used salted butter. The second time I substituted toasted pine nuts, as that's what I had on hand. As most of the rest of you, I changed the cooking times (35 minutes, then 11 minutes standing on side after cooling completelly and cutting into slices). I flattened the logs with my hands and cut on the diagonal, for a little larger cookie. Excellent!

Very yummy. I find they crumble less with a chef's knife rather than a serrated. Also, to save yourself the flipping at the end - - just stand the biscotti up, both sides cook at once and they come out exactly the same.

I made these for a post holiday party last night. I used regular butter (with salt) and salted pistachios so I left out the added salt from the recipe.

I've been making a version of this recipe for years. It's called Christmas Cantuccini and it's this recipe sans the lemon zest, chocolate and aniseed. I've tried both recipes and I prefer the less complicated one. About the unroasted, natural pistachios, it says, " To maintain thee brilliant green colour of the pistachios through the two stages of baking, it is important to begin with unroasted pistachios, which have a more intense flavor and colour." I've found these very easily at any Middle Eastern shop. Lebanese shops always have them. Here on the Isle of Wight, I can find them at Easy Weigh and at health food stores.

These are fabulous; my friends at work loved them! And to the cook from CT, yes, it just means not the red-dyed pistachios. And as far as you not being able to find them other than with the shell on, it just means that YOU take them out of the shell before using. Again, these biscotti are great

You can get the pistachios at Trader Joes' if there is one in your area.

To Connecticut: I think by "natural", they simply mean "un-dyed", not nessecarily "un-roasted" or raw. I'm sure you'll have no problem finding un-dyed, un-salted nuts. Any gourmet market probably has barrels full. Good luck.

Excellent biscotti, not too hard, not too dry, not too large, what can I say just perfect. Luckily I was able to find a jar of shelled pistachios. Made for a cookie exchange. I did have several that broke apart, but I think if they break apart on slicing for the 2nd bake, perhaps they cooked too long. Excellent biscotti recipe. Pretty and colorful.

This is the first biscotti recipe I have ever attempted. Very easy, and just great! I've made this twice, and the second time I let the logs cool completely before slicing-it worked perfectly, very little crumbling. Also, for those that like a nice, crunchy biscotti, bake the slices for an extra five minutes on each side, and they will be perfect. I did not use the white chocolate either time, and I really don't think you need it, unless you want to dress these up as a gift or for a cookie table.

I've tried many different biscotti recipes and this one is terrific! Easy to make and delicious! My family is usually extremely picky about everything, but this they liked.

Definitely will make again next year. Great for breakfast!

Delicious! Will definitely make it BEFORE Christmas next year to share. Omitted the anise and the white "chocolate." Might drizzle with lemon/powdered sugar glaze to dress them up a bit for Christmas gifts. I made one log and patted it out on a floured flexible cutting mat that happened to be 15 in. long. I put the parchment paper and overturned baking sheet on top of the log and flipped it over. The mat peeled right off. Everyone around our house really enjoyed these - even the teenagers. And especially my best biscotti- loving friend who broke her South Beach diet to try them - I'm still hearing about that!

These biscotti were a fantastic hit at my holiday party. I served them warm after the holiday parade. To answer the English Cook's questions, all purpose would equate to plain, a stick of butter is 1/4 of a pound or .25 of 454g (113.5g) and a Silpat is a resusable cookie sheet liner.

Very nice biscotti. Made these as part of Christmas presents. Looked lovely with the red cranberries, lovely tart flavour also. Didn't dip in chocolate as I thought they were lovely as is.

This is one of the best biscotti cookies I have ever tasted. It was easy to follow. I will definitely make it again. I did find it somewhat crubbled when I cut it mostly in the middle of the log. I think I just need to push the dough together until it is more firm like the ends. It really doesn't need the white chocolate but its a nice touch especially for a Christmas gift.

This was the first time that I had made biscotti so I can tell this is a timing and experience type of dish. I made just one big log and used a baking stone and baked it about 4 minutes longer. I used an electric knife to cut the biscotti and had to wash off the blades as I was getting close to the center of the log. Next time I will make 2 logs (as it reads) and flatten the logs a bit by hand as well. They do fall flat on their own so there if little shaping that has to take place. The taste was very good and I agree to skip the (ugh) white chocolate. I struggled to temper the chocolate to the right consistency for dipping and I had about 45 seconds that is was just right. I will add this to the holiday tins next year. I liked the idea of adding Sambuca, but I think I would go for anise seed oil (1/8tsp) instead. I purchased shelled salted pistachios and crushed them a bit with a mallet as well. Yeah I had the same conclusion as most do after making this dish. Why pay for day old biscotti at Starbucks ever again?

I gave these biscotti as Christmas gifts and served them alongside tea when visitors popped in over the holidays, and was told repeatedly that they were the best biscotti people had ever eaten. The combination of anise, lemon, pistachio and dried cranberries is irresitible. I did have crumbling issues when I cut the logs so I'll try some of the previously posted suggestions to try and eliminate that.

Rating: 3
I have made many biscotti recipes, and this one is a keeper! The lemon zest and the aniseed give it a very nice tang that my other cranberry-pistachio recipe did not have. This is the perfect combo. I modeled the baking time on my favorite recipe by baking the logs longer, until slightly browned rather than still pale, and by doing this I had no crumbling at all when I cut them. Then I put back the biscottis standing up on the rack and only baked them for another 10 minutes, that's it. It gives them a firm consistency without being rock hard, just like my husband prefers them! Everybody loved them. I will definitely be making this again!

I've made this recipe twice. I don't know how many cookies I ended up with the first time, but the second time only one dozen, not three and a half. I must have sliced them pretty thick. I did have a problem with crumbling, so next time I'll try letting the logs cool completely before slicing. Also, I think dipping one end in white chocolate is unneccesary, way too sweet. Maybe a pretty squigle of chocolate would be pretty and not as over powering. I did use whole anise seed as the recipe called for, and it lended a nice subtle flavor. This is a great biscotti recipe, will definetly make again.

I've made this biscotti twice this holiday season, and received rave reviews from all of the recipients! The first time I followed the recipe as written, with the only exception of excluding the aniseed. The taste was wonderful, but the biscotti logs crumbled when I tried to slice them. The second time around, adjusted the baking time to 35 minutes, and let the logs cool completely before cutting...very key, as I was able to slice with minimal crumbling. This is definitely a keeper!!!

Great recipe. These are very easy to make, so don't let the lengthy instructions deter you. This is another perfect time to use a silpat--the most brilliant invention ever.

Having the benefit of previous bakers, I substituted 1T Sambucca for the anise and used dried cherries, as I didn't have the cranberries. I also left off the white chocolate, because I believe it's a crime against nature. And the results were still just wonderful. And you're all right - this is a really easy recipe.

I confess I haven't made this recipe. The reviews of it however will send me to the kitchen once I recover from all the holiday celebrations. When I learned to make biscotti, I was told to leave the biscotti several hours up to overnite to cool before cutting and baking a second time. I have found this to be very good advice, saving much angst re crumbling. Then when slicing for baking, I don't saw, I just proceed to push the knife through. One trick I have noticed is the choice of knife. If I choose one too thick it crumbles and if I choose one too thin, it is a waste of time. Hope this is helpful to someone else. Happy tasting all. This sounds delicious!

Incredible, Epicurious.

A perfect balance of texture and flavor, as well as pretty presentation. I agree with the tips about altering baking times, both on the initial "whole logs" and post-sliced ends, to prevent crumbling and over-browning, respectively. My only problem was that even though I followed the recipe exactly, my biscotti came out on the small side, i.e. almost half size of a normal biscotti - any suggestions?

Rating: 4
OUTSTANDING is the only way to describe these little gems. It took a bit of effort to get my beautifully shaped logs onto the baking sheet but other than that they were perfect. Definitely agree with others that a minimum of 35 minutes cooking time is a MUST before taking them out of the oven. I allowed them to cool about 30 minutes and they sliced evenly and easily. Four minutes per side was ample when putting them back in the oven. The only deviation from the recipe was that I used a 1/4 cup of Sambuca in place of the anise seed. Nice mellow flavor so I added a 1/4 cup to the chef as well!

Oh, mercy! These are awesome! The batter was delicious, too! YUM! Easy to make, as well. Be sure to let the logs cool very well...mine took longer than the recipe stated to cool...noticed, of course, that when they were too hot, they crumbled when I tried to cut them. Excellent!

Rating: 4
This was great, except you need to bake it at least five minutes longer, and if you cool it an hour before slicing there is less breakage. Also flatten out the rolled logs and you get a better shape. I substituted dry cherries and next time would chop them smaller. A winner and really easy!

These are yummy and not too difficult to make. Very mellow flavors. I had to spread the chocolate as mine (block chocolate purchased from a local store) was not runny enough to allow dipping. I am making another batch tonight because I only got about 2 dozen (not the 3 1/2 stated in the recipe) from the first batch.

This was my first time at making biscotti, and they turned out great! I took the advice of the other reviewers, and I baked them initially for 35 minutes (not 28 min.). After cutting (which I had no problems with), I baked them for 4-5 minutes on each side (not the 9 minutes). To Peggy: I would try baking them longer initially. Mine were golden brown on top when I took the logs out. Then, I let them cool longer than 10 minutes. I also didn't use a sawing motion all the way down. I just sawed enough to get a cut and then I just cut straight down. I gave the biscotti as gifts, and they looked beautiful in cellaphane bags. Will definitely make more often than just once a year!!!

I loved the flavor & followed the directions exactly as written...however, when I cut them they all crumbled. I would like to make them again, but I need help as to what I did wrong.

This recipe was easy to make. The results were excellent. I used a 4 oz. white Ghiradelli baking bar. I would use more next time to get the same results as the picture, lush with white chocolate. I had to lengthen the baking time. I will probably make these for my husband for a special treat every holiday.

these are terrific! I used half lemon zest and half orange zest because I didn't have enough lemons, and the result was great. I also skipped dipping them in chocolate, because I prefer them plain.

I made this recipe with the two eggs called for, but my batter turned out to be just crumbs! The eggs I was using looked small, so I added one more and it seemed to do the trick. So, I guess you should take the size of the eggs you are using into consideration when you are bakng. They turned out great with the three eggs - and they look beautiful too!

Serve the bicotti with a traditional glass of Italian limoncello. To die for!!

Not knowing how to get my question answered, I'm writing it here. Has anyone not used the aniseed in this recipe... if so how did it turn out? Thanks.

Theses are by far some of the best biscotti I've ever baked - I absolutely love the cranberry and pistachio combo! These have made my "A" list for holiday cookies!

This was awesome. My husband come up with the idea of double dipping it. Once in white choclate, and once in dark. They looked beautiful and tasted as good.

Wonderful alternative to a holiday cookie. They have a wonderful taste. I spread the white chocolate on one entire side of the cookie. They look great. I too would bake a little longer next time, but not the 8 minutes on each side after they are sliced. They got a little brown. I would probably decrease the time to 4 minutes. These will now go down in my annual cookies collection baking day!

I would make this again but with the follwoing adjustments.... Bake for 45 minutes and let the logs cool compeletely before slicing. 28 minutes is not sufficient to bake these and they crumble while slicing because they are not completely bakes and too hot. If the dough I scraped from the bowl is an indication, these taste great!

These taste great. However, the dough is VERY dry and they are VERY crumbly when cutting so there is a lot of waste. Any suggestions?

I made these for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved them - HUGE success and very easy to make. I highly recommend this recipe. I had a little trouble with the white chocolate, but probably because I ignored the advice to use imported. I whisked in a little cream to smooth it out and they turned out just fine.

I love these! The colors are festive, and the flavors are wonderful. The anise flavor is reminiscent of the holiday pizelles my friend's mother made every year. I made one log instead of two, so the biscotti would be long and elegant, more like the ones I buy at coffee houses. Also, I drizzed the white chocolate on top instead of dipping.
