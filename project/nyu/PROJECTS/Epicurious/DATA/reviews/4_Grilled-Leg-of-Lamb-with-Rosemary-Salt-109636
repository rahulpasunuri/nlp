Made this a few months ago w/a leg of lamb from the farmer's market. Had never fixed a leg of lamb, but this turned out beautifully and oh so tasty. Agree that the rosemary salt made it incredible. I'm not a huge lamb fan, but this will please even no-so-big lamb people. Really easy (and simple) to do--marinade, then skewer and throw on the grill. Contemplating it for Christmas dinner.

I have cooked this and variations of this dish many times now. It is my fiancees favorite thing that I cook (besides my salmon dip). He requests it for birthdays, holidays and other special occasions all the time. I would recommend it to anyone. Little tip (the lamb will absorb the yogurt marinade in no time so if you don't have 5 hours don't sweat it).

As a result of reading the positive reviews I tried this for the first time at a dinner party...everyone loved it. Followed the recipe closely, but did not use the skewers...cut the butterflied leg into three pieces and grilled them on a gas grill at high heat for 10 minutes a side. Turned out great!

This was amazing. I only had a lamb shoulder so I adjusted the ingredients for a smaller portion and it was delish! The marinade is simple and delicious and the rosemary salt is the perfect finish. I don't even care for lamb but I would eat it prepared like this. This will be one to use for company.

This dish is awesome! I splurged on the salt -- some pink riverbed salt from Australia. It was worth it. My guests and I metered it out like it was cocaine. I didn't skewer the butterflied leg because there is something so fun about throwing that thing around on the grill.

Really great. We let the lamb go on the grill for a little too long and it was still moist and delicious. Am making it again tonight for a big BBQ. I'm not sure I would make the rosemary salt again, I don't know that it added a lot for me.

Simply delicious! I serve it sometimes just with grilled pita bread and tzatziki, what a great light tasty dinner.

Love this recipe. We've made it 3-4 times and I'm adopting the marinade for a bone-in leg of lamb for Christmas dinner.

Everyone I serve this meal too, totally enjoys it!!! The left overs make great sandwhiches the next day on cruncy sourdough rolls. Most of the time, I have no leftovers...There was once a fight to take home the leftovers. Of course my parents prevailed. In fact they came to our house, having already ate dinner, but could not resist a second meal that night. Good thing I had plenty of food.

Excellent fare.

The rosemary/flake salt finish adds an amazing new taste. Don't know exactly what the yogurt did, but the lamb was ab fab. Next time I'll get the butcher to do the butterflying, however.

Can I say WOW?? This is fantastic and very easy. I used nonfat plain yogurt instead of whole milk yogurt and added fresh mint to the marinade. Also, used lamb sirloin cut instead of leg of lamb. I served with it a yogurt dipping sauce with the non-fat plain yogurt, rosemary, mint, pepper, sea salt, and a quick dash of garlic salt. I made this about the same time as I set the meat to marinate, so it sat in the fridge for about 3 hours. I let it come up to room temperature before serving. Amazing flavors!

You should know that I prefer to eat vegetarian, but for my mother's birthday I did a five-course meal featuring this lamb. I had seconds and I almost never eat meat.

This was great. I didnt have alot of time to make a marinade and this was quick and easy and I thought that this went really well with the leg of lamb. I added juice from one lemon, and put the leg of lamb on my charcoal rotisserie! YUM!

This was great. Hard to tell whether its primarily the grilling that made it so tasty or the marinade, but the combo was marvellous..i let marinade on the counter for only about 2 hours, but the meat was delicious and very tender. The rosemary salt (I used a pre-made version from eatwell farms) sprinkled on top of slices before serving adds a lot in terms of attractiveness and taste.

Much quicker and easier than other marinades, PERFECT results even though we had to use an electric grill. Both my husband and my daughter were amazed at how much they LOVED it, even though I've never made lamb they didn't like before. Still talking about it days later, GREAT RECIPE!!!!

Wow! This dish is amazingly easy and equally tasty. I will most certainly be making lamb this way again. Marinating for a variable period of time greater than 5hrs does not impact the recipe adversely, instead lends flexibility to an uncertain mealtime.

THis was the best tasting lamb I have ever had! I will use this every time I make lamb in the future. I did do a few things differently: First I didn't have fresh rosemary SO I substituted fresh Lemon Thyme instead -wounderful- 2nd, I marinated the Lamb over night. I was getting ready for a dinner party so did the marinade late the evening before the lamb was in the marinade for aproximately 12 hours! Also I sliced a few more cloves of garlic than called for. This was was WOUNDERFUL!
