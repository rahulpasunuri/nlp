This cake is awesome! It's so good...I can't stop eating it. I used pecans and Granny Smith apples because that's what I had on hand and I may have used slightly more than 2 lbs of apples...but the cake turned out absolutely delicious regardless. I will definitely make this again. I think it would be great with cream cheese frosting (not sweet) or with plain vanilla ice cream.

I've made this a number of times for dinner parties. It's one of my favorite recipes. I use whatever apples I have on hand and chop rather than grate them. Pecans are good too instead of walnuts but either way it's yummy. We serve it with a homemade vanilla caramel sauce from another recipe on this site and it's a hit every time.

Made this many times-a great family recipe!

No way is this cake bread-like. It is very moist. Try sifting the flour. I used 6 Gala apples (too much at 2 1/4 lbs.) that were chopped too fine in a processor and the cake was a bit saturated. Next time I will use five, chopped larger.

This was good, but seemed like a better candidate for an "Apple Walnut Loaf Bread" or "Apple Walnut Muffin" rather than a sheet cake. I actually frosted mine with a cream cheese frosting -- but I really might make it again as a muffin instead. It was a little denser than I'd hope for a cake...

Nice snack-type cake. I used 5 largish apples, and it didn't take as long to bake as stated. Served with "real" caramel sauce made with carmelized sugar and heavy cream. Cake without sauce makes a good breakfast cake.

Delicious cake, very moist and easy to make. I've made it twice and used 1 scant cup each of white and light brown sugar, 5 cups of apples. Don't know if that adds up to 2 lbs but it turned out delicious. Great recipe for the apples I buy from my farmer's market.

Great family dessert. I used one cup of sugar and one cup of brown sugar and baked it for 45 minutes. It was delicious.

Great casual cake! I made it for a crowd and they were all raving about it.
