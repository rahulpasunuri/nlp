This is a great recipe and it is worth using a better quality chocolate because the difference is a "to die for" taste or a good brownie taste.

I don't have a go-to brownie recipe so I am always trying different ones. These brownies were great, the consistency was not too fudgy and not too cake-like. I substituted a dark bittersweet chocolate for the unsweetened chocolate and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup plus used dark chocolate instead of white chocolate. I found it took longer to bake, maybe 5 minutes even but they were not overdone. Beating the eggs was not much extra effort. I am making these again tonight and if they work out well again I may have found my brownie recipe!

Made this for a church function and everyone loved them. Among a few different kinds of desserts, these and the other ones I made got the most attention.

I baked up a batch of these brownies and took them to work. Got some rave reviews and some praises out of politeness. Personally, I like them. But I don't think that this recipe is stunningly good, particularly as it takes more effort than other recipes by requiring you to beat the eggs till thick.

I make these all the time-it's my signature recipe. I use white chocolate chips so the size is consistent. I always get so many compliments on these. If I bring them somewhere they are always the first thing to get gobbled up! Everyone always asks me for the recipe of these bad boys.

Nice brownie, Used Scharffenberger unsweetened chocolate and Lindt white. Qualty ingredients make all the differnece between ordinary and good. Made exactly as written, not too sweet and done in exactly 28 minutes. Will put these into my brownie rotation. I have abt 30 recipes in my collection, all just a little different. Some are incredible. These are good enough to join the group, but not the most outstanding of the bunch.

I have made many brownie recipes and this is by far the best. My three grandchildren say it is their favorite, also.

These were fantastic. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the white chocolate!! Also used cocoa powder because I didn't have unsweetened chocolate, worked great!!

I made this recipe twice once according to the recipe and it was slightly bitter and not quite satisfying so I tried using bittersweet chocolate and they were just as bad. I won't make this again but you can try i hope you have better luck than I did

This isn't my absolute favorite brownie recipe, but it is easy and crowd-pleasing. The brownies are very moist, and they aren't too fudgy or too cakey. I think the white chocolate makes them a little too sweet, personally, so I might cut down on the sugar a bit next time.

These make the best brownies! The white chocolate chunks and dark chocolate batter make for a very rich, decadent dessert. I usually skip the cooling down period, and serve them when they're warm with ice cream! Yummm

This is one of the best brownies I have ever made - it's fudgy, rich and not too sweet, altho I did cut down the sugar a bit. I prefer it without the white chocolate as the flavor gets a bit lost in the intense chocolate of the brownie.

I made these last night and they turned out great. I substituted hersheys dark choc chips for the white chocolate. everything else i followed the same, i forgot to use unsalted butter so used regular instead...still turned out good. they were easy to make and delicious.

Excellent brownies! I cooked them for 25 minutes only and they were perfect! I have made them before and cooked for the full 28 minutes and thought they were a little dry. Will definitely make again.

I made these for my boyfriend and he loved them so much he hid them from his roommate. Needless to say, I saved a few for myself. I am new to baking and thought the process was a bit labor intensive, melting the chocolate in a double boiler, etc....but they were so delicious. Followed the recipe exactly.

I made this recipe with a few healthier alterations....I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of normal all-pupose flour. I also used turbanado sugar instead of white sugar and added a touch of honey. I left out the white chocolate chunks, but next time I think I'll make the recipe with dark chocolate chunks. I used dark chocolate, but added some raw chocolate nibs, which gave it a little crunch (only for the true dark chocolate lovers). I left all the measurements the same. It was a great recipe and the brownies are irresistable.

My family and friends couldn't get enough of these brownies -- so much so, that I ended up making several pans over the holidays. A new favorite - my family requested them again last night. I just used white chocolate chips,and they turned out great (I didn't expect them to melt and they didn't -- what would be the point??). I also stored them, as I do all brownies, tightly wrapped in the refrigerator. Like many other brownies, they are more "fudge-like" when eaten while still cold. Those who like theirs more "cake-like" let them come to room temperature.

My husband and I are both wild about chocolate and we LOVED these brownies. The only change I made in the recipe was the addition of a little extra flour since we live at high altitude. Yummy!

Everyone loves these brownies - especially when I make them in miniature muffin tins. The only drawback is that they lose their moistness the day after baking.

They were good but not great. I guess I like brownies with nuts better.

I thought these brownies were wonderful and was surprised at the mixed reviews. I followed the recipe exactly (for a change) and they taste good, cut perfectly, neither too moist nor too dry. The only thing, they took quite a bit longer than 28 mins, probably about 38 which is pretty long but like any other brownie recipe, I was checking it from 20 mins. This is my new brownie recipe for sure.

My husband and I loved these fabulous brownies! I used Baker's chocolate (you don't have to use the very expensive chocolate for these to turn out great) and a package of Baker's white chocolate chunks -- and they turned out heavenly.

I made two batches of these in one weekend, and they were fabulous. The second time i added some frozen raspberries with a little extra sugar and that was lovely. With vanilla ice cream and hot fudge sauce it makes a truly decadent dessert.

Our afternoon snack was a success! The guests loved the brownies. A very easy recipe, chunks of white chocolate were a hit.

I made this for Valentine's Day using excellent chocolate;however,I have made better brownies. I think the white chocolate chunks were too much of a texture contrast in the cooled brownies which is how I served them. They were cute for V. Day as I cut out heart shapes and leaned them against a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. I drizzled raspberry sauce on the plate and dusted the whole thing with powered sugar. But next time I will use an old standby for the brownies.

Ihave made this recipe four times since I first found it in Aug 2000. One word - amazing. I used Scharffenberger chocolate for the white and the unsweetened, and I get rave reviews. The texture is perfect - not too dry , but it's not gooey at all. The sweetness is balanced. I would recommend doubling the recipe - they go really fast!

Mmmmmm. These brownies were really moist and chocolaty, and more than sweet enough (for the record, I used Baker's unsweetened chocolate and followed all instructions exactly). I might substitute walnuts for half the white chocolate chunks next time.

Rating: 4
I made it for friends and had saved some for co-workers. No less than 8 people asked for the recipe. Quite a winner! I see other people claiming it is not sweet enough which surprised me. I think the difference is in the quality of chocolate used. I used Scharfenberger -- much more expensive and definitely worth it! The quality of one's brownie is directly related to the quality of the chocolate used. I NEVER use regular grocery store chocolate but hunt out the best: Valhrona, Callebaut, and now Scharfenberger! A cheaper chocolate will give a bitter taste but a more expensive, quality chocolate will definitely offer a richer brownie!

Good, but not very sweet. Fairly moist, but there are so many other brownie recipes, I'm not sure I'd redo. Think I'll try the "Joy" recipe.

These brownies were very good but I have several recipes which I prefer. Used this one to make use of a surplus of white chocolate. Another tip for novice baker, Michele. Get yourself a copy of The Joy of Cooking (I have the old one. Not sure this recipe is in the new version as I haven't seen it) Look up the ' Brownies Cockaigne' recipe & follow that method exactly. It never fails. I even use their mixing method with other recipes. It produces a consistently moist, perfectly cooked brownie which is never dry or flaky. They point out that adding the melted chocolate/butter mixture while still hot, results in a dry, tough brownie & that's absolutely right. Easy & foolproof method.

I was weary about making brownies as the boxed version even came out dry in the past. The recipe was simple to follow and the brownies were delicious with a good flavor. I will definitely try them again.

I liked this brownie, but I think it could use more sugar. We could taste the bitterness of the chocolate. Next time I might add 1/4 cup more sugar and see if that works better. And I had to bake mine for more than 28 minutes...otherwise the tester came out wet, not with moist crumbs (and yup, I measured everything correctly). I will definitely try the recipe again.

Very good brownie--chewy and moist, with nice, big chunks of white chocolate for texture. It even got high marks from my roommate, and she is notoriously hard to please! If the new chef can stand one more variation on the "do not overbake" theme, I have learned from my own early sad experience that it is best to take baked goods out of the oven just BEFORE they are completely done because the retained heat continues to cook them for a few minutes. I have baked my share of over-crispy items in the past. I usually start checking on items about 10 - 15 minutes before the recipe indicates that they will be done. Don't give up!!!

This was a tasty, not a ravingly wonderful, brownie - and not overly sweet - yet it received good reviews when I took the batch to work. Good with a strong cup of coffee. Michelle, as the other cook from Chicago advises, make sure you've measured everything correctly, barely mix the batter after adding the flour, and haven't overbaked. Try again and let us know.

A tip to help Michelle with the "dry and flaky brownie." Make sure you are accurately measuring all your dry ingredients, and that you don't overcook the brownie. The 2/3 C flour is okay, but make sure you are measuring accurately. Best methods are by weighing or the scoop and sweep. Check the brownie for doneness after 20 minutes, 28 minutes may be too long. Moist crumbs should still be attached to a toothpick when its pulled out.

I have not made this recipe, but I read it and then read Michelle's comments. I have made loads of from-scratch brownies over the years and I think the problem with this recipe is too much flour. My favorite recipe is for double the size of this one and only uses 1 cup flour and no baking powder. I'm trying to remember my recipe off the top of my head while sitting at my desk at work. I think it is 2 sticks of butter, 4 eggs, 2 cups of sugar,1 cup of flour, 4 1 OZ unsweetened chocolate squares, and 1 tsp of vanilla. Grease and flour a 9x13 baking pan. Preheat your oven to 350. In a small saucepan, carefully melt chocolate and butter. In a large china bowl, using an electric mixer, beat eggs with sugar until thick. Using a wooden spoon, add slightly cooled butter and chocolate. Add flour and vanilla. Pour into pan making sure batter spreads evenly. (you can sprinkle chocolate chips into this batter if you wish or the white chocolate chips.) Bake for 25-30 minutes. Test. If toothpick comes out too wet, bake a few more minutes, but be careful. There is nothing worse than a dry brownie. When toothpick has moist crumbs, remove from oven. Cool in pan on a rack. Cut and serve.

First time I made brownies from scratch . . . not too bad. White chocolate chunks are great! The brownies are very good but not chewy. They actually came out a little flaky and dry. I'm not very experienced with baking so I don't know how to make these brownies perfect. Any tips?
