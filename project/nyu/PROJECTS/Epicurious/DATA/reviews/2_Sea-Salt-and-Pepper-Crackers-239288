Horrible recipe, especially if you're expecting something with a firm, brittle texture -- you know, like a CRACKER. They fell apart easily and crumbled into bits, and weren't able to stand up to cheese or dip. Big waste of flour.

ok--new variation that I had NO clue would change the taste so much: 1/2 cup whole wheat flour+reg unbleached (I never use bleached) and they almost taste like peppery pretzels I kept the double peppercorn mix and my adjusted ratio of shortening/flour Who knew?? A NEW CRACKER IS BORN!

pepper is not ON the list but it is included in the recipe directions--always read the recipe FIRST. I didn't think 1 tsp of pepper was enough for me, so I used 1 tsp black and 1 tsp specialty hot peppercorn mix--WOW I also used a 1/2 cup more flour and water accordingly after reading review about "pastry" texture. Also used granular sea salt. Mine needed about 10 more mins to be crispy (using a very light hand on olive oil) These were sensational!!

no, sara is right; the pepper is indeed missing from the ingredients.

No, Sara, you're right. The amount of pepper is missing from the ingredients list. I guess it doesn't matter, since it's just going on the edges at the end?

Sara, you just missed reading it in the recipe: Trim edges and sprinkle each sheet with teaspoon toasted pepper.

Not sure this is a true review, since I messed up and had to improvise. I accidentally added too much water, so instead of more flour (I was almost out) I used over half a cup of finely ground cornmeal, and used cornmeal to roll it out as well. I also required much more time in the oven. That being said, I'd like to try them as written, and I liked how mine came out as well....

These crackers were not what I expected but still good. They were more like savory pie crust than what I think of as crackers. I also had to bake them for about 10 minutes longer than stated. Despite this, they were very nice with the cold curried pea soup in this menu, and so I would make them again if I was making the soup, but would probably not make them on their own.
