Amazing. There are a lot of steps, but each one is relatively simply. I love the almond flavor and the texture of the cake.

I used 8x8 pans, and apricot jelly . . . definitely more jelly then called for. I kept the pans in the oven a little longer than suggested. The recipe turned out perfectly.

I have to agree with the other reviews. This was not a walk in the park. It was a very labor intensive recipe and it had it's faults. One major one being that the batter was skimpy so it did not reach the edges of the pan. After all that work with folding in egg whites, dividing batters and introducing the very messy food coloring, you just wanted it to be done and worth all the effort. Just manipulate it to an even thickness knowing that it won't reach the edges completely. You might have to stop short about 2 inches shy of the 13 inches. I suppose you could use a smaller set of pans, I just didn't have any others. I also felt I had to keep it in the oven a bit longer than suggested. I don't know if that's what I should have done but I did. I baked it until the center of each layer no longer looked raw/darker than the outer edges. Then I assembled and threw in the fridge for a day. I will say that I lost a whole day to this project and I swore I would NEVER make this again...Until I tried them. They were very much worth all the work (although I'm sure there must be an easier way) and I will be making them again...But ONLY for a special occasion!

I loved these and everyone who had them loved these and everyone who didn't get one was sooooo jealous! A lot of work but worth every minute!

This recipe is not for the timid baker, but for anyone willing to spend the time (and money), it's a stunner. Received rave reviews, especially from nostalgic Italian friends.

Fabulous! Made these for July 4th (used blue instead of green of course), turned out beautifully and so delicious. Best of all they freeze extremely well and are wonderful and soft right out of the freezer. Used seedless raspberry jam instead of the orange marmalade.

Easily the most challenging cookie recipe I've made to date. Also an expensive ingredient list. I would only make them again if they were requested. They were delicious, and you do get a large number of cookies for the work and ingredients you put in.

These are my family's favorites. I use these for Christmas cookies and they are a beautiful addition to the trays. Have also made them with yellow and green for Easter, and I just made them for my niece's wedding and used 2 colors of pink and white. I also always use raspberry jam, a bit more than calls for, and they are perfect. Do not be scared away by the effort... they are well worth it.

Changed filling to Raspberry I agree labor intensive but family loved them. Batter was a little skimpy to spread to the desired size of pan but was able to adjust to get it close to the edges

Labor intensive but well worth the effort! Delicious, colorful, Italian flag colors, but could be used for Christmas colors as well.
