Another of the sauces I used for my fondue party. Went particularly well with the marinated beef cooked in a pho-style broth. Yummy!

This is a great nuoc cham sauce, has a few tweaks here and there compared to other variations I've tried, e.g. more lime juice in one or less sugar in another, etc., but essentially the same ingredients. We have a fairly large Vietnamese community here in N.O., and many of the cooks I know from there each has his or her own variation based on personal/family tastes. One thing that's always been stressed to me though.."very important to use the pulp from the lime..." Also, nearly everyone I know shreds carrots into the sauce & some calling it "pickled carrots" when recommending to non-natives. This one will go with my collection.
