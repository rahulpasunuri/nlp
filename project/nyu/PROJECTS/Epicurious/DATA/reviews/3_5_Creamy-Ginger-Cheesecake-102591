when making cheesecake, i always add plain yogurt to the recipe and always use fewer eggs. (1 egg per 8 oz cream cheese) this results in a creamier, mousse-like texture. i also always bake cheesecakes in a bain-marie - which is absent in this recipe. as for the yogurt - i drain it - i add 6 oz yogurt to each 8 oz cream cheese. but for what its worth, i find that you can get a better cheesecake all around if you don't make such a big one. i make multiple 7"/diameter cheesecakes. they're just much better for me that way - more control over the micro batch

I brought this to a dinner party, and a cheesecake fanatic raved and suggested that I go into business selling these cheese cakes. I increased the ginger as well, and the result was fantastic - very creamy. We have made the recipe now several times, always with the same result. Maybe the odd texture that the other reviewers experienced was due to overcooking??

I love making (and eating) cheesecake, but this one missed the mark. I agree with the other reviewer that there was something odd about the texture. There are definitely better cheesecake recipies out there.

This wasn't very creamy - rather it almost had a gritty, clotted texture. However, the guests said it was great and had seconds... nonetheless I wouldn't make it again. There's got to be a better cheesecake recipe out there that I would just toss grated and candied ginger into it.

I used ff cream cheese and sour cream, added more crystallized ginger to the filling, more fresh ginger to both the filling and the topping,plus I added a TBLSP. of ginger liqueur to the topping as well as the filling. This truly was divine!
