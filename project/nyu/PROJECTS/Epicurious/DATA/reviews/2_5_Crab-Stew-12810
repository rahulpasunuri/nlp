Dusappointing. I added celery and, in an attempt to bring up some flavor and authenticity, red pepper and parsley. This wasn't bad, it was just bland and a waste of crab.

I've had this recipe in my collection for 11 years and wish I had tried it before now. Delicious! I added a stalk of celery, chopped when I cooked the onions. Also, I seasoned it with Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce. It's quick and could easily be made ahead (except for adding the crab). It's definitely a keeper.

A winner with my family! I doubled the recipe, used 1 large green pepper + 1 hungarian wax pepper for a little kick, and the taste was terrific!
