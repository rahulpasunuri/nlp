I would also cook it for a shorter period of time. I think it would be easier to assemble if the diameter of the crust were a bit larger. The ingredients blended very well, but it was difficult to get them all balanced on a 4 1/2 inch crust.

The interplay of flavours in the topping is sublime and unexpected, but I found the puff pastry crust distracted -- too crisp. Perhaps I should have cooked it for 15 minutes instead of 20.

OK, ginger, tuna, mozzorella, radishes all on a pizza??? Well, folks, this is a great recipe. A total surprise. The flavors blend extremely well. I didn't have cherry tomatoes so I used vine ripened slices and it was great. The flavors are subtle and the puff pastry "crust" was working its magic in the background. I would suggest this as a great starter. I'm still amazed at how good this was.....
