Is everybody's terrine not so much as creamy when breaking off but more crumbly? And also how is that that the glaze in this picture is much more appealing than mine? Any suggestions?

Ok how do you get the ganache that shiny? Mine dulled up when I refrigerated it. Haven't tasted it yet as it's for a birthday celebration being held this evening.

This was so very easy to make and the results were fantstic! Next time I'll change it up with Nutella & hazlenuts instead of the peanutbutter and peanuts.

Easy, delicious and impressive, this terrine was a crowd-pleaser at an elegant dessert party. I increased the peanut butter to 7 Tbs, which made the flavor discernible. Thanks to a previous reviewer, I subbed brown rice syrup for corn syrup and it worked well. I used Guittard bittersweet chocolate wafers, which gave an excellent flavor and eliminated the need to chop chocolate. Can't wait to make this again!

This is amazing. Like a big peanut butter cup but elegant. It freezes well, even the peanuts.

This was elegant and delicious, especially considering how easy it was. Like the other reviewer, I was hoping for more of a peanuty flavor, but it was almost too subtle - about 98% chocolate flavor and only 2% peanut. However, the addition of the sugared peanuts made up for that loss. The recipe says serves 8 but you really only need a thin sliver of it, it is so rich. You could easily get 12 or more servings out of it.

This was so good - but had less peanut butter flavor than I expected. I used semi-sweet chocolate and brown rice syrup instead of the corn syrup in the glaze and it was just heavenly. Combined with the Meyer Lemon Semifreddo on this site and the combination was amazing.
