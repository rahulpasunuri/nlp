so easy and so perfect. didn't have light corn syrup so used a combo of honey and dark corn syrup and it was still delicious.

I was looking for a good chocolate glaze to top a raspberry cheesecake, and this fit the bill perfectly! So easy, yet so elegant when it set up. I used what was remaining (it makes a lot of glaze) to dip raspberries into, and they were wonderful as well--would be good for chocolate dipped strawberries, I think. It was firm but not hard like some glazes that feel like a candy bar.
