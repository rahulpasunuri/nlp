Simple. Fresh. Perfectly French. Julia would be proud to serve this! This is staple recipe in my weekly dinners.

Delicious and simple. Couldn't fit all 4 pieces in 1 pan, so did in batches. 2nd set browned better than the 1st, but all delicious. Was going to add capers, but forget them. Would have totally worked.

How can you go wrong with so much butter? :-) I didn't try the fish because it was way too rich for me but my husband loved it. He gave it 3 forks. It is very easy as well. But you can't make it too often because it is really not healthy.

This recipe was actually very good, I enjoyed it thoroughly, but its basically fish swimming in butter  and for the calories it needs to be out of this world. Emeril's recipe is MUCH better.

I have made this recipe many times. It is simple and delicious and turns out perfect every time.

A real classic and very delicious. Mine needed a sprinkling of salt at the table, so next time I'll just do that when the fish is hot out of the pan. But otherwise, this recipe is perfect and simple.

Very tasty. The fishmonger cut the fillets into thin strips which fell apart in the pan when I tried to flip so next time I'll get them a little more square. The taste of the sauce and parsley really made this dish and was a perfect combination of lemon and butter.

Delicious. Husband loved it and even the kids ate it up. Didn't have parsley, so added a few capers and extra lemon juice. Perfect.

This recipe is a little tricky, depending upon the thickness of fish. Sole fillets are generally thin and I feared that too much heat would overcook the fish, yet high heat is required to sear the crust. So that part of the process deserves your attention. If you don't have enough heat, it's difficult to get the proper finish on the fillet. The rest of the recipe is pretty fundamental, and it works. I haven't found many fish fillets where lemon & parsley wouldn't work. There's nothing fancy here. It is exactly what it proclaims itself to be -- a classic fish recipe.

I've made this several times with rockfish, using clarified butter rather than oil and regular butter. It was really lovely--perfectly browned and yet perfectly tender. The whole family loved it.

Since sole was not available I prepared this using grouper. My husband loved it. Served it with tomato and feta salad. Very tasty.

Wow...I made this dish tonight. Now, we know what Julia Child talked about!

Wonderful simple recipe. I have a hard time getting a good sear (my pan is never hot enough), so I forego the flour entirely and follow the recipe as is otherwise and . . . it's still delicious and I get a good sear more often. Definitely don't shortcut and put the lemon juice in the pan with the sole; the water in the juice will make your nice, hard-won crust soggy. Strictly follow directions on this one.

This was excellent!! I make this at least every other week. I just can't get enough of it. The sauce is superb, great with crusty bread to soak it all up.

This was horrible bc its so good and reminds you of that perfect night at that perfect little bistro you found in the 6th that you will look around your apartment and fall into despair that you are not in France enjoying this meal. Evil evil receipt. I cooked this for just me on beautiful Sunday evening with steamed asparagus with hollandaise sauce and simple frisee salad. It was a religious experience.

This. Tastes. Like. Love. I am not even huge on white fish really, and I wanted to marry this and have tiny buttery babies with it. Too far? Seriously though, it was spectacular, and though the recipe requires a bit of finesse, it's really quite easy. Have everything ready for the sauce before you go, butter browns quickly at the higher temp. Kosher salt is flakier, so it sticks well to meats while cooking. Serve this with a pile of baby greens and some warm crusty bread to soak up the sauce. Also, I would make three filets per person next time, (but perhaps mine were small), however I think the sauce is sufficient. The sauce left in the pan is really excellent when eaten sopped up on leftover bread over the stove after you're done eating your fish. ; )

I'm questioning myself, since the article implied that something so simple could go so wrong. To me, this fish seemed to oily. My family wished it had more "crunch."

What is the reason for using Kosher salt instead of regular salt? I've noticed this trend in many recipes lately.

This is a great recipe. I highly recommend marinating the fish in whole milk for about 20-30 minutes beforehand. It'll make the texture of the fish super delicate and creamy. Yummmm!

double the amount of sauce and use it on the new potatoes with lemon butter sauce recipe also on epicurious. lovely, light combination- not for those who are faint of heart around butter though.

I thought it was great, but the boyfriend was trying to feed his fish to the cat. This recipe might not be the best for picky eaters.
