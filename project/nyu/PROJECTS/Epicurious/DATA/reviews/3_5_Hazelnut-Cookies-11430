These just came out of the oven. While very rich, they just do not come together flavorfully on their own. I'm going to try frosting them with Nutella to mask.

The flavors were good, but the batter is dry. The cookies are very crumbly, so probably won't store very well. A tasty cookie, but needs more moisture.

My attempt at following the recipe to the letter wasn't that great. Firstly it was just a crumbly bunch of flour/sugar/butter/nuts with no binding, I had to add a couple of tablespoons of water to get it to look like dough. I followed the level teaspon measure and got a tiny little cookie (makes 60 no problem). But they were too small and totally dried out in the oven and the bottoms got burnt even after taking them out at 15 minutes. The next batch I reduced the temperature to 300F, baked them for 8 minutes and increased their size slightly. Sandwiched them with some melted chocolate and they were good. The flavors are decent but the mechanics of this recipe are just wrong and I'm surprised it got a 4-fork rating.

I made this recipe in a college dorm kitchen with no measuring devices smaller than a 1/4 cup, and no way to beat the butter and sugar other than a fork, and they were still delicious! I substituted lemon zest for orange, I also probably used closer to a 1/2 tablespoon of it. Because I really like lemon and I read that the dough was on the dry side I added some lemon juice to it, which I think added a nice flavor. Also, I dipped them in melted chocolate. Yum!

The orange zest packs quite a flavor punch -- it really helps set this cookie apart from others. I found the batter to be extremely dry thought -- a few tablespoons of water fixed that and the batter was fine. Split the batter in half and added small amount of chocolate chips to one half and they were excellent, too. No way this makes 60 cookies -- I barely cleared 30 and they were SMALL.

These are divine! Love the hazelnut/orange zest combo. Don't know how it makes 60 cookies, though. I made them fairly small and got less than 30.

Who would have thought something so simple would be so delicious? Made these for a New Year's celebration, as part of a brunch buffet. Will definitely save this recipe.

this is a very light flakey cookie if you love hazelnut flavor you will make this cookie over and over
