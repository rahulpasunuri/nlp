This was incredibly easy and had incredible flavor. My only changes were that I used asiago cheese, dried basil instead of thyme, and boneless chicken breasts. Baked at 375 convection for 32 minutes. My husband really loved this.

This was an easy recipe and we loved the rich earthy flavor of the shitakes and cheese. I made two with the porvolone and the third with goat cheese because I love goat cheese and stufed chicken breasts instead of on the bone which worked fine. They both were very flavorful.

Purists be warned! I'm rating this recipe under the influence of numerous alterations. I subbed baby bellas for shiitakes (due to limited funds), and added two cloves of garlic and about 2 oz of leftover Gorgonzola to the "stuffing." I also followed suggestions of earlier reviewers and used boneless skinless breasts, pounded flat, wrapped, secured with toothpicks, and cooked at 475 for 20 minutes. I'm thrilled to say I failed to fulfill my MO of over-cooking chicken. It was just right. I also followed the brilliant suggestion of putting potato "sticks" (.25X.25X2 inches) between the chicken breasts to cook in the drippings. I tossed the potatoes with olive, oil, sea salt, pepper, and herbes de provence. They required about 5 minutes more than the chicken to fully cook. The whole thing was accompanied by a spring green salad, sauteed brussel sprouts, buttered french bread, and cheap red wine. Fantastic! We split two chicken breasts between three people and have delicious left-overs to enjoy later. Now I just wish I had more left over potatoes...

When I stuff cheese into chicken, I always cut it into a rectangle and wrap ham or proscuitto arround it so the cheese doesn't all melt out (I'm sure smoked turkey or chicken from the deli would work well for those who don't eat pork).

I used Parmesan and fresh mozzarella instead of provolone and turned the temperature down to 450. Delicious! Chicken was ultra tender. I think I'll use bone-in all the time now.

Rating: 1
We made this recipe pretty much as written. I think we chopped the mushrooms and shallot too much in the processor. I think a sharper cheese would be much better, perhaps a blue cheese. I agree with other reviews that cooking at 500 degrees is too high. It produces a lot of smoke. 450 works better. We made the opening small and used toothpicks to keep it closed but a lot of the stuffing still came out while cooking. We probably won't work on making this recipe better.

What a way to take chicken and make it yummy. This has a definite Italian taste and next time it would be good paired with pasta and a light tomato sauce to compliment the bite of the provolone. I cooked 450 for 15 min. and it was done through and through. I used boneless,skinless breasts and I made a long slit...like a pita pocket and filled. I then put some steamed spinach leaves on top of the cheese mixture and used a toothpick. This stopped any melting cheese from escaping. It was easy and quick.

Rating: 3
Hmmm I am rating it a 3 only because I had to make some changes based on what I had in my kitchen. I love people who add what they did a little different so I can feel better about using what I have on hand and know there is a good chance it will come out as yummy as the original. I used fresh parmesan, boneless breast and only other minor change was not pureeing the mushrooms and shallots, i did chop them into tiny little pieces. I had an extra chicken for the next day and it was still deliciouso! Not only would I make again, but I totally recommended!

Rating: 3
I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, but it was still fantastic. I added about a teaspoon of the demi-glace I'd made the weekend before to the stuffing, and it added such a good depth and colored the stuffing a lovely toasty brown. I read from other reviewers that there was some trouble with oozing, so I took the lemon of melting, oozy cheese and turned it into, well, not lemonade, but probably better: about halfway through the roasting in the oven, I sliced wide, medium-thick pieces of crusty bread and arranged them around the meat, tucking the crust edges just under each breast--the cheese and juices from the meat and stuffing oozed their way between the toothpicks and into the bread, which toasted and acquired a flavorful, rich crust of cheese and drippings, resulting in a delicious, if a little unusual, side dish--a cross between bread pudding and herbed cheese bread. My brother and our friends actually ended up devouring the bread before attacking the moist, tender, and flavorful chicken. I will make this again and again.

yum, i really liked the flavor of the stuffing, I actually had left over stuffing that used for a tuna melt and other stuff. I thought it was fantastic

Wow! Found 500 degrees resulted in a lot of smoke in the oven and enough heat to cause much of the stuffing to flow from the breast pocket. Would not cook at this temperature again. For me, this recipe still needs work. Did like the taste of the chicken and stuffing, though.

Rating: 3
To prevent oozing, keep the opening for the 'pocket' only 1 inch wide by rotating the knife inside each breast. Anyway, provolone seemed to ooze less than other cheeses. I briefly sauteed the skin side of chicken before baking, so they were nicely browned. I didn't line the baking pan, so I was able to deglaze with dry wine for a light sauce.

Rating: 0
I love this recipe. I never used the shitakes, though. But it works well with baby portobello or regular button mushrooms. I also used fress thyme a few times. I've tried it breaded and baked that way as well. It's fine as it is, so you don't really have to change it. I didn't mind the stuffing oozing out. Most remained in. Tonight I'm trying it with Fontina cheese. I'm sure it will be delicious as always. Definitely a keeper!

I thought this was pretty good- I stuffed the chicken with provolone, mushrooms & red onions. It's a really easy recipe if you skip the food processor step- then it's a cinch & doesn't take much time at all. I don't know why everyone's freaking out about the stuffing oozing out- just use a ton of toothpicks to seal it tight- it worked great for me. I made with green beans & bacon- wish I would've sauteed the mushroom/red onion mixture in the bacon grease. That's the only change I would make. Great & EASY!

Rating: 4
WOW!! This is so simple and delicious! I think it would be very adaptable--I used the cheese that was in the refrigerator. I think that feta, parmesan, or almost any cheese would be good in this. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast, and just folded the narrow end over--I may pound the breast out more next time, but it really isn't necessary. The stuffing oozed a bit--but the presentation with the mushrooms showing was great. This is going to be a regular weeknight dish and is good enough to impress company too!! My husband and I could not get over the flavor of this simple dish!

This was great. I used large chicken breasts from the butcher. Cut up a potato in wedges to cook in the drippings. Just used natural pocket in the breast for the stuffing and put some under the skin to make it nice and crispy. Did what other suggested and chopped the mushrooms and shallots. I don't have a food processor anyway. As for the person that used portabello mushrooms and found they turned things grey - remove the gills. It may be a little work but something I always do with them.

Rating: 3
I would definitely make this dish again. I thought that the flavours worked really well together. Loved the Provalone with the Shitakes. I chopped the Shitakes very coursly, so that they kept some of their shape versus turning into mush. Easy enough for a weeknight meal, but nice enough to serve to company.

Rating: 3
My husband and I enjoyed this, but there are other stuffed chicken recipes I make that are a little less time consuming and just as good. Still, I would probably make it again, most likely on a weekend. To minimize the oozing of the stuffing, I covered the pocket with a half a slice of prosciutto and it worked pretty well in addition to tasting good.

The Flavour in this recipe is well worth the effort. However I had a hard time keeping the stuffignin. It oozed out befor it was fully cooked. I think the bottom half of the chicken was done, but the top half wasn't. Any suggestions to keep the stuffing in?? I think I will try pounding it very thin, than rolling it around stuffing, with twine to keep it together. Provolone is a must, shitaki's add a very rich flavour. I tried it once with portobello, BIG mistake. It tasted good, but the black bottomof the portobellos turned the mixture a very yucky grey!

Rating: 3
Very good and FAST. Cut a big hole in a ziploc to aid in piping in the stuffing. The sauce that dribbles out is a good addition to white rice.

Rating: 3
We used an extra shallot in the filling (love shallots!). We didn't food-process the filling, we finely chopped the mushrooms and shallots. We, like many other reviewers, used boneless, skinless breasts pounded flat, then rolled the filling inside. We used plenty of wooden toothpicks to hold them together, and almost no filling leaked out. We cooked them for about 20 minutes at 475. Perfect! We really liked this dish. The flavor was subtle and delicious. A nice change from our usual spice-fest food!

If you are contemplating making this recipe, just read a handful of the reviews and you will see that it is absolutely worth the effort! (although, not SUPER easy, as some suggest) My husband told me I had taken a 'step-up' in my cooking skills when he tasted this! He told me it was the best meal I had ever made. For the stuffing, I added garlic (why not?), fresh rosemary/thyme, swiss/mozz/parm, garlic powder, and ground flax seed for good health. I pounded thin cutlets out and wrapped around large spoonfuls of stuffing (looked like pigs in a blanket). Set each one in its own little foil basket in a 9x12 dish, topped with butter and a little white wine, and baked for 30 min at 450, but next time will try 20 min and 500. The best part was that I served it over parmesean rosotto with a side of blanched green beans, and it was fantastic. Looked like something you'd order in a restaurant!

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe. Because of the half-melted cheese as part of the filling, it holds together so stuffing the breasts is easy and spillproof just using a spoon and not having to pipe it in as some fillings require. The high oven heat made a nice crispy coating, although I had some of the chicken fat pop and splatter when removing the pan. I recommend using tongs to remove the chicken onto a plate and letting the baking pan cool in the oven a while. Very tender and tasty. I sliced a leftover breast into a salad the next day with arugula, spinach, mango, and vinaigrette. What a treat!

This is a nice, quick recipe. I used boneless skinless (what I could get) and mozzarella (what I had). I closed the pockets with lemon wedges to hold the stuffing in and that worked well, although the foil is still necessary. Would be even better with time to brine the chicken and definitely better with the provolone.

One of the tastiest AND easiest dishes I've made from this website.

I have a few critiques . . . first, nevermind the food processor. Just finely chop the mushrooms, onion, and garlic (because my local market doesn't carry challot's {sp}) with a knife, then sautee. I haven't tried this yet, but I can guarantee it will be great from just thinking about it. Try breading the chicken after cutting the slot with bread crumbs, salt and pepper (as if it were chicken parmisean,) then pan fry on each side until golden brown (about 1-2 minutes on each side.) Once the outside is breaded, stuff the inside as described in the recipe. Cook at 500 for 15 minutes instead of 20-25, because the outside of the chicken is already cooked. I guarantee this recipe will fully satisfy a whole family!

I have made this twice so far. It is really good. Great weeknight dish.

The flavor combination in this recipe is divine; however, I would probably find a better way of incorporating it than as a stuffing which mostly falls out of the chicken during cooking. Maybe just as a topping in the final few minutes of baking the breasts by themselves?

I made this last night. I was good but I kept thinking if I made it again I would definately change some things.I would not chop the mushrooms so small,you couldn't even see one. Also I think it needs something like maybe just mushrooms sauted with butter and poured over top. It was good but does need some improvements in my opinion.

Rating: 3
Really great and so simple! I used boneless chicken breasts, onion and baby bella mushrooms -- what I had on hand -- and I was really please with the outcome. I did add a good-sized dollop of boursin to the filling, to give it a little extra zip and creaminess. Rather than place the stuffed breasts on tin foil, I lined the pan with leftover raw mushroom slices -- to catch any oozing filling. That was an inspired move if I do say so myself! Delicious! I served it with glazed carrots, rice pilaf and a salad. Yummy meal!

Very tasty but... next time I will use a mix of gourmet mushrooms and leave them in slices instead of chopping them in the food processor. I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of bone-in.

Per other reviewers suggestions made this with boneless skinless breasts, pounded thin and rolled around the stuffing. Baked at 500 for 20 minutes (I think it took 5 minutes longer than others because my oven was a little cool). It was very good, super easy, and looked beautiful. Will definitely make again.

Fresh mixed mushrooms, shallots, herbs, smoked provolone, baked in slit, skinless chicken breasts. Easy, delicious - served with "all leftovers Spanish rice" - except for additional fresh zuchinni. Dewberry, get over yourself - go write a book of poetry. (Basted 2 or 3 times with additional butter.)

I ended up making this with boneless, skinless breasts. Kitchen scissors help to make the 'pocket' for the filling. I made same amount of filling, used 3 breasts, stuffed breasts and put extra filling on top of each breast as a sort of 'crust' and didn't use the extra butter, salt and pepper on top since I had the 'crust'. Baked at 400 for 20 minutes. It was really good.

Rating: 3
Everyone agreed... they want to eat a loaf of the stuffing! It was really tasty. I forgot to brine the chicken, so it was slightly dry. I tried to prop the chicken up with foil, but it still oozed out a bit. Also, I would use LARGE breasts for this. I used the frozen Trader Joes breasts, and they were just too small. This is a yummy dinner.

based on others, I used boneless/skinless breasts, and a mix of mozz/swiss (what I had) and baked for 15 @ 500 and broiled for 3 min to get a good brown color and crisp stuffing at the edges. We were picking it off of the tinfoil, so good. It was a little salty but that may have been the cheese we used. I would keep the sides simple. we boiled broccoli and orzo and added a little butter and pepper. Plus a bottle of nice white wine. yum.

An easy yet impressive dish, and one that allows for lots of easy substitutions that are equally good. I've tried this as written, as well as substituting various things depending on what I had in the house - ham instead of mushrooms; other fresh herbs like oregano or sage instead of thyme; boneless breasts for bone-in...all good! When using boneless breasts I just made slits in the thick part of the breast to stuff them, and baked at 425 for about 20 minutes - they were great! (I recommend putting them under the broiler for a minute to brown them at the end.)

Delicious, especially the stuffing. I love the use of the "Thomas Keller" method of high temp roasting to create a juicy breast. But the skin did not turn out crispy like it does when I roast a whole chicken this way, &, although it was moist it could have been moister. Would love to hear how Atlanta got the skin to crisp. I used a glass baking dish and leaned each breast againt the other to keep the filling inside- perhaps this had something to do with it. Served with Steamed Broccoli with Olive Oil & Parmesan (from this site). Everyone loved the meal, and I will make this again, but would appreciate any suggestions for ensuring the skin crisps to lock in the juices better. Thanks.

I love this dish--it was perfect for a fall night. I wondered about the cx too, but I'm so glad that I bought the bone-in, skin on chicken. Roasting it gave it the crispiest crust and it was so moist. I live alone, and the chicken came in a package of 3, so I only made three and had a little bit of stuffing left over. Also, the food processor made all of the steps easy. I am looking forward to experimenting with other ingredients such as different cheeses and herbs...

A good solid recipe! Great with hari corts vert on a fall Sunday. Appreciated suggestion from North Georgia incase you only have boneless skinless breasts on hand. Don't bother to read Dewberry, it was a gross waste of time.

Dewberry: I'm glad you liked the recipe, but it seems to me you prefer the sound of your own voice (in prose). Yes, this is a good, yet simple recipe for chicken breasts, but you seem to throw around superlatives ("best," "most," etc.) as if they are fact and not merely your opinion. And if this is the best chicken recipe "out there right now," where exactly is "out there?" I suggest you refer to publications like Art Culinaire, just to name one, before you make such claims. In my opinion, this recipe is fine for a week night meal with the kids, but's merely an American-built sedan in the in the culinary auto show.

Before going into my review of this recipe, your first need to ask yourself, "Why am I cooking this?" Do you need a quick and simple meal? Do you need a chicken recipe because it's all that you have running around in the pen at 4:00? Do you need a recipe for a special occasion? Or do you want to cook something that will please the entire family? You have to ask these questions because this recipe is different from conventional chicken recipes. If you want something that will knock the socks off your husband's boss when he invites him over for dinner without the courtesy of calling ahead, then stop reading this review and look for "Fried Chicken." If the kids are crying because you haven't fed them yet and it's almost bedtime, find "Boiled Chicken." If you need something fast then look no further than "Roast Chicken." Now that we have gotten this issue out of the way, let's get on with my review of this recipe. "Chicken Stuffed with Shiitakes and Provolone" is the best chicken recipe out there right now. It uses conventional chicken breasts found in supermarkets. Shiitakes are the most flavorful mushrooms in their class right now. You don't need to worry about buying too much cheese because this recipe very efficiently utilizes it. Furthermore, the supporting cast of ingredients is a thing of beauty. Check this out - shallot, thyme, salt, pepper, lemon, and mango chutney can't be wrong! Woooo hoooo! Friends, I urge, no IMPLORE you to at least try this once. Hope this review helps your cooking decision. Thanks for reading (if you make it this far).

OK, purists be warned, I just can't follow recipes to the T unless I am baking (and I really don't enjoy baking all that much). I made the filling more or less as listed with two exceptions. Since I live in the middle of nowhere and shitakes are a 40 minute drive away, I settled on button mushrooms. Since I had fresh thyme in the fridge, I substituted this for dried in appropriate quantity. Then I went astray. Because I prefer working with boneless skinless breasts, I used them and pounded them like a scallopine. Then I mounded the filling in the center, folded each like an envelope and rolled them in the fresh breadcrumbs I made while I had the processor out. Sauteed in olive oil until crisp and brown and then transferred to a 375 oven to finish. Baked with the seam side up and they managed to hold their shape with very little oozing. It was a spectacular main course!

To prevnent leakage of stuffing, roll a foot of aluminum foil into a ball and prop chicken breast on it with opening at the top. Comes out restaurant picture perfect.

This recipe ended up being a disaster! I used skinless boneless chicken breasts. The oven temp. seemed odd to me that it would be 500! My fire alarm went off! I just let the chicken cook in the heat of the oven. When I took it out the filling had oozed everywhere! It ended up good, but what a mess!

My husband and I both loved this recipe. I have to say that I haven't gotten these kind of rave reviews from him in a while! He adored it! The flavors of the cheese and the mushrooms are wonderful together. I think part of the secret is getting a really nice provolone. I had a lovely version. The other thing that's really nice about this dish is that its quite easy to prepare.

Rating: 3
Fantasic. Very simple, with strong yet delicate flavours. I made an incision in the chicken breast from the thick end with a thin sharp knife and made a cavity inside by carefully waggling the blade from side to side. The more the filling stays in, the more its flavour permiates the chicken. Drank with a choice sauvignon from my father in laws cave.

This dish is so unique in it's flavor that I've never had anything quite like it. While it definitely leaves a strong taste in your mouth after you are finished, every bite is delicious. The mushrooms and shallot are the key ingredients to this dish. Don't underestimate the importance of using shittake mushrooms as opposed to other more bland types.

Although I hate it when people write in and have changed the recipe completely, I wanted to share what I did with this recipe because it was so terrific. I used fat, boneless, skinless breasts and cut a deep pocket into the fat side. I used "plain-old mushrooms becauwes that's what I had in my freezer, and low-fat swiss, because that's what I had in my fridge. Put the stuffed breasts in a pyrex dish, sprinkle with salt and pepper, add some white wine, and cook for about 20 minutes at 350 - fabulous.

I wanted to make this recipe and always read comments first. The comments were 4 forks. It's like reading a comedy routine. I especially like it when people are more interested in arguing then listening to comments. Some people are even doing an entirely different recipe, the only similarity is that they start with chicken. But then someone did this with trout! What a riot. I will try the recipe but keep those comments coming. They're priceless.

Made this recipe with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and it was not at all dry. I cut a pocket in the thickest part of the breast, and then just crammed those suckers full! I did save some of the butter and basted them again halfway through. Also, my convection oven will only reach 450 degrees, but 20 minutes at 450 was perfect! Even He Who Hates Chicken loved this -- he usually leaves half, but this one, he ate the whole thing! I didn't have time to wait at the deli counter for chunk provolone, so I bought a package of slices and ground them up in the food processor -- I think it mixed even better with the shallots and mushrooms that way. And easier!

I agree with the chef from Toronto. It's annoying when someone takes a recipe, COMPLETELY changes it and then reviews it. That doesn't help other readers. (The title says "Review this recipe") To Chef411 - tweaking is one thing, to completely change it and then rave about it is just plain egotistical, in my opinion. What if everyone changed the recipe and then reviewed the modified version? There would be no reviews of the recipe at the top of the screen. I made it as is and it was very good.

I made this recipe exactly as written. I thought it was quite good. I too would like to try it with a boneless chicken breast, but I think using the skin-on breasts helped keep the chicken moist while baking at 500 degrees. I used to be able to get skin-on boneless chicken breasts at the grocery but that was many years ago. Perhaps a butcher would have them readily available. I think the recipe is a keeper - will make it again.

Could anyone tell me what is the reason why the chicken breasts need to be with bones? we get very large, meaty chicken breasts without skin or bones, and would prefer to do this recipe again without it becoming "finger food" or having my guests have to go through the bone picking process with fork and knife. Any reasons? Comments? Thanks.

I made this exactly as the recipe said. On the plus side: it is tasty, not difficult to prepare, and attrractive on the plate. I felt that it needed extra flavor, however--and be careful of overcooking the chicken. Because my bone-in,skin-on chicken pieces were very large, I left them in too long and they were slightly dry. Should have used an instant thermometer to check.

Delicious recipe, but I didn't quite follow it. I combined half an onion, 3 cloves of garlic, parsley, and half a red bell pepper to the additional ingredients mentioned in the recipe. Chop and saute the ingredients for the filling and stuff the chicken breasts. Use olive oil to brown the chicken in a pot and add some white wine to it afterwards. Then, transfer the chicken and its juices to a baking pan, adding one cup of water and a tablespoon of butter. Cook for 50-60 minutes at 400 degrees. Serve with fettuccine and Bon Appetit!
