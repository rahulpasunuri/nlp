Excellent and subtle comfort food. I took a couple of the suggestions from other reviewers as follows: omitted flour, added half an onion (diced) when sauteeing chicken, used dried thyme, used four chicken breasts instead of thighs, and added a teaspoon of mustard powder to the broth. Next time, I may try adding the garlic, but the flavors as is are great -- the parsnips add a little something extra, but don't overwhelm it the way I think carrots would. No more work than a shepherd's pie, really...

This was absolutely delicious, and really not that difficult. Like other reviewers, I used carrots instead of parsnips. I also sauteed some onion with the chicken, which I would recommend doing. I didn't have any brandy, so I used wine and just a little brown sugar. The result was fantastic. I will definitely be making this dish again!

really liked this, but the 2nd time, cut some corners. used store-bought rotisserie chicken and shredded it. roasted the carrots, parsnips and apples, then mixed with the chicken and peas. then followed the recipe and ended with store-bought mashers on top. so fast and easy, and just about as good.

I only have to cook for myself so I don't often make anything that requires time or effort. I made an exception for this dish and I am so glad I did! The flavors blend together so well. I love the apple-potato mixture mashed together. Tip for the lazy: I didn't peel the apple before I cut it. Next time I might not peel the potato. I did use the dark thigh meat which, as another reviewer said, helps flavor the dish. I used parsnips (as directed) and not carrots but next time I might use both. I also used dried thyme. Who can afford fresh? I am not made of money. Last tip: Make this on a weekend, it is time consuming.

I made a few flavor-enhancing tweaks to this dish that I would highly recommend. First, I reduced the amount of stock to 2 cups total with an improved effect. When making the sauce, I first added the brandy and scraped the pan. Then I added a tablespoon of good dijon mustard at the point that I added the cream and stock. Finally, I made a bit of slurry (flour & water) to thicken the sauce a bit. To the boiling apples and potatoes, I added 2 garlic cloves, which were very soft and mellow by the time they were mashed with the other mixture. Like other cooks, I used dried thyme also, substituted carrots for parsnips, and had only Fuji apples on hand. Still delicious. I agree that the flavors are subtle and homey, and feel that my additions brought out the flavor of the chicken and apples even more.

This recipe was wonderful. The flavors are simple and elegant. Both my husband and I loved it. I used spiced apple cider and added a touch of allspice. I recommend using chicken thighs as written, not chicken breasts, because the dish really needs he extra flavor the thighs provide. One negative--I put the peas on top and they burned. I will not include them next time.

I really thought this was exceptional. The only variation I made was using a combination of chicken thighs and breasts. The chicken keeps amazingly moist under the blanket of potatoes and apples. My sauce never really thickened, but it didn't really matter because the combination of flavors was outstanding. I can't reconcile why so many criticize a dish for being bland; sometimes a subtle flavor is more appealing. I'd definitely make this again.

Divine, delicious comfort food! It was a little time consuming, but I found that I was able to prepare the later ingredients while the parsnip, apple and potato were simmering. Very good for cold autumn evenings with good company and this dish really sets the ambiance for warmth and cheer. I've made it twice now, and the second time around it was much faster (about half as long) as I got into the groove of things. Also, I substituted parsnips with carrots as one of my guests was not too fond of parsnip. It turned out just as great!

I followed the recipe closely and found that the result was OK but not as dramatic as I'd expected. The potatoes and apples seemed to blend their flavors into something that wasn't as good as either individually. Also, very time-consuming to make.

Not a quick and simple recipe, but well worth the effort put into it! Loved the sweetness added by the apples, and the chicken was perfect! I will definitely make this again. Didn't change the recipe at all.

I have made this dish MANY times and it has become a family favorite. Initially, it did seem a bit time consuming but as with any thing, the more often you prepare it, the easier it seems! I have also made it for a casual dinner when I want to sit around with guests rather than be in the kitchen. I make it ahead and bake when they arrive--don't let other reviews scare you off---this is a keeper!

Very delicious and somewhat unusual. I don't usually serve parsnips with apples, but this was very tasty. I served it for my book club as an entree. Our book was Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris. The characters in the book lived in the Normandy region of Paris, so I thought this dish was appropriate. It was a hit. I combined dark meat (thighs) with white meat (breast) and it was delicious. I provided the guests with the recipe. I was able to put it together the day before and put it in the oven just prior to serving. Perfect for company.

Delicious comfort food. Served it for company and it was a big hit. In addition to the thyme I added fresh oregano. Make it a day ahead to let the flavors blend. Yummy.

I think this is quite good for a weekday type of meal for the family. I made it early in the day and then baked it for supper. The flavours probably had a chance to blend and was quite tasty. As for the work involved, it wasn't too bad. While the parsnips were cooking, I peeled the apple and potato. And while the apple and potato were cooking, I prepared the other ingredients. You do have to set aside about an hour to prepare but then it's great to have it ready and pop in the oven later!! My gravy didn't reduce in 3 minutes, either, but that didn't matter too much. I'll make it again!

My husband and I found this dish surprisingly bland for the amount of effort involved to prepare it. (My husband also discovered he doesn't like parsnips, but that's a different issue... ;-)

I liked it. The apple and parsnips were a nice flavor and I think inspired me to use parsnips more often. It was a nice homey dish, but nothing that blew me away. I probably wouldn't make it again, but not because it wasn't good, there are just too many other things to try!

What a lovely french dish. While reserving the hearty goodness of a typical chicken casserole, it adds a refreshingly, different, European gourmet flavor. Surprise everyone the next time you need a chicken casserole.

Yum! This is my husband's favorite new dish. It is a little labor-intensive, but made for many leftovers for us. Also, given that you can prepare it a day ahead of time, it could be very handy, even if it is a fair bit of work.

Only one suggestion. Chicken, as with most meats, is better when browned without coating it first with the flour. With the chicken coated in the flour you are browning the flour and not the meat. Try browning the chicken and then adding the flour after the chicken is removed and see the improvement in the dish.

I just love this! It's unusual and delicious. Since the chicken thighs come six to a package, I usually use a little less chicken and a few more parsnips. I have also added some leftover cooked chestnuts to the chicken and vegetables.

This was absolutely delicious. I was even asked for the recipe. I used chicken breast meat instead of the dark meat mainly because that is what I happened to have on hand but it was a perfect dish and very easy to make in spite of the various steps. Make it again, you bet!

This recipe involves too much effort, for the end result. It is also a little on the expensive side to prepare, which I wouldn't mind if it was a stand out dish. The presentation looks a little blah...Casserole is better day 2. I won't make it again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe, the flavors were great! The mashed potatoe/apple mixture was a little wet and during baking the 'gravy' bubbled up through the potatoes in places but it tasted great. It took at least 30 minutes for the broth, cream, brandy mixture to reduce to 1 1/4 cups - I can't imagine that the 3 minutes published in the recipe were correct.

I had this dish on two different occasions, and have very good results both times. The Apple Mashed Potatoes are very good, and the complex flavores give you a rathers woodey/comfort food felling.

I agree with most everyone. This took a lot of work, the sauce had little taste. and the flavors to not meld. My 14 year old son loved it reheated the next day, but he will eat anything.

I liked this better than my husband did. I reduced the sauce for 30 minutes (not 3 minutes as stated in the recipe) to obtain 3/4 cup. I then added the brandy and whipping cream. This made a more flavorful, concentrated sauce with gravy like (instead of water like) consistency. I also liked this better the next day heated up for lunch...the flavors had melded together better.

An absolutely terrific chicken "pie" for family or company. I'm passing this one on to my Mom.

There was way too much work involved given the mediocre look and taste of the final product. I had to reduce the sauce for twice the amount of time that the recipe indicated and it still never reached a nice sauce consistency until the next day when I heated up the leftovers.

I thoroughly enjoyed Chicken Normandie but I use a rather different version of this recipe. First I do not use potatotes. Why add more starch? Forget the flour, we're looking for flavor. Also, do not use parsnips or peas. I fry the chicken, it is not a casserole. Second, I use Calvados instead of the apple juice/brandy combination. It provides a much better flavor. Take 4 boneless chicken breasts (with skin or without, I use skins to add flavor) and begin frying them in a skillet using olive oil, with a teaspoon of thyme and basil (1 of each, add more as your tastes require, I use more of the basil). Add garlic if you wish as well. Add 2 chopped up Granny Smith apples (tarter and tastier than Golden Delicious). Heat it on high until the skin (or exterior, if skinless) is nearly browned, then add 2 tablespoons of calvados. After which, put a lid over the chicken and place the chicken on low heat for about 45 minutes. As the 45 minute mark nears, use an omelette pan to cook 2 cups of mushrooms (choose the type which you enjoy; morels are marvelous but tough to get) in olive oil. Once they are nearly done to your liking, add double cream (2 cups) and heat to very warm. When the chicken is done, add the sauce to the chicken and let it cook for a moment. Then serve the chicken onto plates and spoon the sauce onto the chicken. Now that is Chicken Normandy! (Much easier to make - and much more flavorful - than the recipe listed above.)

Too much work and not enough flavor. Part of the problem was that I had to bone and skin my own chicken which involved a lot more work than I wanted. I expected the sauce to have a better flavor and was disappointed when it didn't. Probably won't go through it again.

I was also disappointed in this recipe. It was a lot of work, for so-so results. I was expecting more flavor. My husband, who usually raves over all most everything I prepare, said he hoped I didn't fix this again.

I thought this recipe was great! It's a little time consuming to make, but well worth the effort. I reduced the sauce to 3/4 to 1 cup instead of 1 1/4 cups, making it more flavorful and delicous. I also floured the chicken more than the directions specified which called for more butter for frying. This is a great do-ahead dish!

I was also disappointed with this recipe. It was a lot of work and definately not worth it. The sauce was too watery and didnt have the flavor I anticipated.
