I must have done something wrong, but my sauce did not turn out light and frothy . . . but the flavor was good. Great for a soup base, though.

This was outstanding. The chicken made an excellent lunch. Thanks for the soup tip.

This can also be diluted with more chicken broth to be made into a wonerful coconut soup. With 2 minutes left to serve, just as some sliced button mushrooms and scallions. The flavors are better than those found in most Thai restaurants I've tried.

This sauce is excellent. I made it several times and it never ceases to amaze me. I made it with the pistachio sea bass...Wonderful dish.
