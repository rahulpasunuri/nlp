This is SO GOOD. I followed the recipe except for a few changes: I used chicken stock because it's what I had. I used the juice of a whole lemon, which might've been more than 2 T. I wasn't sure if the 8 oz of potatoes was a measurement of weight or volume, but I ended up using about 1.25 cups. As others have mentioned, the lentils were a little firm, but not unpleasantly so. Next time I would cook them an additional 5 mins or so. The potatoes were perfectly tender. For meat-eaters, this would be amazing paired with grilled chicken and tzatziki sauce.

Delicious flavors and healthy too! I didn't have quite enough mint on my plant, but it was great with only a couple of tablespoons. Crumbled leftover ricotta salata on top instead of feta. Yum! I don't think it needed too much extra in the way of broth--maybe only a half-cup or so unless you really want it soupy.

This is really delicious. I added carrots and onions (because why not). I also happened to have a Morrocan spice mix in my cabinet that I had never used before, so I added about three teaspoons. I didn't happen to have cayenne pepper, so I used crushed red pepper. The result was so unbelievably good. I think the take away is that this recipe is very adaptable to alterations depending on what is available in your spice cupboard. Don't leave out the lemon. It really balances the other flavors out so as not to make it too earthy. This recipe is so good, especially for a healthy and inexpensive meal that provides plenty of leftovers.

I found this recipe looking for a use of cooked lentils. The ingredient & flavor combination is what I got from this recipe. Help from reviewers, specifically the advice to not hold back on the lemon or the mint, is what I needed to make a delicious dish. Experienced cooks will probably have good results but the the recipe itself is not a 4-forker. Red-skinned potatoes are about the fastest-cooking kind so be careful with substitutions. It has not been my experience that raw dry lentils will cook to tender in a 10-minute boil and a 15-minute uncovered simmer. Pre-soaked, yes. I wouldn't advise anyone to follow the preparation instructions 100% exactly as written; as usual it is best to incorporate your own judgement.

This was easy and delicious! Like several others, I added some extra veggies to stretch it out (sliced onions, carrots, celery), and several additional cups of stock. Didn't have any mint on hand, but added extra lemon juice and it really made this dish pop! Didn't even need the feta! Very hearty and got several meals from this. Will definitely make this a regular in the rotation!

Fast, easy, EXCELLENT recipe! No tinkering needed... although I, who was born in beirut and weened on lebanese cuisine, prefer more lemon and mint which is easy enough to add at the last minute per taste. Note: Don't omit lemon juice... it is integral to the balance.

Yum! Easy, healthy, comfort food. Just be careful to cut the potatoes small enough. Mine were still a bit crunchy at the end of the cooking time and I was afraid the lentils would turn to mush if I extended it.

This is a good base recipe that will be fun to experiment with. I made this with plain dried brown lentils, added carrots and onions, as some previous posters suggested. Also used a little more lemon juice, as others suggested, but I don't care for the sweetness this adds to the dish, so I may omit it altogether next time. When I tasted it before adding the lemon juice, it was very savory and flavorful. I also used kale instead of spinach, as some others suggested. Even with these tweaks, I found that the recipe's suggested amount of broth and cooking time worked well.

Played with it a bit too...Not a vegetarian, so I used chicken stock, added carrots and onion, and grilled some chicken breasts with tumeric, salt, pepper, garlic and lemon. Threw those in and it was a big hit. Also added some sweet potatoes and kale instead of spinach. Big hit.

I wasn't so sure about lemon in lentil soup but this recipe was terrific. I added some onion and carrot like some of the other reviewers did. I also used 4 cups of vegetable broth and ended up adding another cup towards the end of cooking. Forgot about the mint and feta but the soup was flavorful even without them.

This is a delicious, hearty stew perfect for a cold fall or winter night. I followed all the proportions in the recipe but it took an hour to cook and I had to use 4 cups of vegetable broth instead of 3 and it makes 4 servings, not 2 as stated. I used sweet potatoes instead of red and swiss chard instead of spinach, but think it would be equally great as written. I'll definitely make it again.

For a meatless dish, this is an exceptionally flavorful stew. I am giving it a 4-rating because most lentil stews without meat taste very bland and icky, but this was refreshing, lemony, and great. Like many others, I added onions and carrots. Otherwise, followed according to instructions.

I love this recipe. I'm a vegetarian and it's part of my regular rotation. It's inexpensive and healthy and delicious. I make the following changes: 1) I pare the lemon and chop the peel roughly instead of grating it; 2) I roast small new potatoes in the oven with a bit of olive oil and sea salt and serve them alongside the stew; 3) I sprinkle a few toasted pine-nuts on top in place of feta. The pine-nuts go spectacularly with the flavours of lentil and lemon!

Is it fair to rate a recipe if one does not follow it exactly? But if I would rate it, I would give it 4 stars. I added a large chopped carrot, some chopped onion and used a high quality vegetable stock in place of the broth. I added a dash of garam masala too. I had some preserved lemons on hand, so I dropped one right in the stew and allowed it to break down some. I did not use the mint, but did add the feta at the end. Oh so yummy!!!!

I gotta admit, I was skeptical -- it seemed like a recipe for blandness. Nuh-UH! It's tasty and incredibly cheap to make. Like other reviewers, I had to cook the heck out of it -- 20 minutes for the lentils alone and about 25 more for the lentils and potatoes. I used my own veggie stock and kale instead of spinach (which I should have ripped up a little more, but whatevs). A really nice, hearty dish.

Rating: 2
After reading the other reviews, I wanted to like this more than I did. It was fine but didn't knock my socks off. I used a homemade vegetable broth that I happened to have and so had to add a lot of salt and it still lacked oomph. Added some carrot and onion as advised in previous reviews. Lemon came through nicely, mint a bit less. I doubled the recipe (and had to add extra water) and ended up with a LOT of soup. That feeds four people? Four burly lumberjacks who've been chopping wood all day, maybe.

usually when i make lentil soup it turns out not very tastey. but this recipe is soo good (and easy!). i added in onions and carrots, as suggested, and omitted the lemon and mint. in addition to the broth, i added about 8 cups of water (plus a couple extra spices) and it turned out deliciously. also, the potatos and carrots took a little bit longer to cook over med-low heat.... about 45 min (not 15).

Absolutely delicious, extremely satisfying, especially on a cold night. I add a lot more spices, though, including plenty of the following: cumin, curry powder, five spice powder and a touch of cinnamon and even nutmeg. Scratch the fresh spinach. Save yourself time and money and use chopped frozen spinach.

This was the second dish of our new weekly Monday night dinner event. This was definitely tasty, but we decided that it could totally use some additions. Next time we plan to add some chickpeas. Also, the kale is a great suggestion, but next time we'll slice it up in strips so it's easier to eat. We also plan to use red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne. Overall, this was delicious and it was so easy to make. The mint and lemon flavors really come through and it was indeed a delight.

I followed others' advice and added carrots (with the potatoes) and onions (with the garlic). The mint and lemon are great. The lentils took longer to become tender than stated. My main suggestion is to add the spinach to your bowl and let it wilt, rather than add it to the soup pot, where it will fall apart with repeated reheatings, etc (I doubled it). Or as others say, use a heartier green like kale.

Tasty comfort food, great for a weeknight dinner. Per other posters' suggestions, I doubled the recipe, substituted kale for spinach and doubled the lemon juice, which worked out well. Next time, I'll probably cut the potatoes into 1" cubes instead of 1/2". I served it with toasted whole wheat pitas and tomato wedges. It would also be good with a yogurt dip, such as tzatziki.

I doubled the recipe and decided to add some chopped eggplant and an 8 oz can of tomatoes. I ended up using two full lemons worth of juice.

This is my comfort food. I make it a lot, as it's so delicious, warming and healthy. I've even pureed it to use as a first course and garnished it with fresh mint and feta. Simple, fast and wonderful every time. I've taken to using Kale in place of spinach as it retains its structure better and adds texture. I also add quite a bit more broth (it can get too pasty) and lemon juice as I like the zip of acid. Serve with white Burgundy for added deliciousness.

I made this for friends and it was a hit. I added onion (w/ the garlic) and carrot (w/ the lentils) and substituted kale for spinach. I made it a day early, which was good because it does take 25-30 minutes to cook instead of 15. The lemon flavor really comes through for a nice change of pace and the cayenne is just enough to liven it up without causing distress to the pepper-sensitive.

This is one of my very favorite recipes. It is a great, quick, go-to that always satisfies. It has a nice balance of flavors and pleases everyone. I always end up adding at least a cup more stock or I find the dish can become too pasty. I also add a lot more lemon because I love the flavor along side the sweet lentils. I've started using kale instead of spinach too, as it keeps its texture better upon reheating. A great meal (veggie stock) for when vegetarian friends come to visit!

The lemon adds a nice twist to lentils. I added onions but otherwise followed the recipe. The feta cheese at the end is key as the saltiness plays well against the acidity of the lemon. I'd even top it off with some more mint. Very good!

This is a good, different take on lentils. It is one of the only lentil recipes where I haven't felt the need to add different spices.

I would recommend this as a flavorful, unique, and healthy recipe.

This recipe is so simple, but the flavors are so good on many levels. The mint is a wonderful addition. I like how casual it is - easy to troubleshoot. I only had four cups of broth, but wanted to double it, so I just added water and it was still really good. I forgot the feta too, but I have enough left over that I can just pick some up tomorrow. Such a simple dish, but it tastes like something I'd order at a restaurant. It's one of the best dishes I've ever made.

With a few variations suggested by other reviewers (thank you), this turned out to be the best lentil dish ever. I added about 3/4 teaspoon each of dried thyme and cumin (you could do more) and a can of diced tomatoes. This was for a doubled recipe. I used half the spinach, because that's all I had, and I thought it was enough. Wow. The flavors just popped. I think the original recipes could feed three easily and 4 if smaller appetites. One bowlful is very filling and is well balance nutritionally. And, it has about 24 grams of fiber! What a deal. Delicious and nutritious. If every vegetarian recipe I tried were as tasty as this, I'd convert!

With a few tweaks from past reviewers, this was the best lentil stew I ever had. I added some dried thyme and ground cumin,about 3/4 tsp. each for a doubled recipe and a can of diced tomatoes. Also cut back on the cayenne by half. Suggest starting with half and moving up to suit your taste. The flavor just popped. I agree that this is enough for 3 hungry people or 4 with smaller appetites. I had a generous bowl and was full, but I wanted to keep eating. This is a very balanced dish nutritionally and meets about 2/3 of my daily fiber requirements. What a deal, and delicious, too. If all the vegetarian dishes I ate were as tasty as this one, I would consider becoming one! My husband agrees--he had two helpings.

This is an amazing recipe. I double it and add cubed leg of lamb. Doing this increases the cooking time, as I let it simmer until the lamb is tender, but it is well worth the time. It makes enough for several meals. I freeze it in portions for 2 and use when I need a quick dinner. I usually serve it over rice.

I really did not enjoy this stew. I used low-sodium broth and found it absolutely bland (perhaps all the flavour comes from the salt?). I had to double the citrus, and then ended up adding a whole whack of cinnamon, cumin and a dash of vinegar to try to add some zip. I appreciated the healthiness of it, but won't be making again.

I made this last night and it turned out very well, which is saying a lot since I am a terrible cook. I doubled the receipe since I was cooking for 4 (two kids), but that was not necessary. I had to estimate the potatoes (does everyone else have a scale in their kitchen???) and didn't use as much spinach (I used one big bag of pre-washed). I added a bit more of the spices - more white wine vinegar, more cayenne, and a LOT more salt. The mint is important to give it some flavor (it doesn't really taste "minty" at all, though), as is a generous topping of feta cheese.

Holy-moly! I was skeptical as I was cooking, but this dish is absolutely outstanding. This will become a staple for my family. I added extra potatoes and therefore extra broth, and it worked perfectly. The country's current Spinach issues forced me to use Kale, which was delicious! I can't imagine Spinach in there, but will use it next time to taste the difference. The Kale added a great dimension of texture. This will be a great dish on cool Autumn nights. I would pair it with a fabulous White Burgundy-- something rich like Mersault.

Pay no attention to the naysayers -- this is wonderful stuff! The recipe calls for just enough lemon and mint to make the stew intriguing. Can't imagine why anyone would skip the mint; the mint is genius. I used tiny French lentils and soaked them first, following the advice of another reader. They quickly turned to mush when I cooked them, but the lack of texture from the lentils didn't make the end product taste any less wonderful. This is easy, healthy, and a real treat with crusty bread.

I left out the mint, because I've got this thing about mint being in anything but chewing gum. Other than that, followed the recipe to the letter. It's wonderful hot (perfect for a cold day), and just as wonderful lukewarm (perfect for a warm day). Will definitely make this again.

I've been making this for almost four years now and I recently invented a nice variation which makes it taste better while at the same time enhances the presentation. I add a teaspoon of cuminseeds and instead of just throwing the potato cubes in the pot I fry them separately in sunflower oil until golden brown and pat them dry. I serve them on top of the stew which makes the dish look less 'swampy'. And of course everybody likes fried potatoes.

It's outrageously delicious (SO flavorful, extremely good for you, inexpensive to make, and produces fab leftovers). I always make a double batch, but otherwise make it exactly as written. Lots of lovely feta on top makes this dish sublime. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

This could be my favorite epicurious recipe. I've made it over and over, always a double batch. If you like lentils, this is a knockout. If you don't like lentils you probably aren't going to like any lentil soup. I cannot imagine anyone finding this soup bland. I find the flavors really pop, and that they are bright and fresh flavors that allow the soup to be satisfying and light at the same time. I would not recommend omitting the mint or feta that might make the soup bland. Those flavors, along with the lemon, are what make this soup, otherwise it is just a bowl on lentils and potatoes. Oh, and I add chopped onions with the garlic...about 1/2 cup.

I was a little skeptical at first that this dish wouldn't be tasty enough. I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't add the mint (and didn't think of the tea bag), and I substituted a bit of curry for the cayenne (didn't have any). Although I'm not the biggest fan of lemon, the addition of the juice is welcome in this recipe. Good with feta, but equally as good without (in my opinion!) Very tasty.

I've been making this for years, a big fave. But you have to like Greek flavors: lemon, garlic, feta . . . I serve it with pita bread and either chicken or seafood, or sometimes even meatballs.

A delicious and satisfying vegetarian entree. I used French green lentils which I find stay whole and don't turn to mush. I added 1 cup of crushed tomatoes and some onions. Both the green lentils and the addition of tomato helped the dish look more appetizing. The timetable in the recipe is off; I find lentils take a bit longer than 25 minutes, and I added more vegetable broth because it seemed dry. Overall, a definite keeper for our vegetarian repetoire.

As suggested, I added 1 tsp dried thyme, a medium chopped onion, and used a 10-oz pkg of baby spinach. Didn't have carrots but had 16" of snow, so did without them!? Feta is indeed essential, as are toasted pitas. Great and healthy!

This is without doubt the best vegetarian dish I ever made! Meat is definitely superfluous in this dish; the potatoes together with the feta cheese (which is certainly not an option, it definitely needs it!) are a very hearty combination. And through the use of mint and lemon it's also really fresh. However, one demerit: it looks a bit muddy and swampy, not exactly a party dish!

This is one of the rare soup recipes that you can serve to a man for dinner and he won't be hungry afterwards. Some variations that I do: use regular russet potatoes (peeled), add 1 tsp of dried thyme, use a block of frozen chopped spinach (more convenient---I toss it in when the recipe calls for the spinach and let it defrost in the pot). I omit the mint (we're not fans). This is a standard I will use over and over again.

I've made this twice now, and while I'd probably make it again because my boyfriend likes "peasant food," it's definitely not the best lentil dish I've ever had. The cooking time is grossly inaccurate (I've never gotten lentils tender in less than an hour). I know simplicity is the key here but I still think it needs something--I added a little cumin but I should have added more. I also should have used two lemons since I upped the lentils and potatoes a bit. And it seemed like I had to add tons of salt. Anyway, I think it's good overall (good for vegans, without the cheese); it's very low-calorie but very filling--as my boyfriend said, "as hearty as it gets without being meat."

Recipe needs adjusting: 1/2 pieces of potato will NEVER become tender simmering for 15 minutes. I suggest returning the heat to medium for this part of the process. Also, this is way more than 2 servings: I increased the recipe by 50% and that easily results in 5 or 6 servings. Increasing by 50% I substituted the following: 3 CANS veggie broth and a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach. Also, fresh herbs can be hard to come by hear so I used 1 and a half tablespoons dried spearmint. Finally, I garnished with non-fat plain yogurt, instead of feta. My gut feeling is this may be even better reheated -- I will find out in a day or two ;)

OUTSTANDING!!!!!! and easy! What a pleasant surprise. I wasn't sure this would be flavorful, but it was JUST RIGHT! and like a previous reviewer mentioned, not one ingredient overpowered the other. Well-balanced, easy and DELICIOUS! We are looking forward to leftovers tonight (and it's so easy I may make more)!

I made this recipe because my doctor told me to add fiber to my diet, not because I wanted to eat spinach and lentils. I was surprised to find how wonderful the flavors blended. This was great on a cold winter night and I'll definitely make it again.

This was an extremely tasty and hearty stew- one of the best recipe's I've made from epicurious. I did not need to modify the ingredients or portions in any way. The lemon, pepper, and mint were nicely balanced; each was uniquely identifiable, yet complimentary, not too subtle, but not overpowering. The tomato and cucumber salad (with feta, and light Annie's Goddess Dressing) was an excellent accompaniment. I can't wait to eat the leftovers for dinner tonight!

Very tasty dish. I used french lentils and added some chopped carrots for color. The flavors of this dish were very pleasing. Be sure to use a good feta for the best flavor.

Upon first taste I wasn't certain and it was too hot(heat) to truly get the flavors. After letting it sit in the bowl for a minute or two I savored and enjoyed every drop. Perfect winter stew.

Very very good -- more like 3.5 forks. I used all the zest and juice from a small lemon, and almost a cup of fresh mint -- so tasty and wholesome. I actually didn't have any vegetable broth, so I sauteed 5 garlic cloves and sweated a sliced onion, and deglazed the pan with some flavorful homemade chili, garlic, and rosemary vinegar. It turned out fine. I agree that the feta is necessary to lift the other flavors. This made about a pint more stew than two of us could eat! I decided to freeze it -- we'll see how that works. I will make this again and again and again...

First I have to start by explaining that my wife is very mean and sneaky. You see, I don't like lentils nor do I like spinach. She forced me to eat this (I really shouldn't go into details as to how as this is a family site.) As it turned out, I did like it considering the ingredients. The feta is not "optional" rather it is essential. Thank you.

This is an excellent recipe. The flavours are unusual --- you can really taste the lemon and the mint. I used baby spinach and the result was absolutely delicious. Will DEFINITELY make this again.

What a terrific recipe! It has all the essential elements--delicious, nutritious, easy, and inexpensive. The feta really adds a lot, and goes beautifully with the mint and lemon flavors of the stew. Delicious.

All the reviews were so positive, but I just didn't like this dish. It is blah and tastes wierd I think. I did eat leftovers for lunch, but I wouldn't make it again.

This was a delicious and filling dish - even better than I expected it to be. My husband even loved it and he's usually not fond of bean dishes. The feta is a must! It's going in our recipe box.

Basic comfort food with a lttle oomph from the feta. I served cucumber, onions and kalamata olives in vinagrette to compliment the dish.

Tried this with a group of friends as a quick supper; it wasn't as "Mediterranean" as we had expected, and but the flavor was great. We used a sheep and goats' milk cheese from Cyprus instead of the feta; I agree that cheese complements it well.

This stew was sooo good. I didn't have vegie broth so I used chicken and it turned out great. I will try it with veg.broth next time for my vegetarian friends. The feta is a must.

This is a magnificent dish that is easy to make but holds very complex flavours.

This has become a standard favorite in our household...one of my husband's favorite dishes. It's fairly quick and easy to prepare as well. I strongly recommend using feta as the topping.
