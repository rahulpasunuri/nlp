Loved this recipe! Made it yesterday for my mom's birthday. Recommend baking the cake day before decorating. Think I'll use 8 inch pans next time, and I know the 7 minute frosting is supposed to be like the marshmallows in an ambrosia salad, but I think I'll use a Swiss meringue buttercream instead of 7 minute frosting (7 minutes-hah!)

i made this for Christmas dinner as I wanted a special dessert. If you follow the recipe precisely (and I agree with the earlier reviewer about cake flour and fresh baking soda), you will bake a delicious and unusual cake. I think it's the perfect amount of sweetness, it's not cloying. Yes, it does take some effort, but it's worth it taste-wise and looks-wise!

Thanks for the great recipe. Just tried it and it came out awesome!

The cake was delicious, the filling tasty and the frosting divine. However, I don't think they went together very well. I felt the cake was too heavy for the light tasting curd and fluffy frosting. A lighter cake recipe would have suited me better.

This cake is wonderful!! I made it for Easter brunch so I had to make it in advance and it turned out terrific. I baked the cake and made the filling on Friday; made the frosting and assembled the cake Saturday. I had no problems whatsoever with the cake not being high enough as some have mentioned. Also, the day I made the frosting it was raining - I added a 1/4 tsp of cream of tarter and I ended up with a marvelous, fluffy frosting. Other than that, I didn't change a thing with the recipe.

Great cake! I deceased the sugar on the frosting and filling by 1/4 cup. Friends and family loved it.

Wowee Zowee. If you are drawn to this cake, by all means, make it! I found so much of this recipe to be intimidating: citrus curd, stove-top made marshmallow/meringue type frosting, cakes that may or may not rise, and "pressing coconut into the frosting," which sounded incredibly messy. None of my fears proved to be right. In fact, I am a novice cake maker, and this is only the second time that I have ever made a cake from scratch. It turned out wonderful-- I followed the recipe to a T. The layers were thick and airy, though I too found that it needed 30 minutes instead of 20-25. I made it for a tropical fruit nut, so I also added one layer of mango and one layer of pineapple to the curd layers. And yes, it was easy to "press the coconut" into the frosting on the sides, just use a light touch. It is a day-long process, so you better enjoy baking to make it!

Great flavor in this cake. The coconut gives it a really nice touch. I had trouble with the cake layers. The cake just did not rise so I was unable to slice it in half to have four layers. I just did two layers. I think, next time, I will use a piece of parchment paper to line the pans.

A really really sweet cake. The filling and the frosting were a bit too sweet for me.

Wonderful!! I made this recipe into cupcakes to suit the occasion. I still used the filling and just injected it in with small pastry tip and bag right through the top since the frosting covered that. They were excellent!! Definately better the second day after everything had a chance to sit together overnight. Very moist and can't wait to make it again! It was a huge hit with everyone!!!

Wow! Made it for my mother's birthday - everyone loved it! Filling is tangy - cake is even better the second day!

This was an absolutely beautiful, yummy cake. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that it was time consuming (but it seems like a lot of from scratch baking, with filling and frosting, etc. is). I don't know that it is any more time consuming than any other layer cake one might make, however. I really loved the frosting though - some other reviewers did not. Apparently seven minute frosting is a classic (didn't know this) - my mom learned how to make this in home ec in high school in the early 60s, and my grandma used to make cakes with this frosting all the time. It is super sweet, fluffy and covers any lumps and bumps you might have made in your cake really well. I will probably hang onto the frosting recipe to use on other cakes. I would absolutely use fresh orange zest in the filling and the cake - don't substitute that stuff in the jar. That is what makes it especially good (besides the frosting). Made this to bring to an Easter dinner and everyone loved it, even the chocoholics. Every bite served was gone. It's a great "spring-y" cake for any occasion this time of year.

haven't tried this, but will...just wanted to say to LENJC from New Haven, CT ---Thankyou Thankyou...I cut and pasted your sage advice...will think of you often and well !!! Just what I needed to hear with my novice-self. New to cake baking, but have great interest (love those podcasts too!). I have a great recipe for chocolate buttermilk cake, but find that it is a bit dry and could really be a bit higher, I bet I am overmixing. Will try the cake flour tip too...I guess cake flour could never be wrong, right?

Best Cake Ever! My daughter and her boyfriend made this cake yesterday (they like to cook together) and it took A LONG TIME. But it is so good. If you have a special occasion or just want to spend time baking, I highly recommend this one.

This cake was a bit of work, but worth every second! I followed the recipe and was rewarded. Plus, the coconut topping completely disguised my ugly frosting job.

I didn't make the cake, but I did make the frosting. I reduced the amount of sugar to slightly less than 3/4 cup, and kept the rest of the recipe the same -- it's still waaaay too sweet. The texture is fine, kind of poofy but not what I'd call fluffy or billowy, but I think I'd much rather make a whipped cream and serve it on the side.

Fantastic, well worth the time to make it. The filling was great with the lemon and orange juice. The frosting was the best. The cake was part of gift for a bridal shower it was enclosed in the cake holder. It was enjoyed by all.

I made this cake for my brother's birthday and it was a great hit. I'd definitely make it again, despite it being so time consuming (about 3 and 1/2 hours) - it's worth the time and effort. After reading some of the reviews here I was concerned about not having cake flour, but my cake came out moist and fluffy, despite having used all purpose flour instead. It did take a bit longer to bake; mine took about thirty minutes. The filling is also delicious and quite lemoney. But my favorite part of this recipe has to be the frosting. I am amazed and delighted to see egg whites and a bit of sugar turn into velvety marshmallow goo! Yummy!

Just wanted to offer a few suggestions to the cooks whose layers didn't bake up tall enough to split. Stick with cake flour; it's used for a reason--it has less gluten which makes for a tender cake. AP has more gluten and can therefore hinder rising. Don't overbeat either, as that will only develop more gluten strands and again hinder rise. And sift that flour--it makes for a smoother batter, easier mixing, and introduces a bit of air into the batter which can also be thought of as a leavener! Also, be sure that your leavening agents are fresh. When you buy baking powder, mark the date on it. In 6 months, toss it and buy fresh-- it loses potency the longer it sits on the shelf, so use it as fresh as possible to get a good rise. Finally, get your batter panned and into the oven as soon as possible. Time spent sitting on the countertop will also cause your leaveners to lose potency. Most begin to develop their CO2 as soon as they are combined with liquid, so you can see that the longer it sits on the bench, the more CO2 is lost to the air instead of helping your layers to rise. Hope that helps!

This was a delicious cake, though as others have said, very time consuming. I didn't really care for the frosting, which as I was mixing I kept thinking, "this can't be right- it looks like melted marshmallow", until I realized, (duh) that this was the marshmallow component of Ambrosia. The filling and the toasted coconut were delicious! The cake itself was light and moist and so flavorful. So if I made it again I might omit the frosting altogether. Or maybe use another kind? Any suggestions? I did cut the layers in half so I could use all of the filling--I think it would work better if you use a knife that's longer than the cake diameter. I didn't do a very good job, but was able to cover the mistakes with frosting/coconut.

I made this cake for an Easter dinner party and it was such a success! Yes, it was time consuming, but well worth the effort. I garnished the base of the cake with thin orange slices and whole strawberries for extra umpfff.

This cake is delicious! The zest really provides the most incredible moist citrus taste and makes this cake worth the time it took to make it. My layers were not tall enough to cut in half, either, although I did use cake flour and did follow the recipe precisely. Would beating the batter longer help with this?

I made this cake to celebrate my 30th birthday and cannot recommend it highly enough! The cake was light and moist (I used Swans' Down cake flour), the citrus filling was delicious, and the frosting with the coconut made a beautiful presentation. The cake was nicely done at the full baking time (I checked first at 20 mins) and the frosting set up without trouble (I think the reviewer below may have misunderstood, as it sounds like he/she expected the frosting to set up on the stove WITHOUT beating it at the same time). Anyway, YUM. Make this cake!

While the overall flavors were good, there were a couple of issues-layers were a bit dry, frosting never stiffened over double boiler - we put it back under the mixer and beat it at a high speed - the bowl stayed hot. Took probably double the time, and we added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Filling was delish, but overall, a lot of work for not an *outstanding* result.

I made this for Christmas and though I had a lot of problems with it, it was delicious! First of all, my layers were really thin -- there was no way I could have slice them in half. I didn't have cake flour, so I read that you could substitue all-purpose if you adjusted the amount, which I did. I don't know if that was what caused my flat layers...The filling was really easy but the frosting never really got stiff enough and sort of dripped off the cake. Luckily, the coconut hid everything! The upshot: I would make it again, if I could make it perfectly. Everyone loved it, but I think that it is a huge effort if it's not going to come out right. The tase was three forks but the time and effort and margin for error makes it only two.

I made this cake for Christmas Eve and it was quite delicious. It was very light and looked exactly like the photo. My only criticism is that I would have liked more filling between the layers. Perhaps next time I will make 1.5 x the amount of filling. Definitely worth the effort if you enjoy layer cake.

Although this takes forever to make, I can't say enough good things about this cake. This dish was the standout of all my holiday dishes by far. Everyone of my guests said it was one of the best cakes they've ever had. Despite the painstaking effort, I encourage everyone to make it.
