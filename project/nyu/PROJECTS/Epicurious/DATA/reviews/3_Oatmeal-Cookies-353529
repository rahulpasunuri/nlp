As others noted, these are more cakey than chewy, oatmeal cookie- like, but still good - but only 3 forks as the texture is different, and the recipe does not explain that. The point of this baking exercise was to use up some trail mix. I used half as mush Splenda as white sugar, and the trail mix had peanuts, sunflower seeds, hazelnuts, chopped dred apricots and dates as well as raisins, which added flavor, besides the extra dose of nutmeg and cinnamon I added upon reading these other reviews. I baked these for my family to take on a fishing trip, and although I am condcerned they might not hold up as well, they will still be devoured.

I am making these cookies now. After tasting the first batch of cookies I was disappointed with the flavor....so much that I began to add my own creativity to the mixture as it is as the reviews say " dry and unflavorful ". What I did was to add molasses to the mixture, prunes and fresh dates to the mixture to get some fresh sweetness. The latter batch of cookies will go to my friends as a token of my love and appreciation.

I added walnuts to the recipe with satisfying results. A very tasty cookie!

These cookies are easy to make. They have a light, cake like texture. Also, the batter seemed very runny and spread out when I put it on the first pan. But, it thickened after about 10-20 min. The cookies on the first pan turned out the same as those on the last pan. I would not make them again because: 1. I did not like the texture 2. they were not sweet enough

These were ok. More like flat muffins than cookies.

I'm giving this two forks because it says it's healthy and low-fat when it is neither. At 4g of fat per 110 calories, that's 33% fat. I really wanted a healthy(ish) oatmeal cookies so I used all whole wheat flour, replaced the oil with apple sauce and halved the sugar. I'd say they're still not exactly "healthy" but they have a lot of good fiber. They came out nice and cake-y and just sweet enough to satisfy a craving without a major sugar rush. Next time I would lightly oil my cookie sheets, because with no fat in the dough they did stick just a little bit.

I agree with the other reviewers re that amount of sugar. I may have cut back too much, but I never follow recipes exactly...I used applesauce instead of oil, added nutmeg, chocolate chips, pecans and walnuts. I also used dried cherries instead of raisins. So, a different cookie, I admit, but I love not using butter, etc.

This is a very light cookie. Very good but I love my Oatmeal cookies chewy. I did add a touch more of Cinnamon and brown sugar. Overall, very good

These cookies turned out great. We used Splenda instead of white sugar (using the Splenda baking mix package -- the one that matches 1 to 1 with sugar measurements.)
