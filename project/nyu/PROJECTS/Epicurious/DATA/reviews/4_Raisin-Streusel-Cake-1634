This recipe is so good, I'm considering making it even after Passover is over. I add chopped apples to the batter and then in the middle where the streusel goes, I add some sliced apples. So delicious. I put the raisins underneath the top cinnamon/sugar layer, so they don't burn. I have only made it "dairy" with butter and table cream, but I'm sure it's still good with margarine and non-dairy creamer. I've already made it twice for this Passover, and I think it will become a must-have for years to come.

I have been making this since 1992 when it first appeared. This is a great homemade kosher for Pesach coffee cake.My family loves it.I might try some variations from other reviewers this year.

I made a dairy version of this cake to have for breakfast during the holiday. It was great! I used butter and cream. I used regular matzo meal and brown sugar for the streusel and did not bake any of it. I used cinnamon only. I used a mixture of raisins and chocolate chips in the middle. Baked exactly 40 minutes. This was an excellent Passover treat!

Here I am updating this recipe once more. First off, I use a slightly bigger pan (12 X 10). In an attempt to make the cake a bit healthier, I now use oil in place of the margarine, to avoid transfats, and it works just fine. I have made a few other changes: I make the streusel with dark brown sugar, but only use 1/3 cup. Since Ive never seen cardamom with a kosher for passover label, and cant find the whole spice version in a place Im comfortable in buying to use for Passover, I substitute a variety of other spices, to equal 2 1/2 teaspoons: ginger, nutmeg, and allspice. And I DO NOT bake the streusel. As for changes to the cake, I use orange juice instead of the nondairy creamer, as I think it seems a bit more natural than the chemical mix sold as nondairy creamer. I substitute oil again for the margarine in the cake, and as I said last year, do a 50-50 mix of golden and dark raisins. I also add 1/3 cup broken pecans. In terms of assembly: I make the batter, pour half into the pan, sprinkle half the streusel (unbaked) onto the batter, as well as all of the raisins and nuts. I spread the remaining batter over that, then sprinkle with the other half of the streusel. I havent made it yet for this years holiday, but if I make any further changes which result in a better cake, Ill be sure to report on them!

I wanted to update my review from last year. I made this cake again for Passover this year, and I like it even more; I think it may be one of my favorite Passover desserts ever. This year I did what I said I would last year--I did not bake the streusel separately, but just put half in the middle of cake and the other half on top. I also used a 50-50 mix of golden and dark raisins, and put all the raisins on the inside, so they wouldn't burn on the top, as they did last year. It was really great, incredibly moist, and quite well received!

This cake is an excellent addition to my Passover recipe file. It was very moist and tasty. The baked streusel at the beginning of the recipe did not work so well; after 10 minutes, parts were close to burnt, while the rest was still sugary. Still, once it was put in between the two layers of batter, it worked fine. Next time, though, I think I may skip the step of baking half the streusel and just use unbaked to put in the middle as well as on top. I also left the raisins off the top, as suggested by another rater, as I was pretty sure they would burn.

This was a delicious coffee cake. Great flavor and very moist. I decided to make it dairy and substituted margarine for butter and half&half for the non dairy creamer. The raisins on top of the cake either burned or got crunchy, I will add more to the middle and leave out the top raisins.

Replace cardamom with brown sugar to make a wonderful Passover coffee cake. This is a very good (moist) recipe and has been served every Passover since 1992.
