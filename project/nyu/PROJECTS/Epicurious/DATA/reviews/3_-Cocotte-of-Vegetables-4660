This dish was delicious, colorful, healthy, and easy. I used veggie (meatless) bacon, veggie broth, omitted the peas, and put in extra lettuce/parsnips/radishes/carrots. I'm just starting to make meat dishes with different vegetarian substitutions -- so for any other vegetarians out there who are trying to expand their culinary repertoires, the meat substitutes are easy ways to get more protein. Also, I think they're delicious in a different, non-meaty way.
