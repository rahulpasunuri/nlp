Pretty awful. Way to salty, I like the honey idea, It would have rounded out the flavor. Skip this one.

Made this tonight and it was very tasty indeed. I did add about 2.5 tbs of honey and some sesame oil though as others suggested. I would definitely make this again

Really easy. Good. But not great. It's hard to go wrong with the combination of garlic, 5 spice powder, and chicken. I substituted chicken legs (which I had on hand) baked for 30 minutes at 350 and then broiled for 10 minutes to let the skin crisp. However, as another reviewer mentioned, it was a bit salty and seemed to be missing something to make it pop. I think I'll try this again with maybe a little honey (suggested by other reviewers), a bit of brown sugar, or perhaps a little rice wine. Maybe some fresh ginger. I agree that a little something sweet (particularly on wings) might be a good addition.

Excellent! Changes I made: baked it at 400-425F instead of broiling. added crushed red chili flakes & sichuan peppercorns. I don't think this recipe would taste good with the addition of honey.

I was looking for a five-spice marinade for chicken wings and used this one, adding some French honey mustard plus yellow beans sauce to add thickness to the marinade. Marinated wings overnight and grilled them: very aromatic result. The hot-and-sour coleslaw was a perfect accompaniment.

I grilled these instead of frying them, and it must have made a world of difference because my husband absolutely loved them. My teenager liked them too and she has never eaten wings. Maybe the grill is the secret. I didn't add anything extra at all and the meat almost fell off the bone and was very tasty.

I made this for Christmas and everyone liked it but I wasn't to pleased with the flavor. I wanted to add honey but we didn't have any in the house. I decieded to make it again for the super bowl but found another similar recipe on the food network so combined the suggestions on this page with that recipe. I used 3 tbs of honey, 1/4 cup of soy sauce, mince garlic, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, and for spice some cayne pepper. I baked the wings at 500 degrees for 30 minutes they were crispy on the outside but moist on the inside. The flavor was much better then last time. I'm sure these will be a big hit at my Super Bowl party. It was spice and sweet. With the modification these are the perfect wings!

silly me....I didn't even know that Buffalo's had wings.... This delicious recipe however, is a definite "keeper" in our household.

I have made this dish many times - always with skinless chicken (drumsticks, thighs, etc.) and always great. Very easy and quick, and great flavor. I leave out the salt. I once added honey as has been suggested, and didn't find that it made that much difference, so I usually don't add honey any more. I am going to try the rub next on pork tenderloin.

These were OK. But, there are a few other chicken wings recipes on this site that are much better. So, I probably will not make these again.

Good, not great but certainly acceptable. I will probably make this again and would certainly not hesitate to include it in a batch of wings taken tailgating.

This was really yummy and very quick and easy. I added 1 TBS honey per everyone's suggestions and a little dark sesame oil too. Will definitely make again.

We loved this recipe! I did add honey and a little more soy sauce which I will always do in the future. My husband can't wait until I make them again!

I rubbed the spice mixture under the skin of a whole chicken and roasted it. My husband and I both loved the five-spice flavor, but we felt the chicken turned out salty having both soy sauce and salt. I will make this again and reduce the salt.

To tone the flavor down a bit for my 3 and 5 year old, I added a tablespoon of sake and a tablespoon of sugar. They were licking their fingers and asking for more.

I also added honey and marinated a whole cut up chicken...just 30 minutes..and baked as you would any chicken receipe..very easy and good. (Leftovers made great sliced chicken sandwiches with arugula)

This was a 2 Forker till I added 1 tblspn Soy and 1 tblspn honey. Melt honey, add to rest of ingrediants toss chicken till coated and baked on lined tray till done. Delicious - extra soy and the honey earn it two extra forks.... and I will definately make it again.

You have GOT to be kidding me. How are you going to marinate 3 lb of chicken wings, let alone coat them with less than 6 TEASPOONS of sauce????????? I would like to see the scale that weighs 16 chicken wings at 3 pounds anyway. (Huge chickens???) I made this tonight and used about a pound of wings.......14 wings.....and added about 1/4 cut soy and basted with a little Teriyaki. The suggestion to use garlic powder was a good one, minced garlic would have burned. I will make this again, we love the flavor of 5 Spice which came through nicely.

yessss! i love this recipe! it was a BIG HIT, with my boys. i doubled the recipe and they couldn't get enough!

Garlic powder (I know, GASP) might work better in this recipe as the fresh garlic may quickly burn under the broiler.

With regard to how long and if to marinade, the recipe does state "toss to coat". This makes for a quick last-minute appetizer or light meal.

Since there is only 1 1/2 teaspoons of soy sauce, I doubt you're marinating the chicken at all. It says "toss to coat".

...a bit frustrating...this recipe does not tell one how long to leave the chicken in the marinade...briefly...20 minutes...2hours...what???
