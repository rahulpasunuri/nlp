I thought this was a great basic recipe. I added mushrooms to the enchiladas and it turned out great. Next time I would probably add another jalapeno for a little extra spiciness and definitely serve it with a dollop of sour cream.

I added chicken and sour cream to these enchiladas and it was fabulous!! I also cut back on the green onions and added a little bit of roasted chili (chipotle) salsa to the sauce.

These enchiladas are just OK, being Mexican, I can tell you they have nothing to do with the real thing. For starters, the tortillas have to be fried, and the green tomatillos are to be cooked after they are blended with garlic. I could go ono and on..

I agree that the onion taste in this was overpowering. This is nothing like the mild green sauces I've been served in Mexican restaurants.

Very easy and cheap recipe. I added 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the sauce after blending it and brought it to a boil. I found this gave it a better taste.

I'm sorry to disagree with all the reviewers who liked this, but YUCK! We really hated it. The sauce was far too oniony, and I prepared it exactly as directed. It tastes nothing like the enchiladas with green sauce I have always eaten at family mexican restaurants, growing up in California's San Joaquin Valley. Perhaps this is more "gourmet" but what I was really looking for was "authentic."

This is very good & easy to make, my husband loved it. Next time I'm going to add some chicken.

This was delicious and the fresh, green color has such eye-appeal. I had to make a few substitutions. I had no spinach or green onion, so I used about 6 leaves from a head of green leaf lettuce and yellow Spanish onion with fine results. A nice thing about this dish is that the only fat comes from the cheese and it would be just as tasty with low-fat Jack or Cheddar. I agree with the other reviewers, that some chicken rolled up inside would compliment the fresh taste of this sauce.

I loved the recipe, with a few minor changes: I substituted a whole yellow onion for the green onion (and boiled it with the tomatillos, garlic & jalapeno); I also cooked the sauce for about 10 minutes before assembling the enchiladas. The sauce was wonderful and very versatile--I plan to try it on quesadillas or with chilaquiles.

The recipe was good but I would cut down on the amount of garlic in the sauce. I like garlic but 12 cloves was a lot. Maybe mine were too large so there was more of a raw garlic flavor. I've never made enchiladas before and it was really easy.

I have always wanted to cook with tomatillos and thought this dish was really great. It was very easy, tasted great. Will try it with shredded chicken and a dollop of sour cream next time.

I had a bunch of tomatillos and didn't know what to do with them. This recipe was just right to use them up. Easy and quick to prepare. Next time I'll add some meat.
