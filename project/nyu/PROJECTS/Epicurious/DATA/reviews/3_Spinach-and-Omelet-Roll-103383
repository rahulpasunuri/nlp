This is wonderful. A lot like tomago, but with the added kick of the spinach filling. Dip in a little wasabi and soy, just as you would sushi.

This recipe is the "da bomb". It's a can't miss money in the bank dish for that important dinner party. Try it and you won't have regrets!!

This recipe is the worst that I've tried from this website. Not only is it time-consuming to make, but the results definitely aren't worth it. Don't waste your time with this one.
