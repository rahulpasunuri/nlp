Made this on Friday for dinner on Saturday, using all Meyer lemon juice. Delicious! Loved the advance preparation, loved the result -- so much so that I just bought a couple bags of Meyer lemons to juice and freeze to make these even when they are out of season.

I made this just as described but substituted creme fraiche for the whipped cream. I think it is a better choice as it is slightly tart and perfect with this great dessert. Lots of praise from my dinner guests.

Super easy and very fresh flavor. Used Meyer lemon for all juice, as well as peel. (Used a Microplane to grate and got more than enough peel from 2 small lemons). Didn't make the whipped cream but next time I might make a Mascarpone cream, as another reviewer suggested, which sounds like it might be a better match than straight whipped cream. Would also like to try a raspberry sauce or the ginger cookies to complement the bright lemon flavor. So quick, easy and everyone enjoyed.

I have made this budio for years. It's the recipe I always give away because guests rave about it. Easy, light and a great finish to a meal. When Meyer lemons are in season I squeeze lots of them and freeze the juice and the grated peel in the amount for one recipe, so I always have it on hand.

Very light and delicious flavor. Do watch how brown it gets. I let my cook a hair too long. This recipe is easy to make and convenient.

Really tasty! I used all meyer lemon juice and zest (from 3 lemons), and baked in a muffin tin. A bit difficult to eat from the tin (didn't anticipate the pudding layer on the bottom), but my husband and I are digging in and enjoying anyway!

This was easy to make, and had just the right intensity of flavor. I will make it again soon!

I was skeptical because the recipe is so simple, but it did not disappoint! I made this with regular lemons, and took it to a dinner party. Everyone licked their bowls clean. I love that I can make this quickly, with little notice, using ingredients that I virtually always have handy.

Beautiful way to end a meal with friends. Made numerous times and meyer lemons make the difference yet sometimes hard to find in suburbia.

My oven cooked this faster than I was expecting after reading the reviews. The puddings got a great golden brown on top, but were over cooked inside leaving only a tiny bit of pudding; the rest of the dish was cake-like. If I make it again I will check the dish at 18 min. I made the lemon whipped cream recipe on this site to help add the creaminess I wanted. It tasted good and was fast to make.

This recipe was lovely. I used Meyer lemons only. Warm, the top was like a soufflé and tasted very lemony. And cold the next day, the texture of the top was almost like a very light cheesecake, and the flavor had developed more of a tangerine flavor. The bottom was like lemon curd. I will definitely make this again, maybe trying different citrus variations. It was so light and easy to make, I can't wait to try it out at my next dinner party.

Easy recipe and fabulous taste. You will need to experiment with baking temps/time to get the perfect pudding at the bottom and slightly browned top. My convection oven cooked this in about 20 minutes, so, watch this as it cooks and remove if the top is browned.

Fabulous. Easy and elegant.

Easy recipe. In my convection oven the dessert was done in 20 minutes so watch them closely if you have convection. We put organic blueberries from a neighbors garden on along with the whip cream. Some Coteaux du Layon dessert wine complemented this to the point of minor ecstasy.

Beautiful, delicious, unique, and impressive. I used Meyer lemon juice for all of the lemon juice. I used some store-bought dried lemon peel for part of the peel. I would have used all Meyer lemon peel, but two Meyer lemons provided more than enough juice, but not 2T of lemon peel. Also, I coated the butter in the ramekins with superfine granulated sugar. I was able to dump the pudding on a plate without losing its shape.

Very elegant dessert made on Easter Sunday and it is a found treasure. Fresh, well balanced and light, I will serve this the next time I have a dinner party.

Phenomenal! delicate, light, the perfect display of meyer lemon flavor. The texture was light and fluffy on top, and lemon pudding underneath. I love this, can't wait to try again with berries on the side.

This is a fantastic recipe...virtually impossible to screw up (it tastes wonderful both on the more cakey and the more pudding-y sides of doneness), and it adapts well to substitutions. I used whole milk, but I'm sure that 2% or skim could be substituted easily without losing much. It was so easy and delicious; I can't wait to make it again and try different toppings (maybe some sort of warm berry compote, or just fresh fruit and whipped cream). Yum!

I decided to add an earl grey infused heavy whipped cream on top with blueberries and the result was spectacular.

I am glad I found this recipe because I have a Meyer lemon tree that produces more lemons that I know what to do with and this is a nice light dessert, perfect for after a heavy meal. Julie

Yum! light and great balance of tang and sweetness. Used regular lemons and increased sugar a bit. Also sprinkled sugar on top before baking. Took a little longer to cook.

I can't wait to find an excuse to make this recipe again! I used regular lemons and 1% milk and it was delicious. Everyone at my dinner party nearly licked their bowls.

So easy I made two batches: key lime and honey mandarin. I found the lime pudding bitter but my guests liked it. I used sweet mini mandarins & substituted one tablespoon of honey for sugar - almost threw it out because the batter tasted cloyingly sweet. Glad I didn't! The finished pudding was not too sweet - true mandarin flavour.

Did anyone else get a bitter result? At first I wasn't going to make the recipe at all because I don't have meyer lemons, but others said they used regular lemons and it came out great. I didn't deviate from the recipe except for regular lemons, and mine came out a nice texture, but bitter. I'll try again, but with meyer lemons.

I love this recipe and will have to make it with Meyer lemon one of these days. I have made it using regular lemons, made it in chocolate, added raspberries or blueberries, made it as margarita budino - all have been easy and come out great. The possibilities are endless.

Excellent dish! The pudding separated to create an almost cake- like top layer with a rich, creamy bottom layer. Easy and fast to prepare. Relatively low-fat compared to other puddings & mousses. I used 2% milk and it came out great. Regular lemons work well too.

This recipe is amazing. I have made it in ramekins and in a full-sized quiche pan and it comes out perfectly every time. Meyer lemons are not always available in NZ, and I find using 100% lemons too tart, so I switch the Meyer lemon juice and peel for good flavoured mandarin (tangerine) juice and peel with delicious results. My new favourite dessert recipe!

i made it with 2% milk, regular lemons, minced rather than grated lemon peel, and in a loaf pan, put it in the oven for 30 minutes and then turned it off and forgot about it for about the next 10 minutes and it still turned out lovely. on account of the loaf pan, presentation left something to be desired but it was so tasty served with ginger cookies and whipped cream. i was worried because the top turned brown about 10 minutes into baking but there was still a nice creamy layer at the bottom. for next time, i will definitely take it out earlier and put it in the oven sooner after adding the egg whites (i waited about 20 minutes and the budino appeared somewhat deflated as it entered the oven). my point is i did is that i was completely disorganized and did all these things wrong and it still tasted beautiful.

This is a fabulous recipe because it is easy, delicious, and is a great use for Meyer lemons. In fact, I've made it for guests twice in the past week, using only Meyer lemons both times.

These came out great... though I agree with other reviewers that the whipped cream wasn't the best companion. You almost need something to counter the intense tartness of the lemon... maybe a ginger cookie? Either way, the budino was easy, elegant, and delicious. Will definitely make again.

It's rather difficult to find Meyer lemons in March in Maine, so I made this with all regular lemons, like some previous reviewers. I also used skim milk. It was delicious and simple to make. I served it hot, with a dollop of whipped cream and a thin lemon slice as a garnish, and my whole family loved it.

Rating: 4
brilliant. I substituted meyer lemon juice for the 2T of regular lemon juice, and used a little less sugar. This made the pudding ever so slightly tart, but this was just perfect served with whipped cream with a pinch of sugar in it.

This is a foolproof, elegant dessert. I could not find meyer lemons and used regular, a little extra icing sugar sprinkled on top after baking took care of some of the tartness. The whipped cream topping is not necessary, but adds to the delicious decadence!

This was the perfect Easter dessert! I was amazed at how easy it went together. Only changes I made was using all Meyer lemon juice and fat free skim milk which it made it very figure friendly. The flavor was scrumptious. This one definitely goes in the keeper file.

I'm a nut about Meyer lemons and they grow well where I live. This recipe is perfect. Easy and satisfying. I made it according to directions, but drizzled fresh raspberry sauce over all and around the plate. Very attractive.

Very good and very easy to make. Will definitely make again. I substituted the whipped cream with whipped mascarpone like it is served at the restaurant. The mascarpone really complemented the budino and did not melt.

This dish is lovely. Light and elegant. Ours came out like a souffle on top with a lemony custard on the bottom. Your guests will think you slaved over a hot stove, but it's actually pretty easy. I used solely Meyer lemons, and the recommendation of whipped cream and berries was perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly except: I added a drop of almond extract to the yolk mixture and instead of adding regular lemon juice, just added more meyer lemon juice (why detract from the star ingredient?)I baked it for 35 minutes, and probably could have added five more minutes for a consistent texture on the inside and a crustier top. The "pudding" was delicious, much paler than the photograph shown, and feather light. Anyone who is imagining creamy custardy pudding should think more along the lines of a fluffy souffle without the eggy flavor. I served it with whipped cream and fresh berries. The lightness of the whipped cream made it a redundant garnish (not enough contrast with the budino) and kind of diluted the lovely texture of the pudding-souffle itself. Next time I will omit the whipped cream and serve with a thin, crispy cookie like a dentelle for texture constrast. If you like more cake-iness in the texture of the pudding-souffle, consider adding 3 tablespoons more flour to the yolk mixture.

Very good-didn't change a thing. Don't overcook or you won't get the pudding in the bottom.

I've made this several times and doubled the recipe each time. Once I was short a few ramekins so I spooned the rest of the mixture into an oven-safe bowl, and left the super-sized budino in the oven a bit longer than the ramekins, and it turned out wonderfully even in the bowl. I like to drizzle the pudding with a mango puree (hint: microwave some mango sorbet until it is runny but not too warm - this makes a quick and easy sauce!) and serve with raspberries alongside. Everyone loves it because it is zingy and not too sweet.

I made this the other night to take to some friends for a dinner party using the last of my Meyer lemons. It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it. I'll be making again with regular lemons and hope it is as good.

I made this for my parents - British background - and they loved it. Only suggestion would be to sprinkle puddings with sugar before baking. I used regular lemons and 2% milk and the puddings were delicious.

I made this one evening. It's fairly easy and it's wonderful. A light, satisfying desert. It's like lemon meringue pie pudding cake. I live in Ohio and we can rarely get Meyer lemons here--and there were none in the store. I used regular lemons, which made it more tart, but it was still excellent. My friend who was at dinner not only requested the recipe, she's already passed it on to other people.
