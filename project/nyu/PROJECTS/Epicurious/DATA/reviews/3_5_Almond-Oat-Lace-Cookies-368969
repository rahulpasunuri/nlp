It never ceases to amaze me, when looking over reviews, the number of people who will say, "well, I changed up the recipe this way and that, and it came out awful, so this recipe is terrible." A suggestion that seems to work for me: try a recipe EXACTLY the way it's written the first time around. After that, you can make adjustments to suit your personal taste. Don't however, say the original recipe is terrible when you've never tried making the way it was written.

I read the reviews before I attempted this cookie, and I'm so glad I did. The dough was easy to make and to work with. The tricky part is the dough really spreads a LOT when you reverse the cookie sheets. First, I used a generous 1/8 tsp. and baked for 4 min. Each side. The cookies came out 1 - 1 1/2 inch in diameter. Next, I used a rounded 1/2 tsp. measure. These cookies came out about 3 in. In diameter after being baked for 10. min.. A few ran together but I separated them right away and they are none the worse for wear. Last, I used the 1 tsp. measure and put only 7 cookies on the Silpat. Silpat is a MUST! These cookies will be between 4-5 inches in diameter. Cookies are delicious, but a bit on the sweet side. I'll definitely brush them with chocolate. They are very thin and brittle, so handle gently. They also ooze butter, so I planning on blotting them, as another reader suggested. I think the cookies are fabulous and I would definitely make them again. They taste bett than similar cookies in bakeries.

I made these cookies on a whim and changed them up a little. I used less sugar in the dough and added some peppermint "snow" (take a hammer to peppermint candy), Everyone loved them. At the time I only had one baking sheet available, and was short on time, so I crammed all the dough balls onto one sheet. The end result was a large sheet of cookie that I broke into jagged pieces and then covered with the choc. and peppermint. I kind of like them better that way. Gives them an edge. Anyway great xmas cookies! looking forward to making them again!

this recipe turned out perfectly gold and crispy, but i reduced the butter to 5 tbs instead of 6 as the previous reviews said, but i don't know why the lost the crispiness the next day, i loved them with chocolate and without, definetly i'll be making these again.

These definitely have potential. The previous reviews helped - we used 1 tsp of "batter" (and yes it is quite crumbly - just make little mounds) and baked for ~8 min depending on how done you want it to be. Two things we will try the next time if we have an occasion to: 1. less sweetener - we found them overly sweet, and 2. perhaps less butter, as it doesn't all really get absorbed into the batter. Overall pretty quick and delicious

This recipe went horribly awry for me but now I see why! In rereading the recipe I see that it says to cook the butter and sugar for 1-2 minutes. However, on my ipad, to which I was referring when making the recipe, it printed as 12 minutes! No wonder. As soon as the mixture cooled it turned into a solid mass, as if I had been making candy. The few cookies I managed to bake were quite tasty. So I will need to make these again before making the final judgement. It is hard to understand why these were tagged as "healthy and lo-cal". With the amount of butter and sugar included, I do not see how this can be true. I did not bother with the chocolate, as they were already so sweet, but again, maybe if I made them properly it would be a good enhancement.

Taste and beauty - 100% awesome. The chocolate in my opinion is optional - a bit of gilding the lily. They are sweet and delicious without it but beautiful and over the top decadent with. They spread! Man they spread. Use half and space them out. And treat them delicately as you lift them off the pan. I used Silpat mats. They freeze really well. Have a toffee-like quality.

I saw this recipe in the Christmas cookie issue of Bon Appetit magazine and thought they sounded wonderful. I made them last night without reading the on-line reviews beforehand (what was I thinking??). Now that I've read them, I agree that 1 tsp is probably a better size for these since they spread out quite a bit. Also WAY too much butter. The "dough" was liquidy even after I added an additional tbsp of flour and oats, and the cooled cookies were sitting in a small pool of butter. I layered them on paper towels to drain, which did help a bit. I probably won't make this recipe again.

I sort of fooled around with this one a bit before I got it right. I ended up using a teaspoon measure on a silpat (really the best way to do it) and spaced them out a lot. Six to a half sheet worked out really well. I was worried when they were done because they were really greasy, but I stored them on paper towels overnight and it completely wicked away all the grease and left me with these delicious thin, crispy, toffee flavored cookies. My uncle, who is a Viennese pastry chef, absolutely loved them and polished off practically half the batch. I would definitely make these again, and I'd encourage others to try them despite the reviews!

I almost didn't try this after all the reviews, but I'm glad I did! I had great success using a 1/4 tsp and cooking for 8 minutes. They are a very light and come together very quickly!

Going to agree with the negative reviews, unfortunately these just didn't taste very good or hold up well. I am not even adding the chocolate to them because every time I pick one up, they crumble. I followed directions, even adjusting the size to make them smaller. I tried parchment and silpat and neither were successful. The taste is okay, not great but the main issue is that they break so they will not hold up in a cookie tin or even getting it to your mouth without it breaking. Not kid friendly!

Heaven! I just love these. I went with the 1 tsp measure, which seemed so tiny, but turned out perfectly. Also used a SILPAT. You can 'reshape' these as they are still malleable until they have chilled.....so I ended up with about a 2-3" round, very sheer cookie. They are delicious!! I skipped the chocolate. So rich as they are, it just seemed superfluous....

Horrible! Waste of my time, money and product. Made exactly as directed, The "cookies" spread out int he oven over the entire pan and became a nasty burnt mess after not even 6 minutes.

These cookies were fabulous. I agree with other reviewers that you should use much less batter per cookie. I experimented with several different sizes and found that I liked a heaping 1/8 teaspoon the best. It made cookies that were just about the size of my palm and they fit nicely into holiday cookie boxes. My family is in disagreement as to whether the chocolate is really necessary. I actually prefer them without. Will be making another batch of these tomorrow.

Awful. When making this, it didn't "feel" like a cookie and the result certainly was not. There's nothing bonding this cookie except for melting sugar so as I tried to form them on the baking sheet I was pushing together small piles of crumbs. It was a frustrating, time-consuming process with the result of a semi-burnt blob that had no appeal at all. The plan was to serve these as part of a Christmas cookie exchange but I was too ashamed to include them.

Great taste. Easy to follow. I agree with the others - use less batter. Mine ended up forming one big layer much to my dismay! I cut them apart when they came out of the oven though. They don't look as pretty as the photo, but they taste great. I will DEFINITELY make them again, but use much less batter. :)

We thought they were excellent. I agree that I probably used less batter per cookie but they didn't stick and were very easy to make. Highly recommend

We decided to make these for the holidays this year because they're similar to my Dad's favorites at Ikea of all places. I didn't think they were too fussy like a previous reviewer said. I will say, do NOT drop them in the size spoonfuls the recipe says, you'll end up with a pan full of spread together cookies instead of nice round ones (honestly, I'd go no more than 1" around when flattened pre-baking). Also, I don't recommend using the parchment they ask for. Buy a sil-pat if you don't already have one. We had to throw out the first batch because they stuck to the paper. Other than that, they were fantastic!!

These are delicious and pretty easy. I've made them a couple times and I would recommend scooping out 1 tsp balls instead of 2 to keep the cookies smaller and from spreading too much. Also let them bake to a dark golden brown. The first time I only let them bake until they were a lightly golden in middle and medium dark on the edges and them came out more chewy than crispy. The darker cookies that I thought I had burnt were the best. Next time I'm going to try making them with a TSP less butter. Each time there was a too much melted butter that would separate from the dough in the bowl.

Pretty fussy, and not worth the effort. Was testing them to determine if we should add them to the family cookie baking day. Flavor-wise they're too much like toffee, and they're way more time consuming. Thumbs down on this one.

Very simple and delicious. They taste like english toffee with a delicate texture. They spread a lot so do give them lots of room on the tray.

Very easy & quick recipe. Fantastic flavor and texture. I added a little vanilla extract & chose semi-sweet chocolate. Amazing!

Awesome cookies! Rich, buttery flavor- just like my grandmother used to make. A bit greasy when you remove them from the parchment paper, but definitly worth every calorie!!!
