While the flavor profile is tasty, it's definitely more work than is necessary. You can skip making the stock - there are quality boxed ones out there. To thicken the sauce, I dredged boneless breasts in flour before sauteing them in olive oil. I set then the chicken aside and proceeded with the sauce, reducing the wine to 1 cup.

This is a nice dish but I had to try this recipe a couple of times before I felt I could write a review. As others have noted, this recipe could be simplified. You can use boneless and skinless thighs and a good, hearty home-made stock. This cuts the cooking time in half, eliminates the need to skim the fat and removes the step of cooling the chicken to strip off the skin and bones. Things that seem essential to the recipe: crush the saffron. I didn't the first time and neither the flavour nor the colour (oddly enough) really came out. And don't forget the lemon. I didn't use it the first time because I was worried it would curdle the sauce. But it doesn't and it adds a real zing to the flavour. The one thing I couldn't bring myself to do either time I made this was to use whipping cream (ick - too rich), so I used half and half and the sauce was just fine. Company, both times I served this, asked for seconds.

OH Mr. Becker-1) Thrilled to see this on the site! I can't make it nearly as well as your wonderful and talented chefs, but it will be a good stop gap between visits back home! 2) have pity on a girl who literally flew home to have Shrimp vin Santo a few weeks ago and post that recipe ASAP!!!! I LOVE this dish as well, it is my second favorite on the menu after your wonderful shrimp! For those of you not from Minneapolis, this is an amazing recipe from one of (if not the) best restaurants in the city. Completely delicious! Try it, you wont be disappointed!

From the other reviews I thought this recipe would be something special. I had problems getting the sauce to thicken once I added the cream at the end, despite boiling it for more than double the time suggested. While I did like the combination of the saffron and basil, I was disappointed with the final runny texture of the sauce that didn't stick to the pasta.

This was so delicious and having only made it once for two people, I would count on it as a reliable company dish in the future. (Nevermind the saffron cost if you had to double or, yikes, triple the recipe.) It was creamy, rich and delicious.

OMG! I can't believe this recipe is here! I order this every time I go to their restaurant and had no idea it was this simple- I am so going to try it at home! It is really delicious people- I was a bit sceptical of milk, saffron, chicken and basil but it is really terrific and not weird- every time I have ordered it I have shared it with another guest and they say they wish they ordered it. Yum! Thank you Chef Isaac and Nancy for sharing! This makes me love BLG that much more!

I made this a few days ago and it was absolute perfection! Pretty easy to make! In my opinion, it tastes even better the longer it is in your fridge. Will be making this again!

I've made this a few times now ... divine. I throw in some sun-dried tomatoes for color and texture.

YUM! I didn't think this was terribly time-consuming, and was so yummy. I used Capellini, since that's what I was in the mood for, and it was a delicious week-night meal. A last minute-find, and since I didn't have saffron, I used some cumin and a dash of curry. The braising was worth doing - texture and flavor were so good. Used drumsticks, since that's what was in the fridge. A keeper!

This is one of the best things I've ever cooked. I feel that except for the paccheri, this recipe calls for normal every-day ingredients, but they just sing when brought together. I love it. For how simple this was to make, the flavors were incredible! It's going to become a staple in our home. Or any time I want to impress dinner guests :) I was looking for the perfect Valentine's day menu... originally planned to do four courses, and so glad I settled on this one-pot meal instead. While the sauce reduced, we ate salads and drank wine. My husband loved this dish, and I got to spend more time sitting with him than in the kitchen. My compliments to the chefs who shared this with us!

This is delicious! Made this without the saffron for my sweetie for Valentine's Day - he loved it and so did I. The chicken braised beautifully! Wonderful meal will definitely make this again!

Great flavor! I did change some things. I used boneless skinless thighs so there wasn't much fat. After reading that the meat got dry I browned the meat and sauteed onion and garlic. While this was working I brought the wine, broth, & saffron to a boil then poured it in the pan. Covered and cooked in 350 oven till chicken was done. At this point my husband ate some and loved it ( Chicken is his least favorite meal). My company was coming the next day so I refrigerated until dinner then finished it. I think that you have to eyeball things because I didn't measure and adjusted accordingly dependindg on how much broth is left after reducing, easy on the cream and lemon. I know I only add a little lemon because my husband doesn't care for that either. My guests all LOVED it, everyone wanted more. I used penne and undercooked it a little then simmered with the chicken & sauce for a few minutes.

Awesome pasta dish. I used regular rigatoni plus large chicken breasts cooked as suggested and shredded the meat. The chicken ended up slightly dry but that probably has more to do with factors on my end. The flavor is delicate but this is a hearty, filling dish. The saffron really came through and the basil at the end was a nice touch, aesthetically and in terms of flavor. Would definitely make again.

I'm in MPLS and a huge BLG fan. This turned out dry and lacking in flavor for me. Good but certainly not a WOW. Bummer.

This is definitely a restaurant recipe. Its good but very time consuming. Its one of those dishes that I enjoyed but given the amount of time required I need great. It's essentially a chicken a pasta dish, reminiscent of a casserole in many ways. The braising of the chicken imparts it with a delicious flavor, but I wonder that a close approximation couldn't be had by just sauteing or even poaching the chicken, which would be a lot faster. So the next time I'm in Minneapolis and at Bar La Grassa, I'll be happy to order the dish and savor it. But I would never make it again. It just isn't worth the extra effort.

This recipe took 2+ hours and, frankly, not worth it for chicken pasta. Flavors are good, not great. Not worth $$ of good saffron, time, etc. If you really want to make, use shortcut of rotisserie chicken and start sauce at onion/garlic saute. It will definitely need the lemon juice as an acid to cut the heaviness of the cream. Also, recipe calls for too much chicken and too much pasta for amount of sauce. Hopefully, you're getting the idea....

Wow. Sure it's a little time consuming, but most of the time is just waiting while things simmer. A little pricey since it has a teaspoon of saffron (most recipes just use a few strands), but well worth it. My husband usually doesn't like saffron heavy dishes, but he raved about this. Heavenly aromas were created by this dish, and my husband said he could smell it from his bus stop a block away. Since my sauce had a lot of fat, I used a gravy separator instead of spooning the fat off. Almost as good the next day. MAKE THIS!!!

Updated - sorry - I meant to say I used boneless skinless chicken thighs not breasts

Man this was good. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and the largest rigatoni I could find. My husband went nuts for it! It was relatively easy. Now I'm just going to have to buy larger quantities of saffron!

I got the special paccheri, the Spanish saffron... Yeah, it was okay but it wasn't my favorite flavor combination. Wished I'd left out the lemon juice, maybe using a handful of arugula instead to cut down on the richness of the sauce.

The official start of autumn has really got me in the mood for comfort foods, and pasta is high up on the list. This recipe appears in a great article in Bon Appétit this month titled The 10 Best New Restaurants in America and comes from Bar La Grassa in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In short, the rigatoni is unbelievable and a must try. It is also very easy to make. I had no idea saffron could be so delicious. What a fresh new take on coq au vin. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/09/24/rigatoni-with-braised-chicken-and-saffron-cream/

I will make it if I can use boneless breasts instead of the dark meat. What do you think?

Made this last night and it was fabulous. Did not have the heavy whipping cream so used a combination of left-over 1/2 & 1/2 and whole milk to make the full cup of dairy needed. To add more creaminess I also added about 1/4C of left-over mascarpone (that cleaned that out of the refrig too). Everyone at the table absolutely enjoyed the dish and my son begged to take the left-overs home.

Great recipe. I would make this again, anytime. I used boneless chicken and it still turned out really rich with solid flavor. There was also barely any fat to spoon off because of this. Delicious!!!!

This really hit the spot on a cool fall evening. I had to use turmeric instead of saffron and regular rigatoni, but it was still awesome. It'll be a once-in-awhile dish due to the cup of cream, but it was definitely a hit. Great weekend dish since it did take about 2 hours.

This is awesome. I had to use regular rigatoni instead of paccheri, but other than that I followed the recipe faithfully, and the results were delicious! Great saffron flavor and color. A very rich and satisfying dish that I will be making regularly.

Excellent! I know, I know----don't review the recipe if you've changed it substantially----BUT, we couldn't justify 1 C of cream! Made recipe exactly as written, but pureed the onion/garlic/stock after chicken was removed, reduced a little, THEN added 1/2 C. cream. This is such a good dish!

This was quie good. I tracked down paccheri at one of those swank boutique grocery stores, and was happy to have found - quite unique. I made this exactly as written and it turned out very well. Plus this is totally a kid-friendly dish.

Can anyone explain why you would introduce the cream and then reduce the entire sauce instead of reducing the stock immeadiately after removing the chicken and THEN add the cream? Falvors were nice but the sauce ended up too thin.

This was the first recipe I wanted to try out of the new issue of Bon Appetit. The list of ingredients really appealed to my taste, and I'm always in search of new pasta recipes. Rather than spooning off the fat from the juices in the skillet, I used my gravy separator, which worked quite well. I was unable to find Paccheri pasta and used Trenne Pasta. This dish is featured on my blog at http://newfinmysoup.blogspot.com/2010 /08/paccheri-pasta-with-braised- chicken-and.html

This is delicious! It looks time consuming but there is a lot of downtime while the chicken cooks, the sauce thinkens etc--it is a fairly hands off dish. Good saffron flavor, not overpowering despite the amount used.

I decided to make this an impromptu Sunday dinner. This sauce holds unbelievable flavor. Having no saffron in sight, we substituted with turmeric. I could have used a better wine wine as well... and the dish still turned out beautifully. Cant wait to make this again, with the all the correct ingredients.
