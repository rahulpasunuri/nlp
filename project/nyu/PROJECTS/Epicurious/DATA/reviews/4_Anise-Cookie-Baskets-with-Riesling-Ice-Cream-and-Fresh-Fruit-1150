This recipe is amazing! I usually leave out the anise (i'm not such a fan, you see), but the orange zest still adds quite a bit of flavour. I also usually fill them with whatever's on hand...whipped cream, custard, ice cream...they always turn out great...rave reviews from dazzled guests by the interesting presentation (home made cookie baskets)...

This is a GREAT summer dessert. I get rave reviews and requests for seconds every time I make it. The flavors blend perfectly for an overall effect you wouldn't expect from the title. I usually don't tell my guests what the dessert is called until they have at least tasted it -- the ingredients don't sound like they go together quite as well as they do. Definitely a keeper!!!

I enjoyed this dessert because it was different and the flavours married beautifully. Unfortunately, some of the people I served it to thought it was a bit too exotic for their tastes. That's okay, that's how the cookie crumbles. Forgive me for my silly unintended pun.
