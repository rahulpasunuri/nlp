Simple and quick. Tastes that way too. Not bad for when one is in a rush.

This was very rich and delicious. I made it for a Thanksgiving potluck, but should have made it the same day to retain the rich creamy consistency. Oh well, lessons learned. It was a nice change from the regular old mac and cheese.

Very easy, tastey and helps to feed those family and friends whom are veggie only eaters.

My cheese sauce broke a little because it was too hot when I added the cheese. Oops! I didn't have any problems with it being runny, however, and the flavor was good. I think I prefer regular macaroni and cheese, though. And I really don't like the bread crumbs on top, but, then, I have a serious problem with bread that's in any way mushy.

This was good not great - comfort food for sure. I take other reviewers advice and halved the bread crumbs. I also added more cheese (you can never have enough!) and more noodles 'cause it seemed a little runny.

I liked the subtle curry flavor in this macaroni and cheese. The breadcrumbs were overwhelming, however. I used only half what was called for, and regretted having used that many.

Great variation on mac and cheese... add more curry it works great! As far as the breadcrumbs, mix with the spices to form a paste, and put on top of the mac and cheese...

for a super-quick meal (good for college students), try adding curry powder to boxed mac n cheese mix. mm mm!!!

I have made this three times. I enjoy this dish minus the bread crumbs. The curry taste is very faint but gives it a different twist. Texas Pete is good on it too if you like the added spice. Macaroni and cheese is a great "comfort food".

Yum, just think "curry" before eating the first forkful. I also saved a bit of time by not trimming the bread before putting it in the food processor. My husband -- a picky eater -- had 3 servings.

Weird taste, possibly because I used extra-old cheddar and it was too strong. There was enough topping to bury the whole dish, you couldn't escape the crumbs. Even my daughter, who lives on macaroni and cheese, would not eat this version. We threw out more than half of the dish.

I wasn't sure what this combination would taste like. We really loved it and I will make it again. I did add a few things, cheese whiz and some worcestershire sauce.

Perhaps it's because I didn't use the sourdough breadcrumbs and because I mistakenly put all the spices in the cheese sauce instead of reserving some for the breadcrumb mixture, but all in all I was a little disappointed by this recipe.

This one turned out a lot better in the end than it seemed it would. When I do it again I will change some things (stir instead of whisk for example) but on the whole the curry gave the old macaroni standby some real zip.
