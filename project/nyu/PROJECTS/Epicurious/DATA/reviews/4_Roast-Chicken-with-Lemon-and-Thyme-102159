The best chicken I have ever made. I put the herbs under the skin as opposed to ontop and I mixed fresh rosemary and thyme. I think my boyfriend now wants to marry me thanks to this recipe:)

This is now my favourite roast chicken recipe! The sauce/gravy is great - don't skip it - and I'm not a gravy person. I made it with all chicken broth because I didn't have any white wine. By chance I had home made broth from a roasted chicken so it was very dark and flavourful. Do tip the chicken forward at the end so that all the juices from inside run into the pan. Lots of lemony-chickeny goodness in there. I poured the juices and broth through a gravy separator to get the fat and burnt lemon zest out of the sauce and I added the oil from the rub, none of the zest or garlic pieces. Worked perfectly. Next time I'll serve this with mashed potatoes to soak up the fabulous sauce. I used dry herbe de provence because the thyme isn't up in the garden yet. Roast chicken and herbe de provence are one of my favourite combinations but I'll try fresh thyme next time. One problem was that the lemon zest bits burned on the chicken and set off the smoke alarm repeatedly. Aargh. My oven runs a little hot so next time I'll try it much lower, maybe 400.

LOVED this recipe! My 3 and 6 year olds also loved it. I cut my chicken into parts first so the cooking time was slightly different but other than that I followed the recipe. Everyone really loved the gravy - make sure you don't skip that part (even though the parts didn't yield much pan juice - mostly just fat).

Rating: 4
super easy and good! added the rosemary and also put under the skin. put rosemary, thyme, lemon and garlic in the bird. Cooked at 475 for 30 minutes (until browned) and then cooked about another hour at 375. bird was def under 7 lbs but there was not an excess of rub. served with mashed potatoes, beets and broccolli.

Rating: 4
Excellent & easy & sooo tasty! My chicken did not take nearly so long to cook (I am not sure of the weight). I like the idea of rosemary with it so I think I'll try an earlier reviewer's idea to add to the rub - I did use a rosemary olive oil though. My chicken did not produce virtually any pan juices (not sure why?) so unfortunately I didn't get to make that part of the recipe... This recipe is a KEEPER.

Rating: 4
Would definitely make this again! It turned out exceptionally succulent and moist. I put some of the thyme/lemon paste under the skin, and threw in some extra thyme springs into the cavity along with the lemon quarters. And it was so easy! Just a few common ingredients and voila - an entree suitable to impress guests.

I made this tonight with a 3 pound bird and just a few adjustments: I used half fresh thyme and half fresh rosemary and loved having the rosemary in the "rub". I made the same amount of rub that the recipe called for and the proportion to the bird was great. I also added 2 sprigs of thyme and 1 of rosemary to the inside of the bird before tying the legs. I roasted the chicken for the 20 minutes at 450 and then 50 minutes at 375 and it was very juicy and delicious. I would certainly make this again - it was easy! We loved it with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.

Rating: 4
Super juicy and yummy. I used garlic, lemon juice and herbs de provence and rubbed under the skin. My chicken was about 5 1/2 lbs and I baked for 20 min at 450° then about 60 min at the lower temp. I didn't have a thermometer so I had to guess and it was perfectly cooked.

Great recipe!!!! No parts of the chicken left!! Just want to add that I had to turn the oven up to 325 after the 180 suggested temp. My roast took a total of about 2 hours. It was tender!!

Rating: 4
Excellent. 450 degrees convection for 30 min, then 375 for about an hour for 4 lb chicken. Like others, hard to find a 7 lb chicken.... Sauce was fantastic. I made it with brown rice to which I added sauteed mixed fresh mushrooms and poured a little of the sauce on that too. Used cornstarch instead of flour for sauce. I pushed some of the thyme (I used about 2 tsp dried) mixture under the skin of the breast and legs. This was the best roast chicken I have ever made and I've made hundreds.

Rating: 4
This was fabulous! Made it with the following additions: quartered an onion and stuffed half the onion in the cavity of the chicken with the lemon, spread the other 2 quarters of onion about in the roasting pan. Also added a couple of whole cloves of garlic, and tufts of thyme into the cavity. Basted once during the final 30 min. The juice from this chicken was sublime and made terrific gravy! The onions partially carmelized in the pan juices, and my boyfriend ate them with his rice and greens. My 3 1/4 lb chicken took 15 min at 450 and 45 min at 375. Perfect!! What a simple and delicious meal!

Rating: 4
I followed this exactly as the recipe said except I used a smaller chicken (~3 lbs so cooked about 15 minutes less.) Every 15 mins or so, I scooped up some of the juice and dribbled it along the top. I was surprised at how juicy and delicious this recipe turned out. The gravy is also a keeper--a must have if you make the chicken. My only complaint is that my oven was a complete mess (sides, top, bottom). Need a better pan and/or foil on the bottom.

I followed the recipe precisely. The initial cooking for 20 minutes at 450F scorched the lemon zest, thyme, and garlic, and the bitterness stayed with the dish.

Having tried dozens of roasted chicken recipes, I find they either pass or fail based on flavor and moisture. This one gets a passing grade. Flavor was tasty - I substituted rosemary for the thyme b/c that's what I had. The moistness was acceptable. I always roast a chicken breast side down for the first 20 minutes - a moisture enhancing trick I learned years ago from "Cook's Best Recipes." Did the same for this recipe. It worked well. Yummy.

Excellent and very easy to prepare. Tender, juicy, and full of flavor. Gravy also turned out nicely though I would skip adding the additional broth next time. I took the pan out of the oven a couple times and spooned the juices over the chicken to ensure it stayed moist.

This came out fantastically. I baked the chicken in a pan with loads of potatoes, onions and carrots. After the 20 minutes at 450, I baked it at 350 for an hour and 20 min (instead of 375). Took it out for about 30 minutes, then put it back in at 200 for about 15 minutes. It couldn't have been juicier and more perfect.

This recipe turned out perfectly - the chicken was juicy, the gravy was easy and my guests enjoyed it. I, however, thought that the seasoning was a bit overwhelming as written in the recipe. As my husband really enjoyed it and has requested this again sometime, I'll probably make it again but with the idea of less is more in mind.

This recipe was so easy and so delicious. I went ahead and basted the chicken with a little extra white wine.

This recipe is fantastic. In lieu of a whole chicken, I use breasts with skin and bones. Quarter the lemons and cut each quarter in half again. I put one or two lemon wedges under the chicken, bone down, herb rub the top and bake until juices run clear. Everything else is the same ~ I have made this for a dinner party of 12, each guest indicated white or dark meat - if they chose dark, I used thighs. Never fails to impress!

Rating: 4
Simple, economical, tasty. Takes five minutes to prep, and I can get a run in and laundry done while waiting for the chicken to cook. I roast it breast side-down and it always turns out juicy, even if I leave the chicken in for longer to make sure it's up to temp.

The best roast chicken ever; been making this exact recipe for years. Follow the recipe exactly and make the gravy...it's the whole point of the recipe! Chop some extra herbs and make roasted potatoes for a perfect side dish.

Yum yum yum yum yum. I found a 5.5 lb bird (organic, free range). I had to leave it in for about 1 hour 25 minutes at 375, but it was worth the extra 10 mins. Rave reviews from our 13 and 15 year old girls who have suffered through many of my undercooked roast chicken attempts. Don't skip the pan sauce - it's delicious! I served with a green salad and crusty Italian bread. Simple but special Friday night meal.

Rating: 2
what am i missing here? so many stellar reviews, but i found this bird to be just OK--there was definitely a richness or complexity of flavor lacking. i followed the recipe, with the following adjustments: 4.5-lb organic bird (where do you find a 7-lb bird?!); put most of thyme/garlic stuff under skin instead of on top; put a few springs of thyme in cavity; put bird on bed of thin slices of 1/2 lemon and one large shallot; after 20 mins put in some cut-up yukon golds, carrots, and parsnips; took out after 1 hr 20 minutes total (a little overdone, though temp was still a hint under 180). my oven was having temp issues, but i don't think that was the problem. the gravy was the best part, but a bit too lemony/bitter; probably would leave out the extra 1/2 lemon i put in the roasting pan. i think chopping the garlic may have limited its effect, so next time i'd grind it into a paste to evenly distribute the flavor. but really, i don't think i'll make this one again--not when there exists the "Roast Chicken with Spicy Herbed Olivada" recipe, which is out of this world!!!

Boring and bland. And has no one noticed that the recipe tells you to reserve a tablespoon of the garlic/thyme mixture and then never tells you what to do with it? It also lists 1 cup of canned chicken broth in the ingredients and never tells you what to do with it. There are many far better ways to do a roast chicken.

Rating: 4
My family loved this recipe. For the first time ever I made a recipe from Epicurious with little changes. Having said that, I couldn't find a 7 lb. chicken, so used a much smaller one. I added some apple into the bird like one reviewer recommended. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone loved it! Oh, but it made my house smell greasy. Do chickens usually do that? Is it the high heat? Lots of smoke in that first few minutes at the high temperature.

Just made, delish. My grocery store did not have thyme so I bought fresh Marjoram and it was delicious that way. I tried one recipe that just said poke holes in the lemon in the bird and it definitely is better cutting it up. Also, the lemon zest adds a lot to the skin. Oh and I did make extra rub and I also put it under the skin.

I absolutely love this recipe and not only do I prepare this with a roasting chicken but I've also used it with Cornish Hens and I also use this for my Thanksgiving Turkey as well. In addition to using a lemon in the cavity I also dice Granny Smith Apples and place them in the cavity (especially in a turkey). The meat comes out so juicy (moist would be an understatement). This has become my staple recipe for all big occasions (its easy, tasty, and makes everyone else think I've slaved away)!!!!

This is a wonderful and super-easy recipe! I used two smaller (about 4.5 lb) free-range chickens (1.5 x the recipe ingredients) and just watched the thermometer to make sure they came out when the thigh meat was 180. They were perfectly cooked. For the first 10 minutes I put them upside-down on the rack to brown the underside a little and to help keep the breast meat moist. Which it was! I also strained the gravy (also wonderful) before serving as we found the pieces of thyme made for a bit of an unappealing texture. I will definitely make this chicken again and again.

I generally always do roasting chickens in an oven bag, but my shelves were bare of bags. So after a search for a new recipe, I found this one and I will probably never search again for a roast chicken recipe. The skin was so crisp and the meat was so tender and juicy. It helped to have fresh thyme growing in the backyard herb pot. My husband said this chicken was "the best".

I've made this at least 5 times and it's always a winner at our house. Use an organic, free-range chicken for best flavor, loosen skin and stuff excess trimmed fat underneath so the chicken bastes itself. Served with carrots (they taste great with sauce) and a Cote du Rhone. Great midweek dinner.

I don't usually toss around 4 fork ratings. Disclaimer: this is still just a chicken, but it is now the #1 chicken recipe for my family. Nothing particularly remarkable about a roast chicken, in general, but this is the cream of the crop as far as they go, so it gets 4 forks. Moist, flavorful. We quartered red potatoes to add when the temp. is reduced and used a native WA State chardonnay in the sauce. Wonderful roast chicken recipe. So easy. You must try it!

First time ever roasting a whole chicken, and couldn't have been simpler or tastier. The only mistake I made was burning some onions that I had thrown in at the last minute, setting off the fire alarm. I did keep careful watch on it when it was in the oven though, as my oven runs hot and I did not want to overcook it. Take it out RIGHT as it hits 180.

Fantastic. I mixed the garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, lemon zest and herbes de provence. Coated the chicken in the mix, removed the backbone so the chicken would lay flat in the roasting pain and placed the chicken over sliced lemons and roasted in the oven. I also sprinkled just a little bit of sugar on the skin to help with browning. Yummy.

Rating: 2
What I do is put thyme garlic, oil and lemon peel into a blender w/ some salt and pepper and a little lemon juice, then I get all the seasoning under the skin, either by sldiding it under the skin on the breasts or making a few holes with the knife and working it into the other parts. Yum.

This was DEE-licious. And easy. I had to used dried thyme (2Tbsp) and it was still good. I thinned my gravy with some whole milk - mmm. Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes also from this site (easy to roast garlic while chicken is already in). Everyone raved. This will become a staple around my house.

Rating: 3
Very good. I followed the advice of some and also added rosemary. I wouldn't recommend this and will not add it next time. The rosemary was not a good team player and overpowers the subtle lemon-thyme flavors. I also made a olive oil,garlic,thyme,lemon paste and placed it under the skin. I might try the paste on the out side next time since the chopped garlic bits tend to char.

Wonderful results! The gravy is worth making. To the novice cook - it may seem a little complicated, but just follow the recipe step by step, and voila! I also slipped some of the seasoning and lemon slices under the skin. And I roasted the chicken breast side down for the first part of the cooking, and turned it over when it was time to lower the oven temp. That way, the bottom got a little more cooked, and the breast meat didn't dry out.

I also added some quarterd potatoes, baby carrots and quartered onions about 1 hour before it was done but otherwise made it as is. No basting, no peeking. It was great!!

Added carrot chunks, quartered Vidalia onions,and quartered par-boiled Yukon Golds for last hour of cooking. Held chicken and vegetables in warm oven while making the sauce.

The best roast chicken I've ever had. As a general rule I cook my chicken for 10-15 minutes at 425F then turn the oven down to 350F and cook for 20 minutes/pound plus an extra 20 minutes. Works every time (for conventional ovens). We also made twice the butter mixture and put half under the breast skin. For extra crispy and tasty skin, baste every 20-30 minutes. We also tossed some parboiled baby potatoes and raw carrot chunks into the pan about 40-minutes before the chicken was done. Yum!

Leftovers? What leftovers? I made a 7 lb roaster for a family of five, and there was barely anything left! Simple and delicious, although it did take more time than indicated (cook a 7 lb bird in 1 hr 35 min??) -- very moist and flavorful. I added rosemary and sage to the rub, and doubled the lemon. Also put herbs in the cavity w/ the lemons. Fresh herbs a MUST! Served with roasted winter vegetables and couscous -- 3 kids ages 6-13 gobbled it up!

Delicious. I followed the recipe pretty closely except I used unsalted butter instead of the oil - I find it makes the skin crispier. Also, I basted the chickens (yes, I doubled the recipe - leftovers are the best part) every 15 minutes along with some cut up and peeled russet potatoes which I threw in the bottom of the roasting pan (chicken were on the V-rack). I did not make the gravy as my family was clamoring for food - next time, though. This is a keeper.

Excellent recipe. I brined the chicken for a few hours before cooking. I also put the remaining lemon (quartered), blanched garlic cloves and some sprigs of thyme in the cavity. It turned out juicy and really delicious. It also filled the house with the most wonderful aroma.

This is a great recipe for chicken that I will use again and again...my family loved it. I did make the sauce which didn't turn out so well but I think I probably did something wrong. I plan on making the chicken without the sauce.

Terrific recipe. I make this dish regularly now. Great for leftovers. I don't bother with the gravy, mostly because it's too much of a pain, but also because I just don't see it as essential. I am glad I purchased a meat thermometer prior to making this chicken, since I'm no good at telling when it's done, and since it seems my oven may be cooler than it indicates. It can take a while to cook completely, but one can take care of other business while the bird is in the oven.

First I must say that I have never mastered roast chicken until now. I did as one reviewer suggested and rubbed the garlic-thyme mixture under the skin as well as on top. It smelled divine while baking, and it was moist and tasted fabulous. I made the gravy as well, which was thick and very rich tasting. I would definitely make this again.

WOW! This is EXCELLENT roast chicken. Truly the best roast chicken I have EVER had. I used a 4.5 lb. chicken and used the same amount of ingred. I also added a whole package of fresh rosemary which I put inside the chicken. I put half of the rub under the skin and the other half on the outside. Be sure to salt and pepper the chicken very well. It turned out great! It is very moist and incredibly flavorful. I didn't make the sauce like some other reviewers and I truly don't think it needs anything else. My guest was very impressed. It is also great cold the next day. MAKE THIS ONE!

Excellent. I used a 3.5-lb. chicken with the same amount of ingredients, and wished I had even made more of the "crust" because it's scrumtious. I was too tired by the time I made this to continue on with the sauce, but we didn't miss it at all. Since, as I said, I was tired, I never had any of this chicken while it was hot (I fell asleep on the couch while it was roasting), but my husband helped himself to some and pronounced it delicious. In the days since, I've made magnificent sandwiches from it (adding just a bit of mayo and lettuce) on halved baguettes. I wish there were more of the delicious crust to sprinkle on the sandwich, but you still get the unique flavor loud and clear. These sandwiches taste great to the last bite, never fading in taste as you eat. "If anything, they increase in flavor," my husband says.

Yum! If you like rotisserie chicken, you'll love this dish. I followed the last reviewer's suggestion and bagged the sauce. I agree -- such flavorful chicken doesn't need any accountrements! For those who are a little confused by the way this recipe is written (especially with regards to the lemon component!) -- all you do is combine the thyme, lemon zest, garlic and oil and rub that onto the bird. Then take the lemon which you just zested, cut it into quarters and stick the 4 quarters inside the bird. This is a great recipe -- quick preparation and awesome results!

I have made this chicken many times and it is always delicious. I love the sauce but my husbanc is a purist and doesn't put anything on such a delicious moist chicken, so this time I didn't bother to make it. I must admit that for the first time I realized how flavorful the cnicken was on its own without the sauce. The choppint of ingredients is time consuming, but well worth the effort.

I added a bit of sage to the rub and I substituted corn starch for the flour. I made it for Easter Sunday dinner and all my guests raved about it. I'd make it again in a second

I've made this many times. I rub the garlic/thyme oil under the breast skin for more flavor. It is so moist and fragrant. As for the cook from Cherry Hill...I know this had to be a prank review. I mean, really, seafood sausage substitute??!!

Great recipe! I left out the lemon wedge; prepared the chicken the night before; and was ready to cook it right away. My family really like this.

This recipe is wonderful! Both times I have made this dish, I marinated the chicken in the lemon and herbs a day in advance. This increased the flavor and decreased the prep time on the day I served it. Also be sure and truss the chicken, this will help keep the breasts nice and moist.

:-) Absolutely yummy. I also added some sage in the chicken cavity which turned out good too. I didn't add wine for the gravy since I don't drink, but it came perfect anyway. Definitely a favorite.

This made a good roast chicken. I used dried thyme (3/4tsp) since I didnt' have any fresh. House smelled great and the chicken was moist.

I followed the recipe precisely, except for one minor but crucial change: I place most of the lemon mixture UNDER the skin after loosening it, then rubbed the remainder of the oil on top of the skin, and seasoned with s/p. Fantastic taste! Served it with roasted root vegetables and it got raves, including several "best chicken I ever tasted" comments.

I gotta agree with the cook from Canton. What is up with people who make dramatic changes to a recipe and then complain that it didn't turn out? I understand improvising on a recipe, but seafood sausage?? Is that a joke? I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. :)

Excellent. I will definately make this again. I was not able to find a 7 pound chicken, I made two 3.5 pound chickens and it was perfect. I reheated the leftover chicken two days later and it was just as good, maybe even better, than the first serving. Will definately serve this at my next dinner party!

All I can say is WOW. Succulent, flavorful and easy to make. Highly recommend for GRAVY lovers. That's the "icing on the cake" for this recipe. I followed it to the "T" and it was perfect.

I made this with a smaller chicken--4 to 5 lbs., but left everything else the same and it was perfect for two. I also added some rosemary, making the whole house smell great while this was cooking!!

I haven't actually tried making this yet, but just wanted to put in my two cents re: the cook from Cherry Hill. Uh, when did frozen SEAFOOD sausage become an appropriate substitute for chicken!?! And nowhere in the recipe did I read the word "microwave". Following directions and ending up with a bad dish is one thing, but don't blame the recipe for your own lack of skill and common sense. Take my advice, before you try -- and rate -- another Epicurious recipe, get yourself some cooking/reading lessons!

This is a wonderful recipe. I didn't find it confusing at all like some others mentioned,but then if I don't like a particular ingredient or method-I improvise-isn't that what cooking is all about? (although I wouldn't recommend what "Cherry Hill" did). I use lemon-thyme from my garden-delicious!

Instead of using this recipe, proceed directly to "Roast Chicken with Herb Butter, Onions and Garlic" on this site. I don't know why I tried this recipe after such incredibly good chicken with the other. This recipe is fine, but pedestrian.

This is a great, simple and tasty recipe but I would not recommend substituting frozen seafood sausage or the microwave technique like "Cherry Hill, NJ"(moron!). Don't be afraid to blend in some other herbs like dry basil, oregano and/or tarragon.

It's actually a 3.25. Chicken was great, but I did add extra lemon. Further, I used the flour to make a roux to begin the gravy.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to make this recipe. Admitedly my chicken was not completely thawed out when I put it in the oven, so unfortunately it was about 95% done when I took it out - which was yucky. The thyme was too overpowering, and I have another recipe for a lemon roasted chicken with rosemary that I, and family, like better.

This recipe was a disaster. I substituted frozen seafood sausage for the chicken and tried to microwave it instead of roasting it. But it exploded all over the place with all of that hot wine! I cleaned it up the best I could but my apartment still has the most awful burning fish smell. This is a terrible, awful, horrific recipe.

Everyone I served this to loved this dish. I would definitely make it again. I put a few drops of lemon extract into the lemon-thyme oil mixture to help the lemon zest along.

Might use another lemon; I do agree that this recipe is confusing in the way it's written. It's anyone's guess where that lemon peel is being used... I suppose in the garlic/thyme oil?

Didn't care for this chicken at all, neither did my husband or children. I expected the chicken to have more of a lemon taste. Would probably add more lemon to the sauce next time.

What a wonderful recipe! We made this for a small dinner party and it was a huge hit--very moist and so tender it was falling off the bone. We did 2 chickens at once (both smaller than 7 lbs., probably more like 4 lbs.) and doubled the amount of all the ingredients. Rather than the standard roasting rack, we placed them on a bed of quartered onions, leeks and lemons; fresh thyme and rosemary sprigs; and white wine. I think this gave the chickens an extra flavor boost. Roasted Yukon Gold potatoes and asparagus were perfect complements.

This was very good. Not a "wow, that's incredible" dish, but good, flavorful moist chicken. But didn't anyone else find the recipe very poorly written? And how many cups of broth/sauce are there suppose to be? The recipe has a few typos...

After reading all the great reviews, I knew I HAD to try the recipe. I turned out great! The aroma alone made me certain this would be one impressive dish. (an easy way to remove the thyme leaves is to hold the top of the stalk and just strip the leaves off backwards down the stalk.) I will definitely make this again.

Simple and delicious. I used a smaller 4 lb. fryer, and it was very easy to do, although tedious to take all the leaves off the fresh thyme to make 3 tbsns. I made my own pan gravy instead of the recipe's, very delicious with the lemon and thyme flavoring. I agree the lemon in the cavity keeps the chicken breast moist and delicious, came out picture perfect, although I cooked mine longer than the recipe indicated, but I always do that. Will make again, whole family loved it with rice, gravy, green beans and cranberry sauce!

Delicious! I don't know where people are finding 7lb roasters, but I used a 4+ roaster and it turned out great. I made this dish for guests and it was easy - short prep and long cooking meant I had time to pull the rest of the meal together while this was in the oven.

I have made this three times for dinner guests and it is a hit every time. The last two times I used a cooking bag and cut slits in them so the chicken will brown, and it came out very tender and juicy. Butterball roast chickens are great for this recipe.

This recipe was well received by my family plus super easy. I substituted marsala in place of the white wine and it added that extra flavor boost to the sauce.
