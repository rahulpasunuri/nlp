My three-star review is based on following other reviewers' advice to flip the water/broth amounts (I used 4 cups broth, 1 3/4 water). I also used thighs instead of breasts and added elbow macaroni, though I don't think those changes were as important as the broth-water ratio. I didn't make any other tweaks, and I ended up with a really tasty soup, which was particularly impressive given how quick it is to make.

Made this last night. I ended up making a few changes. Added fire roasted tomatoes to it, and I wasn't sure if it would be hearty enough to serve as dinner, so I also added some orzo to it. It came out so good, everyone had 2 or more servings, including the pickiest eater of all, my father-in-law. :) It's def going on regular rotation.

This was a great little soup to make, very easy and adaptable. I used 5 cups of chicken broth and a 14.5 oz can of diced tomato instead of water. I also added potato and more of the veggies called for. I poached the chicken in the broth/tomato with dried garlic and rosemary. Also, I added fresh grated parmesan and served with toasted challah.

This is my "go to" recipe for a flavorful chicken soup base. I add more carrots & celery and rice or pasta. I also sometimes add a can of diced tomatoes and chicken broth versus water.

Using this as a base, I add one can diced tomoatoes, a couple of potatoes cubed and one can rinsed and drained canellini beans. I use all chicken broth (no water) - I also add fresh thyme. I have added the chicken breast to the soup raw if I want to save on dishes. I make a big pot of soup and we have it for dinner twice. Delicious.

This was ok. I used 3 cups water and 1 3/4 c. broth. I added 1/4 tsp. dried thyme. My veggies and chicken took longer to cook than stated in the recipe. I might play around with this to come up with a recipe that only uses one pot.

We were snowed-in in Atlanta and I only had certain items on hand, so made various additions based on prior comments and necessity, and it turned out great. I used all broth, no water. Had no cheese rind so I used 3 oz. of sharp white cheddar, which dissolved in the hot broth. Added 2 bay leaves, as others suggested. Didnt have any fresh celery, so I added 1/4 cup of dried soup greens. Browned the chicken breasts in garlic powder and butter before poaching them. Used more carrots than called for, but disguised them by pureeing the soup (minus bay leaves) with a stick blender once the veggies were tender. Once past the puree point I added 28 oz. diced tomatoes, 6 oz. tomato paste, 2 lbs. frozen peas and ¾ c. chardonnay. The result was super  a hearty, flavorful, healthy, low calorie soup with the shredded chicken and a nice crunch from the peas.

I used all the tips: Browned the Chicken, reversed water to broth ratio & added cheese rind, bay leaf, noodles, cup of white wine, tomato paste, S&P. It came out great; both, my wife, down w/ a cold, & I really liked it. I scored a couple of points w/ her.

This is a great basic recipe that I will use over and over again. It was fairly easy to prepare - although to saute the onions and garlic while the chicken was poaching was not a good idea. I took my eyes off of it for a couple of seconds and the onions almost burned. Saute while shredding the chicken. The chicken also needed more time to poach than indicated. I read about some people thinking it was too bland, but I happened to have some College Inn chicken broth that was made with white wine and added herbs. I think everyone should find that broth because this soup was NOT bland. Try it. If you don't like it, you can adjust it to your taste.

This recipe was good, and basic. Like others have said-- Chicken soup, is chicken soup.. I don't believe any of the varieties I have had, have been taste sensations. One important key to enhancing this recipe is to switch the amounts of water vs. broth. 4 c. of broth and 1 3/4 c of water. I added other veggies- parsnips, and wide egg noodles towards the end. Don't be afraid to add salt and pepper! I also added 2 bay leaves during simmering. I would make this again.

This soup was absolutely perfect. It was simple but very flavorful. First time making chicken soup, and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. Perfect for an easy dinner.

Toss in a cubed potato, about half a can of tomato paste or a can of chopped tomatoes, a cup of red wine and a bay leaf or two. That will definitely give the soup more flavor. Serve with some al dente Ditalini noodles and you've got an excellent, hearty soup that cures what ails you.

Thank you for all the suggestions on tweeking this. It was good, but it didn't have great chicken flavor. Next time I will make my broth from scratch using a whole chicken and see if that punches it up. Cheese rind was a great suggestion as well as increasing veggies.

Rating: 2
I'm somewhat surprised at 3 1/2 forks for this. I used a lot of the recommendations other cooks shared and I was disappointed in the blandness of the broth. Used cheese rind, extra veggies, more broth to water, thigh added etc. Just didn't live up to other epicurious 3 1/2 fork recipes. I always appreciate other cooks suggestions. Thank you, so many of then are so spot on.

i love this soup. i make it probably 6 times a year, often enough to freeze some. it's not the world's most interesting soup, but it's good in an i-have-no-reservations-about-enjoying-bowls-and-bowls sort of way. very clean tasting. i always dip baguette into it, and put tons of fresh grated parmesan on top. i think i pretty much always put in more vegetables than they say, and adjust the s&p. i give this 4 forks because it's just a very good, no-disguises, honest feeling soup.

Perfect soup if you are in a hurry. I used 4 stalks of selery and 8 small/medium carrots. Also added some green beens. I fried lightly 5 breasts of chicken with garlic powder in butter to get them golden brown on the surface before simmering. I also used wide egg noodles but the soup was nice w/o them. Light flavor is very nice.

Please don't use water at all for this recipe. I used about half water half broth and it was SUPER bland. I didn't have any boullion on hand so instead added a packet from Ramen noodles (Spicy Chicken). It at least gave it some taste. Also added corn and egg noodles, oregano & garlic salt to pep it up.

This is a really good basic recipe. Didn't have celery or parsley, so I used parsnips and dill instead, added some barley. Will make again.

Reverse the water to broth amounts. put parmesan rind and bay leaf into broth with chicken. add dried thyme. green beans are good, too!

You have to make the changes that a lot of the reviewers did. I did this and it was 3 stars after. It's worth it, because homemade chicken is so much better. Chcnages: Reverse the water to broth amounts. put parmesan rind and bay leaf into broth with chicken. add dried thyme. green beans are good, too!

excellent soup but you may have to add some boulion cubes to bump up the chicken flavor, also add some fresh dill makes the soup even better

Very 'basic' tasting but then I guess it is meant to so don't take that as a criticism. Nice no frills soup. When I reheated the left overs I put in some sweetcorn and rice noodles which filled it out a bit more.

This turned out great--perfect with a loaf of crusty bread. I made it with 3 cups water and 2 cups broth. Also added savories (onion, turnip, carrot, herbs) into broth while simmering. Then scooped those out and went on with recipe---added lots of flavor. I also used suggestions about adding celery salt, and using a thigh in the broth (but I only put white meat in the soup at the end) and replacing some carrots with parsnips. I have added this recipe to my "make again" recipe book and will be using it again, especially over Thanksgiving when the house will be full of people looking for lunch.

This doesn't have enough "stuff" to justify 4 C. H20. I used all chicken broth and Foster Farms Chicken Tenders cut in 1/2" pieces. At the end I added a handfull of egg noodles. I had and forgot the parmesan rind which I have used in the past with good results. Next time I'll add a handful of green beans. Try it, you'll like it. It's a keeper for me.

Quick, simple, and most importantly, delicious. While it may not stand up to a soup made with homemade chicken stock, or an entire chicken, this recipe creates a light and enjoyable dinner. We added a cup of brown rice with the poaching liquid, which was a welcome addition, but the soup didn't need it, and the rice soaked up a lot of liquid, so I would recommend using half or three quarters of a cup if you decide to use rice.

I used only chicken broth and added a few whole peppercorns and 3 bayleaves to the poaching liquid. Also substituted 2 parsnips for 2 of the carrots and added fresh dill with the parsley.

I took the advise of the cook from Houston and added several rinds of parmiggiano reggiano and it did add an excellent flavor. I love that cheese anyway. I also used the chicken thighs which I prefer anyway. I added red bell pepper at the end egg noodles, at my husband's request and found it very satisfying.

Rating: 0
the person who added her suggestions re: rind is giving great advice. I think I found that tid bit in COOKS ILLUSTRATED and it has changed my soups from good to fabulous. Besides, I was throwing out all those rinds for years (my Italian husband uses a LOT of hard cheese)dc

Rating: 3
I put in 3 cups broth and 2 and 3/4 cups water instead. I also added 1/2 a tbsp. of hot pepper flakes and some spinach and herb spice, and I added 2 extra cloves of garlic. I think without doing these things the recipe would have been kind of bland, but this made it very hearty and added a little kick to it.

I love making soup...I haven't tried this recipe in particular, but I throw out a couple of suggestions to you who are going to try it. First, thighs make a tremendous difference in the flavor of the broth, even if you discard them and defat the soup. I know people aren't fans of them because they are dark meat, etc, but they really add a flavor that you can't get with just breasts. Second, I have recently discovered the beauty of a rind of parmiggiano reggiano in soup. Add a rind or two, which you can find at any grocer that sells fresh parmiggiano, and you will have the tastiest soup base in the universe! It's amazing how much dimension and excitement a couple of rinds can yield. I am not knocking this recipe-- it's a great basic recipe-- I just wanted to give you some easy additions that can make big changes.

Yummy, with a few changes-- added some zucchini and pototoes, left out the celery, and added a handful of egg noodles at the end, as suggested by another cook. Also threw in some chopped chives and thyme from the herb garden. Nothing earth-shattering about this recipe, but it's a nice, satisfying comfort food.

To the Warwick, NY cook... nicely done:) Much agreed on every aspect of your entry! Curious though, if she wasn't looking for the recipe herself, how did she in fact come across it to criticize its readers so? Enjoy my fellow stupid cooks!

A very quick, yet suprisingly flavourful chicken soup. Good for a cold night when you want something warm and tasty, but can't spend all day making soup. A handful of egg noodles tossed into the soup during the last 10 minutes or so of cooking wouldn't go amiss either.

My husband and young children enjoyed it. I added the red pepper and thyme as suggested. I poached the chicken in water only and used canned chicken broth for the final product instead of using the leftover poaching liquid. I also added cooked fusilli noodles at the end for a more filling soup.

It was delicious. Instead of using canned chicken broth, I used a container of home made chicken broth that I keep in the freezer. It was fast and tasted like it cooked all day.

This soup is enhanced by adding one parsnip(halved) with the simmering broth. In addition add one tablespoon of grated romano with the parsley. Remove the parsnip before serving.

I added the orzo pasta as suggested by another reviewer, and also substituted watercress for parsly. It was on the bland side of delicious, so the next time I make it I will try 3 instead of 4 cups of water, and add a dash or two of thyme for more flavor. It went very well with baguette bread, for dipping.

This soup received rave reviews from my usually picky family. We added a little bit of separately cooked orzo pasta before serving to add a little body.
