Big hit appetizer with the college kids home for the holidays. I used sweetened count, which was good. I had large shrimp and the better could have covered 20 shrimp. Fried in batches of 5. I paired with pineapple-apricot salsa of August 2000. This was too much salsa, but otherwise worked well. I cut back purple onion as half cup looked overpowering. I also used canned crushed pineapple (shame on me). It was good but could have simplified further with simple chili sauce-cilantro-lime sauce to same effect. Thinking summer on a grey New England evening, with some good autumn beer.

Delicious richness from the coconut balanced by the tanginess of the lime rind. By not using a thick batter, it remains light and crispy without being greasy.

This recipe was very good. I had no trouble finding unsweetened coconut in the grocery store, it was in the produce section at our Shop Rite. I used my deep fryer to make it and I used chipolte panko bread crumbs from Stew Leonard's. Glad I did because I thought it could use a little heat, but it wasn't enough. Next time I will add a bit of ground chipolte or other hot pepper to spice it up a bit.

Delicious! I added a rounded tsp curry powder to crumbs. Served with Thai chili sauce

I love coconut shrimp, but don't love deep-fried foods! This was easy and REALLY delicious. I used a convection oven and they were delightfully crispy on the outside without all the grease. I've made them with the sauce several times for parties and everyone loves them!

I haven't tried this recipe but with a different Coconut Shrimp I used this dipping sauce. It sounds odd but is great & simple. Mix equal parts of good apricot preserves & houseradish.

coconut milk thickens quite well without cornstarch! I would think some peanut butter and soy to the coconut milk would be yummy

Very good and easy. I use only fresh shrimp. The quality of the shrimp makes a big difference. Make a coconut sauce using one can coconut milk, 1/2 T sugar + or - to taste, one level T cornstarch and salt to taste. Simmer until thickened.

I was disappointed in this recipe. The shrimp had no flavor. I had to add honey to get anything even remotely good. Bummer.

Made this dish last night and it was a huge hit with our guests. Served it with three different dipping sauces - Sweet Chilli and Lime, Sweet Chilli and Sour Cream and Marmalade, Horseradish and Dijon.

This was so much easier than all the recipes here that call for making complex batters prior to dipping the shrimp in coconut. In addition, it was DELICIOUS! My 3 and 6 year olds gobbled them up just as fast as we did. Perfect, easy, we'll be making this again and again.
