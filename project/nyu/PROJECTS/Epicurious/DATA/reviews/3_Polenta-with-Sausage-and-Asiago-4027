I used cornmeal since this is what the ingredients list called for. The consistency was awful, very runny. I will make it again with polenta and hope for a better results...

I've been making this for years and my husband (who grew up on polenta courtesy of his Italian grandmother) loves it - I just went on line to check if any other reviewers had found it advisable to increase the amount of cheese and was dismayed at the negative comments and variations suggested. The recipe is great if followed exactly as written (although I do like to increase the asiago on top) and there is nothing difficult or hard to find about polenta: it is simply cornmeal and water. I can't figure out why one reviewer couldn't get it thickened; mine is always quite thick in less time than the recipe indicates. By the way, the recipe can be halved if there are fewer than 8 people.

For the more acquired taste, polenta and asiago cheese compliment each other woderfully...And let me tell you, cornmeal won't cut it! Anyway, it was yum yum...

I looked for a recipe with these ingredients (Asiago cheese and dry sausage) and was surprised to see so many other items. Why use a recipe for polenta to use so much. I made the polenta first. It is very easy to make. I added the dry sausge with pepper, Then I sauteed local sausage adding sweet onions. Allowing the polenta to cool to thickness, without becoming becoming cold, I served the polenta in a shallow bowl, added the sausages and onions on top and had RAVES, Even my husband enjoyed this version of the recipe.

We live in a small town with limited access to "fancy" big city ingredients so I adapted as necessary. Oscar Meyer provided the meat and no knew where to find "polenta" ...there is no such thing as "polenta" in our county. So I used buns, regular hot dog buns. Slapped on a bit of French's (adds a European flair) mustard and it is so popular its become a regional classic. And kids go crazy for this recipe!

I didn't like the asiago cheese at all, so I used velveeta instead. Turned out much better. Also thought it was a terrible waste to use good corn meal for polenta so I made corn bread instead. Where do they come up with these recipes?

I used a box (one pound) of polenta which may have been too much for the other ingredients. The flavors of the meats did not come through. The polenta mix called for 8 cups of water for one pound of dry polenta so I think the recipe amount must be about right. When I make it the next time I will use more meat in proportion to the polenta.

I prepared this recipe for an "International Potluck" at work and received endless praises. The flavor of the Asiago cheese was delicious. I would definitely make this recipe again. I used prepared polenta instead of making it from scratch, but i don't think it hurt the recipe at all.

I cooked the cornmeal with the 7 (!) cups of water for almost 45 minutes, but could not get it to come together as suggested in the recipe; could this be a typo? (7 cups seems excessive to me...) In any event, the flavors of the finished dish were outstanding, but the consistency was, as you may guess, closer to a liquid than polenta should ever be.
