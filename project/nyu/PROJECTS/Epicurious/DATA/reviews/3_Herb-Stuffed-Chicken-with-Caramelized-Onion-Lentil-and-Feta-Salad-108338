THe flavors are very delicate and light. We enjoyed it. It is a lot of work, but I would make it again.

This really wasn't good. Not much flavor and not worth making again.

It was ok. Neither good nor bad.

I have prepared this recipe twice, and cannot give it enough gold stars. A tip..if you can't find arrowroot, use cornstarch. The second time I made it, I used only 1/4 cup of lentils and added them to the puree, instead of tossing them into the lettuce. It was equally as good, if not better. I also added Kalamatas and used other lettuces since I couldn.t find Bibb. Fantastic!

I thought upon reading reviews this would be worth the effort -- how very disappointing. The lentil mixture was nice but the sauce & the chicken were just blah. I won't waste the time again.

This was such a fresh, healthy weeknight dinner. My husband came home from work and said, "uggg, lentils--I hate lentils." Then he proceeded to eat the entire meal and loved it! Said, "this is a keeper!" My kids loved it, too.

Gourmet dinning at home, the use of lentils very healthy.
