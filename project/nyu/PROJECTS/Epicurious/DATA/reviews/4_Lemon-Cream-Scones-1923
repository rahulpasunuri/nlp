I 've reviewed these before but i must update. I have used dried cranberries and blueberries as well as the apricots but this time i was out of all o f the above. I had dates and walnuts and thought why not. Topped them with grated chocolate and coffee beans. ALso I cut them in rounds and they were quite good. it is the best scone recipe ever .

absolutely simple and delicious. the only scone recipe i ever use. like many others, I've swapped out the apricots for tart cherries, cranberries, crystallized ginger...i always have to double up the batch to meet my family's demand.

These scones were simple to make and delicious. I substituted dried cranberries for the apricots added additional lemon peel. I served them at a catered event with fresh apricot butter and they were a hit. I will certainly make them again.

Easy to make, but really quite boring. I would have to add much more lemon peel, and possibly some juice. Even then, I think the apricot is overpowering. Somehow, it looks like 4 forks are being saved, but I'm only giving it two.

so quick and easy! no cutting the butter into the flour. I use craisins or currants instead of the apricots and I use Meyer lemons for the zest. Fabulous!

Just pulled these together and had no problems with the liquid to dry ratio. Used what I had in the pantry, cranberries and orange peel. Used a wet hand to smooth the top and put raw brown sugar, just a dusting to add color and crunch.

Absolutely amazing. The whipping cream must be the magic ingredient. It's hard not to eat these in one sitting. Super super easy to make. I substitute dried cranberries for the apricots sometimes and it's almost even better. The tartness of the cranberries beautifully offsets the sweet sugar topping.

I've made this exactly as written several times, and the scones always come out perfectly! I didn't have enough cream for the exact recipe this morning, so I subbed almost one cup of thick Greek yogurt (full fat version of Fage), plus 1/4 cup+ of heavy whipping cream. As I mixed the wet & dry ingredients, I had to drizzle a little half & half to get the right consistency. The substitutions worked well, and I may continue this sub in the future. The lemon and apricot in the original recipe are well suited together. Other successful variations for the apricot: cranberry & pecan, fresh blueberry, etc. This reliable recipe seems to handle almost anything, especially if you treat the dough with a light touch.

It took all my willpower not to devour all twelve scones in one sitting! Mine were ever so slightly underdone on the inside; wonder if they need a slightly longer time at a lower temperature. Other than that, perfect. I will be trying this recipe with other fruits besides dried apricots.

Rating: 4
This was amazing. I didnt have apricots, so I used dried cranberries and threw in some chocolate chips. this is a great base for making scones. I found the scones to be much lighter and airer than other reviewers. I actually stored them open overnight hoping they would dry out a bit more. They are kind of biscuit like to me. But delicious! Best straight out of the oven.

Nice scones!

This is a perfect base recipe for scones. I don't think I'll ever try another one. I made it exactly as written the first time around and they came out really well. I found that brushing the scones with butter is unnecessary and I haven't continued to do it upon further executions of this recipe. The scones come out so light that I don't like to brown the tops and undermine their soft texture. I've changed up the flavors - apple-cinnamon, pumpkin, cranberry, etc. and they always come out great. I think the key to making these come out perfectly is not over- handling the dough. Awesome recipe. Absolutely delicious!

Rating: 4
This is my go-to recipe for scones. Light moist and scrumtious. I switch out the flavorings for a bit of a change (cinnamon-nut, vanilla-current, orange-cranberry, whatever...), but the basic recipe is so easy, it's a keeper. My husband cannot get enough of them. I get 8 good-sized scones from this (despite the fact that it says 12) and they last about 30 minutes after I take them out of the oven. Gone. A caution: If you like your scones denser and drier, then this isn't the scone recipe you want.

Rating: 4
I was testing these for a brunch because they sounded so easy, and they were! Instead of apricots (didn't have on hand) I used frozen blueberries. The resulting dough was very cold/crumbly, and I was sure I'd ruined them, but they turned out perfect after exactly 15 minutes in the oven -- delicately light in the middle and crisp and golden brown on top. Best I've ever had.

I, like many others, swapped out the apricots for dried tart cherries. Delicious. But my dough was far too wet at first, so I had to add some extra flour, about 1/2 cup. Nothing too disastrous!

Excellent scones. I added dried tart cherries. Wonderful with home made orange curd.

This was my first time making scones, and I agree with the other top reviews and will definitely make again. I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose flour, they didn't seem to rise as much as expected, but they didn't taste any different because of it. I also deleted the dried apricots, and sprinkled the top with vanilla bean sugar.

Made these for a Mother's Day brunch - these disappeared. Consensus was that these were the best scones any of us had ever enjoyed. We were a little short on whipping cream so I substituted 1/4 cup of milk, and my wife loves Trader Joe's dried tart cherries so I used those, chopped, in place of apricots. Outstanding scones.

I made this recipe as written except that I used chopped candied ginger instead of apricots (about 3 oz). I had read the rave reviews on this site for a ginger scone recipe, but it seemed more difficult and had a higher caloric content (lots of butter) and fewer servings. This recipe was both easy and delicious, and the saved calories justified a little lemon curd and clotted cream!

This has been my standard fail-proof scone base recipe for years. I use the flour, sugar, baking powder, cream and add whatever I happen to have handy in the kitchen at the moment. I particularly like using orange peel, 1 cup of frozen cranberries and a handful of chopped walnuts. I've made this with a variety or different flours (whole wheat, buckwheat, etc) and these have always been quick, easy, and delicious.

Rating: 4
I found these to be some of the easiest scones to make, no egg and no butter! I roll my dough to a 1/8 inch oblong, 6 to 8 and I add sliced strwberries in a single layer then fold over the length before cutting into wedges. You could also break the dough in half and roll out to small circles that you cover half with strawberries before folding over. Just make sure one edge of each wedge comes back together or is folded over so the top and bottom don't separate. My neighbor absolutely loves these, and I've made them twice now. They are especially moist and sort of taste like they have a tart jelly in the middle.

Rating: 2
Usually I appreciate and enjoy subtle flavors. Honestly though, these are a bit bland. Perhaps try them with a more tart fruit (the apricot is too mellow for these scones - dried cranberries or cherries might be better). The best thing about these is the texture - light and fluffy - and that they were a good use for some soon-to-expire whipping cream that I had knocking about in the fridge.

Rating: 4
I love scones - this is the absolute best recipe I have found. I keep on trying new ones but I always come back to this one. As usual the secret is to not overwork the dough. Brush all the butter on the scones. I have tried all kinds of dried fruit, orange peel etc. Fantastic! The recipe is always requested.

This was easy and very good! I was looking for a scones recipe that had reduced the fat and sugar somewhat and this fits the bill with all the taste! I made the recipe as written but, did use heaping measures of lemon peel, which I love. One point, I used a small cookie sheet and they almost grew into one big scone! I don't bake often enough I guess. Next time I will give them all a little more breathing space and they could be cut smaller for more scones. I live at high altitude and they needed to cook about 20 mins. instead of 15.

I love this recipe! For special occasions I cut out shapes with cookie cutters. The sugar and lemon zest on top is the best. The person who had problems with the sugar burning may have had too hot of an oven, had the scones too close to an upper heat source, or overcooked them.

Nice flavor with the apricots and lemon and all around good texture. However, a warning: the lemon sugar topping gets clumpy and then burns when baking, making the scones inedible. I tried plain sugar and that worked better.

These were delicous, I was at a friends house and did not want to send her out for apricots so I used toasted sliced almonds, about 1/3 cup then added a few more on top with the lemon sugar, they were great.

BIG HOWEVER: Always use an insulated cookie sheet or they will scortch black on the bottom every time. I always use a silpat on top of an insulated sheet for added protection

I love how quick and easy this scone recipe is compared to some others. I make it even quicker and easier by using some lemon oil (Boyajian) in place of the lemon zest. I have made the lemon/apricot flavor, have substituted candied ginger for the apricot (good!) and have also made just plain lemon (great with raspberry jam). Tonight I'll be trying orange/cranberry (probably with some orange oil). I usually skip the topping - doesn't seem worth the extra effort and is too dessrt-like for my tastes. Also - I find it easiest to pat the dough into a circle and cut into wedges with a pizza slicer. These freeze well and can be reheated easily in the toaster oven in about the same time it takes to make a cup of tea.

Excellent scone recipe. I did one batch with lemon/ginger and one batch with orange/cranberry. I love it that these don't get all crumbly like some other scones do.

I make this scone at my coffee shop, subsituting different dried fruits for the apricots. (try dried blueberries, cherries, currants, crystalized ginger or dried figs) I also sometimes subsitute 1/2 cup of the flour for a 1/2 cup of cornmeal. This adds a special crunch to the scone. Instead of melted butter, I often brush with cream-egg yolk mixture. I make these scones 6 times a week, both the orginal recipe and with all the variations - they sell out every day!

This is a perfect scone recipe and a great starting point for other fillings as well. I've made them as written - perfectly yummy...and also tried other filling substitutions as well. 1) Added a few white chocolate chips and chopped nuts to original recipe. The kids LOVED them. 2) Substituted dried mango (new at Costco) for apricots and added some nuts. I think any kind of dried fruit would work well. This is an all-time keeper - easy, too.

Lighter than air, despite the cream? Uh Huh. Easy? Oh, yeah. These are BY FAR the favorite scone in my collection, and I have tried quite a few! Left out the apricots- didn't have 'em. Might go with the dried tart charries... Try baking them on a baking stone-

I have made these scones 6 times and the recipe is perfection. They are not too dry or sweet, perfect for breakfast. I used dried cranberries instead of the apricots and they were delicious. This was my first experience making the scones, and was pleasantly pleased. A small piece of advice, the scones taste better the second day. I place them in a zip-lock bag for freshness.

I only had 1 cup of cream, so I added a scant 1/4 cup whole milk plus 2 T melted butter. Seemed to work just fine. I used apricots as I had them on hand, and we enjoyed the lemon & apricot flavors very much. Easy & tasty

I did a testdrive with these a few weeks before my tea party, and I added lemon juice to heighten the flavor. BIG mistake. Way too wet when cutting out the wedges, but still incredibly delicious when baked. For the actual tea party, I made a glaze with lemon juice and powdered sugar, thereby eliminating the need for the juice in the dough. I wouldn't DREAM of adding apricots to this recipe. It is EXCELLENT.

I have been making hese scones for years, since I found the recipe on the net.

I sometimes add dried cranberries or other dried fruits and they are always the biggest hit. Barbara from Stratford, CT

I think I screwed up by using about 3/4 c. cream and the rest (semi-skimmed) milk. It was an absolute nightmare trying to get it back to dough once it was too wet. But that said, the scones still taste light and yummy. I also used crystallized ginger rather than apricot. A nice, delicate flavor and not too many calories compared to the butter-laden variety.

Rating: 4
Excellent! My husband really wanted rehydrated (dried) blueberries, and as we had them on hand, and were without dried apricots, that is what we did. They were delicious. In addition to that substitution, we ran out of whipping cream at 1 cup, so we used 1% milk for the remaining quarter of a cup. I was shocked that they were light and delicate, despite the fact that they contain no butter inside the scones. They will replace my old scone recipe that has 5 more TBL of butter. Very surprisingly, these are more delicate and have a superior texture.

I made these scones today with 1 alteration...I left out the apricots and put in a tbsp of poppy seeds. They go great with the lemon flavor. You don't even miss the butter and eggs that other recipes call for. These are light and not too sweet...just the way they should be. The topping is to die for!!! A definite keeper!!!

First time I REALLY disagree with other reviewers. To the point that I wonder if we are using the same recipe. Once I added the cream it turned to soup, I had to add more flour, the scones ended up gummy. From now on if I need apricot scones I will make the APRICOT-SOUR CREAM SCONES from this site. Much better. Let me know if I messed up, but I re-read the recipe ten times to figure out what I did wrong and can't figure it out.

These were a hit at our Mother's Day brunch (one guest even insisted on taking one with her for her plane ride that afternoon). The cream made for a very nice, light testure and made them come together quickly. I could not incorporate all the flour mixture, though, so next time I'll make sure I have a little extra cream to work with if necessary. Because of the dryness of the dough, I could not make a neat circle to cut into wedges, so I used a 3-inch round cutter and got 8 scones. I substituted orange zest and dried cranberries for the lemon and apricot and skipped the topping.

This is a great combination of ingredients, and very tender--surprising to me since the recipe lacks the usual butter. I'll plan to make these again, but with one change: I'll put less than a tablespoon of the lemon rind in the scone batter. The dried apricots I used were tart enough on their own, and this was exaggerated by the lemon.

From the first time I made these scones, they have become a Sunday morning tradition in our house. After serving these to my house guests, they all ask for the recipe.

I served these at a recent tea party, and all the guests raved about the scones. An easy, quick recipe.

I substituted orange zest and currants for the lemon and apricot. They were wonderfully light and soft. Not short, crumbly and too sweet like most I've found in coffee and specialty shops.
