4 forks my way, though! Make a modified roux - 2 tbsp butter melted, soften 1 small diced onion and add 2-3 tbsp flour. Cook for 1 min on medium heat. Add 3/4 c of warmed chicken stock, slowly - whisking all the way. After the stock is incorporated and the contents have become a very thick paste, add 3/4 c half and half. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a strong simmer. After approximately 10 min, add 1 tsp lemon juice, 1/4 c chopped dill and salt/pepper. Delish!

I thought this was delicious and very simple to prepare. I was looking for a good cream sauce recipe for some leftover cooked lobster I had on hand and this was perfect. I substituted seafood stock for the clam sauce since I didn't have any, added 1/2 teaspoon of tarragon (better with lobster in my opinion)reducing the dill by as much, and added 3 minced garlic cloves to the sauce while it thickened to add more flavor. I did substitute 1/2 + 1/2 for the cream because I had none which made the sauce a bit thin but I thought it was still fine--probably not as rich as it would have been. Despite my changes it still turned out great and not a bit was leftover.

I made this one without the clam juice, but instead just a dash of chicken bouillon and thai fish sauce. As my dill plant was low, I made up the remainder with parsely and chives. It was delicious with wholewheat fettucine.

Very underwhelmed with this. It's easy enough but that's the only real plus. I added nutmeg as recommended but still found the dish lacking in taste. I won't make it again.

I omitted the clam juice entirely, upped the smoked salmon, and reduced the cream with a tiny bit of white wine. I used dried dill and still enjoyed it very much. It was wonderful--super-rich and very flavorful. I imagine that the quality of the final dish reflects the quality of the fish used, so don't go cheap on this one. Really yummy.

This was a good way to use up some smoked salmon we had left over. It was good, but I found I had to add a LOT of salt to give it a real flavor. I added 2 TB butter as well.

As this was my recipe submitted to Bon Appetit, I would like to point out that the original recipe did not call for bottled clam juice, but rather 2 cups heavy cream, as well as a pinch of nutmeg, and fresh dill (not dried). The clam juice, I think, would add only a fishy, watery flavor and texture to the sauce, and the dried dill is not worth comparing to the fresh product. The fresh dill, smoked salmon and nutmeg are the only flavors necessary to add depth and flavor to what should be a very simple, rich and creamy sauce.

Might I suggest to add a touch of nutmeg & granulated garlic, a bit more of pepper & salt or Aromat (an awesome German seasoning found at Meijer's or a German deli), and a little dry white wine reduced with your clam juice...you can also use a can of clams in juice to add another layer.....enjoy

This dish is quick and absolutely delicious. We sometimes use chive or parsley instead of dill. Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!

This dish tasted about as good as the effort put into it. Very easy to make, but not much flavor outside of the clam juice. Needs something more than dill to offset the fishy taste.

Very disappointed, but my husband loved it! Since he's highly allergic to shellfish, I substituted the clam juice with fat-free chicken broth, which might have made the difference. Frankly, I thought it was rather bland.

So easy to prepare. 3 ounces of smoked salmon is adequate for two - which is how it is often packaged. Reasonably inexpensive to make, but tastes expensive.

This recipe is a secret weapon! It is exceptionally good (a restaurant could easily get $25 a plate for it) and as easy as boxed macaroni and cheese. I didn't happen to have any dill and probably used 2-3 oz. of smoked salmon, but it was fabulous nonetheless!

Made this for a small dinner gathering; I used farfalla (bow-tie) pasta instead and it was wonderful! Creamy enough, without being too overwhelming. Definately will make again and again!
