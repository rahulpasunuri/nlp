Due to the price and difficulty of getting veal in my area (you have to order it ahead from my butcher), I made this with a pork sirloin roast. It was delicious! However, because of the way the meat sliced, I ended up putting it in a baking dish, tucking the onions and mushroom mixtures around it, and smothering the whole thing in the Mornay sauce. Not quite as elegant as Sue Ann Niven's presentation, but I got rave reviews.

You should really consider using a different meat. In addition to the fact that veal is more expensive and less flavourful than other cuts of beef it is extreamily unethical. The torture that these animals go through (deliberate atrophy of muscles, induced anemia and confinement is discussing) It truly is the culinary equivalent to ivory http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOWQOXeJyUM&feature=related

For years I've wanted to make this dish because I'm a huge Mary Tyler Moore fan. I finally got around to it and made it for a friends birthday. It was a HUGE hit. I doubled the recipe to serve 12. I followed the recipe to the letter except for the cooking time. I only braised the veal for 35 minutes and that was almost too long (as others have noted watch this step closely). After dinner we adjourned to the living room and watched "The Dinner Party" episode and had a good laugh.

This is as traditional as it gets. First off, you'll be hard-pressed to find a recipe anywhere, so thank you Epicurious! I used a beef tenderloin in lieu of the veal. You obviously have to undercook it through the braising, otherwise you will end up with gray beef. The soubise took me three tries, as the rice kept absorbing too much liquid, so watch that step. Otherwise, it's not difficult - just time consuming. The mornay really makes the dish exceptionally rich.

I made a simplified entree from this recipe by borrowing some of its ingredients. My out-of-town company just loved this dish! I first tenderized some veal cutlets and lightly dredged them in flour, seasoned them with salt, garlic powder, and freshly ground pepper, and browned them in large pan. I sauteed a finely chopped onion and a minced garlic clove, and added them to the veal, followed by a large can of mushroom pieces and stems, including the mushroom juice. I added a cup of chicken broth and 1/3 cup of dry Vermouth to the pan, covered the pan with a lid and simmered the veal on low heat until the veal was tender, around 1 1/2-2 hrs., adding a little more chicken broth when the liquid was getting too low. I removed the cooked veal cutlets and set them aside. I poured the cooking liquid with the mushrooms and onions into a food processor/blender, blended the ingredients until it became a smooth sauce, and transferred it back to the pan, adding unsalted butter and cream to the sauce. I made jasmine rice, adding sauteed mushrooms and onions, and some garlic powder, salt, pepper, and a couple of tablespoons of butter to the cooked rice. At serving time, I first placed the rice on a plate, then placed the warmed veal, some of it partially covering the rice, and then ladled the mushroom sauce in a circle around, the veal. I also served broiled slices of tomato that were first lightly drizzled with olive oil and topped with crushed garlic cloves and a little bit of salt, adding fresh parsley to the top for color.

Tasty recipe, but time intensive and you must watch meat temperature. We followed recipe and it was WAY overdone (frustrating given the LONG prep time). Chilling the veal and dressing later requires 25 min to reheat, at which point you've overcooked it. Recommend that you pull it at 140 if you plan to dress & glaze immediately, or 137/138 if you plan to chill before dressing.

Following the suggestion of another reviewer, we braised the veal in our slow cooker on day one,chiiled it, then made the soubise, duxelles and sauce the following day. We made one change in the recipe -- we substituted barley for the rice in the soubise. We had and lost a recipe for Veal Prince Orloff that made this change and it is excellent. Another suggestion -- freeze half the braised veal and sauce, then make fresh soubise and duxelles for an encore in a month. An easy, delicious and beautiful dish -- especially when made over two days. A veal shoulder roast -- slightly less expensive than a loin and sometimes easier to find works very well -- the roast is going to be braised anyway.

Amazing dish for special occasions! For me works the best if I make meat a day or two earlier, it's easier to assemble. Also, Soubise recipe is very useful for all kind of white meats. It's not for inexperienced cooks, but it's worth every effort!

I made a modified version with breaded and fried veal scallopini lightly coated with a Mornay sauce combined with sauteed mushrooms and shallots and flavored with white wine. Run under the broiler before serving. Quick, easy and delicious. The breading beats the rice for texture and flavor.

I made a modified version (used something else in place of the veal), and loved it. It was, somewhat surprisingly, worth the time. A reliable recipe for a tasty dish.

This was a labor of love. Watch carefully the temperature of the veal and check often, as it rises more quickly than the recipe says. This is an elegant presentation suitable for any dinner party.

This was out of this world. Lots of work, but well worth the effort. I made at last minute and couldn't get the veal roast from my butcher, so substituted beef tenderloin and served for a dinner party and not a single morsel was left on anyone's plate. Can;t wait to do it with veal.

I made this for my husband last weekend because I wanted to make a dish that was incredibly involved and fun at the same time. This recipe fit that bill and was amazing. We didn't even have left overs. I can't wait until I have time to do it again!

As an added soucon, that episode of the Mary Tyler Moore Show featured Rhoda inviting a prospective boyfriend to this soiree. There was no place for him at the table, so he had to sit at an occasional table--away from the dining table. The prospective boyfriend was Henry Winkler, before he became famous as "The Fonz" on "Happy Days." There are some recipes that are simply NOT worth the time or expense.

Maybe when I have a week or two...

Finally, the dish made famous by Sue Ann Nivens on that hilarious episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Warning - if Lou Grant is one of your guests, this will serve only 4.
