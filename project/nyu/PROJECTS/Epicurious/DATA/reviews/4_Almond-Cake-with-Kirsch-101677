This cake was amazing. I couldn't find any almond paste so I made my own and it didn't cause any problems. I also reduced the sugar and doubled the amount of liqueur (I had homemade cherry and honey spirits on hand) and added a little bit more flour to make up for the excess liquid. The cake was moist and sweet and definitely a favorite.

I LOVED this cake, although it stuck to the pan. I should have read the other reviews and put parchment in the pan. Before serving, I put some sour cherries in syrup over the top, and now the cake is all gone. Extra Yum, I'll make it again and again.

Wonderful recipe to have on hand... quick, easy, and delicious! Best of all, it easily adapts to a gluten free diet. I baked this substituting only potato starch for the 1/3 cup flour and it was fabulous! It tends to stick more easily but actually turns out more moist and flavorful than the "flour" version. Treat a celiac friend... they'll LOVE you!!

Like several others I used an 8 oz. can of almond paste instead of the more expensive tube and found it worked perfectly. I also used parchment in an 8 inch springform pan so there were no sticking problems. I froze the finished cake for a week or two, served the thawed cake with sliced fresh strawberries. It was well received.

This is the go-to recipe for birthdays and events. Can be made in less than an hour and I've had to give out the recipe numerous times. Always works. Always delicious. Not too sweet. Not overdone.

Let me just say that I hate almond flavored foods and also liquor flavored sweets. However for Valentine's Day, I decided to make this cake purely out of love for my boyfriend, whom loves both combinations. And only for curiosity, did I take a bite. WOW!!! What a surprise! This is possibly the best cake that I've ever made and quite possibly the best cake I've ever eaten. I can't stop eating the cake! Just two little hints: don't let the lack of flour or the consistency of the batter scare you. It'll bake just fine. And instead of using Kirsch, I used Blackberry Brandy and vanilla extract. Oh so divine and simple to make. You definitely won't be disappointed.

I have made this cake many times, and each time it gets stellar reviews. It's simple and very delicious. When I don't have Kirsch, I use white rum. Last night, I paired it with mandarine orange sorbet from LeNotre's ice cream cookbook.

My 12 year old daughter made this for my 45th birthday. Oh, did it ever sing! I am saving this recipe for the next time I need "company cake." Not particularly pretty (it fell apart coming out of the pan), but oh, was it moist and flavorful, with the most perfect crust. It had a real rustic appearance, though, which I like.

This was delish. I used amaretto in lieu of kirsch and sprinkled the top with almonds and powdered sugar when it was done cooking. Very moist. If you like amaretti cookies, you'll love this. If you don't like them, you probably won't be too keen on this cake. It's almost identical to a Thomas Keller recipe.

Served this for a belated Valentine's dinner tonight and it was loved by all! I used the 8 oz. can of almond paste and it worked just fine. Finally gave me the chance to break open the bottle of kirsch that I think I bought to make fondue, but never got around to.

I have never been able to get Kirsch, so I substitute Grand Marnier. I serve the cake with strawberries macerated in Grand Marnier, and with whipped cream. The cake is equally delicious plain. Truly one of my favorite cakes.

Taste is good but the cake completely collapsed. Followed recipe exactly. Would not make again as usually I only make desserts for company, and this would not make a good presentation. The orange almond torte/marsala cream on this site works much better.

This was a really delicious cake. Did what lots of others did with grating the almond paste and worked like a charm. However, did make a few changes - tried the mix of 1/3c butter+1/4 c olive oil as someone else suggested and came out really moist, actually a bit too moist, so will probably decrease the butter to 1/4 c next time. Used only 1/2 c sugar and still thought it was a tad bit sweeter than I liked. And substituted the cake flour with whole wheat pastry flour. Came out beautifully. I didn't have kirsch, so used some chambord instead, but couldn't taste it in the cake. So served it with a berry compote made with some chambord. Loved by all. Thanks much. This is a keeper.

This cake was as delicious as everyone said. It was moist, and the almond flavor was delicate and not overpowering. I did make a few substitutions that worked out quite well. I'm not a fan of butter, so I used 1/3 stick plus 1/4 cup olive oil instead of the whole stick of butter. I might even cut out all the butter next time. I didn't have kirsch so I added a bit more of almond extract and a dash of vanilla extract as well. I'll try it with amaretto next time, but I thought the flavor was still really nice. I also found the cake to be a tad bit too sweet, so will cut back on the sugar next time. Finally, I had that same problem of the pan sticking. Will listen to everyone else and use parchment paper next time. All in all, it was pretty easy to make and so yummy!

Delicious cake, dense and rich without being leaden. Regarding what seem to be the common concerns: I used a microplane to grate semi-frozen almond paste into the batter, which worked great. I baked mine in a 9' tinfoil pan lined with parchment paper; it took about 45-50 minutes for the tester to come out clean. It was nicely browned all over and the center was cooked through, so I think the cooking time in the recipe is simply too short. I'd make it again with a sour cherry sauce, or as a layer cake with raspberry jam between the layers.

Rating: 3
I think this is a fairly awesome caked, but I can't figure out the cooking time and what the texture should be. Even after cooking for 40 minutes the tester didn't come out clean and still had a batter like substance on it even though the top was dark brown. I took it out to let it cool and the bottom seemed totally undercooked, though it was delicious -- should it be like a cake texture or something else? Any advice?

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe. The cake is moist and full of almond flavor. I used orange liquor instead of kirsch and it was nice and subtle. Butter and wax paper made the cake come out of the pan very nicely. It was perfect served along side some macerated straberries. Would definately be nice in smaller pans, like tea cakes. Will definately make again.

Rating: 4
Wonderful!!!! This cake is just wonderful. It has a delicious flavor and the texture is pleasantly crumbly. I served it with a cherry kirsch sauce; however it was just as good plain. Easy to make too!

Rating: 4
PS to add to my earlier review, I find that if I butter and flour the pan very thoroughly, the cake is easy to remove intact. Lining with parchment or wax paper as other reviewers suggest is also a good idea. Finally, I find that the baking time until a tester comes out clean is slightly longer than the recipe indicates, by 5 or 10 minutes. This also helps the cake to rise thoroughly and have a firmer structure (although it is still moist inside), which helps prevent sagging in the center when the cake cools.

I made this for an office Christmas party, and it got devoured. I dressed it up a bit by using maraschino cherries (with the stems on) to decorate around the edge of the cake plate. I love this cake because it's so easy to make (provided you have a heavy-duty mixer like a Kitchenaid), and it's always a hit.

This cake was superb! I made it for the groom's cake at a wedding, and everyone said it was better than the wedding cake. I tripled the recipe and made it into a 4-layer, 2-tier cake with the Blueberry Filling from the Blueberry and Orange Layer Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting, and the Vanilla Frosting (both from this site). I didn't want to buy Kirsch just for this recipe, so I just added a dash of vanilla. The cake is very dense and rich, and the tartness from the blueberry was perfect. I've never liked almond-flavored things, but I'll definitely make this again!

Rating: 4
This cake is excellent. Easy to make. Definitely moist. Scrumptious almondy flavor. The only substitution I made was to use amaretta instead of the kirsch. The only problem I had with the cake is that there were no leftovers! Although I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 12x7 baking dish, there was not one crumb leftover. I plan to make this cake again for my birthday in June. This time I will increase all ingredients for a 12" round double layer birthday cake. Expensive, but approximately the same amount of money I would pay for a birthday cake from a local bakery. In my opinion the flavor of the cake is well worth the expense of the almond paste.

I made it for the first time yesterday. It was really good. Then again I just love anything almond. I used a 8 oz can of almond paste and it was just perfect.

I've made this three times, and it is wonderful; however, be careful not to use too high a speed on your mixer and not to overbeat it. The first time I made it there were no problems. The sencond and third times, I overbeat it and it ran out of the pan in the oven. But it's a wonderful cake when you can get it right!

Rating: 4
This is simply sublime! I substitute this recipe for the cake in the similar one with sugared cherries and kirsch cream on this site, as this cake is more dense and much richer (the other tends to be angel food cakeish). As I am a caterer, my customers love it, it stays well, freezes well and I particularly like to cut it into small rounds or fill in mini cupcake tins and top with cream or berries. If you make them small, reduce cooking time to about 20 minutes or so.

Rating: 4
I didn't have any kirsch, so I substituted one TBSP of fresh lemon juice and the chopped zest from one lemon. I used a springform pan and lined the bottom with parchment. When I transferred the cake to a cake plate, it fell a little in the middle, and my dad suggested I fill it with whipped cream. I was skeptical, but we did just that and then surrounded the cake with quartered fresh strawberries. The fluffy, barely sweetened whipped cream and tart berries offset the sweet denseness of the cake, as did the lemon essence, and it was as beautiful to look at as it was to eat. It was a huge hit with everyone, even the children.

Great recipe but mine STUCK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN. I was skeptical about only buttering and flouring the pan and my skepticism was well founded. Next time I'll line a springform pan with wax paper instead.

If you can find it, use canned 8oz almond paste instead of the tube stuff. It blends in without any difficulty. The fragrance and flavour of this cake is wonderful: just the right amount of almond-yness without being overpowering. Definitely addictive.

Prepared this lovely cake to be served with cherries in spiced wine from this site. The fragrance and flavors are wonderful and I will definitely enjoy serving this many times. Parchment lined pan and running a sharp knife around the pan immediately upon removing from oven helps to prevent sticking to the pan and sinking in the middle. Great cake

Excellent, easy cake! Had almost a full bottle of kirsch left over from a fondue party so thought I'd try this... Almond paste wasn't a problem, but mine was pretty soft. Topped it with some homemade whipped cream that had a little bit of sugar and kirsch added to it!

Make this! Was bringing dessert to dinner party where the guests were used to a bit more sophisticated dining - there wasn't any left to take home and was asked where in heaven I had gotten the recipe!

Intense almond flavor, very moist, and easy recipe. It was great w/vanilla ice cream and some cherries I preserved in kirsch. Had no problem w/almond paste using my paddle attachment for my Kitchenaid mixer -- just added the paste in small amounts at a time to incorporate them. Used a 9" pan and baked for exactly 35 minutes -- perfect!

This cake is absolutely fabulous! I have made it twice now and both times received many requests for the recipe. If you like marzipan you will love this cake. The only change I made was to add extra kirsch. I also grated the almond paste with a cheese grater.

This cake is one of the best I have ever had! I used amaretto instead of kirsch and it turned out very well. The almond flavor of the cake reminded me of the frangipane the French put in their "galette des rois". I will definitely do this cake again.

Rating: 4
I keep making this recipe because people are asking for this cake! So I had to figure out a way to crumble the marzipan more efficiently. I froze the 7 oz log of almond paste overnight and then grated it in the food processer. With what was left I put through a box grater. Problem solved and quickly, too. Another tip, let the eggs and sugar cream until they are almost white; makes it even lighter. Serve with pureed raspberries to which you have added kirsch, sugar and maybe a touch of lemon juice. A great dessert!

This cake was wonderful. Unfortunately, I hadn't read through everyone's reviews before making it. I also suffered trying to incorporate the almost paste. I was using my stand mixer and changed from the metal beater to the paddle attachment, which worked out great. I was very glad I lined the pan in parchment paper, as it stuck a bit to the sides of the pan. All in all, a great dessert.

Rating: 4
This is an EXCELLENT recipe. It's got a great almond flavor without being too sweet and it's nice and moist. I took other reviewers advice and finely ground the almond paste in the food processor before adding it to the mixer. I used parchment paper that I buttered and floured and only had a tiny part of it stick to the pan. My husband keeps asking me when I'm going to make it again!

I'm not a baker so I'm thrilled to find a cake that comes out moist and delicious with so little work. I used refrigerated almond paste from a local bakery (small pinches beat in just fine w/my mixer) and subbed brandy for the kirsch (as suggested by the Joy of Cooking, which has a nearly identical recipe). Parchment on the bottom of the pan helped it come out in one piece. Tasty as is, but next time I'll top it w/fruit (peach compote?) and whipped cream.

Rating: 4
Every time I make this I get requests for the recipe. It's delicate, moist and best of all it's so simple. A stand mixer definitely helps to mix the almond paste well. If you don't have one just be patient, it will mix eventually!!!! I've made it both with a stand mixer and with a hand mixer and it turned out fantastic always. It's a great recipe to use for a tea-party or bridal shower.

I substituted blackberry brandy for the cherry and used a 9" spring-form pan. Baked it for 30 minutes, but I think it could have used a minute or two less. I should have used parchment paper, but managed to run a knife along the bottom. Cake was very dense, greasy. I made a frosting using powdered sugar, butter, milk and brandy(2 TBS), but it was a bit odd- separating almost. Still, I drizzled it on the cake and I think it rounded out the flavor. It was better the second day.

If you like marzipan THIS is your cake! Very easy--made it for my husband's birthday dinner and he was head over heels. Definitely needs whipped cream to complete, in our opinion.

WOW!! So Almondy, Moist, Dense and Delicious. I have to admit, I freaked out when I saw it collapse and it came out in pieces (important dinner party). But after a small recunstruction effort, a lot of powdered sugar, a big dollop of fresh whipped cream in the center and another dollop Lingonberry preserves on top, and it looked a master piece. Sort resembled a volcano but I got major ohs and ahs at presentation and when eating. This is a keeper.

I made this cake again for a New Year's day party and it got really rave reviews. Just wanted to add (see my comments below) that this time I made it in a bundt pan. It therefore came out as a low dense ring and even though I had trouble getting it out of the pan, when I put the powdered sugar on top, you couldn't even see the break. Someone at the party said it tasted like martzipan (sp?). There's another almond cake recipie here at Epicurious that seems to be double the size of this one but it uses the same amount of almond paste (i.e. half the almond taste!). Again, this recipie is incredibly easy to make (make sure the paste is soft)but with expensive bakery taste.

Rating: 4
Great. All ages liked it. Even a 12-year-old who "hates nuts" loved it. As for the problem of incorporating the almond paste: I microwaved the Odense paste (actually, I used the Marzipan) for 30 seconds at Medium High, which made it really easy to pinch off small pieces to throw in the mix.

This cake was wonderful. Follow the other's direction for the almond paste. I added butter cream frosting with toasted coconut---Really rich, but incredibly yummy. It was one of those things where you think you could never eat another piece (so rich), then an hour later I found myself eating another!

This recipe is such a find. The taste is rich, the texture incredible, moist with a soft crumb. Definitely use parchment or waxed paper to line pan. Yes, the almond paste is labor intensive but well worth it. The tips from other reviewers are right on target. Use the pastry blender or mini food processor or simply pinch any remaining lumps between fingers. Other than the almond paste issue, the recipe is quick and easy. The dusting of powdered sugar is simplicity at its best and makes for an elegant presentation. I've sampled macaroons and marzipan in some of the best bakeries in Paris and this cake is a contender!

I made this cake last week to bring into work and I thought it was one of the best unfrosted cakes I've ever tasted. I made a double recipe and baked it in a 12 by 7" glass pan. I only baked it for about 42 minutes and I didn't use the Kirsch. Everyone at work loved it too. I'm going to make it again this weekend. I highly recommend it.

Rating: 3
I had to bake it for close to 50 min. too. Using my handmixer to blend in the almond paste was working, but it was becoming time consuming, so I tried the pastry cutter trick. Worked like a charm! Cake was moist, incredibly rich and had good flavor. I only have two reservations. 1. Couldn't really taste the kirsch. 2. Cake was great in the mouth, but don't eat it with your hands -frighteningly greasy. Then again, serves me right for eating pieces with my hands.

The ultimate for almond lovers! This cake is incredibly rich and decadent. Dust with powdered sugar. Two thumbs up!

A really delicious cake. I found that it was a bit dry towards the edge by the time the center was done (perhaps this has something to do witht he fact that I used a 9" pan instead of 8" which I did not have). A kirsch syrup would be an easy remedy. I think that this would be delicious with fresh berries.

Oh YES!!! THE best. If you like almond flavor and a moist cake, this is it. Mine took 50 mins to bake and instead of dusting with powdered sugar, I brushed it with extra Kirsch...absolutely fabulous.

This cake was so delicious that my boyfriend and I cut sliver after sliver off, noshing, until we realized we had eaten half the cake! The flavor was yummy, and the texture was dense, yet very very light. As for the almond paste problem other readers have had, simple solution, Food Processor and a nice humid day! I had the butter, sugar, and almond paste smooth as silk and fluffy in 1 minute flat! Even without any humid weather, I used a can of almond paste *Is there a difference?* and it blended nicely in the processor. You could also make your own almond paste *which would be softer* using almonds, sugar, an egg yolk OR egg whites. This site has a recipe for it, and it stores well. All in all, I will make this again and again! Kudos to whomever came up with this one :-)

I came upon this recipe while looking for something like the almond-flavored white cake my mother used to make for my birthday, but this isn't that cake - it's better! It's a lovely cake, deep golden brown on the outside and yellow on the inside, and delicious, very moist and fluffy with a pronounced almond flavor. The only slight problem I had was that the cake rose higher around the edges than in the middle, but it could be that my baking powder is old and needs replacing. I used the tips below for the almond paste (squeezed the package before buying to make sure it was Play-Doh soft and broke it up into small pieces, no bigger than the top joint of my index finger) and had no trouble mixing it with my stand mixer. There were still a few tiny almond paste lumps before putting the cake in the oven, but they did not affect the texture of the finished cake. This would also be nice with some berries, peaches, or cherries.

A big thanks to the cook who suggested using a pastry blender--it worked great to mix the room-temperature butter, sugar, almond paste and eggs together. Then we used a hand mixer for the remaining ingredients. I couldn't find kirsch so I used regular cherry brandy and the cake was FABULOUS. We made it for guests and got rave reviews.

Rating: 3
Very up-town taste, cherries on the side a good idea. I have found the consistancy of marzipan to vary greatly from rock-hard to play-dough soft even in the same brand. I presume it is due to how long it has been on the shelf. I always squeeze first looking for the softest package.

I made this recipe the day before, for a party I was attending. I was unable to find the Kirsch, so I used Apricot Brandy instead. I also added a glaze: 1/4 cup of sour cream, 2 tbs sugar, 1 tbs Apricot Brandy. (The tartness of the Apricot and the sour cream went well with the sweetness of the cake.) The cake was complimented over and over. I was also impressed by the short cooking time and quick clean-up.

Okay, I have found the solution to the almond paste and butter problem! Use a PASTRY BLENDER to combine the ingredients; and the softer the butter, the easier it will be.

I recommend this for anyone who needs a rich almondy dessert. Fantabulous!

To solve the almond paste problem, break into small pieces and process in a mini-food processor. Check for any unblended pieces and continue until it's finely crumbled. This takes only a few minutes and it's worth it. Also, the mini processor is supereasy to clean. Hope this helps!!

This cake is fabulous!! Very rich but fabulous! It is a little difficult to blend in the almond paste but that is the nature of the almond paste. Be sure to break/cut the paste into small pieces before blending and you should have no trouble. I served a slice of this with a few sweet and tart cherries (one can of tart and one can of sweet mixed and drained well),topped it with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and a ribbon of melted bittersweet chocolate (1 melted 3oz Lindt bar is plenty). My guests all gave it rave reviews.

You have to like almonds to like this cake; and I do. Really delicious and really easy to make. However, the first time I made this, the cake stuck to the bottom of the pan. It was messy trying to get it out and it fell to pieces. (That didn't do anything to detract from the taste). I've made it a few times since then and I overcome the problem by lining the cake pan with parchment paper.

Very dense and delicious. Indescribably decadent. Made this for our dinner party tonight; lots of raves and none left for coffee in the morning. So sad! My dad loves macaroons, so I know he will love this. Think I'll make it on his next visit.
