Such a great recipe! It hits on sweet, tart, tangy, creamy, and crunchy! I have made this multiple times, and always to rave reviews. Works perfect as is, but is also quite tasty with other greens substituted for / paired with the arugula.

I make this salad at least once a month for lunch and almost anytime I have guests over for dinner. It gets rave reviews and lots of asks for the recipe. I love the combination of creamy, sweet and bitter. I usually substitute tangerines for oranges because they are easier to peel and a mix of bitter salad greens (arugula is expensive).

This was perfect & very colorful. Did not change anything and used pomegranate seeds. My husband's only comment was that he hoped he didn't have to wait for the holidays to have it again!

This is my favorite salad recipe - it's also very pretty. I've only used dried cranberries and feta cheese, and I always need extra dressing for full flavor. I have also made it with packaged "baby greens" and it is just as good as using all arugula, which is kind of expensive. Everyone I have served it to loves it!

I made this at Thanksgiving and it wasn't that great

used pomegranate seeds instead of cranberries, and also used pomegranate juice in the dressing.

This was amazing. Simple, yet very delicious. I had several people ask me for the recipe afterwards.

This is an absolutely wonderful salad. Its even tasty the next day. The arugula gets a little soggy, but the flavor is still there. I don't think I've ever made this with the full 14 oz of greens (just too much salad for two!), but the dressing keeps just fine. I also like to seed a couple of pomegranates at a time and store them in a container in the fridge. (Key to seeding a pom: cut in half and then work in a bowl filled with water. Seeds sink, icky white stuff floats, and no splatters!)

Surprisingly delicious. A staple now.

Delicious and refreshing salad. Wish I had been able to find Pomegranates, but I guess they were out of season. The cranberries were fine. I did add a splash of balsamic to the dressing to add a bit more flavor, and used half the amount of olive oil. Very good.

Awesome recipe! I cut the recipe in 1/2 and served it to 4 on new years eve. It was a huge hit- beautiful and delicious. I am making it again this weekend for a party of 12. Try it!!

I loved this recipe, and will definitely make it again for company. Very simple, beautiful and elegant. Worth seeding a pomegranate for. I used clementines instead of oranges, it was easier (if not as pretty) and tasted great!

I served this for an after-Thanksgiving family gathering. EVERYONE loved it and wanted the recipe. I did add extra lemon and orange juice and white wine vinegar to the dressing recipe. Also got a recipe for Spiced Pecans off of this web site and used walnuts instead and added them to the salad. The flavors are delectible and the colors so beautiful.

A very nice mix of flavors. Very refreshing, definitely going to make it again.

This is always a hit. I took the advice re: less olive oil. Also, I recommend using a honey goat cheese which mellows the sometimes sharp flavor of the dressing.

Rating: 4
I found the dressing to be bland. I added white balsamic vinegar until it had the kick I wanted. Also took advice of other cooks and only used 1/2 c. of oil. This would be a great full meal salad if you added some roasted chicken pieces.

A fantastic salad that looks beautiful no matter how you put it together. It has become a regular holiday/special occasion treat, and gets rave reviews every time.

Beautiful salad. Served on a long platter that allowed the salad toppings to be front and center! Added approx 1 Tbl of sugar to dressing, wanted just a little sweeter and replaced some of the greens with assorted lettuce. the pommegrante seeds are specacular if you can find them! many of my guests had not had them-Very Good!

Made this for Thanksgiving last year and everyone loved it. The tartness/freshness was a nice counterpoint to the richer, heavier food that followed. Definitely follow the tips re: less oil, etc. A keeper.

I made this dish for my New Year's Eve dinner party as a starter for a fish entree. My six guests loved it so much, they ate the full recipe's worth (10-12 servings)! Even though a few didn't realize there was a dressing (I kept it on the side), they were soon just as convinced as the rest of us that the dressing makes it even better. I went a little more heavy on the pomegranate seeds, but only because I adore them. I loved it with a little pepper, too.

Great salad! Added more lemon and less oil. I put the goat cheese and oranges on top at the end Would make again for sure.

Delicious salad, although the dressing did need some help (as other reviewers have noted). Was too oily, not just in texture but also in flavor, so I added more OJ concentrate and lemon juice (although it would have been better to start with less oil). Mixed in baby spinach with the arugula, as others have mentioned, and used dried cranberries. I wish I had read the reviews about not adding dressing until the last minute--it did indeed wilt! But it was good that way :)

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was loved by all! I used mixed greens instead of just arugula. I tossed the greens, oranges and pomegranates in a bowl and served the goat cheese, spiced pecans and dressing on the side to accomodate all tastes at the table.

I made this for Christmas dinner, was very colorful and festive looking. Everyone raved about it, the flavors blended fabulously. Next time I would coat the leaves with the dressing, serve on individual dishes, and then add the remaining ingredients to each dish.

This is an elegant-looking and very tasty salad! Made the full amount for a birthday dinner with 6 people & every last bit was eaten. Forgot the goat cheese, but it was fantastic anyway. Used pomegranate seeds, & this was one of the main items that got specific rave reviews. Used only 1/2 the amount of dressing, & that was plenty. Am making it again for Christmas dinner.

Fresh, tart and delicious. Used canned mandarin oranges and dried cranberries and it worked fine. We did add the dressing at the last minute as others suggested.

It was delicious! I used the cranberries rather than the pomegranate seeds, and went very light on the red onion. It was a big hit at Thanksgiving.

The dressing was very good. I liked to freshness of it. I made the salad just as written. It is more beautiful to look at than to eat.The dressing combined well with the mild goat cheese. In the future, I think I may decide to do something else with the dressing. A different combination of fruits and greens might be better.

I have made this salad several times for Thanksgiving last year and recently for brunches. I have always had good results, but agree that the dressing needs to be put on at the last minute. (I have served it on the side at brunch.)

I, too, made this salad for Thanksgiving and a couple of additional times. I used field greens in place of arugula, cut down on the amount of oil and used a specialty blood orange olive oil and received rave reviews. It's a refreshing salad if you're serving a heavy entry.

Ate this at friends house. Delicious, definite addition to the recipe box.

Made this as a starter for our Thanksgiving this year. Everyone loved it! I substituted field greens for the arugala (which may be too bitter for some). The dressing is very bright and marries well with the goat cheese. One word of advice, put the dressing on just before serving as the greens will wilt very quickly once they're coated with the dressing.

I made the salad for a recent dinner party. I was disappointed in the way the dressing turned out. I ended up using a bottled rasberry vinegratte dressing that I had on hand which saved the salad.

Unfortunately, I have to disagree with the other reviewers. I thought the dressing was too tart for the greens and when I tossed the dressing with the arugula, they wilted into a big mush. I only used a portion of the dressing and it still did this.

I have made this several times. I added some baby spinach to the salad and it was great. I like the dried cranberries much better than the pomegranate seeds. Everyone loved it!

Substituted canned mandarins for the oranges and served this salad for our Thanksgiving dinner. Very refreshing salad.

This is a delicious, beautiful salad. The only reason I gave this recipe 3 forks instead of 4 is because I had to modify the dressing. I made it as is and it was much too oily so I added extra oj concentrate and lemon juice until it tasted better. Other than that, this is a terrific holiday salad.
