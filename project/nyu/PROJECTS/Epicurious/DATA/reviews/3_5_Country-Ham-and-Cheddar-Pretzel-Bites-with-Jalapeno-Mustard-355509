Easy to make, although a bit of a project, however the results are worth the effort. I would make a few recommendations, firstly grate the cheese and rather than chop the ham, to cut it into long strips. Also, they are fabulous straight from the oven so timing is important. Once cooled they are less wonderful. I ran short of my prepared ham and made up the fourth batch using chopped chorizo sausage. Very nice! The dip is great with them.

They are a bit of a project but we love these and they keep well in the freezer. I rarely make dough and mine was not difficult to work with. Enjoy!

I don't mind spending a lot of time on something that is delicious but don't think these pretzels are worth the effort. They are good, but not good enough to be worth the effort.

Great recipe for salty snack fans. My notes: Notice the 4 hr prep time! Use Silpat. The assembly instructions are a little confusing. I would just say to roll up each 1/4 of the dough with the filling inside so it's a nice filled pretzel and then cut into bite sized pieces so it looks like the picture, pinching the edges of each bite so that it seals in the filling and you have less cheese ooze. Also, to get a nice browned exterior, pull them from the oven when almost done, spread melted butter with pastry brush and sprinkle with coarse kosher salt, then put back in the oven.

This recipe was a bit intimidating at first, but it's surprisingly easy to follow and my pretzel's turned out great! I added flour as needed until the dough was not too sticky (probably about 1/2 cup).

Well it's Christmas eve afternoon and I've just come back from the grocery store, having had to make a last-minute run for something else because my little pretzel bites -- having come out of the oven an hour ago -- are going straight into the garbage. Most of them stuck to the parchment paper and tore in half as I tried to remove them-- and it wasn't just the cheese oozing that made them stick because the cheese did not ooze out of all of them. I ate a couple that did come off ok and can't say I was very excited with the taste either. They were not as crispy as I had hoped. What a disappointment! and I do have a fair bit of experience with doughs like this so I don't know what went wrong but I am never going to try this again.

I just made a half batch, and used Virginia ham since this was a practice batch. The pretzel part is delicious, but I could barely taste the filling. More cheese is needed. I found the dough hard to work with; even with the extra flour it was very sticky, and made a huge mess in the kitchen.

Loved it! My husband ate a quarter of them and said, "I thought you said you were making a ton of these." Easy, delicious, and addictive. Gotta make a double batch next time.

Wow.I rarely review recipes but had to for this one. This was so delicious. It seems so ridiculously simple ( well it looks like a long list and long instructions but really it is easy peasy). I just love to find simple straight forward good recipes like these. I am a self admitted food snob who rarely would leave a recipe as written, but this is gold as it is. But (oops) I did follow other suggestions and add more cheese ( a really good aged one from Costco-Dubliner Cheddar). Oh and checking other pretzel dough recipes I found that an extra 1/2 cup flour was necessary to prevent stickiness. I have several batches of un boiled/baked pretzels sitting in the freezer ready to be pulled out for 30 mins and then boiled and baked during the Holidays. Really do yourself a favor and try this. Simple pleasures like this are hard to come by.

These were very simple to make and a big hit at my party - should have made more! I also didn't have ham, so substituted bacon. Next time I will use a lot more cheese than the recipe calls for, as there wasn't much in each bite. However, the pretzel dough is so tasty that I think these would be good completely unstuffed and my guests agreed. Perhaps I try them unstuffed but with a cheesy dip instead of the mustard? Either way, would definitely make again!

These were easy and soooo good. I made exactly as directed and they turned out very tasty. I like the idea of making them dessert with chocolate. I will definitely make these again. BTW, I used silpat so no problem with sticking.

I have never made pretzels before but thought this recipe was quite easy and well worth it - I shaped half of the dough in the form of traditional pretzels and used the other half as directed in the recipe - but filled with bittersweet chocolate (instead of ham & cheese). I sprinkled salt on the plain pretzels and for the chocolate filled pretzel bites - a mixture of salt, cinnamon and sugar.

Oh, and FYI - don't use wax paper in the oven...me being a beginning cook did not know this, but it does smoke a lot, and can apparently catch fire. I had some smoke, that's it, but not ideal...haha. The good news...it did warm up my kitchen. By the way, the honey dijon dip was good as well.

These pretzel bites were very good. Like the previous reviewer, I found the shaping to be very difficult. I'm not sure if I added enough flour to the dough (even though at every step, the dough did as it was supposed to), because it was very sticky. I used a lot of flour to work with it, and still had some issues, making it kind of time-consuming. I used wax paper instead of parchment, because that's all I had. A word of warning, the pretzel bites stuck to the paper while they were cooking, and I had to cut them off of the wax paper! But, even though they looked absolutely hideous (thank goodness I was only making them for myself!) they had a really good taste. I would make them again, but would either use the parchment paper or would just spray a sheet pan and cook. That way, they wouldn't stick.

I will make this again and again! I couldn't find country ham, so I used 3 oz. of finely chopped cooked bacon. I chopped the bacon in the food processor; I also pulsed the cheddar a few times after grating it, just to be sure it was fine. The only issue I had was with the shaping. I think that next time I will divide the dough into 6 or 8 pieces, roll each into a very thin snake and make 3" sticks. As it was, I cut it gnocchi-sized and they weren't as good looking as I'd have liked. I made the mustard as listed and it was a hit. People stood around the pretzel platter dipping and gobbling. The pretzels were the first app to disappear!
