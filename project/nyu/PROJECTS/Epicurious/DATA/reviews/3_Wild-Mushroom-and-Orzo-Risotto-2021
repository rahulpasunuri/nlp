The reason I like this recipe is because if you have orzo in your house, as I did, you don't actually have to buy that much more to prepare the dish. I thought it was tasty and does produce a lot of leftovers (which for me is a good thing). I wouldn't prepare it for a dinner party, but for a weekday dinner (and a few lunches to boot) I think it was totally worth it: Easy. Dried Porcinis only 2.99 here.

This was very good. Lighter than a traditional risotto but still very tasty and takes much less time to put together.

Nothing special - not worth the effort. Had a ton of leftovers - none of which got eaten.

Very tastey and easy recipe to make. If you are a mushroom lover, I would add more porcini mushrooms(maybe 1-1/2oz to 2oz rather than 1oz).

Good but expensive to use porcini mushrooms. Reheats well in microwave.

This recipe was delicious. You really have to like wild mushrooms and orzo. I think I would try this recipe again using white mushrooms to see if there was a change in taste (wild mushrooms are costly where I live) If not, then I would serve it for that really special dinner. Definately made more than 6 servings
