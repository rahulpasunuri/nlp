I made this for my brother's birthday a few years ago and people still talk about it! I'll be making it for my mom's birthday this year.

Oh my! This recipe is to die for. It's super easy. I have made it almost a dozen times because it's requested at every birthday / holiday now. I use nutter butters, reeces ice cream, and don't do the nuts around the border - I just crush up some of the remaining nutter butters and use those. YUM!

The only sentence I could make out among the various "Ooohs" and "Mmmms" and "Aaahs" from the birthday party goers was, "This should be considered a sin." The only change I made to the recipe was using peanut butter cup ice cream. I would imagine you could make variations of the cake - Oreoes instead of peanut butter sandwich cookies; mint Oreo ice cream instead of peanut butter swirl; small choc. chips instead of peanuts. Fun, easy recipe. I'll surely make it again.

This turned out to be a knock out! To make sure each component of this dessert was sufficiently frozen, I started making this early in the week, starting with the crust. I too, need a little more of the crust, so I added addtional cookies and butter and shaped to the pan. The next night, added the first round of fudge, the next night I added Breyers ice cream with peanut butter cup pieces in it. The next night, next round of fudge. The next morning sprinkled Heath bar crumbles all over the top. When I served, I drizzled warmed caramel topping over it. Absolute hit of the evening. People couldn't stop talking about how much they loved this cake...and it looks very impressive.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend, who loves peanut butter and chocolate. It was a bit messy to make but the end result was unbelievable. I would definitely make this again-great summer dessert!!!

Wow! Everyone loved this. I would take the advice of using more peanut butter cookies for the crust.

This is so delicious!!! I made homemade peanut butter swirl ice cream, that added that extra wonderful taste. And for the crust i used crunchy peanut butter sandwich cookies!! Oooh sooooo good!!

I made this dessert for a dinner with friends and our 5 children. It was a big hit and very easy to make. I did find that the top layer of hot fudge sauce INSTANTLY got "sucked" on to the plastic wrap - BEWARE!! All was not lost as I spread it back onto the pie. Great combination of peanut butter crust, ice cream, fudge and those delicious peanuts on top. A great dessert to make prior to your guests arriving and VERY kid friendly!!

This was an amazing desert. I was planning it all week, I used Nutter Butter cookies, Hershey's Hot Fudge, Turkey Hill Peanut Butter Ripple Ice Cream, and dry, unsalted roasted peanuts. Oh my god! A few pointers: The crust doesn't call for an entire full-size box of Nutter Butters, but I used it anyway, adding another 2 tablespoons of butter to the food processor. This allows you to build a higher, more stable crust. Also, the hot fudge will start to melt the ice cream when you put it on top at the end, but you can just marbelize it for a cool effect. The pie held up perfectly when released from the springform pan and everyone loved it. Make it today.

My guests all loved this pie. It should be left out about 10 minutes before serving, otherwise it's too hard to eat.
