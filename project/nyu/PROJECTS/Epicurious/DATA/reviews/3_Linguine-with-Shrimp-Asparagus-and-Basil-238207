A few changes -- used 6 more asparagus, left out jalapeno and added red pepper flakes when shrimp was cooking, as well as approx. 1/2 tsp. lemon zest & drizzled a bit of good extra virgin olive oil on finished pasta. It was fantastic with these adjustments.

I thought this was a good, simple, somewhat healthy, very easy recipe. I think it's a good example of a recipe that "you get what you put in". There wasn't much complexity, and I won't be dreaming about it for months to come, but! It really was a very nice, tasty dish that took very little time and effort to make. We added peas and sprinkled some parmesan over the top (after trying it without), and it tasted something like a twist on pasta primavera.

Was looking for something to do with a pound of shrimp and a bunch of basil. This was perfect - light, flavorful and simple. I substituted about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes for the jalapenos and it was just right.

My DH and I love this recipe and would not call it bland. We do saute the shrimp and add another garlic bud(never too much garlic or basil) before adding the liquid and have also made it with large sea scallops which are plentiful in our area. Both are excellent and never any leftovers.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. I'm so surprised at the poor ratings because it is so delicious.

Just love this recipe. Never quite prepare it exactly the same, but quite close. Can never use enough basil. My kids(18, 15) request this meal frequently there is never anything leftover.

I omitted peppers, added some fresh corn off the cob and some brocolli florets..used less basil and was glad as I think the basil at 2 cups would have overpowered. loved it!!

I really changed it up because of missing ingredients. I used chili pepper flakes for jalepanos, beef broth for white wine and lime for lemon juice. It was tasty and had a nice zing. I followed the previous suggestions of allowing shrimp to sautee before adding the liquid. Yum!

Good but nothing special. I used half the pasta and it was plenty but the sauce just didn't do much for the dish. Not a repeater.

I loved this. I used a fine pasta and fresh shrimp. My only substitution was green jalapenos.

This was very tasty. The only thing we think we'd change next time is that we'd use less basil. We only had one cup this time and it seemed too much. We did enjoy some parmesan cheese with it, and the jalos gave it just a nice, gentle hint of heat. And as always, we doubled the shrimp. Might try giant, tiger prawn next time, too. A solid recipe, and a keeper!

The 'herbsman from Morgan' was on to something in that the recipe may not have presented the best order of preparation. If you saute the shrimp and blanch the asparagus in the oil & spices prior to combining everything, the flavors seem to be better blended, and the dish is less oily. We did reduce the butter and basil, and used red pepper flakes instead of jalapeno. Plus, I took a hint from Emeril and 'kicked it up a notch' with a touch of cayenne. The result wasn't bland at all, and seemed to allow the subtlties of the flavors to blend without overpowering them.

I have made this several times and I was surprised that other reviewers thought this recipe was bland. I thought it was very tasty and I do not like bland food. Just before serving I stirred an extra 1 Tbsp of butter, which gave the sauce a slightly richer and thicker consistency. Now that aspargus is out of season, I'm looking for a good substitute.

Excellent recipe, with some variation listed below.

After reading some of the reviews here, I made a quick marinade out of the sauce ingredients (wine, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, jalapeno) and let the shrimp soak up some flavor while the pasta water was boiling. Overall, this was pretty good, but in the future I think I'll skip the jalapeno and just use crushed red pepper flakes -- I'm just not sure if the flavor of the peppers really added anything. So nothing too special, but I'd make it again on a weeknight.

I thought this recipe was completely bland, the technique that involves essentially poaching the shrimp and asparagus did little to impart any garlic, lemon, or any other kind of flavor from the poaching liquid to the shrimp or asparagus, the pasta was even more bland as this recipe produced not enough sauce to dress the requsite amount of pasta. In the future, you could use this same ingredient list by searing the shrimp, deglazing with the wine, then blanching the asparagus, continue to reduce the wine, add shrimp back in, then finish with a garlic herb butter, lemon, toss with drained pasta...that's what I'll do with these same ingredients in the future...

I loved this receipe! I actually added some chicken (and broccoli) since I'm not a huge shrimp fan. You could probably add any type of vegetables you had in your fridge! The white wine, butter, lemon, garlic base can make anything taste wonderful! I will say however that the broccoli really locked in those juices.

I agree that this dish was quick and easy, but it just wasn't very good. I used many of the suggestions by previous reviewers, but in the end it was still blah. There are many wonderful recipes on this site, this is not one of them.

I made this meal for my boyfriend and sister. I could not find a red jalapeno so I used a green and added red pepper for added color. I also added more garlic and parmesean cheese. This was a very simple and delicious meal. I will definately be making this meal again.

Wonderful recipe. We loved everything about it. I've made it a couple of times now and it always turns out perfect. I served an Argentina wine with it. Try Tittarelli Torrontes 2006. They were made for each other !

Great way to use up heaps of basil, nice kick and good flavors for shrimp. I recommend reducing the oil and/or butter, though - I followed the recipe and it came out a wee bit slimy. One note: I used canned jalapenos (again, using them up). Because of the acid in the chiles (I presume), the garlic turned blue-ish. This can happen if you mix lemon or wine with just garlic, too - oil helps coat the garlic. Taste is ok but smurfy garlic freaks guests out.

Fabulous gourmet recipe! I don't know how anyone can say it's bland. Of course if you would be concerned about that, kick up the garlic, lemon and jalapeno to your liking. I had the butcher cut the heads off fresh gulf shrimp and he deveined and peeled them for me as well. I am in Florida this week and know I would not find the quality shrimp in Nebraska to prepare this meal... An great meal to impress guests with.

This was a great and easy meal to put together. I used fresh pasta and could not find a red jalapeno so I used a green one. The lemon really kicks up the flavor. Will definitely make this dish again.

This was pretty good, though next time I think I would do things a bit differently. The caveat here is that I didn't follow the recipe exactly: I don't drink, so I used 1/2 a cup of chicken broth in place of the wine. (It worked just fine!) I omitted the jalapeno because I just wasn't feeling up for spice the night I made it. (I might throw it in there next time just for kicks.) I tasted the sauce before adding the pasta to it and thought it was really yummy - but once the pasta was tossed in the flavor of the sauce just didn't come through. Next time I'll probably make double amount of sauce.

This was the most boring recipe I have made in a long,long time. I took the time to cut it out and put in my binder, only to make it and throw out the recipe. Could have used saffron, chicken stock any thing to give it a punch. Oh well

Excellent dish, I've made it already three times and has been a great success, the garlic and jalapeno give a great taste to the shrimp. Don't change anything on this recipe, it's perfect.

Good quick recipe. I added quite a bit more garlic, and 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes which gave it a little kick. I thought the amount of basil was a little much (and I love basil!). You could also add spinach to this recipe. Added some grated parmesan on top and it was delicious!

Easy to make, delicious light spring dish! Made a simple salad of mixed spring greens with dried cranberries, toasted pecans, pear and granny smith apple, dressed with citrus infused olive oil. Served with a Frank Family Chardonnay and sat on the patio with spring flowers everywhere in the yard on a balmy evening. Increased the garlic and the shrimp, otherwise, not much tweaking needed to be done! A definite make again recipe!!
