My husband and I love this recipe and have made this four times already. The buttermilk is a perfect ingredient to use instead of milk or sour cream. One minute before adding the caramelized shallots onto the mashed potatoes, we added minced garlic cloves and cooked them for a minute. That gives a little kick to the taste, thanks for sharing this recipe with us!

This is the second time I've made this recipe. The first, I followed the directions and loved it. This time I didn't have any butter milk, and improvised by using fat free Greek yogurt plus skim milk. Really good as a substitute.

Wonderful! Of course I added some garlic when the shallots were almost done, but otherwise I followed the recipe.

This dish paired wonderfully with the Herb-crusted Rack of Lamb (on this site). I made it for our anniversary, and served it with sugar snap peas sauteed in a bit of butter and lots of garlic. Delish!

This is a great mashed potato recipe, I just love yukon gold potatoes. I love my potatoes creamy so I added butter to them and extra buttermilk and it was very tasty. Even my husband loved them, this recipe is worth holding on to.

This recipe is delicious, but it makes exactly two servings.

The shallots and buttermilk added a nice zing.

These potatoes were fabulous. When I poured out my buttermilk, I realized I was short, so I added regular milk and a tablespoon of sour cream for extra flavor. My one quibble is the quantity - 12 oz of potatoes for 4 adults? I tripled the recipe, and only a small amount was left over! They were very good.

Very decadent. I'd mix them with an electric mixer, though, instead of mashing them in the pan. That would give them a little extra fluff.

These spuds are fabulous. Its' always nice to find a recipe to use up that buttermilk and large bag of shallots in one fell swoop. 16 oz. of red potatoes worked for me with the other ingredients.

Delicious! Used plain old spuds and extra buttermilk, but the shallots were fabulous.

Fabulous. All my guests, and my husband, went for seconds - it's a good thing I made plenty. It was so good, I dreamed about it that night, smelled it in my sleep, and had it warmed over for breakfast. I did use the remainder - about 1/2 cup - of light cream I had sitting in the fridge in addition to the buttermilk, just to make it creamier, but I'm sure more buttermilk would have been just as good. Do rice the potatoes. And be sure to cook the shallots until they are golden brown and caramelized.

We served this recipe with a Beef Prime Rib Roast for Christmas dinner and it was outstanding. I did take other's advice and increased the shallots and used a mixture of buttermilk and Half-and-Half. I used russets, not Yukon Gold potatoes.

Made this dish yesterday for Thanksgiving. It was a knockout. Yes, plain ol' mashed potatoes were a knockout. They were absoultely THE creamiest mashed potatoes ever. Don't change a thing.

Delicious! I added an extra shallot and instead of all buttermilk, I used 1/2 regular milk. I also added extra butter while I was mashing. Great side dish for bbq steaks, etc. You can't go wrong with mashed potatoes!!!

This recipe has become a staple in our house. We always use the Yukon Gold potatos and we have not been disappointed. I like to put in just a little extra shallot and I mix in a little milk with the buttermilk to make the dish creamier. I have served this to many guests with nothing but compliments. Give it a try.

I can't believe the negative reviews? I love Yukon Gold but had I not had them on hand I would have used russets - I can't tell a lot of difference?.... I doubled the shallot and did saute them unitl they were deep golden (& crispy), my husband & I thought they were great and of course they were easy.

Well, I used russets instead of the yukon golds. For the shallots, I put a little sugar in with the butter. And when mashing I used extra butter and lots of white pepper and salt. This was amazing, the combo of the shallots, buttermilk and the potatoes, was truly a taste sensation. Easy too!

Yukon gold potatoes is the current fad, and neither my family nor I care for them. I agree with San Diego, go for the good ol' spuds.

I made this recipe because I had some buttermilk to use up. Its pretty good, but I prefer richer mashed potatoes. If you want to cut back on fat and calories but still have decent mashed potatoes, this is a good way to do it, because the shallots gave it an extra boost of flavor.

I was hesitant to make this because of the other reviewers' comments, but it was really good. I don't like Yukon Gold potatoes, so I used regular russets. The recipe is definitely a keeper.

I must admit I haven't tried the recipe, but the only time I tried yukon gold potatoes, I found them too sweet and not "potato-y" enough for this Irish lass. Don't rush the step with the shallots, and use good old spuds1

This is a very good accompaniment to a spicy pork tenderloin or similar meat; however, I would probably opt for Joe's Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes (also found on Epicurious)next time.

We served this with grilled pork tenderloin and marinated asparagus, and it was excellent. I used some extra butter in cooking the shallots, and more buttermilk than called for to get the consistency we liked. We will definitely prepare again.

Can honestly say the only time I would make this dish again is when I run out of Lite Milk and I have buttermilk in the fridge, otherwise I would not bother with this one

The potatoes were a little bland, I dressed it up with some roasted garlic but it still was so,so

Rating: 1
I agree -- these are bland! I was so excited about them, but they weren't very good. They need lots of butter. There are much better mashed potato recipies out there!

Why does the title of the recipe say "Carmalized Shallots?" The method of preperation does not carmalize the shallots.

This turned out bland, bland, bland! A little ketchup on McDonald's fries is a more inventive potato recipe. Don't bother with this one.

Yummy. Will definitely make these again.

Great easy recipe! I have made it three times already, and it is so quick. The shallots really are key. I have substitued skim milk for the buttermilk adding another tablespoon or two of butter, and it turned out fine.

Shallots cooked in butter give this dish a wonderful taste that everyone loved, but could not guess. This is one of the best mashed potatoes recipies I have tried - a sure staple at my table.
