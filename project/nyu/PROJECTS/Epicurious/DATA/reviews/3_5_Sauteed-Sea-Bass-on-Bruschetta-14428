We were disappointed with this receipe, after reading the great reviews. I think the big problem was the canned tomatoes -- I used DelMonte fresh cut and they still tasted processed. Follow other readers' recommendations and use fresh tomatoes.

I left out the bread (intentionally) and coriander(accidentally) for this recipe. I usually bag on the people that don't follow the recipe's as written, but I guess that just means I'm getting a little more confident in making unique adjustments. SUCH AS...I used a mixture of canned and fresh red vine tomatoes. I used fresh filet of sole. Also instead of flouring and cooking the fish in a skillet, I baked it. I greased a dish, put in the filets, put a little salt and pepper and poured a little melted butter over the filet. I then topped the fish with the entire tomato mixture(reserving the liquid from earlier) I baked it at 450 degrees for "around" 15 minutes. I followed the rest of the recipe for the sauce and orange juice and put it over the fish. It was delicious. I also roasted some sliced zuchini with the remaining chopped shallots, olive oil, white wine, white wine vinegar, and salt and pepper. Yummy.

What a disappointment. With all of the 4 fork reviews I thought this would be a winner. However, this recipe was so bland. I wasted 8 pieces of beautiful sea bass. Bruschetta should be saved for appetizers!

Delicious! This is good even without the bread. I've served it with mashed potatoes, couscous, or rice, depending on the season and on my mood.

This turned out fantastic! I used fresh tomatos (seeded and peeled) in place of the canned. I had quite a bit too much tomato mixture for the bruschetta, so i threw the extra into the 'sauce'. Served this with roasted butternut squash w/balsamic vinegar and broccoli rabe w/garlic & romano cheese... it was a beautiful, colourful presentation (and totally delicious).

For a very cold winter night, I substituted mashed potato for the bread. I browned the potato, and treated it just as you would the bread. It was piping hot and filling and delicious!

I love this recipe! I added some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit, but it's wonderful as is! Make sure you put the tomato mixture on the toasted bread JUST before serving, to prevent any sogginess.

Simply delicious. When time is scarce, it can be put together using store-bought bruschetta with excellent results.
