I knew what I was getting with this dish. It was just the right side for the meal and I was happy to have leftovers. I enjoyed the rough mash of the potatos and my beans had a perfect snap to them.

This was great. I think a really good quality extra virgin olive oil is key because the oil is the dominant flavor - actually, an infused oil might be good. Next time. I also added shaved pecorino on top when I put it on the plate. Yum!

Making this for the third time tonight. The ingredients are simple and uncomplicated. But together they make a very nice, subtle, and flavorful dish. Paired well with rustic grilled veggies and grilled meats.

Bland & extremely boring. I had to add a lot of seasoning. Sorry, but maybe she should not publish her grandmother's recipes.

Very bland and boring. I made this as the directions indicate and ended up adding a lot of salt and Italian seasoning to increase the flavor level. IF I made it again, I would use butter instead of olive oil, would definitely add some nice flavorful cheese like parmeggiano-reggiano, and maybe some fresh crushed rosemary, but I probably won't bother making it again.

Yum! I just made this for lunch and it was delicious. It's easy to make, is healthy, and tastes great. I'll be making this again.

This made a great side dish and used simple ingredients. It had good flavor and my family loved it. The prep time was quick. I will make this again!

This recipe was really surprisingly delicious. I expected it to be bland, so I had vinegar on hand just in case. However, it didn't need it! My only changes were subbing shallots for garlic, and adding some sea salt.

This recipes sounds so "blah" -- i.e., just beans and potatoes -- but it's really quite good. Maybe it's the olive oil, the touch of garlic and the Yukon Gold potatoes that makes it special.

This cracks me up... I accdientally made this recipe (with some modifications) the other week while trying to empty out leftover ingredients from the fridge before we left for vacation. The differences are that we had the following on hand, which made this basic recipe a lot more interesting: 1 shallot 2-3 tbsp balsamic vinegar 2-3 tbsp rice wine vinegar sea salt and ground pepper, to taste fresh herbs, such as thyme, basil, dill, parsley -- whatever you have on hand, finely chopped. Cook as in the recipe, toss with the additional ingredients. Serve hot or cold -- it's great either way.

Really like these ingredients this way. I didn't peel the yucon golds, and I used butter instead of olive oil. It's a southern thing. They were delicious, Served with the Fish Fillets Dijon from this site. They complimented each other really well. I'll make again.

This is easy and far more tasty than one might imagine from the simple ingredients. In fact, in my case they were even simpler because I forgot the garlic - still so good! Also I had to use regular olive oil - still great. It will be one of my staples (and with the proper ingredients).
