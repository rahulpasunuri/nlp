Made these again, and made the sauce this time... amazingly good! My husband says this is the BEST marinara sauce. Be sure to weigh the mushrooms to make sure you have the correct amount. We plan to serve this at a dinner party soon! YUM!!!

I substituted tofu for ricotta, threw in a couple of extra mushrooms and used dried basil instead of fresh. I made the sauce as called for but wasn't enchanted, so I added a bay leaf at the end. Given the changes I made, I'm not sure how closely my finished product resembles the original recipe, but it was a delicious meal nonetheless. Next time I come across ricotta, I'll give it another try.

These were interesting. I didn't have quite enough shiitakes, so I added some chopped walnuts -- those added a nice crunch. Great as a side to pasta.

I guess it was easy, but very messy! I might try letting the mushrooms cool in a strainer next time. Anyhow, my boyfriend (who was less than enthused when I told him what I was making) loved it.

This is an easy and delicious recipe. Instead of small patties I made 3 large with this recipe. The tomato basil sauce is amazing with fresh tomatoes from the garden. Enjoy

A little more work than I expected from a "Quick Kitchen" recipe, but worth the effort. Just delicious, and mellow enough for a nice red wine.

I made this for my wonderful vegetarian boyfriend, when we had only been dating for a few months. Even thought I am not a strict vegetarian, I find that I am a 'de facto' one now... but with recipes like this one, I don't mind a bit! I made the patties, lightly flouring them, wrapped them individually in plastic wrap and froze them (I did not bother with the topping portion of this recipe). While they were still frozen, I fried them in butter and served them up on keiser buns with mayo, dijon mustard, and alfalfa sprouts... they were a HUUUUGE hit! They are now on our list of "regulars"... and although they do require a bit of prep work, they are definitely worth the effort!

Delicious. Can be made ahead of time if having guests. Just reheat sauce and zap the patties in microwave a couple seconds on the plate to be served on. The recipe itself does not produce the volume noted. I only produced 5 patties 3 inches diameter. Was served as an appetizer. Guests loved it and thought it unusual.

These were wonderful tasting, although the presentation was lacking. The dough was extremely wet and difficult to mold, so beware of too much ricotta and get all the moisture out of the mushroom mixture.
