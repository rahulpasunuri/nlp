Wonderfully easy pie. It's a little heavy on the citrus by itself, but is tamed down perfectly with vanilla ice cream.

I enjoyed the flavors in this very easy pie, but found the texture of the filling too 'gummy' from the flour. This may have been my own doing; I think there was more of the natural fruit juices in the 2nd pie (which I've given away!) I would be very interested in trying this again, being more careful to divide the fruit and juices more evenly, and using my own pie crust recipe.

Good, very easy recipe ... all seemed to like it. I used fresh organic rhubarb and fresh raspberries, not frozen. Next time I would reduce the amount of orange zest, maybe just one orange instead of two, I thought the orange flavour a bit too prominent. Nice blend of sweet and tart between the pears, raspberries and rhubarb.

I loved this recipe and you get two pies to boot! I agree with all of the other reviewers that you don't need to know how to bake a pie to make this and make it well! I brought it to work and it was a hit! I only tweaked one thing, 'cuz I'm lazy: Instead of zesting two oranges, I put 2-3 tbsps. high quality orange marmalade in the pie and it gave it just the right hint of citrus. I melted the marmalade in the microwave for 30 secs. in a little pyrex bowl with no special tricks, then poured the melted jam over the mixture and combined! Really, folks, recipe is a keeper. Even the rhubarb hating crowd liked it, they just picked out the rhubarb pieces. Oh, lastly, I used all frozen fruit except for the pears and it turned out perfectly fine.

I have never been very good at making pies...until this one. It was perfect. I did use a little more sugar than called for. I will definately make this pie again.

Yummy, but should have used the required amount of sugar. I used sweetened raspberries and half a cup less sugar than the recipe called for, due to other reviews saying that the recipe was too sweet, but the pie ended up being not sweet enough! Was still very good and would make it again...

I still can't believe how easy this recipe is to make. I made it for a last minute dinner party and it was a big hit. A keeper!

This recipe is just fantastic! There are never any leftovers (and I always have to bring copies of the recipe to give out) This is a pie that I will ALWAYS make.

I am usually HORRIBLE with pies, and this was a snap! It was delicious and passed the "mom" test. I would cut the sugar just a little the next time, and use a few pears (maybe half) that are not quite as ripe to add a little more texture.

Wonderful rescipe!!!! I made this for a shower. Hit was a hit!!! This was my first experience with rhubarb pie and I thought this was delicious, so did everyone at the shower. This was actually the first pie I had ever baked and it turned out beautiful. I will definitely make this again.

Deee-licious. I did think it was a little too sugary; next time I'll probably cut the sugar and add a little bit of ginger. Overall this was an easy dessert, and everyone who ate it liked it.

It was delicious! We used homemade crust and canned pears. You can really can taste the cinnamon. The pears really offset the more tart taste of the rhubarb and raspberries. Not too sweet and not too tart.
