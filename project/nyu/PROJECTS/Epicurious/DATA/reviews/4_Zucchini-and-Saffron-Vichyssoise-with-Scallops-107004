PS -- it's better room temperature or a little warm, and drizzle some truffle oil over it to really bring the recipe over the top!

Spectacular taste and presentation. I didn't have a mandolin so cut the julienne strips by hand. One time saving tip: julienne the outer part of only about half of the zucchini, that's all you'll need. With the rest, just peel and discard.

Good, not superb. Made it exactly as stated. Would have preferred a slightly more pronounced saffron flavor. However it was very pretty.

This soup was really outstanding. Not only did it taste fantastic, but it looked absolutely gorgeous too. I didn't find this to be very time consuming. The only thing that really took up a lot of time was preparing the zucchini garnish because I don't have the tool for it - but even so, it wasn't too long. If I were to make it again, I probably wouldn't even bother with the zucchini garnish. My boyfriend said this was one of the best soups he'd ever tasted. I'd definitely make this again.

Fantastic soup. No possibility of acquiring scallops in Budapest, but the soup stands on its own. Really delicious.

I just had to sign into epicurious to say how *wonderful* this recipe is. As previous reviewers have said, it provides a complex yet subtle, unique combination of flavors. I served the soup to a friend at his house and all he seemed to want to know is whether I'd leave him the leftovers :-) Being the kind of cook who glances over a recipe's ingredients and does her own thing, I added a pair of leeks to the sauté. And I used fish stock instead of chicken. Maybe one day I'll follow the recipe à la lettre. Meanwhile, what a source of inspiration.

maybe cold soup is not for me... however, this was time consuming for a very disapointing result. the only thing i liked were the scallops

The soup is excellent warm or cold. We brushed he scallops with truffled honey and they were over the top.

This soup is amazing! Served it to unwilling veggie eaters of all ages and they all loved it. I used red potatoes b/c i had them in and the texture of this soup was like velvet. Don't need the zucchini garnish, just beautiful fresh scallops.

This is divine! I prepared it exactly from the recipe, and would willingly serve both hot or cold. A show stopper!

This was a great recipe for entertaining since most of it can be made the night before. It was very good!!

I've made this three or four times to rave reviews every time. Very subtle, complex flavors. I use some extra seared scallops. They really enhances the dish.

I was going to half the recipe, so i started out with half the ingredients... then somewhere along the line I forgot about reducing the amounts, so used the original amount for the second part of the ingredient list...still, it turned out great: velvety, smooth, very flavourful. Frankly, I never quite understood why Vichyssoise is meant to be served cold -I think it would be make a lovely warm soup as well.

This soup was delicious!!!! I substituted the scallops for shrimp (just because I didn't have scallops on hand), added a touch of cayenne pepper and had it hot instead of cold.

This combination of flavors--zucchini, scallops, saffron--is really outstanding, subtle, nutty and sweet. This is a simple dish with an elegant presentation and sophicated flavors.

This was really outstanding. The texture was perfect. I was a bit skeptical at first as there were no other reviews, but decided to give it a go. The saffron put me off at first, it smelled a bit strong, but it was just right in the finished dish, and of course, gave it a lovely color. The zucchini "spaghetti" and scallops added visual interest and a little sweetness. The bottom line is, there were no leftovers, and every bowl came back empty!
