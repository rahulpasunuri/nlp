The recipe worked out perfectly but gooseberries were not completely to my taste, a little tart. It may be that they were not perfectly ripe when we bought them. I found it definitely needed ice cream or maybe mixed with another berry.

Good recipe. Don't spoil the unique zippy taste of gooseberries by adding other fruit. Gooseberries are a fantastic under rated berry.

Wonderful pie, I've also added strawberries and rhubarb to it the last time I made it and it was even better.

I used my tried and true crust recipe from Joy of Cooking, and a combination of blueberries and gooseberries. It was delicious, everyone at the party loved it. I think that next time I may experiment with spices, maybe some cinnamon or allspice.

Just as goosebery pie should be! I also made it for the 4th of July and used one of my favorite pie crust recipes. Instead of pastry strips I cut stars for the top. Definitely need to protect the edges from burning during the second half of baking. Serve it warm with a little heavy cream poured on top to cut the edge of tartness just a bit and it's fantastic.

I made this for 4th of July and it was fabulous...nice and tart. I did not, however, use the pie crust recipe listed here...I highly recommend the "Easy Pie Crust" recipe on this site...the best (and easiest-to-make) pie crust I've found.
