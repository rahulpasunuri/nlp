Since I'm thai I'll say Sawat-dee-ka. (Sabai dee is I'm fine in thai btw) Since this wasn't the history of where the origin of this recipe came from and who knows what, I'll say this is a very simple recipe that is great to have around. For anyone else interested with the sweet rice with mangoes, its called "Kao-neau Mamuang" as pp stated. Khap Kuhn Ka

Love, love, love sticky rice! Served it with thai grilled chicken (gai yang) and 3 different dipping sauces. My guests who had never tasted thai food before raved. Also the long beans with eggplant and cherry tomatoes and thai cucumber salad with peanuts recipe on this site. Mango and coconut sorbet for dessert. Everyone had happy faces! (even the kids!)

I have eaten sticky rice my whole life; the same with my all my relatives and asian friends. This recipe is very good, but the absolute best sticky rice is the sweet rice from Koda Farms. They have been around for years and consistently have had the best rice!

Mmmmmm Kao Niow Ma-muang, with the coconut milk in the desert where it belongs. 1 Can (14 oz)Coconut milk, with 1/2 cu sugar, 1 tsp salt boiled steep about 2 Pandanus leaves (bai dteuy) OR some drops of jasmine essence. remove leaves mix into cooked rice, and serve with mangos. Like the cook from NYC says. Shan Shob

actually, the new york city cook is incorrect. having spent just under 3 years in thailand, the phrase is sa-wa-dee. and this rice is very good. make with mango and enjoy

The phrase is sa-bay-dee not sa-wa-dee. Sticky rice is Lao not Thai. As for the recipe, it omits the important step of washing the rice. You need to wash it for about five minutes (as you would for any rice), until the water is almost clear, before leaving it to soak. I agree with Janey that if you're goig to be making this more than once to get the Lao steamer pot and basket or 'houat' (won't cost much more than $10) at Lao, Thai, Vietnamese, etc. stores. It's worth it. You should also get a good lidded rice basket, or 'katip khao,' for serving. Unfortunately, most the ones sold in grocery stores in the states are really shoddy. Your best bet is to find a Lao store because they will have the highest standard for the product. Don't forget to flip the rice by flicking the basket about halfway through (after about 15 minutes--cook for another 10). After cooking, immediately turn it out onto a wet cutting board and 'fluff' it. This rapidly cools it down, stops the cooking and ensures a nice glossy 'el dente' finish. Turn it into 'ka tip khao' and serve. If you don't have 'ka tip khao,' you're in trouble because the rice will 'sweat.' That may make the rice soggy and your fingers sticky. I would hate to eat sticky rice without a rice basket. Enjoy!

I've made this recipe seveal times originally after buying this at the farmer's market in my town. A great simple addition is a sauce made of salt, sugar and coconut milk and served with sliced mangoes. It has become a favorite of all my dinner guests!

My friends and I have made sticky rice a regular tradition at gatherings. It's definately worth all of the work! Eat it with your fingers, like they do in Laos, and dip it in this Sauce: Soy Sauce, crushed garlic, crushed ginger (fresh ginger root is best. You can get in the produce section at your grocery store), and red pepper flakes(all to taste). It's wonderful!! The kids love it too! You can get the steamer basket (called a "Huat")and the aluminum pot to go under it at any oriental market, CHEAP! Make sure you soak the Huat overnight before first use, or your rice will taste like bamboo.
