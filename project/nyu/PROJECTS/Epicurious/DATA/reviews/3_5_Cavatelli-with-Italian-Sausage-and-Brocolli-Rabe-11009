Yummy. Didn't have chicken broth so I used 1/2 chardonnay, 1/2 water. Used broccolini and penne. Added some red pepper flakes. Didn't bother adding butter.

Quick and easy. I followed earlier suggestions and added some sauteed onion and some white beans. I cheated and thickened the sauce a bit at the very end using a table spoon of cornstarch. Also substituted Broccolini. Everyone, including the teenagers were having seconds. Will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

This is so easy and so yummy. I followed the suggestion to add cannellini beans, and skipped the pasta completely. The greens are easier to clean and cook than others I've worked with. A very easy and tasty dish.

This meal was delicious!! I am non-dairy and don't eat pork, so I sustituted chicken sausage and soy butter. The sausage wasn't as fatty as pork sausage so I had to use more butter but it still turned out delish.

Also great if you add a can of small white beans and cook till it becomes creamy. Pasta e fagiole!

Excellent dish. I substituted dark raisins for the golden and added a can of cannellini beans, some of which I mashed with the back of a large spoon, to make a creamier sauce.

Very very quick and easy to prepare, and tastes quite good. I agree with other reviewers that there is plenty of room for experimentation. The yield is listed as 2 servings, but I think you can easily get 4+.

Perfection! Doubled all ingredients except the chicken broth and added a little reserved pasta water. Sauteed the sausage with garlic. Added red pepper flakes and about 3/4 cup diced onions to the brocolli rabe & raisin mixture and tossed in some halved grape tomatoes towards the end of cooking. Made for a very happy meal,

We love this recipe! The combination of slightly bitter rabe, sweet raisins and juicy sausage really works well. We keep coming back to this one.

This was really good. I am not a raisin fan but I have to say they were a nice compliment to the broccoli rabe. I would definitely do this again.

I made this only I swapped out the Broccoli Rabe with broccoli and skipped the raisins. It was a total hit in my house and we plan on making it regularly now.

It was incredibly bitter! I followed the recipe to a T but I think it would be best to half the rabe amount.

What a surprise! Doubled the recipe for 3/4 lbs pasta. Key is to use good quality ingredients. I used 1/2 sweet 1/2 spicy Italian sausage. Can't believe how easy, yet so tasty, this turned out. Never would have guessed.

Very nice basic pasta for nights when you don't want to put a lot of effort into cooking. Do include the raisins. They'll seem strange, but every forkful of rabe is best with a raisin, the sweetness compliments the rabe perfectly. Definitely grate good quality Parmesan on top. Lots of room for experimentation, but the recipe is good as is.

Very nice dish for a cool spring evening. You can find pre-prepped rabe now in the salad section of the market. It cooks down quite a bit so don't hesitate to use the full bag.

Best version of this dish I have tried.Best of all comments: Saute 3 crushed garlic cloves in 2T olive oil before adding sausage.Suggest using 2:1 sweet/hot sausage. Drop raisins in broth to soften while cooking. Easier not to remove sausage before adding rabe-no ill effects.Add 1/4 t hot pepper flakes.Dump drained pasta into saucepan w/sausage&rabe and stir in half of parmesan before serving.

I make too many changes to this recipe to give it more than two stars. Nonetheless, it's my "base" recipe for what I call "Rustic Style Pasta." You can't go wrong with some, none, or all of the below changes: Forget about the raisens and the butter, add 1/4 tsp (or more) of red pepper flakes; add sauteed onions, substitute brocolli for the brocolli rabe, add canelloni beans, deglaze pan with 1/2 c of wine. So easy. No way to make a bad dish. This is a keeper. And my Sicilian 82 year old dad always asks for it!

I made a few changes and it was SCRUMPTIOUS, my hubby said it rates with the best pasta he's every had!! I was leary of the raisins but I'd never make it again without them. I used sweet italian fennel sausage and added some additional fennel seeds, aprox 1/2 tsp. Tripled the chili flakes. Sauted the sausage in 2 TBSP XV olive oil and skipped the butter. Upped the garlic to 3 cloves. Blanched the rapini (brocolli rabe) for 1 min in advance (in strong chicken broth with sugar and salt added). Reserved 1 cup of the liquid and used for the sauce. Added the rapini back in at the end with the pasta. OMG - it was GOOD! This is going into the regular rotation.

This was good, but nothing wonderful. I agree with the other reviewer who said "good way to get those green leafy greens". Good enough for a weekday night dinner, no guests.

I wish I could give 2 1/2 forks. The dish was definitely tasty, but it didn't knock my socks off. That being said, it's a great way to get those dark leafy greens into the diet and who can complain about the ease of preparation? I would like to try with golden raisins...I only had dark raisins in the pantry. We had left over sauce (which I kept separately, so that the pasta wouldn't soak up the juices). I found that it did taste better the next day. One surprise for me is that my 20 month old loved it, even the rabe.

This was an instant classic at my house. Agree that the raisins shouldn't be skipped, and may even be increased.

This is a nice, stick-to-your-ribs, quick dinner. Although the servings seem a little off. I only had one bunch of rabe and two sausages and the dish made two VERY hearty servings with some for leftovers. I sliced the sausage in the casing and used Hot instead of mild to add a little kick!

This is an excellent pasta dish. The brocolli rabe is a little bitter, but somewhat offset by the raisins. I liked it this way. However, if you'd like to lessen the bitterness, boil the brocolli rabe for about 5 minutes in 3 cups of water with 1TBL salt and 2 TBLS sugar. I also added 2 TBLS of butter to the sausage when browning, and replaced the Parmesan with Romano cheese. I wonder how this would taste with olive oil versus chicken broth?

I love this recipe. I make exactly as written except use three cloves of garlic and turkey sausage. It isn't my husband's favorite - but he snubs any pasta recipe that doesn't include tomatoes!

This recipe comes under the 'don't need to change a thing' category!! Wonderful made ahead and great the next day. A total keeper. Love the slight bitterness of the rabe with the sweetness of the raisins.

Great recipe. I didn't have rabe so I substituted organic spinach (although swiss chard is wonderful in this recipe) and toasted pine nuts; omitted the chicken broth. I did make a marinara sauce to serve on the side.......at great dish and a great recipe to have on hand for unexpected company....do not leave out the raisins or you miss the whole taste experience. I also grated some fresh parmesan for serving

This was so good and so easy to make. I used a bow-tie pasta I had on hand, as well as regular old raisins and it was just wonderful. I also used spicy italian sausage and the family loved the spicy/sweet combo.

Fabulous. Simple, yet complex in its flavor. The bitterness of the broccoli rabe is offset by the pasta. I skipped the raisons, but I imagine those would further enhance the flavor - I'm just not a fan of mixing sweet and savory.

added extra garlic...definately needed...he was surprised at how much he liked it.

A much simpler version if you don't have raisins was told to me by my Italian butcher: Turkey Italian sausage squeezed from casings fry in olive oil. Break up pieces. Before you stir, rinse brocolli rabe, coarsley chop lay ontop of the sausage and let it steam for about 3 minutes (water from washing adds the steam. Then stir altogether and finish cooking. Serve w/ lots of parmesan and try penne pasta. Famuliy favorite. Kids request it for birthday dinners. Leftovers are rare but good.

I made this with leftover smoked duck rather than sausauge, but thought the duck would also be good with the sweetness of the raisins. It was fantastic the first night, though a little dry the second night (the pasta had absorbed most of the liquid by then). Still, though, delicious, and one could add a little olive oil on night 2.

This was delicious! My first experience with broccoli raab and I loved it. The raisins and lots of garlic are key. This was really good with a bottle of Spanish grenache. I fed 3 and all had seconds.

Wow! I make cavatelli and broccoli rabe all the time but the taste of the fennel in the sausage and the raisins is amazing! Added extra garlic and pre-steamed the broccoli rabe a little since i usually find it tough. Delicious!

great classic tastes. raisans supprisingly are the star, but of course brocolli rabe, sausage, and good pasta is a can't miss. easy to he-reat extras too with all the chicken broth in it.

Pure and simple, this is wonderful, if you like broccoli rabe. One of our favorite quick pasta dishes. I generally double the garlic, do that in about every recipe. I used orrechiette instead of cavatelli. Especially like the firmer kinds, such as Alessi. More expensive, but worth it.

Since it first appeared in the magazine, I've been making this when I can find good broccoli rabe at a good price. My family loves it. I usually make it exactly as is, sometimes using olive oil instead of butter, or substituting black raisins when I don't have golden. Always a hit.

WHEN I MAKE THIS RECIPE, I DON'T USE THE RAISINS AND CUT THE SAUSAGES INTO TINY LITTLE PIECES. I ADD LOTS OF GARLIC, CHICKEN BROTH AND FRESH LEMON AND SERVE IT OVER SPAGHETTI. MY FAMILY ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT.

I make this recipe all the time and love it! I omit the raisins from the recipe and add chopped tomatoes and oregano. I also increase the cooking time which allows for the tomatoes to break down a bit but not too long that the broccoli rabe softens. This is a keeper!

My husband loved it, I thought it was so so ( but I loved the raisins). I will give it a try again. It was a little bit dry, so I would use more broth.

This recipe was sooo easy! Although, I did happen to have the broccoli rabe on hand and I was looking for what I could do with it. I just happened to have the sausage in the freezer. I didn't have cavatelli, so I used rotini. It was absolutely delicious and my family loved it! The only other alterations I made were that I didn't have golden raisins, but regular and my husband tends to prefer a little more garlic. I would definitely recommend this and I plan on making this alot more often. I think it would be a great one-meal dish for the summer.
