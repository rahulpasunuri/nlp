I made this recipe for two and we really enjoyed it. I added a bit of minced onion, chopped thyme and bread crumbs over the fish. I also cooked mine for 20 minutes at 350- degrees. It's good looking, tasty and easy to clean up. Served with new potatoes.

This is the lamest Bon Appeit recipe ever!~ Get real! It is breaded fish and lettuce! My father in law could do better and he doesn't even know where the kitchen is!

This was an easy and lovely weeknight meal. As others have said; very moist! I used spinach instead of Arugula too just because I'm not very keen on arugula. Added some thin slices of lemon on top of the fish too.

I substituted fresh sole for the roughy since it was on special at the market and the roughy was pre-frozen. Also used a fig balsamic vinegar. Otherwise followed the recipe. The aromas in the kitchen were wonderful, but the end product was edible but not great. I'll just to stick to julienned veggies in my next papillote.

This is a very nice way to cook orange roughy -- I need to cook for nearly 25 minutes, maybe because the filets were thick. I added feta, which was delicious. Sauteed the garlic as suggested by other reviewers -- good tip.

Thanks to all the people who reviewed this recipe. I used several of your suggestions and it was very good. I used spinach as I didn't have any arugula. I also sauteed the garlic in a little olive oil and added that. Directly on top of the fish I put a cap full of lemon juice and added salt, pepper and thyme. I also added some dried minced garlic. I used canned diced tomatoes. It was perfectly cooked and very moist after 15 minutes. I served this with boiled new potates with butter and fresh dill. It was a nice combination.

A very tasty dish. I used Tilapia as others suggested, and found it suited the recipe well. However, the cooking time needed to be increased a few minutes for the fish to be tender and flaky. This was a fairly simple recipe that is fast becoming one of our favorites.

I also used spinach for this recipe. It is a favorite at our house now. So simple and quick to make with such a beautiful presentation.

I thought that this dish was just OK. It looked beautiful, but did not seem flavorful enough. Maybe some fresh basil mixed in with arugula would help. I don't think I will make this again.

I was looking for a low fat meal to serve to company. Everyone loved it. Next time I might cook the garlic a little first. Thanks

My husband absolutely loved this recipe. I thought the fish was a little too much for me, I'm not a die hard fish lover. I would defiantly make this again with a "softer" fish such as tilapia or flounder. As for the other ingredients, didn't and won't change a thing!

This was a wonderful recipe. Easy to make (since we have arugula growing in the garden!). Since another reviewer suggested using less arugula, I did so, but would use more in the future. Definitely a winner. Thanks for sharing this recipe with all of us.

This recipe was quick, cheap and easy to make. The arugula was a bit too overwhelming for me. Next the time I make it I will try spinach instead. But my dinner partner found the arugula to be complementary to the fish. Aside for the differing opinions on the arugula, we both agree that this dish was great. I will definitely be making this again!!!

I made lots of changes to this recipe and it still came out great--I couldn't find Orange Roughy, so I made it with Sea Bass. I also used pre-washed baby spinach instead of the arugula. I dizzled a little olive oil on the spinach and also added a couple of kalmata olives. The bottom line---a perfect weeknight dinner and my husband liked it!

Really easy! It was a bit bland, but adding some minced roasted garlic and extra spices from the cupboard boosted it a lot. The fish comes out wonderfully moist and just right. The only problem was determining when it was done enough; that should get easier next time. Highly recommended as a great, easy fish dish.

This was an excellent meal, would serve for company, easy to prepare. I had to use frozen spinach in place of Arugula, and it was great.
