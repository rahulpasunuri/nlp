These are so-so. If you like cakey chocolate chip cookies, you'll like these.

Alternatively, you can follow the recipe on the back of the Ghirardelli chips bag for a much less dry cookie and simply add some sea salt.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and substituted 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown sugar for the vanilla sugar, but the cookies came out dry and crumbly. What remedy is there for dry cookies?

Loved this recipe. Substituted half cup brown sugar and half cup regular sugar for vanilla sugar. To increase the vanilla flavor from not having the vanilla sugar we added slightly more vanilla than the recipa called for, approximately a heaping tblsp in lieu of just a tblspn

Could use a little extra chips and definitely a generous pinch of sea salt on top (I used flaked). Also, I didn't find them to be fragile and they slid right off my non-stick sheets (with a spray of Pam).

After a few tweaks, great recipe. I used 1/2 cup (regular) white sugar, 1/2 cup light brown sugar & a generous tsp of vanilla as suggested in the reviews. I also used regular semisweet chocolate chips as it was all I had, and they still turned out wonderfully. I rolled the tops in coarse sea salt and dusted off excess instead of sprinkling. PS: The dough is stiff and stays in doughball shapes when baked, which might not be for everyone, but I loved.

A very unassuming recipe but delicious! The salt explodes in your mouth then ends with creamy chocolate on the finish. Used Maldon sea salt and the crystals provide a nice crunch contrast to the silky cookie.

The cookies are fantastic. a few modifications made them even better! Use only very high quality chocolate,preferably valrhona or something similar. for an interesting twist on texture, saute up some chocolate nibs in butter after running them through a food processor, pour most into the batter but save some for topping the cookies prior to baking. DO NOT use milk chocolate or anything sweet. I split the sugar using half white and half light brown. For the salt I substituted vanilla fleur de sel instead of straight salt and sprinkled that on top of the cookies with the remaining buttered nibs and well, WOW. Everyone loved these. A few who really have a sweet tooth liked them but preferred straight up sweet. Kids, professional pastry chefs, chefs and regular lovers of food loved these cookies. Just follow the procedures for mixing or you ruin the texture and subsequently the flavor. Try it this way, you will be amazed. Oh I also increased the vanilla. Enjoy!!!

These cookies are absolutely amazing. They're not exceptionally sweet, and if you're looking for a traditional chocolate-chip cookie, you may consider another recipe. However, these cookies are more intense and the depth of flavour is wonderful. I often use Lindt's Intense Mint dark chocolate when I make them. After a few days, they taste somewhat like Pepperidge Farm's Mint Milano cookies. I make this recipe all the time.

a nice shortbread style chocolate chip cookie. as others have said this is good for the "not-so-sweet-set". I used a variety of white, semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips and 2 cups of roasted whole almonds. Really good.

I was thrilled at the concept, but after reading the reviews, decided to experiment a little. I made one batch following the recipe exactly, the second bath following the recipe exactly but substituting Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips for the bittersweet chips and the third batch adding 1/2 a cup of brown sugar, an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a 1:1 mix of milk chocolate and bittersweet chips. The first batch (true to the original recipe) was good, but not what I'm looking for when I want a cookie. The second batch was better, but the third batch was the best by far. I like this cookie as I'm not a big fan of toothache-inducing sweets but it's true - the original recipe is a bit unspectacular. Great concept though!

The concept is great but the cookies turned out bland; the batter wasn't sweet enough.

I wanted to like this recipe, but they just didn't do it for me. I think part of the problem is the basic cookie recipe isn't that good to offset the shock of the salt. I do typically like sweet + Salty, like chocolate covered pretzels or kettle corn, so thought I would like this. Oh well, it was a fun experiment and to each their own. The real test is to see how quickly my office snatches up the plateful in the lunchroom -- I have a theory that you could put just about anything sweet in there and it would be gone by 10am...

Conceptually, I thought these were great. There are many better batter recipes out there and I will change the batter next time, but the idea of bittersweet chocolate and salt on top is excellent. Use even more salt than you think you should - it evens out during baking.

If you love salty and sweet, as I do, these cookies are a must. They are so, so good.

The taste of the salt is really good and we would definitely recommend this recipe. We decided to make this recipie on "the-biggest-snowstorm-in-fifty-years" day in Boston. We divided the recipie by half. Well - it did not exactly work out because our oven went into meltdown (shot up to 450F instead of 375F... the second batch was great) but inspite of the burnt bottoms, we really relished the cookies.

What's with the paranoia about taste, people? the person who tried it, loved it? Get over the shock of a new idea (i.e. something other than straight sugar) and don't knock it til you've tried it!

The oven temperature is in Fahrenheit. 375 Celsius would be far too hot for baking cookies.

Just wondering if the temperature is in Celius or Farienheit?
