oh my this is delicious, I made it to serve as a salad with mango and raspberries on a hot summer day. The broth is so good, I froze it in 1 cup measures and will use it to add to soups as I make them. We eat a lot of Japanese food and altho the recipe refers to Chinese Chicken most of these ingredients are also used in Japanese recipes, the only substitution I made was a white table wine instead of the shaohsing wine.
