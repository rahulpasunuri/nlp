I made these to accompany soup and they were really good. I also halved the recipe, and it worked out fine.

Spectacular looking and tasting. Fairly time consuming to make as described, but with perfect results. I'd suggest cutting the onions into 8ths not 6ths... most of my wedges didn't feel like an easy mouth full and its nearly impossible to cut while eating. Made some with 4 and others with 6 slices per tart: 6 was better. Reheated very well. A great dinner party appetizer.

Delicious and, as the recipe states, can be made the day before and reheated. There is a picture in the Gourmet's Fresh Cookbook.

Although I like onions, they were a bit too overwhelming in this dish. Mine turned out a little soggy. Perhaps I used too much of the creamy onion stuff.

This is an easy and elegant dish. I made one big one instead of several small ones and it was beautiful! The creamy onions on the bottom are wonderful.
