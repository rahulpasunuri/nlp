I've made this recipe for many years since it was first published. Made it this weekend for a party and it was the hit of the afternoon. I don't understand other reviewers not liking it. I always get raves.

This one falls into the category of an "old reliable." I've made it again, and again, and AGAIN. It's always a hit. The combination of sweet and spicy never fails to delight those who have had it before and usually intrigues those who haven't.

I like all the spices used in this recipe so I thought I would enjoy this, however, that was not the case. The spices over-power everything - very disappointing.

I have made this several times and it has been a hit at each party. It is delightfully different. And spicy - beware if you have Watermelon Purists...I usually prepare a small bowl of plain, cubed watermelon for those who cannot tolerate spicy foods.

I love both watermelon and cilantro, but the spices hide the taste of both. It's potentially a way to use a flavorless watermelon that you would otherwise toss...and effectively hides the cilantro taste for your friends who don't care for it. Not a keeper for me or my family.

This recipe had a very unique taste, but it was to "way out" for the family and me. Sorry, I won't be doing this one again

I found this recipe while looking for a watermelon salsa recipe. It's similar to watermelon salsa and is very unusual, easy and tasty. It is great with BBQ chicken. I will definitely make it again, and look forward to trying it with basil.

I first made this when it appeared in June '93. Maybe the unusual combination of ingredients has kept others from trying it. The first time I used basil; the second time, cilantro. Delicious both times. A great way to use watermelon that's not sweet enough to have for dessert. Just add a little sugar to the seasonings.
