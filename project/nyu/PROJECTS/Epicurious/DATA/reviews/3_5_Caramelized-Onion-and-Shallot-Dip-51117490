This is the best onion dip that I've ever had!! I love Bon Appetit! I've made it twice now and both times people have asked me for the recipe. Working in the restaurant industry and loving food, it's always a great feeling to make something and have my chef friends freak out about it. I don't know why this has any bad reviews! If you don't like this, you must not like caramelized onions...or thyme...or flavor. Definitely my go to onion dip! Love!

This is fantastic! It was adored by all and was better each day. It would be great on sammies, potatoes and cardbord too!

Surprised to read the bad reviews! I made the recipe as written for a party, and it was wildly popular. Every last bit was devoured by our guests. I too made it a day ahead to let the flavors blend. Highly recommend if you're an onion dip fan. Note that it's nothing to look at, but tastes terrific.

Tres Yuck! I thought the carmelized onions sounded good but the result was compost,

I thought this was good, but not good enough for the time and effort it took. I do think it tastes better if you make it ahead of time and let the flavors meld together before serving.

Great recipe but make one day ahead for best flavor.
