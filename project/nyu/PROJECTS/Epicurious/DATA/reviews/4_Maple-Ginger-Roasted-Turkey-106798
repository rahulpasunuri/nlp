I made this for my new Dutch family the first time I prepared an American Thanksgiving for them nearly 10 years ago, and it was such a big hit, it's become the family tradition. My Dutch stepson even uses this recipe (along with the chorizo dressing) to impress his Dutch friends who want to enjoy an American tradition. Do be careful if you use a brown-in-bag set-up, as the glaze is sticky and may peel off (that happened one year).

This was great! I forgot to add my minced giblets to the gravy but loved it anyway. The stuffing was also a hit, yum! I tried a different recipe last year, this one will be the tradition from now on.

I thought the glazed for the turkey was very tasty. I couldn't locate any corn bread so I made my own for the stuffing and the two flavours of the stuffing and the turkey was amazing. The gravy was very tasty as well......

This was absolutely divine! Perfect for a rich, gourmet Thanksgiving. This was my first turkey, and I'm so glad I chose this recipe. It was a challenge, but I passed with flying colors. I used everything to a t, and added a few things extra, I really wanted to nail the 'maple flavor'. I used the chorizo stuffing too, with a wild turkey that I brined in a maple syrup and juniper berries, etc. It couldn't have come out better! The turkey was incredibly juicy and moist. And you could really taste the maple flavoring too. I have to say, glaze is the way to go if you want that 'perfect turkey' look. Excellent!

superb! i made this for xmas. i brined it and the meat was firm and moist. i would definitely recommend stuffing the bird as the stuffing from inside the turkey cavity was heavenly. the stuffing i did in the cassarole was good but couldn't touch the stuffed stuff...

Amazing recipe. I too brined my turkey (was a 10 lb), which makes the turkey more moist. If you do brine, some recommend not stuffing the bird as the stuffing gets too salty. For sure use low-sodium broth and butter if you do. I used two cups of Kosher salt in 5 quarts water. Results were spectacular, with a wonderful dark glaze to the bird. Everyone loved it.

This is the best turkey I have ever had! The stuffing is a MUST. I've started making roasted chicken with this recipe, just so I can have it more often and not spend as much time as turkey requires.

Okay - this was the BEST turkey I have ever made. Rave reviews from my Thanksgiving guests - so moist and tasty(I brined the turkey using the instructions in the Bob Appetit '03 Thanksgiving issue)and other than that, followed the recipe to a tee. The glaze was fabulous, the gravy spectacular, and we very much enjoyed the stuffing. Just finished all the leftovers today and are very sad it's all gone! This one's a keeper.

I'd give this 4 forks based on the incredibly yummy glaze, but I didn't think the stuffing was too spectacular so I just gave it 3. It did however make a gorgeous "varnished"-looking turkey. Only made a 13-pound bird so I have some glaze leftover, which I'm looking forward to using on some of the wild ducks my sweetie brings home. The gravy also was out of this world.

I made this for the second time this past Christmas. We brined the bird overnight and and rotissed it instead of roasting in the oven. We used all of the glaze on the turkey and used the the drippings (and turkey stock previously added to the drip pan) to make a delicious gravy. I used more ginger than called for and threw some dried orange peels (Chinese style) in the pan stock for a more intense ginger-orange flavor. I love this recipe.

I'm making it for the second time tonight. The only changes I've made are an increase in the amount of ginger in the glaze (I don't really measure these things), and a time adjustment, of course, for a smaller turkey.

This turkey was not only delicious, it was one of the most beautifully browned birds we've ever made. And the gravy was the most heavenly gravy I've every had. We did do two things a little differently from the recipe at our house: 1)We brined the turkey the night before with a mixture of water, course salt, brown sugar, and chipotle powder. Brining helps the turkey stay incredibly moist. However, you'll want to be sure to decrease the salt in the rest of the recipe, or you may want to skip brining if you don't like salt at all. We also only added 2 tablespoons of leftover glaze rather than all of the remaining glaze to the gravy. This gave the gravy a nice hint of maple-ginger, without making it too sweet.
