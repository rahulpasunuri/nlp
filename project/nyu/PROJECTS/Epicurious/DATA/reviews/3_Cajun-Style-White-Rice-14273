This is exactly what I was looking for! Despite the derision regarding this recipe, there is a difference in the texture of rice. Chinese rice is usually "sticky" and that is what I usually make. I wnated a more traditional "southern" recipe (without using Uncle Ben's). Thanks Epicurious!

1. I don't see where the Cajun-bit comes in. 2. It's laborious and time-consuming. I cook my (basmati)rice in 10 minutes and it tastes fine. 3. It is, however, the funniest recipe on this site.

it's really pathetic that nouveau cooks who think they know everything become so pretentious they don't understand a) technique, which can make a big difference in taste and texture, b) some people ARE learning to cook and use this site and c) there ARE differences in the way different cultures and areas cook rice. Sheeeesh.

I, too, had never made rice this way before. The Jambalaya is great and the rice goes well with it. I've made this recipe several times already to go with other stuff as well. It is good as a make-ahead, too for a quick mix-in with a stir-fry or skillet dish. Thanks!

I don't know how you "rice smart" people cook your white rice, but I sure don't do mine this way. I believe this method is about the texture of the rice & how it matches up with the Cajun recipes. Just as with jasmine & basmati rice is for Asian recipes.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! It's about time that somebody finally posts the proper way to cook Cajun Rice. For years, I've complained to me friends and relatives in Louisiana that nobody knows the proper way to cook rice the Cajun way. The Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, etc. cook rice totally differently, and their rice wouldn't fit a good Cajun dish. You people should be ashamed of yourselves. If you knew ANYTHING about rice, you'd know that we Cajuns cook rice differently than everyone else.

I agree with all the other reviews. That's just rice. For a good south louisiana rice dish, go to Paul Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen" cookbook. But I don't really know of anyone (restaurants) who do it that way either.

Not only is this Cajun rice, but it is also Chinese, Japanese and Pilipino rice.

I give this recipe Four Forks rating because of the laugh factor! I was actually thinking about subscribing to Gourmet Magazine but now I'm not sure it's necessary. After all, I CAN boil an egg, steam rice, and make Jello, so why waste my money on their recipes?

You're kidding us, right? It makes me wonder if this was written by the same San Francisco Chronicle food editor who said a fresh new way to eat fruit is "out of hand...." Please, oh please, tell me this is a joke....

Oh my gosh! I can't believe it. This recipe is EXACTLY like the recipe on the side of the bag of rice I bought. I had no idea that for years I have been eating Cajun rice without knowing it. This must be some conspiracy fomented by the rice farmers of America. What will I do now? If I want to eat rice with my Asian dinner, I may not want to eat Cajun rice. What will I do?!?!?

What is this fascination with all things cajun? This was plain white rice. Go buy a box of Uncle Ben's and cook it according to the directions. You get the same result. Sadly, there will be many people out there across the country who will see this recipe and insist it is somehow really 'cajun'. They will cook it and serve it to their friends as if it's something special. Worse, the will all think they have some spiritual connection to that con artist Emeril Lagasse, just because they cooked a pot of rice. If you want plain rice, go buy a rice cooker. It's a lot easier to use.

This rice is fine for a plain rice dish, but offers nothing in the way of Cajun style cooking. Why it is called "Cajun-style white rice", is beyond me.

With the exception of the salt (which I omit), this is identical to standard Chinese rice. It cooks up fluffy every time, has a wonderful texture and (surprise) tastes great! I have modified it just a touch for easier cleanup and that adds a Tablespoon of olive oil, which serves to coat my pot so there are fewer grains that stick to the sides and bottom of the pan. The oil does not alter the taste of the rice and there is no apparent residue transferred to any food served along side (or on top of) the rice.
