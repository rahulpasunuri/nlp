This was great! I have a toddler so I mashed the squash and used refried beans instead of black and the spices in it. I also sprinkled a little cheese on top of the squash and beans while omitting the middle cheese tortilla. He gobbled it up!

I love these and have made them twice. I took another reviewers advice and grated the squash, much better! I also only had small/fajita tortilas so I made 4 smaller stacked. I also only used 3 tortilas where I put squash on the bottom, then bean, then the cheese one, but flipped it so the dry side was on top and the cheese was stuck to the bean. Really good and I think another tortilla probably would have been too many.

My immediate thought and confirmed after reading the reviews of butternut squash in this recipe prompted me to add butter and brown sugar to the squash. I cubed half a squash with a tbls brown sugar and 1 table spoon butter and roasted at 400 for 40 minutes. Next time maybe more sugar, but it was still tasty. Secondly, I wouldn't toast the corn tortillas this way next time. I would probably just warm them on a skillet next time so they remain soft. The oven made them more crunchy and less pliable than I would've liked. Throw in some avocado too!

We make this recipe all the time but we put the squash in the food processor so it's sort of shredded. Trying to eat this with squash cubes falling out would be a pain but it's effortless this way and much quicker! I don't know what's with that 1 cup hot pepper ingredient... we don't use it.

I agree that butternut squash can be time-consuming but not only if you use 8 oz of it, as the recipe says. The result of my cooking was an okay, it would be helpful if the recipe has more details and directions. For instance, which type of salsa is good to use & etc. Next time I make this, I'd figure out how to spice it up to enjoy the meal.

After reading the prior reviews, I was prepared to think this was only going to be "ok." but i had all of the ingredients on hand and decided to go for it. it was really terrific!! The butternut squash doesn't lead the dish with flavor, which may be why some think it didn't add anything. However, we found that it adds significantly to the whole experience, taste, and texture of the dish. It is a slightly hidden flavor that elevates the dish from the usual bean and cheese quesadilla to something truly unique and flavorful. My family really loved it. I wasn't sure if the dish was true to its number of servings (4) so I doubled the recipe for my hearty eaters. Fortunately, I only assembled 1 quesadilla. With a hearty green salad, we did not need the second quesadilla. we saved the rest of the filling to be assembled for dinner tonight. Will definitely make it again.

We really enjoyed these and I agree - I think the squash made the recipe. Great way to add some nutritious veggies to a fun/casual dinner.

This was good, not great. I agree with the first reviewer; this took longer than stated to prepare, and I don't really think the butternut squash added anything.

We made this tonight and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our salsa was store made and hot. We are a non-cilantro household so you won't find that in our quesadilla but the other flavors mixed together beautifully and delightfully. A great, meatless and nutritious weeknight dinner.

We made this recipe for the first time this week and thought it was great. The butternut squash is a great compliment to the rest of the dish and while cutting it can be a little time consuming it was well worth it.

I made this last night and was quite disappointed. First of all, the squash took much longer than stated in the directions. In addition, I felt the dish was VERY time-consuming overall. I do love butternut squash but it didn't really fit into this recipe in my opinion. We did eat it, but it wasn't that good and I would never make it again without some major altertions.
