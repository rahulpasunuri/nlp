Whoops! Forgot to click the I "make it again" box. I am making it now!

These are wonderful and easy, I have made them a number of times, and have a friend who requests them every time she has an party. Lovely. Sometimes I just do a pile of fennel, my 4-year-old loves it. Vary the veggies as you see fit.

A quick way to ruin perfectly lovely vegetables. I love the taste of vinegar, but I was hoping it would add to the veggies, not destroy them. The vinegar taste isn't even particularly interesting.

This sounds like the fantastic pickled veggies that used to be served at northern California Mexican cafes back in the '70s - before everything was standardized to "Tex-Mex" bowls of salsa and chips. MUST make it!

These look gorgeous and taste fabulous. I had no sweet potato so used a parsnip. A Chinese lunch guest said it was very similar to a Chinese recipe, but the Chinese recipe includes a slice or two or fresh ginger. I intend to try ginger the next time I make these pickles.
