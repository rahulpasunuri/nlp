I thought this was good, but not good enough to make again. There are other spring vegetable recipes that I think are more interesting. I couldn't find chanterelles, so I used shiitakes instead. And, I thought the cooking time on the beans and onions was too short, because mine were crunchier than I'd have preferred (particularly since the other vegetables were soft).
