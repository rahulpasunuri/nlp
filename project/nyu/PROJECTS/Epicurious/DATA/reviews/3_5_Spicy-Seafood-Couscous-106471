Very good to excellent! Lots of work but tasted good. May want to add a little chili to the tomato saue before using with couscous or to cook the fish.

This is absolutely delicious, and really very easy to prepare. Although it can be expensive to make, you can vary the seafood depending upon local availabilty/price. Always gets rave reviews from guests!

This is an excellent dish. We used just one box (5.6 ounces) of couscous and adjusted the amount of liquid to what was recommended on the box. We reduced the seafood by about one half. It still made a very large quantity of food. The seafood was delicious and the hot sauce is a lovely touch. It is unforunate that the editors of this site posted the recipe exactly as it is printed in the magazine. Readers of Bon Appetit would see that it is embedded in an article about Sicily and would be spared the research required by the writer from Luxembourg. I agree that harissa would be more authentic choice of hot sauce, but I suspect American cooks would find Thai chili sauce or paste much more readily available in the supermarket. I made my own harissa with dried chilis and it was excellent.

I regularly make (and eat in restuarants) couscous, so I was excited when I saw this recipe. Being confused by the ingredients, I did some research and found Trapani is in Sicily. Okay. But I was very disappointed in the results, and it's not a cheap dish to make. There was TOO TOO much liquid. The couscous itself did nothing for the "soup" and, incidentally, it's HARISSA (a spicy red pepper paste) they use with couscous, NOT sambal (which I doubt they have in Trapani). The cioppino or Italian fish soup/stew recipes on this site are much much better. Spare yourself.
