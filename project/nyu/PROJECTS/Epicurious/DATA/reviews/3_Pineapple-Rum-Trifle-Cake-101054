I made this for a party of 20 people. After reading other reviews, I multiplied the recipe by 1.5, made the cake in 3 nine-inch round pans, and cut 2 of the layers vertically to make 5 layers. There were no leftovers. I also replaced half of the pineapple with mango. The cake was very well received - I will certainly make it again. Next time, I won't add the whipped cream until the last minute - it started to look a bit funky because of all the fruit juice.

I made this for Easter dinner and it was OK. Cake didn't rise so divided it into 3 pieces and that worked out ok too - had an oblong cake. (Thanks to the tip from another cook who did the same thing). I might try dark rum next time. It just needs a little extra something and maybe that might do it. Was fun and easy to make. Keeps well in refrig. I decorated it with fresh pineapple pieces.

Pina Colada lovers take note! I made this with Meyer's dark rum and it tasted like a tropical cocktail. Even better on second day. My guests preferred it over the Cherry/Almond trifle. Only quibble was that cake didn't rise so I cut base into 3 equal portions and stacked 3 high. Still delish and served 10 easily.

This recipe was easy and simply delicious. Don't be fooled by the 7" square. With the 5 layers of cake, it easily fed 10 people after a meal. I used coconut flavored rum (Malibu Rum) and added toasted coconut to the top and additional chopped pistachios on the sides after frosting to give it better presentation and a little extra taste.

I made this for Easter. I don't feel I got the bang for the buck. It was tasty but not that great. I wouldn't make it again.

Excellent! Made as a birthday cake for a friend's husband. Light, moist, and easy to make. Everyone loved it.

I made this cake in April '98, when it appeared in Gourmet, for my husband's birthday. It was fantastic - just the thing to welcome spring. It would make a wonderful Easter dessert. I have since made the rum sabayon to use as a dessert sauce - it's unbelievably heavenly - I had never cared for for sabayon too much, until I tried this one. It makes you want to add it to every cake, pudding and fruit dessert recipe in your repetoire!

This trifle cake was wonderful. I've made it three times now. My guest loved it so much it's a request when they come to my house.
