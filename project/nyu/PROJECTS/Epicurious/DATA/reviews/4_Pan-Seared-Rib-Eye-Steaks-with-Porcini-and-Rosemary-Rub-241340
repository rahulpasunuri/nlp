this is just delicious. I did nto have porcini mushroom, so I substituted 3 cheese bread crumbs, but I rubbed porcini mushroom evoo on the steaks, everything else was the same. Grilled these steaks and they were absolutely the best.

Delicious. A little too much pepper, but otherwise I thought this was intensely savory and cranked the already buttery flavor of ribeye up to 11. I will definitely make this again.

I did this recipe as a rub - after marinating some try-tip roasts for an hour and a half in soy sauce, I mixed the dry mushroom-porcini mix, along with a clove of minced garlic (leaving out the salt, as there was plenty with the soy sauce) with about 3-4 Tbsp. olive oil and smeared it over the whole piece of meat before grilling. The best steak sandwiches ever, and folks kept going back to the table to just pick at the meat, sop up the juices, etc. A huge success, can't wait to repeat for another gathering!

Fantastic recipe. Have made it several times, both pan-seared and grilled. Both ways were delicious. I've found I prefer a little less rosemary relative to porcini than recipe calls for, but that's just a matter of personal preference.

This recipe is fairly easy, and very delicious with fresh ingredients. It took about 40 minutes for prep work and cooking. I did a little less than the recommended porcini and a little more than the recommended rosemary, and it worked out particularly well. However, the soy sauce can be overpowering if you use a very strong style or soak it for too long--an hour and a half works well, more and it might be too salty.

I've made this wonderful rib-eye recipe four times now, and every time, without fail, it comes out beautifully. Guests have said it was the best steak they've ever had. YES, open windows and turn on the vent fan if you have a small kitchen, but otherwise it's perfection, especially on an induction cooktop!

This was very tasty and definitely better than any restaurant steak I could get without driving two hours to Chicago. I seared in a skillet and finished in the oven due to a small poorly ventilated apt/kitchen.

Well, I've found this is the perfect steak recipe. Every time I've made it, I get asked for the recipe.

Definitely very good and easy to make. Not the best I've had. I'm still looking for that perfect steak recipe!

My Grocery Store had Prime graded Rib Eyes for 5.99 lb so I bought as much as I could and went looking for a recipe. This is great only change was added a little smoked paprika to rosemary porcini rub. Grilled them outside over charcoal rather than grill pan.

Fantastic steak every time. I had to alter the recipe because I live in an apartment and smoke can be a big issue. I eliminated the oil and then did the following: Place a cast iron skillet in oven and heat oven to 500 degrees. When oven reaches temperature, remove pan and place on range over high heat. Immediately place steak in the middle of hot, dry pan. Cook 30 seconds without moving. Turn with tongs and cook another 30 seconds, then put the pan straight into the oven for 2 minutes. Flip steak and cook for another 2 minutes. (This time is for medium rare steaks. If you prefer medium, add a minute to both of the oven turns.)

This preparation has FABULOUS flavor. We bought dry-aged rib-eye's ($25.99/lb at Whole Foods) and that may be part of the great results but we thought we'd died and gone to heaven. Better than any steak we've had at high end steak restaurants.

Also used NY strip steak. I had my doubts about this recipe, but it far exceeded our expectations. The rub was fantastic. SO said it was better than any steak house dish. Would serve with a nice mashed potatoe,asparagus. The only change I would make would be to use low sodium soy next time. Deceptively amazing dish.

I used NY strips and they were very good. It was so easy to make for the quality of the finished product. I served it with sweet potato fries and roasted vegetables.

Spectacular. Grilled NY strips outdoors and they were fabulous. Perfect with garlic mashed potatoes drizzled with basil-infused olive oil and a green salad. Step back for the raves.

Man. I used chuck eye steaks(2) and between the soy soak ahead of time and the porcini rub these babies melted in our mouths. They were earthy, rich, and oh, so tasty. I havent had a steak this good in quite a while. You cant beat the ease of preparation. This is a keeper for sure. Have with smashed red taters that have a drizzle of truffle oil, and big fat Cab or Syrah, and Nirvana is within reach!

Served this as a great big steak for 2 - seared it just as directed but in my Dutch Oven, great crust. I served this with roasted asparagus and red onions with a creamy orange dressing. Delicious!

Great recipe, the crust was delicious. I added minced oregano. I seared it and then finished it in an 375 oven till medium rare Served with sesame asparagus and baked sweet potato fries YUMMY

The rosemary and mushrooms make an outstanding combination. I was skeptical of the soy sauce marinade (often makes the meat very salty), but this was perfect. Served it with red wine risotto and sauteed spinach.

easy to prepare and delicious. The soy sauce residual taste was perfect with the rosemary and porcini crust. Served with a napa cabbage coleslaw and smashed taters with bacon and carmelized onions.

Great recipe, I will make this again soon, A great addition to the steak prep arsenal.

This was fantastic, the rosemary and dried porcini make a great crust. I had never cooked ribeye before, but this turned out perfect. Very easy to make, and well worth the effort. I made the kale with smoked paprika and the mashed potatoes/Jerusalem artichokes from the same issue as side dishes.The leftover porcini are going into a tomato soup next week.

Made this the other night with roasted aparagus, sauteed mushrooms and onions, and smashed red potatoes. Easy dinner and so delicious! My boyfriend literally licked the pan clean. A winner!

I substituted thick New York strips for the rib-eye and broiled instead of pan-seared. The combo of the soy sauce and porcini/rosemary/pepper. Excellent.
