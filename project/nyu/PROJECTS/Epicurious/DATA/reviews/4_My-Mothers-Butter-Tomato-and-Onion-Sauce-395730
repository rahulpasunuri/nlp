This is a delicious and easy sauce. I have seen the recipe a few other places and they recommend taking out the onion at the end, which I do and save for a tasty treat later. Otherwise, unless you use a blender, you will have two onion halves sitting in the tomato sauce. It also usually takes me closer to an hour to reduce it the correct amount, but the whole thing is so simple, I don't mind the extra cooking time. One final note, if using canned tomatoes, check if have salt already added or not before you salt the sauce. A great alternative to more involved sauces!

Pealing the fresh tomatoes is a matter of taste. With organic Romas grown in my own garden, I like to keep the skins on. Also, I don't cut them up, I just let them cook down in the same way the onion halves do!

Wonderful recipe. I made this with fresh organic tomatoes and it took a lot longer than 45 minutes to cook down. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

The simplicity of this sauce is hard to beat and I agree that the butter is a great way to balance the acidity of the fresh tomatoes. It is really rich, though, and I think next time I might experiment with a little less butter and see how it goes.

Obviously very easy, and very good. The butter really mellows the tomatoes in a lovely way, so it is a real change of pace from the typical tomato sauce. I did feel I needed to stir more frequently than the recipe advised when it got to the last 20 minutes or so of cooking, to prevent the sauce from sticking and burning.

Very simple. Reminds me of the pasta sauce we ate in Italy.

I started making tomato sauce this way for my daughter when she was a toddler, and it is still the family favorite. The butter balances the tomatoes' acidity perfectly and adds some richness. Simple and delicious.
