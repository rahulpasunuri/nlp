No juice or flavor whatsoever. Dry, flavorless crust. My intuition told me to doctor it up with some cinnamon or lemon or SOMEthing, but I held fast to the recipe and was embarrassed to serve it at a dinner party of mystified friends who are used to yummy baked goods from my oven. The creme fraiche just added insult to injury. Bleck.

I've enjoyed this twice this week: not too sweet, elegant appearance, easy to make, and a perfect way to use fresh rhubarb (and substitute other fruits). Ice cream is an improvement over the creme fraiche.

This was good. You better love rubharb though, as that is really all there is to the dish. The crust was perfect and the creme fraiche was a must because it balanced well against the tartness of the rhubarb. I guess a scoop of vanilla ice cream would work too. BTW a galette can be any kind of free form tart, not necessarily just a crepe.

A galette is made with a crepe batter that is made with buckwheat. This is a rhubarb pie.
