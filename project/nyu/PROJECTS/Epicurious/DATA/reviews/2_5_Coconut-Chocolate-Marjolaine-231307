Extremely sweet and the recommended chocolate is overpowering. I had no problem with the "soft" maringue but as noted from previous reviewer it is sticky. I will not make this desert as described but I will try it with ganache topped with berries in between the marengue layers and finish it with whipped cream instead of chocolate. I may sprinkle chocolate shavings on top of the whipped cream.

Would not make this again. As someone else said the "merengue" which is as far from a merengue as possible sticks to everything and falls apart because it is so thin. If I was to ever try this again I would make more traditional merengue that is crispy and sprinkle coconut over the ganache. Also the glaze was way too thick and completely took away from the rest of the dish.

This is the second time I've made this dessert and it is fabulous. Yes, it does take some effort. But I'm one of those cooks who enjoys a challenging recipe now and then. It is very, very rich indeed. Rich and dark chocolaty and just a sliver will do. A beautiful special occasion dessert!

Cake was very rich with the glaze and the ganache which overpowered the coconut. Had alot of trouble with the coconut merengue too, which kept sticking to everything. I ended up having to patch it together. A fun experiment but not worth repeating.

Lots of futzing with it, in and out of the fridge. Tasted like a giant Mounds bar. My mom and I thought the amount of dark ganache on top was too much, dad and 6 year old daughter disagreed. 8 servings? Try more like 12 or 14; this was very rich.

This was just ok, the coconut just didn't go with it, and I like coconut, just my opinion. I guess if you're a coconut lover u can try it but as for me if I do make this again I will make some changes.
