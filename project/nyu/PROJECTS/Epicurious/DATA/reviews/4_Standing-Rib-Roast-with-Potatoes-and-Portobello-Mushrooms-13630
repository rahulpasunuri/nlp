I made this last year and will again this year for Christmas. It is outstanding in favor.

Using a 7.5 lb prime rib roast, I followed the instructions for the roasting technique in this recipe, but after looking at another recipe on this site, decided to take the roast out of the oven earlier -- when the temperature reached 110. As a result, we ended up with a perfect medium rare roast after letting it sit and rest under the foil and come up to temp before carving. If you keep it in until 130, you will not have medium rare, because it continues to cook after you take it out. Ours came up to 130 after about 20 minutes of resting. Everyone agreed it was perfect.

This roast has been the centerpiece of my Christmas dinner for 10 years. I make a few modifications: larger roast, no potatoes (serve with mashed potatoes that I do ahead and reheat in double boiler), mushrooms to flavor the gravy, but not chunks in it. We couldn't have Christmas without this roast!

I thought this dish was very good. I made it during the week, a special night, but used a bottom roast instead of a rib roast. It was still excellent. I also used sweet potatoes, white button mushrooms and in the last 15 minutes threw in green beans to roast. The sweet potatoes were sooo good. Great reviews from the whole family!

Absolutely delicious- personally I'd probably cook it for another 30-45 mins- a bit too rare in the middle for me and a couple of my guests but even they loved it and all swooned over the mushroom sauce- I will definitely cook it again

My mother-in-law cried when I made this for her birthday. It was wonderful and fairly easy to make. Next time, I would try to make more of the mushroom sauce. We ran out before all the meat was eaten!

Who's the deadhead who thought'carne'meant beans? Obviously not a cook. Good recipe, but try slow cooking of black beans, then add, including liquor, to meat. Superb.

Absolutely wonderful! This was my first attempt at cooking a rib roast and it was delicious and easy to do. Our very picky (and mushroom-hating) 14 year old had 5 helpings, leaving us astounded. I added some red wine to the mushroom gravy and cut back on the salt, but otherwise it was perfect.

A Wonderful recipe!! I agree with the cook below that you really need to start with a high-quality cut of beef. It turns out mouthwateringly good and the potatoes and the gravy are both incredible. I will make this one again. Great for a special occasion and holidays!

This has become our standard Christmas dinner! The only modifcation I make is to leave out the mushrooms, and the sauce is still very good.

Fantastic recipe!!!!! I actually cooked it to 140 degrees, for medium rare, and used sage instead of rosemary. A touch of red wine in the gravy would be good, too. My husband said he'd marry me all over again. We also made sure to purchase the best quality cut we could find.

Very good! The portobello sauce was great - also used a horseradish sauce that was good. Cooked the roast to 130 degrees and wished I'd cooked it to 120 - it was a bit too done for my taste. I like it really rare!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was great. An easy recipe where there's not a lot of last minute things to do. I served it with yorkshire pudding. The gravy was fabulous. Be careful not to salt it without tasting first- particularly if you use salted beef broth.

Absolutely fantastic. Best gravy I've ever made. Used half Shiitake and half Portobello. Over thickened the gravy, but it was still great. Can't say enough about this dish.

I have made this dish several times, the last time using yukon gold potatoes instead of russet potatoes. I left the skin on and basted them with the beef broth. Everything turned out wonderfully.

THE MUSHROOMS WERE REALLY VERY GOOD. THEY RECEIVED MORE COMPLIMENTS THAN THE ROAST. COOKING TIMES REALLY WERE A BIT SHORT FOR A MEDIUM RARE RAOST AND THE QUANTITY OF MUSHROOMS WAS PROBABLT A BIT HIGH.

Made this for a New Years gathering....very yummy!Used dried thyme and a combo of 3 mushrooms...everyone loved it, and leftovers were great with eggs and mimosas for breakfast.

Portobello & shiitake mushrooms together make this a more wonderful dish. Pass the champagne please.

This recipe requires an A-1 piece of meat and a trustworthy oven. In our opinion, it just missed earning four forks.

I felt that the temperture recommendations are a little low. Our roast was a difinate rare and maybe a little too rare in the center. However, If you keep the sauce at a rolling boil and place slices in it for just a minute or so, they come out very nice.
