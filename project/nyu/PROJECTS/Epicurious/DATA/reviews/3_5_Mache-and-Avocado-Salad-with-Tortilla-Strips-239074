Made this salad for a dinner party - the bowl was completely cleared! Of course, since I love avocados I doubled up on them. Also, I ended up using baby spinach instead of the mache as indicated in the recipe as 1) I didn't know what mache was, and 2) the fact that baby spinach was a lot easier to obtain in the supermarket than mache. No one ever noticed the difference and the flavors were great together! Everyone ended up asking me for the recipe so, the substitution also passed their "taste test". Have made this salad several times this way ever since and every time this salad is a dish that never has any leftovers! Try it this way and you won't be disappointed!

I topped this salad with the Tequila-Glazed Chicken With Jalapeno, also from this site, to make it more of an entree. I thought it was only okay, but the boyfriend really liked it (and he's picky) so I'll probably make it again. Oh, ALSO: I added jicama (cut into matchsticks) and didn't have enough lime juice for the dressing so I subbed a dash of white vinegar.

I made this to go with chili and it was perfect. Simple to make & good flavor. Thr tortilla strips are a must.

There is nothing earth-shattering here but I really really liked this salad. It was very easy and the tortilla strips were a nice change from croutons.
