This is my new favorite cake, and when you consider its lack of chocolate, that's really saying something. I've been cutting the recipe in half and using my smaller skillet, and we eat it while it's still warm and gooey. Just as a note for people with wheat/egg/dairy intolerances or vegans, I make this using 1:1 substitutions of Earth Balance for the butter, Arrowhead Mills all purpose gluten-free baking mix for the flour, rice milk instead of dairy, and EnergE egg replacer for the eggs. It works great with a lovely texture and flavor.

I wasn't expecting to like this upside-down cake, but it turns out the flavors were very nice -- mild, probably because I used regular rum instead of dark. I used slightly less butter in the topping. Very good, very easy.

Perhaps I don't enjoy bananas enough. This recipe just didn't work for me. The cake was moist and came out of the skillet with no problems, but there was just something that didn't quite blend for me. I would add more cinnamon and leave the nutmeg out to start. I probably wouldn't make this again. Disappointed; it sounded so good.

Do not waste your time. Recipes sounds good but it really is NOT. This is one of the first times a four fork recipe has let me down.

This is a great and easy recipe. The first time I made it, it turned out perfect. I was so relieved because I'm not a great baker. However, I'm a caramel junky so tonight I decided to make this cake again but with a little more caramel in the pan. Can't wait to try it!

Made this today - snowy day, thought it would be great for dessert later after we dig out. I was running low on butter, so I used it for the topping, but used vegetable oil for the batter portion. Also substituted oat flour for 1/3 c of the regular flour. Made some stabilized whipped cream and toasted some chopped pecans to add when serving. ALSO - I did not have a cast iron skillet available. I greased and floured a 9" springform, and fitted the bottom with parchment. I wrapped the base of the pan in foil, lest it should decide to leak (it didn't). Filled with cooked topping mixture, then banana, then batter. Baked on second rack from top at 350 for one hour. Let cool for ten minutes, released springform side. Let cool another ten, removed springform side. Let cool another ten minutes, inverted into ceramic 10" tart dish, removed springform bottom and peeled off parchment. It is perfect! SO excited to enjoy it...

This cake came out very nicely. It was very quick and easy to make and the presentation was quite good. I cut the bananas into rounds (not thin) and arranged them on top of sugar and butter. Gently spoon and spread cake batter on top. I used my 11' cast iron skillet. I have an 8' one too and decided it looked too small. I baked this for 30-35 minutes. It was nicely browned and came out perfectly from the pan. Very delicious- just sweet enough.
