Absolutely would make this again. It was moist, delicate flavor without over powering the fish. I modified this recipe by just using Wahoo cut into 1/2 inch chunks.

Sounds good but where and how much seaweed goes into it? Shall I use some off my miso for the seaweed? Please advise.

I hoped this would be like a dynamite bowl that you can get at a sushi restaurant, but my sauce turned out way too runny. I guess it needs more mayo or less liquid. The sauce was delicious, but the amounts need tweaking.
