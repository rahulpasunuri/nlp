This was strange. The bananas have a really odd texture after sauteing and then baking. The puff pastry was good, but isn't it always? The chocolate inside was all right, but the chocolate rum sauce was WAY to rich for our taste. Won't be making this again.

incredibly rich and delicious-- chocolate sauce was wonderful. I made individual sized pastries-- too big-- next time I'll plan to make 8 triangles out of this recipe and add a few more bananas. Also think it could be made ahead a day or two, store in fridge, then baked.

This was really good. I cut the puff pastry into 8 and made individual servings. Of course, I had to increase the bananas and I quadrupled the chocolate sauce and rum sauce so I could splurge as much as I wanted. I also added nuts to the chocolate/banana filling. I used nice, ripe bananas (with brown spots), so I cut the sugar back to 3 tbspns, as I preferred the natural sugar from the fruit and we felt there was more than plenty of sweetness in the sauce. Next time I want to try this with different fruits and combinations of fruits. Something to think about: I plan to use this cut into heart shapes, topped with whipped cream and strawberries for a wedding rehearsal dinner. Suitably romantic!!

Oh My... Doubled this for a Valentine's Dinner. And 10 people licked their plates clean and looked around for more. Even those that begged for a small piece --- went for seconds. Did the Bananas the night before. Don't bother to cut the Puff Pastry - just make square and turn in the corners. So much easier and quicker. Skipped the corn syrup and add more Rum. Doing the chocolate sauce the microwave - way. Again easier. Do put the pastry back into the freezer and watch your oven - 25 minutes was good for me.

A wonderful, unique dessert. Be sure to crimp the edges of the puff pastry to seal in the syrup.

This is divine--and very rich. The aroma of the syrup/banana saute is wonderful. I might consider slicing the bananas and laying them in concentric circles on the pastry before adding the top layer of pastry. The height of the whole bananas made fitting the equal-diameter circles somewhat difficult. Could also cut the top layer with a 10-inch pastry pan to accommodate that difference. All in all, a terrific dessert.

The puff pastry sheets really make this easy. I halved the amount of chocolate in the sauce and it was fine. Vanilla ice cream would make it perfect!

I almost passed this recipe by but am glad I didn't. I recently served this at a dinner party and there were no leftovers. It is very easy, relatively quick, slightly unusual, and very good.
