Crusty and chewy.

I think that the saltiness is really great. I served it along with some soup and all my guests really enjoyed it!

This was really good bread, BUT, please don't use FIVE TEASPOONS of salt, as written. I will make it again but will halve the amount of salt. The bread was almost too salty to eat, but not quite. It is otherwise delicious, and easy to make.
