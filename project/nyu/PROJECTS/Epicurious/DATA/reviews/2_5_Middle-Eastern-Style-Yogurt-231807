Easy and excellent. Even my picky family who pokes at everything unusual, found this to be both a great dip and dressing for grilled Tri-Tip sandwiches.

I can't use Greek yogurt, as I can only have fat free yogurt. I like the coffee filter idea!

Large coffee filters layered inside a sieve work extremely well and are easy to remove.

just buy greek style yogurt at trader joes and you won't have to drain it.

I would recommend using cheesecloth rather than paper towels. The yogurt drains much better.
