Was kind of surprised by some of the negative reviews on this dish, but decided to give it a try anyway. Decided to up the flavor a little by browning 3 pcs of center cut bacon first and used what little fat was rendered w/1 Tbl of olive oil to cook vegetables in.Took advise of others to add more lemon and dash of red pepper flakes, and used preserved meyer lemons I had made (from this site) along w/ juice of 1/2 fresh lemon. I didn't use any broth or the creme frache, just the pasta water (abt 3/4 cup) and abt 10 oz of penne. 1 1/2 cups of walnuts seemed over the top to me...I would use less next time and would think about drizzling some walnut oil over the finished dish, and maybe using asiago cheese to bring up the nuttiness, rather than the pecorinio.

I was really excited because it sounded like a good nutritious meal with ingredients I love. It came out so bitter though! I don't know if I did something wrong (definitely a possibility!) or if it doesn't have enough of something to cut the bitterness of the rapini and walnuts. Would need to figure out something to "fix" it. Note: I used chicken broth instead of veg broth & whipping cream instead of creme fraiche.

This was really good. I did what a previous commenter had suggested and sauteed bacon into the mix. I also upped the garlic and used Greek yogurt in place of creme fraiche. I didn't have any pecorino, so I went out on a limb and threw in some feta cheese instead. It turned out great! It went really well with some potato rosemary bread and baked asparagus on the side.

This is so good and so easy! I did it with parmesan cheese.

We really enjoyed this 4* dish and definitely will make again. Heeding the previous tips, I added more lemon peel and more crushed garlic. Used Greek yoghurt in place of creme fraiche, used organic red onion tops for leeks, used regular broccoli, added the walnuts to the sauteed mixture, also added salt, dried parsely and basil. I did not use broth but did use some of the pasta water.Fantastic!

I made this dish for my newly vegetarian daughter. It was o.k. but didn't have much flavor. My family would not eat it again.

Because of the prior concerns of this needing a little spark, I sauteed about 1/4 lb of cubed pancetta before the leeks and this came out very tasty (I served the nuts on the side) and will definitely make it again for guests.

This is an easy and tasty recipe. I did the following to add flavor: Saute the garlic in the oil prior to adding the leeks until transparent. Gives more flavor. Also added more lemon peel. Important to use the Pecorino Romano cheese.

This was ok, I tend to like powerful flavors and this was lacking. I think 2x the lemon zest would help, I also added some crushed red pepper and anise seed the second day to try and spice it up.

This was pretty good. After eating it however I'm pretty sure that they meant for you to mince or chop the garlic and that is omitted in the instructions. It just says "4 cloves peeled" with nothing about chopping. I did just that and ate one of the whole cloves which was pretty awful.
