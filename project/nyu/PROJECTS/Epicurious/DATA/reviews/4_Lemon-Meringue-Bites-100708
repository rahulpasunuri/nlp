Made these for a Father's Day Brunch and they were a huge hit. Really tasty & beautiful. Easy to make, just make sure you read the recipe and note how much time each part of the recipe takes - there's a lot of chilling & sitting time!

These do taste amazing, but I hope you have a lot of time to prep them. I took them to a bridal shower and made about 90 to feed 40 people. They were a huge hit, but tiresome. I would make them again, but not try to double the recipe, as it took too long toget everything together.

took the tartlet shells for Thanksgiving filled with apples travel well and don't need to roll out the dough!!

These were wonderful! I highly recommend them. They are easy to make, although you need to allow time for the requisite baking and chilling with the tartlet shells and lemon curd. They are cute little things and were very well received at a party recently. I spooned the meringue onto the lemon curd, and that worked fine, so don't worry about a pastry bag for the meringue.

We had these lemon tarts from a local store that were very good but unfortunately closed today. We had the requisite ingredients in the house and made this. Wow, it's awesome. Definitely satisfies a lemon craving.

Beautiful and delicious. Worth every minute.

this was easy, and the prep is very quick. A great dessert to make ahead so you can focus on the main meal you are preparing if you are having guests. I'm not a meringue fan, so I topped with whipped cream instead. This is everything you want in a lemon pie flavor... took me back to being a kid. Will definitely make again - I've never done curd before and it couldn't have been easier.

These were very very good. Using silicon minimuffin pans makes everything, even clean-up, a breeze. The sweet flaky pastry perfectly complements the tart lemon curd and the meringue is lovely.

Made this for New Year's Eve. It was a big hit. Not sure how to store the tartlet baked but unfilled shells. Have about15 left.

Seems I have a new found talent for delectible little sweet confections.... I took these to a family doo and had to hide them until after lunch, but they were found - and even the adults lied about how many they ate! Totally scrumptious!

Very easy to make. I made it just as specified and added a raspberry on top for color. Everyone loved it. A pretty and easy dessert that I'll definitely be making again.

Time consuming recipe, but delicious and professional looking. Pampered chef makes an inexpensive tool to expedite the making of the tarts. A lot of compliments about the crust and curd. This was my first time making meringue. It took me three times, but by the last time, I realized how important it was to get the egg whites whipped initially and to gradually add the sugar in the end. I would make the curd one day, the dough another, etc... These hold up very well even after several days.

Second time I made these and I must say they are still worth the effort. The lemon curd is the best. I've used many different store bought curds and this one is really worth the effort. I had a little trouble w/ the shells staying together this time so they were not as pretty, but the taste more than compensated. My non-dessert eating husband ate 1 for breakfast today.

I second the rating of "Oh my heck!" (though that's not how we usually say it in these parts). These were so cute, and so delicious, and everyone was all like, "You made this?!?" I had no problem with them falling apart, nor with the whole eggs in the lemon curd. I made it exactly as instructed, and they came out exactly as promised.

These tasted great and were beautiful initially. My question is how to keep them from falling apart. Once they were topped with the meringue, it was difficult to move them at all without the meringue getting destroyed.

Not only were these adorable looking but they tasted incredible. The texure and flavors of the shell, filling and meringue are perfectly matched. I have two things to point out however: 1) As a pastry chef, I questioned the calling for "3 eggs" in the lemon curd recipe as I have never made lemon curd with whole eggs, only egg yolks. I made it the way I was tought, with only yolks and it came out perfectly... typo? 2) The meringue tends to slide off the lemon curd so make sure your your tray etc... is level.

Delicious! But, very labor intensive.

I have made these several times for crowds and they present beautifully and disappear quickly! I buy the lemon curd to cut down on time and fuss. The first time I made them I felt guilty about cheating -- I like the accomplishment of having made everything from scratch -- but everyone loved them so much, I figure there's no shame in simplifying my life as long as the end result is making my guests happy! The meringue is on the sweet side, so I don't use the full amount of sugar.

This seemed like a lot of trouble for a simple dessert, but actually used store bought lemon curd, and made this dessert very quick and EASY. (When I entertain, I don't have time for tedious) They were fantastic! Lime curd can also be used to give more variety on the tray.

Just loved it! Easy to make. Even easier to eat! Could also make it with store bought lemon curd (I recommend William-Sonoma's). Will save a little time.

Oh my heck! I'll never make lemon meringue pie again! These are just too unbelievably good. The tartlet shells are simply phenomenal. I was worried about the lemon filling being too strong, but it balanced perfectly with the buttery tart and sweet meringue. And the finished product is absolutely adorable!

I made these for Easter dinner. We loved them so much, my fiance was eating them for breakfast the next morning.

Delectable! It's best to work on making these over a period of 2-3 days.

I found this to be an excellent recipe and I served it to my guess at a party not long ago and they all seem to love it...
