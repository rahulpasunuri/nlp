YUM! Made it with apricot preserves and challah (egg bread). It was easy and delish.

This was a nice change from ordinary french toast, but it wasn't loved by my family. It didn't seem sweet upon eating it, but afterwards, it was clear that it was very sweet! (I think the cream cheese blunted the sweetness). We used cranberry-orange marmalade. Perhaps a sweeter filling (raspberry?) would have been better? Didn't make the orange syrup to go with. Just powdered sugar and a little maple syrup. Anyway, an easy and tasty breakfast.

A great new twist to regular French toast. I made this with inch-thick Texas-style bread and cut each piece crosswise. For the filling, I didn't have cream cheese and substituted shredded colby and monterey jack. I skipped the baking part and used a large griddle on medium-low heat to cook all the pieces at once. The orange syrup seemed too sweet and too similar of a topping so I opted for light maple syrup instead. Absolutely delicious and will definitely make again.

Made this for Christmas brunch...kids loved it! I used blueberry preserves and maple syrup instead. I had leftovers that reheated wonderfully!

Have made this twice (Easter and Mother's Day Brunches), and will make again and again. Delicious! I prefer with Strawberry Jam, and good ol Maple Syrup. Was able to make this the night before and pop in the oven for 20 minutes to reheat. Came out PERFECT and sooooo YUMMY! It is not over the top in sweetness. It's perfect! Everyone raved about it!! I will be making this again and again.

Delicious and easy. I melted my homemade orange marmalade in microwave and used it in place of the orange syrup.

We thought this dish was a bit "over the top" in the sweetness department -- too much sweet stuff on top of too much sweet stuff.

First had this French Toast at the La Belle Epoch bed and breakfast in Napa, California. Served with a delicious apple-pork sausage. We have made this many times for family who come to visit for the weekend. Always a hit. Definitely a four fork breakfast!

I liked this but it was too soggy, I think I soaked the bread too long, or maybe the bread was too fluffy. I'll try again though because it still intigues me.

Absolutely delicious breakfast recipe! I made it with a low-sugar marmalade and a low-fat cream cheese and my family loved it. Turned out beautiful - garnished with powdered sugar and slices of orange.

An execellent dish. Very tasty. I had enough sauce for about 3 more recipes of French Toast. Next time I will half the sauce.

This is a great recipe ! I made it for 15 ladies and they loved it. I served it with a half orange, scooped out and filled with fruit. A nice presentation. It is definately a 4 fork keeper! A little hint: have bread partially frozen, much easier to slit without tearing bread, and I used a pastry bag to fill. A breeze to make and so good!

Excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed it but I did not use marmalade but raspberry jam instead.
