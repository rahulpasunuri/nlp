TOO SWEET! wow. I love savory bread puddings, so I will make again. But next time I will cut the brown sugar from 2/3 cup to either 1/3 or 1/2. But it's easy and fast...

Great. Took advice of others, then added a few changes of my own but I believe it is still rightfully called tomato bread pudding! My family is wary of bread pudding, so when they asked what I was making, I called it baked panzanella. Everyone tried it and 4 out of 5 loved it! Great!

This is a fabulous side dish with meat or seafood. It's rich, slightly sweet and crunchy - the dish was cleaned out!

Gayle from Richmond, go to: http://www.thatsmyhome.com/farmers/tompudding.htm. It will give you the biscuit receipe, although I don't think my mom used allspice and she did mix everything together! What can we say, we are just country girls!

I am from Virginia and had a dish like this when I was young that was made with stale homemade biscuits and stewed tomatoes. This was very close, but if anyone has a Southern version using biscuits, let me know!

Made it last night to go with roasted asparagus and filet mignon. I halved the sugar and next time will reduce it a bit more. Found the liquid to be excessive and it came out of the oven very soft. I allowed it to sit and it did firm up as it cooled. So I'll cut the liquid by half or else use more bread. Perhaps using stale bread would make a difference. Put grated Havarti cheese on top when I rewarmed it and it really was quite delicious. I'd definitely make it again as it really is different!

This dish is was very good but I did cut the sugar in half and sprinkle grated parmesan on the top. Also, make sure to bake it long enough so the top and edges are nice and crusty -- that was the best part.

Absolutely loved this dish! My husband was wowed also. We had never heard of tomato bread pudding and had to try it. I have made it twice now. Did cut down on the sugar just a tad.

Served this with grilled pork chops and succotash. Everyone loved it! It didn't seem too sweet to me as others have said. I might tinker with the ingredients too.

We had this last night with grilled lamb chops. I found it to be way too sweet for our taste but delicious. Added fresh chopped basil & thyme, onion powder & used veg. broth vs. water. Will do again with my corrections plus adding grated cheese on top and giving a quick "crunch" under broiler....very good!!!!

The southern version of this long-time tomato favorite uses buttered biscuit halves topped with canned or fresh tomatoes dotted with butter and sprinkled with brown sugar. A true delicacy that adds chutney-like contrast to any meal. A much simpler approach and nothing tastes better !

We read the recipe in the recent June issue of Gourmet magazine and decided to make it as our main course with a ceasar salad... However, we completely changed the recipe. For once, we didn't have tomato paste in the pantry. So I decided to use ketchup instead and reduce the sugar... But then we took a completely different course... We sauteed onion and garlic, blended a 28 oz can of whole tomato with sauce, but didn't use all of it, but more than half... instead of water, we used chicken broth, we also added a tad more hot sauce, it's worth it with with sweet tomatoes... we ripped pieces of bocconcini, basil and stuffed within the casserrole, the we added freshly grated parmesian on the top before baking... it was awesome. Crunchy on the top, soft and favorful within... It was absolutely delicious and we'll make it again and again... We made this recipe in two small casserole dishes so we ate one and have one to heat up and enjoy on Tuesday.

I've tried this twice, the first time as printed and I agree that it was a bit too sweet, although not to the level of a dessert. The second time, I cut the sugar to about half a cup and did not pack it, then I sauteed about two tablespoons of garlic in the pan before I added the tomato sauce, etc. I also sprinkled about half a cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese over the buttered bread before I mixed in the tomato sauce. It was very good with the grilled steaks we had for dinner. I might add a bit of Oregano next time.

I just found Savory Tomato Bread Pudding from Gourmet June 1995. It sounds much better and I will try it.

This recipe is way way too sweet. I might make it again with half or less sugar. It does reheat well--but then I put it down the disposal.

This was very sweet, much too sweet for a side dish. It had a pleasant, buttery flavor, but would probably be better for brunch or even an interesting dessert. I'd eat it again if someone else made it, but I won't bother to make it again.
