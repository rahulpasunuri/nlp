I used broccolini instead of broccoli, since I think it makes a nicer presentation. I followed the recipe but added about a half teaspoon of truffle paste when I reheated the mixture. It was delicious, and the truffle paste defined the mushroominess of what otherwise would have been a rather dull dish.

I agree with the other reviewers. It turned out a bit bland; nothing special. The concept was good but the dish was not outstanding.

This was a delicious recipe that I made for Thanksgiving dinner.....everyone raved about it and even enjoyed it as leftovers the next day! I think one of the key points was that I used white wine (which I heated up) to reconstitute the porcini mushrooms, which only took about 10 mins; then used the reserved liquid in the recipe....

I love broccoli and mushrooms, so this was right up my alley. If you think this is bland, add a tablespoon of Oyster Sauce to the mushroom mix. This doesn't make it taste Asian, just brings out the mushroom flavor. I also steamed the broccoli in chicken broth rather than boiling it. This might have helped.

Just plain dull. If you want to use broccoli & mushrooms like this, go for it, but add some balsamic vinagrette, or else a sesame dressing.

I love recipes with wild mushrooms which is why I tried this. Blah! It lacked flavor and interest.
