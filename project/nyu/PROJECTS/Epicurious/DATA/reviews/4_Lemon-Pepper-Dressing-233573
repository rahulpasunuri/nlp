Very good. Went a little lighter on the pepper. Served it mixed greens, goat cheese, dried cranberries and avocados.

This was the first time I made this dressing and I absolutely loved it. I added garlic and fresh dill and cut back on the oil to a little less than 1/2 c since I don't like oily dressings. It was wonderful over romaine, cucumber, avocado, beets and goat cheese.

Each time I have served this I have received multiple requests for the recipe. I used Maile Original Dijon as my mustard, and cut back on the oil to about 1/2 c. to keep the brightness of the flavors. Served over crunchy, earthy lettuce and slivered almonds - it's simply delicious.

Lovely dressing; unusual flavor. I served it over baby romaine with the shellfish chowder from the 11/02 Gourmet -- a good combo.
