Although very good as is, I topped the salad with crumbled blue cheese and walnuts. My pear was not quite sweet enough so I wanted some additional flavor. I think it would also be good with some dried cranberries. Will probably make it again tonight.

This salad is deceptive in its simplicity, but wonderful in flavour -- it's everything previous reviewers have raved about. The textures and sweet/bitter notes are a terrific counterpoint to rich fare. Note to Canadians: this is a perfect accompaniment to Tortiere.

My daughter and I loved this salad. The dressing was perfect with these flavors although I too was afraid it would be too bland. Very refreshing salad. I will definitely make again.

Very good salad! The sweetness of the pear (I used two instead of one) and the bitter greens was excellent. Instead of dessert the salad finished the meal.

I served this as a salad course French Style after the entree. It was a refreshing palate cleanser and the combination of the crisp bitter endive (commented on by a guest) and the sweet mellow pear were a perfect prelude to the cheese course. This is a great, clean, light salad.

My guests loved this salad. it is so simple and the pears offer a refreshing crunch. the dressing may sound bland, but the bitterness of the endive and sweetness of the pear add outstanding flavor to the dressing. definatly try this.

Whenever I serve this salad,I have copies of the recipe on hand. The guests actually demand the recipe.
