The vinaigrette is what makes this recipe. There was quite a bit left over, and I used it on a simple spinach, cuke and tomato salad a week later. It was so absolutely delicious, I'm going to make up a double batch to keep on hand.

This recipe really didn't do it for me. Overall it was pretty boring and I found the taste of the dressing to be downright off-putting. The one good thing I will say in the recipe's favor is that it did look nice on the plate.

The miso dressing on the sauteed cabbage and snow peas is excellent. I sauteed gulf shrimp instead of the fish, making the dish very special.

So nice to have a yummy recipe that incorporates those health bombs, cabbages. Also quick and easy. I added one of our garden leeks, finely cut, ahead of the garlic and cabbage, and gave it 5 minutes.

Only made the dressing for a different asian steak salad and it was FANTASTIC. Looking forward to trying this entire recipe, but the dressing in particular is one I will use with salads and vegetables too. I used red miso, and tahini (a must to give it the sesame essence).

Yum! Easy and delicious. I rolled the fish in flour to make a crispy crust on the outside, and served with brown rice on the side. We got a head of savoy cabbage from our CSA this week, so I left out the napa cabbage and snow peas. The dressing is fantastic - I want to try it on tofu stir-fry and salad. I also really liked the crunchiness of the stir-fried cabbage. I'm used to braising cabbage, which ends up with a much squishier feel. Will be preparing more cabbage this way in the future.

I love this recipe because it's very flexible. You can use different types of white fish, and if you're in a pinch you can substitute the cabbage for mixed greens. Just go lighter on the dressing since it can easily weight down the greens.

The vinaigrette alone is great. Having no tahini I used 1/2 tsp of sesame oil. Also used 1/2 tsp of ginger paste. Came out very well. Use on tempura calamari frisee salad.

Great for left over fish - just do the cabbage and dressing. In place of Mirin wine, I used 1 Tbls. dry sherry + 1/2 tsp. sugar - tasted great.

I was looking for something different to do with brussel sprouts and did a search for cabbage since they're all in the same family. I tossed my sauteed brussel sprouts with the vinaigrette in the recipe and licked the bowl clean. the only change I made to the recipe was to omit the sugar and use the oil for sauteeing instead of in the vinaigrette. It made a delicious low fat/low cal side dish and I'll definitely make it again. Also, please notice that I'm not rating this recipe since I didn't actually make the recipe here.

Very good veggies with a delicious dressing! I used a red miso paste I bought in Japan, with a good flavor. I put in spring onions instead of snow peas and I just used napa cabbage. Don't cook the cabbage too long or else it will start to lose a lot of moisture. I had to drain quite a bit to keep it from being too watery. Dressing was too much for 800 g cabbage (nearly twice the amount in the recipe).

I laughed when I read the review from Dallas, but thankfully tried the recipe anyway. It was easy, delicious, and looked beautiful on the plate. Do keep in mind that Miso is a unique flavor. Not everyone likes it. My family loved it. I did dredge my fish in flour before pan- searing it, giving it a little extra crust. Will definitely make it again.

I'm not sure I have standing to review this, as I didn't actually include the fish! I just made a half-batch of the dressing (minus most of the veggie oil) and put it on a head of napa cabbage (thinly sliced and sauteed until tender-crisp). It was quick and delicious - I bet it would be good on fish too, if I weren't allergic. I used an immersion mixer to make the vinaigrette in a coffee mug - worked great. Actually, I might make a 1/3 recipe of the dressing next time, or get a really big head of napa cabbage. I'm going to try this yummy dressing on tofu or tempeh in the future.

I have made this a couple of times and it is way good. Have impressed my friends. Added some soy to the cabbage mixture and used halibut. Also dredged fish in egg and then bread crumbs before sauteeing - the way I cooked fish I caught as a kid. excellent dish.

This was pretty good, nothing to write home about but a fast and healthy Tuesday night dinner.

Pretty easy! I substituted regular cabbage for the napa and savoy cabbage and it was great still. Also substituted sherry for the rice wine. If you have a tight budget, you can substitute peanut butter for the tahini, and then leave out most/all of the sugar. Great with any type of fish!

GREAT recipe. Very simple. Only suggestions would be to decrease the amount of sesame so its a bit less overpowering and to dredge the fish in rice flour prior to frying so it stays crisp and is not bogged down with the dressing!

A satisfying and nutricious recipe, and a good use of leftover miso paste. I made several substitutions: regular cabbage and celery for the vegetables, sesame oil for the tahini. Unlike a previous reviewer, I found the dressing to be the best part.

great dish, versatile (can use the vinagrette for other food, can put other veges in the stir fry), looks good too

This was, by far, the worst dinner I ever made! Don't waste your money on all the ingredients! The vinaigrette was inedible.

This was excellent. The extra dressing can be used for salads.

Quick and easy to prepare. I used a little sesame oil since I did not have the paste and it tasted just fine.

This recipe is great! However, the sauce is very strong in flavor and I found that the recipe makes way more than what is actually needed. Not a problem, though, because it is surely usable with other dishes. I've made this recipe twice already, once exactly and once with grilled fish, and it was excellent both times.

Easy and very tasty. Nice vinaigrette. Lovely presentation

The vinaigrette was DELICIOUS and so easy to make. The recipe amount was perfect for 2 people. I added more vegetables to the stir fry and it was excellent. Prep work was minimal and the results were fantastic- I will definitely make this vinaigrette again.
