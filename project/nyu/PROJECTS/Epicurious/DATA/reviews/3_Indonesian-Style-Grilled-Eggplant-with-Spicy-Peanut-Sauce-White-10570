I really liked this. I didn't grind the peanuts too fine (used a coffee grinder) and I put the eggplants into the sauce. They sucked up pretty much all the water, so I ended up adding another cup of water so I could serve it over rice. I used an onion since I didn't have a shallot and used rice wine vinegar since I didn't have lemon juice. Will definitely make this again - and also probably use this sauce with other things like tofu etc.

I thought this was really good, with just a couple of common-sense mods already noted. sauteed aromatics in peanut oil (it's true that sesame isnt really for cooking) and used less water per other reviewer. the sauce was great  my only gripe was that there wasn't even enough of it for two of us over noodles!

Quick recipe and easy to make too, but Indonesian people rarely grill the eggplant. We usually coat it with light corn starch and deep-fry it or pan-sear for less grease. Then you can add desirable sauce, mixed or pour on top of it.

This is a delightful dish, really good flavors. We "grilled" the eggplant slices under the broiler and they turned out great! Also, we used a little less water in the peanut sauce for a thicker consistency. We put rice noodles on top of the eggplants and then spooned the peanut sauce over that to make a complete meal. Top with fresh cilantro to really complement the flavors and presentation!

This was really delicious and I will definitely make it again. Interestingly, the first time I made it a substituted peanut butter for the ground peanuts. The product was entirely different and not as good. I always find it distressing when reviewers change recipes and then comment. Make this exactly as written. It's yummy.

Did everything as written, but since I live in an apartment I had to make it in the oven. I broiled it for 4-5 minutes on each side. Even after boiling sauce for a while it was a bit thin so I added a large spoonful of peanut butter and it was a better consistency and flavor.

My husband, a chef, and I really liked this quick meal. We had it with basmati rice so it didn't seem too "saucey" for us. He did make a couple alterations: When cooking the sauce he added rice wine vinegar and once the sauce was done he added about a half cup of coconut milk and warmed it. It made a sweet-spicey sauce! mmm

Very good recipe according to my Indonesian usband and the rest of my dinner guests. I too added water and used less sesame oil. Could have made more eggplant for the amount of sauce.

I agree with one of the reviewers - sesame oil is too strong for sauteeing. I used 1/2 tsp. sesame oil and olive oil for the rest. I also liked the sauce so much that I garnished with fresh tomato wedges and ate them with the sauce. It was very good with white rice.

I haven't tried this particular recipe, but I've made similar dishes and this version seems fine, except for one thing: from my experience, sesame oil is too delicate to use until a dish is almost cooked. It certainly isn't for sauteing anything, as the result can become bitter and strange. Jez my two cents.

I thought it was good. Not as spicy as I'd expected.

This works well with crunchy peanut butter and the eggplant can be roasted in the oven. This is a nice, quick dinner making enough for two adult humans who like eggplant.

A tasty peanut sauce. I substituted the peanuts for salt and sugar free peanut butter. I also didn't have any shallots and used a small yellow onion. T Instead of using just water to thin the sauce, I used about 1/2 cup plain yogurt and 1/2 cup water. This made a great consistancy and flavor.

My sauce was too chunky and salty for my taste. I've reread this recipe to try and figure out what it was that I should have adjusted. If I were to try this again I would food process the peanuts- Tried it w/mortar and pestle. Maybe peanut butter is a better idea. Also low salt soy?

We did not make any changes and thought that it was fine but would not make again. I think using peanut butter would save this recipe. Very quick to make.

I'm not a fan of eggplant so I used this sauce with chicken wings. Cut the tips off the wings and scrape the flesh to the end of the bone (so you have a mini drumstick effect). Fry the wings in seasame oil until just cooked through then use the leftover oil in the pan to start the sauce. Pour the sauce over the wings or return the wings to the pan and stir. I took these to a party and everyone commented on how good they were, they didn't last longer than 10 minutes! The sauce can get very thick if you are using peanut butter instead of peanuts. Just thin it with water.

I thought this dish had wonderful flavor. I made it just as the recipe states, with the pepper flakes. It's definitely a keeper.

I substituted peanut butter for the roasted peanuts, and added chopped roasted red bell pepper and chopped cucumber. It was wonderful as a vegetarian main dish. Additional red pepper can be added to make it really hot. A great combination of flavors!
