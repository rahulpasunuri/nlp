Was it the cardamom? Saffron? I didn't like this at all. Even the aroma was unappealing (although it did look pretty).

This was ok and I would make again.

Very tasty and quick. I substituted the pinenuts with sliced almonds, and it was great. Be liberal with the raisins and cardamom if your like me at all - a little more kick and texture.

Nice, good side dish. I'd cut the fat by roasting the pine nuts in a 350 degree oven for 5 minutes, though.

This is my standard accompaniment for any Indian dish I make. The pine nuts are a must. Be careful not to let them burn. I don't like raisins but I might have to try that sometime. I'm also not a fan of the cardamom.

LOVED IT! This was soooo easy, and so flavorful, it's definitely going into the general rotation. For inexplicable reasons, I have terrible luck making rice on the stove, so I use a rice cooker exclusively. This dish came out perfectly, and in the rice cooker I just had to set it up, then I could ignore it until it was time to serve dinner. Basically, I used the recipie exactly as stated here, except before I started the cooker, I sauted the onion in a small amount of olive oil in a pan, then added it to the rest of the ingredient in the rice cooker. I then added about 1.5 to 2 tsp melted butter to the cooker, stirred well, put the lid on, pressed go and walked away. Right before serving I added the toasted pine nuts. So delicious and so easy!

Delicious accompaniment to my stew.

The flavors and colors of this dish are wonderful. I wouldn't hesitate to make it again, but my first attempt at making didn't give stratospheric results. With some tweaking, I sense that it could be great.

My daughter, the finicky eater, loved this recipe!

I liked this dish a lot. I made the mistake of using unsalted butter and a bit more than the recipe called for. Next time I'll use salted and not one bit more than the 3 T. called for. I added less saffron and more cardomom (as suggested by other reviewers) and the flavor was very good. The pine nuts really "make" the recipe.

Very easy, elegant dish. Simple to prepare while finishing up the other elements of a dinner party. Would also work well during any season.

Excellent. We served this with Spicy Lamb Stew with Apricots and Cardamom from this site, and it went brilliantly together. It looks great too. My husband absolutely loved the pine nuts--as did I. Only complaint is that the saffron was a wee bit strong, would cut back, but only very slightly. I did cut back on the salt; even to my salt-aholic taste buds, it seemed like a lot. The amount of cardamom was fine (I might even up that ever so slightly). I'm going to try the same combo with couscous to serve with the Lamb Stew next time.

My husband loved this, but found the pine nuts a distraction. I think the nuts are pleasant, but it'd be good without them. The only change I made was to soak the saffron in a tablespoon of white wine while preparing the rice ingredients.

This was wonderful and I didn't change a thing! I served it with Red Pepper Herbes Soup and Mushroom Stuffed Pork Tenderloin (all recipes on this site). I highly recommend it!

I make this all the time and it is always well received. However I use craisins and toasted slivered almonds instead (pine nut allergy.)

I was unimpressed. Had it with grilled Tandoori Chicken Ahmed from this site. We both agreed that this is a great waste of saffron for cooks in the U.S., where it's expensive. I regularly buy wonderful deep red saffron near the source, so had plenty and used extra. The saffron flavor was almost totally lost -- I believe it would be much better used in a Kesar Pilau. We also thought this rice was a bit too greasy and would cut back on the butter, perhaps to just 1 tsp. in the second stage. Agree with reviews that the distinctive pine nut flavor and aroma were just the right intensity.

Just came out perfect!

I liked this recipe but I made two modifications that might actually disqualify it as "the recipe". I didn't have red onion, so I used regular white onion. And I didn't have Pine Nuts so I used red pistachios (about 3 tblsp.) The pistachio gane the rice a nice pink color and in that regard it overpowered the color of the saffron. Nevertheless, it turned out beyond my expectations. And out guests loved it too.

The seasonings don't overpower the wonderful nutty flavor of the basmati rice. I found it to be delicate and understated. No problems with the basmati rice consistency if you wash and drain rice beforehand.

I loved this rice! The pine nuts really make it unique, and the golden raisins add a subtle sweetness. My daughter, who doesn't like raisins, didn't even recognize that's what she was eating. I highly recommend this receipe for everyone except those who dislike cardamom, since it has such a strong flavor. I might even use less cardamom next time I make it. (p.s.-I also always rinse basmati rice).

Wonderful flavour. To 'Colleen in ON', most basmati recipes call for thoroughly washing the uncooked rice in warm water (until water is clear) to reduce the excess starch. I did and had no consistency problems. Accompanied pork tenderloin with balsamic-cranberry sauce (also on this site) for a great meal and no leftovers!

Great taste but poor consistency. My only suggestion for improvement would be to precook the rice until about 3/4 done, rinse out starch in colander and return to recipe (I was a little disappointed with the consistency).

I replaced the raisins with peas and carrots--my husband loved it! I might try less salt next time though..

Very moist with a slightly sweet "glow". I couldn't find pine nuts, so I substituted finely chopped walnuts. I was also out of saffron, but I think the flavor was fine without it. Served with the Spring Lamb Stew, I can tell you I had no leftovers!
