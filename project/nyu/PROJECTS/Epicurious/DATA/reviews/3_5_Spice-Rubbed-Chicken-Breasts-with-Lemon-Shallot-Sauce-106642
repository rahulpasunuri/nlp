I started preparing this recipe, only to find I was out of allspice! I looked through what I had on hand and decided to trying substituting cardomom. It is a wonderful substitute. I used vegetable broth because I already had some open and left out the wine. I think it would have been better with the wine. I will make this again, next time trying the allspice.

This was...weird. An unusual combination of flavors. My husband really liked it, but I thought that the flavors were odd together. However, I will make it again. Be careful not to overdue the lemon.

Yum! The fresh thyme was key. Like others I doubled the sauce and made sure to let it cook down. We all loved it!

Surprisingly delicious. Changed the quantities because used 1/2 the amount of chicken. Chicken was quite moist (used large organic boneless breasts). Would definitely make again.

A winner - we'll do this one again. I cooked the chicken a bit longer, used extra allspice in the rub and covered it so it would cook through. The chicken was incredibly tender but beautifully browned. I omitted the lemon peel, and, unlike other reviewers, I did not find it very lemony at all. I think the lemon balanced out the allspice, but it was very subtle. Make sure you completely reduce the sauce, that also makes a difference. Added parsley to the sauce at the very end.

Just made this dish and everyone loved it. I thought it was very flavorful, balanced and not very lemony. If you follow the recipe and cook the sauce down the lemon flavor is muted. I did follow the recommendation of another reviewer and cooked the shallots. I placed the cut chicken back in the sauce and served. Omitted parsley and was still delicious. Whole family wanted me to keep recipe so I could make again.

Absolutely delicious. My family thought it was a keeper. Very easy to make and fast. Lemon was a bit overpowering. I added a tablespoon of sour cream to it to take off some of the edge which worked well. Definitely will make again but will cut back on the lemon.

Rating: 3
Not bad! I did not find it to be too lemony when the sauce was on the chicken, but I did add a bit more pepper to flavor which really helped balance it out. My boyfriend is a horridly picky eater and loved it. It's a pretty simple dish, not overwhelmingly complex in flavor, but tasty and quick and easy to prepare!

Rating: 1
Yuck. Perhaps unfair because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. But this was awful...and boring. The lemon overwhelmed the wine and stock (the change I made was less lemon!). Also, the allspice did not combine well with the lemon, wine, and stock. Would not recommend this dish! Lack of balance.

Rating: 3
Definitely a "clean your plate" kind of dish. I added lemon zest along with the parsley as a garnish, and it added a nice additional note of flavor. The sauce was great - I'd recommend making a little more than the recipe calls for to ensure there is enough to slather, not just drizzle. This dish is a keeper.

Yum. We had this along with the butter browned winter greens and roasted yams from this website, and it was a wonderful addition to the menu as well as perfect in the combination. We extended the cook time for the chicken by finishing in the oven. We had not read the reviews in advance, or we would most certainly have doubled the sauce (which, now that i think about it, is a good move for most recipes.)

Rating: 2
After trying this, I actually found it a bit bland. The lemon was a nice touch actually, but it lacked something balancing it. Perhaps more pepper would have balanced the other flavors in this dish, but it might be difficult to not overpower it.

I worry when my review is so polar opposite to the majority. I wasn't sure about the allspice in this recipe but wanted to try based on the great reviews. I really didn't like this, not because of the allspice but because of the lemon. I love all things lemon but this was too much. I even used 1 tbsp less than what was called for. Big disappointment considering the effort.

Rating: 3
We really enjoyed the flavor of this dish, but Im not sure how the chicken is supposed to cook through in the amount of time listed in the recipe. I made a full amount of the sauce for only 1/2 the chicken and accidentally mixed in all of the allspice w/ the salt and pepper instead of only a 1/2 teaspoon, and it still turned out fantastic. I had to cook the chicken w/ the sauce w/ the lid on to get the chicken cooked through (also sautéed the shallots as mentioned in other reviews). Will probably follow the review from A Cook next time for cooking instructions. Flavor was excellent though and went well with white rice and some white corn and cherry tomatoes on the side.

Simple and fantastic - my 8 and 7 year old sons inhaled it - per other reviewers I doubled the sauce and sauted the shallots in it - terrifc and quick this is a keeper

Rating: 3
Made this tonight almost exactly as indicated, but sautéed the shallots in 1 tbsp. olive oil for 1 minute after removing chicken breasts and before adding the wine. I then reduced the final 6 tbsp. of olive oil to only 4 tbsp. and added 1 tbsp. butter. Everyone raved. I didn't give it four forks only because I agree with the reviewer who thought the raw shallots would be better lightly cooked.

Rating: 3
I collected this recipe a while back but didn't try it out until last night. Absolutely delicious and quite simple. I also found the sauce to be about right for four breast halves but other than that it was perfect. I didn't measure the shallots and suspect I had "too many" but even my picky husband loved this dish.

Too lemony for me.

This recipe was fabulous. I cut it in half and my 8 year old son inhaled it. In fact, I was suspicious that our Golden Retriever, aka The Goat, may have helped in the consumption, but there was some sauce left on the plate and The Goat would never leave a drop. It was quick, easy and delicious...what's not to like?

To be honest, I didn't like the sauce to much. It is very tangy. My husband who doesn't like anything "new" ate the chicken without the sauce though. I probably won't make this again

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. Albeit, I did make a couple of changes based on what I had on-hand. I subbed garlic for the shallots, per another reviewer and used dried thyme as I had no fresh. But otherwise I stayed true to the recipe. It was delish, my husband agrees. Served it over rice, which the sauce flavored nicely. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
This turned out to be SO good! I just used 4 chicken breasts, but still kept the same amount of everything else. If I had used 8 breasts, there would not have been enough sauce. A really tasty variation is with lime juice/zest instead of lemon and 2 or 3 teaspoons of fresh minced garlic instead of shallots. Oh, so good! So much better than anything at a resturaunt. This is my new favorite, and it was fairly easy to make. This will be a regular at my house!

I love this recipe. I was recently put on a reduced sodium diet, and I cut out the salt and slightly increased the pepper and allspice. It still came out with a great taste. This is being added to my dinner party fare - I'm sure it will be a hit with all.

We enjoyed the intense flavor this recipe lends to skinless chicken breast. I am always looking for new ways to cook healthy quick meals during the week, and this recipe definitely delivers. It was also great the next day for lunch on top of greens.

I read the reviews of this recipe before trying. Congratulations to the person who made it for 80! It's delicious...I made a few changes: 1. The chick. breasts I had were huge and thick, so cut them into two and beat them lightly between plastic wrap. 2. Needed twice the amount of rub recommended in the recipe. 3. Store's fresh thyme was "sad" so I used dried - works perfectly. 4. Even beaten chicken takes more than 4 mins a side to cook thoroughly (Salmonella....yikes!) 5. Didn't much care for uncooked shallots, so cooked them AND the thyme together for about 5 mins so they gave up their flavor and aroma. 6. HATE olive oil - used grapeseed oil, only 1 tbsp needed. Also, unlike OOil it doesn't overtake the taste of everything else, and is as good, if not better, for us. 7. Thickened up the sauce with butter. Results - absolutely delicious. Gave 3 rather than 4 forks because originators of the recipe might have addressed these points. But would most definitely repeat. Loved the intense lemon flavor.

I was intrigued by very positive reviews and very negative reviews for the same recipe. We thought this was just delicious and my husband was especially complimentary. Quick and easy. I discovered that I was out of fresh lemons so I used bottled lemon juice and some capers to replace the zest. I think I'll keep that subsitution IN. It was wonderful.

This was absolutely incredible! The chicken was moist and superbly flavored. I used marsala instead of the wine and it added great flavor. I also put the chicken back in the sauce right before serving. A new favorite!

I made this last night and my husband and I loved it! The lemony sauce was so flavorful. The only changes I made were in using one nonstick skillet, dried thyme and no parsely. It's definitely a keeper. I made with wild rice and asparagus.

This is a great favorite with my daughters. Interesting flavors, tender and juicy and so easy! I use a single large non-non-stick skillet so there are lots of "bits" to scoop up once the chicken has been cooked - but not so thoroughly cooked that it is completely done. Slice the chicken and throw everything back together again in the skillet at the end to finish off the cooking. Easier though maybe not as attractive. Great recipe!

I was worried about this recipe when I read some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken had a wonderful flavor and the sauce was EXCELLENT! I would have to say that the flavors are soft and subtle and very well balanced. My guests were quite impressed and asked me to make this recipe again! (I did not give it four forks becaused it lacked the elegant presentation, but the flavor was definetly four forks!)

THE SAUCE WAS GOOD, THO' I DIDN'T ADD ALL OF THE OIL AT THE END. THE CHICKEN WAS JUST NOT VERY TASTY; SO I WILL NOT TRY IT AGAIN

I made the recipe as stated, and found it simply so-so, not worth the effort. One reviewer suggested briefly sauteeing the shallots before adding the wine, and I think that would be an improvement. The flavors in this dish just didn't seem to come together properly.

Very nice dish for a weekday meal. Served with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli, it turned out to be easy, flavorful and no effort at all just as the recipe is written. Lemony, but we love that flavor. A bonus is that this can be whipped up with ingredients many have right in the fridge anyway.

A nice spring recipe that's easy to do. It goes well with the pilaf.

This dish was delicious. I was surprised to see negative reviews for this one, but that just goes to show that tastes vary. I deviated only slightly from the recipe...I had no wine so I used more chicken broth, used dried thyme and forgot to add the parsley. My husband and I enjoyed this so much. I served it with pre-packaged rice mix (Shitake Mushroom flavor) and sauted yellow and green squash in butter & garlic. Will make again.

Rating: 2
Not fantastic, but a nicely different way to do simple and quick chicken breasts with very little prep. I don't however, understand the recipe calling for olive oil for the sauce; butter thickened it beautifully. And I added the shallots to the pan drippings for a few seconds before deglazing with the wine; I think it gives it more depth than just boiling them.

Boring, nothing special about this one.

This was a great dish! Easy to prepare, too. My husband and I both really liked it, even the two teenagers I served it to liked it! I did use a tip from an earlier reviewer and added a bit of flour to the rub mixture, I hate it when a sauce doesn't thicken so I didn't want to take a chance. Also, I cut the chicken breasts lengthwise in half, the rub is more effective and they cook faster without getting dry inside. I do this with all my skinless boneless recipes and it makes a big difference, try it. It is especially easy to do if the breast are slightly frozen and firm.

Rating: 4
This dish was absolutely fantastic! I loved it so much; but i would make a few suggestions. Perhaps at the end of making the chicken and when your beging to make the sauce I didn't add more olive oil, I added butter so the sauce can thicken faster. A good thing to have when you make this meal is fresh thyme from a garden it just as much more zest than the one from the grocery store. And my last suggestion I would add is that not to add parsely because, you don't want it to over power the dish. Thanks!

Another great recipe. The breasts I used were quite thick so I added a lid and cooked an extra few minutes. I used the olive oil as instructed in the recipe. It adds richness and smoothness to the sauce. Plan to make this one often.. Yum...

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I added a little flour to the spice rub to create a coating on the chicken and thicken the sauce. I also did not add all the required oil at the end. I will definitely make it again!

I made this tonight and although I made a few changes to the original recipe, I give it 3 forks. I decided to use both thighs and breasts, and I opted not to use the oil at the end of the preparation. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the sauce held it's own against the lightly seasoned white rice. All in all, I think this is rather yummy and very easy to prepare. I will be making this again.

I just finished making this for 3 friends and they loved it. The dish was divine. I am salivating at the thought of cooking it again. I would recommend browning it in a pan, then tranferring to a 450 oven for about 5- 8 minutes, lightly covered with aluminum, first dry, then I added the sauce and let the chicken baste in it for 10 minutes more. I skipped the last 6 tablespoons of oil and the dish was fine without it. This matched well with a whole wheat pasta and a salad of pear, carmelized pecans and gorgonzola.

Delicious with some changes: Split whole, brined chicken in half. Rubbed chicken with spice over/under skin. Panfried in skillet for 8 minutes, skin side down, transfer to 500 oven for 32 minutes. Deglazed with wine, added shallots, reduced by half, then added broth/zest mixture. Used only 1 TBS lemon juice, 2 TBS oil and added 1 TBS butter at the end. Served with haricot vert and rice for a great weekenight meal. Thanks for all the previous reviewer suggestions!

WOW, this is outstanding! Made it again last night and absolutely loved it. If you are looking for "heat", don't make this. This is a simple paring of allspice, lemon, and thyme that has a wonderful result. Do take advise of other reviewers and don't add all that oil at the end of the sauce, it just doesn't need it. Really enjoyed this one ... from the reviews it is pretty well split, but worth the risk!

Rating: 2
After reading the reviews I was expecting a big flavourful spicey taste but was disappointed - very nice and lemony but I didn't find it very spicey at all. I was suprised by the small amounts of allspice called for in the recipe. I'd be inclined to increase it to get more kick. While adding more broth (rather than oil) may be more healthful, I liked the sauce very much just as is.

Rating: 2
Just made this tonight, and it's not worth it in my opinion. The chicken was oddly spicy, and I must agree with whomever said they might as well as have poured lemon juice on it. It was good lemon juice... but still just lemon juice. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers to decrease the salt and oil and increase the broth and wine. I made this for my parents, and my dad really enjoyed it. He said it was worth making again, but he's a big lemon fan. I think it wasn't worth the effort or time. The one good thing about it was how juicy the chicken was after being sauteed. My one recommendation is to serve the chicken along side cherry or grape tomatoes, as the picture shows. They were a wonderful compliment to the dish. If I were to make this again, I would serve it on top of rice or pasta covered in olive oil and garlic.

Simple, straight forward and very good. I finished the sauce with a little cold butter - off the heat. I backed off the lemon a bit the second time I made this dish. The first was a bit too piquant for my taste.

I wanted to try something different for entertaining, and this recipe definitely stepped up my normal chicken! There was a bit of work involved, but the sauce was right on (I followed suggestions to reduce salt, and added a bit more wine...). My guests loved it and I will definitely make this again!

I didn't find this much work at all. The flavor of the allspice was very good and a change from the usual recipe. I do think it was a bit salty, and will reduce that next time. Will be a new addition to the weekday dinner list.

This dish definitely needs low salt broth or it is too salty. I will omit the additional olive oil in the sauce and substitute a little more wine the next time.

I have to agree with the minority - not worth the effort. In the name it says spiced-rubbed but it only has salt, pepper, and allspice. You could definitely taste the pepper! I halved the sauce for 2 chicken breasts and the 1/4 cup was hardly worth the effort or the ingredients. What was I thinking? I'm usually a better judge of recipes.

Rating: 3
Great recipe! A delicious combination of flavors. Yes, it's a bit of work, but the result is not your every-day chicken. I inadvertently made a slight modification on the sauce, which may be the secret to keeping it from being too lemony: if you use more stock (I used 1/2 can -- rather than cup -- for 1/2 recipe) and boil it down as directed, the result is positively yummy. I also reduced the amount of oil in the sauce, as suggested below, and it still tasted great. The only thing I'd do differently next time is make the full amount of sauce for the half recipe, in order to have enough extra for the leftover pasta!

I made this for my mother for dinner tonight and we both really enjoyed it. I used one breast cut in half and halved the sauce. It turned out great, I added very little oil to the sauce at the end, next time I would probably just omit it completely.

I rarely give 4 forks but this was really special. Served it with "Mashed potatoes with lemon-thyme butter" - a fantastic combination. The sauce is spectacular - I did not find it too lemony at all. I did make sure to cook the liquid down considerably - perhaps that makes a difference. Made a beautiful presentation - should have made a few more chicken breasts - everyone wanted more.

The chicken was great on it's own and it's a good thing too. The sauce was a waste of time for the taste. You could have just as easily heated up some lemon juice on the side. That is exactly what it tasted like. I should have really listened to the reviews. Somehow with all the ingredients in that sauce, you don't expect it to taste like you are sucking on a lemon. I will make the chicken again, but not the sauce. Does anyone know of a good sauce to substitute?
