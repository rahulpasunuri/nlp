Yum - this was great. My white asparagus where pretty thin so they took the directed 10 minutes. I didn't feel like searching for canned truffle so i added 1/2 TB truffle oil and reduced the hazelnut oil to a little less than 4 TB. Will definitely make this again - especially when i see nice white asparagus

Easy and elegant side to any meal. I did not have to peel the white asparagus too much at all (I think because they are young and in season). I would definitely give this about 15 minutes to marinade before serving, as the asparagus is such a delicate flavor. I did use a jarred truffle from Italy, and it really adds something special. Next time I think I would use black truffle oil. I also did use the walnut oil and that gave it a nice roundness.

A very simple and elegant way to serve white asparagus. I steamed my peeled white asparagus for about 12 minutes and was very happy.

Great way to prepare white asparagus (which is abundant in Germany in spring)! Very elegant, and easy to make. If you use white asparagus, it is necessary to peel them throughly (whole asparagus except heads).

Good for a change in pace; made as written but used truffled balsamic vinegar (in addition to the bottled truffle) because I didn't have any sherry vinegar. Definitely peel the white asparagus.

Spring is Spargel (white asparagus) season in Germany and this was the prefect way to surprise friends, who expect the heavy Sauce Hollandaise. A delicious alternative! I used white wine vinegar, a touch of sherry and the truffle juice and served with thin-sliced boiled ham, a variation of the German norm. Everyone was impressed and we will serve it regularly! Esp. tasty with a crisp German white wine (Riesling, Savignon Blanc) from the Rhine region.

I made this for one a client I private chef for, making the dressing with truffle oil and balsamic vinegar, also using hazelnut oil. Additionally, I used green asparagus, plated it on a square platter with the tops facing in two opposite directions. Where the bottoms met, I covered that with sliced hearts of palm, and garnished with lemon twists...drizzled the dressing over about 45 minutes before serving to marinate...my clients LOVED it!! In fact, they are having me make this as one of the dishes for a brunch they are having this weekend for some dignitaries of the UN!!!....a sure hit with either white or green asparagus!!

I made it with the white asparagus and truffle oil instead of the chicken stock. I steamed the asparagus for 17 min. It was fabulous.

I don't think canned truffles are worth it. I would use H qual truffle oil instead. White asparagus is normally stringy and needs to be seriously peeled at the bottom. More than you think.

I didn't make the recipe. I do have some tips for people. Use a carrot peeler to peel the asparagus. Works well on green asparagus too. You do need to over-cook by today's raw vegetable standards. Think canned beans, canned artichokes, canned anything. Did use my own sherry vinegar dressing with some truffle oil added to it.

Even though I peeled the white asparagus, it was still tough...I would steam longer next time. I usually like my green asparagus crisp...but, never again for the white! On short notice, didn't get/find truffels, used Shiitakes. Loved the vinegarette...quite tasty. Served with the pepper marinated New York strip.

Couldn't find the bottled truffles so I skipped them and the recipe still turned out. I did use black truffle oil. I also marinated the asparagus in the sherry vinegar for an hour before cooking which added to the taste.

I would use only green asparagus; the white I can buy are virtually tasteless. I would sprinklge the truffle on the asparagus, rather than mix them into the dressing, so that you can distribute them evenly among the plates.

I'd make this again, but only with green asparagus. The asparagus package emphasized that you must peel it because of the bitterness of the peel. Because the peel and the flesh underneath it are both white, it's quite difficult to see just what you've accomplished. I generally peel green asparagus, although it's not strictly necessary, and it's much easier to see what you've done as the color is more vibrant. It's not easy to get truffles here on the West Coast of Florida, so I used about one-third white truffle oil to two parts walnut oil. The scent of the sauce was stunning, and actually made me dizzy! By the way, for this particular dressing, it's much easier to get a proper emulsion by shaking it vigorously in a jar rather than using a whisk.

Excellent and easy. While truffles aren't cheap (certainly not in NYC!) they add a "specialness" that makes the asparagus great. I used pencil green spears and it turned out terrific. I also used a bottled Black Truffle oil to give added richness to the vinaigrette. I'm not a big "garnish" person, but the bitterness of the chervil on the side was a nice touch.

I din't have a truffle so I made the dressing with white truffle oil, lemon juice, basalmic vinegar and salt. I shocked the steamed asparagus, put it on plates, poured the vinaigrette over and chilled for 10 minutes. It made a wonderful cool "salad" with grilled rib-eyes. There was vinaigrette left over so I drank it, it was so good!

This is tasty enough, but its real appeal lies in the presentation. I used a canned truffle bought in Perigord that had lost some flavor over the years, so I perked it up with a bit of truffle oil. No one was the wiser. To Lisa - yes, peel top to bottom but leave the tips (the last 1/2 inch or so) intact. White asparagus is thin and brittle, so lay it flat on the cutting board while running the peeler over it.

To Lisa fron New Jersey: It is best to buy young (small) asparagus because they will be tender and you don't have to peel anything off. As asparagus mature, they tend to get tough. What works for me is to simply cut off the tips (usually about 4-5 inches worth) and just use those. The tough part that is left over can be made into asparagus soup: just simmer until tender in chicken broth, add some cream, salt, and pepper near the end, puree it in a blender or processor, and voila! Serve it w/some crusty french bread and you've got a tasty, quick supper. Hope this helps- good luck!

I want to try this recipe but have a question? Do you peel these asparagus from top to bottom? In the past they seem quite tough where I didn't peel them. thanks! - Lisa

This recipe was great its also very decadent, i altered the idea slightly by also adding orange twists on top as a garnish-which blends well with the lemon already in the sauce, and instead of sherry i used balsamic vinegar. i have used both and either one is fabulous! it just depends on your taste :)
