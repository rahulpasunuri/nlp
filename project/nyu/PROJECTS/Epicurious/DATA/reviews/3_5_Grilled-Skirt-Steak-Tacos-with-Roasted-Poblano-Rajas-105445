Made this fajita-style (served all mixed together and with flour tortillas and toppings) for a Cinco de Mayo party. It was a total hit! And no one could believe I did it with skirt steak. This marinade really tenderizes the meat and it cooks up so juicy and easy to chew through in a tortilla. I hesitate to try anything else for fajita night.

Did not make this recipe because it is incomplete. Where is the part for the "Roasted Poblano Rajas"???

I loved the flavors of the marinated skirt steak with the roasted poblano peppers and onions. I would definitely make this again.

Just an additional - I have the cookbook, which describes broiling the steak and poblano/onion mixture. This was a great winter alternative to the grill.

Easy and quick recipe - needed more salt at the end, so just sprinkled a little once the steak was broiled. Added a jalapeno to the marinade salsa.

Very GOOD and full of flavor. We made it with London broil could not find skirt steak at the store. The marinade made it super tender! The flavor was great.

Simple, flavorful marinade. I also use a higher cut of beef than skirt.

I haven't made this yet - but I'm going to try it this weekend. Since it was missing the information on the rajas, I googled it. This is what I found: 3 medium (about 9 ounces total) fresh poblano chiles Rub the blacked skin off the chiles, then pull out the stems and seed pods. Rinse briefly to remove any stray seeds and bits of skin. Slice into 1/4-inch strips and stir into the onions. Taste the mixture and season it with salt, usually about 1/4 teaspoon. Keep warm in the oven.

I'd love to try this recipe, but the amount or weight of chiles is not listed in the ingredients, nor how they are "added to the onion." I assume you just slice & toss, but can anyone shed light on this for me? Feel free to email me directly. Thanks!

Actually, I did'nt try the recipe, but with a quick review, why go with skirt steak?? The re-newed flat iron steak would be better, cheaper and much more flavorful and tender..It requires a bit of trimming but if you do not mind trimming meat, this cut goes a long way

Taste great!! grilled poblanos & onions gives a nice flavor. I would do it again....

this was easy but too bland. If I made it again would add jalapeno peppers to the marinade and the the zip level way up.

I don't know nuthin' 'bout poblano rajas (nor would my husband eat one I'm sure), so I adapted this for our "americanized" mexican tastes. I followed the meat marinating instructions, but used round steak, then sirloin (both were vg, less expensive, and easier to find). I heat my grill pan in the oven to 425 and "grill" red/green pepper and onion slices til soft then cover a dish with foil and put on oven rack. Then, crank oven to 475, wrap flour tortillas in foil w/oil between and put them in too. When the "grilled" steak is finished, rested, and sliced, I serve all with cheese on side. Prob. not authentic, but our version of "fajitas" - works for us white bread folks!

Sloppy recipe?? "This is a very common recipe in Mexico, almost too easy to claim to belong to anyone in particular".... Regardless, here in the 'States', not Arizona, the marinade on the skirt steak was unbelievably delicious. Left it on for about 4 hours. It left the skirt steak beautifully tender and flavorful! Absolutely the best skirt steak tacos, EVER!! Hats off to Rick Bayless!! I can't adequately express how wonderful that marinade was!!!

Having made a lot of rajas in my day..I'd say 6 really large or 10 small poblanos. Also, nothing is said about cutting the poblanos into "rajas" or even peeling them. SLOPPY recipe!!! Once the poblanos have steamed in the towel for about 20 minutes or so, peel them under running water and then seed and devein them. Cut into slender strips and serve with the tacos. This is a very common recipe in Mexico, almost too easy to claim to belong to anyone in particular. Shame that it was copied over so badly.

The recipe sounds great but the poblano chile part was left out of the ingredient section in the recipe. Can someone tell me how many chiles to use?
