Baker's Bittersweet chocolate is the original suggested chocolate, and I agree. It holds up, is both strong enough and has the perfect edge for the chocolate flavor to come through. Fancier, more expensive chocolate is a waste in this recipe. I have made this in individual souffle dishes for parties (catering them)and in a regular sized one for family dinners. Both turn out perfectly every time. Whipping up an orange liqueur flavored creme anglaise with the extra egg yolks is my preferred accompaniment. Perfection. Raspberries are good too.

This was my first souffle and it turned out excellent! I did add 2 TBSP Kahlua and 1 tsp vanilla extract with the egg yolks - some previous reviews said the flavor was bland or bitter. These additions boosted the flavor & sweetened it just a tad so it wasn't bitter. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet 60% Cacoa Premium Baking Bars chopped finely with a serrated knife and it melted quickly and smoothly. Baked 26 minutes. Rose well. It was very light and fluffy inside and crusty on outside edges. The first few bites seemed to melt in our mouths. Perfect size for 4 people. Will definitely make again.

I have made this twice now, have NEVER made a chocolate souffle of any type previously. The first time I used the exact amount of bittersweet chocolate and we found it to lack that chocolate punch we like. So the second time I used more like 7-8 ounces of bittersweet chocolate. It didn't raise as far as it did the first time but it still puffed up nicely. But we got the rich chocolate flavor we were wishing for! Nom Nom. I like the ease of this recipe. The second time I also sprinkled a little bit of Raw Sugar on the bottom after the regular white sugar. I separate the eggs and put them back in the refrig. I get out the metal bowls and sugar and mixer and line the ramekins so that I am all ready to mix and pour and bake after dinner. The trick is to remember to get those egg YOLKS out a little early so they get to room temperature. I baked it for 25 mins. We really love this treat!

We made this with supermarket milk chocolate because the teens cooking find dark chocolate too harsh. We had surprisingly good results, even at the hands of first-timers!

Made this exactly as directed except using six one cup individual ramekins. It was perfect, light, chocolatey and not too sweet. Rose perfectly and was a hit with everyone. Will definitely make again, a quick and easy yet visually impressive dessert, perfect for dinner parties!

This was easy & tasty, even though I used some marginal chocolate. Served with dark rum-spiked whipped cream. When I brought it to the table from the oven, there were many ooos & ahhs! The only thing I would change for next time is the sugar on the inside of the pan... I wasn't a fan (probably would prefer the cocoa recommended by another), but my mom loved the crunchies. I will definitely make again!

I doubled the recipe (because I had to feed 9)and made it in a straight sided oval dish, and it came out perfect. This is not hard. To make it so it will be ready for dessert, I put the chocolate in the top of a double boiler while we are eating, have the eggs already separated and in the bowl for beating, and the oven preheated. Then I just take a 3 minutes in the middle of dinner to put it all together and pop in the oven. Lots of homemade whip cream rounds out a real show stopper. BTW - the better the chocolate, the better the result.

I'm 14 and I made this for my dad's birthday and it turned out just how I thought a Souffle would! All I did was follow the instructions exactly and kept it in the oven for 24 minutes. Also I don't know if this helped or not, but make sure the bowl you whisk the eggs in VERY clean. And the eggs shouldn't move at all when you jiggle them... All in all, great and easy recipe that everyone LOVED!

Rating: 4
Excellent, and very simple to follow. I made one change - I used milk chocolate chips instead of bittersweet chocolate, and sprinkled the ramekins with chocolate powder instead of sugar. For those of you who have never made a souffle before, the mixture after folding is going to be a little watery, but it is ok. Also, keep in oven 23-25 min, and DO NOT OPEN IT!!! This is essential!! Bon appetit!

One day I wanted to make a chocolate souffle at home. Its a favorite I can't mess up. I've never had a souffle fall flat, I can bake this at friends houses, the ingredients list is so small I don't have to pull this page for instructions anymore.

Eh, it was definitely only "okay." The recipe was light and airy and rose well, though it sunk faster than most souffles (within 10 seconds of being removed from the oven). It was almost flavorless. I would not make again.

I MADE THIS 2 NIGHTS AGO AND WOW SOOOO GOOD!!!!! I LOVE COOKING BECAUSE IT RELAXES ME AFTER A HARD DAY OF WORKING A STRESSFUL JOB. SO I WANTED TO MAKE A SOUFFLE THAT REQUIRED THE LEAST AMOUNT OF INGREDIENTS AND WAS NOT HARD TO MAKE. I USED SEMI-SWEET CHOCOLATE INSTEAD OF BITTERSWEET. MY MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE MY GUINEA PIGS AND THEY LOVED IT. MY MOTHER HAD TWO. THE SOUFFLE WAS VERY LIGHT AND NOT TOO SWEET. THIS RECIPE IS SO SIMPLE. I MUST SAY, I SURPRISED MYSELF WITH THIS ONE. I SAVED SOME OF THE MIXTURE FOR THE NEXT DAY AND MY BROTHER SAID THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN TASTE OR TEXTURE. I ALSO MADE MY OWN BLACKBERRY SAUCE. I WILL BE MAKING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. THANKS EPICURIOUS. ONE THING THOUGH, CAN ANYONE TELL ME HOW TO MAKE THE CHOCOLATE SPILL OUT THE CENTER OF SOUFFLE AND SHOULD I BE USING DARK CHOCOLATE TO GET THAT REALLY DARK CHOCOLATE COLOR?

Rating: 4
Let me preface this with saying that this was the first Soufflé' recipe I've ever attempted.. I picked this particular recipe because of the minimal ingredient list and I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate bits for the recipe.. Having a stand mixer is pretty much a given and the end result is really incredible.. Instead of the lightly sweetened whipped cream however, while the souffle was baking, I melted down some bakers white chocolate, added some heavy whipping cream, a touch of good vanilla and some bourbon whiskey to make a white chocolate cream sauce.. the yield is closer to 4 people than 2 and trust me when I say we ate a "LOT" of this with 3 people and still couldn't finish it all.. 10 thumbs up for simplicity and taste..

Rating: 1
Just awful. It came out tasting like bitter eggs. It didn't poof up enough which could be the size pan I used but there was no information on what size would work. The instructions were vague and there are so many better recipes on this site I would never settle again for this one.

Rating: 3
It turned out a bit bitter for my taste, so I would recommend adding a bit of cream or sugar or using sweeter chocolate. Otherwise, it had a good texture, was not difficult to prepare, and though it didn't puff up quite as much as I expected (I used a wide, rather shallow dish- maybe that's why?) it looked great in the souffle dish.

well, i forgot the vanilla and did them in individual dishes. after ten minutes they looked just like mousse, so i gave them 15. they were still a little pretty much mostly moussey after 15, although they were a more solid consistency on the bottom edges. i also added a few leftover chocolate chips on the bottom but it was just too much - too sweet and too chocolatey. next time i'll proceed as before, add some vanilla, leave out the chips on the bottom, and possibly leave them in there for more than 15 mins. this was my first time making this and neither my husband nor i knew what the souffles should've tasted like, but we both liked them :)

I made this for a dinner party so I served it in 6oz ramekins. (1X the recipe makes 6 servings) I added a little vanilla extract to the recipe. I also took one reviewers advice to make the center more like a molten chocolate cake. Instead of a chocolate piece in the center though, I used ganash because I had some on hand. On the test run, I made the batter a half hour in advance and it held without falling, but I was very careful not to jostle the container too much. I found that baking in a 375F oven for 15 minutes (6oz ramekins) produced a grainy texture so I baked them for 10 minutes and they were much better. When I made them for the event, I held the batter for about two hours at room temp. I had to bake them for much longer, probably 20 minutes. But, I actually liked them better because they were softer and creamier instead of grainy. I served them with some sweetened vanilla mascarpone and cocoa nibs. The guests raved about them!

Yum. Super easy and very good. I halved the recipe, cooked in small dishes (reduced cooking time) and had no problems.

Made this in about 15 minutes while dinner was cooking, at the suggestion of my kids. They really liked it. Didn't have bittersweet chocolate so I used semisweet and left out the sugar in the recipe. Still came out a bit sweet -- bittersweet would have been better.

I had some difficulty incorporating the chocolate - egg yolk mixture into the whipped egg whites. Next time I would add yolks more slowly to chocolate mix and stop when an acceptable texture is achieved instead of adding them all at once. Still it was very good.

We followed the recipe, however, may have cooked it too long. Do not bake past 24 minutes.....may have changed the consistency for us. All in all, great taste, chocolately, but DEFINITELY needed vanilla ice cream either on top as others stated, or on side to compliment. Great first time souffle recipe for the beginner apprehensive about making a souffle.

This recipe was amazing! Perfect for a beginner baker. I'm a teenager and obsessed with baking, so when I saw this I just *had* to make it.. And I assure you it came out just as wonderful as it looked like it would!

I thought this souffle was delicious, and even kept in the fridge overnight. The day-after consistency was that of a rich chocolate mousse. However, my only issue was that the center was a bit runny when it came out of the oven. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be like that-- still tasted good, but had the consistency of a molten chocolate cake. I also had some difficulty mixing the chocolate in with the meringue-- maybe that's why it didn't rise as well as it should've.

As per everyone's comments, this was really good and really quick. It got really puffy in the oven and then deflated quickly, but that's o.k. because you're eating it so quickly! It wasn't bland, very chocolaty, but didn't have that 'pop' that a souffle ususally has. But, it's a keeper!

Truly an easy and impressive dish. I screwed up... I think I had too much chocolate and it wouldn't fold into the egg whites. What a disaster on Valentine's day. I cooked it anyway in individual ramekins (20 min) and it was yummy! I recommend adding chocolate sauce (I got the recipe from this site) along with the whipped cream--it makes for a little more intense chocolate taste. Fabulous!

To enhance flavor: Add 1/4 tsp salt to eggwhites before beating. Add 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract while folding mixture. This will guarantee a delicious souffle.

I've tried the recipe last Friday and over baked it due to metri conversion but the souffle rose beautifully. Tried it again today with an oven heated to 160 degrees celsius and for twenty minutes.

From French friends who taught me to make souffles, I learned that one uses a large spoon and large fork back to back plunged down the middle of the souffle. Then you can serve it with some crust and some soft filling OR add creme anglaise or other sauce.

this is more of a question than a review: how do you serve it? i've never had it before, so i don't know. do you scoop some out, are you able to slice it? i made it once and it fell, but i still couldn't see how you might serve it. thanks

my first shot at a souffle too, with fine success. i was a little worried at high altitude (7400 ft), but got a nice light puff, and no noticeable collapse. (served immediately to reduce chance) top had a little bit of a crust, but seemed a nice contrast to soft insides. suprisingly simple too. for easiest meal on earth, make this for dessert after beef with port balsamic sauce, and be a hero!

I forgot to add sugar while beating the egg whites. I think that's what cause my souffle to deflate once out of the oven. But still it was sweet enough with the chocolate (which by the way I just used milk chocolate chips). I made a ganach and pour it into the souffle when serving. Will try again with sugar to see how it turn out.

Hi there! This recipe was very good! A suggestion to the Fort Collins, Colorado person asking about high altitude...As an Innkeeper, we use High altitude Flour at our Inn so there are never a guess about what to add and what to leave out!

We loved this souffle! I used Trader Joe Pound Plus bittersweet chocolate. I agree with other reviewers that the recipe was fairly easy to prepare, tasted wonderful. I'd like to try it next time with a creme anglaise; maybe one spiked with eau-de-vie. (I am always looking for ways to use my hardly-touched raspberry eau-de-vie!). I'd like to hear from anyone who has a suggestion for a good accompaniment for this souffle (such as a whipped cream or a sauce).

This souffle has a good rich flavor and was very simple to make. I like the fact that this recipe didn't take a lot of chocolate or eggs to make. It also held well. I put it into the oven when we started eating and then turned the heat off 5 minutes before the end and put a wooden spoon in the door to keep it cracked open. The souffle stayed in the oven for another 15 - 20 minutes. It was still moist -- a little more cooked than it really should have been but it held its height and tasted delicious.

This was a scrumptious and surprisingly simple recipe!!! Made it for my husband on Valentine's Day, and we savored every bite...YUM! Instead of using a large souffle dish, used 4 individual ramekins and reduce baking time to 15-18 minutes. Also recommend not skimping and splurge on a high quality chocolate.
