Phyllo: I made cups with 4 layers of phyllo instead of 6. Tried 3 muffin sizes: 3 regular tins were best for a cup with enough capacity to hold mousse. 6 circles worked well. Mousse: we used 72% Valrhona bars from Trader Joe's and allowed to set up for 24 hours (made the night before). Resulted in a dense dark mousse in a light crispy cup, and served with sliced fresh strawberries. We have been in a quarterly dinner group for years, and eaters loved this; everyone finished every bite; one said it is the best dessert we've ever had.

Only made phyllo cups - were super easy, but looked so impressive. Next time i won't use as much if any sugar - they ended up too sweet for me.

I make these phyllo cups frequently when I have a dinner party because they can be done a day ahead. I fill them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzle with Epicurious' Dulce de Leche sauce. Excellent.

excellent!! Made it with flaky cups though. Phyllo was too much work I was short on time. Really good.

Fantastic dessert. Beautiful presentation. Just remember to put out a fork and spoon for your guests to eat!

time consuming, but worth the effort. Rich dark mousse... which my guests loved. I'm not even a big chocolate lover, but the combination of the mousse with the phyllo shell is perfect.

i know my chocolate and this is an amazing recipe. it's time consuming but fun to do with friends. my family loved them covered with slices of strawberries and raspberries.

I didn't like the texture of the mousse, I found it too dense and sticky, not the light and airy mousse I was looking for. My quests and I also found it too sweet...it needs to be lightened up, maybe some whipped cream folded in would do the trick, however I won't bother with this recipe again. The presention was nice but hard to eat.

THis is absolutely excellent. Out of laziness and lack of time, I used puff pastry shells instead of the phyllo, and then sprinkled some ground nuts in the bottom of the shells. I filled the shells with the unset mousse, and then after it was set, I put fresh raspberries from the garden on top, followed by a dollop of more chocolate mousse, followed by the shell 'cap'. I have never had people rave more about a dessert, and I am known for my desserts. This is great, and requires very little time for prep.

this recipe is Awesome! It came out beautifully and was extremely easy. I did modify it though. I added 1/2 a cup of raspberry puree to the melted chocolate, so in effect i had chocolate raspberry mousse, which was delicious.

This dessert was a big hit. Everyone liked the flavors and the presentation. For me, the rich mousse and the rich phyllo pastry together was too much. Next time I will make either the mousse or the pastry and pair it with something less rich. I should add that no one else at the table thought it was too rich.

Just a fabulous recipe and lots of visual impact if you put the time into it. We used a star fruit as garnish in the mousse and it looked and tasted amazing. Try this recipe out!

This is fairly light and easy, but still elegant/
