This was delicious, perhaps especially with the organic Cornish hen I used. Don't understand why only 50% of users would make it again. It was relatively quick and easy, and the flavors were surprisingly subtle.

I made this for Valentine's Day dinner also and i thought that this recipe was great. The outside was crispy and the inside was juicy and flavorful. Also used margarine instead of butter to make it kosher.

This was good, but not wonderful. The hens were delightfully crisp, but I didn't find that the olive butter flavor really penentrated the meat--it just sort of sat on top of the hen taste. There are much better cornish hen dishes on the website.

Made this for Valentine's Day and it was great!! The olive-caper-shallot butter was a perfect accompaniment to the game hen. I used more of the olive/caper part on the inside of the hen and less on the outside so it wasn't black. Also I let the hen rest before cutting into it - may have helped. But it tasted yummy! Am planning on making this again using chicken breasts or legs instead to see how it turns out.

Although the flavor of the black-olive butter was tasty, the appearance momentarily puzzled my guests. When cutting into them, blackened butter gushed out. Also, cornish hens are a bit fussy with knife and fork, best eaten with fingers.
