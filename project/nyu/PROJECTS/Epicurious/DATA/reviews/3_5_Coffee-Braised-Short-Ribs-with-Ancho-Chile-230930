I enjoyed making this dish, and the end product was exceptional. I found that the flavor was particularly complex and that the coffee added nice hints of earthiness.

BTW I used the flanken but only use about 3 - 3-1/2 lbs of the ribs with the entire amount of sauce.

I have made this recipe many times and followed it exactly as written. While it is cooling (before it is refrigerated) I skim as much of the liquid fat as I possibly can. Then I refrigerate for two days and remove the small amount of congealed fat left before reheating at 350. We think it is delicious and even the left overs get better and better.

Generally a good recipe but I would say to definitely cook it longer than the recipe indicates. I think this recipe is a great candidate for slow cooking all day in a crock pot. Also, I used regular chili powder instead of ancho, which I realize would have had more depth, but the regular chili powder did make it a bit spicier.

Savory, but I expected more from this. TIPS: SEARING is absolutely essential ... adds depth of flavor and diversity in texture. Have your MISE EN PLACE in place. The amount of time the garlic, sugar, chile, cumin and oregano spend in the pot is quite brief and you don't want to burn them. Like so many dishes, this benefited from SITTING FOR TWO DAYS, a day at least, after being made. I tasted it right after it was made and was totally unimpressed ... two days in the fridge covered made a huge difference, allowing a fat seal to come to the top and for the acid in the coffee to break down the tissue in the meat. It also allowed the sauce to thicken. MY ACTUAL EXPERIENCE: I used 4 pounds of ribs not 5. A better ratio I think. I accidentally added 2 TABLEspoons of oregano not teaspoons to no detrimental effect. I used fresh ground French roast ... trust me, dark roast coffee not a problem in this dish. I goofed and cooked it at 350 until I caught my mistake, with about 20 minutes to go. Again, no problems. OBSERVATIONS: Tough to pick out the components in the dish. Not terribly hot. Also lacking the brightness I expected to find as a result of the jalapeno. Perhaps the cilantro would have addressed that, but I had none (and am not a fan of it anyway). I didn't really taste the coffee, either. I might have added an additional small onion and perhaps an additional small pepper (for heat) SUMMATION: A nice dish easily made if prep work done properly. Flavors come together well but don't stand out individually. 2.5 stars out of four.

This was less spicy than I thought it would be but no matter...it was delicious. Do prepare it a day ahead. The excess fat will harden in the fridge, making removal a snap. I made no changes to list of ingredients. Served with mashed potatoes and veggies.

I disagree that more spices are needed. (And there are many things I like VERY spicy.) I think the taste has depth and complexity as is - some subtlety. Don't be afraid of the coffee; no one will ever know it was used. It is best to make a day ahead. Drain the liquid from the sauce, so the great quantity of fat can be removed easily the next day. Then, reduce the sauce and adjust seasoning before adding it to the meat and vegatables and re-heating.

I have to agree with the reviewer who said this recipe tastes like Mexican potroast. It was pretty disappointing. If you read the recipe critically, you will realize that the quantity of spices is meager for an ethnic dish. I tried to salvage this recipe by blending the sauce, adding more tomato paste, salt, and oregano and reducing it by more than half--but there was nothing that could be done for the beef. If I made this recipe again, I'd consider increasing the quantity of spices by almost 3X, omitting the red pepper, and adding a more flavorful chile instead. Better yet, I'd scrap the whole recipe and dry-rub and barbeque the beef before topping it with sauce. The coffee element (which is what intrigued me about this recipe) didn't add much, if anything, to the finished dish.

I ws worried that it would be too spicy, but it came out with immense flavor and taste. Would make again!

I used Chuck Steak in place of the short ribs, which turned out good. The sauce was wonderful, I agree the aroma was great.

Absolutely fabulous! I made a couple substitutions in the recipe (used maple syrup instead of brown sugar & strained tomatoes), and would definately recommend it. Everyone in my building wanted to know what that fabulous smell was coming from my apartment! This is a keeper.

This smelled wonderful while cooking. The sauce was great the depth of flavor was amazing. I was not thrilled w/the cut of meat, but everyone else loved it. Consider making a day ahead to skim the fat.

Made this for a late afternoon Sunday lunch and all the guests loved it! The only substitution I made was to have the butcher debone the flanken style short ribs. The house smelled great and all the flavors combined together beautifully. Definitely a dish the men will die over!

I made this recipe for dinner last night and I thought is tasted and smelled delicious. My husband could'nt stop sniffing the pot. Even our picky teenaged guest enjoyed it. The only substitution I made was using regular chile powder instead of the ancho chile(I used less that the recipe called for). All in all, a dish I will make again and again.

My friend made this recipe for me, and it was delicious. Spicy and just a touch sweet. I tried it myself, but used a pressure cooker to reduce time, but I overcooked it. I'm trying again tonight to replicate her results which had NO leftovers with only 3 diners!

I had high expectations for this recipe, given the ingredients. What I got, and I followed it to the letter, was a greasy, bland mexican pot roast(I did use the flanken ribs). You'd never guess, after tasting, that there are 2 cups of strong coffee in this meal. Disappointing.

Excellent dish, but if you want more heat, use the pith inside the jalapeno, along with the outside. Notwithstanding popular belief, the heat is in the pith, not the seeds or the skin. We paired this chili-like dish with a pear, pancetta, and walnut salad (Bon Appetit, Oct 2004) and a creamy polenta with parmesan (Bon Appetit, June, 2000) made a warming Sunday supper after watching football.
