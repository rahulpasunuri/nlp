This was truly an excellent dish and I plan on making it again. I made just a few changes: I used boneless chicken breast, which required less time on the grill. I also used ground cumin, as I didn't have cumin seeds. I used a little more lime than the recipe called for. For the couscous, I took other reviewers' suggestion to use toasted pine nuts and raisins. Delicious!

Excellent. Served this for Father's Day. My in-laws love Moroccan food and they loved it. Even asked for this recipe.

Excellent! Tasty, spicy but not hot. Used 1/2 of the red peppers.

This was a wonderful dish. A must make again.

I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and thighs, added more garlic to the harissa and chopped apricots with pistachios for the couscous. Made the grain nicely textural and tasty.

Very rich and full of different flavors. Made it for the first time for friends and it was a hit. I do recommend adding currants and toasted pine nuts to the couscous for more texture and flavor.

Horrible!!! The smell when cooking was turning my stomach. Couldn't eat it. Luckily my husband was willing to try it, otherwise it would have all been thrown away. He peeled off the skin before eating.

I made this for my parents on a football sunday. They raved about it and asked me to make it for a friend- and my parents can be picky. It is a bit of work, but well worth it.

Great recipe. Can be labor intensive, so if you don't have the time just go for pre ground spices... the only thing I ground myself was the caraway. I marinated the chicken for only an hour, we were very rushed! It made no difference, however, that I could tell. The meat was fabulous, the flavors were very exciting, I highly recommend.

I used a purchased harissa for this recipe (brand: Nomades Moroccan Recipes, Ltd.) I marinated the chicken in the lime, harissa, oil combination for just a few hours, not overnight. The flavor of the chicken was superb! I put a dab of the harissa on the side to dip in, skipping the sauce. My husband and I both agreed that we will definitely be trying this recipe with grilled shrimp sometime soon. For those of you who are intimidated by the extra time involved in preparing the harissa from scratch, try buying it! It took no time at all to prepare this.

I made this for a special occasion, the first time my parents visited my new home. I decided not to be lazy, and went out and purchased whole spices which I then ground using a coffee grinder. Superb! As I don't eat wheat, I subbed quinoia for couscous, delicious!! The quinoia turned out to be my parents' favorite part of the meal.

The store I went to for ingredients didn't have whole chickens, so I used skin-on breasts with ribs attached. I also added extra chili flakes b/c we like extra spicy food. Also, I couldn't find whole spices for all of the spices and had to use pre-ground. I'm sure freshly ground would have been tastier but I have to admit it probably made the recipe less tedious!

I made this over the weekend, thank goodness! It was truly a lot of work but REALLY worth it! Couldn't find a small chicken as called for so I doubled the ing. I was so glad I did. We saved the sauce and put it over some grilled tri-tip and also used it to season sandwiches! My husband LOVED it, thank you! As soon as my muscles recover from hand grinding, I'll make it again - ha!

I confess, I used a good quality commercial harissa as a time-saver. I'd be interested to know how different the version in the recipe is, if anyone knows both?

This dish was delicious. It is going to be a new obsession of mine. I would love to try other variations possibly with some Moroccan olives added to the harissa. I used more garlic than listed for the harissa. Next time I will make more harissa for marinating the chicken and to use for passing and possible leftovers. The couscous was great as well--would be even better with some toasted almonds.

OK, Epicurious, I finally followed the recipe to the letter. (Cooks probably know that you just need to toast the seeds until they release their fragrance - to wait till they're darker can release a burnt taste as well - don't want that). While it's time consuming to make, it's more than worth it! The chicken was superb, the harissa smooth and a superb condiment. For me, it required a little extra sweetness, so I served a curried mango chutney on the side, and prepared the couscous with currents steeped in garlic oil (which I had made anyway), then drained well and dried on paper towels, adding them to the couscous at the beginning of the prep stage. I served it with an arugula and fresh fig salad, with a light honey-citrus vinaigrette to complement the lime. Making it again? Yes! May experiment with the amount of lime zest - otherwise, simply wonderful, and I enjoyed the raves.
