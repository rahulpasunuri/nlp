Very easy and flavorful. Takes no time to make. I used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar, otherwise everything as written.

Tasty and easy. I just made the mushroom sauce and used it over chicken. While I liked it, I like alot of mushrooms. Also, especially for chicken, I like a lot more sauce. I would definitely double or triple for next time. I thought I had red cooking wine but I didn't realize we were out so I had to use white. Still tasty, but next time I will use red.

These are simply fab and simple to do! I didn't change a thing and it was wonderful!

This recipe was fantastic...I made a few adjustments as well...I used a mixture of shitake and cremini, substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar (resulting in a richer, smoother sauce) and I used Petite Sirah wine. The recipe was very easy and quick, I agree that I won't use the cornstarch next time as it thickened the sauce too much. Will definitely make again for friends next time.

Other than soaking the mushrooms in wine and cooking the chops a bit longer, I followed this recipe to a T, and it was absolutely delicious!

This was absolutely delicious. I seasoned the lamp chops with different seasonings because I like my food to have a lot of flavor. I used garlic powder and herb seasonings along with salt. I cooked the lamb chops longer than suggested and it was delicious before adding the wine sauce. I took the advice from the other reviews and soaked the mushrooms (fresh) in the Merlot Wine. I used White Merlot. I seasoned the sauce with the garlic powder and herb seasonings as well. I simmered the lamp chops in the wine sauce in the pan for a few minutes before serving and it was absolutely delicious, I had a second helping. I will definitely make this recipe again. The next time I will double the recipe for the sauce.

Made this last night with my boyfriend because I found lamb shoulder chops on sale and hadn't made them before. It was easy to make and the flavor was excellent.We added a bit of rosemary in addition to the thyme but otherwise made it exactly by the recipe. The only thing I might do differently next time is add a bit of chicken or beef stock to make more of the sauce because the mushrooms soaked up most of the wine (didn't even have to add cornstarch - there was no liquid). We will definitely make this again soon.

Great recipe, I grew up eating lamb, and have tried my best to get my wife to start liking it with no luck. After putting together this one, she fell in love with it. Easy to put together, wonderful taste. Felt like we were at a restaurant.

This recipe turned out better than I could have hoped. My boyfriend isnt one to each much meat but I decided to make this for him anyway&and he loved it. I followed some of the tips that others suggested and the dish turned out delicious. My boyfriend asked me to hold on tothis recipe so we can make it again!!

Just finished dinner and made this recipe. Excellent sauce, I'll definately make it again likely with beef tenderloin.

I had taken on a major job this week of sorting all my accummulated recipes into files/folders so that, in future it will be easier to access and try/use them. With being busy, I asked my husband to make this recipe. He was told to follow the recipe to a "T" as I wanted to know whether this was a good recipe or not. He used lamb loin steaks. We each had 2 slices, which we found more than enough meat to serve the two of us. He cooked the meat on a low heat and for a bit longer to make sure they were cooked through. The recipe turned out really lovely and tastey. The sauce reminded me of a sauce called Monkey Gland Sauce, made back in Zimbabwe by many steak houses/restaurants and they served it on beef steaks (fillet, rump or sirloin). It was not really made of monkey glands (not sure where the name originated from)but was similar to this sauce and was delicious. So we will definitely make this one again and even try it on our neighbours. So a great big thank you for this recipe and for your website - A real blessing!

I had some wonderful feta cheese on hand and added it to this recipe inspired by the LAMB CHOPS WITH FETA AND BANYULS-CHERRY SAUCE Bon Appétit, January 2005. It was fabulous. I soaked dried mushrooms in Marsala, used some fresh shitakis, and the flavors were fabulous. The feta is a great addition.

I also made this recipe with loin lamb chops and it was awesome! The sauce was incredible and think would go great with beef tenderloin. I used an 8 oz. container of mushrooms and used 1/2 cup of chopped onion. Will definitely make again!

I made this dish for Valentine's day. My fiance liked it, but I wasn't too thrilled. I followed the directions and many of the suggestions other people gave. I used lamb loin chops, porcini and white mushrooms and a merlot. The presentation was nice, but the sauce was a bit too pungent and a little too acidic for my taste. I guess it's better to be conservative with the vinegar.

I followed the recipe to the letter, and I have to admit that I was disappointed. I think this was just not to my taste buds. Kinda bland, and I felt it covered up the taste of the lamb. I would recommend following the advice of some of the other reviewers.

We loved this dish made with lamb loin chops. The sauce is just wonderful. I made the sauce again for our Holiday Dinner and served it with beef tenderloin..fantastic!

The sauce was absolutely delicious and incredibly easy to make well. It's just such a shame to have this delicious sauce and hardly any meat to eat. I would definitely recommend a cut other than the shoulder chop or any other meat that can hold up to such a rich, flavorful sauce.

I have never had lamb before and this was a wonderful introduction. I used Merlot as others suggested and used porcini mushrooms soaked in the wine in addition to white mushrooms. The end result was fantastic!! Will definitely make again.

I didn't have lamb chops on hand, but I did have a one-pound package of 91% angus ground beef and decided to give it a go. I made two hamburgers and cooked them in my cast-iron frying pan, following the cooking directions for the lamb chops. The sauce I kept the same. The hamburgers were terrific. I'll probably try the sauce with lamb some day, but I'll definitely cook it with hamburgers again. This sauce is wonderful.

It was a simple dish to do with excellent results. I added a tbsp of butter to the sauce at the end (a habit of mine with wine sauces!), but I'm not sure it needed it. I served the dish with lightly buttered & seasoned boiled carrots, new potatoes and green beans. The dish is rich enough that I don't think anything heavier as an accompaniement would suit. Next time, I'll try it with a mix of fresh & dried mushrooms.

Yes, I'll make it again but I'll definitely use loin chops instead; this is too good a dish to struggle with shoulder chops. Would also be fantastic with beef filets or tenderloins. Very easy to prepare; great results!

My mouth is watering just remembering how good it was. True flavours that went so well together, tender chops...mmmmm. I served it with potatoes - red, with skin on, tossed in melted butter and parsley, and a mixed baby greens salad with simple balsamic/olive oil. A very lovely Sunday lunch.

I made this on Valentines day. We loved it! I cooked the chops for on 3 min each side, and then put them back in the sauce for about 10 min after the sauce was completed. It was wonderful!

Excellent! I had no mushrooms, it was still terrific, will use them next time. I also used flour instead of cornstarch (personal preference), it worked well. I doubled the sauce and served with mashed potatoes, it's a keeper!

This is my favorite recipe (for NOW!!) I have to admit that lamb hadn't been one of m favorite meats however, after reading/preparing and eatin, I have a changed heart and would definitely give it a second shot :-)

Loved this recipe. I poured the sauce over the chops and put the whole thing into the oven to bake for a while. The meat was really moist and the sauce was very tasty. Great with bread to soak up the sauce.

I enjoyed this recipe with the following revisions. I added the same amount of dried rosemary along with the thyme. The sauce has such good flavor it is a shame to have it just as a side or topping to this dish. I like to finish the chops in the sauce. I also find that lamb shoulder chops respond well to longer moist cooking so this is a good match for flavor and method. If using loin chops, I will stick to the standard prep as not to overcook the meat.

I thought this was delicious! I only used one TBL of cornstarch in one TBL of water AND I waited until almost all of the wine had evaporated to put the cornstarch mixture in. My husband LOVED IT!!! While I made it in August, I think this would be a great winter-time dinner with some baked acorn squash.

This was wonderful. I took the advice of the others and used a merlot. I did have to cook the lamb a bit longer, my parents do not like the meat pink in the middle. Other than that it was great, I will definitly make this again.

This was an easy recipe to prepare. I found that I had to cook the lamb chops a bit longer than suggested, and a bit more cornstarch was needed to get the sauce to thicken to the consistency that I liked. I served it with mashed potatos, butternut squash, and a nice merlot. My husband loved it.

The recipe was easy but didn't have the robust flavor that I imagined with all the ingredients. The teaspoon of cornstarch to 1/2 cup water didn't allow the sauce to thicken. I hate runny sauces!

I would double the Thyme, and halve the cornstarch.

The flavour was excellent, and preparation minimal, but I felt that the chops could be slowly cooked in the gravy before it evaporated. The result was very good and the meat was tender and tasty. I removed the chops and then allowed the gravy to evaporate somewhat. While the chops were medium , the flavour was so good that I felt it was worth the extra cooking time

This is delicious and easy to prepare, however, I would substitute shoulder chops with another cut of lamb, such as loin chops, when making in the future. Shoulder chops are not very good quality in Southern California. The sauce is delicious....I was drinking Merlot so I used a California Merlot and it worked beautifully!

Excellent flavors. Easy to prepare. An ideal dish if preparation time is short but results are critical.
