Divine! Want to see [otherwise elegant] dinner guests literally lick their plates? I've made this many times as written and also with different fresh fruits--it's always a hit. Try peach with freshly grated ginger or apple with cinnamon--the glaze works beautifully on both and it's sooo easy. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

Gorgeous. Elegant. Absolutely delicious, and SO easy! Wowed all the rhubarb lovers. An instant top 10 favourite. I omitted the zest, made individual tarts, served with vanilla icecream and sugar crusted mint leaves. Would possibly use a few drops of vanilla in the glaze next time, or cardamon as suggested. Will definitely try with strawberries as also suggested, and a smear of marscapone underneath. Totally love it!

I love rhubarb as one of the few remaining seasonal fruits. My rhubarb patch is a bit frugal in its bounty so this dessert is perfect. It hits all the right notes in flavor while using rhubarb sparingly. Will definitely make again.

Everyone thought it was awesome, I took care to use uniform slices and lay them evenly- with the glaze they were beautiful. Wonderful flavor, light yet very flavorful. I made the mistake of mixing the zest with the juices, didn't make a difference. Will do this easy, elegent desert again. It was perfect after our Easter meal. 4 large ribs of Rhubarb were just a little too much, so that is a good estimate. (Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned this measurement).

I liked this v. much and friends who love rhubarb, but do not like "orange" desserts of any kind were lapping up the "sauce". I bought the more expensive Doufor (sp) puff pastry and really didn't see even a minor difference, so I'll stick with the Pepperidge Farm that you can get anywhere. It was a very bright flavor. I used 3 kinds of oranges because that's what I had on hand (Navel, Mineola and Mandarin). I also had key limes, so I used those. I LOVED the flavor of the sauce with the rhubarb "marinating" in it, but it became too sweet once it was reduced. I did mine for 17min and it was just right (IF) I had applied it immediately. Since the recipe doesn't say to apply the sauce to a hot -or- cooled product, I let it sit for about 15min and in the meantime my "sauce" gelled up to a honey consistency. I still swiped it on the edges and "splash painted" the fruit and it looked amazing, but I think applying both hot would have been better. Also, serve immediately should be in here. I pulled mine out of the oven and it was a lovely brown bottom to top, but about 3 hrs later at dessert time, the middle/bottom was soggy. Overall lovely and tasty and a fine presentation for the most timid chef. I recommend (if possible) buying uniform size stalks if you care to have your presentation perfect.

So easy, so quick, and so good. The glaze needs to be reduced to become syrupy. I made half the recipe for the 2 of us which serves 4. Very light. A mascarpone would be nice under the rhubarb. I didn't do the orange zest at the end.

This is so easy, it looks elegant and is a perfect end to a spring dinner or lunch. It is a good way for guests to try rhubarb for the first time.

Wow - delish and sooooo easy. This is a very delicate, sophisticated dessert ... if your crowd is expecting a traditional rhubarb pie-like dessert, this ain't it. But after a full meal or for folks who don't know what to expect from rhubarb, this dish is a keeper. Just incredibly easy!

I found this a bit boring and was disappointed with it because I love rhubarb.

This was so easy and delicious. I did one with strawberries, and one plain rhubarb. I added a little orange blossom water and cardamom to the syrup which gave it a bit more depth of flavor. I wound up with more syrup than I needed, but it would taste great on pancakes, yogurt, ice cream etc.

I decided to try this recipe because my husband adores rhubarb. I made it for a dessert party and it was gone before everything else! I was asked to send home the recipe with many guests. It's also VERY easy...big plus!

As others have said, this is an easy AND gorgeous tart. I sliced up extra rhubarb into the juices and sugar. I cooked down the extra rhubarb with a little more juice for a nice compote to have with ice cream, grilled meats, whatever...

Everybody loved this. I agree that the zest wasn't necessary for flavor, but it did look nice. The glaze took way longer to reduce than the recipe indicated, but it was worth the wait. Be sure to use a high quality, all butter puff pastry, such as Dufour or Goodwives. Serve the pastry the same day you make it because it is soggy the second day. Good, but soggy.

This is so easy! Everyone loved it but I have to say, I found the orange zest to be rather unnecessary. I made two for Easter and I didn't have enough rhubarb for the second one so I added sliced strawberries and it too was delicious- maybe even better!

Made it for St. Patrick's Day. I was surprised both by the combination of how easy it was and by how many raves it got from VERY sophisticated gourmands. You MUST reduce the sauce at least half if not more. I served with Haagen Daz Vanilla Frozen Yogurt, with the syrup drizzled on top of everything.

These are delicious, they were a huge hit at a summer party I threw. I had strawberries around and the extra sheet of puff pastry from the box so I doubled the recipe and added some thinly sliced strawberries. You do have to be careful about the extra moisture from the strawberries, but they tasted great and every last bite was eaten!

I think this is really yummy...more like 3 forks. But when you combine the facts that it's SO simple, SO fast, and can be very pretty if you take a little extra time. So for that, I bump it right up to 4 forks. Would be a great addition to a bridal shower or baby shower spread. I arranged my rhubarb slices in a concentric pattern and it worked beautifully.

What a wonderful dessert! When people saw this on the counter they asked if our meal had been catered. Easy and delicious,this is a great, light, summer dessert (though arranging the rhubarb nicely was a little time-consumng). I followed the other reviewers' suggestion and added extra rhubarb. The glaze really adds to the visual appeal of ths tart, so do not skip this step.

This is an easy dessert that looks and tastes great. I accidentally bought puff pastry that came pre-cut in 8 small squares, so I made individual tarts and it actually turned out nice because everyone could have their own tart with nice puffy edges and it didn't have to be cut. While eating this, I thought that the addition of some cardamom to the marinade/glaze might make for a more interesting dessert.

I'm a big rhubarb fan and would agree with Nimlet that this recipe could do with a lot more of it to make it really work. Other than that, it's a snap to pull together and tastes great.

Delish. Next time will use lots more rhubarb, though; the quantity in the recipe seems a bit low unless you want a really delicate dessert.

My first time making/eating rhubarb... this might quite possibly be the best thing I have ever tried outside of my grandmother's kitchen.

Made this for a Mother's Day brunch yesterday. So easy and everyone commented how beautiful and delicious it was. I used a bit less sugar because we all like rhubarb desserts a bit on the tart side. And I mixed the zest into the glaze after reducing it so that it spread more evenly on the tart.

I absolutely love rhubarb and this was a very easy, elegant, delicious dessert.

Really more like 3 1/2 forks, but excellent nonetheless. SO easy because of the frozen pastry, and absolutely GORGEOUS. make sure to really reduce the orange glaze, otherwise it's too watery. extra glaze is delicious on vanilla ice cream!

Sweet and delicious! Used lemon juice instead of lime, also I wouldn't put all of the glaze on next time.. it was a little sticky. If you don't have a scale, i found that 4 large stalks of rhubarb was the perfect amount.
