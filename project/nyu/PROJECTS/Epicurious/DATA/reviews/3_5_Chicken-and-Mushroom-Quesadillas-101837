I've been making this for years. Mods I've made to date: use 1 stick butter, 3-4 TBL chili powder (good stuff I order over internet), chicken thighs (not breasts), baby bella mushrooms (8 oz), and most recently added 1.75 oz shitake dried mushrooms (reconstituted) as well. This adds an intensity to the mushroom flavor. Also use pepper jack cheese for more kick. Follow remainder of recipe as written. Those that complained about lack of flavor, please try again!

Love this recipe! I made the quesadillas on the stove in a grill pan & they were still delish! The next time that I make them (& there will be a next time), I'll probably use a little more cheese than the recipe calls for (+ 1/4 cup?)as I found that the tortillas did not "stick" together as well as I would have expected. This filling could be great in other dishes too. Note that these are a million times better when they are fresh --- they do not reheat that well. Do not try microwaving your left overs! Better in the oven.

Good. My boyfriend raved, but he may have been a little drunk. Anyway, I did think they were a little bland, and that's even with adding a serano pepper. I probably messed up proportions - more chicken. less cheese, and a crazy amt of chili powder. I also skipped shitaki, but whatever. They were delicious and totally workable.

This is one of my go-to recipes for a casual grillside dinner or happy hour. Always comes out great. I use rotisserie roast chicken leftovers. We used small flour tortillas this time, and we netted 5 quesadillas from the recipe.

Easy and tasty. Made a chipotle cream sauce to go with it. Loose mixture of sour cream, heavy cream and chipotle sauce. Topped with sliced scallions. Yummy.

I have made this several times and it is still my "go to" recipe for ease and flavor. When I know people are coming over, it is often the first thing I think of to make for friends.

This was the blandest quesadilla we as a family have ever eaten I wish I could have given a half fork! There is not enough spice to hook this recipe up. Also this was extremly time consuming and a mess to clean up after, I am an experienced cook and there are far better recipes than this for quesadillas, I am sad because I was really looking forward to a good mexican meal tonite for dinner thank goodness I made my home made guacamole at least the dinner wasn't a total loss. I will be removing this from my box Do not Waste your Time Go to Taco bell it would be better and cheaper than this!!!

The combined flavours and spices here are unbelievable! Guests will be surely impressed! I warm a fry pan and place the tortilla on that then place filling on one side and fold over. Very impressive! No left overs here.

First time I've made quesadillas and the whole family loved every bit of this recipe. Everyone wandered in from what they were doing, "Mmm, Mom, what are you MAKING? It smells so good!" They kept asking "When's it gonna be done?", even moreso than normal. Made exactly as the recipe stated and enjoyed every bit!

I made these for a party and they were quite the hit, hot off the grill. They are kind of a nice twist on the old stand-by cheese quesadilla, but without a whole lot of attitude. I purchased a some carnitas from a take-out counter in a fancy grocery store in place of the chicken. I also used larger flour tortillias so that I could fold them in half--this made turning them over farily easy.

These are terrific. I put them on the grill in my fish basket to help hold them together. They taste great and couldn't be easier to make. I usually make them as written, but have switched up the filling based on what I have available. A true keeper.

This was easy and excellent. We used 1/ 2 teaspoon of chipotle chili powder which gave it an additional kick and cooked onions with mushrooms which helped add to the flavor. Used a grill pan and a little flour mixed with water to help seal the edges. Next time want to try with vidalia onions.

Rating: 3
My husband and I loved these! It was super simple and not time consuming, we had all the ingredients on hand except for the exact kind of mushrooms--I just used button mushrooms. We didn't grill them, we just let them heat up in a pan on the stove top--3 minutes per side. I'm sure this will be a regular.

Very easy. I love the mix of chicken and mushrooms. Quesadillas are usually a way for me to throw leftovers into a pan, and I had some leftover chicken with a spice rub of cumin, chili powder, and cayenne. I used it and some portabello caps, and the combo was delicious!

Rating: 4
I made as is and these are wonderful!!! One of the best combinations of flavor I have ever tasted! I make them all the time. Sometimes when I have left over filling, I just roll it up in a flour tortilla burrito-style and pop in the microwave for a quick snack.

I agree with the previous reviewer. These were pretty blan even though I used pepperjack cheese and about a half teaspoon of cayanne. I made half on flour tortilla and half with corn tortilla, and grilled all of them on the BBQ. Corn was slightly better.

These were okay (which means, we ate them) but they didn't live up to all of the raving. I doubt I'll make them again.

Surprisingly bland, given the amount of spice in the chicken mixture. I probably wouldn't bother with this again. In my opinion, the Chicken Cheddar Quesadillas with Tomato and Corn Salsa on this site are far tastier.

So delicious! I buy boneless chicken breasts and poach them with whatever fresh herbs I have on hand. My husband doesn't like cilantro so I substitute parsley with great results. For a more gourmet taste I omit the jack cheese and instead spread the insides of the tortillas with goat cheese, which is fantastic. When no grill available, I have baked the quesadillas in the oven and it's worked fine. I make this over and over again, it's so good!

I served these delicious quesadillas for an appetizer and they were a smash! I decided to prepare a few in a grill pan and the rest on our outdoor grill. There was no comparison to the outdoor grill crispy tortillas! I would definately make them again.

These quesadillas were so flavorful served with some sour cream, pico de gallo and a slice of lime. I used left over fried chicken after removing the skin and breading. I baked them in the oven at 400 after spraying them lightly with an oil spray. They were crispy and delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

The July 1999 issue of Bon Appetit was a classic. It contains this recipe and several other keepers. I first made these quesadillas in July '99 and have made them many, many times since. They are cheap, easy, foolproof, and delicious. I always invest in a Maui onion for this recipe. You get the crunch of raw onion combined with the Maui's onion's unique cool sweetness. I buy a roasted chicken at the supermarket and tear it apart by hand. Also, shredded jack cheese is usually sold in 2 cup packages, so that's what I use (not 2-1/2 cups, as called for). I made these again last night for a pool party, and they just flew off the serving plate. It's really neat because you can grill them while your guests watch and then serve them warm off the grill. They think you're a real grill chef. If they only knew how easy they are!

This was delish! I added spinach to the filling because I really wanted a green veggie for dinner and it was a wonderful addition. Canned chicken chunks works well in a pinch. Even my 2 year old liked it!

Rating: 3
Very good, but cooking on the grill is a MUST... I tried them in a skillet and found them only so-so. However, to make flipping them easier (and to limit the amount of topping that drops into the bottom of the grill), I take them off the grill and turn them over onto my cookie sheet, then put them back on the grill with the cooked side up. This way, any topping lost falls onto your cookie sheet and you can easily replace it. Also, the best part about quesadillas is that you can make just cheese ones for the younger diners who are more picky in their ways and save these for yourselves!

These are fabulous! Have made them several times and get rave reviews every time. The only change I make is to saute the onions at the same time with the mushrooms

We always celebrate the first weekend of spring with a big barbeque (the weather actually cooperated this year). As always, I make the quesadillas and margaritas. These are a huge hit. Easy to make, and really good. I leave the chicken out of half for our vegetarian friends and they taste pretty good too. This recipe is a real winner.

Absolutely delicious. I only put button mushrooms and still turned out perfect. Best quesadillas we've ever had!

Made this for company & it just wow-ed them! Used flour tortillas instead of corn and it turned out great! Instead of grilling we flipped them like pancakes in an omelette pan and they came out nice and crispy. To keep them together, we added the cheese while it was still hot in order to adhere the tortillas. May be even better if made the night before - tasted better for leftovers!

I've never made quesadillas that tasted so professional before. I made a couple of changes...Used a non-stick pan instead of grill and I used flour tortillas. My husband was very impressed.

this recipe was easy and tasty. I also used a rotisserie chicken ( so easy!) and used pepper jack to give it a little more zing. The little bit of leftover chicken mixture was great the next day on nachos.

This was a huge hit at a Mexican-themed party I just threw. I substituted Adobo spice for the Oregano, and mixed in some grated Pepper Jack with the Monterey Jack cheese for some spice. There were none left, and I had many requests for the recipe. Also gave this recipe a trial run earlier in the week with turkey, since I had no chicken on hand-- definitely a versatile recipe!!

This has become a regular in our house! I use a prepared rotisserie chicken, though, as it's faster and much more flavoful. I like the fact that this recipe lends itself to improvisation -- Be careful not to add too much cheese, though, as it can become very greasy. Also, I use a sandwich press -- much more convenient, and faster since you can crisp both sides at once.

I have made this multiple times following the recipe exactly and it has been a wonderful success every time! Use a big spatula on each side to turn them (grilling). This is a good late night snack to have around in the summer too since you can keep the mixture all done and ready to go for a day or two.

We adapted this since we didn't have all the ingredients, but it was still good. We used flour tortillas. Wouldn't mix the cheese into the mixture, rather put a little on the tortilla before the mixture and a little on top before placing the 2nd tortilla. That way the tortillas "stick" to the mixture better.

Use flour tortillas. Cook on the grill using no more than medium heat so the insides melt before the tortillas burn. Rave reviews from our friends!

Delicious. I tried to make the first few on the grill and that was a disaster! So I made the rest on a pan sprayed with oil and they were perfect. One nice surprise is that I had leftover filling and made more the next day and they tasted the same. I was thrilled because I can do everything the day before and just spread the mixture on a shell. A keeper.

I made this for some food savey friends that we had invited over for Sunday Afternoon Football. I was able to make the filling ahead of time and at the very last minute, I put the filling in FLOUR tortillas and then, put them in the mircowave until the cheese melted. I finished them in my George Forman grill which gave them that great grilled look. They were a HIT!!!!! Oh and I substituted the garlic and chili powder with shallots and toasted cumin. I am making this again over the holidays!

I've made this recipe a number of times - but never grilled and only once as a quesadilla. Personally, we like it as a simple rolled tortilla filling. It's frequently requested by the family and great for parties in a chafing dish along with sour cream, lettuce, tomato and salsa. The ability for advance preparation a real plus.

I am a vegetarian, so I used spinach instead of chicken and used portobellos instead of the button and shiitake mushrooms. It was delicious and will definitely make this again. I also used a blend of 4 cheese from the store, instead of just Monterey Jack.

Used a pizza stone in the oven and found if you use one large tortilla and fold it over, makes it easy to "roll" the quesadilla over to crisp both sides. Wonderful!

I brought this dish to a Margarita party last night. We all brought Mexican appetizers and these quesadillas were the first to go. As a matter of fact, the guys were fighting over who would get the last one. I used the flour tortillas, substituted parsley for the cilantro and only used the shitake mushrooms(all I had). My husband started raving about the smell as soon as the garlic and chili pepper mixed with the butter. I broiled them in the oven about 3 minutes each side. Very easy to make and delicious to eat. My husband wants them again, tonight!

This recipe came out very well with a few modifications: 1) I used the big burritoe sized wraps and folded them in half and 2) I used smoked cheddar cheese. A little tossed salad on the side and I had a light easy meal. Next time I make this I'll use more veggies.

These were going great until my husband burned them half to death on the grill. Next time I will probably bake them, but other than being charred to a crisp, they were really good. When I make them again I will also add some minced jalapeno for a little more kick. Otherwise, the flavors were excellent! Served with Spanish Rice and a tossed salad; nice Sunday supper.

This is a fabulous dish. I made it for super bowl and it was devoured in no time. I substituted parsley for the cilantro and it was just as good, and used flour tortillas. I assembled them and baked them on a cookie sheet, then cut them in wedges to serve, not as crispy as they would be if grilled but they came out great. I will surely make them again. What great flavors. I think the chili powder makes the recipe, and it does not make them spicey either. Great combination. This recipe is a definite keeper.

My friends and I made this recipe for our 'Gourmet Lunch'and it was the best thing on the table! The ingredients were pretty easy to assemble and the only problem we had was trying to figure out how to grill them (the oven was otherwise occupied). we solved that however by placing a very sturdy pan on the grill and perfecting out quesadilla-flipping skills over a medium flame. we'll definitly be making these again the next time we do this!

This is a great recipe, worthy of 3 1/2 forks at least.I've made it twice to rave reviews, and in fact just now printed a copy for a friend who requested it.I prefer to use flour tortillas and about half the cilantro called for.I've made it using all the cilantro & also a lesser amount;all agreed that it was better with less -it enhanced rather than overpowered the other flavors.Also didn't have Shitakes, so just used Criminis.

I just LOVED this recipe - have made it many times. Usually just do the tortillas in a non-stick skillet & fold over to turn easier. Brushing with olive oil still adds something. Have tried lots of different mushrooms - they're all great. It was great on the grill too but messier & not as spontaneous.

Delicious! I made this recipe twice. I use small non-stick skillet instead of grill and fold each tortilla in half for easy flipping. The last time I tried this recipe, I made a quesadillas party with my friends. I provided the filling ahead of time using chicken, steak, mushroom and various cheeses (such as spicy monterey jack and colby). I cut each tortillas into half so each guests can fold the filling into quarter wedges. I served them with chipotle salsa and lime sourcream. Definitely a keeper!
