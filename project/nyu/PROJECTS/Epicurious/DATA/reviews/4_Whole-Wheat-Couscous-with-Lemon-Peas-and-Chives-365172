Very good, easy and will probably make again, but not outstanding

super yummy! made it for the first time tonight, and this will become a staple side. Love that it's vegetarian!

Great side dish to put together quickly or do ahead of time. The turmeric lends a beautiful color, but could easily be swapped out for anything you like (saffron, curry powder..). Made this with the slow baked salmon that is suggested, and my boyfriend complimented the pairing without knowing it was Bon Appetit's idea. Would definitely make this again as a side dish for many things.

This recipe is a perfect spring dinner. I prepared as written, adding a bit more lemon/garlic for taste. The tumeric adds a nice color and leftovers the next day were delish.

Excellent recipe. Very light. I added fresh cilantro instead of almonds at the end (sort of a combination of this recipe and another very similar recipe). The only issue I had was that the dish never heated back up again after adding the peas. Not sure if it was supposed to be that way or not.

I love this dish, as does my family. I've made it several times now and it always goes fast. The lemon and chives are such a nice compliment. Somehow it's both light and filling at the same time. Definitely do take the time to add the lemon zest - it's worth it.

Very easy but tasty. I followed the recipe and worried that the zest might be overpowering but it's not.
