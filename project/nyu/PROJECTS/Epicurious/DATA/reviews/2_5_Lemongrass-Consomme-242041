This makes a wonderful broth and the chicken "reserved for other use" is really tender and juicy on its own. I use twice as much ginger, chile, lemongrass, and salt as is called for here, because I like my broth strong and spicy. I've made this recipe several times, always to great result. For a large Seder supper, I double the recipe, shred some of the chicken and add it back in, and drop in matzoh balls made according to the package. It always gets rave reviews, especially from the rabbi!

Didn't come out clear like consomme should, didn't have much flavor, over all, pretty disapointing
