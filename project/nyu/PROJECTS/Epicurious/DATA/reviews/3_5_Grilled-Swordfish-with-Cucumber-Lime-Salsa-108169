I normally use just salt-and-pepper when grilling swordfish, but this marinade added a subtle zing that made it worth the extra effort. I was meticulous with removing the pith from the lime, which resulted in a salsa that was sweet and sour and spicy, with no bitterness. The salsa was so good that I could eat it as a side dish. In fact, that's what I did.

This was the best thing I've ever tasted from my own kitchen...

This was simple to make, fresh and delicious. Perfect for summer. I didn't the cucumber, was afraid it would lose most of it's flavor. It's was perfect like that.

This turned out great! I doubled the recipe for two steaks. Removing the white pith from the lime was very time consuming though.

Used more coriander in marinade than recipe called for. Glad I did. Marinated for 30 minutes. Seasoned swordfish prior to cooking, S & P.Glad I did. Salsa, added, ripe mango and some pineapple. Delicious!!! Great dinner for spring night. Big hit.

Very ordinary. The recipe was not saved by the salsa, which came out very bitter. Would not make this again as it was not even close to being worth the trouble (even though it was pretty easy!).

This was a very easy dish to make. It was the first time I cooked swordfish. Turned out amazing. Will have to do it again. Was shocked how well the salsa tasted. Wasn't so sure to start out, glad I made it.

This is one of our most favorite standard dishes. We grill the swordfish on the Big Green Egg. My husband has even learned to make the salsa himself.

This was great and flavorful. I doubled the swordfish marinade but the salsa easily serves 2-3 people unless you're using it as a salad.

Delicious! Just the right amount of jalapeno in the salsa. Like another reviewer, I didn't try to peel and de-pith the lime, but rather I cut it in half like a grapefruit and used a grapefruit knife to cut out the sections of the "meat". The "empty" lime halves contained a fair bit of juice, which I added to the salsa. For 2 servings, I doubled the amount of the marinade, which was plenty. But the stated amount of salsa was just fine for the two of us.

Really delicious. I'm a wimp, so I opted for no jalapeno, which I'm sure is a cardinal sin to some. But it made for a very refreshing, simple (and quick) meal. We defrosted some frozen swordfish steaks, and grilled them on tinfoil (don't NEED a grill pan). Definitely a keeper!

this was delicious and easy for someone who does not cook. i loved the blend of the flavors from the lime, jalapeno and fresh cilantro. it was so good and very spicy with two jalpenos - i did not use sugar or honey and it was excellent. great healthy summer dish that is quick and easy.

Okay, let's face the facts...this salsa would be good on any fish. Take note if you're male and looking for something to impress your wife/lady, because this makes it look like you know what you're doing. The marinade is pretty standard stuff. You can toss the fish on the grill. The salsa makes the dish special. Serve it with grilled vegetables, a nice polenta and a mild dry white wine and you'll have a reasonable chance of getting lucky.

This was very good! Made as specified in recipe. My whole family loved it! I did recieve requests for less lime next time. This is also a recipe that can be modified to suit the preference of your family.

YUM. This is a wonderful way to use up garden cukes and hot peppers.

This salsa was wonderful. I followed the recipe as is except for cooking the fish on the grill. The only trouble I had was with the limes, any secrets? We had "off the boat" fresh swordfish, but will use this salsa in our restaurant for a special, prob with Tuna or whatever we can get that day. Curious to see how it goes over there. Thanks to the reviewer that pointed out that it was one serving! I doubled it.

This recipe was very light, spicy, and refreshing. I am going to try again with fresh cilantro. I did not have any cilantro, so I rehydrated some dry. Not the best idea to use dry cilantro in anything, proved by this addition.

This salsa is so refreshing, especially for the summertime. Last night, I made it and piled it on top of grilled chicken breasts. This is a keeper, and it's not for just fish anymore!

I used this marinade and salsa for grilled spotted bay bass fillets that my kids caught. Made it as described, but used less sugar in the salsa as suggested. My only comment is to note that the recipe as shown is for a serving of one.

This was a very nice and light recipe. The lime and cucumber were delicious with the fish-I used this with haddock and plan to try swordfish later. I would like to try this with tortillas as per one suggestion.

i decided to use this as filling for some good flour tortillas and it turned out great! next time i might add some tomato and avocado, but definetely worth a try.

LOVED the salsa! We grilled both swordfish and tuna - wonderful on both. It was delicious - light, summery and refreshing. We will enjoy this again.

Very good recipe. The marinade adds a nice touch to the swordfish, but keep in mind that it is light and not at all overpowering. In fact, I wouldn't mind a little more oomph. I made some changes to the salsa, adding tomato, avocado and substituting dried chili and chives. It was still great!

I've tried this twice. The first time I found the salsa to be very bitter, despite the fact that I had removed all of the rind when preparing the lime. The second time I tried it I used the juice of the lime only (rather than diced lime pulp) and it was much much better.

I have made this several times, and it has always been a hit. I often make the cucumber-lime salsa to go with tuna as well. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Really great and easy recipe. I found that I doubled the marinade, just so that there would be more of it to marinade the fish in. I also could not find ground Coriander so I just used fresh ground pepper. I actually used my George Foreman grill and the fish came out great, I also used fresh Tallapia Fillets. Fantastic! Definitely recommend it for a steamy summer evening!

Delicious recipe, and so easy to make. I wasn't able to follow it exactly (missing jalapeno peppers) but I had no problem tweaking it here and there based on personal preferences. Salsa is delicious, especially with fresh cukes from my garden! Enjoy.

I didn't have enough lime so I used lemon juice for the fish, yet it came out really good. Very delicious and the hot salsa goes really well with the fish.

I would definitely make this recipe again. The limes were a pain to peel and chop, but that was about it. I actually grilled the swordfish on the gas grill, and it came out really juicy and tender. You have to be careful not to overcook because it gets dried out. I made the salsa in the afternoon for the evening meal, which we ate around 8:00 pm, and it was wonderful. I don't know why the two hour restriction is mentioned. The combination of the meaty fish with the tangy salsa is my favorite... especially if you are a cilantro/lime lover like I am.

My husband and I decided to make this dish one evening when we had most the salsa ingredients in the house. We were quite pleased with the results. The sweet/sour bite of the salsa pairs nicely with the meaty swordfish. As with all great final dishes, you must use fresh fish and not overcook it. I would also recommend the salsa for grilled ahi tuna. A simple recipe with excellent results.

I found the cucumber lime salsa to be way to bitter. I would not make it again.

I just made the salsa for a Mexican party that I had. It was good and different. I roast my peppers first and I think that adds a nice flavor. I do think the salsa could have used just a little something else, maybe the swordfish!

I had a hard time finding fresh swordfish in Chicago, so I had to use frozen from our local grocery store. The salsa was great, but the fish was terrible. Once again I am reminded of how different frozen vs. fresh tastes! I will try this recipe again, but only if I can find FRESH swordfish.

This was so delicious. I just loved the lime salsa with the swordfish.

What a fantastic recipe! It is so wonderful to have such a different and tasty dish. We are going through a record hot August here at the moment with temperatures at 45ºC (113ºF) during the day, so to eat such a refreshing, yet delicious dish is great. I made it last night and my wife and I just loved it. The only change I made was to save effort, I cut the limes into wedges and then sliced the meat out (like how one eats a melon). Everything else was exactly the same and I even love the dish because it gave me a chance to use my first home-grown chillies. We ate it with a small rocket (or rúcula), shaved parmesan salad, with a lemon and olive oil dressing - and it went together perfectly. Just an all round great dish - easy to make and exquisite!

Perfect for a hot summer night. I thought the salsa was well balanced with the perfect amount of heat. I will make this again.

This receipe did not do much for my husband and me. We thought the salsa was a little bland and we did the marinate with tuna and it didn't work very well. Looked pretty, but we were disappointed overall.

Made this purely for the salsa, which I had with cold poached salmon, and was very happy with it! (I used the trick of salting the diced cucumbers and letting them weep for 30 minutes, then rinsing and drying before continueing, and the stuff held up wonderfully for days.) Importantly, this calls for lime, not lime juice...the bits of lime "meat" made the difference, so don't used bottled juice!

Living in Southern California as it can be hot..we are always looking for great, light, grilled fish recipes! We made this for a dinner party of 10 and everyone raved. The salsa for this fish is WONDERFUL and refresing on a hot day! Can't wait to make it again.

Excellent recipe. Easy and fast. I did use swordfish, but I feel guilty when I do, so I'll try Mahi-Mahi next time. Generally, I like to get my lime juice fresh from the lime, but it was fine with the bottled stuff. The cilantro flavor complimented the fish very well.

Rating: 3
Also used mahi-mahi. Really liked the marinade, not so excited about the salsa. Perhaps I still had some pith in the limes (I doubled the recipe), as they were a bit bitter and took away from the fresh flavors. Perhaps next time I will just use lime juice, or fewer limes. Very easy and tasty for weeknight grilling.

This is a wonderful recipe!!! I also used Mahi Mahi for the fish!! both fish are wonderful. I also used a little lemon-pepper for a light season too.
