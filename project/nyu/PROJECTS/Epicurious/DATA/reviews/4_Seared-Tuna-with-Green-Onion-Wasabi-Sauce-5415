Brushed the tuna with the sauce and added white and black sesame seeds. Seared on each side for 2 minutes. Used 2 TBSP of wasabi paste rather than the powder and water combo. Omitted the green onion b/c I didn't have any. But I did steam some haricots verts (green beans) as another user suggested - to accomodate the sauce,and it was delicious. Would definitely make again. My husband said this was a winner.

I loved this! Made the sauce with just under 1/4 cup water and coated each side of the tuna with sesame seeds before searing. The cooking time was a good suggestion for a starting place and then to tweak for personal taste. I cooked mine 1 minute less and gave 1 minute more to my husband's portion. Both were perfect! A nice light, healthy meal, full of spicy flavor and pleasing texture. I didn't have radish sprouts, but added shredded lettuce sprinkled under the cucumber. A few shreds of grated carrot would have also worked. Yum.

Great dish. I love spicy and this is it. I agree with the other on the water in the sauce. I made as called for and the sauce was to thin. I will make this again soon but I will reduce the water.

This is a GREAT and quick dish. I do agree with all written about the water. The amount of water called for to make the sauce is to much. I will make again but reduce the water.

Very nice. Made with a number of the suggested modifications - sesame seeds, shorter cooking, less water, plus used Sake instead of Sherry. But the only mandatory change is to cut the water. No need to mix the wasabi powder with water, it will go straight into the other liquids. Then you can add water until you get the consistency you want.

Awesome. I used Wasabi paste, no water. Sear tuna one minute per side. This is the best sauce recipe I have found. Will definitely make again

I made into an appetizer by serving on fried wontons topped first with the wasabi sauce MIXED WITH CREME FRESH, a thin slice of cucumber, then with a slice of the pepper/sesame seared ahi, topped with a drizzle of the soy/ginger/wasabi sauce. DELICIOUS!!!

I followed recipe to the letter and did indeed find the sauce way too thin. That being said it tasted great and the recipe was very reward for little effort. The lesson learned is to read the reviews prior to preparing the dish!

A great, quick recipe. I made as others mentioned, using toasted sesame seeds, grilled on a charcoal fire, used chives instead of scallions, and definitely reduce water and wasabi amounts to creat more of a paste overall.

Rating: 4
I've done this recipe several times. I don't use the 1/2 cup of water - I just reconstitute the wasabi powder until it forms a smoother paste, then mix in the rest of the ingredients. I love to coat the tuna in black and white sesame seeds and sear on a grill pan for a few minutes per side. Then serve over steamed brown rice to help soak up the sauce. It's amazing that something so yummy is so easy to make. I do use the full amount of regular soy sauce, but I like salty things.

Easy and delicious weekday recipe that I will be making again. I used sushi grade tuna and briefly seared it (1 min/side). Then, I sliced the tuna and put the pieces on top of the cucumber for an alternate presentation. Also the last reviewer is correct. 1.2 c. of water is way to much to form a paste.

Rating: 2
The bitter aftertaste some people are experiencing is because they are following the recipe's directions; and the directions lead to a mixture of wasabi powder and water that is MUCH too thin. It only allows some of the wasabi flavor to come through, hence the bitterness. Folks, add at least one more tablespoon of powder (or reduce the water as others have suggested). Aside from that, I loved this. I too crusted the fish with toasted sesame seeds before searing. And I agree that the green onions really make the dish. Next time, I might try adding a hint of brown sugar, since I used riesling and plan to do so in the future. I never have sherry and don't want to buy a bottle for one recipe.

Rating: 1
I wasn't a fan of this recipe. The sauce is way too liquidy for me. In all honesty, I prefer a creme fraiche based sauce (using wasabi powder, ginger and garlic) and coating the tuna in sesame seeds. Similar flavours, but nicer presentation. I wouldn't make this again.

Rating: 1
When I read the ingrediants, 1/3 cup soy sauce seemed like a lot, but since the reviews were so positive, I made the recipe as written. Turned out it was too much soy sauce; that's all I could taste. A waste of time and other ingrediants.

Rating: 0
great recipe. I added a tsp of penut butter, a 1/2 tsp of honey, and a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit. I barely tasted the penut butter so maybe next time I would add a tiny bit more. Also I would use sashimi grade tuna. It makes all the difference. This recipe was delicious. I also served it with Wasabi, roasted garlic mashed red potatoes with partial skin left on.

Loved it. Way impressed my guests. I followed the advice of a few of the reviewers and used wasabi paste and chardonnay. I also cut up jicama and carrots with the cucumbers and radish sprouts. Also followed another recipe for searing tuna with a sesame seed/wasabi crust but don't remember where in this website I got it from but here is what I did: Tuna 1/4 cup white sesame seeds 1/4 cup black sesame seeds 1 tbsp wasabi powder (found at Asian grocery stores) Vegetable-oil cooking spray 1 tbsp sesame oil 2 pieces tuna loin (about 8 oz each), cut in half For tuna: Place a large nonstick pan over high heat until hot. Combine sesame seeds and wasabi in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Coat pan with cooking spray; drizzle oil in pan. Lightly salt tuna; dredge in sesame-wasabi mixture. Reduce heat to medium and place tuna in pan. Sear until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Flip; cook 2 minutes more. Remove from heat and let rest for a few minutes. Also, put some of the excess sauce on sauteed green beans. Amazing.

We love the flavors of Janpanese food so this recipe was a natural for us. I made the full amount of sauce for only two pieces of fish and then used the extra to season some buckwheat noodles that I tossed with the cucumber. Delicious! The only thing I might change is to add more wasabi. I used prepared wasabi and maybe that made it less pronounced.

Rating: 3
This is really good. I had Wasabi paste and used about 1 Tbs. (no water) and it had plenty of pep and nice flavor. Skipped the cucumber/radish sprout thing, but it was good using about 1/4 C. sesame seeds pressed into both sides of the Ahi prior to searing -- it gave it a great crust.

I really liked this recipe, it was almost as good as a restaurant. The next time I will buy sushi-grade ahi and only sear the outside of the fish; not let it become so opaque on the inside. The sauce was delicious but I'd like to try to thicken it next time.

Rating: 3
When I was making this I thought, "gee, doesn't three Tablespoons of wasabi powder seem like a lot?" but we like wasabi -- a lot -- so I went for it. As is turns out, in our case and with this EXACT recipe, three Tablespoons of wasabi powder IS a lot! Of course we did live to tell, but in the interest of using the recipe again, I thought I'd explore how we might change things up for next time. I just went through and read lots more reviews...it seems that what some people were going for was the creation of a wasabi+other flavors paste. That would have been delicious dabbed on the tuna. Yum. Might do that. I think what the recipe is having you create, though, is a true sauce -- yes, it's thin -- more like a vinaigrette than a "ranch" consistency, but to be poured on the tuna and salad. Personally, I would recommend starting out with one Tablespoon of wasabi and one Tablespoon of water, then increasing the wasabi to your taste and thinning with additional water to achieve your desired consistency. My only true complaint with the recipe is the cooking time for the fish. Obviously, if you want it cooked (and I do mean cooked) then three minutes per side it is. But if you've got great, fresh tuna and you're going for seared meat, cooked rare or medium rare, then try one minute on each side or 90 seconds on each side. For heaven's sake, don't be afraid to check it. You can't go back, you know. If you are concerned about presentation, slice it to check and then continue to slice to serve!

A good recipe, but not good enough to make for myself(my wife doesn't dig fish).I used the paste Wasabi and will stick with this method if I make the recipe again. I also added carrots, and jicama(which I might saute next time-the carrots were a little to crunchy). If you are looking for something simple and a little out of the ordinary this is a recipe you should try--Cheers

This was great. I coated the Ahi with kosher salt & toasted Sesame seeds & seared it for about 1 minute 30 on the first side & slightly less after flipping it (it was a very thick piece). I also used wasabi paste and 1 Tbs. Chardonnay (didn't have Sherry) with fine results. The green onions made the sauce. I served it on a bed of julienned carrots, cucumbers, jicama and Spanish onions tossed with a bit of the sauce. I'll absolutely make this again; it was fabulous.

Best thing about this is that it is so quick and easy! As others said, you can do a sesame seed crust (yum!) and serve with horseradish mashed potatoes. I think 60-75 seconds per side is perfect for rare, and of course, make the wasabi sauce thicker.

asian-flavored seared tuna with green beans is the other recipe on this site that uses the wasabi and that recipe is wonderful!!!- it makes this recipe a waste of time.

Rating: 1
After going through this recipe I suspect - what was really to use 3T of wasabi paste vs. wasabi powder. With wasabi powder the sauce was overpowering and extremely waterly. I found a much better recipe about a month ago on epicurious that called for tuna to be covered with wasabi powder and seaseme seeds. Unfortunately I can no longer find that one.

I want to jack this review up to 100%! LOVED IT. LOVED IT!! For sushi freaks this is a good at-home substitute. I made it with about a T. of ginger, used wasabi from the tube, (incidentally, a small tube of wasabi is just barely 3 T.) no extra water, crusted the outside with toasted sesame seeds, served it with steamed white rice, 2 cukes cut up, and a spinach salad with a dressing of lime juice, olive oil, sesame oil, ginger, garlic. SO GOOD!!! Also I only cooked it on 2 min. 1st side, 1 minute the second.

I think this dish puts my cooking on a whole new level. Follow the other tips (less water in the sauce, coat the fish with sesame seeds) and you will think you are eating in a fine restaurant. Don't skip the radish sprouts - they really put it over the top! Delicious!

For those who found the sauce bitter, it might be the use of wasabi powder. I use the powder the first time I made it and the paste the second. I like the paste version much better. The sauce is simple enough to not over power the tuna yet very, very tasty.

I have gone over the recipe and can't figure out what went wrong.We noticed a very bitter after taste- we used high quality tuna and wasabi. We cooked it 2 mins on each side as we wanted it very rare, My opinion is the soy overpowered the tuna as a marinade.

This was ok, but I think I bought crummy wasabi. Everyone who tried this found the sauce to have a very bitter aftertaste. I want to try again, but using my favourite paste instead.

My husband raved about this dish. It is so easy to prepare! I was prepared for the wasabi-water problem - I actually took my measuring spoon and measured out 3T which looks like A LOT of wasabi. I eyeballed the amount of water and it took about 1/4-1/3 C water to make a creamy paste. I also added toasted crushed sesame seeds - a good suggestion from one reviewer. The flavor of the cucumber with the sauce is outstanding. My all time favorite is still the Pan Seared Ahi with Ginger-Shiitake Cream Sauce but it is too fattening to make very often. I'll make this recipe more frequently.

I wonder if this recipe should be 3 T wasabi paste to 1/2 T water? Just a thought. We followed the recipe using the measurements listed and thought this was excellent. I'll definitely make it again, it was easy and flavorful. I stir-fried a bag of broccoli slaw with some of the sauce and served the fish (we used Wahoo) on top of that, with steamed rice and cucumber on the side. Wow!

Yummy! Try it, you'll love it. Like another reviewer, I had trouble creating a wasabi "paste" when following this recipe. In fact, as the other reviewer suggested, if you add enough wasabi powder to make a paste, you likely won't be able to eat the sauce (too hot). Thus, I've abandoned the idea of making my own wasabi paste by mixing powder with water. Instead, I use store bought wasabi paste (comes in a tube) and simply mix it with soy to taste (omit the 1/2 cup of water if you do this). The sauce is still wonderful, even if it's not a paste. We serve the fish & sauce with mashed potatoes, and it's great.

Maybe I did something wrong here. When I added the wasabi powder to the water, instead of the smooth paste the recipe mentioned, I got wasabi water! The only way I could get it to make a paste, was to add a LOT more wasabi to the mixture. The final sauce looked fine, but just tasted like industrial strength wasabi and was not very good. The wasabi taste just overpowered all the other ingrediants. Next time I'll just go back to the Pan-seared tuna with ginger-shiitake cream sauce recipe, which is always Fabulous!

This recipe was a great way to eat my favorite fish, although the sauce would have been even better if there were about half as much of it, and it were slightly thicker. Great taste though. . .the flavor of the fish was still in tact but nicely enhanced with the addition of the sauce.

Made this for friends last night to rave reviews. Some changes I made were to marinate the tuna in half of the wasabi sauce. The other half I heated to reduce. When heated, it became thick almost instantly and lost a lot of it's heat (and I had added extra wasabi!) It was still delicious, though next time I will add more wasabi after heating. I served it with Chinese long beans with pork which was spicy enough to make me forget the lack of heat in the Tuna sauce. Also had grilled baby bok choy and a salad of green beans, watercress, toasted walnuts and gorgonzola.

This was an excellent base for a cream sauce. I reduced the basic ingredients (except soy sauce) than added heavy cream and soy. Brought that up to temp. and served. I served it on a potabello mushroom cap, on top of that saffron rice and on top of that spinach with garlic. I then placed Chilean sea bass with the sauce drizzled on top. It was excellent.

We went a little heavy on the wasabi powder with the tuna but we like the heat and it was great. Reducing the sauce is a definite must.

I liked the recipe a lot, but agree that the sauce was too thin. I seared the tuna for 1 minute per side, and it was too cooked for our taste. I would do 30 seconds per side, plus a quick sear on the edges, if you like your ahi Hawaian style. My market carries flash-frozen sushi-grade ahi in vacuum packs. I defrosted it for half an hour in room temperature water, and it was as good as the fresh that is sometimes available. For a side dish, I served sauteed baby bok choy (split)and shitake mushrooms, which were quick and easy to prepare at the same time, and went well with the ahi.

Well, I found Ahi Tuna for 11.99 a pound at our local fish market. Three portions equal around twenty bucks. I didn't find this too bad, since it is a treat! I have always ordered this in a restaurant and was scared to try to make it myself. It turned out tender and delicious! I used red onion instead of green, and a little extra wasabi powder. I served this with small cut potatoes and onions that were sauteed in olive oil and garlic. Crusty bread a must! Also served this with a sweet pepper cold salad (similar to a cole slaw). It meshed well with the heat of the wasabi. Bon Appetite!

What's with ahi tuna in January? Six people tried this recipe in one month! This is a fabulous sauce and makes the fish irresistible.

This dish was wonderful! I adjusted the recipe according to other reviewer comments, and it came out beautifully. It has a pretty presentation and will definitely impress guests. It's also very filling as well. The cucumbers were the perfect contrast to the wasabi. I put the full 4 tablespoons in and didn't find it too hot. You definitely feel the wasabi but not uncomfortably so. I reduced the water to 1/3 but will probably reduce even further on future attempts since the sauce could've been just a little thicker. I reduced the soy sauce to 1/4 and didn't think it was salty at all, substituted canola oil for peanut oil since I didn't have any, and chucked the radish sprouts. Cooked the steaks for a little over 2 minutes on each side which barely missed being overcooked but was just right. Served with a big bowl of steamed white rice and stir-fried vegetables. The ahi (yellowfin tuna) was a bit expensive but I wouldn't try this dish with a lesser cut. Wonderful!

I served garlic mashed potatoes, sauteed veggies, and raspberry glace (to keep the palate cleansed). My guests gave it two forks up, and we don't even get along all that well. Just kidding.

I would agree with reducing the wasabi sauce on low heat for a few minutes, adding the onions last. And I would go so far as to suggest searing the Tuna for only 1.5 minutes.

This was a terrific dish. Couple of changes would be to minimize the Wasabe and Soya sauce or add a little lemon to take the edge for those not accustomed to the sharp finish of wasabe.

I can't fairly rate this recipe as written since I made so many adjustments to it, e.g. less water, less soy sauce, more Sherry, etc. However, one addition I made was excellent; that is, pickled ginger which I shredded (about 1 tablespoon).

This was an awesome meal. One thing we did different was to cut the wasabi in half. We used 4tsp in the receipe and 1tsp. for the plate, it was WONDERFUL!

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes. It works very well with a wide assortment of fish, not just tuna or salmon as previously stated. I'm betting chicken and steak will also be good (but then, I'm a wasabi nut)!

Me again. Needed to add the 4 forks!!! PS -- I didn't have peanut oil Regular vegetable oil worked just as well. And I got the wasabi pre-made in a little cup with sliced, cured ginger from a gournet market. Perfect!

We have made this several times already. It is one of the best tuna recipes. We have cut down the wasabi powder to 1 TBSP versus the 3 the recipe calls for. We found it a bit too much for our tastes.

This was delicious. I coated the tuna with toated sesame seeds. Make sure you use low salt soy sauce. I didn't and it was to salty, but still great. I also put the sauce in the pan after I took the tuna out and reduced it. My family loved this---a definate keeper!!!

Excellent - we've made this recipe twice and had rave reviews. Be careful not to overcook the tuna. Use a little less water in the sauce and reduce it down in the pan to your preferred consistency. Those who want the wasabi taste without as much bite should consider using less wasabi powder. We served this with a sticky Japanese style rice along with sugar snap peas.

If you reduce the water to 1/4 or 1/3 cup when mixing with the wasabi powder you actually get a smooth paste...if you use the full 1/2 cup it is extremely watery. Reducing the amount of water does make for a more potent wasabi taste, but it does not make the final sauce very thick. I put the sauce in the pan as a previous reviewer suggested and it thickened up beautifully. Serve it with steamed jasmine rice.

We loved this recipe. I did not add the sherry and it was not missed. I would definately make this again.

I am always searching for new and different ways to prepare a seared tuna dinner and my husband adored this spicy, unusual recipe! I substituted ground ginger with good results for fresh. One suggestion: to thicken the rather thin sauce, pour it all into the hot pan used to sear the tuna. This deglazing process will meld the flavors beautifully and provide a restaurant caliber unctuous sauce!

This is an excellent recipe. I made it for a group of 8 while on vacation in Diamond Beach, NJ. I was able to get a 8lb piece of fresh local tuna which I cut into 8- 2" thick 1lb servings. I made almost a quart of the sauce which everyone could'nt get enough of. I substituted Teriayki for the soy and doubled the amount of both green onions and minced ginger. I also served the dish with a short grain white rice, which I formed "domes" using a regular size tea cup. For presentation my 14 yr old son Tyler, garnished the rice with crisscrossed 4" pieces of the green onions. Can't wait to make it again.

i used grilled salmon instead of tuna and also made ginger, miso, cilantro sauce (from epicurious). with the salmon in the middle and the 2 sauces surrounding it, it made a nice presentation, and the contrast of flavors was very nice. i enjoyed the wasabi sauce more though. Very excellent recipe, and easy and quick too.

My Fiance and I absolutely LOVE this recipe. We are 20-somethings somewhat new cooks and were venturing out when we tried this. WOW were we impressed with ourselves. DO NOT OVERCOOK TUNA - it is delicious and if you get good fish, even anti-fish people will love it!! A KEEPER FOR SURE~!

Excellent sauce, I grilled my ahi instead of searing. To improve color wisk in a little soy sauce with the oil before cooking. To keep tuna from flaking (if you want to serve slices) let sit for 5 minutes after cooking then wrap tightly in single layer of plastic wrap and slice through using a very sharp knife - remove all plastic before serving.

This recipe was very well liked by the sushi-addicts that I made it for. The taste of tuna really shines through. The only problem I had was cutting the tuna. The seared portion kept flaking off the inside raw portion. Any suggestions?

I tried this with grilled salmon--done medium rare--and it was absolutely delicious, and made a stunning presentation.

I thought it was very good, and the people I cooked it for raved. I tried "A Cook from Buffalo's" idea of crusting it with sesame seeds, and some burned - lower heat slightly if you do that. Still looking for the perfect tuna recepie, but this works great 'till that comes...

Absolutely delicions. My family declared it better than anything they have had in a restaurant. Make sure you do not overcook the tuna. It must be rare inside.

Wasabi sauce is a little strong, but the overall flavor is very good.

I added too much wasabi powder in the sauce, but this dish still was fabulous. The tuna is best while still pink inside and the presentation was amazing. I substituted Madiera for the Sherry- no problem. A real crowd pleaser. Next time I will change by adding a sesame seed crust to the tuna steaks. YUM!

Just absolutely Delicious! You have to like wasabi though! I'd make it again in heartbeat!
