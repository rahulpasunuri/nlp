These rolls are really amazing. I have a few tips to share, though, which is mostly what I love about Epicurious- all the helpful reviews and tips! First, I let the dough rise in the bowl, but instead of baking once that was done, I put the bowl in the fridge. Freshly baked cinnamon rolls were to be a surprise for my son's birthday brunch and I wanted to serve them warm from the oven. That worked well without a problem. I just got them out the next morning, rolled them and placed them in the pan, and let them rise again in a warm oven before baking. Based on reviews I read, I baked them for about 10 minutes longer than the instructions stated. For me, this was not necessary. They may have needed 5 minutes more, but with 10 minutes the end result was that they were a little dry. I may just stick to the recipe this next time and see how that goes. Last, they were not gooey or syrupy at all. That seems like an easy fix next time, though. I plan to make more of the filling and not baking them as long should help keep everything more moist. My fiance whipped up some orange icing, which he and our boys loved (I prefer more of the cinnamon filling, myself). To conclude, this is a great recipe that produces delicious rolls and seems to withstand tweaking well. I'm making them again (twice in the space of two weeks... tells you they're good) for when our neighbors come for brunch on Sunday :)

I followed the recipe exactly, and they were amazing. Light and fluffy bread, with a nice buttery flavor and a deliciously gooey filling/topping. I've tried many cinnamon roll recipes, and this one is my new go-to recipe for sure!

I expected the sugar/butter mixture in these rolls, when baked, to result in the gooey, sticky, glazed texture of the best cinnamon pecan buns, but it retained it's granular texture. I also used half brown-sugar. Was anyone able to get that delightful gooey-texture? Or is this recipe not designed to achieve that? I'm thinking the sugar needs to be dissolved into the butter before it's spread onto the dough and baked. Anyone else have any thoughts/recommendations on this?

These cinnamon rolls are amazing and so easy to prepare. Instead of doing the pecans, I added walnuts and raisins to the sugar filling and subbed brown sugar for the regular sugar. Also, to save waiting time, I prepared the dough the night before and let it proof in the fridge overnight, the next morning I rolled it out. Will definitely make these again.

I've made these twice and both times I didn't properly read the part about saving butter mixture for the pan, so I had to scrape off the butter, and it wasn't so easy to spread it in the pan evenly. Also, my pan isn't big enough for all these buns so the 2nd time I cut them larger, but even with extra baking time they came out a bit doughy.

Rating: 4
These were really good although it did need additional bake time. I will definitely make them again but will leave them in a little bit longer. I found some of the rolls too doughy still.

Very yummy! I left the pecans out for a more simple roll, but i think next time i'll do half and half, mix it up a little. I decided to leave out half the butter when mixing up the filling, and i used while sugar in the dough, but all brown in the filling. since i cut down the butter, I had less of the sugar-butter-cinnamon mix. To compensate, i put all of the mix into the rolls as filling, and just sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on the bottom of the pan (no butter, but i did lightly grease the pans first). I want to try with raisins next time too (and there definitely will be a next time!).

Amazing!! Mind Blowing!! Definitely substitute half brown sugar and add a little vanilla to the sugar mixture! I've made these twice and if I didn't fear obesity, I'd make them every day. Great weekend treat and the leftovers are welcomed at the office.

I followed the dough recipe exactly, and next time I will use milk instead of water. Also I think 2 packets of yeast is too much, one should do it next time. I let my dough "proof" for an hour, and it was too much, so the rolls didn't rise in the oven like I would have liked. Overall, I will definitely make this again, I think the recipe has great potential once I get the kinks worked out (ie, over proofing). Whenever you make bread, you can't judge by the first time you make it, there are too many variables (temperature, humidity, age of flour etc.) other than the recipe that can drastically affect the outcome.

All I can say is wow. Read other reviews and did 1 cup brown sugar 1/2 white sugar and added a little vanilla. These were beautiful, fluffy, wonderful to wake up to Chirstmas morning. Set everything up the night before but didn't make til morming. Fabulous!

These are gorgeous!!my first Epicurious recipe and delicious. I actually halved the butter quantity, just couldn't bring myself to use so much and they have still come out absolutely fabulous. They only took about twenty minutes to cook in my oven though, if I had left them for the full time they would have been dry and overcooked.

GREAT recipe! It's even good if you want to freeze it and save them for later. I used candied pecans instead of regular, and it added a bit more crunch to it. The only problem I had with it was that it took a long time.

Rating: 4
The rolls came out crispy on the edges, gooey & hot on the insides; in a word: delicious! The ONLY thing I would do differently next time is make more of the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture. They seemed ever-so-slightly dry. Perhaps make half again as much?

Rating: 2
These turned out too hard and didn't rise, some of which could have been my fault due my having refrigerated the unbaked completed rolls overnight and I baked them the next day. As suggested in some reviews I subbed milk for water, and some of the sugar for brown. Some reviewers said they had success refrigerating overnight. My rolls never rose in the pan and didn't brown after 30 min. I left them in an extra 7 minutes to lightly brown. They came out of the pan easily when flipped over about 2 minutes after I removed them from the oven. In the future I will sample other cinnamon bun recipes because I didn't like this one, I thought it was overrated.

With minor modifications, beats Berkeley Gourmet Ghetto's Cheeseboard Pecan Rolls hands down! I used bread machine for kneading process. Used only 1 cup water, substituted 1 1/2 cups white whole wheat flour for white flour, 4 tsp dry yeast, used brown sugar as others advised for the topping, and rolled 1 cup yellow raisins into dough after rising cycle. Yielded 2 9" cake pans of rolls. Stored one tightly sealed in freezer. Other I put in fridge and baked next morning. When ready for next batch, I let defrost overnight in fridge, then baked. Cooked rolls store great in freezer and reheat in microwave/toaster oven. Delicious!

Great! I followed recipe exactly except I accidently put all the sugar mixture in the roll which worked just fine. I also did the half brown sugar and half regular sugar suggestion. I will make again. Yummy!

I have made these twice, and both times they came out delish! The only change I made was to substitute some brown sugar for some of the plain sugar. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. I baked them in a round cake pan. They are best straight out of the oven, but also good the next day after 10-15 seconds in the micro. As I doubled the recipe, there were extras and the mothers-in-law were fighting over them to take home for the next days breakfast. Delish! Delish! Delish!

Some of the best cinnamon rolls I've ever tasted...really! I took the advice of a fellow reviewer and instead of 1 3/4 cup of sugar, I did 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white. They turned out beautifully just the way the recipe was written.

This was a fairly easy recipe for me since I have never made these kind of rolls before. I made them once with the sugar butter mixture on the bottom but the second time I used brown sugar which everyone loved better.

I have to say that, although these were definitely tasty, they weren't anything amazing. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the butter in half-- maybe that was what kept them from being the dripping, greasy goodness that most cinnamon rolls are. I made a yummy cream cheese frosting & that kicked it up a few notches, but honestly, I'm not sure that I will be going through the effort of making these anytime soon.

These were excellent! I made a few little changes -- I used 1/2 cup of whole milk and a cup of water for the liquid, which I think made the rolls nice and moist. Next time I might even do a cup of milk to 1/2 cup of water. I also did a brown sugar/white sugar mix with the butter, and I think that the amount of butter listed in the recipe is just right, it makes a nice glaze for the rolls without even needing to do anything extra. I also did most of the work of these at night, rolled and covered them, and then baked them in the morning, and they turned out beautifully, and my guests raved.

These didn't rise much and I thought they were ok but not something I would make again. The dough was sort of course and not soft. Not my favorite recipe and I would not make them again.

I also changed the recipe to the brown/white sugar mixture described by the previous reviewer, but used the amount of butter mentioned in the original recipe. I should have listened to the other reviewers who said to use less butter -- it was absolutley too much! These cinnamon rolls turned out mediocre and I do not plan on using this recipe again, especially since there are simpler ones that turn out much better results. My sweet-toothed boyfriend was quite disappointed in these!

Rating: 4
I did as several others had suggested and changed the sugar a little. I used 1/2 cup sugar in the dough and 1 cup brown sugar in the cinnamon mixture. I wasn't sure how they would turn out since I made them the night before and put them in two 9" round cake pans, but they were AWESOME. My wife wouldn't let me share them with anyone. I kept out the pecans and found no need for extra frosting. These are a keeper!!!

Another 4 Forks for this recipe. It was super delicious! I brought it for a work party and was declared a rock star! I doubled it and it came out fine in 2 9x12 pans (with some scrapes in another pan, which I froze for later). I also used milk and added 2 eggs. I made the dough, rolled it out and sliced it and put it in the fridge the night before, let it warm up for about 45 minutes on the counter and cooked it the next morning. I can't wait to make this again.

Wonderful- I halved the recipe, and it still turned out great. I made everything on Christmas Eve, left it covered on the counter overnight and put them in the oven in the morning. Then we added maple icing (recipe on this website) YUM! And even better, they really weren't that much work and easily came out of the pan so cleaning up wasn't bad either.

Made for Christmas morning at the request of my 7-year old. I had never made cinnamon rolls before and these were not hard at all. I also used less butter and added raisins. Next time I may add some cooked apples to the middle. My only issue with this recipe is the odd pan size (which I didn't have)...so I used 2 springform pans instead and the butter oozed out onto the oven floor...next time I'll use foil around the pans. My family loved them!

Rating: 3
This is a very nice recipe although I made a few minor adjustments. I used milk like everyone else indicated and this worked well. I also halved the butter. And to make the rolls more "sticky" I added about a cup of dark brown sugar to the dough before rolling it up and another cup to the bottom of the pan. They have been a huge hit.

This recipe is easy, fast, and it tastes so great! I've made it with and without nuts, and either way is fantastic. I agree with many other reviewers - you certainly can use less butter in the recipes. I used half the amount of butter, and it still turned out great. I also added a lot more cinnamon and used milk instead of water in the dough. My husband loves this recipe. It's a keeper!

I made a revised version of the low cholesterol cinnamon rolls earlier this morning and raved,but this dough is just a smidgin better. I did use 1/3 cup russet potato puree that included a bit of the water. I also used mostly brown sugar and very heavy cinnamon. These will be my signature Christmas rolls (maybe with raisins). I also iced these as well as the others. Very decadent.

I have made these three times - work in a restaurant & brought them in - they were gone in minutes - all went off their diets!! I used the milk; brown sugar & put the butter on top & bottom also - they are to die for. I didn't make a frosting as I used half the butter for the top - I think it would have been too sweet. Made the night before & put in fridge covered in plastic - will make on Christmas morning & often!! YUMM!!!

These taste terrific a few minutes out of the oven. I found, however, that they dry out very quickly and the "sticky" caramel becomes virtually impossible to bite into. Am I doing something wrong? Would love some advice.

I used 2tsp of yeast and brown sugar instead of white. For a twist I also threw in some maple sugar (mmmm). I halved the amount of butter and used only 1/2-3/4 the amount of sugar, it was enough! Huge raves for these!

These buns were great, though I'm not sure that I made the dough according to the recipe--does anyone know how to quantify an "envelope" of yeast? I can only find it in bulk and had to guess as to the correct measurement.

We liked these a lot. I took good advice of other reviewers and went with milk and butter. Left out pecans. Agree butter in bottom of pan could be reduced too. Made 1/2 recipe, used dough hook for 6 mins, put 6 rolls in a round cake pan and left them in the fridge overnite. Left them on counter for 35 mins before baking. Turned out very well. I think these are best right out of oven, but one leftover rallied with a quick microwave blast the next day. All in all, pretty easy, and good.

I used finely chopped pecans for the whole thing, and warm milk instead of water for the initial yeast step, and these rolls turned out fantastic. The dough rises much faster for me than the recipe indicates, too. Everyone who's tried them loves them, and they definitely don't need icing.

I've been making cinnamon rolls Christmas morning as long as I can remember. I couldn't find my recipe, so naturally looked to epicurious and found this one. I now have a new recipe for cinnamon rolls. They were such a hit I had to make them again two days later since the kids were on vacation from school. Everyone raved about them. I didn't need parchment to get them out of the pan as another reviewer suggested. Suprisingly, they flipped right out of the pan. I too used milk instead of water and iced them with a confectioner's sugar icing. Definitely one of our new favorites

Oh, soooooo yummy! I was going to make these for Christmas breakfast, but ran out of flour. I'm so glad I decided to give them a try. I added a cream cheese icing, which made them superb. Made without nuts (due to an allergy), used milk and butter instead of water and oil. I used parchment on the bottom of the pan, simple to flip out and clean up. This is the cinnamon roll recipe I have been searching for! I'll be making these again soon.

This is my first time making cinnamon rolls since 7th grade home ec and I have to say I am very happy with the results! They are not too sweet so if you're a sweet tooth, you'll need frosting. I found that the cream cheese frosting from this site is a perfect complement.

Rating: 4
These are so amazing! They are a little time consuming, but are fairly easy to make. You MUST put icing on them however- This recipe doesn't come with an icing recipe, but I found one that calls for 4 cups of icing sugar, 1 stick of melted butter, 2tsp of vanilla and a touch of water to thin it out. You just add all the ingredients together and spread onto the slightly cooled buns. It makes a ton of icing so be prepared for a super sugar rush. Yum!

I made these this weekend for my family and it was a big hit. I did omit the pecans becuase my youngest daughter has some severe food allergies, but these were delicious topped with cream cheese icing. It's been very hard to find a good sweet bread recipie that didn't contain eggs, for the allergic one, that didn't come out tasting too yeasty and heavy.

I have to admit that I didn't try even one bite of these rolls, so I don't know how good they tasted. However, I made them for a PTA meeting and people haven't stopped talking about them! I didn't have pecans in the house, so I used walnuts, but that was my only change to this recipe. I guess I'll have to try some next time!

Excellent and very easy!! To have the rolls ready first thing in the morning, I prepared them up until the time where the buns are arranged in the pan & are covered in plastic wrap. I then refrigerated them overnight, let them rise 30 minutes in the morning, and baked! I also made a glaze of powdered suger & milk & drizzled it over the warm rolls. YUM!

HOLEEEEEE MONKEY, these are amazing. Even my boyfriend who isn't quick to give praise on excellent food beyond 'this is nice' said these rolls were 'incredible' with bulging eyes. I'm generally a slave to my KitchenAid stand mixer when it comes to yeast doughs, but these rolls were a snap to make entirely by hand and turned out delicious and beautiful. Following previous reviewers suggestions, I replaced the water with milk (1% b/c that's what I had), which made the dough delightfully tender. I also used 1 c light brown sugar and 1/2 cup white for the filling and upped the cinnamon by an extra 1/2 T. I sprinkled a bit of toasted pecans onto the butter-sugar filling on the pan, and they were PERFECT. No need for icing at all - to add some would detract from the nutty sweetness, I think. Since I didn't want to be up at the crack of dawn making these, I prepared them in advance up to the point of placing the cut rolls in the pan and covering them w/ film. Instead of letting them rise for 30 minutes right away, I put them in the fridge till I was ready to bake them. After removing them from the fridge, I let them sit at room temp until puffed and the filling was soft again. Then bake as directed. Perfect! Reheat the next day(s) for 20-30 sec

This was absolutely wonderful and I really appreciate all of you taking the time to provide your experiences. For those on the metric system I used 21 grams of the cake yeast.

This was a piece of home we don't have here and no one was disappointed!

These were delicious! Exactly hit the spot for a good, light, sweet cinnamon roll. I made a couple of changes by subsituting walnuts for pecans, and I used 3/4 brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar for the filling. Also, I spread the bottom of a cake pan with half the remaining butter mixture, put the rolls in there, melted whatever of the filling was leftover and put that on top. There was no need for icing at all.

These did not turn out well for me, but admittedly because I made a number of mistakes which I'll mention for the benefit of other baking novices: I doubled the recipe (not a good idea on the 1st try); over-kneaded (using my dough hook on my kitchenaid mixer) so the dough was tough; also probably added too much flour because it was sticky); and didn't put the rolls close enough together in the pan so that the spirals spread apart and turned out hard and crispy. I'm tempted to give this recipe another shot (given its high rating), but it was awfully time-intensive for such a disappointing result.

I use to make cinnamon rolls every Christmas Eve when my children were small. Now they are adults and have children, they asked that I make then again. Since I lost my old recipe, I new epicurious would have one. I agree with the others, this is an excellent recipe. I also, used milk in place of the water, eleminated the pecans, and made a powder sugar icing. Delicious!

Delicious! I am not great at bread making, but I followed the suggestion of using the kitchen aid for 8 minutes with the dough hook, and it was excellent! My mom used to do the filling in steps: butter, then cinnmon/sugar the filling -- that is what I will try next time, as the filling was difficult to spread. Otherwise, a keeper for Christmas morning at my house. I found them to be very sweet -- frosting was not at all necessary.

This recipe took quite a bit of time, but made the most incredible rolls. They were absolutely delicious. I used butter for the oil and added vanilla to the filling mixture.

Simple and satisfying! These cinnamon rolls are a snap to make and always a hit with my family and friends. I get asked about this recipe everytime I make them. There's no need to buy cinnamon rolls when you have the best recipe right here- and they're homemade with love! Just one hint though- make a frosting for the rolls. I use a creamed butter, 10X, water/milk, vanilla and some flour for my frosting. Definitely a guilty pleasure but every bit worth it! Thanks epicurious for such a great recipe.

I changed the recipe to incorporate some of the hints below, so this is "my" version. I don't own a 15X10X2 pan so I used cake pans. 1-1/2 cups warm milk 105-115F 3/4 cup white sugar,1 cup light brown sugar 2 envelopes rapid rise yeast 1 T veg. oil, 1 t vanilla 1 t salt 4 cups all purpose flour, plus more for kneading 2 eggs 2 sticks unsalted butter, room temp 2 T ground cinnamon butter 2 8" round pans, line with parchment, butter parchment Mix yeast in with white sugar, salt, and flour. Add oil and vanilla to warm milk, add half of liquid to flour mix. work quickly into a dough, add remainder of liquid. Add eggs, one at a time. Knead dough until soft and elastic,. Let dough rise in oiled bowl about 15 minutes. In the meantime, beat butter and brown sugar to blend. Roll out of press dough into 16X10" rectangle. Spread with half the butter mixture, trying to leave a plain border 1/2" all the way around. Roll up, pinch seans, cut crosswise as in original. Cut into 12 equal pieces, or as many as will fit in the pans you are using. Spread remaining butter mix on bottom of pan(s). arrange rolls cut side down. Cover and let rise 30 minutes. Bake at 325 for 35-40 minutes. Invert from pan while still hot.

This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls so I followed the recipe as printed but used the dough hook on my KitchenAid mixer and kneaded for about 8 minutes. They turned out wonderful and I will definitely make them again.

I make these rolls almost weekly. My family likes to have them made into Monkey bread, or a cinnamon loaf. I have made some adjustments. I use brown sugar for the filling, and extra cinnamon. My husband does not like pecans, so I ommit those. I do find that the bread does not have a lot of strength, and will collapse once taken from the pan, but we don't care, we keep eating them.

Truly Wonderful! Made these without pecans (have had too many sticky bun recipes lately) and they turned out delicious! Added a basic white icing when they came out of the oven-- added to the look and the taste! My husband was SO happy to start his day with these delectables! Will make these a staple for brunches/breakfasts with guests.

These were delicious! Very, very light and delicate dough, and a good cinnamon-sweet flavor. The friends I made them for raved. I made a few changes suggested by readers--I used skim milk in place of water, and added 2 eggs to the dough. I found I had to add quite a bit of extra flour while kneading. The only part I had troulbe with was rolling the dough up. I found it stuck to my board a bit, and since I hadn't punched it down, it was a bit unwieldy to roll up tightly/seal. Still, once I crowded them into the pan, they held their shape and I don't think anyone noticed in the end!

Rating: 4
These turned out great. I substituted milk for the water and used 2 eggs, and about 1/2 cup more flour because the dough was sticky. I did the kneading with the dough hook in my mixer and it worked great. I didn't like the fact that the sugar mixture on top of the rolls was still somewhat granular after baking and I think this may have been because my butter wasn't soft enough when I mixed all the ingredients together. I found these to be a little too sweet for my taste and will probably omit the topping next time and just use a cream cheese frosting. I will also try brown sugar. The parchment idea worked extremely well. The dough itself is light and fluffy and not sweet, which I like.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe with some changes. Added 2 eggs, used milk instead of water, added 1 cup more flour. I mixed half brown sugar and half granulated sugar with the cinnamon but spread the butter on the dough then sprinkled the sugar mixture. My tip: Line your pan with foil and then a sheet of parchment to have all the gooey wonderfulness come out without a penetrating deep clean to the tin. Heaven.

I added two eggs to the recipe, and a little cream to boot. They turned out rather temptingly delectable, being a resounding success with my siblings, who were the taste testers. I also added a wee bit more cinnamon. The texture was little like brioche. They were also sufficiently moist. I used a touch more pecans than called for in the recipe, added that to the one cup butter called for in the recipe, and brown sugar (7-8 tablespoons) for the filling. I think that I shall have to go on the treadmill at an incline of 9, speed of 4.0 for at least an hour. Ah well, live well, eat well, exercise well. The fragrance of wafting cinnamon is very pleasant, and restorative especially in the morning.

This was my first time making pecan rolls. I did it for food day in our office. Everyone said they were really good. They were not buttery enough for my taste but that could be easily solved. I had no problem adding more flour to the dough to be able to knead it. I added probably a cup more for it to stop being sticky. Then they rose beautifully I used 1 pkg of a quick rise - Red Star and another package of active yeast - Flieshmans. It was one of my better bread rises by mixing the different yeasts. Also helped that I let the bread rise in closet that had floor vent so it was warm. Definatly make it again and maybe do a variation like add slices of ham and cheese for an appetizer in lieu of a sweet treat. Best of luck to all!

After reading the previous reviews I did the following: I used milk instead of water, and butter instead of oil. I did not use eggs. I used rapid rise yeast by mixing the yeast into the dry ingredients, heating up the milk and butter to 120o and then mixing the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. I kneaded the dough for exactly 10 minutes being careful to minimize flour additions. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes, and then roll out and cut into rolls and place in pan to rise for one hour. The rolls were excellent! Using rapid rise yeast cuts down the time to make these in half. I phoned the Fleishman Yeast customer care representitive (1-800 number on the back of the package) due to my first batch not rising. These were the instructions she gave me. The rolls were not too sweet, were light and fluffy, and were gobbled up by my husband and my three year old by the end of the day.

These were awesome! The only reason I didn't give them 4 forks is because they didn't turn out looking very pretty. These really were great! but next time I will probably use less of the butter mixture. They just didn't need all of it...

This was my first time making rolls with yeast. The results were good. I omitted the pecans, becuase my husband doesn't like them. Next time I will do half and half! The directions were easy to follow. My rolls seemed to be a little flatter than I would have hoped. The dough was quite sticky when I started kneaading. Used a cream cheese icing, but I didn't put enough sugar in it. Took a while to make them, but I will definitely try this recipe again when time allows. Also, I might try making the rolls ahead of time, and refrigerating before baking.

Great recipe. Wonderful light texture. I put 1/3 cup sugar into the yeast rather than just 1/4 cup since some folks felt the dough was not sweet enough. Also, I used the tip about lining the baking pan with parchment. It made getting these out of the pan a snap. Once cool, I easily fit them back into the pan to be re-warmed and served in the morning to my bible study class. I would guess the folks who called these dense and chewy either under-kneaded or added to much flour. I used the "dough" setting on my bread machine for the kneading. It kneaded for 20 minutes or so. The dough formed a nice ball, but was pretty sticky to handle. I would have had a hard time kneading it by hand without adding lots more flour. as it was I probably added another half cup - but this is in Houston in the summer where humidity is the name of the game. I was planning to make a cream cheese frosting (a la cinnabons) to pass with the rolls, but these don't need a thing. I also filled half the rolls with raisins and the other half with pecans so as to please those in my family caught up in the nut/no nut schism.

I completely agree with the cook from Dallas. While the dough rose nicely and was easy to work, the reulsting rolls were touch and chewy. I'd sure like to find a better recipe (a la Cinnabon).

Although this recipe was very easy to make, I found it to be rather bland. The pastry itself seemed to lack sufficient sweetness and flavor. I would not make this again.

ohmygosh, these are awesome! I made these as is except I mixed chopped walnuts with the pecans- will always do that! I made them for my women's Bible study and got rave reviews. Some of the gals were saying these were the best cinnamon rolls they had ever had. It was at a Bible study (I don't think they were lying)

Actually I have not yet tried this recipe but while I was reading the reviews I came up with Melanie's question from Manila asking the amount of the dry yeast envelopes and found out that the active dry yeast envelopes are only 1/4 ounces. So I hope Melanie will read this and give it another try as she loved the recipe.

I really just can't believe how great this was! I kept talking and talking about it days later (of course there were no leftovers by then). Big hit with my friends for brunch. Served this with one of those sausage/cheese/bread bakes. I wouldn't say it's easy to make, but it was certainly fun. I made it with a simple glaze (confectioner's sugar and milk). I'm not even a baker and I'm usually intimidated by recipes with yeast, but this was easy to follow. Sure beats Cinnabon! Can't wait to make it again - just stocked up on some pecans on sale.

The butter-cinnamon-sugar spread is delicious, but the rolls are too dense and chewy. This recipe would be better if milk and eggs were used in the dough.

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe. I was worried about the previous comments about it being too sweet and the dough being to tough. I thought it was just perfect. I used nearly 5 cups of flour by the time I was done kneading the dough, which took over 20 minutes to get just sorta smooth. I baked the rolls on a piece of foil, which made the last step much easier for clean-up.

(This is my mother's user name) I am 13 years old. My mom & I made these for my Dad. I did NOT like them. They were more like sticky buns than cinnamon rolls, and they were SOOOOO sweet. I have a major sweet tooth, too. I am 13 & I thought they were sweet, I think thats a major hint. They were easy to make, we even made a powdered sugar glaze for them. We left out the pecans (b/c I don't like them :). I would definitely not make these again, in fact we threw the printed recipe out after we threw the extra rolls out.

OH....MY....GOSH!!! These are one of the best things I have ever cooked in my ENTIRE life! They were so fabulous! Who needs a boyfriend when you have these!!!! :-) Yumm...I ALWAYS have trouble whenever I make rolls or biscuits and they always taste odd or fall apart or whatever but when I flipped these over, I was at a loss for words! They looked better than the ones at the most delectable of bakeries! We were out of pecans so I made them with walnuts (which I like better) and they were great. The secret of these is in the pan spreading and the cinnamon butter (I'm going to try that on some toast tomorrow ---SO yum!). They were rather time consuming, but most of the time was spent waiting. I made them for Mother's Day and had to stay up all night to start them at 3:30 AM. Either way they were worth it! This is the type of thing that can inspire me to pursue a career in cooking- YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Sorry i'm so enthusiastic they are just so delish!)

I cannot remember having had a better cinnamon roll. No one in my family likes nuts except me so I left them out. I made a powdered sugar glaze and drizzled it over the top. I will make these again.

We have homemade cinnamon rolls every year on Christmas morning, this has become the recipe we will use. My entire family loves them and my fiance asks me to make them for him on a regular basis now. They are wonderful and suprisingly easy to prepare.

These rolls were easy to make. The recipe was easy to follow. The rising and baking times were perfect and the results were the very best cinnamon rolls I have ever had. I served them at Easter Brunch and everyone RAVED!

I really loved the recipe -- only I found that my estimation of the amount of yeast wasn't all that accurate. I would love to make it again though, could someone help me with this -- the amount used in the recipe in grams or ounces or teaspoon/tablespoon unit would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.

I made these this morning to bring to work, there was quite a bit of effort involved but well worth it! Total time to make was about 3 hours. I tried to make the cinnamon butter filling the night before and it became dense and hardened, so I don't recommend prepping that ahead of time. I also lined the pan with parchment paper before placing the rolls into it, it made it easy to follow the last step (flip the rolls onto another pan). With the parchment, I lifted the rolls out and flipped them right back into the same pan. I used walnuts which tasted great and next time will use more filling.

Easy to make! This recipe is more convenient than some yeast breads in that the dough is refrigerated and you don't have to punch it down and fight with the dough to shape it. Very good when the rolls are warm; they aren't as good at room temperature.

These were delicious. The butter mixture didn't carmelize like I expected it to though. It remained rather crumbly. Any ideas as to why and how I can correct it?

I felt like these rolls had potential for greatness, so there are a few things I would change when I make it next time. I used the suggestions for making a softer dough (eggs, butter, and milk), but found that the rolls were a little too bread-like, so I might adjust the ingredients or try the recipe as is next time. I might also use more filling and a cream cheese frosting, as well as some cardamom in the filling. Despite all that, I thought these were good and enjoyable to make, and I look forward to making them again with some changes.

¡Me quedaron deliciosos! Los he hecho una y otra vez. Hago los roles en la noche y sin hornear los meto en el refrigerador cubiertos con una bolsa de plástico. Al día siguiente los saco media hora antes de hornearlos. Crecen igual y me doy el gusto de llevarlos calientes a la mesa.

I made these for our Fourth of July celebration, and they were absolutely raved about by our guests! I followed the advice of the cook from Kansas City and altered the dough recipe as suggested (using milk, butter and eggs instead of the water and oil). I did, however, use quite a bit more of the filling than they suggested - at least double. Although a time consuming task, these are more than worth the effort! Absolutely incredible.

This is by far the BEST cinnamon rolls I have ever made. I've made it at least 6 times in the last 6 months, and each time they disappear. I add more cinnamon to the dough, use walnuts instead of pecans, and top them with a cream cheese frosting. PERFECTION!

For a softer roll, you might try changing the basic ingredients in the recipe to these: l cup scalded milk, cooled to 105-115 degrees; 1/2 cup melted butter; cut the sugar to 1/2 cup; two eggs,room temperature; and use at least 4 cups of flour. For the filling, use only 1/2 cup softened butter, 1 1/2 cups dark brown sugar, mixed with 2 1/2 Tbsp of cinnamon.

I made this cinnamon rolls with raisin instead of pecans and I used more cinnamon (1/3 cup). I would definitely do this recipe again (this is the second time in a week).

I'm definitely a beginner, but these were pretty easy to make and turned out to be delicious. I had the same problems as another person, though, with the rolls being a little bit tough--less flour might help that. Next time, I'm also planning to add a little bit of sugary icing. I definitely recommend this recipe!

I made this recipe for a co-worker's birthday. The cinnamon rolls were gone within an hour. Instead of using 1-1/2 cups sugar for the filling, I used 1 cup sugar and a 1/2 cup brown sugar. It turned out great. I would definitely recommend this recipe.

Yummy cinnamon buns!!! The texture of the rolls was a little dense. Anyone have any idea what I might have done wrong? Too much flour? Not enough kneading?
