Followed recipe...my kitchen smelled wonderful while it was simmering! I was tempted to add some spices, but didn't (and am glad I didn't)... the wonderful combination of the plums and apples was all that was needed. Delicious! My husband and I felt like we were having a fabulous dessert, yet it was so simple.

I didn't strain it, just picked out the apple skins. I substituted cherries for plums and used orange juice instead of water. My parents and the kids ate and loved it both warm and cold.

I didn't bother straining it and it is still really delicious. Tastes perfect and so simple.

this is yummy. it tastes like the inside of an apple pie since we are eating it warm. my 3 year old is on his third bowl. the cooking time seemed right to me. i put it through a ricer which worked great for getting the skins out.

Very nice and very easy. It did take much longer than 1-1/4 hours and I removed the lid because more moisture than wanted was being created. The plums from our tree are golden/red and I used apples from one of our trees (not sure which variety - hard to tell but similar to McIntosh); the color was really wonderful. I also added about 1 Tbs of boiled cider to enhance the flavor and the end result was amazing. It will be good with roasts but all by itself is fine with us

This was a very simple recipe, with a delicious outcome. I liked the minimal prep of the fruit, although this resulted in extensive time forcing it through a sieve after cooking. The applesauce is a beautiful color, has a smooth consistency, and has a more sophisticated blend of flavors than traditional applesauce.

Needed to cook alot longer to decrease all the liquid. After i put it through the strainer, I cooked it at least an hour more.Yummy

I used fresh prunes, omitted the sugar, and added a squeeze of lemon. So rich and yummy!!! Would be great with ice cream, on pancakes, with yogurt... I let it simmer a looong time, and it has a very creamy, caramely flavor.
