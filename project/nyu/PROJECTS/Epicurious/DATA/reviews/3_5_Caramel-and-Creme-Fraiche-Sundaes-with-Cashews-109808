I was finally successful at making caramel sauce - so it was that easy. Flavors very rich, combination excellent and taste NOT store bought. I'll make again for a special occasion.

This is a wonderful recipe. The ice cream has a mellow caramel taste and the nuts and caramel topping were fantastic!
