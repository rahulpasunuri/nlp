Slightly disappointed as well! I've cooked oxtail before and have never had a problem with the rich and buttery meat falling off the bone; this recipe was the frustrating exception. I braised the oxtails for hours and the meat was extremely difficult to extract. I returned the meat to the pot to braise further which made a marginal difference. Next time I will use beef short ribs. Fabulous taste but, the desired texture eluded me.

Really disappointed . Not sure whether I should blame the recipe or my butcher. In retrospect it seems as if many of the other cooks substituted another meat type for the oxtail which really turned out to their advantage in my opinion. I slow cooked the ragu for hours expecting the meat to fall off like osso bucco and shortly before serving it became apparent that this was not going to happen making it essentially a vegetarian ragu in beef stock. Not one bit of meat came away and I actually got the oxtail over two butchers so not sure where the Amish butcher got his ox? My guests said the ragu was very tasty though so I might make again but w/ a different cut of meat. Oh yeah - I also chickened out on the unusual gnocchi preparation and went traditional potato/egg/flour and boiled before serving.

Fabulous oxtails! I didn't make the semolina gnocchi, just served over polenta and the leftovers with store bought gnocchi. Will try the semolina next time.

I substituted oxtails (too expensive) with pork shoulder (.69 cents per pound), and it came out great. I found that refrigerating overnight allowed the fat to be skimmed off easily. The gnocchi was too soft, and I wont be trying that again.

My cousin and I made this recipe while house bound on a rainy day. We purchased our oxtails from an Amish butcher sight unseen. You can imagine our surpise to find our oxtails uncut. They were trimmed beautifully and required very little fat skimming at the end of cooking. We thoroughly enjoyed this dish as did our guests. We would not change the recipe at all and will purchase oxtails from the Amish butcher in the future.

I am making this for the second time tonight for tomorrow. I could not find oxtail, so I used beef shank the first time around and it turned out great. Today I am making it with chuck roast as a stew - we loved the taste the first time around. I am also making the gnocchi for the second time. Yes, they look like polenta, but they are much, much tastier. Just our style comfort food.

I tried this with beef stew meat instead of oxtails. It did not come out too greasy as the other reviewer wrote with this substitution. Like he did, I thought the gnocchi turned out a lot like polenta. I will make the ragu again. It was tasty.

What a mess. Considering the fact that this calls for $25.00 worth of oxtail, it is not worth the effort. Not to mention the fact that the "gnocchi", if you want to call it that, cooked into something like creamy polenta, this dish was a total failure. It comes out of the oven like a plate of shepherd's pie, but with too much grease. You're better off trying it with a brisket, the oxtail has way too much fat and the meat does not come out it nice little pulled-beef sections like in the picture, but little fatty marbles of meat that, while tasty, do not go down very well. Overall, while the flavors were nice, this thing was a disaster. Whoever wrote this recipe owes my about $40 and 4 hours of my life. Zero forks.
