I was looking for a quick, simple dipping sauce to go with Hundred Corner shrimp balls. This sauce was the perfect answer. Add some green onions and it's great with tofu. Ginger is a great addition as well!

I made a version of this...not realizing that sambal was hot chili oil until later. But I added hot chili oil and Sriracha anyway b/c I like things spicy. Something wasn't perfect about this dipping sauce, next time I'd add some ginger or garlic I think.
