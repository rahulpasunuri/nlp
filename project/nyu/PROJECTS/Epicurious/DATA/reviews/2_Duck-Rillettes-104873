an appallingly stupid recipe... rillettes are what you do with leftover scrap meat (duck or pork). i can't even begin to say all that's wrong with this recipe.

The whole point of this recipe is that it is a LOW-FAT hors d'oeuvre. Use the duck fat if you want, but it defeats the purpose of this particular recipe. ;)

Mmm, what a way to cook a corpse!

I would like to echo the comments of the other reviewers -- this is an appalling use of duck and a complete misunderstanding of rillettes. The whole point is to essentially braise and preserve the meat in its own fat. Never, NEVER discard duck fat. Yukon gold potatoes roasted in duck fat are one of the most wonderful things on the planet.

I am stunned that they would suggest discarding duck fat. Duck fat is the most wonderful thing in the world! And adding gelatin? Should not be necessary. I was looking for a good recipe for rillette, but I don't think I shall find it here.

I eat dead things all the time. Liked this very much. Good recipe!

There is no substitute for flavour, and fat is flavour. This recipe is wrong! Use the legs not the breasts (save them for a lovely sauté or pan roasting) render the fat and use to cook the meat and all the bones together. Use less water (1/2 cup max) and a long slow cooking under a layer of duck fat will produce all the gelatin you will need to set a beautiful rillettes. I put the finished mixture in a loaf pan and slice it when set. Wrapped in plastic and frozen they will keep for six months. Put some in ramekins and add a layer of duck fat to seal it and it will keep for 2-3 weeks (not days) until you break into it. Remember this was how meat was preserved in the old days before refrigeration.

I agree with San Fran. What's wrong with the word "carcass"? If you have a problem with dead meat, don't eat it. Me, personally, I tend to like it.

American Heritage defines carcass as: "The dead body of an animal, especially one slaughtered for food." Seems pretty accurate to me. It's also the term used by professionals in the food industry to refer to the bones left. Why eat meat if you can't deal with death?

To the cook from Phoenix: Do you have a better suggestion if you think carcass is not to your liking? How about 'skeleton'.. Really!

Call me crazy, but isn't the word "Carcass" just one of those few words that should not be used to describe something that you plan on serving to people you actually like???
