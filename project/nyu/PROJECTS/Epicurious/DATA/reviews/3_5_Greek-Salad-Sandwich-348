Just had this for supper and my family raved and asked me to make it again. I followed the recipe, except used dry basil. Will try the fresh if I get to growing my own. We picked up warm fresh pita from the Arab bakery around the corner just before dinner -- yum!!! Even my picky picky teenager couldn't thank me enough for making something she actually likes! My 3yo ds loved it and so did dh. A perfect quick and healthy summer supper. I'll try it with a little diced chicken next time to make it more substantial -- this barely fed 4 of us and I'm sure a double recipe would've disappeared just as quickly.

A really nice break from heavy winter foods, even though you have to use greenhouse tomatoes. I used grape tomatoes cut in half, substituted oregano for the basil, and added a little chopped green and red pepper...wonderful

This is easy, light, healthy and delicious. Every time I make it the guests go back for seconds and comment on how good it is. This is a perfect summer lunchtime sandwich.

This is a delightful recipe. I thought it might be dry but it wasn't and I had to go back for seconds. The fresh basil and dressing made the vegetables sing. My husband added seasoned cooked chicken for a heavier dish. We both loved and and I'll be making this for my mother-in-law, a hard to impress foodie.

This really is a great "lite" dinner. Very easy and very good. I'd personally like more olives, but everything else was perfect!

This was good, but very messy. Next time, I think I will just make this as a salad, and have the pita on the side. I also added some sliced green pepper.

Loved it!!! A nice change of pace from deli and grilled cheese sandwiches!

This is my idea of a really delicious salad, no lettuce (which I dislike intensely)and it has all the ingredients that I especially like in a salad. Of course, the dressing just lights it up!
