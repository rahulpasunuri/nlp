Fabulous recipe! Won over those that were not fans of brussel sprouts. I left out raisins and vinegar because of crowd. Definitely use a cast iron pan and cut the brussel sprouts in half, the larger ones in quarters even. If leaves fall off - no worries! Toss them in. Must brown at first. Be sure to cook a bit longer in the broth if you like tender sprouts. You won't be disappointed! Devine!

Terrific recipe; cuts the earthy bitterness of the sprouts very well. I didn't find the sprouts crunchy--perhaps I cooked them a bit longer before adding the shallots and cranberries (someone had brought a bag of 50% reduced sugar dried cranberries to our house for a salad, and they worked out very well). I didn't have any stock on hand, so I substituted a half cup of chicken bouillon and didn't add any salt. My husband and I had these as a complete dinner with a baguette, and it was great!

I love this recipe. I follow the recipe exactly and serve it with lamb stew and polenta. Yum.

Fantastic recipe! The touch of vinegar at the end is essential. I used dried cranberries (had them on hand) and added some candied pecans (lightly toasted in skillet, then add some brown sugar and salt for long enough to melt sugar). I layered the bacon and pecans over the dish to serve. Some of the sprouts I bought were quite small, so I left some whole. I preferred the halved ones because they had more browning and tenderness.

I LOVE Brussels sprouts but sadly did not love this recipe. I've made them a million times with bacon, thought I'd try this recipe. They were quite crunchy. I prefer a softer Brussel. If you like a crisp Brussel these are for you. If I were to make again, for the flavours of bacon, vinegar, and raisins, I would steam the Brussls first.

I used black raisins instead of golden, and smoked duck instead bacon, but otherwise made as given, and it was superb--best Brussels recipe I've made.

I'm normally not a fan of B. sprouts, but I couldn't stop eating this. The vinegar, raisins, and bacon pretty much covered the mustard-y undertaste of the sprouts (which is the part I don't like). I doubled the bacon. The sprouts lovers went ape over this, too. I'd definitely make it again!

This was a BIG hit at Thanksgiving. I added a cup of chopped Marcona almonds when I added the bacon and vinegar. It gave the dish a little more texture and I recommend it.

Made this for our first family Thanksgiving experience with Brussels sprouts and they are now my husband's new favorite veggie. I doubled the recipe and used cranberries instead of raisins to keep it festive - it was delicious!

Made this for a fall Sunday dinner. All the foodies in the family raved about it. Just the right balance of salty and sweet; used Applewood bacon and it was superb. Also used very tiny sprouts and did not cut them in half. Like this recipe because the sprouts don't have their flavor boiled away.

This recipe is pretty good but nothing beats keeping it simple. Brussels with olive oil, salt pepper roasted in the oven are much better than this. That said not worth the extra effort here.

I'd always been affraid to make these because of the brussel sprout reputation and the few times I'd tried them at holiday gatherings. These are amazing! No leftovers. Really glad I took a chance on them.

These brussel sprouts are absolutely amazing! Every single time I make these baby cabbages, I can't stop eating them. I don't use a shallot and I use red raisins. This doesn't affect the recipe badly in any way. When I'm browning the sprouts, I end up putting about 2 teaspoons extra olive oil on them just so they brown up a bit better. As a side note: even though it's known that it's easy to overcook brussel sprouts, when and if they are overcooked, it isn't bad at all. Enjoy!

We've brought a few brussel sprout haters over to the dark side with this one. This has become my go to recipe for cooking brussel sprouts. Saute, then simmer....YUM!!! With the bacon, without...always delicious.

Wonderful and so easy! I made it for the third time last night - it's become one of my husbands favorites. Cooking time is a bit longer than indicated.

Very nice recipe. I used more bacon than called for (once you have the bacon opened, you might as well cook it all up, right?) and sliced the sprouts rather than halfing them. An excellent dish, with many compliments, but I think it would have been just as good without the bacon.

Very good but the cooking time was a bit longer than indicated.

Love it. I didn't have raisins or the right kind of vinegar so I threw in some dates and balsamic vinegar and it was fantastic.

Absolutely delicious! The tartness of the sprouts with the sweetness of the raisins combined with the salty round flavor of bacon is fantastic. Yum!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic and enjoyed by the company. There were many, many positive comments and requests for the recipe. The only thing I added was a 1/4 cup of pine nuts. Brussel Sprouts with Bacon and Raisins is a definite must on your culinary list.

I subscribe to Bon Apétit and enjoy going to Epicurious.com for recipes and inspiration for recipes I create. I made this recipe on several occasions. Once with salmon and another with meatloaf. Both times I enjoyed or I should say, we enjoyed the dish. I enjoyed the savory caramelized flavor mixed with the saltiness of the bacon, sweetness of the golden raisins and the offset acid taste of the cider vinegar. Using a thick sliced apple wood smoked bacon adds to the wonderful flavor of the Brussels sprouts as well as not over cooking them. Cooking them until they are tender crisp will do the trick. If they are over cooked they become mushy and release the sulphurous odor which most people object to and are turned off by eating these little gems. Cook away and taste as you go. Season well and you will have a delightful side dish that will please the pallet of the most finicky person.

This was my second time I made this recipe an I can't recomend it enough. I am a brusel sprout fan and this was one ofthe best. One note as I usely do I brined my sprouts with a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar for several hours after triming and halving them. I found myself eating the brussel sprouts and ignoring the rest of my meal. This will be my go to brussel sprout recepits from now on.

Made the receipe with and without the bacon and it was still great. Slow cooking is the key to bringing out the sweet smokiness of the brussels sprouts. I slice the large ones twice for even cooking.

My husband loves Brussels Sprouts so I was excited to see this new recipe. It is very easy to prepare and he LOVED it! I reduced my broth to a glaze with the raisins and then added in the other ingredients. I think that probably made the flavors even better.
