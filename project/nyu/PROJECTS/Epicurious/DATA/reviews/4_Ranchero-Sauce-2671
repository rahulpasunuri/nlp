This was too watery hence needed more boilling down. It was also a bit too spicy for my taste but that can be adjusted. It was just OK. I won't make it again.

I've made this twice and both times it has been great. It's a keeper!

I have looked for years for a traditional ranchero sauce. For some reason, nothing online I have found is as perfect a balace of flavors as this recipe. I added a couple extra garlic cloves and would probably add more spice to this, but it is PERFECT as is.

I love this recipe! We used to go to a cheap mexican place and spend alot of money on rancheros sauce. But now we can make it and it is cheaper. Except for the halapenos are horrible! DONT ADD THEM EVER!

A delicious sauce, so easy to make. I'm making it again today for a Fiesta Party, to serve with smoked chicken. A great combo!

This sauce is great over a shredded very slow/low cooked pork tenderloin! I experiment by substituing other mexican pepper for the green pepper. EXCELLENT LOW CARB SAUCE!

I cover shredded beef burritoes with this and top with manchego cheese & bake. This is a great sauce.

Very good sauce. I also added oregano and some chopped green chiles in a can to it. This added more zip.

So fast and easy to make. Loaded with flavor for such a simple recipe. I serve it with chile rellenos and get raves every time.

This recipe is the closest in taste to a similar the dish served at my local Mecican resturant but with out the fat. I love this recipe and will make it once a week.
