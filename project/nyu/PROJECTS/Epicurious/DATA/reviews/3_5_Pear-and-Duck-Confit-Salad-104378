This was awesome. Mail-ordered duck from Hudson Valley, but I'm that I could find them in Chicago. Did shred the legs and used half the dressing and the greens--there were only two of us. We burned the pecans because of a misunderstanding of the recipe. We had this for a main course.

Made this for last evening...... took the entire week as I did the confit from scratch .... not bad, but not terrific! However, the dressing was absolutely delicious, toasted pistachios instead of pecans. and used a whole bunch less salt; made sure to use ripe, ripe red pears, and a Good EVOO, with a decent Sherry Vinegar. Did not do the blue cheese as thought it was too much of a conflagration of flavours,.............. the ultimate compliment was very clean plates after this first course. Served a 'big' white which really helped with the richness of the duck. I also think the dish prospers from a texture 'crunch', and thus offered guests very thin breadsticks. I was pleased with the overall result, and I think my guests were also but, all in all, I think it a very labor intensive/product expensive dish, that was not immediately obvious BUT, that begs the question, why do we do this??? I love the the whole process of being able to please my guests with an appetizing dish.......... and I am now thinking I need to apologize for the length of this review!!!

This was a fantastic recipe. I purchased duck confit legs from our local market, and served them whole, instead of shredded, with a mix of all 3 greens -- frisee, watercress, and baby spinach.

Great salad, though I normally omit the blue cheese.

I also bought my duck confit already prepared from a small market butcher. I made this once with blue cheese and found it a little strong so this time I used a fabulous stilton-cheddar. Instead of buying pecans I used pistachios which which I already had in the house. I agree with the other comments about the vinaigrette. Any combination of GOOD oil and GOOD vinegar will work. I also added some maple syrup to the sherry vinegar.

Excellent salad. Substituted almonds for pecans, worked well. Substituted balsamic and dessert wine instead of sherry vinegar. Don't worry if nuts are almost burned, that works well with the other strong flavours.

I simplified this by doing just the salad and duck confit, and added pomegranate seeds to make it a little festive. I always alter vinaigrette recipes until I get it just to my liking (ususally 4 portions of any variety of oils to every portion of mustard/vinagar/lemon combo). It was simple, elegant, delicious and got rave reviews from all of my guests. Will definitely do it again.

I agree with the one rating that found the dressing a little flat, but I did use sherry vin, but also added a few tablespoons of fresh OJ and a teaspoon of minced orange zest. Combined with plenty of salt having the one medium shallot sliced into rings, the salad turned out really great. I used some french goat cheese instead of bleu, personal preference, but definitely something that will happen again. Enjoyed a heaping salad with a glass of red, some bread with a little extra goat cheese with some herbs and salt. A fine meal.

This is an excellent salad. All of the ingredients are pretty tasty to begin with, and when assembled like this make a wonderful meal for a small dinner party. It's very easy to prepare - provided you buy your confit duck legs rather than make them yourself. I wholeheartedly endorse this recipe. I've made it twice already.
