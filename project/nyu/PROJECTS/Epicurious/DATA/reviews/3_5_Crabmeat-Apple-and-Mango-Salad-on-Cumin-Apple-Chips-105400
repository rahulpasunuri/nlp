I put this on fancy crackers and served with champagne--it was a nice. I used imitation crab meat, which was ok, but it would taste much better with the real stuff. I might also add a jalapeno next time.

I needed to use up some leftover crabmeat, and this was the perfect recipe to use it for! I used more apples than crab (it was imitation, anyway), and I didn't use shallots because they're expensive ($3.99 for an onion? heck no). Fresh cilantro really brings out the tropical flavor--I felt like I was on the beach in Brazil. It is a perfect summer salad, and really quick to make!! :-)

I rarely give four forks, but this one deserves it. I love the dressing, and I love the salad! I served it on endive leaves rather than apple chips at a buffet. The simplicity of the ingredients is key - fresh, flavorful, but not overbearing. Used fresh crabmeat, because I can't see the point of the canned stuff.

It was well received, but a little too sweet for my tastes. The apple chips were a disaster for me, but I found it just as nice looking and 1/4 the work to just use fresh apple slices instead.

We decided to make this recipe for our dinner club and everyone loved it! It looks and tastes great, plus it's nice as a first course because it's light. The apple chips cut from the center section of the apple turn out with a really pretty natural "star" from the holes where the seeds were. The variances we made were adding a little more dressing and mango in the crab salad itself. you can garnish this with a tiny bit of the sifted sugar/cumin mixture and some chopped cilantro.

I was afraid to try this at first given one of the reviews. I served it to my bookclub and it got rave reviews - had to e-mail the recipe to all of them. Made it for a caterer friend - who thought it was fabulous and who made it for a luncheon. They are singing her praises.

I made this dish with medium sized cooked shrimp and ripe papaya. I served it with the apple chips on the side so they would stay crisp. I used a mandoline for the chips. I have also made these chips with cinnamon instead of the cumin with success. I used this as a first course and left my guests begging for more AND a copy of this recipe. We love this salad!!

Really great light salad. Try poaching the apples before pureeing them.

These were great. I took another cooks suggestion and served the apples on the side, as they get soggy very quickly. A mandoline is a must! Next time I will try it with scallops.

I served this with the crab salad mounded on each apple chip at a cocktail party and it got rave reviews. The chips were a pain to make without a mandoline, but really tasty.

In spite of all the good ingredients, this just didn't do it for us. The dressing was overly tangy (sour? Use less shallot!), and the crabmeat definitely lost in the fruit. We won't make this again.

The first time I made this salad for guests they raved about it - especially the apple chips. I've sinced made it with equal success using fake crab (surimi) and whole cumin seeds for the apple chips (saves a step in the grinding). We find the delicate fresh crab gets a little lost with all the fruit in the salad and will use the fake stuff in the future. Any suggestions/good recipes for fresh crab?

I served this on a bed of iceberg lettuce instead of the stacked presentation, with chips and extra apple slices scattered around. It was delicious. I may add avocado next time for the creamy texture.

As a professional cook, I say the salad itself is delicious - a great combination of textures and flavours. The presentation, however, as the photo suggests, is utterly frustrating and not functional to the average diner. I would serve the salad in a shallow (small) soup dish with 4 or 5 apple chips tucked into the sides. The person who designed this salad in its current form is more concerned with showiness than function.

I had to make the chips twice, but went out and bought a silpat and they were a breeze, and delicious. We had no trouble eating the chips, they added a lot to the whole salad.

I would make this again simply because I have very few good crabmeat salad recipes. The apple chips stick- I would sprinkle powdered sugar on the baking sheet first. Otherwise the chips were probably the most flavorful part of the recipe. There is something, a kick, missing in the crabmeat part. Perhaps some lemon or lime?

It took me two tries to get the apple chips just right, but after a minute or two of being assembled with the salad, they softened. My guests tried to gnaw on them but eventually pushed them to the sides of their plates and ate only the salad, which was wonderful on its own. If I make this again, I'll skip the trouble of baking the apples and just use slices of raw apple.
