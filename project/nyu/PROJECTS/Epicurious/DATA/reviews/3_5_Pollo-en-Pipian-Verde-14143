In addition to the above ingredients, my grandmother uses 5 leaves of epazote, half a cup of acelgas (chard), and half a cup of parsley. She doesn't use coriander.

Six serranos is about five too many.... what a shame after all the prep the sauce was too hot to eat! The flavor was delicious, but next time I'll cut WAAAAY back on the chiles!

This is divine! I took several shortcuts. I substituted 28oz of purchased salsa verde for the tomatillos etc. I used a little bit of sesame oil in place of the sesame seeds. I didn't puree the poblano and cilantro - simply chopped them well. Then I let the chicken and sauce simmer slowly for quite a while. I served the chicken and sauce over rice. I'll make this dish again soon!

I have made this dish many times since it first appeared in Gourmet in 1997 to rave reviews. It is worth the many steps, which are necessary for its complex flavor. I've had good results making this ahead and re-heating.

This dish is dreamy. Well worth the time and effort. Similar to a South Asian (India) dish in spices and texture.

The sauce is unusual, complex and absolutely delicious. Ever since first making it in '97, I have been working on reducing the time it takes to make this and reducing the mess it makes in the kitchen without comprising its rich, unique flavor. My sauce is also much thicker. If you would like my modified recipe and "pan reduction strategy", please e-mail me.

I think reducing the broth would have been a good idea since the mixture was a little liquidy for tacos. The suggestion for rice and beans as accompnaments sounds a lot better that the mix in soft corn tortillas tasted. This wasn't worth my effort.

This type of recipe, as well as the various 'Mole's have always been one of my favorite facets of Mexican mainland cuisine! This is a delicious variant! For those to whom the labor intensive nature of the recipe is a bit extreme, you can by small bottles of Mole or Pipian at most supermarkets. Follow the directions (usually add broth to the contents of the jar), and avoid the sauce-making portion of the recipe. Ciao!

The flavor of this dish is so unique and unexpected. This is true Mexican cooking. I reduced the amount of stock to make a thicker sauce and it turned out fine. Make sure you purchase hulled pumpkin seeds or else you'll be pulling bits and pieces of tough "bone" out of the sauce. Zarela Martinez has a similar, simplified recipe in her book "Oaxaca."

Absolutely delicious! The sauce was flavorful, complex, fresh-tasting and visually appealing. The only change I made was that I left the chicken to stew in my slow-cooker for about 4 hours, then refrigerated the chicken and the broth until the bird was cool enough to handle and the fat could be skimmed. The final dish came out a little on the saucy side, which was OK with me because I served it over saffron rice and with corn tortillas on the side. As a bonus, it left me with several containers of broth in my freezer. All my guests raved about this. Definitely a keeper.

This was DELICIOUS! I doubled the recipe and used a whole turkey. I shredded the meat and rolled it in heated soft corn tortillas with jack cheese, put them in a casserole and THEN covered the top with the pumpkin seed sauce. To make using the recipes instuctions is a bit soupy. I also cut back a bit on the chiles, after all, Im in New England!

On Epicurious TV it shows this being served in a corn tortilla. Tried that, but it doesn't work. I really like the taste in this but would serve this stew-soup with tortillas on the side. I served this with black beans and rice combined. Worked great.

I am perplexed at what this is supposed to be. Is it a soup? a stew? a dip? I didnt know what to serve it with. My daughter ate it on rice, my husband with tortillas and mine out of a bowl. It was labor intensive and the flavor was great but I dont think I would ever make it again

It would be a good idea to notice that this dish is eaten with corn tortillas.

This is far above the usual chicken recipe when it comes to combining spices that work together. A beautiful combo. The pumpkin seed sauce is not to be described. I like more pablano, but never never for the average eater. Wonderful.
