A recipe not for the faint of heart. I used a TriTip Roast and it turned out perfectly. At first I wasn't sure about either of the sauces - at least with beef. But then I tried them together...after I extinguished the flames in my hair I knew I had a winner. By the way - you can make the mustard sauce without a dbl boiler - just melt the butter and stir slowly into the dry ingredients.

I only made the red pepper sauce which I was able to use with the two entrees I served for Christmas - herb-encrusted tenderloin and crab cakes. A very versatile sauce - very smoky and spicy and a great staple to keep frozen to make a simple meal extra special

This recipe makes a perfect, medium rare tenderloin. I don't care for this particular chipotle sauce, but the mustard-chive sauce made strong men weep (and I mean that in a good way) at my New Year's Eve gathering. I will make this again, and again, whenever I can afford the organic tenderloin!

I made this recipe for a mexican themed holiday celebration. The mustard chive sauce was not that great but the red pepper sauce was out of this world! The beef was fabulous. I've made it a few more times with lesser cuts of beef but the result wasn't as good. The red pepper sauce, however, goes well with corn tamales, italian bread, chicken....damned near everything I've paired it with. A true keeper.

My guests and I loved this. I thought the red pepper(they meant "3" peppers, by the way) was very tasty, not too hot, but then I love chiplotes. I made the mustard sauce ahead of time which I would not recommend. When I went to heat it up, it had glommed up. It was fine when I first made it. Make it as the fillet is roasting. It also took about 20 minutes to get it to 130 degrees for a 3 lb. roast

I have used the chipolte peppers, both canned in adobo sauce and dried in many tex-mex dishes, it adds a good smoked chili flavor, but are hot and will overwhelm, I would recommend using only a tablespoon of the sauce from the can, it will add enough flavor, but minimize the heat.

I only made the red pepper sauce for another dish I was cooking. The sauce was very rustic and the chipotle overwhelmed the sauce. I tried adding a little balsamic vinegar which I love with red pepper, but I still didn't care for it.

This is a great recipe, and our guests like it very much except for the chipotle sauce. Save your time and make only the mustard chive sauce which is great with the rare beef.

I'm not rating this menu because I haven't made it yet. I have a question about the bell peppers. Does it really require 13? In my stores, red bell peppers cost $2.99 each. This dish would bankrupt me to buy 13. Does it really require 13?
