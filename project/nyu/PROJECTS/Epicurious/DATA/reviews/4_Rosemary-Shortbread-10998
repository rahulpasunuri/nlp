I first made these in 1994 then found my old Gourmet and made them again for my wedding in 2005. They are delicate and delicious. I've lost my Gourmet--and am so happy to have the recipe here on epicurious.

Fantastic! I make them just as the recipe is written. They are the most popular cookie on my annual Christmas tray (of 20 or so types of cookies). I dream of these!

These were beautiful! Lightly crumbly and superbly fragrant. I used 1/8th C of sugar and it was just fine. Will triple the recipe next time!

Yummy! The scent these give off will make you swoon. It was like home therapy. Just heavenly. I had a little trouble with the scoring and cutting part, so next time I will roll out the dough and shape with a cookie cutter. I would also check these after baking for 17 minutes or so. They turned beyond golden at 20.

Amazing. Addicting. Awesome!!! I actually reviewed this before, with a 4-fork rating, but realized now that I've been making it wrong. I recommended cutting the sugar in half to 1/8 cup, but didn't realize that the recipe calls for powdered sugar. So, after many times of using 1/8 cup regular sugar, I finally tried it with 1/4 cup powdered sugar. I do have to say, I like the texture of 1/8c regular sugar better. This is pretty much a weekly recipe for me, so if you make it as often, try it with the regular sugar next time (just cut the quantity in half). One of my favorite recipes!

Perfect, just as everyone says! I didn't knead the dough, like the person below, and it was a bit crumbly but still wonderful and delicious. 4 forks, hands down!

Absolutely quite literally perfect. My favorite counter at the farmer's mkt here in Nashville used to serve pretty little rosemary shortbread squares, and I've been dying to replicate... done and done! Wanted to make it according to directions the first time, but next time maybe I'll add a little black pepper. So perfect.

This is THE shortbread recipe. I am giving it 4 stars with no modifications to the recipe. Better make a double batch.

De-lish! Five drops of sweet orange oil (would have used grated orange rind if I had some) were a fortuitous addition. I will definitely make this again for a more interesting occasion than after a few hours of gardening.

Lovely, unusual, and easy. I made this in a panic, because we were going to a party in 90 minutes, and it came out beautifully. It goes from "golden" to "brown" quickly, though, so watch the baking time.

Wow, forgot to mention - got this idea from a catering company I work for - thank you Cloud Nine. Now, if I can just find the recipe for mango cream cheese to put on pumpkin bread!

I made these in a square pan (8 or 9 inch, who knows!) and cut them in 1 inch squares, top with 1 inch of Feta cheese and a slice of cherry tomato on top - served as an appetizer. Just wonderful - different and everyone loved them.

I made this recipe for christmas last year, and everyone loved it. I just made it again today and we can't wait until dessert time! It's delicious.

This is very tasty and different. Mine got a little overdone, which I figured was just my oven, but upon reading other reviews, I guess I'm not alone. Next time I will reduce the baking time. As for reducing the sugar to serve it with cheese, I think you could serve it with cheese as is and it would be awesome. I can definitely imagine it paired with a wedge of cheddar and some good wine.

This almost burned after 20 minutes. VERY crumbly and impossible to knead. I added a little more butter mixed with flour at the end. It tastes good out of the oven but like I said, after 20 minutes it is dark golden and on the verge of inedible. Watch it closely

As a reviewer of the other rosemary shortbread recipe on this site suggested... it could be wonderful with thyme too, I agree and I think you can experiment with the herbs in your own garden! lavender would fit in very well too!

very good

Instead of baking it in a pan and cut into wedges like shortbread.. I used a cookie stamp instead and it worked out fine. Very pretty individual cookie with a heart shape motif. Very interesting taste.. very adult taste. Would make another lot tomorrow.

This recipe proved to be a great success for me too. I was running short on time so I pressed the mixture into the buttered pie plate directly rather than kneading it, as per the earlier review. It worked really well. They go very well with Earl Grey tea, I found. I was thinking of making this recipe with less sugar to serve with cheese. Any thoughts on that?

Definitely sophisticated, complex, and fragrant! People probably will either love or hate them. Very buttery. Even with unsalted butter, I would reduce the salt to 1/4 t. I also would increase the sweetness just slightly. As for making them, after combining all the ingredients, I was left with crumbs that did not stick together. Trying to form a dough on the cutting board was hopeless. Instead, I ended up pouring the crumbs into the pan and pressing them down until firm. That worked perfectly, and frankly, was easier than kneading a dough. It also circumvented the overworked-dough problem. But scoring that crumbly, pressed dough and decorating the edges did not work. After baking, the (3mm high) shortbread had the perfect texture, held together, and cut easily without crumbling.

What a wonderful flavour! Excellent shortbread recipe, the combination of the buttery taste with the rosemary is extraordinary.

Rating: 4
Excellent flavor. I didn't have any unsalted butter, so I used regular and omitted the 1/2 t. salt. They came out great, if a little flat.

A good one, all hands liked these. Most often said coment"MAKE MORE"

These disappeared almost as fast as they came out of the oven. A big hit with my family, and I've made them several times. Lovely combination of flavors and very nice texture.

I thought this was absolutely wonderful, but I have to say that other people seemed to think it was a bit weird.

This really deserves a three-and-a-half. I made these for family in christmas tree shaped molds, and all the recipients were impressed. As was I, who only got to taste a little and will make more soon! Delicious and fragrant, with the mix of sweet and salty that makes shortbread so wonderful.

A keeper for the cookie recipe box. I made them for Christmas and added toasted pine nuts for the occasion.

Loved it! Easy to make, and the taste is fabulous - not too sweet, with that wonderful tang of rosemary. I used a mixture of fresh and dried, and maybe added a little more than called for. Came out tasting wonderfully.

This delicious butter cookie has the perfect texture. They got rave reviews at a tea. I thought they might taste strange but the flavor is slightly sweet and complex.
