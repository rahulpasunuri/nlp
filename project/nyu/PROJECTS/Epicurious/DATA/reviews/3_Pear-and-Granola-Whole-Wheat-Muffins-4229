I am always looking for a healthy recipe. I didn't use pears since I am a berry nut! This is an amazing quick breakfast. I made a few adjustments/adapted this recipe http://wp.me/p2bivP-1q

Ugh. These are terrible - the nutmeg is overpowering and the dough comes out gummy and tasteless. Would never make again. Threw out the whole batch.

I also used an additional pear, and oats, and a few other changes.... my end result was very light and fluffy muffins, very tasty and light as air.

I never reveiw - unless I make the recipe as given -this is the exception: I used all whole wheat flour and put the granola in cuisenart. Made the muffins with no sugar (granola and nectar has enough.) They are fine, not spectacular -

FWIW, I baked some with and without paper liners and they came out of the non-stick muffin tins without any problem (they were sprayed with cooking spray). Added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon since the smell of the nutmeg was so overpowering, but int he finished product, the spice amounts were fine. Moist, but nothing really special.

this bread is not gluten free as both the wheat and white flour do have gluten in them.

This was better than I expected. I liked it because it doesn't have a ton of sugar and fat and my kids enjoyed it. I did it with blueberries and apple juice- some other comments mentioned apple juice. I would still try it as originally printed, but I think it might be a bit sweeter that way.

I doubled the pear, but all I could taste in the muffins was nutmeg. I'm in no rush to make these again, but if I do, I'll only use a pinch of nutmeg.

I've made this recipe several times now - both with and without variations (I like the idea of using oats in place of the granola). I definitely agree with the other reviewers about using less nutmeg. Personally I suggest using a combination of cardamom and cinnamon instead. But very tasty in any case!

The first time I made these, I forgot to put in the eggs--and they were still delicious!

I found these to be very tasty and moist. Just a little too sweet, so next time I'll cut back on the brown sugar a bit. I agree with other reviewers to cut back on the nutmeg and add just a little cinnamon.

delicious and healthy. of course i tried to adjust the healthy part by adding a cream cheese cider frosting, which worked out very well. i also used cider instead of the nectar, walnuts instead of granola, and liberally added more pear bits. i am very pleased with this recipe -- moist and hearty. might play around with the spices next time.

Very good and hearty. I also used oatmeal instead of granola. Other substitution was to use apple cider instead of the pear nectar and crystallized ginger instead of the nutmeg.

No granola. Substituted oatmeal chopped rasins and grahm cracker. This recipe can be most flexible. The guys at our hunting camp used honey as a topping. They were gone in a flash.

These are excellent muffins (I don't like supersweet cakiness for muffins) They are moist, tasty, and hearty. I added a little buttermilk to make the batter less dry. Granola could be substituted with oats/seeds/whatever because it doesn't keep its crunchiness in the muffins anyway. Could also vary things with berries, chocolate chips or maybe dried apricots.

A little bland, but still tasty. Would make again if needed to use up some pears. Took reviewers advice and used 1/4 tsp nutmeg +1/4 tsp cinnamon instead of 1/2 nutmeg and glad I did as nutmeg was still quite pronounced.

An easy recipe to modify in a pinch. I substituted one and a quarter cups of oatmeal and a large handful of dried blueberries for the granola and it really pumped up the flavor and texture. I also used all white flour (1/3 cup less than the 2 total cups in the receipe to accomodate the oatmeal) My family loved it.

I made a couple of substitutions: sucanat instead of brown sugar; coconut oil insteadof vegetable; a combination of apple juice and apple sauce instead of pear nectar (which I didn't have on hand); and cinnamon instead of nutmeg. The result was fine. Good texture, not too sweet. Maybe just a tiny bit on the heavy side but good.

I was given a basket of pears and was looking through Epicurious for receipes when I came upon this one. It was good. Couldn't imagine nutmeg with pears so I substituted 2 teaspoons of crystalized ginger. Also, didn't have low-fat granola so used regular granola with nuts etc. I would make these again and experiment with other fruits using same-fruit juice (peach, apple for example) adjusting spice (ginger with the peaches and cinnamon with the apples). They did taste healthy, but were delicate. Good split and toasted the next day!

Muffins are very moist due to the fruit and the fruit juice, but the nutmeg was still overwhelming eventhough I reduced it to half the amount. Also, they tasted too healthy. Either make an unhealthy muffin with lots of sugar and butter, or make something totally healthy. This compromise didn't work for me.

These are absolutely the most nutritious muffins I've ever seen. They're moist, delicious and best of all, taste nutritious. They're also perfect as a snack; I carry one around wherever I go!

Fantastic! These muffins were hearty and chewy and moist, which was surprising given that half the flour is whole wheat (which has a definite tendency to be on the dry side). When I make these again, I will likely either just add 1/2 tsp. or so of cinnamon or substitute it for some of the nutmeg.

I made these muffins awhile ago and also found the nutmeg overwhelming. In general, these muffins just were not that great - the texture, taste, nor appearance.

Nutmeg taste was too overwhelming. I think I'll try it again using 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.
