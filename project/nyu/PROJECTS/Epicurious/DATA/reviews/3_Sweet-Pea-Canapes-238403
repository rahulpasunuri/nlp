wow, what a mistake! this recipe was too sweet and too sloppy to be a success. Not a good choice.

I've made these for several parties - even brunch - and they are always gobbled up. People see them and ask hesitantly "what are they?", but then they eat handfuls of them. I think the light green mousse confuses them and then delights them. I do think straining the pea juice through a sieve is important - it makes the pea cream light and fluffy and perfect. I use the thinnest baguette my store carries - about 1.5 inches round - and it makes great bite-sized canapes.

It's a really different flavor than someone might expect, but good. Make sure you don't buy a terribly sweet ham so it can stand up against the sweet peas. I also found that adding a small shaving of parmigianno on top of the ham added just the right of savory to balance the flavors.

This was a great appetizer and super easy to make. I didn't force the puree through a sieve since I don't have one and didn't see the need. There really weren't any solids to strain out. I missed the part about cutting each baguette slice in half. Don't see why you'd need to do that. Guests had no problem eating them as-is.
