This was simple and tasty. I had had a craving for pasta with mushrooms and found this recipe. It easily satisfied my craving. It's not a stunning, stand-out-in-a-crowd recipe but like another reviewer wrote, it's an easy and satisfying weeknight meal. I'll second that!

Made recipe to specifications and used baby portabella mushrooms. Found the result perfectly edible, but not in any way special. Not a very attractive presentation either.

I thought this simple weeknight pasta dish was wonderful. My husband and my 2 year old daughter both loved it.
