This is an excellent recipe. Rather than whipping cream, I use light coconut milk to make it healthier and more flavorful. Also, I use an extra teaspoon of curry powder. If you don't have fresh seafood on- hand, chicken is a great substitute (saute until it's no longer pink, then add to recipe and proceed per instructions).

All I can say is FANTASTIC! I used lobster, 2 tbsps hot curry paste, and added a bit of sherry to the cream. Boyfriend LOVED it!!!

Made this last minute because I had all of the ingredients (except scallops) on hand. This recipe is superb!! It is simple and flavorful. I did add a little extra garlic and shallots instead of green onions. It was yummy!

I too added snow peas and red pepper strips and substituted lite coconut milk for the cream. Even used left over milk in the can to make the rice.

Superb dish! I too added the snap peas and red pepper. I also added a little coconut milk and more whipping cream since adding the extra veggies. Tossed in a little cornstarch too to thicken the sauce. This recipe was a hit with hubby and guests. Great combination!!!

My husband and I used the other reviewers suggestions and added curry paste, red peppers and snap peas - but we also substituted the whipping cream with lite coconut milk. We served it to company on a first run and it was a complete success! The peppers and peas added some color, the curry paste gave it some heat and the coconut milk made the dish a lot less heavy. This is a dinner that we would happily make again for ourselves and guests...

This dish turned out really well. I added yellow squash to the mix which blended well and some chili powder to give it some more kick. I received a thumbs up from everyone who ate this wonderful dish.

Didn't like this dish at all, even with the suggested modifications. Despite the ingredients, surprisingly low on flavor.

I altered this recipe, as it seems all else did, too -- Changed the whipped cream to light coconut milk, added 1/2 t of red curry paste, a dash of cayenne, and roasted vegetables leftover from the night before. My 6 year old ate it! Best compliment of all!

A great recipe. It was exactly what I was looking for - a basic guide to making a good curry. I probably added a little more ginger than the recipe called for. Also I added more like 1.5 to 2 tbsp of curry paste, not powder. I also added 1/2 tbsp of chili paste to heat the dish up some. Even with about 3/4 a cup of chicken broth that I added to the recipe, obviously the extra spices heated the dish up some, but it turned out just how I like it. I didn't have any lemon, and I was lazy so I just put in a little lime juice.

I was really surprised at how GOOD this recipe was considering how simple it is to make. Packed with flavor (though not as spicy as I would normally prefer, it worked great for feeding to my 17 month old), would be easy to add different veggies also. This dish will definitely be a constant on my menu!

I added a diced jalapeno with the ginger and garlic and used hot curry powder, so it was plenty hot. I also added a chopped red bell pepper with the shrimp, scallops, and green onions, which I think was a good addition. My girlfriend loved it. I was surprised that the flavor was not stronger, especially because the neighbors could smell it (and were jealous). I will definitely make it again because it was tasty and so easy. Next time I may add the dash of salt instead of trying to go low sodium.

Excellent curry dish! I added a little cornstarch (mix with water prior to adding)to thicken the sauce. I will definately make this again.

I made this recipe for my husband and he said it was absolutely the best and coming from him that's quite a compliment. We like hot foods so the only change I made was instead of using curry powder I used 1 1/2 tbsp Patak's Extra Hot Curry Paste.

This was one of the best curry recipes my husband and I have ever tasted--wonderful flavor with the addition of the lemon rind. I added a bit of chicken broth to give it more sauce--plus a bit more cream. I added coarsely chopped sugar snap peas and they gave the dish wonderful flavor & crunch. We dislike cilantro--so added minced fresh Italian parsley instead. I used more curry than suggested--and half of that was Madras HOT curry powder--delicious!

The trick that takes this dish over the top is to carmelize half a white onion first, then the garlic, ginger, etc. The sauce takes on this really rich, almost smoky quality.

Yummy. My wife loved it! Quick and easy. I added chutney to the sauce and it was fanastic!

This was wonderful and really really easy. I had gotten to the point where I wasn't sure I wanted to ever see a scallop again after a few too many overly rich scallop recipes, but this one was perfect. The spicy sauce plays off the richness in a very nice way. I added a bit of cayenne because I like things on the spicy side. I'd make this again in a minute - either with just scallops, just shrimp, or as written.

I substituted coconut milk for whipping cream and added julienned snow peas and red bell pepper. I sauted the shrimp and scallops briefly in butter and olive oil first then made sauce, adding shellfish back to heat through. Will probably sustitute a hot curry powder next time...did not have the hot bite I enjoy in curries.

This recipe is excellent! I had non-curry people who loved it, scallop fanatics who drooled over it, and a cilantro hater who wanted seconds. All asked for the recipe. Easy to make and tastes like it took days to prepare!

Like the previous cook, we like our seafood cooked on the light side, so reversed the procedure and sauteed the shrimp & scallops first to a golden brown, removed them and added them and added them into the sauce at the very end. Loved it because not only extremely tasty, but also quick to prepare. Will definitely do again.

Presentation especially nice with giant scallops and jumbo shrimp. I reversed order a bit. We like our shellfish just barely cooked, so I began by sauting shrimp & scallops on high heat until nicely browned then removed to plate. Added juilliened snow peas along with chopped onions. Deglazed pan with chicken boullion (Knorr's), then added both cream and coconut milk. Added lots of chopped cilantro to sauce, then returned seafood and juices and finished cooking. Served over oriental noodles. Prep work can be done ahead of time and dish completed in 5-7 minutes. Pretty color. Delicious!

A real hit, and SO easy to make. Like Jilleyn I used condensed milk (low fat) and a bit more ginger and garlic the first time I made it and the sauce was just divine. I also used East Indian Hot Curry and increased the amount by 1/2 TBS. I increased the green onions and cut them on the diagonal, but any crunch green veggie in your refrigerator would do nicely. Nice color and was a hit--served over cous cous for the time challenged cook. The second time I made it, I substituted canned coconut milk and served with Jasmine rice and found it even better, if possible. A real keeper.

I made some minor changes to this dish: Because I was only cooking 3 portions, I used 1 1/4 pounds shrimp and no scallops. I also substituted evaporated milk for the cream, which turned nice and creamy, and I used more of everything to make sure that the sauce had a nice kick. The combination of lemon, ginger, garlic, curry and cilantro was awesome! I also used a nice Jasmati rice instead of the plain stuff.

I thought this was very easy to make and my husband loved it. I did not use scallops and it turned out lovely. I also added snow peas and white pepper.

If you're expecting the taste of Thai curry, you will be disappointed but it was a very easy dish to throw together on a weeknight. Pretty tasty too.

This was a great dish and super easy to make. The recipe only calls for 1 tablespoon of curry but it needs more! I used orzo instead of rice. I would definitley make it again.
