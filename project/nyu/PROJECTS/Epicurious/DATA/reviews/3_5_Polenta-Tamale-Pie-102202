Quite easy and very very good. I used 1 lbs of boiled chicken instead of beef. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of powdered garlic, 1 teaspoon of powdered chipotle powder and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin.

As I'm vegetarian, I substituted Morningstar Farms meatless crumbles-- very easy, and tasted wonderful. Also added half a lime to the sauce mixture. Very good, satisfying recipe.

I have made this recipe several times. There is no need to add the chicken broth as the sauce is plenty liquid-y as is. I also add a can of black beans and green chiles. Also use fresh salsa instead of the bottled kind and make my own polenta so there is plenty of it for both layers (2 cups polenta per 6 cups water or chix broth). The dish turns out great and leaves plenty for leftovers.

Delicious! I skipped the broth, beans and had the salsa on the side. I also decreased the amount of cheese and only added polenta on the top, which I made fresh. I mixed cilantro in with the meat, but did not top it with cilantro before baking because it makes cilantro chips. :)

Rating: 4
Huge flavors! As others have mentioned, you can certainly skip the broth. We used ground bison meat because we had it on hand. We used green tomatillo salsa, and added a can of golden hominy (drained) and a small can of diced green chiles (drained). I will certainly make this again!

This was very good for a quick pantry meal. Cut in 1/2 and baked in 8x8 pan for 4 servings. Will make again. Served with rice with tomatoes & oregano and mango-avocado salad. As noted, do not add broth unless needed & many additions are possible. Thanks to cook for homemade polenta recipe: 1-1/2 C broth, 1/2 C cornmeal, 1/8 t salt for 1/2 recipe. Cook til very thick. Prebake bottom crust 10 min at 350. Use 2 spoons to get top crust on in nice pattern.

This was super tasty. My grandmother used to make this when I was growing up and I added some of her ingredients to give it more punch; canned green chilis, corn and black olives. Also I used ground turkey and made a quick polenta to pour over the top instead of the sliced rolls of pre-made stuff. And I skipped the cilantro. Big hit here at our house!

Rating: 4
We love this recipe and leftovers freeze well. I usually skip the broth altogether. Most recently I substituted a larger can of black beans, macerating 1/2 of them. Polenta is easy to make with stone-ground cornmeal - be sure to cook until very thick (and cool or chill first). Cilantro burns easily so I put it on top of the sauce.

This recipe is a favorite in our house. I modified it to make it healthier. I use ground turkey instead of beef and fresh salsa (from grocery store) instead of bottled. I also use black beans instead of refried so I omit the chicken broth. I make my own polenta which is so quick and spread on top. This is one of my husband's favorites!

I made this again tonight (for about the 6th time) again with the recipe as just the inspiration. I had the dark meat leftover from a roast chicken, and used that instead of ground beef. Again used Rotel tomatoes, added onion and bell pepper, and used a can of La Preferida spicy chipotle refried beans. It's fabulous!

I made this late last night- and it was easy. I used ground turkey, black beans, no stock, a small can of ortega fire-roasted chilies, Trader Joe's mild salsa and half a can of mexican tomatos with chilis and colby jack cheese. I sprayed the pan with non-stick spray and baked for 35 minutes. I had some today for lunch and I enjoyed it. It's not fancy or gourmet but great for potlucks or when you have friends over for a football game. I probably wont make it often, but it is a keeper. I did have to cook the meat mixture for at least 40 minutes even without the stock.

Great for an easy weeknight meal with ingredients you likely have in the house. Made the recipe as written, except I only needed a little chicken broth to get the consistency I wanted. Also added a can of black beans to make it a little healthier. Will definitely make again.

I was craving tamales, but didn't know where to get corn husks, so I tried this and WOW! Definitely hit the spot. I cooked this all up in a big wok and split it into two smaller baking dishes and left one at my parents house. My mom called me for the recipe! I didn't have enough cheese on hand, but it still turned out great. I served it with some fresh cilantro and a spoonful of sour cream, which I love, and it made a tasty garnish.

This was soooo good! The recipe was basically an inspiration. We used a can of Rotel tomatoes instead of salsa, added onion and green peppers, and made our own crust using masa harina. Even making our own tamale dough still had this assembled and in the oven in under 30 minutes. Leftovers tonight!

I used a chipotle salsa and mince turkey, and it was yummy. I found it didn't thickened, and next time I would leave out the broth. Also, I couldn't get the polenta to spread enough, so I crumbled it with the cheese and cilantro and used it like a crumble on the top. Served it with avocado slices and a lemon-cilantro yogurt. Tasty!

I almost never follow recipes (unless I'm baking), and I don't measure. I just look at the ingredients and go from there. I made my own polenta, substituted black beans for the refried, didn't use broth, and added fresh garlic. I also did not oil the pan, and the food came out with no sticking at all. It was SO YUMMY! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE tamales, and I think this dish was better because it has more substance to it, like veggies, instead of just meat and cornmeal. This tasted very fresh and light.

Runny, runny, runny! Even after heeding the warnings of other reviewers, it was STILL runny! Do not add ANY stock to the filling. If you have a thinner salsa, be sure to cook it down. It does have a good flavor and if I can get it to stand up, it would have a much better presentation. Along with all the other husbands, mine loved it, too.

This is a real crowd pleaser and lends itself to many variations. It is very easy to make your own polenta- look for the more coarsely ground corn meal (I used Goya) and the recipe is on the bag. I do not pre bake the polenta but I'm sure that works fine too. This time I am using leftover cooked chicken, black beans, hominy, and of course the salasa and spices. It makes a great vegetarian dish without the meat too.

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed making this recipe. It was easy and is a really pretty dish to serve. I doubled the recipe as I had a big crowd, but I, too only used half of what the recipe called for on the chicken broth. I also blended the salsa and cilantro in my food processor so that everything was very, very smooth in the pie. My company loved it. I want to try it with home made polenta. The store bought was okay, but home made would be better. This recipe heats up beautifully so make it in advance if you need to.

Rating: 4
Excellent. I made my own polenta, which I think is worth it, but changes the process a bit. With fresh polenta, I'd bake the bottom layer about 10 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients (unless your polenta is fairly dry). The only stock I used was in the polenta. Also, had some home-made black beans on hand (w/chorizo), which helped make the dish. Also also, I used Whole Foods chipotle salsa, which is excellent and adds a nice, smokey flavor. I have fond memories of mom's tamale pie (before she became a gourmet), and this dish exceeds it, I think.

Rating: 4
Warning... Do only use like 3/4 cup of the broth... I did and it was perfect. I also made the polenta from scratch and put in pie plates to make actual "pies". Put polenta in pie plate and then put another pie plate on top to make the crust. Delish! Everyone loved! My roomate is making it again tonight for her firehouse!

Rating: 3
Great quick recipe. Used one pre-made polenta and one I made myself for topping. I used the whole can of broth and would agree to only use 1/2 can or none. It still had a wonderful flavor although it was too runny from broth. I used New Mexico chili powder and only half the cumin. No cilantro and very good.

Rating: 3
This was really tasty and relatively easy (I had to make polenta from scratch, so it took a little longer). I did read the reviews before, but then forgot the tips about the stock and used all of it. The sauce was really runny and we had to eat it with a spoon! Will make again, will use the stock to flavor the polenta instead of in the sauce, because I really think it added to the yummy factor. The left overs (we're only 2 and this made a TON of food) look less runny. Also, to make it a little less greasy, you could try jack cheese or jack/cheddar combo instead of 100% cheddar.

Rating: 3
Yum! Made this with ground venison. The meat sauce or chili or whatever was so tasty. I thought a T. and a half of chili powder was a lot, but it gave it a nice burn. split this betweeen two 9x9 dishes since it was just the two of us, and froze one of them. Next time i think i'll split the sauce into two layers though, so it's cheese-meat-polenta-meat-polenta. preferred the meat sauce on top of the polenta as opposed to that top layer with just cheese on it.

Rating: 3
I changed this recipe so much it's not really the same recipe but it is the same idea. Made my own polenta, (VERY easy with corn meal); no broth used-too watery. I had leftover pork which I used chopped instead of beef. Salsa, green chilis, black beans, cilantro, etc. Use whatever you like, the end result is good. Brought it to a neighbor's for a spur of the moment get together. Everyone enjoyed.

I'm baffled by the minimal fork votes on this one. How much easier can a recipe be? Obviously it's not the most fresh or gourmet dish on Epicurious (a quick glance at the recipe list reveals THAT). All in all a hands-down winner for busy people without a lot of time. Being creative helps, as always.

Rating: 4
Wow. Incredible - and so freakin' easy! Like the Texan, we subbed black beans for the refried (healthier) and added a chopped onion and a few cloves of garlic. We also used less cheese (again, healthier) and used half "Ranchero" cheese and half chedder. Tossed in a pinch of oregano to make it super-Mexican. This makes a TON of food for the reasonably hungry couple - we'll be freezing the rest for post-Thanksgiving-turkey fare.

Made this with ground turkey and it was great! My boyfriend can eat an incredible amount and for the first time we have a few meals worth of leftovers. A great, savory, quick, cheap weeknight meal. Oh, I only used half the amount of broth and it worked well.

I was making this for a quick weeknight supper and ended up bringing it over to the neighbor's for an impromptu happy hour. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I agree with others to either leave out the broth or use only half. I recommend spicing it up by using chipotle salsa and chipotle chili powder; that gives it a nice smoky kick!

I made this dish vegetarian by using Smart Ground taco-flavored soy meat and vegetable broth. I also made the polenta myself. I thought this dish was a great weeknight dinner; I made it in the afternoon and my husband heated it up and made a salad and corn. It was a hit for my carnivorous husband and 15-year-old. Try it!

Rating: 4
For the amount of money and effort, you can't do better than this. The refried beans actually thicken the sauce enough that you could skip the polenta and have chili or nacho dip in 10 minutes. I hate cilantro and leave it out of everything, but it's still comfort food and tasty.

I loved this recipe!!! But I think the polenta is nasty, so I grated a large can of white hominy into 1/2 white diced onion and added diced ortega chilis 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp chili powder and fried this in some butter and added 1 cup chicken stock. Then I stirred in on half cup of sour cream into the cooling hominy mixture. The rest of the recipe I left alone except I omitted the beans and substituted diced tomatoes for the salsa. I honestly didn't see the need to add the broth to the filling, yuk, so I didn't. I topped it with the Avocado and White Bean Salad listed elsewhere in epicurious. (I substituted black beans for the White ones.) This was one of the best recipes I have found in here and so easy to make.

Rating: 3
I thought this was fantastic! I cook for 2, and we had plenty for leftovers. The only thing I'll change next time is to decrease/eliminate the chicken broth. It made the mixture a bit soupy and I had to simmer it down for a pretty long time to get to the consistency I wanted. I used Pepper Jack cheese rather than the cheddar, added onions, and made my own polenta. It was delicious.

This recipe is a family favorite and I've made it many different ways. My son is vegetarian so I replaced the beef with baked mexican flavored tofu and used vegetable broth,onions,bell peppers. Sometimes I buy flavored polenta (cilantro pepper is good)or make it myself. I have also used chicken. You can omit the cheese to make it vegan, you won't even miss it! The key is also a good quality salsa.

Rating: 1
I really wanted this dish to work - I have attempted very few Southwestern style dishes and it seemed like it would be interesting. But like many casserole style dishes, (even King Ranch Chicken), you risk monotony of flavor. In this recipe, there was too little difference in texture and flavor from bite to bite. Even in the beginning, the chili powder seemed overwhelming. Not worth a repeat performance.

I found this recipe easy to make and delicious. It's a good twist on the normal tamale pie recipe. I just added chopped jalepenos for more warmth, and increased the meat by half. Friends and family favorite.

I rated it four forks the way I made it. Husband loved it. We are Texans. Changes. No chicken broth and no refried beans. Saute 1 chopped onion with 2 cloves of garlic, then add beef and spices. After adding salsa, add 1 cup of corn and 1 can of black beans (rinsed and drained). Make your own polenta. 3 cups of water, 3/4 cups coarse cornmeal, 1/4 tsp salt. I added more cheese. My husband likes it with more salsa on the side. I like it plain.

Rating: 2
Very easy to make, and quite tasty. I sliced the polenta too thickly, and got only 13 rounds per tube -- barely enough for two layers in a 9x9 dish. I used the entire can of broth, but simmered for nearly 20 minutes to thicken to the consistency I wanted. Used refried beans with Jalepenos, spicy salsa, and all the chili powder -- very spicy. Will likely make this again, but will use mild or medium salsa. Also added onion and garlic to ground beed mix as suggested. Very tasty and very good for a cold night -- but not at all good if you're on a diet!

My husband, also, loved this dish. It must be a guy thing! I liked it a lot too. It is very flavorful. I cut the recipe in half. We had it as our main course but it would make a wonderful side dish to some grilled chicken or something like that. I'll probably serve it that way next time. As a main course the full recipe would only serve 5 but I can see it serving eight as a side dish.

This recipe is SO easy to put together on a week night and it is delicious! I don't put in as much cumin as called for and use ancho or other special chili powders if I have them. I've also added a chopped onion and a few cloves of garlic to the beef mixture if I have a little extra time on my hands. My family has to have this with sour cream and they request this dish all the time. It is even better warmed up the day after. Every time I make it, I always forget how good it really is. This recipe is a defenite keeper!!!

A great comfort food dish, and one that lends itself well to variations. The best one I made substituted turkey for the beef, and jalapeno jack cheese for the cheddar. I also used corn and black bean salsa, and threw in about a quarter cup of frozen corn niblets. And everyone is right about the liquid; forget the broth, just add salsa or spicy tomatoes until you get a thick but stirrable texture.

Holy Toledo!! I stumbled across this dish while searching for polenta recipes. It is the yummy-tummiest! I substituted ground turkey for the beef, doubled the amount of refried beans (use the SPICY type), left the cilantro in the garden, and used four cups of sharp cheddar (hey - an extra cup of cheese never killed anyone). In addition, I used taco seasoning instead of the seasonings listed in the recipe. A fabulouso bonus: it reheats fantastico! Next time I plan on using jalapeno polenta - I have no doubt it will be consumed as rapidly as my original effort was. A big-time four forks up - all of them smothered in polenta tamale pie!

This was a tasty and simple recipe. I made the mistake of leaving out half a teaspoon of the chili powder because I was fearful it would be too spicy. Not the case at all. I would also be sure to add some salt to the beef mixture as it tasted much better after salt was added. I also didn't have the store bought polenta so I made "quick polenta" in the micro and then poured it in a bread pan and put it in the freezer for about a half hour to firm it up. Then I cut it into slices. Overall, a good, quick dinner recipe.

The flavor was delicious but the consistency was disappointing. It was too soupy, I would cut the broth by at least half. And while the polenta sure makes it easy, polenta is very soft and feels like corn mush on the tongue. "Polenta Tamale Pie" should be renamed "Chili con Carne with Corn Pudding" But then, who would make it?

My husband loved this and had seconds on it. I thought it was OK, not fabulous, but fine for an easy dinner.

Low fat cheddar for the cheese and extra lean ground beef. The polenta I used had basil in it and worked out very well. I only used 1 roll. Served with sour cream on top. Satisfied my Mexican craving. We'll have again tomorrow as burritos.

Definitely drain the beef, then add a diced onion to it before adding the spices and the salsa. I added some garlic powder and chipotle chilli powder as well for heat and depth. Otherwise, I made exactly as is. . . the rolled polenta worked great, and I found an herbed-garlic one that looked nice on the top. I used way more cilantro. White cheddar is nice for looks--an incredibly easy and, with the chipotle, tasty dish for a party. It all went, while I was left with half my lasagna.

Can't join the majority on this one. I made it exactly according to the instructions. The filling was awfully thin so I cooked it for about 40 minutes.

An excellent quick supper that gets better on the second day. To make the dish a little healthier, I recommend extra-extra lean ground beef (4% fat).

I made this unpretentious dish for a buffet -- mostly so the kids would have something to eat. With all the other fancy things I also prepared, the adults practically elbowed the kids out of the way to get to this. It's so easy to have most of the ingredients on hand anyway, that this would be easy to whip up on short notice.
