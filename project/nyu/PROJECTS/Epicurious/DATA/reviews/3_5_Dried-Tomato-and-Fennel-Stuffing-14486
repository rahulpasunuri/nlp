I have been making this recipe for my vegetarian thanksgiving for 4 years now (using veg. broth). Everyone loves it! always! Sometimes I add an onion if I can't find the full amount of fennel called for. This year I suggested trying a new stuffing, but everyone thought that was a bad idea... I guess that says something.

I fixed this for a "Thanksgiving-in-October" dinner for my in-laws. They loved it so much that I was asked to bring it to the family meal in November! I didn't use the full amount of fennel the recipe called for as I've never cooked with it...2 large bulbs were plenty!

I have made this recipe for the past two years.... I use veggie broth to make a vegetarian version... delicious! Can't wait to make it again.

This is hands down the BEST stuffing ever and the fennel stalks with the subtle flavor of sun dried tomato is excellent. I had it at a dinner party and then served it at christmas dinner with roated turkey and it goes really well with the sherry mashed potatoes. Definitely worth making and not difficult. I used bread from a baguette which I think worked really well.

No one in my family liked this recipe. Some thought they fennel taste was too strong, others complained about how potent the sun dried tomatoes were. There are too many other stuffing recipes out there to ever cook this again. Unless you know that your favorite critics love these flavors I would skip it.

This recipe is wonderful. A crowd pleaser! Although, I must mention that I had never cooked with fennel before and I was a little intimidated when I saw the size of the stalks and bulbs! I thought for sure I should use less, but I followed the recipe & it turned out perfectly. Next time I will DEFINITELY make it the night before. It is a bit of work for Thanksgiving morning. Enjoy!

This is the second straight year I have made this stuffing and it has been a hit both years. We have always made several stuffings for our large Thanksgiving gatherings and this one wins hands down everytime. It is deceptively simple and easy, but comes out perfectly whether in or out of the bird. It is much better than the recipe actually sounds.

This was really very tasty, particularly if you let it sit overnight. However, to put a real heavy handed gravy on top of it can cover the sundried tomatoe and fenel taste. Made it with a freshly baked Country Bread from one of the new fancy bakeries in town and it was great. Had some trouble finding on the internet the difference between the stalks and fronds of fennel.

This is soooo good. I made two stuffings to please everyone, and everyone ate this one! I had the other for days. I can't wait to make it this year.

Made this for Thanksgiving for a group of "stuffing-haters", not a speck left, rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. Will definitely make again

Excellent dish! I made it on my first thanksgiving with my husband and everyone loved it. The fennel gives it a particular flavor that everyone just raved over.
