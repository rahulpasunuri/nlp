This recipe is a great base but I altered the method to get my results (which were fantastic): browned onion, beef, ginger and garlic in cast iron - put the all the whole spices in a spice grinder and then added to the meat, and simmered with a little chicken stock. Then I stirred in chickpea flour until the mixture was thick enough to patty, and then fried the patties in a small amount of oil. Omitted the egg and cilantro - Served on paratha with sprouts, tomato, cucumber and onion with a curry yogurt sauce. Defiantly will be making this again!

Ms. Siddiqui's recipes are mouthwatering, however her prelude about Ramadaan is a version of a well healed Pakistani. An average Pakistani does not have the kind of feast she refers to for Iftar. Also, the meaning of Ramadaan is to feel the pain of hunger and realize that many people in the world do not get One square meal a day much less three, also, the well healed are supposed to donate the food to the needy and share the bounty that God has bestowed them with.

I liked the recipe very much. I tend to use chick pea flour, instead of lentils, but purely becuase that's the way my mom made it. Except no one ever got the actual recipe from her head. Now I can experiment with this one as a base.

I have to say this recipe really confuses me too. I can't help but think that there's something that the author left out or didn't describe accurately. I followed the recipe exactly, and I too ended up with a mixture that was too soft to form patties. I'm also stumped as to how you're supposed to thoroughly grind up a cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves and dried (albeit somewhat softened) chiles without turning the mixture into a paste.

another recipe that deserves a thumbs down or should i say forks down? the authentic way to make this kebab does not involve a million spices--- just ginger bayleaf and peppercorns.Also NEVER cilantro -- always fresh mint leaves and shallots both finely chopped are mixed with the ground meat

The flavor of this recipe is great, but the texture is a challenge. I could not get the mixture to dry out when simmering, so I drained it and put directly in the food processor. I'm guessing since it was still too hot it wouldn't stick together when I went to fry it. The texture was really terrible. I think chilling it next time before frying might work. Will definitely try again.

A favourite of my family's. I make it with mutton instead of beef and serve it with lemon wedges. Very tasty!
