Oh my... what a lovely combination. The flavours work so well together, follow it exactly, and you will not be disappointed. Gorgeous!

Replace walnut toasts with puff pastry cut in 2" rounds, baked and cooled. Replace fig jam with quince paste. They get better as the party goes on . . . for as long as they last; that is.

This was fantastic!!! Can't get manchego cheese where I live. Used something called Comte (similar flavor and texture) with the fig jam. I made homemade walnut bread (gluten free) to serve it on.

We served this at a party and did not use walnut bread, because we had nut- allergic guests. I think the walnut bread must be somewhat critical to the balancing of tastes b/c I didn't think this was as great as other reviewers did... there was something missing; the fig jam overpowered the manchego when we just used plain toast squares or water crackers. I'm giving three stars though because I think the concept is a very good one (elegant, yet easy) and when we used a saltier cheese (aged gouda) with our plain crackers/toast we had outstanding results. The salty-cheese-fig-jam combo is one I highly recommend. I do hope to try the walnut/manchego/fig combination sometime though.

Very easy and the flavors go ver well together. I suggest toasting the bread lightly to give it some warmth and crunch, it also brings out the spice flavor in the bread.

I made this with Indian Naan bread which I bought at my local Farmer's Market. I toasted the bread and cut it into triangles and topped as directed. I also topped some of the triangles with cream cheese and mango chutney. I brought it to a summer barbecue and it was a very popular appetizer. I would definately make this again.

I thought this was ok, but not great. the fig jam overpowered the manchego, which I found dissapointing. however, our guests really like it, so given how simple it is to make, i'd make it again.

Suprizingly, this was the dish out of 10 apps that people loved and asked for the recipe...the flavors just worked well.
