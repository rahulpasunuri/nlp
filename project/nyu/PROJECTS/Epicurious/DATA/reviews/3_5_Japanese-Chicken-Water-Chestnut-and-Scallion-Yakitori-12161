Asian flavored chicken is one of my favorite ways to have poultry. The water chestnuts add the perfect crunch and the scallions so much flavor! Total winner!

I loooved this chicken! I was hesitant to make it because of what the other reviewers said but I thought it tasted great. The marinade tasted good. I added the tiniest bit of honey. I put a grill pan in the oven and added bell peppers to the kebabs. If you want restaurant quality chicken yakitori make this recipe!!

This dish doesn't seem like Japanese at all. No one uses ginger/garlic in Japanese Yakitori. And water chestnut? You hardly eat it in Japan, except in Chinese restaurants. For traditional Yakitori, you pre-cook sauce (soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar) until thicken, and baste very small pieces of chicken (dark meat, with skin) on skews with the sauce (cooked on grill).

My husband and I both thought that this recipe was bland in comparison to yakitori that we enjoy in Baltimore's Lexington Market. We would drastically increase the ginger and garlic, and change the sugar to something stickier. We will try a little re-engineering the next time.
