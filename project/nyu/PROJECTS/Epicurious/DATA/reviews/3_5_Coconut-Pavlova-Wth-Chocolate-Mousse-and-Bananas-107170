This was my first pavlova. Like others have said, it completely stuck to the foil. Also, it was really sticky all around, even on the edges (humidity played a part?). I just did the coconot pavlova part, not the mousse; topped mine instead with melted white chocolate and raspberry puree on the side. Though it was sticky and no longer pretty (after scraping it from the foil), it tasted wonderful. I will make again, with parchment.

My first attempt at making pavlova and it turned out extreamly well. I followed the advice of several reviewers, reduced the coconut by 1/4 and the sugar by 1/3 and increased the whipping cream from 1/3 to 1 cup. This one is a keeper.

I used everyone's hints (less sugar, parchment paper) and this dessert was outstanding! You don't need a full 2 cups of coconut. I also whipped a little more cream and folded it into the mousse. Our kids said it's the new "have to order for my birthday" dessert.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I didn't try to remove the pavlova from the foil, just folded the foil under the plate I set it on, so no breaking. Also, after making the mouse, it looked a bit flat and runny. Not at all mousse-like. I just whipped up some extra cream and folded it into the mousse. Problem solved and the mousse was amazing. I think this also helped with the sweetness as the sugar in the mousse was not so concentrated. This was very easy to make and I will definitely make this again.

I have not made this yet, but I am a huge pavlova fan. To make pavlova I draw a circle on the underside of parchment paper and then dust the top with cornstarch. This allows the pavlova to come off easily.

I also made the mistake of not reading the reviews before preparing this. Issues: The foil destroyed the meringue. It was completely stuck and as a result was broken into so many pieces (which was disheartening after so much effort). cook time could easily be 45min for a perfect middle. The meringue was far too sweet (yes, half the sugar would have been just fine). The mousse flattened quickly when folding in the egg white mixture. Also, it could use a double portion of whipped cream. I would make this again, as the flavors work well together, however the recipe needs a bit of attention.

To the cook from Westport, no pavlova should be cooked through, you want a soft, mallowy inside with a checwy outside, any "cooked" pavlova is a failure.

This was wonderful, but exploded in size in the oven. Next time I will bake the meringue on a pizza pan. The chocolate mousse filling should be doubled to cover the volume of pavlova.

I thought some general thoughts on pavlovas would be a good idea. This recipe does seem much too sweet- an Australian pavlova is filled with unsweetened lightly whipped cream, and best topped with acidic fruit like strawberries or passionfruit. For a great shape and structure, pile onto baking paper (they do tend to stick) and you can draw a circle on the paper first to help get a good shape. A pav should be a good middle finger length high or even higher, and its middle won't be 'cooked'- ideally it should be sort of soft and marshmallow-y. For more pavlova information, consult a cookbook by Stephanie Alexander, or Nigella Lawson who paraphrases Stephanie's recipe.

I loved this recipe. Granted, it was a bit time consuming, and the pav was hard to remove from the foil, but it blew all of my guests away! They all said it was the most delicious dessert they had eaten in a long time. Looks proffesional and tastes dreamy!

This was one time when I didn't read the reviews before I made the recipe and I sure wish I would have! The recipe made way too much meringue, so it wasn't cooked all the way through. It also was nearly impossible to separate from the foil. The chocolate mousse recipe was just okay, there are a lot of easier better recipes out there, and I used more whipping cream than was called for. All said, if I were to make it again I would make the base thinner, double the mousse amount and and 1 1/2 the whipped cream. The flavor combination is good, this recipe just needs a lot of work!

Great concept with delicious combinations of flavors. We agree with others that the meringue is much too sweet and the foil almost impossible to separate from the meringue. The mousse quantity and whipped cream could stand to be increased by one-half. Bananas a great addition.

I loved all the flavors togather. However, it was way too sweet. I made it the second time with a baked pie crust added coconut before I put the mousse in the crust. I made 1 1/2 of the mousse to fill the pie crust added the bananas and topping. I love it this way and will make it often.

This recipe is excellent, granted it's a little on the sweet side. Will definitely make it again!

Great recipe, my kids and I loved it! Watch the browning of the coconut. It took less than 15 minutes in my oven.

Better as follows: cut sugar in meringue to 1 1/4 cups; increase bananas to 4; make 1 1/2 recipes of mousse. I wouldn't make this again but my kids liked it a lot ( it is too sweet for me and the chocolate mousse is just so so).

This knocked my socks off and I'm making it again for Thanksgiving. HOWEVER, the meringue was TOO sweet so I'll use maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of the sugar this time. The chocolate banana combination was to die for!

Because this got raves from dinner guests, I might make it again; however, I have some problems with the recipe: VERY sweet--decrease the sugar a bit; it was hard to get the meringue off the foil without cracking it; the mousse deflated a lot when whipped whites were folded in; the amount of mousse and whipped cream seemed skimpy. The bananas really added a lot. The concept is fabulous, but I would rethink the recipe a bit in order to be able to make parts of it ahead.

Wow. This is quite possibly the most saccharine dessert I have ever tasted. I nearly keeled over from sugar-shock after eating a piece. It is good, you just need big glass of milk or water to go with it. For the amout of time required, I wouldn't make it again.
