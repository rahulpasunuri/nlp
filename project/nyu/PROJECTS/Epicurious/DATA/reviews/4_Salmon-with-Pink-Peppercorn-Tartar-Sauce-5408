Per my previous review, I tried this again, this time doing it as written. The result was very tasty. I had added dill the first time and found it to be delicious. However, I felt it over-powered the pink peppercorns, which have their own unique flavor. I chose the recipe because I had purchased some pink peppercorns and wanted to try them. My recommendation would be to make the recipe as written, then add variations the next time. FYI - I made the tartar sauce, then got side-tracked for a few days in buying and cooking the salmon. I found the tartar sauce, while not spoiled, got a bit runny. In future, if this happens, Id probably strain the sauce and perhaps add more mayo and sour cream to avoid the runniness.

This was delicious and simple to make. I also added dill, which was fabulous, but wold like to try the recipe as written, as I think the dill over-powers the unique flavor of the pink peppercorns. It could definitely be made with other types of peppercorns, but I think the pink ones have a unique flavor. (I made the recipe because I had some pink pepperorns and wanted to ty them). The tartar sauce would be great on other types of seafood and with chicken. It would be good to keep on hand to use on sandwiches - chicken, crabcake, fish, etc.

I made this dish for a luncheon that included three generations of eaters and I found it suited all tastes. I poached the salmon and substituted black peppercorns for the pink ones. I also added some dill in the sauce. Everyone raved.
