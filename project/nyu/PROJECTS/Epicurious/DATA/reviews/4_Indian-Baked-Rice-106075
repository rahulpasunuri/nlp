Delicious! Notes: I used ghee instead of veg oil to make it extra decadent. Omitted the almonds. And used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I think I will always make the rice this way for my Indian meals. I used Himalayan basmati rice from Dual Specialty Store here in New York. Highly recommended!

This is a perfect side dish to compliment a more full flavored entree. For instance, I served it to 12 people on New Year's Eve with Bon Appetit's incredible "Moroccan Slow-Cooked Lamb" (Epicurious). A perfect combination!!! It's good the next day which means it would work to be a "make a day in advance" party dish.

What a great nutty flavor! I made this as a side for South Indian Curry... but I would eat it straight from the dish with big spoon! Made it exactly as written.

This is a great recipe. For those wanting to know, I measured 19 oz basmati rice and found it to be just shy of 3 cups. Served with a turkey coconut curry, raita, and a salad with orange vinaigrette. Guests were very satisfied.

I usually don't give a lot of 4 forks, but this is out of this world good. Made as written, except I added a tsp of black mustard seed in the beginning. Outstanding! Served with Emeril's Indian style shrimp. Better than restaurant!

Okay I feel real awful going against the tide here but I followed this recipe EXACTLY. I even made th garam masala 5 minutes before preparing the recipe in my mortar and pestle. Every ingredient was measured exactly. It came out tasting like clovey spiced burning pain. And I like spicey! But this wasn't spicey.. this was just.. odd. It felt like I was chewing on cloves with some ginger in it. I have no idea WHAT happened, but it didn't end well. My entire recipe was much too..something.. for human consumption. It didn't entirely go to waste though: the chickens loved it.

This is delicious and fairly easy. I added a few whole cloves and peas and it was great (just put them in when I added the broth. Diced carrots would also be a great addition. Also I didn't have basmati rice on hand so I used jasmine. It worked but basmati would have been better

this was much better than i expected. i pressed the ginger instead of grating it. i used less rice than called for (19 oz???) and it was really good - i might increase everything but the garam masala next time. it was good with chicken masala and roasted carrots with cumin seeds.

I buy rice in bulk and need a measurement for the rice, not weight!

Delicious! I made mine on the stove top because I doubled the recipe and was uncertain my stock pot would fin in the oven with ease--it made little difference in the overall product. I will make it again (along with the entire menu it is connected with). Less oil next time! Even a little oily, it got raves.

I really like this dish! I halved the recipe and it still made so much. I think next time I will add more of the garam masala, and more toasted almonds, as they add great flavor to each bite. I used vegetable broth to keep it vegetarian and it was still really good.

This is a lovely recipe. Actually made it with brown basmati rice and the flavor was wonderful. Left out the jalapeno as I'm not crazy about them. Served with chicken korma and curried veggies. Hubby--a Brit who knows and cooks Indian cuisine--loved it. This one's a keeper (uh, the recipe...as well as the hubby).

I thought this was great. We couldn't use jalapeno because of the salmonella problems so we used a similar intensity pepper. I thought it was easy and deliccious but the bf thought it was a lot of work for not much results.

Simple. Yet very impressive results. Only change was I let the almonds stay in the mixture & bake within for a unique textured surprise in the rice. Marvelous !

I wouldn't rush to make this again. I made with purchased garam masala and to me the cinnamon flavor came through too strongly.

Delicious flavor and texture! This will be a favorite in my household.

Made exactly as in recipe and really liked the flavor. Yes, it is beige... but... well... it's rice, right? Garam masala varies quite a bit, so if you use one with more turmeric, you'll probably get a yellower color. Or, maybe add some finely chopped cilantro just before serving... Oh yeah, don't let the jalapeno scare you -- once cooked, it's not hot at all. Y

Love this. I'm Indian myself and grew up on Indian food, we make rice a lot but none of the recipes have come close to this with requiring very little effort. Some modifications I made were, adding in a handful of raisins that I soaked while cutting everything up and right before I added them in with the chicken stock I put them in a cup of water and microwaved for 1 min. Also I did not sautee the almonds prior too, I started with the onions. I also soaked the almonds in water so they are more softer, during the whole duration of cooking the rice. Once there was 5-10 mins left to take out the rice, I peeled and chopped the almonds and sprinkled them all over the rice. After taking the rice out I fluffed them with a fork. Oh yeah with the chicken stock I only did 3 cups of it with 1cup of water. I have made this twice now, first time I served it with butter chicken and chicken tikka with fresh naan and cucumber tomato raita. Yesterday I made paneer makhni and apple(shredded) and onion raita. We love this dish in our house, my mom who never eats rice will eat a plateful of this. This one is a keeper.

If you neeed a recipe for Indian rice, I would definetly recommend this one. It was my contribution to an Indian dinner recently, and everyone loved. It is very aromatic. The color is beige, but the nuts help the appearance. I washed the rice as per instructions, although when making basmati rice I usually do not wash it and it turns out fine.

Rating: 4
Outrageously delicious! I started before realizing I had no rice at all and hubby went to the store and just got "uncle bens"... The key, I think, is in rinsing it - removes the starch and ensures a light and fluffy mixture. Of course, the cooking process was great too, and the marriage of flavors, just terrific!

I made this with a few cups of leftover brown jasmine rice which I added after the other ingredients cooked, then added a 1/4 cup chicken broth and cooked until the rice was heated and mostly dry. It was pretty good, and a lot quicker.

This recipe does make a lot of rice, but we were happy for the leftovers. We used more liquid or broth. 3 cups of rice for 6 cups of broth. We loved it. The color did turn out yellow due to the spices, but any Indian rice we've had was yellow so we thought it looked correct. It definitely wasn't white.

Very fragrant, nice rice. Freezes well, too (this is a big recipe)I'd add more of the veggies and almonds next time. A keeper.

Judging from the previous reviews, I made this for a dinner party. It was a disappointment--the spices gave it an ugly beige color, rather than Indian basmati white. Flavor is ok. I won't be making it again.

I made this for a company Christmas potluck dinner and for Thanksgiving last year and both times, received wonderful kudos from friends and family. It was super easy to prepare for even an amateur cook like me, and sooo delicious and fragrant. Even my notoriously picky 4-year-old nephew asked for more! This Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law asked if I could bring this dish again. If I could, I'd give this rice dish 10 stars. One thing to remember are the slivered almonds. I usually don't like nuts in my food but the toasted almonds really make this already yummy dish spectacular.

This recipe was truly superb - and, this critique is from an Indian. I halved the recipe and it turned out great. (I also omitted the almonds...didn't want the crunchy texture.)

Oringinally, I made this as a side dish - with tandoori-style chicken and a yogurt/cucumber/tomato salad. Since then, after hints from my husband that I didn't really need to make the other two dishes with the rice, it has become a regular comfort food for us. I add some shredded chicken, a dab of yogurt on the side, and some veggies or a salad... and he's happy as a clam. Okay, so it's hardly the gourmet standards that some like to aspire to, but a VERY yummy meal in a non-dinner party sort of way.

Great company dish! Made it tonight to accompany Tandoori Chicken Kebabs, and we had a true Indian feast. Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing next time.

I can't agree with that last "only a rice dish" comment. This is a fabulous rice dish. The toasted nuts really compliment the nutty quality of the basmati, and it's got a nice little bit to it. Wonderful with traditional Indian, but also a wonderful way to pick up an otherwise simple meal.

I made this recipe for an Indian themed dinner, along with red lentil soup and Indian vegetable patties, and it was absolutely fabulous. We eat a lot of basmati rice at our house, and everybody loved it. We now have a new favorite rice dish.

This is definitely one of my favorite recipes. My husband loves Indian food (and humors me by eating my knock-off versions) and this recipe is really tasty and easy to make. It does make enough to feed a village however. But goes well with a lot of different things if you end up having a bunch of leftovers.

I made this dish for an Indian-themed dinner, and I don't like Indian food very much and I really don't cook much, either. But this dish is fantastic. I doubled the garam masala (commercial, not home-made), soaked the garlic, ginger, and jalapeno in Mongolian Fire Oil while I cooked the red onion (which provides a bit of color to an othewise unexicting-looking dish. I used rosemary-infused olive oil, which also adds a nice aroma that compliments the rice. This recipe makes a LOT of product. I used three cups of uncooked basmati, which produced a perfectly moist but not soggy or dry rice. This is a wonderful recipe. I'll serve it again, probably with chicken.

YUMMMM!!! I used whole cumin 1 teaspoon crushed it up in a mortar and pestal, sauted it in oil for about 10 seconds, added onion, garlic, garam masala a roasted chili,and cashews. This was outstanding!!!! I normally don't change recipes, this one I only did so due to lack of ingredients. Sooooo gooood!!!!!!!!

I loved this rice dish. I roasted up some spices and ground them to make my own garam masala. A definate keeper. I did cut the rice/liquid amount in half and it made more than two of us could eat. We had about 2.5 cups left over! (which I'm not really sad about)

I live in the Dominican Republic, where Indian food is sadly lacking. This dish was easy to prepare, included ingredients that I could find, pleased the whole crowd, and had a wonderful Indian taste. I will be making this regularly.

This is delicious! I followed the advise on the garam masala link, and added coriander seeds and whole red chile pepper to the grinder (couldn't find black cardamom). I also decreased the amount of cardamom slightly, and cut the amont of oil in half. It was hot without burning, and the flavors were just perfect- better than any I've tasted in a restaurant!

This was a real hit when I served it with Indian-Spiced Chicken and Spinach, a recipe from Wine & Food. It was also my first attempt at Indian cooking. I do believe there is a mistake regarding the amount of rice as I found a 12 oz box in the supermarket and not a 19oz size as stated in this recipe. It worked perfectly with 12 oz. and the rest of the ingredients. I cooked it on top of the stove and it worked beautifully. I even re-heated this in the microwave the next day to serve at a pot luck. I received rave reviews from people!! Delicous!!!

This is really good. I used 3 parts water and 1 part buttermilk for a creamier texture. I threw in raisins and cooked it stove-top rather than baking. It is easy and delicious.

I love this! Yum. I added some browned chicken and increased the garam masala a little bit to make more of a one dish meal. The first time I served it with a chunky vegetable salad with ginger/curry vinagrette. Second time with the Thai cucumber and peanut salad from this site. If you're having a cooking date, this is a fun and stress-free recipe for two people to do.

Great recipe with the potential to be excellent as I practice making it to my personal taste. Used 1 cup rice to 2 cups broth and reduced garam to 1/2 tsp; good for 3-4 people. My Indian boyfriend considered this up to par.

I made the garam masala with pre-ground spices and it was just fine. One teaspoon makes this dish! I'm not a jalepeno person, but I agree with another cook to leave in a few seeds for a kick. Try to use the basamati rice as I think it really makes a difference with texture. The amount was enough for a dinner party of six. Great with roast lamb.

I've made this twice now. First time for clients, and although very good, felt it needed to be beefed up a bit in the Indian spice department. The second time, I added a cinnamon stick and the seeds of two black cardamom pods. I make this in a rice cooker after the browning, and at home I did it stovetop. Both times came out excellent. This was an accompaniment to Tandoori Chicken which recipe was provided by my clients who are from Bangladesh.

This is one of the best rice recipes that I have ever made! The only change I made to this recipe because my family likes spicy food is that I left the seeds in the jalapena pepper. It was a huge hit and my guests went back for seconds.

This rice did turn out beautifully, and perhaps even more important, it's very user friendly. I took it out of the oven after 20 minutes, and had to let it sit on the counter for almost and hour before serving it, with no detrimental effects. That makes things easy! Taste and texture were both terrific, although I would add a tablespoon of tumeric next time to change the color from a dingy gray to a saffron-ey yellow. Finally, thought I'm not a "fruit-in-food" type of cook, I do think the addition of raisins at the end might have been nice.

All I can say is Y-U-M-M-Y!! This was absolutely delicious. The rice turns out light and fluffy and the flavors are perfect. I purchased bottled garam masala from my local grocery store which made this recipe a breeze. I served it with pan braised pork tenderloin and it was fabulous. I will DEFINITELY be making this again. Just be careful not to burn your almonds like I did. :-) You're going to love this one.
