Great dinner-party recipe. I use lots of parsnips and more onions. Also herb mustard from a jar to save time. Lovely!

I made this for my kids and they loved it. This was there first time eating some of the root vegetables.

We were looking for a way to roast roots and found it here. First time I substituted yams for turnips and added garlic. Herbed mustard went well with the meat.

I made this for a romantic dinner for 2 and what a hit! We had plenty left over. I substituted potatoes for the rutabaga. I think there are a lot of veggies that could be interchanged. Don't forget to serve the herbed mustard.
