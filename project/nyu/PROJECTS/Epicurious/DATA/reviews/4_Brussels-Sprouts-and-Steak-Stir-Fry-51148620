This is a real WOW! The sauce has a beautiful flavor. The rice vinegar adds a wonderful tang to the dish that really makes it special. I followed the recipe as written, except used a piece of top sirloin (about 3/4 lb) sliced very thin. The store was out of flank steak, which I definitely prefer, but sirloin worked very well. I doubled the sauce, but did not salt the meat. The extra salt is not needed with soy sauce (even low sodium soy is pretty salty) and oyster sauce (which is VERY salty). Loads of veggies make this really terrific. Even my Brussels Sprouts hating daughter liked this dish immensely. Definitely a do again and again dish!

Given the amount of preparation, and the 100% reviews, I have to say I was disappointed. Its certainly OK, but I have many other recipes that require less effort and are really delicious. So, I am not planning make this again. Sad, because I LOVE brussel sprouts...

This was delicious. Whole family enjoyed it. I doubled the sauce, used venison tenders (yummy), and served over brown rice. Check your sprouts and adjust cooking times accordingly.

Yet one more reason to love my favorite vegetable; this was so easy and quick and delicious.

Everyone in the family loved this and went out of their way to say so, even those not normally thrilled by either brussels sprouts or stir-fry. Great flavor without any one element overwhelming. I used 3/4 lb. of meat and 3 carrots, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. If you prefer your stir-fry really saucy, you could follow others' suggestion and increase the sauce, but I liked it as is.

Definitely a winner in our house! I expanded on some suggestions from other cooks: I marinated the steak in some of the sauce for about 2-3 hours and grilled the steak instead of stir-frying it. I also roasted the Brussels sprouts and carrots in the oven ahead of time. I used a wok for putting it all together at the end. As with others I doubled the sauce. The grilled steak, roasted sprouts and the sauce all blended for a wonderful dish!

This was a keeper. Loved the mix of flavors. Only change I made was to roast the brussels sprouts in the oven first rather than stir fry, then added them at the end. This made them a bit more browned and eliminated having to stir fry so they held together better

This was delicious. I followed what other reviewers said and did not salt the meat but doubled the sauce. It was a perfect amount to coat the rice and all of the ingredients.

I made this last night for my sons and I. My boys don't care for Brussels sprouts, so I used chopped cabbage instead. Instead of chopping the ginger, I julienne cut it as a vegetable (@1/2 cup or so)..we love ginger! It was so yummy, I decided to make it again with chicken and broccoli as the main vegetable. Increasing the amount of sauce was a good suggestion. This one is a keeper, especially if you use vegetables you have on hand or substitute your favorites. Yummy!

This was so tasty! Since it was a stir fry, I used a wok instead of saute pan and didn't bother with the portion about covering the brussels sprouts and they came out just fine (I don't like my sprouts mushy.) Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't like so much sauce and probably would cut that back just a tad.

FANTASTIC!

Delicious! The vegetables and other ingredients taste fresh and perfectly cooked. I will increase the sauce next time so it coats the rice and won't salt the meat as it was a bit too high in sodium. This one is going in my recipe box and will be shared with others.

This was fantastic! Lots of good flavors. Really liked that it had lots of veggies compared to the meat. I did 1 1/2 time the sauce, because we like extra sauce, and also added 1 teaspoon of cornstarch to the sauce mixture so that it would thicken slightly and better cling to the steak and veggies. Otherwise, followed recipe to a T. Will definitely make again.

My husband and I really liked this dish. It was yummy and satisfying considering the fantastic low calorie count. We will definitely make it again. I might go a little lighter on the ginger next time.
