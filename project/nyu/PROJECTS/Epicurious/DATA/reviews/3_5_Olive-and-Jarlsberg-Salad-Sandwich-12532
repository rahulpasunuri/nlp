My step father has asked me about this sandwich numerous times in the past ten years --- he still remembers it from a pool party at which I served it! Glad to have found the recipe again!

Perfect for a hot summer day! The blend of flavors is fantastic. DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT heat this sandwich! The reviewer who suggested this missed the whole point of this sandwich....it is supposed to be chilled so it is firm and therefore easy to cut and eat.

I think a key preparation step was missed here- the loaf should of been warmed before serving. I served it for a luncheon cold and no one liked it so the next day I wrapped the rest in foil and baked it until warm and it was much tastier

I made this for a wine tasting trip with friends. It got rave reviews. I, too, made it the night before. I was a little worried that the bread would get soggy, but it didn't at all. I would definitely make it again.

I used pumpernickel bread. Brought the loaf in to work two days after I made it and it was enjoyed and still not soggy.Very pretty presentation.

Delicious! I made this a day ahead of time for a work party (good idea because leaving sandwich in fridge over night keeps the thing together). Instead of Jarlsburg cheese, I used 1/2 swiss and 1/2 smoked gouda! Would be great to serve with soup on a cold day.
