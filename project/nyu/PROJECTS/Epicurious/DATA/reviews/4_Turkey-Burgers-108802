These are wonderful, with or without a bun. I don't add oats, wheat germ or liquid aminos - not items I typically have in my pantry. I usually use 2 medium onions, not 3. I make 1/4 lb. burgers, cook them all, and put the extras in the freezer for quick and easy meals. My husband claims he doesn't like ground turkey, but he certainly goes for these!

If you are looking for a BURGER flavor, this is not it. The texture, flavor and consistency are more like meatloaf. As a meatloaf, it is OK, but I have tasted better. As a burger, it is way to sweet what with the barbeque sauce and the onions. The oatmeal and breadcrumbs dont change the flavor, so arent necessary. The onion and garlic are good additions, so I would do that again and stick to savory seasonings and no filler.

The freezer trick works well. I put them in there in the early afternoon and grilled them in the evening. Got 5 burgers out of this and they took about 22 minutes on the grill. They are very unusual - very good, but not entirely burger-like... someone else said meatloaf, which I agree with. Nevertheless, absolutely delicious meatloaf!

I must say that, this was by far THE BEST Turkey Burger I have EVER had. I also used one onion, 2 cloves of garlic and 1 lb turkey....didn't have BBQ sauce so I used ketchup nor did I have wheat germ. I used fresh basil from my garden instead of dried. Like others, I put the burgers in the freezer for an hour then BBQed them, and they held nicely. My boyfriend and I were very very pleased with these, I will be passing this recipe onto my family.

This is easily the best turkey burger I've had to date. I didn't even have the onions, garlic, or bread crumbs, and it was still very flavorful-spicy, even-and exceptionally moist. Topped it with a dab of BBQ sauce and paired it with greens, brown rice, and Duck Rabbit Porter. I will definitely make this again, and with all the ingredients too!

These were great, very moist and flavorful. One onion was fine for one lb of turkey. I added a dash of Dijon mustard, a dash of hot sauce, and used just a shake of salt (which turned out not to be necessary). I'd add more BBQ sauce the next time. Also, they didn't hold together very well (more of a meatloaf consistency) so I will try putting them in the freezer to firm up a bit next time.

This is a simple straight forward recipe that uses ingredients already in my kitchen. I tried it last night and I will be using it on a regular basis. I also only used one onion and only one pound of turkey because that's what comes in the package. My mom went back for seconds. It only made four nice size burgers for me.

Following other users suggestions, I only used 1 onion and upped the garlic. Didn't have any wheat germ so used an additional T. of bread crumbs. There were moist and delicious. Only thing was that they kind of got charred on the outside (probably from the sugar in the barbecue sauce). I'll definitely make these again but probably use my Hamilton indoor grill instead of a Calphalon grill pan.

This dish was fantastic. I made it for people who are watching their weight, and they were suprised that there was no binding ingredient (egg etc). The onions really add flavour and make the dish. I did not have wheat germ, so I just added more oats and panko to make up for it. Next time I will add more basil and more oregano. My father even suggested that I add more BBQ sauce. Great for an easy cheap weeknight meal. I had everything on hand already!

These were good, but we found them boring - I'm sure there are tastier recipes out there. We found them too moist even for a turkey burger, the texture was strange, almost veggie burger like. (We did use a meat thermometer to ensure they were entirely cooked).

They came out very moist. I used macadamia-nut panko and no oats or wheat germ. Substituted medium hot sauce for the barbq sauce. Only used one onion. Cooked well on the Foreman indoor grill.

These were absolutely delicious! Often in the past I've found ground turkey to be dry and lacking flavor. Not this time! I happened to have some chopped onions in the freezer, so I used them....equivalent to 2 onions. The caramelization of the onions played a big part in the depth of flavor to these burgers. That, and I also used 2 cloves of garlic. I used salt, and I suppose if I were to be really picky I could have used just a titch less salt. Other than that I made them as printed, and I have already sent this recipe off to my daughter because I loved it so much. This is the kind of thing you could serve to a confirmed beef lover without protest from them. We put some cheese on top and didn't even need a bun because they were so moist. Oh, and we also made them in our electric grill, which cooks them on the top and bottom at the same time. They held together well.

I've made these several times and they are always very good. I don't add amino acid or extra salt. One onion is plenty! I usually freeze them for at least an hour and it helps them hold together on the grill.

Very easy and tasty. I did not add the wheat germ as I didn't have any. Also, grilled the burgers-came out moist and stayed together. Like other reviewers, I did not get 9 burgers-for us, this recipe made 5 nice size burgers. Also, only did one onion which was more than enough.

Pretty good overall. I wouldn't suggest cooking the burgers with cooking spray, as the first batch of mine burned on the bottom. Maybe a little vegetable oil instead.

Very good. I used matzo meal instead of oatmeal, and one egg. It holds the burgers together very well.

this was a great recipe. i actually omitted the oil and the oats and it was still juicy and moist (which can be a difficult thing to attain w/turkey burgers - esp the low fat ones) and stayed together quite well. i think cooking the onion and BBQ sauce right into the burger was delicious.

I didn't have wheat germ or oats, so I doubled the bread crumbs. My whole family loved it.

These were quite tasty. I had to skip the wheat germ and oats (didn't have any in the kitchen) and added an egg. My husband's comment was "These are good, and I don't think I've ever seen you eat anything that fast" YUM

These were very tasty. I used two onions, which was fine. I substituted ground flaxseed for the wheat germ and doubled the oatmeal instead of using bread crumbs. I found I needed to be careful not to let the burgers burn on the outside before they cooked on the inside.

I followed others suggestion by only using 1 onion. Substituted worcheshire sauce for BBQ sauce. Hubby loved them!

These were absolutely delish!!! But, there is no way this makes 9 burgers. I got six. I only used one onion, and that was PLENTY. My husband who HATES turkey burgers gobbled these up.

These were the best turkey burgers I have made. I also used just one onion which was plenty. I had just about 1lb of ground turkey. Added a bit of hot sauce and used about 4 cloves of garlic.

Delicious and moist. By far the best turkey burger I've ever had! I used one large sweet onion and two cloves of garlic.

Very goooood! I omitted the wheat germ and added Franks Hot Sauce and more BBQ sauce. Served them as 1/3 lb burgers topped with hot pepper cheese on a toasted bun and they were awesome. put them in the freezer or refrig though before grilling to help hold them together. Just make sure they are cold when grilled. Very lean and flavorful. Will definitely make again...and again.

GREAT. loved them. I froze them all and then put them on the grill frozen, they didn't fall apart at all. they were juicy too! One onion is PLENTY!

This was the best turkey burgers I have ever had. I didn't have the bread crumbs or the wheat germ so I just add more oats, although I threw them in the food processor until fine for a finer consistence. Also 3 onions for me is way too much 1 was just plenty, otherwise this beats any restaurant turkey burger to date!!! Delish!!!

We thought this was the best turkey burger recipe to date. I just didn't use as much onion, one was enough!

I replaced the oats with an equal amount of bread crumbs. The resulting bugers were simply great.

these burgers are delicious and especially flavorful and moist. freeze well. I use a home made barbecue sauce plus tabasco to add heat.

Quick and easy turkey burger recipe. Omitted the quick-cooking oats and the toasted wheat germ since I didn't have them. I substituted herbs de provence for the dried basil and oregano (herbs de provence has both of those ingredients anyway). Boyfriend who doesn't like turkey loved these burgers. This is a much better turkey burger than what you'll find in normal burger joints that make hockey-puck turkey burgers.

So scrumptious! Can't beat this recipe for flavor. I fry the patties in a scant amount of olive oil - first brown both sides, carefully watching that they don't burn because of the sugars in the bbq sauce, then I lower the heat, partially cover the pan and cook until done. We serve the burgers in toasted buns with Chiptole Chile Tartar Sauce from another recipe. Absolutely terrific combo! Recipe: 3/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons minced red onion 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill 1 tablespoon minced canned chipotle chilies (we use 2 T minced chipotles) 1 tablespoon drained capers (we omit)

These are pretty good, although I would use less herbs next time and maybe a little more bbq sauce. Quick and easy and I froze a bunch for future meals.

AWESOME! I plan on keeping several frozen in the freezer for quick dinners and company - rave reviews from whole family!

One of the best turkey burger recipes I've tried, with the following additions: Use only two onions and add 5oz sliced crimini mushrooms instead of the third onion. To give these burgers a little kick, use spicy buffalo sauce in lieu of the BBQ sauce. I agree that adding one egg to the mixture helps it stick together. Finally, definitely refrigerate shaped paddies for one hour, also aiding in keeping them together. Even my boyfriend, who normally can't stand anything but the "real thing," found these burgers to be the moistest of any turkey burger he'd ever had and ate two of them! Success!

I used more breadcrumbs instead of using the oats, wheat germ and aminos. I added an egg to help hold the turkey together (worked great), and a touch more barbeque sauce (Bullseye is great).The trick is to balance the consistancy before cooking so they don't fall apart.

Delicious!! A little hard to grill without it falling apart, tip-put them in fridge for 1 hour before cooking, this seemed to help....a little :)

These were great. I added 1/4 cup breadcrumbs, but they still came apart terribly so I'll increase the bread crumbs next time and maybe add some type of chili pepper to give me more heat. I didn't mind them falling apart because they tasted so good.

These are great turkey burgers. Instead of BBQ sauce I use ketchup and a few splashes of tabasco and worcesterchire. I skip the wheat germ and just sub an extra tablespoon of oats. I also skip the aminos. I make a batch and freeze them individually, then cook in a nonstick skillet. They freeze really well and stay nice and juicy. yum!

I added 2 Tablespoons of Chili Powder and 1/2 teaspoons each of Cayenne Pepper and Cumin and it was pretty good. I would add more onions and certainly more garlic next time. I cooked it on the stove rather than trying to grill it.

The onions and BBQ sauce added flavor and moisture to otherwise bland ground turkey. The burgers fell apart slightly when grilled. I used red onions and a very hot BBQ sauce. Next time I may use a little more dry ingredients to firm the burgers.
