PLEASE HELP ME! Does anyone have the Lemon Chess Tart recipe featured on the cover of Bon Appetit February 1987? I have the beautiful picture, but lost the recipe and do so want it again! Please post

Overall, very tasty and lovely colors. The crust was to die for - you could actually taste the coconut! It was such a pill to work with - very moist, that I thought it was ruined, but with TLC came out great. I would add slightly less water and chill longer if making it in the hot, humid summer again. I would also make 1.5 times the recipe- as it shrunk a lot and was a wee bit skimpy. The filling was nice, but a little greasy. The compote was unusual - I liked that it was raw for health reasons - added some blueberries too at the end. I would add a lot more allspice for my personal taste and a little black pepper and wished I would have added a little more nutmeg to the pie - I couldn't taste either. Refreshing, rich and lovely though overall!

I made this just as stated, except I couldn't get unsweetened coconut at the regular grocery store, so I used sweetened and just omitted the sugar in the crust. To the cook whose filling curdled: make sure the buttermilk is well shaken and the melted butter is not too hot.

the crust recipe is a bit disappointing. i would use this recipe:1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon table salt 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 6 tablespoons unsalted butter , chilled, cut into 1/4-inch pieces 4 tablespoons vegetable shortening , chilled 34 tablespoons ice water , then roll out on the allotted coconut or perhaps more, instead of flour, also i would rest the rolled crust in pie plate for 40 min in the fridge and 20 min in the freezer, do not prick the dough, and line with foil and weights and bake for 20 min on the lowest rack at 375.

Easy to make. Fantastic presentation. Your taste buds will thank you for taking a chance on a desert that may seem as plain as white paint. However, the raves from your guests will make you glad you gave this one a shot. Do it! You will not regret it.

This was a big hit. Delicious, if messy.

My man gives this 4 forks! Very good, very easy-- I had to sub. a plain crust, and berry sorbet for the compote. It was good just warm the first night, better cold the next day! I added an extra tbsp. lemon juice, but it could be more lemony still for my taste, and next time I'll add more zest. Rich, tasty, not sickening sweet but fairly sweet, we loved it.

To the cook whose pie curdled, I just purchased Edna Lewis's new cookbook: The Gift of Southern Cooking. And her recipe for Lemon Chess Pie states that without a doubt all ingredients should be room temperature or your pie will be eggy and curdle-y. the buttermilk, eggs, lemon juice etc... So try that and see if that is indeed the problem. Otherwise I HIGHLY recommend this cook book for beautiful, Southern recipes. A GOOD cook from the Atl.

Not bad, but for some reason, my eggs appeared to have curdled. No one else mention this-- any tips on how to prevent in the future? Had good flavor. The blackberry compote, which I'd thought about omitting, turned out to be just what the pie needed-- tartness to balance out the sweet filling.

Well, even though I've NEVER done it before, I was considering using a prepackaged crust on this one just because I was pressed for time. Thank goodness I didn't! The coconut crust makes the pie, really, and it was very easy to make. Just make sure you don't overmix it before chilling or it will be too tough. Everything about this was wonderful, and I'll be making it many more times!

I was trying to approximate my grandmother's chess pie recipe--this was different (more lemony and eggy) but delicious. I made just the filling in a standard pie crust. We served it chilled and liked it that way.

Yummy because it's buttery and lemony. The blackberry compote is both visually appealing against the yellow and it's a nice compliment to the lemon flavour.

Made the pie for my family at Easter and it was amazing. Rave reviews. Blackberry complimented well, although I have since made this using raspberries which worked nicely too.

This pie has become my special dessert that everyone ask me to bake for special occasions. I would suggest making the crust little bit larger for ease of handling.

delicious!! my suggestions: if you're lazy like me, a frozen pie crust works just fine. i tasted it warm, then cold as a leftover--i preferred the cold version, its a better texture and the lemon flavor really comes out! i simplified the sauce: just throw a bag of frozen rasberries or blackberries on the stove with some brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves and a pinch of allspice (also amazing over brie served with water crackers). oh, and don't skimp on the lemon zest!

Wow! An unbelieveably great pie! As everyone at the table took their first bite, all the eyes lit up and the smiles went from ear to ear. We've eaten at Morrison-Clark and should have known it would be this good. Can't wait to fix it again, and I don't even like coconut!

Fabulous flavor and texture. The crust "shrunk" a bit during the baking process. But that is easily fixed, I will allow for that next time. And there will be a next time--we loved it.
