I love this recipe. It's a little time consuming to peel the onions, but it's worth it. I made it as a Thanksgiving snack before dinner, and I was asked to make it again at Christmas. If you like sweet and sour, and you like onions, you will love this.

I made this as a topping for broiled salmon. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I used purple onion because it was what I had on hand.

Fabulous, easy recipe. I've made it about 4 times since Thanksgiving. I know it will be a staple recipe.

I made this with regular cooking onions. I selected smallish ones and cut them into quarters lengthwise, so that each piece would have a bit to root attached to it.

I used a 16oz package of frozen onions. Mashed, it was easier to serve with crackers or crostini. Excellent. Well recieved.

I used a 1# bag of frozen pearl onions. Very good!

Great cracker topping to compliment a cheese platter.

The flavors of this dish melded beautifully. I used 4 sliced yellow onions instead of pearl onions which I found easier to place and sit on top of the crostini. Sauteed the onions for half an hour in lieu of boiling/blanching until very soft and golden, then added the additional ingredients. I also finely chopped fresh rosymary in lieu of using and removing a sprig. This added a nice flavor. Made this with the roasted eggplant and red pepper topping in the same issue. Guests loved both and requested recipes for each. Would definitely make this again.
