This is a great, easy summer salad. I make it often as an accompaniment to grilled meats.

So-so. Not very exciting, fennel probably should have been sauteed. Too hard. Did a tiny dice of organic baby fennel and let sit for about 3 hours so had plenty of time to absorb flavor.

A MUST topping for grilled brined salmon & eggplant! I added fresh corn and it was FABULOUS!
