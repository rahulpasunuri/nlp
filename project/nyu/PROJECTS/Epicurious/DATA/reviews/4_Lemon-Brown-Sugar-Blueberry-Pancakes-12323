Lovely! Yes to all the lemon (I'm tempted to put in even more next time). Yes, to the reviewer who suggested 1 tsp cinnamon. Yes, to using 2 tbsp brown sugar. I also added one scoop of vanilla protein powder to the mix, without altering anytbing else as it's a fairly wet batter. A definite remake!

I also added a scoop of vanilla whey protein powder (didn't change anything else as the recipe is fairly wet). Amazing taste - it's a big yes for me!

Scrumptious! Simple, and very quick. I used almond milk instead of milk... also coconut oil and butter melted together b/c I had more coconut oil on hand. So good, every bite, yum!

I make pancakes often and these are the best I've ever had. I did make the following changes: whole wheat flour instead of white, buttermilk instead of milk, a bit of lemon juice as well as zest, less brown sugar (2 tbsp), and a dash of nutmeg. Absolutely delicious!

These pancakes were excellent. I made a couple of minor adjustments. First, I was making the pancakes for my housemates who are allergic to dairy, so I switched the milk to almond milk. This worked very well. I also took a couple of the suggestions from previous reviews and I increased the flour from 3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp to 1 cup. I also decreased the brown sugar from 3 tbsp to 2 tbsp. I used fresh Canadian wild blueberries. I will definitely use this recipe again. The lemon complements the blueberries very nicely.

heavenly...husband declared these the best pancakes he's ever eaten! not the slightest bit chewy. (maybe that reviewer's baking powder had expired or something.) i did turn the heat down a bit though. griddle was too hot, so the first batch was a little sloppy looking. i happily ate the ugly ones.

Wow, these pancakes really hit the spot. I have been making the Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes recipe on this site for years now, but I actually think this recipe beats it to a pulp. The only thing I would recommend is to use 1/2 to 3/4 the amount of lemon zest stated. I can see how it might be too overpowering for some.

These pancakes sounded so good but they came out way too chewy and the zest just didn't agree with my 9 yr old son. They need to be more fluffy to taste better.

I am not a pancake lover...these however, may just have changed my mind. I was looking to make pancakes with huckleberries, and had no buttermilk - couldn't be happier with the result. The lemon zest combined with the tartness of the huckleberries was heavenly, especially when drizzled with ginger syrup! Delicious!

Great recipe, the lemon zest adds a nice change to the traditional pancake. I added a touch of freshly grated nutmeg to the batter, and I used Trader Joe's frozen organic wild blueberries as I didn't have fresh ones, turned out wonderful, just make sure to rinse and drain on paper towels before adding to batter, as they will turn the batter purple. I would definately make this again.

These had great flavor. It reminded me of a blueberry lemon muffin. I made the batter as listed, and it didn't make enough for my family of four. Next time I will double the recipe.

Absolutely out of this world. BUT... I do think the proportion of flour is incorrect. The way the recipe is written makes for a very loose, very liquidy batter -- I used a full cup of flour (basically 2 extra Tb than it currently calls for), and they turned out perfectly. Also added 1/2 ts of cinnamon and 1/4 ts of cardamom -- awesome additions.

We absolutely love this recipe! I didn't have any problems with the burning in the pan like some of my fellow reviewers. I also threw in a bit more sugar as my blueberries were a bit tart. It was a nice treat and just a bit more special than traditional Bisquick with blueberries.

Oh hells yeah. These were so good! Served them with a blueberry compote (also on this site) and vanilla yogurt since I'm not big on syrup. Made with lactose free milk since my boyfriend is a lactard, and even though there was butter it seemed ok to him. Later served them up to my office for Friday morning snack day breakfast and everyone loved them. Either that or they were just being really, really nice. Try these!

When I made these I melted the butter and addeded it when it was cool (not HOT) added another 1/2 TB of brown sugar and took out the salt. I used a nonstick oan and didnt use anything to coat the pan and kept the heat at a really moderate level - yes it takes longer but the pancakes cook though and evenly with out burning. I also add the blueberries by hand when the batter before it bubbles and needs to be flipped. (They were a HUGE hit with the whole house! ages 1 to 50)

Very delicious. Used 1c. frozen wild organic blueberries with good results. Going by previous reviewers I increased flour to 1c. total and made my first pancake using pan release to coat the pan, instead of additional butter. Batter took almost 5 mins. before bubbles formed on top to indicate that it was ready to turn over. By then it was pretty much burnt. I believe that the batter needs to be thin in order to cook through before br. sugar burns. Added about 2T. of milk back into the mixture and from then on the pancakes cooked up tender, fluffy, and not scorched. Leave flour as is.

These pancakes are yummy. Next time I make them, I'll use more flour (the batter was runny). I added about 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon which wasn't all that detectable, but probably added something.

Love these pancakes, though they burn easily. Maple syrup does not sound like a good match to me, so I eat them with citron honey from Trader Joe's - wow! (My SO liked the maple syrup combo, however.) They're what I make on weekends when I can get blueberries.

I made these for a father's day brunch. everyone liked them. I actually made them the night before and stored them in the fridge overnight and warmed them in the oven just prior to serving - that was a nice timesaver. I served them of course with real maple syrup...I will add a smidge more brown sugar next time. Other than that I would not change a thing. Tasty!

Pretty great recipe here. I can't eat gluten so I had to sub the flour with a mix of rice/potato/tapioca but they still turned out nice and flufffy! A bit runny on the pan, but some reshaping fixes that, and yes ... they do take a bit longer then usual to cook. Very light and fluffy though. delicious!

Very good pancakes, but watch them as they cook. They burn easily because of the sugar content.

I just made these pancakes and they're fantastic. I used meyer lemon zest since we have a meyer lemon tree outside and I used a little extra. I also added a little vanilla paste. The only thing I would suggest to do differently is the first pancake I cooked in butter, but the butter immediately turned brown and burnt-smelling. So I switched to vegetable oil which worked very well. This recipe also makes the perfect number of pancakes for a hearty breakfast for 2. I'll definitely be making these again.

I substituted wheat flower for white which made the dough too thick and the first couple cooked very slowly, but the consistency was better when I added in more milk. Also added diced walnuts and a ripe banana which were delicious and made them more hearty.

Nice, light pancakes with good texture. The lemon zest adds an interesting twist. Served with lemon pear marmalade which enhanced the flavor; without the marmalade, I found these rather dull.

These were SOOOO good. I used a mixture of dark and light brown sugars (ran out), and had a little trouble with the temperature. Even though they all turned out a little "well done" they tasted fantastic. Great texture, lots of flavor. Can't wait for more.

WOW! My new favorite pancakes! I only used about half of the lemon zest called for simply because that was all I had on hand. Other than that I made no changes!

A great weekend breakfast!I didn't mind that the batter was a bit runny. A little reshaping and they were in pancake form. Very light, not heavy. So we could eat more of them!

Really good. Not excessively sweet. Just lemony enough with the peel of one big lemon. Didn't need syrup.

Very quick and tasty. Loved the lemon flavor and the texture of the pancakes wasn't too "doughy" (which I hate). Will definitely make again, maybe next time with a different fruit.

I was looking for a quick way to use up the last of the blueberries. I didn't have brown sugar or lemon. I burned the butter due to inattention. But the pancakes are SO good. They puff up nicely if you let the batter rest a few minutes. A great quick recipe to have on hand....

Double D-licious! The best blueberry pancakes my husband and I have ever had. We were hoping there was more batter - glad to know that doubling and more is not a problem, will be making these for family on a summer vacation. Perfect blend of flavors!

I just made these pancakes (without the blueberries, as they are expensive this time of year). I actually did 5X the recipe because of a miscalulation of the amount of milk, so I had to adjust the rest of the recipe to match. They still turned out fabulously! Some recipes become a mess even after only doubling, but this one held when multiplied 5 times. I didn't have enough lemons for that amount of zest, so added some of the juice too. They turned out light and fluffy, although it seems to take a bit of a long time to fry each batch. Served them with jam and whipped cream. My husband and his friend were genuinely (key word there!) raving. And my two year old says, "Nice camcakes!" Wonderful flavor because of the lemon....

The lemon zest really makes this version of blueberry pancakes stand out! I substituted non-fat vanilla yogurt for a third of the milk and that added some nice tang as well. Doubling the recipe doesn't seem to be a problem, either, though if you're making this for family budget some extra time -- this took a little longer to cook than my regular pancakes. Definitely a keeper!

My husband asked for these pancakes, almost every weekend. The brown sugar really makes this recipe. If I don't have real lemon, I used dried lemon peel & it works ok. Add a little vanilla too.

Growing up, my dad would always take my family out for breakfast on Saturdays. And every Saturday, without fail, I would order blueberry pancakes. So coming from a blueberry pancake lover, this is a REALLY wonderful recipe! You won't be disappointed in making them!

I was slightly hesitant about trying a new pancake recipe as I have a favourite that I make almost every weekend. This recipe, however, was really good! The lemon flavour is great and the brown sugar really carmelizes and makes the pancakes a deep golden colour. It's a keeper!

These fabulous pancakes work especially well with wild blueberries. The 'cakes are more crepe-like and less like the light and fluffy variety. I've made them 3 times now and they have always been fabulous!
