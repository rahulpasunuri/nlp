Absolutely delicious. Entire family, including 5 year old, RAVED. Made it almost exactly as written, only omitting the last two tablespoons of butter at the end because the sauce looked so good as it was I felt I could leave it out without sacrificing any flavor. Used POM pomegranate juice, and it boiled right down into a beautiful syrup in 20 minutes. Served it with Seeds of Change Organic Dharamsala rice blend (ready made in a pouch, couldn't be easier or more delicious) and a quick salad of figs, avocado, and sliced almonds over spinach drizzled with a bottled balsamic reduction. Whole thing took maybe 45 minutes. Tasted out of this world.

This was easy to make and delicious. Living in Israel, all the ingredients are handy - skirt steak is the hardest thing to find! And a friend just brought me whole fresh sumac from Istanbul. The port-pomegranate sauce/reduction is out of this world. I was literally licking my plate. I served with a simple side of thinly sliced zucchini sauteed in butter and garlic.

Use pomegranate syrup available at middle eastern stores and there is no need to reduce or add sugar. I served this with roasted brussel sprouts with pine nuts and roasted sweet potatos. Great sweet/savory meal and healthy!

Simple, low effort, and delicious. I will definitely make this again! I followed the recipe exactly, using ruby port, but next time I may try the pomegranate molasses that others suggested since it would significantly shorten the time-to-table.

Absolutely delicious and unique flavor. Preferred the reduction to the molasses. I double recipe to have leftovers as once is never enough with this dish....

I live in Istanbul and we have an abundance of all the ingredients. Unfortunately my dish was not a success. Im thinking our pomegranate juice here is not the typically sweet juice found in the States. We have a pomegranate molasses but that is very tart. I doubt it would give the same effect. Any suggestions?

I made this for valentines day and it was OUTSTANDING! Absolutely delicious recipe, we loved it! Made the house smell delicious and the taste was out of this world! This is a winner! WOW! A+!

I used the pomegranate molasses, and it's a surprisingly tart sauce. For us, the saving grace was using the meat juices in the sauce. That seemed to temper it. Served w/couscous. Have mixed feelings about the level of butter--w/o adding meat juices, it's too much butter. But again, the juice made the difference.

Everyone once in a while a recipe is everything you wish for......this is one. Find a Mid-Eastern grocery store that carries Sumac and make this. It made enough for 6 - I ate half in one sitting!!!! There are so many flavors competing for recognition it is difficult to quit eating. It will be interesting if the taste is still there in left overs. DO NOT pass this recipe up!

I found this recipe while browsing around for a pomegranate reduction and I'm glad I made it. As per other cook suggestion (thanks) I used pomegranate molasses. This is a great dish, sumac gives a great flavoring to the meat and the tangy pomegranate sauce is really delicious. I served with mascarpone mashed potatoes. Not sure if my broiler is not so great, but it took 4- 5 minutes on each side to be medium rare. This is a keeper!

This recipe was wonderful! I used a rose Cotes du Rhone and the flavor really blended nicely. It's so hard to find a store that sells sumac.

Delicious. Used a whole beef tenderloin and served with creamy spaetzle, sauted mushrooms, blue cheese gougeres and a 2004 Chase Cellars Hayne Vineyard Zinfandel. The flavor complements were wonderful! The smells during preparation sublime.

It was hard to get the meet cooked right, every time I peeked, it looked raw, but the end product ended up cooked well but tough. I would probably use a different cut next time. Sauce is very sweet and tart. My 3 year-old loved it. The butter seemed excessive. Found sumac at the store sold in a tiny box (Whole Foods).

This dish is the bomb! Totally company-worthy. The complex, unique flavors completely disguise how completely easy this is to make.

I've made this dish twice: first without the sumac and the second time as written. I found sumac at a middle eastern grocery store, but if you can't find it the dish is still exceptional.

Everyone I have made this for loved it. I prefer it with lamb. The only down side is that it always takes me longer to cook it than the recipe indicates.

I have made this three times and each time it turned out great. We just love the sauce. I will try the pomegranate molasses next time and see if we like the sauce as well as with the juice. In any event, it's a recipe I will make again and again.

I've made this twice now, to rave reviews from my OH. The sumac mixture tenderises the steak nicely, and the sauce is a nice combination of sweet and sour. As others have suggested, I use pomegranate molasses instead of the reduction, and it works a treat.

This was fabulous. I had to order the sumac on the Internet, but well worth the effort. I made this exactly per the recipe. I will definitely use sumac again and again, as the meat was very good even without the delicious pomegranate/port reduction. Next time I plan to grill the meat, rather than broil it(if the weather ever improveds!). A definite keeper and repeater.

Have made this twice and love it for its simplicity and savour. But here's a little tip: instead of reducing pomegranate juice, a costly and time consuming procedure, go to a store that specializes in mid-east products and purchase a bottle of pomegranate molasses, a syrupy dark liquid that will equal the recipe's reduction. Two tablespoons, added after the port, I found to be just the proportion. Don't add the lemon juice in the recipe since the molasses already contains it. Sahadi Importers in Brooklyn carry this product. Once you have this authentic molasses you will be making this recipe once a week, it's that easy !

Finally made this last night and my husband thought it was the best ever. I used flank steak and rubbed it with the sumac/salt rub the night before. I grilled the steak outside. All in all, easy and delicious.

We used flank steak but otherwise followed the recipe. The sauce was great!!

My hubby and I loved this one!!!! I rubbed a flank steak with olive oil then generously sprinkled it with shallot salt, pepper, and plenty of sumac. I let it sit in the fridge overnight and grilled it instead of broiling. I followed the directions for the sauce and the results were amazing! Will definately make this again.

GOOD!!! It was hard finding the Sumac but worth it. I made no alterations to the recipe and we all loved it!

The sumac, a spice I'd used once before in a recipe from, I think, Azerbaijan, made a brilliant rub for the skirt steak. The pomegranate sauce was remarkable. This dish was simple to prepare except that, as with any reduction, close attention is necessary to get the reduction to the right volume without boiling too much away.

The sauce was a delicious way to enhance the flavor of the meat. The pomegranate juice reduction wasn't as sweet as I was afraid it might be. Really great and simple!

This was amazing, and fairly easy, even though there were a lot of dishes. Instead of cooking the steak in the oven, I just cooked it on the stovetop, which worked pretty well. I also didn't have any port, so I just used some of the chianti I was drinking, and it turned out beautifully. Definitely making this one again... especially because I bought sumac just for this recipe, and I don't really know what else to do with it! Served it with the Zucchini Mash from this site... really good mix: the zucchini stood up to the flavour of the sauce without overpowering it, and was good for mopping up the excess sauce.

I made this with dry aged skirt steak that was delicious. You can taste every single flavor in the sauce, it's great. Just make sure you don't reduce the pomegranate juice too much, it's pretty sweet stuff. We made it with the roasted garlic dip and pear, pancetta, and arugula salad for an excellent meal.

Excellent. Different, but not wierd. 3.5 forks. I couldn't find skirt steak, so I used London Broil. Cooked it on a gas grill. I was out of port, and liquor stores weren't open, so I substituted sweet vermouth. I'm sure port would have been better. Next time I am going to double the pomegranate reduction. I ended up having to add some red wine in order to have enough sauce. I can imagine the pomegranate sauce and sumac seasoning on a rack of lamb for Christmas dinner.
