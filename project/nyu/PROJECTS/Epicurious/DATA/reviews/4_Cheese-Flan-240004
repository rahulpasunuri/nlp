I had been wanting to try making flan for a while but was short on time (aka couldn't wait for something that needed to set overnight) so I decided to try this recipe since it can be served warm. It turned out delicious, very rich and creamy. The only part that didn't turn out ideally was the caramel, which was a little too liquid and not as dark as I would have liked, but I think I left it get too hot. Will most definitely be making this again.

I have made this twice, now, and it's a great recipe. The only part that is a pain is making the caramel. The flan is definitely best served warm. I also serve garnished with lots of raspberries and blueberries. It's very rich and a good dessert to share.

my sister and I have been taste testing every place that sells flan near Citifield when we go to a Mets game--this flan recipe recreates one of the best flans I have had. The addition of the cream cheese adds a nice density. I used whipped cream chees and it was superb

I literally had a dinner guest tell me they dreamed about this after my dinner party.

Made this for my book club meeting and it turned our perfectly. Everyone enjoyed it and we had some real devotees of Flan there. Great served warm or room temperature as the recipe describes.

Very easy to make. I didn't have a cinnamon stick so I threw a vanilla bean in there. I put it in a 9" cake pan and baked it at least 1.5 hrs. It is very dense and rich and people at our mexican fiesta loved the dessert.

An excellent Flan recipe. Make sure when making the caramel you pay attention when it is turning amber, it quickly goes to "burnt" from there. It is great warm or cold.

I made this for my bookclub and was presently surprised with how easy it was and how good it tasted. It's a nice cross between traditional flan and cheescake. I used non-fat milk in lieu of the whole milk. My only issue is that being my first flan making, it took almost twice as long as recipe says.

Has anyone made this in a large dish rather than ramekins? any tips on cooking time? thanks in advance!

I was excitited to see all the positive reviews-- but was disapointed with the results. The consistency was not the crisp clean one I associate with flan.

I cooked this recipe last Saturday for a dinner party and all my guests agreed that the flan tasted better cold versus warm. Great recipe as it creates a "cake-type" flan with some consistency. Also good because its not too sweet. Will make again.

Very good! A cross between cheesecake and traditional flan. I liked it best cold.

This is a real FIND! I used low fat cream cheese, egg beaters,2%milk, and no fat sweetened condensed milk. It was amazing served warm with fresh blueberries! It is so rich and creamy!

I have never been a big fan of flan, but I thought I would give this a try as my Argentinean husband is a big flan-lover. It was outstanding! Almost like a like cheesecake... I can't wait to have another one for dessert tonight. I did use non- fat condensed milk, and next time I will try using low-fat cream cheese and skim milk...that way we can eat it more often. :-)

Cheese Flan is delicious. My friends enjoy this twisted flan! Instead of 5 eggs, use 3 eggs. Also, instead of whole milk, use evaporated milk. Serve it cold, tastes better! I have cooked this flan for 10 years. Also, you can add fresh pumpkin puree(not from a can) with cinammon. Good to serve with the Turkey dinner on November.

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE, I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS. NOW TRY A TWIST AND REPLACE THE CREAM CHEESE FOR BREADFRUIT,IF YOU CAN FIND IT!

This is a fantastic recipe. I cheated and used no fat cream cheese and eggbeaters (forgot to buy the eggs) for a lower fat, lower cholestrol version and it came out wonderful. I agree with reviewer that it is best warm or at room temp. I have a suggestion for the next time around. Place the rametins in the hot water prior to adding the carmel, it makes it a lot easier to swirl as the carmel won't set as fast. This recipe will definetly go into my "this is great" recipe list.

This recipe is fantastic! The caramel color gets deeper the longer it chills. Even people who make flan have made the comment that this is something really special. I am a professional chef and plan to use this recipe in my restaurant. It gets a great response from everyone. I disagree with the previous reviewer - serving it warm or at room temperature releases the complex flavors.

This was pretty easy to make. I burned the caramel the first time and didn't make it dark enough the second time, so that is the trickiest part. I preferred it cold to room temperature.
