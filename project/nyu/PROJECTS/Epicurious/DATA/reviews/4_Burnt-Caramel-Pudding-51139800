Easy, simple, amazing flavor. LOVED it, I may have done something wrong, but portions were really small. I would make 1/2x more for 4 people.

Delicious dessert, and easy to make! Couple of comments: a bit too sweet for me, so I'll try cutting the sugar next time. If you serve it with whipped cream, make sure it's unsweetened. Also, no need to let the cream mixture oool before adding it to the egg -- just make sure you temper the egg with a bit of the hot mixture first.

LOVED this pudding! Mine came out a lot darker and browner than in the photo, I wonder if that's because I burned the sugar pretty brown? I didn't even strain it because I poured it into the ramekins being careful not to get any of the cream "skin" into the mix. Anyway, it's smooth, rich, simply delicious! Will definitely make again!

One of the very best desserts I've ever made, and not as challenging to make as you may think. The bitter caramel taste is sophisticated and delicious. The texture was silken. I'm looking forward to making this again soon!
