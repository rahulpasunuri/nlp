No forks, this recipe is a waste of time and effort. Nothing like what you get in Italy. My advice is to find another credible recipe he misses some steps

I made this recipe for a tableful of Italians on Easter Sunday. I don't understand some of what they said, but it was happy--the zeppoli disappeared quickly, even without the chocolate sauce. I made the recipe as is. A couple of notes: My dough required double the rising time, even left out in a warm kitchen. Also, I didn't have a thermometer so the oil got too hot and the second batch were not cooked through before getting browned. But the first batch were light as air, and the lemon zest was a perfect touch. Will definitely make this again.
