I added four ounces of italian sausage and fennel and it was delicious.

Don't think I can give this a rating because I changed it a lot, but I thought it was a great jumping off point. I made the beans with lots of garlic and a bouquet of parsley, rosemary and thyme. I added red wine to the ragu, as well as dried red pepper flakes, oregano, thyme, and basil. I added fresh parsley, thyme, and rosemary. I also added 3 or 4 cups of spinach. This really turned out wonderfully, but I wish I had crusty bread to soak it up!

This one was a big "Eh" for me. Made it for the first time for my mum in law and was a little embarrassed that it was so unthrilling, since it took so long to make. Anyone seeking a good tomato/bean recipe should try the smoky greens and beans recipe on this site. Much, much tastier, and super fast to make. I tweak mine with extra herbs, like oregano and rosemary and add more garlic. Super good

This recipe was a disappointment. I agree with other reviewers who said that it was quite bland, and it needed lots more salt to bring out the flavours. It also never really thickened up - perhaps its because I used the cooks shortcut for the beans rather than the overnight soak. Surprisingly it was better fresh than the following day. Noone was in a hurry to eat the leftovers.

This is delicious and so rich in flavor. My husband LOVED it, as did my 5-year old daughter and her two friends! They couldn't stop eating it. Organic, vine-ripe tomatoes work well in place of the grape tomatoes. Added extra garlic for stronger flavor. Instead of using the water reserved from cooking the beans, used vegetable broth. Excellent. Would be a complete meal with bread and either a salad or vegetable frittata.

Delicious! Wouldn't change a thing! To Whiterock, could you have accidentally used beans that you used as pie crust weights? I did that once - hahaha, big mistake!

This is good as a side or a light main course, but I'd agree with others that it needs some more flavor thrown in - more garlic, herbs, tomatoes, red pepper flakes, whatever you have around. Great with garlic bread and a green veggie.

Being a bean lover, I enjoyed this dish more than my husband did. It is hearty and warming. However, it could use some more sauce and flavor. I think next time I will add some crushed red pepper or cayenne for a bit of spice. I will also add some sauteed spinach and possibly italian sausage. I think some fennel would go a long way to improve the flavor as well.

Made this recipe and added some roasted potatoes and spinach to it. I also had to add some canned crushed tomatoes for extra sauce. I also cut some of the beans. It was very good with the changes I made to it. I think this would also be good with rice or even pasta.

I thought this dish was fine, but not anything special. There are too many beans and not enough flavorful stuff. I suspected as much and cooked the beans in chicken broth with a handful of garlic cloves, increased the tomatoes, thyme, and onions. Still, the dish was just OK. I recommend using a Dutch oven rather than starting in a fry pan and switching to a casserole.

This is a delicious recipe as is, or a super base for other recipes. I have used it both ways, and when I add a little sausage and diced chicken thighs, my family devours it. I have to add some diced tomatoes to this to give the dish enough sauce...yummy!!

This was delicious. I only had 1 pint of cherry tomatoes, so I made up the rest with whole tomatoes and it worked fine. I sauteed some kale to go with it, but like the idea below of serving over breaded eggplant and will definitely have to try it!

I've made this three times and it's always a perfect meal. Just add some crusty bread.

I thought this was excellent, I halved the recipe, made it with dried tepary beans from Rancho Gordo, used the tomatoes I had in the garden (normal red tomatoes and some green grape cherry tomatoes) and it turned out delicious. I also made it 8 hours ahead of time and baked it for dinner with no ill effects. We served it over eggplant we had breaded and fried and I really liked the crunch of the breadcrumbs as an addition. Will definitely serve it over garlic bread or something similar when we have it again.

I thought this was a delicious recipe. It could use a little pick-me-up, though. Perhaps more herbs. I might try the sage that someone else suggested. The second day, it was phenomenally better than the first!

This was nice and light and very easy to prepare. It's the kind of meal you just feel good after eating. I cooked the beans in chicken stock rather than water to give it a bit more flavor, and I added three times the thyme that was called for. I still think it could stand to have some more herbs to boost the flavor as it was slightly bland. Next time I'll throw in some sage or maybe stir in some arugula before popping it in the oven.

This is a great summer recipe. The flavour is wonderful and it did not take long to prepare. I've frozen individual portion to take for lunches and it freezes well.

By the way, no sugar is necessary.

This is the casserole version of Pasta Fagioli (aka Pasta Fazool) - always a family favorite! If you don't have time to make the casserole, you can turn it into a 10-min meal by making it in a soup pot using canned great northern or navy beans (not dried) and tomatoes (diced, stewed, crushed - whatever you happen to have in your cupboard). In a pot, get your olive oil and garlic going. Throw in your onions, celery, carrots, or whatever else you want (all optional -- I often make it without any of these). Throw your beans and tomatoes in and heat them on medium. And Voila... a beautiful dinner in 10 mins.

I thought this was fantastic and even somewhat rich. I used the Great Northern beans and did not soak them over night. Don't let the naysayers and recipe tweakers deter you from makeing this dish.

I really liked this. Watch the sugar though. The first time I made it, my tomatoes were so ripe that any additional sugar would have made the dish too sweet. The second time I made it, the tomatoes were not quite ripe and I had to add a tsp of sugar. One a side note, I found a 2lb bag of these beans at a Turkish grocer for relatively cheap.

This was great! Served it with an arugula salad with artichokes and roasted peppers, an olive and rosemary baguette, and some white wine to drink for a nice, light summer veggie meal.

This is a great substitute for the usual summer baked beans. Tastes lighter, should be healthier, and should make the vegetarians happy. Use canned beans if the dry process bothers you, and start with the assembly steps. If you don't care about the vege's, I think some italian sausage would make this a great one pot meal.

Wonderful flavor! Great combination of sweet, garlic (I used 5 garlic cloves), and tang. I was worried it wouldn't hold up as a main course, but paired with a salad and a nice loaf of bread it makes a great meal.

Whiterock - sounds like your beans were old, it happens. These were wonderful!

What did I do wrong? I soaked beans 17 hours with changing the water 3 times. Simmered beans 90 minutes and still not tender. I used white kidney beans. I baked as directed then turned down oven as beans remained not soft for a total of 90 minutes. The flavour was good, but I did not serve as the beans were grainy. The dish was tossed.

This is a delicious spring dinner, light but substantial. The sauce is slightly sweet, slightly garlicky and is perfect for sopping up with bread. I found myself wondering how it would be over polenta, or with a different herb, like oregano, to pump up the mild flavor. Definitely a keeper!
