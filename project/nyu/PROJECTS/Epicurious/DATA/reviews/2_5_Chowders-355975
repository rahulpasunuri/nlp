I'm a fan of Julia Child's cooking. I wanted to make a seafood chowder so I gave it a whirl. I used 1 large onion (sliced) and 1c Progresso "plain" bread crumbs. For liquid I used 3c whole milk, 1c heavy cream, and 2c reconstituted lobster stock (Better than Bullion brand). I used white rose potatoes, diced about 3/8". The stock was quite thick. I kept the lid on while simmering to retain the moisture. After simmering, I added the meat from about 20 steamed clams and mussels, and the meat picked from one steamed Dungeness crab. After checking the seasoning I added 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp ground white pepper. The stock was lacking depth so I added 3 oz (2 shots) dry Vermouth. This resulted in a delicious chowder, albeit a bit thick. Next time I'll halve the breadcrumbs to 1/2c and omit the heavy cream to produce a lighter base. Very easy to make, too.

Too much onion! Made this as a vegetable chowder with carrots and celery. Added a pinch of thyme. Would use as a base recipe again, but cutting the onion in half.

Just want to point out that the chicken chowder recipe is actually for the corn chowder.
