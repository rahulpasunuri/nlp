I grated the zucchini and onion in the food proc. and squeezed as much liquid as possible thru a kitchen towel. Didn't have parsley or mint, used cilantro instead. Cooked these on my elec. griddle. They came out good, just not really crispy. Next time I'll fry in a pan w/more oil. Overall a good recipe.

This recipe is really wonderful. I have served it with a variety of creamy dipping sauces, and they go faster than any other hors d'oeuvres. A couple of pointers: Don't skimp on the first step. The drier the zucchini is, the easier the batter will be to work with. Don't knock the fresh mint. If you have it, definitely use it. It doesn't make the fritters sweet or dessert-like, rather it adds a bright punch of freshness that complements the rich cheese beautifully. Also, I have successfully made these on a cast iron skillet, with much less oil. Scoop with a small sorbet scoop, flatten a bit, flip when golden brown and finish/hold in a warm oven. Delicious!

These are YUMMY. Basically zucchini latkes. I used less onion, subbed tarragon and basil for the mint, and pan fried in grapeseed oil, latke style. Delish.

I hated zucchini fritters as a kid. This was my first attempt since then. They were delicious. I used fresh sage instead of the mint. Very good.

Made these with goodies from our CSA. Yum. Used the food processor to grate zukes, onion, and chop herbs, making prep pretty easy. I think these are delish!

I used a combo of dried oregano, sage, and thyme instead if fresh herbs. I also used seasoned breadcrumbs and replaced a little of the romano cheese with queso Oaxaca (similar to string cheese mozzarella). They turned out amazing.

I didn't have all the ingredients (no mint) but these turned out great. Very veggie/cheesy, rather than pancake-y like some fritter recipes. Even my kids liked them. Did patties in a shallow pan of oil like everyone else.

Made this tonight because the zucchini is coming fast from the garden and needed something different to make with it. So glad I tried this recipe! I had to make a few minor substitutions based on what i had around the house i.e.- yellow onion for red- country bread for wheat- didn't have fresh herbs-(and didn't use mint at all) and only had a 1/4 of cheese- and it was still absolutely delish! I didn't want to deep fry so I made more of a patty shape and pan fried with out all the oil. Didn't have plain yogurt- so tried a dab of sour cream for serving - very nice also tried with a bit of tomato sauce- really good. Looking forward to making this again with all the fresh herbs! PS The secret here is Squeeze squeeze squeeze the water out of the Zucchini!!

Really enjoyed these fritters. I did not have mint( didn't sound to good anyways)but other than that followed recipe exactly. You really have to squeeze the zucchini dry so the fritters hold together. I used a 3/4 oz portion scoop to shape and plop in the frying pan( I pan fried instead of deep fry). When I flipped the balls over I lightly pressed them so they were more patty shaped instead of ball. This was so they would brown up because I did not deep fry. Delicious.

This is a great recipe as long as you really wring the liquid out of the squash and onion mixture in a tea towel. Of course I was out of Romano, parsley and mint so I fried them as they were and mixed a 1/2 cup of pesto into the yogurt which made a delicious topping for the fritters. A really first-rate use for the ton of zucchini in my fridge!

Excellent. We are growing Zucchini for the first time this year so I searched the site for anything zucchini. I did not have mint so I added chopped fresh thyme and rosemary instead.

I twisted the zucchini and onion in a folded piece of cheesecloth to wring the extra moisture out. Everyone loved them. One guest said as he chewed, "They get better and better!"

Wow! These were SO good. The fresh herbs really make this dish, don't use dried. Also, I used my salad spinner to dry the zucchini well. I have a LOT of zucchini to use from the garden and I could eat these again and again.

This is an excellent use of summer zucchini. We've made it several times and realized that draining the zucchini for the suggested time is fundamental to the fritters keeping their integrity during frying. We've also adapted the recipe using chopped toast instead of bread crumbs for a meatier texture.

These are delicious. As others did, I sauteed them in a little oil. Also, as another reviewer suggested, use a clean kitchen towel to wring the extra juice out of the zucchini mixture. I had no problems with the fritters falling apart or being too liquid. Tasty!

Served these to a dinner party of 10. Not the most ambition eaters when it comes to something new, but they were all open minded and loved it! Combined this recipe with the grape-leaf spread and shrimp from another recipe and added a little cayenned and was fabulous! Definitely had problems with them being very delicate and not sticking together very well, but manage to use a little TLC and get them into the pan. Served them with Gold Chardonnay to rave reviews.

I wish I'd read all of your comments before I made this dish because it turned out to be a mess. Many of the fritters fell apart on contact with the hot oil because there wasn't enough egg or something to bind them together and they were watery on top of that. So I ended up with a few good fritters and a bunch more misshapen fried sculptures with bits of herbs flying off them. Crumbs and oil everywhere. Ugh. But they tasted pretty good. Next time I will try the suggestions like adding more egg and pan-frying. However this recipe must be chastised because it seems that most of the cooks had trouble executing it as written.

My husband and I were both disappointed with this dish. I used dried herbs instead of the fresh ones but otherwise stuck with the recipe using a deep fryer. Too much cheese, couldn't taste the zucchini. Not worth the effort.

Nice! For those with 'too wet' zucchini... try rolling zuc/onion mixture up into clean dish towel and twisting out liquid - mentioned somewhere else on this site and works wonders. I too subbed in parmesan and italian bread crumbs and pan fried. Makes a mid-week meal surprisingly special.

Very good. I grew up in an immigrant Italian-American community and rarely approved of Italian receipes not from my family. I took the appetizer to a dinner party, not knowing if any of them liked Italian-style food. I made this receipe verbatim except I added the juice of half a lemon to the yogurt. They loved them and ate everything! I would definitely make this again for a dinner party.

This entire issue of Bon Appetit devoted to the Mediterranean is filled with delectable recipes, particularly these zucchini fritters. I made them for a party and there was praise all around. I found that grating the onion and squeezing out all the moisture through a fine sieve helped tremendously in addition to salting and "juicing" the grated zucchini - after that, no problems with runniness. I only wish I doubled the recipe - they were gone before all the guests arrived... Try juicing one lemon into the yogurt, a nice companion that won't distract from the herbs and zucchini.

This recipe turned out great, but many things went wrong. I drained the zucchini for only 40 minutes due to time constraints and did my best to dry it. Nevertheless, it was too runny. So I added flour and cornstarch and another egg, then squeezing each zucchini cake as dry as I could. Next time I'll try extra bread crumbs. The seasonings were great. I couldn't get mint, so I used thyme. My kids liked it. The yoghurt didn't add much, but it didn't hurt either.

very easy and very tasty. I took another reviewer's tip and pan fried these like crab cakes. Simple and a lot less oil. Mmmmm.

This was a flavorful, wonderful taste. Don't skip the yogurt. My kids don't like anything but steamed veggies that don't touch on the plate so I expected it that they would be having cereal (they did). The adults loved it. I did have a problem with the fritters being a little runny. My zucchini were right from my garden but I did let it drip for an hour. Next time I will try pan frying and squeeze the zucchini with paper towels.

Ya know, if you're going to subsitute marshmallow peeps for the zucchini because you don't like green veggies, you're gonna end up with something less than good. This is a great, delicious recipe. If Campbell's soup and green beans is gourmet to you, then maybe you should find another site.

Fantastic. Beautiful and delicious. Used 1/2 the amount of zucchini to 100% of all other ingredients - no watery mess. Used fresh basil and oregano, domestic parmesan. Pan fried in butter/olive oil (1 inch if veg oil?) , didn't overcrowd, and just treated these babies like high-quality crab cakes. My zucchini-haters loved them.

These are so addictive. I make them just as the recipe states. In the summer I have to have them once a week. I serve with chicken souvlakia and tzatziki. Heaven.

These were absolutely delicious. I pan-fried them instead of deep frying and drained on paper towels, and served with Greek yogurt. YUM! Only problem was, they were way too runny. I added maybe an extra cup of breadcrumbs and they came out great.

These were SUPER. I also used the italian crumbs instead of wheat and basil instead of mint. All the herbs were fresh from my garden. I served mine with sauteed, fresh salmon fillet. My husband agrees that this was one of my top 5 alltime dinners.

These were wonderful. I drained mine well, even squeezing the zucchini in paper towels. Used what I had, parm instead of romano..Italian bread crumbs instead of wheat. I made up a dinner salad with a light dressing, sliced tomatos and put the hot zucchini fritters on top. It was delicious!!

These were yummy. I omitted the mint and added basil. The mixture seemed a little too runny so I added a bit of flour and they turned out great.
