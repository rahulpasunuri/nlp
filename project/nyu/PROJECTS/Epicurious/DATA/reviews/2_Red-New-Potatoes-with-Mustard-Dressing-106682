i found this dressing to be very oily, but still had a strong vinegar kick in it. i wont make this exact recipe but i will use it as a base for others alike. (to be fair there were some ingrediants that were omitted.)

I reduced the amount of ingredients since I was only using a small amount of potatoes, and I used 1 tbsp dijonaise to 3 tbsp red wine vinegar and 1 tbsp of olive oil and it turned out nice but not enough for me to want to make it again. There are so many other really good potato dishes on this website that I'll check out next time.

Based on the other reviews, I changed the recipe by reducing the vinegar and adding a tablespoon of mayonaisse, tawny port and a teaspoon of maple syrup to sweeten. It was delicious!

It had a strong vinegar taste. Way to much sauce for the amount of potatoes also. I would definetly not make this dish again.

Very strong vinegar flavour. My husband hated it and I thought it was OK but I wouldn't bother to make it again.
