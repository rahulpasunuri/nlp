After years of hearing about the Cranberry/Horseradish relish, I finally tried it this year. Incredibly tasty and a fun brightener on a Thanksgiving plate filled with starches. Will become part of our tradition from now on.

I love this for leftover turkey sandwiches! I add a little bit of wine vinegar because I like it more tart and I cut back on the sugar just a bit. Yum!

Every year, I find this recipe, and go straight to the comments to find the recipe from the Cook from Austin...so just wanted to say thanks! It is the best cranberry "sauce" ever.

Based on previous reviews regarding the overpowering nature of the horseradish I purchased the most mild form that I could find and used the full amount called for in the recipe.Loved it.Horseradish did not overpower.Nice change from the usual pork toppings.

thank you to the cook from Austin, that relish was the one I was looking for as my tattered copy of that issue was loaned out. The relish is very refreshing and a great change of pace from traditional cranberry sauces - great for the sandwiches later too.

I am surprised that you did not also include in your listing the Cranberry Horseradish Relish Recipe from your Bon Appetit 11/94 magazine. In my opinion, this is the best Thanksgiving issue you have ever done. That recipe includes 2 cups raw cranberries, 1/2 c sugar, 1/4 cup prepared horseradish and 1 tbsp fresh lemon, pulsed in a Food Processor. It is wonderful and I make it every year.

I have made this relish for years, and it is always a winner with horseradish lovers! Great with prime rib and/or grilled turkey.

Easy and delicious for those of us who like horseradish. I think it would be great with Prime Rib and spread on any meat sandwich.
