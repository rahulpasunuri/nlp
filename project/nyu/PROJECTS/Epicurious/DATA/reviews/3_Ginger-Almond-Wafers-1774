These came out rather hard, and the very intense ginger flavor overpowers any almond taste. I guess the almonds are in there for texture. Expensive ingredients for a so-so result.

I really enjoyed these wafer cookies. I also grated the ginger...and added some almond extract to enhance the almond flavor. Ended up with a nice balance between ginger and almond. Would definitely recommend these cookies...

This was my first time making this recipe and what I did differently follows: I grated the ginger. I divided the dough into 4 pieces and rolled them into a log shape, refrigerated them overnight and then sliced them into 1/4" wafers and baked them at 325 for about 16to 18 min. Watch carefully do not let them get to brown on the bottom. The recipe made 60 small wafers.

I've been making these cookies since the recipe first appeared in the magazine. They're always a hit. Mysterious flavor--no one can guess what's in them. Be sure to let the toasted almonds cool so they won't melt the dough. I make the cookies smaller than specified, processing the almonds a little more so the cookies can be pressed flatter, and forming the dough into 48 smaller balls. Try them!

This was easy to make and uses 3 kinds of ginger but it seemed to lose the ginger taste in the baking. If you want a very crispy, almost hard, cookie, this is it! I'd make it again if happened to have almonds on hand, but will look for more "gingersnappy" type of cookie.
