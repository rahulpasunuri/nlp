The pears I used were exremely juicy so I omitted the pear nectar and increased the sugar just a touch. It was wonderful and quite easy. The spices were pronounced without being too heavy. It smelled heavenly and we could not resist eating it warm out of the oven with vanilla ice cream. My family is already asking me to make it again.
