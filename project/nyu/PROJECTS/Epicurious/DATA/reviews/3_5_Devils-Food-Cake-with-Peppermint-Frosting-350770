Absolutely delicious! A great, rich chocolate cake. It is quite a lot of work, but well worth it for a special occasion.

Made this cake for my bookclub. It was as delicious as it was impressive. I made the recipe exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing. The only thing I would say is that you need to prepare - I started two days ahead - this isn't a last minute dessert, but well worth the time.

i made this wonderful cake and loved it.I did change a few simple things. I put one half teaspoon less peppermint in the white chocolate cream, and also one half cup less of cream. It was a pain cutting it. Because of the loose whipped cream, but other then that it was a hit! I made it for a birthday cake for a 17 year old and every one munched it down. What a beautiful cake. thank you Bon Appietit for this wonderful reciepe.

This cake was good but a lot of work. I should have reread the reviews before making it - I definitely thought the peppermint flavor was too strong, would have preferred the white chocolate cream without any peppermint at all, and the cake was a bit crumbly - maybe some mayo would have helped, as someone suggested. I used my stick blender while heating the sugar/egg white mixture on the stove and it took less than 5 minutes to reach the marshmallow cream consistency, then moved the bowl to my Kitchenaid and it fluffed up just fine. Will keep parts of this recipe but won't make again as printed.

I made this cake for my supper club's Christmas gathering - it turned out beautifully and tasted amazing. This is a bit of a labor intensive recipe, but well worth the time and effort put into it. After reading some of the reviews, I halved the amount of peppermint extract where required, and I used a different recipe all together for the marshmallow frosting (I found a recipe that uses marshmallow fluff as the base to make the frosting - was very easy). Would definitely make this again for a special occasion!

I've just read up this type of icing in Joy of Cooking, which calls it boiled white icing. They recommend cooking the sugar syrup first, then at the temperature where it streams off a spoon in thick threads, trickling it very slowly into the egg whites as you beat them. It says this cooks the egg whites as you beat them. I don't know whether this would be more reliable than the combined approach described in this recipe, but this version does seem to let a lot of people down.

I'm only doing the frosting, as it was my daughter's wish to have a vanilla cake with peppermint frosting. I've had the same problem as many others - the frosting recipe just does not work with my equipment. After 20 minutes of hand beating over barely simmering water, I got the marshmallowy consistency. I then put it to beat on high with a hand blender, and this completely destroyed the consistency of the frosting, returning it to liquid. Attempts to revive it by hand blending have not worked. It seems a waste. I suspect there is some sort of problem with using a hand blender for this recipe - if you have a standard mixer as described by the recipe it may be the way to make it work. Leaving out the water might also help. In the meantime, I need to figure out how to turn this into a frosting in some other way. It does at least taste great, if you like the sort of peppermint patty flavour - because it's essentially just mint and sugar.

excellent! if you follow some of the other suggestions. First of all be sure to use big enough pans. 9" round and definetly 2" high. The cake recipe makes lots of batter. Line with parchment and I use pam to spray. I put the layers in the fridge after the ganache and again after the white chocolate cream. I did not even bother to make the peppermint frosting and instead made a whipped cream frosting also has cream cheese and vanilla frosting. will def make again.

This cake is phenomenal...especially with a few modifications. First, use parchment to line the bottom of the cake pans because the cake WILL stick if you don't. I recommend adding 1/4 cup of either oil or mayonnaise to the cake mix. It's just a little too crumbly otherwise. (Not necessarily dry; just crumbly). Refrigerate or freeze the cake before cutting it and before stacking the tiers in order to avoid crumbling. I found that the most successful way to assemble the cake without having it collapse (as it did the first time I made it) is this: apply the chocolate ganache to each of three pieces and refrigerate. Once the ganache has solidified, add the white chocolate cream. Refrigerate again for about 1-2 hours. Now you can stake all four pieces successfully. FINALLY, I recommend using a vanilla buttercream for the icing OR simply making more white chocolate cream for the icing. The marshmallow frosting takes about 4 times as long to make as the recipe indicates and it just isn't good. It's a bit of a misfit too--the rest of the cake is so rich and luxurious. The marshmallow frosting is just "blah" in comparison and detracts from the cake's grandeur.

The reviews are a big help to me. I have always had this thing with peppermint and when I saw this, I had to really finish the reviews just so I will not make a terrible mistake and waste money and time along the way. Thank you for sharing the reviews. really appreciate it :)

This turned out very well for me. My family loved it. I read the reviews before I did it, so I was pleasantly surprised when it came out. However, this cake is not for the novice, since it is fairly expensive to make, fairly time consuming, and if you aren't comfortable "troubleshooting" then it might completely botch. I agree with other people that the number one key to this is chilling after each new icing application. I put ganache on all three layers, chilled all three, then applied the buttercream, chilled all three, then stacked them. I then chilled the put-together cake, and made the frosting. It took me much longer than 9 minutes to get the "ribbon-creating" consistency, around 20 minutes or so. But it worked out well.

HooEEY! I cheated and used a different Devil's food cake (Devil's Food Cake with Brown Sugar Buttercream) and it was fantastic! The other cake recipe would have easily made Four layers, but I thought with all the trouble people had, I'd go for a safer Three (slightly thick) as it was for Christmas. So I did the Cakes Two days ahead, and did the Ganache and White Buttercream One day ahead. There were loads of all the fillings/frostings, I think even with Four layers there would mostly be too much. Keeping the Ganache at room temp, and chilling the white chocolate mixture thoroughly before beating the cream in until stiff worked perfectly for me. I also spread Ganache and chilled each layer, before spreading cold Buttercream and chilling, before stacking the layers. I forgot to add the water to the frosting, but whipped the other ingredients to combine before continuing to whip with an electric mixer over the heat. It thickened quickly and became a perfect, stiff Marshmallow Fluff off the heat with a little more whipping. I used bamboo skewers to stabilise the cake, just in case, but they weren't necessary in the end. The frosting (which there was far too much of) went on beautifully, and I covered the sides with chocolate curls and made a ring on top with crushed candy cane. I also halved the peppermint in both applications. Everyone was thoroughly impressed, and almost sickly happy.

Thank goodness for other cooks' reviews! This cake turned out fine, but with several modifications. And If I were to make it again, I would definitely do a few other things differently. THE CAKE: If you make the cake as specified, and use parchment paper on the pans and spray them well, and watch the cooking time carefully (i.e., start checking at 25 minutes), you will have a delicious, not too dry, chocolate cake that comes out of the pans with no problems. THE GANACHE: I had no problems with this as written. It was just the right amount and very delicious. THE WHITE CHOCOLATE CREAM: This is where things get a little hairy. I actually didn't make the peppermint frosting for the top and sides, and just used this cream for between layers. It is absolutely delicious, but as other reviewers have mentioned, it makes the layers slide off each other. Perhaps the white peppermint frosting could go over the ganache and on the sides of the cake, and then just make a small amount of this cream for the very top.

Rating: 4
After reading the reviews, I started way in advance and I think that is the number one tip for this recipe. Chill each frosted layer separately, and make sure the cake is completely cooled. I added a TB of mayonnaise to the cake batter and had no problems with dryness. Also used springform pans lined with parchment paper and butter/floured all; nothing stuck. I used a Cuisinart stick blender with a whisk attachment to make the peppermint frosting over the simmering pan and it worked incredibly quickly, even shorter than the suggested time in the recipe. Highly recommend it. The only issue I had was in chilling the cake since it is too large to fit in a standard cake dome and the icing got mashed into the lid. Otherwise a very satisfying recipe to create if time consuming.

This is one of my favorite cakes to make around the holidays and gets lots of rave reviews from family and friends. The one and only complaint I have about this recipe (one many who have reviewed it share) is that the frosting recipe is completely inaccurate. My husband and I spent 20 minutes whisking the frosting mixture over the stove by hand (way past the recommended 8-9 minutes) to get a thick'ish marshmallow consistency. I then set the mixture in the stand mixer for 10 minutes on high. When I turned it off, it was even runnier than when I'd taken the mixture off the stove. Making this frosting either requires some sort of master culinary technique that is not known by amateur cooks, or the recipe is flat out wrong. Otherwise, the cakes, ganache, and fillings are phenomenal. Will continue to make this recipe but perhaps next time explore a different frosting option.

I just had to tell how my daughter and I made this cake together for my 65th birthday. First of all it was incredibly delicious. some reviewers said the cake was crumbly and dry. so we used two devils food cake mixes, two boxes of instant devils food pudding, 8 eggs, a 16oz carton of sour cream, a cup of oil and two cups of water. we baked it in three 10 cake pans. we greased the pans with crisco and floured them and then sprayed the pans with pam. we baked at 350 for 45 minutes. when the layers were completely cool we split them in half and brushed the cut sides liberally with simple syrup. we made the chocolate ganache and white chocolate cream as directed,doubling the recipe. they turned out great and our cake layers were perfection. we spread on the chocolate ganache, the white chocolate cream until we had a 6 layer masterpiece. we inserted some very thin wooden dowels and had no slipping or sliding. we used the extra chocolate ganache and iced the sides filling in any spaces . the marshmello frosting was a complete disaster. it took over an hour of whisking over the simmering water to achieve the right consistency and then it was sugary and grainy like sand. we put two sticks of softened butter and two lbs of powerded sugar in the bowl of my stand mixer. we started mixing on low and then added two heaping spoonfuls of the white chocolate cream,about a cup and half, we turned the mixer to medium high and beat until fluffy. we frosted the cake with this delicious mint white chocolate butter cream. and oh yes, we reduced all the peppermint extract called for by half. Our cake was moist, creamy and rich with a hint of mint. hope this helps any one wanting to try the recipe. I always spray everything with pam and nothing ever sticks.

This recipe is absolutely delicious, however I did experience technical difficulties consistent with those of other reviewers. I will note that I used vanilla extract in lieu of mint extract and it tasted fantastic. First, despite using non-stick tier cake pans and buttering and then flowering the pans, I did have issues with the cake sticking to the pans. Also, the cake seemed a bit on the dry side and crumbled VERY easily. I think this has much to do with the fact that the cake recipe does not include oil. The next time I try to make this, I will definitely add about 1/4 cup of oil to see if the resulting cake is more moist and less crumbly. Second, my cake collapsed after I added the fourth layer. It did not help that the bottom layers became slippery with the white chocolate cream. My recommendation would be to refrigerate between layers to allow the cream and ganache to harden more. I will definitely make this again with the modifications I suggested above. You will not be disappointed with the result, especially if you use premium ingredients, including high quality chocolates like Ghirardelli.

Not an everyday cake... it's impressive because it is huge and rich, but it's hard to make it look "perfect," so keep that in mind if making for a special occasion. Followed directions more or less exactly and had no real trouble. Parchment paper might be good idea. Chill the layers between applying ganache and peppermint cream. Had to beat the marshmallow frosting about twice as long as recipe stated to get right consistency. Recommend storing in fridge - frosting did not harden as I had feared and it's the only way to keep it structurally sound. After making it, I felt like it was obscene and over-the-top and wondered if it was worth the effort. After eating leftovers for a week, I think it was incredibly good and miss it already!

A delicious cake but time-consuming to make. Next time, will use just the ganache between layers. The white chocolate cream made the layers slide and would make a delicious frosting. Plus, no one seemed overly enthusiastic about the marshmallow frosting.

I thought this cake was AMAMZING!!!! I started the whole layering process about three hours before dinner and guests arrived, guess I was lucky it turned out and stood up, after going through other reviews. I rushed the setting up time of the ganache and whipped cream layers by putting them in the freezer. However, I did not keep the finished product in the fridge so by dessert time it had become a tad wobbly!!!! I will make this again, and I will start much earlier allowing the cake time to set up and I will leave it in the fridge until it is time to serve. If one likes a chocolate and mint combination this is THEIR cake&hands down!!!!

My husband dreams of this cake... I made one for an office holiday party in December and my coworkers still talk about it. Really, really good. However, there are definitely structural integrity issues, so strategic chilling is key. Melt the white chocolate into the cream at least 24 hours ahead of time so it gets as cold as possible before you finish it, then after you finish the white chocolate cream pop it into the fridge or freezer for at least several hours while the cake cools. Then cool each filled layer in the freezer (we have a big chest freezer) during the assembly process. I have also propped up the cake with straws, then removed them once the white chocolate cream finally set. Also, last time I got lazy and just topped the cake with white chocolate cream and skipped the frosting. Not as dramatic, but honestly just as good.

This cake was a disaster. My cake crumbled, none of the ganaches were thick enough, and the frosted never became that. A whole lot of money and time wasted on what became pudding pie. I don't know how I messed up each and every step but how disappointing. Especially since I now have nothing to serve company. Never again.

I've been struggling with mine as well. Fortunately, my roommate is a pastry chef at Payard on the upper east side and he gave me some tips. A moister devil's food cake recipe is necessary. One with oil and buttermilk- have plenty of other recipes available on Epicurious. If you're in my position, and have already made the cake, make a simple syrup of half sugar and water and brush the tops. Then, FREEZE the cake as it's easier to cut when it's frozen and will make fewer crumbs. Love the rest of the recipe though!

I made this cake for my father. He loved it! It was very time consuming. I ommited the peppermint and used vanilla instead. The ganache really hardened in the fridge had to microwave to get it to soften. The cream filling was delicious. The cake was kind of dry. The marsmallow frosting was very runny and way too much. The presentation was beautiful.This was a very rich cake and plenty for a crowd.

I made this cake before I read the reviews. I agree that the cakes need parchment to get them out of the pans. I made 3 layers and one fell apart, so with the two left I made ganache with 1 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and no corn syrup, great with extra. I made the white chocolate cream with one bag of Toll House white chocolate chips and used this for the filling and the frosting, omitted the peppermint. This was a terrific cake! Much easier than the recipe, but a go to Devil's Food cake and the white chocolate cream frosting I would use for any cake. Very easy if you completely tweak the original.

I have to say - I used just the cake recipe for another purpose (caramel filled cake with chocolate frosting) and i seriously don't understand the problem people had. I had NO trouble getting this cake out of the cake pans (i used W.S. Goldtouch pans - no parchment) and the directions for time were completely fine. So to all you "not a novice in the kitchen" people out there, maybe you're not a novice, but you probably haven't been doing stuff right for the past however many years.

Didn't have time to make this cake into a production so I made the cake into mini cupcakes, stuffed them with the white chocolate cream and drizzled with dark chocolate ganache. Delicious! The cake was very moist and tender. They were a huge hit with our guests. Will definitely be experimenting with this -- maybe almond or rum cream instead of peppermint...

I have never been on this site and certainly have never made a dessert featured on Bon Appetit... but saw the picture and loved it... We were headed to a formal New Year's dinne r so before I actually read the recipe, I bought all the ingredients. then I got home, actually read the recipe and thought... "what have I gotten myself into??" but the cake was a HUGE success -- it looked beautiful and tasted even better! But this is solely because I took several of the recommendations. I am def NOT an experienced bake. So... my two cents. Key steps were the night before -- I baked the cake in 4 pans (rotating as suggested below), did the chocolate ganache and the first part of the white choc filling. I also added peppermint to ONLY the wh. choc filling (loved the comment about the 13 year old saying it tasted like a toothpaste cake!) The next day I did all other steps -- additional comments are I also need 30 seconds of the choc. ganache in the microwave, the marshmallow topping def. needs more time and I used a hand mixer. The most important step was that in between each layer, I put my cake in the freezer for 5-10 minutes. After it hardened up, I would then add the next layer. I shaved choc. for the top on the cake and added greenery from the tree to the base of the cake stand. I wish I had a picture - - it was gorgeous and delicious!! For 10 people, we had 1/2 cake left... the next day, we had a New Year's Day dinner with family and the reminder of the cake was still great and delicious. I will def do this again... Good luck and thanks to all of you who helped make my first Bon Appétit Dessert a success!

I'd like to add, it is better to use the pointers "DO AHEAD" it was helpful, i made the ganache and did the first half of preparations for the white chocolate whipping cream the night i baked my cakes the night before xmas eve. Xmas eve morning i got the second half of the white choc. preparations completed, put on the ganache, let it chill for 10mins then added the cream and assemble the cake & left that to chill while i made the peppermint thingy... a reveiw gave me that motive and it was helpful.

I didn't get a chance to bake the actual "devil's food cake" due to "cocoa shortage" in all of our supermarkets during the holidays, however, I did make a nice "white chocolate cream cake" using all the frostings. I made the Ganache, White Chocolate Cream & Peppermint Frosting as directed... they all came out perfectly and went really well with my the cake I end up making instead... Hopefully i'll try the actual cake soon;)

My husband saw this cake on the cover of Bon Appetit and decided that he wanted it for his birthday, so I make it for him. This cake tasted great... everyone loved it. However, it was alot of work. Based on some reviews, I did make a few modifications. The cake stuck in the pans, so I would recommend using parchment paper on the top. I ended up piecing the cake back together as I assembled it, though you couldn't really tell on the final product. For the white chocolate mint cream, I added the specified 1 cup to the white chocolate and chilled it. Then to prevent it from being too runny, I just added 1/2 cup additional whipping cream before I whipped it and put it on the cake. It made enough and I had no problem with it being runny. I also added a little less peppermint extract to the cream. For the peppermint frosting, it took me 40 minutes to get it to a marshmallowy consistency before I took it off the heat and beat it with my hand mixer. That seemed like too much time, but I had no problem with runny frosting, the consistency was fine. The chocolate shavings were necessary for me, because I had alot of cake crumbs in my frosting. We had 9 people eating the cake, and we didn't finish half of it it was so big, but everyone enjoyed it. With all the work, I would only make it again for a special occasion, but really the final product is a great tasting cake.

I made this cake for a Christmas celebration and modified it based on the reviews I'd read. I ended up just going with two layers versus four since four sounded unstable. I used the white chocolate peppermint filling for the entire cake and skipped the marshmallow frosting altogether since it sounded like a complete disaster (I still used the ganache as a filling also). The baking time for the cake was definitely too long and I had the same issue with the cakes not coming out of the pans very nicely--and I wasn't skimpy when I buttered the pans. Was good but more of a headache than I'd have thought given that it should have been a pretty straightforward cake.

Rating: 2
The end result was very tasty but it was quite a production to make. I had similar problems as other people here. The cake looked great but it was very hard to cut and serve and the layers started sliding one I cut the first piece. This may because I took it out of the fridge for about a 1/2 hr before serving. I also cut down on the peppermint extract. I used about 1/2 of what they called for in the white chocolate cream and didn't add any to the outer frosting. This was the perfect amount of mint for me. Overall I thought the cake was delicious but not sure if it was worth all the work.

Whew! Now I don't feel so bad after reading the reviews. This cake was a disaster!! First, the baking time for the cake was way too long. I took my cake out of the oven after 35 minutes and knew immediately that it was overcooked. Everything was going along fine otherwise until it was time to make the frosting...what a disaster! I am not a novice in the kitchen....the frosting ruined a perfectly good cake!! I agree with other comments wondering if you tested this recipe before putting it on the cover of a very important December issue!! I would make the cake again, but with another frosting. It made for a disappointing Christmas Eve dessert selection.

OK Bon Appetit, what is going on!? Your covers have been less than appetizing, especially Thanksgiving. Did you test your Xmas cover? It was an absolute nightmare! I am NOT a novice in the kitchen. Cake did not come out of professional pans, had to re-bake a different recipe. Icings were either too stiff or too soft to spread. Very stressful,very disappointing.

I had to chuckle at some of the reviews because I also had a disaster making this cake which I was to bring for a Christmas dinner. Good thing I had a cheesecake in the freezer. I wanted to cry as the filling oozed out the sides. This was so much work, not to mention the cost of the chocolates. Never again.

I made this cake for Christmas as well. It was wonderful! I made the cake, ganache and cream on separate days and then assembled and frosted on Christmas Eve. I agree the Joy of Cooking 7 minute frosting would have been simpler and I will do that next time.

The cake was delicious and the flavors were wonderfully balanced. It is not for the novice baker or someone in a rush. It was a bit like baking bread.... the total amount of active prep time wasn't huge, but you must tend to it multiple times during the course of the day. I made the recipes exactly as specified. The recipe for the cake part produced nice, even cakes that were very easy to slice into layers (something I usually have trouble with). In fact, it will be my "go-to" devil's food recipe. I made the fillings on the same day I used them, and the ganache spread just fine. I popped the cake into the fridge for 30min or so after each ganache application so had no problems with it running down the sides. The white choc filling was also easy (and not at all too peppermint-y). It shouldn't be runny-- you should whip it like you are making stiff whipped cream. Again, I chilled the cake each time after adding it. Frosting: it did take longer to 'ribbon' than the recipe said, but not much longer. It's a 7-minute frosting.... you have to work very fast, as the recipe states. If you do, it gives a beautiful, snowy frosting and the firmness allows you to 'sculpt' the edges as you work. I think it actually gives very professional looking results. I think that each component was easy and the overall key is chilling as you build the layers. The cake looked beautiful and everyone who shared it with us raved about it, so I would really encourage someone thinking of making it to go for it. I'd hate to see all these negative reviews dissuade someone from making what my friends and family thought was a fantastic celebration cake.

I made this cake for the family dinner on Christmas Eve because who could resist the picture. It was in fact delicious but the recipe is not a beginner it is most certainly for an experienced baker that can troubleshoot any issue that will arise. It is next to impossible to make all of the components and assemble in the same day so my suggestion is making the cake one day and the 2 fillings the following day and assembeling. From this point it can be held in the fridge and frosted at a later moment. The cake should sit out of the fridge for a significant time to allow the dark chocolate filling time to warm a bit but ideally assemble and frost and serve all within an afternoon because the dark chocolate ganache wants to set up firm and the white chocolate creme wants to deflate and run. If you choose to make the white chocolate creme in advance be sure to whip vigorously to restiffen the whipped cream mixture or you'll be guaranteed to have a frustrating sloppy mess. The cake is delicious and it looked like I frosted a hat box before we cut it but it provided the wow factor I was hoping for.

I thought this was very simple to make - although my wrist was sore for 2 days after beating the frosting for 15 minutes. I would highly recommend keeping the cake chilled until it's about time to serve - I left mine out too long and it pretty much fell apart when cut. The taste was phenomenal and I would definitely make this again, but I think I would make is with only 3 layers at the most and I would substitute the white chocolate cream for something a little thicker.

I made this cake with my granddaughter on Christmas Eve, great project, but very upsetting when the layers started to slide off. The icing took twice as long to make and almost impossible to spread, Finally in order to salvage the cake, we scraped off the frosting and discarded one layer, we then iced the cake with whipped cream. Had no problem with the ganache maybe should have whipped the white chocolate cream filling stiffer and used some of it to ice the top of the cake. Don't think anyone at Bon Appetit tested this one. Must say though, it was delicious. JL, Dollard des Ormeaux, Quebec

So, the cake was great (people were literally gasping BEFORE I cut it). But, a few tips: 1) Use only 1/2 the peppermint like everyone else says. I can't imagine it being twice as pepperminty, given how strong the flavor was. 2) Make Joy of Cooking 7 Minute Frosting instead of this recipe. No point in going through the usual Bon Appetit 5-hour hassle, when something can be done more simply in 1/10th of the time! 2) Keep the darn thing cool. Once you cut your first slice, WATCH OUT!!! The cake starts sliding and moving, and is almost impossible to cut. Truly, the cake was delicious, and my family loved it (made it for Christmas). But, it's a pain, and is not a clean cake once the service starts. Thank God it looks good before, and tastes good after!

We ogled this beautiful cake on the cover photo - as did so many. What a shame. Bon Appettit - did you REALLY test this? Experienced Aunt and Novice Baker Niece made this on Christmas Eve. Too bad we didn't read the reviews before we made it! Frosting: face it, the frosting recipe has incorrect ingredients and/or proportions. Never quite worked, and we gave it 2 tries. Even when we managed to make a thick enough frosting, there was only enough for the top of the cake and it was too stiff to spread. (BonAppettit, care to comment?) Basic 7 min frosting would be fine. Assembly: refrigerate cake as you assemble to keep it intact! Ganache: delicious and generous, not too stiff as some found. Batter: too much for just two 9" pans. We trusted the recipe and it overflowed. Peppermint flavor: excessive but overall flavors tasted great together; candy-like and very rich. Serves at least 15-18: a little goes a long way (cut into 4ths and slice each 4th into thin horizontal slices, not wedges - looks nice too).

Although it turned out just like the photo and tasted wonderful, I would not make this cake again because there are too many recipes to try and too little time. Thanks to one and all for the helpful hints. I used a good number of them and here are a few of my own for those who like to meet a challenge. To cut down on crumbs, I baked the cake in four 9" pans buttered and dusted with cocoa (a Martha Stewart trick), for a total of 18 minutes, rotating the pans from upper to lower racks and from side to side after 9 minutes. I chilled the ganache and white chocolate cream base overnight, then beat the cream filling almost to the point of butterization - no slouchy stuff here. Would make only half the ganache and thin it with cream as suggested. As everyone else did, I had to nuke it to make it spreadable - 40 seconds did the trick. Ganache all the layers before stacking. Add white chocolate cream as you stack them. Chill cake while making frosting. Place all the frosting ingredients, except the peppermint extract, in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat with a HAND mixer until well blended. Place bowl over a saucepan with about an inch of boiling water, making sure the water doesn't touch the bottom of the bowl. Beat constantly with the hand mixer for seven minutes - you should have a meringue that is between soft and stiff. Remove bowl from heat and place it on the mixer stand. Add peppermint extract and beat with whisk attachment until stiff peaks form - only a few minutes should do it. This is one recipe where a good stand mixer is worth its weight in cocoa beans.

LOVED IT! Yes, it was time consuming but after reading the other reviews I was determined to make this cake work for my family's Christmas eve dinner. I agree that that peppermint in the white chocolate is enough and that no peppermint needs to be added to the frosting. I also used a fluffy white frosting instead of trying to hassle with the oozing mess that the other reviewers complained about. Some other helpful tips- I chilled the ganache for about and hour and then just put it on the counter to warm a tish. I made the entire cake the same day so in the sake of time, I chilled the white choocolate mixture ofr an hour or so and then whipped in the other 2 cups. It whipped up great and I had no problem with the oozing on that layer. I also refridgerated the layers as I was working with cake. All in all, great flavor. The cake part was an excellent batter and baked awesome. I will make it again and I am glad I attempted the recipe in the first place.

I thought the cake was delicious and it turned out looking beautiful. Didn't slide around but the frosting was a mess. Next time, I would halve the ganache recipe for a thin coating between layers, keep in 2 layers (or do 3 8" ones), and use a regular seven minute frosting. I think there is enough peppermint flavoring in the white chocolate cream so can leave that out of the frosting.

MAKING THIS CAKE WAS A TOTAL FIASCO! This cake is not for the inexperienced or even experienced baker. We baked the cake and it wouldn't come out of the pans in one piece. So, I sent my mother running around DC looking for a grocery store open on Christmas Day to buy some boxed Devil's Food cake mix- which actually worked really well. The white peppermint icing is a block of sugar and does not crumb coat. Oh yeah, and the cake is so huge! Cut it in half and make four layers. At the end of the 8 hours it took us to make, it tasted good and looked pretty terrible. NEVER AGAIN.

I'm an experienced cook and have used dozens of dessert recipes from Bon Appetit over the years with great results, but this one was an unmitigated disaster. The white chocolate cream was too light to support the weight of 4 layers of cake and oozed out the sides like magma. I tried to salvage it by putting the side of a springform pan around it and freezing the whole thing - my fridge was full of holiday food so I had to bury it in a snowbank for a few hours. It still wouldn't firm up and kept sliding off the plate. I tried to hold it all together with the icing (which tastes like commercial marshmallow fluff - the kind we used to make fluffernutter sandwiches with when we were kids)but the icing was too runny. The whole cake looked like someone had emptied a can of drywall compound on a plate. I finally admitted defeat after over 5 hours of work, dumped the whole mess in a salad bowl and called it a trifle. When we did finally serve it (out of bowls) to finish off an otherwise wonderful Christmas dinner, it tasted so cloyingly sweet that most of the guests didn't finish it. Big disappointment to have to take this to a family Christmas dinner - I will NEVER make this again.

I made this for Christmas. I did the cake and the fillings yesterday and the frosting today. All was well until I got to the frosting. It took 20 minutes to get to the "ribbon stage". Then the peppermint taste was overpowering-I would use half (if any) of the peppermint extract. I had my 13 year old son taste test-he said it tasted like toothpaste. I'm afraid he was correct. I pulled out an XL sized tub of Betty Crocker (gasp) vanilla frosting. It was nowhere near as glossy and pretty as the peppermint frosting but at least I knew the kids would eat it. I would make it again with a whipped cream or vanilla frosting.

I'm actually not sure I'd make this again, just because it's a tremendous amount of work, but it was tasty. Having read the comments, I added 1/4 c. cream to the dark choc. ganache to improve spreadability, and reduced the 2 c. added cream to 1 1/2 c. for the white choc. cream to reduce oozing/sliding, which helped the structural integrity, but it was still a leaning tower of Pisa. It really looked like a Dr. Seuss creation with that weird crunchy marshmallow frosting, and it developed some unattractive cracks. If I did it again, I'd reduce the peppermint extract to 3/4 or 1 tsp. in the white choc cream--the peppermint was a bit strong. I might substitute milk for the water in the cake. It came out ok, it just seemed weird to me to put water in a cake. Folks seemed to like it, but it wasn't the knockout home run you want for the investment.

Just before the whole things went sliding to the ground, I managed to flip it into my trifle dish. All the flavors are wonderful but it would not stay together in cake form. It was a lot of work to come out looking like a trifle.

Decided to make this cake for my neighbor's annual Xmas party, as everyone waits to see what I'll bring. As with the previous reviewer, I could not get ribbons to form with my marshmallow base even though I also cooked it much longer. The frosting did stiffen up well and seemed firm enough. I stored it on my porch (about 40 degrees F) until I went to the party. Within 15 minutes of being at room temperature, the frosting and the cream filling started to melt and the layers started to slide around. The ganache was rather hard, and cutting the cake became difficult after the second slice, so most people got a messy, but delicious, cake pile. The cake layers came out great and it was very tasty, but not a very attractive presentation. Next time, I'll try the other frosting recipe referenced here.

I made this cake for my brother's 5oth birthday party. I made the cake the day before and as directed, wrapped the layers in foil and kept unrefridgerated. The ganache and the white chocolate filling turned out fine, although I'm not sure that the ganache really needed to be chilled at all. I think many who have commented here would agree: I too had to nuke it for a bit to get it spreadable, even after leaving it out of the fridge for awhile. I chilled the white chocolate filling for about thirty minutes while I worked on other things for the party, then assembled the cake. All went well until my marshmallow "ribbons" wouldn't form, even after cooking the frosting for at LEAST twice as long as called for. I finally ditched the simmering water and whipped the dickens out of the frosting with regular beaters in my big mixer because that's all I have. When the icing was really stiff (the recipe writer really meant STIFF), I started to frost the cake. When they say "working quickly", they really mean that, too. I almost didn't finish in time before the frosting was so stiff it was pulling crumbs off the cake. At one point in the process about an hour before guests were to arrive and still having lots to do for the party, I thought I had bitten off more than I could chew. I was never so glad that a recipe called for chocolate curls to cover up some crumbs in the icing! Nothing slid out, off or fell apart, and the cake actually looked pretty good. All in all, it was worth the effort. I thought it was delicious, the guests raved and I looked like I knew what I was doing - psyche!

This cake was great tasting, but unfortunately we did not eat in cake form. I had to put the whole mess into a trifle dish. I followed direction exactly and after getting the frosting on the whole cake just dissolved into a giant blob on my counter. What a disaster. My guests loved it as a trifle, but it was alot of work for a trifle. I would definitely use other reviewers suggestions to chill everything really well, and stabilize cake well.

This cake was delicious. Not everyone was into it like I was, but if you like chocolate and peppermint, this is a very worthwhile dessert. I'm with everyone else: the frosting was a disaster. My cake looked horrible! I didn't cook the marshmallow frosting long enough (though longer than the recipe called for), and it slid down the sides and pooled at the bottom. The chocolate ganache had been refrigerated overnight, and was hard as a rock; had to microwave it. The white chocolate was rather soft. And the layers did slide around. When I make it again, I'm just going to do 2 layers; it's so rich, 4 layers is kind of overkill, even with a thin sliver.

I made this for a Christmas dinner with some girlfriends last night, and ended up with a delicious and beautiful dessert that was a hit. It was quite labor intensive though, especially as I wanted to avoid some of the pitfalls other reveiwers have come accross. I made the cake (only 3 layers, since I did not have any cake pans with 2" sides, but had 3 regular 9" pans) and the chocolate ganache the night before. I found the cake itself to be very moist and tasty. The next day I made the white chocolate cream. The ganache had to be warmed in the microwave prior to using. I spread the ganache over the two bottom layers, then put the cakes in the fridge about 10 minutes to let it set. Then I repeated the process with the chilled white chocolate cream and stacked all the layers carefully. I set 3 wooden coffee stirrers into the center to stabilize the layers, and that worked very well. I then put the whole cake back into the fridge for 3 hours. I then made the peppermint frosting, and ended up hand whipping it for about 25 minutes to get it to the marshmallow creme stage. The 10 more minutes with the mixer and the frosting easily spread and did not even try to slide down the sides of the cake. Overall I was very pleased with how the cake turned out, but cannot see myself making this very labor intensive dessert again.

A very big hit at our house! My daugter (23) made the cake and ganache (which was exceptional thanks to our Belgian chocolate here..)And I made the frosting,But without Peppermint! It is, as another reviewer says, like the 7- minute frosting I usually make, (Good old "Joy of cooking") even better because it didn't crust up on the outside..!Be sure to cook the frosting long enough, I used a hand mixer over the gas, then continued with my kenwood like it said to do.

This cake was delicious but a bit too much peppermint. Also, similar to other reviewers, my frosting was a gooey mess and ran down the sides of the cake, pooling on the plate. Next time I'll use plain whipped cream frosting, which will cut down on the too-intense peppermint flavor. (The peppermint in the white chocolate filling is plenty to give you that candy cane flavor it's going for.) The ganache was a little runny, but I refrigerated each layer with just the ganache for 10 minutes or so and then layered the white chocolate cream on top and assembled it. This worked well. I also agree that you have to stabilize the cake or it may "slump" in the fridge. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the cake part was actually amazing, moist with a perfect texture and intense chocolate flavor. All in all, a great cake but needs a simpler whipped cream frosting.

Very tasty cake. Refrigerated it for a couple hours after it was assembled and didn't have a single problem w/ the cake "oozing" apart. My frosting did however not work and I'm 99% certain it was because I got a dash of yolk in it. My mom used to make a very similar frosting, called it "7-Minute Frosting" and that's all the time it took, the whole time on a double-boiler. Here's a link to a recipe, which worked every single time I ever did it as a KID! http://www.allrecipes.com/Recipe/Seven-Minute-Frosting-I/Detail.aspx

The cake itself and the chocolate ganache are some of the tastiest parts of a dessert I've made in a long time. But the frosting was a disaster. I tried to follow the directions the best I could, but after it cooled I was left with a horrible gummy mess. It looked like a gummi bear and a peppermint stick had a child and this was their evil spawn. This recipe either needs more particular directions or one should only attempt it with the help of a pastry chef. In the end I ran out of time before dinner and had to cover the thing with a butter/whipped cream frosting. It looked awful, but as I said the cake and the ganache are heavenly. Would only try it again with some serious tweaking.

If you are like me and are looking for a great peppermint cake for the holidays this recipe works awesome as long as you change out the cake part of the recipe. I tried this as written and found the cake very average. I then remade the recipe with the cake recipe from "Inside-Out German Chocolate Cake" and it turned out great. A couple of pointers for the people that had trouble with the cream oozing; frost each layer separately and freeze them until the cream is firm, then assemble the layers. Also do not keep the cake for more than two days in refrigerator because the frosting will start to crystallize.

This cake is just adequate. The cake itself is a very ordinary chocolate cake, not exceptional flavor or texture. The ganache is lovely (you only need to make 1/2 the amount the recipe calls for) as is the peppermint chocolate cream (use heavy instead of whipping cream for better hold and less ooze). The icing was too sweet and too sloppy. All in all, not worth the effort.

The cake is fantastic, though it takes several hours to do all the steps, so I would advise doing it the day before the party. I did not have any problems with the ganache, cream filling, or the icing.

Beautiful cake, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. The white chocolate cream filling was awsome, but oozy so make sure you work fast, stabilize the cake and put it back in a cold fridge immediately. I'd skip the outer frosting as well, it was like the marshmallow man exploded and dripped off the cake. I'll make it again and just use whip cream the rest of the cake is so rich.

The two forks was a rating of the recipe, not the flavor of the cake. I wanted to make a show-stopping dessert, but did not read the reviews, just went ahead and made the cake from my Gourmet mag--then read the reviews. Dumb! The cake in the fridge awaits me and my company tonight. And I'm nervous to say the least. Every problem I read about I had: stiff ganache, crumbly cake, goopy frosting, but in between all the chaos was the best tasting concoction I have made in the recent past. What fun to taste! What a miserable recipe! Anyway, it's towering in my fridge, looking pretty good now. We'll see what the crowd says. Hopefully I won't lose a layer between now and then!

I loved this cake. It was a bit fiddly to make but well worth it. The white chocolate filling did ooze a bit, but that should be easy to fix. I spread too much ganache on the layers, but it was still good. The peppermint marshmallow icing worked fine for me but did take twice as long to "cook" than the recipe suggests. I also, stabalized the cake with straws inside...it was a hit all the way around though!

What a beautiful looking photo! I couldn't resist. But what a mess to assemble. The white chocolate filling was too soft, oozing out the sides as I assembled the cake. The peppermint frosting never stiffened up and became a melted marshmallow goo dripping down the sides. Something straight out of Dr. Seuss (as a previous reviewed observed)! BUT looks aside, it tasted wonderful. I will try it again with less white chocolate filling and a different frosting.

Agree with all the other reviewers. This was a delicious cake, but what a mess! The chocolate ganache was too stiff & had to be microwaved. I refrigerated the white chocolate filling overnight and it was fine, until I went to frost it. My cake needed a crumb coat to cover the fillings and the messy cake, but there wasn't enough frosting. I ended up making a second batch of the labor-intensive frosting! I loved the crunchy contrast of the frosting and the flavors were great. This is a huge cake that easily served 12 guests, with leftovers to take home.

The cake worked beautifully until I tried to apply the peppermint frosting. Instead of being thick and spreadable it was runny and I had to literally pour it over the cake. It accentuated all the coarse edges that I thought the icing would cover up and it pooled at the bottom of the plate. The cake looked like a giant, bumpy marshmallow! I was so disappointed! After it cooled, it was nearly impossible to remove the parchment I used to protect the plate from icing and removing it pulled bits of the cake off. So, in the end, I was pretty sad (and embarrassed in front of my guests) about how it looked. BUT, it tasted amazing!! Everyone thought so. The marshmallowy outer frosting contrasted so well with the velvety white chocolate and the rich ganache. I considered making it again with a peppermint buttercream on the outside instead of the frosting, but then it might be too rich...but I can't really make it again with the original frosting when it looked so wretched...what to do, what to do...

I was so disappointed! I truly think the cake batter would be better using milk - it was too course and didn't taste as good as my usual cakes. If a cake is going to take a couple of days always under bake. Leave the water out of the frosting and I bet it will set better and not get sugary, part of my problem is I baked this in foggy WA affects egg whites. The ganache had to be zapped in the microwave to be spreadable and the white chocolate was too soft and had sat overnight. Maybe with this recipe if you used one cup between layers it wouldn't matter. Anyway don't think I will waste the time and money this took. Also, if you have an unstable cake, toothpicks will work, small dowels are better poked through the layers and the best place for transporting a cake is on the floor of the back seat area of your car.

I loved the flavors, and it was an involved but fun project. Like other reviewers, I found that the dark chocolate ganache was stiff and for me it required quite a long time in the microwave to get spread-able, but that was fine. I had no problem with the white chocolate cream being too thin - I made the cake as a 2-day project so the white chocolate cream cooled overnight. The big problem was the cake was JUST TOO TALL and that's why it was structurally unsound - mine ended up as a trifle after the first few slices were cut, and the top layers kept sliding around - very dangerous! Next time I'll make only 3 layers, and LESS peppermint frosting - I wound up with far too much of it, and it definitely wanted to slide down the sides of the cake. I also had an excess of dark chocolate ganache - I'll make half as much next time. The cake is chocolatey as it is, so the white chocolate cream is a nice contrast but the dark chocolate ganache is unnecessary flavor-wise.

Oh man, this cake is no joke. I have a Dr. Seuss mess sitting in the fridge right now. Next time (and there WILL be a next time, we're not done yet Devils Food Cake with Peppermint Frosting! MUHAHA) I will spread the chocolate ganache on each chocolate layer BEFORE placing them on top of each other. The chocolate was hard to spread, but the white chocolate was so oozy it make everything move around a LOT.

I'd make it again just to attempt to redeem this culinary disaster. Like other reviewers, the white chocolate cream was too thin and the cake was wobbly. I must have missed the mark with the frosting too because one it was on it kept on ooozing down the cake. I also used 8 inch cake pans because I didn't have 9 inch and this make the cake even wobblier. A trip to deliver the cake sealed the disaster as it slid over as I backed out of the drive. The cake did taste good but it eneded up a trifle.

The cake tasted delicious, but I have to give this recipe 3 forks because I also had an issue with the cake layers sliding off. I think maybe if I had put the cake in the refrigerator after putting the layers together, I might not have had the problem. It was a very tall cake though. I ended up salvaging the top two layers and making a shorter cake with those. I took the bottom two layers and put them in a trifle dish and added frosting as a top layer. I had no problem spreading the chocolate ganache layer. I made the ganache, put it in the refrigerator for about 1/2 hour and it was firm enough to spread and hold its place. I have a friend who made this cake today and also had a problem with keeping the top layer on the cake. Glad to know I wasn't the only one! My kids did love eating the mess from the counter!

Flavors were wonderful, but& The white chocolate cream was too soft. When cut, the white chocolate layer oozed out the sides. Once cut, the cake lost all integrity and fell/slide over. I would suggest changing the white chocolate cream layer to a white chocolate ganache. As a side note, I found the ganache very stiff and needed to microwave it for 30 seconds to soften enough for spreading.

Rating: 3
I agree with the first reviewer's impressions of the ganaches. The dark chocolate ganache was fairly stiff (I actually ended up having to heat it for a couple seconds in the microwave just to make it spreadable.) The white chocolate ganache was tasty, but was so soft that eventually the weight of the cake pushed the ganache out the sides. The layers rose in a slight dome shape - I should have shaved down to make them flatter as they didn't balance well when layering and I had some problems when moving the cake to chill. But the flavors were really tasty, the icing held it all together well and everyone agreed it was delicious. One guest commented, "This cake defeated me."

This was delicious. It was an all- day project, but worth it. I made it for a party, and everyone liked it. I had no trouble with the white chocolate cream, but chilled it a long time. The only drawback was that the marshmallow frosting seemed to ooze a little bit as the cake sat out -- probably could be avoided with more time in the fridge.

This was excellent, although it is definitely a big project. I did not have the same problem with the whipping cream as the prior reviewer - it held up fine and did not leak out, although I think I whipped it for a few more minutes in the stand mixer than called for. The outer layer of frosting got a little crusty after a couple days, so it's probably best for parties or other large groups. Also, the cake is so tall that it wouldn't fit under my cake stand dome. But it was very, very tasty.

I made this over the weekend.. i have to say the white chocolate cream did not hold itself and ooozed out between layers. it should be chilled again for specific period of time after you add the last 2 cups of cream in... 4 hours... I was frustrated.. the ganache was too stiff and white cream too fluid. but flavors were tremendous!!! beyond rich and equally refreshing...
