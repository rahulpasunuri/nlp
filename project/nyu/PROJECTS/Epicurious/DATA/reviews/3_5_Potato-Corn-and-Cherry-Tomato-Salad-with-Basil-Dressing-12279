4 forks IF you change the prep a bit - do not boil these wonderful veggies! Roast the potatoes w/olive oil and sea salt, grill the corn along with whatever meat you're eating that night, add in fresh tomato and that wonderful basil dressing - Ah! Summer on a plate! Sublime!!!

Loved this recipe...but tweaked it a bit. Used pattypan squash instead of potatoes. Cooked squash and corn on the grill. Used cherry and yellow grape tomatoes. Added a few cloves of garlic to the dressing ingredients (enough for flavor, but not to confuse with a pesto). Made my own white wine vinegar, more wine than vinegar. My hubby is still licking his lips.

Eh - not my favorite. Like others I used all fresh ingredients from the farmer's market. The flavors were just kind of muddled and didn't come across as bright and fresh as I hoped. It was fine - but ultimately would have rather used the ingredients another way.

This is easy to make and invariably results in requests for the recipe. I substitute canned white shoepeg corn for the fresh corn to make it even simpler.

This was so very good! I used fingerling potatoes and corn from the farmer's market, my own basil, and some local cherry tomatoes (which I left whole). I forgot the vinegar and apparently, didn't need it! I am adding this to our summer menu. Yum.

I thought this was pretty good. A nice summery salad. I liked the dressing (salt and pepper are in the directions but not the ingredients list for some reason). Next time I would add some dressing to the potatoes while they are warm so they absorb the flavors and are not so bland. This recipe reminds me of a similar recipe made with rice and smoked sausage. I think this recipe would be great and a main dish by adding some smoked sausage or the great sweet chicken Italian sausage we get around here.

great recipe to start, and great to do take offs from! try adding some smoked bacon crumbles...skip the basil and add some scallions. delicious warm or cold...OH, and be sure to grill the corn on the cob first...makes it super tasty!

This recipe was fine - totally serviceable, but nothing special.

Don't know what all the fuss is about, this dish is horrible. The flavors just didn't meld well to me. I even gave it at least an hour in the fridge. Tasted bad the next day too. Used fresh corn (a pain in the butt to cook and let cool for the salad). Used really good quality ingredients, I don't get it.

Who would think that such a simple salad recipe could be so good? I'm tempted to give this 4 forks, but I'm saving that rating for something that knocks everyone's socks off. I had every kind of vinegar except white wine vinegar, so I used 2 tbsp red wine vinegar plus 1 tbsp white vinegar plus 1 tbsp balsamic.

The suggestion to add parmesan to this salad did wonders! I found it a little bland before that.

I had a couple of leftover baked potatoes and ears of corn from dinner the night before, so I just picked up some basil and cherry tomatoes and threw this together. Very popular at my house, and I'll definitely be using the recipe again next corn-and-tomato season! I think the basil dressing could have used a bit more seasoning, though -- I'd throw a 1/2 t each of salt and pepper right into the blender next time, as trying to get the seasonings right after I dressed the salad was difficult. Maybe also throw in a T of parmesan, too. I also would add the tomatoes right before serving next time, as they tended to want to lose their juices.

Delicious, easy recipe to make. A summer favorite.

This salad is good, although it seemed like it needed alot of salt and pepper to make the flavors more exciting. Used fresh tomatoes, corn and yukon gold potatoes from the farmer's market, home grown basil and basil infused olive oil, but still needed the extra seasoning. The colors were ok (maybe b/c I used yukon gold instead of red potatoes), so I add shelled soybeans for a little more contrast. I would make this again for a summer party, as I typically have these ingredients on hand.

Easy, delicious, prepared exactly as directed. A fresh alternative to a mayo potato salad.

One of our summer favorites. Great for a picnic and nice side to any summer meal. I have been making this for years; my husband loves it too. Grill the corn for added flavor!

An excellent recipe I've been making for years to rave reviews. It is easy, but more time consuming than expected when making for a crowd.

This is a great vegan recipe! The fresh basil is wonderful.

I was a little disappointed. It wasn't bad at all, but some of the fresh sweet summer flavors seemed to cancel each other out. There are better potato salads on this site.

A great twist on potato salad. I have made this countless times and always received rave reviews!

I made this for a family bbq with fresh basil and potatoes from the local framer's market. Everbody loved it - colorful and delicious. I am looking forward to drizzling the Basil Dressing over some garden tomatoes this summer.
