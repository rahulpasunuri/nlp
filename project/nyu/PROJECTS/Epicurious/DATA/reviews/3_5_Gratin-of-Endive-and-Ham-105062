make a straight up bechamel, skip the mustard, get a really good cheese (eg beaufort) and vive la france.

I am living in France for a few months and always looking for recipes on Epicurious. In my husband's french family, a salad of vinagrette over endive is a frequent salad. And endive is in every market in bags of 6 or 8, which made me realize that although in the US I don't use endive regularly, here it is a staple. As I browsed recipes I came across this one. I had all the ingredients on hand (a jambon sec instead of regular ham). I sort of took Janine's advice and braised the endive in a mixture of butter and broth, then incorporated it into the bechemel. It was really good and my husband said it was better than he remembered it growing up. Will definitely make it again!

I lived in Belgium for many years and managed to get a recipe for Chicon au gratin from a Belgian boyfriend's mother (the recipe has lasted longer than the relationship). His mom used a mix of guyere, emmental, and gouda for the bechemel and as a topper. Make mashed potatos and put it on top, assemble as our Belgian friend instructed, and bake until the cheese is melted and crusty.

When I saw this recipe I immediately noticed the similarity to a Belgian recipe I've made many times. One of my own variations includes slices of smoked sausage, which, together with the cheese sauce is extremely delicious. And also, as a former reviewer stated, you should use some of the chicken-endive stock for the bechamel sauce.

I have made this recipe without the ham or mustard. Using a Bechamel sauce and adding Gruyere cheese takes this one a step further. Sprinkle lightly with breadcrumbs, then bake. Delicious with Prime Rib.

Have you thought of using steamed leeks instead of endive? Try it. Otherwise, I steam the endives first, let them cool and then add a traditional bechamel with cheese and bake for 30 minutes. I don't think the dijon mustard is traditional but, hey, sounds like it would add a nice zip to the bechamel. Easy and delicious for a cold winter night. By the way, the broth from the endive is bitter - so I would hesitate to add that to the sauce - although our Belgian reviewer recommends it. I'd say stick to the milk.

I am Belgian !!! And this recipe must have been invented by a Lower-Slabovian !!!The endive should be braised in butter untill tender, drained and all juices reserved to start a thick bechamel,(why throw out all the endive flavor with the broth?)+ enough milk for 2cups of sauce then grated swiss added to the bechamel, S&P, dash nutmeg. Pour over the endive rolled in ham. Sprinkle with more cheese and bread crumbs and bake till bubbly and golden brown. Serve with mashed potatoes for a main course. Or with crunchy bread and a sald for lighter fare
