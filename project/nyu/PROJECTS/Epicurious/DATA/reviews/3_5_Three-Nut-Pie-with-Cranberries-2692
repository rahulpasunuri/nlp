I wanted a traditional pie to balance with the pumpkin. I unfortunately did not read reviews and baked the pie as directed. Too long. The reviewer that suggested not cooking the crust first had it right. Otherwise interesting taste, the suggestions for chocolate or whiskey sound worth trying. I thought maybe next time to add preserved ginger bits.

Love this recipe..quick, easy and delicious. This last time I added a handful of bittersweet chocolate chips for an interesting twist.

I've made this pie almost every year since 1991. I'm only doing the review now because one of my guests asked for a copy of the recipe. It is a great pie. Like other reviewers said, the cranberries really help offset the cloying sweetness of the usual pecan pie. The 3 different nuts are also a nice twist, imparting a heartiness to it that we enjoy. This year I used chopped almonds (toasted with skins) instead of sliced almonds. Liked it as well as the sliced. Also added 1 Tbl of rye whiskey which my husband thought added a very nice flavor note. I use whatever crust I'm baking, just make sure it's not too sweet. I follow the rest of the recipe as written. I think the molasses is an important component, so I don't recommend dropping it. This year I had to bake it longer than 45 minutes, however. It did result in the crust being too browned, as I forgot to put foil over the crust. It may be my oven. I don't remember how long I've baked it in the past. I'm usually too busy to keep track. Just pull it out when it looks set.

I've made this pie for Thanksgiving for the last several years, and the family raves about it. For the filling, though, I use my standard pecan pie filling recipe, which uses only eggs, brown sugar, butter and vanilla - no corn syrup, no molasses - it's much easier and it turns out wonderfully.

I've made this pie every Thanksgiving since the recipe was published in 1991. It's now a real family tradition. As others have said, watch nuts toasting very carefully- they quickly burn. Reduce the cooking time and no need to pre bake crust.

Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews before making this pie. I followed the directions and it was overcooked. If you try this one take others advice and reduce baking time.

I'm glad Epicurious added the notes feature. I make this pie once a year and it's delicious, but I ALWAYS overcook it because I forget that 45 minutes at 400 is 5 to 10 minutes too long. My oven temp is accurate, but the crust gets too brown and the custard starts to burn if you leave it in the oven the designated time. The cranberry tartness makes this much better than too-sweet pecan pies. Definitely a keeper, this time with a big note to watch it and take it out of the oven sooner. :-)

There is no need to pre-bake the crust. The 45- minute baking time is enough to achieve a nicely browned crust. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and the crust was overdone-even on the bottom. Monitor nut toasting very carefully--they can turn from nicely toasted to burnt in seconds.

Excellent!! Nice combination of tart and sweet (regular pecan pie is just too sweet for me). I used one of those pre-made pie shells and it turned out fine. One recommendation is to not bake it so long. Next time I may try to drizzle chocolate on top...I once made a pecan pie that had a chocolate layer in the bottom and it was sublime. Nice second pie to make at Thanksgiving in addition to the traditional pumpkin.

A delightful alternative to pecan pie at the holidays. I've had several requests for the recipe. Delicious served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. I'm not crazy about the crust -- it is difficult to handle, so after a couple of tries I substituted my own favorite crust. The filling is a winner, though.
