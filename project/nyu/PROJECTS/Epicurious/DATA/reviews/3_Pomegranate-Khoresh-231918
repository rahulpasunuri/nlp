To those who didn't have the good experience of the food. This food is a traditional persian food and it has touhsands of years on itslef. Some of the comments in the text are inaporpriate like the added sugar or carrot, that sometimes might be used . sugar to add sweetness to sour pomegrante, if the pomegrante is already sweet you need to add some sourness!! so do not double sweet the food. also Carrot is for removing bitter taste of some walnuts. you have to blend the walnuts exteremly well and let it come to oil for cooking. the reason for watery cooking of this was that you have used a little bit if walnut, you shoudl add more. Also, I suggest you ask one of your iranian friend to cook for you to see how this works, or go to an Iranian restaurant, then you see the real cooking.

I made this recipe a year ago without a food processor and it came out incredibly watery and bland. I decided to try it again, making it for my boyfriend and a guest in a proper food processor. I left out the sugar, cooked the sauce down for an hour, and it was still sweet, boring, and unimpressive. The flavors didn't seem to work together and my guest didn't even finish his serving. Later he asked me about my "experimental cooking" and was surprised to hear that I had actually followed a recipe to make such a bland, unimpressive dish. I'm not going to make this again.

Traditionally you use ground walnuts and put them in with the onions and you don't add any oil because as you heat the walnuts , the walnut oil will that is diffused is enough for the dish. Also the cooking time is much longer, It should come together before you take it off the stove , it should be thick. If you have never had fesenjoon you should buy some form sadaf.com before you make it so you know what it should look and taste like.

This recipe is NOT going to make it into the 'make again' file. It tasted like nothing. And, putting it over saffron rice just tasted odd. The sauce was too watery, carrots were out of place and the overall flavor was bland and boring. It looked interesting but the vomit color it ends up as is very unappetizing. At least my daughter got to try pomegranate seeds for the first time...the only bright spot in this otherwise disappointing meal.

I'm not ready to review this recipe yet, but I would like to make it. I have pomegranate molasses on hand from a Iranian friend, but I'm not sure how much to use. Do I substitute a portion of the POM juice for the molasses? The molasses looks pretty thick, and I'm sure I should only use a little. I would like a more authentic dish. Thanks to anyone with advice!

Delicious! I used fresh-squeezed pomegranate juice, (not the bottled POM kind,) and cut the sugar in half, and it was a tiny bit too sweet, but still delicious. I left out the carrots, and simmered it for about an hour to get the sauce thick enough. I would recommend leaving out the sugar entirely.

It sounded interesting but came out terrible. I used pom juice diluted with the 2.5 cups of water and the dish came out so watery I had to keep adding more and more juice. The taste still didn't improve much. On top of that, the chicken came out a little overcooked, having cooked it at the beginning, before adding the sauce. I would suggest cooking the chicken together with the sauce but I would not make this again.

I used the duck breast and chicken breast, the squash, and the recommended amount of liquid. Agree that 3 cups is probably right. My dish was not pink, but mushroom color. Not so pretty. Flavors were veryinteresting.

The complex flavor and pink color of this dish is really impressive and wonderful. The carrot seems out of place in the dish and everyone agreed we should leave it out next time. I would also add some potatoes, cubed, along with the chicken. I only needed 3 cups of pom juice and that was enough liquid. also threw in some mushrooms that I had on hand and they were great.

This is a very tasty dish. The sweet-tart flavor of the sauce is outstanding. I did make some modifications, however. I did not add any sugar as we felt that the cooked down juice would add enough sweetness; I used bone-in chicken thighs; I did not include carrots. I cooked this in a slow-cooker, but the sauce did not cook down much, so I ended up ladling out the sauce and cooking it down on the stovetop before serving.

This is incredibly flavourful and delicious. Not too pretty to look at though as it resembles a stew!

The key is there are two types of pomegranate molasses (aka pomegranate syrup, pomegranate paste) out there: sour and sweet. Look carefully at the ingredients--it's easy to tell which is which if you have two different ones. If you have the sugary kind, don't add any sugar (unless you like it supersweet). If you have the sour kind, you will probably want some sugar. Just add to taste. The other thing is that my Persian friend swears the walnuts need to cook for at least 4 hours, until they turn darker brown. If you go this route (it's really not too bad, just pick a day when you're around the house anyhow), start with only walnuts and water, simmer until the water is reduced and the walnuts are getting thick, then add more water. Repeat until the walnut mixture darkens....3-4 hrs. Then add the rest of the seasonings etc. It's delicious.

The dish is actually very good. However, this recipe differs a bit from tradition. Generally, only pomegranate molasses is used, and no sugar is added. For those who like it more sour (my friend), add lemon juice. I prefer it on the sweet side and sometimes add sugar. Also, I've never had it with carrot or squash, and I suspect most Iranians never have either. Generally, nothing is added but chicken and onion. The consistency should be much thicker than heavy cream...I think the recipe needs more walnuts. Try it again...it is good...really!

This dish looked really interesting but the sauce was too sweet. I used half of the sugar and still found it too sweet.

I think I must not have understood what Khoresh was--I was expecting a very tangy flavor--like that of muhammara, and used the POM pomegranate juice. I ended up with a very sweet dish, though the chicken was okay, the sauce was so sweet as to be inedible. If I were to make it again, I wouldn't add the sugar, and might try pomegranate molasses to balance things out.

Simply wonderful. Pretty easy to make considering the payoff. I surprised my wife with this recipe, and she was floored. Our favorite Persian restaurant calls this dish Fessenjun. I used squash, and it soaked up the flavor very well. We will definitely be making this dish again soon.

Add the carrots! They pick up the tangy, pomegranate flavor and are wonderful in the dish. My husband and I loved this sauce but will try cooking the duck breast whole next time, slicing it thin, then pouring the sauce over it. We just like our duck better that way.

Very delicous! I used coarsly chopped walnuts instead and ommited carrots. The sauce came slightly thinner but was more textured and the taste of cooked walnuts complemented very well the chicken and pomegranate. I will definitely make this again.

I followed the advice of the Vancouver cook, eliminating the squash and carrots from the recipe, and used duck rather than chicken. (I cooked squash, etc., as a side dish.) The pomegranate khoresh was extremely well received by our guests, even by my husband, who is not a real duck lover. This was a great dish!

Having a Persian background I have eaten this dish many times but never prepared it myself -- until now. I omitted the carrots/squash as they seemed a strange addition to me. I followed the recipe exactly & it came out pretty close to my mother's. I did increase the pomegranate and sugar slightly at the end. The secret seems to be a nice long slow simmer. It was relatively easy to prepare and was a big hit. Thank you!
