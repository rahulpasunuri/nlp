Definitely would make this again! You just need to have pepitas at home, easy to find at Trader Joes.

It was good, but nothing to write home about. We couldn't find shelled pumpkin seeds, so the hour task of peeling pumpkin seeds (which isn't easy by the way), made the recipe just ok. Really, if the recipe turned out to be amazing, my review would be different; but it wasn't .

Spectacular. I substituted pinion nuts for pepitas and padrone peppers for jalepenos. I grilled the halibut and onion on an open grill. Wonderful - I'll make it again.

I don't know if I would classify this under the "quick and easy" category. I thought it was, but my husband who is truly a beginning cook (we're talking grilled cheese and spaghetti) had some difficulty with the directions on this. Despite some hurdles it turned out really yummy. I substituted one large sweet white onion which was plenty for us. I used fresh wild-caught Halibut which would have been amazing without anything on it.

This is a great recipe. The Jalapeno added a nice kick, and who doesn't love butter? I wasn't sure from the recipe if I was suppose to grill the halibut or cook it in a rimmed baking dish on the grill. I did it in the dish, covered with aluminum foil. It turned out lovely!

Awesome! I had to make some changes...store didn't have halibut so I used red snapper. Also had to bake inside, but turned out great! Loved it.

This is so good! Halibut is a perfect foil for this butter. The butter isn't as spicy or hot as you would think. The onions were great; grilling them mellows them. Will definitely make again!

Super yummy. Turned out perfect, even from a novice.

The butter was fantastic, I bet it would be good on anything, but it was fabulous with the halibut.

It was pretty darn good. Not hard to do. Very tasty. I will make it again.

The halibut was very tasty. It can stand on its own without the grilled onions, unless you're a huge onion fan.
