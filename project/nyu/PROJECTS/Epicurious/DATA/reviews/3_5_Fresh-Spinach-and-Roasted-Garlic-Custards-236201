Love, Love, Love the taste of this! I didn't have ramekins so I made it in a casserole. My concern was the separation. In the casserole, the separation was fairly pronounced. A smaller container would alleviate that a bit. I also think I overcooked it a bit, but scooped it out, mixed up the layers a bit and YUM!!! Tomorrow, I buy ramekins!

I have made this dish many times and we loved it every single time! I substituted 2% milk for the heavy cream and doubled the spinach. The taste was perfect and the dish healthier!

I also doubled the spinach and only used 1/4 tsp. of salt. It was divine! I made the full recipe--used 3 cups the first night and reheated the rest the next day. It was perfect. This recipe is so easy.

I have made this dish three times for dinner parties. It was wonderful. Not mediocre at all in my opinion. I used half the salt and next time I will increase the spinach.

We prepared this with the tenderloin and mushrooms of the same issue and it was a great dinner. The friend who made the custards doubled the garlic and added 50% more spinach than the recipe called for. All 10 dinner guests loved the dish.

This dish is so mediocre, and SO unhealthy!! It should not be categorized as a healthy recipe.

Since I couldn't get fresh spinach, I tried Arugula. Liked the flavor, hated the texture.

This made a beautiful presentation...and I made it with the Spinach. It was delicious. One thing I noticed is it seemed a little salty, so next time I would cut back the salt, add just a 1/4 tsp perhaps.

I also had a problem because of the spinach scare. Even though it was to be cooked, I couldn't find any fresh spinach, so I used frozen and drained it really well. It came out just fine.

Very good and nice presentation. However, I must admit to having substituted one of the main ingredients in this dish. Due to the recent e coli spinach scare, I used broccoli in place of the spinach. I steamed the broccoli, finely chopped it, then added to the blender. Paired with Beef Tenderloin Steaks with Mustard Cognac Sauce also from this website.
