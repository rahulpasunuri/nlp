This cake is so easy and it tastes like it took days. It does but it's not work but the waiting that takes time. It's perfect for a summer treat with friends.

I first made this cake back in 1979 and I have been looking for this recipe ever since. I'm so glad I have found it again as it was a big hit with family and friends. Although a little picky to make it is well worth the effort and is a great do ahead recipe.

Loved this dessert and thought it was easy as it is a make-ahead. Everyone raved, I will definately make it over and over.

__I made this cake when it first came out in Bon Appetit in 1979. So glad I re-found the recipe for it is a winner. I believe it was called Frozen lemon mirror cake? and the very top layer was the clear lemon curd and was spectacular looking. It's time consuming but not difficult and truly delicious. Kept a long time in freezer as had some left and was not any problem keeping it. I'd give this 5 forks if I could and will be making it for this weekend. It's absolutely delicious! YUMMY!!!

I loved the idea of this cake and the other reviews sounded great, however, it was quite a lot of work. I had to make the meringue layers twice as the first time I let them sit too long in the oven while cooling and could not get them off the parchment paper (although my husband loved eating my mistake.) But worse, when I pulled the assembled cake out of the freezer my guests we were all disappointed to find the meringue got soggy and almost started dissolving into the ice cream. Unfortunate as all the layers tasted great by themselves. Next time Id serve the vanilla ice cream with lemon curd together with a meringue cookie for a garnish.

This is an amazing recipe. The crunchy, nutty crust is wonderful with the creamy lemon curd, ice cream, and meringue. Make sure you get the best quality vanilla ice cream you can. Although it took several stages to make the cake, it was well worth it. Everyone loved it.

Delicious! The lemon curd is great. This is a definite treat, however. (it's kind of high fat.) It was nice spending a relaxing day making this cake. Definitely have to plan ahead. My cake only had about 3 hours to freeze, and as soon as I brought it out, it began to melt and lost its nice shape. This is a major crowd pleaser, though. It's worth the effort!

I haven't made this recipe yet but I'm looking forward to. I'm gluten intolerant and don't find many recipes without flour. Thanks.....

this was a wonderful and easy recipe. My one issue is that you have to serve it in individual slices and can't bring the whole cake to the table. As a whole cake it is not very attractive.

I made this dessert for New Year's Eve and everyone decided it was their all-time favorite! I made one change because the top meringue piece cracked when I put it into the springform pan and it didn't look very good. I put one more layer of lemon curd (make 1 1/2 recipe of the lemon curd) and topped it off with 1/2 pt. real whipped cream. I garnished it with a little lemon zest and a couple of twisted lemon slices. Looked gorgeous and tasted sumptuous. I will definitely make this for any special occasion.
