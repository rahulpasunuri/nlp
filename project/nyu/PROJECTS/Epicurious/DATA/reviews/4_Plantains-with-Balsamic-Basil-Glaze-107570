WOW! these were awesome! We were intrigued by the recipe so thought we would give it a try. The balsamic butter was plentiful and we found that not that much was needed (as it got a little messy on the grill) but we just lay the plantains on a bit of foil to contain them. definitely worth the effort, such an interesting way to have plantains. will for sure make it again.

Had eight plantains and no plan... Found this recipe and it was delicious! Per other reviews, I halved the sauce amount and still had some left over. Also, made it in the oven (on foil-covered sheet for 30 mins. at 400-degrees F). Delicious! Served it over jasmine rice. Will definitely make again.

Since we first tried this recipe, we have been making it for every event where we can reasonably figure it into the menu. It has been a hit with everyone except my 7yo nephew. Those who say the recipe makes too much butter sauce are correct. However, I have found that if cooled completely and sealed in vacuumed, air-tight container, the sauce can be kept in the fridge or freezer for future use. This morning I put two plantains (leftover from last night's meal) in the food processor along with a smidge of water, processed to a rough paste, formed into 6 small patties and fried in the slightest amount of butter (2 min on each side) - a nice addition to breakfast alongside the eggs and asparagus.

We weren't too sure how this would turn out but wanted to try a new way of cooking plantain as we usually just pan fry it. But we were blown away by the buttery, sweet, smoky flavor. We were worried about dripping so we placed them on a piece of foil but in the end the plantains absorbed most of the mixture. I think the recipe calls for way too much butter. I made half the recipe and halved the amount of butter again. Delicious!!

I didn't have a grill on hand and baked the plantains for 40 minutes at 350. It came out kinda mushy so next time I'll reduce the baking time. I think the recipe calls for too much of the butter spread, you could do fine with just half or a third of the amount.

Very Yummy!!!!!!My parents bought my boyfriend a grill for his birthday. For his first ever grilling experience, I prepared an ambitious all gourmet menu (of course). These were great, even prepared by novice griller! They took a long time to cook, so I finished them in the micro, no one could tell. For something truly devine, make a dipping sauce for the grilled plantains out of the marinade by heating it up and added extra butter. With this I served the best lamb chops! (from this site), but basically you don't need a recipe, just the rub lamb chops with red curry paste (in most grocery stores) and then grill. Enjoy!

I loved this recipe! I made it in the oven because I live in Panama and it was way to hot to turn on the BBQ. A Keeper!
