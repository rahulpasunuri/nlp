This was a fairly easy recipe, but I wasn't impressed with the result. Coarsely chopping the olive mixture meant that I should expect lots of stuff in my teeth when I was done with my meal. I think it would have been nicer to make it sort of like a sauce/pesto texture. I added braised tofu for my protein, which came out nice. But it wasn't a dish that was memorable.

I liked the flavors and it was a great way for me to add cauliflower to my diet (I'm not normally a big cauliflower fan), and my toddler liked the cauliflower as well. I found it to be too salty though--I'd try cooking the cauliflower without salt next time and see if that helps.

The marriage of all flavors are what makes this dish exceptional. NOTE: the recipe says to serve this immediately. There's a good reason for this instruction. Don't offer another glass of wine before and expect this dish to sit and then be perfect. It's meant to be eaten as soon as it is properly prepared All in all, a new vegetarian recipe in my repertoire.

I made this recipe exactly as written, no substitutions and we loved it. Served it to guests the second time, loved it again. The second time I accidentally stirred the almonds in at the end and it was fine. I'm always looking for a new way to use cauliflower and this is a keeper.

Yummy, but VERY rich. Would have been better served with a simple salad than alone.

Ok, I've revised my previous opinion. Forget the pasta, let it sit overnight, sprinkle the almonds on just before serving and have it as a 'salad'. It was really good!

Rating: 2
Weird combo, neither memorable nor awful. Used less oil than called for. This would be good for the vegetarian relatives or your 'no meat' night of the week but I wouldn't try and pass it off as special.

Weird combination of flavors. Filling vegetarian meal but not tasty enough to make again.

I make this exactly as written, except I use olives stuffed with garlic &/or jalapenos. This is one of our favorite recipes! we make this one often. Yummy!

I never feel confident in playing with recipes, but will use others' suggestions. When I got to this recipe, it looked so good. I only had frozen cauliflower and it looked sad. So I roasted it- per suggestion. Oops, out of olives, but found a jar of tamponade. Out of almonds. Decided to try it anyway. Used the white wine suggestion, and of course the garlic. We loved it. My husband didn't think the almonds were necessary. I look forward to having the actual ingredients next time!

I have made this recipe 3 times and really enjoy it. I skip the garlic cloves, but instead use green olives stuffed with garlic. Check for them in the olive bar at your local grocery store. The last time I used basil instead of parsley and it was delightful.

I really enjoyed this recipe as written. To elevate it to the next level, next time I will roast the cauliflower and add 50% more olives.

It was good, but definitely not more than a sum of its parts. The olives sort of overshadowed the cauliflower.

This was very tasty but I regret using a previous reviewer's suggestion to add sundried tomatoes-- their tartness clashed with the other flavors of the dish. When I make this again, I will not be adding these. Did cut oil to 1/8 cup and subbed white wine for the water. Used whole wheat linguine and orange cauliflower. Delicious, healthy meal.

Very tasty and easy to make. I followed the advice of some of the other reviews. I used 1/4 cup of oil. Still too much, I think. I'll try 1/8 next time. I subbed white wine for the water. I used jalepeno and garlic stuffed olives and omitted the garlic in the sautee. I will gladly make this dish again.

I really liked this. My boyfriend was skeptical but said it was good and passed on my offer to heat up some pasta sauce to put over it. The flavors are subtle and delicious.

Rating: 2
This was ok, but nothing special. (In fairness, my husband liked it better than I did). It's not good enough to serve to company, and not healthy enough (with a half cup of olive oil) for everyday. Besides, if I am going to blow the calories, I want something delicious.

This was a big hit with my family. A great way to get the cauliflower on the menu. I used orange cauliflower for added color and it seems to have a bit more flavor as well as more vitamins compared to white. I plan to try broccoflower as well.

This pasta dish is fantastic and indestructable! You can change it, overcook cauliflower, skimp on olives and it still tastes delicious. Also, it is easily converted to a vegan dish, just leave out the parmesan, no other alterations are needed.

this dish was very good. i used 1 pound of rotini instead of spaghetti so the sauce would coat the pasta better and adjusted the recipe accordingly. add more crushed red pepper if you like things spicy.

This stuff ROCKS!! I made it as written for a Friday during Lent. I can't wait to have it again. Oh, and it makes enough to feed about 8, not just 4!

This was terrific - I was sceptical at first, but forge ahead - you won't be sorry! I made a couple of modifications like adding 1/4-1/3 cup sundried tomatoes and instead of 1/4 cup of water I threw in the 1/2 cup of white wine I had leftover - fabulous - but eat it freshly made. If you're going to have leftovers, add some of the extra cooking water when you put it in the frig or it will get gummy. Also use a pasta that will provide good crevices for the sauce to get into. Serve with a dry red wine and a mesclun salad - yum!!

I made this last night and really did not care for it, threw out the (large amount of) leftovers and will not make it again. The flavors just did not work for me at all.

This was great! I used the bow tie pasta as well; it held the sauce well. The only thing I would change is I would use less olives, as it seemed a bit too salty for me. Other than that, it was a hit!

Rating: 4
YUMMY! Easy to prepare. I loved the surprising mix of flavors and textures. A nice alternative to more traditional pasta dishes. I did use bow tie pasta (fusilli would be good too) because it holds the sauce better. Used ~1/2C. unchopped capers. I think this adds a better flavor than green olives.

This dish is AMAZING. All my guests loved it & my sons ask me to make it constantly. Easy, spicy, complex . . . delicious. Only thing I changed was to drop olive oil to 1/3 cup.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. My husband hates spaghetti, and doesn't care for cauliflower so when he saw what I was making he groaned. He had seconds! I would recommend using at least double the olives and maybe putting the olive sauce on top rather than tossing it. They kind of get lost. I used jalepeno and garlic stuffed green olives...they were an excellent addition.

This is an exceptionally good recipe. I made it last week for a bunch of meat-eaters: they LOVED it. I am making it again tonight. I use whole wheat pasta and it is great. Enjoy!!

Satisfying and healthy, but more time-consuming than delicious. Great dish if all you have is cauliflower and a full pantry, would not go out of my way to make it.

Loved this recipe and so easy to make - we put chicken in as well and do a more generous portion of the green olives. Light and easy to reheat.

Well I thought it was very good. I don't understand the negative comments. Perhaps some folks used bad olives or rotten olive oil. It was quick, easy and totally satisfying. I make lots of vegetarian and vegan meals and try to spring them on self proclaimed carnivours, most never realize until I tell them that they just ate a meal without any dead animals in it :) By the by it was delicioso!

I'm generally not a huge fan of cauliflower, but with the fresh parsley and salty olives in this recipe I couldn't get enough of it! Delicious, quick, healthy. I will definitely be making this again in the near future.

This was really good and more satisfying (filling) than I expected--I don't usually eat pasta as a main course. My boyfriend (a dedicated omnivore) loved it too and snarfed down the leftovers within 24 hours.

Just reading the reviews after posing mine ..I hadn't thought of adding some garlic! I usualy do not review unless I have followed the recipe as printed . But garlic would be a wonderful addition!

Rating: 4
We really enjoyed this recipe. I think it might even be better with black olives. I'm going to give that a try. I had some wonderful French Provincal olives with aromatic herbs and that may have made ir more flavorful than plain grocery olives. An added benefit was, what a great way to cook cauliflower , just as a veg. I usually roast mine with olive oil and herbs, but in summer , in FL , that really is not appealing! I do not like using the oven too often. But the frying in oil with a few herbs makes cauliflower a summer treat here now!

I had high expectations based on the other reviews, and this dish completely let me down. It was really bland and I had to add loads of extra parmesan to make it remotely edible....I followed the recipe exactly so if I made it again (which I probably won't), I would add more olives or some other vegetables to give it some more flavor.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful and interesting combination of ingredients. Reminds me of a dish my Sicilian grandmother would have made. I found it quick and easy to make and tastes even better when reheated. The last time I made it, I used some rendered bacon fat leftover from breakfast to replace some of the olive oil and it added another great layer of flavor.

This was good. More work than I anticipated for a Friday evening after coming home from work - but definitely tasty.

We loved this recipe! Since I'm just cooking for two people, I went ahead and made the whole recipe, just put half in the freezer for next time. Easy to make ahead and while you cook the pasta. I also halved the oil with no detrimental circumstances. It's amazing to me how the almonds, olives, and cauliflower (with just a hint of spice) go so well together. It reminded me a bit of a spaghetti with anchovies. This would go well with whole wheat pasta, too. One of my new favorites!

This was wonderful, even my 6-year-old niece gobbled it up. I couldn't find brine-cured olives so used regular store-brand olives and it came out delicious. This is definitely a keeper.

This was sublime! If you are worried about the olive taste being overwhelming, it wasn't. The toasted almonds added a touch of sweetness for balance, and the earthiness of the cauliflower and cheese pulled it all together. The pepper flakes lifted the flavors to the nose. I mixed pitted kalamata and green olives, and used capellini pasta (thinner) to be certain that the flavors would come out. Topped with more fresh chopped parsley. My vegetarian guest loved it!

Rating: 4
I made this dish twice in one week - I loved it that much. The toasted almonds and red pepper flakes are the standout flavors in what still manages to be a subtly delicious meal. Since my spaghetti turned out much greener than the photo, I call this pasta dish a parsley pesto. I only wish I could figure out how to taste the olive more (fancier olives?).

I mad this in 2 parts. The cauliflower, parsley, and olives yesterday and this afternoon I made the pasta (bow ties not spaghetti). It is great. I took the advice of cook from Washington and roasted the cauliflower with chunks of garlic, sauteed the other ingredients, combined them and served with hot pasta; I have nothing left to nosh on. Next time I may add fresh peas.

this is simply delicious! its a little dry but next time i'll add some chicken broth (or veggie). if you have a decent pantry, the only thing you need to get is cauliflower. i roasted w/chunks of garlic instead of sauteeing. so good - you must try it. went nicely with the chianti we had...couldn't tell you what it was but, yum..............

Since we don't love olives in our household, I ommitted them, but it still didn't lack in flavor. It was a wonderful dish for a cold day. We had small portions as a side dish next to pork chops. Delish!

Big hit w/my picky eaters. Roasted cauliflower, sprayed w/olive oil, @425 for 10 mins; sauteed garlic/red pepper in 1/4 c oil (maybe less?), added green olive mix to that and tossed it all together in big bowl. Not everyone was enthusiastic about the almonds, so served them on the side. Great one dish meal.

Rating: 4
Great dish -- loved by two young picky eaters and adults. Next time I would roast the cauliflower (See Roasted Cauliflower with Garlic on this site)at 425 for 25-30 minutes and would add the garlic others mentioned. Roasting gives the same great flavor with less oil and effort.

Delicious! Quite amazing how good it tasted. We felt afterwards that it may have been a bit salty, so will not add any salt to the cauliflower next time. With the olives and parmesan, there's plenty of flavor.

This was a great dish, even though it sounds a little strange. I used many fewer olives than called for, because the amount called for seemed insane, especially if you want to limit sodium intake. I used a scant half cup and it was fine, still very savory and flavorful. My husband loved it. It would make a great first course or an easy dinner on it's own.

Rating: 4
This dish was excellent. I almost didn't make it because my husband said it sounded weird, but I'm glad I did because we both loved it. Neither of us like green olives by themselves, but they worked well in this dish. It was very simple to prepare, so I will definitely make it again, maybe to serve to company next time!

Followed recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic. Very flavorful dish for not having meat/fish. Added more oil mainly because I had more cauliflower, and perhaps that's why my dish was just right and didn't need add'l water. Great for vegetarians/vegans and a lovely alternative the usual pasta with red sauce.

Best meal all year!! My very picky eater, son...cant believe i cooked this myself.
