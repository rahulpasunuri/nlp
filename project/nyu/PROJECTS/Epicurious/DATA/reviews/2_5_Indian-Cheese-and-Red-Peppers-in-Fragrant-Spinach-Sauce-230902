Good stuff. Made with Tofu.

this was so delicious. i made a lot of modifications because of what was available in my kitchen, but the result was fantastic deliciousness. i blended the spinach with sour cream since i didn't have milk or tofu. i only had a red pepper so i skipped the chili and green peppers and used cayenne pepper instead. i used 2/3 a jar of trader joe's masala sauce. i also roasted garbanzo beans with sliced onion and 5 garlic cloves (which i dusted with curry powder) and added them to the simmering spinach. i let the dish simmer much longer than suggested to allow the flavor to develop. would definitely make this again and again!

This was okay - not the best I've had. Would make it again but there is no need to lay out the pieces of paneer if you're using store-bought and when pureeing the spinach and green pepper some liquid will be required for a smooth consistency. Recipe as written comes across a bit more complicated than necessary.

I was very pleased with this recipe. I am new to Indian cooking. About a year ago my husband took me to India palace and ordered the Lamb Saag for me. It was love at first bite. This didn't taste exactly like their saag but from what I understand Curry and Garam Marsala recipes vary so there is no real way to no and I doubt they're going to give it up. I used 2 teaspoons of Trader Joe's Curry then added a dash more ground cloves and cinnamon and a sprinkle of sugar. I also cooked it with chicken instead of making the paneer (which I'll be trying next time) so I think that effected the flavor a good bit. I think lamb would probably absorb the flavor better because it's not as dense as chicken. I added about a TBS of heavy cream but I think that's about all the changes I made. I would also suggest doubling it up if you have men eating unless you pair it with naan and something else. This recipe only fed 3 people instead of 6 but we only had basmati rice with it. I also did not add any of the red peppers. Anyway, my husband and I loved it! We will definitely be eating this often. I recommend it!

All due respect to other reviewers, those who were complaining that it's not palak paneer or saag paneer, the recipe isn't claiming to be. Also, it's very annoying when people change the recipe drastically and then complain that it didn't produce the results they wanted. The dish uses Indian spices, so it's probably fairly authentic. I thought the flavor was good, probably needs a little salt; you can't go into a recipe with expectations that it will be like something else you've tried. That's unreasonable.

Im indian and this recepie is nowhere close to the authentic recepie which origitaes in Punjaab , North India . For example we dont use any green or red pepper with spinach , just add cut ginger ,few cloves of garlic,one small onion ,one tomatoe,one chillie in a blender along with blanched spinach.Heat oil,add turmeric,little garam masala and add the puree .. finish it by adding the panfriend paneer and some cream and finish with salt . This is faster and tasteir .

The best recipe for palak paneer I've found is on the Manjulaskitchen.com web site. I've made paneer but have had no luck frying it and I don't believe the recipe needs it. We also found great tofu at a local Vietnamese store where it is made fresh every day. I just pat it dry, cut it appropriately, and then fry it in very very little oil in a teflon pan. I have a couple of Julie Sahni's cookbooks and have found them to be excellent.

HELP! Is it just me or is it really not possible to make paneer with ULTRA pasteurized milk? I used to make it all the time, but I tried TWICE with whole milk and ended up with about 2 tablespoons of solids out of an entire gallon of whole milk. The only thing I could figure out is that the milk was ultra pasteurized instead of pasteurized. Am I nuts here? I mean, paneer is super easy to make - I KNOW it is! Help! I want the paneer - I don't want tofu - but living in a very small town in the middle of somewhere it's impossible to find ANY Indian food or ingredients, I'm not going to get it unless I make it myself...

Wow, I don't know what some folks did, but I feel sure they made a mistake. I have used this as one of my hallmark recipes for years-- the kind I no longer order at a restaurant because it's much better made at home. One restaurant I frequented years ago formed the basis for my saag cravings, and this recipe nails it. I've never tried this without making the cheese myself-- it's extremely simple, and its mildness is key to bringing together the flavors of the recipe, since they are subtle and must meld together just right. Be sure to use kosher salt-- regular salt will, indeed, make it terribly salty. And last, I don't know how you properly crush ginger, I would grate it for sure, or it won't incorporate.

After reading the reviews, I didn't use any bell peppers, couldn't find ginger. I used fresh cheese and maybe a little extra garam masala. I think the garam masala is what can make or break this dish. I have a really good one that was given to me. I cooked the spinach with butter and garlic, the flavor comes through well. My one complaint is way too much salt! I added a teaspoon and it's crazy. Add little by little.

I was expecting the Indian dish Palak Paneer. This is nothing like anything I've ever had at any Indian restaurant. It was very smooth but had no real flavor.

Rating: 1
I have never done so much to make something that tasted so unimpressively mediocre. I love Saag Paneer and this dish tastes nothing like it. The bell pepper and the ginger do not make interesting or tasty additions to this dish. Even as a basis for a dish, this recipe is a total loss. I just made it since I had some tofu, spinach and peppers, I wish I had read the reviews first.

I love Indian food but this recipe was bland and unsatisfying. My husband and I forced ourselves to eat it because it was healthy, but that was the only redeeming quality of the dish. I agree with others that it could be a starting point, but only if you know what to add (I don't obviously). I substituted the paneer cheese with tofu. Perhaps the cheese would add something to the dish. I don't recommend this recipe; I would not make it again.

I agree with the previous reviewer that this is not bad but can be used as the basis for forming your own recipe. I used 1 lb. of frozen chopped spinach because it was cheaper than fresh (on sale), omitted the bell peppers in the recipe for authenticity, and didn't have enough ginger, but I still felt it was missing a thing or two. I think next time, after I've tried other recipes, if I use this one again, I'll add some garlic. I added some ghee (clarified butter) this time for that buttery flavor I'm accustomed to with saag paneer in restaurants, but it still wasn't the same. FYI, I got my paneer from Trader Joe's.

If I make this again I will leave out the green pepper, and use only one small minced green chile. I used two serranos and it was way too hot - and I usually like things spicy. I didn't bother to fry the paneer, which I did make fresh. This wasn't like Sag Paneer I've had in Indian restaurants - but I may use the recipe as a jumping off point.

Very different taste, ginger and turmeric (cúrcuma or palillo in Spanish, in case anyone is interested) made spinach acceptable for the younger ones; easy to make. Beautiful color, will look good for office Xmas gathering, when I plan to repeat this recipe.

The spicing is a bit off. There was twice as much ginger than needed, and it was crying for a bit of garlic. The red bell pepper was a strange addition to this simple, traditional dish. I think it was a waste of time to "fry" the farmer's cheese because it melts already when you add it to hot spinach mixture. I was pleased with the beautiful green of the fresh spinach, but the dish was NOT delicious and not worth all the fuss.

This is the first saag paneer recipe I have made that has actually tasted right! I'm psyched! Substituting tofu worked well and I also left out the red pepper strips. I was amazed that the first reviewer said this took 2 hours! It was a really fast recipe, especially with the tofu substitution. Maybe thirty minutes from start to finish.

I happen to LOVE Indian food (maybe I was Indian in a former life ;-)!) and I've been cooking since I was 12, so I had no problems with this recipe. If the previous reviewer had read the instructions carefully, s/he would have noticed that the amount of farmer cheese called for as a substitute for the paneer is *8 oz*. That is also the maount of tofu I would have used. Also, the instructions for the red pepper seemed pretty obvious to me, but I prefer the taste of the dish without them, even if it is prettier, so I just left them out. I especially liked the instructions for making paneer, as our small local Indian grocer doesn't carry it. The taste is very close to the Saag Paneer I fell in love with as a college student, so I'm glad to be able to make it myself.

This is probably an outstanding dish, but I'll never know. The instructions are so vague and inexact that only someone who already knows how to cook thi sdish could make it. "1 inch strips of raw red pepper cooked for 2 minutes" -- What? "small cubes" how small is "small"? "2 cakes of tofu"? That's nearly 2 lbs of tofu! Give me break. This recipe wasted 2 hours of my life.
