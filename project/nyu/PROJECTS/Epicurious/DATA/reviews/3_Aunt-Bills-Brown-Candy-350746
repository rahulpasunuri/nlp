I have a newspaper clipping of this recipe from my grandmother, she made these every year growing up. My recipe is a little different and I thought it might help some who are having problems- I have made this at high altitude and in the South without changes or problems. mine calls for cream or whole milk. I've never used cream, whole milk works perfectly here. No water. 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1/4 c butter. This is the "half" recipe. I cook it in a cast iron skillet. My recipe says 238 degrees (firm ball when dropped in cool water). If it's powdery I would guess it didn't get hot enough and if it's really hard before you get the vanilla or nuts in, you got it too hot. Hope that helps! It really is a delicious treat!

Molly, if you're reading this, or anyone else that knows, HELP. The candy is cooling but I have no confidence it will come out of the pan to get cut into pieces. I followed the recipe EXACTLY, but when I went to stir, even before adding the pecans, it was almost a powder rather than a fudge. It tastes wonderful, but I think we're going to have to eat it with a spoon. What did I do wrong?

I live at a high altitude and find that the ball stage method is more reliable for me. Can anyone tell me what 244 translates to? Firm?

This candy is amazing- I had never tasted anything quite like it. Temperature is important for the right result- just follow the directions. Fun to make with a partner.

Fabulous. I gave it to friends as a holiday treat and within minutes of trying it, they called to ask for the recipe. I had none of the issues mentioned by other reviewers. I'm glad I didn't read the reviews ahead of time - if I had, I probably would never have had these yummy treats...

As others have said, this is essentially fudge. If you are seeking caramel like flavor you'll be better off making different kind of candy. I too used only 2 cups of pecan and heavy cream instead of half and half. And I didn't cooked the mixture up to 244 degrees as I was afraid of the candy becoming rock hard. In terms of color and texture it came out fine. I used a hand held mixer to do the stirring since I had no interest in hard physical labor. I bought gold candy cups just like the ones in the picture and cut the candy into 64 squares. Initially I planned on cutting it into 36 squares but that would have yielded pieces too big for the little cups.

Other reviewers were absolutely right: 2 cups of pecans is more tan enough, this recipe needs salt, and you get good results if you use heavy cream instead of 1/2 & 1/2. This is essentially pecan fudge, but seemed a lot more tedious to make than Epicurious' Brown Sugar Fudge (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Brown-Sugar-Fudge-108365) which has the same consistency. I reduced the sugar in the cream mixture to 1.5 cups, and the candy was still very sweet.

I was so excited to try these; I love pecans and caramel. Followed the directions to a tee and the candy turned rock-hard! I had planned to give these away to friends the following day but after spending so much time in the kitchen on these was too tired to make anything else. What a waste of time and pecans! I want to try again but I cannot see how they will turn out any differently the next time.

This recipe turned out well. You need to eyeball the amount of nuts in it and ensure that there's more goo than nuts or else it won't stick well. It's time intensive and requires a lot of attention but the end results are delicious. I dipped some of the candy into bittersweet chocolate for a variation. Delicious!

I had all of the ingredients, had all sorts of worries about making it, however I was alone and snowed in...it turned out perfectly. It requires a lot of attention with brushing down the sides of the pan and watching the temperature (I verified the softball stage in cold water as well as the candy thermomete). It took 10 minutes to beat and I used 2/3 of the pecans called for. Mostly I was inspired by the description of Aunt Bill in the article and thought about how much I loved the people I was making this for...perhaps that helped!

I spent the afternoon trying and failing at this recipe -- more research revealed that at higher altitudes candy temperatures should be lowered: "To prevent excessive water evaporation, cook the syrup to a final temperature lower than that given for sea level. Decrease the final cooking temperature by the difference in boiling water temperature at your altitude and that of sea level. This is an approximate decrease of 2 degrees for every increase of 1,000 feet in elevation." Argh. Wasted afternoon. Will probably try again sometime, after this afternoon fades a bit in my memory.

There were way too many nuts! My candy came out so crumbly- as if there wasn't nearly enough caramel to bind all of the nuts together. IF I make this again, I'd reduce the nuts by half.

I loved this. I'm not an experienced candy maker, but the directions were easy to follow. Tastes delicious. I might use a few less pecans next time so there is a higher caramel-to-pecan ratio.

Yummiest candy! It reminded folks of candy they enjoyed in their childhoods. I add salt for the salty/sweet effect and use only 1.5 cups of pecans or walnuts.

This is the first time I'm taking the time to rate a recipe...This candy is great! I've made chocolate fudge hundreds of times, and now I have a new favorite! Be sure to toast the pecans, and I had my teenage son help with the last bit of stirring..I didn't wait till it was very dull,(so it wasn't "crumbly") but after scraping into buttered pan, I cut it into squares before it got too solid. Wonderful,chewy,crunchy, melt in the mouth stuff!

This recipe is an Oklahoma classic! I remember my mom's stories of watching her mother and her Aunt Ruth making it in their kitchen in Fletcher, OK! It is very sensitive: you must cook the candy long enough, not too long. It is better to use the old "cold water" method of checking the temperature than trusting a candy thermometer. Likewise, you need to beat the candy about three minutes longer than it seems like you should: until the warm, but cooling, candy is truly dull in finish. When it works properly, it can't be beat! Don't give up! Be patient! You're in for a treat!

Can anyone help me? I followed the recipe exactly, but it came out soft! Too soft, in fact to cut. I used a cookie baller and pulled out pieces. I'm trying to harden them in the freezer, but they are still too sticky and soft to pick up. The flavor is delicious, so I'd love to be able to save them. All advice welcomed.

Terrific recipe, Molly! I've mailed out half the batch to friends and family and now my co-workers are raving about them in the office. Honestly, my phone just rang with someone moaning how good they are. They turned out pretty crumbly and it was hard to get a perfect square cut without them crumbling, but the taste is phenomenal!

I followed the recipe exactly and brought the mixture to precisely 244 degrees, and yet it turned out rock hard. We couldn't get all 4 cups of the pecans incorporated before it was too stiff to stir and then had to pound it into the baking dish with a rolling pin. Instead of cutting into neat squares, we basically had to hack at it with a huge knife to break chunks off. It is edible and the flavor is okay, but I can't give it to anyone because it is just way too hard. I had such high hopes for Molly's recipe, but I don't think I will try it again. Oh well.

Surprised this got 4 forks given the reviews. ??? I was going to try it but have decided against it based on the experience of others.

This is a terrible recipe. I made it twice and both times it did not come out. The first time it came out like caramel and the 2nd time I thought if I cooked it a little longer it might turn out. Well it did not. It was hard as a rock and I had to throw it out! What a waste and pecans are not cheap. I do not recommend this at all. I make a lot of candy this time of year and this was one of the worst ones I have ever tried to make! Save your money. Try something else.

A bit of history - I have this recipe from my Mother. During War world II, this was a popular candy to send to troops in Europe. It shipped well & stayed fresh for quite some time.

I made this candy because it sounded so much like a "chewey praline" that my husband brought me from Austin. I didn't stir mine until it was quite set, and the result was a stickier, chewier candy, quite like the "chewey praline" I was hoping to duplicate. This is yummy stuff!

Well, something went wrong. My efforts resulted in a candy that was so hard I had to throw it out. But even tasting it along the way, the flavor wasn't what I was expecting. Yet the caramel was a deep amber and each step seemed to be working as the recipe indicated it should. It sounds like others had a better outcome, but even with that to go by, I don't think I'll try this again.

Very good! I did make two changes to the recipe though. I was hoping for a more fudge-like and less crumbly texture so I used heavy cream to replace the half & half and that worked very well. Also I noticed that the recipe has no salt. I love salted caramel so I added about 3/4 tsp total of kosher salt to the mixture while stirring and cooking to 244. I stirred in some salt and then dropped a bit of the mixture into a cold cup of water pulled it out to taste and continued to add salt and taste until I felt I had the right level of salt in the recipe

I made this candy for the holidays and everybody loved it. I used heavy cream instead of 1/2 %1/2 because that was all I had--no separation problems. I also found that 2 cups of pecans worked just fine. Cooking the sugar both in the cream and the water until it really dissolves may be the secret to good texture--this took a long, slow cook with lots of checking but really seemed to work.

Delicious! I have made 2 batches since getting the magazine and everyone loves it.

I have to agree with Susan- I felt that it was a waste of 4 cups of pecans. Perhaps I didn't let the sugar get dark enough too. The result yielded a terribly sweet, crumbly disaster.

susankatz, I'm so sorry that this didn't work out for you! Here are a couple of thoughts: 1. The sugar syrup does indeed need to be a nice, deep shade of amber. It's hard to find something to compare it to, color-wise, but it should be quite deep, quite caramelized. Like you, I once didn't get mine dark enough, and the resulting candy was too sweet. Definitely try again, and let your sugar reach a slightly darker shade of amber. (It shouldn't be allowed to burn or smoke, though; be careful of that.) 2. I usually keep my half-and-half mixture warm, over low heat, as you are suggesting. So yes, I say go for it. (The recipe as printed here is a combination of my recipe and the test kitchen's thoughts, which why it says something a little different.)

I was so looking forward to making this recipe. I also agree to keep the 1/2 and 1/2 mixture warm so it does not seperate. I cooked the sugar and water to amber, but I guess it did not get dark enough, mine turned out to be a sugary light brown misture and I feel like I wasted 4 cups of pecans! I will try this again since it does come out from the other reviews. Any ideas as to how deep the amber or even a temperature?

WOW! Made it for a Gourmet dinner club and everyone raved. Deliciously crumbly, not too sweet and a nice nutty texture.

Amazingly good! Crumbly and rich but not as overwhelmingly rich like fudge, with the pecans serving as a way to break through the intensity of the caramel. It doesn't require as much stirring as I feared. I recommend keeping the cream-sugar mixture warm (but not bubbling) while you deal with the sugar-water mixture, or else the solution will separate. Tip: to clean your pot at the end, boil water in it and the leftover caramel will dissolve.
