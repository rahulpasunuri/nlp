Was SUPER last night. Didn't have any fresh dill, so used dill seed (kind of crushed???). Subbed 2 Tbs. O/M Turkey Bacon Bits (added it at the end of cooking the onion/caraway/sauerkraut), instead of frying 1 slice of bacon at the beginning. Hubby declared this the BEST sauerkraut he's ever tasted. Yummy dish--served with plain sticky white rice.

Based on the other reviews, I was excited about making this. I was very disappointed with the results. Won't make this again.

The saukerkraut was good, but a bit too sweet for us. The instructions for sauteing the pork chops were perfect - 5 minutes per side in oil produced the best chops we've had in ages.

I grew up with sauerkraut and pork chops. However, mom never added apples (we always had applesauce on the side) so I'm use to a tangy version which includes the sauerkraut juice as well. Both versions are great!

Fast, easy and tasty recipe. Have to wonder about the concept of going to a restaurant for a "quick" meal. Served with steamed broccoli. Used 1 cup applesauce instead of apple juice. Borrowed a piece of bacon from our neighbor. Beginning to end about 20 minutes. No drive, no waiter and no waiting to pay the bill and return home. Too easy.

Yummy as is. Add some brown sugar and cider vinegar to add sweet and sour kick.

I was pleasantly surprised, such an easy recipe but it came out really well. Made per the recipe, next time I might add a bit more bacon and some apples as suggested. The chops were very moist and juicy and the kraut came out perfect. Will make again.

A great use of the homemade sauerkraut my nephew gave us all for xmas. Used two chopped macintoshes instead of apple juice. Didn't use any caraway or dill. May try with dill next time. Caraway might be in the form of some good fresh rye bread.

Yum. Used apple cider instead of juice, and regular bone-in chops instead of loin. Also diced an apple to throw in with the onions. After sauteing the chops put them in with the kraut and simmered for almost an hour. So moist and flavorful. Grew up hating kraut-I sure missed out on a lot!

I used freshly squeezed apple juice and the result was marvelous! The dill at the end is not really necessary. It works well without it.

Sometimes there are too many reviews with different opinions and changes. I picked a few for our dinner. Cut the caraway to 1/2 teaspoon, added a small sliced Granny Smith, added some apple juice to the chop pan (making a mess all over the stove) and then placing the sauerkraut in an ovenproof serving dish with the chops atop, covered with foil and put in a slow oven for about 15 minutes. Served with boiled new potatoes for a yummy meal.

So good! Easy, too. I left out the seasonings, but made roasted potatoes with dill to serve on the side. The sauerkraut had the best flavor! I browned the pork chops in a separate skillet, then put them on top of the sauerkraut for about 15 minutes to cook through. That way, they picked up the flavor of the saurkraut, onions and bacon. Mmmmm....will be making this again soon, maybe with sausages.

Add this one to your regular routine! I omitted the carroway seeds and dill, didn't have them on hand, used 2 slices of bacon and red onions with 1/2 c. sweet apple cider. WOW! My boyfriend devoured it, as did I. This kraut recipe is definately the best I've had and will make it again and again.

This was delicious, and i'm not a sauerkraut fan. i can't wait for leftovers, and i've already had them once already. the pork chops turned out moist and juicy. Draining the sauerkraut really toned down the sour-ness. i didn't have apple juice, so i used 1/2 apple cider vinegar and 1/2 chicken broth. i used olive oil to saute the onions (not bacon) to cut down on fat. i wished i'd had apples, but it was still great without them. i also didn't have caraway seeds, and i used dried dill. like others, i browned the chops first, and then removed them and carried on from there, covering the chops with the onion/sauerkraut saute and finishing in the oven for 15-20 minutes. i also used very thin assorted pork chops which were on sale. the flavors are terrific. i reccommend using the apples if you have them. i think it would be even better.

Okay, but not a keeper.

Didn't rate it because I ended up changing too much....Used wine saurkraut without rinsing,1/2 to full pound bacon,2 lg onions almost caramelized.no caraway or apple juice and dried dill. Browned spiced up chops on grill and then buried them in the mixture (I threw the 'kraut mixture in the oven to start at 350 while I readied the chops) once everything was assembled I baked it for close to an hour (adjusting temp as needed) served over garlic mashed potatoes. Been making it every month for over a year and the family still loves it.

I omitted the caraway seeds and dill, because I didn't have any, and it was still delicious. Next time I will use more thinly sliced pork chops, just as a matter of preference. I simmered the pork chops w/ the mixture for a few minutes at the end. Delicious!

Delicious! Omitted dill and caraway and had no apple juice so used the drained sauerkraut liquid to moisten, also deglazed the pork skillet w/chick broth. Added apple as suggested here and sprinkle of brown sugar to onions. Simmered the pork w/kraut covered for a few minutes to finish. Yummy change from the "plain" pork and sauerkraut I grew up on (another PA Dutch girl)!

Very nice sauerkraut dish. Went light on the caraway seeds and, as others suggested, put the sauerkraut and pork in the oven for a while which made both taste that much more savory.

Nothing special??? This is a great sauerkraut recipe!!! As recommended I omitted the dill and my chops were very thick so I boiled them in apple juice for about 8 minutes and after simmering baked in cast iron pot for about 10 minutes at the end of simmering time. The sauerkraut really soaks the apple and removes the tart and caraway and bacon really flavor this complete dish!! Loved it and such a great German recipe!!

Excellent sauerkraut recipe, however, I will omit the caraway seeds the next time, because they overpowered the dish-It tasted like rye sauerkraut. I did add apples with the onions which I would also recommend. Also, I browned the chops and added them back in the pan with the other ingredients, added some more applejuice and baked in the oven, it was wonderful.

Best kraut I ever had (& I'm Pennsylvania Dutch). Added the sliced apple, per suggestions. Glad I did.

Great sauerkraut recipe. I also added some sliced apples as I sauteed the onions. Loved the dill. I often cook a pork loin with sauerkraut for my German/Irish husband. I think I'll use this sauerkraut recipe from now on.

We thought this dish was delicious. I prepared it a bit differently from the instructions. I cooked the sauerkraut as directed and browned the pork chops well in a LeCreuset castiron pan. Then I added the kraut and baked the dish (covered) in a 275 oven for about 1/2 hour. It was beautiful. I did omit the dill.

Outstanding! I followed the recipe closely but I also decided to add some potatoes. I microwaved them for a few minutes and then cut them up and added them to the sauerkraut mixture! It was sooo good!!

I don't get it, I didn't get it, and I won't get it again. I love sauerkraut. While this recipe made the sauerkraut look lovely (a rich golden color), I didn't think it tasted much different than sauerkraut with caraway seeds from a can! The slightly better taste was not worth the effort. Next time I will stick to my simple stuff--dump a can of drained kraut in a dish, mix with grated onion and potato, brown sugar and caraway. Top with browned pork chops, cover and bake til tender . . .

This is the absolute best sauerkraut recipe. It is sauerkraut taken to a new level. Dinner party sauerkraut, and trust me, I never thought there was such a thing. Do use apple cider and the fresh chopped apple to elevate this to sublime. Dill or no, you can throw away all your other sauerkraut recipes because you will never want to eat it any other way. There are better ways to prepare moister pork chops, but, in case you are not yet convinced: BEST EVER SAUERKRAUT!

I used unsweeten apple juice. I used tongs to plate the sauerkraut and porkchops. Then I poured the cooking juice from the sauerkraut into the porkchop pan, scraped up the brown bits and poured it over the plated food. Wonderful!

I'm not a huge fan of Sauerkraut but this recipe was absolutely delicious and a big hit. Well worth making!

This is a delicious recipe. I used apple cider instead of apple juice and also added some peeled, chopped apple to the sauerkraut after it had simmered for 10 minutes. I browned the pork chops and then added apple cider to the pan,covered it and simmered for an additional 5 minutes or so. The result was a light sauce that went well with the dish. My husband loved it and it's a recipe I certainly will make again.

This was really good. The sauerkraut was wonderful. The only change I would make is to dump the dill; leaves a bitter taste. Possibly my dill was old. Overall, I would make again.

The sauerkraut mixture was delicious - fresh dill is a must! Chops were tender and tasty. My husband was so impressed with the presentation, he went upstairs to get his camera!!

I also used bacon fat instead of bacon, and the dill I used was fresh picked, but dried. It was easy to prepare, tasted great and presented very well. I could see making this as a main dish for a semi-formal dinner party. Wild rice and spinach round out the dish nicely.

I made this for a man who said "I will eat anything except sauerkraut". Well, he LOVED it and asked for seconds (which there weren't any). This dish is fabulous - be careful not to cook the pork chops longer than 5 to 6 minutes per side - they will dry out. Doubling the recipe worked very well. The dill is a MUST - makes all the difference in the world.

I was looking for something easy to cook for my parents. I had porkchops, but i didn't add the dill . I substituted bacon grease for the bacon, which when sauteed with the onions gave it a wonderful flavor. everyone in my family dislikes sauerkraut, but they loved this

I had all of the ingredients except apple juice, so I substituted vermouth. Then I added chopped pared apple and raisins. It was delicious.

This was a great recipe. The best part is the sauerkraut. I plan to make a pot for my next cook out, because it would be perfect with hot dogs, sausages, you name it. And so easy!
