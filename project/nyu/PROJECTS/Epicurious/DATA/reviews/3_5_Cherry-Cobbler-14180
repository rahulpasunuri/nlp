This is a great recipe for cherry cobbler. I had sweet, not tart cherries so I calibrated the sugar accordingly. I used another biscuit recipe which had cream and sour cream in it as I wanted a richer biscuit. I thought the 2 tablespoons of yellow cornmeal was a bit much (and made it that way). I would prefer a more delicate taste with the the crunch without the greater corn taste--but that is purely a matter of taste. In the future,I will use white cornmeal/yellow cornmeal in equal amounts. I have two other tips. I cooked the cherries in a cast iron skillet. I patted my biscuit dough into rounds and then cut equal wedges which I arranged on top of the cobbler (vs.dolloping). The Amaretto or Frangelico really make this recipe special. I have bottles of both. They never go bad, and you can get years of use out of them. I highly recommend them as an addition to the kitchen pantry.

This was delicious! Following the advice of other reviewers, I used the peach cobbler topping, which was just a little skimpy (will probably increase by 50% next time) and sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar. I'd also recommend draining the cherries a little after simmering them, because I ended up with way too much liquid and had to drain them; I can't imagine using all of it. I also used a tablespoon of almond extract, since I had no liqueur on hand. Very tasty!

This is a tasty and straightforward fruit dessert. I quartered the recipe and split the filling and topping between two creme brule dishes. (Bake 20 min) Perfect for two people! I substituted rum because that's what I had on hand but I wouldn't recommend skipping the allspice...it makes all the difference.

I'm not great at desserts, this was easy and so impressive, and that's exactly how I need a dessert recipe to be. I followed the recipe but for a couple changes. I used a bag of fresh cherries - I have no idea how many, whatever they sell at Whole Foods, I think it doesn't matter, it was enough. I substituted Whiskey for the frangelico, since that's what I had and I didn't have allspice so I used a combo of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove, and probably used more than called for with all the tasty ingredients (spice, whiskey, vanilla) but not with the sugar, I always use less sugar. And I used brown sugar. I didn't have cornmeal so I used a combo of almond flour and semolina which are both coarse. And I added some lemon zest to the cherries as they were cooking. It was better or as good as any five star restaurant. It was perfect.

Fabulous with fresh cherries. I left out the liquer and used the biscuit topping that went with the plum cobbler, as suggested by other readers. Really nice with the cinnamon, plays nicely against the cherries.

This was a great dessert. I too used the "Plum Cobbler" topping which proved to be a hit. I used "Splenda" instead of sugar and the result was the same.

This cobbler was one of the best things I've ever made. I had very fresh bing cherries from a friends orchard so that may have been part of it. This recipe is awesome I love the biscuit topping, I'm making another one right now!!

I used another reviewer's suggestion to use the topping recipe from another cobbler (the Plum Cobbler on this site) and my cherry cobbler was delicious! The cinnamon biscuits for the topping were a perfect addition and it was a delicious use for the 2lbs of cherries I had. I would definitely suggest eat this cobbler warm with real vanilla ice cream. Yum!

Here is how to make this recipe awesome. Also on the epicurious site is a recipe for plum cobbler with cinnamon biscuits. Make the dough for the biscuits as directed, and then put the bowl with the dough in your fridge. Make the cherry filling as directed in this recipe; put filling into the baking dish. Take out the dough, and spoon on golf ball sized balls of dough onto the cherry filling and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar as directed in the plum cobbler recipe. Bake on a middle or middle-low rack at 400 degrees for 25 - 30 minutes. I have never come across a cobbler crust recipe that made such a light and flavorful crust, and the cinnamon flavor is a great add to the cherries.

We thought this was very good. I agree that there are better cobbler toppings (Peach Cobbler is still my favorite), but this was good. And the filling was delicious.

I wasn't as wild about the topping as I had hoped. It seemed kind of dense and heavy. Although we enjoyed this, there are other cobbler recipes on Epi that we prefer.

I also used almond extract, instead of the liquer, and it was delicious. I liked the corn flavor with the fresh cherries

Tart, but very good. I just used almond extract instead of the liquor and thought it was just fine.

I was quite happy with this recipe. I got my hands on some fresh cherries but not 6 cups worth. I ended up having to half the recipe and it still turned out great! I thought the topping was delicious and it smelled divine while baking. I baked the halved recipe for 25 minutes.

I didn't think this was the best, the filling was very good, but the topping was not that great.

It was an easy way to make a cherry dessert which my husband loves.

I have made this recipe many times with many differet fruits, such as peaches, apricots and blueberries. I scoop the topping on with an icecream scoop and put a small amount of cinnamon sugar on top of each mound. Everyone loves it!!

True, it is quick and easy and gets RAVE reviews and it does turn into much if you use sweet cherries. Next time if I only have sweet cherries I would decrease the sugar and increase the cherries and the cornstarch. I would also try the oats instead of the cornmeal. Thanks for the tips.

Easy, quick and gets RAVE reviews from everyone, including my 80 year old grandfather, who's a stickler for cobbler.

I had to use canned tart cherries. Next time I will only use 1/2 cup sugar. Then it will be a four fork recipe.The allspice really gives it a good flavor.

Wonderful recipie with an old-fashioned grandma-made flavor. I substituted oats for cornmeal and it gives a great crunchiness to the topping. Be sure to use tart red pie cheries, or you'll have mush on your hands.
