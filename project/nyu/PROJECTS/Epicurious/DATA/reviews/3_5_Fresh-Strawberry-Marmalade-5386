Delicious. The orange marmalade with the tangy and sweet macerated strawberries is wonderful on crepes.

We get an abundance of strawberries this time of the year and this is such an fasy, easy dessert to make up with ingredients that you have in the cupboard. I took to a friend's place and used bought icecream. Next time, I will use my fresh frozen yogurt. Superb!!!

This strawberry topping is fantastic! Wonderful with the crepes, or with vanilla ice cream. Everyone I have served it to has asked for the recipe.
