Sauce was truly delicious. I used rockfish (aka striped bass); next time might use a less expensive fish.

OK folks. Had some of the sauce left over. I used it on breaded chicken cutlets (Barefoot Contessa recipe). WOWOW! Beat out the fish by a long shot. Really delicious.

Yummy; thank you! Couldn't find striped sea bass. Got Chilean Sea Bass instead. Think this would go with many mild fish. Probably chicken, too. Totally forgot the fennel, although I had it, but great regardless. I'm a new cook, so this was easy. Right on target first time round. Don't forget some good bread to sop up the sauce. I used foccacia.

This is very easy. I had it for a family dinner- a week later, my son and daughter called to get the recipe.

delicious and easy, would work with many kinds of meat. also, aside from the box of raisins, which are cheap and will last you a while, everything in the sauce is a staple in many kitchens. so it's excellent for having people over impromptu.

I made this last night using cod and though I'm never that crazy about pan-fried fish, the sauce was terrific. I would definitely use it on other things, maybe boneless chicken breasts.

Delicious! Looking forward to trying it with other fishes like halibut. For the reviewer in the Bay Area, found white balsamic vinegar at Andronico's...

Very easy to make, and came out great. In fact, I'm going to make it again tonight with the rest of the fish!

Made this dish for Christmas and used black cod because it was more accessible than the bass. I'm not sure how the striped bass would have turned out, but the black cod was a perfect compliment. Did have trouble finding the white balsamic even in the Bay Area.

I used fresh pacific halibut which worked well but probably didn't pair as well with the sauce as striped bass. The sauce was fantastic, however, and still worked well with the halibut. A real winner!

I made this dish for two people to test it before A"rolling it out" for a dinner party. It was delicious and easy to prepare. The sauce is fabulous. Curious to see if a less expensive fish would work as well since striped bass is a big pricey at least in the new york city area. I'm not sure how it would work out for a dinner party since it needs last minute tending, guess I will just excuse myself while people finish their soup or salad while I finish the final 10 minutes of the fish prep. Enjoy
