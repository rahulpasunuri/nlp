I still say it's spinach and I still say the hell with it. I added a teaspoon of lemon zest to the raw shallots and doubled the recipe, but otherwise followd the recipe exactly. It was ho-hum.

Pretty great as far as spinach goes. Quick, healthy, flavorful. We used baby spinach which really helped.

Good and very easy. We make spinach relatively often and, it certainly gets boring. There are only so many times you can sautee a leafy green vegetable in olive oil and garlic. Surprisingly, addition of the shallots does make a difference. We served it with a Moroccan seafood dish and it worked well.

This is a quick, easy and delicious spinach recipe to prepare. I have made this several times and never tire of it. I have tried other spinach recipes and this one is by far the best!

I was shocked at how flavorful this dish is. The shallots make all the difference! To cut down on time, go to your grocery store's salad bar and get your prewashed, pretorn spinach there. Also, next time I'll use a flavored olive oil to saute...perhaps a rosemary garlic oil...just for something different.
