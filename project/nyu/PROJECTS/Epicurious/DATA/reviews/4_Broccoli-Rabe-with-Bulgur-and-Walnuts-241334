I've been trying to stick to a no gluten/wheat diet so I substituted quinoa for the bulgur and it was still amazing. This dish is like Italian cuisine met middle eastern and the two had kids - absolutely delicious. Use a good quality grated parmesan here as it will balance the sharp bite of the broccoli rabe. The whole thing had a rather mediterranean peasant quality to it which I always like. Very healthy and easy to make. If broccoli rabe is out of season it would be equally tasty made with kale. Cheers.

This is my first time using rabe. Very bitter, not crazy about this recipe.

This is amazingly delicious. I only had fine bulgur so i used 1 cup soaked in 2 cups boiling water. The parmeson really makes this!

Replaced bulgur with quinoa, and my family and guests all loved it. It freezes well, too.

This recipe is tasty, extremely healthy and works well for lunch leftovers all week. Can use any green vegetable and cook it the way the recipe calls for -- I added nettles with the broccoli. I also added a can of chickpeas to make it an entree, 2 cloves of garlic with the shallots, and a little lemon rind and smoked paprika at the end. Didn't skimp on salt and skipped the walnuts. Highly recommend!

This is delicious. I use less oil the suggested by the recipe and, sometimes, I add a chopped tomato at the end.

Very yummy. I halved the amount for 2 servings plus leftovers. My husband does not like broccoli rabe, so I used red-stemmed Swiss chard, blanching and shocking it as in the recipe. I used one-third the oil (1 Tbsp for half recipe) and it was fine. I did not know the "grind" of my bulgur; it did not seem quite done after 20 minutes of soaking, so I added it to the skillet with the liquid and let it absorb and cook down a litle, then proceeded with the rest.... will make again!

Wow! This was great! The store was out of rabe so I settled for kale & then at the last minute I realized I had mistaken a bag of barley for bulgur. So, my version was barley & kale, which doesn't sound half as good as the original but was surprisingly delicious! Otherwise I followed the recipe, except I cooked the barley in broth & the result reminded us of a healthy risotto - creamy & delicious! We ate it with roasted acorn squash, which was a great combo.

Very delicious. Didn't have high hopes for this, but was very pleasantly surprised. Would definitely make this again.

Score (another) one for Bittman. This is a perfect, easy veggie fall meal!

Love this recipe. After I finish cooking the broccoli rabe and sauteing the walnuts, I put them in the food processor. Then I mix these ingredients into the recipe. The dish is similar to a tabouleh.

Delicious! I followed the recipe, but used less olive oil and subbed curly kale for the broccoli rabe. I'll definitely make this a regular in my rotation.

This is not 4 stars in the "impress your guests" sense but in the "so delicious for something so healthy & easy!" sense. I couldn't find bulgur so I used quinoa (the supergrain!) which I cooked in broth rather than water to give it extra flavor. Also added a couple cloves of garlic. Very satisfying.

This is a great way to serve rapini, which on its own can be too bitter for many taste buds. I use almonds instead of walnuts and less Parmesan, but it's a big hit every time.

This is one of those "better than the sum of its parts" recipes. Delicious!

This recipe was just okay. I will try it again, next time with toasted pine nuts instead of walnuts.

This was amazing ... it looks beautiful, has wonderful texture, and the flavor combination is great. I could not find broccoli rabe so I used kale instead, adding it right after sauteeing the walnuts and a few minutes before adding the bulgur. Absolutely delicious!

Incredibly easy, very flexible, and very delicious! I didn't have everything on hand, but it worked out perfectly with pine nuts and half shallot-half leek. And it makes plenty!!

Delicious! I happened to have different versions of the ingredients, which I used in place of Mark Bittman's suggestions. I substituted broccolini for rapini, whole wheat couscous for bulgur, and chopped slivered almonds for the walnuts. To cut back on fat a bit, I used about half the amount of oil and nuts that Bittman suggests. I thought it was still excellent, and hearty enough to be a whole meal on its own. Beautiful and springtime-y, too!

Awesome! My family loved it - even the picky ones. I did use whole wheat couscous in place of the bulgur, and I used pecans instead of walnuts. The pecans complimented the salmon that I paired it with, and I have people in my house who hate bulgur (not to mention, couscous cooks up quicker). It was not dry at all, and in fact; I cut back on the oil. I good, solid side! Very filling.

I've made this twice already and really love it. It's easy, healthy and surprisingly delicious given how simple it is. Definitely a great weeknight meal.

This was very good--I will definitely make it again. I used all the rabe, otherwise cut down on the quantities of ingredients and I forgot the lemon altogether, and it turned out very well. Super quick and easy!

I used regular broccoli instead of rapini, and it turned out fine. I imagine almonds would also be a good substitute for walnuts. I think I would prefer this served over whole- wheat pasta or brown basmati.

Wow! Delicious and simple to make. I didn't use as much parm as the recipe called for, and it was still fantastic. Filling, healthy & flavorful.
