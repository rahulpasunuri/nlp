This was an OK way to use leftover turkey. I followed the directions as written but added the peas as suggested by others. I would probably look for another way to use leftover turkey next time.

A good 'comfort food' kind of dish that we'll make again. Used a mix of mushrooms, a top quality gruyere cheese, and just used Heinz gravy from a jar. Would definitely add some peas. This would be an awesome dish to make ahead for new moms or a sick neighbor..

Yum! This is a great way to "hide" the Thanksgiving leftovers. It really seemed to be its own dish, not just a way to use up the turkey and gravy. The gruyere makes all the difference--I wouldn't substitute another cheese.

I have to admit that while I was mixing the gravy, cheese and cream I thought "this is disgusting" but it was quite good. I too added peas and baked it at 400 degrees and put it under the broiler for a minute because we like crisp baked pasta.

This dish was very bland. I would not make this again. I added brocoli for color and to make it more interesting. I would not recommend it.

This dish is awesome, I added peas to it to give it some color. Making again tonight, outstanding flavors!

Quite hearty. Consider adding a green veg to it to make it a one-dish meal.

This was absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS. I used green onions as opposed to shallots, canned instead of fresh mushrooms, the correct amount of gravy (which I supplemented with a bit of low-sodium broth), 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream, and dark-meat chicken instead of turkey. It did turn out a bit salty, so next time I would definitely use fresh mushrooms, and I would cut back a bit on the meat as it seemed like too much. YUMMY.

Easy & relatively quick. Next time I would add peas before putting it in the oven. I too added extra gravy and I thought it worked out well. Great way to use up leftover turkey and gravy.

Quite good and an efficient way to use up leftovers. We always brine our turkey before roasting and despite what the recipe says brined roast turkey worked fine, just don't add extra salt. We thought it was a little on the dry side with a cup and a half of our turkey gravy, next time I'll add up to two cups of gravy.
