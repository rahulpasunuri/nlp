Love love LOVE these! I could happily eat the batter alone, but baked are also excellent. Chopping the raisins is a bit of a hassle, so I'm going to omit it next time- they clumped together in the dough and I had to pull out bits. The spices were great, although I might use a bit more next time. They came out nice and soft with a little chew.

i liked this cookie so did my friends. i had to change it uo a bit though. all the spices I used my mortar and pestle for and added some pumpkin spice to the mixture... but the original recipe is very good. when i changed it up a bit the cookie become more 'fluffy' than it was at first.

This cookie recipe had excellent flavor but the cookies spread out too much and were too thin. I chilled it as instructed. Perhaps the recipe needs adjustment. Anyone else have this probelm?

These were great. I made them as part of my Christmas gifts and everyone expressed how much they loved them.
