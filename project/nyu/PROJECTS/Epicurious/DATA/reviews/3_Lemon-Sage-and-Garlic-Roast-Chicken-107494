I did use thighs instead of breast because I just prefer thighs, but it came out sooo tart, and I only stuck a half of a lemon slice under the skin and just a sprinkle of lemon over the pieces. I remember having great lemon chicken as a kid and have been searching for a good recipe ever since, I´m still looking:(

We didn't find the flavor combination appealing at all. The lemon and sage just didn't mesh. I'll not make this again - it was a big disappointment.

Wonderful and fast weeknight meal. All my four kids loved it as well.

This was ok, nothing spectacular. I made this with skinless boneless chicken breast, and layered the lemon slices and the sage leaves on top. The chicken turned out moist and flavorful, and the presentation was nice.

This came out terribly bland. Maybe I did something wrong? I forgot to add the garlic...

This was easy and quite tasty. I'd put it at 2.5 forks if I could. I roasted a whole bird (~5 lbs) at a much lower temp--350. Took about 2 hrs to roast, but the chicken came out quite tender and had a nice, subtle flavor. Boiling down the remaining liquids made a nice "glaze" that brought out some of the lemon flavor. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli. Made for a nice, easy to prepare (but long cooking time) meal

I followed the recipe but used a whole chicken cut up instead of just the breasts and dried rosemary instead of fresh sage. The chicken took about 45 minutes and the smoke from the high heat and splattering fat/chicken broth set off the smoke alarms. I couldn't make the sauce due to the burnt areas on the pan.I had hoped for a tasty dish but the chicken was unremarkable. And I had quite a mess to clean up.

I am not the best cook but had to host a family rehearsal dinner for healthy eaters! It was quick, easy to prepare and got rave reviews! I actually surprised myself. I will make this again for sure.

This a good summer recipe - light lemon flavor and fresh sage. Also is easily made for one person.

This was good with chicken legs as well, nice and moist. I'll try this again with sage or rosemary depending on the other dishes I make.

Used rosemary instead of sage. Turned out quite well -- delicious and pretty.

Good for in-laws because it's easy, looks great, and the chicken is so moist. Sage and lemon are a good pairing.

i haven't made this, but if i could point something out. glassware will explode if heated too high, pyrex, on the other hand, will not. they even make pots out of the stuff. it lasts for years, and it's pretty easy to clean, better than metal pans

This is one of our favorite chicken recipes! It's easy and delicious. The fresh sage gives it a wonderful flavor.

I've made this dish several times, and have always been pleased with the results. The chicken comes out juicy and nicely flavored.

I've made this dish 4 times. Every time has been excellent, however the last time my husband's chicken breast was not cooked through. I don't bother with the sauce, the first time i made it didn't add anything to the dish and was too much work. Didn't know that about the glassware exploding on a burner--Alton Brown put his on there. All in all, it's very flavorful, easy, and moist.

This was a big disappointment. It was too lemony and bland. Oh well, you can't win them all. My husband didn't even finish one portion and that's saying something!

A very savory way to prepare a chicken cut that's often dry and flavorless. When the garden sage is plentiful, and we're not in a grilling mood, this is the best. A winner.

I loved this dish and I made it twice in one week. Both times I used rosemary because I couldn't find any fresh sage. The first time the sauce was not edible, I had no idea glass baking dishes would explode when placed on a burner... but when I made it the second time I found that it was way too salty. It might have been becasue the chicken broth was not low sodium, but it tasted just like ramen noodle broth. I thought it was really good, but without the sauce.

To the cook on 4/09/03: I'm right with you on that one- 1/29 needs to keep that vast array of knowledge to him or herself. I plan to make this tonight- guess I wasn't BORN knowing how to roast chicken every posible way! THANKS Epicurious...

We have made this recipe many times and it is excellent. The hard part was remembering what issue it was in and then I thought to go to this site and found it right away. We are having this for dinner tonight. We always make the whole recipe and have the rest for lunch on a salad. Excellent!!!!

I removed the skin of the chicken out of habit not remembering I was supposed to keep it on. So instead I covered the pieces (used thighs and breasts) with parchment paper before I put them in the oven. The result was definitely not bad, but nothing I'd die to make again. I made this dish simply because I wanted to use up some sage in the fridge and I was making chicken anyway. Would probably only make it again for the same reason. Really easy to make. Had to cook thicker pieces of breast for 10 more minutes.

This dish may be simple but it was a flavor combination I had not tried before. Chicken is economical and easy to prepare after work. My family doesn't mind having it serveral time a week as long as I keep trying different recipes styles and flavor combinations.

Is this a recipe, or just an ingredient in a recipe? This is roasted chicken. Why do we need a "recipe" for it? Heat + chicken + herbs and spices = Roasted chicken!

Agreed! Very simple dish that was delicious. Substituted the sage leaves for poultry seasoning and worked out great.

Very simple recipe - took no time to prepare and cook. Delicious and low fat (if you take off the chicken skin after cooking). Definitely a week night keeper.

I used 6 VERY thin lemon slices and liked the lemon and sage flavor. BY THE WAY, pointing out spelling mistakes may not be appropriate, but neither was Tracy's review. The purpose of a review is to do just that: review the recipe. Not to condemn it and call for its removal from the site.

Like this dish a lot! Put garlic under skin too or drizzle with the olive oil to prevent over -cooking it as I did.

Awwwwwwwww Yeah Y'all. You know Paul is back! And I'm bound to attack. No matter what y'all throw at me I'll always fight back. Quit dissin the spelling, I don't hear Mr. Webster yellin! Paul says let the food speak fo itself. This is the dish for which even a genie himself would wish. Four Forks, yo! Holla out to me and Happy New Year Epicurious! Peace in the Paullenium!!!!

I made this recipe with boneless skinless chicken breasts, using all the other original ingredients. I dusted the butterflied breasts with Wondra flour, sauteed them on the first side in olive oil, added the minced garlic to the pan before turning the chicken. After both sides took on color,I added the broth, lemon juice, placed the sage leaves on top and I added six baby carrots per portion. I covered the skillet on low heat for about 15 minutes. Then a added fresh green beans for the last few minutes and had a whole dinner ready and only one pot to wash. This is a nice, subtle new flavor combination for chicken and I would serve it to guests.

I found this to be a very tasty dish, easy to prepare, and lemon and sage go well to-gether. I must say though that this review space should be limited for just that, and not for trivia regarding grammar etc.,discussed back and forth like a game of ping pong.

I have been making a variation for a long time, I place the garlic under the skin with rosemary instead of the sage, quite good and easy to prepare

Rating: 2
The sage leaves a bitter taste so I modified the recipe by using rosemary instead of sage, kosher salt and crushed red pepper flakes on the lemon slices and fresh garlic slices under the skin with a pat of butter. I substitued the broth with white wine and made a cream sauce instead of glaze...It's fast and yummy...The original recipe at least gave me a general idea of what I wanted.

I thought this recipe might be a good easy recipe to make during the week. Even though it is quick and easy, it is not good. It is quite bland and the sage leaves made the leftover broth very bitter. I wouldn't recommend making this recipe.
