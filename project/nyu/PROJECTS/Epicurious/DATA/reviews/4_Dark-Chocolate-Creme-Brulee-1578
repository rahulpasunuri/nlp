I was very hesitant to make this recipe after all the negative reviews but I must say I was so glad that I did. I didn't have any chocolate on hand so I whipped up a quick batch (12 tablespoons cocoa powder 10 tablespoons sugar 1 stick of butter combined over medium heat and then set until firm) and continued as described. This was unbelievable! I did however use a creme brulee torch which is far more efficient than the broiler with regular white sugar. Would absolutely and will make again! No doubt these will be on request. Perfect amount of custard and don't know what people were complaining about.

Made this for Valentine's Day for my wife, her favorite dessert. We have another recipe that we have made many times but I thought I'd give this one a try, as it was a little easier. It wasn't as good, so I'm only giving it 3 forks and won't make it again. Others may find it really good but I wasn't happy. It was more like a very rich pudding than a nice creamy custard that I have come to expect. I think part of the problem is it was overcooked, 50 minutes is too long. I've never cooked creme brulee for more than 40 minutes. Also, don't just use plain sugar, use proper brulee sugar for the crust on top, sooo much better.

Rating: 3
I give this 3 forks instead of 4 because I never had chocolate creme brulee so I have nothing to compare to. After reading reviews about 8oz semisweet not being enough chocolate, I added 4oz dark chocolate too. They aren't even done yet but I snuck one and they are amazing.

I LOVE creme brulee, therefore, although this is good, it just didn't live up to my expectations. To much like chocolate pudding with a sugar glaze. It wasn't as creamy as I'd hoped and it was a little too sweet. I was looking for it to be a bit more bitter. Perhaps I'll try it again using different chocolate.

Rating: 3
I will admit I made a mistake making this - I was attempting to make only half of the recipe but ended up still adding 1/3 cup of sugar. I worried it would be too sweet (and likely was for a dark) but it it was a delicious regular chocolate then! I also added a teaspoon of cocoa powder. Guests raved about it. For consistency next time I might use all whipping cream instead of part half & half. I liked the consistency of the vanilla bean one I made which only used whipping cream better.

I have never made a creme brule before but want to try this recipe for valentines day coming up. I am using some large coffee mugs in place of the custard cups (I read somewhere else that you can use these just as well) however I think this will make it a bit deeper... therefore I am wondering, how do you know when it is done cooking?

So easy and very good! Great dessert for company since all the work is the day befoe!

With the change from 8 oz of semisweet to 12 oz of bittersweet, this recipe really is rich, chocolatey and not too sweet. My only complaint is that it does not have the texture of a creme brulee. However, I found that the recipe really soars when served warm with a dollop of whipped cream! It's almost like a flourless chocolate cake and you can leave off the burnt sugar topping.

This was my first try at creme brulee and it turned out great. It was very easy to prepare (I followed the directions exactly) and my family loved it. I did use the broiler, but I think a torch would make things easier.

Excellent recipe! I used a torch instead of the broiler brulee method. I also used 11.5 ounces of chocolate as suggested by other reviews. I would definitely make it again.

First time making creme brulee and it came out excellent - thick, rich and creamy, excellent contrast with crispy top. I used much less than a tablespoon of sugar for each - I prefer a thinner, crisper crust. Excellent results!

This was fabulous. My guests were astounded. I used 12 ounces of chocolate (half semi, half bittersweet callebaut) and served it with a hazelnut cream and raspberries. I used just enough sugar to coat the top so the creme brulee top was thin.

Excellent dessert. Not really that complicated but best to organize pots/pans/ingredients before starting for novices like me. Used Hershey's Special Dark chips as replacement w/ great results. They came out extremely smooth and rich. Didn't use the broiler method which seems to add a couple hours; used a smaller torch and they were ready to serve in minutes. An Alton Brown technique for the sugar was to start in the middle and then tilt the ramekin as the sugar starts to melt so it runs to cover the entire surface instead of just applying heat from above and waiting for it all to melt. Worked really well after a couple of tries.

I think this is a super dessert. I've made it twice now. Like others I added more chocolate for a total of 11 1/2 oz. I also used all bittersweet chocolate because it's my favorite.Ihe brulees had to cook longer than the recipe suggests. My favorite!

I am a total novice and this was easy and great. Made it according to recipe first time and it was too sweet (hence, three rating). Made it second time with 1/2 bittersweet and 1/2 semisweet and it was so much better - and darker too. I let it bake 10-15 minutes longer because they just did not look set at 50 min. Strained it the first time and there was nothing in the strainer, so skipped it the second time and it was perfect. Made it for a dinner party and everyone wants the recipe.

This was so good! It was what one looks for in a créme brulée: cool,and silky. The semisweet chocolate was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing.

I run a small catering company, and all of my customers love the pie I have created with this recipe. I make a chocolate graham pie crust with 2 tbsp. cocoa, Sugar, 4 tbsp. unsalted butter and 9 whole graham crackers. I bake it at 375 for 8 minutes just to seal the crust somewhat. I use 10 oz. of bittersweet chocolate one additional egg yolk to make it a little stiffer for cutting purposes. Sometimes I use all whipping cream instead of half and half which also helps thicken it. The recipe becomes a Chocolate crème brulee pie and it will knock your socks off.

Rating: 3
I used 12 oz Sharffen Berger chocolate- about 8oz semisweet and the rest unsweetened. It was a mellow dark chocolate flavor. I bumped up the sugar to a half cup given the intensity of the chocolate, and I'm glad I did. I'm a frosting-eater and ganache lover by nature, and this came out almost too heavy on the palate for even me. My guests all asked to take their leftovers home--but they all had leftovers. It was just really dense. Next time I'm going to swap out some of the cream for milk and use a tad less chocolate. Buuut the flavor was sublime.

Shouldn't this have a pinch of salt? Even my chocolate ice cream recipes call for salt. Chocolate usually pops more with a bit of salt. Maybe I'm crazy.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. However, I found the texture of the Ginger Vanilla Creme brulee on this site much more appealing. Next time I may modify that with the chocolate, etc., from this recipe. All in all it was still delicious, but did put a damper on the dinner party conversation as everyone stopped talking to make yummy noises.

The flavor of this desert was very good. It didn't have a creme brulee texture, but it was very yummy. One world of caution... I was at sears to buy a propane torch, and the guy convinced me to go to a smoke shop for one of those torch lighters. It didn't work worth a darn, so the sugar didn't carmalize. Stick with the big torch.

I have made this several times now and everyone agrees that it should be called "orgasmic creme brulee." I add a little extra chocolate to satisfy my friends' deepest cravings...and if you don't want to spring money for a fancy creme brulee torch, do what i did....go to Home Depot and buy a small propane torch. It's about 1/3 the cost and will last a long, long time. Not as glamorous when you're entertaining. You must indulge in this velvety smooth custard. In winter i serve them with chewy gingerbread cookies. Definitely torch just before serving to ooh and aah your guests. I even taught my friend who can hardly boil water how to make this. It's that easy! Enjoy!

OMG! This is awesome! I have some other creme brulee recipes I want to try, but I can't get off this one. It's soo easy to make, as well, though I did find the kitchen torch to be a must. I don't how the hell you get the sugar to melt under the broiler. I just couldn't do it. However, it's very quick and easy with the torch, plus it leaves the top hot and the rest cool, which I like. I tried raw sugar as well as plain white and brown. I honestly found the white sugar on top worked best. I highly recommend this!

This was delicious, but I think if you are expecting a traditional brule, you will be surprised. It's more like a chocolate 'pot de creme' - thicker set, not velvety like the custard in a brule. I baked it for 40 mins only and next time i would try even less to achieve that wobbly texture i love in most brule recipes. great taste, at any rate. serve with a dollop of whipped unsweetened cream and a few rasberries

Everyone was very impressed with this, it tasted like the best chocolate pudding I've ever had. Not difficult to make at all. I used 12 oz. Trader Joe's semisweet chocolate, and it was great, although it seemed like milk chocolate would have been good too, I'll try that next.

I have now made this recipe at least a half dozen times and have discovered it is very forgiving! I've used every kind of chocolate, including chocolate chips, made do with a combo of milk and cream or just half and half, I never strain it and still it comes out so yummy that my husband and I scrape the bottom of the ramekin with our spoons, hoping for more! This is a very unintimidating treat to make.

I cut the recipe by 3/4 so I could just make 2 --I thought the batter tasted fine, but the finished brulees didn't have the silky texture I hoped for. It was more like a chocolate mousse. I feel like they cooked for too long but it was my first time making. I'm going to try a different recipe this weekend (breaking in my new kitchen torch).

Made this last night and it was fantastic. I used Lindt bietterweet chocolate. Took the advice of other reviewers - raised the amount of choclate to 12 oz. and used raw sugar for the brulee. I don't have a torch, so I used the broiler, which worked fine. Definitely a keeper! It is so rich, you could serve smaller portions, so this recipe really is enough for 10.

I have made this twice now and have concluded that this is my favorite creme brulee recipe. Rave reviews from guests and have shared the recipe. If you ever make it to the Enchantment Resort in Sedona try their Chocolate Volcano Molton cake (I think it is on the web too) which is equally great...or better yet, make it yourself!

Rating: 4
Wonderful and delightfully simple. Could not find the bittersweet chocolate so we used semi-sweet (Trader Joe's is a great source for chocolate). We test drove different sugars on top: regular graulated, super-fine granulated, brown, and raw. By far, raw creates the best crispy sweet top. In many other brulee reviews I read people recommending brown. After our test, however, I really think they meant raw (which looks brown). On caveat, this is easy and doesn't take a lot of time, but it does take planning to allow for the chilling!

Rating: 3
This recipe was as easy as it was delicious! It is definitely something that I'll make again. However, if you're cooking for two, I would cut the recipe into quarters. The first time I made it, I cut it into half and I had way too much! Not that I'm complainig :-) But I felt so bad for eating something that was so good!

I've made this twice and both times it was very good. The first time I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips, the second time I halved the recipe (higher math for me to figure out half of 1/3 cup! turned out a little too sweet) and I could not find any "good" chocolate so ended up with Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate chips. Definitely try to find the best chocolate available. I agree with others, more of a mousse than a creme brulee but still wonderful!

Oh, this was just fabulous. Served it New Year's Eve. I used the extra chocolate as other recommended--1/2 semi-sweet, 1/2 bittersweet. Also--thanks for the tip about getting a torch at the hardware store. Worked great. While I was at the grocery getting the chocolate, I started chatting with another person who was also getting chocolate for creme brulee. We compared notes. She'd received a "creme brulee" kit for Christmas, with a much more expensive torch. We agreed to meet at the Red Cross shelter if our dessert plans went up in flames, literally. No problem here, however, and I assume her pricey torch also worked.

Used 12 oz of chocolate as other reviewers had advised. Cooked for an hour as well. Extremely creamy and delicious.

Relatively simple yet extremely impressive. I doubled the recipe without any problem. Because of the metric pacakging of the chocolate I use I ended up using slightly more than the 12oz suggested by others (a total of 750g for the doubled recipe) - with good results. The doubled recipe (16 ramekins) took about 70 minutes in the oven to set. Instead of the sugar topping, I heated 2 packages of frozen raspberries in light syrup, put them through a sieve, added 2 packages of gelatin and some sugar, and topped up each ramekin with the mixture. The in the fridge to set. A nice alternative. I guess you could probably use the same principle for an orange or cranberry gelatin topping.

This was a VERY easy recipe to make and turned out great! I followed the suggestions of others and used 12 oz. of chocolate. I also only used 1/2 tablespoon sugar on top - any more than that wouldn't melt completely without burning. This is a great recipe to make ahead of time!

Prepared this for New Year's Eve dinner. It was great and it will become a dessert staple. I skipped the sugar and instead poured a bit of Bonnie Doon Frambouis (raspberry dessert wine)on top of the brulee. A puree of raspberries would also provide a nice finish. I used an extra 4oz of semi-sweet chocolated per the earlier comment, and would also recommend a few extra minutes in the oven to ensure proper set-up, especially if you are using larger ramekens.

This dish was a BIG hit! I had to make this on the fly and it turned out very well. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added another 4 oz of semi-sweet chocolate to the recipe. The cooking time was exactly an hour and the 6 oz custard cups were filled to the brim. Yum Yum!

Very easy relative to how good it was. I tried using the broiler to caramelize the sugar and I ended up deciding the little kitchen torch is worth it if you plan to make again. My broiler (which is admittedly old and unreliable) heated unevenly and scorched the sugar in places. Still good though!

We found this recipe to be excellent, but we added more chocolate as per a previous reviewer's remarks that the original recipe didn't seem like it had sufficient chocolate, both in color and flavor. By adding more, we found it was superb. We also found it took longer to cook, even with covering the baking pans with foil.
