I didn't have 2 items, so I improvised. Substituted rice wine vinegar for appple cider and half & half for buttermilk. I used stilton w/apricots(TJ's) for the bleu cheese. I don't know what the origanal recipe was like, but this is sooooooo good. Really easy, too. Love it:)

Good flavor - if you use only 6 cups of coleslaw. 12 cups is to dry. I will make this one again. It was a hit at the office potluck.

I've been trying to mimic the red, white & bleu slaw served at Maxie's Supper Club in Ithaca, NY. This is the closest so far; include the additions mentioned in earlier reviews (dijon, mayo, scallions) and sub half of the green cabbage with red. Great with spicy BBQ at the 4th of July.

It cannot compare to the recipe for Blue Cheese Coleslaw, Gourmet, May 2004, p.38, which I had wanted to save.

I wouldn't make this recipe again as written, but I took the advice to add sherry vinegar, dijon, mayo and onion, and it produced an ok dish. I brought it to a bbq and everyone appreciated that it wasn't the same old cole slaw they had been eating all summer. It not phenomenal, but it's something different.

I wish that I had read the reviews on this before I made it. I definitely would have added to the ingredients. It was not exceptional, but with some changes I would make it again.

My husband and i really liked it. Although I do use mayo and cut the buttermilk. Because I love nuts I also mix in candied pecans.

I made this coleslaw and was not impressed!! It was very runny and tasteless... I even doctored it up the next day and it was still tasteless. I won't be making this again!!!

I've made this recipe twice. My husband and son loved it...I followed the advice from the cook from Saskatoon (thanks!). I used mayonnaise and a little dijon mustard...It was excellent...

Don't waste the blue cheese.

I make a blue cheese slaw recipe that uses mayonnaise, a splash of cider or sherry vinegar, a teaspoon of dijon mustard, and a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper. Stir in some crumbled blue cheese, and add to shredded cabbage and green onions and garnish with more blue cheese. You certainly can't say it's bland! Maybe give that a try instead.

This recipe was OK, but I wouldn't make it again. I thought the blue cheese would really give this recipe a kick but it was pretty bland.
