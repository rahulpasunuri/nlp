I was looking for a quick summer weeknight meal and this was a terrific choice as we love grilled veggies. The vinegar really brings out the flavor of the roasted peppers and onions. I was not able to find Luganega at the last minute, so I substituted hot Italian sausage from the meat counter. I also added wedges of Portabella mushrooms in the veggie mix, which really soaked up the smoky flavor of the mesquite lump charcoal I cooked over. I also grilled a couple of bunches of small, vine ripened campari tomatoes when I cooked the sausage, leaving them on the vine as a tasty garnish. I will definitely make this again!

I used balsamic vinegar, and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Omitted the oregano. Delicious. Will definitely make this again.

Tasty and simple. Just sauteed the peppers and onions in a big skillet, then did the same with the sausage and tossed everything together with the dressing.

Used chicken Italian sausage. Maybe we would have enjoyed it more with another sausage but probably not.

Excellent dish! Wonderful flavour. Quick and easy. Made it exactly as it says, except I used a mild Italian Sausage and a hot Italian sausage. I also didn't use a perforated grill sheet - I grilled the veggies right on the grill of the gas Q. Definitely a keeper that will be made quite often.

This is a grilling staple in our house. A little tip - You can get a bit more flavor to the veggies if you can find some Two Sisters Gourmet Balsamic Mediteranean Grilling Oil. It already has all the herbs mixed in with the oil and balsamic vinegar. Let the veggies sit for about an hour in the oil before grilling. If you don't have a local source for it, you can get it at www.twosistersgourmet.com/culinarycoach.
