Simple and delicious. Doubled the recipe but only increased chocolate by 75% and kept the sugar the same.

Excellent! Quick, easy, and tasty. I love that it can be made quickly with ingredients on hand. I have yet to make it in an 8" pan, but have made it countless times in small ramekins for individual-sized desserts. I've made the recipe as-is, but prefer it less sweet, so I cut the sugar back to 2Tbsp and it's perfect. Love it with ice cream, but have also topped it with a smear of whipped cream cheese and a fresh-made berry (cherry or raspberry) compote for an extra-luxe treat. Delish!

This was my work dessert potluck contribution and was quick and easy. I doubled the recipe and put it into a 9 inch pan. This worked out well and it was thick enough. I did add pecans instead of walnuts and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup in the doubled recipe.

Yummy... based on other reviews, I used .65 lbs of chocolate (used everything I bought, little less than 1/4 cup of sugar, no walnuts, and little more vanilla. It was easy & came out very chocolaty.. It totally hit the spot.

Delicious and simple. I used bittersweet 60% chocolate chips and melted the entire 1 C in the microwave with the butter. This was very quick. It is a bit thin, as other reviewers had noted, but it's great. Just ate some with vanilla ice cream. Yummy!

rich and delish. I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 and had a perfect 1/2" brownie sized torte.

This was indeed a very thin brownie torte, but I liked it that way. It discourages over-indulgence! Very nice with a bit of vanilla ice cream, and so easy to throw together.

Like other reviewers, I used extra vanilla, which was good. Next time, though, I think I would use more chocolate and less sugar - I would have liked it to be richer and more chocolatey, but not necessarily sweeter. I would also try doubling it, because I didn't really like the fact that it's so thin - I wasn't expecting a full-fledged brownie, but my torte was less than 1/4"" thick! Overall, though, a good quick weeknight dessert.

Scrumptious does not even begin to describe this heavenly marriage of chocolate and... well, chocolate. Paired with mango sorbet and fresh strawberries, this dessert was the smash hit of our boatwarming party! Nat, our third, doesn't even eat dessert and he LOVED this torte! Next time, we'll use some more vanilla and top with fresh whipped cream! Yummmm!

I have been making this dessert for years and recently decided to experiment. Instead of putting 1/4 C. chocolate chips in the batter, I used 1/4 C. peanut butter chips. It was wonderful.

This is incredible to be so easy to prepare! The brownie is very thin, but still manages to stay extremely moist on the inside - the texture is perfect. The addition of chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream make this the ideal dessert!

This is a very easy recipe and it came out great. The torte is quite thin, I was expecting it to be more like a traditional brownie. I also added vanilla and a splash of Irish Cream. Delicious.

We were looking for something that would satisfy our chocolate craving in a hurry, and this looked like it would fit the bill. This was great -- I added an additional 1/2 tsp vanilla, a generous tsp of cinnamon, and a scant tblspn of cocoa. Oh, so satisfying!

This was amazing and so easy. I added a chocolate glaze over the top and served with ice cream. I received rave reviews from my dinner guests.

This recipe was made by a friend, and it is truly scrumptious! It would be great served with a drizzle of rasperry sauce over the top for guests. If you love chocolate, you'll love this torte!

The best brownie recipe ever! Make sure you serve it warm and with ice cream. The recipe makes a very thin torte, next time I may double it and see what happens.

This is fantastic and SO easy. We served it slightly warm with Maple Walnut ice-cream and a Selaks ice wine. Very rich, very decadent, my kind of thing.

Big hit with the male contingent! Very decadent. Got a little scared b/c the recipe does not make much (thought I messed it up somewhere but didn't) but it turned out very well. Served with ice cream, it was a wonderful meal-ender. Can't think of anyone who would not like this; would surely make it again!

This is excellent. Be sure to serve it warm with coffee ice cream
