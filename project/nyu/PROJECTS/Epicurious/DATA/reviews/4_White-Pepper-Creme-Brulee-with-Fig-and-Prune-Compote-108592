soo good! used finely ground fresh black pepper, and about 2X the recipe. used brown sugar dissolved into the cream and then folded into the yolks, served with fresh garden strawberries which were in season instead of compote. DELIGHTFUL!

I made this years ago for an assignment in culinary school and got an A+. This creme brulee is slightly sweet yet unique in its flavors (with the compote). Definitely a winner!

Served this New Year's Eve as part of a Catalan themed menu. Instead of making it in small ramekins I used a 8 or 9" shallow cake pan. Added an extra teaspoon of sugar for "the pot". This was the only dessert of several that had NO leftovers....in fact one of my guests forgot himself and began to eat it directly out of the pan, ( OK it was 2:00 AM and many libations later ;)) The pepper.......such a lovely touch! Oh yes and I baked the custard (w/o the brulee finish; did that an hour before putting it on the table and left it on my fire escape to cool-it was cold that night; the melted sugar became nice and brittle) 4 days before serving and covered it with a damp cloth. Held up beautifully with little shrinkage. Served it with the compote which in truth could be halved with ease course now I have the pleasure of eating the compote with my morning oatmeal.yummmmmmmm! A definite keeper to be served time and time again.

This was the winner of a dessert serving "brulees done 3 ways" for last evenings dinner party. I did not make the compote, just crusted the top with sugar and it was PERFECTION. The other 2 were the Dark Chocolate (2nd) and Lemon (tied for 2nd) with Raspberries from this site. Don't know why this was rated only 3 forks. Wish I could give it "5"

I made this last night for company and it was delicious and rich. The creme brulee is great by itself, but when you eat it with the compote, it takes on a different flavor and texture. The slight tartness of the compote takes some of the sweetness out of the creme brulee. I was expecting a hint of the zing from the white pepper, but surprisingly enought, couldn't detect any. An overall good dessert!

The custard was amazing! I'm not huge into figs and prunes, but this was an OK compote. The custard is rich enough and sweet enough to stand on it's own, however. This is great for company. I used a propane blow torch instead of a broiler, it made more even melting.
