QUICK?!!!!? This took at least three hours and then like five to clean up after! I will dance on your spleen if you say this is quick one more time!(Dancing on slpeens is fun you should try it!)

Delightful! I agree that a sharp knife is essential...go slow!...but this beautiful, delicious and unusual dessert is worth the work and effort. I doubled the amount of cranberries for extra colour and crunch, and used Triple Sec as that was what was on hand. I made a large batch to give to clients as a Thanksgiving present and it's a definite hit.

FABULOUS! This was gorgeous and very unusual. You do need a VERY sharp knife; my mandoline didn't slice the oranges well at all (a surprise), and it terrified me to have my fingers so close to its blade-- the oranges would have ben crushed/juiced had I used the utensil/pusher thing. But a good, freshly sharpened knife worked beautifully. I will make this again not only with the eggnog tart, but with other desserts as well-- marvelous.
