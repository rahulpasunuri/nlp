I used to make this from instant packages, but this recipe is so much better (the nutty aroma is just heavenly), and so simple too! There's just something very comforting in this warm gooey dessert! I'd like to know what purpose boiling the walnuts serves though.

One point I forgot to mention - as with most desserts, add a pinch or two of salt. It brings out the sweetness & adds complexity to the dish.

In retrospect, I seem to have altered the recipe significantly, but with 3 ingredients, that's not difficult to do! Instead of peen tong, I used palm sugar, but expect dark brown sugar would work as well. I also substituted cornstarch for the rice flour, but halved the amount used. This wonderfully creamy dessert tastes just like the ones served at high-end Chinese restsurants!

I just returned from Hong Kong where I tried this for the first time. It was delicious. I left without getting the recipe and was delighted to see it on your tv program. Thank you so much for printing it.

This sounds good. I'll watch the show Fri.,March 3, when it will be on tv; I hope they tell me what I can use in place of the candy called for in the recipe, because--what if I can't find the candy called for? Any substitute?
