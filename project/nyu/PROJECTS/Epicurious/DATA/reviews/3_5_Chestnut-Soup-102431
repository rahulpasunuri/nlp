Now, I love chestnuts, and I love duck. And I like anise a whole lot. But the combination, somehow, was a little odd. I wonder if it would be possible to substitute fresh ginger for the anise... I used fresh duck stock from our thanksgiving duck -- as always, the stock makes the soup.

I would honestly give this 2 and 1/2 forks. Made it for Thanksgiving dinner. Cooked it with the star anise and then used the Williams Sonoma chestnuts in the jar. The chestnuts took much longer to fall apart, not an issue. Pureed it all as my family prefers it that way. For those looking for exotic and easy, this receipe is it. For those looking for "Wow", did not make the mark. Would not repeat the comments from the teenagers or the much older senior grandparent types. I don't like chestnuts but I did not mind the soup at all. Perhaps fresh chestnuts and homemade stock (versus Swanson doctored) would have made a difference but this one goes in the back of the receipe file to collect dust.

An instant favorite! If you are looking for a twist: replace the star anise with some bacon bites for serving.

I made this for New Year's Eve dinner. It was totally easy to make, and tasted fabulous. Everyone loved it, even people who did not know what star anise was. The flavor was subtle but very distinct. I will definately make this again.

Although I did not have star annise I added a tbs of pernod. It was delicious and after serving it to my family who do not like soups I was overwhelmed by cries for "more".
