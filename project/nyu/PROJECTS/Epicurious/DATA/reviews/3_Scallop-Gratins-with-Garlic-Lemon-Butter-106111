Used very small scallops and Panko bread crumbs, also sprinkled soem shredded parmesan cheese. Put the scallops in a single layer in the pan. Bake for 15 min, 350 for 15 minutes. Perfect.

Quite disappointed in the outcome of this recipe. I used scallops, baby shrimp and fresh dungeness crab to make it more special. Sad to say there was so little flavor, even though I upped the amount of garlic. The confusing thing is the name of this recipe being "Scallop Gratins". A gratin is usually a topping mixture of breadcrumbs, cheese, and butter (or oil). However, this recipe has absolutely no cheese. That being said, I added about 1/3 cup of parmesan to the bread crumbs, which still didn't do a whole lot to improve this.

I made it exactly as stated for a weeknight meal and I thought it was very good.

After reading the reviews, I cut the cooking time down to 15 min. I would also use small shrimp next time as well. I used a convection oven and the texture of the toping was great and the scallops weren't too soupy. Just enough juice to soak up with some french bread while eating.

Easy and delicious. My guests loved it and keep asking for me to make it again.

I agree with "the screamer", this dish was awful. It was dry & pretty bland. The dish was too heavy on the lemon (I'd cut it in half) & probably could have used more garlic, but I truthfully don't think anything can save this recipe.

To the cook from Sunderland, VT - Stop screaming. And if you can't cook, you can't cook - don't blame the recipe. If fixed it several times, and it was excellent.

THIS WAS JUST AWFUL.WE GET SCALLOPS WITH NO WATER ADDED AND MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETER WITH THE WET KIND, BUT I LISTENED TO MANY OF THE REVIEWERS AND UPPED THE GARLIC AND SHORTENED THE COOKING TIME AND STILL FOUND THIS RECIPE BLAND AND VERY VERY DRY. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS ONE!!

I don't know how anyone could make this dish bland. With a ratio of 3 Tbsp butter to about 4 Tbsp of seasonings, plus salt and pepper, you're pretty much guaranteed lots of flavor unless you leave some stuff out. I upped the garlic, because I love garlic, but it would have been just as good without the extra. Make sure you do add salt and fresh-ground black pepper. Anyway, I had a few scallops and a few shrimp, so I used both, and they were perfect after 20 minutes. I only have 8 oz. ramekins, so they were stuffed full, but the flavor was great and the juices good for dipping bread into. Make sure you don't skimp on the crumbs!

I thought this was really going to be good, but was disappointed. Bland flavor, nothing exciting. The ingredients seemed right, but just didnt do the job.

I ignored some of the other reviews and tried this recipe exactly as written. It left me disappointed. I'm a cream sauce and spices lover and it was simply unexciting. Had it not been for the bread crumbs, it would have had even less flavor.

Not impressed. This recipe was worth a try for a weeknight dinner but nothing special.

Yum! I made this as soon as I saw it in the 1/02 Bon Appetit. I do not like French bread, so I use crumbs I've made from bread left from a dinner--usually sourdough or a rosemary peasant bread (stored in zippered bags in the freezer). I watch it closely in the oven; it doesn't usually take the full time given.

This was tasty and very easy, but the scallops were already overcooked after only 15 minutes; I hate to think how rubbery they would have been after the full 25 called for in the recipe. Also, the parsley in the butter mixture was drying out and starting to get black after 15 minutes. I suspect the whole thing would be perfect after only about ten minutes. Also, the 1-1/4 cup ramkins specified in the recipe were a bit too big for the job. I had to spread the scallops out, which may have contributed to the speed with which they cooked. I had been tempted to cheat and use prepared bread crumbs, but I am glad that I didn't, as the crumbs are a crucial element of this recipe.

This dish was only okay. The toasted breadcrumbs make it.

I have not always been a scallop lover. But with friends who favor this shellfish, we try to have it often since they are readily available in Maine where we live. Thanks for this new slant on scallops. PS>>>>>we tried it with grated orange & it was fabulous.
