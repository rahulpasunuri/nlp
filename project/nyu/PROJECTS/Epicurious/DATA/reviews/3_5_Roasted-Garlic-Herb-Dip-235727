This garlic was delicious! It was served with the cracked pepper focaccia bread! Will definitely be making again!

What isn't better with Roasted Garlic? It loses its 'sharpness' when roasted, leaving a luscious, nutty, mild garlic-y taste almost anyone loves. One may even skip the fresh herbs, and just roast the garlic in oil following recipe. Then you may add it to mashed potato's(Yum!), chicken, on bread, as a main ingredient in a pasta sauce, in marinades...

Elephant garlic was stronger than anticipated but good.

Delicious on toasts and also rubbed under the skin of a chicken before roasting.
