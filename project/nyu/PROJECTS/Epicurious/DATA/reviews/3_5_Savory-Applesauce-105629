I had to give it a try, based on the split votes that had gone before. It's a nice twist on regular applesauce, and balanced nicely a spicy Caribbean roast pork loin. I skipped the butter (low-fat, don't you know), and used thyme with tarragon, as recommended.

My husband made this to serve with grilled porkchops and it was divine. He substituted Tarragon for the majaroram and it was a real treat!

I am updating my own earlier review. The more I make this dish, the more I appreciate it. I consider it one of my better recipe finds. The complex flavors make it very versatile and delicious.
