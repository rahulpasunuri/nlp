For those who noted no oven temperature, the original printed recipe stated: "Preheat oven to 350 degrees with rack in middle."

These were delicious and fairly straightforward. I spread candied kumquat slices over the ricotta rather than stirring them in, and omitted the crosses. They puffed up beautifully. The flavor was very subtle--it didn't stand up to the rich meal I served before--but they were a treat nonetheless. Will make again, possibly adding more candied citron.

These treats were delicious. Not too sweet. I used salted butter to give it a little balance and infused the milk with orange as well as lavender. It came out wonderfully.

I love this recipe. I made it for a good italian friend of mine and he said it reminded him of growing up in Naples. As someone else noted, there is no oven temp in the recipe. I set my oven at 350 and baked them for the recommended time of 30 min. They came out beautifully and the little crosses stayed in tact. Not sure why some people had trouble with the filling expanding too much and breaking the crosses. Mine expanded a little bit and slightly deflated when i took them out of the oven. The only thing I did differently was flavor them with lemon instead of orange as I have a lemon tree in my back yard. I will continue to make these and experiment with the filling. They are fabulous!

Am I missing something? Because I can't find the temp for the oven anywhere....

I made these wonderful little treats and they transported me back to my youth in Staten Island where, every sunday my father would go to the best italian bakery to get the weekly pastries. These were his favorites and this recipe is fabulous. Thanks for the memories

While just a little labor intensive, this dessert was a great finish to an Italian New Years Eve dinner. It is easy to put together and really delicious. I was unable to find orange flower water in time, but substituted orange oil without any problems. I had two shells leftover, so I used some homemade apple sauce in the last two shells. It was fabulous with a little vanilla ice cream while still warm! The dough is a great recipe and I will continue to experiment with fillings. Definitely a keeper!

These were delicious. Subtle orange water flavour, smooth and rich filling and pastry dough. I used home made ricotta (gourmet.com recipe with heavy cream in it) and replaced citron with my home made candied orange peel. Wonderful as a dessert, or as a morning or afternoon treat with tea or coffee.

These are super yummy, but next time I will skip putting the cross on top. It broke when the filling expanded, and in Italy they don't have crosses on top. It also took about 40 minutes to bake rather than 30 and I ended up turning my oven up 25degrees to get some color. Also couldn't find candied citron or orange flower water, so substituted about grand marnier and half the amount of crystalized ginger. Made the ricotta and it was worth the little extra effort.

Wonderful way to end an unpretentious meal, but also as a morning or afternoon treat with tea or coffee. Very subtle and pleasant orange water flavour. I used home made ricotta (recipe on gourmet.com, the version that has heavy cream in it), and replaced candied citron with my own home made candied orange peel. Simply delicious.
