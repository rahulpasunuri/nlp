I have made this pie several times and everyone loves it. It is especially delicious with ginger ice cream!

I have made this apple pie each year for Thanksgiving since 1999 and everyone loves the flavor and texture. The one difference in how I make it, is I make it more as a cobbler. I make it in a casserole dish, with no bottom crust. This recipe is a keeper.

I didn't like the sour cream in this pie, I tried it again without it and I liked it a lot better. Texture-wise it wasn't totally necessary, it actually held together better, or at least mine did. I liked the nuttiness of the streusel, so I almost doubled it (about 1 1/2) the second time and everyone really liked the results. This is a very easy pie, great for beginners.

Made this last Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Really nice combination of soft/tart apples and crunchy/sweet topping. Serve it warm with ice cream, and if there's any left over, have it for breakfast!

The cornmeal made the topping gritty.

Did not enjoy this pie. Extremely tart, but otherwise not that interesting. Struesel was dry and didn't add much impact. Too many good apple pie recipes out there to use this one again.

This was very good and a big hit with my family. Filling is not too sweet and topping is terrific. I would make again, but I would cut down slightly on the cloves. I used a ready made crust and it was fine.

This apple pie is delicious - I love the crumbled topping. I've already made it once, and plan again to make it tonight to bring to a Christmas Party. I did not go with their pastry, I prefer the Flaky Pastry Crust recipe in "The Joy of Cooking". Only one change would I make to the above recipe: double the amount of streusel topping and keep the amount of apples to a minimum for maximum surface area for the streusel.

Interesting taste and very good. Make sure you use fine cornmeal. Cut down on the cloves.(too overwhelming). Changes I made to the filling: use only a pinch of cloves, 1/8 teaspoon fresh nutmeg, 1/8 cup white sugar and 1/8 cup packed light brown sugar in place of the 1/4 cup white sugar. I think the pie tasted great the second day. It is an interesting tasting pie with the cornmeal struesel on top.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and was very disappointed with it. The filling was not sweet enough. I liked the struesel topping but the filling ruined it. I would not make this pie again.

Warning: this pie is addictive! I usually modify recipes to suit my own whims, but I followed this one to the letter and don't think much could be done to improve upon it! The struesel topping bakes into a heavenly sweet crisp; I served this at Thanksgiving while it was still warm, with a good quality vanilla ice cream, and it sent everyone into a swoon! Be sure to stick with a good, tart baking apple for this recipe; the sweetness of the crisp counteracts the tartness of the apples beautifully.

I made this pie with an already prepared pie crust and home grown apple and thought the pie was fabulous! I will definately make this recipe again!

I thought this recipe was great. I have made it twice in the past 2 months and both times had rave reviews.

I must have done something wrong. Followed the recipe exactly and pie was VERY tart. Perhaps the Granny Smith apples that I got were just too tart. My guests did not care for it either. Probably will not make it again. There are other really great apple pie recipes.

Even for someone who doesn't really cook, this receipe was EASY. I made two pies which I brought to my husband at work at the fire station. The firemen loved it. Definatley a receipe I'll make over and over again.

A bit different than usual and very good. I though the sour cream might result in a mushy texture, but it just a creamy/spicy filling among the apples. I did use firm apples, though, a combination of Gravenstein and Golden Delicious apples that I got at a farm stand. The flavor was great. Substituted almonds for the walnuts, since that was what I had on hand. I don't think it matters. Try this when you want something just slightly different.

I have made this recipe several times over the holiday season and each time the comments were you should become a dessert diva, the results were so great.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving in individual pies and eveyone loved it. Although it was a little too sweet for me the next time I made it was for a small dinner party and I just cut out some of the surgar and added a little lemon zest. It was delicious!
