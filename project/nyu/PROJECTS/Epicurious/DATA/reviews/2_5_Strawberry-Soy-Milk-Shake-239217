I have this for breakfast almost everyday with frozen strawberries. Add a pinch of salt. That will give you the pizazz! I promise.

This smoothie is good--but not amazing. I followed the recipe--and it needs more honey for some sweetness (and I don't even have a sweet tooth)--and maybe more strawberries. I agree that it needs some pizazz--lemon juice, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger? Something to make it less bland.

We're trying to find alt proteins for breakfast - so decided to try this recipe. We used 12 oz (not 2 cups) silken tofu since that was the package size, 2 C FROZEN blueberries (not strawberries) since that's what we had on hand. Since blueberries were frozen I didn't add ice. And because it turned out pretty thick, I added an extra half cup of soy milk. It was *fine* but could have used a little more pizzaz. Would have been better with strawberries - where the tartness would cover the soy flavor a little more. Or a bit of lemon juice might have made it less chalky. Will keep trying new modifications - I think maybe a cocoa base would be good with the creaminess.
