These are very good. I don't like using garlic powder, so used 1 clove garlic mashed to a paste with the salt. Also used the oil from the oil- packed sundried tomatoes in place of the vegetable oil. Note the instructions are missing a key step - let the shaped buns rise till almost doubled in size prior to applying the egg wash and sesame seeds. Then bake. I am making a second batch of these today to give to my vegan kids.

I have made these twice, and suggest 1-packet of active yeast, that does the trick! I made the first time as written and used sundried tomatoes in oil + added the sundried tomato oil instead of vegetable, using 2tbsp instead of 2tsp. I just made last night with olives, rosemary and gruyere cheese! so good! I'm keeping this recipe around!

These buns were delicious - though mine did not rise as well as desired, perhaps this was the fault of me, the yeast newbie. I plan to make these again with olives and rosemary.
