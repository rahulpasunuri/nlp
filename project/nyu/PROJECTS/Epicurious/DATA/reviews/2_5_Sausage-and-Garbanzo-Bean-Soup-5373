This dish was watery and tasteless. I tried the suggestion of another rater to include diced tomatoes, but it still was watery. I won't make it again

However, I would add elbow pasta and lots of fresh rosemary and a generous sprinkle of e.v.o.o. at the end. My Mom used to make this soup dance! (she used Italian sausage.) dick

This is comfort food! I omitted the egg and added one can of diced tomatoes. Good for a winter evening.
