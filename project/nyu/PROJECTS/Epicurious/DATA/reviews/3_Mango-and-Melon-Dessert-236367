I disliked this dish so much that I didn't even serve it to my guests. However, the next day I used the puree on vanilla ice cream with a ginger snap on the side and that was okay.

This was wonderful, for what it was. Very simple dessert. Served after the Tandoori Shrimp and Mango Salad to my book club (we read the Namesake). The flavors were simple and refreshing.

Maybe the nutmeg was too overpowering, but my boyfriend and I thought that the mango puree sort of tasted like spiced babyfood. I like it because it is light and refreshing for a dessert but the taste was a little too spiced.

This is more in the vein of responding to the reviewer from Belgium. This is the best review I have ever read - Mon Dieu! Thanks for the laugh, Monsieur :) The dish was great too ;)
