This is perfect if you love the combination of strawberries and rhubarb, but are tired of pie. It's also pretty darn good if you're a rhubarb neophyte. I used the remainder of a bottle of Facelli Late Harvest Syrah (about 1/3 cup), and then opened up a bottle of Kiona Late Harvest Riesling to make up the rest of the wine. The sabayon came out a lovely dusty pink colour. Serving it in a wine glass is fun, you get the fragrance of the wine first, but the flavour of the rhubarb really shines. The strawberries are a wonderful counterpoint, they're hidden little treats that don't flavour the rest of the dessert, so when you get one with the sabayon, you get a great complexity of flavours in your mouth.

i made this for the first time for a dinner party. It was a hit and they asked for the recipe. This goes well with a variety of berries.

Amazingly wonderful recipe - does not store well, so make sure you have 4 people at the table to inhale this lovely treat. I also used a smaller amount of sugar as suggested (1/4 cup) - didn't have the liquor that was listed, so I used Setecieli Vin Santo, an Italian Dessert Wine which has an almond and candied orange taste. Have been so inspired by this recipe that I've just put in several rhubard plants in my garden. Wow!

I've made this twice now. The first time as written. I felt the sabayon was too sweet and the rhubarb did not come though. I made it again and added more rhubarb (1 1/2 cups) and less sugar (1/3 cup). More of the tartness of the rhubard and hence the flavor came through. I will cut the sugar a little more next time. Maybe it is a personal perference. I couldn't find organge Muscat wine so I added some orange zest to the wine when I simmered the rhubarb. Be sure to use a very deep bowl to beat the sabayon. I had a lot of sticky sabayon flung around the kitchen which caused some comments by my meticulous spouse. She calmed down after tasting the result. Whew.

This is an excellent spring dessert. We are just getting rhubarb and strawberries in the market. It's easy to make and surprisingly it refrigerates very well and reheats very nicely. The similar recipe made with citrus on this site is also excellent.
