This is the perfect little dish for busy weeknight meals. It's fast and flavorful and the only chopping to be done is 1 onion and 2 tablespoons of canned chipotle peppers. Plus, you can prepare rice while the main dish simmers. What's more, those remaining chipotles keep for a good 6 months if stored in an airtight container in your fridge. (There's a lot of bang for your buck in those little cans!)

I haven't made this in years, but I may make it again this weekend. For those that say it lacked complexity, I had added a tablespoon or so of almond butter (that is what we eat, you could also do natural peanut butter). That gave it a bit more thickness and complexity. Looking forward to trying again. It is a very simple recipe, with decent results.

This is a fine dish for the amount of time and energy it takes. I found the Mole sauce to be a little "one note" and heavy on the first day, but as leftovers, it was much better. That being said, this is fine dish for a rushed weeknight.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe as written. It definitely doesn't match the complexity of a mole, but for the time and the effort, it was close enough to satisfy a craving for mole when I came home exhausted from work. When I reheated the meal the next day for lunch I did find it slightly more complex and improved. I quite like spicy food so I didn't find the heat level overwhelming although it was spicy enough to clear out my sinuses and leave my lips tingling for a little while.

Glancing over the ingredients I was quite surprised by all the rave reviews, as I simply could not see how these few things could possibly produce a nice mole after mere 20 minutes of simmering... Here are the changes that I made: I used reconstituted sun dried tomatoes instead of the second can of canned ones and doubled up on chocolate, and still needed to double the cooking time to produce more of a mole-like consistency. However, this did not achieve any complexity of a real mole. For the time and effort involved it's definitely a keeper but next time I'll cut down on liquid even more and use reconstituted dried plums instead of sun dried tomatoes.

Followed recipe with exception of decreasing chipotle to one 1tbl and used semi-sweet chocolate. Everyone loved the results. Will make again; I always have these ingredients on hand and so it's a keeper. Struggled with giving this 4 forks instead of 3....the chicken thighs (tho good in this recipe, aren't my fave) threw me off.

I just made this recipe last night for my gourmet club with the Mexican Rice with Mint and I have to say that it was quite good, especially with the minty rice, both the flavors really complimented each other. I substituted chicken breasts for thighs and I kind of had a problem getting the sauce to "reduce." Next time I make it, I may add only ONE chipotle chile because it was a bit too hot and add extra chocolate and perhaps some cinnamon. Besides that, it was really easy to make and the simmering makes the chicken very tender.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe as written. It was good, although the chipoltes flavor was a little too much for some people in my household. I served this with a sweet white rice that has raisins and almonds in it. I included a salad of avocados,oranges and sweet onion with a poppy seed dressing. I like the idea of adding peanut butter to the sauce, so I'll try some of the suggestions next time I make it. Overall all I enjoyed he way it tasted.

This dish has so many layers of flavor to tantalize the taste buds. Thanks to Mike C. from Oceanside, CA for his suggestions. The extra chocolate, peanut butter and cinnamon are perfect additions and his choice of the cumin-scented rice as accompaniment is right on.

I made this as written but found it lacking in flavor and depth (no surprise, considering the ingredients & time involved). I ended up adding a tsp of coriander, salt, brown sugar, and another 1/2 oz of chocolate and then pureed the sauce. It was pretty good, though certainly not as good as traditional mole. A good substitute when the time is short -- 2 1/2 forks.

Simple and quick. Works great for a weeknight meal. I found the dish to be very satisfying and rich but also very healthy. Now I need to try mole sauce from a good Mexican restaurant to see how mole is supposed to taste and if my cooking measures up.

Rating: 2
A nice and complex flavor without running through the city searching for obscure Mexican ingredients. I took the advice of other chefs and added cinnamon and peanut butter and some oregano; the mole misses too much wihout it. I also added extra chocolate, but used unsweetened cocoa powder instead of Baker's chocolate, which was leaving a bitter flavor. Not something I'd serve to Mexican friends, but a nice change of pace for a weekday meal.

This recipe has been a staple for our family for a while - one of my husband's favorites! I always use my crockpot to simmer it for a few hours after I have prepared it according to the directions. Like other reviewers suggest, I also add a tablespoon or so of natural peanut butter. Love it!

Rating: 3
This one came out alright. It's definitely tasty - but nothing incredible. I'd make this again on a weeknight for myself, but this is not something I would make for guests. I used about 1.5 oz of unsweetened chocolate and I think it came out just slightly bitter because of that (will use only 1oz next time).

Rating: 3
This recipe has become a regular in my kitchen, but I've altered it over time. I've also added more chocolate and took one reviewer's suggestion for adding a dollop of peanut butter. Also, once when my market was out of chipotles in adobo sauce, I used dried chipotles instead and added dried adobo seasoning to the cumin for coating the chicken at the beginning - this worked well. My family loves this best the second day, when I use the chicken to make enchiladas - so much that I now skip the first meal and make this only for use in enchiladas (hence I cut the chicken into smaller pieces before cooking.)

I'm updating a previous review but my fork rating remains the same for an "authentic" rating. I decided to try this recipe in a slow cooker and altered the ingredients-- it tasted FAR superior though it stayed true to the original version. I used diced chicken tenders instead of chicken thighs and added an extra 1/2 ounce of chocolate. This made it much more mole-tasting than before, because the chipotle really overpowered the chocolate. I still love chiptole, so I bumped that up as well with 1 tablespoon of extra sauce. I put a blob (maybe 1/4 cup) of creamy peanut butter in for texture per the insistance of a friend who makes traditional mole. I cranked up the slow cooker to high for aprox. 2 hours then switched to low, and maybe another 3-4 hours later I checked on the dish and found it to be very rich and the perfect texture and color. Great over white rice, and it tastes great two days later!

Rating: 3
I got the inspiraton to make this dish when a friend gave me a very nice mexican chocolate powder from Dagoba called "Xochtli" or (ch-coLA-ti) It was used instead of the bittersweet chocolate, and it added the exact amount of kick to this dish. One word of caution, if you are going to use canned Chipotle take the extra effort to de-seed them before cooking. I and my boyfriend loved it, but my 65 year old mother did not.

Rating: 3
I made the recipe as written and thought is was delicious, but then again I love chipotle chilis, and this flavor is intense but maybe a little overpowering. I think next time to play around with this recipe I'd add more unsweetened chocolate, some cinnamon, and some orange rind as another person recommended. I'm not sure I'd describe this recipe's flavor as a mole, but it was delicious.

As promised, here is my review. I made this meal and served it with white long-grain rice, green salad with grapes, bleu cheese and a vinaigrette, washed it down with a Zinfandel, and followed it with a blueberry pie a-la-mode. My father-in law cleaned his plate, my wife and mother raved about it, and even my five year old doughter devoured it. Personally, I thought it was marginally good, but I do prefer my chocolate in a desert. I was thinking that the people who said they switched to sweet chocolate must also be the people who used 2 ounces. 1 ounce of unsweetened was plenty. I used Scharfen Berger. The only thing I would do differently next time is use my crock pot, or some other slow-braising method. The chicken was a bit dry for my tastes, prepared by searing and quick stewing. There is enough liquid in the sauce to carry it for 4 hours on low setting in a crock pot, and the sauce would be a bit more infused into the meat. But for a quick, tasty dinner, this one delivers as advertised.

I always get a laugh reading the reviews for a recipe that I am considering trying...they usually go something like this: "I have never made this before but I tried it last night and did not follow any of the directions. I didn't like it." People, people, people! You cannot alter the recipe until you have tried the written version first. I have not tried this recipe yet, but I intend to, and the first time I make it I will follow the recipe. Incidentally, I have the Bon Appetit magazine in front of me from December '01, and this recipe appears in the section "Every-Night Cooking" and is designed to be made in 30 minutes or less. Of course it is not going to tast like an authentic mole. The last thing I have to say is to those people who do not use unsweetened chocolate...without the sugar, the quality of the chocolate comes out...you need to buy good chocolate like Scherfen-Barger or something like that or else you will unleash the flavor of crap. Of course sugar will make crap taste better. After I make this recipe I will post a review, and you can be assured it will be the published recipe that I will be reviewing, not some version that has been altered by the grapevine of dubious opinion.

I made this using "quorn" vegetarian chicken breast-style pieces instead of real chicken, and it worked wonderfully. My family and I are vegetarians, but still love to look for recipes that can easily be converted for vegetarian use. This is an excellent and easy way to create a delicious meal that was as satisfying as it was healthy.

Absolutely delicious. Thick, hearty, spicy, rich, easy, and positively yummy. I served it over white rice with corn torillas. I've eaten traditional, authentic moles many times, and this recipe is quite different from them. I have never made mole myself because of the bazillion ingredients and hours of labor it requires to do it right. This is a quick, streamlined way to get the essence of mole. My fork rating is genuine to the original recipe. I used the exact ingredients and prep methods, so those who rely on ratings to judge whether or not to make the recipe can be assured this is a keeper!

This was the first time I made Chicken Mole. I have had it before perfectly prepared at my favorite Mexican restraurant. Spicy, but not overpowering. My family enjoyed it with simple white rice on the side and a red leaf salad with oranges. The only suggestions I have is to let it simmer for much longer than the recommended 20 minutes. It took at least 60 minutes for the sauce to thicken. I also removed the seeds of the chilis before I diced them, so it wouldn't be too spicy for my children.

Very easy to prepare and very delicious. Even the kids ate it! I included additions suggested by other reviewers (peanut butter and bittersweet chocolate instead of unsweetened). A Mexican-American friend said her grandmother made mole with grated orange rind. I added some grated rind to the leftovers - delicious!

I had a difficult time locating the Chipolte (smoked jalapeno) peppers. When I did I found them dried. I decided to try them and used 3 smaller ones in the recipe (I cut each pepper into thirds) Within 10 minutes of cooking time they had rehydrated and the sauce was quite spicey. I then decided not to allow them to ferment within the sauce for too long and strained them out in about 15 minutes. In fact I strained the entire sauce with cheese cloth. It made for a smoother sauce. The spiciness was VERY intense~but delayed...it caught you in the throat, corners of the mouth and finally at the nostrals. I will make it again but for adults only.

Rating: 2
This is sort of a streamlined version of mole. And to the reviewers that said when they've had mole, it didn't taste like this. It's probably because the recipes for mole depend on each person and region and so on. Some moles are almost black in color, others are light red. The one I made at school was a sort of brick red. Next time I make this, I'll add some peanuts. I like to get raw ones and then roast and puree them.

I gave this recipe high ratings with the modifications: semi-sweet chocolate, peanut butter, cinnamon and removed chile seeds, which gave it perfect heat for us. Also used chicken breasts instead of thighs (cook about 13 mins). My husband is a mole *fanatic* and while he agreed this was not exactly a mole, he begged me to keep this recipe and make it again and again! Buy some masa harina and make fresh tortillas to go with it - a delicious way to mop up this excellent sauce.

I'm sorry but I agree with Kari and the Cook from Toronto...this was not very good and I would not make it again. I love mole but this was not even close in flavor and did not satisfy my craving for mole. Next time I'll go to my favorite Mexican restaurant where it is so much better.

I've made mole poblano the original way--a daunting and time consuming task, to be sure. While this recipe does not taste like that exactly, it does conjure up much of the same flavors. Well, that is, with some additions. I read other reviews and added the peanut butter and cinnamon. The cinnamon needs to be scant. I still wanted a little more depth so I resorted to adding a chile guajillo puree and an ancho chile puree. Three guajillos rehydrated and pureed and 4 anchos rehydrated and pureed. I passed both through a strainer and added. I also thickened the sauce with a cornstarch. It's pretty good and much easier than the original 20-something long ingredient list; although it's not a direct substitute. But for time convenence, it's a good starting point. There are many different kinds of moles (most with very lengthy ingredient lists and even longer methodology) and in it's in own way this IS a mole recipe. For what I put into it effort-wise I was very happy with this recipe.

This is the first highly rated Epicurious recipe that I would not make again. I made a few changes, but it's still not good enough to go back and make the original or tinker with it. I used 2 squares of semi-sweet chocolate and added 1 tbps of Tahini (sesame butter). The chicken thighs I bought were not well-trimmed - I ended up with a lot of oil on the surface, some of which I skimmed off. So I would recommend people make it with chicken breasts instead of thighs, especially if they are going to add extra chocolate and nut butters. I like a little flavourful fat but this was just too much!

I found reading the reviews very interesting. No one made the recipe as written. If you're looking for an authentic recipe why don't you find/make one that IS authentic and review it accordingly. I made this recipe as written and my husband and I enjoyed it very much. It is definitely hot, which we like. I served it with Roasted Chayote & Red Pepper Salad with Tangerine Dressing from this website. Great dinner.

Rating: 3
This has become a regular recipe in my house, but the best part is turning the leftovers into enchiladas the next day. I chop the thighs into smaller pieces before cooking, which makes stuffing the tortillas easier. I use corn tortillas, put some of the chicken mixture in each, roll them side by side in a baking dish, top with some of the sauce and grated cheddar cheese, and bake uncovered for 20-25 minutes at 400. Yum.

So yummy! I cheated 'big time' and put all of the ingredients in a slow cooker and cooked for a few hours until done. It turned out wonderful! I love to try out recipies like this in the slow cooker just to see if it turns out, and this surely did. I too, like many users, put in 2 Tbsp. of peanutbutter, 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 ounce of semi-sweet chocolate. I think this is awsome over rice OR in a fresh tortilla. Again, Yum!

Great result. I added 2 tbls of peanut butter and used semi-sweet chocolate as some other suggested. I also added a dash of cinnamon and some additional cumin. And finally, to give it a little stronger "nutty" flavor I added a tsp of tahini (sesame seed paste).

I made this last night for a dinner party and had not made it before. However, I have had much success with epicurious recipes so I took the risk. I went with two small cans of chipotle w/adobo (about 8 tblsp instead of 2), 1-1/2 large cans of diced tom's, added two tblsp of peanut butter, and used Ibarra mexican chocolate (2 and 1/4 wheels, which I think is about 4 ounces. I also did 3x the chicken on the bone, then cooked for 1 hr 20 min, and removed the bones and shredded the chicken. Our guests, one of whom is a chef, gorged themselves and we ate the rest for breakfast over Jasmine rice. Incredible reviews! Outstanding with a good cab sauv. and make sure to keep the pot warmed during the meal because they keep going back...

Funny that so many of us would make this recipe at about the same time! I found it in a search for chipotle chiles, since I had a HUGE can on my shelf. The other reviewers are right -- it's delicious, even if a bit inauthentic. Also quick and easy. I also recommend removing the chile seeds.

Rating: 4
Easily my favorite recipe on this site. A few notes: Don't be turned off by tomatoes in the mole; this is a wonderful dish. You'll most likely find the adobe chiles canned *in* the adobo sauce; this is fine and works great with the recipe. If you want to tone down the heat/spice content somewhat, make sure to remove the chile seeds from the mixture. I recommend the extra chocolate and some peanut butter as suggested by previous reviewers. Personally the 20 minute cooking time doesn't do this dish justice; I tend to cook it for an hour and even then if I have time I'll try to cook it the night before to make happy well-mixed spices. :)

Rating: 3
The Mexican market nearest me only carried chipotle chilis in adobo sauce so I went with that and it was fine. V. spicy, and not as thick as the mole I've had, but still tasty. Also added peanut butter (2 tbsp.) 1 additional oz. of semisweet chocolate (I didn't have any unsweetened) and about a tsp of cinnamon. It's yummy and thicker that way.

Great, satisfying and easy mole. Made this for several hungry friends who were insisting that "chocolate does not go in dinner." Were they surprised when they caught me slipping the chocolate in behind their backs! Served over rice and everyone went home happy. Would also like to find a peanut-butter version, as another reviewer mentioned, and some weekend, I will take a lot more time making a mole and then freeze it.

This recipe sounds great. I'm sure my husband will love to try it since he loves spicy Mexican food. Note to those who find that Chipotle peppers are too hot: to cut the heat, you can mix the Chipotles with some tomato sauce until it reaches the level of heat you prefer. Also, you can't have mole without rice. Definitely serve Spanish rice on the side to accompany this dish. And a note to the knucklehead from AZ who reviewed on May 16: Make sure your spelling is correct BEFORE you criticize. Hence, the correct spelling is G-R-A-M-M-A-R. By all means, consult your dictionary.

I too have had trouble finding canned Chipotle. I have substituted roasted red peppers (peeled and seeded) with a splash of Tabasco and liquid smoke to taste. This allows you to attain the smoked jalapeno taste without the fiery heat.

Can't wait to try this recipe! Sounds great! In regard to Chef P, the 'copy and paste king', using a duplicate post supposedly reveiwing other recipes on this site, he should get a life and not focus on the short comings of others. Perhaps he needs to get his nose out of a cookbook and into an English grammer book as well as a dictionary! Is this "the pot calling the kettle black"? He should examine himself before judging others. Live and let live. There are too many more important issues, like world peace, to focus on.

This was a delicious surprise! I had some boneless/skinless chicken thighs marinatiating in a garlic/lime/adobo type mix to grill for a dinner party.... The weather didn't cooperate, and I was in a pinch for an interesting substitute. I feared the chipolte would be too hot for some, and wasn't sure how the marinade would do with the sauce, so I broiled half, and followed this recipe nearly exactly for the other half... except, I didn't serve it as a stew, I served the sauce on the side. Although the sauce was kind of hot, the complex blend of flavors was amazing! These babies disappeared SO fast - then everyone was pouring the sauce on the broiled pieces! I intentionally cook much more food than necessary for dinner parties, but I only had two tiny morsels of chicken left! I would definitely use this mole/chipolte mix in the future - It's fast and easy, and would be good on anything.... even Nana's over-cooked pot roast...

Could someone please tell me what I can substitute for chipotle, I live in west africa, no chance of finding them here, but lots of chilis and hot pepe (as locals call the pepper). I'd love to make this dish and do not want to leave the spice out, please advise, thanks!

I followed the recommendations of the other reviewers and added peanut butter and the other interesting ingredients. Over all, it was really yummy however it was WAY TOO SPICY for me.

This dish is amazing! What a great use for leftover roast chicken. Using the suggestions of previous reviewers, I added 2 tbsp. of peanut butter, increased the chocolate to 2 oz. and doubled up on the chipotles and adobo.

Great recipe! Being a Mole' lover I also added a few things to make it a little more authentic. I used 2oz. semi-sweet chocolate, 1 Tbsp peanut butter, 2 Tbsp. Adobo sauce and 1/4 tsp. Cinnamon. As a couple of other posters have noted the chipotles will pack a lot of heat if the seeds are included. With the seeds removed even my picky 8yr. old loved it. In addition the Cumin-scented Herbed Rice recipe was a perfecct match for this dish

Loved this recipe!! It was fabulous. It reminded us of our honeymoon in the Yucatan! I doubled the amount of chicken but still had plenty of sauce. I was also glad to have the advice of a former reviewer to remove the stems and seeds from the chipoltes. Wonderful flavor but they definitely add plenty of heat.

Rating: 3
VERY easy and tasty. I had read a few other mole recipes that called for additional ingredients so the second time around I modified the recipe. I added 2 tablespoons peanut butter and used 2 ounces (instead of 1 oz) sweetened (not unsweetened) chocolate. The extra chocolate and the peanut butter made the sauce creamier/thicker and a bit less spicy. A great winter recipe, real comfort food.

Rating: 4
All kidding and typos aside, or is that "as side"? This was a darn good recipe. Give it a bit longer to cook and use due care with the CHIPOTLES. I love that smoky flavor, but I removed the seeds before chopping, and after tasting, found myself desperately searching to remove the pieces. It was HOT, we were sweating, but it was good too. Whatever, the recipe works. I changed a few things in that I added some favorite spices (thyme, marjoram and a bit of allspice), I also used the recommended amount of chocolate, but could only find semi-sweet chips. As my family likes a sauce cooked to a mush, I also added extra broth as it cooked down. A delightfully pleasant meal on a Friday night, my family dreaded the chocolate chicken but other than a big laugh about the heat, we ate it with great delight and a whole lot of liquids.

I haven't made this recipe yet, it looks pretty good though. This is a comment on the use of the word "chili" and "chilies". I am a chef born and raised in the Southwest. It is CHILE or CHILES. Chili is the tex-mex dish made with chili powder and beef, sometimes beans (although not if you are a chili purest). I don't mean to get off on a rant here, but if you are going to write recipes for Mexican and Southwestern dishes at least have the common courtesy to spell the ingredients correctly. I know that this is sometimes accepted, but that is by people who frankly do not know any better. We would never write fwa graw, or bree, so lets not bastardize the Mexican and Southwestern cuisine ingredients. Thanks Chef P
