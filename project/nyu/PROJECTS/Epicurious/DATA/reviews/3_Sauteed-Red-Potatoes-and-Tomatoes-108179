I added fresh rosemary and some tyme along with minced garlic. This was a very good recipe just a little plain.

Three forks for taste, four for quick and easy. I used about 1/2 lb potatoes for two people, and doubled the tomatoes. Next time I will add more tomatoes. The potatoes took more than 5 minutes, even cut into smaller pieces, and could have used even more time than I gave them. I served it with the Grilled Swordfish with Cucumber Lime Salsa in the menu, and the combination was excellent.

This recipe (?) does nothing for either the potatoes or the tomatoes. To repeat a question I have asked before, who eats a half pound of potatoes?
