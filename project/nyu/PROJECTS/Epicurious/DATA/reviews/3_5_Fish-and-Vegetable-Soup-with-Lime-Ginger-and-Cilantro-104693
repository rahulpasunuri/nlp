I loved this! Had it for lunch and dinner with Family of 3. I also included 2 green squash, 1 bell pepper and an extra 1/2 lb of fish. I WILL make this again.

The soup I made was not bland. I added some green onions to the paste. I also used quite a bit of ginger and used fresh Thai chilies instead of jalapenos. I used chicken stock instead of fish stock and water. My husband loved it! I would definitely make this soup again.

I made this to the letter last night, except reduced the liquid amount a bit, and threw in a couple of cilantro stems into the beginning paste. I agree that it was quite bland. I ended up splashing in a bit of fish sauce, mushroom flavored soy sauce, and a pinch of black pepper. Great flavors/ideas reminiscent of Vietnamese Pho. I think to get the real effect, however, you need to simmer it for a minimum of 2 hours to bring out the flavors in the paste along with the anise, lemongrass, etc. I do have some leftovers, so maybe they'll be a bit more vibrant today!

Made this pretty much as written with fresh fish stock I made that day. Used cod fillets in the soup and a mixture of shitake, bella and oyster mushrooms. Really liked the soup except that I wish the broth had a bit more depth of flavor -- salt is key here -- I probably didn't add enough. Also, in the future, I would use 6 cups of fish stock instead of 4 cups stock, 2 cups water, as the recipe says. It's a very pretty soup and the aromas that wafted through the house were divine. I agree with a previous reviewer that the number of servings is far fewer than the recipe suggests. My husband and I each had an entree portion for dinner last night and there is barely enough left for lunch size portions today. I am looking forward to lunch!

I would recommend using Kaffir lime leaves instead of the lime juice if you can get them - one of the great tastes of all time and much more authentic. I also like the black CHinese mushrooms over the Shiitakes, which I don't find very flavorful. I'm also on the side of box choy or snow peas instead of tomatoes and carrots, although that's not really here or there.

Like most reviewers, I made some changes, mostly based on what I had in the house. I omitted the star anise, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, and tomatoes, and added baby bok choy and fresh noodles. I used mussels instead of fish filets, and forgot to add the green onions. I fully seeded the chilis but then found the soup too bland, so I added Sriracha ("rooster") sauce to the broth to zip it up. Basically, it seems this is a foolproof dish, no matter what you do to it!

I made this as written and found the lime to be a bit overpowering. Next time I think I'll leave out the last 2T. The flavor mellowed overnight so leftovers were really good. I will also try a bit of fish sauce (Nam Pla) next time. Flavor lacked depth. I made with Tilapia, which I liked.

i just made this recipe for the second time....it's really restuarant quality!! i made it exactly as written, only added an extra cup of water and some "better than buillion" clam base. it's delicious and this would be at the top of the list to make for company.

Followed exactly, which is unlike me. I think it has the potential of being a great soup, but I think you might need to make it a few times to get the seasoning right. ALSO, my fish broth, carefully made and frozen a month or so ago turned out to be too "fishy" to make the soup a big success. It does have a lot going for it, with all those great ingredients.

Delicious!!! Definitely a keeper. Not as time consuming as I thought it would be. The 2nd time I made this I did add more bean thread noodles and a little more spices to compensate for the extra noodles. Use fresh fish stock if you could but the kind of fish you use for fishstock really makes or break this.

I added bean threads, shrimp and scallops...it was one of the best soups I've made. I think the type of fish stock you use or make may be the key.

great recipe! my husband (the meat eater) loves it. Definitly add the fish sauce (nam pla) and plenty of lime juice. We make this almost once a week for a low-cal "detox" if we have over-indulged over the weekend - a family favorite.

I thought the broth tasted like it really needed something. I added some Thai fish sauce, then some soy sauce and then some chili paste with garlic. At that point, it had a more balanced flavor and was pleasant, but not outstanding. Even so, it lacked the bright flavors I would expect from a Thai-style soup.

Oooh lah-lah, thats a spicey zupa! Not so much that it burns, but enough to keep you feeling warm and tingley all over. Well worth the effort.

this is an easy and delicious recipe; I have served it three times in the last 6 months and always to great acclaim. Add and subtract whatever you like, but don't omit the mushrooms.

Excellent soup! My 20+ guests were raving for more. Definitely more chilies. I also added some chopped basil for enhanced flavor.

I was thrilled to find this recipe. We live near San Francisco and the whole family loves this soup when we go out for Thai. To make it more like the restaurant's, I added shrimp, more mushrooms and drained canned baby corn but omitted the carrots and sprouts.

Very impressive Thai-style soup. I used (extra) cayenne instead of jalapeno and used regular anise (fennel root) instead of star anise. Next time I will cut down on the lime, especially the last, raw bit. As written is definitely a little too much lime. The fish I used was halibut and orange roughy - definitely a disparity in quality there, but this was a really great soup. My spouse is asking for more.

Great just as written.

Whadda Soup! I followed the recipe closely, but added more pepper early, as well as threw in little dried chili peppers (oh, and it needs salt!) Minced lemongrass?!? Ouch, my hand hurts...I just cut it into inch-long stalks and then fished them back out at the end, along with the red peppers.

This was an ok soup; a bit too "lime-y" of a flavor; seemed like it was missing something; doubt I would make it again.

Wonderful Thai-like soup. Cutting back a little on the citrus ingredients would allow the fish tastes to reign. Red snapper and sea bass (skin on) made a colourful and delicious combination.

This was a very tasty soup. I did find and used the star anise. I also added a can of clams since I was using clam nectar instead of the fish broth. A nice spicy meal with a loaf of french bread. Good.

With some additions and subtractions this soup was exceptional. I made a rich fish stock with two red snapper carcasses, cooked in 4 T. olive oil, then added 2 C. white wine, some water, carrot, onion, a can of crushed tomatoes, thyme. For the paste I used more ginger. Then I used thinly julienned carrots and fennel, and 2 roma tomatoes. Didn't have star anise, so I used plain anise seeds. Did not use the mushrooms or sprouts. Anyhow my soup was fantastic. And I floated some avocado pieces on the top.

I was a little worried at first, because this soup didn't seem to have much flavor. I had nothing to worry about!! As soon as the flavors began to blend, it developed that distinctly Thai kick. I used a lot of lime juice and lemongrass as well as red pepper flakes, but could not find star anise. I think this would be nice if you substituted chicken broth for the clam juice and used chicken as the meat and added coconut milk. A very nice, spicy soup.

Great soup! I didn't use a food processor, you can chop-chop for same effect. I used half table of sesame oil and half veggie. I used two cans of chicken stock instead of water which gave it extra flavor. I coulodn't find star anis. I added snowpeas and watercress with the other veggies and more shitakes. I used shrimp, salmon, and scallops and extra cilantro. Oh and I added some red pepper flakes for extra punch - it needs quite a bit of salt even witht he chicken stock, but I would defintely make it again - perhaps with other veggies like petit pois and spinach which would work as well as other fish. I served over white rice, which is good ladled right into soup.

This was very tasty. I made it with Haddock, and I didn't use the star anise. I used lemon peel instead of lemon grass. I also added tiny brocolli florets. Next time I think I would add some coconut milk to it, and maybe more veggies. I found that more stock would have been helpful - even if its veg stock. Also, the serving size is way off. My husband & I ate it as a main dish, and there was only a tiny bit left over. I did find it difficult to make the paste - I made it in my blender, and I had to add a little liquid to get it to blend together instead of sticking on the walls of the blender. Overall, a very nice unique tasting soup.
