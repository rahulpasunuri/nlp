I made two substitutions: raspberry wine vinegar, and used the olive oil instead of walnut oil. The walnut oil would have been delightful but the salad was special regardless. We had beets from the garden that were extremely sweet and rather bland plums in bulk from Costco. Excellent combination really. I'd like to try again with gorgonzola instead of goat cheese. Definitely use the walnut oil is you can.

I ran out of time to pick up white wine vinegar so used balsamic mixed with the left over oil that I used to drizzle the beets as they roasted. No plums at the store either, so used white cherries instead. Added some toasted walnuts and it was delicious! Had absolutely no room left to have the lobster as main course.

This is a fantastic combination and very healthy salad. I use honey or agave in the dressing. I saute the onions instead of having raw onions, and sometimes have carmelized the oinions. A great alternative to the plums is nectarines.

Made exactly as instructed. This was fine, but I didn't think it was anything special. There are better recipes for a combination of beets and goat cheese.

Very flavorful salad with a fantastic visual appeal; ideal for a brunch or for a main meal lunch. A little too rich to use as a dinner course. Definitely roast the beets a day ahead - a real time saver. Several guests asked for the recipe and the kids have asked for it again - a double winner!

this is an absolutely delicious salad..... i've made it for girlfriends, for a family Christmas dinner and on a smaller scale for my family numerous times, and it is always devoured! Have substituted pears when plums are not available, and love to add chopped pecans or slivered almonds for an extra crunch. Really yummy!

You can't go wrong with beets and goat cheese. Taking the time to ring the salad with the beets makes for a beautiful presentation. I must have bought really big beets, however, because I ended up with way too many. We were eating beets for a week. I did substitute mixed greens for the spinach and used a comice pear instead of the plum. Pear got a little mushy, so next time I would use Bosc or wait until summer when plums are in season. Overall, this is an easily adaptable recipe that I will make again.

Agree with all the reviews- easy and really beautiful. Great flavor combo. Definitely a great salad to make on a holiday.

Took this to a potluck dinner and it was a huge success. Fit in with main course and was different enough from the other salads that it complemented them.

Love this salad - I also add toasted walnuts.

Well, I changed it considerably, but my version got raves from my guests. Instead of baking for 1 3/4 hours, shred the peeled beets in your cuisinart, then sautee them in a tablespoon of olive oil over high heat for about 7-8 minutes. Proportions for the dressing 1 to 3 (oil). I used pears...match-stick size on top. I put the hot beets on the lettuce, then the pears, then goat cheese crumbled, then drizzled. WOW!. The hot beets melt the cheese....mmmmm.

wow, what a keeper! I used sweet mayan onions instead of red and I found a wonderful fig goat cheese. In the summer when beets are plentiful, I will make this with red and other varieties of colored beets.

This is a beautiful salad with amazing color. If you don't like goat cheese use a blue. I also added toasted pecans for added texture.

I made this for christmas dinner (we have a big buffet) and it was awesome!! I made some minor changes: couldn't find plums, so I used pears, cut into a matchstick shape. I used arugula, and I tossed everything together and put in on a large platter, then put the goat cheese on top. It was beautiful - the colors were gorgeous, and it was very tasty. Will definately make again.

I made this recipe for an annual pot luck dinner last year. Everyone loved it. This year I brought a different dish to the pot luck and was thoroughly scolded for not bringing the beet salad again! Wonderful blend of flavors and a beautiful presentation. Next pot luck I'm definitely bringing this salad.

Man, really good. I used the bag baby spinach leaves with arugula and carrots. And roasted my beet on the grill wrapped in foil.

Wow!!! What an easy and elegant salad for those romantic dinners or for company. It makes a beuatiful presentation. I have made this several times and has been a hit every time. You can't go wrong with this one. It's a great combination of flavors and textures. I once used firm red pears and it was just as delicious.

Spectacular taste and presentation. I had a hard time pitting the plums, so I used an apple corer, and it worked great.

A beautiful presentation and delicious tasting salad! I love beets and this was a big hit when I made it for friends.

Attractive,interesting and tasty combination, but would simply mix together,(unless we were entertaining, such as Christmas)and would cut way down on oil and cheese. Since pear season is coming up will try with pears next time.

This is a delicious salad featuring the fresh tastes of summer. We'll definitely serve it again. To save time, cook the beets in the microwave for about ten minutes.

I made this salad using fresh mixed greens from my garden instead of the spinach as well as red pepper, carrots, and celery for color. However, the flavor and texture of the beets coupled with the sweet plums and creamy goat cheese make for a sensational salad. The traditional dressing tops the salad off perfectly.

I served this salad last night and it was an instant hit! Everyone asked for seconds! As I had a lot of lettuce in the garden, I substituted it for the spinach. Would definitely make again.
