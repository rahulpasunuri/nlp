Delicate pineapple flavor -- fantastic flavor -- undoubtedly gourmet ice cream. Best pineapple ice cream I've had hands down. I used 2% milk instead of whole, and splenda instead of sugar (my grandmother is diabetic). This produced a light, delicious sugar-free ice cream. I can only imagine the whole-milk & sugar recipe is even better. I also used pineapple rings and crushed them by hand which made for a more dynamic texture. Juicy chunks of pineapple and the delicate cream are a perfect combination.

Bleech - tasted more like custard than anything else - NO pineapple flavour at all!!!

Very good. Good consistency which not all recipes achieve. Chunks of pineapple are nice. I may put some run in in next time. Worth the effort.
