I echo the "who knew adding mustard to potatoes" would add SO much flavor. I went with a coarse grain dijon (no indication of this). However, for my experience this recipe produced a WHOLE LOT more than for 6 side servings. It's a keeper.

I ended up making my "usual" mashed potato recipe but still used the mustard in the proportions suggested by this recipe. Wow! Why didn't I ever think of putting mustard in mashed potatoes before? Delicious!

A fun and tasty variation on mashed potatoes!

These potatoes are the bomb! They pair so well with the cedar planked maple glazed salmon. It's one of my go to dinner party dishes in the fall and winter.

Absolutely delicious! I substituted half-and-half for the milk and kept the potato skins on. This received rave reviews from my husband's foodie friends. Paired with the salmon and a nice spinach salad, this makes an excellent dinner party menu!

The four forks is for the concept of adding mustard. I used the recipe for inspiration but used yams instead of Yukons and evaporated milk instead of the milk. I also only had half a stick of butter so just used that. I ended up using about half the milk/butter mixture. These were soooooo delicious.

Excellent w the fish. Skins on, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. Super.

I used Russets and added sour cream. Still, I must give four forks for the idea of adding mustard to mashed potatoes. Yum.

Went really well with the fish. I don't peel my potatoes as I like the skin mashed in. The mustard added a great taste.

Who knew? Mustard Mashed Potatoes! Absolutely DELICIOUS! (And I don't even like mustard!) Definitely use the coarse grain mustard, just wonderful! I think I'll make these potatoes with sauerbraten next. :-9

Very good recipe. Something a little different than normal mashed and just as simple to make. FYI - The recipe of the same name from 2005 is almost identical.

These potatoes are excellent with the maple glazed salmon. Would recommend using cream (in a smaller quantity) instead of milk. They re-heat in the oven very well.

Superb as an accompaniment to the "Cedar Planked Salmon with Maple Glaze". As per a previous reviewer, I used the French mustard called Pommery - wonderful but very expensive and hard to find. The cooking time for the whole potatoes will depend on their size. Be careful not to overcook; they will crack open and break apart in the cooking water.

I LOVED this recipe! I did cut and peal the potatos prior, and I use cream vs. milk...but Oh My! Very yummy!!!!

I made these potatoes with the cedar plank salmon, and they were good. I had to cook the pototoes forever doing it this way though. Next time I would just peel them first, then slice them and then mash them. Letting them simmer for so long was a waste of time.

These potatoes were yummy! I made them exactly like the recipe called for and they received rave reviews from the entire family. A nice change of pace from the regular old mashed potatoes.

OH MY GOD!! These were without question the best thing that has EVER happened to mashed potatoes. I made it for my parents (who generally eat a very bland diet) and they scarfed them down. I will never make plain mashed potatoes again....EVER!

these are great and so different!!! Really good with a sweet glazed fish as suggested. I had only cream instead of milk and really enjoyed!

Best salmon recipe I have found. Love the plank method and have tried many recipes.

YUMMY!! I don't know why I never thought of this before. The mustard takes my all time favorite dish of mashed potatoes to a delicious new level.

This dish, with the mustard, is a perfect complement to the sweet salmon. Pommery mustard, in the big crock, is the best...

It was very tasty and easy (especially if you decide to leave the skins on - which we did). Highly recommend it!
