I made changes, also. I roasted the cauliflower (gives a deeper, richer flavor). Omit the garlic and add 2 large leeks, 2 fennel bulbs and 1 small onion, all sliced thinly. Saute above in 1 T butter and olive oil for 5-7 minutes. Add 1 lg can chix stock and simmer 30-40 min. and puree. Cream may be added. Serve w/ chopped chives and warmed, parmesean bread sticks. Fabulous!

I sort of combined the orginal recipe and tips from eileen from Alameda. I used diluted chicken stock to simmer the cauliflower and I added sauteed shallots. I wanted to add sauteed fennel bulb but my market was out. I kept in the fennel seeds and tripled the garlic. I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and the soup was very good. Next time I am going to add some roasted cauliflower pieces and sauteed fennel pieces for a chunkier textire

This recipe can be made better. Use 3 cups chicken stock (homemade or low salt/low fat); skip the garlic. Skip the fennel seeds. Instead, saute a chopped large fennel bulb and a chopped small yellow onion in butter until soft. Add salt and pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Add to the cooked cauliflower and puree.

This is a very mild flavored soup with a nice texture. It would be a good introduction to cauliflower for someone who doesn't know if they like it or not. It is almost too lacking in flavor for my own tastebids.
