I've been making this salad since it first appeared in the magazine. I omitted difficult-to-find garnishes, and it was still loved. In fact, for several years I was required to bring it to our block party (one year I eased up on the wasabi for the kids, and seriously upset the men who loved the heat). We've moved away now, but I hope people will continue to offer this great salad at block parties everywhere.

GREAT. This is a unique salad. If your family likes the taste of sushi they will love this. I left out the pickled ginger because I didn't have any, and I didn't use the decorative shiso leaves. It presented beautifully without it.

This is a great, different side dish. The flavors of this all come together beautifully. I served the salmon with soy-honey and wasabi sauces for a nice summer dinner. This will be a regular in our house.

A nice riff on homemade sushi with a casual presentation we ate it with fresh seafood and miso soup - we really enjoyed it as something different

ok this salad is fantastic! i made it for a girls weekend away at the lake, i stepped out of the kitchen for a bit and when i came back my friends had eaten ALL of it! Not only is this recipe easy but very tasty! enjoy

This is a favourite standby dish in our house. Occasionally I add soy sauce to the Wasabi instead of water. It does affect the colour, but we like the taste of the soy sauce.

This is a great side with teriyaki fish, chicken, or tofu. I've made it several times, and always love it.

Easy and tasty- I added Japanese Mayo with the avocado/oil mixture to make it creamy a bit- IT REALLY MATCHES!

It was only passable. I wish I had printed out some of the reviews for alternate ways to cook the rice, bc it did not come out well. Mine was VERY al dente. Everything was just boring, the wasabi flavor was too mild and it was just all in all, not a keeper.

Great recipe, easy to make. Sweet rice and spicy wasabi "dressing" is a great combo.

Wow. This recipe is dead on. Just the right amount of vinegar and wasabi and flavor. We served with some Ahi Sashimi and in the end could not help but to make Handrolls with the left over Nori.

Though a bit skeptical at first of this all-in-one sushi hybrid salad, it went far beyond my expectations and was downright delicious! I added a few drops of sesame oil to the dressing, but no changes other than that. This is also the first time my sushi rice has turned out perfectly. I soaked it 30-45 minutes, then followed cooking instructions (yes, only 2 minutes!) exactly. Instead of the mucky, gummy mess I usually end up with, it was a flawless, flavorful pleasure to eat. I highly recommend this recipe.

Oh my, this sald is so light and so wonderfully good, we could not stop picking at it after we were all full...to the top!! We topped it with some homemade Sweet Chile Sauce and Wasabi oil.

This is great -- much easier than rolls with all the same good ingredients. You can make it into a main course by adding shrimp.

I have made this countless times and the only modification I do is to add soy sauce to the wasabi sauce! It is phenomenal!! Make sure you soak the rice for at least 30 minutes.

Delicious light dinner! Serve with additional wasabi paste and soy sauce on the side, so your dinner guests can season their own as they like.

This is one of my favorite weekday lunch recipes. I don't use shiso leaves and just add the avocado and nori strips in the morning, just before leaving. I have made it with both brown and white short grain rice. I prefer brown but I suppose a mixture would be good too. Really good!

I made this for a big family barbecue gathering, so I doubled the recipe and served the salad on a platter with the shiso leaves layered on the bottom. It got great raves!

Rating: 4
Simmer the rice for 2 minutes? Is that right? Usually you simmer rice for longer than that, at least 20. I usually follow the rice directions on the container of sushi rice, rather than these. I'm not brave enough to follow the 2 minutes. Does it turn out okay?

This is a great dish for a potluck...I have taken it to three this week! People always ask me for the recipe. It is delicious.

OMG, this recipe is FANTASTIC. I've already made it 3 times w/ rave reviews. The pickled ginger and sesame seeds are the perfect touches. I also add 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro, strips of sweet egg omelette (basically make a 3 egg omelette w/ 1 T sugar added to the beaten eggs), and a few generous dollops of Ming Tsai's wasabi oil instead of the wasabi/water/oil combo suggested here(recipe can be found on foodtv.com. Make sure to not to overcook the rice w/ too much water, though, otherwise you'll end up with a disgusting, gummy mess. I also just spoon this rice onto nori squares and eat it like "lazy" maki. Delicious. I'm making it tomorrow night to serve alongside the pan-seared tuna w/ ginger, miso and cilantro sauce (recipe also on this site).

This is a great dish and something I would make again for sure! Easy, delicious and healthy - YUM!

I was delighted to find this recipe, as I am an avid sushi fan, and given the rave reviews, I thought it was a sure thing. But something went horribly wrong--the flavors did not blend well at all and the salad turned out pretty much unpalatable. I'm sure the dish can be made to taste wonderful (given the comments), but it certainly doesn't automatically turn out that way. Maybe I used bad quality vinegar or wasabi?

This is a fantastically refreshing sushi-rice salad. I added some grated pickled red ginger as garnish which added some nice color and flavor to the dish. Tried it adding pieces of cooked small shrimp as well. All turned out great.

Really tasty. Agree with other reviewers. Also made a great lunch the next day - the moistened rice kept very well. I put a dish of shredded nori on the table to keep adding while enjoying this dish. Try with some good cold sake.

I really liked this one. I'm a sushi fan so this was a no-brainer. I've already made this dish 3 times and each time I missed at least one of the ingredients. It's still good. I love sesame seeds so I throw a few extra on top for presentation. It's a hit!

I have not made this, but I'm curious if anyone has also tried the "California Roll Salad" from epicurious, and if so, which one do you think is best (The Calif. roll salad recipe is fantastic.)

I prepared this salad exactly as per recipe and it was marvellous. I've made it several times and enjoy it most in the summer time accompanied by salmon or chicken teryaki prepared on the grill.

I paired this with salmon teriyaki. Feels like a nice dinner out at the sushi bar. The leftovers kept well for a couple days (minus the avocado and nori). I made the extra nori into cones and filled with the rice layered with leftover salmon and avocado for another meal.

I have made this countless times and it is always wonderful. Paired with broiled salmon, you will be transported!! I always leave out the oil and shiso leaves, but otherwise follow to a tee with the addition of making sure the rice soaks for at least 30 minutes.

What a surprisingly delicious salad! I was a bit sceptical, but being a sushi lover I decide to try it out. It was absolutely wonderful! And, my boyfriend loved it! He is also a sushi fan, but regarded the salad with caution at first. But after his first bite, there was no stopping him! I omitted the scallions, and used more dressing and nori per serving as called for in the recipe. Short grain sushi rice is a must!

I served this with sashimi grade tuna. It was good and pretty quick. Would also be good with some crab or some salmon teriyaki, with maybe a seaweed salad to get a solid dose of greens.

I served this with the pan-seared tuna with ginger-shiitake cream sauce and braised baby bok choy (both epicurious). It was great for a party - done completely in advance, wonderful flavors, nice complement to the meal.

I made it one time for dinner. My husband loved it!!!! I then made it again for a potluck at work. Very easy to make ane then to travel with. Cut up the avacado right before serving. Everyone enjoyed it.

This was so yummy! I made it 36 hours in advance, added the nori & avocado just before serving and stood back as my husband and 4 dinner guests raved :-) I also took the soaking advice (about 45 min) of the NY cook and simmered the rice only 2 min. 100% worth the investment in sushi rice, wasabi, pickled ginger, etc--will make this over and over.

Rating: 3
Absolutely addictive. I had the ingredients around the house and was looking for something to make to round out an inpromtu barbecue. I left out the avocado (didn't have it), used a Japanese cucumber in place of the English style cuke (no need to seed it), used pre-julienned carrots from Trader Joe's (a kitchen staple that gives everything color) and didn't use the shiso leaves for presentation. Also, I mixed the whole thing up in a bowl -- forget the layering. The result is not only delicious but visually lovely with a mix of greens, oranges, pinks and whites. Would be an excellent salad for pot lucks or buffets!

Rating: 3
very refreshing and easy; I was able to have great results without a rice maker. I happened to have some leftover chicken that had been cooked with soy, ginger and cumin, which I added to make a complete meal. Next time, I'd love to try it with tuna.

I really enjoyed this dish! I made it as an accompaniment to the Asian-flavored Seared Tuna, also found on this site, and they were both delicious. My thanks to the cook from New York who recommended that you soak the rice for at least half an hour and then follow the exact directions in the recipe. My rice came out beautifully - even without a rice cooker.

Refreshing and wonderful flavors. I have already made it twice, using brown rice each time. I think it serves six or even eight rather than four, though; if one has a small household, one may want to adjust accordingly.

Incredibly delicious, and very easy to prepare. This salad makes the perfect lunch for a steamy summer day!

I really like this recipe but I do have to share a rice cooking secret with everyone (I'm Japanese so this is legit). Soak the rice in the water for a minimum of 30 minutes up to an hour before cooking. Until I learned this, I was always having rice disasters - which for a Japanese person is the most face-losing situation ever. Follow the recipe as directed and remember if the rice is a teeny tiny bit firm after cooking, its okay as this will allow it to absorb the vinegar solution better and will continue to cook anyway.

Rating: 4
This was simple and delicious. A great way to have sushi rolls without too much fuss. I servered it on romaine lettuce leaves and with tuna sashimi. I think it lends itself to many other interpretations. Some fresh crab or shrimp on top comes to mind. I can't wait to make it again

Rating: 4
I made this dish with plebian ingredients: regular rice, regular cucumber, no shiso leaves or nori. Nevertheless, it turned out superbly! I used a rice cooker as other reviewers recommended. This dish is great for summer when you don't want to heat the house up.

This salad was fair, however, not as good as the California Roll Salad recipe on this site. Surimi (mock crab) is called for in the other recipe & is the crowning touch. Try it - it's perhaps my favorite salad ever.

I made this as directed, except for 1/2 tablespoon dark sesame oil for part of the oil (more authentic Asian flavor). We loved it. Ate it with chopsticks from large shallow black bowls. It was fun to eat and a real taste treat.

Yes, the pickled ginger is the pink stuff. It does come in jars. Probably can find it in an Asian market

This recipe is great. .!!! I've forwarded to many of my culinary friends. I'm eating right now as I type. ... it's a fun and meditative dish to make. I suggest eating it with a bowl of miso soup. Also, treat yourself and be generous with the nori strips, avocado and toasted sesame seeds. It gives it more vibrancy. ..And, yes, do pay attention to the instructions about the sushi rice. . the technique in making the rice is the essence of getting this recipe just right. .. enjoy!!!!!

I haven't tried this yet, but I just wanted to mention that you can buy a powered sushi rice mix at any Japanese market (it comes in a yellow pouch) instead of making the sushi mix from scratch. Also, fold the mix (either one) into the rice in a wooden bowl (as the wood will absorb the extra moisture) using a flat paddle - do not stir or use an other motion that may break the rice.

Rating: 2
This salad is almost exactly the same as the California Roll Salad here. The only difference is the use of Sushi rice as opposed to long grain rice and the option of adding Surimi (mock crab). I prefer the California Roll Salad although the rice preparation seems easier in this one. Also substitute 1/2 the oil with some Asian Sesame Oil for a more authentic flavor. You can buy sesame seeds that are already toasted as a shortcut if you wish.

I LOVED this salad! I've made it twice already. Definitely, definitely use a rice cooker. Thicker rice helps absorb the vinegar better. This recipe is easy and sooo good. Excellent on a summer evening.

Rating: 0
Easiest thing is using rice cooker! If not, bring rice and water to boil, then reduce heat to medium for 5-6 min, then reduce to simmer for 10-12 min. Remove from heat, let it stand for 10 min. It's important to stir from the bottom after 10 min of standing time. If you don't do that, the rice becomes gooey. And you never remove the lid whole time you cook rice.

Rating: 0
I disagree with the cook who says that they did leave out the zero. You simmer the rice for two minutes, then you remove from the heat and let stand for 10 minutes without lifting the lid! This allows the rice to absorb the water and plump up properly... there is no need to simmer the rice for 20 minutes. I took a class in sushi prep and this is the exact way we prepared the rice. You'll have a big nasty gluey mess if you simmer this rice for 20 minutes.

Rating: 0
Yes, the zero was left out, you do cook sushi rice for 20 minutes or so, definitely not 2 minutes.

If you like the taste of sushi flavored rice this is for you. I have made this 3 times now for my wife and I and it has become a favorite. I added some some fresh crab meat one time and it was like a California Roll in a dish. I also tried boiled shrimp and it was equally good. It is a nice make ahead dish although I would recommend not adding the avocado until just before serving because it will get brown. The same goes for the shredded Nori(seaweed). It gets soggy if you add it a long time before serving. If you have a Japanese food market in your area you can buy a jar of thinly sliced Nori will you can just sprinkle on at the last minute. Also, don't eliminate the toasted sesame seeds. they give it a nice flavor.
