I made this with all (in season) nectarines and it was really good! I also tried the cream cheese part with Bailey's instead of amaretto and that was pretty tasty too. I added some sliced almonds on the top for a bit of crunch.

There's at least one poor review noting the how bad this tart tasted and the expense of fruit "this time of year". This particular review was written in the dead of winter, when fruit is not in season. Available, for a price, but not in season. When you use what's local and tasty this dish can't fail. Words of advice for any recipe: buy local, save some money on transportation fees, get a better product and spare the planet some greenhouse gasses. Your tastebuds, wallet and fellow earthlings will thank you.

Culinary humiliation! I made this for a dinner party last night and not one person liked it. Everyone thought the alcohol taste was overwhelming, and the only good thing anyone had to say was that at least it looked pretty. Needless to say, the leftovers went in the trash--a serious waste considering the price of fruit this time of year. The consistency was fine and it was certainly easy to make, but I won't be trying this one again.

I made this for company last night, using only blueberrries and raspberries (and reduced fat cream cheese). We all agreed it was fabulous. I'm making it again to bring to a dinner party tonight, and trying it with Splenda. If that works, next I'll try fat free cream cheese.

My son is allergic to dairy, so I tried this with soy cream cheese. It was fantastic! I also used lemon extract instead of almond and upped both extracts to 1 1/2 tsp. I omitted the amaretto, and think it still tasted great.

This was one of the worst desserts I have ever made, and I am a real dessert person. This should be called cream cheese on a crust. I should have known that a no bake cheesecake was too good to be true, and it was. It was just like biting into a block of Philly cream cheese...never again!

Per another readers suggestion, i used sugarcookie dough for the crust. It was really good! It had a thick layer of crust, and I doubled the filling amount. It was plenty. 1 1/2 the recipe for the filling would be perfect. I used blueberries in the middle, and rasp. around that. It looked wonderful!

This is a wonderful dessert that looks beautiful and tastes even better. I doubled the filling and didn't need as much fruit as was called for. I used an orange marmalade sparingly combined with the Amaretto. I'll make this again and again.

EXCELLENT. Nectarines were out of season- so made it with all berries (raspberries, strawberries and blueberries) for a baby shower. HUGE hit. I will be making it again and again.

This tart looked so good we took pictures of it!! I made a gingersnap crust...because that was what I had on hand. For the cheesecake, I subbed Grand Manier for the amaretto and left out the almond extract...'cause that was what I had on hand. For fruit, I used raspberries, kiwi, Fuyu persimmon, black plum, and peach...just happened to have them on hand. Man!! was this good.

A very good and versatile recipe. I used a sugar cookie dough for the crust but I think next time I'll make it with gingersnap cookies for that little bit of bite you get from the ginger. I also took other reviewers advice and doubled the filling but kept the amaretto to only 2 tablespoons.

A favorite dessert. Easy to make and lovely. The recipe as written is terrific. I have varied the type of preserves for the glaze with great results (don't like apricot), and have used many different types of fruit as well. I've also varied the liqueur (amaretto, Grand Marnier, blackberry brandy, etc.). Mmmmmmmm. I now always use light cream cheese, and have never had a problem with the crust getting soggy on my pre-baked Ready Crust. A full 15 minute pre-baking is critical -- the crust should end up beyond "light brown" but before "whoa, too brown!" ;-)

Terrific and simple to make. Results were beautiful with use of fruit options. I used low fat cream cheese and did not notice a difference with the added liqueur and extracts. Since I was not serving until next day I added an egg white wash to the crust and baked a few minutes extra so I would not have a soggy crust.

This is a great recipe. Very easy and a wonderful presentation. I used a purchased graham cracker crust, but next time I will do a crumb crust from biscotti or vanilla wafers. The glaze on top makes this look great. Made this a second time for a larger group, tripled the recipe, made my own graham cracker crust, and used a 9" springform pan. Came out great!

Excellent! I prefer to make desserts with all from-scratch ingredients, so I used a shortbread crust (Good Housekeeping's "Baking" book, pg. 210) and it was lovely. My only other modifications are to make extra cream cheese filling and to decrease the amaretto a bit. ANY kind of fruit will work on this tart. Most recently I did blackberries, kiwi, nectarines and raspberries and it was gorgeous and delicious. Try this recipe - you're bound to like it!

This was easy, quick and it looked and tasted great. I made it once for family. I then doubled the filling portion of the recipe when I made it for a dinner party. I certainly suggest doubling the filling. This recipe recieved raves from everyone.

A flaky pie crust tends to get moist when it sits with refrigerated cream filling. Instead of using ready made pie crust per the recipe, I substituted a more interesting Coconut Sweet Tart Crust from the Pie & Pastry Bible. A similar result could be had by using some Pillsbury refrigerated sugar cookie dough for the crust if you are in the mood for ready-made. Press it into a tart pan using a layer of plastic wrap between your hands the dough. After baking, I moisture-proofed the crust by cooling for 2 minutes and then brushing with 1/2 beaten egg white and then popping the crust back in the oven for 1 minute to dry the egg white. Lots of folks thought it too pretty eat, but it disappeared in a snap!

This was so easy and delicious! It's almost no-fail. I used only 2 tbs. of amaretto and substituted 1 tbs. orange juice concentrate in the filling. For the topping I used only strawberries and glazed with marmalade instead of apricot preserves because I had some in the fridge. Was beautiful and yummy!

I have made this recipe every single year for at least the past 5 or 6 years (I've lost count) for my daughter's birthday. She will be 12 next week and has once again requested her birthday 'cake' be a fruit tart! I do leave out the amaretto, using only the almond extract for the children. She and all her friends just love this recipe! Of course, adults love it just as much too!! One other thing I have done in the past to 'dress it up' a bit was to melt some really good chocolate and drizzle it over the finished product in a kind of swirled design. Looks really pretty. If we have a large party of kids I make it on a large cookie sheet, just doubling the recipe.........of course it's rectangular rather than round then, but still just as pretty.

I made this for a birthday party at work, and was fully convinced that I would end up taking a good half of it home, for my husband and I to eat...Every last crumb was gone, and I was asked for the recipe! I made some variations - I used the strawberry topped lime mousse tart recipe for the crust, and then topped the tart with blackberries, and a raspberry jam glaze. I also used grand marnier and about three tablespoons more sugar, and only the vanilla ( I don't like almond extract)in the filling. Next time I may use less Grand Marnier.

This tart comes out beautifully! I'd always admired them in bakeries thinking it would be hard to make one, but it is SO simple. I made a sub for the amaretto, using almond extract, vanilla extract, and lemon juice (in both the filling and glaze). Everyone loved it!

I, too, made this recipe for the Fourth of July, and it got rave reviews from my guests. I substituted raspberry-flavored liqueur for the Amaretto and seedless raspberry jam for the apricot preserves, then used raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries on top. It was equally beautiful and delicious!

Excellent and easy. I'm not fond of amaretto, though, so I left it entirely out of the cheesecake part, then used citrus vodka to make the glaze. It sounds scary, but it was great, fruity and not too pungent.

Delicious and Beautiful. I made this recipe for the 4th of July with Blueberries, wild raspberries and strawberries. The combination of amaretto and raspberries is wonderful. The only change I would make would be to use raspberry or strawberry preserves in place of the apricot.

This tart was delicious! My supermarket didn't sell an all-ready pie crust, so I used pate brisee instead. Also, I didn't have any amaretto on hand, so I subsituted 1/2 tsp. each of vanilla and almond extract for the cream filling, and the same for the glaze - it turned out beautifully!!!

This was so simple! I do not like almond extract - it has too strong of a taste so I made quite a few changes. I eliminated the almond extract and alcohol and substitued 2 tablespoons sour cream into the cream cheese mix. i used blueberries and strawberries for the top and instead of apricot preserves, I used melted rasberry jelly (seedless) - it turned out great and looked like I had put so much work into it.

I made this for our memorial day cook-out. It looked beautiful (I used blueberries, kiwi fruit and strawberries). However, I thought the cheesecake part tasted rather strongly of amaretto. There was too much for my liking anyway. I think when I make this again, I might try using half the amaretto.

Beautiful dish! Excellent for bridal and baby showers! I substituted flavored coffee syrup for the alcohol. It was sensational!

This is an easy, no-fail, tastes great, looks 'continental' confection. I am a caterer and I have used this on many occasions; looks very nice when done in an oblong, rectangular tart pan. Am trying it this weekend with little phyllo cups.

Not only is this recipe easy to prepare but it looks and tastes elegant and rich. It received rave reviews from my diners. An excellent summer dessert. I made one with strawberries, blueberries and grapes, and one with peaches/blueberries. You could also change the flavor substituting diiferent types of liqueur. I used Grand Marnier.
