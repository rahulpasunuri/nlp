I doubled the tomatoes and garlic and am glad I did. Wow, this is good. And so simple.

This has become a family favourite. Even the teenager who doesn't like tomatoes eats this up. I use the sea bass whenever I can get it, but any white fish is good.

Wow, super good and easy too!! If using skinless bass, I'd recommend only 1 thin slice of lemon under each piece.

Absolutely our favorite preparation for fish. Have only experimented with halibut but it did not mesh as well with the sauce. Usually use Chilean sea bass. When in So Cal we buy very inexpensive Mexican sea bass with excellent results. We also double the sauce and serve some with angel hair. Will try with risotto that someone suggested.

Excellent dish. I used some extremey fresh scamp and sliced romas (it is winter after all). Parchment is not difficult, but I did place the fish in parchment on a sheet of aluminum foil which I folded in to reinforce the parchment wrappings at the corners. Parchment makes a much nicer presentation. This will go on our regular rotation, but I will probably play with some blanched leeks and carrots next time around.

This is delicious and definitely guest worthy. Can also be done with halibut. Served over lemongrass infused rice.

I've made this recipe a number of times, and its amazingly flexible. I've used it for tilapia and salmon as well as bass and basically included whatever fresh herbs look best at the farmers market. Its a great go to for fish!

Perfect! I did en entire filet and cooked it 16 min. in convection. It was guest worthy.

Nice solid dinner or weekend lunch dish. Would serve this for company without hesitation. Used Barramundi rather than Sea Bass but o/w followed recipe. Fish was perfectly cooked and tomatoe/caper "sauce" was just delicious. Usually I think Epicurious way underestimates prep times but this one was spot on. Next time I think I will throw just a bit of couscous into the pouch to soak up the juice. For a meal which is start to finish in 30min or less this would be tough to beat.

My husband loved this dish and is still raving about it 3 days later! I love the easy prep and the beautiful presentation is! Made it with Chilean Sea Bass which had been previously frozen and it turned out very moist. Also used dried thyme instead of fresh and added a little dried basil - can't wait to make this again!

SO delicious! I increased the lemon slices, thyme, garlic and tomatoes 50%. I'm wondering if anyone has tried it with a different fish? hard to find black sea bass...

Made this with tilapia and really enjoyed it! I suggest using as thick a filet as possible - the thickest parts were startlingly good. As others have said, it's also easy, cheap, fast, tasty and healthy - I was raised to believe that's impossible, but this dish is magical that way.

It's about time I write up a proper review for this dish. After making this initially for a dinner party with friends years ago, I realized the ease of attaining the wow factor while exerting little effort (I promise there's a beauty to being culinarily nonchalant). I've made this dish repeatedly as written, as well as with just slight variations. I've changed the fish, used olives rather than capers, orange slices rather than lemon, etc. The most important piece to take away from this recipe is the moistness imparted to the final fish product by cooking it in a packet. Really wonderful stuff here...

Very nice. Next time will add a little minced onion to the tomato mixture.

We LOVE this recipe - it is delicious, easy, and healthy, not to mention beautiful. I usually use tilapia, and everyone I've served it to has raved about how good it is.

Very good, very easy....I added Kalamata olives and threw the pouch on the grill for about 12 to 15 minutes. Will definitely make it again. Maybe add some rosemary in lieu of the thyme.

Rating: 4
This was a really good recipe! I doubled the tomato mixture and was glad I did. My piece of fish turned sideways and laid on the lemon while cooking and got a little too much lemon. Make sure the lemon slices are under the skin. I also wrapped them individually in the parchment pouches instead of the foil.

sea bass is gooood. we used baby heirloom tomatoes, extra capers, and extra thyme (fresh from the farmer's market). This recipe is relatively easy to make, and I'm sure the fish quality is muy importante. Will definitely make this one again.

Amazing! Made this for guests exactly as written and its the best fish I've ever made. Everyone loved it. It's like BUTTER!

We made a big mistake, we bought a whole striped sea bass at costco, bones and all! It was impossible to get nice clean fillets because the back bone was so thick - NEVER again. What was we did salvage was very good but looked 'ragged'. I doubled the topping ingredients as suggested and much needed. Good overall flavor and quite simple if you buy the right fish in the first place.

Outstanding. Made for a dinner party and added dry cured olives. Will make this again ang again. Moist and flavorful.

Just finished making. Tripled the garlic, thyme and tomato and served with risotto. Absolutely fantastic. Nice buttery finish complimented by the risotto (finished with fresh parm).

This was good, but nothing special. OK for a weeknight dinner, but not something I would make for guests.

I have not made this but would like to try it. Has anyone tried it with a whole fish (not fillet)? Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Very nice, light taste that didn't take away from the fish. I also used this with blues that we caught, as well - which came out very good w/ a touch of butter. I didn't have fresh thyme @ the time (ha), so I put a little chopped scallion in for taste - I think I will also add some red pepper flakes on the bottom with the lemon for some extra zing that I feel it needed, since I like zing...

Wild striped bass was featured at our local Whole Foods this weekend and we settled on this recipe. It was easy to prepare and cook. We halved the fish, but used the full recipe for tomatoes, capers and garlic and found the proportions good. Wonderful blend of flavors. It would also be good for fish loving dinner guests.

Serve with roasted asparagus and "Golden Beet and Sunflower Salad" (Gourmet July 2004). "Warm Rhubarb Compote with Walnut-Coconut Crunch" (Bon Appetit April 2008) for desert. Very seasonal and fresh flavors for the whole meal.

Simple, easy, and delicious. You can substitute roughly chopped canned tomatoes for cherry tomatoes.

Truly an easy recipe, but I find if I'm not careful with the dosage (which I often am not) the fish ends up tasting like iced tea - bitter (too much garlic) and lemony. beurk. When done right, however, it's excellent.

Absolutely delish.. made with whole sea bass, but think it will work with any fish. Very easy and simple to prepare and was certainly tasty! Will make again and again I am sure.

An excellent dish--quick and delicious. I placed the fish in a small casserole dish & covered it with foil instead of making a pouch. I doubled the tomatoes & capers and served it over rice.

A recently lapsed vegetarian, this was my first time cooking bass. I was a little worried when it was in the oven because it smells kind of fishy, but it was really wonderful. The package keeps it really moist. I doubled the lemon, garlic, tomatoes, and capers and would recommend it.

Though this dish looked beautiful on the plate, it tasted very bland. I thought that the garlic and other spices would give the fish more flavor, but we were disappointed. I won't make this again.

very easy to prepare, looks fancy, tastes delicious! I am thrilled to have found this recipe because after working a long day at the hospital, it is sometimes hard to cook something that tastes good and is healthy, and to do so quickly. Will definitely make again.

I used Tilapia (no sea bass available) and it turned out delicious. It also makes a really pretty presentation. I served it with a saffron rice and asparagus. Would definitely make again.

I am curious as to what other types of fish would be suggested. Somehow I don't think catfish will cut it but here in my section of the south it will probably be culturally acceptable! It sounds delicious but I am assuming tilapia won't work either. THANKS Y"ALL!!!!

I used Spanish Mackrel and a very discerning friend said 'restaurant quality dish'. So simple but the balance of flavors is perfect. I added a few extra tomoatoes to add more color to the presentation.

To the smartass in Toronto: I don't usually end out emails liekt his, but perhaps the cook in Dallas purchsed the sustainably farmed chilean seabass from Whole foods. If not, mea culpa and you are right to bash the aforementioned Dallas Chef. Long live the Chilean Sea Bass

This is my first review though I use this site constantly for recipes. This was worthy of commenting on and was absolutely terrific and effortless. I used Chilean Sea Bass w/o skin and doubled the garlic, grape tomatoes and capers. Yum! Yum! One tip: whatever the fish, make sure the thickness is consistent for all pieces.
