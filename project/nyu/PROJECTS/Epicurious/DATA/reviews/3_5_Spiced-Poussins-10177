Extremely easy and absolutely delicious! Marinate early in the day and dinner is a breeze. I may try putting them on the grill (indirect heat) with smokey mesquite or applewood chips. I divided the recipe just to make one, but 12 seems just as easy. Makes me want to throw a party.

One of my favorite chicken dishes even if it were called spiced chicken butt. Works for so many menus especially with grilled eggplant. Easy yet impressive.

Being a French Canadian I find the idea of spiced poussins simply awful. I know that Americans are fond of everything that has a genuine-sounding French name but this one is horrible. A dish called Poussins would be like saying Pig Chops or Cow Loaf. There must be a culinary way to name that dish without the butchery sound...

4 years after I first rated it at 4 forks, I'm still using this recipe. My mother asked me for it and uses it, her best friend uses it, I've passed it on countless times. If you omit or reduce the cayenne, even four year olds might eat it (ok, without the skin). It's ideal for buffet parties and when you aren't going to grill outdoors but want good picnic chicken.
