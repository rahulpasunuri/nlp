Have failed making ice cream sandwiches until now, these cookies worked wonderfully! I used epicurious's cherry goat cheese ice cream recipe instead (one of my personal favorites). Will definitely make this again, except I'll try pouring all of the batter into a pan and then cutting into squares, making portion control easier.

Made this with purchased mint choc. chip or black raspberry ice cream. Tasted fantastic. I used my larger (2tbs?) cookie scoop for this, and got 32 cookies, but would make even smaller next time. They were a big hit!

I've made ice cream sandwiches before using basic cookie recipes and purchased ice cream. The advantage of making these cookies is that they're very cakey and designed to still be soft and a little chewy even when they're frozen. I was initially suspicious of the batter because it wasn't thick like cookie batter usually is, but the cookies came out perfectly. The recipe calls for eight sandwhiches but they're pretty massive. Next time, I'd make them smaller since people seemed overwhelmed by the size of the things. I've been cutting the leftovers in half and slowly eating them myself! Note: I didn't make the ice cream, just purchased Breyers raspberry chocolate chip. I'd definitely make this again and have put this recipe in my box.

Wow! I ended up making two batches of the cookies. they are like a great brownie. Cooked perfectly in my convection oven at 335 for about 12 minutes. I filled one batch with store bought strawberry ice cream and one with Mint chocolate chip. Hugh sandwiches. Enough to cut into...but who really wants to do that?

Made this for the 4of July and people devoured the sandwiches. I made kahula ice cream and filled the cookies with it. My family did not like the cookie portion frozen so I took them out before assemblying and the end result was delicious. Definitely made them smaller as they were quite rich and filling. Worth the time and effort required.

The cookies were delicious, but I think there are easier chocolate cookie recipes. You have to watch them very carefully and not let them bake too long. They were so fragile that they did not hold up well even after being frozen.

I cannot believe I forgot to rate this recipe, it was so wonderful, I've made it twice since. The cookies were rich and chocolatey and the ice cream was fabulous. My guests raved!

Did anyone else actually make the ice cream? I did, and it was just so-so. Kind of icy...maybe I did something wrong. The flavor of the strawberry was not strong enough to stand up to the rich chocolate of the cookie. Also, not nearly enough to fill all of the cookies. The cookies, although really good, were WAY too big. I didn't end up with as many as the recipe called for and ended up cutting all of the sandwiches in half because it was too much for one sitting.

Can easily assermble entire sandwiches a week ahead of time. Underbake cookies to get the best results. We also reduced cookie size and used an intensely fruity premium raspberry ice cream from Mora in Bellevue, WA.

Excellent-- I've made this several times and it is always a hit. I add alcohol to the ice cream so it stays soft and we can eat them right out of the freezer without waiting for them to soften.

Thanks to the cook from Evanston IL..this does sound like the cookie I am looking for and will give it a try. Meanwhile, I must say that these ice cream sandwich cookies were to die for. The cookie is absolutely delicious on its own...and with Edy's Real Strawberry ice cream they were wonderful. The strawberries were just tart enough with all the sweet chocolate. I think that is the secret..you need a flavor that is more than just sweet with this cookie. I will try it next time with the mint chip as that is my husband's fave. Also..although I got only one less cookie than the recipe called for...it was VERY large. I cut them in half for the kids, and even some adults had a hard time finishing one after dinner. I made a note to try measuring them out with my smallest ice cream scoop the next time for a little smaller portion per person. Seconds are available..and I did discover they are just as good (well wrapped) after 2 weeks in the freezer.

I agree with previous review- excellent make-ahead dessert. Next time I would make the cookies much smaller. I followed the recipe, but ended up with cookies the size of my hand. I also did half with strawberry ice cream and half with mint chocolate chip ice cream. My guests seemed to prefer the mint choc chip ones. I used store bought ice cream to save time. I don't think it made a difference, as the cookies are the stars of this recipe!

Outstanding dessert! I made them for a party with Haagen Daaz vanilla for those that didn't care for strawberry and they were a big hit. Extremely rich, though, and half a sandwich was all anyone could eat. I made some with strawberry for us at home and that was definitely the winner. Strawberry cut the richness of the chocolate. I'll make these again, but about 1/2 the size. These are a great make ahead dessert.

Well, my husband said the cookies were great. But they didn't flatten out as much as I would have liked. They were a little too small. Excellent Fudge like flavor and a fun summertime dessert! I'm not sure how I would make them a little flatter next time? Any ideas?

In response to the question from kapm from Louisa, VA... This may be the crinkle cookie recipe you're looking for. My sister-in-law turned me on to these. Chocolate Pixies (crinkle cookies) 1/4 c butter 4 sq unsweetened (bakers)chocolate 2 c flour 2 c sugar 4 eggs 2 t baking powder 1/2 t salt 1/2 c nuts Powdered sugar Melt butter and chocolate. Cool. Combine mixture with eggs and sugar. Add 1 c flour, salt and baking powder. Mix well. Add remaining flour and stir in nuts. Refrigerate dough until firm. Roll into balls, roll in powdered sugar. Bake on greased cookie sheets 12-15 min at 350 degrees.

YUM!!! YUM!!! YUM!!! The cookies were WONDERFUL! If you're chocolate lover (I am) you'll be in heaven! The cookies are nice & moist with a great combination of chocolate flavors. The pairing with the strawberry ice cream is wonderful! The points about the size of the cookies are well taken. This is a VERY rich dessert -- several times I had to re-wrap the ice cream sandwich & come back to it later. Also, like another person here, I used a high quality store-bought ice cream (Blue Bell).

A question, since you guys obviously love cookies too...while I wait for my second sheet to come out of the oven..the first looks great!..Do you know where there would be a recipe for what I only know a chocolate crinkle cookies? They look a lot like these but from the addition of (I think) powdered sugar before baking the 'crinkles' look powdered. Thanks for any help you can give me.

Thanks for the size advice...I just read that as I was waiting for the choc to cool. I had measured my ice cream scoop...it was 1/4 cup...so I shorted it a little to scoop out the batter..but even at that I only got 15 cookies...one to try straight-up I guess. Next time I will try try using my smallest scoop...it's easy to add batter to each cookie.

Great!!! My new standard cookie. I microwave the 10oz. chocolate to melt them. Quicker and fewer pans.

These cookies were delicious & easy. I would recommend not using a 1/4 scoop to make the cookies however. Using one caused the cookies to be WAY too big and didn't make the 16 cookies expected. I only got 12. Slightly smaller would be more managable for dessert & would make the full 16. Didn't make the ice cream - who has time where there is Haagan Daaz?
