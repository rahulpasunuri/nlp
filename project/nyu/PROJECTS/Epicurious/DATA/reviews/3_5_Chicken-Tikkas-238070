Made this for a party last night and it was a big hit! I agree with the other reviewers that Greek yogurt is needed. It's thick enough to cling to the chicken on the grill, carrying all the flavor of the marinade. I grilled the chicken pieces individually, piled them on a serving platter (I tripled the recipe) surrounding a dish of the cilantro mint "chutney" (more of a sauce than a chutney, but very tasty), with a shot glass full of toothpicks in the middle of that. Easier for standing guests to eat than a whole skewer.

I followed this recipe to a T, except for the fact that we do not use any salt in our diet...It was great! the chicken is moist, the flavors are wonderful (Make sure the chicken marinates for at least 4 hours, as suggested by reviewers)the only problem I had was that I forgot to spray the grill(also suggested by reviewers) until halfway through the grilling and the chicken stuck like glue. Made the cilantro mint chutney which my husband said was too sweet? will make adjustments next time. This is a new addition to our summer grilling menu selection. yum

A Cook From Atlanta got it right...if you don't marinate for long enough, the flavor just gets lost!

This was a great dinner, served w/ garlic naan, tsatziki, dolmas, olives & feta all from the olive bar at the grocery, along w/ couscous & cucumber; great & super easy meal. Kids were split as to whether they liked the chicken (1 yes, 1 'a little', 1 'no, too sour'). Used the garam substitute from the link below. Will definitely use this again, even for entertaining...

In case anyone else is interested, I found a recipe for a substitute for garam masala... http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080222121715AAwUnpZ I'll review after dinner!

Perfection, i cut into bites, broiled for a few minutes and set out with toothpicks for people to pick. so good im planning on making whole chicken breasts on the bone for NYE dinner party.

Must marinate all day or over night.Also the Greek yogurt is essential. Doing those things makes this dish out standing. Both times I cooked it on a grill indoors. First made it for my book club and loved it so much I made it for my husband. He loves it too.

Delicious. Make sure you don't overcook the chicken. When done correctly the chicken nearly dissolves in one's mouth. I'll be making this one again and again!

i thought this was rather tasteless and was disappointed because i just love the complex flavors of indian food.

We did this one using a cut up chicken rather than skewers. The results were excellent.

I made these for a recent party (using almost all epicurious recipes!). They were gobbled up quickly. I marinated all day long. Had a little problem with them sticking to my grill pan, and was told my heat wasn't high enough. I made a simple dipping sauce with Greek yogurt, cilantro, lime, salt and pepper.

Used chicken breast fillets instead of thighs. Quick, easy, delicious! Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious! I let it marinate overnight so the flavor really set into the chicken.

Easy and tasty and nice variety. I served it with Roasted Curried Cauiflower, also from Epicurious, which really rounded out the meal.

Loved it! It takes almost no effort and is very tasty! It has become a grilling staple for us.

My husband and I enjoyed this for a weeknight main dish. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of the thighs. Used 1 t. of garam masala and 1/2 t. dried ground ginger instead of fresh.

This is SO good for the amt of work. made it in a grill pan with less chicken for 2 for dinner and could have eaten a lot more!

Great! It won raves, and it was easy to make. Wouldn't recommend the cilantro mint chutney though.

This is a summertime grilling staple for us (I'm American, DH is Indian). However, we use tikka masala instead of garam masala, and serve with chaat masala and lime wedges to sprinkle on to taste. New Delhi street food at its finest!
