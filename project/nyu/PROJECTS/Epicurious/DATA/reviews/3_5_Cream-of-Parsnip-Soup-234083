A table pleaser! I used low salt chicken broth, dropped the added salt and used salted butter to saute. I also used apple cider vinegar, balsmic style, and increased the quantity to 2 tablespoons. the reciepe makes a fairly thick soup so I added a further 1 cup of broth after just before I added the light cream. . .

I used salted butter but left out the salt the recipe called for. Be sure to use a good quality chicken stock if you don't make your own (Pacific is excellent) as most commercial ones have way too much salt in them. I used a little less half and half, maybe half a cup. Every single person that has eaten this has requested the recipe and several have given it to their friends as well.

I loved the flavor of this soup but thought it was a little thin. I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of parsnips from my CSA but I think next time I'll leave off some of the chicken stock. I didn't add any extra salt, going on some reviews of it being too salty and thought the seasoning was great as is. Complex flavors with the wine, shallots and balsamic, very tasty.

I made some adjustments to the recipe and it still turned out delicious. I only had 2 cups of parsnips, so I added 1 cup of carrots and 1/2 cup of potato. I used regular sodium chicken broth, so I put in no salt, 4 cups broth and 1 cup water. I also added a tiny splash of sherry with the half and half. The soup turned out very elegant, tasted great, and I would say is a bit flexible as long as you are careful with the salt.

One of the best parsnip soup recipes I've tried. I made it with 2 chicken stock cubes and didn't add any salt. Great depth of flavor. Will definitely make it regularly.

I thought this soup was great, even without the dairy. About the salt... I didn't measure any salt, just salted the broth after a quick taste. And I did have about a cup and a half of homemade stock I had in the fridge. A tip from America's Test Kitchen: make a solid chicken stock by browning chicken parts before stewing--makes a really rich, chickeny stock.

Absolutely wonderful - superb smell -I recommend making it early to enjoy. When I joined my fall/winter CSA the biggest surprise was the taste of parsnips. Who knew?? This recipe is super - you can also throw in aging carrots, squash and sweet potatoes. As an aside NEVER mash potatoes without a parsnip or two.

This was disappointing. Disturbingly salty.

Interested in finding some alternative dishes as my sister is on an elimination diet, I tried this soup and used rice milk instead of the half and half. I was delicious and had a beautiful consistancy after using the immersion blender. I froze half the batch and it still tasted like fresh parsnips and nice and creamy after being defrosted. This is definately a keeper.

I replaced the half and half with sour supreme (vegan version of sour cream) and used veggie broth for a vegan alternative and it turned out very well!

EEek! I had guests over yesterday and asked them to guess what kind of soup it was.Two people answered "Salt Soup"? Several people did not eat more than one sip.It was a disaster.Don't know what caused it,the broth,the salt or the white basalimic but it was a mess.

I had such high hopes for this soup!I proudly served it to my guests and asked them to guess what kind of soup it was and two of them said "Is ia SALT soup"?The soup did not have the lovely sweet taste of a parsnip instead one is reminded of creamy salty flavorless soup.What a disappointment

Super simple, super yummy. Lends itself to all kinds of variations but sweet and rich as is. Doesn't suffer from using rice vinegar and fat-free half-n-half. Probably could use skim milk as well.

Just made this tonight with dinner. We all loved it. Definately a keeper.

Does anyone know how this freezes? I know sometimes parsnips go spongy in the freezer.

This soup is excellent just as written. The only thing extra that I did was cut some parsnip matchstick size and roast them in the oven for garnish.

I love parsnips and consider them mis represented and underrated. I love seeing creative recipes for them what else can you do with parsnips?

I made this exactly according to the recipe. I happen to love parsnips and I think this is delicious as is. Next time I will try it with milk to make it even lower in calories and see how it is. I suspect the creaminess of the parsnips will be enough.
