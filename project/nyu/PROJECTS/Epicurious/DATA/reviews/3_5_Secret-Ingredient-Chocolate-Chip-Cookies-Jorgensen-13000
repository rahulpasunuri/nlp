I did not personally sample these, but everyone that ate them loved them.. I was worried that they weren't sweet enough, so i made a quick glaze of conf. sugar, vanilla ext and water and drizzled them with it. Will def make again...

i used 3/4 brown sugar and 1/2 granulated sugar by mistake, but the cookies turn out fine. it is a bit too sweet to my taste...but my boyfriend LOVES them. will make them again to keep him happy. :) p.s. i had never baked anything before this...so if i can bake it...anyone could!

I just made these and they came out great. I did notice that the pan used made a BIG difference. I made one batch with one of those doubble layer air pans and one with a regular old fashioned cookie tray. Hands down the cookie trays cookies were doubble the thickness then the other pan. I hope this helps out.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed, and it turned out exactly as it was supposed to I think. The cookies were thick and chewy with a crisp outside, however they were nearly tasteless. The Nestle added no flavour at all. If one wants a chocholate base it is much more effective to add pure unsweetend cocoa powder. I will not make this recipe again.

Help! My only substitution in this recipe was salted butter for unsalted, and i am left with a rubbermaid container full of flat brown pancakes. Although greasy they taste ok, but i wanted soft, chewy and cakey. I don't know how much salt is in a stick of butter so instead of adding 1/2 tsp I gave it a few dashes with a salt shaker. Who am I going to feed these to? Times like these I wish I had a teenage boy to skulk around and eat all of this stuff.

Mmmmmm, cookies. These were easy to make - I had my 10 year old son and my 3 year old daughter help me (OK, so maybe The Girl didn't help so much). We didn;t have any Quick, but I used hot cocoa mix and increased it from 1/4c to 1/3c (based on past reviews) and there are yummy. Crisp on the outside soft inside and almost gone!! Enjoy, JB

I used a bit more Quik for flavor and instead of mini chocolate chips, I used a bar of Giardelli's Bittersweet chocolate. I chopped it up into small pieces. This made the cookies not quite as sweet or rich. I also added some walnuts for crunch/texture purposes. A silpat did great for the cookies---highly recommend the silpat for baking these cookies. It made a pretty good batch, so the cookies left at the end were put in the freezer for a hour or so, I added a scoop of slightly softened vanilla ice cream to the underside of one cookie and sandwiched the ice cream with another cookie for a bit of a different treat!

Baked these cookies many years ago and this is the best cookie recipe I had baked so far. Chewy and moist.Next time, I think of adding some dried fruits like cranberries. A good play of flavors and texture.

i really enjoyed these cookies. i read other reviews saying that they were flat, but they did not turn out flat for me. they were light, fluffy and just chewy enough. i did use quick oats and a bit of extra butter. good cookies!

This recipe was good... I would HIGHLY recommend grinding the oatmeal to a powder before using-- same great flavor, but a much better texture. I agree with another user that these cookies were much flatter than most. I could tell from the extremely buttery and moist dough that they would be... I almost added more flour, but I decided against it. Also, ten minutes of baking time was PLENTY in my oven. These had a great flavor, and because of that, I think I can get over the "flatness." I would certainly make these again. NOTE: This made about 45 fairly large cookies...

I really looked forward to these cookies, being a Quik fan and all, but the color--yecccch. The Quik results in a blah, drab color. Given all the great ingredients, I expected them to taste better.

Instead of using the Secret Ingredient, I substituted equal parts Dutch process cocoa and granulated sugar, which came out quite well. I also used steel-cut oats instead of old-fashioned, but the oats ended up as hard little nodules that took forever to chew. I think quick-cooking oats would have been preferable. This is more or less the Tollhouse cookie recipe with cocoa and oats for flavoring.

Adding chocolate milk powder to the recipe didn't really do much for them, it just made them soft (I prefer my cookies crisp and chewy). There are much better chocolate chip cookie recipes on this site.

This recipe is a great twist on your typical chocolate chip cookies. I highly recommend you give it a try! (FYI They did take about 15-16 minutes to bake for me)

We have made these cookies three weeks in a row! I find that the cookies tend to dry out so I put a piece of fresh bread in the cookie container to keep them moist. They also freeze well...a winning recipe.

I thought these cookies were wonderful. They were not dry nor did I find the batter to be hard to mix. The Nestle's is the key so I wouldn't substitute it for any other kind of mix.

To FIRST TIMER from PASADENA -- You ask if leaving out 1/2 cup butter would make the cookies cakey and dry? Yes, of course. You mention that you added water. Doing this changed the texture and chemistry of the batter. You say that you substituted Nestle's Quick with Hershey's Cocoa. Well, Nestle's is sweetened and Hershey's is not. In addition to being dry little bricks, your cookies must have been bitter. Are you having fun with us? I think you are. You gave me a chuckle. :)

This was not happiness! First, the dough mixture was too thick. I had to add water. It was a very messy and time-consuming process. My beaters got "stuck" because of the thickness. The cookies themselves were too cakey and too dry. Whether this was due to all that flour, I don't know. I only had one stick of butter (instead of two), could that have made a difference? Lastly, I didn't care for the dark look due to the cocoa (I didn't have Nestle's Quik and used Hershey's Cocoa instead). I added nuts, by the way. In conclusion, these cookies were a disappointment...I will try other recipes, but not this one again.

The whole family loved these cookies! My husband was leary of the recipe initially because he's not a big fan of oatmeal, and my mom wasn't very interested because she normally does not like chocolate chip cookies. They both loved them though! These cookies are very moist, and I found that the secret to them not being too sweet was to simply cut down on the amount of choc. chips added. I added approx. 6 oz. instead of 12.

The recipe isn't written well but it's a good one. I took someone's advice and used vanilla chips instead of chocolate--it breaks up the heavy chocolate flavor a bit.

We live on a farm, and I took these cookies out to the guys in the field. They loved them! I tripled the recipe (first time I made them), and two days later they are gone! I put less margerine and a little less sugar then the recipe suggests.

I served these cookies at a luncheon and everyone loved them because they aren't your typical chocolate cookies. A second time I made these, I substituted vanilla chips- excellen.

I thought that the recipe was too sweet. My five year old didn't enjoy them either. I did like that they were chewy. They just weren't the best I've ever tasted.

Wait a minute, let me get this straight...your kids are so picky that you have trouble getting them to try a new type of chocolate chip cookie???

These cookies were great! I made them for a party and soon they were gone! The Quik wasn't easy to taste, though, so I'll probably add more next time, and I agree with Karin about adding nuts. This one's a keeper!

My son, Brook, doesn't like chocolate chips, so I omitted them in half the batch and he loved them. So do the rest of us (with chips). I recommend that you reduce the butter to 3/4 cup and only bake them for 10 min. on parchment paper. What a neat cookie! I'm adding it to my tried and true's!!

Delicious! Even my 8 yr. old picky eater loved them!

This recipe is a Keeper. I made these particularly rich by substituting Nestle's Cocoa for Nestle's Quik Powder, and using regular size chocolate chips. Next time, I'd like to add some nuts.

Great cookies! I love the way the chocolate powder makes them look darker...they don't look underdone, so you can make then a bit chewy if you want to. My kids loved them, and they usually don't like anything new!

Great cookie and fabulous taste. My kids loved it but I would add more flour next time as they were a bit too flat.

These cookies are great & easy to make. I would use less sugar and make to use mini-chocolate chips not the regular size because these cookies are rich!

The oatmeal and the chocolate milk mix provide an interesting twist to the traditional chocolate chip cookie. They were very good. My kids loved them and I was lucky to even touch one.

I had a boyfriend whose mother made these most outstanding, chewy cookies. I used to crave them but never knew what made her choc. chip cookies so unique. When I made these, they tasted JUST like hers!! I was psyched to stumble upon the recipe. I like my cookies sweet and chewy, I add 1/8 c. more flour and 1/8 c. less sugar - Perfect!

sounded good with the secret ingredient, but I was disappointed. pretty sweet. varied a bit from the regular choc. chip cookies, but not enough to get the "break from tradition" I was shooting for. it was alright, but there's better.
