How can broccoli rabe be tender in just 5 minutes? This is a very good, basic recipe but increase cooking time to 20 minutes, then test every 5 minutes thereafter for tenderness.

This is so simple, fast, healthy, attractive & tasty! I cut down on the olive oil to save on fat; & I "steamed" the broccoli in microwave instead of steaming(I was at our cabin in Penn.; lack of utensils, but do have small micro.) It's good leftover, barely re-heated, so as not to make it limp. All adults loved it, haven't tried it on a kid yet....it's kind of bitter, & spicy w/red pepper flakes.
