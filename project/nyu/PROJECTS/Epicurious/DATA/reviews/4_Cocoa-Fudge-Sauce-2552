This sauce is delicious! It's nicely dark and definitely not too sweet.

We loved this fudge sauce! Not too sweet, brown sugar gave it a bit more depth. We used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and it still thickened up beautfully. Added 2t.Vanilla and doubled the salt (we used flaked sea salt) A big thumbs UP!
