Excellent change of pace for green beans. I made the recipe as written substituting only a white onion for the red. Perhaps I"ll try the parmesean cheese sometime but it was really quite good without it so no real need for the extra salt and fat.

If only I could rate this 5 forks!! It is a winner with a few changes. I also added toasted pine nuts and parmesean shavings. But the biggest change I made was to use the small french beans, and shallots instead of the red onion...HUGE difference and made the dish very elegant. Would not hesitate to serve at ANY party

This very good. And a nice change of salad. I made the day before, brought to room temp & served over mesclun. I also added some toasted pinenuts & shaved parmesan.

this is my new favorite recipe for green beans. It is so easy yet so flavorful. It was equally as good without the olives (although I prefer it with the olives).

I thought it was good, but you need to serve in a shallow dish so it's easy to get the onions and olives. I agree with previous reviewer, better the second day.

i thought this was very good, but it was better later (the next day), after the beans had absorbed more of the vinegar dressing. if i make it again, i would do so far in advance (if not an entire day).
