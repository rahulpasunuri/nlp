You can't go wrong with this recipe. Lovely light gougères are easy to make. Great to have coming out of the oven as guests arrive. Will make these many times over because they were a huge success in that they disappeared as quickly as they were set on the table!

These are great! Every time I serve them, everyone loves them. I also made them ahead and froze them. While I think they are best the first time out of the over, they are impressively good after freezing and reheating. I think only I could tell the difference because I had both. My guests are none the wiser. As for the people with flat disked results, I wonder if the gougeres are properly piped onto the baking sheet. They should be about the same size and shape as one might expect when they are done baking, just slightly puffier.

My guests were none the wiser. As for the people with the flat results, I wonder if their gougeres were piped properly on the baking sheet. When piping, they should be fairly close in size and shape to the end result, only slightly puffier.

I thought these wre just OK. Other people at the party I served them at raved, but they were a bit dull to me.

These are easy, delicious and impressive! I made a few small changes the second time I made them. Used fontina instead of asiago Used non stick cookie sheet instead of parchment paper Sprinkled with gruyere only - no thyme I also made the dough the night before and they were still fabulous the next day!

These are so beautiful and delicious and easy to make. I make the dough, put it in a large pastry bag and then keep the pastry bag in the fridge. That way you can pre make the dough and pop them in the oven right before you need them. I've even kept the dough in the fridge for 2 days and they still bake up picture perfect every time. A keeper. GReat for dinner with soup as well.

I just came across this recipe today and decided to make it since I had the ingredients. These are amazing. So simple to make, providing a great quantity for a party with a great taste. As I was taking them out of the oven my son's friend came over so he was the first to try. He is 16 and he said excellent and ask if he could have more. That in it's self says a lot. I will be making these for New Years Eve. Thank You.

Delicious and extremely quick and easy to make. Perfect for a wine party. I'll bet that different cheeses and flavorings could be substituted without any problem, too.

Amazing. I used gouda instead of gruyere and they flew out of the bowl at our last party!

These gougeres are out of the world, fluffy, crispy clouds of cheese. I also upped the cayenne and found it to give just the right touch of heat as an endnote. The second I brought these out at the party, they were devoured.

These are easy and super tasty. One recommendation though. If you're planning on freezing them, freeze them BEFORE you cook them. Lay them out on a sheet pan like you would if you were going to bake them, and pop them into the freezer. After about an hour, they'll be frozen and you can put them into a Ziploc freezer bag. Just add a few minutes onto the cooking time.

Followed the recipe to the letter and they turned out exactly like the photo. Perfect holiday party hors d'oeuvres.

Just made a second batch, increased salt and cayenne each to 1 full teaspoon. at my husband suggestion, several good-sized dashes of Tabasco, as well. The finished product sings in your mouth! Whoops, also used 1 Tbls. fresh Thyme as neither of us could detect it before.

These little puffs of joy were easy to prepare and bake. My only suggestion is to increase the Cayenne to 1/4 teas. and the salt to 1/2 teas. I added a little more than the pinch of each called for in the recipe and will add more next time. I used mild cheddar and asiago, but next time with use parmesan for it distinctively sharper flavor.

Made these for brunch this weekend and everyone asked where I bought them. These are great to make ahead. Followed previous reviewers advice from Julia but did the whole thing in a pot on the stove without dragging out the mixer. Followed Dorie Greenspan's advice and froze them unbaked on a parchment lined cookie sheet. Baked them then next day at 425 for 15 minutes and they were perfect.

I beat the eggs together,added them 1/4 cup at a time, and baked just one tray at a time. Ended up with 58 total - all perfectly puffed and delicious!

I thought these were rather bland and lot of mess between the cooking pot, mixer, piping bag and pans.

I made these for a dinner party on the weekend and they were outstanding! The recipe states you can prepare them ahead of time, which is what I did, reheating them in the oven just as guests arrived. They looked perfect, and the flavour was divine! I will definitely make this again!

I've made gougers countless times. Using this recipe, and Julie Child's egg tips noted by another reviewer, I made 3 separate batches for a catered wedding. Seasoning combinations are endless. All were raved about. To puff, the eggs must be added to a cooled mixture (the mixer helps cool the dough a bit) & they should be baked right away. More than 1 pan at a time can lead to discs; not puffs as I've learned the hard way.

I made these exactly as written and they puffed up perfectly. I wonder if altitude of other cooks may be causing the "flattening" problem.

Made these last night for a dinner party with family and they were a huge hit. These are delicious! I halved the recipe because I didn't need 55 of them, but now wish I'd gone ahead and made them and put them in the freezer. Such a great go-to recipe for holidays too. So pretty and delicious and all-in-all, very easy.

Flat as a pancake and super tasty. I think there may be something to the Julia method suggested. I'll try that method next time. In the meantime, I have a batch on parchment which is turning out flat and a batch baking as popovers.

Made these exactly as the recipe says.They puffed up beautifully and tasted amazing.Wish more recipes said if they could be frozen.

This was delicious. Mine turned out flatter than the pic. As far as process goes, I'd forgo the parchment and use a nonstick baking sheet.

Ok, I consulted Julia Child's cookbook about how to make these. She specifies *exactly* 1 cup of eggs, pre-beaten, and added in 1/4 cup at a time. She also specifies to cook at 425 for 15 minutes until brown. Another tip is to whip them and quickly get them onto the baking sheets while the dough is still warm. I used all these tips and this time they came out perfect! Thank you, Julia!

I made a 1/2 batch... please help me. They tasted great but they came out like little latkes not puffs. Did I not beat the batter enough? I did use Jarlsberg instead of Gruyere but that should be ok, right?

I made the suggested substitution in the recipe and used cheddar and parmesan, since that is always in our pantry. They tasted of the best part of a grilled cheese, where the cheese oozes out of the side of the bread and gets a little crispy...Mmm...Hubby and I ate four each in one sitting, then froze the rest to keep us from nibbling all night!

This was my 1st attempt at gougeres. They are a delicate texture and flavor but will be nice light hors d'ouevres with cocktails. I froze half - nice to have them in reserve.
