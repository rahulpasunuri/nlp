This is not chilaquiles. Period. Here is a summary of the basic method according to Rick Bayless, the god of Mexican cooking in the United States: In a very large heavy pan, brown some chopped white onion well in some oil. Add salsa and chicken broth. Bring to a rolling boil. Turn off heat. Stir in tortilla chips and shredded cheese, making sure the chips are submerged. Top with shredded chicken, cover, and let stand for 3-4 minutes. Stir gently, top with crema, chopped onion, grated queso anejo, and cilantro and serve. For the complete recipe, see: http://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/vie w?recipeID=64

These little guys are pretty good. My stove shot up about a foot with flame for a moment, guess I really need to learn my burners better, but overall things went well. :D They taste great, and the softness of the tortillas is nice compared to regular chip-based nachos.

Ummmm, sorry folks. These ar not chilaquiles. These are nachos. Chilaquiles involve tortilla chips cooked in salsa. At best this a poor attempt at an American version of a Mexican dish.

Oh dont DRIZZLE the sauce... heat the sauce and add your tortilla chips and mix.....

Instead of frying the tortillas, just buy a really good brand of Tortilla Chips.... so it keeps some of the crunch... and use "El Pato" red sauce... with some Queso Chihuahua...... You will definately see the difference.....

How disappointing! While this sounds tasty, I agree with those who say it's not chilaquiles. People rely on this site -- you can do better.

These are not chilaquiles. Chilaquiles are always cooked in a sauce so that they become a bit mushy and a bit crisp. These are nachos. Just call them what they are.

1 star isn't low enough. Lots of work for a big mess and little taste. Stick to chips and salsa

I served these at my health club's solstice gathering and everyone found them quite delicious. I omitted cilantro, however, because it's arbitrary aura makes the herb quite unstable and thus unsuitable to combine with any food.

I served this as an appetizer at a dinner party, and everyone loved it. Next time I'll try it as a main course. Very easy to make, and very tasty.

Chilaquiles is a breakfast item which consists of day old tortillas in green or red salsa, topped with either chicken, fried egg (or both) and cheese.
