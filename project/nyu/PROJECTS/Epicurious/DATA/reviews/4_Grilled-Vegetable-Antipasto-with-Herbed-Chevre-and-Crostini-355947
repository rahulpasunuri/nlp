I made this for my boyfriends cousins on a recent Saturday night and it was a big hit. The goat cheese was fun and easy to make and my favorite part was that I got to choose what herbs were used (I don't like the taste of parlsley). I grilled my veggies on an in-door griddle because we are in an apartment and they came out great as well. I skipped the vinaigrette simply because I ran out of time, but will try that next time. I decided to add asparagus ( which came out great) in addition to what was recommended and next time I will include carrots as well. The flavors all complemented one another, and I especially enjoyed the sundried tomatoes which went very well with the flavor of the goat cheese. The only hard part for me was grilling in doors. I had to do the veggies in batches because i only had so much space and I had to watch them. If I had an outdoor grill and could have left (all) the veggies on the grill, closed the top and walk away for a couple minutes it would have been a breeze. My in door griddle really added cooking time. Overall, i loved this recipe. My guests loved it and we're very impressed!

Wow! I wanted to keep this simple and debated just grilling the veggies and serving them up. At the last minute, I decided to make the crostini and vinagrette. It was sooooo good. Great combination with the chevre. Our dinner guests snapped them up leaving not enough for me! To my surprise, the onions were a big hit and we did not have enough of those. A great recipe a highly recommend and will make again -- tonight, in fact.

This was very popular at our backyard bbq party. I prepped the veggies and made the marinades and crostini the night before. I had my husband throw the veggies on the grill first thing and they were delicious! I didn't make my own herbed Chevre, because I was able to find that in the fine cheese department and it eliminated a step. The vegetables had lots of flavor, though I agree with the other reviewer that they were too big for the bread, but that was easy to fix. I will definitely make this again! It could easily have been enough for 20 people (I did use two baguettes).

Made this as an appetizer for 20. Makes a beautiful presentation . Only change would be to reduce width of the cut on the vegetables and cut on the diagonal after grilling so they fit on the crostini better. Everyone loved it.
