I subbed regular dijon, for the grainy type and I didn't have cream so I used skim milk and threw in a T. butter. It was fantastic!

I made this exactly as written except I increased the green peppercorns to 1 1/2 to 2 tsp and I crushed them with the back of a spoon after chopping. I used a wrought iron skillet and as I tented the finished steaks with foil I realized the recipe - as written - allows time for the steaks to rest and reaborb their juices - it's just not spelled out. I poured the au jus that was left on the steak plate into the finished sauce and gave it a swirl.Then I recalled the problems some reviewers had with getting the sauce to thicken. But really this is a steak sauce - not a gravy. The recipe reads "to coat the back of a spoon." If what you want is gravy stir some flour into the sauteed onions and peppercorns - creating a roux - which you then need to cook for a minute or two - before adding the liquid ingredients all at once and stirring until thick and bubbly. This was delicious. Fancy eating at home. I felt very satisfied at the outcome - which is not the case with other recipes I've tried that require the purchase of special ingredients. In fact, making this sauce as written and reviewing it has inspired me to review other recipes I've tried to make exactly as written from this website. My honey and I decided this was our Valentine's Day dinner. For sure it turned out better then any over priced pre-fixe meal we'll find in town.

This was one of the best sauces I've found. It's important to chop the peppercorns to get the flavor in the sauce. If you don't have the brined green peppercorns on hand, you can put some dried ones in a dish w/ some warm water, vinegar and salt to taste. Let them sit for a half hour and drain. I used it the sauce on elk tenderloins. A huge hit with everyone!

The whole-grain mustard overpowered the steak, both in flavor and texture. The flavor wasn't worth it. No one in my family liked this.

Very tasty. I agree with the reviewer who says "stick to the recipe", but having done this the first time I will try some variations in future such as increasing the amount of cream and brandy.

Excellent. I bumped up the quantity of peppercorns to 1 1/2 tsp, and probably will bump it up even more next time. Otherwise, I stuck with the recipe. Hubby went nuts - loved it!

I have been making this recipe since 1998. I love it because it is so versatile. I have followed the recipe without substitutions, and I have also substituted. Every time it has been a hit and all of my guests never fail to rave about it and they always ask for the recipe. Just got an email today from someone wanting it.

What is wrong with me....I'm the only reviewer who thought this was dull. I didn't add the peppercorns so maybe that was the problem. Will have to try again because no where near the great reviews I read!

Amazing and easy to make. This tastes like an au poivre steak sauce from a Franch restaurant. I messed up about half the directions, and it was still really impressive.

Close to the best pepper steak recipe and the ease of preparation would make this a 3.5 fork rating. This is a fool proof company pleaser.

Delicious and very easy to make. I opted to make the sauce ahead of time and then cooked the steaks right before we were ready to eat. It worked great and helped the sauce thicken a little more. Definitely recommend making this meal.

Fantastic sauce and so easy to make. When I ran out of the green peppercorns in brine, I just used the regular green peppercorns and found that I liked it better. Always a hit when I make it for guests--everyone is always impressed.

Easy and delish! Had the boyfriend practically licking the plate. We had it with egg noodles and steamed veg - good combo. I doubled the sauce for leftovers - yeah, right. :-) Used regular dijon (rather than whole-grain) and it seemed to work just as well.

Mmm MMM good. Had left-over sauce with eggs the next day.

This is a great, easy recipe. I served it for a small New Year's Eve gathering and everyone loved it. I was able to make the steaks and sauce a little before everyone arrived and then just heated it back up, so I was able to spend time and enjoy my guests.

I had 12 people for dinner and served this sauce with a whole beef tenderloin. We all loved it. I suggested they go to epicurious.com and get the recipe.

One of the best beef recipes of this site. Worked better for me with black peppercorns.

Good date recipe! Definitely creates an impression. Also - one prepares, the other cooks. Great meal, add a bottle or two of wine and prepare for the best. Maybe some Courvosier to top of the evening.

Simple, yet soooo delicious. Can usually find green peppercorns in brine at an international food/grocery store. Look in the Italian or Indian food section.

Imagine with all our forty shades of green I could not find green peppercorn's, used black.Very rich sauce all the family really enjoyed. Served with Roquette, fennel and parmesan salad, just right!

Just delicious! I couldn't find peppercorns in brine, so I took the tip from one of the other cooks and used capers. Also, I didn't have brandy so I used a good bourbon. I'm hungry for it again already!

I did not slice the steaks, I just poured the sause directly over them and served. One of best steak recipes I have made. Served with rice, asparagas, and toasted baguette with blue cheese melted on top. Delicious!!!

I didn't have any peppercorns in brine, so I used some drained capers instead. Did season steak with dried peppercorns and salt. Was delicious

The whipping cream was a great addition to the recipe as well as what my Fiancé does with the remaining cream. Definately made for a romantic evening meal.

This was one of the best meals I have ever prepared. I think about it often... I served it with wilted greens and a potato. It is a great special occasion meal. I did not slice the beef but served whole as Filets. I will make this again soon.

The four-fork rating is well-justified! Both my husband and I participated in preparing this dish and felt it was both simple and delicious. Even though we used dry green peppercorns, the flavor was excellent. Next time we will prepare it for guests.
