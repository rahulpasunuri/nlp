I had a root canal this holiday (boo!) and was looking for some comfort food that I didn't need to chew. :-) What a surprise! This is amazingly simple and delicious! I used high quality dark chocolate and it makes all the differernce in the world. My husband couldn't get enough. We are going to make the pudding as one of the desserts for a dinner party this weekend. You must try this recipe - you will not be disappointed.

This was my first time making this and I brought it to Seder for desert. One of my sister in laws LOVES chocolate pudding. The hosts thought nobody would want it besides her, and they were wrong! Everybody wanted some and people were raving about it. I used one of the suggestions about using coffee instead of the espresso powder and it worked beautifully. (Omit powder and use 1/3 cup of strong coffee and 1 2/3 cups of milk). I doubled the recipe with no problems. It took longer than 4 minutes to thicken and longer than two hours to chill and set. I think I'll use a little less coffee next time, I like enhancements to be a little more subltle... I think it would also be AMAZING using half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate and adding cardamom, I will try this variation very soon. So fast, easy, and inexpensive. Delicious!

Just the way pudding should be. Only used 2 tsp of espresso powder in the pudding, not too over powering the some had reviewed. Good thing Valentine's Day only comes once a year.

Excellent! Great flavor and nice smooth consistency.

This was good but not great. I think it was overkill on the espresso powder, I would like it to be more subtle. It was, however, very easy to make so maybe I'll make it again in a time pinch.

This was good. A little pedestrian. I would make it again though, for sheer ease of use. Kids loved it. It seemed a little heavy, and could have been a tad more chocolately. I am just more of a mousse person I guess.

i served this in 1950's china teacups.. was wonderful and rich and easy. i used plain whipped cream to counter the strong espresso flavor, and found it to be perfect. this was the first time i've ever made pudding from scratch, and if i did this without scorching or lumps, anyone can do it!

This is a delicious ten minute dessert. The whipped cream is a must! Pour into very small ramekins or bowls as it is very rich and a few tablespoons is enough for each person.

Made this with Callebaut dark chocolate chips - very rich and delicious pudding. FYI, pour quickly into serving bowls once chocolate chips are melted into the milk mixture, as the pudding will start to thicken very quickly. Also, the intense chocolatey flavor improved as the pudding cooled (while it was hot, tasted like Jell- O pudding, so I was prepared to be disappointed. Once cooled, however, very decadent and rich. Yum!)

This is incredibly easy and takes no more time than a "chocolate pudding mix", with much better results. I serve it in demi-tasse cups or miniature Irish Coffee glasses, topped with the whipped cream and a chocolate coffee bean.

Delicious. Because I didn't have any espresso powder, I used 1/3 cup strong coffee with 1 2/3 cup whole milk, instead. Very rich.

In a word: addictive. I have never fallen prey to chocolate pudding but this recipe had me licking the whisk and the spatula. This recipe almost didn't make it to our dinner guests. I put the whipped cream mix into my whipper and it turned out wonderfully, and my husband didn't mind adding the leftovers to his latte the next morning.
