I'd certainly make it again. This was quite a bit of trouble, and I think that 3 lemons would have been enough. I did not marinate overnight, only a couple of hours on the counter, but the results were very very good. I didn't use 2T of salt, just 1T. And I didn't scrape off the extra marinade.

Unexpectedly delishious is RIGHT! Hubby loved it, will make again I made mine with frozen lemon concentrate (since I didn't have any lemons, followed the recipe the same, next time REAL LEMONS, but still supurb!

This is a winner. I would never have made it but I was doing a challenge with friends and had to come up with something for ribs and something for lemon, so I combined the two by making this. It was a huge hit. Unexpectedly delicious. The only reason I haven't made it again is because it is so dang easy to buy some rub or BBQ sauce for ribs. And, separating the rind from the pith is a bit of a pain (especially if you're impatient and can't wait for the lemons to cool). But I will make this again some day when I have the time. I used Meyer lemons. Not sure if that was an improvement but it sure was tasty.

This recipe is the best drop dead way to make ribs. I'll never make them another way. I left the lemon pulp in the mix, otherwise I followed the directions exactly. I also made it with chicken adding peach marmalade. It also was lip-smacking great.

Very interesting and delicious change from chili-rubbed or BBQ sauce ribs. Took some work to make the confit, but worth it.

I hate to be the naysayer for this recipe, but I really didn't think it was very good--boring, even. I ended up making a citrus glaze to save them.

Great rib recipe. Very flavorful (be sure to marinate overnight)...ribs were tender. Will make again

This is the best rib recipe ever. There are none better.

I made the marinade exactly as directed but since I was making Lamb ribs I had to change the cooking instructions. I baked them in the oven for a little over an hour in foil to make them tender and then threw them on the grill for a bit of charring. It was delicious. Perfect with the lamb. I served with saffron, edamame cous cous, mediterranian tomato salad and date bars for dessert. I think we all had seconds!

I have made this recipe twice with no changes for two dinner gatherings, everyone has loved it, even my husband who is hard to please asked me to make it again.

My hubby and I loved this. Very unusual. Absolutely will make again. Be sure to grate the lemon rind before putting lemons in the microwave. I did not scrape off the marinade. it was delicious as is!
