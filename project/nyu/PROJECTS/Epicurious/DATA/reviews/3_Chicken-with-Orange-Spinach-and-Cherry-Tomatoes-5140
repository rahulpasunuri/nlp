I took the advice in previous reviewer and marinated the chicken with garlic, dill and orange juice for five hours. Also, added more tomatoes. This was delicious. My guests raved about it and was so simple to make while entertaining.

The chicken took substantially longer than 10 minutes to cook through--I had to put it back in the oven for at least another 10. Overall, it tasted too salty and the spinach was overly soggy. The tomatoes were good, though.

I put everything but the spinach in to a gallon-size bag and let it marinate for a couple of hours to give it more taste (to address comments that it was bland). My only issue was that the chicken required more than 10 minutes to cook, but it came out nicely.

I've made it several times with leftover chicken (or rottiserie), a litte more orange juice (or Tang) added to the packets. Great recipe!

For a complete meal, I mixed equal amounts of instant rice and hot water in bowl, let it sit while I made other ingredients. Put this in middle of foil and put other ingredients on top as directed.

Too much work for the end result. It's just ok, nothing exciting.

it was fine, just didn't knock my socks off...I just sauted the ingredients in a pan rather then go through all the tin-foil trouble.

Great recipe if you are trying to make something quick and healthy! The flavor was a bit on the bland side though. However, my boyfriend ranted and raved about how fabulous this dish was and how I went all out! It was a plus that the dish tasted exactly the same when microwaved for lunch the next day. I'd recommend this recipe to anyone trying to follow a low fat, low cholestrol diet, if you are looking for something that'll knock you off your feet though, I'd go for something else.

Guests own a cafe & raved! Marinated meat in OJ. Generously salted, peppered, & fine-herbs, on tomatoes. Doubled garlic. Added orange pieces. Cooked 20 min. Drained extra juice. Served in foil. Guest late-no problem! Fabulous flavor!

Has anyone tried cooking this in one large foil packet instead of four? thanks.

Typed in "chicken spinach orange juice tomatoes", and this recipe came up. Here is my abbreviated version because of what I had on hand: thawed and squeezed dry a box of frozen chopped spinach, sliced my two already cooked chicken breasts, and finished off the rest of the dish with half of the remaining ingred. Then as suggested before I added a splash of OJ to both of the foil packets. Cooked for 15 mins. and it turned out perfect! Delicious and EASY!!! KIMBER

There are infinatly better things one can do with the ingrediants. This dish is bland and the foil packets are rediculous extra work with no real contribution to the recipe.

I thought this was an excellent dish. Definitely a "do over". Can it GET any heathier and better tasting?! Nope!

Very bland and not special at all - particularly when one considers the infinite alternatives. Plus, I didn't feel good about wasting all that aluminum foil.

I think this recipe is being given a hard time by the "bland" critics. I was so impressed with the delicious, healthy "sauce" that came out of the tomatoes. I added a squeeze of orange juice, which tasted fabulous. I would leave it in the oven for 20 minutes, however. After 10 minutes, my chicken was still pink.

I made this recipe twice just to be sure. It really was not anything special. Make it only if you really LOVE all the ingredients. It tastes exactly like you would expect orange and spinach to taste together! Include the sun- dried tomatoes as one reviewer said. There is a nice smell to it though. And it goes rather well with Rice Stroganoff.

Great and healthy! Will definately make it again.

An easy, healthy way to prepare chicken breast. The chicken was tasty and moist. A similair recipe I once prepared called for sun dried tomatoes, and I think I'll try this with sun dried tomatoes next time.

Substituted sliced fresh salmon filet for the chicken. Added fresh parsley to the tomatoes. After it was cooked, I drizzled just a touch of browned butter over the servings -- FANTASTIC!

A really terrific recipe. I've even made it for non-spinach lovers, and they've loved it. The combination of orange, dill, and tomato gives a fresh flavor to the dish.
