Perfection. Seriously. The only thing I change in this recipe is to double it, because this is so insanely good you will want to serve it to many people, even those who claim not to enjoy fennel.

I made this strictly by the recipe the first time and made a minor (but amazing) addition the second time. First, the fennel seeds were an innovative addition that added a different texture. The pork and fennel flavors really complemented each other. I thought the garlic was a little too much for the fennel (I can't believe I said that) so the second time I made it I cut back on garlic. Also I added grated reggiano parmesan to the fennel while it was roasting. This added some depth and creaminess to the sauce when I later added the pork.

The instructions in the recipe are excellent, and my pork came out perfectly (I have a tendency to overcook). The fennel was delicious and, despite the amount used, not licorice-y at all. My boyfriend was extremely skeptical because he was really petrified that we were going to be having licorice pork, but he cleaned his plate. I made a side of some angel hair pasta with a little butter and lemon. It was so good!

This is so much better than the time and effort it took to prepare, which is, for me, the definition of an ideal recipe. For context, I love fennel. I even eat it raw, so that's the lens through which the following ought be read. I first toasted the fennel seeds then ground them with a mortar and pestle. I also let the meat "sit" for about 45 mins at room temp with the seasoning applied. I only used one fennel bulb but it was a big one so there was even leftover wedges. The lemon is indeed key.. don't leave it out! And last, I reduced the sauce some, but not to the point where the liquid disappeared- it tasted too good to waste via evaporation and I couldn't see the lemon juice alone yielding enough sauce to drizzle on the medallions.

this is incredible! the first moist pork tenderloin I ever made. I had a 2 lb piece of meat with some fat still in it. I kept a close eye on it and it came out delicious. I did not use fennel seeds because husband does not like it. One bulb and one onion to soften up the fennel flavor. I will make it again and again!

Insanely Delicious! First time cooking with fennel, and loved it. Recognize the flavor, of course, just never used it before. Fennel goes great with the pork, was a nice, different way to make a roast. The sauce reduction at the end was great, cooking the fennel so long definitely removes the intensity. (I did a 4 lb roast for 2 hours). Will definitely make again!! Served with long grain brown rice as suggested by another, and creamed leeks. Great dinner!!

way too much fennel for me! i did like the juiciness of the pork so next time i may alter this for my taste--no fennel rub and combine some onions and fresh fennel to saute and bake the pork on. would not make again as written.

Rating: 4
this is one of my favorite recipes of all time. i usually serve it over white rice and i agree with others that it tastes even better the next day. i usually add double the fennel than called for, double the fresh fennel (by using large fennel bulbs), and double the garlic as well. i've tried it without the lemon juice and it's just as good. two thumbs up for this recipe. i'd give it 7 forks if i could!

Yummmmm........I made this as directed except more wine (I had a lot of scraping up to do) and at the end, where you're supposed to cook most of the liquid away, before stirring in lemon juice, I tasted the sauce and found it delicious. Instead of evaporating it I stirred in an entire bunch of swiss chard. The resulting greens plus fennel plus pork was divine, my idea of heaven. It was so rich I decided next time I could cut the butter in half. I would make this any day, for family or company. Simple and delectable.

I first made this dish in Nov. and we thought it fabulous. I made it again tonight and said that I must write a review. Both times after grinding roasted fennel seeds I mixed them with the salt and pepper which made for easier application on the pork (a 2 lb. boneless loin this time). Last time we determined that more fresh fennel was in order so I doubled what it called for.This is an incredible dish, easy to prepare and oh so good. Tonight I served it with the (Epicurious) sweet potato w/balsamic, pecans and dried cranberries and a small salad of argula, radicchio, fresh orange segments and a light viniagrette made with moscato vinegar and a bit of lemon juice.

Randomly had pork tenderloin and some fennel on hand... This dish was surprisingly good and very simple. Didn't have fennel seeds so used cumin, mustard and coriander. I think the cumin and coriander added a great taste, a little bite. Also, rather than reducing the liquid down at the end, we used it as a sauce. Will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious and so easy. This is worthy of company. Will definitely go into our list of favorites.

I actually am rating and reviewing the fennel portion of this recipe, as I used a different recipe for the pork part. I just cooked the fennel by itself in olive oil, then followed the roasting parts of the recipe minus the pork. By the time I took it out of the oven, it had a velvety consistency, and was sweet and delicious. It has been several months since I made it, but it was so good that I'm actually making it again for a Thanksgiving side dish! Making it a day early, so curious to see how it re-heats.

Having one very large fennel bulb from the Farmers' Market, and a tenderloin whose date said to use or freeze, I made this for our dinner tonight. OMG, I wanted to lick the plate. I can't imagine what the MI reader did, or didn't do, to have it come out with little taste. Although I read the recipe through a couple times, I neglected to add the liquids until after removing the meat from the oven. It didn't matter; just let it reduce on the cooktop. Taking the suggestion of adding the lemon juice at the very end, I went one step further and squeezed the juice over the meat/fennel and sauce on the plate. Believing that leftover fennel might not be so good as freshly prepared, we two ate the whole bulb with our meal. The remaining tenderloin will make a wonderful quick supper before Thanksgiving. This is definitely one to prepare again; simple to prepare and unbelievably full of flavor.

After seeing the rating on this recipe and reading one page of reviews, I decided to make this for a dinner party. I thought the recipe was good, but not great. The flavors were a little flat despite following the recipe without tweaking it. Perhaps I didn't use enough salt or lemon juice?

Really good and fairly quick, got rave reviews! I doubled he recipe and it didn't seem to make it take any longer.

AMAZING! I cook pork tenderloin often, and this is by far the best recipe I've found. I've made it exactly as written (fantastic) and have also used the basic preparation (sear, cook veggies, roast over chicken stock) with other ingredients equally successfully. The only change I might suggest is to increase the oven temperature slightly, or cook a bit longer.

Rating: 4
Really delicious and different preparation of pork tenderloin. I tossed in some chopped leeks with the fennel bulb for a subtle onion flavor but otherwise stuck to the recipe--which is unusual for me. I reduced the sauce a little more and was to die for. Squeeze of lemon is very important to round out the flavors.

Wonderful and easy! I didn't take into account the weight of my tenderloin, and as such had to weight longer than the recipe stated for my roast to finish. The flavors perfectly complimented each other, and were even more vivid the next day.

This made up into such an unexpected treat. What a great combo of the fennel seeds and the sauted/roasted fresh fennel with the pork. I love the sauce it made - so simple. This is my type of weekday meal - that is special enough to serve to guests. This will be put into the menu rotation.

Not like this needs another review, but... This recipe is delicious. I've made it several times, and while I generally don't really follow recipes, I stay pretty close on this one. Only change is to use a bit more fennel seed. Overall the flavor combination is somewhat subtle, but excellent and bright. Make sure to add the lemon juice at the end because otherwise it will lose its "pop".

I have made this several times. I usually make it for company. It is absolutely wonderful.

This is a family favorite!A wonderful bonus is it meets our needs for high protein/low carbohydrate meal options. A few changes: No need to grind/pound the fennel seeds, using "ground fennel" from the bottle works just fine. In addition we double the fennel and omit the butter. It's simply delish!

I'm one of those annoying people who changed a recipe a lot but still reviews it. Sorry, but I love the foundation for the sauce in this recipe! I didn't have fennel, but I had a lot of brussel sprouts and pancetta. So, I followed this recipe exactly, but put the pancetta in with the garlic before adding the brussel sprouts in place of the fennel. Then I followed the rest of the steps to the word...I promise. It was delicious. Served with egg noodles and roasted cauliflower. I would highly recommend this recipe with the fennel or brussel sprouts or both!

i needed to increase my cooking time, but that was the only adjustment i made, and the pork was incredibly moist ad flavorful. the fennel in its sauce was delicious and a perfect complement to the pork, but much richer and tangy-sweet than i was expecting. i think i will try making a fennel-apple-onion stuffing to roast along with the pork next time, to mellow the fennel flavor a bit while sticking to the same theme. but what a simple, beautiful recipe!

Wonderful and simple! Next time we will cook and serve with a better bottle of wine! The cooking time was off for us despite having slightly over one pound of pork. We needed an extra eight minutes of cooking but it remained remarkably moist. I will probably increase the temperature to 375.

Fabulous. We used more fennel seeds than the recipe called for and we always wish we used more fennel bulbs. When it's done those chunks of fennel are the best part. Best if made in a cast iron skillet.

Outstanding. I have made this recipe many times and it always turns out delicious. Last time I made substitutions based on what I had in my pantry. I used chopped fresh sage and rosemary instead of fennel seeds, and small yukon gold potatoes instead of fennel, and it was simply amazing. I use a digital meat thermometer that you leave in the meat while cooking and it alerts you when the meat is done. This is my favorite cooking tool... perfect, every time!

I have made this three times and have found it to be excellent; however, I have always had to increase the oven time on the pork (perhaps I'm not sauteing it at a high enough temperature). I do smash the garlic rather than mince it. We like it with orzo and carrots and green beans. This is definitely our best epicurious recipe to date.

This is the perfect weeknight dinner - not too many ingredients to buy, easy to make, and absolutely delicious. I added more wine than called for, substituted chicken stock, and used nearly half a head of garlic - I will use even more next time as the garlic really elevates the fennel. Served it with a dense, crusty Italian bread. Delicious!

This is "a keeper" and "awesome".. Sorry "Cook from New York" dated 3/6, it's the best description and we think you're a bit cranky scolding folks for word selection.What's that about? Okay, I add more garlic as well, and saute the fennel longer than directed. I also use ground fennel seed with the whole for more flavor. Be certain not to over cook the meat. 145 degrees is perfect!

Rating: 4
Have made this twice - delicious! The tenderloin tends to have a thin end and a wider end... just fold the thin end around (or tie with string) so that it cooks evenly. It's easier to do before you brown the pork, but it can be done after... have made this for guests and for a mid-week dinner. Rave reviews both times...

We loved this dish. Followed recipe almost to the letter other than using dry sherry (didn't have white wine) and it worked fine. I usually cook fennel bulbs cut only in half, but here I halved them then sliced them lengthwise. Also used bottled minced garlic. Before putting in oven, I sliced tenderloin lengthwise in half, and cooking time was still a little short. A little longer cooking wouldn't hurt fennel either. I agree that there wasn't quite enough sauce, so I added a little more chicken broth to stretch it out. Definitely a keeper!

145 degrees is too much; your pork will be dry at that temp. Stop at 135 to 140 and let it rest tented with foil for 10 to 15 minutes. That'll do ya.

My family loved this! I tweeked it a bit- I didn't have fennel seeds so I had to sprinkle with ground fennel seed. I also used smoked paprika along with the salt & pepper. I added a whole bulb's worth of garlic cloves with the fennel and a bit more each of the broth and wine to get more sauce. I added the butter to the sauce after roasting. I had to roast it another 8-10 min. as it was still very rare. I usually roast these at a higher temp. It came out perfect- nicely pink and juicy. the garlic & fennel were a perfect combo with the pork!

We were pleasantly surprised with this dish! Some of the fennel was still too tough, and I agree with the other reviewer that mentioned just to cook it until it's tender (translucent, really). The sauces POPS! We'll probably double the sauce next time b/c it didn't go far.

Second time making this - such a GREAT recipe! You MUST try this! Served it this time with egg noodles , fresh green beans, and mixed baby greens with lemon vinagrette.

The whole dish is SOOOO good!

oh ... so ... good! To make this a bit more "timeline friendly" for a dinner party I made the whole dish but pulled the pan from the oven when the pork was still very rare and put a lid on the skillet. When we were ready to eat I put the skillet back into the oven for 15 minutes or so to finish the cooking. I did add some extra broth & butter at the end to really make it saucy. Everyone loved it. But if you aren't a fennel fan - it may not be for you. will make again and again.

Sophisticated flavor with minimal effort . . .a terrific combination! I roasted 2 1-pound tenderloins, so slightly upped the other proportions. I found the cooking time to be perfect as written - at 17 minutes, the pork had reached 150 and was slightly rosy & juicy. Served as a weeknight dinner, and even the non-fennel lovers enjoyed it. My Italian husband rightly pointed out that it would make a fine dish for company.

This is really a lovely dish that is not very difficult to prepare. Marvelous flavors! My only suggestion is to cook the meat longer. It wasn't even close after 15 minutes. I left it in a while longer at 350, but it was pretty slow to cook through. Finally I ended up removing the rest of it and returning the meat to the oven, raising the temp to 425 and turning on the convection! But once it was cooked through, it really was great. Everyone loved it!

Very Flavorful! I added a bit more fennel seed to the rub and had to deglaze the pan with an extra half cup of wine and half cup of broth. I also chose to use a rhine wine because its flavor was a bit more punchy than my chardonay.

Excellent dish! My husband and I loved it, especially the tender fennel. Per bkeene12's review, I agree that you have to be careful with the garlic. If you literally smash whole or halved cloves, instead of putting it through a garlic press, it won't burn. I had to roast the pork five additional minutes (but I prefer only a small amount of pink in the middle).

Rating: 3
This one reached the fence. My wife loved it, claiming it was one of her favorites. I thought it was delicious- hence the 3 forks... probably closer to 3.5. Watch the pan, if you are not careful you can burn up your garlic and ruin the fond on the pan which will build a super sauce in the end. I served mine over some egg noodles which did great.
