I don't know what I did wrong but I had to throw this away. I made only minor changes (did not have almond flour or Grade B syrup) but this was just a mess. My flan never firmed up at all in the oven. Once chilled it was firm - kind of - but not the velvety texture it should have been. It was also far too sweet. The crust was no better. I was thankful I had also made a pumpkin pie so we were able to have a nice dessert on Thanksgiving. This one got tossed!

I was a little surprised after reading all the rave reviews... this flan was ok at best... the walnut crust was good however. I did find a great way to fix this dessert though... I followed someone else's comment about how great the BRAZILIAN STYLE FLAN member recipe was and made that flan with the walnut crust from this recipe... turned out MUCH better! Try it look under flan in member recipes (not epicurious recpipes).

I made this for a dinner club and never made flan before, I was unsure as to the results, so I made a back up dessert in case, but was pleasantly surprised at the presentation and how delicious it was! Everyone said it was a definite keeper!

We made this recipe for Thanksgiving and despite our modifications, it was delicious! Instead of almond flour, we used 2 cups regular flour mixed with ground almonds and walnuts. We also didn't have time to chill the flan before baking it, so we baked it right away and chilled it for 1 hour before serving. Amazingly everyone loved it and ate every bite!!

To the previous reviewer..I have a quiche pan with a removable bottom. They're just deeper than a tart pan, but same basic design.

Not a drop was left on anyone's plate! I can't wait to make it again! It was fabulous - and what a great presentation on the crust. I made this dessert to top off a Spanish-themed meal (great with Birthday Party Paella from epicurious site). I did bake flan about 30 minutes longer than recipe stated, though; it looked way too "jiggly." Also, instead of the walnut crust, I made an almond crust: Process 2/3 c flour, 1/3 c chopped almonds, 1/2 t salt. Add 5 T unsalted butter (Plugra's the best.) and process until crumbly, then gradually add 1 T ice water through feed tube, turning motor on and off 2-3 times until dough holds together. Gather dough and shape into a flat disk, wrap in plastic wrap and chill 30 minutes. Meanwhile preheat oven to 425. Butter 9-inch tart pan with removeable bottom (no problems; can't imagine using a quiche pan . . . how would you get it out?). Roll chilled dough to 11-inch circle, line pan, folding dough toward the inside. Prick bottom with a fork and line with foil, shiny side down. Fill with pie weights, and bake 15 minutes. Remove foil and sprinkle crust with 1 t sugar. Bake 4-8 minutes longer. Cool on rack to room temp.
