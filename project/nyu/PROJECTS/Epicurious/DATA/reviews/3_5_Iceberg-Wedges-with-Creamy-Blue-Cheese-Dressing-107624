Great and easy recipe. And for all those iceberg snobs out try this on for size. More sophisticated lettuces, baby greens, etc. are too light to take a creamy dressing and will wilt and taste like mush under blue cheese. Baby greens deserve light dressings, and crumble some blue cheese in there if you must. I don't eat iceberg every day but when I want blue cheese dressing, it is the only one that stays crispy under the weight of the dressing.

This recipe could not be easier, takes only minutes, and tastes delicious. I used Miracle Whip Lite and found it a bit too sweet for the dressing. Even though it was good anyway, next time I will use Hellman's. Don't shudder all of you who make your own mayo, please. Although I will try a few more recipes, this one is getting cut and pasted into my personal Word recipes files. Oh, and I used a small package of those blue cheese crumbles, a Greek brand like the ones you can buy in feta, for speed and was surprised that it was so good.

Just returned from Las Vegas where I had the most amazing variations of Wedge salads with bleu cheese dressing. ALL WITH ICEBERG. Some chopped, some shredded...ALL DELICIOUSLY REFRESHING. Iceberg and Bleu Cheese. A marriage of flavors....YUMMMMMM!

My husband loved the chunks of blue cheese and wedges. A comfort food harkening back to simpler days. Re first reviewer, why prepare a recipe with ingredients you detest? This tis one of our favorites.

Can all the food snobs just relax? My husband, after long periods of mesclun, baby spinach and leaf lettuce salads reserves his highest compliments for "honeymoon salad" (lettuce alone!)with bleu cheese dressing. His tastes do run more to the basics, but I like this for a change of pace as well as the lack of prep involved. The dressing recipe is a good place to start; add, subtract or substitute according to your tastes...it will still be better than store bought.

Only used recipe for the dressing; it's a very good, basic blue cheese dressing, and I'm sure I'll make it again the next time we're going to "splurge". I used the full container of blue cheese (6 oz.) rather than the recommended 4 oz. and it was perfect for our taste. I used a brand called "Buttermilk Blue Cheese" and it was very good. Concerning the iceberg lettuce debate: can't we all just get along? I normally buy leaf lettuces for their vitamin content, but iceberg is really refreshing sometimes.

I have made this at least once a week since it came out in the magazine in January. Friends always request it when they come over for dinner! I used a little less white wine vinegar, nixed the green onions, and added salt.

I have made this dressing a couple of times. I don't care for big chunks of bleu cheese so I prepare it in my food processor. I like the way all of the flavors blend when you do it this way. I have crumbled bleu cheese on top of the wedges as well as adding crumbled bacon. Mmmm.

I thought I never wanted to eat iceberg lettuce again till i saw these crunchy wedges with blue cheese. I really liked the dressing. I will use it for other salads as well.

We liked this tangy dressing, especially my husband. What a delightful throw-back! To scale it up a bit, serve the wedge on top of mixed baby salad greens. In my opinion, if you need to change this recipe a great deal, use another recipe or buy a bottle of dressing from the store.

I thought the buttermilk was overpowering. I added Dijon-style mustard, lemon juice and olive oil and it was much better. Next time I will leave out the buttermilk. Add sour cream and milk. My husband loves iceburg lettuce. We all should't be so snobbish about it! It used to be all we could get!

Hubby loved it. Tasted just like the salad he orders at his favorite steak house. Flavor is better the next day.

Dressing was very good, and the salad reminded me of one I used to get at (believe it or not) a Japanese restaurant where I lived. But do we need to revive the first reviewer? Or at least keep her out of supermarkets? Delicate sensibilities are so tough to deal with.

sniff. Yes--ICEBERG LETTUCE! Comfort food is back in--and this sure does conjure up memories of Mom & her kitchen! Like listenting to old Sinatra records. :)

ICEBERG lettuce?! ICEBERG?! The dressing was a good, basic blue cheese. Sorry,I know these iceberg wedge salads are in (for some strange reason) but to me it will always be the polyester of lettuces (much to my husband's chagrin.)
