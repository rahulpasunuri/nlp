Made it and it was very good. I also substituted shrimp as this isn't exactly crawfish country. Now if you want trout we're talking! My question though is for the cook from the south and from Atlanta. Where in the recipe does it imply that this is an Emeril recipe? Or do some people use any recipe from the south to bash Emeril?

OK, So I rewrote the recipe to make it outstanding. 1) Substituted tomatoes with approx, 2 & half cups of chardonnay. 2) Used a shrimp, scallop, calamari blend. 3) Added a chopped head of garlic to the onions & bell peppers. 4)skip the puff pastry : I like the one review of rice. Or else its great on its own.

It was pretty good, but not quite as flavorful as a true Louisiana Etouffee. I cheated a little and used already made pastry shells. Not a bad recipe at all.

Tastes nothing like the crawfish etouffee served by native New Orleanians. Should have known better than to try this recipe.

I could not find a etouffee recite so I used this one and used shrimp instead. I cut the shrimps up into 3 or 4 peices and it was amazing! Served with rice instead pastry shells.

Spices were wrong and the pastry puffs were not needed. I browned some brown and white rice in the butter then added the pepper, onion and fresh Hatch chilies. Cover the whole mess with a can of chopped tomatoes and cook, adding water as needed, until rice is done, then add either chicken chunks or shrimp. The bourbon touch seemed nice, I used white wine this time and it worked out well; must lubricate the chef for creativity!

Thought it was great, with a little work. Skip the pastry puff, added some bourbon, cheated by using shrimp and played with the spices. I made it for a group of over 200 at a tasting and got great reviews.

I also skipped the pastry thing. A great basic etoufee recipe to combine with basmati rice and it is so easy. Added crawfish at the very end. Be sure to do this just before serving so the crawfish don't get rubbery. Don't understand why others rated it so poorly.... I understand the distaste for Emerald, but wouldn't associate this recipe with him in any way.

Another horrible example of something Emeril Lagasse probably vomited into one of his 'cookbooks'. This was terrible

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! O.K. I fudged it a little. I was really lokking for a basic crawfish etouffee recipe. So I skipped the whole puff-pastry fiasco. And I replaced the 1/2 cup water with a 1/2 cup of fish stock (sold frozen at my local gourmet food store). Served over basmati rice (with the mesclun salad on the side), this was a DIVINE dinner! Rave reviews all around!

One word: Terrible. Was not worth the trouble. Cute presentation.
