I found this dish bland. I made it with the braised lamb shanks..overall the meal was a disaster. My husband is Italian, so he felt the polenta lacked taste..we make it with red sauce (Italian Gravy) and put it on a board with the sauce on top when we make it. This just tasted like it needed something to kick it up a bit.

This was yummy, yummy, yummy! I used organic cornmeal, and found that 5 1/2 cups of water was a bit much, I ended up skimming some water off. Used fresh, local sweet corn kernels cut off the cob instead of frozen. Used 5 slices of bacon, to make it a bit less bacon-y as I was serving it with meat as well. I used to hate polenta, but thought I'd give this a try and it's just incredible. Will certainly be one of our more popular dishes in the house.

Wonderful! I left out the whip cream because I wanted something more cheesy than creamy. And I used dried sage. And it was still excellent. The corn kernels gave it some sweetness and a nice texture. Served it with herbed pork chops. The polenta is a little more work than making pasta, but it's not too much work to make on a busy weeknight either. I'm going to be making this, or variations on it, as a regular thing from now on!

Best polenta recipe ever. I'm not a huge fan of the stuff, but how can you go wrong with these ingredients? I've given the recipe out to a dozen people at least.

Substituted proscutto for bacon and sauted other items in butter. Liked it better this way.

Delicious and easy. Wonderful flavor combination. Whole kernel corn adds nice texture contrast to the smooth polenta. Yum, yum!

This is tasty! I used quick polenta and a mix of feta and parm cheeses as a variation and it was great with steak. I skipped the corn kernels and used half water and half chicken stock. Also, I reserved the sage and sprinkled it over when I plated the polenta. Using a flat whisk is indispensable to keep it from sticking/burning.

I can't quite imagine how this recipe would work as written - my version was a definite 4 forks - and divine served with BLACK BEAN SOUP WITH LIME (see our version)as a sauce. We followed this recipe but used 4 cups of water to 1 cup of INSTANT Polenta (Dell'Alpe - in Italian section)This cuts the cooking time down to about 5 minutes. I also substitute half and half for the cream. I use a combination of Parmesan and Asiago cheese. Really good - Grand with the black bean soup "sauce".

Total comfort food! It was very good, even after I threw it in the oven to keep warm because my husband was late. I added a little extra broth to the dish and I think the oven help blend the flavors better. It's a bit bland for my taste, but it's easy and good for a weeknight.
