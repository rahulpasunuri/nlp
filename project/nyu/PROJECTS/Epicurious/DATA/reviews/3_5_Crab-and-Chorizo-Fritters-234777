I made this according to the recipe for a cocktail reception for the Dr's where I work. I watched for reactions when they took the first bite and it was pretty much a unanimous WOW. I will make this at home someday. Unfortunately I don't repeat items for the Docs very often. I may get some requests though and be forced into it. Do this recipe.

I made these fritters and they were delicious and perfectly spiced with no need for a sauce. I used fresh crab meat, but the grade right below lump. The flavors are so rich lump would get lost. These have been a huge hit every time I've made them. I'm making them again tomorrow night!

I used canned lump- crabmeat to good effect and made them bigger to serve as a main dish with tartare sauce. We also have a deep fat fryer so made them in that. We ended up with about 9 large burger size patties. Lots of batter to this dish, almost like you get with battered fish here, but of course completely different flavours. Be warned, they do grow considerably in the oil. I've no source for sofrito, so I minced a little onion, carrot and celery and mixed in some tomato paste and cayenne. Very good, but indeed very fatty with the batter and the frying. And the one I had for lunch today rewarmed and re-crisped nicely in the oven.

When they say to chop the chorizo 'fine' they mean it! This has the potential to be excellent but my laziness made my fritters have inconsistant bits of bite! I may try again, but I won't cut that corner.

I searved this at a Cinco De Mayo party last year and everyone loved them. As soon as they came out of the oil, my group was wolfing them down. Never made it to the serving plate. I just put a bowl of sour cream out as the dip and everyone raved. Absolutely delicious!

I made my own sofrito (used recipe from Epicurious), used canned lump crabmeat, and drained, cooked chorizo (not dry-cured). The fritters were fine, but unmemorable. They definitely needed some sort of dipping sauce as they were completely forgettable on their own.

YUM! A bit time consuming and messy to make (dealing with oil spatter) but a delicious appetizer. I made these for a Spanish Wine Tasting, preparing everything the day before and then reheated in the over prior to the event. Instead of the cilantro sauce, I served with the lemon paprika aioli recipe from this site. It had a lot of punch and was an excellent complement to the fritters. Next time I might used canned crab rather than spending the money of fresh lump. The crab, while a central role in this dish, is working with so many other flavors that canned crab might work just as well. I also didn't have dry cured chorizo so just sauteeed and drained the chorizo before added to the fritter dough.

Can anybody suggest a substitute for the sofrito? Harissa maybe?

I think its a good basis to play with, but I won't make it again as is. And with the comments of others, regarding the sauce-- they relied way too much on the sauce to add the zing vs eval the dish as it stands. The batter is a standard "cream puff" shell, and I rarely deep fry, so baked the dish. The dish should have relayed the flavors without adding the fat enhancement. I think just the basic ingredients, with a tiny bit of flour or flavored crumbs-- would pop. Use the best crab and chorizo. I made the cilantro sauce someone else suggested-- that was wonderful. How could someone not think it was flavorful with all that garlic?? Make sure your cilantro is fresh-- I used ONE clove jalepeno pickled garlic and added ponzu-- citrus soy. It was a bigger hit than the crab.

I loved this recipe. But I agree about the cilantro sauce - not enough punch. Next time, I probably stick with a cilantro sauce theme, but find something with more spice or more of a tang.

Fairly easy and versatile. The fritters are good by themselves or with a dipping sauce (not cocktail sauce). I tried the Warm Cilantro Sauce as mentioned by the previous reviewer, which worked okay. Next timeb I will try something with a little more punch.

Huge hit!!! I served these as an appetizer along with Peel & Eat Hot Pepper Shrimp (Bon Apetit May 2006). Everyone (including my teenagers) loved this. I used traditional chirizo (removed from it's casing). I did locate Sofrito at a local Latin market...do use this, as it added a great flavor. Make sure when you fry them that you keep them small (bite size). I fried mine several hours before my guests arrived. Make sure you drain them well and allow them to cool. I did place them on 8x12 baking dish, layered between parchment paper. I reheated them in a 400 degree oven..watch closely! I served it with Warm Cilantro Dipping Sauce (Bon Appetit May 2006).
