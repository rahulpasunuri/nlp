What a terrible waste of sea scallops and other fine ingredients! This recipe was incredibly bland and disappointing. My first disappointment with a recipe on this site. The scallops add nothing to this traditional French quenelle recipe. And, at $17.99/lb at Whole Foods, what a crime. In future, I'll just dust sea scallops w/some flour and saute in butter & olive oil. Deglaze the pan w/some shallots, white wine & a bit more butter, and voila! A much, much better way to showcase sea scallops' sublime flavor!

These are truly delicious, easy, and very unusual. I've made them several times, a couple of times wtih a small amount of a white fish (trout or sole) mixed in.
