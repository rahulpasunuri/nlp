this is a good TASTING recipe but the instructions are poor. luckily i know what i'm doing when it comes to caramels and similar sauces. first, you must boil much longer than 10mins to achieve the proper golden, almost brown color. second, you need to add the cream in just after you turn the heat off for the mix to seize and incorporate the cream, otherwise the cooled mix and cold cream will lead to improper texture, ie texture in the sauce where there shouldnt be any. tastes delish tho!

The reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of a higher rating is that the instructions are wholly inadequate. As a regular of this site, and I know to expect longer cooking times when making sauces, candies, etc. Even with that in mind, I had a bad experience. It took 30 minutes to reach the golden color they said would take 10 mins of cooking time. But by that point, the mixture completely broke. Since it was made with butter, I fixed it like I would an emulsion. I heated some of the remaining heavy cream, and added it to the sauce, which fixed it. Then I let it rest the 5 minutes, but when I added the rest it did not bubble vigorously as the directions said it would. The sauce tastes good, but I won't be using this recipe again. There must be one out there with better instructions.

Make sure you use a big enough sauce pan as the concoction tends to boil pretty rapidly and rise quite high in the pan. Lots of stirring, but well worth it. Extrememly yummy!

I agree- This took a lot longer than 10 minutes, but it is fantastic. Tastes like the inside of a Heath Bar

The cooking time for dark golden made with white sugar is a great deal longer then the 10min suggested. good thing I knew what I was doing.

my english grandmother used to make this and I would sneak huge spoonfuls of the stuff :) Now I have discovered the recipe and always make a wee bit more to accommadate the huge spoonfuls that go missing from the bowl This is very good
