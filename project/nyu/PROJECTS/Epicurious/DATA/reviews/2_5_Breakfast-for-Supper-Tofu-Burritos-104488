I thought this was excellent! I used medium hard tofu (I don't think I would have liked the soft tofu). Other than that, I would not change a thing.

I thinkyou would be better off marinating the tofu ahead of time if you want to cube it.

i make tofu "scramble" in breakfast burritos all the time and thought i'd look for a twist on what i usually do, but this looks so bland! what i usually do is finely mince onion. saute it, then add chopped mushrooms, the pepper, garlic, and some chopped artichoke hearts and spinach if you want. saute until the veggies are sort of cooked and add crumbled tofu. season with enough turmeric to turn the tofu a light yellow colour (1/2-3/4 tsp??), salt and pepper to taste, chili flakes, and some dried or fresh basil. yum yum yum. then you can eat as is or put in a burrito with some salsa, guacamole, or whatever.

This is a very healthful and very easy dish. Other than that, I don't have too much good to say. It was totally bland.

I took the suggestion of the cook from Arlington, VA and used 1/2 of the recommended oil. I did not have green onions, so I followed the rest of the recipe as is. It was yummy. The leftover filling was great over polenta the next day!

This is a great dish. I used about 1/2 of the recommended oil and added green onions. Yum!
