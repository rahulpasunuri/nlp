This was my first time making lamb and it was simple and delicious. Like another reviewer suggested, I subb'ed rice vinegar for plain white vinegar. if i were to do it again, i'd half & half--i think the rice vinegar adds a nice tartness but it was very strong. i also wasn't so sure when i read the recipe as to whether i should be preparing the lamb in a broiling pan or flat on a sheet pan. regardless, i dont have a broiling pan, so i covered a sheet pan with foil and made a makeshift grill by rolling long strips of foil and placing them under the chops about 3 inches apart. this lifted the meat slightly off of the tray and allowed some of the fat to drip. the flavor was excellent, but i honestly don't know if making it in a broiling pan would have been any different. i did exactly 8 minutes and turned over 4 minutes through. the last tip i have is that the rub was delicious, but strong, and the sauce is also strong, so the natural heartiness of the lamb could get a bit lost. go light on the sauce--it will mix well with your sides but dont douse the meat or all you'll taste is chimichurri. i served it with a side of quinoa and my husband was so impressed he was licking the bones. great starter recipe if it's your first time doing lamb--flavorful and simple!

Yum this was SO delicious. We made this for thanksgiving since it was just my husband and I this year. We actually only had about a 1/2 cup mint and it still came out great surprisingly! (We tried to use about the same amount of parsley to make up for that mistake.) I would probably get more next time so that the sauce isn't as runny but we were both extremely happy with the flavor of the sauce. We didn't make the peas.

Definitely a keeper in the recipe book! The sauce is amazing, although it doesn't taste so good alone. Paired with the lamb, it tasted wonderful. The rub alone added great flavor to the lamb.

I expected this to be good because other reviewers really liked it, but it still surprised me. First I made the chimichurri and tasted it and thought "oh no, this is boring." But it comes together perfectly with the seasonings on the lamb. The flavors are simple and clean and rich at the same time.

Excellent and simple recipe. We procured good quality lamb chops (very little fat) @ Costco(14 and doubled the batch). We grilled the chops to everyone's preferred style. Amongst five of us there were hardly any leftovers. Did not serve with peas. I served cauliflower that I roasted that with olive oil/salt. My only comment would be that I will slightly reduce the amount of vinegar in the chimichurri next time.

Delicious! I made just the lamb and mint sauce, not the (frozen!?) peas. Sauce so delicious my 5 year old ate it on bread! Lamb very good. And all so fast and easy!!

I made this for a special dinner with my in-laws and it was a hit! It was my first attempt at cooking lamb and my father-in-law (who apparently is a bit of a lamb snob) was knawing at the bones at the end. The sauce is so tasty and refreshing, even those of you who aren't fans of lamb, will like this dish. Its incredibly easy and delightfully colorful and an impressive dish to serve.

This is a great quick recipe and it's true, the sauce & rub really make it. After reading other reviews, I used seasoned rice vinegar instead of regular white vinegar and it gave the chimchurri just enough sweet and tang to make it amazing. I had sautéed asparagus and roasted butternut squash on the side for stellar taste and color. Lamb arm shoulder cut can be a little fatty, but the fat gives it loads of flavor. If you don't like the fat, then get lean lamb and make kabobs, but keep the chimchurri sauce. This recipe is a keeper, especially good for a low stress dinner with guests.

The sauce was great, and I served with lima beans instead of peas, which mixed well with the sauce. However... this was the first time I'd ever cooked lamb shoulder, and it was pretty much inedible. Really fatty, and an unappealing texture. Maybe I picked a bad cut, but we ended up throwing it all away.

Loved it! Sauce was fantastic!

Prepared as written this was very easy and delicious. The sauce was a welcome change from either mint jelly or mint/vinegar sauce. The acid and parsley/mint flavors were a good counterbalance for the fats in the lamb chops. I think even non-lamb lovers would enjoy this one.

This was a very quick and easy recipe. When I tasted the sauce alone, I was skeptical...but on the lamb (and on the mashed potatoes I made to accompany) it was delicious. I may even add more mint next time as I felt the flavor got a bit lost in the vinegar. The BF gave this recipe the best compliment by saying it didn't taste like lamb (he doesn't like lamb). I also served with brussels sauted with a bit of butter and salt since I'm not a big frozen pea fan.

Fast and relatively easy. My father loves lamb and the next time he is in town we are definitely going to fix this dish. Two cups of mint seamed like to much and it was not. What a great sauce instead of mint jelly.
