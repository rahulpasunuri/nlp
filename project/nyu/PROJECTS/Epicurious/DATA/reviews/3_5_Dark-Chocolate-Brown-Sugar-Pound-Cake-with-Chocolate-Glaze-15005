I really love it!! Instead of baking one big pound cake, I baked 18 small pieces. So I bake them at 325°F for 15 minutes and 5 more at 350°F. I also add toasted walnuts on top!! They were great!!

I have made this twice.Very fine crumb - like velvet. The flavor wasn't great and I don't know why with all the wonderful ingredients. I used good cocoa - King Arthur Double Dutch Dark that I have successfully used in past. It's a puzzle about the flavor if I try again will experiment with combination of different chocolates.

I used Kahlua instead of the choc. extract (easier to find). Absolutely loved this cake!

YUMMMM! We loved this cake! I made it for my husband's birthday because he loves dark chocolate and he raved! It was light and moist on the inside and had a nice crust on the outside. I did not use the chocolate extract because I didn't have time to find it and it still turned out very chocolatey. I used the exact recipe, including the amount of glaze and it was perfect. I did end up only baking it for about 1 hr. 12 min. and the bottom burned a bit but that is more a result of my off-temp oven. I'll definitely make this again!

This cake was not good. I did not preheat the oven and the brown sugar started burning as soon as it started getting hot. It still had a cake texture but the top layer was very dark. I shaved it off and the entire cake had a slight flavor of burnt sugar. It was also very dry. I make cakes a lot and will not try this again.

This went over really well when I made it for my co-workers. I doubled the glaze and it still wasn't quite as much as I would've liked (next time I will triple it). Also, thought the glaze was just a little to bitter - will use semi-sweet chocolate next time for the glaze.

I had a few problems with this recipe, and I thought the flavor was good but not great. So, I won't make it again. I must have used a bundt that was smaller than 12 c., because the batter overflowed about 2/3 of the way through cooking. I also had a problem getting the cake out of the pan--about 1/4 of it stuck. The flavor was good, but subtle. That said, I had a chocolate cake in a restaurant yesterday that really paled in comparison, so maybe my standards at home are too high.

This is absolutely delicious. I baked it as written, except I used two loaf pans. The baking time is key. My loaves were not exactly equal in size and the smaller one was slightly dry while the larger one was perfectly moist.

Very good chocolate cake! I made it in mini bundt and mini loaf pans. The bundts turned out great, but the mini loafs caved in a bit in the centers. I'm at high altitude, near Denver maybe this did it? I melted some dark chocolate, a bit of butter and some great vietnamese siagon cinnamon to make a glaze. It was great. Curious to know why it caved in, but otherwise a great cake. Found the chocolate extract at a spice store in Denver. No need to order from Williams Sonoma.

An excellent chocolate cake, a light crumb and not too sweet. Watch the time closely the last 20 minutes (it's never gone the full time in my oven). Makes alot of batter (I get one 10 cup bundt and a small loaf to freeze for later). It's great w/ summer fruit and whipped or sour cream - no need to make the glaze.

Yuck! This cake had all the ingredients of a delicious dessert and it tasted like wood. I used the finest ingredients, followed the directions to a T and still....horrible.

This is an excellent cake and can also be baked in two loaf pans. If your version of this cake is too dry, you either (1) used too much flour, used the wrong kind of flour, or didn't sift the flour; (2) baked it too long; or (3) used poor quality cocoa. I use Pernigotti Dutch Process cocoa. It's carried exclusively by Williams-Sonoma. It's about $12 for a 12 ounce tin. This Italian cocoa has a higher fat content than the popular grocery store brands and smells divine! The brand and kind of cocoa makes all the difference. Compare the scent of Pernigotti to one of the popular brands - there is no comparison! Some brands just smell like dust. Also, if you've have had that cocoa in the pantry since the Clinton administration, it's time to replace it! Sharffen Berger and Droste are also good options. I also use Land O'Lakes Super Premium Extra Creamy unsalted butter - more expensive, but the higher butterfat content makes for an even moister cake.

Found chocolate extract at Sur La Table -- Wm. Sonoma no longer carries it. This is a fabulous pound cake.

Did I make a different cake than everyone else? I followed this recipe to the letter and found the cake to be insipid and bone dry. I took a section to my folks and another to some friends and was mortified when I got home and tasted what was left. Uck! It went right into the trash.

Now my favourite chocolate cake. Get the chocolate extract -- it really makes a difference. Unbelievably light and delicious. The only downside is, I gain about eighty pounds every time I make it: I can't stop eating.

OK, well, yummy! Really delicious with a soft, light texture. Rich without being heavy. It's being winter I didn't bother with either the cream or the strawberries. It's delish anyway. Only note is: Cooks, know the size of your pans! I got a nice sized Bundt and a small loaf out of this recipe. No complaints about *more* cake, but it makes a lot of batter.

This was excellent! I made it for a friend's birthday and received rave reviews from every single person that tasted it! It's rich but not overly sweet and the brown sugar-sour cream & strawberries balance the richness of the cake.

The texture of this cake was outstanding...dense but fine, and moist. I was looking for dense cake for an adult birthday cake, so I actually baked this in 2 9" pans for 40-45 minutes. My oven's pretty true, and I watched it closely. It came out perfect. I did not make the glaze, but split the cake layers in half for a 4 layer cake. Not intensely chocolate like some, but the brown sugar made it sooo rich!! I filled two layers with seedless raspberry, and frosted the center and top with a nice chocolate fudge frosting. The cake sliced nicely, and was as rich as most people could stand!

This is for when you want to enjoy a fine flavored fine textured cake that's worth the time to make. ( A little less than an hour to put together.) NO it is not your gooey heavy extreme chocolate taste-but neither is it the tinny airy layer cake flavor. Think of it as a red velvet cake with a bit more chocolate...very nice and made for dainty bites, not huge mouthfuls. Even without beating the full time and having substituted rum for the vanilla and melted chips and cream for the choc extract the cake rose perfectly, was firm with tiny bubbles evenly dispersed and practically fell out of the pan. It's so easy going I could see myself cutting it in 4 layers and having no problem. Really watch the last 10 mins of baking as the edges will dry-I tented the top with foil for the last half hour.

The texture of this cake is divine--really like velvet. The taste is delicious, especially with the glaze. I would NOT add another portion of glaze as some have suggested--it would be too much.

Fabulous texture and flavor, and I always have loads of compliments. Looks like some people have had completely different opinions, but this is my favorite chocolate cake. You MUST use cake flour, use room temperature ingredients, and beat the cake for the full amount of time (a labor of love with my hand held beater!). However, I have occasionally left out the extract and used regular cocoa with equally good results. The topping truly needs to be piped (I use a plastic zipper bag with the corner snipped off.) If you want a drizzle topping, use the yummy Chocolate Glaze recipe shown with the Chocolate Hazelnut Pound Cake. (That cake, however, is a complete waste of hazelnuts.) I double the sour cream topping - leftovers make a great quickie "fondue" for fruit.

I made this cake twice and could never get the consistency right for the glaze. I ended up spreading it over the cake like a frosting. It has a nice flavor, though, and was easy to make.

This cake turned out very large. Not enough chocolate taste for me. The recipe for the glaze was not enough, should be at least twice as much glaze. I would say the glaze was the best part.

Richmond reviewer's advice on ingredients is right on. Have made this great cake several times. It's BETTER after freezing; seems to increase the moistness and deepen the chocolate/brown sugar flavors. Guests demolished it with caramel ice cream and requested leftovers!

Maybe my family is just not devoted chocolate lovers, but we all thought this cake was just so-so...even though I used premium ingredients. It was beautiful and smelled wonderful, so I suppose it made a great potpourri.

I've made this cake a few times in the past year, and I've found the success of it relies on a few things. First of all, a very fine, Dutch process, cocoa powder is essential - and if you shop around, good quality cocoa powder isn't that much more expensive then standard supermarket brands. Next, like in any pound cake recipe, the creaming of the butter and sugars must be not be hurried or overdone. The chocolate extract truly does add something special. Finally, check your oven's accuracy - mine can run as much as 50 degrees higher then the knob says. *And as I found out the hard way, if you bake in a "dark" pan, you may need to lower the temperature by 25 degrees (down to 325). If you have everything fresh - including the baking powder - and at room temperature, the cake will come out wonderfully.

I decided to try this recipe because of the rave reviews. I was disappointed in the results. It tasted more of the brown sugar then anything else. It actually overpowered the chocolate. I admit that I didn't make the glaze, but a great chocolate cake shouldn't have to depend on the glaze or frosting to make it good. Won't take the time to make again.

I would highly recommend this cake to anyone - especially chocolate lovers. I did use the chocolate extract from Wm Sonoma and believe it really added something to the cake. I also doubled the recipe for the glaze - the standard 3 oz of chocolate didn't seem to be enough.
