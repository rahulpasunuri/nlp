I thought the filling was quite tasty but the bottom layer of pastry didn't raise at all and was quite chewy......not good. Also, be sure to crimp the pastry layers securely or the filling will ooze out all over the pan......not good. Will give up on trying to make this again.

To quote Janice from Friends, "OH MY GOD!" This was an easy recipe. I served it room temperature and it was good, but 10 seconds in the microvave for a slice made it even better. My company came back for thirds! I reccomend a scoop of high quality ice cream (Haagen Daaz) to go along with a warm piece of this. Also you may want to decorate by drizling with melted chocolate. Excellent recipe. Will make again and again.

The recipe said it makes only 8 servings and I needed more so I made individual ones instead of one large one. I rolled out the puff pastry sheets to get more from each one. I ended up using 3 boxes of puff pastry (6 sheets)and made 37 individual pastries (2.5 inches each). I only cooked them for 12-14 minutes. They turned out very good and were gone instantly. If you've ever had Nutella - that is what the filling tastes like - yum.

This dish is very simple to make and there is little room for errors. It tastes good but its not extraordinary. If you want something simple, quick, and pretty tasty, then try it out.

Pithiviers is a tiny village in the ile de France (area surounding Paris) noted for its almond cakes and use of Saffron. Its a shame that this recipie doesn't include the original intent and perhaps offer the Haxelnut and Chocolate as a variation.
