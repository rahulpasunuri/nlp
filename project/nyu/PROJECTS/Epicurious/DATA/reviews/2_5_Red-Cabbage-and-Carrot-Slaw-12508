This was a good place to start for a recipe. I also added some onion and used seasoned rice wine vinegar. Regular vegetable oil seemed really bland so took the Asian flavor that was begun with the vinegar and substituted toasted sesame oil and used gomasio (toasted sesame seeds & sea salt) but you could just add them separately. I lowered the sugar amount. My husband loved it and asked for it again. Altered, this is now my red cabbage slaw favorite over mayo based slaws- crisp, clean flavor.

I made this according to another reviewer's specs. I added the red onion. I cut back the sugar a little, since I was serving it with a honey citrus salmon sandwich on brioche. It went over well with my entire family. Some had it on the side and some on the sandwich. Will definitely make it a lot this summer, as it's also dirt cheap!

Would only give this recipe two forks as is. I just wanted a simple vinegar slaw recipe when I came across this one. Way too basic, but I also didn't want one of those complicated kabookie rain dance recipes either. With the addition of just two ingredients this simple dish came out pretty good. As it stands, uncooked cabbage is pretty bland. So I added 1/2 small onion sliced paper thin, and just a dash of red pepper powder. Makes one heck of a difference. Oh yea, seasoned rice wine vinegar is a must, even with the addition of sugar.

this is a very boring dish - tasted like cardboard - nothing taste. My husband did not like it either - we threw the remainder out. Yuck - skip it.

Fine, but a little too vinegary and nothing special. It was missing something. I added some toasted pine nuts and caraway seeds, which helped. I think it needs something crunchy for contrast since the cabbage gets soft so quickly.

I forgot to say that I used unseasoned rice vinegar because there is already sugar in the recipe - tho some say there's no appreciable difference.

So simple but so spectacular - in taste and appearance.

I would definately use less than 1T. sugar - maybe 1/2? Also, I think it's fine to pour the dressing over an hour or so before serving. It was delicious the next day!
