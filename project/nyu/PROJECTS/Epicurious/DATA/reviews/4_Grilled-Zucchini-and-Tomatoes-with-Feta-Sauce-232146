This sauce (dressing) is EXCEPTIONAL. I'm at the end of the gardening season and I have run out of ideas for both zucchini and tomatoes. I didn't use a food processor because I like things to have texture. I had some large zucchini that I needed to "process" so I cut it a t about 1/4" slices and did the same for some beef steak tomatoes that needed doing. I grilled these a tad longer. I used a cinnamon basil from the garden that coloured the sauce just a bit and I will make this again and again...it is super!!

OMG, we LOVED this sauce...Greek Feta was what I had and it was delicious. I cut chicken "skewer" size and grilled it with the skewered cherry tomatoes and wedged zucchini. Served it all over salad greens with the sauce. So easy and full of flavor for an easy dinner that delights.

The sauce is amazing. Loved it on the zucchini and tomatoes (which I just used regular homegrown tomatoes and grilled thick slices of them). Used the extra for lunch on chicken breasts I grilled the same night.

Loved the sauce! I have to say that it complemented the grilled veggies perfectly and I will definit3ely be making this again. I did add a little more garlic but besides that followed the recipe to a tee.

I also made the recipe with Greek Yogurt. I did add a little mayo because it seem to be lacking the zip from sour cream. I was skeptical as to how this would taste on the grilled vegetables, but it was amazing and we ended up putting the sauce on everything (lamb, asparagus, roasted potatoes, zucchini, tomatoes) The sauce kicked a huge notch. I also cut my zucchini in long wedges. I couldn't visualize the thin slices working out that well on the grill.

Excellent recipe, however I use Greek yogurt for the sauce instead of sour cream. Seems much healthier and more authentically good. It's now a Greek food staple for dinner.

What a delicious sauce! I prepared it with creme fraiche (what I had on hand),fresh tomatoes and basil from the greenhouse and courgettes (zucchini) from the veg plot.

Made this for a back yard BBQ. The sauce was fabulous. Everyone was putting it on everything - even the Fillet Mignon. Yummmmm.

Skewered tomatos, zucchini cut in rounds, yellow pepper and grilled. Used regular feta, everything else as written for the sauce. Don't have food processor so I pulsed in a blender - sauce texture wasn't very smooth but family loved the flavor. Served w/ spice-rubbed grilled pork chops and roast potatos - we put the sauce on everything. Will definitely make again.

I LOVED this recipe. Everything was great the night we made it and then there was a bunch of the feta sauce leftover so I used it on top of some grilled chicken the next night and then added a little more olive oil to the remaining sauce and used it as a salad dressing later in the week. Can't wait to make this again.

Fantastic. The sauce for this was better than sauce that I've had in Greek restaurants. I will definitely be making this again.

My picky husband, who often turns his nose up to my culinary concoctions, gobbled this down & grinned for "more please." This sauce is now a staple sauce for all our greek dinners too.

This is a perfect side dish when you are searching for a new and eye-pleasing way to serve vegetables. Goes great with anything from the grill.

I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream because that's what I had in the house. I also cut the zucchini into wedges instead of thin strips. It still turned out great.

Excellent and easy. I put the veggies in an aluminum foil pack - took slightly longer to cook but was quick with easy cleanup.

Great summertime barbecue dish. The sauce is absolutely delish! I cut the zucchini into 1/2" rounds and used whole pearl tomatoes. Grilled them in a vegetable basket. Yum. My husband and sister loved it too.

Excellent and so easy! Made the cheese sauce in minutes before going to a BBQ party. Gives a little class to casual dining. Kids liked it, too. Never have owned a food processor so I took the advice of using goat cheese and just whipped it all up with a fork. Decided to add feta (Greek, of course!) and found it easy enough to blend with the fork, smushing most and leaving some chunks, which I personally like. Garlic can easily overpower so take care not to put in too much at first.

We do the sauce with goat cheese and its super yummy!

I have cooked with both French Feta and Greek Feta. Both are very good but the French Feta was more creamy, which seems appropriate for this dish.

Yummy.

The sauce was delicious. Next time I am going to cut it in thicker 1" round slices.

Doubled the recipe for a barbecue and it was a huge hit. I can't wait to make it again. Couldn't find french feta but I used organic goat milk feta and it worked very well.

I made the sauce following the recipe and served it with grilled eggplant, asparagus, zucchini and peppers. It was a hit! Great vegetarian alternative for guests who don't eat meat. I think the sauce would be great thinned with more lemon juice and used as a salad dressing!

This was a really nice grilled veggie side dish. And the sauce was great! To make things a bit easier I used skewers for the zucchini and cherry tomatoes. I cut the squash in 1" rounds then threaded them on to oiled skewers. I rubbed both veggies with olive oil, salt and pepper. Then grilled them. The sauce was such a perfect compliment to the veggies. This would be a nice side dish to any grilled fish or chicken. My husband and I give this 3 forks since it is tasty and simple. I will definitely be using this yummy recipe again when we grill.

Outstanding recipe...made it the first time substituting fresh mint for the basil...really good! Will definitely make it again. Never heard of French feta either.

I made this last night and really enjoyed it. The sauce is great and would work on many grilled vegies. I should note that I really love feta so I am somewhat biased. I certianly agree with the cook from Athens...there is no feta but Greek!

Nice combination! Sorry for being chauvinistic, but only Greece produces feta and can proudly call it by that name. All the others produce white cheese. Try the receipe with Greek feta and compare it to French white cheese and tell me.

delicious sauce! i agree that it would go well with a number of different veggies, in a number of different ways.

The feta sauce was delicious and would be good for all sorts of veggies; however, I should have used the French feta, since the grocery store feta was a bit grainy in the sauce. I cut the zucchini closer to 1/4 inch since this was served as one of the vegetable dishes rather than an appetizer.

We liked this very much...I did add a chopped green onion and little extra basil to the sauce. I also grilled chunks of Maui onion on skewers in addition to the other veggies.

I was expecting a more robust sauce, but I really like the subtle flavors. Definitely a keeper.

Much more interesting than it sounds. The sauce is stunning but I will use less garlic (50%) next time.
