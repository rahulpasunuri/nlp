The chutney is ridiculously good. We had it with pork. I don't give many 4-fork ratings.

Lime and shallot baste is an excellent way to grill swordfish. That is pretty much the extent of positive comments about this recipe. The salsa was very bland and much too sweet. It overpowered the baste. I used a whole serrano chile and could not detect any benefit from it. I often prepare swordfish with a spicy mango, red pepper, and cilantro salsa that compliments the fish much better.

This is a fantastic recipe. I made it exactly as directed, except: instead of the serrano chili, I went with a dried guajillo chile softened in the wine/stock base, and added some isop pepper for added seasoning to the stock base. I found that the stock/wine needed much longer to evaporate - much more than 10 minutes; plan accordingly. This is a dish that has very unique flavours and which will have all your guests raving.

This was an amazing dish. Made the chutney earlier in the day and set aside and it was perfect. Added the plantains to simmer for the last few minutes. Swordfish marinade was perfect!!

I made the chutney to accompany a curried chicken dish. It was fantastic. I didn't have fresh pineapple, so I used canned crushed and it was still remarkable!

Good, but not great. I thought the chutney needed something more. Maybe next time I would use the excess sauce to pass at the table instead of just using it as a basting sauce.

This was the best-tasting swordfish I have ever made. The basting sauce is fantastic. I added a bit of honey to the plantain mixture just before serving, and ommitted the salt and pepper from the chutney. Very tasty. would definitely make it again. very easy to do.

This would be great with any white fish also. Chop fruit fine. I substituted banana for plantin. I also thought it needed more heat. quick and easy. I Combined chutney and fish and it was even better next day.

the basting sauce for the swordfish was perfect - this is one of the best swordfish dishes i've ever had! i think the chutney would have been better if i'd chopped the fruit smaller and i would use more chili pepper next time, the heat was barely noticable at all. definitely will make it again!

made the chutney with tuna steaks, and the flavors blended beautifully. did not remove plantains during the final simmer. served with spanish rice and fried plantains to reinforce the flavor. wonderful dinner...would serve to guests!!!

lovely tasting chutney & it can be used with any solid white fish. I live in the Fla. Keys so I used Grouper and it was terrific.

Fish was super but the chutney was a bit disapointing. Was overall a good dish. An excellent fish for the grill.
