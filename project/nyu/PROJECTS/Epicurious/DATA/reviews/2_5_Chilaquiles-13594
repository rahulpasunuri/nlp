This is not the traditional way and takes away from the quality of the dish.

This recipe needs help. Instead of tomato sauce, use enchilada sauce -- mild or hot, depending on your preference. The mild has plenty of zip for me. Also add diced onions as a layer for texture and flavor. It is not necessary to fry the tortillas first. The Mexican side of my family makes it this way and we love it! Also, before serving, top each portion with shredded iceberg lettuce. It adds more than you would think!

My Mexican husband and his family don't bake the dish. You fry chopped chiles in oil, then add tortilla pieces, let them get crispy, then add chopped tomato and onion (and salt to taste). Quick, easy, delicious! It's a great dish -- if you had poor results with this recipe, don't get discouraged. Try the real thing.

I've made this frying my own tortillas as well as just using organic tortilla chips. It was just as good with the tortilla chips and saves tons of time. Really yummy if you can find salsa verde.

I don't understand why frying the tortillas was necessary - it just made things greasy and they didn't turn out crispy in the end. The sauce was also pretty bland. I prefer other tortilla casseroles to this.

Though this is one of my favorite Mexican dishes to order in a restaurant, and I was excited to find this recipe, I hated the final product and will not make this again. Ultimately, the dish was soggy, with no contrasting consistencies, and the cheese was all wrong. Leftovers were even worse, and after so much work! I found a Food & Wine magazine recipe for the same dish which I will try next--that one calls for a homemade chilli sauce (no beans, but lots of chilli powder, not too tomatoey and thin like this one) and uses tortilla chips--makes sense, since they're already fried.

This recipe is the closest I can find to what I had when I went to Mexico...it is indeed best with shredded chicken. Another great addition-chopped fresh cilantro.

A few weeks ago I found this dish in a little restaurant, Carmalita's, in Pto Vallarta. It took me awhile to find the recipe here... it's Chilequiles. anyway this is pretty close to that authentic flavor, I would not only suggest the chicken but sliced beef on the side as well! Accompanied with black beans or butter, cream and jalepeno baked diced potatos.

Great dinner for friends. I like to serve it with plenty of spanish rice. Serve extra enchilada sauce on the side.

Time-consuming unless you make the homemade Mexican tomato sauce in advance. Also, as my husband reminded me later, our favorite version included shredded chicken. I think he's right, I will include that next time! Overall, I would recommend this dish (with chicken, of course).
