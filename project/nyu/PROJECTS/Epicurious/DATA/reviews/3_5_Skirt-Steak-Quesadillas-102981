Because I lacked the stated ingredients, I switched the cheeses to mozzerella and provolone and used a fresh homemade bruschetta. It's a bit of an Italian twist but it was just wonderful. My picky family loved it and wants more.

Fantastic! Simple and tastes great. Definitely grill the meat. Tried to find mojo carillo as suggested, but couldn't. Still excellent without it.

My husband LOVES this recipe. I use Newman's Own Tequila Lime salsa and sharp cheddar/colby jack mix with honey wheat tortillas. I serve it with a lime crema...YUMMY!

very tasty. i substituted half pepperjack and half fontina cheese and used sirloin tips then sliced them on a 45 degree angle in place of the skirt steak. i made it like a steak and cheese from d'angelos(mushrooms, onions peppers, omitted the salsa) and it was excellent. you wouldn't serve it at fancy dinner party but if you did there wouldn't be any leftovers.

Just so-so. My butcher said skirt steak is no longer available (just in our area?)so I used flank steak with the previously suggested marinade. The meat was great, but the whole thing put together was just average.

Great recipe -- very tasty and definitely on my "make again" list. Thanks to the reviwer from Annapolis who listed their version of the marinade (lime juice, garlic, soy sauce, and mojo criollo sauce) -- I added a little honey as well and thought it was delicious. At first I sliced the steak a little too thick, but realized how much better if it were sliced as thin as possible. A great building block recipe -- you could do many variations on this. Thanks.

Loved it but made a few changes to make it easier to transport. First I grilled the steak then cut it into very small pieces, put them in a bowl and added shredded cheese and enough salsa to moisten.I put a couple of spoonfuls onto 1 tortilla and covered with a 2nd tortilla. Since I would't have much time at my destination to bake them I baked them at home turning over once. I removed them from the oven, covered with foil then 30 minutes later heated them at my friends house for about 5 minutes until crispy. Cut into pieces. They got great reviews.

Yum! Tested this recipe out on brand new neighbors and was it ever a hit! Didn't change a thing and definitely wouldn't. Agree with fellow reviewer in that it would make a great family meal...pair it with a salad and you're set!

Delicious - skirt steak a must - recommendation of 3 mexican cheeses that you can buy in market was good choice. Use at least a medium salsa if store bought.

After many years of trying to perfect a skirt steak marinade, I think I have finally found the answer. This works with skirt, flank and (at Costco) the flap meat cut. Marinate the meat in a mixture of lime juice, mojo criollo sauce (by Goya or Kirby), soy sauce and some freshly minced garlic. Minimum of 1 hour. Grill or broil meat.

Really good!! The flavor was excellent, but I found the meat to be a little hard to bite into without the whole thing coming out of the quesadilla. Tried it with shrimp prepared the same way and it was fantastic!! The pico de gallo was also delicious!!! Have already made it several times!! Also prefer flour tortillas to the corn.

I substituted corn tortillas for flower tortillas and liked it much better. The quesadillas were not mushy. Besides, I did not like the taste of corn tortillas at all.

I thought this was very good but mine turned out kind of mushy. I don't know if it's because of the pico de gallo in the quesodilla or what. I think I will leave that out when I make this again and just add it to the top after it is cooked. I also couldn't find skirt steak at my grocery store so wound up just using a a boneless sirloin. It was VERY tasty but a bit tough. I can't wait to try these again with actual skirt steak.

I is very important to marinade the skirt steak as it is a fiberous meat. Lemon juice is aslo a good choice for that. I perfer the cheese already shreded Mexican blend, you get 3 cheeses instead of one. I also madegreen tomatillo slasa and it was a success. I will make this again and again.

So very simple and so very tasty. The Pico de Gallo or any fresh (not bottled) salsa is essential, the spicy pepper jack is not - you can use any number of good melting cheeses.

Finally a delicious easy (and low cost) dinner that all my children can and will eat. These are not easy to find since I must make sure our foods are gluten free for my child with Celiac's disease. Thank you!
