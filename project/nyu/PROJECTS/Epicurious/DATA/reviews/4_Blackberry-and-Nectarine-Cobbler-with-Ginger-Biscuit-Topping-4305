Really, really good. The aesthetic of the rolled and cut-out biscuits - I used a heart shaped cookie cutter - was ridiculously full of win & awesome. I'll cut back a bit on the sugar & candied ginger next time, but not by much. Happily, the biscuits were super tender and light despite my making the dough in a processor. Freezing the butter before incorporating it and then putting them in the fridge on a cookie sheet while the fruit finished its first round of cooking might have helped.

The biscuits on this cobbler were ridiculously good. I used blueberries instead of blackberries, used 2/3 c sugar in the filling, and omitted the ginger because no one in my house likes it. Used some Penzey's Baking Spice instead to give a little extra flavor. Also I just hand-formed biscuits to go on top, and I liked the extra thickness. The timing worked out perfectly though, everything was perfectly cooked.

This is my go-too recipe this summer. I substituted blueberries which are more to my liking. I agree with last reviewer, the ginger is crucial and is what makes it special.

Delicious and simple. I cut back on sugar to 2/3 cup as some other reviewers suggested and honestly thought the sweetness was perfect. Don't skip the ginger! The fruit colors peeking through the star-shaped biscuits makes a very pretty dessert. Definitely a go-to summer dessert.

Absolutely delicious! We thought it was a little too sweet. I suspect because I used nectarines from my own tree which are very sweet when ripe, so used a little less sugar, 2/3 cup, and frozen blueberries the second time and it was again delicious.

Haven't had a chance to eat this yet, but the different elements alone were delicious. I baked off the extra "biscuit" dough on a cookie sheet and it was so great alone! I cannot wait for this cool enough to eat! :-)

I served this at a dinner party of highly critical women! They gave it rave reviews! One woman claimed it was the most flippin fabulous dessert she had ever eaten!

This was AMAZING. I don't have any kind of cream so used my normal soy milk instead. Was still great! I love the addition of crystallized ginger. It really made a difference but if you didn't have it, it would still be delicious. My nectarines were very juicy so I should have used a bit more cornstarch. My only suggestion - I don't know how many nectarines are in a pound, so I had to guess. I probably used more than the recipe calls for. It would be nice to put a measurement I have in my kitchen, or say 6 nectarines, instead of 3 lbs.

Fab! I used frozen blackberries and no nectarines. The biscuit is absolutely delicious. Top it with unsweetened whip cream.

I made this with fresh mango....reduced the sugar slightly and added a touch of cardamom. It was great. The ginger is a wonderful addition.

very yummy -- I used whole milk instead of heavy cream; found it impossible to roll out and cut the biscuits, so I just did "drop" biscuits. Still tasted great and everyone loved it.

The addition of crystalized ginger to the cobbler topping is SUBLIME. Will do again. Used the topping with some great fresh blueberries I had. I think the topping would work with nearly any fruit.

This is a pretty amazing cobbler. I used all frozen fruit (I live in Manhattan and it's March; we do the best we can) and used a smaller portion of ground instead of crystalized ginger. It was lovely. Also, I cut the bicuits into star shapes and arranged it so that each plate had one star on top. It was super easy and made my apartment smell like heaven. I'll surely make it again.

Hands down the best cobbler I have ever had. I added in frozen peaches with the blackberries and served it hot with vanilla ice cream!

I made this recipe with blueberries and nectarines, otherwise following recipe exactly. YUM. We could hardly wait to eat it, topped with vanilla ice cream. Was my first attempt at a cobbler, and I can't imagine using any other recipe.

I mixed my ripe nectarines w/ mixed berries. I usually lessen the sugar in my dessert recipes just a bit although this time I noticed the "less sweetness." So, the sugar meas. may accurate after all. If you enjoy peach, apple, plum, or apricot pie/cobbler etc., you'll probably enjoy this recipe. I'm a berry/rhubarb fan and may make it again using those ingredients and just eat my raw fresh nectarines as they are.

Wonderful recipe - everyone who tried it really enjoyed it! A great way to use those extra blackberries at the end of the season.

I made this for a concert picnic with great results. The base could be other like nectarines & plums. The cutout topping is very tastie on its own. For picnic fare, I baked as directed, removed the topping cutouts for transport& reassembled the bowls for serving. If served warm, ice cream would be a nice add.

I made this for my husband last year and it was worth the time! I'm glad I found this recipe again. I plan on making this when the fruit is in season for a dinner party.

This is a definite keeper -- quite a bit of prep work up front, but the results are fantastic - my friends absolutely loved it and wanted to come back to my house for the second, even the third, night for this dessert. Make sure you have large enough bowls for the preparation -- the portions here are huge. For the more economical cooks, wait till nectarines are in season and skip the crystallized ginger and use ground ginger / cinnamon / nutmeg instead.
