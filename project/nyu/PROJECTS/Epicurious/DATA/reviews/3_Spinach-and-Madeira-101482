Can't believe I'm giving this recipe 1 fork-we like spinach and love baconso it sounded great, however, we were very disappointed-I did not add the mushrooms which may have made the difference but no one but me likes them. Would not make this again.

We had the ingredients for this, so I made it. Well, I thought I had Madeira, but it was Marsala so I used dry Masala. OK, so it is 50ish, it was very tasty even with frozen spinach.

Our previous neighbour was Portuguese and would make frequent visits to his homeland. In return for watching his house, he'd bring us all manner of goodies. More than once he brought back madeira, so I made this nice side with some. Goes well with rice.

Aside from spending very long time washing the spinach, the recipie was super easy to make. I will definitely be making it again. Make sure you drain your spinach after cooking very well, because you will be adding enough liquids!

Yummers. Agree with previous writer - it's nice to have a spinach recipe not filled with cheese. We left out the bacon too... Very tasty!

Absolutely one of the tastiest spinach recipes I've ever made. Substituted port for the madeira since I didn't want to open a whole bottle of madeira, and used reduced fat buttermilk to make it lighter. Yummy. Works well in an omlet the next day.

Too rich! I'd make it again with this lighter approach. Make a roux with 2-3 tbs butter and 2-3 tbs flour. Whisk in milk instead of cream. When thickened, add madeira and season with salt and white pepper. When spinach is ready, toss the bacon and mushrooms with the bechemel. Actually, I like to throw the cooked spinach in a food processor, and pulse twice, then add the sauce, pulse once. Toss other ingredients, Grate nutmeg on top when serving.

Excellent and easy to make. I added some crushed Garlic and chopped onions. Skipped the bacon. Substituted heavy cream with milk and added some parmesan cheese. Groovy!!

I liked this recipe. It was simple to make and it had no cheese in it, which so many spinach recipes use. I made only two minor changes. First, I sliced the mushrooms instead of chopping them; this made the dish look better in the serving dish (this would look great in a chafing dish at a buffet dinner). Second, I used more mushrooms than called for (an 8 oz. pkg), but we love sauteed mushrooms. I disagree with the two reviews I saw. This is not a bland-tasting recipe, and, as for the fat police, I don't care because it tasted great. My only caution is that I would not serve this dish if the main dish was heavily sauced or spiced. I think this recipe goes best with a nice but simply prepared steak or grilled fish.

I found this recipe both overly rich and rather bland in flavor. Seeing that it's a 1959 recipe probably explains why it has cream, butter and bacon in the same dish.

REPLACE THE CREAM WITH 1/2 OF GOOD PARMESAN CHEESE AND STUFF PASTA SHELLS. ITS THE BEST.
