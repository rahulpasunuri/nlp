Made this for a dinner party last night on a sweltering summer evening. Everyone seemed to like it--used a Trinidadian hot sauce (with a mango base) and substituted veg broth for chicken b/c I had vegetarians coming over. I liked the soup, though it was a little thick. Best served in small dishes, as an appetizer. I only used 2 of the 4 avocados---any more and it would have been as thick as guacamole.

This recipe is a good start but definitely needs work to make it better. First, there is too much chicken broth - it is better with about 1/2 as much broth and the rest replaced with water, otherwise its taste overpowers the very delicate taste of the avocado. More importantly, it contains a large amount of fat and the recipe calls for no acid to balance it. I added the juice of a whole lemon and some sherry vinegar to balance the fat. Some of the other reviewers who commented it was bland and that adding more hot pepper sauce did not fix it were I am sure experiencing this problem. So with some acid to brighten the flavor and balance the richness of the avocado and milk, its pretty good.

Addendum.... after my company really raved about this soup. I skipped the chicken stock and used chicken boullion with a tiny bit of water. I used a finishing salt and I loaded in the sherry. I also added some toasted sesame seeds as a garnish with parmesan cheese. All of these things really boosted the already wonderful flavors of this fun recipe. Not sure where others had problem with this nutritional summer soup. Additionally, I used lactose free skim milk. This choice kept it light and summery.

I loved this when I had it at a friend's house last summer as a starter to a bbq. Made it as the starter to a formal dinner party and everyone loved it. I made it exactly as per the recipe and served it with a salmon tartare on the side. Great for summer.

I read the review and decided to give it a try. Horrible! What a waste of avocados! Tasteless and what a nasty texture!

This was a huge hit before our Easter feast; serves 24 appetizer portions in demitasse cups. After reading reviews, I made the following modifications: added 2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice, added an additional 6 oz. chicken broth, upped hot pepper sauce to 3/4 tsp, added 1/8 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp white pepper. Made this a day ahead, although there was a slight discoloration on top, it easily stirred out. This soup was quite thick and required a spoon. Quick and easy to make if you suddenly find yourself with four ripe avocados.

This was a delicious soup, and the presentation was gorgeous. I did add the juice of a lemon to brighten the flavor somewhat. This is a definite repeat performer.

This is the easiest and most delicious thing; I made it three years ago for my summer share house and we all still talk about it. In fact, I visited this site tonight looking for it because we were talking about it just this past weekend.

Blech! An entire bottle of hot sauce wouldn't perk up this bland, pasty soup, that more closely resembled a boring salad dressing or vegetable dip. This is the first recipe on this site with which I have been so wholly unimpressed...

I found this recipe too thick and rich -- maybe it's my fault for not liking too rich recipes. Anyway I had to keep adding liquids to it to cut it and then that didn't even make it better.

I was kind of scared to make this, but it was excellent!!!
