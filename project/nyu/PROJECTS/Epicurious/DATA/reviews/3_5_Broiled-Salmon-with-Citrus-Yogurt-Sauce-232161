This yogurt sauce is delish and super easy. Very good over veggies too--my kids also really liked it. Good simple dinner.

I was looking for an easy sauce to work with the salmon I had in the oven. Just made it, so light, refreshing,and it took 2 mins to make.The next time I make it, I will try it with garlic, or the cumin, that other people used.

Made this for a friend who is vegetarian. She loved it and so did I. The sauce is delicious. Perfect meal for a hot summer day.

Love this simple sauce! I added a clove of garlic and some dill and really enjoyed it over my quinoa and salmon. I am however challenged when it comes to my broiler. It took me a really long time to cook my piece of salmon, about 30 minutes! Not sure if that's because of my cheap oven or if I'm doing something wrong. But once done, I really enjoyed this dish, maybe would prefer baking it, then putting it in the broiler for a crispy top. just an idea...

the addition of citrus to the yogurt accentuates its "tang" without necessarily adding any additional flavor. Almost reminds me of a citrus version of tzatziki or mint raita. Gives the salmon a silky and cooling component which is very pleasant. will be making again.

This is a very good alternative to my other ways of cooking salmon. yogurt sauce was really delicious on the salmon, great flavor and nice fresh zing for summer grill season. Could be used on other fish easily. will add to my salmon recipe rotation.

I've never cooked salmon this well! It was easy, the directions were clear, and YUM. I added a dash of cumin and cayenne to the sauce, and more citrus juices to taste. I made this with couscous and a fresh avocado salad (salt, pepper, lime). Mmmm!

I was skeptical at first when I read the ingredients and when I tasted the sauce on its own. But everyone in the family loved it on the salmon. For those who thought the citrus was overpowering, you must have not followed the measurements exactly. It complimented the salmon beautifully. It was so fast too - perfect.

The sauce was easy to make and tasted really good, but it now go well with the fish. It detraced from the salmon, I was not impressed and will not make this one again.

So delicious!! We added garlic and dill to the sauce to add some extra flavour. This is now our favourite salmon recipe.

I loved this dish and it would be a very good summer dish especially in the hot summer nights in the Bay Area when you want something light. I took the advice of Edenr from Colorado by omitting water in the sauce. I also revised the sauce recipe by also adding lemon zest, lemon juice, to the other citrus in the recipe. I also added a little more olive oil, honey and I kept tasting it until I was fully satisfied with the sauce. The Greek yogurt is an added plus because it makes it very creamy and be used as a salad dressing.

Living in Alaska allows me to try an abundance of salmon recipies. I've had it every way you can have it and this method of preparation is super easy and very good. Follow the salmon directions to the letter and you'll be amazed at how good it is. I omitted the OJ and Orange rind from the sauce and simply added more lime zest and it was phenomenal. This sauce will be a staple in my kitchen. It would be EXCELLENT with a fruit salad as well.

This just barely gets one fork. It was very, very bland. I tasted the sauce when making it and thought it was quite good, but it did very little to accent the flavor of the fish and, in fact, obscured the beautiful wild salmon I had. I'm deleting it from my recipe box and won't make it again. Blah.

This was so delicious and flavorful, I don't understand those reviewers that thought the sauce was bland. I made the sauce exactly according to the recipe except I used non-fat Greek yogurt to keep the fat content down and omitted the water. I was worried about the orange and honey, that it would be too sweet, but the sauce had a perfect tang and wasn't sweet at all. I served it with steamed zuchini that I seasoned with a dill seasoning mix and some fresh lemon juice and red potatoes. WOW- DELICIOUS- I can't wait to make again and am trying to figure out what else I can make the sauce with!

A wonderful and almost stupidly simple sauce I have served both for family meals and guests. One of those last- minute gems! I omit the water in the sauce, as I like it thicker.

Easy to prepare and tasty. Halved the sauce recipe as there were only 3 of us and used fresh squeezed tangerine juice and frozen grated orange peel. Also used less salt and it did taste great over new boiled baby potatoes.

We have been making this recipe since it showed up in the mag and it is wonderful. I wouldn't change anything about it.

I have to disagree, the sauce was way too heavy on the citrus flavor. I ended up throwing it out. I made another sauce with lemon, yogurt and a little dill, and it was a lot better. The flavors were more balanced. The salmon itself though turned out great under the broiler, very easy.

I loved this recipe. Based on the previous review, I put a bit less salt. I also left out the honey since I didn't have any. The yogurt sauce was delicious as it was, though I'm curious to try it with the honey as well. The sauce was also very good with potatoes I made as a side dish.

Rating: 3
The yogurt sauce was very good but both my husband and I thought that 3/4 t was too much salt. Maybe that's because I didn't add the water called for in the recipe (as suggested by the other reviewers). This is a nice way to flavor salmon.

So simple, yet amazingly delicious... oh, the sauce is fantastic! Couple of tweaks I did to it, and was awesome. I splashed soy sauce and cracked pepper over a whole 1.2lb salmon filet (for 3 servings, but 2 of us ate the whole thing :O) and roasted in 500-deg oven for 12 mins (perfect to medium). For the sauce, I simplified it down to just Greek yogurt, zest and juice of 1 lime, 1 T honey and salt to taste - skipped all the rest and it turned out FABULOUS. I would never think that lime, honey and yogurt could be so heavenly, but this could really be my new signature sauce!

Great quick + tasty weekday meal- but there's no need to fire up a broiler with all those extra steps(particularly in 90 degree heat!) Was perfectly delicious and much more simple to just briefly pan sear the salmon...also easier to be sure not to overcook the salmon.

This was a very nice sauce. I didn't have plain or Greek yoghurt, but I did have lite, lemon chiffon yoghurt. This was a 6oz container, I adjusted the recipe accordingly, also added a little lemon zest in addition to the lime and orange zest and it was a hit.

Very simple, easy meal. would be great for no-stress entertaining. How long do you think the extra sauce lasts for?

When I tasted the sauce alone, I became very skeptical. Completely tasteless. But after it sit for a few minutes, the sauce took on the citrus flavor, and it was very good on the fish. The family enjoyed it too.

This wasn't bad but after all the glowing reviews we were disappointed. The sauce was better on asparagus.

This was pretty good. I baked the salmon instead of broiling. Didn't add any water to the sauce (didn't see the point of having to drain the yogurt and then add water) also added more honey, about 1 TB. Very good with the salmon, didn't like it by itself though.

A tasty, easy way to jazz up plain salmon. And I agree with what the person below said about the yogurt being good by itself--I used lemon instead of lime. Mmmm.

We grilled the fish outside and then sauced it, and it was terrific. I had no honey so I added dill weed. Next time I will follow the recipe, but as I made it, wow!

super easy and yummy! someone suggested serving it with the curried sweet potato latkes...so i did and it was super good! fast too! enjoy!

Very elegant, especially for the minimal effort. I used the Trader Joe's Greek style yogurt and followed sauce recipe exactly, except left out the water. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I squeezed leftover orange juice on the salmon before cooking. Broiled 2 8-oz pieces of Salmon for 7 minutes and was perfect! (my boyfriend likes it cooked all the way through)

I found the cooking time to be way off. In my Wolf oven under the broiler, the salmon was over cooked after 8 minutes under the broiler. Boy will I have to be careful with that broiler.

Very easy w/rave reviews. I doubled recipe. Yogurt sauce was prepped 2 hrs ahead and let it come to room temperature to help the flavors emerge. Extra sauce was used as condiment for Curried Sweet Potato Latkes.

Spectacular. I made the sauce in advance, and it didn't thrill me very much when I tasted it, so I was nervous. But something happens when it meets that broiled salmon--just exquisite. I squeezed a little extra orange juice over the salmon before broiling, and finished off the filets in the oven rather than in the broiler. Rave reviews, and not a speck left over.

This is the first time I have not agreed with the reviewers. This was dismal. The sauce just didn't work with the salmon and it wasn't that tasty. Ended up throwing it down the sink.

Really good and delicious dish. Didn't have orange juice so used grapefruit instead. Didn't use water, because sauce seemed to be good consistency without. I added honey until I got it right....but not too sweet. Clearly, the tart of yoghurt + citrus zest + citrus juice were the main flavors. And, boy were they good.

I didn't use any orange in the yogurt sauce, only lime & lemon, and added a bit of dill. A little honey goes a long way, so be careful with it. Served the salmon with corn on the cob and some roasted vegetables to make a delightfully refreshing summery meal.

Easy way to liven up some salmon! I've not been able to find greek yogurt and didn't want to go through the process of putting the plain yogurt through a sieve or paper towel lined colander then chill so I just used the plain, whole yogurt as is and it worked great! I've made it many times with raving reviews from those I served. This dish goes great with the Orzo Risotto recipe!

My wallet could afford a 3 lb salmon fillet...so I used 8oz salmon steaks instead (broil 5 min/side) and it was wonderful. The sauce was excellent! Definitely will make this again. It has a nice result to effort ratio too.

The sauce was easy to make (if you've got a good zester) however when I tasted the sauce without the salmon it tasted un-spectacular and yogurt-y (we used the called-for Greey style yogurt). I ended up doubling the amount of salt and of lime juice and would recommend this alteration. We broiled the salmon with lemon pepper seasoning and the sauce WITH the fish was awesome! It made a great dish to serve at an outdoor party; if our BBQ had worked it would have been even better! You can prepare the sauce in the hours before the party, then grill the fish for a few minutes and you're done. You don't have to spend an hour away from your guest preparing food in the kitchen.

This was excellent. Added a little salt to the sauce. I served this for brunch, and because I didn't have much salmon (1.5 lbs. for 4 ppl) I scrambled four eggs (microwaved each one in a custard cup so they'd have a nice shape--could have poached but didn't), put one egg on top of each serving of salmon and put the sauce on top. Got rave reviews and it looked like something you'd get in a restaurant. Made for an elegant brunch and tasted great.

We loved this too. I cooked the salmon in 1 cup vermouth, 1 cup water, 2 lime slices and 4 peppercorns. This carried the citrus flavor through. I drained whole milk yogurt, I didn't use any honey, it was delicious.

We loved it; took next to no time and there was lots of leftover sauce to be served over grilled eggplant the following day. The sauce might have been even tastier on the eggplant, actually.

This dish is simple and delicious. Hardly any effort at all. Perfect for a summer evening. The sauce was also terrific over the asparagus I served on the side!
