I was reluctant to try this based on the previous review, but did so and changed a few things. I used virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I will use a different oil next time, but that was all that I had. I replaced the shallots with red onions. I also tossed some minced Thai Basil into the dressing. All in all it was good - just a Thai version of a classic tomato salad. The lemongrass was a nice change and provided a good zing. I may increase the amount of the lemon touches next time and opt for a lighter oil.

I couldn't get yellow tomatoes so I used red so I don't know if that made a difference but the taste wasn't worth the considerable effort.
