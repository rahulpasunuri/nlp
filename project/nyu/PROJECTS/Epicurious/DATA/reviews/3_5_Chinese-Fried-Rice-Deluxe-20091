This was okay - I might make it again and add darker soy and hot sesame oil. I had luck with cooking the rice, spreading it out on a sheet pan and sticking it in the fridge for awhile. I added two small carrots and a few extra bamboo shoots. One thing I did not have was shrimp - that probably adds greatly to the overall flavor of the dish.

I haven't made this recipe, yet, but I'm a great judge of ingredients, plus an experienced cook and this looks fantastic. However, a great shortcut that I've used in making my own fried rice, though uncoventional, is to use Uncle Ben's ready rice. It's already cooked, and calls for simply microwaving. I use the brown and wild rice mixture, and don't microwave it; I just add it to the wok or whatever pan I'm making my fried rice in, along with the stir fried ingredients of my choice, so this would be a perfect match for those listed here. One reviewer suggested using duck fat, instead of lard, that sounds scrumptous, assuming you are also going to use pan grilled duck breast as one of the ingredients of your fried rice.

What a great basic recipe. I make this almost weekly, usually using chicken and shrimp. I use part dark Asian sesame oil and add water chestnuts at the end for extra crunch.

I cooked rice first thing and put it in the freezer until I needed it. It was not sticky at all.

I made this recipe because I wanted to use a chicken leftover. Used duck fat and rendered duck skin (sort of like bacon bits) instead of lard. Did not have ham, so compensated with frozen shrimps and chicken leftover. Added Swiss Chard for color. The egg was a great addition. We have leftovers and look forward to eating them!

Please do not use cooked rice left at room temperature overnight!!! There is a bacteria called bacillus cereus (or B. cereus) which releases toxins. Even if you cook the heck out of the rice, it will not eliminate the toxins and you can develop severe vomiting. This is a major cause of food poisoning from Asian take-out. Please always refrigerate rice shortly after cooking if you plan on using it later. Sincerely, Your friendly neighborhood physician

The true secret to real Chinese House fried rice will surprise you. Forget cold cooked rice...what Dorothy is really saying is use stale rice. Put the 2 or 3 cups of cooked fresh rice in a paper bag and leave in your cupboard over night. The results will amaze you the next day. This works and is highly guarded by notable restaurants in and around China Town in The City. (San Francisco, CA)

I like making fried rice. But I always use peanut oil when making. Just what I was taught to do.

I've made this fried rice numerous times. I recommend making it the first time per the recipe. You'll then find yourself making modifications based on your own tastes. I use this almost every time I have leftover meat of any sort.

I loved this recipe. I used more scallions and a bit more soy and in thought it was great. I only used chicken and shrimp.

It's a smple recipe, but the order in which you put things is important. It will be hard to get the 'smoky' flavor if you use brown rice. Sesame oil is a common addition, but a tiny bit (1tbsp) at the end. Using both butter and sesame gives a (admittedly not low calorie) savory well balanced dish..but it should be only 2 tbsp of butter or so. Sprinkling sesame seeds at the end gives a nice toasty flavor. I would add a little more soy, or substitute 1 tablesp extra dark soy (not sweet) for 1 tbsp regular soy.

A good recipe; versatile and simple. I used day-old brown rice, cut oil by one third, and used Seasame oil to add more flavor. Added a bit more soy, and some char siu roast pork from the Chinese restaurant that I just chopped up. Good enough to impress company, but I wonder how the Chinese restaurants get that almost smoky feel, maybe I need higher heat, will try that next time.

This was great! My husband and teen-ager liked it alot. I would echo other reviews to add a little more seasoning. Otherwise, a great way to use up left over veggies.

This is a servicable, if rather bland mother recipe for fried rice. You can ( and will likley have to) tinker with it to add some extra flavour - chile paste / sauce, more soy sauce, etc. Once you get the seasoning right, this is a great way to use up whatever odds and ends you have keft over in your fridge.

Such an old classic, so comforting, and just delicious! Ultra easy and way better than the local restaurant's fried rice!

I modified this recipe to suit our household and was very pleased. Instead of 6 tbs of lard (that seemed crazy greasy!) I went with 4 tbs of sesame oil with a few splashes of Chili Oil. I added sauteed mushrooms, diced onion and waterchestnuts and skipped the ham and was very pleased with the results.

I made this dish for my daughter who is a very picky eater, she loved it and truthfully so did I (and the dog, she picked out the peas). Simple and tasty, go ahead and make this and enjoy the results.

I use recipes like guidelines, never using the exact ingredients. I use what I have, or what I like, and omit what I don't. My favorite local Chinese restaurant uses peas and carrots in theirs, so I used it in mine. It turned out almost exactly like theirs. I'm sure this will become a regular staple in my kitchen now.

This was my first time making Fried Rice. It was fabulous! (and easier than I imagined). I didn't exactly follow the measurements listed (ie I added extra scallions, extra ham, etc.), and omited the chicken and shrimp (because I was too lazy to go buy them). My only negative - it was greasier than I had expected (the one measurement I followed was the 6 Tbs of oil). Other's commented it wasn't very greasy, but I didn't find that to be the case. I will cut down on the oil next time.

a good basic fried rice recipe, without a heavy or greasy feel. A nice compliment to main course.

My kids loved this recipe. My son requested that I make a "Chinese-themed" dinner one night. I skipped a couple of things--no peas, used julienned peapods instead; no bamboo shoots; no roast pork; I used 4 scallions instead of 2; and added garlic and probably 6 tablespoons soy sauce. One note: I used lard in making this and there was a definite film that coated your mouth--yuk. Made it again using vegetable oil and it was absolutely delicious.

Very flexible recipe. I had none of the listed meats so made beef meatballs with my ground beef/ginger/green onions/olive oil/salt and yellow wine(cooking wine). Was Great! No bamboo shoots, used a tomato and cucumbers. You can get the cold rice effect faster if you take off the lid from rice cooker once rice is cooked but still steaming, just stir it up in the cooker.

Super simple to make but taste like you slaved in the kitchen all day! Definite thumbs up! Although the only 'meat' i used was fresh shrimp. Key was...cold rice!

Great recipe. Much better than take-out in that it's not nearly as greasy. I usually eat this with pork, but it tastes great meatless with onion and mushrooms added. Quick and easy to make.

This is my husband's absolute favorite meal! The secret is definitely using COLD rice. I sometimes use jasmine soy sauce for a unique flavor.

Absolutely a do-over! It was so easy and yummy. I didn't do the shrimp and meats but made it a vegetable fried rice instead and tossed in sesame seeds for a "Japanese" flair since I was doing a Japanese style meal. This is by far better than the restuarants because it's not as greasy.

My family totally loved this! I used a bit more bamboo shoots than called for, upped the garlic just a little and added a can of oyster mushrooms. ...and so easy to make -- Who knew?

This really is the MOST delicious fried rice - not at all greasy like takeout fried rice. Easy to vary ingredients to what you prefer or have on hand. Last time I used some sesame oil to saute the veggies (after the egg), and brown rice - to die for!

Turned out great! When I made the rice the day before, I boiled the rice in chicken broth to add flavor. The only meat I used was shrimp and ham...but I imagine it would be fantastic with the rest of the meats. Quick, easy and tasty!

Reminded me of the best fried rice I'd ever had in a restaurant and that's saying something for this quasi-beginner cook! I substituted water chestnuts for bamboo shoots (just a matter of taste) doubled the scallions, added an additional egg and omitted the pork (my fridge was pork-challenged). I also added more Yamasa soy sauce since I love the stuff. Awesome!

We loved this rice, my husband said it was the best rice of any kind he's ever eaten. I made the rice in the morning and chilled it all day then completed the preparation. Great way to use up leftover meat or shrimp, we could easily make a meal out of the rice all by itself!

This is the best fried rice I have ever made. My guests raved about it and could not get enough. I have made it several times after and has consistantly been a success! I used brown (popcorn) rice and did not use bamboo shoots. Its sounds bland, but the flavor was delicious.

Nice way to use leftovers and ingedients that would otherwise end up unused and trashed - don't worry if you don't have the exact ingredients. I used bits and pieces of things left in the crisper - red pepper, chinese pea pods, broccoli, scallions - and the remains of a pork tenderloin. We love pork fried rice and too often the Chinese place delivers white instead - husband is thrilled that I can make an even better version at home.

By the way, if covered in the cupboard the rice, in a brown paper bag, will transform itself. The outcome will astond you. And, none will know how you got that special texture into your house fried rice. Enjoy! Stefano

This is the recipe I've been looking for! I've tried other fried rice recipes and they never seemed right but this one was excellent. I forgot to buy bean sprouts so I omitted those and I substituted snow peas for the green peas and used all pork instead of shrimp and ham. Will definitely be repeating this one.

This is yummy and is a great way to use up leftover meats and veggies. I sauteed some garlic and ginger to start with and added some hot chili oil and rice vinegar (just a dash of each) toward the end to spice it up.
