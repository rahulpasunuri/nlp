This is a great recipe! I used spicy chicken sausage and threw in an apple and an onion. So easy and so delicious.

This is my favorite go-to fall dinner. It's so fast, has a quick clean-up, and is SO delicious. I often add a couple apples in the skillet and love that extra flavor. I also usually use raw spicy Italian sausage, and find that the cooking time is perfect. I also really like the spicy sausage combined with the sweet squash/apples. As a last note for us economical cooks: I'm sure fresh herbs would be even better, but I always use dried since it's in the pantry and it's delicious. It's actually in the oven right now... Smells delicious, can't wait for dinner!

I made this last night and it was demolished by my family. I used 2 1/2 lbs mild Italian sausage, 2 lbs cubed butternut squash, a pinata apple, dried cranberries, a bit of oregano, and 10 cloves of garlic, halved. The rest of the recipe I followed. Superior.

I made this with the creamy polenta recipe too. Came out great. I did leave it in the oven for 45min.

Easy and delicious! It actually took us 45 minutes to get the squash to the right texture, and for the last 15 minutes we covered it with foil so the sausage wouldn't burn. We substituted dried Italian seasoning for the fresh herbs; it was still excellent, though I'm sure it would be even better with fresh herbs. Will definitely make again!

This is a great dish, and smells wonderful when cooking. Although I cooked the sausage before adding into the squash mixture, I didn't brown it, and I think if I had the flavor would have been better. Next time I will do that and also up my veggie to meat ratio.

this was a nice easy fall dinner. Used the Aidells chicken apple sausage, and added a granny smith apple and some vidalia onion to the pan. It needed a little something more - maybe some pepper flakes or some chilis in the pan? Will make again.

Yummy! I used more balsamic than it asked for...

This was fantastic and simple to make. I made it exactly as written with the one exception being I added a diced and peeled lone apple I had laying around to the mix (and I doubled the batch and threw it in a large roasting pan). The flavors of apple, sage and butternut just scream autumn. I served it with Creamy Polenta from this website. It was a huge hit - a great dish to make for company since there is little work involved and all of the chopping can be done ahead of time.

Perfect for an autumn evening. Have made many times. I like to add shallots at the beginning and throw in pine nuts toward the end. One of our favorite "quick" meals.

This dish has a great mix of flavors and is also very visually appealing. I made this dish for a work Thanksgiving potluck. It was the only dish that was completely gone. I added Apple and Cranberry's.

Great and easy. I might add some butter next time as it really brings out the flavor of the squash. Forgot the balsamic and it was tasty. Great reviews from husband and MiL. Even my one-year old like the melt in your mouth squash.

My husband and I both loved this. It couldn't have been easier to make. It seems like it would be very versatile and lend itself to adaptation very well.

This recipe is great for the fact that it can be so easily "dumbed down". Meaning: I didn't have time to get all the ingredients fresh and it still came out yummy! I added vidalia onion, squash, apple, chicken and apple sausage, dried poultry seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper, some peach chardonnay vinegar, and olive oil. 30 min later, I had a super tasty dinner!

I added apples and diced pumpkin for a bit of a more hearty mix. The kids loved it, surprise, surprise! I had to extend the cooking time though but it still was a welcome meal on a cold and windy Cape Cod evening.

Cobbling together from other reviewers' suggestions, I used an andouille chicken sausage, substituted shallots for onion, and added red bell pepper. I also used oregano in place of rosemary. The flavors came together nicely and seem to lend themselves to variation. I look forward to experimenting with different types of sausage, herbs, and aromatics. Easy prep and cleanup sealed the deal.

I have made this for Thanksgiving every year since it was published. For some reason, I did not make it last year and almost forgot how good it is. It's now a staple on my Thanksgiving table! I used Trader Joe's chicken apple sausage this year and always fresh herbs! Finish it off was a very good quality balsamic vinegar.

I loved the easy preparation! And for this reason I will try it again and make some more alterations. I used pumpkin pie pumpkin instead of the squash, and I thought it needed to be a little sweeter. Had I used the butternut squash it might have been sweet enough, but the texture was a bit to simple for me. I loved the fragrant and flavorful herbs. The garlic, which I cut up in chunks added great flavor. It burned a little which was irritating. Next time I make it I will use a combination of sweet potato, white potato and squash, for varying flavor texture. I will also add a little broth so it doesn't burn.

Delicious! I took others' suggestions and added shallots and a couple of apples, as well as a teaspoon each of dried herbs, since I didn't have any fresh on hand. It is a great, easy meal.

Wow!!! what a great recipe! Very simple and truly delicious with a lot of flavor. I didn't have enough squash, so I threw in an apple and a couple shallots to make up for it... a really good addition! I will definitely make it again. I'm eating the leftovers right now... YUM!!

Excellent flavor, easy preparation - woohoo!

What a great recipe. I too added cranberries (I used dried ones) and used oregano instead of sage, because I had it more readily on hand. Also added sweet potato with the squash. I also meant to add some red pepper oil. Thinking my roasted red peppers in a jar were in oil, I added a few tbsp of the liquid they came. I realized later it was actually vinegar - but the dish turned out divine, and next time I will add that vinegar again!

For a quick, easy and relatively lowfat weeknight dinner, this is definitely 4 forks. I diced two medium onions, a red pepper, and a granny smith apple. I forgot to drizzle with the balsamic vinegar, but will try it next time. We served with Trader Joe's whole wheat baguette for a complete meal.

This recipe is easy and delicious! It's a great way to get my boyfriend to eat something other than beef and potatoes...

I am giving 4 forks because this is so easy and so good for a cold winter day. This is simple home cooking at its best. I forgot the balsamic the first time I served it and it was great. The second time I remembered and it added more sweetness. Good both ways. I also added some shallots per anoither reviewer and some cippolini onions. I served with a simple salad and some garlic toast.

I had half of a butternut squash leftover from another recipe and was looking for a way to use it when i found this recipe. It is delicious and simple - perfect fall weeknight dinner. Served it with an arugula and maytag blue salad with pine nuts. Yum!

Rating: 4
I made this for a potluck and it was well-received. I added shallots and 2 russet potatoes to the mix. I also found that additional oil was needed. After 30 minutes at 450, the squash and potatoes were still raw; it's possible that my oven runs cool, but count on at least 45 minutes of baking time. The Gerhard's smoked chicken/apple sausages were delicious and indistinguishable from pork.

Rating: 4
I did a crock-pot version of this: tossed the squash with the herbs, garlic, (everything but the oil) and a 1/2 c. water, added some completely frozen bratwurst on top, left it on low all day. Came home, the brats were brown and tender, the squash was melt-in-your-mouth yummy. Oh, my, yes.

I asked for this recipe after a friend served it to me, and have made it again myself. It is definitely a versatile recipe and allows for innovations, but I like it very much the way it is. The sweet, caramelized taste of the butternut squash goes nicely with the saltiness of the sausage.

Used dried herbs, crushing in a mortar and pestle so that the rosemary would not be woody in this quick-cooking dish. Great flavors, and even our 3-year-old liked it (sans vinegar).

Since the advent of peeled squash in the grocery stores, this is easy and delicious, and what more can one ask? I used chicken sundried-tomato basil sausages, and it was fabulous. I will make this again for sure.

Great, colorful and easily adaptable recipe! I added some cubed potatoes and sliced Okinawan sweet potatoes (which are purple!)just for fun. We grilled some bratwurst we had on hand then cut it up and added it as the sausage.

We made this last night for dinner and even my husband, who does not like winter squash at all, liked it. I added some yukon gold potatoes for his benefit and used pumpkin squash instead of butternut squash since it grows wild in my yard. As it also happens, all of the herbs used in this dish grow in my garden and we usually have some sort of chicken apple sausage in the freezer. We did carmelize about 5 shallots to add to the recipe which really enhanced the flavor. We also served it with wilted spinach which was a perfect side dish. Although we love polenta, it just seemed like too much starch for one meal. I am very happy to find another use for our pumpkin squash which we generally substitute in any recipe that asks for butternut squash. One of the other cooks who reviewed this recipe suggested other vegetables and I think this is a great suggestion. I will try some maui onions and parsnips next time. We will probably eat this frequently since we usually have most of the ingredients and the recipe seems to adapt very well to other additions.

Oh so gourmet! I've made this dish a couple of times: the first, I added some leftover parsnip and yam (nice), but had to make do with regular Italian sausage; the second, added two empire apples and used chicken-green apple sausage from Trader Joe's--all worked, but the second sausage was superior in this recipe. Bonus: fills the house with a gorgeous smell!

This was outstanding! The chicken sausage and butternut squash combo really made the meal. I added three large Idaho baking potatoes prebaked in the microwave for 3 min (since roasting time is only 30) in order to bulk it up to feed 8. The whole house smelled wonderful, and not a smidgeon was left. A heartier meal could include parsnips and baby carrots. Or you can leave out the sausage entirely and use all veggies to create a great side dish with roasted chicken. Definitely a keeper recipe for the winter season.

This was SO easy ... a great weeknight meal for a cold night. Good too! I used sun-dried tomato & basil sausages. Used dried herbs instead of fresh (1 tsp of each). Served with steamed red chard. Drizzled that with the balsamic vinegar too. Be sure to use a GOOD quality balsamic vinegar; it makes a big difference.
