As an apple lover, this was a must bake for me. The bread recipe is okay, the apples were not flavorful enough and created too much moisture. The second time around, I used my own challah recipe, used a spice combination with sugar on the apples and made sure to drain all of the juice off of the apples. This was a winning combination. Also, I proofed the dough overnight before shaping my loaf. I made it into a braid that turned out beautifully. I found that an egg wash (50/50 with water) and turbinado sugar were just the right touch for the bread to turn out exceptionally well.

Followed recipe, ended up using 6 small appleas and added 4 chopped dates. To speed things up, I shaped the loafs and placed them in the baking pans to rise. Once they were doubled in size I just placed the pans in the oven. I thought the taste was great, not too sweet and they looked great. Will definitly bake again.

I followed the instructions... Very long process for a very very mediocre product... It is now too late to try another recipe... So we will have a dry... Pretty bland apple challah for Rosh Hashana... Hope this isn't how the rest of my year will turn out! Shana Tova!

I make challah regularly, and wanted to make something special for Rosh Hashanah. This recipe was a hit! People actually tracked me down after the oneg to rave about the apple challah! I didn't follow the directions with regard to adding the fruit. Just rolled it out and added mixture of apples & raisins near the end closest to me, rolled over the mixture, added more, rolled again, etc. until I had a long strand. I shaped it into a spiral form and it rose beautifully and had great distribution of fruit and the flavor was nice if a little sweet...perfect for the holiday. I will definitely make this again.

Not a great challah recipe although its a good light apple tart. The dough doesn´t taste like challah and the apple filling is preatty dull.

This challah was good, but I followed the directions exactly and ended up with big clumps of apple in some places and none in others. I might try kneading the apples in in a different way next time. I also used Granny Smith, which were a little too sour. Next time I'll try the Braeburns. Overall, my weekly challah recipe is faster and equally delicious, but for high holidays this could work.

I've made this twice. The second time I followed the recipe exactly, except for dicing the apples into smaller chunks, and the first time I added some raisins to one of the loaves (when I added the apples). This is one of the richest, most delicious challahs I've ever made. It was a star attraction on Rosh Hashanah and is great any time of year if you're in the mood for a rich treat. I particularly like it when it's turned into french toast. It's turned out so beautifully both times--it's a show-stopper of a bread.

Excellent, attractive, festive. The dough handles very well and shaping the loaves was much easier than I expected. By my calculation, though, 2 pkts of yeast = 1 1/2 tblsp (1 Tbl+ 1 1/2 tsp) total.

Absolutely fabulous recipe! Instructions were clear, easy to follow and the resulting challah was well worth making. A beautiful bread -- tastes as good as it looks.

This was delicious and the detailed instructions were very good. I did not let the loaves rise in the fridge overnight. 45 minutes bake time was just a little too long--nest time I'll take them out after 30-35. Use coarse sugar for a beautiful topping.

This is an excellent recipe. The key to great results is the quality of the ingredients and the weighing of same. The overnight fermentation is what gives this bread it's longer life and wonderful flavour. In my books this is a good formula.

I really like this recipe, but I take issue with the suggestion to let the dough sit overnight in the refidgerator. When I did that, the dough ended up dry and the apples tasted slightly alcoholic. Preparing and baking the dough on the same day produced a moist bread with a much better apple flavor. If you keep it in the pan and cover it with plastic wrap, it'll keep for a day, so you can still make it ahead of time.

I was surprised at the reviews of this. I found the dough extremely bland and dry. I would suggest fining another recipe (maybe one that makes sweeter dough). Good luck!

This bread was fantastic and the dough was surprisingly easy to roll out and fold up. We used it for french toast the next morning- delcious!

Recipe can easily be halved. For a novice challah maker, easy to prepare and tastes delicious. Sprinkled apples with cinnamon before adding to dough. Decreased salt to 2 tsp.

This dough was easy to prepare and turned out beautifully. I checked at 40 min. and the loaves were golden (but I also used black cake pans)and finished. I also sprinkled the apples with a little sugar, cinnamon (because I really enjoy the combination) and fresh nutmeg. Smelled heavenly and tasted wonderful. Can't wait to toast some and have it with apple butter.
