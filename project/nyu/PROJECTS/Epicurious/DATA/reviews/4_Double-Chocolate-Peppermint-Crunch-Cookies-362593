This has become my go-to Christmas cookie recipe. I have come up with some adaptations that make it the best cookie around - as evidencedby the fact that it won first place for taste at my neighborhood cookie exchange! For starters, I wrap the dough around half of a small peppermint patty, which I pre-cut and freeze ahead of time, and which gives the cookie a lovely demilune shape. Then I bake them at 350 degrees instead of 375. I also reduce the peppermint extract to just 1/2 teaspoon since the peppermint patty center gives it more than enough minty taste on its own. Finally, I drizzle white chocolate as well as dark chocolate on the tops as a garnish. The result is beautiful to look at before eating and also pretty when you bite into them because they have a lovely white stripe in the center.

I made this recipe minus the crushed candy canes for a New Year's Eve party this year. Everyone loved these cookies! They were the perfect blend of chocolate with just a hint of mint. Highly recommend!

I made these cookies twice this year. First time yielded 36, second time 42 (used more choco chips). Used a Tbsp cookie scoop. Definitely want to roll them into a ball to keep them pretty. I substituted Starbucks VIA Italian Roast coffee for espresso powder. I also spread some Semi-sweet chocolate on top instead of drizzling. Melted chocolate in microwave...easier. They were a big hit!!! I will hold onto this recipe for for next Christmas.

Hard to beat these for beauty and flavor!! One person I shared them with exclaimed - "these taste just like Christmas"!! Like several other reviewers I ended up with around 30 or so cookies (used a #40 ice cream scoop which is just a tad over 1 Tbsp) but considered the cookies the perfect size. Also used an off-set spatula to spread the reserved chocolate on top of the the cooled cookies. Like many others I had extra chocolate left over - so spread it on a piece of parchment with the off-set spat and then sprinkled with the crushed peppermint that was also left over - so I got peppermint bark in addition to beautiful and tasty cookies. As in most recipes the key is good quality ingred (chocolate, vanilla and peppermint extract). Will definitely be adding these to the list of Christmas cookie must makes!!

I made these cookies with my 5 year old son. OMG, these cookies are delicious! Very pretty and festive and reminds me of a soft, chewy brownie with a minty, chocolate icing. Yummy!!!! We gave it to his Kindergarten teacher for a Christmas gift. We were planning to give the rest to friends but they were so good our family ate them all ;)

When I made this, I did not get 50 cookies, I only got around 32-34 cookies. I also only used about 1/3 cup of the reserved chocolate. Unless you want to drizzle a lot of chocolate or dunk half the cookie, just save a 1/3 cup of melted chocolate for the top. Otherwise, it is a great holiday cookie!

I thought the recipe was more trouble than the result was worth, but that could be my lack of time to be a consummate baker! The melted chocolate didn't turn out to be something that could be drizzled so I used a fork to essentially paste some on top of each cookie. I used semisweet mixed with a very nice 71%, maybe overall too sweet in the end, not sure yet. Way too much leftover. It would be helpful to know how much melted chocolate should get mixed in, rather than knowing that 2/3rds cup should be left for topping later.... I used minichips in the cookies, a good choice I think. And I used a small amount of quality decaf french vanilla fine coffee grounds instead of expresso powder, which I couldn't find. I also used more vanilla and just a small amount of peppermint oil as the stores were out of extract and I didn't want too strong a peppermint flavor. And instead of candy canes, I crushed for the top a high quality peppermint bark (with dark chocolate, white chocolate and peppermint candy sprinkled on top) so it is less pretty (i.e. less red) but also less strongly peppermint-y. I also was in a rush with only one day off to do 9 bazillion things and so in my haste mixed ingredients in the wrong order (misread the instructions) but it doesn't seem like that made any difference. The dough rolled beautifully into balls without refrigeration - not sticky at all. I only got 27 cookies from the recipe, cooked 9 minutes per batch. I was hoping this could be a new go to recipe but I don't think I will make it again.....Now back to the kitchen to tackle the cleanup!

Am I really the first one to get distracted and accidentally add ALL the melted chocolate into the cookies? Two toddlers... My conundrum is that these cookies were so good I'm afraid that when I make my second batch tomorrow I am going to have to make that same "mistake" again! For those considering leaving out the espresso powder, please don't: it enhances the chocolate flavor and imparts no coffee notes. Delish. Also, I used peppermint oil (purchased from King Arthur Flour) in lieu of the peppermint extract, and peppermint snow from Williams-Sonoma instead of crushing candy canes. These just sing Christmas!

Delicious and easy! Made for a cookie exchange, made 40 per batch. Will definitely make again.

Great cookie recipe that's easy to make and very delicious. I substituted semisweet chocolate and about 3/4 c sugar. I also stuck the candies on with frosting instead of more chocolate. The cookies are fudgy and rich and have a great texture. Definitely better than the cookies we ate over the holidays!

New favorite cookie!!! Most requested recipe this holiday. Just used cookie scoop for first half & they were fine, but I rolled the other half before baking & they came out prettier. Froze well even after chocolate & peppermint toppings. Will be making every Christmas!

Awesome! Didn't drizzle the chocolate but instead dipped half a cookie and then sprinkled with the candy canes. Only draw back is despite measuring the tablespoons exactly, I only got 36 cookies not 50.

These cookies are fancy! Dynamic flavors. I got Pillsbury peppermint icing, heated it in the microwave and dipped half the cookie in it before drizzling with chocolate & dotting with peppermint pieces. Very beautiful.

I just made these and they are delicious even without topping. Very like brownies. Trick is not to overcook them. Only 7 minutes for me. Just until crackled and still shiny. Overdid the first batch and they are dry and cakey. Can't wait to add chocolate and candy cane. BTW, you have to love mint -- they are very minty !!

Yum. Really great chocolate flavor. Don't over-bake for the perfect fudgy texture to contrast with the peppermint crunch.

These are fantastic cookies. I think the espresso helps tone down the sweetness. I added a few extra drops of peppermint extract, too. These will be a favorite, for sure.

Really delicious! Easy recipe, just a bit time consuming. I prefer chewy cookies so I only baked each batch for 7 minutes. They don't spread out much when you bake them. Also, the one tip I have is that when you are ready to drizzle the chocolate over the cookies, make sure the cookies are not touching. I made that mistake and once the chocolate hardens and you pull them apart, they don't look as pretty because you end up tearing off sides of the cookies. Rookie mistake! Otherwise, yummy, minty cookie. Recommended!

These were a huge hit! I've been looking for a recipe like this for years. Used 1/2 butter 1/2 oil because I hate spread-y cookies. Switch it up and use a candy cane Hershey's kiss- heaven!

These were tasty, pretty, sturdy, certainly festive for the season, but I found them a little bit cake-y compared to my cookie ideal, and the "double" chocolate might be a bit much; I might try a white chocolate topping instead.

These were delicious. Very moist and fudgy and stayed so a week later. I also didn't use the candy canes but instead put mint hershey kisses on top when they were fresh from the oven. Also left off the chocolate drizzle as seemed rich enough. Very good.

@ Xmas time - Hersey sells kisses in white chocolate with red stripes - like a candy cane. Before baking, I placed one of these in center of each cookie, covering with the cookie dough. Incredible!!!!

These were excellent. I used a 12 oz pkg of Ghiradeli chocolate chips and a 4 oz bar of Ghiradeli baking chocolate. I reserved the 2/3 cup of melted chocolate to drizzle on top, I barely used 1/3 cup. Using a cookie scoop (a little more than 1 tablespoon), the recipe made approx 30. Mine looked more like mounds, I rolled them in balls, I will make these again! Loved them

Oh my goodness these are fabulous cookies! I did make a few modifications. I left out the espresso powder as I hate coffee and wasn't sure how strong that would make the cookies. I also used semi- sweet chips. Other than those changes, I followed the directions. This recipe has just the right amount of peppermint.I got 40 cookies using the tbspn method it says to do in the recipe. I highly, highly recommend these. Even my husband, who is not crazy about peppermint, liked them!

Wonderful! Everyone loved them! My only suggestion is to add a little water when crushing your candy-canes in the food processor...this resulted in more peppermint chunks and less peppermint powder.

Delicious! I've made these twice now, and both times they were a hit. The recipe calls for an annoying amount of bittersweet chips (more than one bag, less than two) so I just bought one bag and used that to melt, then used semi-sweet chips to stir in at the end. I couldn't tell the difference. The second time I made them I couldn't find any bittersweet chips and just melted down baking squares for the batter, and used the semi-sweet chips at the end, again no difference. My mom-n-pop grocery didn't have instant espresso powder, so I substituted 2.5 tsp of instant coffee with great success. The hardest part was getting those pretty peppermint crumbles- my first attempt was more like peppermint dust. I wised up and used a rolling pin with the candy between layers of paper towels the second time and had better luck. I also didn't have any parchment paper the first time, and just used my baking sheets. At the time I thought they were fine, but they definitely came out better the second time around when I DID use the paper (no sticky bottoms!).

A definite keeper. The peppermint isn't overpowering at all -- just a hint that lets the chocolate take the lead.

Very very good! Just a few comments: 1) Chill the dough for 20 minutes or so before balling it. Dough will be easier to work with and less messy. 2) I generally follow recipes precisely (drives me nuts when people change a recipe, then complain...) but in this case I left out the espresso powder because I didn't have any. Recipe was delightful nonetheless. 3) I had only individually-packaged mini candycanes in the house. I used a hammer to break them up while they were still in the packages, then tipped them all out into a bowl. No mess. I ended up using more canes than I expected, mostly because with extras, you can be less precise about trying not to spill any off the sides of the cookies. Just sprinkle and discard whatever doesn't land on a cookie. :-) 4) I saw that someone said they didn't get anywhere near 50. I, otoh, ended up with 60. I rolled them small - balls about an inch in diameter. Little one bite wonders! Will definitely make these again.

I followed the recipe exactly. Delicious! I will be making these every Xmas but next time I'll put more crushed candy cane on half the recipe for those that want a more intense flavor. Its given me a template to experiment with maybe orange peel and flavoring.

Great cookie and just perfect for the holidays! Only changes I made were to use 2-1/4 Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips and 2-1/4 Ghiradelli milk choc chips -- all melted in lieu of reserving 1/2 cup chips for dough. Then I melted 3/4 cup white chocolate for the drizzle at the end. Can't wait to make them again!

The cookies were great, however, I found the recipe cumbersome and will definitely rewrite the recipe before I use it again. I only had 2 cups of semi-sweet choc. chips so didn't fold in chips to batter at the end, it didn't matter as they were still fantastic. My daughter wouldn't have the espresso powder in the cookie so I did without it. Next time I will include it and I'm sure she will enjoy them regardless. They tasted like a one bite brownie with peppermint topping. DELICIOUS.

Deliciously moist and chocolatey! I would imagine that these would go really well with a Peppermint mocha from Starbucks...mmmm...Anyways, I would agree with previous reviewers that they do come out a little on the smaller side and definitely not anywhere close to 50. I got exactly 2 dozen out of mine and I thought I were making them pretty large but they just didn't spread out. Still a keeper though!

Rating: 3
These were a hit with my husband and the five kids who were here yesterday. I'm taking them to a cookie exchange tonight. They look very festive, but are kind of on the small side. Be very careful not to overcook them -- chocolate is not forgiving that way. The only change I'd probably make is to use mini chocolate chips when adding to the batter -- the large bittersweet chips I used meant they didn't get dispersed so equally.

Rating: 4
So pretty! I also had to chill the dough to get it to roll. I ended up just dropping the dough by the spoonful on the cookie sheet instead. Worked great! I was missing a few ingredients, but came up with some great substitutes: 1.)Parchment...I went without and baked these on an ungresed baking sheet with no problems. 2.)Enough chocolate chips to stir in the batter...I used mostly white chocolate chips plus what I had left of the chocolate chips. Love the contrast of the colors, might do all white choco next time. 3.)Instant Espresso Powder...I live in a small town that does not sell this. I ground a nice dark french roast coffee into a powder with a mortar and pestle and treated this as instant espresso powder. To finish these cookies, I smeared them with the melted choco (not drizzled) and topped with crushed mini candy canes. I used a mesh strainer to sift out the pinkish sugar I had from crushing the candy so all I was left with was the pretty broken candy pieces. These are delicious. I will definately make these again and again!

Nice taste ... used 6 drops peppermint essential oil instead of peppermint extract. Unfortunately all mine had black bottoms ... would recommend to reduce heat to 350 for 7-8 mins. Also would reduce sugar by 1/3. Will make again though!

These were good. I used chopped peppermint Hershey's kisses instead of crushed candy canes. I found it a bit difficult working with the melted chocolate chips and may try and adapt this recipe to use chocolate squares. The recipe didn't make 50 - I only got 30 but that's likely because my scoop is bigger than 1 T. Slightly flattening the cookies before baking would probably help with the spread. I will probably make these again before the season is over.

This is a great Christmas cookie recipe!! It has a rich, deep chocolate taste, enhanced even more by the coffee!! We used Ghiradelli chocolate chips, and instand coffee powder. To tone it down for the kids' tastes, you might use semi- sweet or milk chocolate in the cookies, and save the bittersweet for the drizzle on top.

I have many good chocolate cookie recipes that I use in my christmas cookie baking but this recipe was by far the best! I followed the recipe exactly minus the espresso powder which I forgot to buy. I wanted to bring some into work tomorrow for friends but my kids and husband begged me not to- they do not want to share. The recipe is time consuming but worth the effort.I used ghirardelli chocolate chips but the bag did not have the 2 1/2 cups that the recipe called for. Luckily I had some hersey dark chocolate chips on hand. These were awesome and will make again for friends and relatives.
