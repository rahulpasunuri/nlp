After reading reviews I really wanted to see if I could make this work. I used cinnamon raisin bread instead of plain buttermilk bread to try and add more sweetness without more white sugar. I think it helped, but definitely agree that this works better as a brunch item rather than a dessert.

Yuck. Tasted like stale and soggy buttermilk bread. I didn't make the strawberry sauce but I don't think it would have helped. I've tasted a bread pudding made with cream which was infinitely better but of course much more fattening.

I skipped the strawberry sauce, but I thought this was pretty blah. And not sweet enough.

Nice, light weekday dessert. Not to be confused with real rich bread pudding, but when looking for something less guilty, this definately works.

Great pudding! I see the breakdown as 187 cal, 4 g fat, etc. per 1/6 serving.

this recipe has two different calorie, fat, and colesterol charts, one right on top of the other, which is the correct breakdown??????
