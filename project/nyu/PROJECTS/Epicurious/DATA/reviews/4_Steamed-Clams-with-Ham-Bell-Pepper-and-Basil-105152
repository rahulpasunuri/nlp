It's good except for the unnecessary amount of oil. 6 tb of butter? That's pretty out of control these days. Just use bacon or tasso or something without any oil - just render the fat and use thatt for the peppers and garlic. I'd also up the garlic to around 6 cloves and increase the crushed red pepper to 1 tsp for that amount of clams (5#).

This made me so happy! Very easy and a good base recipe that you can modify based on availability or whim--sauteed chopped bacon instead of ham, for example. We grilled slices of ciabatti to dunk in the sauce. We have a house on the North Carolina coast and I can't leave the seafood market without clams now!

Absolutely delicious. I used pancetta instead of the ham, and it was wonderful.

I made this for a birthday this weekend. WOW. Everyone loved it. I wonder what it would taste like over pasta?

My husband and I tried this recipe last summer. It has become an ABSOLUTE favorite!! We live on Cape Cod and eat steamers often. This is a real treat!

Really good. Also made with chirizo cut into small cubes, which changed the flavor, but was still outstanding.

Love this recipe, first had it at a friends house and asked her for it. We've used prosciutto instead of smoked ham, which enhances the flavor even more. Have also served this over pasta. Delicious!!
