A bit too starchy for my liking.

This recipe is just o.k. It's definitely missing a few things -- something to give it depth (cream?) and sweetness (brown sugar?). Even so, it's probably not worth the work involved.

Unbelievably delicious and so simple to make. The apples add a nice tartness to the traditional yams.

Haven't made this, but might I suggest a tad of cream and freshly grated ginger? Apples don't make for a creamy texture and while they act as a natural sweetener this dish would certainly need some spice. Maybe a pinch of nutmeg also, but ginger would make a big difference.

This was delicious, yet could have been better.Super easy to make. I will double it next time -- sadly we had no leftovers. I didn't give it the full 4 forks because like the other reviewers I thought it was missing something. I wonder if adding a little chicken stock would help?

I am so sorry, but this was awful! I never review negatively, but this was inedible.

Easy and quick.

A great substitute for boring mashed potatoes. I felt it was missing something though, perhaps a mild herb. I may try adding a bit of fresh thyme or sage next time.

This was just ok. Chose it for Thanksgiving and as the jams were boiling I realized that baking would bring out the sweetness of the jams more. In addition to the spices called for, I added some ground ginger and a drizzle of maple syrup. THat helped make it a bit more complex, but it was still lack luster.

good inspiration for a great side dish. yams and apples, i had some Boursein cheese butter infused with roasted garlic olive oil all whipped up so i tossed the apple in the pan for ten min or so with the butter cheese garlic combo. skipped the all spice and cinnn and whipped in the food processor with half and half. served with stuffed pork tenderloin with a white wine mushroom gravy. i prefer yams savory. the texture was velvet. sublime!

This dish was a bomb. I doubled it for a big crowd so I was stuck with twice the regular amount to throw away. I made it exactly as printed but it was really blah so I tried adding a bit of brown sugar and a squirt of maple syrup. Didn't help. There are MUCH better ways to use yams.

I made this following all of the instructions except I didn't find a need to dry the potatoes as I let them sit in a collander for a bit while I was making another dish. Their own heat dried them nicely. When it was complete, I tasted it and found it to be lacking in flavor. Maybe it was the yams I used, but I like my sweet potatoes to be a little sweet. I should note that I doubled the recipe as well. So after tasting I added about 1/4 c of light brown sugar and another half stick of butter(total of 4 lbs of potatoes and two apples), since the potatoes seemed a little dry. I think the addition of fresh squeezed orange juice might have been nice too. Next time I will add more apples as well. This went over very well for our thanksgiving dinner. Everyone liked them.

I made this for my son's Daycare Thanksgiving Feast this year (2004) and the kids loved it. Nothing was left. I plan on making it for their Christmas Party!

Although this was tasty (yams/apples are a great combo!)it was lacking in presentation, especially for a holiday dinner and I think would be more suited to a casual week-night supper. For special or holiday occasions, try this variation: Bake yams in the skin (or boil if you are short of time), scoop out and mash with a little butter until smooth. Butter a quiche pan or shallow casserole dish. Spread half the mashed yams in the dish, cover with a layer of thinly sliced/peeled apples arranged in a spiral/over-lapping fashion, squeeze lemon juice over the apples so they don't discolour, sprinkle with a little brown sugar and cinnamon, dot with butter. Repeat the layers once more ending with the apples. May be made to this point the day before, then refrigerated and brought to room temperature before finishing. Bake uncovered at 350 degrees about 30 min. or until edges begin to bubble and apples are tender and golden. Voila! You now have a special yam/apple dish that is every bit as delicious as it looks. Even die-hard yam haters will love it. An excellent side dish with turkey or chicken, pork or ham. The best part? No yucky marshmallows! Enjoy!

Superb. This was a great hit at Thanksgiving Dinner. I made it a day early and then reheated it for dinner. I made it exactly as instructed. It was excellent.

This is a delicious dish and very easy for company. Modified easier, tastier version: place cooked cubed yams and apples on large rimmed cookie sheet - sprinkle with the all-spice and cinnamon - cover and put aside until 15 minutes before serving. Put uncovered in oven at 350 for ten minutes. Melt butter in large pot over low heat. Add the yams and apples, salt and course ground pepper to taste and beat with a mixer. This is easier and the texture is lovely - it also mellows and blends the spices more.

I didn't find this recipe as tasty as it was rated. I thought it was tasty, but sort of like pablum after it came out of the food processor. I tested this one along with the maple-glazed yams with orange and cranberries (for a dinner party)and I liked that one better.

This is such comfort food, I love it! next time, I will add a little more all spice and maybe a little cardamom... It needed a little bit of a kick for me? but it was still really sweet and good. Next time, I will bake them instead of boiling them and I also didn't use the food processor, and just mashed them with the potato masher.

Wow!! I made this for Christmas dinner to go along with the lamb, and they were a big hit. I never had mashed yams before, so I did not know what to expect. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was a hit! I baked the yams and apples instead of boiling. When the yams were about 30 minutes from being done I added quartered apples. When everything was cool enough to handle I peeled the yams and apples and then followed the recipe.

If you like yams, this is a good one. I didn't like the texture of it by using the processor. I think the texture is much more interesting by passing through a potatoe press or just mashing with a fork.

Made this for my dad on Father's Day, with the lamb recipe recommended. It was a great hit with everyone. I had never made or eaten yams before, but I imagine I'll be having them quite a bit now! Didn't make any changes, great the way it is

This dish is great! It is so fresh tasting! I work at a Montessori school in a classroom of 1st - 3rd graders and we made it for our "formal" lunch today. While there were a few staunch anti-sweet potato types in our class, overwhelmingly those who tried it liked it. I quadrupled the recipe to feed all the kids (which required two big pots for the boiling). This recipe is simple and quick enough that the kids could help with most of it (we omitted the reheating after mashing). It is fabulous!

WOW. wow wow wow wow wow! I don't like yams but made this because it was recommended with the lamb, and I needed some other dish. What a surprise! I loved it, especially with the port red wine sauce... and so did the other 7 people at dinner! However, you must know that I didn't follow the recipe exactly: when I tasted it in the pot, it was really bland for my taste, so I added a lot more (probably ended up being about another teaspoon) cinnamon, and some brown sugar... probably about 1/4 cup. It was delicious.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving, my two-year old kept begging for more! (And everyone else too). I baked the yams at 350 degrees for one hour and cooked the apples with a little water on a pot on the stove until they were soft and then drained them. It didn't need any butter.
