This was very good! I made this pretty much as stated. Except I added a roasted red pepper and some sliced green olives which I have often seen in picadillo. I also thought I'd do a "South American thing" so I served it with quinoa instead of making a sandwich. I'll definately make it again!

This was easy and good. I will make again sometime.

Easy and delicious! The chili powder, cinnamon,balsamic vinegar, and most of all raisens (I used golden) combined for a refreshingly different taste.

Very good. Very easy. Do think it needs a seeded and minced fresh jalapeno and a teaspoon of salt. Family loved it.

Excellent and so easy. Made it exactly as the recipe states. Definitely a winner!

I used Mexican style canned tomatoes, because that's what was in my cupboard, and my family loved this. I will follow the recipe a little closer next time because I think it will be sweeter with no jalepeno kick. This was fairly simple to make and it is basically a Cuban Sloppy Joe. It serves well as left-overs too.

Double the hamburger and add a quarter cup of beef broth then put the blue cheese and lettuce on a whole wheat bun. and this is fun for the whole family,

I used Rotel Tomatoes to give this meal an extra kick. An easy, tasty weeknight supper

This was a wonderful weeknight dish! Thanks so much to lizwhatsit for the suggestion to throw in the jalapeno chili. I did a fine dice of a fresh chili and threw it in when I added the liquids, not with the onion and meat. This dish reminds me of Lala's in Tampa; home cookin' by a Cuban gramma! Forget your "Sloppy Joes".

I am making it as I write and I don't even need to wait for it to be finished to know a winner when I see one. I recommend throwing in a few chopped jalapenos or other hot pepper for added pizzazz.
