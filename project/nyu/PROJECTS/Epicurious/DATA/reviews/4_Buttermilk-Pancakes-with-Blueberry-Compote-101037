I'm giving four forks to the pancakes. I didn't make the compote. Very nice tangy flavor mixed with the abundance of vanilla. I really like these pancakes! Will definitely be making often.

I made these well at least I attempted to make these for brunch this morning. The mixture was different from what I usually make, cooking these were difficult they could not flip easily. Now I did not have a griddle but used a good iron pan, even after cooking for the recommended time they were not cooked inside. We ended up throwing them out and went for croissants instead (one of the benefits of living across from a bakery. It's a shame the outer edges that cooked properly were delicious. I did make the compote and that was lovely.

This conserve tastes fresh and flavorful. I made it with fresh blueberries and adjusted the time a little to compensate. Ideal xylitol sweetener was used for diabetic diet. It is a wonderful treat and tastes as good as or better than sugar sweetened product. Yum. I add a little cinnamon sometimes.

I've tried many different pancake recpies, and my dad said this one is the best so far. It must be the sour cream ;) It was a little trickier to cook for one treason or another, but it is definitely my new go-to pancake. Oh, and the compote is wonderful of course.

I can see that these pancakes could be great. And clearly everyone loves them. I love making pancakes and am generally very good at it. But I can't get the center to cook on these. What temp should the griddle be at? I've done these twice and I'm getting perfect golden outsides with yucky gooey insides.

A full circle pancake story...When I first made these pancakes and compote, I absolutely flipped over the pancakes...the compote was good, but not over the top for me. For the past couple of years I have been making the pancakes (but no compote) and adding fun "mix ins", such as butterscotch chips with sliced toasted almonds...or even chopped Oreos. Our best friend Denise and her son were visiting New York last week, and had the Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes at a place called Clinton St. Bakery...anyway, from their phone they sent me a pic of the most beautiful stack of pancakes with an appealing blueberry compote. After drooling from the picture, I decided to re-think the blueberry topping from this recipe. I followed a reviewers suggestion by adding more sugar...I used 1/2 cup. I also added 1 1/2 Tb. Grand Marnier to the finished compote. OHMYGAWD...The bestestpancakesontheplanet!

Great recipe! Only got milk? no problem! I managed to simplify this recipe and make it more cost effective. I didn't have either buttermilk or sour cream in my fridge so I used milk instead and I added a cap full (or less) of white vinegar as a sub for the buttermilk. The vinegar actually reacted with the eggs and foamed immediately. This resulted with even fluffier pancakes! so delicious and better than shop-made premixed! You don't taste vinegar and it's a great sub for buttermilk.

These pancakes were amazing. We have some pretty picky pancake aficionados, and these went over with huge reviews. The only thing we added was some homemade whipped cream.

This ended up being delicious and very low in calories. I only had non-fat milk and buttermilk powder, and I substituted Splenda for the sugar. My husband loves blueberry pancakes but not blueberry sauce, so I put blueberries on the batter as I cooked the pancakes and served with maple syrup. They were even better this morning in the toaster oven without any sauce.

WOW! I made these this morning and they are out of this world. Be sure not to overmix and they will be super fluffy. I did not make the compote and it wasn't missed. These couldn't be easier to make!

Excellent! Followed recipe except I only had 1 1/2 cup sour cream so I made up the difference with 1/2 cup half-n-half. Also, I sprinkled a pinch of cinnamon-sugar mixture on each pancake while cooking. They were very moist and had a sweet and tangy taste that was superb. The compote pairs exceptionally well with these. I highly recommend making both recipes.

I made these pancakes this morning and have to agree with the four fork review - easy and really tasty. One thing to note - if you are planning on adding fresh fruit to the batter, depending upon how sweet the fruit is, you can use less sugar in the receipe. I definite keeper for my recipe box!

These were great and the compote was excellent. This was a success for a Sunday breakfast. The batter was a bit thick, so I added a little more buttermilk. I also had to use a lower temperature than medium because the pancakes cooked too fast on the outside.

These are wonderful! I used half the vanilla, but that was the only change I made to either the pancake recipe or the compote. Yes, they were rich but I'm not going to serve them everyday. The pancakes held nicely on a cookie sheet in a 200 degree oven while I cooked all the batter, too.

Sorry to bring the reviews down, but these were just too rich for me. I also felt there was too much vanilla extract. I would recommend cutting vanilla in half if you want to give these a try. I did not try the blueberry compote.

I also made just the pancakes with my own fruit topping and they were wonderful! I used only half the vanilla because I ran out, and I also used plain all natural nonfat yogurt in place of the sour cream and still thought they were very rich. I halved the recipe and even still ended up with 12 nice sized pancakes. They were very light and fluffy though so if you are used to a thicker more hearty pancake, these are not what you are looking for.

This is the ultimate pancake recipe. Once you try it, there is no going back. I prepared it several times exactly as it is written, but then I adjusted it just slightly to make it absoulutely perfect. Use 3t baking powder, 1t baking soda, 3/4t salt, and 2t vanilla and the pancakes will be even better. Since I made these adjustments, many years ago, I have cooked these for breakfast almost every Sunday, and my family has never tired of them. Oh, and while the blueberry compote is good, I rarely bother to make it. These are wonderful with pure maple syrup.

We loved these pancakes, we didn't use the blueberry compote, instead did chocolate chips. My daughter said they tasted just like chocolate chip cookies ;) Really, make them! They're easy and they're delicious. Next time...the compote!!!

I made these for Easter Brunch and they were delicious. The texture is more crepelike than pancake like, which i like. However, I'm not sure the vanilla is necessary, or the sugar. I think either much less vanilla and no sugar would be better next time. The maple syrup or compote offers enough sweetness, i think. Still, a great recipe for its texture and crowd-pleasing aroma.

I had to make a number of substitutions on this because we made it on New Year's Day when everything but the local convenience store was closed. I subbed 1% milk for buttermilk and plain yogurt for sour cream. I also halved the recipe. And it turned out great. Best pancakes I've had in a long time, and maybe a bit healthier than the original recipe would've been, although who cares about that on New Year's Day.

Excellent. The best pancakes I have made and now a household favourite. Recipe can be halved without problem. Also, I tend to use more sugar than is called for because my fiance likes sweet pancakes.

These pancakes were fantastic. They were fluffy and sweet and really tasty. I didn't have vanilla extract but I had vanilla paste, which worked really wonderfully. I also used lowfat buttermilk and lowfat sour cream which was absolutely fine--no sign of the missing fat in the taste. I served them with maple syrup I cooked with blackberries a la a Gourmet recipe and it was perfect. My boyfriend loved them, too! I highly recommend these.

I am always looking for ways to make yummy recipes to turn into healthy recipes as far as fat and healthy carbohydrates go. I used 1 cup of freshly ground whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup of all purpose flour. I Added 1 tsp. of ground flax seed to the flour mixture. I made this recipe this morning for breakfast just myself and four kids so I ½ the recipe and accidentally added two eggs instead of one. They were so light and fluffy just like as if I used white flour. They are yummy healthy pancakes and light and fluffy to. I will always make these for our family as well as company.

Instead of using a compote, I put fresh blueberries into the pancakes and they were outstanding. Everyone loved them.

Found these too doughy and sweet and that the flavor competed with the toppings. Thinning out the batter and making them smaller helped, but there were still an awful lot left over after brunch. Will keep looking for a simpler, healthier version.

This is now the standard recipe for pancakes at our house. I have used non-fat sour cream, or deleted the sour cream and used 3C. of buttermilk. One day I even soured my own milk, using 1T. vinegar per cup of milk. I also love to use half whole wheat flour, and since there is plenty of leavening, they are not heavy or dry. Try them with berries and whipped cream, carmelized bananas, or applesauce and cinnamon. With any variations, I usually reduce the vanilla to 1T. We eat these about two or three times a month, and I haven't gone wrong yet.

These pancakes are very nice - light and fluffy - and I enjoyed them even though I usually like my pancakes more crepe-like. I halved the recipe and substituted yogurt for both the buttermilk (thinned with a bit of milk) and sour cream without any problem.

I typically do not like pancakes, but these are the best. I make the entire recipe and freeze the extras, then toast them to reheat. I think they are actually better reheated this way than fresh because they are crispier.

I gave this 3 forks, yet said I wouldn't make it again. Reason: The high fat count and need for ingredients I wouldn't necessarily have on hand did not warrant the improvement in taste. They were definitely light and fluffy and rich, but, overall, to me and the family, the difference was not worth the calories and bother.

Rating: 4
Wow! Light & rich at the same time, with a delicate crisp surface and an absolutely tender buttery tasting inside. What leftover syrup? I used creme fraiche, essentially the same as sour creme. One third cup is too big, unless you are baking only three at a time on my huge griddle. It makes 30 at a quarter cup each and bakes up better. To quote my husband, "It's a good thing a wind is blowing through or we'd lose these."

Sacre bleu, I made the compote with strawberries (fond memories of college IHOP outings), and it was simply divine! The flavor was perfect without any syrup. On the pancakes, my husband loved them!

pancake chef beware! no matter how long I left these on the griddle the inside was super soggy, totally uncooked. I think the secret is IMMEDIATELY using the batter, even 10 minutes of standing while the others are cooking is too long. Either find a big griddle to cook all at once or combine the dry/moist ingredients in two stages to get the freshest batch. A very sad loss of freshly picked wild bluberries from Maine :(

These pancakes are absolutely FABULOUS. I haven't had such delicious pancakes in quite a while, and regret that I didn't find this recipe sooner. This recipe is also very simple, great if you're lazy like me and don't care to whip egg whites at 8am. However, unless you are feeding a family of 10, I suggest halving the recipe, since this makes A LOT of batter.

As other reviewers have said, these are the best pancakes ever. I made them for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day.

Three words: OH MY GOSH!! These are the best homemade pancakes I've ever had. I've never been a big pancake eater--I've always wanted to like them, but somehow they've always left me disappointed. No longer. These have great flavor, great texture, great everything. I served them with maple syrup, and they were a huge hit. I froze the leftovers, and my boyfriend has had them for breakfast every morning for the past week. Two notes: I tried to save calories by cooking them in a nonstick pan and not adding butter, but the first couple of pancakes stuck. Added butter and had no other problems. Also, make sure they're cooked through--I pulled a couple off a little early, and the insides were a little liquidy. GREAT recipe, though. (BTW, I can't wait to serve these to my brother-in-law--he thinks he makes the best pancakes in the world, but I have to force them down!)

Made the pancakes for breakfast and sprinkled in raspberries (skipped the compote). Unfortunately, these cakes were WAY too moist and light to hold up to fruit. They are also very rich and dense and I can't imagine them with anything too sticky sweet. I halved the recipe and skimped a little on the sour cream and it still made a LOT of batter. After 7 pancakes, I stopped griddlin' but had a lot of left over batter. A few hours later, I added 1/4 cup of flour about 3 or 4 tbl butter, 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup of bisquick plus some more baking soda. Mixed in some dried cranberries and baked it at 400 til golden. My partner disagrees, but I like the muffins better than the pancakes. Incidentally, the half of the batter left over from the halved recipe still made 12 medium sized poofy muffins.

Delicious! The pancakes were light in texture. I used reduced fat/calorie buttermilk (I could find regular buttermilk in the stores.)and it worked out great. The blueberry compote was the perfect compliment, not too sweet...just right. I didn't have that over-stuffed feeling after eating them. I enjoyed every bite. I couldn't resist eating the leftover compote right out of the pot. Yum!! It would also be superb poured over a slice of fresh baked cheesecake. I'll try it next time.

A delicious recipe, after I'd translated cups to grammes, and reduced the quantities for two people. I use creme fraiche [a thick sour cream from France which is very popular in the UK in place of cream - more taste]and had to add some extra milk. Also, forgot to put in vanilla essence, but it might have spoilt the delicate taste. Also:- 1. I put some whole blueberries IN the batter. They burst in your mouth wonderfully when you bite them; 2. For the blueberry compote, I used the zest and juice of a minneola orange instead of water. Gives a lovely 'zing' to it.

These pancakes are amazing. (I also like the picture so much, I have it as my computer wallpaper!). I made this for New Year's Day breakfast, and used low fat sour cream and buttermilk with great results.
