This was my first time making this recipe, and I must say it was delicious! I doubled the recipe and made 24 muffins instead of 16. I used 5 smallish ripe bananas, as well as added about 3/4c of chocolate chips (my kids requested it). They turned out really moist and flavourful, and the texture was a nice change. The coconut was nice, because you could taste more than just bananas. Even though they were smaller, I baked them for the 25mins suggested and they turned out perfectly. The next time I have bananas to use up, I will definitely be making this one again!

O.M.G. I'm eating these warm out of the oven as I type!! I have to eat gluten free and it's not easy to get the same results from a recipe when you start substituting GF flours. But these came out perfect, the texture and consistancy are just like regular muffins! I used King Arthurs GF all- purpose flour and 1/4tsp xantham gum... My fiance actually had to ask if I was allowed to eat these, he had no idea they were GF! I only had salted butter, so I ommited the extra salt and did add some flaxseed as well. Utterly delicous and I can't wait to make these again!! Oh, how I've missed baked goodies!!

The whole family loved this recipe! Even the ones that don't like banana muffins. Did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and used half the butter. Used unsweetened coconut in the batter and sweetened coconut on top. Will make it again.

I love this recipe. I used the light brown sugar instead and reduce the amount to half a cup. It worked out very well. I noticed that some of the coconut flakes burnt a little. I just shook off the burnt ones when the muffins cooled off.

Good, but not fabulous. I used 3/4 c stick butter, 1/3 white and 1/3 brown sugar. Toasted the coconut. Used three bananas, and got 8 muffins. I'd add semisweet chips next time. Baked for only 17 mins.

I was looking for a "new" banana muffin and this one has two of my favorite ingredients - bananas and coconut. It's moist and full of flavor. It will become one of my "go-to" recipes.

This was a great recipe! A healthier vegan version that tastes delicious and has a nice muffiny consistancy is to substitute 1/2 c applesauce for the butter and 2tbl ground flax seeds + 3 tbl water for the egg. It is very delicous and you feel better about eating them! The cooking time was more towards 20 min or less.

Well, I am not such a great muffin maker, but this recipe turned out the best yet. I accidentally put all the coconut flakes in at once (unsweetened), added a little less sugar and used one not-so-ripe banana. All turned out perfect! I don't say this often, but this is definitely one I will use again. The look, consistency and taste were all fine bakery quality!

Made these this morning...and they are my new favorites! I had sm/med bananas so I used 4, and then cut the butter in half. I also used 1/8 cup of Agave instead of the sugar, and White whole wheat flour. I threw in some chopped pecans and chocolate chips. The batter was very thick, but the muffins are absolutely delightful. Will be making these often.

Rating: 4
Excellent. Only change I made was to use whole wheat flour. They were not too sweet as written but would probably still be good with less sugar. Definitely more of a dessert muffin than a breakfast one.

I made this recipe in an effort to use up all the brown bananas slowly accumulating in the freezer that my husband likes to poke fun at me for. I didn't make any alterations to the recipe, except I used unsweetened coconut flakes accidentally, and it was delicious as is. I will absolutely be making these again. Super easy, quick to make and they're delicious. Couldn't ask for more.

Delicious and very moist. I substituted canola oil for half the butter. Used half the sugar. Used unsweetened coconut. Added cinnamon and Ghiradelli dark chocolate chips. Used whole wheat pastry flour. The sweetness was just right. May be able to cut down the sugar even more if you use chocolate chips

I would actually give this no forks if I could. These were horrible - flavorless and heavy. When you have to doctor up a recipe to the extent some of the other cooks did, then it is a whole new recipe. Luckily, it was a quick recipe and I didn't waste too much time or energy making it.

I love this recipe and have made it multiple times. I include slivered almonds as it adds a great little surprise crunch. I have modified using yogurt, and even banana baby food (which I stock for emergency banana muffin cravings) I did just read some reviews and will certainly try the cinnamon, cardamon and other additions which can only make these muffins better!

This recipe was good but just a little too sweet for my taste. My home from college son loved them but next time I will cut down on the sugar or use unsweetened coconut.

A great recipe and easily modified. I added half cup of chocolate chips and left the coconut out of the batter, saving it to sprinkle on top. I satisfied the coconut lovers in the family without overwhelming the one who is not a big coconut fan. I also tried splitting the flour 50-50 with stone ground whole wheat and they came out beautifully. Didn't have muffin liners, wish I did. They still stuck a bit with greasing the pan. We'll be making this one again!

These muffins were moist and delicious. I had a hankering for banana cupcakes and decided to go a bit healthier and did not regret it. Now I crave these muffins! I did, however, use significantly less sugar and think it was a good accidental choice. I was planning on following the suggestions of other reviewers and only add 1/3 c. but when I went to my sugar bin, I had probably less than a 1/4 cup! It was really the perfect amount. This was the only change to the recipe. I couldn't image them being any sweeter. The ripe bananas definitely sweeten the muffins plenty. If you're looking for a delicious muffin, fuhgettaboutit! Also good with walnuts!

I made the recipe to specs. Good basic recipe but a little on the bland side. Consistency was nice and muffiny - neither too crumbly nor too heavy.If you are in love with banana/coconut combo this will do it for you without any changes. Next time I think I'm going to try a teaspoon of orange zest and cinnamon. Alternately I think cardamon and chocolate chips would also be interesting.

Rating: 4
This is a perfect muffin recipe. I altered very little: cut down the sugar a tad and used unsweetened coconut (all I had), used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 veg oil, and added a splash of milk, as a reviewer recommended. I also omitted the topping. They were great: light, not overly sweet, and with good flavor. I'll do this again with the overripe bananas in my freezer! Maybe next time I'll add nuts.

Rating: 3
A great recipe for using up bananas. I would give 3 1/2** The coconut gave a nice texture. I made the recipe as written with the following small changes: 1/3C sugar, not 2/3C, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cardamom, 1/4 tsp nutmeg added to mix. Also about 3 tbsp milk (or coconut milk) till batter is soft & clinging. This makes them lighter and fluffier. I took these to the office and everyone raved about them!

I didn't have any paper liners, so I had to grease the muffin tin with crisco. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is. They turned out really good, but I feel like they are missing something - cinnamon or lemon zest could be a good addition.

This is just a great, if somewhat sweet muffin. It has worked every time I've made it (and my teenage son begs for more!). Simple, uses those brown bananas and the coconut on top is excellent!

this combination is not as bizarre as it sounds. The coconut adds another dimension of moistness (and helps keep them moist if all are not gobbled up the first day) and does not add a distinct coconut flavor, just another intersting layer of flavor dimension. We like it!

I didn't make this, but I did get to eat it! The cake itself didn't taste very much like coconut, but the flakes on top did the job. The baker didn't have a muffin tin, so she made it in an 8x8. Tender! Tasty! Super banana bread!

I don't really care for bananas, so I didn't include them in this recipe. BIG MISTAKE! Banana is what makes this recipe work I later found out. Oops! They are pretty good, but not a favorite. At first, since no banana the batter was too dry, then I added milk, oops! Then it became soupy! I finally kept adding more solids and it became okay. I had quite an experience cooking these! When I finished my kitchen was a mess! Even if they taste okay I don't think I'll make these muffins again! Please, for your own good; don't EVER make these muffins without bananas!

I think I'm the only reviewer who actually FOLLOWED the recipe. It's not bland- it tastes exactly like it's supposed to- bananas and coconut. Although I don't think it's my favorite combination, these muffins came out really good. Use VERY ripe bananas, so ripe you barely have to mash them.

I was bored with my after school banana oat bran muffins. Tried some version of this recipe and they are the best muffins I have made in awhile! I did do alot of subsititions though to make them healthier and tastier: coconut oil and buttermilk instead of butter, added 1/2 whole wheat flour and some ground flax, 1/2 the sugar and used brown sugar, cinnamon and fresh ginger. For the kids batch I added white chocolate chips. Adult version had macadamia nuts...and they were moist and did rise up..perhaps it was the buttermilk??

Rating: 4
Delicious!! I added 1/8 tsp ginger, about 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Since I was using unsweetened coconut I didn't cut the sugar, and they were plenty sweet. I needed to add a little milk to the batter at the end since it was so dense, but they came out moist, light and absolutely delicious. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 3
Pretty good. As per other reviewers suggestions I did the following: Cut the butter by about half (50g used), added a bit of oil, half the sugar - used brown instead of white, added nutmeg and cinnamon to the dry ingredients, and extra coconut. Also a splash of milk at the end to moisten the batter. They came out a bit dense but still taste really nice - not too sweet but the banana and coconut flavor really comes out. the only thing i'd do differently next time is all oil instead of butter (healthier) and more bananas. Also it'd be interesting to try to replace the oil with applesauce

These were fast and delicious. I doubled the recipe, which seemed to work fine. It made 18 medium muffins.

Wow, these were great. I doubled the recipe, and added spices as other reviewers recommended (I put in 1/2 teaspoon each nutmeg and cinammon). They were delicious--very moist, and the coconut on top gave a nice bit of crunch. The doubled recipe made 19 regular sized muffins. The recipe was also particularly quick, and only dirtied two bowls, which was a bonus. NOTE: the muffins didn't rise a huge amount, so my first batch (where I'd left room in case they did rise a lot) were a little flat. The second batch I filled the cups all the way up, and they were perfectly shaped when done baking.

I wanted a healthier breakfast muffin, so I quartered the butter, halved the sugar, increased the banana, used half whole wheat, and added cinnamon, cardamon, lemon extract, and a dash of milk to wet the batter a bit.

I just finished making these and they're great! Very moist and the coconut topping gives it a nice crunchy sweet finish. Because I had no butter I substituted a half cup of Trader Joe's chunky applesauce which added those nice bites. I also added some fresh blueberries to half the batter (I had to use them up!) and that made a nice variation. Next time I might add a few spices such as ginger and cinnamon. But truthfully, you can't go wrong with this recipe. Enjoy!

These were excellent! A dessert muffin, not a breakfast muffin in my opinion. I substituted 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour for all of the all-purpose flour, and used 1/2 cup turbinado sugar instead of the 2/3 cup white sugar. We all loved them. I, too, like the fact that the recipe makes 8 muffins instead of 12 or more. Will make again soon!!!

I only used half of the sugar, and added crushed pineapples instead, and they came out great. Did anyone else find them a bit on the dry side? I added some nonfat soymilk to mind to keep them moist.

Made these for my daughter as a way to get her to eat bananas. She loved them! as did my husband. I made them smaller in a 12 cup tin (got 11) and cooked for 20 mins. A little brown on the bottom but still okay. They were just the right size for her lunch box and not too rich or overly sweet. Will definitely make again.

Doubled the amount and got 19 regular-sized muffing. Reduced sugar to 1/c., used one stick of butter and 1/c. low-fat coconut milk. Only had about 1/c cup of coconut so end result not quite enough coconut flavor. Used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp coconut extract. I should of put some sugar on top before baking as the product came out too pale. My result was slightly sweet, not overpowering.

Wondeful! I doubled the recipe, substituted 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, then added pecans to 1/2 the recipe. Cinnamon sugar went on the tops of the non-nuts, and a whole pecan on top of the nuts. Even my daughter who doesn't "love" coconut asked for a second in record time. Definitely a keeper.

I made these muffins for brunch with my girlfriends and they were a great success, but for everyday nutrition I prefer something a bit healthier. So I made the recipe again and this time replaced 1/3 of a cup of white flour with wheat flour, used ¼ cup of vegetable oil in place of the ½ cup of melted butter, added a ½ cup of plain soy milk to ensure the muffins would be moist, and substituted half the sugar for Splenda. My husband, who loved the muffins the first time I made them, didnt notice a difference and I was able to sneak in some extra fiber while reducing calories and saturated fat.

Just what i was looking for! I had MANY ripe bananas and was looking for a cake-like recipe over a dense bread one. I doubled the recipe, and made it in a 9x12 pan. Needed to bake 5 mins longer. Used baking spray and the cake removed beautifully. I didn't realize that my coconut was sweetened, so i will reduce the sugar next time if this is what is in my pantry or reduce the sugar in general. Will also try other reviewer's sugestions of substituting apple sauce for some of the butter. There is alot of butter in this recipe and a tad 'greasy'. Love that the recipe is light, moist and fluffy. The coconut topping adds a wonderful crunch. Will also try throwing in some chocolate chips and adjusting the sugar accordingly.

Moist and flavorful! Three stars instead of four because of some substitutions I made.. I used half a stick of butter, room temperature instead of melted, a little extra banana to make up for the liquid content like somebody else suggested earlier, and 1/3 cup of sugar. The sweetened coconut brings more than enough sugar in the recipe, and it still tasted very flavorful! Although the banana flavor comes out more than the coconut did, so next time I will try to put some coconut extra instead of vanilla.

Thanks to all the suggestions, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, added 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, and used unsweetened coconut in the batter and sweetened on top. They were delicious. They're really more like (slightly chewy) cupcakes; they would be great after e.g. a curry dinner with a dollop of maybe lime sorbet? I really recommend the almond extract addition; it doesn't overwhelm the bananas, and sort of ties the flavors together in a very nice way. If you have a couple of blackening bananas lying around, make these! They take about five minutes to put together.

Not normally a sweet muffin person, but these are tasty! Despite being made with whole-wheat flour, 2/3 as much sugar, and no almond extract, they were very flavorful. Banana & coconut is a great combination. They were really pretty sweet, but not too much. Flavor was enhanced with some ground cinnamon and nutmeg. Delicious as a breakfast or snack muffin.

Rating: 3
Very flavorful. I added a few drops of almond extract instead of just vanilla. Trader Joe's sells toasted coconut ribbons (unsweetened) and I used that in the batter and put flaked coconut on top only. No burning issues with the topping for me. The coconut ribbons are a bit thick and make the muffin chewy but the flavor of the coconut is definitely more pronounced. Split the sugar between white and light brown, used 6T of butter instead of 8 and 2 oz more banana to make up the liquid variance. Next time I will try the applesauce sub for most of the butter.

I used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour. I cut the sugar a bit, and used mostly brown. I also cut the butter a bit - and they came out great! everyone loved them! The only thing I would do differently is use sweetened coconut (as called for in the recipe). I only had unsweetened, shredded. It didn't make a difference to me in the muffin, but on top of the muffin - sweetened would have worked better.

Rating: 4
Fool-proof and delicious. I have been looking for a great banana recipe for awhile now and this is IT! I reduced the butter to 1/3 cup and the sugar to 1/2 cup without any problems. If you are using over-ripe bananas this should be no problem since they add enough sweetness as is. I made it twice and each time it was GREAT. Also, in response to others who found their muffins too dense, check the expiration date on your baking powder. If you are using fresh baking powder, your muffins should come out nice and fluffy.

I substituted the sugar (half white/half brown) and used diced sweetened coconut (and put it all in the mix instead of sprinkling some on top, but used a wand mixer to mash it up a little), used dried bananas which I had moistened (as Cyclone Larry wiped out our banana crop here in Oz and they are currently $17/kg...), and used a non-stick mini muffin tray with 24 pans in it (I sprayed it with non-stick spray, so no paper cases were used either). It made exactly 24 mini muffins and they were the right size to pop in you mouth with a cuppa. I've now banned the making of these as hubby and I ate the lot in one day...They truly are wonderful....

These are delicious. I have made these many many times and they alway turn out great.

What a lovely muffin: delicious quasi-exotic flavor, moist, and easy to make. I made the following minor changes: 1/2 c whole wheat flour for 1/2 c of the white flour, half brown and half white sugar, canola oil for the butter, and almond extract instead of vanilla. Now, anytime I have a couple of bananas left over, I will make these, and I'm usually a make-a-recipe-once type of girl.

Very, very good. Banana bread reminds me of fall-winter, so it was great to find a delicious way to use overripe bananas in the summer. I followed most of the suggestions: cut butter by 1/4; used 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 white; added bittersweet choc chips; used good quality almond extract plus vanilla. I found a new product for those of us who are lazy or in a hurry: premixed sugar/Splenda for baking, and premixed brown sugar/Splenda. The muffins were a bit heavier than I prefer, but I can't tell whether that's because I forget to compensate for my baking powder being old, or the loss of sugar volume, or the fact that there was less sugar for the leavening agents to interact with. I suspect I might have agreed with the writer who found the muffins bland if I hadn't added that almond extract -- it was a real aroma/flavor enhancer.

Had two very ripe bananas and some leftover coconut so decided to give this one a shot - quite good and very simple. Based on previous reviews, I used 1/2 white and 1/2 light brown sugar, which I highly recommend (they'd be much too sweet otherwise) and I cut the butter to 6 T - they were moist and flavorful. My only other addition was about 1 oz of coursely chopped bittersweet chocolate, which I think added a lot. Next time I'm going to use 1/2 whole wheat flour and I'll substitute toased pecans for the coconut. Very adaptable basic recipe. Yum - enjoy!

I've made these muffins several times as written and everyone loves them. They are VERY rich and sweet. I recently made them again but tried some of the suggestions made by others...replaced 1/4 cup whole wheat flour for all purpose, used almond extract instead of vanilla and cut the butter to 1/3 cup vs. 1/2. Sprinkled a few mini choc chips on top....very good. I think this is one of those basic recipes you can play around with and get good results everytime! Definitely a keeper!

This was a simple tastey recipe.

I also made some changes, but overall find the recipe to be sound. I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white, used almond extract rather than vanilla, and thinly sliced almonds rather than coconut. I like the result quite a lot, and my boyfriend, who normally doesn't like banana muffins, agrees that these are 'pretty decent'.

Delightful! My bananas were not so very ripe, so I pre-baked them, wrapped in foil. It seemed to work well.

Although a little late, to the cook from Baton Rouge - Thanks!! Sometimes even if we know, it's nice to have a reminder. I've made these with cream of coconut in place of half or more of the butter and loved it. Couldn't find my recipe tonight, so I came online to find it. Going to try it with chocolate chips tonight; expect it to be great!!

Great muffins. Thumbs up from husband and friend. Per the other reviewers, i substituted rum for vanilla extract and used 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup sugar. Also, added almond slivers.

I made these muffins once according to the recipe; the second time, I decreased the butter to 3/4 a stick, used brown sugar, and added blueberries. They were great the first time, but the second time was better!

IT was a good recipe. I gave it 2 forks bec. I really like a different coconut banana cake with a rum and cream cheese frosting. These muffins were fine, looked good to give as gifts. I did glaze them with confectioners sugar, cocnut rum and coco lopez. Then I sprinkled toasted coconut on top.

Loved the muffins! Ran out of flour added walnut meal, gave it a little more substance.

Very tasty! I made a few substitutions (who hasn't, it appears): for 3/4 c of the flour I used whole wheat, used both vanilla and almond extract, added 1/2 c chopped almonds, cut butter down to 1/2 stick and added 1/8 c flavorless oil. I'm not even a big banana fan, and these are divine.

These are probably the best muffins I have ever had. Used unsweetened but processed organic coconut from Whole Foods that supposedly has a lot less fat(added a teensy bit more sugar). Also used a silicone muffin pan and didn't need any paper or foil cups. Looking forward to trying it with rum instead of vanilla as one reviewer suggested. Delicious!!

I definitely tweaked this recipe, but the results were great and definitely healthier (yes even with chocolate chips). I substituted whole wheat pastry flour, applesauce for all the butter, stevia plus for the sugar. I did add the chocolate chips. I haven't tried the original version, however this one came out so good, I prbably will make the same way next time. I definitely will make these again. The texture was fine without the butter. THe only ting I would recommend is foil cups instead of paper. I used some of each and the foil ones loosened a lot easier.

If you like banana bread, you'll love these muffins. I cut the butter w/apple sauce, added chocolate chips, and used 1 1/2 of the recipe to make a dozen muffins. Came out great.

Yum! I am in Hawaii and the apple bananas are in season which added a slight tartness that regular bananas wouldn't. I didn't use the coconut but added pecans instead. They were perfect!

I made these for my family this morning. I didn't have coconut so I just left it out and they were great! So moist but with a perfect crisp crust. My 15 month old loved them so much he actually spoke "more" instead of signing which is his usual. Definitely will make again and may try to fiddle with them by cutting down butter and/or trying apple sauce as others have done.

I realize it's a few months outdated, but i just wanted to comment on the hating message left against the vegan individual who rated this recipe earlier. What is UP with people who aren't secure enough in their own carnivorousness to just relax and not get all defensive and aggressive against vegetarians and/or vegans? The vegan review was completely benign, with good info on recipe tweaking, and this person makes all sorts of assumptions based on gender stereotypes and his/her clear discomfort with the totally inoffensive lifestyle that is veganism, throwing insults about the review, which was in no way critical of other meat-eaters or anyone else for that matter. Get over yourself and stop hating on others.

Easy and delish. I made these to go with coffee for a "girls morning in" and they were perfect. I used 3/4 stick of butter with no problems and mini muffin cups. The mini's took 18-20 minutes. Loved the coconut topping.

Absolutely fabulous! I can't wait to have more over ripe bananas! I made them with 1/3c sugar and 1/3c brown sugar. I also made mini muffins instead (more proportionate for my toddler) and they took about 18 minutes to cook. I didn't have any trouble with the coconut burning probably b/c of the shorter cook time.

This recipe was great. The coconut gives such a great twist. I baked it with half the butter and the equivalent volume made up with apple sauce to reduce the fat and they were still yummy.

I've made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe. It was terrific! The second time I decided to see what would happen if a cut the butter a little. I went with 3/4 stick. Still great. Actually couldn't taste a difference. Maybe next time I will try 2/3 of a stick. The coconut on top really makes this outstanding. This is my preferred way to use up over-ripe bananas.

Were pretty tasty and cooked up fine. Moist and flavorful, but very greasy. I plan to cut back on the butter next time. I'm not a fan of sugar, so I reduced it to slightly less than 1/2 cup, and made 1/3 of that light brown sugar since I prefer the flavor of brown sugar. When hot, the sweetness is perfect, but when cooled, could use a little more. The coconut is a great addition, both in the batter and on top for a crunch. I had to bake for about 31 mins, and got about 12 muffins. The muffins stuck onto the liners though, rendering a substantial portion of muffin difficult to eat/inedible.

Finding myself with 4 overripe bananas this afternoon,I searched for an easy recipe. Found this and since I have 3 vegans and 3 non vegans to feed I made 2 batches. One with egg replacer and soy margarine and the other with a real egg and butter. I made them in mini non stick muffin pans, no paper liners. Both batches are very tasty. Will definitely make this recipe again. Even my non banana eater enjoyed them.I added vegan chocolate chips and organic unsweetened coconut to the vegan muffins and substituted chopped walnuts for organic unsweetened coconut in the non vegan muffins as I had run out of coconut.

Not spectacular, but ok. I think it needs more spice or maybe something in the middle. Definately decrease the sugar, especially if you are using sweetened coconut

There is no need to cream the butter (these are muffins after all). Simply melt the butter in the microwave. Combine all the other wet ingredients, then blend in the butter. Then fold in the dry ingredients and "voila!", you are ready to bake. I used 6 extralarge muffin cups. These are so good and easy, I made them 3 nights in a row just to use up overripe bananas!

I read the reviews thinking that these were probbaly good, but not nearly as tasy as everyone said they were. I was wrong! These are delicious, so easy, and as other reviewer said, better than a whole loaf of banana bread. I don't even like banana cakes, and I loved these. My mother who doesn't care for coconut liked them, and my husband who's lukewarm on both liked them as well. Great recipe!!

I made this recipe sour of the moment one night for a friend with low blood sugar. My husband and i do not eat coconut, but these were delicious. I used Paper liners, and found that one complete if you cut them open and added a little butter you were good to go.

Rating: 3
It's dangerous for me to read comments because I am a food and nutrition instructor who tries not to be a know it all but here goes: 1. If butter seeps out, then you may have added the melted butter to cold milk. The butter got firm again so it didn't form an emulsion when mixed with the other ingredients. When the firm pieces of butter melted in the heat of the oven, it seeped out. Always make sure that eggs and milk are room temperature when baking. 2. If your muffins were heavy, check your baking powder. 3. In comparing this recipe to other really good muffins, this is a lot of butter and I think it can easily be cut back without having much impact. The butter flavor could be masking the coconut flavor. Like coconut flavor? Add coconut extract instead of vanilla.

VERY good muffins for a brunch. Watch carefully to insure that the coconut on top doesn't burn.

Excellent! I followed the recipe with no substitutions for the butter. They were NOT greasy at all, I even put them in greased muffin pans without paper liners and that worked great. I recommend toasting the coconut and adding chopped walnuts..adds a nice nutty flavor and some texture. My recipe made 10 muffins.

It's great that something this quick and easy to make tastes so yummy. I don't have muffin tins, so I divided the batter between two baby loaf pans and the recipe worked fine as mini-breads. (The baking time was a little longer, of course). The breads had a great texture. I would use much more coconut next time, though.

To cook on 5/18--there are vegan egg replacements available, with no animal products; I think they are generally powdered. not the same as "egg substitute" which is for people who don't want the fat/cholesterol in egg yolks. //UPDATE to Gotham: Who said anything about there being too much cholesterol in the recipe? I was merely pointing out the difference between egg replacer, which is vegan, and egg substitute. I'm all for full-fat, full-egg recipes. And for reading comprehension.

I don't think the cholesterol from 1 egg, divided between 8 muffins is going to give anybody any problems. Doesn't it make more sense to just eat sweets and other junk food such as muffins in moderation, than try to alter the recipes, just to keep eating them (with less guilt)?

These were ok. I changed the recipe by using half a stick of butter, half cup of applesauce and half cup of sugar. The texture was fine and the muffins came out of the tins beautifully (I buttered the tins-didn't use muffin cups). But I thought this recipe was bland. Other than the coconut on top, there was no coconut taste. I think I'll try other muffin recipes next time.

I like bananas and coconut..sounded like a good recipe. I made the recipe exactly as posted, however the muffins came out too sweet, greasy, heavy, and soggy. I then tried the recipe again, reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup and replacing half the butter with applesauce. That was an improvement, but the muffins were still heavy and soggy..not edible. Possibly too much banana? Oh, and they also stick to the cupcake liners..impossible to get them out in one piece. I would not make this recipe again.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly. Although delicious, they were too greasy, even to the point of butter seeping through the liners and pooling in the bottom of the pans.

A definite keeper...quick, easy, and a great alternative to banana bread.

I only got 8 muffins out of this recipe unlike the previous reviewer. I thought these muffins were really good but thought the coconut flavor needed to be kicked up a bit. I substituted a 1/2 cup of coconut cream for the butter. You could probably use egg replacer to make these completely vegan, if needed. My only other suggestion is decreasing the amount of sugar. I put in only a 1/2 cup of sugar and the muffins were plenty sweet. (And I have a huge sweet tooth!) If your bananas are ripe enough, they will contribute a lot of sugar so you shouldn't need to add much.

Oh my God! Delicious! I made these for my son, but of course, had to try one before he got home. Well, it's four muffins later and I'm going out to get more coconut so I can make these again in the next few days. I actually got 12 muffins out of the recipe...
