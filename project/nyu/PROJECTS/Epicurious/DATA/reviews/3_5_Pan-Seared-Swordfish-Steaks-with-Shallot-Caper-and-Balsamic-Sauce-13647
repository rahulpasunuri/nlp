This recipe turned out great! I made slight revision though.. Instead of white wine and balsamic vinegar, I used limoncello. The limoncello added a sweet note that contrasted brilliantly with the salt of the capers and pungency of the shallots.

This was disappointing. My husband who eats everything didn't finish it - a first. Will not make again.

The swordfish used was Trader Joes frozen sashimi grade from Singapore. I thawed it out carefully starting in the morning and then let it get to room temp for about an hour before cooking. I followed the recipe very closely though following other reviewers tips I seared it for 4 minutes and then cooked it for 4 minutes after flipping. The sauce was very good - not outstanding. It really needs to be just a bit thicker and I would recommend putting a tablespoon of butter in after taking it off the heat at the end to provide a little more consistency to the sauce. We drank a Pinot Noir that is on the lighter side of the spectrum with it and enjoyed dinner very much. This is on the sour side of the taste spectrum. I thought the shallots almost had a saurkraut quality. This is not a criticism in any way, just a way to categorize so you can plan your wine and accompanying side dishes. We just had a salad with gorgonzola and some homemade sourdough bread to complete the meal.

I loved it, and I'll definitely make it again. About halfway through the preparation I learned I didn't have any white wine, so I used chicken broth instead of all things. It tasted great, and the broth didn't end up overpowering the flavor of the swordfish.

Great reciepe, excellent flavor in the sauce. Too much balsamic vinegar though...had to boil it down to get the right consistency. I would prefer more of a glaze to put on the top of the swordfish, rather than the liquid. For a first time, we loved it though!

Flavorless. Swordfish took much longer to cook than the three minutes per directions.

Excellent and simple recipe; it was my first time cooking swordfish and the timings given worked just right for me: the steak was still very moist but cooked through. Served with cauliflower puree over frisee leaves, whose bitterness contrasted the sweetness of the sauce nicely. Swordfish is a good meaty fish, but much better from a sustainability view than tuna; I will happily make this again.

Good lord, so good. You must try it just as the recipe states! I've made it a few times now and each time my husband and I cherish each bite. I think it's important to use a good QUALITY BALSAMIC and stick to the recipe. The flavors are so perfectly yet delicately balanced that they could easily tip in the wrong direction.

I'm surprised everyone liked this recipe so much. I typically am in line with a 3.5 fork rating. Not here, though. Good, but not great. Too much vinegar, not at all aesthetically pleasing (b/c of the vinegar, everything is brown). Not terrible, but won't make it again.

This recipe is very simple to make, and a delicious blend of flavours. We served it with boiled potatoes, a mixed greens salad and a dry sauvignon blanc. Yummy! We had plenty of sauce / juice and did not feel the need to add more liquid.

This was such an easy recipe. I did have to substitute onions and garlic for the shallots and used white balsamic in lieu of regular. As an addition I put the onions back into the pan with the sauce after removing the swordfish and sauteed arugula with sunflower seeds to put under the fish. It was absolutely delicious!

Rating: 4
This was worth making again. I used an enameled saucepan rather than a skillet. That deepened the liquid around the fish and kept it very moist. Also added 2 TBS extra wine and water plus extra splash of balsamic. I still found the sauce as written a bit anemic. Instead of extra capers I added several chopped Greek olives and they kicked up the flavor of the sauce a lot. It's an easy dish to make.

I looked at many swordfish recipes before choosing this one. Great choice!! It was fantastic  really didn't expect it to be so amazing. Other than adding the littlest bit more of each of the liquids that make up the sauce, I didn't change a thing. The only thing I will change next time around is to sear the first side for 4+ minutes instead of only 3. We were intensely happy to have lots of the shallots in sauce to spoon over the fish as we ate. I wouldn't skimp on the them as others have suggested. I used good balsamic and I believe that makes a difference in a recipe like this. You must try it!

I made this recipe with a swordfish steak and a tuna steak. I used white balsamic vinegar and substituted cilantro for the parsley. Be very careful when cooking swordfish - I cooked for two minutes on first side and one minute second side, both the swordfish and tuna were on the rare side but that is the best way to eat them! Swordfish turns into leather if cooked for too long, tuna as well. Enjoy!

I love this dish! As a big fish eater, this dish is delicious and easy! One piece of advice is to make sure to let the swordfish cook longer if it weighs more than 6 ounces (I made the mistake once).

Even though I definitely overcooked the shallots (should have removed them as per others' suggestions), it was a very simple but delicious way to make swordfish. It wasn't the most attractive looking recipe that I've made from this site, but I will definitely make it again.

I made this dish according to the recipe and was disappointed. It was just ok, but not something I will make again. There are too many other outstanding recipes on this site.

this recipe is easy, fast, and excellent. is use this recipe all the time. sometimes i bake the fish instead of searing because its quicker and requires less fats. i cook the shallots after the fish is done (if searing) because the searing always takes longer than the recipe reads and thus you would overcook the shallots. works great on salmon.

Rating: 4
This recipe is very good folks, I added double the butter to make the sauce go further and also removed the shallots prior to cooking the swordfish as another reviewer recommended (good idea)(Also use a good imported balsamic vinegar). The steaks were excellent; moist, tender and flaky but the sauce is what really made the pallet dance with delight. I accompanied the dish with red potatoes fried golden brown in olive oil and later added red and yellow bell peppers and yellow onion. I served the dish with the same chardonnay I used in the sauce. Mmm Mmm Good.

This was a good change from our normal grilling of swordfish. Next time will add alittle more balsamic and white wine while reducing to two shallots from three. We served it with a nice chardonay.

I have just been given a $40 dollar bottle of balsamic for my birthday and can hardly wait to make this. To the foodie who said the vinegar had too much bite, chances are you weren't using a good vinegar. It MUST come from Italy and be aged a minimum of 5 years

Rating: 3
Delicious, EASY, not to light, not to heavy, just right! I was concerened the balsamic and wine with the capers would be over powering, but it was awesome! Rather than moving the shallots to the side, I removed them after sauteing and added them again with the capers, wine, etc, as not to carmelize them. Perfect! Definitely do again!

Rating: 4
This was hands-down the best (and among the easiest to make) swordfish I've ever tasted. My husband proclaimed the meal among the best I've made (and he like's my cooking!), and our guests demanded the recipe. I cannot wait to make this again. I served with garlic/olive oil cous cous, lightly wilted spinach salad in a balsamic/pancetta dressing, and tomato/mozzerella salad. Perfect.

I must say that even though I used a "good" balsamic vinegar, and reduced the amount slightly, my husband and I found the sauce was too tangy for us. It wasn't awful, but we ended up saying that we prefer grilled swordfish seasoned with lemon and rosemary, where we can still taste the swordfish....

Our first time cooking Swordfish. It turned out wonderful, very moist and full of flavor! We served it with a side of fresh sting beans and roasted pine nuts. (it wasn't 'fishy' and very 'meaty' unlike other fish we eat).

The hubby and I cook a fish dish each week, with a tendency toward salmon. Swordfish was on sale, so we thought we'd give this a whirl. "Cooked through" will, of course, give you an overly firm fish, but we did follow the recipe to the letter. We both thought it was wonderful topped with the sauce (although the sauce's color was a bit unappealing). Without the sauce, this is a pretty bland steak-of-a-fish. Good enough to make again when the swordfish is on sale!

My husband loved this dish; so much he asked for it two nights in a row!!! Followed the recipe pretty much to the "T". I found that the sauce, as well as the fish, was better after letting it cool a little while. Highly recommend this recipe - and it is easy!

This is a terrific recipe - a keeper! We served it with oven roasted asparagus and rice pilaf. Our suggestion is to add a little more white wine than the recipe calls for as during cooking time. The capers really give it great flavor. Will defintely make it again!

Local market's swordfish was frozen, so I used deep sea scallops (1#). Cut back on vinegar, excluded capers (wife doesn't like 'em), added flour to thicken sauce. Worked well!

The balsamic vinegar was the only thing I could taste in this dish! Next time I would reduce the vinegar by half, or cut it with a teaspoon + of brown sugar; also, adding some broth or more wine might mellow the flavor. I wouldn't make this again the way it's recommended. Have some fish with your vinegar!

I prepared this recipe with much appreciated assistance from my main squeeze, and let-me-tell-you...it turned out real nice. We subbed marlin for swordfish, just to keep it exciting, you know how we do sometimes.

I enjoyed this dish very much. It is rather easy to prepare and delicious. The flavors of the balsamic vinegar and swordfish seemed to go very well together.

Good luck to those who try this one...

The store was out of swordfish so I used halibut fillets. They were very thick so I cut them into chunks. I used a little Wondra flour to thicken the sauce and served over a brown rice medley. It was a big hit. I think that the mildness of the halibut accentuated the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar. I will definitely make again using the halibut.

I've made this recipe several times for company - the only drawback is needed to manage several skillets if you have more than two or three people. The shallots, vinegar, and capers combine into something that doesn't taste like any one of them. Even though the sauce is not light it still allows the taste of the swordfish to come through, so use the freshest swordfish you can find.

I agree with Val, this was a very good recipe. I did not think to add mushrooms but I imagine that might be pretty tasty. Although I not sure about mushrooms and swordfish. I was also thinking that rather then 1 TBS water you might want to consider 1 TBS fish sauce, fish stock or even soy sauce if you have it handy.
