Wow. And I don't even like bread pudding, but this is amazing. I was looking for a way to use my first, somewhat failed attempt at brioche and found this recipe. My husband loves bread pudding but I never make it for him because it has never really floated my boat. Definitely don't skip the Frangelico, though I did skip the almond extract. After reading all the reviews I wavered on cutting back on the sugar and I'm glad I ultimately decided not to - I'm not much of a sweet tooth and the full amount did not taste like too much to me. Next time - and there will definitely be a next time - I will try adding some toasted, chopped pecans to the top and serve with a few fresh berries. But this needs absolutely nothing - a true 4 fork slice of heaven.

I gave this recipe a 4 but it would only really deserve that rating if one cuts back on the sugar like other reviewers have suggested. I followed the recipe exactly and found it too sweet, but still very good. The only changes I made were to add some dried cranberries and chopped walnuts. I will definitely make it again but with less sugar.

I get raves every time I've made it. Was looking for a simple bread pudding recipe and this is it. Others are higher maintenance (water baths?). Reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, used the Amaretto and omitted the almond extract the second time I made it (was a little too much). I also added 1/4 cup dried cranberries and 1/4 cup sliced almonds for crunch. Love it!

As a basic recipe for bread pudding, very adaptable. This time I used 1/2 generic "italian" bread and 1/2 donuts. And 2 cups of buttermilk, 1 cup cream, 1 cup 2% milk (what I had on hand). Steeped 5 pods of cardamon in warmed Frangelico. Added some toasted pecans, golden raisins & dried cranberries. Took 50 minutes at 350.

This was a real crowd pleaser. Everyone loved it. I incresed the custard mixture by 1/2...and mixed in chopped nuts with the topping. Everyone had seconds on this one! Do not plan on leftovers. Even bread pudding haters loved this one!!!

My first time making Bread Pudding and it was exactly what I was in the mood for. I really liked the bread crumbs on top which made it crispy. I added hydrated Raisins for a little acidity.

I added 6 oz. dried cranberries and sultanas and used challah (couldn't find brioche). I also added almonds to the crumb topping. It was a big hit at my thanksgiving table and even better the next day; the almond flavor increased over time..

I cut the recipe exactly in half and used croissants. It tasted great!!!!!! I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is full proof. I've made this again and again. I usually serve it with an improv fruity sauce: simple syrup with blueberries or strawberries or raspberries (whatever is in the freezer!) I have also used sourdough, croissants, or whatever bread I have available. It's all very good, but the brioche is divine. Don't substitute the Frangelico...make a trip to the liquour store for this recipe!!

Excellent! I subbed spiced rum for the Frangelico, as that's what I had on hand. I also used only six eggs, reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added dried cherries. I will try it with Splenda next time, also. This one goes in the "keeper" file.

Bread pudding is one of my most favorite desserts to make. You might say Im a bit obsessed by it. With that said, this is one of the best Ive ever come across. I used bourbon instead of frangelico, topped it with home made caramel sauce and fresh unsweetened whipped cream and it was to die for. We ate ourselves sick and cant wait to do it all over again.

This was the first time making bread pudding and it came out great! We added raisins and used Amaretto (and splashed some on top for serving). Next time I'll get vanilla ice cream...

Made this pudding for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. I decreased the sugar to 1 1/4 Cups, I used 6 croissants. That was very good, but I will try brioche next time. I did not make crumb crust. I added fresh blueberries. This will be great with raisins, fresh raspberries, strawberries, peaches, etc. Best of all it was so easy.

This is one of the easier recipes for bread pudding I've tried in my neverending search for THE bread pudding recipe. I used challah bread and bourbon in place of the brioche and frangelico. Also added raisins, which were soaked in the bourbon, and a layer of slivered almonds to the top in place of brioche crumbs. YUMMY! My husband and I probably ate 1/2 the dish in the first day.

I have made this several times, I cut the sugar by about 1/2 cup, everyone always asks for the recipe. I make it with the Frangelico, it is really delicious.

I substituted bourbon for the Frangelico and added golden raisins in the middle and on top and only used one and a half cups of sugar and seven eggs. Next time I will use even less sugar as entire family deemed bread pudding delicious, but too sweet. Oh, I also did not use the almond liquor. This is a fantastic base recipe to experiment with (chocolate, fruit, different spices), but it definitely calls for brioche.

Great bread pudding recipe. I have made this recipe as is and used it a a base and adapted it with seasonal berries and other yummy things - always good because it has the perfect proportions. This has become my staple bread pudding recipe and I see no reason to use any other.

Wonderful! I substituted Splenda for the sugar and it's still fabulous!

Fabulous! As recommended by others, I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, which was plenty. I also used 1% milk instead of whole, which didn't seem to make a difference (I did use the cream). I added dried cherries too.

I LOVED this recipe! I made it exactly as written for a first try. The second time I made it I changed the liquor and added chocolate. Next time I'll try croissants as some other cooks mentioned. I see this recipe as being my "base" bread pudding recipe! It may be a little sweet if you add a sauce when serving it, but I always serve bread pudding with warm cream and (usually) fresh berries, so it was PERFECT!

This bread pudding is deeeelicious! I used egg bread, added some chocolate, and used about a fourth of a cup less sugar and it came out great!

This was an incredibly easy recipe! I made a couple of modifications, though: 1) Substituted Hawaiian Bread 2) Reduced sugar by 1/2 cup (to make up for sweetness introduced by #1) 3) Added some raisins 4) Sprinkled some cinnamon on top

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was an absolute hit! Everyone raved and immediately requested I make it again for Christmas (I'll oblige). I did make some changes. I used eggnog to replace most of the milk and added raisins which had been soaked in rum. In addition to that I added toasted pecans and walnuts. To finihs it, I drizzled a homemade hard sauce over each individual serving. Serve warm~Fantastic!!

If you are not using real egg brioche for this recipe, you're doing yourself an injustice. This was a delicious bread pudding. I served it semi-warm with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream on the side. I made it exactly as the recipe said. To do otherwise and switch the main ingredient THEN review it seems like cheating.

Very easy, and pretty tasty, but it's nothing mind blowing. I used croissants instead of brioche, which helped, but overall I found the finished product a bit plain. I used a biscuit cutter to create nicely-sized portions and ended up serving it with some brandy-soaked raisins on top with a burnt caramel sauce drizzled around; it was a hit with the guests. But next time I'll make sure to bake something in the pudding, maybe some raisins or dried cherries.

I made this yesterday using Panetone instead of the brioche and eggnog to replace the milk and cream. I cut the sugar to 3/4 c. and used a brandy rum mix and a splash of dark rum (kept the vanilla but did not use the almond extract). The house smelled sooooo good while it was cooking. It got absolute rave reviews!

I used croissants as did one of the other raters---what a fabulous bread pudding. I loved it and it was easy!

This was a delicious recipie. I was in the mood to make something with fall fruits that night so i added sliced apples and pears coated in cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar. I layered them between the bread cubes like a lasagna. I also used half the amount of sugar. This was more than enough sugar with the fruit. It was delicious, and deffinatly one of my dessert favoites.

I used panettone instead, thought it would offer me three traditional breads all in one...I sliced and toasted the one inch bread cubes before adding the custard mixture. Drizzled 1/2 cube melted butter on the toasted crumbs before baking. Threw in a couple of grates of fresh nutmeg too. Just can't seem to not add the little added touch to an already perfectly fine recipe...Seems as if I am not alone, though.....It turned out absolutely wonderful, extremely easy,quick and delicious...can't miss with this one.

MMmmmm...now this is what I call comfort food. I've made the recipe twice now, with slight variations. The first time, I used croissants and the second time I used left over sourdough bread and reduced the fat by using light cream and 1% milk. It was pretty good with the sourdough, but absolutely wonderful with the croissants. It's nice served with caramel sauce or a good quality ice cream.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I used egg knot bread rolls, cut back the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and used half & half .... Rave reviews, especially good warm. Would be a great brunch dish.

This was a very simple recipe. I used the exact ingredients, but varied the recipe by using butter croissants. They made the recipe very rich, but worth the splurge! Perfect for the Holiday Season! My husband had 3 helpings after Thanksgiving dinner! It's fabulous!

This is delicious, but too sweet. I cut sugar to 1 1/2 cups, it was perfect. Am going to try it with half and half and 1% milk to cut fat and calories, I'm sure it'll be fine. My company loved it!!!

So incredibly easy and delicious. I made it today with a 1 lb. loaf of french bread, but used only 3/4 of the loaf (as recommended by another reviewer) and it was perfect. I also used half-and-half in place of the heavy cream to cut down on the fat, and it was absolutely yummy. The combination of eggs, milk, and half-and-half created a rich and lucious custard. This recipe is so easy, one can make it blindfolded!

Yummy! I used sweet hawiian rolls instead of brioche, used amaretto, cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and sprinkled some toasted pecans and caramel sauce on the top. It's quick and easy to make and tastes great.

Big hit at a recent dinner party. Used croissant instead of brioche as recommended by another person. Also used a bit less bread one extra egg, a splash more amaretto and cream to make it a bit lsss dry. Great dessert!

I made this for Christmas brunch and it was a big hit! I used egg nog instead of milk (an eliminated a lot of the sugar) and it was soooo good! I think I've started a new tradition in our house!

Great variation on a wonderful childhood comfort dessert- reasonably easy to make, and classy enough for a dinner party. I made this on the run last weekend for a party of 5 at my friend's bed & breakfast in north-east ontario, and despite my estimating at a 2/3 size, not having almond extract and substituting Kahlua for Frangelico, it turned out very well, the entire pan disappearing in ten minutes after a three course meal.... It's more flexible than you think, but watch out for the bubbling in the oven, I think 40 minutes in a commercial oven may be to long. I also used some lonely and depressed bread that was just sitting around with no decline in the recipe's quality. Enjoy it!!!

This had a lovely texture and flavor, but was just way too sweet. I'm a real sweet-lover, but this was overwhelming. With half the sugar, however, it would be great. I used challah - delicious.

My husband had (unbeknownst to myself) invited all his surgeon buddies over for a celebration meal, and it was up to me(despite my on-call schedule) to come up with something timely and delicious. I chose this recipe for dessert and it was a blast! Thank you signed Dr Patu in Massachussetts

Made this for a recent dinner party. Substituted croissants (another reviewer recommended this) for the broiche -- good call. Served it with french vanilla ice cream while still warm; had nothing but praise. Everyone thought there was fruit in it, next time I'll try putting apples in it with nuts. Will definitely make it again!

I loved this recipe because it was SO easy. I modified it a little though by using croissants instead of brioche. The flakey crust of the croissants also allowed me to NOT have to do the crumb topping. The top crust ended up a beautiful flakey brown. The pudding was also LOVELY. We tried it with a warm bourbon sauce and/or a dab of whipped cream.

It was very good. My grandfather loves bread pudding,a nd I wanted to make something for dessert that I knew he would like. I did nto have Frangelico, so I used brandy. It turned out very well. Everyone loved it.

this was really great. i have been searching for a bread pudding recipe for years! but i would like to know how easy it would be to maybe 'lighten' it...maybe cut the cream or use skim milk...also, i think it was just a little too sweet. (i had planned to serve it warm with caramel sauce drizzled over it, but after tasting it, i think that would have made it too much. i had a bread pudding dessert at a restaurant in san francisco that had a wonderful tart cranberry sauce on it. that was yummy!
