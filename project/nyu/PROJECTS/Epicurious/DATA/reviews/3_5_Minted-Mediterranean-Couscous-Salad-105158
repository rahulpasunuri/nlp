I love this salad. I add a few extras: one tomato diced, half to one cup diced cucumber, a couple green onions. I've made this with basil instead of mint and is delicious as well. Enjoy!

simple, simple, simple - and DELICIOUS! i used 2 boxes of far east couscous to start with so really did not need to add the dressing, just a bit more EVOO and lemon juice - really easy and everyone raved! will make again and again........

This was amazing, and super fast and easy to make. I doubled the recipe, and instead of using all bottled dressing, used 3 tablespoons of bottled dressing, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and squeezed half of a lemon over the salad. Also added green pepper. Next time I might have to try it with cucumber. Very versatile, and I am definitely saving this recipe.

I didn't have any pepper. I added the lettuce rather than serve it on it. It was noooice! I had some couscous left over from last nite so it was very fast and tasty.

This is a great salad. I added some green bell pepper (for more color),red onion, lemon juice, olive oil and red wine vinegrette. It tastes even better after its been chilled for a while.

I fixed this as a light New Year's Eve midnight salad for my sweetie and me......it was perfect! Easy, light, and simply delicious. I used my own homemade balsamic dressing that contains a bit of garlic and whole grain mustard. Although we didn't need to eat more, we wished for seconds!

This is a P.S to my review...do NOT use bottled salad dressing, but a good quality olive oil and balsamic to taste.

This was a fabulous dish. I did add some chopped seedless cucumber. Also used Israeli couscous and chicken broth instead of water for more flavor. I served this with the Moroccan carrots from this site, and the easiest most delicious lamb, from Oprah's February magazine. Recipe follows: 3-4 lb boneless leg of lamb, trimmed of excess fat,2 T honey, 2 tsp ground cumin, 1 T ground cinnamon, 1-1/2 tsp ground black pepper, 2 tsp kosher salt. Preheat oven to 400. Place a rack on the bottom of a roasting pan large enough to fit lamb. Rinse lamb and pat dry. Rub honey over entire surface, then combine spices and salt and pat into honey. Let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes (I did an hour). Roast 1 hour and 15 minutes or until medium rare (internal temperature should be around 135 degrees; for medium well, around 145). Remove from oven and allow to sit 15 minutes before slicing. Makes about 4 servings. The aroma when this is roasting is intoxicating...almost like an apple pie. I'm trying the same rub on a pork tenderloin this week. YUMMY!

This is delicious and easy. I took a tip from a previous reviewer and added cucumber - excellent! Would make a fab buffet salad... we ate it with steaks and it was a perfect side dish.

with the right touch, this recipe is really fantastic. do NOT use a bottled vinaigrette (ever). use a 5:1 ratio olive oil to basalmic vinegar with plenty of salt and pepper. this was really great with lemon-marinated lamb kebabs (with apricots and red onion chunks) and the marinated artichoke hearts recipe, all from this site.

I use to make these salad with Kani Kama, a bit of tomato and water cress and it's grat. Very delicate flavour. The Kani Kama i use in thin stripes, It can be bought ready to be used, they call it Kani for Salad.

I first tried couscous when living in London and ever since I have been a couscous lover. I have collected many recipes with couscous the possibilities are endless but my favourites are the vegetarian ones and the ones with fruits. This recipe is a success among friends and family. I don't use bell peppers though I use regular red and green peppers and I always add at least 1/3 cup of raisins, the combination is divine and I always triple the original recipe cause we can't get enough of it.

Taste was flat. Too many competing flavors didn't seem to be able to add the complexity that mediterranian food requires.

This was so great! I have never made couscous before. How easy and tasty it is! This is a great potluck dish as well.

Served this last night to my husband and some friends - they just loved it! And two of them are picky eaters so I consider it a success. It was perfect with the Spice Rubbed Leg of Lamb from the June '01 Bon Appetit. It was easy to do - I chopped the peppers, olives and mint ahead of time and then made the couscous a half an hour before I was ready to serve the salad. I did add 2 T. more dressing but otherwise prepared the recipe as written. Yum!

Kalamata olive and feta cheese combo in anything is hard to beat, we made our own vinaigrette for this, lemon juice and olive oil mostly. We like couscous, this is one of the top recipes for us.

I prefer my own recipe which I would like to share with you: After the couscous is prepared as suggested, the following should be added: First some lemon juice (not vinegar- lemon suits absolutely better), olive oil, salt, some chili pepper (the amount depending on the taste), one teaspoonfull of tomato paste (optional) and some mint should be blended in the fluffed couscous mixture while it is still warm so that all flavours will blend better. After it will cool, some thinly chopped parsley, fresh onions, sweet green or sweet red peppers, fresh mint-only a few leaves,all thinly chopped, should be added. Just before serving, some shredded (or chopped)lettuce leaves can also be added at the last moment, because the lettuce leaves are tended to lose their crispness if they wait long in the mixture. (Diced fresh tomatoes can also be added to the mixture as optional.)Bon apetit.
