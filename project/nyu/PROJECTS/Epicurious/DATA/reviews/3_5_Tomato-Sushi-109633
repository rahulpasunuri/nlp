Delicious and attractive! The roast tomato does look like tuna. It takes some time to roast the tomatoes, but it's not active time, so you can work on other dishes while they cook. I didn't need the ice cream scooper, I just used my hands to roll the rice like I've seen sushi chefs do. Just make sure to quarter the roasting tomatoes; I cut them into eighths and ended up using two pieces per roll.

Am willing to give this a go for big "tapas" party...two questions - has anyone had success in doubling this recipe ? or freezing ?

This dish was great. It is defintiely worth trying. And another note, how could anyone offer a comment or review of this dish when they haven't even attempted to make it? The people who read these reviews do so to obtain helpful and knowledgeable comments--anyone who hasn't bothered to make a dish but still slams the recipe should post their comments elsewhere.

I guess you have to be Greek to get this recipe. It's not your Yia Yia's stuffed tomato. Yes, the execution is a bit difficult but the end results are extrodinary. My guests (all Greeks)were taken aback, not only by the taste but the presentation. I used trianglular forms, alittle more difficult, but visually beautiful.I watched Chef Peskias demonstrate this on the Today show from the Olympics and I took the challange! This recipe gets a Gold!

I have to agree with the cook from Austin. Why waste so much time making fake sushi? I could be making real sushi in all that time--and probably in less time.

It seems very plain that 2/3 of the tomatoes means just that--2/3 of the AMOUNT of the tomatoes ---like 6 out of 9 tomatoes!!!! The recipes sounds yummy and I will be making it---I like interesting veggie recipes--it will look great on a antipasto platter

I know you are looking for reviews, but I thought I might add my response to the first few comments (unfortunately, non of us are reviews) Well, I've never rated a recipe before, but I am willing to try this one. It sounds like an interesting vegetarian dish, and as my husband is lactose intolerant, I'm always looking for recipies without dairy! 2/3 of the total 3 lbs of tomatoes seems to me what the recipe calls for to be carmelized; the remaining 1/3 of the 3 lbs is chopped after peeling. As soon as I can, I'll get around to making this, and then will review it.

Is it just me or does 3 hours at 300 imply more than caramelized.... more like charred to a tiny little black bit. Especially for 2-3 inch tomatoes!!

Could not figure out what 2/3 of tomatoes was supposed to mean? Has anyone reviewed this recipe?

Hah!! I bet no one ever reviews this recipe because it it the epitome of wasted time and resources for such a silly outcome. Of course, I'm willing to be proved wrong and would welcome knowing the outcome of all the labor and exactitude required to make rice and tomato look like sushi. Really.
