This is one of my favorite all time recipes. I have been making these since my son's christening in 1996. They are still one of his favorite foods and have been popular with friends and family alike. I have never had a problem with these not being crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. I may have made some minor variations over the years--our favorite seasoning is a combination of oregano and chives and sometimes garlic, but we vary it based on what we are serving it with. We also just brush the outsides with butter and sprinkle most of the cheese on the outside--again, sometimes it might be cheddar or some other cheese that crisps out. We bake them at 425 for about 20-25 minutes flipping once and they are awesome. Anything leftover is reheated in the toaster oven for breakfast. Have probably made these about 50 times by now. they are the best.

In the end, the flavors of these polenta sticks were okay. It is hard to dislike something coated and stuffed with cheese. I had to keep it in the oven for twice as long as the recipe called for to make them solidify. They were a sloppy mess on the cookie sheet. Probably will not bother with these again.

These were just so-so. I agree with other reviewers who said they would add more herbs. I might try it again, but there are a lot of other recipes that sound great...

I guess I just never will understand the appeal of cornmeal mush. Er, sorry, I mean polenta. In my estimation, the only good thing about this dish was the expensive combination of freshly-grated Parmesan, Romano and Asiago cheese. As far as I'm concerned, this recipe was a waste of the cheese. The "polenta sticks" were soggy and flavorless, even though I took care to follow the recipe exactly, and added additional sage and cheese to the batter.

The way these polenta sticks disappeared, I should have doubled the recipe. Have made these several times and don't see an end in sight.

I attempted to make this as a starter, served with salad. They didn't set enough to be turned out, sliced and grilled!! Either I made a measuring error, or it needs cooking for slightly longer so it will 'set up'. I ended up baking it in the tray with the parmesan sprinkled over, and it came out porridgey with a 'crust' and was enjoyed for its aromatic flavour anyway. Annoyingly, what was left in the pan set up beautifully after baking... }:( So I ate it for breakfast the next day. It was tasty, and I will make again, allowing for this smally problem...

I was disappointed with the flavor of these polenta sticks, but the texture was wonderful. I will make these again, but I'll likely double or triple the amount of sage. The parmesan flavor wasn't as strong as I would have liked, but I think adding more would put these over the top, fat-wise.
