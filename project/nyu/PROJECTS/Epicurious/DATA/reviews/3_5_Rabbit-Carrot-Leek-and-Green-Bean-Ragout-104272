i really did not like this at all. i don't know if it was the recipe, or i just don't like it, you know? the rabbit was pretty tough. may have been just the way the rabbit was though.

Made with chicken and it came out beautifully. The flavor is even better the next day.

My wife never ate rabbit before so I wanted to fix something that would allow her to eat around the rabbit if it wasn't to her liking. Nothing to worry about with this recipe. I made a few substitutuions more out of convenience than anything else - shallots for the onions, tagliatelle for the potatoes, and I added a 14oz. can of diced tomatoes for some color and a little body. I also removed the meat from the bones to make this dish easier to eat with the noodles. The ultimate endorsement is that when asked if she would eat this again, she responded with a resounding "Yes!"

This dish is great with a few modifications: the rating jumps from one fork to four if you cook it overnight. After browning the rabbit, garlic, thyme, etc. on the stovetop for a few minutes, simply pop everything in the crockpot and cook it overnight. I had to increase the liquids to make sure everything cooked well. After a 18-20 hours on medium-low heat, the liquid reduced from soup-y to ragout-y and the meat was falling off the bone--delicious!

I made this dish for my family using prok chops instead of rabbit. It was wonderful! They loved it and asked that I make it frequently.

This was pretty good the first time around, but decided to "bump it up a notch or two" the second time. I substituted a can of strong beer for the wine and 1-2 Tbls (sorry, I never measure) caraway seeds and about 1 tsp. celery seed....and a little brown sugar (2-3 tsps?). And then added lots of mushrooms near the end. I also cooked it longer...2-3 hours.. meat fell off the bones. Almost forgot!! I also put in a couple Swiss sausages. Family asked that I make it again soon.
