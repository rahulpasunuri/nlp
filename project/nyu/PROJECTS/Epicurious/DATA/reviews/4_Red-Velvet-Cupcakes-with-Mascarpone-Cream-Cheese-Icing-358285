Generally I think that all red velvet cakes, like many other cakes, are simply "Frosting Sherpas", so the trick is to at least make them beautiful. As Frosting Sherpas go, this tastes darn good.

Perhaps the best cupcakes I've ever had! They were absolutely delicious and definitely a keeper. Will make again soon. The icing is fantastic with the mascarpone in it.

Can't say how the cake is, since I only made the icing. I thought it was very good. A touch better than your standard cream cheese frosting.

Made these pretty much per recipe, except increased coco to 1/4 C. Came out perfect. Color was better than most- used a 1 oz bottle and another sm. squeeze type, plus a bit extra from a jar. Color was perfect. I've tried at least 3 different recipes- this one is best yet. No clue as to why others had issues.

I have made this recipe several times. It is excellant, just to be sure to not overbake. I love the icing as well it is worth the effort and cost as it elevates the cupcakes to gourmet status. In a pinch for time I have iced them with just cream cheese frosting, that little bit of tang comes through by using the mascapone cheese. I am making another bath for a bake sale, they sold out first last year.

Loved this recipe. And, as others have said, the frosting is incredible.

I made these and some vegan chocolate cupcakes for my daughter's 1st birthday party. These were less successful by far. I loved the frosting (would definitely make it again) but the cupcake flavor and consistency were so-so at best (would not make again).

No rating because I made the frosting only and it was FANTASTIC. On this web site, there is a recipe for Red, White and Blue cake. The red layer is moist and delicious so you might try that for the cupcakes.

I LOVED the frosting but the cake was bad.

This review is for the icing only. MAKE IT. Seriously, this is the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had. It came together perfectly, I didn't have to adjust a single ingredient quantity, and it's delicious and not so sweet that your teeth hurt. I actually halved the recipe to frost 12 regular (non-Texas) sized cupcakes, which was the perfect amount of frosting. Also added a few tablespoons of strawberry puree to it before adding the mascarpone as I was frosting strawberry cupcakes. Will make this again for sure!

Awesome cupcakes - I made (23) standard sized. They sunk in the middle, but once frosted, it didn't matter. I tried one about 30 minutes after it finished baking, and wasn't impressed - not much flavor, the texture was heavy and a little egg-y. However, after they sat for a few hours, they were perfect. Light, moist, good flavor. If you are looking for a chocolatey dessert, this isn't it, but for a red velvet (cup)cake, it is excellent. I made the recipe as written except using about 1/2 teaspoon of red gel coloring instead of liquid, and using about 1/2 cup more powdered sugar for the icing to get a better consistency for piping. Great icing too, by the way - just be extra careful once the mascarpone is added, as it is a bit temperamental.

This is the best red velvet recipe I have made. Not dry at all. It had a very subtle chocolate flavor. I may try adding a little more cocoa next time. I followed the recipe exactly as it's written. However, I made whoopie pies instead of cupcakes which only required about 15min of cooking time for approx 2 tbl spoon sized pies. The icing in this recipe is the best icing I have ever tasted! It is not too sweet and has such a nice consistency. I did not use the vanilla or mint extract as I did not have either on hand. I will definitely use this icing on other cupcake/cake recipes.

My grand-daughters and I made these cupcakes for my daughter's birthday. Of course (while the cupcakes were in the oven) we realized we forgot the vinegsr and sour cream. We tried them anyway and they were good but missing something. Also, DO use red food paste because we realized (the hard way) that red coloring isn't enough. We nicknamed them Hard-Topped Brown Velvet Cupcakes, which is a recipe I would not recommend if you can help it.

Not the simplest cake recipe but sooo worth the extra labor. I make this as a cake instead of cupcakes. It has worked great as a wedding cake.

The cupcakes were fine, but not wonderful. I thought they were a bit dense and the flavor was just okay. The icing was better than the cake and not too sweet. Next time I'll try a different red velvet recipe.

The cupcakes were not great- they tasted very bread-like to me and my husband. (I doubled the recipe, which might have lead to over-beating the dough...). I'd give the cupcakes 2 stars. The frosting is a sure-fire winnner- 4 stars. I'll definitely make it again! I used it to frost chocolate cupcakes, too.

Recommend using paste food coloring instead of the liquid. I discovered that the liquid gave me a migraine (first one ever). Make the paste and add water, play with quantities to get it almost like cake batter consistency.

I actually have a question before I have a go at these cupcakes. I've been having an odd craving for cupcakes with strawberry frosting lately (thanks to a random ad for cupcakes - I've never had nor made them before). Unfortunately, I haven't found any decent recipes! I was wondering if anyone thinks it would taste good if I added strawberry syrup (from pureed or cooked strawberries) to the frosting? Not a lot, just enough to give it a hint of strawberry flavor. I know this is an odd change to make to this recipe, but it has such good reviews, I'd like to try! I'd really appreciate hearing what others think about this. :)

I needed to use up the mascarpone cheese, so I made the frosting only. YUM!!!! I made banana bread muffins and spread the icing on top. the family could not get enough!definitely, an occasional indulgence.

Holy moly, does this recipe make a ton of cupcakes!! Pretty good little things, too. The frosting is divine:)

I can't speak for the cake because I used a standard chocolate recipe but I couldn't pass up a review on these because the frosting is simply outstanding! Every guest at my 3yo's bday party raved about it. I will never go back to plain old cream cheese frosting again! Delish!

I just made the frosting to top carrot cupcakes. OMG so delicious! Not too sweet, and very creamy. Instead of vanilla, I subbed a teaspoon of lemon zest. One note: If you're piping this frosting, keep it on the cold side, as it tends to make less crisp designs if too warm.

Made these for a friend's birthday, everyone loved them! I made regular and mini cupcakes, which I piped chocolate fudge frosting into the middle. The mini cupcakes were eaten so fast! People loved that it was a rich little bite, the regular sized cupcakes went slower, and some were cut in half.

I made these for a birthday brunch this weekend, my goodness they were good! I made 4 dozen mini-cupcakes (baked for 12 - 14 minutes) and another 10 regular sized cupcakes (baked for 18 - 20 minutes). These will definitely be in regular rotation for future events.

These were a big hit. I didn't use the large cupcake tins so it made over 2 dozen. I added a little less red food coloring the second time because I don't like them quite as red, but they were still moist. Cake flour is a must on these. I love the frosting, but it is an acquired taste with the Mascarpone.

Excellant cupcakes, made 26 and everyone loved them young and old. The icing was amazing, just don't refrigerate it before icing, needs to be rm temperature. People all ate them, some said they were just going to taste them, but had to eat the whole thing. Next time I am going to bake them a day early, I think they will be even moister. Definitely a do over.

This is a recipe that needs both the cupcake and the icing together to make it really work. The cake flour is really important to make a light cupcake and the icing is amazing. Follow the ingredients list exactly Overall, I made them for coworkers who actually thought I bought them because the flavors worked so well together. This isn't a sweet cupcake but one of my favorites. Adding this to my list of go to desserts

I used the icing from this recipe with the Magnolia Red Velvet cupcakes and it was delish. I really like cream cheese icing with red velvet so it worked perfect!

the cupcakes were actually really awful. I did use food coloring gel instead of liquid food coloring - not sure if that is what did it but they tasted really awful. I made them for fourth of july and put blueberries on top to complete a red, white and blue theme. The frosting and blueberries were licked off the cupcakes which were tossed.
