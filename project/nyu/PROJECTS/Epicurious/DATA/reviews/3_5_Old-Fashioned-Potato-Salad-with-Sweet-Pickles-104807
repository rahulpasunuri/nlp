Ihave been making this potato salad for years and everyone loves it. I always put a little bit aside for me because I never have leftovers. The only other thing I do is mix up some French's mustard with the real mayo. Why ruin a fabulous potato salad with fake mayo. Potato salad is not on any diet I have ever been on so why sub with fake mayo; it's a high carbo dish anyway.

This is an old timer recipe. My sister has been making this for at least 35 years. Instead of sweet pickels, you can use dill, I like them both. I use more egg sometimes.Be careful with the onion make sure you cut it up coarse, same with the celery. I much prefer this recipe then a vinegar type. This is so good, make extra for snacks all week long.

Very good and easy. I prefer to add a bit of milk and mustard and I cut back on the mayo. Loved the pickles in it.

I'm not a non-fat sorta person so I made it with plain ole mayo. Used unpeeled red new potatoes. I also used bread and butter pickles - not sure if that is what was meant by "sweet pickles". Didn't think I would like the pickles in it - I was wrong. I loved it and so did my family.

Hey, Olewinemaker - why bother suggesting a totally different recipe? And a lesser one at that! This is great and tastes yummy like the south...

The only thing I miss about my ex-wife is her potato salad. This recipe comes very close to what she made. Its great but not so terrific that I would entertain thoughts of proposing again!

This reminds me of the recipe that our mother learned from her mother-in-law and was always served with fried chicken on a hot summer day, in addition we (mom, my sisters and I)add chopped black olives, and a little mustard and instead of red onions we use green onions stems and all for color. A crowd pleaser at any pinic and comfort food around our homes.

Hmmm, everyone else had much better luck with this recipe than I did. I cooked the potatoes nearly twice as long as directed and they still weren't done. I thought there was too much liquid--I'd prefer a creamy texture. And the salad didn't come together flavorwise. I'll keep looking for a good potato salad recipe.

This recipe is tops! It has the taste that I like in a potato salad - and SWEET PICKLES ARE A MUST! I made this for a cookout and everyone loved it! I sent the recipe home with one guest to make for a family reunion.

Simple, defenatly a must for our family, everyone loves potato salad and always want to try new ones, this really went over big at our reunion. I don't understand why anyone would try a new recipe with pickles in it if they don't even like pickles, and if they want to diet let them diet but let us who like to try new recipes enjoy trying them without rude remarks.

I know that this is a no-no, but I hard cook the eggs in the same pot as the potatoes. This is a very good potato salad recipe, and I would definitely make it again.

I agree with the Florida cook. A deli man once told me the secret ingredient in deli made potato salad was sweet pickles. I used regular mayo instead of non fat and stirred milk into the mayo to liquify the mayo and make it easier to mix into the potatoes. Used a regular sliced onion since I didn't have a red one. Brought it to a family get-together and everyone loved it.

Okay everybody, this is southern-style potato salad, it's not meant to be gourmet. Even though I love all kinds of potato salad and love to experiment this will always be my favorite. If you don't like sweet pickle relish, don't bother, but don't insult.

This potato salad recipe is reminiscent of the Southern ones I grew up with in the 1950's. I did use a Vidalia onion in place of the purple one, substituted a commercial sweet pickle relish for the sweet pickles and juice, and used regular mayonnaise. My husband,who is not all that easy to please, liked it too!

Very simple to fix this - Keep the potatoes,celery, Throw out the mayo,eggs,pickles,and pickle juice. Add instead three cloves garlic,1/2 cups sliced olives and 1/4 cup good olive oil and toss. Perfection.

THIS RECIPE MAY BE HEALTHY, BUT IT SURE IS LACKING IN TASTE AND CHARACTER.WHAT'S UP WITH ALL THE PICKLES AND PICKLE JUICE? POTATO SALAD ISN'T WHAT ONE WOULD CALL A DIET ITEM! THIS ONE IS BEYOND REPAIR.
