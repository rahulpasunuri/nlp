I tried this cake, following the recipe exactly as is and found it delicious. It had a light, delicate flavour and a very nice texture. I served it with whipped cream and strawberries and plan on making it again for my daughter's birthday!

I made this for the family this evening, as we are trying to reduce our consumption of wheat flour and refined sugar, but occasionally want a traditional dessert. It came out perfectly: extremely light and fresh, and not at all eggy. I made a few changes: used 150 grams ground almonds, zest of 2 lemons and juice of 1 lemon, and omitted the cinnamon. We ate it with some rasberry preserves and creme fraiche. Very nice. If I was making for guests, might make two, and layer jam in between, or spoon fresh berries over the top or even create a lemon drizzle to go over top.

Made this cake for dessert tonight. Served alongside whipped cream and strawberries. Followed recipe to the letter and it turned out perfectly as far as I can imagine. Other reviewers have said they had issues with the cake falling or tasting too eggy. Mine did not fall and did not taste eggy either. The flavor and texture was really wonderful. Do not however expect this to be a typical cake. Since you don't use flour or any traditional leavening (besides whipped egg white) it is slightly more dense then a traditional cake. Similar to a torte I suppose but less dense and dry. It is very good, just different. I will definately make it again due to the simplistic recipe with terrific result!

I had relatively low expectations based on some of the reviews, but this cake blew me away. Before I started the low-carb diet that has taken 50 pounds off my body, baking was a passion. This item is very low-carb for an all-natural dessert. Using the USDA nutrient database, I calculate this cake to have 9g of carbs per serving, about 1/3 the carbs of the lemon-almond pound cake recipe on this site. Aside from the minimal amounts of sugar and salt, this is a cake that could be part of a paleo diet! But even if I weren't eating a low-carb diet, I would love this cake. It's light, not too sweet, beautiful in a rustic way, easy to make, and unique. My hunch about why it doesn't work for some people is that they aren't beating the egg whites to the proper consistency. BTW, I used 5 egg whites rather than 4, because I broke a yolk. Maybe that helps?

Very good recipe; it's not a show-stopper, or else I would give it four forks. I did find a recipe for almond ice cream (ironically, it called for no milk...the ground almonds made all the "cream") on a Spanish recipe site, and I marveled that the flavor and ingredient profiles were nearly identical; it was as though we had the ice cream-and-cake take on lemons and almonds. I highly recommend pairing this as they suggest, or else it might just be a tad boring. it was very easy to make, and turned out great. And the fact it's gluten free should be a plus; the ice cream recipe was even vegan, as it called for no eggs, and it used water rather than milk! So this could be a great dessert for all kinds of diet-restrictions!

I ate this cake at a friends house and loved it. I had a similar cake when I was in Spain. The taste is very authentic and so is the texture. I loved it and can't wait to try it myself.

I didn't make this, but to the cook who found it "too eggy," my thinking is that the curd cooked too hot and too long and you made scrambled eggs instead of lemon curd...

Made this dish for a gluten-intolerant friend... The entire party loved the cake and it finished very quickly. I just sprinkled powdered sugar and served it up. I left the almond a little bit coarse (for texture) and added a teaspoon of rose water for flavor. The cake cooks faster than what the recommended time (mine was done in about 20 mns). Overall, a good easy simple and healthy recipe.

This recipe went straight to the trash - right along with the cake. I couldnt get over the akward flavors. My cake collapsed during baking - and I didnt open the door. It tasted like a sweetened extremely akward omlette - toooooo eggy. There are A LOT better cake recipes on epicurious. Pass on this and opt for something else.

I made this for a wheat intolerant person and it was okay. Nothing special. Cooked it for 25 minutes and it fell quite a lot. Frosted it with cream cheese frosting flavoured with Cointreau and lemon zest.

This cake is a winner. I double the recipe, make two cakes and put a layer of raspberry jam in the center and make a lemon icing - its a knockout. I didn't have a problem with the consistency of the almonds...I made it for my friends the day before their wedding and it was the perfect light confection for a warm day.

Also made this for a friend who cannot eat wheat. It was just so-so. Would be good as tea cake for a ladies luncheon. If you are going for a delicious wheat-free dessert, after a nice dinner, go with a flourless chocolate cake.

I found this cake to be quite unusual, but then, I'm not certain I've ever had a flourless cake before. Once I got past the unusual texture (I think I should have ground the almonds a bit more), I quite enjoyed it - and so did my guests. I served the cake with lemon curd and a berry compote and it was a nice combination.

I made this cake for friends who don't eat wheat or dairy. We liked it pretty well though I think maybe I overcooked it a tad. Mine baked for about 25 minutes and that was probably about 5 too many. I am also not sure if I didn't grind the almonds enough, but I didn't care for the slightly mealy texture. I also added a simple icing on top which was a very nice addition. Our friends love to try new things that they can eat on their diet and enjoyed this cake. I will definatly try it again and experiment a bit.

I must have done smething wrong, because this was probably the worst cake I've ever made. Flat and tasteless, not lemony, cardboard texture. Fortunately I made a test recipe just for "us" before making it for guests.

Very good, even without the almond ice cream.

I made this cake after having a different flavor of flourless cake. It was impressively moist and fluffy. Now I make this for a friend who cannot eat glutenous foods, and he loves it. This cake served to give him hope that he would still be able to have a variety of foods, and in particular desserts. The 4 forks are for the perspective it has given my friend. I make it regularly now.

Have made it twice and gotten raves both times. Great flavor and texture. Watch the baking time, though; in my oven it only took about 25 mins., not 35 as the recipe says.

We made this cake for a birthday, double layer, filled the center with lemon curd then frosted it with a light lemon butter frosting and served a fresh large strawberry on the side. Excellent flavor and nice presentation. Great for allergy to flour.

This was a huge hit! Instead of grinding the almonds super-fine, I left tiny chunks. This gave the cake a great crunchy texture. I also substituted lemon sorbet for the almond ice cream. Terrific recipe!

When I made this I used almond flour and I used too much because the cake was quite dense; I will try the recipe again, using less almond flour, because the flavor was great!

This was a very interesting cake. Nice flavor, nice texture and easy to make. I do think it needs an icing. It would be a little too plain without one. I made a light, creamy lemon icing and topped it with blackberrys. Everyone loved it!

I served this cake with a mixed berry topping. It was delicious. I'm going to make it for a passover dinner this year!
