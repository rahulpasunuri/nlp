I chose to modify this recipe right from the start so take my 4 fork rating with a grain of salt. After my modifications the recipe turned out fantastic! I used 1/2 cup basil and 1/2 cup parsley instead of all parsley. Instead of Parmesan cheese I used crumbled plain Feta. I chose to forgo the chicken broth since I wanted my pesto to be very thick. I think that the taste of the pesto could only be improved by using the chicken broth.

Not terrible, but to quote my roommate, maybe if I buried it in something else " you might be able to forget that the parsley is eating you alive".I added more garlic and probably doubled the parmesan, but there's no mistaking that parsley bite! This is definitely a take-it-in-small-doses kind of spread, as opposed to basil pesto that I want to eat straight. I can imagine it as a try-it-once thing at a dinner party - it is interesting at least.

Simple, and a nice change from basil pesto. Not to mention incredibly nutritious thanks to the parsley! I used almond oil, and froze it. Usually I add the cheeze post-thaw but I forgot this time... not too worried, tho'!

I loved this recipe! I combined about half this recipe with cream, sauteed onions and mushrooms and cream which I served over linguine. This also makes a wonderful spread for crackers.
