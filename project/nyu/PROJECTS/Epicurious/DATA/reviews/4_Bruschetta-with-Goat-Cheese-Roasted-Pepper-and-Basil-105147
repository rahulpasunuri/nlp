Very Easy and such a hit with dinner guests. I also use jarred roasted red peppers and a big smear of pesto. The basil leaves on the top are such a "must do" This is my signature "dish to pass" at parties. And brings many requests for me to make :) ...and I'm very proud when it is ALWAYS the first empty tray :) One time, by accident I bought a jar of sundried tomatoes instead of the peppers and that was really good too.

Very nice - nothing exceptional. This recipe is for the cook who is looking for something easy and good. Don't be intimidated by charring your peppers - it is very easy and they taste delicious.

DELICIOUS!!! I sliced a baguette and drizzled it with a tiny amount of olive oil before assembling and heating. I wanted to make this treat bite sized. It worked SO WELL! I am also very glad that I roasted a fresh pepper myself. The taste cannot be beat.

I just took this to a New Year's Eve party, and I received compliments on it. I used bottled red peppers, as others suggested, and they were fine. I also rubbed the toasted bread with garlic, which added a nice kick. I was expecting this to be a little dry, based upon comments here, but I think the result was really the perfect combination of toasted and soft. I did heat the bruschetta for a fairly good length of time, so maybe this helped it be less dry. Also, since I needed to pack these to take to a party about 5 minutes away, I covered the cookie sheets with foil to transport them not long after they came out of the oven. Maybe this also helped to soften them a bit, as it trapped the warm moisture. (The basil was not ruined at all by this, by the way.)

Everyone loved this one! Simply used jarred red peppers and followed user suggestions to spread pesto on as well. Also sprinkled asiago cheese on top just before warming and salt just before serving--brought out the flavors!

This is very simple to make and is something that I've found most guests will devour at a cocktail party. Instead of using small baguette toasts, I use a variety of breads sliced thin to make larger appetizers. Good quality goat cheese (strong, but not too strong) is essential, as is fresh basil.

This was outstanding. I added just a bit of thinly sliced onion and a few drops of extra virgin olive oil. Although the bruschetta stole the show, I also served scrambled eggs - using eggs our chickens layed just hours before. I drizzled the eggs with white truffle oil. A great meal! Bruschetta was the best I've ever had. It will make you smile!

Very good. I used small, sliced baguette that I misted with olive oil. Would definately make this one again.

Wonderful combination of flavors, plus it's easy and quick to make. Used jarred roasted red peppers as per other reviews. Next time, I'll probably try an herbed goat cheese. This is definitely going to be a "go to" recipe for me.

So easy and raves from the family for Christmas Eve. Used an herbed ciabatta sliced & toasted. Didn't use the olive oil per comments, but next time I might. Used jarred roasted peppers, so much easier & very good goat cheese. Will do again and again. Thanks for all the great tips in comments. Did some with just goat cheese & pesto for variety. The fresh basil made it.

Took the advice of others and made the following substitutions which shortened the prep time even further. Used roasted red pepper from a jar and diced it. Added a smear of ready made pesto. Also added a splash of balsamic vinegar. Delicious!

This is a great recipe. Very impressive. I didn't try the olive oil suggestion, but I will next time because it was a little dry...but overall very good!

I have made this appetizer several times with big success. However, instead of using just plain basil leaves, I drizzle the goat cheese with pesto and then place the red pepper on top of that. The garlic and cheese in the pesto give this recipe an extra kick.

I wish I'd read all the comments before I made this. The olive oil drizzle would have been especially helpful because I thought this dish was very bland. I made it, however, on several pieces of smaller bread. Next time I think I will maybe brush the bread with olive oil first, then toast, then rub with garlic. Maybe.

Anotherwinner. Super simple, looks great and tastes even better. For an even simpler version -- instead of rubbing the bread with garlic, use a garlic spray! I use the garlic flavored PAM type spray.

A lovely change from the usual. I roasted red, yellow and orange for the colors and it was beautiful on the plate as well as in the belly!

We used a jar of roasted peppers which worked well-however upon reading other reviews we like the idea of mixing colored peppers. Also, we drizzled olive oil and had cracked black pepper over the top of our bruschettas which added extra flavor! MAKE IT!!

Very easy recipe! Very colerful presentation too. I also used jarred peppers. Next time I'll toast the bread first with some olive oil, then rub some garlic on top before adding the goat cheese & peppers. I will definitely make this again. I have to, it's just so easy!

So easy, colorful, and delicious. The last time I prepared these, I also roasted asparagus with a little olive oil, salt and pepper in a 400 deg. oven for 30 mins. I cut the stalks into manageable lengths and topped some of the toasts with that instead...Kind of holiday-ish, with the red and green.

Wow - this recipe is Fab! It was not only delicious, it was easy to make. Roasting your own peppers was the most difficult task and that takes 10 minutes!

Wonderful dish! Next time I would chop up the peppers and basil for the benefit of the presentation. Also, to save time I used the jar roasted red peppers....they worked just as well (if not better).

Have the ingredients waiting, when everyone is comfortable with drinks, take a friend into the kitchen, assemble and bake. We presented the warm bruschetta on a large silver platter; it looked and tasted great. (We used a French baguette, instead of country bread)

I own a catering business. I had an event where I served various appetizers for 150 people. I saw this recipe and thought I'd give it a shot. The only thing I changed was using both red and yellow peppers. It added more color! The bruschetta turned out incredible! They were absolutely gorgeous! The guests couldn't get enough!
