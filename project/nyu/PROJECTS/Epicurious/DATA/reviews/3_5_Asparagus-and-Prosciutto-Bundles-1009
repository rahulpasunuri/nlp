This was a great make ahead and take to a party appetizer. I used both ends of the asparagus - not just the tips. (Blanched them first). Did not use the pine nuts, but did use more goat cheese -- probably 4 oz. Love the idea of adding a bit of water -- makes cheese spread better. (The prosciutto from Costco works great -- cut in half, perfect size and the paper makes it easier to roll.)

Made this as part of an engagement party menu 2 yrs. ago for my sis. The crowd ate almost everyone. The leftovers are still delightful the next day.

Easy, elegant and delicious!

I should also add that I used far fewer asparagus than the recipe calls for, but kept everything else the same. I probably spread a lot more cheese on than the recipe intends, but I thought it was good like that, and not "too much."

These were terrific and everyone at my dinner party loved them. I didn't really notice the taste of the pine nuts either way, but they certainly didn't hurt. I increased the orange zest a bit, which I thought just amped it up, made it more zippy. The cheese really helps hold the proscuitto together. A delicious recipe!

I roasted the asparugus on a cookie sheet with olive oil & seasalt (400 degree oven). Delicious!

Too much trouble and unnecssary. Perhaps I put too much of the goat cheese mixture on the prosciutto. This overpowered the other two items - flavors did not come together well. Prefer asparagus wrapped with prosciutto without any additions. Less work and you can really taste both items.

The goat cheese mixture was good, but I think I may have used too much per bundle. The flavors of the 3 items did not come together well. I prefer prosciutto wrapped plain around asparagus.

My neighbor served this at a recent get-together. Absolutely delicious. She substituted cream cheese for the goat cheese.

Sorry, but I did not like these. I used the thinnest of asparagus and Chevre goat cheese, but the cheese had little or no flavor and the prociutto gave the whole piece a salty, but not pleasant taste. Good thing there were many other offerings.

I made these for a party and they were a big hit. I did cut the goat cheese with some cream cheese to save on costs (party for 150). Freeze the proscuitto for about 5-10 minutes to ease prep.

I have been making this appetizer for years and it is always the first plate to be cleared!! Sometimes to save time I use a soft cheese spread - such as alouette - it doesn't taste quite as good, but it is still fantastic! I also find that you can don't have to trim the spears down so much and you can use just one spear per wrap - helpful since they disappear so quickly. Cooking tip for beginning cooks - I've found this method of cooking asparagus is the best way to cook it. Every time I'm making asparagus I prepare it this way. It always turns out crisp and delicious!

This was very yummy! I made this for a cocktail party and it vanished. Put the sheets of proscuitto in the freezer for about 10 minutes before rolling them and they won't stick together.

This dish was a hit at my party, but I found it kind of time consuming to make because the prosciutto is so sticky and doesn't want to stay in thin strips and roll up easily. My friends enjoyed it and I would make it again. Using herbed goat cheese adds extra flavor.

WOW! These are so tasty, pretty and easy to make! It is easy to adjust any of the ingredients to your liking. I added a bit of cream cheese to mellow out the goat cheese for friends that don't like such a strong flavor. Enjoy!

This was incredibly easy and delicious. I received a lot of complements. Highly recommended.

I made this for a brunch and it seemed VERY rich. Maybe too much filling. The prosciutto is so salty and rich, I think the classic wrapped asparagus without filling is hard to beat.

Great! - I've served this many times. Be careful not to have proscuitto sliced too thin or it will fall apart

they were tasty but not spectacular! A lot of work for a dish that disappears in 2 seconds. I doubled this recipe and they were still gone in minutes. Also, I never ended up using the stalks of asparagus, so it seemed kinda wasteful.

I had trouble with this one. Most of it of my own making. The prosciutto I purchased was thin and kept falling apart as I rolled it around the asparagus. The filling squeezed out through the cracks and looked pretty sad on the serving platter. The flavor was good, but I let the asparagus cook for too long so they were slightly limp. One minute in boiling water is all it takes. I would go slightly lighter on the orange zest next time as well.

This was savory, unique and easy. It was a great addition to a picnic spread I did, and to my surprise it traveled well.

This was a hit with all of our friends at a cocktail party recently. The flavors all blended well and complimented one another. The recipe was very easy to prepare. This is a great appetizer served by itself or would be an excellent addition to an appetizer buffet.
