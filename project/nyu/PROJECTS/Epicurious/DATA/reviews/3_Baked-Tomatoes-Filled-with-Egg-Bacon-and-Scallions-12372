I served this at a brunch and it made a beautiful presentation. My only problem was getting the tomatoes to cook. I must have microwaved them 5 times, then upped the temp until it was baking at full capacity and they STILL never softened. Finally, got them to softten just the slightest bit so called that part done. I didn't want the same thing to happen again so after successfully nuking the bacon, I cooked the eggs on the stove, adding a little 1/2 and 1/2. Then topped the stuffed tomatoes with pepper jack cheese for a bit more flavor. The cheese did melt in the microwave after 2 rounds. My guests loved the dish, raw tomatoes and all. I will make this again, but may bake the tomatoes in the oven.

The scrambled eggs were delicious. In this northern European country, Monterey Jack is fairly nonexistant so I substituted the always available Jarlsberg, and it worked just fine. I agree it would be a nice addition to a buffet brunch and I would present the eggs stuffed into the tomatoes. But for another informal family dinner, I believe I will slice the tomatoes into rounds, and mound the egg and cheese on top. I served this with roasted rosemary potatoes which worked very nicely with the bacon and mustard flavors.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. Would make a fantastic addition to any brunch. I also think you could make some interesting variations by adding different herbs and cheeses.
