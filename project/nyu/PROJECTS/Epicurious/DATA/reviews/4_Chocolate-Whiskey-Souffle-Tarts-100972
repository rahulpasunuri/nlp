It all worked out well, and everyone loved it - but I did have one problem. When I removed the bowl from over water and whisked in whiskey, vanilla, coffee and salt the mixture turned granular. Not sure what I did wrong, but returning to heat and whisking until it was all smooth again worked.

Served these to our Gourmet dinner group and they were a big hit! Even those who normally "nibble" at dessert cleaned their plates. Will definitely make these again.

I've made this recipe a number of times. Easy & delicious. Everyone always raves about the crust which is really easy to make. I made this recipe at christmas but I didn't have any whiskey on hand so I made it without. Big mistake. The whiskey gives the souffle just the right texture.

really fabulous!! Made them for dessert for company and everybody loved it. The only thing I changed was instead of using all whiskey I used a drop of whiskey and the remainder Godiva choc. liquour. Really good!! Loved the salty crust and sweet filling contrast.

I made this for dessert for St. Paddy's and was really looking forward to it as the smell of the filling as I was mixing it up was quite intoxicating and would have delved in right there and then if not for the raw eggs. I decided to make one whole tart due to the successful reviews of the previous reviewers. I don't know if it was due to my never having made a souffle before, but it never cracked on the top (and I even baked for an extra 8 minutes!). Then I didn't know if I should wait to cut into it but I couldn't wait to taste it so I cut into it only to have ooze out everywhere. My husband and mother- in-law still wanted a piece so we had some and it was a little gooey but still delicious. Put the rest in the fridge and found to my delight that it set up nicely in the fridge (at least the parts that hadn't been lost to the initial ooze). Wow, wow, wow!! The flavors had melded and the crust was spectacular. I made the crust in my Kitchenaid mixer with the paddle attachment and with patience it comes together very nicely. I will definately make this again but maybe in individual tartlets as stated or the whole tart after a good chill in the fridge.

Very rich almost like a hot chocolate meringue/ mousse. Then there's the pastry shell to add to the richness. I'd rather have these than a flourless chocolate cake- these have a little chewiness in the fudgy texture. Made for a St. Pat's dinner and found them an easy dessert for entertaining since you pop them from the freezer to the oven and end up with something hot and fresh. I may try them in a smaller tart pan next time though, since a 4.5" tart is quite large for how rich these are- I ended up saving more than half of mine for later.

Rich and delicious. Made one large tart in a cheesecake pan, skipped the topping all together. My teenagers and husband loved it and every speck was gobbled up.

Fabulous and a great end to a St. Patrick's Day meal. Easier to make than I expected. I made the eight individual tarts and found I almost didn't have enough crust. Once baked. they were fine and they were quite sturdy considering how thin they were. Elegant dessert with ingredients often already in your pantry.

Crowd pleaser. I will definitely make this again as an outstanding ending to any meal. It's simple, unique and de-lish! Be forewarned... when making the crust, it doesn't look like a dough, it has kind of a powdery consistency. But never fear, just press it into the pan and it makes the most delicious crust. (It tastes like a butter cookie!) I made one big tart as opposed to the small ones. This one does not disappoint.

I have been making this dessert since last St. Patrick's day and it has been a hit at every occasion. You can store them in the freezer for longer than a week as well and have a great mid-week special dessert with no hassel! I highly recommend this. And use good whiskey - it's worth it!

These tartlets were delicious, with a very dark, not sweet, chocolate taste. Make sure to serve them fresh out of the oven, because the souffle got tough pretty quickly.

I made mine in a large springform pan as well and it turned out wonderfully! It took about an hour or so that way. I served it with homeade whipped cream and it was devoured!

I thought that this was a delicious dessert. In error, I accidently used smaller individual tart forms, and felt that the crust to filling ratio wasn't enough, but that was my mistake. The filling mixture was wonderful. Next time I will probably make one large tart because the filling stays dense and not runny at all. I will definitly blind bake the crust because it puffs up alot during baking. Everyone loved the dessert. I had extra filling and put it into two extra custard cups, and ate them both myself...really, really great filling!!!

I am anxious to make these, but wonder if I thaw them before baking? Thanks

This is by far one of the easiest recipes not only because it can be made ahead but also that it keeps for three weeks. We just had the leftovers from St. Patrick's Day last week and they were a big hit.

I made this dessert for my wife's birthday today and it was a "piece of cake." I accidentally used granulated sugar instead of powdered sugar for the crust and it still came out well. I also thought it waaass suuposed to be 4 cops instead of a 1/4 coup of whyskey. It was deeelllliiiiccccious.

This recipe was a real loser for me. When I first made the crust the sides sunk and I was left with a tart-sized cookie (which tasted delicious). I used pie weights when making the second crust, so the sides stayed up. When making the filling I used Callebaut chocolate, which tends to be a bit more bittersweet than other chocolates and the 1/3 cup sugar in the recipe was not enough. The resulting filling was boring in taste and did not go with the crust. I have made many delicious chocolate souffle-type recipes, but this one will not be numbered amongst them.

These are amazingly delicious and sinfully chocolaty -- a huge hit to finish our Easter lunch. It's even more wonderful that they can be made ahead of time and frozen. One note -- my baking time was 13 minutes, not 20, so check them early and often and remove from oven as soon as they start to crack.

This is a 5-Star recipe & elicited rave reviews from everyone except Charlotte (poor girl doesn't like chocolate)! I made one large tart. The crust was crumbly until baked and then tasted like a sugar cookie. The top never cracked, so I removed it when it browned slightly on the edges;it was slightly overdone - remove from oven before it browns. The top was crusty and the inside like soft fudge. Delicious!

Simple but good. Made a large tart in a 8-9" pan- probably should have used a 10" but other than that, it was a huge hit. Made raspberry coulis for the sauce- great balance of rich and tart.

I made this as the final course in an eight course degustation menu for an easter dinner. Despite all feeling quite full from the previous courses - no one left any at all. I made it with some rasberry coulis to cut the richness a little. Rave reviews.

This was amazing - it wasn't hard to make and looked great. Rave reviews from people who dont usually rave about dessert. The chocolate doesn't totally freeze so, be careful when transporting or touching the top before you bake it.

This was delicious. I was a little nervous about the crust when I was making it. The mixture was very crumbly...so I pressed it into the pan. The crust ended up being perfect!! The dessert itself was very rich. A raspberry sauce would also be nice... instead of the cream!

This was the hit of my St Patty's day party last year, and my guests are asking for it again! I made 24 very small tartlets - and topped with whipped cream and a chocolate decoration. It was not difficult to make, and was a very memorable dessert. I've made it many times since.

Excellent recipe. My very picky brother even loved it. I made one large tart instead of 8 and it worked out very well.

It is a chocolate dream...not as hard as it seems...one of our dinner guests asked for a second...but one tart is definitely enough. The extra tarts (uncooked) kept well frozen for a week.

This was delicious and not really hard to make, a Chocoholic's dream. It is a make ahead recipe, good even after several days. An elegant touch is candied violet on the whipped cream served alongside.
