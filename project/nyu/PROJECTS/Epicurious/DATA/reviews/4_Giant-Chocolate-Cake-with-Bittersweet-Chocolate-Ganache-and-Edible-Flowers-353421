Easy and absolutely delicious. Beautiful crumb. I made it for a party and my husband was very disappointed I didn't bring a piece home, but it's so easy I'll just make one for him! Like other reviewers, creamed the butter and sugar and alternated dry and liquid. I baked it in 2 9-inch pans. My new chocolate cake recipe!

This was one of the most terrible recipes I've tried out from epicurious. Usually I have a very good experience.The cake was moist definitely, but it was also very dense and difficult to eat. Also overly sweet! I would suggest anyone trying this to reduce the quantity of sugar from what it says in the recipe. The ganache was also overly sweet and can have the amount of sugar adjusted as well. The ganache did not somehow get this luxurious satiny mouth-feel, but was slightly cheap tasting. I'd give this recipe a miss the next time!

I was looking for a new chocolate cake recipe. I've been using Hershey's recipe for the past few years, but it is so fluffy it's not very suitable for carving. This cake is the ticket!! Moist and carves very well, complements buttercream frosting perfectly. I too thought the preparation looked insane so I just did things my standard way (beat sugar and butter, add eggs, alternate wet and dry, add boiling water last and stir in by hand). A+

This was a delicous and very intense chocolate cake. I used 2 9-inch pans and assebled a layer cake out of this. My husband and I enjoyed the cake, but we definitely needed milk to help us to finish a slice:)

This recipe is among the best buttermilk chocolate cakes I have made and it's easy to make. PS: To hcpage: The butter for the ganache has to be cold only because it's easier to cut it

Rating: 4
Overall this was a phenomenal cake. Everyone raved about how amazing it was. Pouring the boiling water over the cocoa really brings out an intense chocolate flavor. I noticed a slight grainy texture to the ganache in spite of using a very expensive unsweetened dark chocolate. I think next time I might try using bittersweet dark chocolate and decreasing the sugar to compensate. Aside from that the cake and ganache were by far the best chocolate cake combo I've ever made.

Rating: 1
What am I missing here? The cake was okay though the instructions were bizarre. Adding pieces of butter after eggs and sugar are beaten? Why not cream the butter and sugar and then add eggs? Add chilled butter to the chocolate when it is going to be melted with hot cream and sugar? I've made a lot of cakes but this made no sense. Cake itself was fine, nothing special but ganache was so dark as to be inedible. And I used good chocolate. I made it for a special birthday party and was embarrassed by it. I've made knockout cakes but never this one again.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made this and it was delicious. My second time I used half granulated sugar and half light brown sugar. I also divided it into two 8in cake pans. I iced it with my own version of a peanut butter mousse frosting. Oh my gosh......the cake was moister and fudgier than the original and the PB frosting....yum!

I used for cupcakes and just cooked until knife was clean. made 24. The cake was so light and fluffy and tasted heavenly with butter cream icing that I made with a hint of Almond.

I have made this cake several times and it always has turned out great. For large parties, I have doubled the recipe and filled it with a jar and a half of nutella. That was amazing, but if it dries out a little you can use raspberries or something else wet. I have also substituted milk for the buttermilk. That turns out ok if you are stuck, but the texture really isn't as good.

That's some crazy cake! Deliscious! Very choclately, dense & not overly sweet. I did make a couple of adjustments: -baked it in a bundt cake pan i/o extra large round. I just baked it for 45 min to compensate for shape. -replaced 1/4 cup water with brewed espresso -reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups -melted 2 oz of unsweetened dk choco with some of the butter for extra chocolate flavour. -I made the killer icing as is, wow. yum...

I love this cake because I don't really like frosting and I think the ganache is perfect. I got the cake nice and fluffy by sifting and beating everything a bit extra. Once I was out of cocoa powder, so I used chopped Mexican chocolate instead and cut the sugar. The edible flowers lend a bitter taste, I prefer raspberries or strawberries.

Rating: 4
I don't have a lot of faith in cocoa powder to be chocolatey enough for me, and I hate coffee, so I used a tablespoon each of creme de cacao liqueur and black raspberry Chambord along with the boiling water. Good call. Also, instead of making it a giant chocolate cake, I made them into cupcakes--AND I WHIPPED the ganache and piped it into flowers on top. Yummy and gorgeous.

This is a great, classy chocolate cake. I have also used this recipe to make an awesome ice-cream cake - halve the cake batter recipe and use a regular sized cake pan; halve the layer with a serrated knife; put a layer of ganache; add a layer of ice-cream (my fave is starbucks java chip which I prepare by melting a bit and refreezing in a springform pan), add the second layer of the cake and cover with ganache. I am trying to copy cold stone creamery's ice cream cake and this is way way better. Yum.

Great cake, moist and rich... Three suggestions...First, use high quality imported chocolate from Latin America or Europe, second, use a European unsalted butter(higher fat content equals a denser moister cake), third, dust liberally with cinnamon!

This was the best Chocolate cake I have ever had. The taste was delicious, moist, and had a rich smooth texture. I made it with 3 six inch layers for a very tall and dramatic presentation and a Nutella frosting placed between the layers for contrast and additional flavor. I poured the ganache over the top and let it fall over the layers and puddle at the base which made an elegant and beautiful presentation. I will make this my #1 choice for the future.

WONDERFUL. I didn't find it to be as dense as the one pictured appeared to be, but it was still delicious. Very moist... I think others might be over baking so check it early. I used two 9x2 cake pans and they worked perfect at 350 for 30 mins. The ganache is wonderful... I increased by 1/2 to make sure I had enough for a filling layer. Perfect amount!

I made this for Valentine's Day this year, and I was really disappointed. Personally, I thought the cake was a little too airy, not very moist nor very sweet. The ganache I made for some reason was very liquid (it did taste delicious though). It made a MESS. Overall, too much trouble for a cake that was mediocre.

Rating: 4
very simple and elegant cake. i was worried at first because the batter wasn't very tasty, and the cake looked a bit dry coming out of the oven, but the ganache apparently fixed everything. the cake was dense without being overly rich, sweet in just the right ways, and beautiful to look at. it's not an earth-shattering dessert by any means (see: cuban opera cake), but a handy recipe to keep around, and perfect for a large crowd.

Rating: 2
Huh, I actually didn't like this cake much at all. Tastes mostly of bitter cocoa powder. This is a very course crumb so not good for layering even though it's thick enough for 2 layers. That is fine in itself, it's a moist and good consistency. I added rum simple syrup which was a nice addition. But ultimately, I have other chocolate cake recipes which I much prefer.

I made this cake for a dinner party. The guests loved it so much that they asked if I could make one a couple of weeks later for a big birthday party! I didn't have a 12 inch cake pan so I used a 10 inch springform and it worked just as well.

Rating: 4
This may be the best chocolate cake I have ever made. I didn't have a 12" pan, so I used a 10" springform, and that worked perfectly. I added espresso to the cocoa powder and stirred in about 1/2 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, as another reviewer recommended. The result was rich, moist, and simply delicious. The ganache is excellent-- didn't change a thing. I got lots of compliments. My father-in-law said it was the best cake he'd ever eaten. It's a keeper.

A winner. Had friends over to watch the men's hockey and 2010 Olympic closing ceremonies and celebrations. Cake also a winner. Easy to put together. Took suggestion of substituting some coffee for the water, good chocolate flavour. Have bookmarked for future dinners and events. Ganache was perfect... used good dark chocolate (semi-sweet) so reduced amount of sugar.

Amazing. Instead of a ganache, I used two buttercreams (made the cake tall and 5 in round): lemon milk chocolate and ginger dark chocolate. It was a major hit! I'd highly recommend it. It was moist, wonderfully chocolately, dense, and all-around fantastic. This may be my go-to chocolate cake recipe.

Just made this cake for v-day. It was a huge hit at our dinner party. Baked in two regular 9" cake pans and stacked the layers with a thin layer of ganache between. I live at 4400 ft, so I added ~3 Tbs flour and baked for ~27 minutes. I also added 2 Tbs instant coffee to the water before adding the cocoa. Will definitely make this again.

To start with I have NOT made the cake but it will definitely go on the list to try. I have a problem with this very common idea that "edible flowers" are just this garnish, the taste of which is irrelevant, and any old mixture will do. Perhaps in this case the chocolate is so strong that the flavor doesn't matter, but they have great variety and should be enjoyed for this as well as their appearance. Agreed, it is nearly impossible to find anything but that often less than fresh mixture in the package next to the herbs at the grocery store, but...

I made this cake for a surprise 60th birthday at a restaurant. The owners wanted the recipe, and every guest gave rave reviews. I made four 9" layers, and made a fresh raspberry puree in between two of them. Covered the whole top of the cake with fresh berries, and dusted it with grated sweet chocolate. Pretty as a picture and a complete hit!

Made this recipe for thanksgiving and no one could believe it wasn't from a fancy bakery. I made a two layer cake with 8" pans (2" high) instead, and doubled the frosting recipe. My brother was upset when I didn't make it again at Christmas, he said that it should be the thing I make for every holiday.

Just made the cake, not the ganache. Made 1/2 the recipe at 6,300'. Delicious! Made a few changes, based on other reviews and elevation. Added 2 eggs + 1 egg white, chocolate chips, reduced sugar, substituted whiskey and coffee for some of the water and oil for the butter. Didn't have buttermilk, so did the substitute of 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 tbsp vinegar (let sit for 5 minutes before adding). Topped with sifted powdered sugar. Moist & chocolaty out of the pan. Will definitely make again.

I made this cake because it got such a great rating and 100% of users would make it again. But I was a bit disappointed. I felt that this cake was mediocre at best. It was a dense cake which was fine. The flavor was nothing to get excited about. My quest to find a great chocolate cake recipe continues.

served the same day i made it, i found this cake extremely "cloying"--too rich and sticky. i'm glad i waited before reviewing, though, because the next day, it improved dramatically in texture and taste, and was one of the best chocolate cakes i've tasted. i would definitely wait a day before serving. i also used coffee in the recipe- just a 1/4 cup deepened the flavor without giving a coffee flavor. kids did like it, but it is quite rich.

I like this recipe. I made a two layer cake (had some leftover batter) and I whipped some of the cream and added some of the ganache to it and made a type of mousse between the two layers and then frosted the rest of the cake. Got great reviews. Am making it again tomorrow for a party.

Good, not great. Very easy to make and the texture turned out perfectly. Why do people buy cake mixes? The batter fits in a 9"x13" pan (adjust temp to 325 if you use glass). However, I LOVE the Inside-out German chocolate cake on this site. It has a awesome frosting and you can sub that for the coconut/pecan filling if you want a more traditional chocolate cake.

I've made this cake twice. I'd ordered the 12" pan and used it the first time, but as noted, storage for that size is very difficult as it won't fit inside any cake dome I own (and is tough to find room inside the fridge). For the 12" size, I made and used most of the ganache but increased, with a 1.5 factor on the ingredients. The 2nd time, I made the cake in a 10" round pan that I already owned (not a springform) and just didn't use all the batter, leaving room for it to rise. The regular amount of the frosting was more than enough. I added a heaping tsp of espresso powder to the hot water. I also mixed in mini chocolate chips the second time, for more chocolate flavor and moisture, and highly recommend it. The cake greatly improved in deepened flavor and color after two days at room temperature, unfrosted, but kept well covered. Frosted, and with some candy flowers or other decorations, it does make a very nice presentation, oohs and ahs, and that was borne out by the deep chocolate flavor. It is not cloyingly sweet, just very chocolatey, as I tweaked it.

made the cake-- looks great so far. the ganache is in the fridge as we speak... it says i can do a day ahead.. does that mean i it will taste good if i put the ganache on also from a day ahead... and what else can i use for a giant dome for over my cake... it was a hard enough getting a 12" baking pan..hehe

Does anyone know how much it filled the 2" deep pan? My only options are 2 9" pans or a 13" pan. I am thinking I should go 13" (I like the idea of the large cake since it's for a party). Hoping to make this tomorrow if anyone can help!

An excellent chocolate cake recipe that worked well at 5,000 ft (unlike most cake recipes). I did have to adjust the temp to 375F. Also baked it in an 11-inch pan. The texture was excellent - dense and moist. I used plain baking chocolate in the ganache as directed and was surprised by the quality of the result. Next time, I will add 1-2 tsp of espresso to the cake batter.

Rating: 3
This cake earned rave reviews from my friends. Parchment paper was key for getting the cake to release easily from the pan. I made the mistake of chilling the ganache for too long so it was too hard -- I was at a loss for how to fix this so I put it in the microwave for one minute on 'defrost'. The ganache lost its glossiness, but it softened up enough to spread. In the end, no one cared what the ganache looked like since the cake was moist, rich, and delicious.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday, and it was outrageously good. I didn't have a 12" pan, but I did have a 2/3 teaspoon measure, so I reduced the recipe by 1/3 and used a 9" springform pan. This worked perfectly with a bake time of about 45 minutes. I cut the ganache recipe in half, and the cake was still very rich. Sinfully delicious topped with blackberries and freshly whipped cream.

Note to person who said they've looked high and low for the pan: Just Google "12" cake pan" and you'll get all kinds of hits, including amazon.com The cake is absolutely perfect! And thanks to the person who used the orange syrup - I copied your idea and it was wonderful.

Bought the big pan and made 2 cakes so I could try one before my party. Cake was nice but a little blah. I'm sure it would have been good with the ganache frosting (which is exceptional!) For my party cake I made a simple syrup flavored with orange extract and brushed it on before frosting with ganache. WOW what a difference. Light orange flavor brought out the taste of the dark chocolate without overtaking it. Definitely a keeper recipe!

this is worth buying the big pan for. The most laughable instruction is "cover with cake dome and refrigerate" let me know if you ever find a cake dome big enough. . . other than that, it is really delicious and people love it. Not too rich, which chocolate cakes with ganache frostings can be. I never got around to the flowers, but the second party I brought this to really liked the rasberries all over the top. . .

Wow- Best chocolate cake recipe ever. Brought this to a dinner party over the weekend and folks had seconds and thirds.

This is a very rich cake -- and very good. I made it in two 9" round layers, but other than that it was as written. I also attempted to make a mousse to go between the layers, which didn't go so well, but that had nothing to do with the recipe, just that I'd never made a mousse filling before and was trying to do it at the last minute with no clue. I don't know what the best filling would be if you made it as a two-layer cake, but it really doesn't need anything more.

This cake was very simple and delicious. It is moist and tastes great. Unfortunately though - almost nobody ate the flowers - I suggest that you candy them by brushing with egg white, sprinkling with sugar and then drying (but it is great as is). I also garnished with raspberries.
