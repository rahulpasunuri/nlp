I don't really like radishes, but we get tons of them through our CSA, so I've been trying to find ways to enjoy them. This one is great!

Delicious and very pretty. You need to spread a generous amount of butter on the baguette to get right texture and flavor.

Great recipe. I used about 3/4 tin of anchovies to 1 stick of butter. Skipped the kosher salt but sprinkled a little truffle salt on top of some of the servings. It was delicious both ways, with and w/o the truffle salt. We at so many we had to cut back a lot on dinner!

The flavours in this recipe compliment each other beautifully. I was a little skeptical due to the simplicity but found them addictive and could not stop eating them. The anchovies do not impart flavour so much as they do richness and depth of flavour which is what makes a simple recipe taste complex. We are salt lovers so I sprinkled Fleur de Sel with the chives over top. I will definitely make this again.

My husband and I love anchovies, when cooked into a sort of paste, so I baked some bread and gave this recipe a go. I used a much higher ratio of anchovies (1 tin) to butter (1/4 cup)--subbed margarine, forgive me!-and used dried chives, topped with radishes from the garden. It was delicious! A great spread, and the saltiness of the anchovies really rocked the taste of the radishes. Will make again, great as an appetizer or with a pasta or salad with sauteed shrimp.

This is delicious. Simple and easy, I made the butter with anchovy paste, and I think it would be better with the fillets. I used arugula instead of chives, by just placing it on top of bread and butter. I prefer a milder radish, so I used daikon.

Excellent idea for canapes and quite delicious. But you must like anchovies, otherwise why bother with a review?!!!!!!

Really good. Ignore the first review and at least try the recipe before you comment. I love the salty, and crunchy radishes. The butter tames the heat of the radish and the anchovies add a unique salty taste. Anchovies are used in lots of seasoning and salad dressing so if you think they will be gross you might be pleasantly surprised if you try it.

This recipe I guess is for people of open enough minds to appreciate cuisines different from their own. I enjoyed it the most with oblique sliced french bread and it is rather nice to add rare roast beef to this open faced sandwich. I am a professional chef myself and would never use the word gross just because I don't enjoy another's taste.
