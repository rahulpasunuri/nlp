I have never made curry before and I was afraid I wouldn't like it. I was wrong! This is so delicious! I used tips from other reviewers and added more ginger, garlic and curry powder. I also used coconut milk and white wine instead of the sherry. I used boneless chicken which I prepared and then added to the sauce after it thickened. I did not use (coriander) cilantro as I hate it; however in my opinion the green would look nice in the sauce. Next time I will use less soy sauce as it made it a little too salty in my opinion, and may add lemongrass to see how that works. I will be making this again and again.

Do NOT use cream of coconut--use coconut milk instead. The Cream of Coconut is way tooooooo sweet. I will make this again making this change.

This is so unbelivable good when you double the garlic and ginger, use a whole jalapeño pepper and add lime zest. I used cut up boneless chicken and put the whole thing over rice. It was so delicious!!

Superb! This is the kind of recipe that you can adjust according to tastes and available ingredients and it is still delicious. I generally followed the recipe, but paying less than perfect attention to measurements. The changes I made were sesame oil instead of vegetable oil; 4 boneless breasts cut bite size; coconut milk instead of cream; 1 heaping teaspoon of curry powder; 3 whole jalapenos; 6 garlic cloves; 2 tablespoons of ginger. I didn't have the red peppers or the lime, but I can see where they would fit in nicely. I didn't tweak the soy sauce, broth, black pepper or sherry measurements (don't leave the sherry out - it doesn't get lost in the flavors at all, and it does provide a smooth, velvetiness amidst the spice). We LOVED the outcome - buttery, spicy, fresh from cilantro and ginger flavors, and I served it with homemade naan instead of rice. When I added the cilantro and peppers, I added "Purple Haze" carrots, sliced into sticks. I almost didn't try this recipe out because there are some poor ratings, but I recommend you try it and don't be shy about tripling your spice and herb content. I second that suggestion to have everything cut first - then it's easy peasy, and well worth the 30-40 minutes it takes. Yummo. Our house smells delightful.

Great recipe! Adding more curry, garlic, ginger and jalapenos will take care of the blandness; half the soy sauce will cut on the saltiness and use coconut milk instead of cream if you don't like too much sweetness.

This recipe was a bit bland. I had everything except the Cream of Coconut so I used Coconut milk intead. I agree with previous reviewers that more spice needs to be added. The sauce came out nice and thick (to coat the chicken and rice) but could have been more flavourul. I didn't it find it too difficult to make as I prepped all the ingredients first, then it was just a matter of adding them in at the right time. I would make it again but up the spice factor (ginger, garlic, curry, pepper). It was pretty good for a first go around...

I thought it was great until... I added the soy sauce. Overall a nice and easy dish to prepare and not to intense for my 4 year old (well developed palet on this one) but next time will use Fish Sauce to get the saltiness instead of Soy Sauce.

My new favorite coconut curry recipe! Fabulous. Added more jalapeno because we love it hot! And always add more ginger and garlic!

This was good, but not great. I'm not sure I'd put the effort through for this again. There are other curry and coconut dishes on this site that I think are better. It's not bad, mind you, the sauce is actually tasty. I just expected more from a recipe that took such effort. I also think if I did this again, I would use just chicken thighs.

This is a great recipe. Definately double or triple the ginger and garlic though. Im making it a 3rd time and my husband loves it, reminds him of the flavors from our honeymoon in Thailand. :)

I added 4 tablespoons of natural peanut butter to the recipe. Also, One has to be careful not to use sweet cream of coconut, which I by mistake did. The dish got too sweet. Except for that, this was a delcious dish.

I was a little confused about some of the wording of this recipe (kettle, coriander). I am very familiar with coriander powder/seeds, but not the fresh. I went looking for "fresh coriander" at a gourmet market, and was disappointed not to find any. I later got home and thank goodness for the dictionary on this site, coriander is the less familiar word for cilantro, which I had on hand! Whew! Also couldn't find cream of coconut, just asian style coconut milk or coco-lopez coconut cream for making drinks and desserts. Other than not finding an 8.5oz can of cream of coconut, and using chicken breasts instead of legs, I followed the recipe to a T, and it was excellent. I didn't need to add any additional salt to the finished product, it tasted salty enough. However, we did spread some sauce over plain rice and that's when the sauce went fairly bland.

Rating: 3
Very good, even if it didn't seem totally authentic to me. Instead of jalapenos, I used Thai bird peppers, which are hotter. And I wonder if the cook from Quebec City used something like Coco Lopez or other sweetened coconut cream instead of unsweetened Asian style coconut milk/cream.

Rating: 3
I play around with recipes but tried to stay on the safe side the 1st time so I substituted: large dice boneless chix for the legs, 1 can coconut milk for cream of coconut & chopped roasted red peppers. If necessary thicken with cornstarch mixture. WONDERFUL - am making for a group of 20 next month!!!

I used to think over 90% approval on epicurious was a sure thing. I've changed my mind, this was too much work for the results. I'll keep looking for Thai and until then I'll plunk out $5.95 at our local Thai spot which is awesome and a lot less than I spent on this recipe.

Rating: 2
I entertained a large group so I doubled the recipe. I used one can of coconut milk and one can of coconut cream. The cream is really too sweet...has no business in this recipe. I wouldn't bother adding sherry as its flavor gets totally overwhelmed and lost. I added fresh red peppers rather than jalapeno, since jalapeno is sometimes not 'hot' at all. Still, the overall effect was sweet. In desperation, I added fresh basil and rice vinegar, as much as the sauce could take before tasting too 'vinegary'. I will not repeat this recipe.

Delicious and very creamy. At first bite, I thought it was missing a something, but once I settled into it I enjoyed the flavour and richness of this dish.

I thought this recipe was very good and wonder what it would be like if I hadn't made some substitutions. First I cut the recipe in half, and I didn't have any ginger so I used ground dried ginger. I also left out the jalepeno and used a whole can of coconut milk. I tasted the sauce midway and it was very salty (though I didn't add any), but it mellowed a lot with more simmering. Will make again.

With 1/3 the coconut milk, it's great!

Great Recipe. Double the garlic and ginger. My suggestions: do some prep work first, it really helps out with your timing. Also, normally I am NOT a fan of a lot of substitutions, however, it was really necessary in my case. I did NOT have coconut milk, which was obviously necessary. I scouted another recipe and they suggested milk, 1 tbsp brown sugar and a handful of baking coconut. It worked! Also, my husband does not like red bell pepper and I really wanted to sneak in some veggies. Suggestion, 3 rough cut carrots. I love the flavor of ginger and carrot in carrot cake, so I thought it would work, and it did. These suggestions make it possible to use all supplies you currently have in your pantry.

I will try this recipe again, however, I will follow some recommendations by other reviewers. Will try 1/2 coconut milk as I thought the sauce was too sweet. Increase garlic and ginger. I only used 3/4 of 1 jalapeno (don't like too much heat) but could have increased amount.

Just ran across a killer deal on fresh chicken breasts and stocked up. I remember making this dish a while back and never got back to give it a rating. IT WAS EXCELLENT! And now that I have totally blown the diet during the holidays and having the chicken on hand, I will be enjoying this dish this evening and cancelling the planned stir fry....maybe tomorrow. Don't hesistate - MAKE THIS DISH!!!

Rating: 4
This recipe is one of my favorites to make. It doesn't take a while to prepare and yet it is still excellent! The flavors come together perfectly. The only change I made was I used chicken tenders. The coconut cream instead of milk is a must. By the way, if you like chicken & coconut, try the Crispy coconut chicken and red bell pepper sauce recipe on this site. Much more work, but sooooo good!

This recipe was the bomb! There are so many different wonderful flavors... delicious. Tastes like a gourmet cousine at nice Thai restaurant. I added juice from 2 whole lime, more garlic, the half of a bunch of fresh basil, and 5-6 heaping Tblspns of Thai Green Curry paste. And I definately recomend adding some fresh baby corn and snow peas (at the end, before serving so that they stay crisp). I had 2 ladies over for dinner and they wanted the recipe... told them it was a family secret... lol.

I'm a Thai-food-fanatic, and I was disappointed in this recipe. There was too much black pepper and soy sauce. I salvaged the dish but wouldn't make it again without extreme modifications.

I really enjoyed the complex flavors in this dish. I changed a few things...used boneless skinless chicken thighs, added some brown sugar, fish sauce and rice vinegar, lots more garlic and ginger than called for, and two big jalapeno peppers. I also used Suki's curry paste (a bay area staple) instead of curry powder. It made our house smell heavenly! My husband and I just loved it!

Didn't follow the recipe exactly as I couldn't find the coconut cream, used coconut milk instead. I found this made a difference (probably) as the coconut flavor was lacking. I would pump up the coconut (if the name is in the title it should predominate right?) Used the Thai Curry paste you can find in the supermarket and fish sauce. It came out alot hotter than I like but my roommate went crazy for it. I also added carrots like you'll find in curries as it seemed bland with nothing else.

Rating: 3
I am like many of the other reviewers: I didn't think the recipe given was spicy enough. I increased the curry and added a bit extra cumin, but most importantly changed the jalepenos to serranos (with seeds and all). Two minced serranos did the trick. I also used chicken breasts and coconut milk, and added lime zest along with the juice. I served it with saffron rice.

Rating: 3
Wonderful chicken dish - very flavorful, lovely color and tantalizing aroma. Revised a bit: used lite coconut milk and added 1 tbsp. brown sugar, juice from one lime, garnished with lime zest. Very rich, even with the lite coco milk. Not quite as spicy as I hoped - next time will add some Thai chili paste or increase curry and jalapenos. Served with jasmine rice, lemon garlic green beans, and Sesame Coleslaw from this site. A lovely Asian dinner that had my husband drooling as soon as he walked in the door! A definite keeper!

I made this excellent dish for guests and everyone raved, even my husband who claims he doesn't like coconut or curry! It tasted just like my favorite dish at Thai restaurants. Made a few changes, with help from other reviews: used boneless chicken breasts, cut into large chunks; coconut milk (not cream) plus 2T brown sugar; eliminated the sherry and black pepper; added 2T fish sauce; used 1 heaping T green curry paste instead of curry powder; substituted lots of basil for the cilantro; added the peppers at the very end keep them crisp. Forgot the lime juice, but no one noticed -- they were too busy eating! I served it over basmati rice. Also made Carrot Salad w/ Lime and Cilantro, and Cucumber-Yogurt Salad (both from this site). A totally Epicurious meal!

This recipe was a hit at my house. I used chicken breasts cut into a little-bit-bigger-than-bite-sized pieces (like in panang) and I used coconut milk instead of cream of coconut (I couldn't find it and c. milk worked fine). Also, rather than following the 'add this, cook for a minute, then add this, cook for five minutes...' instructions, after I cooked the chicken I just threw everything together and cooked it until I had the consistency I wanted. Worked for me. I'll definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
This was absolutely DELICIOUS! I used 1/2 coconut milk and 1/2 coconut cream because of the reviews that claimed it was too sweet with just coconut cream. It came out perfect with the slight change. Also, it really only fed 3 of us, so if this is the only dish you are serving, keep that in mind. Otherwise I highly, highly recommend this to everyone!

This recipe was one of the most exotic/easy recipes I've run across in a long time! It was outstanding. I used unsweetened coconut MILK (not coconut cream, which is typically sweetened) as I assumed it had been a typo. I will definitely make this again and again.

I thought it smelled funny while cooking (I think it was the sherry), so I added extra Coconut Milk and some sugar and it turned out fine. I also added chopped onion w/ the green pepper. I didn't have coriander or lime juice, but it still came out good. Very rich, but tasty. My husband loved it.

Made this last night. My husband and I thought it was just great but a little on the sweet side. Next time (and there definitely will be a next time) I'll use coconut milk instead of cream of coconut. I don't like spicy and was a little nervous about the jalapeno but I ended up adding even more. Double the lime juice and cilantro. Absolutely worth making again!!!

This is the best chicken dish I've ever made/had. The only substitution I made was to add thinly sliced pimentos at the very end. (instead of bell peppers) Will definitely make this again!

Very tasty,nice presentation. I used chicken breasts cut in strips and added sauteed onions. Just a bit sweet for my taste with coconut cream so next time I will use half cream, half milk. I also cut bell pepper in strips and added at the end as others instructed. Also, I will double the sauce, it is so delicious on rice (I used basmati). Definitely a "company" dish.

My husband and I love this recipe especially over jasmine rice! I made a few changes in it the second time I made and WOW, it was even better. I left out the sherry and red bell pepper, swapped Thai basil for corriander, and used green curry paste. And it tastes even better the second day. This is now a regular in our kitchen.

Restaurant quality dish...I did substitute Siam basil(Thai Holy Basil) for the coriander, used boneless chicken, added thai peppers and a little fish sauce. I also add the red and green peppers the last few minutes so they don't get soggy. This is an absolute favorite! I grow Thai basil in my garden every year just for this recipe.

This was an excellent, flavorful dish! I can't wait to make it again. I served it with jasmine rice, fresh green beans and an appetizer of spring rolls with spicy peanut sauce. A terrific Thai dinner! Thanks a million for the recipe.

This was my first try making Thai food and so I followed the directions almost exactly. Because I have a two year old, I didn't add the jalepeno...but I missed the spicyness in the finished product. The taste was superbly rich, with a nice sweet edge and very subtle spice. Tasted even better the next day. Will surely make this one again.

This chicken dinner was the best chicken dish we have ever had. We used a 14 ounce can of coconut milk and 2 tbsp of brown sugar instead of the cream of coconut. We also thickened the sauce with a little corn starch and water. The results were fabulous. Guests will ask for seconds.

This dish was terrific! I made it last nite when we had friends over for dinner and it was a VERY BIG HIT! No small feat considering the fact I live in the Federated States of Micronesia (in the Western Pacific) where everyone has a "great recipe" for chicken cooked in coconut...Didn't have fresh coriander (can't get it here) or jalapenos, so used 2 Tb. ground coriander and a couple small, local hot peppers. Also added 2 Tb. brown sugar while everything was cooking. My "other half" (who's Micronesian) said "Mark this one!" That means definitely make it again. A winner!

Rating: 4
Guests love this dish. I substitute a hearty Tb. of Thai Red Chili paste for the curry. Because it is so rich, I usually add 1/2 can (or more) of coconut milk. In my favorite thai restaurants, the red peppers are just barely tender, and I much prefer to add large pieces of red bell pepper during the last 5 minutes of cooking--when they are cooked for the specified 20 minutes get soggy and disappear into the sauce. I've tried a lot of Thai recipes and this is the best I've found yet--almost as good as some of my favorite restaurants!

My husband and I loved this recipe. The only thing I changed was boneless chicken breasts and not quite so much jalapeno. I did use Cream of Coconut. Excellent!!

QUESTION...Is this recipe better with coconut MILK or CREAM of coconut? The first reviewer suggested adding sugar, so maybe cream of coconut is better? Anyone?

Rating: 2
This was just awful made as is. It was salvageable, though, by adding about 1/3 to 1/2 cup brown sugar at the end to sweeten it up a bit and to take away the salty, almost bitter flavor (I used low sodium soy, even). Then it was quite good, but I would definitely stray away from the exact recipe if I were to make it again.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! But I had to personalize the recipe to make it a bit more authentic... I increased the amount of coconut milk (you should use coconut milk not cream of coconut), flour and curry and did away with the Sherry. Added a touch of fish sauce, sliced onion and used green and yellow bell peppers (sliced instead of chopped). Also, rather than jalapeno peppers, I used red Thai peppers (more flavor and heat). Jasmine rice is a must! Great Flavor, Great Presentation...Will definitely make this one again!!!

This is a great dish, with tons of different flavors. I don't like dark meat, so I make this dish with skinless, boneless chicken breast. Note that I believe the recipe calls for "cream of coconut" which is different than coconut milk. Cream of coconut is sweet and can be found in the cocktail fixings section of the supermarket.

Sinfully delicious and remarkably easy. The flavors blend together well. However, I would caution cooks that all soy sauces are not the same . If you use a very concentrated and salty soy sauce, the 1/4 cup will probably be too much.

I've made this countless times. It's worth the fattening coconut milk. Guests think it's exotic and wonderful. Make the extra effort to find jasmine or basmati rice to serve with this...and make a lot of rice -- you'll want to douse it with sauce.
