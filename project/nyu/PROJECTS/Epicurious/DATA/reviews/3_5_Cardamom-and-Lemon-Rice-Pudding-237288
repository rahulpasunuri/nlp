I've only made rice pudding once in slow cooker but it used uncooked rice - I used Italian rice. I cooked it a little too long and it wasn't mushy but softer than I like. I don't usually have left- over rice, so I'll probably stick my other recipe. Also, I like using Japanese ibizu rice (Pink Pearl?)or sushi rice as the rice holds up well to the cooking.

Easy to make, and fantastically yummy. Added 3 more cardamom pods for good measure, and as my slow cooker was filled with lamb I used a La Chamba clay pot in the oven instead: slow cooker on high is about 300 degrees in the oven, low is ~200. Ate it warm.

Tasty rice pudding. I used brown rice and needed an extra half hour on low to get the liquid to absorb. To prevent the eggs from scrambling, I added them (and the cream) at the end like the traditional rice pudding recipes call for. The rice still had some crunch but only because I used brown rice.

I love the flavor, however I got a scrambled egg type of texture as well (another reviewer had this problem). I am not quite sure how to fix this. I will try by decreasing by 1 egg next time!

I was looking for a slow cooker rice pudding and came across this recipe. I skipped the cardamom and added cinnamon at the beginning and sprinkled on more at the end. As it was cooking, I didn't think the milk and cream would absorb, but at the very end it all soaked in very well.

This is a standby in my house. I've used extra sushi rice, basmati rice, etc. It's a very forgiving recipe with an excellent flavor. That being said, in my zeal, I've gone overboard with the cardamom at 7 pods, which was still edible but overpowered the lemon zest. All in all, this is my favorite crock-pot dessert.

Probably it's all my own fault: I used leftover rice from chinese takeout, and didn't have exact measurements but thought it was around 3 cups, and then only had 3 eggs so reduced milk by a cup, and, well, all seemed to be going well until it came time to turn it down to low, and then when I came back after feeding the baby and making dinner, the eggs had scrambled on me. Was it the imprecise measurements? Too much rice-to-milk? Left it alone without stirring too long? Left it on low longer than an hour? Not sure. BUT, it was delicious. The flavors are amazing together. My husband's reaction was "I thought this was supposed to be rice pudding", but he ate a bowlful. And I keep going back to the leftovers in the fridge, weird as they may be. And will be for a week or so, because it makes a TON. Definitely will try again, and will follow the instructions next time.

I haven't tried this yet, but I intend to very soon. I usually use a long grain rice (basmati) to make rice pudding and love the texture even after it has been cooked twice. I wonder if a medium grain results in a softer texture than the long grain would. I will let you know.

After reading some of these reviews about mushiness, I was a little afraid to make this. Bu I had some leftover rice, made it and it is really tasty. Didn't have the cream or raisins and had ground cardamom only, but the flavoring, particularly with the lemon zest and spices make this really tasty. I very much enjoyed this. I've done baked rice in the oven, and this doesn't stand up as firm as that, but it's very easy, and I liked that.

I expect rice pudding to have distinct grains of rice, not to be "mush". Still, I am anxious to try this one.

To littlepecan from Brooklyn, NY - Isn't rice pudding essentially a soft mushy dish? Were you expecting something more the texture of a risotto or a paella?

The flavors are great but the preparation is mushy! Cooking the rice beforehand, then cooking in the crock pot for two hours resulted practically in baby food.

I made this for a coffee get-together, with a couple of quick breads and a fruit tray, and everyone really liked it. I served it warm. I used all whole milk, no cream, and couldn't find green cardamom pods, so just sprinkled in some ground cardamom. I wasn't paying attention, and ended up cooking on high for over 2 hours, but it came out fine. It was really good, and my kids scarfed up the leftovers when they came home from school, cold from the frig.
