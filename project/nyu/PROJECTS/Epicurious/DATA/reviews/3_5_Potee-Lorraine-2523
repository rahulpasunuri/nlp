This should say serves 16 not 6 and it just tastes like pork cooked in pork water with mushy vegetables.

Excellent meal. I left out the green beans as it just didn't seem like they belonged. Didn't have room for them anyway! This recipe does make a ton of food... I divided into 8 portions and they were certainly GENEROUS portions at that!

Talk about tasty and satisfying comfort food--this is it. Other than adding another carrot and some additioal oil when the bacon grease ran out, I followed the recipe as written. It's amazing how that small amount of cloves adds an interesting background flavor and works so well in combination with the bacon flavor. I don't think I'd play around much with adding other things, because I wouldn't want to lose that clove background. I might try adding some garlic next time, just to see what that does. You would need 6 very hungry people to finish the pot on this one. I would say you get more like 8 normal servings. I will half it next time, because even though I enjoyed it thoroughly, I don't want to eat it for a week.

i reduced the amount of pork shoulder by one-half and added an equal portion of ham... i also added some polish and chirizo sausage in an attempt to replicate a meal i had recently at an alsatian restaurant in montreal... this recipe is simply awesome and is a highly recommended fall season comfort-type recipe...

I usually find simple and plain dishes the best but I thought this was a bit too basic. To enhance flavours I added some fresh thyme, some paprika, some white wine vinegar (it definitely needs it) and I substituted turnips with Belgian endive. Having done that it was rather good. Perhaps I'll make it again.

This was soooo good. I did not cook the cabbage, potatoes etc separately but just added it straight into the stew when it was time to do so and let it cook with the meat. Same with the beans. I was pretty happy with the results.

This has become a staple dish for our annual Nouveau Beaujolais party. No fancy ingredients, but delicious and easy to make.

Great stew. But watch out because it makes a TON. I didn't have a pot big enough.

This is a great cold-weather recipe; have never tired of the taste... Invite a few friends to dinner and share. You will be asked for the recipe

This is a fantastic recipe. My family is orignally from Lorraine--so I was very interested in making it. Have served it for several dinner parties--always to rave reviews. When I originally read the recipe I thought it would be boring...the cloves add a lot of flavor. I always make it in October (with the windows open) and the neighbors always ask me what smells so good!!!

I have made this recipe many times. It is a great cold weather meal. It definitely tastes better the next day after the flavors have mellowed.
