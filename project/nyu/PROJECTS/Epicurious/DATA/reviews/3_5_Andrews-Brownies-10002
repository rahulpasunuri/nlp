I've made these countless times. They're perfect with a little cocoa powder added and baked for only 20- 25 minutes in an 8" square pan. Having tried this recipe so many times, I can say without hesitation that though it is possible to substitute other kinds of chocolate, sticking to the original recipe (plus the cocoa powder, which isn't really necessary- I just like an extra-rich brownie) yields the best results. They're dense and fudgy inside (and plenty thick baked in an 8" pan), and the edges are chewy while the top is shiny and crispy. The only way these could be ruined is by over- baking. My oven would definitely burn these at 30-40 minutes.

A very nice simple brownie recipe. It was extremely easy to make and quick as well. The brownies had a wonderful texture and everyone loved it. Maybe next time I will add just a little bit more chocolate, but I will make these again. A very nice SIMPLE brownie.

I have made these brownies since the recipe appeared in Gourmet years ago. As easy as box and just way better. We have spent years overseas (Africa and Spain) and every single time I make these I get endless requests for the recipe. I often double the recipe (6 eggs and all) and make in a 9x13 pan and cut them small. Works great and makes ALOT. My husband's name is Andrew and he thinks this was all created just for him. Works for me!

These were easy and tasty. i thought they were nice and fudgy. I subbed cocoa powder and butter for the unsweetened chocolate since I didn't have any on hand. also i melted the chocolate chips and butter in the microwave. next time i might add peanut butter chips to the batter, just because pb and choc is a great combo.

For me this is the recipe I turn to when I make brownies and my family loves them. They are more fudgey than cake and I like it that way, minus the nuts.

These brownies were O-K. Nothing spectacular... just brownies. I would much rather spend the time making box brownies than these. I'm not sure what everyone is raving about...

YUM! The second time I made these I did 1/2 semisweet chips and 1/2 milk chocolate chips; both variations were excellent. I've finally found my "better than the box" brownie recipe!

These were very good brownies. I also thought they had a great texture, not too fudgey and not too cakey. And just sweet enough (they don't leave you with that sugar coating on your teeth!). They came together so easily. I baked for 26 minutes and they were wonderful.

I've been looking for the best brownie recipe. They've always been pretty good, but I kept thinking better was out there. Here it is! I can stop looking now. Thanks!

The perfect brownie for me. Brownie preferences can be very particular. Some like 'em fudgey, some like 'em cakey. This recipe is a great balance between the two - not too cakey and not too fudgey. Just right for me. This replaces my previous standard brownie recipe of 30 years. My only change was reducing the sugar to 2/3 cup - just my preference to avoid them being overly sweet.

I used Sharffen Berger Bittersweet and also some Belgium chocolate I had on hand in place of the chocolate chips.This recipe is just wonderful, I have a new classic. Thanks. Don't skimp and use the best chocolate for those special occasions.

Yum! We loved these fudgy brownies. I used dark chocolate (guittard) and did not use walnuts. I also poured 2/3 of the batter into the pan, placed a layer of After Eight mints on top of the batter, and then added another layer of batter. The brownies were hell to get out of the pan, but were moist and fudgy and dee-lectable. Go Andrew!

Chocolate desserts are not my favorite but these brownies were delicious and sooooo easy to make. Everyone liked them! They can be prepared in less than 15 minutes (not including baking time), so there is absolutely no reason to ever be lazy and use a package mix for basic brownies!

These are really easy to make and are the best home made brownies I have ever had. my son (age 7) and my niece (age 5) made them on Sunday night right before we ate dinner and they were just out of the oven when we ate them with vanilla ice cream with them....oh so good! Exceelent, excellent, excellent. I have sent this recipe to all of my friends.

Good basic brownies. I added about 1/3 cup of coconut, which added a little moisture and texture. I'll make these again!

This is an excellent standard recipe. Not fancy or challenging, but if you need a good, functional recipe this is excellent.

This is a very good brownie recipe, not much more work than a prepackaged mix and tastes pretty similar, though a little better. If you're looking for something really different or spectacular, this is not it. But for a standard brownie- delicious, perfectly fudgy, not overly rich, this is it.

Easy and delicious! This is a great receipe - whoever Andre is, he deserves our applause :) I used 2 oz of Gh. (powdered) unsweetened chocolate and a little bit more than 1/2c. chips - tasted great.

These brownies tasted great and were simple to make. I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate on hand so I used 6 tablespoons of Hershey cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons of shortening. It worked out great. I melted the butter and chocolate in the microwave and then mixed the powder and shortening in it.

This was my first attempt at making brownies from scratch and I couldn't believe how easy it was. The brownies were rich and absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone.

Fantastic. I used a little more semi-sweet chocolate chips, and a little more flour. This is an easy and kick-booty recipe. I made sure to keep this recipe forever. Love this web-site as much as this recipe.

A great recipe (in fact, I'm waiting on my third batch to come out the oven!) I love how fast they are to put together. Every time, the brownies have been moist and chewy. Have substituted pecans for walnuts...works great! Have to agree with some of the previous reviews: the original recipe is a tad too sweet for my palate. Have been using just over a cup wih pleasing results

Excellent brownies and so simple why bother with a mix! I've made these twice this week and they keep disappearing. To make things easier microwave the chocolate & butter for about 1 minute.

A great brownie! However, like other reviewers, there isn't enough "chocolate" in it. I would add additional chocolate chips to give it that extra amount a brownie needs. I also added chopped hazelnuts.

Great recipe- loved the crunchyness on the outside and soft fudgy inside. I added a dash of cinnamon. also i didn't have unsweetened chocolate so i used 2oz. of semisweet and reduced the sugar by a bit- it was great.

I agree with Spendia from Kalamazoo. THE BEST recipe for brownies. Moist inside, slightly chewy on edge. My only caution: bake a little under time stated and keep checking for doneness. I used a darker pan and they were done before the minimum time. Yummy!

I have been searching for 32 years (my entire married life!) for a brownie like this! This brownie recipe has a rich, chocolat-y taste and it's very moist. Moreover, they stay moist for several days when stored in an air-tight container. They're so good you probably won't have many to store, though!

I'd have to say, I wasn't in love with the recipe. I agree with an earlier reviewer, it's not as chocolate-y as I would have liked.

Hardly more work than opening a package with a mix, and so much better! I didn't use the bitter chocolate, instead I just used more semisweet chips. I will never buy a brownie mix again.

i don't know who andrew is, but he can make an incredible brownie. i substituted milk chocolate chips (ghiradelli) for the semi-sweet variant as i am partial to milk chocolate. they were superb! they are perfectly fudgy and not too sweet (i probably used slightly less than the recommeded sugar quantity). what else can andrew make?
