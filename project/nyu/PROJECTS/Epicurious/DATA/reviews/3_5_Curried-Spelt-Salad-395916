I loved this recipe and it was a huge hit. I was lucky enough to have Anson Mills "Farro Verde" provided by a chef friend. It has a smokey flavor which added even more to the delight of this recipe. I used hot curry powder and a whole organic meyer lemon and thought the balance was perfect. I served the shredded chicken on the side as an option for those who wanted it.

This is a really interesting and different salad. I love grain salads and think they are perfect brown bag lunches! Didn't have mustard seeds so I left them out. It is lemony, but in a good way, I thought.Don't eliminate the lemon, perhaps cut back a bit if you don't love it. One thing I will say is that it is a tad dry, but I tossed in some diced avocado for moisture and richness when I had it for lunch. An extra douse of Olive Oil would prob do the trick too! Also, I was thinking raisins might be yummy in this, too, and add a pop of sweetness which would compliment it.

I adored this salad! I love the texture and flavor of farro. And the lemon peel adds such a wonderful freshness. I used a mandolin to slice the rounds very thinly and then chopped them up. The result was no pithy taste, just wonderful flavor. I agree with those who could have added more curry.

I was very disappointed with this recipe, the mustard and cardamom tastes were way too strong. If I ever make it again, I'll omit these spices and stick to a similar recipe which only asks for oil, vinegar and curry powder in the vinaigrette.

This was a fabulous dish. I used around 2 tablespoons of curry powder to improve the spice and only used the zest and juice of the lemon rather than including the pith and it was just about right. The only downside was it was a little dry but this is because I omitted most of the oil to keep it low fat, using just a tablespoon of extra virgin to heat the spices. Next time I might serve it with a little yoghurt to fix this.

I did not care for this dish at all! It needs more vinaigrette. A yogurt based sauce could vastly improve it. The lemon pieces are very palatable either. The onions, are on the other hand, well flavored with the cider vinegar.

Amazing! Followed the instruction exactly, except I used wheat berries because I keep them in my pantry. I will try it with the spelt if I come across it. I will definitely remake...

I made this recipe with pearled faro and thought it was great. The lemon does add a brightness to the dish- I wouldn't change a thing.

I didn't know what spelt (farro) tasted like and so I ignored all recipes. I was served a saffron- flavored spelt for lunch on a flight back on Air France in coach and I was delighted at the flavor of the grain. When I saw this recipe, I began searching for the farro. I found some semi-pearled at a local health food store, and I made it this weekend. It is wonderful! I would add more curry next time -- perhaps a little more than a tablespoon total. I saw the comments about the intensity of the lemon. I used an organic lemon, cut it in half lengthwise, cut off the ends and some of the chunky-white pith, and pureed it all in the food processor before I added it to the carrot mixture. It was perfect and added just the amount of brightness that it needed. It is only my husband and I at home, but this won't last long and I need to go back and load up on farro.

My boss made this and brought it in to share for lunch. I LOVED it! Bright, light, flavorful and yet hearty. I'm a fan of the lemon, but I see other's find it a bit strong. I'm making it for my family this weekend and can't wait to see their reaction. I better double it!

LOVED it. I thought the lemon was really strong until I tossed it with lots of cilantro and arugula, and then it made perfect sense to my palate.

I loved this salad. The lemon was a bit too much for me as well, I'd maybe use half of the called for amount.

Wow, this is seriously flavorful. I like it, but I agree that the lemon peel is a little overpowering.

I made the recipe using whole wheatberries. It was good, but not as good as I hoped or expected. I felt like maybe the lemon was just overkill on mine. The citrus seemed to dominate everything else. The texture was great. I love arugula, so that really helped with the taste.

Just made this up to the "make-ahead" finishing point and can hardly wait to add the arugula and cilantro and eat some more of it. The flavors are very intense-this may be because I ground my own coriander seeds and used the seeds from about 6 green cardamom pods (a bit too much, I will use half as much or the ground next time) -and just explode on the palate. I used the hot Madras curry powder which gave it the right amount of heat for me. I suggest saving the water you drain off the spelt to add while sauteing the carrots/spices-it keeps the spices from burning. This is the first time I have used whole spelt in a recipe-fabulous! In my opinion, this is the only one of the grain recipes from this month's Bon Appetit that is truly deserving of the four fork rating.

Fantastic! Couldn't find any arugula (weirdly) so used Dandelion instead, and it was just fabulous.

Huge Memorial Day hit - yum.
