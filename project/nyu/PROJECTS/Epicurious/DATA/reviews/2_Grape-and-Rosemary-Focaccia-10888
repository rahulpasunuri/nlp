I have made this several times since recipe was printed. Always with good results. I was suprised to see negitive review. Maybe their yeast was old or they didn't let it rise properly. I have always followed recipe as writen with good results.

This recipe produced a nice hard brick of a focaccia, certainly not what I was expecting. After making it, I consulted reviewers' comments on several other Gourmet focaccia recipes and noted that many other's have complained of rock hard results, and most of those were from recipes that had even shorter baking times (the 1 hour did seem excessive when I read it). Apart from the problem with the texture, I was also disappointed with the fairly low amount of salt and oil, which gave the bread a fairly bland taste. Finally, I would not recommend using typical table grapes, but only make this recipe if you have some really sweet ones on hand.
