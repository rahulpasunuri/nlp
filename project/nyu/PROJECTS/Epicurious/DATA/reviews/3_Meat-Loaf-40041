My family loves this recipe. I've made it too many times to count, in a # of different kitchens and it is never done in 45 minutes @ 350F. An hour or a little more, is a more realistic cook time.

My biggest problem with meat loaf is that most of the time it turns out bland. Since this recipe came recommended by a friend I gave it a shot with a few minor variations. I added Hines Chilli Sauce and freshly chopped garlic for more flavor. The result - BLAND still. And the taste of bread crumbs is overwhelming. I would probably use 1/2 of what the recipe calls for.

My 1990 Fannie Farmer Cookbook includes 3/4 cup of milk versus the 1/4 cup here. Try with 3/4 to reduce dryness.

I made it with cheese -- and per another reviewer, added some ketchup. Also, I had to substitute shallots for the onions, but that was fine. Honestly, until now, meatloaf wasn't my best dish, but this one is delicious. Moist and flavorful. Even my finicky five-year old loves it.

Ok, simple recipe. For a more flavorful (and spicy) meatloaf with panko bread crumbs, check out Ming Tsai's website recipes (ming.com) from his show, for "Asian Meatloaf" which is amazing!

This is exactly the recipe my family has been making for 3 generations. A long standing family favorite.

An acceptable version of meatloaf, probably needs a little spicing up to add some zest to it.

I really like this very simple meat loaf. I usually make the individual muffin-style meat loaf and spoon tomato sauce over it...so good.

This dish was so easy to make! I had to cut it in half because I was the only one eating, but it turned out great, and it smelled so good while it was cooking! Very yummy! I would make this again.

The Fannie Farmer cookbook was the first cookbook that I ever received, a gift from my mother, who also learned to cook with Fannie. This was my first attempt at meatloaf, and I have to say that my husband & I loved it. Wonderful, classic meatloaf recipe. I poured a can of diced tomatoes over the top before baking...yummm....

My first ever meat-loaf was so easy and delicious. It was the solution for left over bread piled up in the kitchen but I would make it even if I don't have it!

I have NEVER been able to make a meatloaf that my family will eat. But with this recipe they are coming back for seconds. I made it several times and it always turns out just right.

I am an American living in London, England. Since the beef in the UK is not as tasty as that in the US, I used one pound of mince pork and one pound of mince beef. Delicious. I made this on a Friday evening. The next night we had a babysitter for our daughter, and I told the babysitter to please help herself to the food in the refrigerator. The next day when I bumped into the babysitter at my daugther's school, the woman confessed that she ate a "very big piece" of the meatloaf, and could she bother me for the recipe...the best meatloaf she had ever had! I agree. Very delicious dinner and an cold meatloaf sandwich is the best! Donna P.

This recipe was quick and easy, and delicious. I was sure something so simple couldn't taste so good! I ground my own meat, which made it taste even better. I was out of Worcheshire sauce, and substituted ketchup. This was just as good as the meat loaf my mom made when I was growing up. I plan to serve it to my husband and 2 young daughters (3 and 1) for dinner tonight. I'd definitely make it again. I'm going to serve it with baked potatoes and green beans.

Add Katchup and Cheese to the top after it's baked

Not a bad recipe for the cooking impaired. My girls really enjoyed it. Quick and simple.

Yummy! My picky nine year old daughter had seconds, and then asked for it as a bedtime snack :^) I'd been having trouble trying to replicate my mother's recipe since she never measured and gave directions over the phone. This recipe is as good as hers. I put ketchup on the top before baking (just like mom), but for some reason, the cooking time was not long enough. We had to leave it in another 30 minutes at 350 degrees.

I gave this four forks because it was better than Mom's AND my husband ate the leftovers. It is now the Sunday blue plate special and Monday's lunch. Fine with me. Check out Epicurious' mashed potato recipe to go with it.

I made this recipe tonight and while it was very flavorful it was a little dry ... any suggestions?

Rating: 4
This recipe is almost identical to the one my mom made growing up. Delicious and always served with potato (baked or mashed) and corn. We use dry bread crumbs (or dry stuffing) instead of the freshly-made bread crumbs. We also add some oregano. For a super-delicious gravy, spoon one can condensed mushroom soup over the top before baking. It keeps the meat moist and is wonderfully delicious. Leftovers make a great meatloaf sandwhich! Just put between two slices of bread with mayo and lettuce. Yum!

I live overseas now and the hardest thing is being so far away from my mother's Iowa farmhouse cookbooks. This recipe takes me back to Sunday meals growing up. I also added the tomato sauce and some grated Edam cheese across the top and baked it for an hour @ 180 Celsius.

I made this meatloaf and it was really good. I would make it again. My question is, is there a recipe for stuffed meatloaf, with mashed potatoes?

Being an Islander and not having meat loaf before, I thought it was too heavy with the fresh rye bread crumbs. My husband, who loves all american food, thought it was pretty good for a 1st try. Will try with store bough bread crumbs next time.

This recipe is my Mom's meatloaf. I made the recipe as stated except I put ketchup as a topping and extended the cooking time to 1 Hr. This is classic meatloaf, nothing fancy, but very good.

If you're looking for a meat loaf with zip- move on to another recipe. This is a basic, yet delicious meat loaf that I grew up eating and now make for my family. As previously mentioned, it is terrific cold the next day in sandwiches.

Rating: 3
Great basic recipe and wonderful for sandwiches the next day. I mixed the recipe items and then froze half, since half would still allow for leftovers. I did exchange a few items: (1) Soy Sauce & A1 for Worcestershire, (2) Dry Oatmeal for Bread Crumbs, & (3) Soy milk for milk. I always throw in whatever seems good at the time and use my hands to create a good consistency.

I thought this recipe was extremely dull, I made the original recipe. I don't know maybe the other reviewers tried one of the other versions suggested. I'll stick with my old recipe which is a take off of boston markets meatloaf. This one was way too dry and boring.

Meatloaf is the ultimate comfort food and this is a great recipe. I used bread crumbs made from homemade bread and drizzled the obligatory catsup on the top before baking it on my Weber grill. I didn't mention that it was a different recipe from the one I normally use and my hubby and 19 year old son raved over it! This is going to replace the oatmeal version I normally use.

I agree with The cook from MO. It does make great sandwiches the next day. I would recommend wearing latex gloves when mixing this because it makes clean up a snap!

It was the most wonderful meatloaf I have ever tasted, even though I changed some things because I was short on ingredients. I used the variation with grated mozzarella cheese and used onion salt instead of an onion. I am definitely going to make this one again!

I had misplaced this recipe and could only find the last page. It is the best meatloaf I've ever made.

I would rate this a 4 however I can not imagine anyone thinking meatloaf is "A dish beyond compare" other than my boyfriend. My friends and family love it. When time is short i dont bother toasting the bread, I just pop it in the food processer. I tend to add more bread and onions than called for and I also use the food precesser for the onions. I experiment with spices sometimes and add oregeno. If you havent already bought the fannie farmer cook book then do so. Try to get the old paper back edition and make the blueberry cobbler its the best one I have ever had.

We tried the version with bacon, but the dish had very little get up and go. We added some minced garlic and tomato sauce to it too. I've had better meatloaf.

This was great. My family hates meat loaf. I usually think of the ketchup-doused burger my mother made me eat. But this is fantastic. My 8 year old son is asking for it again. We used the 3 meat version, with more veal than any thing else. Very tasty and not dried out and mushy! Perfect!

A really wonderful recipe for those who love simple yet flavorful meatloaf. (We prefer to avoid ketchup/tomato sauced sweet versions of this classic.) Easy to make, and indeed better the next day for sandwiches.
