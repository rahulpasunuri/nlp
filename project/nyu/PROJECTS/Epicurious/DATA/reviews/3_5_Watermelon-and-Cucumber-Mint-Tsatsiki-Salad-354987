Loved the tsatsiki. Loved the watermelon with the mint and lime. The two together? No so much. Will eat both components in the future - just not together.

I am not a huge fan of watermelon, but this was really good! The lime and mint really made it.

I can't believe this has received anything but sparkling reviews! I loved this salad SO much that I made it twice in one week, for two different potlucks. Each time, I was told by the crowd that it was the best dish there. The tsatsiki is to die for - I had some extra leftover and ate in the next day with homemade pita chips; it's better than any store-bought version I've ever had. I agree that the salad gets very liquidy very quickly - both cucumbers and watermelon are composed mostly of water. So my solution is to cut them up right before serving, and to use a slotted spoon.

We skipped the tsatsiki and only made the watermelon cucumber mint salad. I cubed the watermelon in advance and then drained it before combining it with the other ingredients. Definitely serve with a slotted spoon. Very refreshing summer salad! I made a half recipe (which should have been 3 servings) but it seemed more like 5 servings.

This was good, but the cucumber I used was bitter which distracted from the salad. I also 'drained' the watermelon cubes. I served the tsatsiki on the side of the sald. I'm not sure it added much. I don't think I would make it again, since there's better watermelon salad available.

This was soooo good. A million times better than what it sounds like. I made it for a party and everyone raved about how good it was.

Please remove the "vegan" tag on this recipe as yogurt is a dairy product.

Light, refreshing and low calorie! I brought it to a bbq today and kept the yogurt on the side. It was a big hit with everyone.

Yum!!! This was so light and refreshing. I kept the yogurt separate as greek yogurt if over stirred turns to liquid but Yummy!! Cannot wait to make it again!

The Watermelon and Cucumbers together tossed with the mint was a good hit but no one liked the sauce not even me the yogurt was an aquired taste we just didnt have tho but to each their own other then that this was a simple dish and a nice touch to our meal. :D

I saw this in Gourmet when I was at the doctor's office, and asked the receptionist to copy the recipe for me. I figured it would be a nice first course for a meal with Moroccan Beef Stew. I doubled the recipe for a party and it was a big hit.

This salad is truly memorable; I have added it to my Tastebook recipes. My daughter and I tried it together from her Gourmet magazine, and it was a hit. We halved the recipe and 3 of us ate every bite. I am serving it again tonight to my husband.

this was great. the watermelon + mint + garlic in the tzatziki was totally addictive. i kept the tzatziki separate and used it as a dipping sauce.

The flavors were fantastic. I had trouble with the amount of water in the watermelon though. It created a bit of a soup. Maybe letting the watermelon drain prior to adding it to the salad? The flavors were so good that I'll probably experiment again.
