I loved everything in this recipe, and was so excited to make it, but the recipe disappointed for two reasons: (a) it's REALLY hard to find smoked haddock and (b) the gratin actually overpowered the veggies! Next time I will cut at least a third of the cream or substitute milk. And it definitely needs some spice.

This is a fabulously moreish take on a traditional comfort food. Like other reviewers, I questioned the tiny amount of smoked haddock called for and ended up doubling it. I can get naturally smoked, undyed haddock here and it was gorgeous with the celeriac and potatoes. I served it to friends who came round to view our five-week-old son, and it was a huge hit. Please don't be afraid to use your mandoline to slice the vegetables - it really improves the texture of the finished dish!

My husband and i made this last night for a group of epicurean friends, who devoured it. We too could not find the smoked haddock, but we substituted a smoked Alaskan Sable instead and it worked beautifully. Based on the feedback of others, we increased the cooking time by 15 min., so we were sure the potatos were cooked through. We paired this dish with a Chateau Musar White 1998 wine--hard to find--but THE perfect match!

I live in Vienna and couldn't find smoked haddock, so I bought a more delicate smoked trout that is quite easy to get here. Preparing it was a cinch and the dish was delicious, with just the right smokey touch. It really is important to thinly slice the potatoes, or you risk them being undercooked. We (very successfully) paired the gratin with a clean, spicy Chardonnay.

Yes,cook from Vancouver, as a Scot, finnan haddie was a regular for tea in our house. I did the dish last night,as a Main dish, for our gourmet club of 8 diners. There not a morsel left on the plates, including those who are reluctant to try the unknown, and even from one who confessed later she had never liked smoked haddock. I used just less than 2 (two)lbs of smoked haddock and it was not too strong in fact just delicious. I still think the 1/2 lb is an error - we all did. Not a dish to be assembled too soon before baking as some of the potatoes started to blacken. Served it with brown Soda bread & spinach and cranberry salad on the side and a Laroche 2001 Chardonnay. Yummy and not a drop spilt in the oven. Highly recommended by our whole group

To cook from Montreal: Have you ever had smoked haddock? Unlike some other smoked fish, haddock has a very strong/powerful taste, so a little goes a long way. Finnan Haddie is usually served as a side dish, rather than as a fish entree. I think a good comparison would be scalloped potatoes to which you add smoked salmon to elevate the dish out of the ordinary. Hope you find this helpful. Happy cooking!

My husband thought it was wonderful; I'm not as much of a fish fancier but liked it quite a bit. Next time I'll use a larger baking dish. It bubbled over and made a great mess.
