I made exactly as it and it is good, but too much Sherry wine vinegar. Other than it is good, and looks very professional! Would look great on a bed of greens, or with some kind of side salad.

Hmm, I was all set to love this after the other reviewer's comments but was left feeling as though it was mediocre. I would add less vinegar if I were to make it again.

This was good, but not great. The liquid for the mushrooms did not evaporate as stated, despite cooking them for about 20 minutes. I used red wine vinegar as some of the other reviewers suggested but found the taste too strong - if I make this recipe again, I will buy sherry vinegar. Also, I have no idea why they ask you to bake it for 50 minutes...mine was golden brown after literally 5 minutes at 375.

Outstanding! I also used red wine vinegar instead of the sherry vinegar. Will be making this again very soon.

I was disappointed in this recipe and was expecting great results after reading the reviews. But it turned out to have an average flavor and was quite messy.

This was a big hit! However, to end up with eight pieces make seven, not eight evenly spaced cuts...

It has become one of my signature appetizesrs when I am having a sit down dinner for a few guests or serving several cut into 2 inch pieces at a coctail party. Most of the time I make 4 or 5 at a time and keep them in the freezer unbaked sio if enexpected company stops in I can have one ready in less than an hour...

This was really good. My husband absolutely swooned over it. And, it was pretty easy to prepare! I used herbed Boursin cheese instead of goat cheese. Be careful not to over cook the syryp, mine hardened up solid when it hit the plate.

I made this for a small New Years Party and it was delicious. I would definately make this one again. I followed the recipe exactly. I liked the fact that I could assemble it and have it ready to cook in advance.

I made this strudels when friends came over to have a glass of wine one evening. As I served it on cocktail napkins I didn't make the syrup. Neverless I tasted delicious. Everyone loved it, they said it tastes unusual but very good. It is perfect as an appetizer or - as I made it - with some nice red wine.

I made this pretty much as written, except that I didn't have any fresh parsely so I used dried and I used red wine vinegar instead of the sherry vinegar. It came out amazing. I wasn't sure about the syrup, but it was really good. A definte keeper!!

I am Greek and a pro at using and cooking with filo dough, so this was a welcome change from the same-o-same-o (we get so tired of our own ethnic dishes.....). My guests raved about this one (perhaps they too are tired of my ethnic dishes...)and it presented beautifully. I might increase the amount of goat cheese next time. I also used Trader Joe's Balsamic Glaze instead of the recipe (I love the stuff... drizzle it on a lot of things, and only 2.99 a bottle....) Hey, with the ingredients in this recipe, how could you go wrong? A+

The strudels were very good and were gobbled up, especially delicious with the Balsamic Syrup which is over the top!!

Made this for a party...everyone loved it. I don't know what came over me but I decided to add the molasses and balsamic when I added the sherry to the mushroom mixture: this way there was no sauce and when sliced, the strudel was true finger food. A few less forks to wash.

This came out great. I made it without the goat cheese with a mixture of portobello, shitake and cremini mushrooms. It was my first encounter with Phyllo - a challenge, to say the least. But it came out fine. I didn't have molasses, so I used dark brown sugar for the balsamic reduction - yummy!! Served over a lightly dressed salad of baby greens, a big hit for some discerning dinner guests.

Yummy concept. I made a few modifications and it was FAB!!! First, Instead of shallots, I carmelized 2 large onions in olive oil and a tsp. sugar. I chopped this fine. Then sauteed with the garlic, button and kastana mushrooms. Then added a slash of red wine (no vinagar). Cooked it until all liquid was gone. S&P to taste. Using the oil on phyllo was easier than butter. I scored the phyllo before cooking (great tip from below). I served this warm on a salad of baby greens and a dressing of olive oil, lemon juice, finely chopped (slightly crushed) onion, sugar, s&p. (didnt use balsamic sauce) Rave reviews all around!!

good not great was the reaction most of my New Years Eve guests had (as well as myself). We had many appetizers and a full course meal. This was the least exciting of the lot. I think it's just missing something but I'm not sure what. I think I will play around with it to figure out why it tastes like it needs a little more. pine nuts? egg? spinach?

I made this for the Holidays last year and my 13 year old niece as ked me to make it again! the whole family loved it! I did not make the syrup so I will try that this time. I also made it a month before and froze it. I scored the tope before baking and brushed w/ water. and baked about 45 minutes. Fabulous

I have made this twice and it is excellent. The only recommendation that I have is to use 4 sheets of Phyllo instead of 3. It is nice as a main dish, served with a big green salad.

This delightful culinary creation was the perfect prefix to a New Year's celebratory dinner. The marriage of tart qualities contained within goat cheese combined with strong, sweet essences of the balsamic syrup was suprisingly complimentary. With it, I offered a relatively young, light, pinot noir...absolutely devine! One bit of prep advice; the incorporation of olive oil into this recipe requires it to be used very liberally. I'll most certainly be adding this one to my permanent reference file.

This appetizer takes a bit more work than some recipes, but it's very good. My husband and 12 year old son loved it. My sister thought it was a bit too vinegary, even in spite of the fact that I forgot to serve the basalmic sauce! I don't think the cooking time is right - it was done long before the time in the recipe. Maybe 20 minutes?
