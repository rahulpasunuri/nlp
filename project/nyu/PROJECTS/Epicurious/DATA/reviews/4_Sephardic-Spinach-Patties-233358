This is a great combo of flavours...like spanokapita without the phyllo! I do have a question, maybe someone can answer...when a recipe says 20 ounces, is that a weight or by volume? Being Canadian, ounces confuse me altogether! The mixture stuck to my hands a lot...not enough bread crumbs?

Made this for Rosh Hashanna dinner. Big hit! Even kids loved it. Definitely have to server it with lemon for adults, but kids loved them plain.

This was a huge hit with my family. I used all fresh spinach, less than recipe called for..bought Costco bag and did not destem it. I sauteed it with the onion and garlic. I cooked most of the water out and squeezed the rest out of the spinach before combining it with the egg, one cup of swiss cheese and about 3/4 cup panko bread crumbs. I made patties, cooked 3 minutes on each side and they were fantastic. This will be a new favorite in my house.

I am making this for the fourth or fifth year for our Seder upon request. It is a tasty and healthy dish and I will often bring it to other holiday celebrations or get togethers as well. I always get compliments. I never tried it with bread crumbs though.

it's good, but I will try it with nuts in it so it is a bit more interesting (pine nuts?)

Blah, just OK, would probably have been better with seasoned bread crumbs and grated parm, rather than bland/dry matza meal. Did use fresh spinach. Would keep the garlic on the lighter side or it overpowers. I made single batch for 6 people and half went into the freezer...when it's good there's never leftovers!

Wow! Who knew (besides everyone who reviewed it before me)? If you have the time, definitely use fresh spinach, removing the stems. It was so relaxing, but took me at least a half an hour, probably more. I used a mix of bread crumbs and whole wheat flour and it turned out so great. I'll certainly be making it for Passover with matzo meal.

Yum! Can be made gluten free by using gluten free flour mix instead of matza meal/bread crumbs. I left out the nutmeg. I served mine topped with smoked salmon and lowfat sour cream.

I used frozen chopped spinach, matza meal, included the garlic and nutmeg, and mixed it a day ahead with all ingredients except the eggs. The following night I mixed in the eggs and fried the patties. Easy weeknight meal. Enjoyed by whole family including a toddler.

We were using fresh spinach and had already chopped it when we realized the recipe said to "cook" the spinach. It was late at night and we wanted to get going with the frying, so we took a chance and skipped the cooking. We did spend a little time squeezing out the water from the uncooked, chopped spinach. The patties came out fine; in fact, they were a big hit at our Rosh Hashanah meal even though we overdid the reheating. My husband thought they could have more of a kick. We used the nutmeg this time. Maybe we'll add the cayenne next time. Has anyone used both?

I made these for a dinner party. I used the variation with ground pecans and grated fresh nutmeg. They were served lukewarm as an accompaniment to poached salmon. I love them but the guests were not impressed, so I have lots of leftovers. Heated in the microwave, these patties taste like sausage patties. I will be making them for myself when I have extra blanched spinach.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! The stemming definitely takes a long time but the result is worth it. We used a walnut/pecan mix and formed the mixture into latke sized patties. Next time we'll probably add in some chopped mushrooms, but overall this is a vegetarian dish that will satisfy everyone.

I agree with VeggieMo. I used 1/2 c. of ground walnuts & 1/2 c. of ground flax seed. I did add the cheese: 1/2 c of aged white cheddar with a good sprinkling of parmesan. Even though I thought I had gotten all of the liquid out of the spinach, my mixture was a little watery, so I sprinkled Bob's red mill gluten free all purpose baking mix on top & stirred until the moisture was gone. It fried up beautifully. Even my kids liked it & the eldest says he wants it for Christmas & his birthday. Definitely a keeper.

so i found this recipe while looking for what to do with the rest of my huge costco bag of spinach,(2.5lb bag) which is a lot spinach, so i was happy to do this as the spinach was heading south and i did not want to waste it. First of all, De-stemming 2 POUNDS of spinach takes forever,so this will not be a regular go to recipe, BUT they did turn out really nice, I was nervous from the mixed reviews, so might be a nice thing for when you can plan ahead and space out the de-stemming over a couple nights while watching TV or something

I make this recipe every Rosh Hashanna and Passover. I love it. My friends and family love it. Make this recipe! I am Sephardic and use this as the spinach dish in my Rosh Hashanna seder.

This is a very nice and straightforward recipe. I took care to destem the spinach and blanched it about two minutes then drained and let cool. I added both the nutmeg and the cayenne pepper. I used about 2/3 of the nutmeg called for and it was still a strong flavor. I'll use half next time. I used sauteed onion. Three minutes per side on medium heat is about right, for nice, crisp patties. Best when warm. 3 1/2 STARS.

As a vegetarian family with allergies, we eat eggs, but no dairy or gluten. I could not use crumbs because of that and I did not have walnuts, so I ground up some pecans. The end result was a fabulous meat substitute. The patties tasted just like meatballs. They also tasted like they had cheese and bread crumbs in them. It was unreal. My husband was shocked when I told him it was pecans and said he never would have guessed. This is great news for vegetarians who are gluten free, because most meat substitutes have gluten so they are out. I will be using this for many things. I expected it to be more spinachy, but I may not have used enough. I used two packages of fresh spinach, but they did not say how much they weighed. I also substituted half a leak for the onion. Anyway, it worked great for a meatball type texture. Yum!

I was a bit skeptical because I did not understand how such a simple patty could have such rave reviews. I thought the flavors were good, but the result was a bit mushy (could have been the preparers, but still). Generally good - I topped them with parmesan after pan-frying and they were yummy.

Outstanding spinach patties. I had to stop my children from eating them all as they were draining. I made them for Rosh Hashana and used the nutmeg, which I agree pushes them over the top tastewise. I did not shape them as described but scooped them into the pan with a small ice cream scooper. When I turned them, I flattened them out. AMAZINGLY GOOD for such basic ingredients.

A wonderful variation and a great way to enjoy spinach. I used this recipe as-is once and began customizing it in different ways each successive time. The most popular version now includes finely chopped mushrooms, pecans, bacon and finely grated parmesan cheese.

This is my new favorite way to eat spinach... I've made this several times now, and I must say the nutmeg is absolutely essential. This recipe also works very well with other substantial greens like beet, radish, turnip, kohlrabi and mustard greens and also swiss chard and kale. In some cases, you'll need to remove some stem/vein, but blanching will get them all ready to be used and if you have a variety of greens, the end product can be deliciously complex. This has been a godsend for the greens I get from the CSA that I'm not sure what to do with.

I didn't have nutmeg which I think would have made these much better but regardless, they were a huge hit with my husband. He said he could 72 of them, so I will be making them again! :) They're easy enough to include in everyday meals, not the prettiest things but they reheat well.

I made these as described, except I used garlic scapes instead of the optional minced garlic. It was OUTSTANDING! Even my boyfriend likes spinach this way. I made it with the fresh spinach and did not think it was that much of a hassle. Definitely perks up with the lemon on top. Will be making it again this week.

This was a HUGE hit for a Shabbos dinner I made for my goya boyfriend and his friends. It did require quite a bit more matzo meal, and I opted for more parmesan than 1/4 of a cup... but they came out so delicious! The one thing I'd change for next time is: smaller patties, so they're a little firmer on the inside.

these were tasty!! i added about a half a cup of finely chopped crimini mushrooms (and sauteed them with the onion) and 1/4 cup of parmesan. would highly recommend!

I just made these and they are DELISH!!had to add an extra 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs at least, used the garlic and nutmeg, and frozen spinach. Can't wait to try them with cheese. These are addictive.

definitely going to make these again. I added cheese - parmesan and a little provolone. Used panko and was so excited to eat them that I forgot the lemon. very good! I prefer them small and thin for the crust crunch. Might try the mini ball shape next time for company and will definitely use frozen spinach to save time. yum! try these

These were very tasty. After frying them, I thought they needed a bit more salt and lemon juice than the recipe called for, and after that they were perfect. However...if you are making them for fun (not kosher) and live in NYC, get a container of green sauce from Pio Pio (a Peruvian restaurant with a few locations in the city) and dip them in it. Amazing!

I used lots of cheddar and finely sliced ham and a little butter to achieve a golden crunch. It was an easy hit!

I just made these for a girls' retreat weekend (trying something healthier to offset our other excesses) and we all loved them. Definitely liked the garlic, cayenne and recommend the parmesan cheese addition. I used egg and onion matzos for some extra flavor. Next time I'd try frozen spinach since de- stemming fresh was time consuming.

Definitely dice rather than chop the onion; it makes keeping the shape easier. Use frozen spinach to save the hassle of trimming/de-stemming spinach. Add the cayenne and cheese of your choice (parmesan was great). Don't omit the garlic. Make them small meatballs as an hors d'ouerve or as is for a snack or meal. Very good!

On my first reading of the recipe I really didn't think it looked worth it but, because of the rave reviews I decided to make it and was definality NOT dissapointed. This will become a staple for weeknight dinners, with frozen spinach and a bit of fresh parm. Very good.

If you have any left over- which I doubt- these reheat beautifully in the oven wrapped in foil. I did this the next day, don't know the long term life once fried, but short term they're very good, and much easier than "simmering" to reheat.

I used frozen spinach, Italian-style bread crumbs, and I split the recipe, so used 10 ounces of spinach and only one egg. This was incredible. I added parmesean cheese. I could easily make these once a week! It was extremely easy too (with the frozen spinach).

I've been making spinach patties since I've been married--17 years. We eat them all year round. We have them with a side dish of egg noodles tossed with cottage cheese, butter and a little salt and pepper. With the noodles, it makes a filling meatless (dairy) meal.

These were fantastic! I had a lot of spinach and didn't know what to do with it. I had no idea was I was going to be making but these were divine. I served them as a light meal along with kefir, lemon and peppercorn dipping sauce. Really worked. I added way more cheese to mine and keep adding the breadcrumbs. I made this over several meals, the mixture keeps well for a day or so. Was delicious, but time consuming, next time I would make it the day before, I planned to eat it.

Oh man are these fantastic. I made them with fresh spinach and matzoh meal, and added the cheese option (Jarlsburg, just because it was easy to find). My guests proclaimed them "restaurant-grade." They are simply delicious. I will be making them again and again. Just terrific for vegetarian guests.
