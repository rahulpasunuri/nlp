Was well into this before realizing I had only a scant 1/8 c. of pure maple syrup, so ended up with more vanilla-y than maple-y custards. Still delicious though. Silken texture, and btw, I used 1 c. nonfat milk, and 3/4 c. heavy cream. Still turned out wonderfully, baked in small demitasse cups and served on the saucer with a dollop of cream and a ginger cookie. V. festive!

One of my friends is on a gluten free diet, so i modified the recipe. I switched the maple syrup for honey, added 1/2 tsp of each (cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and fresh nutmeg), and then divided among 4 cups instead of 6. After 30 mins i took them out and put some thin apple slices on top and sprinkled with light brown sugar and a little honey and then put them back in the oven for another 30 mins. Everyone loved it, though I don't know how it tasted because i wasn't able to get a taste of it. I take this to mean that it tasted good.

Made EXACTLY as written and it was excellent. The only problem we had is in the cups - I don't have the deep custard cups shown in the picture, and this needed some adjustments in cooking time because of our flatter cups -they took much less time to cook, so the bottoms were a little over-done. (That's the bubbled texture the cook from Indianapolis complained about.) Trader Joe sells excellent Grade-B syrup for cheap, so don't use anything else. You'll be amazed.

What is the matter with people like Indiana?! I am sick of people not following a recipe, changing the ingredients, and then, gosh it's not very tasty. Well Indiana, you're not very bright.

How can you review a recipe Indiana if you screw up the most important ingredients? You can't cheat on the cream or maple. Make it correctly and then review it. You will find it to be delicious and beyond all expectations

Before I comment I have to say I used half and half instead of the heavy cream/whole milk combo, and I also only used store bought maple syrup for pancakes, but I couldn't stand how the texture turned out. It was bubbled and wierd. I felt like the flavor was quite good, however, my husband told me he didn't like the flavor, and didn't mind the texture at all. But overall we were dissapointed.

These were positively amazing. I didn't want to spring for real maple syrup, so I jsut used normal table syrup. That was so tasty, maybe I will spare the expense for the real stuff the next time.
