Yummeh! This is a super-easy recipe and delicious. I didn't add salt and pepper and it was fine. I turned off the oven and left the eggplants in there for several hours as I prepared everything else for a party, and by the time I got the eggplant out it was super-soft and easy to remove the flesh. I think it's really important to do the draining because I have a friend who makes really watery hummus and baba-ghanouj, and I don't like it (nor apparently do my mother or brothers...).

An excellent way to incorporate a more roasted garlic flavour as well as the smokey flavour is to cut incisions in the abrugine and insert garlic cloves, then broil under high flame until skin is crispy. I agree that there's a bit much tahini in this one. Greek-style yogurt can be added for a Turkish version of this meze. I prefer it with more spices, but it's delicious either way.

Based on other reviews suggesting a lack of authentic smokiness and having made this recpe once before as stated I made the recipe again with these modifications and it was to die for. It might not be authentic but it is a very tasty rendition. This was awsome made like this: Baked 2 med. sized eggplants about an hour at 350. When cool scooped out pulp, squeezed a little to drain before scooping, put in vita mix. Added salt, about 2 scant tablespoons (1.5 maybe) tahini, 2.5 cloves of garlic (will try just 2 next time as the garlic flavor is extremely pronounced), a couple splashes (maybe 2 tbsp) lemon juice - bottled, a shake and a half of cumin, two bottle tips of olive oil (no more than 2-3 tbsp), a shake of smoke flavoring. Turn on vitamix and blend, doesn't take long. Add 1/3 - 1/2 can of black olives and pulse vitamix to chop into mixture - do not puree. Absolutely delicious.

I thought this recipe was quite good; I sort of combined the technique of the other baba ghanouj recipe found on here with this one, in that I broiled the eggplant until the skin crisped off. After that, I followed this ingredients precisely. I had a good black tahini to use, so I had a great strong flavor. It came together very quickly, and I was very satisfied with the result.

This is a great basic baba ghanouj recipe but its missing one essential element: smokiness. Some folks grill the eggplant which works well. But the easiest way to impart a smoky flavor, if you have a gas stove, is to simply char it over a high flame until it burns all over. Once you get a good smoke off the eggplant all around, cut it in half and roast it for 30 mins instead of 45. With this added step you'll have an authentic smoky baba ghanouj.

Too much tahini for my taste--it was little pasty. Otherwise it was simple and good.

This recipe is a good starting point and it stands up well to alterations to suit your taste. Here is what we did: (1) roasted eggplants flesh-side-up, this added some color to the finished product, but also dried it enough that we did not need to drain; (2) cut down on the tahini by about 1/2; (3) added salt. We thought it was fun to play with this a bit until it tasted perfect!

I liked the simplicity of this recipe, it's one that I feel should not be cluttered with a lot of ingredients that take away from the main flavors to be experienced. However, there is far, far too much tahini in this recipe. I made this last night (halved it, actually) with the only alteration being 3 cloves of roasted garlic, and just about gagged on the amount of tahini in the finished product. And I rather like tahini--in moderation. The eggplant was completely lost, I could have been eating anything warm and processed under all of that tahini flavor, even the garlic was lost. This is nothing like the wonderful dish that I've been enjoying in great little Greek eateries. It needs salt, Greek olives, and maybe a tsp/tsp and a half of tahini for one eggplant.

Rating: 3
This is a decent recipe to use as a starting point. I followed some other readers suggestions and omitted the extra olive oil (only used some on the baking sheet so the egglants didn't stickand increased the amount of garlic (used 2-3 cloves). I added a generous pinch of salt because I felt it was too bland without it.

Fantastic recipe, I make it all the time when I can find good eggplant. I bake at 400 for the same time, pulp side up (lightly oiled), don't worry about draining, and throw them in the food processor with the skins-- much better flavor. I use a bit more olive oil. Not a criticism of this recipe, but "one clove" is vague, though it seems to be 1 tsp (http://www.foodsubs.com/Garlic.html), so I'm using 2-3 by this measure, and it never seems too garlicky, even two or three days after making it.

Really good recipe! I also BBQ'd my eggplant, but I cut it into thick slices and brushed them with olive oil. Also, because I only had one small eggplant, I also threw in some BBQ'd zucchini. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly, and am now eating it along with the rest of the BBQ'd zucchini - delicious!

I grilled my larger eggplant on a stove top grill first and then finished it off in the oven. I used more garlic, because well, I like garlic. And I thought it tasted fabulous with the extra garlic. Of course this recipe is very basic and it is a to your taste kind of recipe. And I always add kosher salt and pepper to my dips, because it just adds more flavor. All in all very easy! The only thing that was time consuming was the cooking and cooling of the eggplant. Was so easy to get smooth in the blender!

Light, silky and straight forward. I added a couple of pinches of sea salt and declared it perfect!

Well, with all the modifications maybe someone should put up another recipe. I didn't know who to follow. In the end, I roasted the eggplant whole, skipped the olive oil and used yogurt instead, added about 6 roasted garlic cloves and was pretty generous with the lemon juice. I didn't use the skin of the eggplant or season with pepper. I thought it was delicious, light and fluffy, different though from anything I've previously had, but who cares.

I'm not entering a rateing because I didn't make the receipe as stated. I took advise and used skin on the eggplant when I processed (that was fine) and roasted garlic (that was too bland for our tastes)and no oil (put it on top when serving). It was okay (2 out of 4 forks) when prepared that way. I'll try it again as stated rather than the substiutions and see if it's the kind of garlicky flavor I was hoping for.

I think the skins have to be included in order for the flavor to truly come out. I have now tried it both ways, and think grilling the eggplant and using the skin is the most flavorful. I also used roasted garlic for a different flavor and it was delicious.

I charred the eggplant halves on the stove before roasting them in the oven. I didn't have time to make the baba ganoush, so i put it in a sealed container in the fridge. I made it up the next day, but added a can of rinsed chickpeas/garbanzo beans, 2 extra cloves of garlic, and a dash of extra lemon juice to the original recipe, as it was definitely too bitter on it's own! It came out quite nice, although more of a baba hummus!

Rating: 3
so after reading all the reviews i was split three ways about the roasting. luckily i had 3 little eggplants so i sliced one lenghtwise, peeled and spiced one, and left one whole. Peeled and whole ones worked best (that way you have some good skin) but the whole also requires draining (icky). And if you dont punkture it, it will burst. To ensure that it wouldn't be bitter, I properly tasted each eggplant and the skin after it was roasted. Cumin works, and about 3 roasted cloves of garlic per pound of eggplant. NO CHILES!!, and used a balsamic vinaigrette for roasting. Tahini is not necessary but fine, and lemon is always good.

Following other readers advice, I roasted an entire bulb (small) of garlic, left the skin on, and did not add any oil. However, there was a significant amount of oil still on the eggplants from the roasting. The garlic and eggplant roasted together in the oven, for a little over an hour to ensure they were soft. I pureed while still warm, and served. It is irresistable warm. Can't wait to try it tomorrow after the flavors have more time to meld

This recipe is just okay, but for the best baba ghanouj, you must charcoal grill the eggplants til soft and then process both the skin and pulp. Also, at least double the garlic. I've also added a bit of choped mint, and used less olive oil in the processor, but drizzled some on at serving. The charcoal grill and charred skins are a must for that amazing smoky flavor that's essential to a perfect baba ganouj. Don't worry, the skins are not chewy at all.

Rating: 3
Nice, but the texture wasn't as smooth as I would have liked. Perhaps I didn't process it enough...

I grew up on baba ghanouj because my family is middle eastern. This is a good basic recipe, I think. But I don't add olive oil at all (just on top to drizzle). I also use WAY more garlic (triple) and lemon juice and less tahini. I usually just keep tasting and adding until it tastes right. But to me the lemon juice is really the key.

Rating: 2
I made this for a party and the guests enjoyed it. However, I feel it was a LOT of work. I am not a baba ghanouj afficianado but I wanted to have lots of vegetarian options for my guests. I thought it was bland and I will just get a store-bought version next time.

I too found this recipe too oily. I wouldn't add any olive oil at all--just cook the eggplant for 45-50 mins @ 450. I also would add cumin and hot peppers for taste.

Rating: 2
I agree with the previous reviewer. raw garlic is too intense and does not blend well with the smokey taste of the eggplant. Cumin highlights this smokey taste and lemon juice brightens everything perfectly. Red pepper adds a bit of spice that makes you want to come back for more!

Rating: 3
More tahini, less olive oil. DEFINITELY roast the garlic to be used along with the eggplant. Otherwise, the raw garlic is very sharp. I like this with a lot of lemon juice and some red pepper flakes. Also, 1/2 tsp. of cumin. I'm Irish-American, so I don't have to worry about authenticity, just taste.

Rating: 2
Baba ghanouj doesn't need a lot of olive oil. A quicker way to prepare the eggplant is to keep it whole, pierce it, and place under broiler to char all sides. Then place in paper bag for 5 minutes to make removal of skin easier. I recommend no olive oil except to drizzle over finished dish. Change the ingredients to the juice of 2 lemons, 3 roasted garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp. ground cumin, 1/3 cup tahina, a dash of cayenne and salt to taste. Once processed, place in shallow bowl, drizzle olive oil on top and add a splash of paprika.

Rating: 2
This was pretty good as written, but upon doing some research, I saw that a lot of recipes call for the garlic to be roasted, which I would try for next time. I also think the roasting time should be increased, because the eggplant was not quite soft enough even after baking for 10 minutes more, and when I pureed it, it didn't have the smooth texture I like. The taste was good though, and I will definitely try this again with these changes.

Rating: 3
I agree - less olive oil and more garlic. Delicious! I halved recipe since I only had one eggplant but next time I will definitely make the full amount - since I wanted to eat the halved amount all up immediately. This recipe is almost identical to one in Barbara Kafka's "Food For Friends" cookbook. I am wondering what this would taste like with roasted garlic mixed in. Has anyone tried this?

we just made this with left over BBQ'd eggplant (skins and all) and roasted garlic. We followed some of the other reviewers advice and used less olive oil and a bit more tahini and lemon. It came out really tasty! I said i wouldn't make the recipe again because now I think it only tastes good with the BBQ and roasted garlic, which I wouldn't go through the trouble to do just for this recipe.

Very Good!I also added garlic(maybe 3x more!!!)It did seem to be a bit too creamy(I might have processed it too much)After reading the previous reviews I will omit adding olive oil (could have added to the too "creamy" texture) Very close to authentic Lebanese Baba Ghanouj.

This is a very good recipe for baba ghanoug but as a traditional middle eastern I would advice u for the best texture and flavor first to mash the eggplants after roasting whole with a fork.And to add more lemon, and surprisingly refreshing and tangy plain yogurt no more than a 1/4 cup and a bit more garlic(1 more clove).Leave over night in the fridge then enjoy with drizzled olive oil on top.

OK, I live in Richmond and I've never been to Stellas, but I know how to make a kickin' baba. Forget the olive oil, except perhaps a little drizzled on top at the end. Use 1 eggplant bake at 350 for 30 mins. Forget the draining bit. Use 1/4 lemon juice, more garlic, and a dash of cayenne. Blend it all in a processor, and serve with Snyders of Hanover garbanzo bean and garlic tortilla chips. This is a favorite in my house, you can't go wrong.

just to chime in on traditional baba ghanouj (i learned it from my lebanese grandmother). Bake eggplant whole (in oven or smoke over a bbq). Puncture so it doesn't explode. Cook until totally soft, then peel and scrape eggplant into a bowl. Pound garlic with salt and olive oil and lemon to make a paste. Pound eggplant with mortar and pestle, mix in garlic paste and tahini to taste, until texture is right. Alternately, use a bl ender. food processor won't get as good of a texture.

Cooking the eggplant over an open fire will bring out the best flavor. If you have a gas stove that would work but watch out for the mess. Roasting it, is the next best way to do it and you don't need to oil it. Cutting it will dry it, so just keep it whole and make about 3 or 4 slits in it so that it doesn't explode. Please do not microwave your eggplant. Olive oil is a big No No...Season with salt, lemon and garlic to taste. When ready to serve, drizzle about a tablespoon or less of olive oil and decorate with mint leaves, paprika and a few olives. We also use pomegranate to decorate with but it isn't necessary. You're ready to enjoy a great dip...

I have not made this recipe. But just by looking at it I can tell it is not quite right. As the others have said, oil is not really needed during cooking and add MORE GARLIC. I split my eggplant in half, brush it with a little olive oil, sprinkle with salt, then grill it on the BBQ, low heat for a while. The eggplant will turn black and pick up a great smokey taste. The little black bits look nice in the end product, too.

I didn't rate the recipe as I haven't made it - at least not directly from this recipe. I learned to make Baba Ganouj from an Isreali friend of mine. She taught me to roast the eggplant whole (she actually did it in the microwave! but I like the smokier taste you get when you do it in the oven) but she did add some olive oil to the mix. Like another reviewer, I prefer roasted garlic and a lot more of it, and my friend always added flat leaf parsley. We never really had a recipe, we just put the stuff in the processor til it looked right.

Rating: 3
I used olive oil on the bake sheet and also rubbed olive oil into the cut sides of the eggplant prior to baking. After making the ghanouj as indicated in the recipe, I decided that 1) it was a bit too lemony and needed more garlic and 2) it definately needed the salt, which I often omit or cut back in recipes. I added lots of roasted garlic and the final taste was great. The entire family liked it--even the kids. Next time I will not use fresh chopped garlic, only roasted. PS, by day two the garlic is getting strong so everyone needs to eat it to avoid offending anyone.

Taste wonderful! I just made it and changed the recipe to bake the eggplant face down in olive oil spray with shaved garlic cloves on the bottom.

As a cook who lived in downtown Brooklyn for many years, I learned a different recipe from a Lebanese cook I worked with who peeled the eggplant,(the smaller the better} rubbed them in olive oil, garlic, salt and a dash of cumin, and grilled them whole over a low flame, turning often until softened and brown-black, letting them steam in a covered bowl before following the recipe as written above (he used more garlic) It lends a wonderful smoky flavor to this dish..

I love middleeastern cuisine. Not only is it delicious but healthy as well. I smooth the baba ghanoush in a circle on a plate, pour a light drizzling of olive oil over the top and serve it with lemon wedges and garnish with fresh parsley with fresh middleeastern pita bread. This recipe sounds labor intensive but when it's done it's absolutely to die for. I highly recommend it!

THIS IS A GOOD RECIPE HOWEVER WE NEVER ADD OIL TO THE MIXTURE.
