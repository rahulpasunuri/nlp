I increased the quantities of sage and cheese, and served this to guests. It was sooo good that everyone raved about it, and everyone ate second helpings! I love Kabocha squash, which is more savory (less sweet) so will try it in this recipe next time.

This is a simple recipe and the tastes are as simple, but fresh and delicious nonetheless. Like other reviewers, I made a few tweaks to the recipe--I cooked the pasta and the squash in chicken stock and added garlic to the squash/onion mixture. I also had to sub dried parsley and sage. What made it a bit better for me was adding crispy strips of proscuitto on top. I would make again, perhaps with a little cheddar mixed in per another reviewer. Don't expect this to blow your socks off in complexity of flavors, but certainly a warming fall meal.

This is a great vegetarian recipe, but it needs more depth of flavor. We tried toasting 4T of chopped walnuts and sprinkling a few over each serving. What a difference!

I peeled and roasted the squash with pepper, garlic, onion, and cinnamon at 400 for about an hour. Let cool, cuisinarted, warmed up with a can of plain tomato soup and poured over penne. Delish. Added some parmesan.

This recipe was bland at best. It felt like it was missing something.

PS -- the fresh sage flavor was a little lost in this. Will use more next time.

This was delicious, so I'd therefore recommend it. But...I did make a couple changes based on other peoples' reviews. Used an ENTIRE can of chicken broth and cooked the squash longer than the recipe suggested. The salt & cheese really spice up (so to speak) the butternut squash. I love butternut squash, but in itself, it's a little bland, so you really need to make the most of whatever seasoning you have.

LOVED IT! This came out perfectly. I added quartered Baby Bella mushrooms, chopped Roma tomatoes, and sauteed bacon to the final version we made. Make sure to add plenty of freshly ground black pepper -- it really does make the dish. Ate this the next day for lunch at work and it heated up nicely in the microwave. I love the idea of butternut squash as a pasta sauce of-sorts, and will definitely make this again.

I made a variation of this recipe from my daughter-in-law. She roasted the cubed squash with evoo,sprinkled with a little brown sugar and a tablespoon of butter. I also used more sage,1 clove of garlic and added baby spinach. I used only 1/2 lb of pasta. Deelish!

A good recipe to bring out the rich flavor of butternut squash. I used sharp white cheddar instead of parmesean and added sauteed baby bellas. I also left out the butter and instead added halved plum tomatoes at the end for a little change. Very tasty.

I made this for dinner last night, and it was quite yummy! I followed other reviewers' advice and used broth (Veg chicken broth) instead of the water, and like others said there was way WAY too much pasta called for in the recipe. I cooked about 3/4 pound of penne and it was still way too much (like others suggested I added a bit at a time to the sauce). I used half of a 2 pound squash and in hindsight should have used the whole thing. I chopped up the squash but made it a bit more chunky, I added 2 cloves garlic and used probably 2 Tbs fresh sage. All in all this was an easy, hardy dish and I'm going to eat the leftovers for lunch right now! P.S. I think adding some breadcrumbs at the end would be especially delicious!

This is a great way to incorporate squash into a dinner, without making squash soup or roasted squash, both of which I have eaten 17,000 times this fall. The changes: I added a tablespoon of fresh rosemary, used dried sage, and dried parsley. Used egg noodles since i had them on hand, but would recommend wheat pasta. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added bacon when cooking the onion, draining off most of the fat before adding the squash. When I added it to the pasta, it became a smooth, mushy, pasta-y creamy kind of dish. Next time I make this, if I even need to add bacon, I'll cook it separately and sprinkle on top for a nice contrasting crunch. Yum!

Last comment: I also added red kale instead of bacon or pancetta (which is what I really wanted to use) as a hearty alternative. I think a slightly bitter green would have been better... maybe broccoli rabe?

I agree about the pasta. I added the pasta 1 handful at a time to make sure there was enough sauce and had a lot left over.

This recipe was a great starting point. I tried it with a couple of twists. I mixed in 1 tbsp of allspice, 1 tbsp pumpkin butter, along with 1/4 cup of raw milk cheddar. I was out of fresh herbs so I substituted 1 tbsp dry basil and 1 tbsp dry parsley and 1 bouillon cube. I finished it off with 1/4 cup parmesan instead of 1 whole cup.

I re-created this recipe using Jack-be-little pumpkins instead of butternut squash, mixed green onion with half of a yellow onion, and substituted rosemary for the sage. It was excellent. I think the use of the rosemary was especially good given the milder flavor of the pumpkin compared to butternut squash.

I made this for dinner tonight. My husband loved it. Next time I make it I'll do it with less pasta (though I used the amounts indicated in the receipe, there was too much pasta and too little sauce for us) and half or two-thirds the cheese called for. And I may add a bit more sage. Nonetheless, very hearty and tasty main course, one dish meal.

I chop the squash into 1/2" cubes and mash half of them up to form the "sauce" and have the rest stay in chunks. I used sprouted wheat papardelle which was excellent - the contrast of the sourdough-flavored pasta with the very sweet sauce was surprisingly delicious. You definitely don't need as much cheese or butter for this dish to be good - use chicken broth for the water, nice fresh squash, and plenty of fresh herbs. Yum.

This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe. The first time I didn't overcook the squash, so it had chunks of squash throughout. This time the squash turned into more of a paste throughout, but it was still very tasty. I followed other reviewers' advice and doubled the parsley and sage, and used broth instead of water. I added precooked bacon to the onions & squash as they cooked, which gave a stronger savory flavor to the dish. It was a big hit, (not bland at all!) and I will definitely make it again!

This is one of my husband's favorite recipes. I made it last week for a potluck and several people asked for the recipe. I usually cook the pasta in veggie boullion broth and this last time I used Delicata squash instead of butternut.

like other reviewers have commented, this is a great recipe but needs some extra flavor and crunch. i roasted the chopped squash, i doubled the sage and crisped half of it in 3T. browned butter and added that later, and added toasted walnuts. it was sooo savory and comforting. next time i'll try swapping out the water for chix stock as well.

I make this every fall and as I have one small child we have leftovers. I too make with chicken broth instead of water and add garlic. I don't add the pasta water (I like it thick). It is wonderful over ravioli and I have even used it as a pizza sauce with wild mushrooms.

This is pretty good and definitely simple. A few changes I made...I used beef broth and added a shallot when cooking the onion. I also crisped up about 3 tablespoons of chopped sage in 4 tablespoons of butter and added that to the pasta and squash mixture at the end. I omitted the parsley. I used fresh linguine as well...this recipe is a keeper!

Have made this several times since it first appeared in Gourmet: with and without butter, once with pancetta as suggested in the intro. We always love it, and wonder why we don't have it more often. Leftovers are good too.

This dish was good, not amazing, but required some tweaking. Use chicken broth instead of water, and double the sage and parsley. Also the addition of bacon and toasted walnuts really helps to bring more flavor to the dish. I roasted the butternut squash in the oven until almost soft, then added it in chunks, rather than finely chopped, so as not to have the "baby food" consistency problem previous reviewers mentioned. Also, I thought 1 lb of pasta was way too much - maybe that's why other people thought it was bland?

This is one of my favorite receipes -- with a few modifications. I omit the parmesean cheese, butter and parsley, entirely. I use a very small-shaped pasta, farfallini by de cecco. I don't add pasta water at the end and I cut the squash by hand. This dish is mild yet comforting -- pasta, onions, squash, sage, a good bit of salt and pepper...yum. I usually serve this with sausages or rosemary pork loin.

This came out like something to be served to children--a sweet macaroni and cheese. I won't make again.

Squash was pretty mealy, which may have been due to it not being completely ripe. I think roasting it beforehand would have helped. Any other ideas for making the sauce creamier in texture?

This is a delicious way to use up butternut squash that is too often made into soup! To make it even better, I added 2 heads roasted garlic, 1/2 cup non-fat sour cream and a dash of nutmeg. Yummy:)

It was very yummy. It is kind of a pain to prepare the squash, but well worth it. Sage and butternut squash/ pumpkin are a great combo.

Mmmmm! I made this to use up some leftover butternut squash, and it was truly delicious! I sauteed 1/4 c. of pancetta first, then cooked the onions in the same pan. Used chicken broth instead of water, and 1 tsp. dried sage, as the store was out of fresh. It was wonderfully moist without needing any of the reserved water, although I had used extra broth, since I thought I might have more squash than the recipe called for. I thought the pancetta was essential; it removed any possibility of this turning out "blah." We will definitely make this again - easy and fabulous.

This was my first effort at preparing butternut squash, and I'm completely turned off. I felt like I was eating Gerber's baby food over pasta. Yech. We ate two bites apiece and tossed it and ordered a pizza.

I thought it was a little bland as is. I too roasted the squash - just enough that it was soft but still would hold together to chop into small pieces instead of turning mushy. I also added chanterelles, which I sauteed with the onions, and then added both some halved cherry tomatoes, which I lightly cooked, and a small amount of cream at the end. Much more interesting this way!

Yum Yum Yum! This is good stuff - not bland at all. I also pre-roasted the squash and used chicken broth and a little more sage. Mixed it with radiatore and a 3-cheese blend (asiago, parmesan and romano). A wonderful combination of flavors comfort food with a touch of elegance....

I was just eating some of the leftovers and I have two things to say. The first is: YUM The second is: its not at all bland. Take a look at the ingredients......if you dont like butternut squash and sage, the two main ingredients, its not for you. Otherwise I'd say, "go for it".

This was devine!!! It's fast and easy to make. Be sure to save the water from the pasta as the squash and cheese mixture can be a bit thick.

Yum, altho my husband gave it 4 forks. Very gourmet-restaurant-y. Romano cheese worked well instead of Parm. I do, however, have to come up with an easier way for peeling that squash. Any ideas?

Yum! I thought this was great. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and roasted the squash - roasted it at 450 for about half an hour with basil oil and salt, and then added it in with the onion so it could get a little softer and get infused with flavors a little more. I'm vegetarian, so I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth - seemed to work well. I also added some thyme with the sage (and on everyone's advice used lots of sage) - this recipe can definitely stand a LOT of herbs. Very good, easy, mellow dish.

I first ate this dish at a friend's home for a dinner party. She served with cheese ravioli and it is very good as an alternative to penne. I think it gives it a little more character. I liked it so much that I made it a standard at my house.

Great recipe. Whenever I see comments like 'blah' I go heavy on the spicy ingredients. I doubled the sage which still didn't stand out. I added more onions, squash, used chicken broth as others suggested, and 'plenty of fresh ground black pepper' as the recipe states. The flavor was wonderful. I served it with a simple salad for an easy meal

I've made this a few times. Its light and healty. However, I roast the sqaush for 1 hour at 350 to give it more flavor and a nice "smokyness" I also use chicken broth instead of water - makes a big difference. Tonight I am going to try it with bacon.

We were limited in our ingredients in the house so this was a terrific meal to make. I subbed fresh spinach for the sage and used an acorn instead of butternut. Also, instead of water used chicken broth--this gave it a nice rich flavor. We served it with a great salad and warmed foccacia.

We thought this was very good. I couldn't find the fresh sage in freezer so I used the fresh basil in stead. Also used the water from the squash in place of cooking liquid from pasta.

Very good; it's a keeper. I shredded the squash so it cooked quickly in my electric wok--the shreds cling to the pasta nicely also. I increased the amount of sage and added some leftover diced ham. I sprinkled the parmesan on individual servings instead of adding it to the pot as I knew I'd have leftovers and thought it would reheat better that way. The next day I cooked more pasta and added some fresh asparagus cut in one inch pieces. I also increaed the ham and my husband liked the second day's dish better.
