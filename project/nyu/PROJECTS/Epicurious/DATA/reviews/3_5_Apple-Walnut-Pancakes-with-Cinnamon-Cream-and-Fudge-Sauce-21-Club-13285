ditto ditto. And please learn to spell, hon. Now-on to the recipe. When done right, this is a fantastic end to a fall meal. The catch is, it is very difficult to do right. The pancakes scorch VERY easily and the walnuts in the filling don't keep very well-they tend to accumulate a bitter taste after only a day in the fridge. So, end verdict: take extreme care and serve immediately, and you're good to go!

OH MY GOODNESS, THIS IS ONE TO EXPLAIN, SWEET, DELSIOUS, IT JUST HITS THE SPOT. I MADE IT FOR ME AND MY HUSBAND WHILE HE KIDS WERE AWAY ON VACATION, I GOT PAYIED BACK FOR THE TIME I SPENT IN THE KITCHEN AFTER MAKING THIS(WINK,WINK). I ALSO GAVE THM TO MY MOTHER ON HER 71-ST BIRTHDAY AND SHE COMPLIMENTED ME AND SAID SHE NEVER KNEW THE DAY WOULD COME WHEN SOMEONE TOPPED HER DESSERT RESIPES, AND SHE WAS GLAD IT WAS ME WHO DID. THESE ARE A MERICALE. COOK AND SERVE AND BE LOVED AND ENVIED!!!!!!!
