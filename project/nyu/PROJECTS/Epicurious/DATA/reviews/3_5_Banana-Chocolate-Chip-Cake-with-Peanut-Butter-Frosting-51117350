One of the best cakes i have made, although i must admit i liked the cake better than the frosting. This would be great as a sweet chocolate banana bread. Overall, it was a great cake, and so cute! Would defiantly make it again!

This cake had more of a bread texture than cake. I was pretty disappointed with so many rave reviews, I thought this would be a killer cake since I love bananas and peanut butter. I had never had peanut butter frosting and to my surprise, I didn't like it either.

I made this cake for New Years and everyone loved it! It was moist, delicious and just the right amount of sweet. For the most part, I followed the recipe and instructions except I used Greek yogurt in place of sour cream and used round cake pans. I did notice that after 30 minutes of baking, the edges were brown but the middle was still undercooked. I fixed this problem by reducing the oven temperature to 325, loosely wrapping the cakes in foil, and baking for another 10-15 minutes.

Seriously. This is one amazing freaking cake. It is so delicious and rich, but not to heavy at the same time. Super moist and just wow! The reviews below mention issues with cooking, the recipe does not call for round cake pans. It calls for square pans. I didn't have square pans, so I did 3 round pans to avoid overflow. The cooking time didn't match the recipe with this method, but it was a good work around for not having square pans. Overall, this cake was AUH-MAZE-ING! Definitely, get Jif Peanut Butter. We are normally an all natural peanut butter household, but the extra sugar that is in Jif makes the difference! Yum, yum! We will make this again and again!

First, we have some peanut allergies so I nixed the frosting and went with chocolate frosting instead -- to rave reviews! I also used 9-inch rounds instead of 8-inch squares. The cake was great, everyone loved it and asked for it again. I'll be happy to comply!

This cake is a sure winner. My husband said it's one of the best cakes I've ever made. Make sure to use very ripe bananas and full fat sour cream to ensure success. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Very good and very easy to make. Cake is excellent and would be good on its own or with a different type of frosting. Peanut butter frosting is very good but very rich and if you are not a peanut butter fan it is probably not for you! I would still make the cake, in that case though, and leave it plain or use a different type of frosting. Made it for one bday and one christening and everyone loved it.

The timing for this recipe is way off. I cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8 inch square pan for the suggested 35 minutes. When checked a toothpick came out clean but the center was still jiggling. I put it back in for an additional 10 minutes, it still did not look done so another 5 minutes, then another 3 minutes. I took it out to cool and the enter fell. When I cut it in half to make a a smaller layer cake the center was raw. Back in the oven for 20 minutes. My husband and son love peanut butter, chocolate and banana so it does get 2 forks but this definitely needs more time than stated in the recipe.

I made this recipe as written (no substitutions), but I used 9-inch round pans, and could have used 3 8-inch round pans and it would have worked with this much batter. I too had to increase the cooking time a bit, about 12 minutes longer. All that said, this cake was a HUGE hit in our house, moit and decadent, perfect levels of banana and chocolate chips. And I finally have found a peanut butter frosting that I would make again - absolutely delicious.

This cake offers the new baker opportunity to get acquainted with incorporating different elements. I can imagine useing this same basic recipe with other fruits and toppings.

I was excited to try this recipe after seeing it featured on the home page. With 3 1/2 forks and 90% of cooks saying they'd make it again, I didn't have any reservations... ...until I actually tried the recipe and ended up with a cake that was just shy of burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. When I finally gave up on it and set it on the stove to cool, the center collapsed. Concerned, I went to the reviews section to see where I or the recipe might have gone wrong. What I found instead was a reviews section filled with folks who had altered every aspect of the recipe, from basic ingredients to pan size and shape, and who had turned a recipe for a layer cake into banana bread. And then had given their new creation, which by now bore very little resemblance to the original recipe, a rating of 3 1/2 (or more) stars, thereby skewing the recipe's rating. Not that I'm bitter (ok, maybe a little). Anyway. Thanks, guys, for the lesson about the truthfulness of the ratings on this site.

GREAT RECIPE! I did not make the frosting and had them just as muffins, they were spectacular!

This was a good cake. I used light sour cream and reduced-fat peanut butter, and it still came out pretty rich. Also made half the recipe, which made enough batter for a very large one-layer cake (8 inch round pan) and four cupcakes. Like others who posted, I had to increase the cook time just a bit.

This was a hit with my family. I had to increase cooking time for the cake and reduced the icing by 1/2.

I could have sworn I would love this cake. Usually I can tell just by the recipe whether something will really flip the switch for me. I made this yesterday and undercooked it, so that's just a technical problem. The outside of the cake was done though so I went ahead a frosted it to see if I would like it. It is just too sweet and heavy for me! And I LOVE all 3 flavors (banana, peanut butter and chocolate). I'm kind of bummed but guess this one just isn't for me. Most everyone else likes it so this is just my own individual taste. Would not dissuade anyone from making it.

One day I wanted to make banana bread because the bananas were in that rare state of perfection. I had no cream or sour cream, but I did have some strawberry yogurt. I tried it and the banana bread came out amazingly moist and delicious. My youngest daughter came over later that day and I gave her a piece and didn't tell here what I did. She took several bites, and said. "Dad this is best banana bread I have ever eaten!" I next tried this with banana cake and like the bread the results were sublime. The strawberries in the yogurt complemented the banana and both the bread and the cake were moist. Most banana bread and cake are dreadfully dry. Try this recipe substituting an equal amount of strawberry yogurt for any other dairy product. You will be amazed.

I wanted more of a stand alone breakfast or snack cake. I reduced the white sugar to 1c. Substituted 1 cup of ground almonds for the one of the cups of flour. Used buttermilk instead of sour cream. Might try Greek yogurt next time. I added chopped walnuts. Baked it in a bundt pan. Also would reduce baking soda to 1.5tsp as I think I could taste it. I took about 50 minutes to bake. No frosting.

I made this the other day, but did not end up making the frosting--it seemed overly sweet and akin to gilding the lily. The cakes are delicious as they are--better than banana bread--what Cook's would call snack cake. Very moist, pretty easy. I used five bananas. I also found that it took about 50 minutes to cook the cake layers, not 35.

The cake is delicious and so is the frosting as long as you keep the cake in the refrigerator. At room temperature the frosting is very soft and actually started running down the sides of the cake.

Did a quick calorie add up for this cake. 775 per serving.

Sounds fantastic, but I agree with the previous reviewer: copious quantities of margarine and peanut butter? Good thing Epicurious doesn't post nutrition values. In another life I definitely would have made this.

I made a few tweaks to the recipe and this cake came out amazing! I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of regular white flour. I also used natural unsweetened peanut butter in the frosting and it came out great. I found the cake to be a little salty-but not in a bad way- so I used chocolate ganache between the layers to cut the saltiness of the cake and the peanut butter frosting. It was moist and delicious!

This cake sounds delicious. But are you serious? 5 cups of fat in one cake?

The cake was delicious i just substituted the peanut butter frosting with a chocolate frosting
