No real surprises here. It's grilled veggies, with a hint of thyme. Delicious but unremarkable. I used a grill pan inside and made 1/4 in to 1/3 in slices. Don't toss the onions in the olive oil--they will come apart. I also salt and peppered the veggies before grilling. I halved the amount of olive oil and doubled the vinegar to make it healthier and tangier.

I thought the thyme-sweet potato combination was different & tasty. Like the other reviewer, I would suggest adding an extra pepper.

This recipe is nice if you are already grilling and don't want to turn on the stove top inside to make vegetables. The vegetable choices in the original recipe were ok...I think the spices would go well with any seasonal vegetable. Nice flavor from the grilled sweet potato and I would double the bell peppers (in any color) next time as they were my favorite. You will need a basket for the onions as they fall through. If you wanted to make a meal out of this, why not try adding in some peeled shrimp or chunked chicken.

This was just ok. I thought it was a bit bland. If you're cooking on an outdoor gas grill you'll need some sort of veggie grilling pan to keep the onions from falling thru. I did the sweet potatoes directly on the grill and the onions and peppers in grill pan with holes in it. If I do try this again I may add some fresh chopped cilantro or basil just before serving.

Really good. The grilled sweet potatoes with the thyme/vinegar dressing was a nice combo. Served with the Molasses Mustard Pork Tenderloin from same issue.
