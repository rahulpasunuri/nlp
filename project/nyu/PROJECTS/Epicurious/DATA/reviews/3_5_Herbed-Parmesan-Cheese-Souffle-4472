Great, easy recipe (easy, like all soufflees, if you know what you're doing.) Great for Atkins diet if you substitte heavy cream, as I did. Doesn't come out as high as with whole milk. If you only have dried thyme, just use a tsp. full. Otherwise, too much.

The souffle was gorgeous when it came out of the oven!! I agree with another reviewer, or was that the intro to the recipe, that it would be delightful served with lamb or other rich meat. I served this as a "light" meal with a salad and my other half, I think was longing for more. I am new to the souffle world and am so enjoying exploring the different flavor possiblities, a spinach and a wonderful sweet pototo and gruyere souffle from Epicurious.

Delicious - my favorite cheese souffle so far

I followed this one almost exactly, only change was to use just 3 eggs, and it was a lovely supper with some roasted mushrooms and a salad.

I am completely in agreement with the other reviewer. This is an incredibly light and savory souffle and it's very easy to make. I substituted some of the Parmesan with Gruyere and it was absolutely delicious!

I have been making souffles for over 25 years and this is one of the best....light but loaded with flavor. I served it with steamed asparagas and a crusty baguette....heaven.
