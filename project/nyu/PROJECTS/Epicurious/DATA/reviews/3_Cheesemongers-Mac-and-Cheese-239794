Skip the nutmeg. Don't forget the buttered breadcrumbs. This is a great recipe for a ski house crew. I've also made it and frozen it for family members. It's one of those great dishes that sometimes even tastes better as leftovers.

This is a great recipe but you'll need a few adjustments. Follow the original methodology of the recipe but change the ingredients to the following. It's amazing! "1 1/2 cups coarsely grated Gruyère "1 1/2 cups coarsely grated sharp cheddar "1 1/2 cups smoked mozzarella "5 tablespoons salted butter, divided "1/4 cup all purpose flour "2 tsp chopped fresh thyme leaves "4 cups whole milk "1 cup panko breadcrumbs "1 pound penne pasta "1 tsp kosher salt "2 tsp of mustard powder (optional) "1 tsp smoked paprika "1/4 tsp cayenne (heaping tsp) "1 tsp black or white pepper

I made this recipe for a dinner party because it is part of a menu featuring my go-to, "always a hit" beef tenderloin recipe. So I figured this would be equally great. Unfortunately I did not read the reviews prior to making it, or else I wouldn't have tried it. When I tasted the cheese sauce, it struck me that it was totally insipid. Upon reviewing the ingredients, I realized that other than nutmeg, this recipe features absolutely no spices. Not even salt. Even when using top of the line cheese, you can not expect it to impart enough taste to season 1 lb. of pasta on its own. I added salt, white and black pepper, cayenne, dried parsley and a pinch of ground mustard. Although the finish product was very good, this would have been a disaster (and total waste of $$$ cheese) had I not added salt, herbs and spices. I give this 1 fork because I am rating the original recipe, not the modifications. Although the finish product was tasty, I will not make this again.

Made this recipe to the letter, used President brand Brie, Emmi Swiss Gruyere, Cabot extra sharp cheddar. I didn't add salt, though we salted at the table. My husband really liked it, and I say, what's not to like? The toasted buttered crumbs complement the cheeses very nicely. I'll definitely be making this again.

I love this recipe for how creamy it is and how easy it is to make and vary. I always get rave reviews. So use this recipe for the technique but modify it to your tastes. Definitely add salt, pepper and increase the cheese. I've added chipotle in adobo sauce and other seasonings to kick up the flavors a bit. I also use buttered panko bread crumbs for a delicate crispy topping and pretty appearance.

Salt! For all those who are claiming it's bland, it needs salt! I always add salt to mac and cheese recipes if they don't call for it (all that pasta soaks up a good bit flavor, and you need to salt to accentuate the cheesy goodness). I added 1.25 teaspoons which was perfect for my taste. I left out the nutmeg and used 2 teaspoons of mustard powder instead. I also added about 1 teaspoon of paprika, a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne, and a few grinds of black pepper. For the cheese, I chose: 1.5 cups pepper jack, 1.5 fontinella, and 1.5 cups of the brie. This batch of mac and cheese has been one of the best I've made (been on the hunt for the perfect recipe). I will definitely make this again!

Ok here is how you make this more delish! More brie more cheddar! Also I do add bacon to recipe. I cook enough strips to get the required amount of fat and use that instead butter in order to make the rue. Makes a much more creamier base. Then I chop up the bacon and use it as a topping along with the bread crumbs. Another important fix, CUT DOWN ON THE NUTMEG! I only use 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I found that the original requested amount was overwhelming the flavor. Give it a 2nd try!

a lot of time for not a lot of flavor. maybe some bacon added would help? the cheese flavors disappeared. okay but won't make again.

Yum! I increased the ratio of cheese to roux by 1/2 and used a smoked english cheddar and a smoked raclette and the pasta I used was radiatore. I went without breadcrumbs...delish! The smoked cheeses gave it a great smell and taste. Smoky!

The cheese combo was indeed bland but I made the following changes/substitutions and it worked well - overall the recipe is easy and delicious. I halved the recipe. I didn't have thyme so put chives in instead. I added a teaspoon of cayenne with the nutmeg. Instead of individual ramekins, I baked the entire thing in a gratin dish. The results were elegant enough for a dinner party and quick and delicious enough for a weeknight family dinner.

For those of you who found this bland and boring and tasteless, try this version: 2 cups shredded mozzerella, 2 cups mild cheddar, one container rindless brie, one jar of your favorite alfredo sauce, one small brick of velveeta and 3 mini baby bels (yes this can get a tad expensive). Use your favorite pasta, I like penne rigate or large (casserole) elbows best for this recipe. And skip the tasteless bread crumbs. Keep the rest of the recipe the same, but fyi you don't have to use whole milk, any milk will do. This extended version is really a cheesemonger's dream!

Rating: 3
Simple, but perhaps a little too bland. FYI cheese lovers, this is not a great combo. I would skip the brie and add gorgonzola, bleu or pepperjack. When the first batch was bland and blah, I made it a second time with pepperjack, and loved it!

This is a grown up twist on a childhood favorite but even children love this version too. It's great for using any leftover cheese. For extra decadence I stir in 1 tablespoon of warm use truffle oil in the cheese sauce.

I'm glad I did a test run of this recipe before cooking for guests. Blah! I followed this recipe to the letter and it definitely needs a little kick. And if I ever decide to make it again, it will have to be for a crowd because the leftovers aren't tasty either. Big waste of good cheese.

I've made this recipe three times now for different crowds and everyone has enjoyed it. The last time I made it I also added some Smoked Applewood Cheddar that I had in the fridge. It was only a cup but it definitely added a new layer of flavor.

I was expecting to be disappointed after reading some of the other reviews. Boy, was I surprised--this is absolute heaven!!! It isn't just a gussied up mac n' cheese by any stretch. I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to dinner guests. My notes: I used non-fresh (i.e. pre-grated) nutmeg, and I didn't have any thyme on hand, so I used dried (about a teaspoon and a half). I also accidentally added the cream even though I made it the same day as eating it. Also, it filled up 4 8oz ramekins and three pot-pie dishes (probably about 2-2.5 cups each). It was amazingly delicious--a true winner. What I'll change next time is I'll use the advised 1.25 cup ramekins. Any more is too much (this is a heavy dish!) and any less is too little.

I found this recipe to be well beyond bland, in fact almost tasteless except for the topping. My experience when baking with cheese is that it loses its strength when cooked so I usually use the sharpest and strongest cheeses in order to retain some flavour. The cheddar in this recipe is the only cheese with any strength. As well the brie separated when cooked so there were little curds. I have made other recipes that worked out much better and had a lot more taste.

We really loved this recipe. It was a little expensive, but I think it was worth it. Subtle flavors, but oh so good. Easy to make and perfect with some good bread and crisp green beans with lemon and olive oil.

I thought this dish was a great side. I actually subbed Jarlsberg for the Gruyeres(sweeter & nuttier) and of course you have to add salt and pepper. It went great with my bistro style roasted chicken, with roasted carrots and Haricot Vert and a nice glass of Burgundy on a cold sunday evening...after all it's really just glorified comfort food

Rating: 2
Not a bad sidedish. Definitely not an exciting center piece though. It helps to serve it along side something a little sweeter. I baked carrots, parsnips and beets together with sage in cream, butter and a little olive oil.

I'm disappointed but I supposed I shouldn't be. A mac and cheese made with a high-quality cheddar with a touch of Gruyere really doesn't need to be improved upon. I made it, but I didn't enjoy it. I'll stick with my standard recipe.

Not too much work but rather expensive. My cheeses did not incorporate smoothly into the sauce so maybe I did something wrong along the way. Definitely not an outstanding dish but it still tasted good and was a nice treat on a snowy winter day.

The presentation was wonderful but the final product lacked inspiration. This recipe needs more flavorful cheeses and desperately needs salt. My guests thought the dish was just OK ...

I agree with the other reviewers who said that this was in the okay, not exceptional range. I also agree with the other reviewers who said, "what did you expect, it's a basic mac and cheese recipe made with good cheeses?" I think that part of my problem was that my cheddar really sucked. It came from Whole Foods and looked good, but ended up tasting terrible. Why are there so many bad cheddars out there? I've gotten so many over the years! So yes, good cheese is important. I, for one, loved the nutmeg. I have to say that it's VERY important to ALWAYS use freshly-grated nutmeg in any recipe, though. I seem to be the only one who had this problem, so perhaps I made a mistake, but I think that the recipe calls for WAY too much milk--it turned out too watery. My Dad loved it, though, and has asked for a repeat.

Rating: 3
I forgot to add-- I used whole wheat penne, which was totally fine since with all these cheese and herbs, this is a very rich dish. I also added a fair amount of salt and pepper to the cheese sauce before assembling , because it just seemed odd not to add it.. plus it needed it!

This was really, really delicious, except it calls for waaaaaaay too much nutmeg for my tastes. I'd halve to amount the recipe calls for. I also used 1% milk instead of whole.

I'm not sure what those who gave the negative reviews were expecting. It is just a very nice basic mac and cheese recipe......with a bit more class using good cheeses. We like it very much and so has everyone we've served it to. If you are expecting a ton of flavor, look elsewhere. If you want a good, easy recipe for some nice comfort food, this is one to try. And if possible, do make it in individual ramekins, the presentation is soooo nice!

We usually make Ina Garten's Mac n Cheese, so this wasn't a big deviation from the recipe. It was good with some modifications that included whole wheat penne and an addition of asiago and parmesan cheeses. Good and comforting with roasted tomatoes and broccoli on the side.

I expected more from this. Giada's M&C is the best I've had. Check that out.

The picture in the magazine looked oh so tempting, and we're definitely fans of fancy mac n cheese, so I rushed to make this one. As some of the other reviewers have noted, the result was kind of... meh. Not bad texture, but really not all that special or different from our usual recipe, without the brie. I suspect that simply a bit more salt would have improved things some (brie doesn't bring much salt, and my cheddar was maybe not that salty either; I did taste the sauce before baking, but I do find that with mild-flavored cheeses, the dish can end up needing more salt than I would normally be inclined to add) All in all, I don't think I'll bother with this one again.

Rating: 2
Underwhelming. The picture looks great, and the top half-inch was tasty, but the rest was just too bland. Brie is a great cheese for some things, but mac and cheese turns out no to be its best use.Maybe if you just skipped the brie and doubled up on the cheddar you'd have a winner. I didn't try it.

oh yes, and I used medium shells instead of penne which holds the sauce much better than penne.

I really enjoyed this dish! My boyfriend even said 'Bravo!'. I used a combination of sharp cheddar, smoked cheddar, raw milk gruyere, chive brie, and regular brie. Added garlic and parsley to breadcrumbs and baked in individual dishes which I think is key for presentation. Since we're only two, I partially-baked 6 in a large muffin tin and then froze, and finished only two in the oven It's a fair bit of work, but for four delicious meals it's worth it.

Don't be fooled by the pretty picture. The meal itself is dismally drab. The cheese aren't enough to perk it up. Maybe add salt, ground mustard, a dash of cayenne? Replace the Brie with something with a bit more bite to it. This just wasn't worth the money or effort.

This is one of the best mac n' cheese recipes we've ever had. We have had dinner at La Laiterie many times, and will gladly make the trip from Boston for their food, anytime. The brie rounds out the flavor of this marvelous 'mac' and the cheddar and gruyere give it a generous, sharp bite....perfection!

This is not your 4-year-olds favorite mac 'n cheese recipe, but if you're a fromage freak you'll truly love it. We used smoked sharp cheddar, extra thyme, and homemade breadcrumbs. The nice cheeses made it a little expensive, but what is cost to a true cheeselover? Eat with juicy pears on the side.

With Brie and Gruyere at $11.99/lb this was an expensive dish! It was very good and looked pretty--just like the picture--but it's not the best I've ever had. Lacked flavor. I'll admit, I put only 1/4 tsp nutmeg and only 1/2 the fresh thyme in it because I want my mac and cheese to taste like, well, mac and cheese--nothing more. The breadcrumbs were good--don't skimp there.
