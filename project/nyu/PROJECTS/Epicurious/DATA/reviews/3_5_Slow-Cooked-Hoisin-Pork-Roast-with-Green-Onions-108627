Have used this recipe many times. Original recipe is good, but this is also one that lends itself to lots of improvisation. Recently made two batches for a large party, each time using a 4 hr setting on a slow cooker. To each batch I added lightly cooked crushed garlic cloves, 1/2 med onion, a chunk of ginger and several pinches of red pepper flakes to the crock pot. Big flavor improvements! And to get more sauce - of which there never seems to be enough in original recipe - I've added one cup of chicken broth at beginning of the slow cook. (Sauce should still be simmered/reduced and defatted as mentioned in the recipe.) Re the whiskey: Having made with and without, I'd suggest this can be left out to no negative effect. One last note: I recommend letting the meat rest for 20 mins, per instructions, and then gently pulling/slicing apart the roast at the seams. With the resulting large and small sections, it's easier to find the direction of the muscle and cut against the grain, resulting in extremely tender chunks or slices, as desired. Great suggestions by previous reviewers here, too. Check them out and enjoy...

Very easy to make but kind of bland. I'll pump up the seasonings if I ever make it again. Another reviewer mentioned ginger which sounds good. Maybe some hot sauce too.

I followed the recipe and it was fantastic. Even my kids loved it. It's an easy recipe for entertaining a large group.

I really enjoyed this, though I made it with some modifications based on reviews. It's nice to have another easy recipe for pork shoulder besides BBQ. My changes: - Salted and peppered pork before browning - After browning pork, sauteed green onion pieces with sliced ginger and crushed cloves of garlic. Deglazed with some sherry before putting the hoisin covered pork back in the pan. - Consider adding some orange peel next time. - Defatted sauce and added a little sherry and water to finish.

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day yesterday and it was easy and delicious! I followed the directions and wouldn't change a thing. To accompany this tasty roast, I roasted some asparagus and also made fried rice + a salad with mandarin oranges and toasted almonds. Can't wait to enjoy the leftovers!

Made this with a pork loin roast a few weeks ago. I made mandarin pancakes and served it sliced rolled up in the pancakes with additional hoisin sauce and sliced green onion, did not have any plum sauce. I will be making it again today with a pork sirloin roast (purchased from Costco) and will put in my slow cooker after searing as I know this cut of meat will shred and think it will be better rolled up in the panckes.

The first time I made this I didn't have green onions and used regular diced white onions. I didn't care for the whisky taste, but my family loved it. The next time I made it for a dinner party without the whisky, and again with diced white onions. The guest raved about it. This is so easy and delicious; it has become one of my go to recipes. I

I used a bone in pork roast, rubbed it the night before with five spice powder, ginger, garlic, and pepper. The next morning I threw it into the slow cooker with the hoisin, onions, more garlic, red pepper flakes and cooked it on low for eight hours. I used sherry when making the sauce because it was what was on hand and it worked out great. Ridiculous how easy it was in relation to how tasty it was, definite keeper!

This was surprisingly good and EASY! I had a 4 lb roast that was done after just under two hours (probably should've been taken out earlier). The meat was tender and the sauce was great. Served with carrots w/garlic & sherry vinegar and mashed potatoes.

So good. Will make the following changes next time we make this (and there will be a next time...soon!). Pepper meat before searing instead of using whole peppercorns. Meat may taken more than 3 hours. Judge by fork tearing. Brining in mild salt brine may help produce tenderness in shorter cook time. Strain drippings then pour them into fat seperator. Return onions to defatted drippings, add Cognac and reduce to desired thickness. This one worth doing the work to perfect it to your taste. And, soooooo easy!

Decent fusion recipe. it's supposed to evoke the flavors of Peking Duck. Requires some ginger or garlic to reduce 'porky' taste. Added some dry chilies into the sauce to have a bit more depth. Leftovers go well if wrapped in green onion pancakes (cong you bing) with hoisin sauce slathered inside (just the way you'd have peking duck). However, the flavors of this recipe need to be adjusted for someone who wants strong flavor. It's an exciting dish for a midwestern palate. Adequate.

Made this yesterday and it couldn't be more simple. The flavor was great, meat was so moist & tender. Served with vegetable fried rice and my guests raved.

This recipe is wonderful. The roast is juicy and just falls apart. The hoisin sauce and the whiskey makes a wonderful sauce as well. The leftovers are even great on pizza! I used the Pilsbury pizza dough with hoisin sauce in place of tomato sauce. Then I sprinkled on some shredded cheese, green onion strips, the shredded pork pieces and some mushrooms. Delicious!

Really delicious and very easy. I made this with an inexpensive cut of pork and the meat just fell from the bone. Definitely making this one again!

Delicious. Easy to make and the pork was so tender. The sauce is a little sweet but fine if you use just a bit.

The best pork roast I have eaten. I used thinly sliced yellow onions instead of green onions and include two whole garlic cloves. Used Jim Beam bourbon in the sauce.

Made this with a 9lb bone-in pork shoulder and cooked it for 3.5 hours at 300. It was delicious and so very easy to make. Leftovers were great too. Will definately make this one again.

I followed the recipe except that I used Brandy instead of whiskey. It was wonderful and soooooo tender. I made a fried rice with five spice powder to serve with it. The flavors worked together very well. I will make this again, for sure!

We made this with a 6lb shoulder roast from our local farm, Stone Barns. It was absolutely meltingly good, and an easy crowd pleaser. If I was to make it again, I might enhance it slightly with a little orange peel and star anise.

This tasted much more complex than it is. Excellent flavor and too easy to believe. Great "pulled pork" sandwiches on french/sourdough bread the next day. A keeper, definitely.

This is the easiest roast recipe I've come across so far, resulting in the juiciest and most tender product. The sweetness from the hoisin sauce and scallions went perfectly with the pork. Wonderful!

Great recipe. I always subsitute boneless pork short ribs for pork shoulder. I had Jim Beam Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey on hand, so not scotch but worked great. I added a 1/4 cup of whiskey when I baked the ribs (in addition to the stuff added later), We served with roasted sweet potatoes and onions and parmesan..........from this site. We increased the heat and cooking time to get a more fried hashbrowny taste and omitted the rosemary and cheese. Nice combo!!!!!!!!!!

Don't know what the other reviewers thought. It was tasteless and not worth the minimal effort!

the most flavor for the least work I've encountered in a long time. Pork is not first on my list of entrees, but this was great. Loaded with taste and falling apart tender. I used a center cut boneless roast. A keeper.

I used pork chops, and it turned out great. I wouldn't add the green onions until half way through the cooking time, or they don't look as nice. A great dish.

This was so easy and really wonderful. I used a pork tenderloin because that's what I had (plus only 2 of us), and roasted after browning for only 30 minutes - juicy and delicious, with sauce and more green onions served on the slices. My husband was so impressed - I'll serve this at our house warming dinner!

Terrific recipe. The dish received rave reviews especially from me the cook! I served it with chunky pieces of roasted yam (tossed with olive oil, five spice and powdered ginger). Excellent leftovers.

So easy & good as the other reviewers have said. The best part of the leftovers (only 2 of us here)was I used the thinly sliced pork & hoisin sauce in making wraps. Added a green onion & some lettuce & Wow . . what a easy & great second meal!!

I thought this dish was great! The flavor was wonderful- the whiskey sauce added a nice touch to it. I also made the Five-Spice Sweet Potato Puree (Oct.03) with it... nice touch! I would definitely make this again! My family loved it.

Definitely easy, very tender but I didn't think it had much taste. The sauce was just okay my husband didn't like it and ate the meat plain.

This was SO EASY. I have made it twice and both time it was perfect. A great dinner party entrée, since the roast is actually better setting for awhile before carving. I even got my children to eat it and like it -- something to be said for a pork roast!

This was a delicious and easy dish. We used a 3.5 lb. roast but otherwise followed the recipe exactly ...it turned out tender and flavorful and we had extra sauce. A great dish to make when you don't want a lot of last minute fuss. We served it with mashed pumpkin squash and it proved to be a perfect side dish.

Delicious and easy as the ingredients are few- a great fall dish that received rave reviews. Used a 4 1/4 lb boneless pork roast and jar of hoisin (served 4 plus leftovers). Start pork at 400 for first 10-25 min, then lower temp to directed 325. Also, cooked an hour per lb and the roast was falling-apart tender. Scotch drippings/gravy is great, too, and worth the little extra effort.
