I needed something fast and easy, and this was both. Unfortunately the result wasn't very rewarding. They just seemed oily and salty to me and I couldn't even taste the prosciutto and basil I put in to add some interest. If I try this again I will leave out the cheese inside(as the cook from Alameda suggested) and add other ingredients to enhance the flavor.

This is a fantastic basic recipe with infinite variations. I added strips of prosciutto on top of the cheese (a mix of grated and shredded parmesan and asiago). It was the THE hit of a holiday meal. Definitely dredge the cut pieces in some more cheese, & don't worry about under or over cooking them as a couple of minutes more or less made no difference to people's enjoyment. For additional ideas, both sweet & savory, type "puff pastry" in the recipe search space on this site...if you have a few sheets of pastry in the freezer you can always prepare something easy & elegant. Also, for rolling instructions, A Cook from Nashville is right, check out the sweet palmiers for an easy to follow picture.

These were excellent, I did as the CA cook suggested and made little ones. Cooked the day before and they were still very tasty. Would definitely make again.

I haven't tried this yet but intend to tomorrow. I found this on the site under Sweet Palmiers to see how to roll them. http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/photo?id=106763

I made this for a charity event because the recipe was so easy and produced a large quantity (I quartered each pastry sheet before forming and cutting, making miniature palmiers). Many requests for the recipe. I made them again for a tea party, using cinnamon sugar instead of the cheese. If you fold them right, you can make the heart-shaped. They were a big hit, too. Since then, I've read recipes that use basil pesto or pureed sun dried tomatoes instead of the cheese. You can also cut the pastry into strips after rolling them in the cheese, then twist into loose spirals and bake. Press down on the ends to adhere the twists to the baking sheet so they don't unroll as they bake. All in all, easy, versatile and popular.

Delicious and sooooo rich. My guests were very impressed. However, I agree that a picture would be helpful. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to fold them. These were also great reheated in the oven the next night.

Ridiculously easy and delicious! I believe the illustration in GOURMET was helpful in understanding how to fold the dough, and so might be useful here, as well - a novice cook might be challenged by the instructions. Next time I'll try the Palmiers with sugar instead of cheese.
