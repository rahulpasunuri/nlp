Superb, pretty much as written. Don't fret if you cannot find sour cherries - regular Bing cherries work perfectly. I substituted lime zest and lime juice for the lemon and it was a perfect pairing. Corn starch (2 tbsp) substitutes well for the tapioca. The Simple Pie Pastry is a great, all-purpose pastry, too. Fantastic!

Very good crumb topping. Can make ahead and the crumb stays crisp and doesn't get soggy. I skipped the pie crust and it was fine. Cut back on the sugar - thanks for that suggestion!

Good but would cut down on the sugar in the filling.

Personally, I found the topping to be sickly sweet but guests raved about it.

Followed the coconut crumb topping steps exactly - very, very yummy! I did modify the rest of this recipe slightly - used a purchased pie crust and didn't have quite enough cherries so I mixed in blueberries as well - and it was a really, really tasty pie. Recommended!

Did not turn out very well and even though I love coconut, it just didn't seem to work for my husband and I.

Took advice and added almond extract to the fruit mix. I also added slivered almonds to the crumble topping, they really helped lessen the sweet flavors of the coconut and brown sugar. Didn't have enough cherries, so I made a cherry-loquat crumble. It turned out wonderful. Took it to a staff party and recieved many compliments. I would use less sugar next time.

I don't think we have to always try to eat low-fat! Sometimes you just need a really good dessert, and this one fits the bill. I have made this twice, using store bought crust, and it has gone over fabulously. I highly recommend it.

I thought the topping of this pie was wonderful. I was making many pies with traditional crust and ran out of dough for the top of the last pie. I tried this topping with another cherry filling made with a teaspoon of almond extract and cornstarch and thought it was wonderful.

This pie is absolutely wonderful. I always hated cherry pies made with canned fruits. What a difference with fresh fruits ! The topping is really a good match for the cherries. My husband can't get enough of this recipe.

I loved this pie. It was perfectly sweet and just a bit tart. The coconut topping was an excellent choice. I made it for a gathering with friends and everybody loved it. I will definately make this again. My friends are going to buy me a cherry pitter though. They laughed when I told them it took me 30 mins. to pit 2 1/2 lbs. of cherries.

This recipe is great. My only complaint was the difficulty of pitting all of the cherries. I have purchased a cherry pitter and am hoping that helps.

This pie was fabulous. Even non-cherry pie lovers were wowed. Coconut is a great addition. I also tried it with clear jel instead of tapioca, and the results were even better - firmer consistency for the fruit.Definitely a keeper!

When I saw this recipe I had to bake it for my husband seeing how he loves both cherries and coconut. It was a huge hit! We are fortunate to live in Washington state where we get fresh local Rainier and Bing cherries, so I used both and it came out delicious! The topping was a hit as was the wonderful crust. I will try it with raspberries next time - bet it comes out just as tasty.

Cherry pie is my favorite and with a few alterations, this was quite good. I used canned tart cherries, as fresh were not in season. Added a tad more sugar and a dash of cinnamon to the filling. The topping was great!

I love this recipe, especially the combination of the coconut topping and the cherries. It was the first time I ever made a pie from scratch, and I'm looking forward to making it again!

I made this pie for my extended family, who LOVED it! Several people commented multiple times how much they enjoyed it. I highly recommend this dessert and look forward to the next time I will make it!

It has too much fat content for this family. Do you not have any healthy recipes? such as desserts with less fat and sugars? I use an American Heart Assoc. crust recipe so that helps. I would like to be able to have good tasting pie fillings with less fat and sugar contents. Thank you.
