Easy and flavorful. Used lime juice and added some to the marinade as it didnt seem to be enough to cover the shrimp. Will use a different bowl next time. I will also add some more ginger as I love ginger and feel it got a bit overpowered by the rest of the ingredients. I made this on the grill for an easy dinner party appetizer.

So simple and so good. My favorite shrimp recipe so far. Try it with the pineapple salsa recipe on this site.

Make it green: I combined the marinade ingredients and the cilantro with a mortar and pestle and then let the shrimp marinate in that for about 45 min. If you don't mind green shrimp (my family didn't), then you don't have to worry about garnishing later. Tasty recipe!

I made this for company and they absolutely loved it. I think this is a great recipe and very easy to make.

Make that 3 1/2 forks. This is great, and tomorrow I'm making it with Toasted Garlic Rice with Fresh Herbs and Lime from this site. I wouldn't marinate these very long--shrimp just don't require much marinating. If you want to up the flavor factor, use the marinade instead as a sort of "dressing" that you toss the shrimp in after grilling. This is a trick I've used many times with grilled meats that have disappointed me flavor-wise even after marinating for hours. Bon appetit!

This one is a winner! Very easy but impressive when served. I threaded fresh pineapple on the skewers as well, and it went great with the shrimp. Red peppers might look nice on there too. My fiance isn't even a shrimp fan, but he's already requested a repeat next week.

Shockingly out of garlic the day I made this, so omitted, but will certainly add the next time.

This was a big, and QUICK, hit. I really upped the ginger--by mistake the first time but next time by design. I also added a bit of lime juice to the mix. Marinated for 45 minutes and it was plenty flavorful. Tonite I will sub basil from the garden for cilantro.

We were surprised by how little flavor the shrimp had after marinating for well over an hour. They would be much better with a dipping sauce or something.

I've made this twice now for party guests. It was a big hit both times, although they were a little too hot the second time. This was because I let them marinade much longer (1.5 hours) as opposed to the 15 minutes the first time. It's also possible that I added too much pepper, but I'm sure it was mostly due to longer marinading time. Peeling and deveining was also time-consuming, but the results are well worth it.

Like one of the other cooks, we added garlic chili paste and the result was fantastic - we couldn't get enough. Definitely a keeper.

This strikes me as a great marinade either alone or as a start to add other ingredients to one's tastes. The only change I made was to add 1/2 Tbsp of soy sauce. Excellent.

Very easy to make, and always a great success with my guests, whether served alone as an appetiser or with rice and salad as an entree.

Very good flavor and spice. I made individual shrimp skewers as appetizers -- nice and quick -- they cook in minutes as guests arrive. However, I broiled them; I think they would have looked more enticing had I grilled them. BK

We loved this! A bit heavy on the garlic, and light on the ginger, but otherwise, simple, easy and delicious! I had cilantro left over so I was happy to use it and would require it now. Usually I am not fond of it but it makes the dish.

I made a couple of additions...I added 2 tblspns of Thai Chili paste and lemon juice to the marinade to kick it up a notch, since I didn't have any red pepper flakes. It was very good. I even marinated some halibut in it. This recipe is very good with the pineapple salsa on this site

This a great recipe that is very quick, and easy to make. It has been a big hit with all of my friends. Sometimes I will add scallops along with the shrimp.

I used this as a quick yet impressive main dish, accompanied by white rice, mixed greens and pineapple salsa (on this site). It was just the right combination of heat, acid and sweetness. Also, because I cut the recipe down for two, I prepared honey glazed pineapple (also on this site) with the remaining half pineapple. An excellent end to a summery meal!

Thought this was an excellent way to grill shrimp. Will probably try suggestions to "kick it up a notch" with the next batch.

Rating: 3
Based on the recipe itself and the reviews, I knew this needed to be kicked up a notch or two. I doubled the olive oil plus a tsp. sesame oil and a teaspoon of garlic and chili sauce in the marinade also squeezed some lemon into it. This was fiery alright! Served it with skewered red peppers and onions done on the grill and leftover cold peanut butter noodles. It was a winner dinner.Will definitely make this one for guests.

We thought these were really delicious. Sauteed them and was out of cilantro. Think they would be really good on the barbeque. Added some extra ginger.will definitely make again.

Very good & very easy. Made only slight modifications: I added more ginger, marinated the shrimp longer than suggested, and sauteed them instead of grilling/broiling.

Great and easy recipe. I make an aioli sauce to go with it -- mayo, garlic, lime, ginger -- everyone has raved about it.

This was so-so. I found it to be not as spicy as I had expected.

Excellent. Will add more ginger next time, and maybe even a ginger-lime-cilantro dipping sauce.

Fabulous shrimp! We've made it several times and everybody loves it.

Have you ever recieved such great compliments for so little effort-try this dish. Spicy enough for a mixed group of people as is-add more heat for indiviual taste.

Loved these shrimp. Did add a lot more red pepper, based on other reviews. And served with some sweet/hot Thai dipping sauce I had in the fridge. Very good, will make again. Worked fine under the broiler.

The ginger makes this recipe. We usually up the peppers because we like things spicy.

This is a good recipe, but certainly not "Fiery". Maybe with some added heat it would be better.

Excellent recipe. Fast and easy and wonderful taste. Don't forget the lime and cilantro; they made the shrimp truly devine!

My friends rated this "the best shrimp they have ever had". Now when people come over they expect me to make it every time. I mix ketchup and horseradish together for a dipping sauce. I buy the largest shrimp I can find and just lay them right on the grill, turn them once and they are done to perfection.

A dash or two of sesame oil in the marinade adds a delightful taste. Wash the finished product down with chilled St Pauli Girl beer.

Good recipe. It is simple to prepare and big on taste. Anyone that enjoys shrimp will find this a recipe to return to. Works well with scallops also.

Rating: 4
coupled with the "Coriander dipping sauce" from the Salmon spring roll recipe, these shrimps were excellent! My guests raved for days! A few of my guests felt the "heat" from the red pepper, but they rarely eat asian, so one might reduce the amount to please others. Even the few leftover shrimps I had the next day were fantastic with just lime juice squeezed on them!

The only thing I changed on the recipe was the amount of red pepper, which I decreased to accomidate my guests taste.
