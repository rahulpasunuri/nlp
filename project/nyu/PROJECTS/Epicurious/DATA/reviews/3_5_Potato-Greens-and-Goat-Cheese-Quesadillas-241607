I'm not going to rate it, as I haven't made it, but I diced a couple of sweet potatoes last night and steamed them in the microwave and mashed them, just to have on hand. I could just use the mashed sweet potatoes, whatever greeens I want to and the goat cheese. I think I'd use jarred tomatilla salsa, as I prefer it over tomato based salsa.

Absolutely delicious, though I would modify it next time to cut down on the extreme messiness. I will follow other reviewers' suggestions and make it with two flat tortillas instead of trying to fold over. There was definitely a lot of spillage when trying to turn the folded quesadilla. Couldn't find mustard greens so used arugula, which was an excellent peppery substitute. I thought all the flavors really came through, including the goat cheese, which let's be honest is what drew me to this recipe in the first place. One thing that seems to have confused people, and confused me momentarily, is the "steaming" of the potatoes. The directions as written seem to indicate you put them in the oven at 275 and wait for them to get tender, which would obviously take longer than 8 minutes. I cubed them and steamed them in a steamer basket in a pot of water, and it took 8 minutes exactly. The directions re oven and baking sheet are just so you have a warm place to put your quesadillas while you're making the rest.

This recipe is fabulous! I made a few changes. I used sweet potatoes instead of Yukon Golds. I roasted them in the oven for 30 minutes at 375. I couldn't find mustard greens at Whole Foods today, so I substituted a combination of beet greens and Swiss chard. Also, as always, I add ground cumin to any recipe that calls for chili powder. I recommend using whole wheat tortillas to add to the flavor and nutritional value.

I love this recipe. Tip: make extra mustard green-salsa sauce because it is DELICIOUS. My husband hates goat cheese, so I make his with all Monterey Jack and he loves it.

I microwave the potatoes, which really cuts down on the time, and I substitute spinach. It's easy, delicious, and a great way to eat vegetarian without missing meat at all.

Very tasty, but didn't like how much the quesadilla moved. Might try more jack cheese next time. Also, got impatient with waiting for the potatoes to cook, so after they were in the oven for 15 minutes already, I threw them into some water and boiled them till tender.

We made this last night and it was delicious! We made 2 substitutions, we used Arugula instead of the Mustard greens, and we sliced the potatoes per other reviewers. The potatoes do take about a half hour to cook, and I sprinkled the spice mixture on both sides of the potatoes for the last 10 minutes. There are endless variations you could switch this up with. I have some extra pureed greens and salsa - can't wait to try this again!

I've made this several times and it's always a hit. Great flavors. A tasty hearty vegetarian meal.

I use spinach rather than mustard greens and slice rather than dice the potatoes...great! I'm thinking of taking this to a potluck but wonder if how well it will do "pre cooked". Any suggestions? Cook up as per usual and then re-warm in the hostess's oven? Has anyone tried this?

I made these with two changes: I used corn tortillas in lieu of flour and sharp cheddar cheese in lieu of jack. (The missing hot pepper was made up for with my very spicy homemade salsa verde.) The mustard greens lent a very interesting sharpness, but the generous schmear of goat cheese was undetectable in the final product. Which was too bad, because I was betting that the flavor combination would be delicious. I think you might need either to cook the greens beforehand or add far more goat cheese for its flavor to come through -- but those options to me sound respectively like a pain in the neck and expensive, so I think I'll just use a cheaper cheese next time. Or maybe less salsa.

This recipe is unexpectedly great. You must use mustard greens, they really give it the unique kick. My husband who usually doesn't like potato/tortilla combinations loved it.

Rating: 3
This was absolutely amazing; at least the way I changed it up. I used corn tortillas, and since I had an herbed goat cheese, I added some olive oil to it, and then spread it on both sides of the tortillas. I used spinach, topped with the potatoes and Havarti cheese, and then a super spicy roasted tomatillo salsa with habanero chiles (SPICY!). Put the other goat cheesed-tortilla on top and fried it up in olive oil. It was delicious and satisfying. So many ways to change up this recipe; love it!

I made this for a dinner party, and everyone loved it. I was easily able to make 8 quesadillas instead of four out of this recipe.

Also -- this recipe made enough to stuff 6 tortillas, rather than 4. As the earlier reviewers have said, otherwise they are overstuffed and hard to turn in the pan.

A hit with the husband! I finely chopped the mustard greens and they were super-spicy in the quesadillas. The goat cheese went unnoticed with the other ingredients - I'd skip it next time. This took over an hour to prepare -- the potatoes took about 25 mins to steam -- but definitely worth it.

Delicious and easy recipe! I use spinach instead of mustard greens (easier to obtain, and I know what to do with leftover spinach). The potatoes with the chili powder and melted cheeses are so yummy. This dish is also easy to modify -- any dark greens will do, and the cheeses can be substituted (feta instead of goat's cheese, cheddar instead of monterey jack, etc.) I've made this one a dozen times... flavorful, healthy, easy -- what's not to love?

Rating: 4
Fantastic, easy dinner. Didn't have mustard greens or Yukon Golds so used spinach and good old russets instead. LOVED the goat cheese. Delicious! I agree that it's easier not to fold one tortilla but to place ingredients on bottom one and then top with a second tortilla. Cook one quesadilla at time on the skillet. Will definitely make again.

We have made this several times and love it--but I am a big mustard green fan. Hubby hates goat cheese so I put extra Monterey Jack on his instead. I use the large tortillas and don't fold them--I put all the topping on the bottom 2 tortillas and top with the top 2 and cook on a griddle. That might solve the "overstuffing" problem (although I always end up with a few extra potatoes, come to think of it.)

These quesadillas are great! I made them several times with spinach and different kinds of cheese, and they are always very tasty. Pan frying can be a bit messy, so using less of the salsa topping usually works best.

My daughter (15) and her friend made this for dinner. We subbed in tomatoe salsa and kale because that's what there was in the local market. I will definitely search out the proper ingredients because it was very tasty and worth trying again.

I did not find mustard greens so I decided to add spinach and rocket greens. As for the cheese I used the mexican 4 cheese mix that includes: cheddar, asadero, queso quesadilla and monterey jack cheeses. This quesadillas turn out very tasty. And next day eat leftovers directly from the fridge, yummi they are so good like this too!

Using the mustard greens gave the dish a spice that worked very well with the salsa verde, chili powder, and the jack cheese. They were large and bursting with ingredients, but were very easy to turn on a flat griddle. All together yummy and melty. A great summer meal with very unique flavors.

This was yummy! I couldn't find salsa verde, so made my own version by blitzing together cherry tomatoes, white wine vinegar, fresh green chillies, parsley, garlic, onion and salt.

Absolutely delicious. I accidently murdered the potatoes (note to self, don't walk away from the stove when cooking) so did not include them but the quesadillas still turned out beautifully. I too used spinach because that's what I had and it needed to be used but will try this again with the mustard greens. I might add some garlic to the salsa verde/spinach mix to give it a little jolt. I also might try these with mushrooms sauteed with a little garlic instead of potatoes next time. Perfct as is but ripe with possibility. Enjoy!

Substituted spinach for greens, feta for goat, added parmesan and cheddar, hot pepper flakes, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Browned in non-stick pan till warmed inside. Topped off with plain yogurt and minced, fresh cilantro. Husband and I thought this was a keeper.

I haven't tried these, but after reading several reviews, I have a suggestion. Instead of a frying pan, grill quesadillas, open side up, in a George Foreman grill - works great for my chicken & cheese quesadillas, so will probably work just as well for these.

This needs work. First, there was way too much stuffing for 4 tacos. I thought maybe it melted down as no one said anything about it ( thanks guys ;) ). And it would not hold up to being picked up and dipped. Very messy.

Made this tonight and really liked the different flavors and the excuse to use goat cheese. However, I discovered I'm not a fan of the bite/spice from the mustard greens, so I'll make it with spinach next time. It'll let the goat cheese stand out more, which is what I prefer.

I didn't realize the recipe called for Monterey Jack cheese - so I instead put in what I had - feta - and used spinach instead of mustard greens. I also used sprouted wheat tortillas. Boyfriend raved over them - and he's not into health food. I served with black bean and corn salad and guacamole - healthy and delicious meal.

This was an intereting combination of flavor, texture. We enjoyed it and it was even good reheated the next day. I did slice the potatoes to help them fit. And I put them together differently, preparing them in a skillet - filling the tortilla on one side and folding over. Easier for me than moving full quesadillas around.

Sliced the potatoes and agree that the mustard greens make the dish. Used plain monterey instead of the pepper jack because the salsa verde I got was very hot. Now I'm trying to figure out if I can make these AGAIN this week without boring my husband or wearing out the dishes welcome!

These were so yummy. I substituted spinach for the mustard greens. I also used regular (hot) salsa, and sliced rather than cubed the potatoes as others suggested. They are a bit tricky to flip but so wonderfully flavorful!

These were delicious! They were delicious even though I screwed them up so we will definitely be making these again. I agree with a previous poster who said these were a bit of work- certainly moreso than the traditional 'dilla. But, for a new take on a classic, I'm ok with the little bit of extra work these take to prepare. I also sauteed the greens in garlic- yum! I diced the potatos smaller since someone mentioned they take longer to cook but I wouldn't recommend it. Also, I tried baking them whole (as in build 2 quesadillas on a whole tortilla, top with another and bake) and, while this method works GREAT for normal quesadillas, it just made a mess with these. Despite my blunders the taste was a winner and something I'll add to our regular rotation. It's a nice twist on a classic.

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy, though the potatoes took longer than 8 minutes to steam. I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and sauteed the greens with a little garlic before making the quesadillas, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. An elegant, gourmet twist on a weeknight favorite.

These were really good. I made them for a party as an appetizer. I used whole grain tortillas, a lighter, mexican cheese blend (instead of monterrey jack), and I also briefly sauteed some of the mustard greens with garlic that I used for the base. Everyone loved then and I've already given the recipe to several people.

This was a little more work than I had bargained for, but a winner all the same. The mustard greens make this dish - substitute at your own peril. Also, I forgot the goat cheese. I remembered while eating, so added it at the table (what a dope). Anyway, a huge difference. Two very different food experiences - with and without goat cheese - and I couldn't say I preferred one of the other, much to my surprise. Bottom line: Love it!

I sliced the potatoes instead of cubing them which made filling the quesadillas much easier. Buy the mustard greens pre-bagged and pre-chopped, it makes for a lot less work. DELICIOUS.

This was really, really good. It wound up a little spicy for my taste, though that may depend on your salsa. It was really a great blend of flavors, and a terrific use of mustard greens--I thought the bite that they gave it was great and would really encourage everyone to use them rather than subbing in spinach.

Rating: 4
Back again, this time with a variation: I added one parsnip root (peeled and cubed) to the potatoes - these are sweet right now and they are a perfect foil to the bitterness of the greens. Also, I did not have salsa verde (which can make the sauce pretty runny) and so I added simply half a jalepeno and half a tomatillo with some salt and lime juice. I had extra potato/parsnip and sauce and so I tossed them together and had it cold the next day - how very delicious!

Delicious! One of my teenage sons is vegetarian and the other isn't, so I look for recipes that will satisfy all. I suppose you could add some cooked chicken to this, but it isn't necessary at all. It was very filling and satisfying. No mustard greens were available in my market, so I used spinach. I don't have a food processor, so I chopped it as small as I was able, and sautéed it just to reduce the bulk a bit. I overcooked the potatoes so they were on the mashed side, but no one seemed to notice. The tangy goat cheese was a perfect companion to the spinach. We will definitely make this again.

I was really excited about this recipe, and duly disappointed. It was ok. Nothing better than that. Next time, if I make it again, I will use more goat cheese and will introduce some tomatoes, I think. Also, I will reduce a *a bit* the amount of mustard greens. Though I don't have the same opinion, my boyfriend thought the hot monterey jack overpowered the potato flavor he was wanting. I will try sauteeing the mustard greens in a bit of garlic beforehand next time, too, as another reviewer just noted.

delicious! my boyfriend and i both loved them; i used fingerling potatoes and regular salsa fresca since i had them on hand...my boyfriend preferred sauteeing the mustard greens with a little garlic beforehand, as it made them easier to compress/fit in the tortilla, and was less crunchy. we'll definitely have these again :)

Yum! It's well worth tracking down the mustard greens- I found them at the green market in Union Sq. for any New Yorkers out there. They were unusual and made the dish. I would make this again for sure.

This was certainly delicious, but I found the handling a bit of a problem. Once all the filling is between the tortillas, I found it difficult to keep them intact getting to the pan and then flipping them over. Lots of filling spilled out, which got rather frustrating. But they were certainly tasty!

I made these hoping to satisfy my 14 year old vegetarian daughter. I used kale. I also would look for a chunkier salsa verde. We all liked the recipe. My daughter would have liked it better without the goat cheese. I would have liked it better with red pepper and mushrooms instead of potatoes and my husband liked it just the way it was. I would make this again with variations for the different tastes in my family. A nice change from the basic quesalilla/

Delicious! I would ensure that greens are dry and that you use a salsa verde that is 'chunky' and not too watery. This will prevent any extra liquid than necessary.

So, so good! Doesn't really sound like all that much, but I made this recipe on the recommendation of a friend, and it was delish. Next time I would probably omit the extra salt on the potatoes - doesn't really need it. I could live without the goat cheese as well. I'll definitely make these again.
