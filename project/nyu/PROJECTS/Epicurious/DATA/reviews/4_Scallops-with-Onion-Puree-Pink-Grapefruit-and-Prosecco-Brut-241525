Made this for Valentine's Day dinner and my husband raved about it! Next time, I'll probably use less butter in the sauce and replace the prosecco with white wine or cheaper sparkling wine. Very tasty, very attractive on the plate.

Subtle, beautiful, delicious. Used red onion instead to add more warm color and served over a bit of arugula.

This is a great recipe and the grapefruit is different and an appreciated counterpoint. My husband thought he didn't like scallops until I made this. Very easy and everyone has been 'wowed'.

What to say? This was good...not spectacular. There has to be a way to cut some of the butter used and as for the prosecco, it was an expensive 3/4 cup for no really discernable flavor. I'm not sure if I will attempt this or not again. There are better and far easier recipes for scallops out there.

This is a beautifully elegant recipe. I haven't made seafood for quite a while, and this was a perfect re-introduction to the genre. It's fairly simple, with a small number of ingredients, yet looks lovely on the plate and would be perfect as part of a romantic dinner or a fancy dinner party.
