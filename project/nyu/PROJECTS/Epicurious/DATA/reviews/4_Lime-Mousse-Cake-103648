This was easy to make and absolutely delicious, but I agree with the reviewers who say it is very, very rich. Maybe it was because I *almost* overbeat my whipping cream? I'll be more careful this weekend when I make it again. Still giving 4 forks for ease and flavor. I did use 12 TAB of Limmi brand lime juice because it was all that was available, and it was fresh and the perfect sweet-tart balance.

Continuing on my review below: I tried another reviewer's suggestion of Italian amaretto cookies and they just didn't hold up. The flavor was good but they don't bind and they fall apart. If you still want to try them yourself, don't add the additional sugar.

Lovely taste and pretty - light cheesecake/mousse.Added more juice and more grated lime. Stir the gelatin into the lime juice. My 9" spring form pan left a lot of remaining filling. Could make extra crust for another use with extra filling. My chocolate came in 4 oz. bars and 2 of these would have been enough. Grated lime on top. Some shaved white chocolate would be nice also.

I made this cake once before, and decided to experiment with individual servings for a cookout this weekend. I made the original lime recipe, and also made a batch with clementines and a chocolate crust (Nabisco Famous Wafers). I made them in foil cupcake papers. The recipe made 24 of each flavor with enough left to keep a small bowl of each for myself to enjoy later. I added two drops of food coloring to each to give it a hint of color, and garnished each "cupcake" with a mini jellied fruit slice (orange and lime). Everyone raved and they disappeared quickly. The only caution is that it was necessary to eat these with a spoon directly out of the foil wrappers as they are a softer consistency. This recipe is definitely a keeper and can be adapted to many different fruit and crust combinations.

After reading all the reviews I had to try this and I was very happy I did. I made it for a July fourth bbq and everyone loved it. I added two extra TBS of lime juice to the filling and followed the instructions as written and it was fabulous. The best thing was not having to turn on the oven on a very hot day. It was simple to make and must be made the day before serving.

I have made this dessert numerous times with great reviews from my guests. However, the last time I made it I mistakenly used Italian amaretti cookies instead of gingersnaps and people were ranting and raving about the crust. They loved the filling as well but were especially focused on the crust. You can't go wrong with this dessert. It is easy to make and absolutely delicious! Outstanding in fact!

After returning from New Year's in Key West I was looking for a 4Star dessert as an extra tip for our pet sitters. THIS IS IT. Importantly the lime juice and zest must be increased. For us doubling wasn't quite enough. Look at the juice-to-cream ratio in the KeyLimeMousse recipe on this site and/or taste the batter...the lime flavor will be milder in the chill dessert than it is in the batter. Also I cut the tiny limes in half and squeezed them with pliers. Trimming the fruit bits hanging out of the squeezed lime and adding it into the batter. I baked the crust for 10 min at 350 and doubled the gelatin to ensure the mousse was firm. [1 envelope gelatin= 1T so I used 2T.] The mousse was firm but not 'rubbery.' My only complaint: this dessert is straight calories! yet it tastes light, creamy, wonderful...

I much prefer the Margarita cheesecake on this site, even after doctoring this recipe up with the added lime zest and juice and decreasing the whipping cream as recommended by others. The lime flavor "carries" much better in the cheesecake. Mainly its a consistency preference. To me the addition of the cream weakens the overall recipe. Go with the cheesecake folks!

This recipe is the same as the Lime Mousse Cake from Tate's Bake Shop cookbook. Tate's uses sugar cookies with crystalized ginger instead of snaps. It's a good substitute if you don't like too much ginger. Tate's Bake Shop cookbook also has many great desserts like this.

Awesome! I've made it twice now. The second time took half the time... I bought Ghirardelli white choc chips and got rid of chocolate chopping time. I doubled juice and zest both times... super yum. Cut back the whipped cream from 2 cups to 1 1/2 cups the second time 'cos I was short on cream... and preferred it! Mmm... really, once you get the hang of it, an easy cake with SPECTACULAR results. Restaurant grade. :)

I've been making this recipe for years and think it is outstanding. I've made it with the gingersnap crust as written and it's delicious. I do double the lime juice, add zest, and make a crust out of graham crackers, macadamia nuts and coconut for a variation that my family really loves. I garnish it with whipped cream and toasted coconut. I also don't add the full amount of whipped cream any more because I like the texture of the cake with a little less cream. The recipe as written is fantastic, I just changed the crust because some of my relatives don't care for ginger.

All I can say is Awesome!!! This was too simple. I was afraid that it would stick to the springform pan. Nop, ...so perfect. My husband is not a fan of citrus dessert, but this he liked. The white chocolate makes it less acidic, I guess. We had 6 others try it and all loved it. The entire 10" cake is gone.

I have made this twice in a month to rave reviews. I used shortbread cookies for the crust and I increased lime juice to 1/2 cup and added more zest per other reviewers. Piped whipped cream around the top and sprinkled it with more lime peel. Really delicious and very light. Since my spring form pan is only 9 inches, I had enough filling leftover for two small, 4 inch tart pans.

Since this recipe was originally published in 2000, I have made it each year for a friend's annual July 4th party. It comes out perfectly each time and is delicious. Although it isn't difficult to make, some folks may find it a bit labor intensive. But it's worth it!

perfect summer dessert. This not a light mousse cake with the cream cheese added to it so just be aware. I've been experimenting with it adding more whipping cream and cutting back on the cream cheese for a lighter mousse texture and it turns out great every time. Since I'm adding more whipping cream I have added more gelatin to help stabilize the mousse. I have increased the lime for a stronger lime flavour. This is one dessert that always get great reviews and is perfect for summer since there is no baking involved. It's a very forgiving recipe with the minor changes, the dessert always turns out perfectly out of the pan.

Rating: 3
I disagree that this is rich - it is smooth, creamy, light and delicious. It is the perfect ending to a meal because it's not too sweet and the tartness makes it light on the palate. I have made it a couple of times, always with double fresh lime juice. It is also good to make on its own and serve in parfaits without the crust for an even lighter dessert. The quantity of filling could be reduced by 25% or up to 1/3 and still fill a 10" springform. I decorated with key lime rounds and white chocolate shavings and it was a delightful spring finish. P.S. One time I used sugar-free lime jello in place of the plain gelatin and reduced sugar by half and it was still authentic tasting.

Rating: 4
What a fantastic dessert! Thanks to all the suggestions re lime flavor: I used 1/2 cup juice and the zest of 3 limes, it was perfectly balanced w/the rich cream cheese and white chocolate (3 3.5 oz. bars Lindt). For a Christmas party, chocolate seemed a better crust (it's very striking w/the pale green filling): one pkg Newman's chocolate wafers, 1/2 cup butter, and a spoonful of sugar. Baked it for a few minutes prior to filling, it held together beautifully. Cake filled a 10-inch springform to the brim. Garnished w/sugared lime slices. It was a huge hit, totally impressive and easy to make. Has to be done ahead, so perfect for the holidays.

Here's the thing about this "cake" - it is extremely rich. Like the kind of cake you should only take a wee little piece of. If you take more, you will get a little sick of it before long. I made it for Thanksgiving (as my neighbor gave me some limes from their tree) and we still have half the cake and it's Monday. WHY? Because it is so freaking rich. I would recommend this dessert for a large crown, or where there are no other choices, because it is delicious. But with so many offerings at Thanksgiving, no one wanted it. I won't make it again because it is just TOO rich.

Great recipe and minimum effort. I liken this to a cheesecake as opposed to a mousse cake. It definitely was rather dense. I added 10 teaspoons of lime juice for a tangy flavour to take away the richness of the cake. And I also increased the lime zest to 2 for a bit of a bite. Overall - Yummy.

I have never written a review here before but after making this fantastic mousse cake I decided I needed to. It was a HUGE success for my St. Patrick's dinner. Next time I will try a chocolate crust.

This was really delicious! Per the suggestions, I doubled the lime juice and zest. In the future, I might even triple the juice for more tanginess. However, with double the zest, the white chocolate is able to come through nicely and balance the lime flavors. Made this with the gingersnap crust (added some chopped crystallized ginger). I also baked the crust briefly so that it was crispier, and felt that that complimented the light, creaminess of the filling well. This is a very tasty dessert, deceptively light, and both sweet and tangy. Highly recommended (with the added lime!).

This tastes like a cheesecake. Really easy, I agree with another person about too much filling. You can easily cut filling in half and it will be a normal size cheesecake, otherwise it is literally enough for 25 people. Very rich, do add more lime juice and lime zest, it makes a difference.

Delicious cake, very light. I increased the lime juice to 8 T. and the lime zest to 2 T., but next time I'll either double the lime juice or add a layer of lime curd to the top, and then a layer of whipped cream.

Delicious. The extra lime juice and zest made the lime taste pronounced but not too tart. I used 3 regular limes but next time will try and get key limes just to see if there is a difference. I will also reduce the filling ingredients by about 1/4 to 1/3 since using the quantities in the recipe made the cake too domed in the middle for my liking.

I followed the suggestion of others, and used 12 tbs. of Nellie and Joe's key lime juice. I only used one tbs. of lime zest, because I didn't buy enough key limes from the store to use 3 tbs. like ohters suggested. Next time I'll use more zest which would make it even better. You must add extra juice. I think the lime flavor would be lost without it. I also made a pecan shortbread crust. Yum!

A delight that is to die for! I brought this in to the office for a fundraiser. One person after tasting it just about moaned! I used about 10 tbsp of key lime juice and 2 tbsp of lime zest. For the crust, as I have no food processor, I ground the cookies fine in my mini-chopper, then put the crumbs in a bowl and whisked in two tbsp of caster sugar before adding the melted butter. It is really a cheesecake, rather than a mousse, but it is the lightest, most ethereal cheesecake I've ever had. A taste sensation with minimal labour - who could ask for anything more?

Should get *5 forks*. After reading all the positive reviews, I took a chance and made a double recipe. I had a hard time finding a bowl big enough to handle all that mousse, but it was certainly worth the extra effort.

My older brother discovered this recipe 2 years ago and began making it for family gatherings. It became his specialty, his secret recipe. Because of the outstanding taste we all assumed that it was very complicated to produce. Well, my brother now lives out of the country and I decided, nervously, to make this cake for our next family party. Imagine my suprise when I discovered how simple it really is! I was able to whip this up while baking several other things, and as usual the taste was to die for. When all the aunts gathered around telling me what a good cook I was and exclaiming over the time I must have spent producing this masterpiece, I followed my brothers lead. I did absolutely nothing to disillusion them. Try this recipe, you'll love it.

My boyfriend hates cheesecake, but is disturbingly in love with a pie that consists of nothing but Cool Whip mixed with a dissolved package of lime Jello. Yuck. I thought this would be a step up. I can't say he enjoyed this, but I loved it! If you're looking for an alternative to classic cheesecake and its tendency to become laborious eating after a few bites, especially after a satisfying meal, then this variation is just right. It would be easy to play with flavors and crusts to make other outstanding cakes.

Just signed on and haven't made this yet, but a comment about the crust jiggled my memory. I often make key lime pie (we cater), and when I made it with a prebaked crust (per Best Recipe cookbook), I rolled the crust in graham cracker crumbs instead of flour. The guests thought it was marvelous. Since we live and work in the desert, I don't always do this...it's often too hot to bother with a regular crust. But try it out. It might be what a key lime pie (or any relative of one) really needs.

I made this for a gathering and everyone raved. In reading the ingredients, I decided to try to lighten it up a bit by using low-fat Cool Whip instead of whipping cream, and also replaced 2 regular cream cheese packages with 1/3 fat versions. Nice creamy texture, good lime flavor (regular limes were the only ones available) and the crust was a nice compliment. Will make this again for sure!!

This is my favorite dessert. The creamy, cool sweetness of the mousse, combined with the tart lime, is an excellent foil to a spicy, light meal (ie. grilled mahi-mahi with fresh pico-de-gallo).Because this dessert is very rich do not serve after a high fat meal. Be sure to plan ahead.

This was not my favorite. Wasn't embarrassed to bring it to the dinner party I prepared it for, and everyone seemed to like it, but it wasn't what I'd had in mind. I found the texture too fluffy, kind of expanding-in-your-mouth . . . I did double the lime juice and lime zest, but I personally would have enjoyed far more a dense cheesecake to this.

This is more like a fluffy cheesecake than a cake. I agree with the other reviewers who suggest doubling the lime juice and zest. It is better the second day when the flavors have had a chance to set up. Unlike some other reviewers, I thought this was easy and that the gingersnap crust (which would also be great under pumpkin cheesecake) was perfect.

Always receives lots of praise. Doubled the lime juice and zest as has been suggested. Makes a great summer desert as it seems light. The "cook now living in Germany" made one of my favorite comments on this site. "I ate it myself in four days". Now that's praise. Good manners dictate that guests praise your efforts, but his(her) comment is a true measure of this recipe. I guess I won't get to meet the cook while doing a marathon however.

I've made this for two parties and everyone has loved it. The bonus is that it doesn't require any oven space, so the oven is freed up for other things. Especially liked the crust, much tastier than a typical graham cracker cookie crust.

I found this dish pretty easy to make. I also made the crust with shortbread and pistachios instead of graham or gingersnap. It was an instant hit.

As everyone before me has indicated, this really is a luscious dessert, one I doubt any fine restaurant would not hesitate to include on its menu. And yes, you must increase the lime juice or the citrus taste is much too subtle, although still very good. The one thing no one before me has mentioned, probably because it's such a no-no for authentic key lime pie, is I add 4-5 drops of green food coloring into the cream cheese mixture just before I add the whipped cream. I know, you're thinking "she's mad!" but I like a lime dessert to look like one, and this tints it the palest green, just enough to hint at the flavor. I think next time I too will do a plain graham cracker crust, while the gingersnap is good, its flavor is too distinct on its own, I'd rather taste the lime and have the crust just be a background flavor. It's neither cheap nor low calorie, but please try this!

Yummy! We didn't like the gingersnap crust, and next time made it with a crust made of a 6.5 oz jar macadamia nuts, 1/2 c graham cracker crumbs, 2 T sugar, and 3 T butter, done in the food processor and baked as directed. Also used more lime. Delicious!

I, too, used more lime zest than the recipe called for to give it a good lime taste. I did not care for the gingersnap crust, next time will use a sugar cookie or graham cracker crust. Very light texture. Good summer dessert. Cool, creamy and light.

Wonderful cake with a very light texture. Tastes much like a light cheesecake. Very easy and takes very little time to make. Can be made ahead which is convenient. Most importantly though, is that this cake tastes incredible!!

I have made this twice. First time did not gingersnaps were not ground fine enough and wasn't as tart as hoped. Second time, perfect! Added more lime juice and rind. Texture, taste - perfect. Garnished with lime twist, mint, strawberries and raspberries. Very delicious and beautiful.

This is a very simple cake to make. Yet it is super good. Every time I make it people keep asking me to make it again. The best cake, cheesecake, lime dessert I have ever had. And YOU MUST DOUBLE THE LIME AND ZEST.

I've made this twice the past month, both for special occasions. For cheesecake it was nice and light, however even though I doubled the lime it could still use more flavor. Does anyone know if you add 5-6 tablespoons of extra lime should you eliminate liquid from another area in the recipe?

The minute the first slice of this cake was cut it seemed to disappear from the serving platter! I even had a relative ask me to make it for a party that she was attending! I look forward to making this again!

This cake was easy and delicious. I made it for several parties Chhristmas time when time was of the essence. I also doubled the lime juice and zest. To make it seasonal, I added fresh raspberries on top and garnished with mint leaves. It got rave reviews!

This is a wonderfully easy and impressive cake to make. I've made it twice and everyone loves it, especially after a rich meal. Increasing the zest and the key lime juice just adds to the flavor.

I used the others suggestions of doubling the key lime juice and zest, and used 2 pkg. of reg cream cheese and one of low-fat. Turned out great.

Fabulous....This was relatively easy to make and a big hit! I agree that I would increase the amount of lime zest. Remove the cake from the fridge about 20 min prior to serving, the taste really improves as it gets closer to room temp.

I made this recently and followed the advice of those who said to double the key lime juice and the lime zest, and it was wonderful! Other deviations from the original recipe: I used a 9" springform pan and that worked out fine; I only used 1 tablespoon of sugar in the crust; and I used 2 pkgs of low fat cream cheese and one pkg of regular. Everyone who tasted it loved it! Will definitely make again.

This was great! I added a little more lime juice and zest. The gingersnap crust was very good with the lime flavor. Will definitely make again.

I made this last night to follow an end-of-summer lobster dinner party. Fabulous! Everyone loved it and it was a perfect choice to follow the lobster - although the chocolate, cream cheese and whipped cream make this anything but "light" calorie wise, it tastes cool and light. I agree I will add additional lime juice and zest next time - but that's just a personal preference - it was certainly wonderful this way. I finished it off by sprinking additional ginger snap crumbs on top, and twists of sliced lime. A keeper!

Wonderfull could begin to describe this. And I've not even cut into it yet, just licked the bowl. The amount of flavoring is good to start with, but I do agree that next time I will add a little more lime to it.

I made this cake twice. The first time it was delicious, but I felt like it was missing something. It wasn't as tart as I would have liked for a lime cake, still very good, but it needed some more "tangyness". The second time I made this I doubled the lime juice and it was much better. I could have doubled the zest as well and maybe even a little more juice. I like to have some tartness when i make a anything lime. I got many requests for the recipe and even my co-workers said it could use a little more lime. This is perfect for the summer and I will definitly make this again. You cannot be on a diet with this one!!!

I split this recipe up between 6 individual spring form pans. To plate, I put a dolop of whipped cream, two slivers of lime and some lime zest. It was fantastic, and got raves. I am making it again tonight - think I will add more keylime juice and zest for more zing.

This dessert is a 10+. I made it for a wedding shower. It was one of the three I made for this event. I "iced" the cake in stabalized whipping cream. It was beautiful. It sat at room temperature (cool room) for about two hours. It was a little less "stable" than the other two desserts. I think I would add 1/2 pkg of gelatin and use cold water instead of the lime juice. Then I would heat the gelatin until melted. I would add the gelatin and lime juice to the melted chocolate. Better would be to "cook" the gelatin mixture with the heated cream but I don't know if it would work. So, the best thing would be to serve the cake when it is still very cool, so it is easy to serve and nice and firm. I would like to make this cake with a raspberry filling. My sister likes raspberry so she may try it. I would do this again for a shower. It's perfect.

I made this recipe with fresh lemons rather than limes and it was delicious!! It was more like a cheesecake than a mousse cake...but whatever you call it, it was great!!

Absolutely lucious. We had this with a spicy mexican meal and it was the perfect ending. Will definitely make again.
