As another cook did, I used Talapia -more traditional. I love the sauce on both fish and spinach, or kale.

Instead of the tahini sauce in the recipe, I used a yogurt tahini recipe from Deborah madison: 1 cup yogurt (I used greek yogurt), 2 tb tahini, juice and zest of 1 lemon, 1 garlic clove (I usually add a bit of olive oil and, if needed, a touch of warm water since it is so thick). I then make the fish, although I dust it with a mixture of flour, cumin and coriander. Top with the sauce and some finely chopped parsley, and it's pretty quick and easy. (fyi, I tend to make this sauce and just keep it in the frig--it's good with chicken, roasted veggies, sandwiches, etc)

Agree with previous reviewer; sauce was bitter, thin and otherwise tasteless. Wound up pouring out the sauce and just pan sauteing the catfish with a blend of spices. Normally I agree with majority of reviewers; maybe the brand/type of Tahini???

What was this reciipe . . . this is the first time I have given an exceptionally bad review to any recipe. I followed it as written. It was tasteless, bitter, unexceptional. Don't waste "even" catfish on this one!

We eat a lot of catfish in many variations, and this one rated right up there with the best! I didn't have coriander seeds, so I just sprinkled the fish with ground coriander before cooking. Quick and easy, and the sauce is terrific.

I only made the dressing and I put it on veggies . i used lime and lemon. This was GREAT!

We've made this sauce a few times. It's great with a seemingly endless number of dishes. The crushed/fried coriander seeds are also an excellent touch...new to us and we'll use that idea again and again I'm sure.

The sauce is tasty and versatile.

I made this with tilapia fillets over a bed of fresh baby spinach and raw white onion. The raw onion accents the tahini sauce superbly. Served raw quartered apples on the side and a mound of sticky rice cooked with a little orange juice and roasted pistachios. This turned out to be a great combination, I thought.

Thanks to previous reviewers, I doubled the lemon and garlic in the sauce. Loved the sauce. I just used ground coriander instead of the seeds. I'd do this again, but most likely with tilapia instead of catfish, which I find kind of grisley (?) sometimes.

First time using tahini. Followed the recipe as written. Didn't like it that well. I asked my wife if it was a do over and she said no. It does make a nice presentation. Maybe it was the cook, the tahini, or just our taste buds.

Very flavorful! I loved this recipe and so did my husband. It was a little oily for our taste, so I may cut down the oil next time, but otherwise found the mix of tastes and smells perfect.

My wife rated this a two, but was not sure what flavor it was that she found strange. This is really good recipe with a very nice presentation. I did add four times the garlic, but my wife is used to that routine.

So quick and delicious! I didn't use a blender, just a whisk to mix the sauce ingredients. Served it with rice with cinnamon, almonds and raisins - great!

I have not made this recipe, but thought I'd share an authentic lebanese version of tahini fish sauce (called Taratour). Pound several cloves garlic w/ mortar and a bit of salt, slowly pour in olive oil. chop paresley fine. Stir tahini and parseley into olive oil-garlic paste. this is very good, especially with barbequed fish, though the raw garlic may be too strong for some

Very nice, very different. I followed the recipe exactly and it was very flavorful, a definite keeper. I blended the leftover sauce with a can of garbanzo beans for a hummus appetizer the next night.

Excellent dish. I used tilipia instead of catfish. I used a little more lemon and garlic. Otherwise the sauce would have been very bland. My wife was amazed at how little time it took to prepare.

i thought this was delicious. i used a bit more lemon juice and a bit less tahini, and cooked the catfish a bit longer than suggested. we had it with some mixed greens and kalamata olives.

The tahini sauce is a new twist for me. I liked it. I agree that you don't want all of it to serve with the catfish, but that is what pita bread is for. I will definitely make this again

very nice. i used the sauce as an accent. if you use it all it would be very overpowering. sweat some fresh spinach and you have a nice entree.

I loved this recipie!!!! (Although I'm not a big cumin fan so I left that out.)

When making the tahini, use at leat 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup white vinegar. Add 1/2 tsp cumin. Drench the fish (also talipa fillets) in flour mixed with cumin, salt and pepper.) The tahini should not be thicker than syrup. If it is, add water one tablespoon at a time.

Cannot recommend this recipe. The tahini sauce is too strong a falvor for catfish. If you do make this, be careful making the tahini sauce. The longer it is processed, the thicker it will become.

Tasty.
