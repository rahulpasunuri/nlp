1 fork seems harsh to me, but Epicurious says that signifies "okay", which is how I feel about these. I much prefer Epi's Whole Wheat Pancakes w Blackberry Syrup, which also use whole wheat flour and cornmeal. Those require buttermilk, which I never have, but I just sub in milk mixed with plain yogurt. These, made as written, were quite flavorless in my book, even with syrup and blueberries. And I'm a big whole grains fan, I find I can enjoy many other versions plain.

I think you need a taste for whole grains to enjoy these! I happen to love them. I use polenta because I like the crunch from the coarse corn meal. I also use different flours such as almond meal and rice flour instead of the white and whole wheat. This is a nice basic recipe that lends itself well to substitutions. (I also add extra sugar.)

Wow, I loved these! I added the vanilla and added less salt because I had salted butter. Served with strawberry syrup.

This was a good, easy, and quick pancake recipe. I liked it and would def. make it again. I served it with raspberry sauce. Yum!

This is a great recipe! I make it quite often, using oats as suggested below. Yum! I also thought that the recipe as-is was a bit salty, so I cut the salt in half and it is perfect. I'll have to try it next time with brown sugar and/or vanilla. Sounds good!

These are wonderful! I took the suggestion of adding a splash of vanilla and I think it brought out the smoky sweetness of the cornmeal. I'll definitely make these again (and again and again!).

These pancakes were fantastic - light, fluffy flavourable. I had to make a few substitutions (semolina instead of cornmeal and plain rice milk instead of regular milk) - perhaps that's what made them great!

these were awful - flat, tasted like cardboard. I couldn't make any of the other recipes off the epicurious site because I didn't have all the ingredients....now I know you really need those things!

I was looking for a more healthy version of pancakes when i came across this recipe. I thought it was dense but tasted great. One small change, i added a touch of vanilla extract to it. I will definitely make these again.

Though edible, this is hardly a treat. Just made a batch (makes 8, not 16, incidentally), and followed previous suggestions to use oats in place of white flour. I would also suggest, in retrospect, using brown sugar for white sugar, and thinning the batter somewhat, probably with butter.

I really didn't like these. I added the oats as suggested, but they were fairly tasteless and boring. Not worth the effort.

It was excellent..my husband loved it. I also substituted quick oats for he white flour and I used skim milk. I reduced the calories without sacrificing the taste. A wonderful low-fat pancake that can be prepared in under 20 minutes. Thanks...

This is a guy kind of thing. My husband and sons, ages 11 and 14, thought it was great. I thought it was o.k., very filling but not a real heavy taste

This was winner! I followed the advice from your previous correspondent to use oats, and the result was delicious! Light, fluffy and tasty. I even used wheat-free flour (as I am wheat intolerant) which worked perfectly. A real find and the perfect partner to bacon for brunch. Had run out of maple syrup, so served the pancakes with runny honey instead which went surprisingly well. I'd like to give this 5 forks!

Not your average pancake! We substitued quick oats for the white flour for a nuttier flavor. The corn meal is essential and sweet. Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious and easy to make (took a lot less time than 45 minutes)......have already made them three times! YUM.
