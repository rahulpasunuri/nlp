Excellent, especially for a same-day red cabbage recipe. I did caramelize 1/3 of a red onion in a dry skillet after browning and draining bacon grease. Also followed suggestions of cooking cabbage 15 minutes. The whole family enjoyed this recipe.

A good, inexpensive addition to a weeknight meal. Easy to make and tasty. I find myself craving these flavors every fall.

Ho, hum. It's okay, but I would have to adapt it so much to be more to my taste that it wouldn't be the same recipe. When I read it, I thought, "No onions? How can you make red cabbage with no onions?" In my humble opinion, you can't! So the first thing I would do is add caramelized red onions. Yes, it needs more vinegar. Well, I'm stopping there. Not my favorite recipe, but it might be yours. Viva la difference!!

Excellent! We added the goat cheese.

Easy and tasty, and a colorful side to roast pork. Agree with the reviewer who simmered longer to make the cabbage more tender.

For a great meal serve this with the Sauerkraut Cakes and Kielbasa recipe also on Epicurious. My guy and I love this recipe, though I use 1/3 the bacon and a lower-fat crisco-type product rather than bacon fat. Also, I like my cabbage a little more wilted than this recipe accommodates, so I cover and let simmer an extra 15 minutes.

Quick & easy with all the flavors of the original dish in much less time. I will definitely be making this again when I do German food or some pork dishes.

An easy do-ahead dish (wilt the cabbage in the bacon grease, add the vinegar, etc. and set aside; do the final 5 minute braising just before serving). I served this as a side to pork in calvados sauce.

Great rotkraut!! I tried this recipe when I'd tired of my usual, time-consuming red cabbage recipe. This dish is terrific, quick and yummy.

Yum! Easy and tasty - who could ask for more! I took the suggestion from another red cabbage recipe on this site and added goat cheese before serving...great contrast of flavors and textures-try it.

this was delicious , although I used green cabbage as I had no red and subsituted the bacon for lowfat chicken sausages

Having a German background, my family and I enjoyed the red cabbage.
