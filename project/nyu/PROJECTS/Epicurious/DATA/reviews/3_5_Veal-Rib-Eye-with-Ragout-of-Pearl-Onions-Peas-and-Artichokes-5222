This recipe is excellent! I actually make it on a regular basis with Pork Tenderloin steaks or Pork Chops and that variation is delicious. I often haven't planned ahead for the overnight/mixture step, so I simply sauté the meat in olive oil, sprinkling it with minced rosemary and seasoning with salt and pepper. I deglaze the skillet with white wine and use the same skillet for the Ragout. The Ragout is fabulous, but I do make these changes: I use canned artichoke hearts and about 2 seeded/chopped tomatoes. Most importantly, we think it is so much better with 4T of cream added in the last step instead of the 4T butter. This is a delicious recipe, it is quite simple to prepare and is always a crowd pleaser. Most certainly try it!
