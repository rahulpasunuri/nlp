I omitted the sausage and used spinach and cherry tomatoes. Very good.

This is a quick-fix meal that I have made 10+ times since finding the recipe, definitely a go-to recipe for me. Some reviewers have made some strange substitutions, which would change the flavor profile and texture completely; I recommend sticking with the original recipe and just adding one or two Mediterranean ingredients, such as chopped sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives or roasted red peppers, which enhance both flavor and color. I really enjoy the top crunchy pasta layer that creates a wonderful texture similar to pegao or tah-dig, so I tend to bake it in a shallow dish to increase the surface area. Its definitely not the most gourmet recipe, but if youre in a hurry and have quality ingredients on hand, its great.

This is very good, but not quite delicious. I followed the recipe for the most part - using spicy sausage and adding crushed red pepper to the broccoli rabe, mushrooms, and tomatoes. I also made sure to season the eggs and used about a 1/2 cup total of parmasan and romano cheeses instead of fontina. I'll probably make this again, but it won't be a go to recipe

I'm really not sure why I made this (it seemed fun), but this is a recipe straight out of home ec. Not good and I won't make again.

My vegetarian version was really delicious. The key is seasoning it enough. Taste it to make sure there is enough salt. I used 4 eggs and 1 cup ricotta. Cheeses were feta and mozarella. Veggies were sund dried tomatoes, mushrooms and garlic. Topped it with kalamata olive halves, pine nuts, parmesan, and a drizzle of olive oil. Fresh herbs added alot of flavor.

This is a favorite, but this time I used rainbow swiss chard instead of broccoli, and I like it even more now. I sauteed the chopped stems, then added garlic, then leaves, then chopped it all while sausage cooked. Labor intensive, but great flavor!

This was delicious, creamy, comforting dish. This is one of those recipes that can be changed in a million different ways depending on what you have on hand or what's on sale at the market. I substituted brocolini for the rabe and used hot sausage. It made for a wonderful, light (light-tasting, not low-fat) Sunday dinner to watch the closing ceremonies of the Olympics.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. The picture looks a lot better than it tastes. I made a few changes of my own, I used chicken instead of sausage and frozen broccoli for the broccoli rabe, I used linguine instead of spaghetti and shredded monterey jack instead of cubed. I also cooked it in a a pie plate and it took a lot longer than 25 minutes. Did anyone else find that that 8 eggs was way too much. The pie was very heavy and I don't mean on your stomach kind, I'm talking about heavy like a brick. I can tell you I will not be making this again, but if I did here's what I'd do differently with the egg mixture, use only 4-5 eggs and I cup of milk, half & half or heavy cream, like a quiche. the custard will be a lot lighter and fluffier and that is what I should have done in the first place.

Wonderful recipe, I substituted angel hair pasta and used broccolini instead of broccoli rabe. Turned out wonderfully.

This is a huge comfort dish for me--I'm glad to eat a few days of leftovers. I'm not a broccoli rabe fan, so use reg.broccoli instead--just zap it for 3 minutes before incorporating with ingredients. I can see how some would think it boring, but I'm not a spice girl. It's an easy dish to zest up however you see fit!

Great to make out of leftovers. Easy, I added a lot of salt, pepper and red pepper flakes and doubled the garlic. Also doubled the cheese and used spicy Italian sausage that I already had. I bet that asparagus would be great in this dish too!

Previous reviewers had it right, bland and boring. I added more of everything, including some salt, pepper, oregano, and red pepper flake, and it still ended up tasting of very little except pasta and egg. Perhaps hot sausage would help, and then saute the broccoli briefly in the drippings, add onion and lots of garlic, then pour the whole mess into a bowl with pasta and eggs, then season liberally again. Also, I tried to make mine in the morning and the egg mixture sank to the bottom, so although all the components can be made ahead, don't try putting it together before you are ready to cook.

I made this for my family & we all hated it. It was bland, boring & bitter. Will not make this again!

Have been making this since it first appeared in Gourmet. Since I cut back on fat whenever possible, I use chicken sausage which is just as wonderful as other types of sausages. Wonderful recipe!

Yummy, quick and easy! After reading the reviews I made the following changes: I doubled the sliced garlic and sauteed it along with a chopped onion in olive oil. Then added the sausage to the pan. I then added the broccoli rabe directly into the pan without precooking. I had Fontinella handy and also sprayed a glass deep dish pie plate with Pam and baked 30 minutes (I had jumbo eggs available and they called for more cooking time). The spice of the hot sausage and flavors of the broccoli rabe and Fontinella were all well blended. My Italian mother loved this dish. I might try to use individual serving sized pans next time for an interesting presentation.

i added a bunch of different cheeses I had laying around, but predominately pecorino and REALLY good quality fontina and it turned out perfectly. Also, I used a glass pie pan and it didn't stick at all. My husband loved it.

This dish worked nicely as a side dish. It got rave reviews from my highly critical guests. I used linguine instead of thin spagetti.

really bland! no spice to it at all.

Made it in a pie plate as someone suggested with good results - - I will try linguine next time, I think flat pasta would work even better.

I found this recipe to be very bland and uninteresting. I used spinach instead of the rabe.It was so boring that I threw most of it out.

Rating: 3
Very good variation on the frattata, but I'll cook the vegetable much less than 5 minutes next time: it was too mushy by the time I got to the saute step. Don't be tempted to use more pasta than called for in the recipe, or you'll miss the other flavors.

Really liked this pie! I used some shredded monterey jack cheese and some mozzarella that I had on hand and it was good. Used crushed garlic in a jar and used angel hair instead of spaghetti. Also used one yolk and 8 whites instead of 8 whole eggs. Assembled pie in the afternoon and refrigerated for 3 or so hours, then baked at dinner time. I think I would spray a pie plate and bake it in that instead of the skillet next time. It took me days to clean the pan. I will make it again.
