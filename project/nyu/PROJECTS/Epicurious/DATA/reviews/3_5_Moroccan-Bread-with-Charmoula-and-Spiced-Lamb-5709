It was good, but a bit dry. The Charmoula cooks into it, leaving the flavor but not the moisture. And it's not much lamb. For the moisture issue, I dipped it in seasoned olive oil. I think if I make it again I'll use 3/4 lb. lamb. The flavors were delicious, and the bread was very good (but not amazing).

I liked this dish, but I think next time I'll make the charmoula and marinate the lamb the night before to break up the work a bit. Found the spices to be just right- freshly ground cumin and coriander DO make a big difference, well worth the extra two minutes it takes to grind them w/a mortar and pestle. The bread was simple to prepare and provided a great backdrop for the toppings.

I used left-over grilled lamb and seasoned it with the cumin and allspice ( a subsitution for the coriander)and cilantro (a substituiton for parsley). It sat out while I made the delcious bread and flavorful charmoula. My children and husband love this 'pizza' with a salad as a side dish.

With the addition of 1 tsp allspice, 2 minced cloves of garlic, and double the amount of cumin and coriander, the lamb was sufficiently flavorful. I think that the original rub is too bland. This would be a truly simple recipe with ready made pizza crust or store bought flat bread.
