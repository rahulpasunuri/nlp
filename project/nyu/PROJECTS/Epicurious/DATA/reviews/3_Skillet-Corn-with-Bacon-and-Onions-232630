This is a nice side dish.

I have been making this for decades; got the recipe from my Kentucky born and raised grandmother. Fried corn is one of my favorite things about summer. I sometimes like to add diced red and green bell peppers when I am sauteeing the onion.

Wow - this is what I remember as "special corn". I feel the need to defend this dish. I too love fresh corn on the cob - warm from the fields and boiled for about 3 minutes and it's good. But that's not this dish. If you've never had southern "fried corn" don't knock it til you've tried it. Made with fresh corn - as directed - you'll find this isn't mushy and the kernels pop in your mouth - even when cooked for 10-15 minutes. This is a fantastic side dish. If you don't milk the cob (scrape all the goodies off after you slice the corn) you're missing all the stuff that carmelizes at the bottom. I was happy to introduce my son to real fried corn tonight. It was as good as I remembered.

Delish! Do it! Re. cooking time: why worry about what the recipe sez? Just taste a kernel. Re. this recipe being too "involved": EGADS! I must be some kinda sicko. I thought this recipe was super-easy and super-quick to make!!!

Great recipe. I did use frozen corn but used very little water. I kept the corn, onion, garlic and bacon mixture in a warm oven on a cookie sheet while finishing the rest of the menu. I added the chopped scallions before serving. The result was wonderfully flavorful and not mushy.

Followed recipe exactly, tasted great.

Excellent! For added heat, cut up a few jalapenos. Oh, and 10-15 nimutes isn't too long. Turn your heat down! My corn still "popped" and crunched. Everyone RAVED!

I too cut back on the garlic and onions, also did not have scallions on hand but did not miss them. I've never had this southern specialty, and my family loved it!

This is indeed (as one reviewer suggested) a redition of an old southern favorite called "fried corn." I remember it from my childhood, but hadn't attempted it for many years. I made only half the recipe. And I confess I cut back on the onion, used only a little bit of garlic, and added some chopped red bell pepper. I used a little butter to saute these items rather than using the bacon grease. And I also left out the water, and cooked the corn only about five minutes. (These choices were based on southern notions about what flavors best enhance fresh corn.) So, maybe I'm raving about my own recipe rather than this one. But the results were fantastic, and I appreciate the inspiration provided by the original.

I make a variation of the recipe also called Country Fried Corn. No garlic or water either. I freeze my own corn and its still is good. I would NOT recommend store bought frozen corn the taste is not as sweet and much more chewy as the store bought frozen corn's kernels I feel are more mature that the home grown corn.

For those that don't like onions, use a red or green bell pepper diced extremely fine. Like 1/4 inch pieces. I like fresh corn but I tried it with frozen and it worked just as nicely.

To those of you who didn't make this but rated it anyway, or wrote twice and rated it each time, do you realize how badly you skewed the results??? This feature is for people who have MADE the recipe to review it. Please make it, then when you're qualified to rate it, do so. I did make it, and I loved it. I did cook the corn less than it said - not because someone here told me to, but because I tested it as I went along and did it according to my taste. My husband liked this a lot, too. And gee - he actually ate it. He didn't comment on it without trying it first ...

There was a much better recipe for Sauteed Corn with Bacon and Scallions published in the August 1993 issue of Gourmet which we still make regularly. I'd like to see that posted.

Other than the pain of shucking all that corn, this recipe was great. Not difficult to make and leftovers are perfect for lunches. I substituted sweet onion for scallion as that's what I had. Other than that, made as directed, including cooking time, and it was not overdone. I would cut back on the water a bit next time, or even use broth, but turned out very good. Also will try good quality frozen or canned corn, as shucking really is not fun.

I have to admit to not actually making this recipe yet, but when I read that you cook the corn kernels for 10 to 15 minutes, I reacted by thinking, "It will be too overdone." (I steam cobs of fresh corn for about 3 minutes.) I think I will try adapting it by removing the water, adding lots of freshly cracked pepper, and only cooking the corn, covered, for about 3 minutes maximum, stirring if necessary to prevent sticking.

I usually cook for two - the kids and grandkids bring it up to 8; the recipe assumes large ears of corn and restaurant type portion control. Shucking the corn is a pain.I will try this again with top quality frozen corn (has worked on other recipes) and would suggest this to the reader from Visalia, CA

I took this dish to a potluck as a side dish. Considering the amount of work that went into it, it was pretty mediocre. Just eat the corn on the cob. I won't be making this again.

I didn't want to wait until I went to the Farmers' Market on Saturday so I made it with frozen corn, which worked great. Love corn, love bacon, love onions; so what's not to love? I'll definitely make it again.

My version is also a bit different. I use no water or garlic. Instead I add a half cup of half and half to finish it off and add shitake mushrooms (diced and cooked in the bacon fat).

To the cook in Bellevue, WA. Don't use frozen or canned corn. Only FRESH corn on the cob will do. Also, I do not recommend this recipe. Not good. Try my version of fried corn and bacon. You will be hooked on it from here on.

This was a fantastic dish; I even used the bulk bacon pcs to make it. The second time I used leftover corn-on-the-cob and it was just as good. My family said that this would suffice as a meal by itself. The combination of the sweet fresh corn and the salty bacon, along with the texture of the green onions allowed this dish to cover all bases with us. Yummmy!

I agree, this recipe is too involved. I have been making "fried corn and bacon" for years. Eliminate the water! I do not use garlic. My recipe is as follows: 6 ears of fresh Silver Queen (white) corn. 1 medium to large onion. 3 to 4 slices bacon (thick cut). Cut bacon into small pieces. Fry, add chopped onion when bacon reaches a golden brown, and as soon as the onion begins to carmelize (a minute or two), add the corn (cut from the cob). Salt and pepper generously. Lower heat, and stir a few times. It is DONE in about 5 minutes. I do NOT overcook the corn as this recipe indicates. I like the corn to pop as you eat it....fresh and tender. This is the ONLY way to cook this dish and have it be great!! My recipe is an all time favorite of my family and friends.

Haven't made this dish yet but would like to take a short cut by using good quality frozen (shucked) corn. How much corn comes from 12 ears of corn? 2 cups? 3 cups? Don't want to do the experiment to find out. Help!

Nice enough dish, but a lot of work for a side dish. My daughter loves anything with bacon in it, so had to try it at least once.
