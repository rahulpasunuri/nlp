Do not waste time and calories on these dry, scone like muffins. Was edible but neither moist nor savory. Maybe butter or some other liquid is missing?

Nice for a quick breakfast - didn't have sour cream so used plain yogurt, didn't have time to toast the pecans so just sprinkled them on top. Cooked for 15 minutes & they had the most perfect muffin shape, lightly golden top & everyone devoured them!

These are delicious, I added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, as well as a 1/2 teaspoon extra vanilla and only baked them for 15 minutes per other peoples reviews. Once again thanks for the reviews, good and bad. I agree the peach flavor isn't very prominent, but the muffins came out very moist.

These are OK, but not quite what I expected. The peach flavor disappears but the toasted pecans were great. They weren't bad, and I'd probably rate them 2 1/2 forks if that was an option. I think there are probably better muffin recipes out there.

I thought these were bland, even thought I added a bit more sour cream and preserves. I will try again, because they were so easy and it is a great way to use leftover sourcream, but I will try to use even more preserves.

I actually didn't have the preserves on hand so I used fresh, as another reviewer suggested. I had 1 1/2 lbs. of fresh peaches that I peeled and diced and added them in with the mix, instead of any preserves. This loaf (as I made it into instead of the muffins) was still incredibly moist and flavorful. I will try with the preserves another time, but I will also keep the recipe as is using only fresh peaches. Delicious!

I loved the idea of using preserves in a muffin. But, this muffin turned out dry and flavor-less. I will make the muffin again but shorten the cooking time add pumpkin pie spice.

These are very moist muffins, yum! I didn't have peach preserves so I used homemade pink grapefruit marmaladeand I also just sprayed my muffin pan with Pam. They turned out great.

These muffins were good...though i should have added more vanilla for a more distinct flavor. I made six large and eleven mini muffins. The minis took about ten minutes to bake. Having both sizes made a nice variety.

I used only fresh peaches (2 large), no preserves. I will definitely make them again, next time coating the peach pieces in a bit of flour. I certainly agree on the extra vanilla. No such thing as too much vanilla.

Took these muffins on a 3-day trip to the country and they held up well. They were still okay when we got back home. I did a minor substitution of fat free yogart for the sour cream (didn't have any sour cream in the frig that day). I was a little disappointed they didn't have more of peach flavor. I'm going to make them again and add some fresh orange zest and maybe bake them a little shorter time and see what happens. But they were good overall.

I tripled the vanilla and shortened the sugar just a bit for a delicious vanilla pecan muffin. I love these suckers! And with the preserves, they weather a day extremely well.

Just loved them! I sprayed the paper with Pam and was a breeze to come off. Today, I will try to use a different preserve. Thanks for the delicious muffins.

My dad would love this recipe - I'll make it for him the next time he's in town. I was hoping for a light and airy muffin. For me, the preserves (I used all fruit/no added sugar) made these too sweet and they ended up tasting like a heavier banana/fruit bread.

This was a terrific recipe. Twenty minutes baking time is too long, though. Best to check them after 15 minutes.

I modified this recipe by increasing sour cream to 3/4 of a cup and substituting orange marmalade for the peach preserves, and increasing it to 3/4 cup. I also swapped toasted almonds for the pecans and added 2/3 cup white chocolate chips. These melt in your mouth.

Delicious muffins. Good crumb, crispy exterior. I don't like muffin pan paper liners; I prefer to grease the muffin pan. Let the muffins rest for 4 minutes after taking them from the oven, and then remove from the tin. I used lowfat sour cream, and they were still delicious.
