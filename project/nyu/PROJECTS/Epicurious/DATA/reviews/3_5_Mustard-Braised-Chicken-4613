Made this in 1998. Found the recipe as I was tossing most of my saved Bon Appetits from the past 15 years (I hated parting with them...thank God for Epicurious.) Anyway, I had scribbled "Awesome" on the recipe, so decided to try it again. Yummy again. Added some sour cream at the end to thicken up the sauce and used chicken thighs. Served it with oven roasted potatoes and carrots, which were great with the sauce.

Great recipe. We didn't have chicken broth in the house, so I used beef stock. Also, instead of opening up a new bottle of wine, I used a cup of champagne leftover from mimosa's this morning! It was delicious, and pretty quick, once the chicken was browned.

Love this. Used 8 chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken, and didn't bother marinating before braising the chicken (I compensated by using a little more mustard and herbs in the braising liquid). I also used a little extra thyme and rosemary instead of the marjoram. Can see how it would be great with frites, but if you're like me and not a fry guy, mashed potatoes are also a nice pair.

Made this today and used skinless, boneless chicken breasts. Marinated with rub several hours. Very good with oven fries. Also served a Red Cabbage Slaw found elsewhere on this site that includes a Balsamic vinegar based dressing. Paired well with a red burgundy as suggested. Was a cozy meal for a rainy day!

i made this last night..i also did not marinate overnight..added more dry mustard (by accident) and used fresh tarragon, thyme, and rosemary both to marinate for about 20 minutes and at the end to finish the dish. i used skin on whole legs (5) after well-searing them. i served with rainbow chard sauteed with garlic and white wine, and creamy polenta -both were great sides. Served a pinot noir with it and for dessert made apple cobbler cake from this site. all in all a tasty winter meal.

Best thing I have ever made from this site. used 4 tbs olive oil and 12 skinless/boneless chk thighs; also used "poultry seasoning" fresh herb pack form the grocery (thyme, sage and rosemary); doubles the amount of onion and garlic and incr the Dijon to 8tbs but kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Skipped the "make a paste of the herbs" business and just added 1/2 the fresh herbs during the cooking process and sprinkled the other half on before serving. Absolutely delicious. Oven fried potatos and a green salad w tart green apples finished off the meal. Could easily serve to company - best part- each chicken thigh is only 4 Weight Watcher Points!

Very good, wonderful flavor. Note that the recipe recommends marinating overnight and cooking time is almost one hour; this is not a quick dish. If you don't usually like mustard, I recommend trying this dish. The flavor is that good.

I made this with chicken thighs (bone-in, skin off) and it was DELICIOUS. The sauce is really incredible so have plenty of side dishes or crusty bread to soak it up with.

I tried this recipe last week and served it at a small dinner party. I made this dish the day before serving it so the flavours had a longer time to blend Everyone really enjoyed it! I used fresh herbs as requested, used chicken thighs instead of various chicken pieces and used white wine based Dijon mustard that I purchased from the Maille store in Dijon, France! I would definitely make this again and our dinner guest requested the recipe.

This is a recipe that is high in our menu repertoire. It is wonderful with oven frites, which go very well with the delicious sauce. I substitute a healthy portion of tarragon instead of the marjoram to give it more of a French, bistro taste. Fabulous!!

I don't usually bother to pan a recipe, but this dish was soooo disappointing! I'm not sure what didn't work, but the flavors didn't blend well and the sauce was just blah - how could a dish with so much promise turn out to be so wrong?

I have made this dish at least a dozen times -- it is one of my all-time favorites. The sauce is unbelievably good. Serve with rice or bread to soak it up!

Neither my husband nor I cared for flavor of sauce or the texture. Not a keeper for us.

Made this for a burgundy tasting dinner. Was great with garlic mash potatoes. Even the restaurant owner loved the flavours

I loved the flavors. I kept it simple, and served it with white rice, but I can imagine it would be great with french fries as well.

Very good dish... easy enough to put together and provides a nice plethora of flavors. Next time, I just may add a carrot or two and some quartered onion. This was nice with some wild rice as the gravy added zip to the starch (the gravy is killer!). I served with a '95 Louis Jadot Puligny Montrachet... Fabulous! An Oregon or Carneros Pinot Noir next time... just for the Hell of it! Oh Behave!
