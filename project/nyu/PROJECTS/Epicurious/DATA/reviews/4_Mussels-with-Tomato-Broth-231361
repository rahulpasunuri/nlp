I thought this recipe was just ok. Nothing special. There are far more other interesting mussel recipes on epicurious.com. I would suggest the mussels with saffron cream, among others....

Simply spectacular, much better than the best mussels we've had at restaurants. As noted by other reviewers, add the diced onion. We use about 2.5 pounds of mussels for the two of us and the same quantities for the broth as in the recipe. Good crusty bread for the broth and this is epicural bliss.

Hmmmm... Superb! I finally got up the courage to make mussels for my very first time, and this was the recipe I chose. AWESOME! Sooo delicious! And so easy! I actually made the tomato sauce they recommend, and the extra effort was not much at all. (Although it did require a bit of extra time). I made the full recipe for three people, and it was a bit too much food. Next time, I'll just calculate a pound of mussels for each person. :)

I love shellfish, and used to think they were too difficult to prepare at home. This recipe is definitely one of the easiest on record, and could not have been more delicious. My roommate isn't even a big fan of shellfish, and he loved every bite. My only advice is: DON'T forget the extra crusty bread! I had basic italian, but next time i think either a foccacia or a sourdough would add a nice touch.

For the time involved, this recipe is an easy 4 forks! Instead of making the tomato sauce we did what another reviewer suggested and used a can of diced tomatoes and a pinch of sugar. We also sauteed a chopped onion with the garlic. WOW! Delish in less than 20 minutes!

I always love a recipe that yields fantastic results with minimal effort. The sweet, spicy tomato sauce that bathes these briny mussels is so delicious, it demands a crusty loaf of peasant bread to soak up every last drop of it. Prepared in about ten minutes, I served this with the remaining white wine to a very appreciative husband.

Fabulous dish! One of the easiest and most delicious meals I've made in a long time. I used 1/2 can of diced tomatoes with a pinch of sugar instead of tomato sauce. Served it over capellini and had a nice baguette to soak up the sauce. A real winner! This goes on my list of favorites.

Excellent recipe, even though I made it a little simpler by using Trader Joe's pasta "starter sauce." I used fresh mussels from the farmer's market and cooked them the same day, so was very fresh. Excellent with crusty bread and a salad.

This is my favorite recipe for mussels. So quick & easy & it tastes just like the mussels from our favorite tapas restaurant. Great dinner with just a simple salad, a glass of wine & a loaf of bread.

I made this for my doubtful boyfriend. I too used pasta sauce. The result was an absolute hit. There were many "yums" and a final, "There isn't enough left!"

WE made this recipe for New Year's Eve and it was great!! It smelled so wonderful through the whole house; we toasted the new year with some wine and mussels. Again, don't forget the bread to sop up the sauce...yummy!

The sauce was lovely. I added half a cup of Verjuice (tangy grapejuice) to the sauce along with fresh oregano... our guests were polishing their plates with our homemade damper bread :-)

This is a lovely recipe. It was easy to make and added a nice zip to ordinary mussels. After seeing some of the reviews below, I decided to add onion, green pepper and oregano as to make this more like a spaghetti sauce. It turned out fabulous. Do not forget to serve this with a nice crusty bread, to mop up the broth. My husband yummed all thru dinner. This is delish and definitely a keeper.

A fabulous dish with great character from the red pepper flakes and wine. The tomato sauce is fabulous and is wonderful over pasta, in lasagna, etc. In fact, you can turn this dish into a hearty meal by serving the mussels and sauce over linguine.

It was so simple you might be surprised by how wonderful it tastes for so little effort! We loved it; we made the tomato sauce the day before and used it also on spaghetti (which was great). Served with a lovely garlic foccacia.

A better cook than I could end up with more juice in the pot to accompany the loads of mussels. Very simple to make and delicious.
