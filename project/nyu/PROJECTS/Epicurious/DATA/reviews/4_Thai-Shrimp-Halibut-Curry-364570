I thought it was good but not memorable. I don't think I'll make it again given the price of the fish required and the fact that I didn't find it to be incredible.

This is now my new go to Thai curry recipe. I love it because its tasty as is or can be easily modified to your liking. I added green beans for some extra color and crunch and didnt include the halibut. And instead of cooking the shrimp in the curry, I sautéed it separately in a hot pan and served it on top of the curry rice dish. Id like to find a good red curry paste because the one that I used doesnt have enough kick (paste in a jar from Thai Kitchen..bought at Whole Foods). Dont forget to adjust the flavor with extra fish sauce and lime juice. Mmm&

This was amazing! I substituted Patak's Madras Curry Paste from our local Indian market for the ultra spicy Thai curry paste. I then added cayenne to taste. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Both my husband and I LOVED it. (N.B., all the chopping takes a while. To make things go more quickly, chop everything ahead of time.)

This is a great recipe! I did more than double the curry paste and lime juice, and I used a cheaper white fish instead of halibut. It was very simple to make, and I could get most of it ready ahead of time and put it together for dinner in about 10 minutes. It had great flavors and a fancy feel to it. I may serve this at a dinner party because it is delicious, yet so easy to make.

I made this dish for a thai themed dinner party, and it was very good! I doubled the curry paste and added some pepper flakes for some more spice. Also, easy to cook ahead and reheat right before dinner.

With some modifications, this turned out to be excellent. With extra red curry, ginger, lime zest, basil, cilantro, and fish sauce the flavor is wonderful. I like more heat as well, so I added in some sriracha, which was perfect. Served over jasmine rice cooked a keffir leaf.

So, I took the other reviewers to heart and knew I would need to doctor this recipe...I just didn't realize how much. First of all, I used just halibut...And, I have to say this dish is not worthy of $20+ per lb fish. I would definitely use just a cod or whitefish next time. I had to double the curry, and also added some sambal oelek to enhance the flavor. I don't really like things too spicy, but felt the dish needed an extra "kick". Also, asthetically, this dish was not pretty to look at. The sauce looked like thousand island dressing in color...Finally, I added some baby bok choy as there was a serious lack of vegetables in my opinion..

Excellent! I made it with shrimp only and increased the amt of shrimp.

Made this one in haste without reading the reviews as I usually do to make sure that tweaking isn't in order. As it turns out my modifications on the fly were exactly what the reviews called for - more curry paste. I made my decision based on color. I didn't double it, I'd say I increased by 50%. LOVED IT. Robust and authentic to Thai-restaurants-in America flavor. Simple. Fast. Presentable Tasty. Adding to my kitty.

Here's the thing: super fast, super easy to modify, and the reviews have turned this into a more than slightly different recipe. It's so good. Try it! I chopped the veggie about an hour ahead of time during a ladies happy hour at my house, and by the time my by came home, I pretty much just had to saute everything. I also didn't have red curry paste but put in the basic ingredients for a homemade paste. Mmmmm.

I was treated to a delicious dinner by my boyfriend, who made this last night. It was outstanding. He took the advice of others and increased the curry paste. We still could have gone hotter! I have tasted many similar recipes. This one had all the elements I love - lots of cilantro, basil, and lime flavor. And halibut? The perfect fish for this dish and such a treat for me. I would not have bought it for myself because it is so expensive. Thanks, P!

I'm really glad I read a bunch of the reviews before making this recipe. I more than doubled the red curry paste and put about 1 3/4 tablespoons of the fish sauce. It still wasn't spicy but definitely had flavor. Also, instead of jasmine rice, I served this with brown rice. It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

Usually I like to make things according to the recipe first before I make modifications, but in this case I did not do that because my husband and I like spicey food so I took the advice of others. I added more curry paste and added chopped fresh thai chiles. I also omitted the fish and doubled the shirmp. It was very flavorful, easy and worth making again.

I had high hopes for this recipe based on other reviews, but wound up disappointed. The flavor in the recipe is decent, but very bland. If you're looking for an authentic spicy thai curry, this isn't it. If you're a Midwestern that prefers tame / blander spices, there are higher odds that you'll like this. This is definitely an Americanized tasting curry. :( I would not make this again.

Rating: 3
This recipe is great. Flavor is really fantastic. I did add about double the amount of red chile paste, added chile flakes, and doubled the ginger...and it still was not very spicy. Also added green peas to add color to the dish itself as I only had a yellow pepper. Served over rice. Yummy.

Rating: 4
Made this for my husband's family and it was described as "divine" by his father. Very easy to make though the shrimp and halibut make it a bit pricey, but there is more than enough shrimp and fish in the original recipe to serve 8 instead of 4. Is excellent served with jasmine rice or basmati.

Rating: 3
I made this for New Year's Eve for friends and it was very, very good but I made one mistake: I used brown rice instead of jasmine or white rice. The sauce needs a lighter rice...not brown, not red. Also, do not cut halibut chunks less than 1 inch as they break apart. The sauce is delicious (increased red curry paste a bit and added some dried thai basil and pinch of red peper flakes) and will make again!

Rating: 4
This is a great curry! It does need more spice however. I added 1 T. thai red chili paste to the recipe and it was not enough. I also followed other reviewers suggestions and added more curry paste, more ginger, snow peas, and carrots. I used cod in the place of halibut and it worked perfectly. Cod is so cheap and sometimes hard to work in to a tasty dish. It was the best use of cod I've found so far. You could really taste the vegetables and the texture of the curry was just right. I will definitely make this again.

I used what was on hand: organic lemon zest and lemon juice (instead of lime), chick peas, carrots and shrimp. It was much better than I expected! It was exceptional.

This curry was perfection! We used chilean seabass instead of halibut. The seasoning was perfect. It just had a slight kick, but nothing crazy. Make sure to serve it with some kind of grain because the sauce is far too amazing to not soak up with something.

The reviews here are spot-on. This recipe has excellent flavor, but if you like spicey, you will definitely need to adjust the "heat" up on this one.

We loved this...used lf coconut milk, added a pinch of hot pepper spice (asian) and a bit extra of the red curry paste. Next time might add even more red curry paste and extra hot spice. We also didn't like our italian basil -- would use less, or thai basil... We also used cod ($12 / lb) vs halibut $26/lb.....quite yummy will definitely make this again and again....

This is a winner. My hard to please spouse really liked it. I used swordfish, halibut, scallops, and shrimp. Threw in some bok choy and carrots but it really could have used more veggies. Took me longer to prep than to cook.

Made this for dinner tonight with jasmine rice. I added carrots and baby corn and used chicken instead of shrimp and/or fish since both my wife and I don't care for seafood. The spice was just right for the kids (3 & 5) and both my wife and I added sriracha to ours at the table. We all thought it was very good, my youngest even had seconds!

This was a very good "fast and easy" family dinner recipe. I was concerned the Thai Red Curry paste would be too spicy, but it wasn't at all (people who like spice can add sriracha or sambal oelek). I used just fish and everybody was happy. I added chopped baby corn, too. I served it with Gordon Ramsay's coconut rice -- delicious!

Rating: 4
It's a great "guide" recipe. I have made it twice so far, first time with tilapia and shrimp, then with just tilapia. I am sure any white fish would do. I was generous with the curry paste, added a dash of cayenne,added more lime juice than called for, cooked the fish a little longer than mentioned and made the dish sit so the flavors marry with the fish. In general its a great recipe, just needs quite doctoring it up.

Great Meal. Easy and flavor full. I took the liberty of adding some Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce based on previews reviews stating it could use a little more spice to it. Turned out great!!!

Rating: 3
Solid Thai dish with mass appeal. I felt it certainly could have used some more spice, and I followed the recipe pretty much accurately (1 lb shrimp, 1 lb halibut.) I made another version for our eight year old that omitted the spice, and to be honest, there wasn't that much difference between the two. I feel this could have been really good as a spicy dish... in fact, I may try it again that way. Served over jasmine rice... since it was a weekday I didn't have time to boil the shells to get a shrimp stock going, but that may help.

I don't even like Thai food, and I loved this meal. I made it because I knew my husband would really like it, and we were even able to convince our 5 year old to eat it. I made it as written although used extra lime and ginger because I had it on hand, and added snow peas for more veggies. Oh, also I used cod because it was so much cheaper than halibut. Served over jasmati rice and it was fantastic! Even great the next day cold. I will definitely make this again.

This dish was fantastic, although it did need alot of adjusting. I basically doubled the curry paste and ginger, and it had great flavor. I also used catfish because it comes fresh (and cheap) locally. This was accompanied by jasmine rice. I cannot wait to make it again.

Love this recipe. I used salmon instead of halibut and was a little heavy handed with the ginger, curry paste and basil, but otherwise followed precisely. (oh, I used light coconut milk because that was what I had) Huge hit, even with 15 yr old boy. This sauce is worth making no matter what you put in it. It would be great alone, over vegetables, chicken, etc. Definitely will make again.

Kiiiiind of just made this. I was lacking a few of the ingredients, but have had thai red curry paste on hand for a while and have wanted to try it for the longest time. AND I recently steamed/boiled/sauteed some flounder that needed to be used up. This recipe was used more as a guideline for me, so I don't feel right giving it a fork rating. Anyways, real quick (hopefully): I didn't have coconut milk, red bell pepper, basil or cilantro and I added a whole, seeded, chopped jalapeno. FOr the coconut milk I used equal amounts Fage (Fa-yeh) greek yogurt and a dash of coconut flavoring (gave the same flavor, but not the same consistency, a bit too dry for some). Oh. And I served with the recommended lime wedges plus some avocado I needed to use up (it's H-O-T today/night and I thought the avocado would add a little needed chill to the dish). Overall, I quite enjoyed it. I attribute most of the flavor to the curry paste. Yum. I'll definitely be making more curries with the leftover curry paste... might play around with this recipe some more. :)

Let me start by saying that I do not usually like any coconut-based Thai curries, even from the best Thai restaurants. Its something about the overpowering coconut and lemongrass taste that I just can't palate much else in these dishes. Well, I gave this one a shot and my bf and I LOVED it. Wasn't measuring exactly but I added a little extra shallot, red bell pepper, and ginger. Def bumped up the curry paste and fish sauce also for extra flavor. Used lite coconut milk. Since halibut is so expensive, I used 2 lbs shrimp instead. Served over steamed rice w/ sugar snap peas. So fresh and flavorful, yet not heavy at all. I will most certainly be making this again.

This was very, very good. Hubby said could use some more spice just as other's mentioned however due to feeding a 9 yr old and a 12 yr old I opted for adding spice at the table. Served w/ jasmine rice and garlic nan - my son who is not a rice fan used the nan to sop up the wonderful sauce. All gave this 4 forks! PS. Used cod instead of halibut as it was fresh and halibut wasn't - worked great.

I like this base recipe, but it was too dry and there was no heat. Next time I make it, I'm going to double the liquids and quadruple the curry. My only concern is whether the skillet will be big enough.

I have never reviewed before, we loved this. The only changes made were the addition of about 2 tsp. of jalapeno pepper minced because some said it needed more heat and 1/2 tsp of sugar to soften a bit. Used cod instead of halibut. Husband said it is a keeper!

First of all - I am reviewing the recipe as written. I bought Pacific halibut and removed the skin carefully from the chunks. I purchased fresh-caught gulf shrimp that were large and delicious. The recipe was easy to make and it was fast. On the pros side - it tasted light and fresh. Cons - the curry was lacking depth. The balance of salty-sweet-sour-hot was off. It needs a lot of tweeking to be made tastier, but I can see that it would be a good base recipe to work off of. All in all, I don't think I'd make it again.

Just found this Recipe, and it sounds amazing. My boyfriend is a curry lover and while I'm not sure about curry, I'm willing to try this dish. My problem is I'm horribly allergic to COCONUT, is there anything I can use in replace of the coconut and not ruin the dish?

Excellent recipe!! Instead of Halibut, I used fresh Tilapia & what a dream! I must say, I have to agree with bakeme - if you like spicier foods, add more curry. It was flavorful enough, just needed some extra spice. I also used the tube minced garlic and it worked just fine!

Good! but needs some extra heat(I like my food spicier than the rest of the family). Will make again but use some suggestions from other reviews. Jasmine rice is a must

My sympathy goes to the last reviewer, whom I urge to give it another shot. It's tedious when things go awry in the kitchen. But this is basically a good recipe and should be fairly straight forward once you tweak the amounts a bit to your preference. I never thought of combining halibut with shrimp! My tips are: use Mae Ploy curry paste - it's about the nearest to fresh you'll find in a pot. Tons of flavour. I use up to 2 tbs (yes, I said tablespoons!). Add a little at a time if you are a newbie, until it suits your palate. A good coconut milk like Chaokoh makes a big difference too. Finally, IMHO, a touch of brown sugar balances out the limes and spice - about a teaspoon in this recipe. And if you don't like the oh-so-fishy taste of fish sauce, substitute a teaspoonful of thai shrimp paste instead. I did this when cooking thai curry for a friend once and now actually prefer it. Good luck!

Very Average. I was so excited when I saw this recipe in the magazine and couldn't wait to make it. I was even more excited after I saw all of the rave reviews... It was a simple enough recipe and did not require a huge effort, but just reminded me once again why I do not waste my time cooking ethnic dishes at home. I could have picked up a WAY tastier curry at the Thai restaurant down the street and not spent an hour in the kitchen...At least I didn't have to buy a ton of exotic ingredients - now all I've got is a bottle fish sauce that I'll probably throw away next time I move. It was not a bad dish, but just did not have a lot of flavor. I wish that I would have followed the advice of other reviewers and spiced it up a bit.

Rating: 4
This recipe is amazing!!!! I have made it twice. Both times using light coconut milk, extra madras curry paste and a prepackaged vegetable curry to simplify (I have a 2 yr old and a 3 yr old running around). Also, I cooked the halibut in the oven, while making the curry sauce and when the halibut came out of the oven to rest, I added the shrimp to the curry for about 3 minutes until shrimp were cooked. Poured curry shrimp concoction over halibut and voila, dinner was served. DELICIOUS!

I thought that this was outstanding and I will definitely make it again. After making it, I was reminded of how easy thai curry is to make and this recipe is no exception. Like other reviewers, I doubled the curry and used whatever canned coconut milk was on hand and added some hot sauce for some spice. Awesome.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband kept raving. I loved it too. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding some blanched green beans at the very end for some vegetable interest.

I made this a few nights ago, and my husband loved it, asked to have it added to our usual meal rotation.

This was delicious and easy to prepare once everything was chopped. I couldn't find halibut so I used cod. I also used a few extra shrimp. I had green curry paste in the refrigerator so I used that instead. I'm not sure if it makes a difference-maybe spicier.I would definitely make this again (soon). Why does food from many Thai restaurants not taste as good?
