Really tasty, especially with the grilled veal chops recommended elsewhere on this site. I've also served it with turkey and it's great.

Wnderful the way it is . Just a little note I agree with ACook when it is mostly done put in a greased or sprayed casserole and bake at 300 for about 10-20 minutes. Keep checking( covered by foil) Another nice UP is grate some NUTMEG on them ,up to you how much ,just to taste. Do NOT scrimp on the full fat cream makes all the difference. In reference to some people the bigger the parnip the woodier the taste MEDIUM is best small has no flavour Have Berries for dessert

Was an amazing side dish. I am a personal chef so I know when a dish is just the good with minimal ingredience. Pure taste. Didn't come out stringy at all if you cook it long enough. Salt and pepper is a must!

The key to this and any recipe is fresh vegetables. These were a great alternative to mashed potatoes, and had a sweet taste. Very, very good.

This was fabulous- I doubled the recipe and put it in the blender and it came out perfect and delicious and creamy. How everyone got stringy I don't know- are you sure you were using parsnips? Everyone raved about it- a great easy yummy warm creamy winter fall side dish.

Ok... this was so easy to make and great.. I did use thicker parsnips jus tin case after reading a review about stringy!.. I dsicarded the tips and about a half inch from the end of the root just in case .. I also added a small idaho potato .. and I had to add a bit more milk/creme (But I did forget to weigh the parsnips in the store.. I probably had over a pound).. I cooked it a bit longer I made this early in the day and them baked it later and it got a nice browned top .. it was so sweet ! My husband of couse did not like it but he hates squash and sweet ptotato so I was not surprised .. the dinner party loved it and it needs nothing else.. A+

I was so looking forward to this as an alternative to mashed potatoes. The flavor did not disappoint but the texture was awful....it was all stringy! Was something wrong with my parsnips? I bought thin ones....

My boyfriend's sister made this for me. I was skeptical - I thought I hated parsnips! It was awesome. It's a nice change from mashed potatoes - and even my "meat & potatoes" boyfriend loved them! I just bought parsnips (for the first time in my life!) and I'll be making this tonight!
