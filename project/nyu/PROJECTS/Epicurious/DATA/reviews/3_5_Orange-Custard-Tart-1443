YUCK! THIS WAS TOTALLY DISGUSTING. the flavour of the oranges clashed with the custard flaour, my children were really upset and all my vistors were quite uoset at the results. we agree that this recipe is for the dog, and the dog only!

This is a wonderful recipe! The flavor of oranges is a refreshing taste for dessert. The presentation is elegant,the taste is great and is easy to prepare.

I made this as a final course for our dinner-party group and it was was a huge hit. It is very light and perfect for a Southwestern theme. I garnished with candied orange rind and rasberries and served atop rasberry sauce. It works fine in a round tart pan - although the crust was a bit difficult to cut. Would reduce cooking time a tad.
