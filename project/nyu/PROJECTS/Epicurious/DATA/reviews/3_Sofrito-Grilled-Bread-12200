I must have spread it on too think. It didn't really cook sofrito side down... It tasted good even though the center part was a little soggy (at least the edges were crispy). Probably would work just fine under the broiler though and be a little more fool proof.

Very, very good. The sofrito had a wonderful flavor and aroma though the color was a little...less than fresh looking? My mother described it as 'baby poo'. Grilling the sofrito bread smelled wonderful, and added a nice smoky flavor. Be sure to oil the grill! Will make again!

This dish has a wonderful exotic flavor. Great for a snack or lite lunch.

Coming from the Caribbean myself, I HAD to try this, I added an herb used in my country to make sofrito, which is recao (I can't find it in this area, so I asked my mother to send some from home)..and you know what? It just reminds me of home!

Yuk. This was the only thing left over at my cocktail party- no one liked it.

Sounds weird - tasted great. Fixed it for a gourmet campout and have had requests to fix it again from the non-cooks and requests for the recipe from those that do. No problem keeping the puree on the bread while it grilled just don't pile it on too thick.

If you grill the bread sofrito side down, how do you keep the spread from falling off?

Everyone at my dinner loved the grilled sofrito bread. It tastes a bit like garlic bread, only without all of the calories and with the nice addition of the taste of the red pepper.
