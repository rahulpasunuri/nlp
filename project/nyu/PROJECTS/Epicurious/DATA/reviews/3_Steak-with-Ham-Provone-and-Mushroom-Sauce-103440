used white mushrooms but cooked them brown with the onions, didn't have wine so i used balsamic vinegar with a table spoon of niscoise salad dressing and caramelized. turned out sweet which was perfect because the black forest ham i used was salty. all in all most recipes here need to be tweaked to your own pallet.

I generally agree with the reviewers on this site, but this recipe was was a let-down. I followed the directions precisely, but the meal was just not that good. As other reviewers suggest, if someone was going to try this recipe, I'd double the mushroom sauce and carmelize the marsalla in a different pan. I put the steak under a "foil tent" as in the recipe, but the meat got cold anyway. Even so, the flavors didn't come together and the whole thing was a disappointment. i won't make this again. Oh well.

Pretty much Filet Mignon Saltimbocca. Not bad, but WAYYY too much oil. I used the amount called for for the mushrooms and it was so oily I just used the leftovers to fry the meat. Warning: 1 1/2 minutes per side is for RARE!

My only problem with this recipe was that I didn't make enough of the mushroom/sauce mixture for topping. Beyond that, my girlfriend and I both loved it. How someone could find this recipe "disgusting" is...weird.

This meal looked more disgusting than the cadaver we dissected in biology 493.

Very good recipe... used Cremini mushrooms since they are more flavorful than white mushrooms. Definitely a keeper!

One of the best homecooked meal I've ever made. Finally something that tastes different with the right proportions of everything.A real winner!

Make sure the deli cuts your provolone thin - the thick can become messy. Trimming around the meat isn't an option . Used a 12 inch 4-gauge aluminum non-stick pan for six 1/2" tenderloins with no problems (a couple were smaller). Used the same pan for the mushroom sauce, and for Mushrooms Diane. Prepare this course last as it's really quick. Somehow I didn't have enough sauce left with the mushrooms at the end, but it was still phenomenal.

The prosciutto and cheese made this recipe divine. I used pork instead of the beef and it was just as delicious. My boyfriend had morbiend (sp?) cheese on his meat while I used swiss for mine. The wine and mushrooms enhance the fine flavor.
