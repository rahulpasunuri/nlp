Recipe not quite accurate: 6 minutes yield semi-firm yam. Picture misleading: Just no way it could turn out looking like that if you follow the recipe. The puff pastry probably should be baked separately so it will be crispy and then the whole dish can be "composed" to look like the picture. But, the caramel is delicious and saved the whole thing. Will try again w/ adjustments.

mine did not turn out as pretty as the pitcure but it was still delicious. this was because the puff pastry became soggy from the caramel right after i inverted the tarts on the plate. it was very easy to make. the vanilla ice cream is necessary to help curb the sweetness of the dish. i will make these again

Yes you can make this dish ahead of time. Just make it then bring it out to warm to room temp. before dinner. Easy pie !!

I'd love to try this but I don't want to make a dinner party dessert that requires last-minute attention. Does anyone know if I can prepare the individual servings before guests arrive and put them in the fridge until we're through with the main course?
