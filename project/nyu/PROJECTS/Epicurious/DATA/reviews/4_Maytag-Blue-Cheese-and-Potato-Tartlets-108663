I made these almost exactly as the recipe called for...but used regular butter and plain old tap water. Delicious and easy to make. My husband and company raved about them. Definitely a make again recipe!

Fabo tart. I made mine in small Pyrex oven proof bowls. I did not grease and they did not stick. skipped the thyme..i do no like. added pile of chives on top each before baken. I might add the Rosemary in the crust next time...for even more added color.

Very rich. I made 1 and half times more and put it in a large tart pan. It served 8-10 people since it is very rich and the slices were somewhat small. Wonderful flavor. I made it as an appetizer. It would be good for a brunch too.

Absolutely delicious. Very rich & heavy though. Something for a special occassion. I made these over Christmas last year & people still talk about them.

Leaving aside the pretentiousness of a recipe specifying San Pellegrino, I have to say this is a lovely recipe. I found it when searching for a way to use blue cheese in something that could be taken on an evening picnic. The sharpness of the cheese mellows out in baking; even my blue cheese-hating husband pronounced them yummy. I prepped the potatoes the day before, so the whole dish came together very quickly.
