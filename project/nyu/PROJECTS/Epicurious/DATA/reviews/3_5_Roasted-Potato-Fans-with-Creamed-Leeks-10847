I had high hopes for this recipe considering it utilized some of my favorite staples. However, the texture of the onion and leeks with the broth and flour after removed from oven was far too mushy and kind of unpleasant. I would not serve this to company.

This is a keeper recipe. The whole family loved it. I didn't peel the potatoes (lovely light skinned locally grown russets) and used six smaller potatoes to create a lovely presentation as the looked like the petals of a flower. Great flavour, easy to make and enjoyed by all; four forks for sure.

Strongly recommended! Plenty of flavor, nice proportion of potato to oniony stuff, lemon keeps it from being too sweet. I doubled the garlic because it just didn't look like enough for that amount of food. Pairs beautifully with sausage! Next time I may throw some in before baking and make it a main dish.

Made this for Easter dinner, and it was fabulous. I cooked the leeks and onions much longer, until they were almost carmelized - which is probably overkill; they'd carmelize just fine in the oven. I used Yukon gold potatoes. Made it up the night before, and then reheated for the dinner - came out great!

This wasn't terrible; I'm giving it one fork because it was "just so-so." After an hour and a quarter in the oven, the baked potatoes were very dry and the leeks and onions had caramelized to the point where they were burnt onto the pan. The leeks and onions that remained edible were very tasty, so if I tried to attempt anything from this recipe again, it would simply be caramelizing the leeks and onions, though not for the length of time called for in the recipe.

I made this last night, and threw a couple of steaks on the grill and made big salad. It was a yummy creamy comfort dish, but go easy on the amount of butter you top the potatoes with it doesn't take much, I also added some parmesian cheese to the leeks just before puting this in the oven. Yum!!!!!

I made two pans of this recipe to serve 18 people (with room for leftovers) on Christmas and it was a big hit. It was easy and made the house smell great, and I would definitely make it again for a crowd or in smaller quantities for just my own family.

This was an excellent side dish to accompany grilled steak for my "meat and potatoes" husband. Afterward, I took the left-over potatoes and steak, added a packet of beef onion soup mix and enough milk to cover. It was a "4 fork" soup!

Delicious!! I'll never eat potatoes a'la gratin again. This is better and I'm sure a lot less fat. I reduced the recipe for me and my husband. But next time I think I'll make the entire recipe. We could'nt get enough! I used 2 large leeks, 1 med. onion, 2 med to large sized sliced potatoes and 2/3 cup broth "1 cup would be better." It only took about 35 minutes to bake. I'll definitely make this again.
