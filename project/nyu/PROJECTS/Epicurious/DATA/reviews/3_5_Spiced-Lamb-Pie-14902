This is delicious. I made it almost exactly as written. Only sub was currants for golden raisins. I made the Cape Malay masala as well and it was worth the time. This one's going straight into my winter cookbook!

This really gets 2 1/2 forks-was easy to cut in half, had great flavor, but didnt blow my socks off. We eat ground lamb at least twice a month and so far, this has been my least fave recipe for it.

I was not expecting this to turn out. I only made it because I happened to have some lamb I wanted to use. It turned out great! Really interesting flavours. My husband and 2.5 year old both loved it. And it was SO easy. I changed a few things just to fit what I had on hand: pecans i/o almonds, dark raisins i/o golden, added a few sun dried toms because i didn't have quite enough raisins, I forgot the kaffir lime leaves (would have used dried ones anyway). Next time I'll make it as written. This would be a great dish to take to a pot luck! TRY IT!!!!
