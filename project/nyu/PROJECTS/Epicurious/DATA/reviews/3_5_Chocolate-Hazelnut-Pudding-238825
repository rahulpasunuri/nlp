This is a fabulous little trick to keep up your sleeve for a last minute practically guilt free dessert. Who knew making your own pudding organic was so easy?! I took inspiration from other reviewers and put some leftover unsweetened chocolate that had been hanging out in the my cupboard to use along with almond extract. Pudding was in the fridge before my veggies were sauteed and was ready to eat long before the 2 hour wait. A nice simple dessert. I'd give it 4 starts on easieness and deliciousness but 3 on WOW factor. Next time I might try to spice it up with other flavors other than or in addition to chocolate. I'd be curious to hear any other ideas -- nuts? blueberries? Will definitely make again.

Delicious, and so darn easy. Made it in about 10 minutes, including prep. I used a bar of dark chocolate and a half teaspoon of almond extract instead of tha gianduja.It may not seem like it yields a lot, but it is rich and a bit is already satisfying enough.

I always crave something sweet after dinner, and this is the perfect guilt-free-yet-tasty dessert. Because hazelnut chocolate is not always easy to find, I often use bittersweet chocolate and sprinkle in some cinnamon for a little twist. Add a small bit of whipped cream, and it is a really nice evening treat.

I decided to make this at the spur of the moment. Used Guittard chocolate chips. Realized I didn't have any cornstarch- crisis! Substituted flour. Great consistency, but could still taste a bit of the flour. Would probably be better with the original cornstarch.

ps.... add a quick homemade whipped cream (we spiked with a coffee liquor) and serve in martini glasses with fresh berries and mint to take it to special occassion level :)

Sweet and easy! I found this recipe in a pinch while looking for a good dessert to accompany a gluten-free dinner, so we didn't have the gianduja. But we had some nice fondue chocolate stored up and it worked just as great (minus, of course, the hazlenut flavor)! I'm going to try today with irish cream- we'll see how it works out.

We made this pudding using the Nutella modification. It was easy to make and had a very nice texture. As the recipe stated, using Nutella did not yield a remarkable flavor. It did however make for a very satisfying treat.
