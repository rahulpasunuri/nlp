We love this, great accompaniment for holiday dinners. Love the do ahead aspect for just such occassions.

This dish was a star at TDay with some minor changes. I used 5 oz of horseradish, doubled up on the allspice and fresh thyme. Browned the butter and thyme, mixed all in a cassarole and baked at the host's house. The sprouts lost some color, which was disappointing, but overall, tasted great.

This was a wonderful vegetable dish we included in a Thanksgiving menu. The bitterness of the brussels sprouts and zing of horseradish really went very well with some of the other sweeter dishes that are usually part of Thanksgiving. 3 of 8 people we had for dinner didn't care for brussels sprouts, so I suppose that is something to consider. Of course, it worked to our benefit because we ended up with more of these left over than we expected, which was a nice little bonus! If you like brussels sprouts you will love this dish!

The power of this recipe lies in its ease of preparation and the surprising combination of flavors. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was popular even among non-Brussels sprouts lovers. It was something different amidst the usual array of potato, yam, corn and green bean dishes. It's quickly made, and - especially a bonus for peak cooking times like Thanksgiving - part of it can be prepared beforehand (Brussels sprouts) and then brought together at the last minute. Not a bland or boring dish at all, thanks to the horseradish.

This was the sleeper hit of our Thanksgiving! Made it specifically for my father because he loves Brussels sprouts, but EVERYONE ended up really liking it and going back for more. Will make again!

I made this as a "mystery dish" for Thanksgiving 2 years ago. My husband and our friends all scowled, but upon tasting, they all loved it! I've made it several times since (it's now a staple for Thanksgiving and have never failede to convert the non-sprout eaters to the good side! The best part is the ability to cook the veggies ahead and throw together at the last minute...always good for holidays and parties!

This was sooo easy and sooo good! I actually used just brussels sprouts for it (no onions) and it was divine. Can't wait to try it again with the onions as I'm sure it might be a good combo. It will definitly be at my thanksgiving table!

This is a family favorite and has joined the lineup for Thanksgiving dinner. We do add (considerably) more horseradish that the recipe calls for.

This recipe is incredible, without changing a thing. I happen to love brussel sprouts, but this recipe could reform even the most vehement sprout-hater. The sprouts are creamy, flavorful without being gloppy, and the intermittent onions are just incredible. Highly recommended--and easy too! A great Thanksgiving dish.

Lucky for us, little did we realize that not much of my husband's family are brussels sprouts fans, so we were left with most of the left-overs. Dinner was on Saturday, left-overs were finished Monday. The combination of flavors was out of this world. Plus, the bitterness of the horseradish and sprouts as part of Thanksgiving dinner, where some of the dishes tend to lean towards the sweeter side (sweet potatoes, glazed carrots, etc.) was PERFECT. I will definitely be making this again...maybe I'll try it on the other side of the family next time...or maybe not, I wouldn't have any left-overs!

I made this using milk instead of cream, adding more flour to thicken and also used more horseradish.

I was underwhelmed by this dish. I read all of the reviews before preparing it and so grated allspice and added freshly ground nutmeg as well (as I tend to do with this type of green). Additionally I added more horseradish to give it more zip and a few shakes of garlic powder. I served it for Thanksgiving and while my guests raved about the other dishes no one said a word about this, so I guess that really says it all. There was nothing really wrong with it other than that it was a bit bland, it just wasn't specail, and that's what I try for during the holidays.

There are better brussel sprout recipes out there. I followed the recipe, but wished I added more horseradish in retrospect because as is, the taste is very mild. For all the work and calories, it is just okay.

This was a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving dinner- quite easy and very flavorful. I had to use "red" pear onions because that's all the market had- but they were a very pretty addition!

Brussel Sprouts are served precisely once a year in this family, and I guess I wanted to make them a little differently this year. I made this dish for 20 people for Thanksgiving -- and what a bust! I doubled the recipe, however in retrospect, I should not have doubled the horseradish!!! I think one tablespoon of horseradish would have been enough for a triple recipe! My sister told me if I had just boiled them and put some butter on them, everyone probably would have gobbled them down - but these were just sick. A waste of good brussel sprouts, whipping cream, and butter! Never again.

My husband, the picky one, loved this with our Thanksgiving meal. I liked it okay. I am not a huge fan of horseradish.

I am not an experienced cook and made these for my first Thanksgiving meal. They were easy and delicious--I couldn't believe I had made them!

Even the die-hard brussels sprout hater in the group liked this. It was delicious, but I'm sure a lot of it depends on the quality of your sprouts.

We enjoyed this recipe very much, especially since so much of it can be prepared earlier in the day. A suggestion to those who found their brussels sprouts bitter - try to find tiny ones that are very fresh. Those small pearl onions are a wonderful complement to this dish.

This was a wonderful dish. I did add a bit of shredded cheddar to the horseradish sauce but don't think this is necessary. I also grated some good parmesan reggiano on top which did enhance the overall dish. A keeper in my house.

My sprouts were a little on the bitter side, but even so, I'd rather keep these two vegetables, both of which I like very much, separate in the future, and made in different fashion.

This is very good. Even those who claimed not to really like brussel sprouts were appreciative of this particular preparation. I did substitute chopped onion for the pearl onions without any problem.

Ok, I'm rating with the changes I made. I do think it is a good recipe & will try it again. I wanted to make a meal w/o going to the grocery store. I made this side dish made from frozen brussels & didn't add any onions. I thought it was missing something, even w/the addition of a little more horseradish, so added some stone ground mustard. I've had the horseradish for a month, maybe it doesn't taste so good after that long?? Maybe it was the frozen brussels? Whatever, it is a recipe worth trying again.

Easy and very good!! I have also added sharp cheddar cheese for a little different flavor. Very good!

Loved this receipe...used the creamy horseradish...served it with a marinated New York Strip steak...wow! A great side dish...You could use more horseradish if the rest of the meal needs zipping.

I made this dish at Thankgiving. It was a wonderful complemet to turkey. Even those who never eat sprouts loved this one. It is definetly a keeper.

The taste was good, but not the consistency. I'll make it again, and omit the flour next time.

Having had terrible experiences with brussels sprouts as a kid, I was reluctant to try them again. Both my husband and I both loved this recipe, and have made it many times. The brussels sprouts also re-heat very well.

We love horseradish and brussel sprouts, but didn't care for this dish at all. Made it just as written. It just didn't have the zip that we had hoped for and seemed to rely on creaminess rather than interesting flavor. We threw out the leftovers, but we seem to be in the minority.

We love this dish! We slice our brussel sprouts into about 3 pieces so there isn't a small cabbage running around the plate. This technique seem to trick most of our friends who claim they don't care for brussel sprouts. We served this with our Christmas turkey and think it would also be great with a roast of beef. This one is a keeper!

I really liked this recipe - served it to a couple of family members that just loved brussel sprouts and horseradish in particular, and it was a big hit. I even liked it and I don't really care for horseradish. It was pretty easy to make too.

This side dish was the most popular out of the six offered at Thanksgiving. I steamed frozen brussel sprouts and used bottled pearl onions to save time. I don't particularly care for horseradish, but loved this dish. The horseradish gave just enough flavoring, but was not overpowering. Many of my guests requested this recipe .

We don't like brussels sprouts, so replaced them with broccoli, and loved it! I was suspicious about so much horseradish, but it was delicious and not too hot, even for the 2 year old.
