Really really good. I used just under a 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and just under a tsp of sugar to cut the acidity. Added shrimp and sausage. Delicious!

I love this dish and make it just about every other week. I do make some small changes to the recipe. I usually put in much more garlic and pepper flakes than called for (approx. 3/4 a head of garlic and a tbsp of pepper flakes). Also, I keep the basil in the sauce. I read elsewhere that slicing the garlic into thin slices and either tossing it in olive oil and roasting it in the oven or sauteing it in a pan before adding the tomato adds extra flavor so I'm planning on trying that as well. Overall, wonderful recipe!

I didn't exactly follow the recipe because I was only cooking for myself. I made a big batch of sauce but only one portion of pasta so didn't do the whole throw-the-pasta-with-water in the sauce. I just tipped some sauce in the pasta pan and mixed. It's a good recipe. This is basic Italian.

This is such a great dish that can be a main or a side. It can be jazzed up or put in a bowl for an easy meal in front of TV or for my teenage son's afternoon snack. Instead of the can tomatoes, I buy the Sugo Di Pomodoro which is the same thing as the pureed peeled tomatoes.

Just fixed this. Loved the bucatini. Thought it made the dish. Can't find bucatini in our area so ordered from Penn Mac. I always use San Marzano tomatoes and parmigiano reggiano whenever I make Italian. Next time, I will add more crushed red pepper flakes and keep the basil in the sauce instead of removing. The butter definitely added a creaminess to the dish also!! Will definitely add to my Italian dishes I fix regularly.

I see now that I missed the final step with stirring in the butter, that would have cut the acidity...will do it next time.

This is simple, but excellent! A little tomatoey-acidic, so if that bothers you a friend told me you can drop in a cube/teaspoon of sugar. I had it as is on shells and loved it. Oh, I also added three diced heirloom tomatoes, it was great!

This is simple but delicious. The only change I made was that I bought tomatoes that were already pureed, and didn't remove the basil. There was enough sauce that I could have used the whole box of spaghetti or you would have extra to swish your garlic bread in.

I found this recipe through googling pasta recipes which would use what i had on hand for my childrens dinner - WHAT a find!! I tasted it before dishing up, and ended up having a bowl myself instead of keeping it for seconds for the boys - they also cleaned their bowls and - oops - asked for more - bad mummy!! Will be batch cooking the sauce and freezing meal sized portions for quick weekday meals from now on

This is by far one of the most simple and best pomodoro recipe we've made. After making it a few times I now add extra pasta water and a few splashes of red wine which I think just helps it cook without sticking too much. I also cut down on the butter a little too, its delicious!!!

this recipe is amazing and very easy. the dish turned out to be delectable.everyone in my family loved it..though i did substitute basil sprigs for curry leaves and i think it added more flavour..and the butter in the end just added more richness to the pasta.

Fantastic dish on it's own;I love the spicy and yet slightly tomatoe sauce that is made here! And,if you think you may Carnivores in the house who would prostest a meatless spaghetti ,it's also fantastic (and I MEAN that,tasted me-self) with Turkey Meatballs(link to them below). Also,fyi to anyone:I SUBBED diced up can tomatoe instead of canned peeled ones beacuse ,A) I like a thicker/chunkier sauce mainly,B) I wanted to save a trip to the store and C) I didn't wanna dirty my blender. My only slight is that the recipe as listed does not call for enough red pepper!But maybe we are just dragon-mouths in my house,I dunno...lol. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/reviews/Turkey-Meatballs-357009?cached=F&savedReview=true

My husband(who's a total novice in the kitchen) just made this for dinner with my help. Yum! The sauce is simple but tasty, and the touch of butter at the end adds a creamy richness that we both love. Add some meatballs to get great comfort food.

I've made this a bunch of times this summer, every time a success. Fresh tomatoes work even better I think, and only require a rough peel as they get blended up anyway. Bucatini is my favorite pasta shape, but gemelli works great as well. Feel free to skip the butter, it's fine without.

I love this recipe and use it whenever I need a quick dinner. I add a bit more crushed red pepper than called for but that is my only variation. Delicious.

Wow this was fabulous! Amazingly enough, in all my years of cooking Italian food, I never heard of San Marzano tomatoes that many others recommended. I did find them at my grocery store (Cento makes them). I took someone's advice and also added sugar and I left in some chopped basil. We're kind of heavy sauce lovers in my house and I was very pleased how well-coated the spaghetti was. My entire family loved it. My 12-year-old who is not a big fan of spaghetti, asked for seconds! Will definitely make again!

This was a great dish. Very tasty and fairly easy to make. The butter made it a little heavier than what I was looking for, but the flavor made it worth the while. I used angel hair when I made it from personal preference. That was not the right call. I should have followed the directions and used spaghetti or bucatini.

This pasta is excellent. I know some people gripe about changing a recipe, but I find the reviews are so helpful, and sometimes make the recipe taste better. I chopped my basil, and left it in the sauce. Can add more pepper flakes if you like it spicy! My fiance loved it, and he's Italian.

Great weeknight dinner recipe - definitely kid-friendly. Quick to make for the experienced cook, and a good introduction to the technique for the beginner. Can easily be dressed up for those looking for a bit more with a grilled chicken breast or some sauteed mushrooms but is lovely and satisfying as written with a simple salad on the side and a slice of crusty bread.

This recipe is wonderful. We are vegetarians, and it has become a staple in our home. For the meat-eaters, meatballs or chicken could be added at the end.

I forgot to add that I added more salt and parmesan. This is the real deal people. You go to Italy with this in mind and you will be well prepared. If you want the Olive Garden, this is NOT it! Go purchase some Ragu if you are after Olive Garden!

Seriously, WONDERFUL! I normally use marginal parmesan cheese because of the cost of the real stuff. This time, I made a Costco-sized purchase of the real parmigiano reggiano. Needless to say, from now on, THIS is my spaghetti recipe and I will only use the real parm! A humble dish that is truly exquisite!

This was fantastic! I don't know why anyone would think it was bland. I made it exactly as instructed, using San Marzano tomatoes and thin spaghetti. I used pecorino romano cheese, not parmesan. I'm not sure how the leftovers will be, but I will definitely be making this again soon. It was a very light and delicate sauce but SO flavorful, and it sticks to the pasta really well--really good.

I never make recipes exactly, but I love the technique of finishing the pasta in the sauce with butter and parmesan. It makes the sauce very smooth and rich--even when I cut the butter by half, like I always do. This is my new default method of cooking pasta with red sauce.

We LOVED this!!! Fresh, light and full of flavor. I did add some panko toasted in a little butter with garlic salt on top for a little crunch with pecorino cheese!

Very tasty! The butter addition is delicious. I used San Marzano tomatoes which I broke up with my hands into the pot and used a hand-mixer to puree everything together at the end. Definitely recommend as a make ahead.

Way less healthy than my usual homemade spaghetti sauce and way more tasty! I don't know if I can go back to my healthy version, so I almost wish I didn't try this declicious recipe!

Made this tonight for dinner & it was delicious! I prepared it as written except, based upon other reviews, my "pinch" of chili flakes was more like a teaspoon. The final touches of butter & parmesan definitely added to the overall flavor. Sauteeing the onion & simmering the tomatoes took a little time but it was a relatively small amount of effort for a great dinner!

This is an excellent recipe. My husband wants me to make it again! I followed the tips in the article: "Pasta starts with the saute pan not in the pot" Made all the difference in the world. As good as any restaurant pasta! Be sure to follow the tips in the May 2011 issue.

This one is very easy to cook. And it's really delicious. Try adding more than just a pinch of red pepper flakes. A pinch of it isn't enough. In the Italian restaurant that I frequent, they use capellini instead of bucatini or spaghetti, so I guess, you could use that too. I'm definitely going to make this again.

This recipe was delicious! I loved it because it was so simple. I had all of the ingredients on hand and it didn't take long to make (40 minutes start to finish). I disagree that it tastes like jarred sauce as other reviewers have posted. It tasted fresh and had a lot of depth. Make sure you have crusty bread to mop up the sauce! Enjoy!

I made this after seeing it on the cover of bon appetit. I was a tad bit skeptical, but decided that I would give it a chance. I am glad I did. This sauce is really simple to prepare, but packs a ton of great flavor. My husband and I are use to rich complex sauces, but we thought this was excellent. I made sure that the sauce was salted to my liking- would say that it was a bit more than "lightly" salted. This one is a keeper. Next time I will add more crushed pepper for an arrabita style sauce.

I probably over thought and over worked the recipe, but it was still fantastic! We have a combined family- 50% carnivore, 50% vegetarian- all LOVED it! Next time, I will add a touch more salt, and sprinkle some fresh, chopped basil over the top. Wish there were leftovers...

May be my new favorite. Yes, I think it IS! We used organic roasted tomatoes and I think that took up over the top. Can't stop eating it out of the pot on the stove.

I was really disappointed in this pasta. It made the cover of the magazine...it has to be good, right? Wrong. Maybe it was my fault because I listened to the "lightly salt" direction in the recipe. But it was bland and needed more salt. Also, if I were to make it again, I would probably saute the onions and garlic and then add them to the whole tomatoes and puree. I guess I am just used to a heartier, more flavorful sauce.

I almost feel bad reviewing this recipe since I have my Italian aunt's recipe for sauce that is easily the best I have tasted (I do keep looking with an open mind though!). I guess 2 stars seems like a bad rating, but the sauce definitely was "good". If you're used to canned sauce, the flavor you get from making this sauce yourself (even with canned tomatoes) will be pretty impressive. When I first made it, it was tasty (but it didn't knock my socks off), but the leftovers tasted a little different. I found it a little too oniony (and I love onions!) and the butter taste was more prominent. If you're someone who is used to the more Americanized tomato sauce, try this, it will be a huge treat for your taste buds. If you have sauce recipe you already love, this probably isn't going to replace it.

Not a favourite at our house - the sauce is a bit too acidic for the kids. We generally have parmesan toast with pasta - this sauce needs a more absorbent bread to soak it up. Smells great when you are cooking it but doesn't translate into a great meal

WOW!!! So simple but so elegant. Used Romano cheese as that is what I had. Topped with additional fresh basil and cracked peppercorns, as per this issue. Fantastic Good Friday meatless meal. My husband does the cooking and when he showed me this picture I was not too excited, I figured how good could it be? Well I am here to tell you that this is possibly the best spaghetti I have ever eaten! It was very simple, very delicate, and unbelievably delicious. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

I agree, so simple and so delicious. Definitely better than the average spaghetti. I used bucatini and really enjoyed the noodle in this dish. Also had to use dried basil as I didn't have any fresh. The butter and parmesan make the sauce creamy and delicious. It was addicting, it was hard to stop eating!

This pasta is amazingly good! It's hard to believe that such simple ingredients could turn into this rich sauce, but they do. I used pecorino cheese. I was tempted to throw some more basil in at the end, but the dish was fine without it (although, it never really hurts to add extra basil to anything!)
