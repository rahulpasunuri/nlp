I steamed the carrots but otherwise followed the recipe. They were delicious. Went well with the Moroccan chicken with eggplant, tomatoes and almonds (Bon Appetit Feb. 04).

I started making this recipe years ago when it came out in the magazine. It was a big hit a family gatherings, even from people who said they don't usually like cooked carrots. My mom makes it every year now that I've moved away. I love the combination of flavors but I do love cilantro. The carrots are great on not mushy. I highly recommend this recipe.

Ever since I discovered this recpe years ago, it has been my favorite way to prepare carrotst. Even my friend who doesn't care for carrots likes this recipe. The only change I make is that I use one-pound bags of baby carrots and skip the cutting/chopping step. I also love garlic, so I double the amount of garlic. Easy to prepare and delicious! I recently misplaced my recipe and am grateful to find it here.

I had this dish many times in the Middle East and never found the recipe. This is really good and really simple to make.

I love this recipe and prepared it several times over the last 5 years, almost all of our friends liked it too. I lost the magazine and now I'm glad I found it again, thanks to you!

We loved it. Very interesting and unusual combination of bright flavors. It was good served warm or at room temperature.

Yuck. I didn't like the combination of cumin and cilantro. The cumin was gritty on the carrots. I wouldn't make this again.
