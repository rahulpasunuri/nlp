This turned out beautifully. I made it on vacation and everyone in the house was addicted. I followed the recipe to the letter, but added a tablespoon of bourbon while cooking down the mixture, which I thought added an extra depth to the flavor. And I can't resist making a comment to the reviewer who "wouldn't touch" this recipe because of fat and cholesterol: no fair giving it one fork if you haven't even tried it! Either practice portion control or just move along, but don't skew the ratings.

Ah, butterscotch! How lovely! *Very* nice fatty sweet/salty flavor on this pudding. It occurs to me that the order of adding the yolks and cornstarch here is wrong, wrong, wrong. I made it tonight, heated the pudding up enough to thicken -- and got that grainy overcooked egg texture. I will try this recipe again using the classic method of heating the milk/cornstarch mixture to thicken, tempering the egg yolks with a dollop of the mixture, then whisking them in. I suspect that approach will take care of the texture problems.

This is a delicious recipe--my husband went crazy for it. I liked the unsweetened whipped cream and nutmeg on top, too. The only problem I had was with the pudding setting. I think I started out with the water not hot enough, so I think the pudding never got as hot as it should have (even though I left it on the heat for about 5 minutes longer). The recipe didn't say anything about heating to the boil, which I thought cornstarch needed to do in order to thicken. The final consistency is a bit runnier than I'd have preferred--next time I'll let it heat more.

I am the kind of person who prefers butterscotch to chocolate (call me crazy) and let me assure you this recipe is delicious. I reduce the cornstarch to 3 Tablespoons and cook it slightly longer - I've made it about ten times now, and always get rave reviews. The nutmeg and whipped cream are superb compliments, but I've been known to dive in without.

Tasted more like peanut butter pudding rather than butterscotch pudding. Wouldn't do it again.

Very rich. I enjoyed the process of making it, but I agree that less cornstarch might be a good idea. I am a diligent whisker, but the chilled pudding wasn't as smooth as I would have liked.

Too much fat and cholesterol? I made this using mostly canned lowfat milk, just a dollop of cream, and egg substitute. It was delicious. Smooth, subtle and creamy.

This pudding is to die for! We have had it many times at the Rosemont Cafe and are thrilled to be able to make it at home ANYTIME we want to!

This was fantastic! The accompaniments are very important, the whipped cream and fresh nutmeg make the dish.

This is, hands down, the most amazing desert recipe in my collection; coming from restaurateur/chef lineage, that number one spot is a coveted position (and a family debate). The texture, when cooked appropriately, is nothing short of heaven served up on a spoon. I have made this my signature desert, and to me, that says a lot. Enjoy!

And now for the sheepish correction to my prior comments! While the warm pudding was great, the chilled stuff we had for dessert last night was not. My sincere apologies for doubting those who complained of the weird texture, because mine did the same thing (despite being very creamy when warm!) None of my family liked it, and I now must side with the reviewer who is still looking for the perfect butterscotch pudding. I'm deleting this from my recipe box.

Are we even talking about the same recipe? I've made this several times and everyone raves about! Rich, delicious & very addictive.

The flavor was good, but I did not like the texture. The restaurant should consider submitting their absolutely wonderful breakfast potato recipe. I make sure I stop by to eat the potatoes every time I visit N.J.

I agree with the cook from new York that this is a bit gritty. I also thought that it took too much time to make. I like a pudding that is more creamy than this.

The pudding had a very nice flavor, but it was a little bit gritty in consistency -- I think because there is so much cornstarch. It just didn't have that real creamy mouth-feel you want pudding to have. I loved the flavor though, and the recipe worked well in the sense that the pudding set easily, etc. I am going to continue, though, on my search for the perfect homemade butterscotch pudding.
