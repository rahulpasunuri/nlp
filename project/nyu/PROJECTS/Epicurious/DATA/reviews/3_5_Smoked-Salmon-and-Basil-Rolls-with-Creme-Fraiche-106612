Given the fantastic reviews, I thought I would love this recipe but I didn't care for it. First, it was more difficult to assemble than I would have thought. I bought sliced salmon, but the slices were kind of jagged and just didn't roll up smoothly. And salmon, which is usually paired with dill, just didn't taste right to me with basil.

Fairly fast and easy to make. Served it as an appetizer before cantaloupe soup and the Ina Garten's roasted shrimp salad. All 10 people enjoyed it. Would definitely make again as written. Chill salmon and creme fraiche in the freezer for a few minutes before making rolls, then chill again before slicing. Made it much easier to slice without squashing the rolls.

Use the best ingredients necessary whether they come from the USA or France. And like it or not the French know about a thing or two about food and the USA, which I was born and raised in, owes a lot of their culinary history to the French. So Bon Appetit

Great taste, Light, impressive presentation. I used cream cheese because it was all I had but it was tasty -- I will definitely use creme fraiche next time to try it out! Enjoy!

Everyone loved these - easy to make; however I decided not to cut the roll into pieces as it got too messy. Will defiantely make again.

I've made the recipe as writen many times with success. I use goat cheese sometimes which is nice too.

I took the recommendation of many to use cream cheese instead of creme fraiche, and it worked wonderfully! I would also like to add a suggestion, prior to cutting the rolls put it in the fridge for a few hours, and it will make it much easier!

Everyone enjoyed this, and very easy to make. I used a mix of kefir cheese and sour cream (kefir cheese is much tangier) and it tasted great! The salmon was pre-sliced and not very neat so the rolls weren't as nicely done as the picture in the recipe. The basil toned down the strong flavor of the salmon. I will definitely plan to make this again!

I made this recipe as part of an appetizer buffet and it was one of the first to go. I used reduced fat cream cheese, which was soft and easy to spread, and I added finely chopped red onions. I found the rolls a little difficult to slice thin, so I cut them in half and stood them on end (like sushi rolls). Easy recipe, nice presentation and a crowd pleaser.

I made this recipe as specked --- I found a recipe for Creme Fraiche here @ epicurious. It was fabulous and so easy --- I garnished them with lemon zest and the were both beautiful and delicious! I recommend at least 24hour refrigeration - gives the flavors time to marry and the creme to set up so nicely. I served these slices on very thin toasted sesame crackers. BTW I like the idea of adding the capers and red onion from one of the other reviewers --- will definitely try that the next time I make 'em.

This was such a hit when my boyfriend's family came over for Sunday lunch last week. I prepared it the night before, and the overnight fridge-ing gave it a nice firm hold. I did use chevre -goat cheese- as it was more spreadable. And used the wet knife trick for cutting the rolls, as they were a bit mushy. The basil added a really nice bite to the saltiness of the salmon.

I used sour cream in place of the creme fraiche and found the rolls were hard to work with and difficult to slice. It was just too gooey and messy. I like the suggestion of chevre or some other firmer cream type cheese. I couldn't get large enough basil leaves so I simply ended up putting a couple of slices of a roll on the smaller leaves.

This recipe was simple, elegant and delish!!! Didn't use crème fraîche or sour cream, used cream cheese instead. Served it to company and everyone *LOVED* it!

This is a delicious recipe. I jazzed it up by adding red onion and alternating the basil with capers. Also, I used cream cheese instead of creme fraiche. All my guests were delighted.

7/13/02 (2 forks): Good, but it needs something changed. Don't know -- maybe cream cheese would be better for this recipe than creme fraiche? Or maybe the capers suggestion would be good. At least it's easy and looks good on the plate. 11/17/02 (3 forks): Much better with cream cheese -- more substantial taste and texture, and easier to handle. Didn't bother chopping the basil or adding more cream cheese and basil on the outside, since it seemed just great as it was. Can use capers in place of basil for another good variation.

De'lish!!! I forgot to check what kind of salmon I had before making this (assumed it was the slices) - instead it was a filet of smoked salmon... so - I didn't get to do the rolls. Instead, I assembled the salmon on top of the basil leaf & then topped with creme fraiche... really the best!!! I am still getting recipe requests for it!! Will make again and again...

All ingredients must be kept very cold, else the creme fraiche is runny and slicing difficult. When I make this again I will blend a soft chevre with the creme fraiche for the filling so it will stand up better, but still add a dollop of creme fraiche on top as the recipe suggests.

My husband saw the photo in the magazine and said how great it looked. This was a very easy recipe to make and while mine didn't look magazine-photo perfect, I wouldn't sniff at them at a party. I used a cream cheese/sour cream mixture. Next time, I'd probably use more sour cream to cut down on the sweetness. Makes a nice first course or small party dish.

Delicious -- Flew off the plate -- I would definitely make it again. I used sour cream and them topped the rolls with capers.
