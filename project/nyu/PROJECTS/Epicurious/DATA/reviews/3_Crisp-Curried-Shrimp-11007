Lovely quick weeknight recipe which is now a standard. We use more curry powder and red pepper, serve with sliced avocado and balsamic vinegar

This was not crisp but still really good!!I added a touch of green curry paste to liven things up a bit. Will definately make again.

It was okay, but not great. Required tartar sauce, and even alone wasn't very curry flavored. It needs something.

This dish is quick, delicious, and fresh. I used a slightly less amount of oil and breading and it came out fine. I rated this 3 forks because this is really more for a weeknight meal.

This is one of my favorite weeknight shrimp dishes. It's fast, it's easy and it tastes great. Don't use the kind of flour that's packaged for gravy, I think it's called "Wondra". I did recently just because I was too lazy to get the flour down from the top shelf. The shrimp still tasted good, it was just not at all crispy.

Came out okay, but I added more curry powder than called for, and used sunflower oil for sauteeing rather than olive oil. Mine had a crisp-ish coating; the color from the spices gives the shrimp an appetizing appearance when done. Olive oil is NOT the right oil to use for this recipe because it burns at a lower temp than other vegetable oils. Also, 2T is not nearly enough oil; I had a good 1/8" of sunflower oil coating the bottom of my pan. I would make this dish again, but would use this recipe just as a suggested method of preparation, and maybe experiment with different spices.

THE REASON IT DIDN'T RATE WELL WITH ME IS BECAUSE IT IS 'NOT' (in my opinion) the very best way to enjoy curry - or shrimp! Instead: SET THE SHRIMP ASIDE. Use all the ingredients listed - double the curry amount; add 2 eggs to this 'mixture', blend - THEN COAT THE SHRIMP! DEEP-FRY. Then you have shrimp that is crisp - great - with the flavors all incorporated into the 'batter'. Forget those side dishes of pasta; etc., just a nice pile of sticky rice - THE SHRIMP ON TOP, and a simple salad with a great light dressing (sesame dressing is complementary), and a WHITE WINE or heated SAKI makes for some good eating. Curry plus white wine or Saki is amazingly good..i.e. the flavors really compliment each other. NOTE: A salad using cucumber 'cools' the curry..another complimentary ingredient. Diane.

My shrimp didn't turn out crisp, but was very good anyway. I think it was because I didn't add any extra oil. I will definitely try again though.

I too added more curry than in the original recipe, but also thought it needed more zing (either cayenne or salt or something). I'd cut the scallions in 1-inch lengths. But this is definitely a keeper!

Great recipe. Followed our friends from Tucson's advice. Also would add a touch more curry. We had it with rice. Easy to prepare. Can't wait to make it again!

I make this dish at least once a month. My husband gives it two thumbs up. I've ajusted the recipe slightly. Saute the green onions and remove from skillet. Add 2-3 T. more olive oil and cook shrimp as indcated. Be sure to shake off exess flour before cooking shrimp. When shrimp are done return the green onions to the skillet and warm through. Linguine with marinara sauce makes a great side dish. Add a green salad and crusty french bread and you're set.
