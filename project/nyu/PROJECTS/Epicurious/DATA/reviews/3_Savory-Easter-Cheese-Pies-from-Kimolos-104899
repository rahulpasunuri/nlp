I tweaked it to make it more tastier. TRUST ME this is good for the pastry 4 cups bread fIour 1 teaspoon salt 1 large egg 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 to 1 cup warm water 1/3 stick of cold unsalted butter to dough cut in small cubes Olive oil for brushing pan 1 large egg yolk, lightly beaten, for brushing pastry for filling * 3 large eggs (could probably use a fourth ) * table spoon for fresh dill *1lb feta *1/2 lb manouri or any ricotta will do fresh ground pepper 400 degrees for 30-35 minutes until golden

From the previous reviewer, I expected these to be fantastic, but my husband and I both thought they were awful. I followed the recipe to a tee except that I halved it. The dough was very tough and the filling very bland. I love Manouri cheese and often eat it with honey and fruit. Perhaps I'll try these again with a short crust pastry.

WOW! These were fantastic! I made them as part of our Easter dinner, and everyone absolutely loved them. I have never made dough before, but this was very easy and consistent. The cheese was a little hard to find (I found the manouri cheese on igourmet.com and had it shipped, which worked fine) but well worth the trouble.
