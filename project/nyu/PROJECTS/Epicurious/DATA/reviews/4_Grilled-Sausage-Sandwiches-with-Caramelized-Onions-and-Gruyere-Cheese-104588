Sorry folks about my review. I thought I was commenting on the Gruyere grilled cheese with apple salad recipe in the September issue. That recipe is not listed yet. Be sure to try it when you can though.

This is an amazing recipe, but we did make a few changes. First of all, we used a wonderful seeded, multi grain bread and it added a great dimension to the recipe. Then, while eating it, we decided to add a bit of some multi berry pepper jelly. AMAZING!

Simple yet complex in flavor, a great combination if you're making dinner for my 85-yr-old dad who only eats meatloaf. Didn't have any caraway, but the rye bread I used had it in there. So easy. Takes about 10 min if you pre prepare the onions.

A great dinner for a "Saturday night in" or even for casual company. We used venison & pork pecan-smoked sausage from a local vendor, a really amazing beginning. I'll definitely do the onion treatment again and use the full amount as it melts down quite a bit. The onion mixture is over the top good, and I'm eye-ing it for lots of other sandwiches and to elevate grilled hamburgers to a new level. Placed mustard, onion and cheese on a toasted hoagie roll and slipped it under the broiler so that the cheese melted (plain old swiss, not gruyere I'll admit.) Served with an antipasto pasta salad. Dinner was great!

These are particularly good with TJ garlic nan - Then stick in the oven to melt cheese - open faced.

I like the comments about this being a dish of "great complexity and balance". Make the recipe as stated. This recipe dresses up ol' brats into something almost elegant and wonderful for the whole family! It's more like a very, very fancy grilled cheese sandwich. The combination of onions, red vinegar and brown sugar is surprsingly good. These onions would be great atop a steak or in any recipe with meat. This dish is definitely NOT hot dogs and please DON'T use ketchup! Whoever wrote that review missed the whole point of this recipe!

This recipe was surprisingly delicious! The whole family liked this and came back for second helpings. I will definitely make this again!

I really wasn't sure about this recipe to begin with... but my boyfriend has been begging me to cook brats for awhile so I tried this... I'm so glad I did! Wonderful! I omitted the butter and instead toasted the bread, assembled the sandwiches and then fried them in the onion pan until cheese melted.

OOPS!! Used Honeysuckle Turkey BRATS, not sausages for the review below. Sorry for the boo-boo. They still were excellent!!!

Had some Honeysuckle Turkey sausages I wanted to try, so I found this recipe. Hubby BBQ'd 2 of them until they were done. Meanwhile, I sauteed about 3/4 of a M/L onion in a little butter, added a shake of red wine vinegar, NO sugar, and about 1/4 tsp. of caraway seeds to the pan. Cut 2 six inch sections of baguette bread in half (lengthwise), and opened the sausage pieces as directed (except 1 brat per sandwich). Used a small amount of regular yellow mustard and Swiss cheese over the onion layer. Broiled this a few minutes until the cheese melted. Put the baguette tops on each sandwich, and they were DELICIOUS, and a lot less fattening and salty than regular brats!!! Served it with a green salad and it was a GREAT meal!!!

This was easy and relatively quick to make but it lacked deliciousness and veggies or at least something wet! I think this was just a flat hot dog, which I should have drowned in ketchup.

I made the recipe as given except for two things: instead of 2 pounds onions I used 2 onions (red); and I did not use butter, but cooked the sandwiches in the same non-stick skillet I used to cook the caramelized onion. I must say this is an extraordinary recipe, and will repeat it with the changes I made. Most unusual sandwich with great complexity and balance. Both I and my husband loved it, served with ruccola and tomato salad on the side.

I changed this a little by making the sandwiches open-faced, and using Italian sausage rather than bratwurst. In keeping with the Italian theme, I put some nice apple-smoked mozzarella on top instead of the gruyère, and I must say, it was very good indeed.

This sandwich is so good I'm going to end up looking like the Michelin man. This recipe had enough fat for me, so I didn't butter and grill it. Instead I toasted the bread and melted the cheese in the broiler.

Good thing I'm not Jewish or God would most certainly would have struck me down for making this this most non-Kosher of sandwiches on Jewish Rye. BTW, if you think this sandwich is good, try the Croissant Steak Sandwich from this site. It blows this one out of the water!

Quite possibly one of the best sandwiches ever concieved!

The only thing I would do differently next time is remove the pork casings from the sausages and handle them very gently while cooking to keep them intact. This is a delicious but MESSY combo and trying to bite through the casings made the sandwich fall apart. Absolutely wonderful flavors though! YUM!

THE ONLY sandwich to serve to my beer drinking football watching buddies! They request it for Apple Cup and Super Bowl when we get together and I love it so I must indulge them.

This is like one of those restaurant-style, messy, calorie-laden sandwiches. I used chicken sausage, gruyere, and rye bread. What I call good grubbin'!

Delicious! I used pumpernickle bread, a smaller size about 4"x4". This worked well because the sandwiches are messy. My husband loved it!

Used 2 Johnsonville brats (that I pre-cooked), only 17-1/2 oz. onion, and 2 bolillo rolls in place of the bread. While these sandwiches were VERY GOOD, next time I would cut the onion down even more to 12 oz., as I felt that they were too heavy on the onion. (Could they really mean 2 lbs. for 2 sandwiches??) Good combo of spiced onion, brats, mustard, and cheese. YUM.

Delicious! I used veal bratwurst and emmenthal cheese. I didn't have caraway seeds but the caramelized onions still tasted great adding just the right amount of sweetness. I would definitely make this again.

Simply put, this was awesome. Easily made 3 sandwiches, with some onions left over. Treat yourself to this one, you can't go wrong.

I've used various sausages for this and it's always good. I like to cook my sausages on the grill till they are crisp and splitting their skins. Ahhh so good!

I would definitely have this one again. Actually my husband made it. It is soooooo gooood! I didn't have Gruyere and used Muenster instead. Gruyere would have more taste. We had it on Hoagie Rolls that we toasted on the grill. This one is a keeper.

YUMMMMMMMMMM! Made these for a small football party, and every guy there loved them. I used an electric griddle to make the grilling and flipping easier, got a bunch done at once that way too. We've made them a couple of times since and will be a regular for our family. Oh, yeah, I used local deli brats, and the there is no comparison in flavor, the only way to go.

Very delicious. My onions took longer to caramalize though. I also did a variation of this simply using the onions and cheese on toasted baguette. I brought this version to a fondue party and they made an excellent appetizer. Enjoy!

This is the best grilled cheese sandwich EVER! Pub style! It is a most blessed combination of onions, mustard & gruyere (stop salivating). The sausages are a nice touch as well... Also, definately pair these sandwiches with a nice ale & it doesn't hurt to bring along an artery de-clogger... ENJOY!

It was absolutely delicious. My only complaint was having to wait so long for the onions. However, the tastes melding together made it worth the wait. The combination of the mustard and Gruyere was divine. I think it would also make a great gratin topping.

Excellent! I used a cast iron skillet and had to use a pretty large spatula to flip the rascals, but they turned out great! You bet I'll make this one again.

I made this for lunch on a camping trip, and my husband *loved* it! (He also liked the idea of a beer with it, said it really made the flavors mix well together). It's easy to do, extremely filling, and a great camping dish! I carmelized the onions in an electric wok on the picnic table, so the camper wouldn't reek! We will make this one again and again~

This sandwich was a hit and so filling. I did not use all the onions that the recipe called for and it was still as good. Will know to add them next time. This is one I will do again and again - it was so easy!

A real hit at our house and sooo easy. I used the full recipe of onions for 2 sandwiches.

MY HUSBAND AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!! I USED RED ONIONS INSTEAD OF YELLOW AS MY HUSBAND PREFERS THE RED. WILL DEFINETLY MAKE THIS AGAIN.

Yum. I'm going to try both red and yellow onions to see which is better.

Our wonderful in-laws in NH served this to us this past weekend and it was "delish"!
