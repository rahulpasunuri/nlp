This has become a standby veggie side dish when I can't think of anything else. It's best when I follow the recipe, but is plenty tasty without the zest. The almonds truly enhance it.

Very good recipe. I added a small amount of sliced shallot, omitted the almonds and it was still delicious! I will keep this recipe and make variations. Maybe add julienned red bell pepper. Great to serve with fish and oven roasted potatoes. Nice presentation!

I debated whether I could give a simple vegetable dish four forks, but my husband thought it was worth it! This is surprisingly good and pretty, as others have mentioned. I will make this again, especially for a dinner party.

This was easy to make, pretty on the plate, tasted great, and is good for you. What more could you ask? Even my husband, who does not like zucchini, loved this.

A refreshing and different zucchini side dish - also very pretty on the plate. Definitely a keeper!

Even though the zest and almonds were left out due to timing of dinner...it was a nice side dish. We will try it again with the zest and almonds soon.
