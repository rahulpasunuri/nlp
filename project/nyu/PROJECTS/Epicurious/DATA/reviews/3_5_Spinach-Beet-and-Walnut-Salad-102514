The dressing was disappointing. The olive oil was too heavy for the beets and there were way too many shallots. I suggest using less shallots and substituting the olive oil for a lighter oil. Also, salt and pepper to taste.

This is a great Christmas salad. Better though if you double the dressing and marinate the beets in 1/2 after cooking them. Very tasty.

This salad is a terrific combinatgion of complimentary flavors. I halved the beets and tossed them with some olive oil, good balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper before roasting them. I also sauteed the shallots in 1 T of olive oil before making the dressing and used 1/4 cup additional oil instead of 1/2 cup. Also, added about 1 t of sugar to dressing. Served it alongside a salad of mesclun tossed with dried cranberries and smoked duck breast.

I took this recipe to a church potluck and got lots of compliments on it. The bowl was emptied fast because it was so pretty in a clear glass bowl. I used juliene pickled beets. It was so fresh and good. thank you.
