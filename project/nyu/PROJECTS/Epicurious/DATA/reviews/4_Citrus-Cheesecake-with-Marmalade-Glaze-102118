I prepared this cheesecake for a citrus themed "Iron Chef" competition and won first place! I followed the recipe as written except I substituted King Arthur Flour's Fiori di Sicilia flavoring for the vanilla. Used Dundee brand 3 citrus marmalade, and garnished with homemade lemon and orange citrus peel around the edges. One of my competitors had thirds! Make it; you'll love it.

The three citrus flavors made for a great cheesecake. The crust amount was not enough as mentioned by others, but it didnt seem to matter if it covered the sides completely. It still unmolded easily. The marmalade added a nice finished look. I had some preserved strips of orange peel that looked good. This raised up like a souffle scaring me that it would overflow, but didnt and did sink down after a few minutes.

Am a chocolate lover but decided to make a change. Made this recipe for a special dinner. Absolutely decilious! Made a standard graham crust but added the lemon & lime zest plus lemon juice. Also, added a tsp of lemon & lime zest to the glaze. Wonderful. *Almost* everyone loved it: Must admit that a 7-year old at the party preferred the brownies. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this with a chocolate wafer crust, and felt that the combination of the chocolate crust with the citrus was really perfect. To the crust, I added some orange peel and a touch of Grand Marnier along with sugar...to the filling, I added some lime juice and extra lemon and lime zests. The result was really delicious. No need for marmalade on top; instead, I served with whipped cream and raspberries and optional Grand Marnier. This was a nice, light, and refreshing cheesecake dessert that was surprisingly sophisticated.

My husband's favorite! I make this with a graham cracker crust and leave off the marmalade glaze. Delicious!

This cheesecake is delicious, not too sweet. And everyone loves the crust. Since I have a lemon tree in the backyard, I used a lemon blossom to garnish (slipped its stem into the symmetrical three-pronged crack that developed in the cake's top during the baking). Beautiful.

I love this cheesecake recipe! It is my husband and I's new favorite! I definately recommend increasing the dough recipe by one-half or even double it. I top mine with a raspberry/sugar mixture that is slightly thickened with cornstarch. Wonderful!

This is a fabulous cheesecake. Light and creamy, and a big hit with everyone who tried it! My husband doesn't care much for cheesecake, and he ate two slices! I did add another half recipe of crust as other reviewers suggested, which was good advice, but the crust was a little overdone after 15 minutes - watch it carefully! I twisted one orange slice on top in the center, and circled the edge of the cake with fresh raspberries, and it was beautiful!

I made this cheesecake for a cheesecake & coffee tasting following an annual membership meeting. It got rave reviews. I made it with a graham cracker crust (on bottom & sides) but did everything else according to the recipe. It's a lighter cheesecake than others and the glaze really makes it. I didn't think that the citrus got stronger -- it still tastes as good as it did when I made it 4 days ago.

I hate orange marmalade, so that topping has never made it into my cheesecake. But I've been using the filling part of this recipe as the base of all my cheesecakes for years. I've topped it with blackberries, with lemon curd, with fresh raspberries glazed with black currant jelly. I've paired the cheesecake with many different crusts too - gingersnap cookies, shortbread, Lorna Doon cookies, chocolate grahams - and they've always turned out wonderful. My friends rave that I make the best cheesecake they've ever eaten. I say I just have a solid recipe and a flair for invention!

Very good. Just serve it well chilled or it tastes too sweet. I too found not enough crust to put up the sides.

This was incredible!! My husband proclaimed it the best he'd ever had ~ he absolutely loves cheesecake and gets it at every restaurant we go to, so that's saying a lot! As suggested here, I added more to the crust ( x 1 1/2 ) and I also substituted a mix of fresh berries for the marmalade. Yum!

I tried this on a special occaison. My guests loved it! Rave Reviews. Add a little to the crust. On a 9 in springform i found it a little thin.

I have made this cake twice. Once for my 24th birthday, where it was a big hit and once for a dessert competition at a work party, where it won first place for best tasting! It has a lovely citrus flavor, but it can be overpowering if you let it sit for a few days. If you know you are making the cake well in advance, cut back on the rind. If you are making it for immediate consumption, use what they call for or even a tad more, as long as you know there won't be leftovers!

Great, tasty cheesecake recipe...was a huge hit...only problem was while preparing the crust: didn't seem to have enough to come up the sides of the pan...will definitely make again

Not only would I make this again, I am making it again and again and again. I made this for the first time for New Years Eve---everyone loved it. They asked for the recipe! I'm making it for a luncheon-it is truly delish!

Wonderful recipe! Cooking time of 55 minutes was adequate for me. I decorated the cake with orange slices and topped it with the marmelade and on top of that added lots of chopped mint! The mint added the extra touch, would definitely recommend that!

This doesn't have to be a summer recipe! The cheesecake is deceivingly light because of all that citrus flavor. I ended up cooking the cake much longer, about 1 1/2 hours, because I thought it wasn't setting enough, but I probably could have taken it out sooner and hopefully refrigeration would have firmed it up. I used 2 packages of regular cream cheese and one of low-fat.

Wonderful citrus flavor, and the mint is the perfect garnish. First baked cheesecake I have made that actually cooked through and had good consistency, although the cooking time was almost double the recipe. Even the crust worked well. Eat as much as possible the first day -- after one day it absorbs even more citrus flavor.

I made it exactly as written and it worked wonderfully. Relatively easy and foolproof. It looks so nice it's suitable for holidays. And the citrus flavors make it great for summer, too.

I made this for the first time for a party, and received rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Since I have made this several more times and just sit back and watch it vanish. It's easily made ahead and finished with the marmalade glaze and a simple orange twist that will leave everyone thinking it came from a gourmet pastry shop!

I couldn't find any tangerine-orange marmalade in my local store and used a cheap orange one instead. It was still delicious.
