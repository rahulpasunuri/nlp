I never would have thought of adding cream cheese to scrambled eggs, but it makes them turn out tasty. I leave the beans out of the salsa and use tortillas instead of taco shells.

I was looking for something fast and healthy to make for dinner last night, and don't often think of eggs...I picked up a fresh tomato salad and cilantro at the little gourmet shop on the way home, and added to it the bit of corn and edamame I had left over from dinner the night before. Also, I wisked in the cream cheese (instead of the dolloping) and added some red pepper flakes for kick, and rolled in a whole wheat tortilla (I always keep a couple of packages in my freezer...oh, I also used a little olive oil instead of the butter). This recipe is not going to garner you any awards, but it will get you in and out of the kitchen with something tasty to show for it.

This was good, easy and fast. My picky teenage son and his friend even liked it. We added a bit of shredded cheddar on top and some sour cream on the side. Will definitely make again.

This was declicious and fast (a great combo). I used flour tortillas instead of taco shells, though tortilla shells would probably be good, too. As for the authenticity, I like what 2/21 said: call it "Eggs Fred" and make the recipe. Don't miss out on this great recipe because you disapprove of the name.

I made this last night and it was a very quick and easy supper when it was 100 degrees outside, and getting out of the kitchen fast was most important. Maybe a lot of Hispanic people would bash this recipe for not being "authentic". (What is that??) I did not have cream cheese so I substituted 3 Tbs. no fat sour cream plus a scant 1/8 cup of grated Parmesan. The egg mixture generously filled 6 normal size hard taco shells. Topped with the salsa/bean mizture, this was OUTSTANDING!!! A definite remake. (P.S- this recipe does not resemble "migas" in any way, since one does not cook tortilla strips with the eggs.)

Since MIGAS was mentioned several times in the many reviews this recipe generated, I decided to look it up. This is what I found -- www.texascooking.com/recipes/migaswfreshtort.htm -- I have to admit that the recipe for MIGAS does comes very close to the Mexican Scrambled Eggs but with a whole lot more interesting ingredients. It calls for such delights as avacado, green chiles, fresh tomatoes, grated mild cheddar or Monterrey jack and of course, fresh (flour) tortillas torn into pieces and then sauted until softened. My approach will be to take the best of both recipes and then some.

I think this recipe was wonderful and my boyfriend loved it also. Why are mature adults fighting over a recipe? If you don't like it just say that instead of stooping to petty name calling.

The personal insults are not necessary for recipe reviews people !!!!!!!!!!! Keep your comments to the receipe (taste, simplicity, ingredients, etc.), anything else is just not necessary.

Wow, some of you are vicious. I guess you bashers wouldn't be caught dead with a quickie tex-mex recipe like this. I haven't tried it yet but have been collecting variations of migas to experiment with. I cook for large groups (25-35) in a primitive setting, on a budget, and always have an eye out for easy recipes. And I never get uptight about the recipe not being authentic. That's what we cooks are for. If we want easy but authentic, we make a few basic changes. If our families like the recipe the way it is, we don't listen to the bashers. If we want super authentic, we search out some more recipes. What's with all the snobbish outrage? Go boil some water.

As a chef, I can safely state that only "Mexican" aspect of this recipe is the notion of salsa, cilantro, and beans. As for the cream cheese, no go! A true mexican application would be sour cream not cream cheese... This is like calling something "Greek" by the mere addition of feta cheese and/or olives...very un-original!

Okay! So who has THE traditional recipe for spaghetti & meat balls? You people really make me laugh! And who has THE tradional recipe for meatloaf? It all goes back to our moms & what we consider "traditional". sigh This is a variation on "migas". OKAY?? Let's not lose sight of what is important here! Good food & an attitude of adventure when it comes to food. sigh! I think I need some fresh air!

I have had a dish very similiar to this in Houston. The people I worked with were Mexican and they made this dish on a regular basis, however they do not add beans nor do they add cream cheese(I think I would leave those out too). They do add jalepenos and large corn chips and it's called MIGAS. It does wonders for hangovers. Goes wonderfully with black beans and rice on the side.

I am generally somewhat of a self-proclaimed food snob, but wanted somethng quick to serve to my partner. we were both pleased with the results. i added a few touches (lime juice, corn, green chilis). For him, it was reminiscent of food he'd had while living in New Mexico.

This is hilarious. I haven't even made the recipe yet, but had to add my two cents! I'm going to make it and I'm sure my boys will love it! What is wronge with "easy" or "from the back of the bottle"? Every recipe has it's place. Why are we all wasting our time typing on the internet about recipes?

Another cook said, "This recipe is not a mexican one. I am mexican and owner of a culinary school. We don´t use cream cheese, nor butter and not even "taco shells"..." That's like saying "we don't experiment, cut corners, run out of ingredients, or ever change (or improve) A SINGLE THING about our "authentic" cuisine. Get over it. I also prefer to add some fresh ingredients to the mix, but you're talking to someone who thinks that scrambled eggs with some American cheese in it is a passable super-quick meal, and who knows, American cheese might not be authentically "American" for all I know. ;)

It seems to me that the problem people have with this recipe is not the ingredients, but with the name "Mexican" scrambled eggs. For crying out loud! Call these eggs "Fred" and get on with life! Make it or don't. I liked it! (left out the cilantro).

I thought my family would like this, but instead they LOVED it. I followed the recipe, only adding freshly chopped tomatoes and ensuring everything was seasoned properly. It's a winner for us (and a quick weeknight prep!).

I guess if you add enough fat scrambled eggs are terrific. I thought this was a fantastic and simple dinner.

I also agree with Denver. This looks like a good quick recipe. I have professional training in culinary and I admit that I will look at a recipe and if it looks too basic I may skip over it (but thats just one of MY hangups). Since Gourmet and Bon Appetit are not professional industry magazines, I think people reviewing should keep that in mind. How do you start bashing a recipe before you even make it. This recipe calls for purchased FRESH salsa. Not from a jar. Take it easy everyone. Make it yourself if you want! I could bash people who don't make their own stock. Who cares!? We all dont live in the city where fresh ingredients are avail all year long! Also, most food here in America has been Americanized - Chinese, Mexican, Italian. Do you think they're eating chicken fingers, nachos, and mozzarella stix for dinner? We're the melting pot! Don't be intimidated. Relax, cook, experiment, have fun with it!

This is a perfect recipe for everyday meals, and great for cooks who are beginners or a bit timid in the kitchen. For cooks looking for an over-the top, razzle-dazzle weekend dish, I'd reccommend they pass this one by, and not bother reviewing it. I spent some time in Mexico, and I loved all the versions of "Mexican Scrambled Eggs" I ate at various locations, so this recipe caught my eye. It's true that this wasn't at all like any I had eaten, but since I cook every day and wanted something new, I opted to try this dish. I found the recipe easy to prepare (since all of the items in the recipe were already in the fridge or pantry) and quite tasty. I used up some leftover salsa and homemade tortillas from the night before. My husband and brother liked it very much. I gave my brother the recipe, thinking that my sister in-law (a very novice cook) could give it a try. She used the ingredients she was comfortable with (canned beans, prepared salsa from the deli, tostada shells) and got rave reviews. Her cooking confindence has increased, and she's now asking for a "good salsa recipe to go with the good egg recipe". That, in my opinion, makes this a great recipe. -gina

Phoenix, it's called 'migas' and it's awesome. I'm married to a...I call him a juan-a-be...cause he's 1/2 mexican and doesn't even speak spanish for goodness sakes. But, I make Migas every saturday morning, it's a fav of mine. You can add a little minced garlic to the oil when frying the tortillas and it's so great...yum!

Not bad for a quick breakfast or supper. Needs some doctoring. Just call it southwestern eggs. Keep up the good work Denver in putting the food snobs in their place.

Kudos to Denver for putting all those negative reviewers in their place. Since when does "simple" equate to "terrible"? I am an accomplished cook (professionally trained and even do some catering on the side) but I am always happy to find something qick and easy that I can throw together without too much ado after a long day's work. You can always take a basic recipe and "doctor" it up to your own taste. If you have no constuctive comments, please refrain from making any at all.

Denver, your comment is one of the best I have read on this site. People forget the beginning cooks, or those who just don't want to deal with a complicated recipe. And what is wrong with simplicity? Whenever I need a laugh these days, I check out the recipe (and the comments) for boiled, salted water. Now, there's something you can get creative with!

Keep in mind people that most "mexican" food we eat in the US is NOT by any stretch Mexican. It's either gringo-ized or Tex-Mex, and that's what this is. While I agree that you should add sausage, chorizo, onions, etc. not ALL Epicurious recipes are meant to be super-fantastic-knock-you-out dishes! Some of them are meant to be simple to prepare, taste good (while not being complex in flavor), and quick. This is one of those that a single mom with little money, or a beginning cooking student (i.e. your kid wanting to try making something for the family that ends up edible) could manage that would still taste good, but be simple, quick, and overall CHEAP to prepare. It's not beyond Epicurious to give us simple dishes that we can add our own "jazz" to. And while it's not inherently Mexican, neither is most food you eat in the US, so get over it! I would rate it highly for being simple, easy, and cheap as well as nutritionally sound at the same time. So don't knock everything that's "easy", "simple" etc. It just gives us a way to add our own spice of life to a basic dish. And remember - most every recipe out there is merely a food suggestion with ingredient suggestions added. Few foods that the average person can prepare (and AFFORD to prepare for that matter) do NOT fall into those above categories. So add your chorizo, onions, bell peppers, home-made beans and warm tortillas. Change the cheese! It's in doing this that we take a simple recipe and turn it into our very own phenomenon. Enjoy!

Actually, those of us nearer the border would first fry chorizo sausage, drain the grease, and add the eggs. I would also add onion and peppers by heat. Instead of adding cheese to the eggs, top with Chihuaua cheese, cliantro and hot flour tortillas. Serve alongside refried black beans and spanish rice. Salsa is ALWAYS on the side of everything.

Hey, I grew up in the Midwest and we do NOT put cream cheese in scrambled eggs. Nor does anyone in Mexico, I imagine, and for good reason. Skip this dish...all the previous reviews describing it as dull, bland and tasteless are right on the money.

This is worthless. Authentic mexican eggs are made only of fresh ingredients such as onion, cilantro, tomatoes and jalapeños. It can be served with 'refrito' beans on the side and tortillas. Lucky these are not Ranchero eggs.

I made this receipe for my office. Everyone loved it! It was delicious and so easy! Being a mother of a two year old and 3 month old I liked the fact that I could get a homamade taste by using the fresh salsa. I used a peach mango salsa from Cosco of all places. I also tried it using a jar salsa, Paul Newman's Chunky tomato and roasted garlic which had an excellent as well. After I cooked the eggs I mixed the salsa with the eggs. I put them in a crock pot on low and everyone had breakfast burritos. Of course for the people that have the time you can always make your own salsa and cook your beans. This receipe took me about 15 minutes from start to finish. I also used the flour tortillas.

It is a pity that this dish, with "taco shells" can be considered mexican just by using canned beans, bottled "salsa" and cilantro. Since when cream chesse is "mexican"? Good "mexican" scrambled eggs should have fersh copped ingredients as onion, tomato and jalapenio or serrano chiles with refied beans, with chorizo if you like, on the side.

I was born and raised in Mexico. It's very unfortunate that Epicurious truly thinks that you can prepare a Mexican dish by opening up cans. The trick to Mexican cuisine is doing things from scratch, including cooking the beans and preparing the salsa. What a pity ...

Isaac? Is that REALLY you? As a devout low-carb eater I must say this looks like a wonderful little dish to try - and with that chorizo especially! I'm tingling all over with the anticipation of making this tomorrow morning! Gotta get the chorizo out of the freezer. Wouldn't it be nice if there was nutritional information on these recipes?

I substituted Jack cheese for the cream cheese and used slightly less cilantro, as my family is not crazy about it. I also used small flour tortillas and made mini breakfast burritos. My kids loved them!

Forgive me for being on of those cooks who says, "actually I completely changed the recipe," but... the thought of putting eggs into a taco shell is not appealing. Instead I tore strips of corn tortilla and toasted them first in the pan. Then I used Monterry Jack cheese as i found the cream cheese too sweet. Add the eggs and follow recipe. Never salt eggs before you cook em. Does something weird to the protien. I served with salsa and oven roasted taters...yummy. Cilantro on the side as not everyone likes it. Go figure.

5 eggs plus extras for only 2 servings? I love eggs, but that's rather extreme. I'd try this for my family of 4 (especially if served with other dishes as well). Some fresh fruit, good bread (Mexican, if possible) and coffee with cinnamon for a great breakfast?
