For a cake that is moist and delicate in texture, this one is perfect, but I was a little disappointed that it wasn't more flavorful. I expected a stronger pumpkin and spice flavor, instead I felt it was a little bland. I added ginger as another reviewer suggested, but if I were to make it again, I think I would add a little more cinnamon and maybe nutmeg, as well. As for boosting the pumpkin flavor, more pumpkin could be added if the buttermilk is reduced, but trying to find the right balance would be a pain. I think I would just try another recipe instead.

Fabulous recipe that I will make repeatedly. I wanted something vaguely spicy, and my changes certainly did not compete with the wonderful pumpkin flavor. It came out very moist & pumpkin-y, with small overtones of the spice - perfect to have with tea or coffee. My changes: Swapped 1/4 of the white sugar for 1/4 c dark brown, Added 1/2 tsp each of cardamom, ginger & nutmeg, plus 1/4 tsp cloves. Also increased the salt to 3/4 tsp. I skipped the icing and don't feel it needed it, but icing might be pretty for presentation.

Tried this recipe a couple of weeks ago for a Cake Walk at the kids' school. (Did not change a thing.) It looked so good the family that won it started slicing it up right there. Many, many compliments. It was moist, tasty and delicious. Making it again today!

This recipe has become a regular in my fall baked goods. I have also made this a number of times into birthday cakes and wedding cakes for others and it NEVER fails to get rave reviews (including from people who don't like pumpkin). I actually don't add any extra spice. I follow the cake recipe exactly and it is alway flavorful and super moist. I confess however, I almost never use the icing recipe. I am not partial to drizzled icings and I choose to pair this cake with a butter cream. However, it is wonderful just by itself and a cup of coffee!

Great, low-key recipe. Super moist; more like a coffee cake. The cake is definitely better the second day, however, the icing is not. If you expect to eat it over the course of a few days, try icing it in portions as you go. I sprinkled sliced almonds on top for some crunch/texture.

This was a big hit all around. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the cinnamon and allspice and I added 1 teaspoon each of ginger, nutmeg and cloves. I also replaced 1/4 of the white sugar with light brown sugar. Finally, I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg to the buttermilk frosting and was very careful to add only a tiny bit of buttermilk at a time to get a good consistency for drizzling.

Rating: 3
Loved the cake. The moisture level was perfect if you followed the recipe. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the icing. I will not repeat it as is and will try some of the suggestions from other reviewers. I too added other spices such as ginger, nutmeg and cloves, doubled cinnamon and omitted allspice.

This cake was nearly perfect. It was a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. One girl who doesn't typically like anything pumpkin raved about how good this cake was. For my spice I didn't double like many others--I simply used 1 and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, and I took the salt up to 3/4 tsp., which I ALWAYS do with any spice cake, often a full tsp. if the sugar content is higher. I also took the sugar up to 1 and 1/2 C. and used a mix of both white and brown. For those complaining about moisture, are you sure you didn't dump in the entire can of pumpkin? I can't figure out what else would have caused this for you. I opted not to use the buttermilk glaze and just go with my own brown sugar/caramel frosting made from scratch. It is a perfect cooked frosting that compliments banana and spice cakes very well. It was the perfect pairing with a cake that was very soft and not too sweet.

Very good bundt cake! People...if you used a whole can of pumpkin, no wonder you had problems with the cake being too wet and not cooking thoroughly. The recipe calls for 1 1/4 cup of pumpkin, not a whole can. I found the cake to be perfectly moist , mine took about 55 minutes to bake. I doubled the spices, added cloves, nutmeg, and ginger. For the frosting, I added a little cream cheese, butter, and maple syrup to original recipe. I couldn't help but try a slice warm and it was very good, looking forward to some for breakfast to see if the flavors meld together even more.

Love this cake, perfect for fall! Made the following modifications: DEFINITELY double the spices (as many others have suggested) and a pinch of nutmeg does really well =) Also, I had it in the oven for about an extra 20 minutes more than the suggested cooking time - and it was perfect! Also as recommended by a few others, great idea to put about 3/4 of icing on while the cake is still warm and save the rest for when you serve it. Also add much less buttermilk than asked for in icing, make JUST thin enough to drizzle over cake, if it is thick don't worry because it will melt. Sooo delicious!

I doubled the spice upon suggestion of other reviewers and baked about 10 minutes longer (checking first after the specified time) and the cake turned out just right. Moist and tasty. My husband (chief tester of the house and lover of all things pumpkin) said it was delicious. I'm going to try a different icing on the second go around (for Thanksgiving) because I thought the icing needed more flavor (I added a bit of molasses the first time, but it didn't really do much but change the color). Definitely a nice alternative to pumpkin pie if folks don't care for that but love pumpkin.

I made 8 individual sized bundt cakes and cut the cooking time by about 10 mins. The single sized cakes were perfectly moist. In addition to the cinnamon and allsice, I added a bit of nutmeg, and to the icing I added a bit of cream cheese and increased the amount of buttermilk a tad. I brought them to work and my co-workers absolutely loved them.

Made this cake for a lovely fall dinner party...it couldn't be more perfect for this time of year. The 5 adults and 6 children at the party ate the entire cake, with all the children requesting a second slice. I used full-fat buttermilk and will try low-fat next time. I doubled the spices as suggested and added a pinch of clove and some freshly grated nutmeg. Absolutely delicious, and beautiful presentation. Loved the frosting as well.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving in a silicone bundt pan. Unfortunately, I left half of it in the pan when inverting. Not sure what I did wrong b/c the cake was definitely done. I was able to reassemble it and the next day, it was delicious. I also made a pumpkin pie. It was nice to have both options.

I baked this cake in a rectangular bread pan and it baked in my oven for 45 minutes. I omitted the all-spice and used instead ginger and cloves. Otherwise followed as stated and thought it was wonderful. Moist and very tasty. I think it would have looked prettier in a bundt pan and will use that next time. This is a wonderful fall recipe.

looks like the reviewer below didn't know what she was doing... you don't need to compare this bundt cake to pumpking pie. this baby is in a league of its own. not too sweet and full of flavor, it's simply delicious. i'd warm it up for a few seconds in the microwave if you aren't eating it straight out of the oven. this bundt cake was SO TASTY! usually you think bundt cake, you think dry brick. however, done right, this is one of the best tasting cakes i've ever had (bundt or otherwise). the first time i made it, the middle was still a bit moist but i left it in longer on the second try. everything really depends on your oven conditions and you have to experiment until it works for you. i'd highly recommend trying this recipe out and if at first you don't succeed, bake again

I just made this. And to say the least, it was awful. The cake, the icing, everything was just gross. If you are considering making this recipe, stop for a second and ask yourself if you want to ruin your appetite for the day. If you answer "no" to this, well than do NOT bake this Bundt cake. Here are the reasons why I despise it: 1. The cake was so soft, after baking for 50 minutes that, you could form it into little balls and such. 2. The icing was straight up gross. I tried to see the positive side of it, but I really couldn't. 3. IT stunk. The smell, was just, nasty. So just, don't bake this. It's a waist of your time and energy. This almost ruined pumpkin for me. So if you do go ahead and make this, beware you may never eat pumpkin pie EVER again. XO E

ummm...no. 1 1/2 sticks of butter IS 3/4 cup (6oz). 3 sticks of butter is 3/4lb. there are 4 sticks of butter (4oz - 1/2cup each) in a lb (16oz) so each stick is 1/4lb - 3 sticks would be 3/4lb. Hope that helps...

Just a note that the recipe calls for 1 1/2 sticks or a 3/4 cup of butter. 1 1/2 sticks of butter actually equals 3/4 lb -- an actual total of 1 1/2 cups of butter. Having not made the recipe yet, which quantity is correct? Thanks!

Based on the comments below, I doubled the spices and I'm really glad I did! I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg too, but I forgot to add ground cloves (I'm sad about that). The cake was moist and delicious, but I was a little disappointed by the glaze - it didn't taste like much. Overall, I would make this cake again but I would find a better glaze.

This cake got rave reviews on Thanksgiving!! I used almost the entire 15oz can of pumpkin, and doubled the spices and added a pinch of cloves and nutmeg as other reviewers suggested (thank you!). One thing I would add is that the icing is much more translucent than it appears in this picture. I used 3/4 of it at the time the recipe suggests, while the cake is cooling, and reserved the rest of the icing in the refrigerator, topping the cake just prior to serving. Made it look much nicer, while also penetrating the top of the cake. I will definitely make this moist delicious cake again.

I agree that it could have been a little more spicy... I did add extra spices. I LOVED the simplicity of the icing and the slightly tart flavor that the buttermilk gave it. I like the idea though of adding other things to the flavor spectrum and garnishing with things like cranberries and pecans.

Great recipe but I did up the amounts of spice and added a dash of nutmeg and cloves. I also soaked a cup of golden raisins in rum and added a diced apple which made the cake very moist. No need for icing, served warm with a dollop of whipped cream. Family loved it!

This had a nice texture, but it is too sweet and too bland. If you want to try it (it is a good way to use up leftover buttermilk!), double the spices. I won't be making it again, though, as there are better pumpkin spice cake/bread recipes out there.

I've made this cake at least 5 times since I discovered it after Thanksgiving this year. I double the spices and add nutmeg and a pinch of cloves. The only time it wasn't perfect was when I was careless about measuring the buttermilk for the icing and used too much--it needs to be just barely thick enough to drizzle over, and then it will stay white and harden properly; otherwise it seeps into the cake and makes it soggy. This cake keeps very well for several days, and is better on the second day. You can put the whole thing together in the time it takes to cream the butter and sugar, so it's less than an hour from start to taking it out of the oven! I love this recipe.

Loved the cake! HAVE THE BEST GLAZE tweak - add a teaspoon of maple flavoring to the buttermilk and confectioners sugar, it smells and tastes delicious! For the cake, I doubled the two spices called for, then added a tsp each of cloves, nutmeg, and ginger, and then added more nutmeg. I also added two snack sized boxes (not the tiny ones) of raisins, and had friends over, it was a HUGE hit. Even my 16 year old, who says she doesn't like nutmeg, loved the cake . It was moist and really a wonderful fall/winter treat! Use the maple flavoring, it is far, far better than just normal vanilla, and it goes with it completely. I also felt the size was fine, and did not need to double the recipe. Everyone loved it, will make it again and again! Great cake!

This cake was a hit for Thanksgiving. I made the following changes, thanks to various other reviews: 1. used more spice than indicated 2. added ground nutmeg, ginger & allspice 3. added vanilla & cinnamon to icing 4. garnished with pecans & dried cranberries The cake turned out moist, flavorful, and well-spiced. I loved the icing, though it wasn't as white as pictured. Garnish improved visual appeal and added textural contrast. Next time I will try using more pumpkin, to enhance the flavor, and will bake in a 9" bundt pan. The 10" is a little larger than necessary, so the cake comes out looking short.

I came across this recipe in my search for recipes to use up my Hallowe'en pumpkin, and am I ever glad I tried this one! I used fresh pumpkin puree from my month-old pumpkin. I followed the advice of others and added a 1/2 tsp. each of cardamom, ginger, nutmeg and cloves as well as the cinnamon and allspice, which enhances the natural flavours of the cake, but is not too spicy for the delicateness of the pumpkin. I used 2 eggs, mainly because I only found two when I looked in the fridge, but one less egg did not affect the texture of the cake at all. Also, I do not own a bundt pan(I will have to fix that one day), so I baked the recipe in 2 5x9 loaf pans, for 40 minutes, and they came out perfectly. I will definitely be keeping this recipe handy to use up all the pumpkin puree stored in my freezer!

I made this recipe as written (except used my own pumpkin instead of canned). It was good. Moist. Delicate. Not overly sweet. I only used about 1/2 of the icing and don't feel that the icing added anything to the flavor of the cake except sugary sweetness. Next time I'll either omit the icing, or try to find something that complements the cake better. I might also add more spices -- for a "spice cake" there was no noticable spiciness in the finished product.

Rating: 4
I made this for a company cookout, and everyone LOVED it! The cake itself isn't too sweet and the icing tops it off wonderfully. I did almost use a whole can of pumpkin, I realized my error when I was mixing in the buttermilk. Good thing you mix the pumpkin separately first. To correct my error, I just increased the buttermilk and vanilla by half, and left some of the pumpkin mixture out when mixing it into the batter. I know, it's wasteful, but I wanted to make sure my proportions were spot on with the recipe. Anyways, I let it bake for a little over 40 minutes, and it was perfect. Very moist and fluffy. Definitely will do again!

I am a big fan of anything pumpkin - especially a pumpkin cake or bread which is made without oil. WHY does every recipe have oil in it?! bleck. This cake looks beautiful. It tastes even better.

This is a good cake as is, and I give the original recipe 3 forks. It's even better with the additon of the following spices: ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, and cloves.

Excellent texture; moist and rich without being leaden (sifted the flour prior to measuring). After reading other's reviews I doubled the spices and added both black pepper and cardamom as well as golden raisins marinated in Gran Marnier and chopped walnuts. And, glazed it with an intensely orange glaze. Glad I did. Even with all of the extra spices, it was still fairly tame. As per other reviewers, I also doubled the recipe to fill the bundt. After doubling the reved up recipe, I had enough left over for 6 cupcakes. Great for cupcakes.

I made this cake in a pumpkin-shaped bundt pan, skipped the icing and used dulce de leche (caramel) instead.

the cake came out nicely about 4 inches high. i recommend jolting the bundt pan once the batter is in, though, because mine had a lot of air pockets in them due to the fluffy texture of the batter. i took other people's recommendation and upped the spices, which i'm glad i did. because the icing didn't get rave reviews, i went for the ginger cream cheese icing from this website. came out with a nice color contrast with the dark cake and good complement.

i have issues with white flour and sugar, so i substituted equal parts whole wheat flour and brown rice flour for the all purpose flour, and used honey in place of the sugar. as previously suggested, beefed up the spices. for icing i just drizzled a bit of honey, but it doesn't actually need it all - this cake is marvelous! the pumpkin flavour is gorgeous.

I have made this twice in two weeks. Just a simple, great tasting, easy to make cake. The first time I made it as directed and it was 3" tall. It felt a little short for my needs. The second time I doubled the recipe, baked it accordingly longer, and it was over 6" tall...and looked much better. Made either way, the second day tasted even better. Very moist, and lots of pumpkin flavor. Give it a try.

Very good breakfast/snack cake, will probably get better over time as the recipe says. I don't taste the pumpkin much, but it does make for a moist spice cake. Raisins or nuts would be very good add-ins. I did not make the icing, it's quite sweet as is. Do let it cool for the whole time listed, you need to do that with bundt cakes. Finally, you DON'T need an electric mixer, just some arm power, if you're able. Less clean-up that way!

This is a perfect cake for when friends drop in over the weekend! I like a spice cake with lots of flavour so I increased spices to: 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, 1 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg. This is now a favourite - but will try adding in some golden raisins or pecans next time.

This was a great cake, very moist and not too heavy. I also beefed up the spices, as suggested, and it was lightly spiced and flavorful- even better on the second day. I think if I make it again I'll add even more spices; I don't think there's such a thing as "too many spices" with a cake like this. It got a little soggy after a few days, but next time I'll try freezing some.

Delicious, but I did make some substantial changes: increased pumpkin to 1.5 cups, decreased butter to 1/2 cup, decreased sugar to 1 cup, substituted one cup whole wheat flour for one cup of all-purpose flour, added moist raisins, ground cloves, ground nutmeg. I used the maple cream cheese icing from another page of this website. All in all, a huge hit!

I will make again, maybe for christmas.

It was okay. Mostly a disappointment. It was so bland. It really doesn't live up to "Spice" in the title of this dish. I doubled the cinammon and vanilla as others recommended, but this cake really needs cloves and nutmeg to be a success.

This was easy to make and yummy - followed others' advice to add more spices (definitely were needed) and waited to ice it until cool. It felt like a lot of icing for the cake and it did get absorbed into the cake after a day or 2 but my family loved this, kids included!

Absolutely delicious. I took the advise of other reviewers and added more of each spice the recipe called for. I also made it 3 days in advance and was a bit nervous it wouldn't be fresh. It was incredibly fresh, moist, and flavorful. I added chopped walnuts which added a nice crunch.

This lightly sweet, very moist cake goes wonderfully with coffee or tea! I did add one quarter teaspoon of ginger and cloves to the batter, and the overall spice turned out very nicely. I've had this cake around for three days now, and the flavors do continue to develop while it stays moist. Wonderful!

This is the kind of dessert I enjoy after a heavy meal. A touch of sweetness, subtle flavors that dissolve the strong flavors of the dinner. Perfect with coffee and relaxing. This was excellent as is; I loved the drizzled-on icing--it made it "fancy." When others say the spice flavor isn't strong enough,I wonder when they last replaced their cinammon,etc. I would definately make this as a coffeecake for a luncheon or oneg shabbat.

Not sure it's worth the extra effort. Maybe get a spice cake mix and add a can of pumpkin for a similar taste. Measurements for the glaze seem way off -- as others have noted. Less sugar, for sure.

This cake was outstanding. I wouldn't change a thing.

This was very easy and very delicious. I agree with the other reviewers that additional spice would be good. I think I may just use 2 1/2 t. pumpkin pie spice next time. My husband took the cake to work and it got rave reviews! I will definitely make this again.

I made this lovely cake a couple of weeks ago, and plan to make it again as one of our Thanksgiving desserts. Its velvety texture is moist and great. I agree with most previous reviews, the cake would benefit from some additional spice. In addition to fresh ground nutmeg, I plan to include some finely minced candied ginger in the batter. Also, cut back on the buttermilk for an icing with more body, otherwise it does run all over the place!

Perfection! I was looking for an easy but impressive dessert for a dinner party and stumbled across this tasty holiday cake. It is a nice change from the usual pumpkin or pecan pie. Also great for dinner party b/c it could be prepared in advance (actually much tastier that way) and iced just before serving. I followed the advice of others and increased the cinnamon and allspice amounts in the cake and also added some to the icing. Gave it a nice spicy kick. Cake was such a hit at the dinner party I made it again for a Thanksgiving potluck at my office and it got rave reviews. Had several people ask me for the recipe. It is THAT good folks. Would also try this in mini muffin tins, so that you get more icing per bite. Great as breakfast the next day too!

I made this for a pre-thanksgiving potluck I held (early start on having leftovers, right?) and it was a smash. I'm making this again tomorrow to let the spices develop in time for Thanksgiving, instead of a pumpkin pie. I added a tablespoon or so of eggnog to the icing, in addition to the buttermilk, so the taste of eggnog (and its great spices) was present, but not overwhelming. I had problems w/ icing consistency too, but will take heed of suggestions and try to make it "icing" tomorrow, instead of translucent "glaze". I also wonder how this would be poured into cupcake pans? Would it dry out too much?

A delicious cake for the season! I'd give it 3-1/2 forks if I could. Based on previous reviews which said the cake could use some spicing up I used the following: 1-1/4 teaspoons each of cinnamon and ginger; 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg; 1/4 teaspoon allspice; 1/4 teaspoon cloves. Also, if you don't want the icing to seep into the warm cake, just wait as I did for the cake to cool then drizzle on the icing! I also used a little vanilla in the icing as helpfully recommended by others.

This was as good as everyone said. I also added choped candied ginger on top of the icing (to which I had added cinnamon as well).

What can I say but yum, yum, yummy! This is the perfect pumpkin cake; it is dense, moist, fine crumbed and so delicious. The pumpkin flavor is very pronounced, but then again, I roast fresh, princess pumpkins and puree them. Contrary to popular belief, fresh roasted pumpkin IS tastier than canned (but of course, canned will taste just fine). I did double the cinnamon and add 3/4 teaspoon ginger which is perfect. I also added a splash of vanilla to the icing...divine. Enjoy!

This was quite a good, moist cake. As per other suggestions, do double the cinnamon and the vanilla. I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla and a good shake of cinnamon to the frosting, then mixed it as the previous reviewer suggested. It should still be very thick, then just press on it a bit with a spatula and it will eventually ooze down the sides. A big hit with kids and adults!

I have made this cake twice within a week. It is very straightforward, tasty and appealing. To achieve the result shown in the picture, add buttermilk (unmeasured)directly and gradually to the sugar, stirring until a very thick, barely pourable consistency is achieved. Drizzle carefully over the cake, so as little as possible drips onto the plate and most of the icing remains on the cake. It will then appear thick and white as shown. Delicious!

This was inhaled by my guests and my family. I added some cinammon to the icing, as it was too bland without. And I sprinkled candied ginger on the top as well. Ground ginger would be a good addition to the batter, and do let the cake sit for a day or two: it gets denser and much more flavorful.

As the other reviewers have noted, the cake does not really resemble the picture for mroe than a couple minutes because the icing seeps into the cake and turns translucent. However, this makes for a wonderfully moist cake, and you can improve appearances by layering the icing in multiple applications. Next time I make it I will also add a little vanilla extract to the icing, otherwise it really just tastes like a slightly sour sugar glaze, sort of bland. Also, I replaced the spice that the recipe calls for with a tablespoon of Penzey's "cake spice." This imparted a lot of flavor without being overwhelming.

Great cake! Not too sweet. Doubled cinnamon & added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg & 1/2 tsp. fresh ground black pepper. Everyone raved. Will definitely make over and over.

An addition that just puts this over the top. I add a large handful of Craisins (sweetened, dried cranberries) to the cake. It adds a nice chewy zing to each bite.

This is very good! I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and doubled the cinnamon and vanilla, added some freshly grated nutmeg. Made the cake a day or two ahead so the flavors could develop as per the recipe, but I made the icing and put on the cake just a few hours before serving--hardened nicely and was very pretty. I may add vanilla and maybe either a bit of nutmeg or cinnamon to the icing itself next time--it might take it to the next level.

As most other reviewers have written, this cake is wonderfully moist and easy but is too bland as written. I doubled the cinnamon but it was still bland. Will try again with 1T cinnamon, plus allspice and ginger (or maybe we need to remove the word SPICE from the title). One of my children requested that I add golden raisins next time, too. It is better after sitting a day, but the icing looks bad by then. Would suggest letting it sit overnight and icing an hour or so before serving.

Very good recipe, easy to prepare. I added about a cup of miniature chocolate chips. This was a nice, moist bundt - I'm anxious to taste after 1-2 days. I suspect it will be even better tomorrow!

Wonderfully moist and delicious! Husband and kids proclaimed it the best recipe I've tried in a long time. I just added a little more cinnamon and 1/4 t ground cloves for a little extra spice and it was excellent!

This is truly one of the best fall cakes I have ever tasted. I doubled the vanilla (2 tsp) and the cinnamon (2 tsp), and added 1/2 packed teaspoon of fresh grated nutmeg. Convection baked at 325 for exactly 45 minutes. I loved the moistness and texture. I also used sifted cake flour to make it lighter and airy. Next time I'll add a cup of chopped pecans to the mix! Great recipe!

Great recipe! Very nice to just "whip up" when you need to. The family didn't want to wait for the icing (they ate it warm from the oven) so I can imagine how great it would be if it had icing on it. My six-year-old daughter asked for piece in her lunchbox everyday until it was gone!!

Loved it!! Very moist and flavor great. I substituted ground ginger for the allspice, and threw in a pinch of nutmeg. For the icing, I added about 1/4 - 1/2 c more buttermilk to make it more "drizzly" and it hardened up very nicely on the cake. Will definitely make this again!

I would make this recipe again. It is very moist and great in the morning with coffee or for a afternoon snack. However I did not put the entire amount of allspice that the recipe called for, I wanted more of a pumpkin flavor. Also, it does get better the longer sits, but the icing does not harden as in the photo, it melts into the cake. Walnuts might be a good addition to this recipe too.

Very moist, excellent cake, would be perfect with tea or coffee. I substituted 1/4 tsp of ground ginger for some of the allspice. I agree that the spiciness is subtle, but I think increasing the spices too much more would completely overwhelm the pumpkin flavor which itself is subtle. For more spiciness, there are other spice cake recipes. By the way, by covering the cake in an airtight container and letting it sit a day or two, as recommended (and I agree), the icing pretty much melts into the surface of the cake,it doesn't 'harden' as the recipe indicates. I suppose one could make the cake ahead and ice it closer to serving. If anyone is thinking that the icing will be sour due to the buttermilk, it isn't, the sugar takes care of that.

I would definitely add some additional spice to this recipe. It definitely improves with each day but it needs a bit more zing.. Very moist and delicious..
