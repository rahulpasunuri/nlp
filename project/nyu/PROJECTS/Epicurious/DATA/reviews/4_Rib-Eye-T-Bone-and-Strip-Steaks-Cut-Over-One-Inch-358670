Followed the recipe exactly but it only took 10 to 15 minutes to cook the steak to perfection.

I used steaks that were cut 1-1/4" thick and cooked them for 8 to 9 minutes per side to an internal temperature of 120F. The temperature went up to about 127F after resting for about 10 minutes covered with foil. The steaks were removed from the fridge about 20 minutes before cooking. They were absolutely perfect!

WOW! Made this for Father's Day with oregano, thyme and marjoram. It was a hit with everyone. Should have taken it off the grill sooner but it was moist and flavorful. I didn't skip a step but note you could get away with the dried herbs as well. Just let the basting sauce marry for a little while.

Fantastic.....used fresh Rosemary and dried oregano and sage. Also, had enough basting for 6-7 steaks. One warning.......no way should this be grilled for as long as mentioned. Needless to say, mine did not turn out med-rare , but still very moist, and uber tasty!

Fantastic! Whole family loved the herby twist on plain grilled T-bones. Now I can make it for guests with fillets. Used all of my newly-emerging, post winter herbs: rosemary, marjoram, thyme, sage. Threw the board dressing ingredients into the same blender that had just mixed the baste - fast, easy, same flavors.

The savory herbs are usually thought of with pork, poultry, and game. It was a delightful surprise to use them (I chose rosemary, thyme, and oregano - all fresh) with red meat - such delicious results! And the rib-eye steaks, not one of my favorites, became a totally and pleasingly different taste experience. We enjoyed these steaks immensely. This is a recipe I will certainly use again and will also try the same or similar herbs with other cuts. It was with hesitation that I tried a recipe from a barbecue cookbook, but I am very glad that I did. An excellent meal was the result!

It is the best steak recipe of all time BUT be careful because I got really scared by the flames. They were sometimes out of control. Thank god, i was not the one who was grilling because i would have panicked. The recipe is so simple and it is so good! You should try it. Oh I didn't bother with the board dressing.

I was a little concerned that the reviews were over-stating the recipe. Had this tonight with another couple and everyone loved it. The flavors were perfect. We did thick steaks for the guys and thin steaks for the ladies and it was great. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I used fresh rosemary, sage, and oregano (b/c that's what I grow). Minced the garlic and added to the herbs and oil. Very delicious.

Really good even though we got distracted, which ended up in an overcooked steak that didn't get basted as much as the recipe suggests. Even taking that into account this was borderline amazing, and despite the fact that the meat was pretty close to well done, it was still pretty moist. Can't wait to try it when we're paying closer attention to what we're doing. I predict that I won't have to wait long to try again. As an aside, I used a mixture of rosemary, marjoram and thyme for the herbs. Perfect combo.

We whipped this together easily and it was delish. We cut down the cooking time but other than that we stuck to the recipe. It's a keeper as my husband would say.

I used fillet mignon and it was delicious! I was only serving two so I cut back the proportions. Used rosemary and flat leaf parsley, as this is what I had on hand. Skipped the board dressing and used leftover base to top the fillets after they came off the grill. Based on previous feedback, I lowered the heat on the grill to low so as not to char the outside of the meat to the point of bitter. Overall, a no-fuss tasty meat prep. Will certainly use again!

Unlike previous review rating the picture quality, I will rate the recipe. Excellent prep, although 20-25 min was nowhere in the neighborhood for my grill (much hotter apparently). Great 'crunch' on the outside and very juicy interior (partial to rare steaks, myself). Read: "Cook to desired doneness"
