The recipe yields a nice sweet and sour flavor but I found it too vinegar-y (even after adding extra sugar to counter it). Also, it was a bit watery so I added some pectin. That jelled it up nicely....

Yum! Made it when I had a surplus of peppers from a farm share. Worked great - loved it with chili, and even canned it and gave as gifts. Will definitely do again.

I doubled the mustard seeds, using half a teaspoon of yellow and half a teaspoon of black. Will deffinitely make this again.

We were given some wonderful mangoes from a friend's tree. I made the relish but omitted the tomato. Diced the almost-ripe mangoes and added them during the last 5 minutes. It is great with b.b.q pork chops or grilled chicken. I also used half red wine vineagar and half wuite vinegar. It's a recipe you can play around with and use whatever's available.

We have used this recipe several times and its good! We usually exchange the green pepper for a yellow pepper (more flavor?). Depending on what we are going to use it for, we sometimes use 3/4 cup white vinegar and 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, it adds a little zip. By the way, this makes a great pasta sauce.
