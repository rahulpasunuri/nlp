Made these for my husband who eats them while in Italy and LOVES them. I didn't follow the recipe exactly as I was going more for the 'suppli' which has the red meat sauce inside the balls. But they were amazing and I will definitely make them again! A lot of work but totally worth it!!! YUMMY!

Hand these made with fresh buffalo mozzarella; the risotto was made with lemon peel, white wine, fresh lemon thyme and plenty of Parmesan. It was served on a pool of fresh marinara. Exquisite!

I loved this recipe. I used both fonina and mini bocconcini; when I tried them after deep frying the fontina was much better because it melted and the bocconcini did not. I then froze them and reheated them right before my party at 375, 15 min for the fontina and 18 min for the bocconcini and they both melted and were delicious!

I am never that impressed with these when i make them, but that probably comes down to personal preference. Though I mostly followed this recipe this time around, I added a few variations which I think resulted in a more-delicious-than-usual rice ball. I used brown basmati rice which I cooked like risotto along with a mushroom herb packet I had leftover (from Trader Joe's mushroom risotto), then added in half and half and cheddar cheese. Cooled and used a cube of sharp cheddar for the interior but otherwise did everything per the recipe and served them with store-bought marinara. They were a big hit and seemed more flavorful to me than the traditional recipe. Nonetheless, I only make these if I'm trying to use up ingredients, as they bore me. Ha!

i made these for my culinary teacher, and he loved them. i agree that they were bland, and the tomato sauce really needs some spices, but all in all they were soo good and they were adorable too

These was fantastic. I found that they browned in the oil in about a minute or two and the cheese in the center did not melt. I put them in the oven at 350F for a couple minutes and they were perfect.

Very labour intensive, but worth the tasty results. I used regular bread crumbs seasoned with Italian seasoning, and that definitely added flavour. I suggest doubling the recipe a freezing the leftovers. I've read arancini freeze well.

This was fabulous! I was intimidated at first, having only eaten arancini at restaurants and never made them at home, but they were a major hit at a cocktail party. My tips: don't use plain risotto (I used pea and Parmesan), give yourself enough time for refrigeration, which I found was key. I pan fried in a combo of olive oil and vegetable oil, which worked perfectly. Time consuming, but very rewarding!

Made this for my 5 year old's birthday dinner. SO delicious. I added grated gruyere to the risotto, and used a heavy hand with sea salt (it needed a lot!) and it was delicious. I also cooked the tomato sauce for quite while to thicken it, and pureed it in the food processor (since I used canned diced tomatoes-- this isn't the time for chunks). Also, use cheap olive oil for frying. It smells better and is much healthier. I will definitely be making this again.

Good and easy recipe, though I would recommend using a flavorful risotto as the croquettes can be a bit bland on their own. If I were to make this again, I would make a basil risotto or mushroom risotto as my basis and go heavy on the fresh herbs--zest would be a nice addition as well. All in all, however, a solid recipe.

These were an excellent use of leftover risotto, although a bit time consuming to make the first time around. I found that sticking them in the freezer for about 20 min. after assembling was sufficient. It should be noted that my risotto had been refrigerated and was somewhat cold when I began. Also, I found that about 3 inches of oil was sufficient in a smaller sized pot. Very satisfying dinner with a green salad. I will definitely make these again.

Tasty Appetizers that were great for my dinner party because most of it can be done a day ahead. Will definely be making these again.

thought I messed them up many times but I think I just had subpar risotto to start with (my own fault). had to freeze risotto balls briefly to get them firm enough to roll in flour, egg, and breadcrumbs. once that was done, however, they fried beautifully and hubby loved them. (more importantly, I did too.)
