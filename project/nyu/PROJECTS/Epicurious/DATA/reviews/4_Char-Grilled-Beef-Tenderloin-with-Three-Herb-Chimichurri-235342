so good and the chmichurri was a hit! did not change anything (and i like to change things)...

This was great. Nice presentation and everyone loved it. For the chimichurri we substituted basil for cilantro because one of our guests doesn't like cilantro. It was delicious but I think it must be even better with cilantro. Next time. We made the rub with regular sweet paprika instead of smoked and it was delicious. This was my first time grilling tenderloin so I followed the recipe exactly. It came out almost perfect - on the rare side of medium rare.

phenomenal and can be used on almost anything: steak, pork, chicken, even fish. I add one seeded jalapeno for some kick!

Excellent recipe! Made it with flat iron instead of tenderloin so I could throw it on the grill, get a quick sear, and pull it off medium rare--delicious! Other than the cut, I tripled the black and red pepper after tasting, which gave a nice kick but not too much.

The rub is very good but I reduced the salt by half as the first time it was super salty. Have not done the herb chimichurii yet but will at some point as I like that style of sauce. We make ours more well done and it was still like buttah. A keeper!

Hmmm not sure what all the rave was about. My husband and I found the recipe to be simply ok. We are not big vinegar fans and so I cut down on the vinegar which unfortunately, still overpowered the sauce. Oh well.

I make this recipe all the time for bbq's. I find grilling whole tenderloins is easier and better than individual steaks for a crowd I often grill thin cut chicken while the meat is resting. As for this recipe, I like to do two whole tenderloins, in case someone does not like the rub. I always use three cups of cilantro and two of parsley in the chimichurri, as we prefer the cilantro flavor. I also make the roasted red pepper habanero salsa (from a rib eye recipe on this site) as a second sauce. The whole thing, tenderloin and sauces are always a big hit. I make this several times per year during grilling season and always to rave reviews!!!!!

The first thing my 12 y/o daughter said was "this tastes like beef jerky", lol. Seriously, it kind of did! It just had a strange flavor that didn't do much for us (me, wife, daughter). I've tried MANY recipes from this site and some are great, but this just didn't do anything for me. Also, the chimicurri tasted a bit too much like freshly cut GRASS. I'm in Miami where we have many churrasco restaurants with chimichurri to die for....this was not one of them. The only thing I can think may have been responsible for this recipes high ratings is the fact that no one has been to an amazing churrasco restaurant like El Novillo (YOU HAVE TO GO THERE IF YOU GO TO MIAMI!!!!!!!!). Oh well, you win some you lose some :P

My whole family loves it. I make it all the time. It's good for everyday because it's easy and good for dinner parties because it's sophisticated.

We had this for New Years Eve for 10 people. It was simple and easy. Everyone enjoyed the taste. I would suggest the serving of Chimichurri to be on the lean side as the rub on it's own was great and you don't want to take away the flavor of the meat. Perhaps a spoonful on the side would do. We served it with a parsnip puree and wild mushroom saute. An excellent course that gave the taste buds an amazing journey. This is a do over in a heart beat. FYI...I took the tenderloin off at 115 ish and let it rest without the foil for a good 25 minutes and it came out great. My fear was taking it off at 125 and then tenting it and over cooking. The searing keeps the meats nice and warm while it rests. From Canada!!!!

Served this alongside Lobster Bread Puddings with Vanilla Chive Sauce for an excellent "surf and turf" - The two recipes complemented each other perfectly! I put leftover chimichurri sauce as a base for pizza and also on crostini with melted goat cheese served with first course salad.

Made this for the first time last night with a lovely tenderloin we bought and froze from Ralphs a few weeks ago (1/2 off!). The rub was very tasty and easy (ground it together in spice blender and used a little ancho and chipotle powder). The sauce was great, made a lot. Used basil as the store didn't have mint and opted for Italian parsley. We cooked it on a gas grill with the cover down, putting it on the center cool grill and only heating the grates on each side. This would be great for a dinner party!

Excellent chimichurri sauce! Served it with grilled chicken and baked potato! Easy & versatile sauce!

This is excellent. We served it for a birthday party and everyone loved it. The rub gave the tenderloin great flavor and the chimichurri is delicious (also for leftover sandwiches). Served it with cumin scented potato salad and fiery grilled shrimp also on the website. Used tenderloin but would be good with any beef. Definitely would make again.

"Outstanding"...my husband can't stop saying that! We used the chimichurri with a flank steak...fab! Then we used the rub and sauce with grilled chicken breast...awesome! I used regular chili powder and paprika...still great. Would definitely serve to guests. Easy to make, very refreshing, great flavor profile, all-around wonderful dish. Highly recommend.

This was the first time I had this type of sauce and I was very pleased with the outcome. The contrast between the rub and sauce really highlights the taste. Using paprika, regular salt, plain old chile powder, and Ribeye steaks were my only changes. This is a recipe I will keep for summer time cooking!

Rating: 4
This was a sensational dish I made, and my husband cooked, for 4 house guests and us. Everyone raved about it. The chimichurri sauce, which sounds too strong, actually brought out the delicate flavor of the tenderloin perfectly. Very important part of the directions: check the temperature often, and when it's almost 130, take it off and let it rest the whole 15 minutes.

This was a big hit at "grill night" at our pool. I used flank steak, sweet Hungarian paprika, and Aleppo pepper, and I did add a hint of coffee per one of the reviews. The rub was delicious and had a wonderful depth and complexity. I didn't exactly measure the herbs in the chimichurri and omitted mint, and it was a great compliment. Everyone asked for the recipe.

Rating: 4
This is great. I made the sauce the day before and it was great. I baked in the oven instead of grilling and it as super. I used the left over sauce as a marinade for orange roughy and it was out of this world. This recipe is a keeper.

THIS WAS EXCELLENT. MAKES A TON OF SAUCE WHICH I USED TO MARINATE CHICKEN BREAST THE NEXT DAY AND STILL HAD SOME FOR DIPPING.

We subbed skirt steak for the tenderloin due to the astronomical price at a retailer that shall remain unnamed, but all I received at the dinner table were satisfied "mmmm"'s. I gave it 4 forks because it was as easy as it was delicious. I added a bit more garlic and used basil, but still kept about a half cup of fresh mint, which I guess made it a 4-herb chimichurri. It made for a delicious holiday dinner (initially had thought tenderloin would be more holiday-ish, but the price was more Scrooge-like), served with sweet potato fries and the carmelized shallot mashed potatoes (also found on Epicurious, my saviour!).

What an easy, showy and delicious meal. We used our own fresh herbs and friends raved. The sauce was saved for other grilled dinners. Will make this one again

Loved this recipe...esp. the chimichurri. My husband wasn't sure about it at first, but I think he would eati it on anything now. Also, one friend is not a red-meat eater, so I used the same rub on a chicken breast for her and she loved it! As long as you have a meat thermometer and a food processor I would even classify this as an easy recipe.

Rating: 3
Would definitely keep this recipe in my box and prepare again! Has a great BBQ flavor. I was expecting a lot of heat but it was mild enough for the kids to eat and enjoy (second/third helpings). I did not give this a 4 rating&I think a 4 should be reserved for the true exceptional recipes.

Someone mentioned added depth of flavour to the rub. I threw in a handful of dark coffee beans to the spice grinder along with whole dried chilis. People are still raving about it months later.

LOVE This. Family loves it - even my little kids. Have served it now several times to guest and everyone always asks for the chimichurri recipe. Its spectacular with the tenderloin, but pretty good on less expensive cuts as well. We freeze the chimichurri and use it on steaks all summer long. Not as good as fresh, but pretty good when pressed for time during the week.

I made this with flank on the bbq and everyone in the family really ejoyed the chimichurri

Wow! I used flank steaks, and made the chimichurri with basil instead of mint as suggested earlier, as well as extra cilantro. Grilled the steak at a picnic and took the sauce...a huge hit with my guests!

This was really good! Loved the spice rub, used it on boneless NY strips, and the meat was really flavorful. Will definitely make this one again.

Very tasty! We loved the Chimichurri, which i had to make with basil instead of mint- still tasted wonderful. I added the grated rind of the lemon I juiced. Liked the spice rub but I might play around with that to add more depth of flavor- still quite good though. I almost made it into a sort of mole rub. This was my first attempt to grill a beef tenderloin, and i was grateful for some instruction on that as I didn't want to ruin such an expensive cut of beef.

Rating: 4
A wonderful recipe! I used it as a "formal" Cinco de Mayo main dish and everyone raved about it. I served the tenderloin with rolls so that guests could have a sandwich of sorts. I did make small slits in the tenderloin to insert garlic cloves so it was super-tasty with the rub. I also had enough sauce to add to sandwiches for the rest of the week!

Wonderful and easy. A huge hit. Worked well on the BBQ. Great for company.

This rating is only for the chimichurri sauce. I chose this recipe because of all the rave reviews, but I do not think it was worth the effort. It tasted like parsley puree with a hint of cilantro. It didn't taste bad, but it did not enhance our grilled rib-eye steaks in any way. My husband tasted it and opted not to eat it. I only ate it because of the time I spent making it.

This was so tender and a wonderful taste. It was easy to make. We will make this again.

I actually ate the chimichurri sauce with a fork straight out of the fridge the next day. Roast was a big hit with our friends. I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer, mixed the leftover sauce with Greek yogurt and marinated chicken in it. Even my toddler gobbled it up. Fantastic.

I made this recipe for a New Years Eve party and it was a huge hit. It was easy to prepare and had great flavor. I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely make it again!

We made this for a recent party sliced up and served on baguette slices with a dollop of the chimichurri and it was a huge hit. The butcher recommended that we substitute top loin for the tenderloin to save some $ and it was outstanding! In fact, the spice rub was not necessary.

I made this dish on the BBQ for a dinner party. Easy to prepare and presentation was impressive. Excellent for a big group. The Chimichurri sauce is to die for & all my guests were raving about this recipe! Suggestion: Bring the sauce to room temperature before serving.

This is now my standard company dinner. It is great on the Bar-B-Q (as written) in the summer, and also works fine in the oven for the colder months. I couldn't find smoked paprika, but found hickory smoked salt, so I just used regular sweet paprika. It has just the right amount of "kick" and is very flavorful. There wasn't one bit left over!

I used the chimichurri sauce with grilled lamb chops. Very delicious.

Rating: 4
This dish is amazingly delicious and easy to prepare! Rather than the tenderloin, I used 4 filet mignon's and they grilled beautifully. The chimichurri sauce is delectable! As far as I'm concerned, there's no such thing as 'too much chimichurri'... I added it to Greek style yogurt and made a fabulous marinade, using both chicken tenders and lamb chops. Yummy!

This was wonderful. Easy cottage recipe. Chimichurri sauce is also a fab addition. It makes too much sauce, but freeze in ice cube tray for future use.

I made this recipe for my husband's 40th birthday party and both it and my cake (another Bon Appetit recipe from 10+ years ago) were the talk of the evening. I used a 4 lb roast and doubled the spices in the rub. Amazing! We are doing a repeat performance tonight for a few friends.

This was sooo good, although it makes far too much chimichurri sauce. I am now addicted to smoked paprika.

Just lovely! I used porterhouse steaks, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. We loved the smoky-sweet rub against the cool freshness of the chimichurri sauce. The herbs were well-balanced and the heat from the pepper flakes was welcomed. Make this recipe and don't change a thing.

My guests LOVED this! I served it with a grilled corn recipe from the same issue of Bon Appetit: grilled corn with mayonnaise, queso fresco, lime juice and a dusting of chile powder. People were in heaven.

This is an excellent recipe for a party! Like the other reviewer, I made this recipe with a vacpac tenderloin from a food warehouse. It took a while to trim to the right size, but the results are worth it and it makes the tenderloin very affordable. But it is the chimichurri sauce that makes the dish! It is fabulous! I made this recipe for a fiesta themed party for 14 people (I doubled everything). There wasn't a crumb left!

Rating: 4
This was fantastic! We served for a company dinner and everyone raved about it. The Chimichurri sauce was a perfect balance with the beef. This will be a repeat for many meals to come. My 3# roast took the full 40 minutes to cook. I'm sure different grills make a difference.

Rating: 4
We trimmed and tied a whole vac pack tenderloin and had almost 6 pounds of meat. After searing, it took only 20 minutes to reach 130 degrees. The meat was perfect--crispy/spicey outside, pink and fork-tender inside. Grill temps vary, so check your progress early. We thought the chimchurri sauce sounded odd with the mint, but prepared as directed. It was subtle and wonderful--gave a summery spin to the roast. Plucking all those herb leaves is labor intensive though.
