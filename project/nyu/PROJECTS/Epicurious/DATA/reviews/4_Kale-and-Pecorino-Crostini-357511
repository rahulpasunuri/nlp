Soooooooo good! I used manchego cheese instead as that is what I had on hand. It is a really simple recipe for the great flavor. Yum!

Easy to make and quite tasty. The anchovy imparts a nice flavor.

Delicious and easy, gobbled up by all. Our guests didn't find it challenging, even though we added an extra anchovy. It's just healthy enough to make you feel virtuous for having this as an appetizer, but not so healthy that it loses all the fun that an appetizer should have.

Healthy, which is very rare for an appetizer. I liked it but found it a bit dry. I served to a mixed group and it got a mixed response, possibly a bit adventerous for some.

We brought this to a dinner party last night and everyone loved it! We used curly green kale and prepared it as per the recipe except added a dash of cayenne. We grilled the bread and then brushed the slices with garlic/lemon peel infused olive oil. Assembled everything at the party. Delicious!
