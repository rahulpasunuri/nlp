LOVE this recipe! I make a "lower" fat version. Turkey bacon, vegetable or fat free chicken broth & fat free half & half. The brie remains the same. It tastes just as good! I have been making this since it was published. Great recipe!

We enjoyed this dish very much. For the Brie, we actually left the rind on and it was just fine.

I thought that the finished product was dry, need to increase sauce or decrease pasta. Next time I make it I'm going to use a milder cheese than parmesan to increase the brie flavor

I sauted two cloves of garlic before addind the cream and stock, and it made it a very flavourful sauce. Be sure to use low sodium stock as it already is a salty dish.

Very heavy... not the light, creamy sauce I thought it would be. It was good, but not great. Might make it again, but probably not.

I liked the recipe but added a few touches which I feel made it better. I grilled some marinated chicken (marinated with lots of garlic, red pepper and seasoned salt). I added this to the sauce after it had cooked. I also added canned chopped tomatoes and fresh basil sauteed in olive oil. It really changed the recipe alot but added a real punch of flavor to a rather bland recipe.

Fantastic, although I don't even want to know the calorie and fat count. I added baby shrimp and scallops and it was sublime.

This is one of the new ones I found on this site, And it will be one I make on a regular basis. The items are one's I keep on hand all the time,a nd it is a great meal in minutes. Loved it! I also found that adding chicken in makes it a great addition.

A very delicious AND satisfying dish! Much less gummy than most Alfredo dishes tend to be,plus the brie gives it the added edge that this type of meal often lacks Will make this as often as my conscience allows :O)

We've been making this dish since receiving our July 1992 issue of BonAppetit and we love everytime! Sometimes I use less bacon and increase the liquid to make the sauce a little thinner. This is a perfect dish for a cold autumn or winter night- just add a bottle of wine and maybe a salad and enjoy!

This dish was great. Filling and wonderfuly flavorful. One of the great comfort foods. I am going to experiment with adding veggies to it for next time.

One reason I made this dish was that I had all the ingredients. My only mistake was that I had enough noodles for 4 people instead of 6. I found this incredibly rich and salty. I will not make this again.
