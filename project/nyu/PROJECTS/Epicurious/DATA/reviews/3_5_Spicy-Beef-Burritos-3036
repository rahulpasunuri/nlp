Quick and easy! Once I set the meat to simmer in the broth, I had time to prep all the other ingredients (cheese, lettuce, sour cream & salsa) and still get a load of laundry done. I did add cumin as suggested, and salt as it tasted a bit bland to me. But otherwise, it's a keeper.

These were wonderful. The only addition I made was to sprinkle the beef with some ground cumin before I brought it to a boil. Wrapped rice, cheese, shredded lettuce and sour cream in a whole-wheat tortilla, warmed, and enjoyed. My entire family enjoyed - including 4 kids!

Fantastic - my wife loved it! I used entrecote steak and beat it beforehand to help make it tender before cooking it very slowly. I used chicken stock instead of beef broth, and it still came out great. With the coriander garnish it looks great too! I'll definitely make it again...

Ole!! I LOVED this recipe and so did my picky kids. I made it with Morningstar Farms veggie crumbles (don't cringe) as 2 of us are vegetarians and it worked well. Added some Monterey Jack cheese - stirred a little in to the "meat" and sprinkled some on top as well. Not a bite left. And it's REALLY quick that way!!

Not sure how the other reviewers prepared this dish, but my wife and I were thoroughly disappointed with it. These ingredients simply do not go together. Do not waste your time.

A family favorite, we have it over and over. We love it spicy and I simply add jalapeno peppers.

This is one of my favorite recipes-I have made it numerous times.The combination of the asian and mexican ingredients makes this a winner.When short on time I have used cut up steak which makes this more of a weekday meal.

I liked the consistency of the beef, but it was too sweet for my taste. I might try removing the sugar and soy sauce and maybe use chipotle peppers and/or jalapenos. It did seem to improve overnight.

This recipe is so GOOD! I have made it many times now, each w/ a different cut of beef, and each time the beef turns out extremely tender and yummy. I even made this w/ soft tacos, which was equally as good. TRY IT!

I only had time to cook this for 60 min. which may have been a problem as the meat was still too chewy. I felt that a burrito should have other stuff in it like cheese, beans etc. This was too plain and the family was not wild about it.

I've reviewed this before, but just made it again and can't repeat too often how simple and delicious this is! I also add a touch of salt and some ground cumin to the beef as it is cooking.

I made this for guests and it was a huge hit! We ate it for lunch the next day, and it was even better. I doubled the recipe, but even the leftovers went fast. Excellent dish and easy!

This is delicious . It would be great to make ahead and cook when a last-minute dinner is needed. It was flavorful and tender even though I didn't have time to simmer it the whole time.

This was a good MNF dinner for the family. The way Cortez kicks the ball for my 9er's makes this baby even better with a few cold ones. Use the stale rice trick and substitute brown for the white. Enjoy!

This recipe is EXCELLENT! Very very yummy. I have shared it with many people and they all loved it. The fresh cilantro is a MUST! I also offered grated sharp cheddar cheese. The meet is so tender you can eat without the starch if you are one to watch the carbs.
