I have been making this recipe for years...I have it written on the inside cover of my favorites folder! It is wonderful as written, but I also serve it tossed with with pasta and on any crostini. Next to try is on a rustic pizza crust. Sauteeing in the broth is a great way to keep it lighter, and no flavor is lost! Use wine if you have it...more broth if you don't...same with the olives. Great recipe to make ahead. A real winner!

Served as appetiser before dinner party. Substituted homemade cracked wheat french bread for whole wheat bread. Sauted onions in olive oil rather than broth.
