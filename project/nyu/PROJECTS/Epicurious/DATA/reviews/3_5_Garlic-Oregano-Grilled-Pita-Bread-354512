One of those recipes so simple and wonderful that it makes a regular grilled meal extra-special! So many ways to improvise, too. I mixed some za'atar into the olive oil and ground some coarse sea salt on top -- fabulous! Goes great with the other dishes in the Aug 2009 issue of "Gourmet" from which this came. Enjoy it with the cumin-scented beef kebabs!

The garlic flavor was very subtle when this was prepared as written. Hubby and I are both garlic lovers, so next time I'll mince the garlic fine, and leave it in. Most of the oregano stayed in the pan with the oil, so I might reserve half next time for sprinkling on top of the chips. This quick and easy side made it into our rotation for starchy sides to serve with koftas.

I use these alot for guests with various spreads including spiced Hummus. I have dropped the garlic as it offends to may folks and have added basil. also, when pressed I just toast them in my toaster oven at 350 for 4 minutes, seems to work as well.

Served these with lemon goat cheese and a spicy tomato salsa with sliced jalepeno and sour cream dollop. poker Guys gave em a thumbs up for great flavor.

Definitely will make these!! Everyone loves pita chips and will serve them with artichoke spread that friends enjoy. Also, found a delicious jalapeno humus that would be delicious too.

Super easy and perfect with the roast red pepper walnut spread. I added a little fresh ground pepper to the oil.
