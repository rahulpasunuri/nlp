Perfect! Preferred to use parchment paper to avoid extra oil. Make sure you chop onion/pepper very fine to equal size of bread crumbs. Panko is much better in my opinion. Broiling worked well for me as I had fairly thin filets. EASY!!!

Thanks to previous reviewers: I did cook veggies until golden, used panko, and baked at 400 on convection for about 6 minutes and finished with broiler. Loved it!!

I'd call this easy and exceptional for flounder. I did as one reviewer did - lowered heat to 400, not TOO close to broiler, and oiled aluminum foil on baking pan. I also left out the peppers (we don't like 'em). Took about 10 minutes to cook, but it was excellent and not a bit mushy! Flounder is tricky because it's not sturdy - so this recipe is a keeper.

Rating: 3
Made it as is, except for using a red pepper instead of the green. I put some foil on top after about 10 minutes to keep it from burning on top. Didn't have a problem with being soggy, despite making it at 7 a.m. and putting it into my lunch kit.

Very easy to prepare. Can be done with any light white fish. I have used flounder and tilapia. I put a large piece of romaine lettuce on top of each piece of fish while broiling and only take it off for the last minute. Works well to prevent burning and keeps breadcrumbs and fish moist

Very easy, tasty preparation for fresh fish. Sufficiently carmelized onions before adding red pepper and garlic - then tossed in double the bread crumbs. A great savory crunchy topping. Cooked at 400 for 12 minutes. Turned out perfectly!

Okay. Flounder just probably shouldn't be broiled, since it's so delicate; better to bread it and saute. But this wasn't terrible, just not great.

Rating: 2
As many others did, I found this to be very mushy. My flounder was previously frozen so I thawed it in the fridge and then rinsed and patted it very dry. The flavor of the topping was very, very good and I would most use it again for other types of fish (and perhaps chicken) as it was very flavorful. (I did use panko instead of regular bread crumbs). I'm not sure what made this watery---whether it was my fish or whether it was the mayo mixture. I'm suspicious of the recipe, however, since so many folks experienced similar issues. I would make this again but I would make some minor changes, starting with fresh fish and perhaps a grilling rack to allow the fish to drain as it cooks.

Undaunted by the bad reviews, I ventured forth bravely and was well rewarded. The first good sign was my breadcrumbs turned out sprinkle-able and not clumpy. I lined a baking sheet with heavy-duty foil, rubbed canola oil on it, used thin flounder fillets from Costco and put them in the broiler, but turned the temp down to 400. 8 minutes later, perfection! (I doubled the recipe.) No sticking. No mushiness. Easy clean-up too.

Rating: 3
Made this with tilapia because the store didn't have flounder. Quick, easy and very good. Remember to broil it 5-6 inches away from the broiler so it doesn't burn. We tented with foil to keep it from burning after about 3-4 minutes.

All the bad things other people said. Even on Low Broil and 10" from heating element, bread crumbs almost burned, fish wasn't cooked, got mushy, even though I oiled the broiler pan it was hard to get off. It tasted fine but the logistics were a mess. NO. NO. NO.

The fish was very tasty, but I found the stuffing was kind of hard to spread, so I just had to sort of glop it on. I used Light mayo and it was fine. Good with lemon.

Love this quick & easy dish. Especially with our local flounder here in the Hamptons!

Rating: 3
I did this recipe last night and it was delicious. I put the mayonnaise on the side where the skin should have been and the stuffing on that which meant I cooked the fish on top of the stuffing. The stuffing gave the fish a nice, delicate flavor. I definitely would make it again.

Rating: 1
This stuff was horrible. Six minutes and the topping was burned and the fish was undercooked, but mushy. The only flavor came from the salt and pepper, as the fish mush had none, and the texture was terrible. Unfortunately, when trying to find new recipe's, you inevitably encounter disappointments.

Rating: 3
I baked/broiled the fish in my toaster oven, at 450 oven for 6 minutes, and then 2 minutes in the broiler setting, but the fish (1 fillet cut into two pieces, and not particularly thick) did not cook through. So I did another 4 minutes at 450, and it was perfect. It's quite tasty, and the crust (I used panko) provides a great crunchy contrast to the fish's soft flesh. The downside of this recipe is that after reading all of the reviews I spent 10 minutes watching the fish cook -- I didn't want mush or a burned topping! But once you figure out the right relationship between your oven's power and your fish thickness, it's an easy and delicious meal, for weekday dinner and weekend dinner parties. I also used a mix of mayo and mustard to coat the fillets.

Rating: 3
Fresh flounder & reasonably thick fillets can reduce the chances of the fish turning to mush. I cooked just over 1 lb. of flounder about 10" below the broiler element, for 10 minutes. Crust did not burn, and the meal was very good.

Rating: 1
After 6 minutes, I had fish mush. So I covered it with foil and continued to cook it. After 20+ minutes, I still had fish mush. I wonder if the trick is to use frozen fillets, but I'll never find out because I will not retry this recipe.

Rating: 2
To the cook from Beaumont, TX - I, too, ended up with unrecognizable fish mush, though I cooked it just the specified time - I think I did not get a good piece of flounder (there is a kind of Alaskan flounder that is known to cook into mush - now I find out!). The crumb topping (what tiny bit I tasted) seemed good so I would probably try the recipe again, perhaps with the striped bass filets as recommended by another reviewer.

Rating: 2
I added fresh crabmeat to the topping, which was good. However, the fish didn't turn out like I had planned. The mayo didn't really sink in or anything and remaining kind of slimy on the skin of the fish.

Rating: 3
This turned out really well and tasted yummy...it almost reminded me of deviled crab. I, too, was skeptical of the mayo so I mixed in some dijon. Also, didn't have a green pepper so like another reviewer, used some salsa. I also chopped up a few roasted red peppers (jar kind)and used shallots along with small vidalia onions. Threw in some fresh basil from my garden and squeezed in some fresh lemon juice. Great recipe with a few tweaks. The only complaint...fish was a little mushy and I did follow the suggestions of others by lowering the rack and covering loosely with foil--not sure what caused the mushiness but the crumb texture was awesome! Oh, used panko in place of regular breadcrumbs. Panko has such a great crunch! By the way, my toddler loved it!

Rating: 3
This was very tasty. I followed the advice of other cooks and used the low setting on my broiler. I used one 10 ounce piece of fish and cooked it for about 10 minutes. I turned the broiler up to high for the last minute or so. I did not have a problem with the bread crumbs burning and the fish was not dry. I also added a little fresh parm to the bread crumbs,used red pepper instead of green and used vidalia onion. I might try it next time without the mayo just to reduce the fat. I also sprayed my broiler pan liberally with cooking spray and did not have a problem with the fish sticking. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 2
what a disaster! i thought the flavors were good, but it was a logistical nightmare. first, i neglected to follow other reviewers' advice to cover the fish so it doesn't burn, and well, it burnt. secondly, it was impossible to remove from the broiler rack. the thin fillets got totally lodged in the grooves of the pan, and none of the 4 of us eating dinner could get them off in one piece. what on earth did we do so wrong?

Rating: 4
I look forward to making it again and adding crabmeat or tiny salad shrimp and white wine or vermouth to the topping mixture, along with shredded Swiss or Gruyere near the end of cooking time. I didn't broil it quite as close as the 6" from heating element as the recipe called for, since I started out with frozen fillets. The longer cooking time was perfect. I needed to hold this dish over in the oven for an extra 20 minutes and it waited fine with the oven turned off.

Rating: 4
Awesome - very quick, very simple, and delicious. I fed this to 3 very picky children and all asked for 2nds! I also had to modify the recipe a bit because of lack of ingredients. I used frozed founder fillets, 2 tps of salsa instead of bell peppers, and wheat bread toast crumbs instead of breadcrumbs. Baked for 6 mins, broiled for 2. You can't go wrong with this one!

Rating: 4
This recipe was EXCELLENT! I followed other reviewers' suggestion and baked it first with aluminum foil cover (loosely put it on top of the fish) and broiled without the cover to finish. It gave nice crust on top and the fish came out juicy. This recipe gave a nice flavor to the flounder. I didn't have green pepper so I used red pepper instead and served this dish with sauteed broccoli with sesame oil.

I'd definitely make this again. This recipe happened to work out for me the first time around, without making any changes. Several reviewers commented that the bread crumb topping burned under their broiler before the fish was cooked. They recommended baking it instead . I haven't tried that. Two things came to mind while I was broiling it though. My broiler has both high and low settings. I used low. Also, since the fish was going to be broiled on a raised rack, I used a very heavy broiling pan, which would retain heat and radiate it up from the bottom, helping to even out the cooking process. I preheated the pan under the broiler as it was warming up, and then placed the cold oiled rack with the fish on it in the hot pan to broil. I would check on the fish about a minute earlier than the recipe calls for just to make sure it's not cooking too fast. -Mike

My husband made this for us and it was good although I liked it better than he did. We didn't have flounder available, so we used orange roughy which was delicious. The bread crumb mixture didn't "sprinkle" over the fish as indicted in the recipe. We were hesitant about the mayo but it turned out good.

Wonderful! And thanks to all the cooks who added their tips! I used a whole flounder and it worked great. I, too, added lemon juice, vermouth, and parmesan cheese to the topping, and used red bell peppers. From past experience, I put plenty of mayo and spread it all over the top of the flounder to keep it moist. I also broiled it on the bottom rack and then let it bake a few more minutes. Beautiful dish!

FANTASTIC!! My husband, who normally doesn't eat fish, declared this restaurant quality. It tasted amazing and looked like something on the cover of a magazine. I made it twice in two days with only minor changes...I used red bell pepper (as suggested by previous reviewers), tilapia instead of flounder, and added a few tablespoons of freshly grated parmesan to the topping mixture. The red bell pepper and parmesan were perfect with the fish. I will make this again and again.

Loved this -- was hesitant about the mayo, but it worked well here. Fish was moist and flavorful. Also, substituted red pepper for green -- very tasty. Note: Keep an eye on the topping in the broiler -- even at 6", it started to blacken quickly. (I turned the broiler off and baked it at 400F for the remaining time.)

excellent recipe! i took the suggestions of using sweeter peppers (red/yellow/orange bell) and the sweetness was just what was needed. i didn't have a problem with dryness -my friends commented on the moist tenderness of the fish. also, because i was cooking for health conscious friends, i substituted the mayonnaise with an equal amount of dijon mustard. it was fat free and added some depth to the dish. i would definitely make this again and again. it's fairly easy, and very quick. can prepare this before guests arrive, and then just stick it under the broiler when it's time to eat!

I have to say, It wasn't quite what I was expecting. i thought that the bread crumb topping was a little dry. I used scrod instead of flounder. I also used a little more onion than was called for. (onion lover- guilty as charged) My husband loved it, and I would definately make it again.

Follwed another cooks advice and traded flounder for trout (was fresher at store). I made the error of adding bread crumbs too early which soaked up the oil so I had to use more. My dinner guest thought it was delicious as did I - would make it again because it was so easy.

I wasn't particularly happy with this dish. I really wasn't expecting much -- after all, I was just looking for something simple to do with flounder for a weeknight meal. But I did expect it to have more flavor than it did. It was easy, fast, and very pretty, but overall the flavor was just so-so. I have to say though, I used vidalia onion and red bell pepper because that's what I had -- perhaps these vegetables were simply too mild for this dish. In such a simple recipe slight variations can sometimes make a big difference.

Very tastey! I used a red bell pepper. I also used bread crumbs left over from a recipe that had me make way too much bread crumb mixture. This mixture used Italian bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, horseradish, orgegano, thyme, garlic,and taragon. I don't know how much this mixture contributed, but it was good and worth doing again.
