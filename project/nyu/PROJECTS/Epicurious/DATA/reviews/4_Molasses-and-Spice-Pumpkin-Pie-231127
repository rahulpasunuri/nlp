This is a good pumpkin pie recipe. It's not too sweet like some pies that I've made in the past. I didn't have molasses so I used corn syrup with 2 tbs of brown sugar.

This pumpkin pie was very good, although I did reduce the sugar a bit, based on previous reviews. It wasn't too "eggy", which is a problem with some recipes. The texture was creamy without being too fluffy. It seems like it could use a bit more spice -- maybe a touch of nutmeg and cloves. I've been trying different pumpkin pie recipes to see if I can find one that tops my old favorite. While this recipe doesn't do that, it is one of the better ones I've found.

I love this pie, I have been making it year after year for about 5 years now. I chose the recipe because of the molasses, but I decided that it needed more, so when I make the pie I use about a half a jar of molasses and leave out the whole milk so that it's not too wet. It's a totally different, yet amazing taste. I also use a graham cracker crust.

I loved this pie. Use a deep dish pie crust for this recipe.

I will definitely make this again and next time, I will reduce the sugar a bit. I added some freshly grated nutmeg. The cooking time was 10-12 minutes longer for me. Rally good!

UPDATE: I've made this recipe 4 times by now (I love pumpkin anything!) and it's been consistently great. I still don't use allspice, substituting nutmeg and cloves instead. And I've been reducing the sugar by 1/4 cup - it's still sweet. The taste is just great - just more oomph than the average pumpkin pie and the texture isn't runny. As for the crust - homemade is way better than using the ready-made refrigerated dough. I used this simple recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Flaky-Pie-Crust-102546 @Staceyf: a regular pie dish should work.

A question for those of you who have made this pie: -Does it use a deep-dish pie crust? (like regular pumpkin pie) OR -A regular pie crust? Thanks!

This is my 2nd pumpkin pie recipe. The texture was more solid than the Pumpkin Pie Spice recipe I tried, and I like a denser texture in my pie. The taste was great, too, although I substituted a pinch of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cloves for the allspice (which I didn't have). Also, the pie was a tad too sweet so next time, I'll reduce the sugar by a 1/4 cup. The molasses flavor is subtle but it makes the pie tastes special. I used a ready-made crust so this recipe was put together quickly with little effort. If I don't find a better recipe, I'm sticking with this one.

I'll preface by saying I wonder if it is possible to have a bad pumpkin pie. I really enjoyed the molasses flavor which just gave it more depth of flavor! I confess I compared this to the Libby's can recipe which is my old standby. This one uses cream instead of evaporated milk and more sugar. I actually used half and half for the entire milk and cream amount. It came out beautifully and nicely browned. This will be my new pumpkin pie recipe. I just loved it!

Delicious! Used all whipping cream instead of 1/2 whole milk, was just perfect!

best pumpkin pie I have ever made and the family loved it, too. Used WFM brand dark molasses but cut back on the amount a bit - so good!

Look no further for the best pumpkin pie recipe! Far from boring, this simply assembled filling has a perfect texture and balance of spices.

Substituted 3/4 cup full-fat sour cream and 1/4 cup 2% milk for the heavy cream and whole milk. Delicious! Smooth, rich, creamy, and just a bit tangy. Everyone, kids to adults, loved it.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner as well as for some co-workers who were working for Thanksgiving...this pie was a hit! It is a wonderful take on traditional pumpkin pie with a little more flavor to it!

Made this again. Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and used fresh grated ginger instead of ground, and nutmeg for allspice. Delicious!!!!!! I think the fresh ginger really elevated the flavor.

I made this the night before Thanksgiving. My husband ate half that night so I had to make another the next day! Very easy to make. EVERYONE loved it, even those who normally don't care for Pumpkin Pie.

My all-time favorite pumpkin pie recipe. Very easy, and the molasses gives it a wonderful depth. My Thanksgiving standard.

Quick, easy, and delicious, everyone liked this pie. It is probably the moistest and richest pumpkin pie I've ever had (must be the heavy cream). The flavor is delicious, the texture rich and creamy, and it was very easy to prepare. I'd definitely make this again.

Made this with fresh pumpkin at Halloween, and am going to make it again for Thanksgiving. I used light brown sugar and heavy molasses for a dark pie and wonderful flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly. The color of the pie is so revolting that we could not fathom eating it.

Wow! This was the best pumpkin pie I've ever had and I will definitely make it again and recommend it to others. The flavor was out of this world. It was rich without being too heavy. My guests loved it and so did I!

My grocery store was out of light molasses, so I used a scant tablespoon of dark molasses. Also, I made a crust out of graham crackers and gingersnaps instead. I don't usually care for pumpkin pie, but this one was quite delicious. I've made this a few times, and someone always asks for the recipe. My husband, a self-proclaimed expert since childhood, insisted I make this while his mother was visiting. She in turn publicly announced that she had never tasted a pumpkin pie better than her own...until now!

This was a very easy pie to make. I would cut down on the sugar by at least 1/4 C next time. It is a bit sweet, not unbearable, though.
