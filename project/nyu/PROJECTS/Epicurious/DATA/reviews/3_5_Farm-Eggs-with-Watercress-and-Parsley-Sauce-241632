Recipe is good, although I used poached eggs vs. hard cooked. Eggs need to be several days old in order to peel properly. (Believe me - we keep chickens, and have tried every "surefire" method of peeling fresh ones - none work!) If you buy from a farmer's market, ask when they were collected. Wait at least until they are 4 days old, preferably a week, and you'll be OK. Otherwise, the white sticks to the shell & you end up with a mess!

I served these eggs as one of the courses of our Passover dinner. They were so delicious and made a beautiful presention with the green sauce swirled over.
