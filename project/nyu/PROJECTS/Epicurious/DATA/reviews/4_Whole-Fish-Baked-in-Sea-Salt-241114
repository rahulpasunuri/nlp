This is exceptional and fun to serve. My guests loved it, and the fish was very moist and tasty. I made three mediterranean sea bass (3.5 lbs combined), used 3 25-oz containers of sea salt and 3 egg whites. I prepped it approximately an hour before baking, it could have been made even earlier. I baked it for 35 minutes, let it sit for approximately 20 minutes. The olive oil/lemon juice mixture wasn't really used. Will definitely make again.

I used an Italian sea bass called branzini, the only whole fish at the supermarket today. They were perfect: just 1.5 lbs each, so I got two, used 8 cups kosher salt, and baked for 20 instead of 25 minutes. I also tried sliced fennel along with the leeks instead of fennel seeds, and used the fronds as garnish on the platter, along with lemon slices. The aromatics perfumed the fish beautifully, and the salt crust kept the flesh moist and tender without over-seasoning the fish. I felt bad "wasting" so much salt but I realized at just $2 a box for diamond crystal kosher, I wouldn't think twice about spending the same for a roasting bag for a roast. It's really just an effective tool for gentle and even cooking, not so much an ingredient. The proof is in the results. The impressive table pres was a nice bonus to the deliciousness.

Honestly: this was totally amazing. I cook often and well, and perhaps this is one of the finest preps for fish I have encountered. We used 3 1-lb Branzino (Greek seabass) because they were fresh and, well, branzino are incredibly moist. As others have said, keep heads and tails on, but descale and gut. Toasting the dried spices was key and set the mood for the whole meal to come. we upped the egg whites to 3, the cups of salt to 7, and placed all 3 in the same pan (foil under). A 1/2" layer of salt crust under and the rest packed over and around. Our crust did not brown, but hardened well and the fish were perfect with 25 mins in the oven and 10 mins to rest. The fish was flavorful and fall-off-the-bone moist. Served with arugula salad and mini tri-color roasted potatoes. So fun, so easy, so delicious.

I had to reply to Lisbon-Cook's review below; that is incorrect. You do NOT cook the entire fish with entrails and gills. That is backwards. The fish should be cleaned, scaled, with head intact, but gills and entrails removed. The salt will not enter and over-season the fish. The cavity is stuffed with aromatics, and the scent and flavor will permeate the flesh. It's a delicious preparation. Give it a try!

Nasty! I couldn't find a whole 3 lb. fish, so used the tail half of a salmon (which doesn't have much of a cavity). The meat was very tasty but the spices inside were too spicy to actually eat. we had to scrape them off. What a waste... Can't really imagine that anyone would want to eat a pure blend of pepper, fennel and Coriander seeds. What am I missing?

This was fantastic! We could only find a 3 lb whitefish though we'd hoped for a salmon, but decided to try it anyway (we were worried it might be too bland). It was amazingly delicious - moist, flavorful, and not too salty. We only had 5 cups of coarse salt, so used one cup of fine to make up the difference, and it turned out just fine.

This is incredible. I took my knife skills the extra mile and completely removed all bones 1st. Hard to fix salmon any other way now.

Used this recipe for my first whole fish in salt and it came out AMAZING! So quick and simple. The fennel seeds are a must!! Ended up rubbing the outside of the fish with the extra seasoning mixture and it came out wonderful. I could do without the olive oil at the end, but it was amazing none the less. A new staple!!

Excellent! I have made this recipe several times with Branzino-- mediterranean sea bass. Only challenge is finding appropriate size for a whole Branzino as the ones available tend to be very small--1 for 1-2 persons. I also use the best olive oil I have and serve with rosemary roasted potatoes and green beans or cooked spinach.

I used a 4lb white fish with the scales and fins removed as specified in the recipe. The fish cooked perfectly; it was very moist and flavorful. Very little salt permeated into the fish. Overall the taste was excellent. The one problem I had was that in several spots the salt crust stuck to the skin and the skin came off during the salt removal. It made for a less pleasing presentation. I will definitely try this one again.

The fish must be intact with the gills, fins and scales on and an unopened belly. Otherwise the salt crust, "enters" inside and salts too much the fish flesh. Only at the table the belly inwards are removed. The fish skin, scales and fins remain attached to the salt crust. It needs "a chef" to serve it at the table.
