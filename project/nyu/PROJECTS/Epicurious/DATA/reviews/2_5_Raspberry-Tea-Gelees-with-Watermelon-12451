My husband loves this. We use seasonal fruits. His favorite is pomegranate. When you are trying to cut back and loose some weight after the holidays but still are jonesing for some dessert this one hits the spot.

Because I wasn't thrilled with the outcome of my first batch I made 2 major substitutions for my second and was very pleased with the outcome. I used rosehip-hibiscus tea and regular black tea in lieu of raspberry and substituted mandarin oranges for the watermelon. I served them for a Sunday tea and got rave reviews. The red color from the tea and the oranges made them look like mini sunbursts. They are cool, refreshing and not too sweet.
