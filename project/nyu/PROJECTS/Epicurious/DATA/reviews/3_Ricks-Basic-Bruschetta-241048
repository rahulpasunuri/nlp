I'm not sure what the confusion is with some of these reviews - this is 'basic' bruschetta - that is, the common building block, part A, that needs a part B to complete the bruschetta. When you ad part B - which can be an endless list of additions, this turns from 'basic' to 'complete.' This is a platform to greatness!

Bruschetta From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Bruschetta made with tomatoes Bruschetta with olive oil and prosciuttoBruschetta (Italian pronunciation: [brus»ketta] ( listen)) is an appetizer whose origin dates to at least the 15th century from central Italy. It consists of grilled bread rubbed with garlic and topped with extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper. Variations may include toppings of spicy red pepper, tomato, vegetables, beans, cured meat, and/or cheese; the most popular recipe outside of Italy involves basil, fresh tomato, garlic and onion or mozzarella.

this is the basic recipie for all excellent bruschetta. Fabulous! This list of toppings is limited only by our collective imaginations. Because I watch my waistline, I usually use half the oil.

To the previous reviewer: Bruschetta is exactly this. Here's a link for you to broaden your horizons: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruschetta I made this recipe, it was simple and tasted great. Instead of rubbing the bread with garlic I used roasted garlic olive oil to save work. Would recommend.

This is not bruschetta. Bruschetta is a topping for toast usually including tomatoes. This is a recipe for garlic toast.
