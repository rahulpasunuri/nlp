This recipe is great to build on. I've made lots of changes to suit my own tastes (I am not a fan of dill). We use cooked brown rice instead of orzo, then we add lots of Moroccan spices like cumin, ras el hanout, etc, and maybe some tomato paste. We'll also sometimes use a mixture of 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 lamb, since beef is cheaper, to make this dish more economical but retain that lamb flavor. I don't stick to just orange peppers, and find it works equally well with red or yellow peppers.

I think this recipe is a great starting point for an awesome stuffed pepper. I made four peppers worth. I used ground turkey, made the tomato mixture pretty close to the recipe except I mixed it all in with the turkey to keep it moist. I replaced the dill with oregano, added about a tspn. of worcestershire sauce, garlic, a very light sprinkle of cinnamon, toasted pine nuts and feta. I mixed it all together and stuffed the peppers and sprinkled a little more feta on top before I baked them. I'm sure it would have been even better with lamb.

I really liked this. I did make some changes. I doubled it, used ground turkey instead of lamb, and green bell peppers instead of orange. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I saw some reviewers who used ground turkey had problems with it being dry, but mine was very moist and tasty. The whole dish was juicy and flavorful and I especially liked the onion/tomato sauce and the dill. I will make it again.

We enjoyed this. I liked how the onions and tomatoes cook down and make a kind of chunky almost-a-sauce that you can scoop over the peppers. Lots of vegetable bang for the buck here. I skipped the dill and used fresh oregano and lots of chopped garlic instead. I will make this again.

We found this recipe pretty bland and a little dry. The lamb, orzo, and pepper were all good together, but if I made it again I'd probably try mixing the tomato with the stuffing and upping the herbs and spices considerably. It was nothing special as written here.

I doubled the recipe using red peppers. I don't like any kind of ground meat so I used some leftover lamb shoulder meat that I had cut into cubes. I also added oregano, garlic, and pepper flakes. Instead of the water from boiling the orzo, I used beef stock and I also used canned stewed tomatoes. The mix looked bland so I added a couple tablespoons of the stewed tomatoes for color and flavor. It wasn't dry and there was enough of the tomato sauce to scoop over the filling to keep it moist. We loved it, it's a very pretty dish and the flavors blended very well together.

This is a very common dish in Greece, I would have it once a week. But, add more spice (oregano is very common and some red peper), cook all the ingredents and them mix together, then stuff the pepers, will not be as dry.

I quadrupled the recipe and served it for dinner to my in-laws (not lamb fans) and it was a hit! I used a mix of yellow, orange and red bellpeppers and it was beautiful, too. Used hints from other reviewers and added garlic and herbs and grated some hard cheese on top to serve.

This recipe is easier than it seems, you just need a little time. It's fine the way it's written since it brings out the delicate taste of the lamb. My husband was not thrilled that I said we were having stuffed peppers for dinner, but he was thinking of the traditional beef-filled ones. He loved this!

I think this was a great recipe. I read the reviews and knew going in I needed to add "something." I added dried oregano to the meat/onion/orzo mixture, feta cheese on top and yummy! was the result. I did not have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used diced canned and it was just fine.

A good base recipe, but bland without the addition of garlic, favorite herbs and a pinch of crushed peppers. Lamb is wonderful in combination with the peppers. We added a sprinkle of grated hard cheese on top when serving.

This was comparatively easy--considering the impact. I added cumin to the meat/rice mixture and would highly recommend that to improve flavor.

I made this recipe with ground hamburger meat instead of lamb. I thought it was a tasty, cosy dish. Good for a simple night at home.

This dish was quick, simple and had a very fresh flavor. The bed of tomato and onion served alongside was nice. It got very good reviews at the dinner table!

stuffing was bland and dry - much prefer rice and tomatoes in stuffing

Made this last night quadrupling the recipe. I didn't split the peppers in half because the wouldn't otherwise fit in the baking dish but that didn't affect the taste. Very nice autumn stick-to-your-ribs dish.
