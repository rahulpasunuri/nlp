Prime Rib with Orange Balsamic Glaze has been a Christmas Day tradition since 2002. My husband who works in one of best steakhouses in Las Vegas can be rather critical when it comes to meat. However, after the first bite and said "this is a do-over", I have ever since. I use bone-on prime rib from a local market and take it out of the oven around 125 for rare/mid-rare meat. Unfortunately, I have yet to find pistachio oil, for the salad so I use pumpkin seed oil and toasted pumpkin seeds. Yum. Enjoy.

The glaze was incredible... but my buffalo... was not. I bought a frozen roast and it seemed very gamey tasting. Buffalo is not readily available in my area.. I may order in from the suggested 'Wild Idea Buffalo' and try again... since I keep hearing how incredible it is.. and I think ANYTHING with this glaze will be delicious!

I did this with buffalo per the recipe and turned out very well. So for easter, I used the orange balsamic glaze on a boneless leg of lamb. Cooked the lamb until 135 in a 200 degree oven. Then turned the oven off for an hour. the lamb was wonderful.

Frankly any dish is superior with buffalo rather than beef. I have almost entirely given up beef in favor of buffalo, which is lean, tender and has an almost sweet flavor. I'll take a buffalo burger over a greasy hamburger any day! Wild Idea Buffalo is a wonderful, environmentally caring supplier. Although buffalo is still considerably more expensive than beef, it is well worth it.

This is an absolutely wonderful dish!

I made this for 8 people and everyone loved it. Used a boneless rib roast and used the orange balsalmic glaze with 1 tsp. salt as advised by the other reviewers. The meat was delicious--expensive but worth it. Definately make the au jus or some kind of gravy because buffalo is drier (leaner) than beef and needs the moisture.

I made this for my gourmet club dinner and they are still raving about it. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes but would add horseradish to them next time and yorkshire pudding.

I have to laugh at the "buffalo - exotic or not?" debate - I happen to live in a part of the world where you can get tons of wonderful organic buffalo. BUT, you can't get any decent kind of fish (except maybe walleye), the shrimp are dubious, and the only thing resembing scallops is "scallop product." (yuck.) So does that mean I should write in to all the scallop recipes asking Gourmet to get real? If you can't get the ingredients, don't make the recipe, but don't complain that this is unfair - your grocery store is not everyone' s grocery store! (I'm looking forward to trying this recipe and will review it when I have.)

I made this for our gourmet group and it received rave reviews! The orange balsamic glaze is what made it and would think it would be nice on a pork loin too. Yummmm! Unlike the other reviewer, I thought the prime rib cut is very expensive and hard to come by but was worth it $80 for 4.5 lbs. We all thought buffalo would taste gamey or be tough. Oh contraire--tender and delicous!

Not hard to make but because a bone in roast was difficult to come by in our area we went with a boneless roast. We turned off the over 10 degrees before rare but the meat kept cooking to about medium, Argh!

I prepared this with a 9-lb. beef rib roast, accompanied by a standard (freshly grated)horseradish sauce, garlic mashed potatoes and the featured beet salad. It was ideal for a dinner that permitted me to be with my guests but still have a standout menu. I believe the sumptuous orange glaze could work with other roasts, too.

The cook from Missoula is lucky. He or she can get buffalo meat from that one joint in Rollins, MT, in the Flathead basin--for some dang reason I can't remember what it's called, but it was featured in Gourmet's June or July issue. Then again, the cook from Missoula is lucky just to live in Missoula. AMENDED: it's called M&S Meats and they are the best. They are on the Net at www.shopworks.com/msmeats, or toll free at 800-454-3414. One of the many reasons I look forward all year to summer in the Flathead Basin.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner with Prime Rib rather than buffalo. The glaze was especially delicious. I added flour when making the au jus so it was more of a gravy. The horseradish mashed potatoes suggested with the recipe were also great. We had a big snow storm on Christmas day in New York so my guests couldn't make it but my family dined in style and we have lots of leftovers in the freezer.

In case you're not aware, the price of buffalo meat has dropped dramatically in the last year or so. We recently bought a hindquarter (176 lbs.)from a local meat market and paid less than we would have paid for a comparable quantity of beef ($2.19/lb). This was the average price, the package includes every cut from the hindquarter (from hamburger to tenderloin). The flavor is excellent and it is very low in fat. Buffalo really is a realistic food choice for many people.

To all the buffalo skeptics: I am married to your spokesperson! "Ha, you can't fool me, there's ground turkey in this chili"...."I'll eat a Boca burger when they come fried in beef fat" etc., etc. So in an effort to rein in his cholesterol intake, I bought a buffalo roast which I was fortunate enough to find at my local Whole Foods. Cost more than beef, but only in money - you can tell just by looking at it how much leaner it is than beef. But how to get it past the palate of Mr. Where's the Beef? I found a TERRIFIC solution in the "Basic Pot Roast" recipe on this site. Look for the review from "The Bumpkin Gourmet" for a great meat rub recipe (albeit a little vague), and add Cabernet and Worcestershire to the pot as he suggests. My hubby (and our 4 kids) devoured it! Nobody even CARED what kind of roast it was, they were too busy eating. I don't think every beef recipe is suited to buffalo, and haven't tried this recipe, but based on the success of the pot roast I won't hesitate if I see a buffalo prime rib. Thanks for the supplier tips, Epicurious! PS Have also tried ostrich, but was not fond of the taste. But at least I can say that we tried it once! +

I thought this was excellent, and it's pretty much my standard for Buff. roast. I'm also happy to see buffalo recipes making it into mainstream publications once in awhile. I guess buffalo and ostrich has not become "the new beef" as some predicted -- I'm just glad I wasn't one of those dummies who sank substantial investment into ostrich farms, etc. Perhaps those people are now eating crow, too!

We used a rolled prime rib beef roast and it was fabulous. Even those who prefer things plain... just loved it. Will certainly make it again.

I did not make this recipe, however, I did get the buffalo meat from The Jackson Hole Buffalo Meat Company (Wild Idea was sold out). I ordered prime rib with bone and I got a roast without a bone. The meat was not as tender as beef and I was not real crazy about the taste. I used the recipe "Roast Prime Rib with Maderia Sauce and Horseradish Sauce". That recipe gets wonderful reviews so I don't think it was the sauces that spoiled the taste, it was the buffalo that spoiled the recipe.

Although I didn't make this exact recipe - I did however order a buffalo from Wild Idea Buffalo for Christmas dinner. The meat was outstanding and I highly recommend giving it a try.

We served this for Christmas Eve along with most of the other dishes in the _Gourmet_ feature. My brother ordered the buffalo prime rib from a local restaurant. It came from Canada. He roasted it outside in a Weber Kettle Grill. It was done to perfection in two hours. Everyone thought it was delicious. The jus was wonderful. The plate was very attractive with the buffalo, mashed potatoes, and roasted carrots and parsnips

Silly me! I thought it would be meat covered in red hot sauce and served with bleu cheese dressing.

This was wonderful. We'll definitely have it again. As far as the buffalo comments, I'm lucky enough to live in a city where my local grocery store does carry it. We love to grill it during the summer and serve it with baked potato fries. As a matter of fact, my grandfather's hometown (population 700 in the middle of Kansas) offers it up regularly at their one and only restaurant. It's definitely worth a try and perhaps not so difficult to find as some might think.

Isn't there any English form of the word jus (drippings, renderings, juice) that is used in gourmet cookbooks? I don't have anything against French, it just strikes me as pretentious and peut etre un peu ennuyeux.

Living in Southern California and close to several excellent buffalo ranches, we cook with buffalo often. The whole family loves it, especially the kids. This is a wonderful recipe, and I highly recommend you try it. The meat is leaner, healthier and oh so tasteful.

I am a Personal Chef in Macon, GA and am about to try buffalo for the first time. I can hardly wait for the UPS truck at my door and my clients are as excited as I am! This recipe sounds wonderful, so my clients should be very pleased. The chef from N. Ky is so right! My clients are pleased to be able to eat in but still get gourmet at a reasonable price. Be adventurous! Get out of that rut and try something new for a change. You might just like it!

Come on, people. What are you afraid of? Right on Gig Harbor! Buffalo (as well as ostrich and other "game" meats") are delicious and healthy - and easy to cook. Walk on the wild side and try something new before slamming it. I suppose the reason they're all somewhat difficult to find is due to pre-concieved opinions like the folks commenting here who have never tried them....

Maybe you're missing something here ... it does provide a way to use this recipe for a beef roast, and it sounds absolutely delicious.

I agree with the first reviewer: Gourmet is going down the tubes, and I too was very disappointed with the December issue. Sure, buffalo is fine to cook (especially for those gourmands in KY who "truly" love to cook and are so above perusing a lowly rag like Family Circle) but another, more traditional menu should have been included as well for the rest of us who a) don't have access to buffalo and 2) who have families who might be dissapointed by such a menu.

I am a chef/owner of an upscale restaurant (4 stars) in N.Ky and I am thrilled to see recipes such as this published. People who truly love to cook and enjoy broading their culinary knowledge will be greatful for such information, don't forget- THAT IS WHAT "GOURMET" IS ALL ABOUT! If you want average, then you get "real", read Family Circle!

Only a person who has not tried buffalo would be offended by the idea of buffalo at Christmas time. It is truly a wonderful meat no matter what cut you are using. I have made variations of this recipe on many occasions and have found it to exceed an beef dish. Unfortunately, not enough grocery stores carry the item. However, there are many, many, online distributors. The key to buffalo..never over cook it. Give it a try, you will be delightfully surprised!

I haven't made this yet but considering the other comments, I too had to comment. I was delighted to see this recipe for buffalo. Buffalo is a wonderful tasting meat, low in fat AND it can be ordered for those that don't live in a area (such as myself) that doesn't carry buffalo meat. I happen to have some buffalo meat in my freezer that was given to me from a friend that was traveling in Colorado and I plan on preparing it this month so to give my family a break from the normal turkey/ham that they will be bombarded with the rest of the month.
