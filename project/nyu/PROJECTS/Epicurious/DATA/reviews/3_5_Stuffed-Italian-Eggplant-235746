This is not for picky people. It was quite laborious as well.

This was scrumptious and I will definitely make it again. My husband loves eggplant but dislikes rice, yet he loved the rice filling in this recipe. I used a bottled sauce to cut down on all the pots and bowls being used at once, but another option for me would be to pull out a sauce I've made previously and stashed in the freezer. The frying is not too hard and adds a nice touch, browning the stuffing and crisping the shell. Don't make the mistake I made and leave the chopped eggplant in a bowl to be discovered after the dish is baking. I just pulled the dish out of the oven and stuffed the eggplant in best I could. It all worked out well after all.

I have to admit that when I started cooking this this afternoon, my heart was half in it at best. It's hot, I was annoyed with myself that I had overbought at the farmers market (again) & I didn't really feel like standing over the stove. But I have a drawer full of eggplant & an overflowing herb garden, so after holding onto this recipe for 2 years I figured now was the time. And I have to say after tasting the final product it was well worth the effort. This is simple, comforting Italian food at its best. My only modifications were using brown rice & wheat bread. I will definitely make this one again... next time I'll just pour myself a glass of wine & put Volare on the stereo while I do it. One nice note about the recipe is that while there are a lot of steps, all but the last one can be done ahead of time, so it would be a nice choice for guests.

what a nice dish. my hubby went back for seconds and said "this is excellent, baby, and i don't even like eggplant!" makes it all worth the effort! might use a little red pepper flakes next time to rev it up a bit. also, i did not have the time to make the tomato sauce and just used the barilla sauce i had open. saved a ton of time and was delicious!

Yes, this eggplant is a lot of work, but it is definitely worth it. I hosted a dinner party for about 15 people and made this dish for the couple of vegetarians who were attending (plenty of meat dishes were available for the carnivores). Much to my surprise, everyone, including the meat-eaters, were raving about this eggplant, and I was told it was the best part of the dinner (and it was the only thing I ran out of). I got to try a small piece and it was delicious and savoury. A couple of changes I made: I forgot to pierce the eggplant before boiling, but I don't think it mattered much. I also did not have a thermometer, so just heated the oil (probably less than called for) until it seemed hot enough. It may have been too hot, because I only fried my eggplants about 2 minutes per side. To save time the day of the party, I made everything the day before and stored the fried eggplant and sauce separately in the fridge overnight, then brought it to room temperature before baking it. I also poured the sauce over the eggplant (instead of the other way around), which I highly recommend. I will definitely make this again (I'll just know better and will make more next time!)

Loved this recipe! I skipped the frying step (as recommended by another reviewer ), and I thought the result was still very delicious. This is a great alternative to the pasta-based Italian dishes. Tastes like comfort food, yet doesn't give you that over-stuffed unhealthy feeling. And, Costco sells 4 eggplants in a package. Perfect!

This was a great recipe. I doubled the recipe and served it to 7 people, everyone loved it. The preparation is time consuming but worth it for a special dinner. I did skip the frying step as I do not like too much oil - the recipe was still tastey.

To the cook from White Plains...wow. That was really unkind. The cook from England IS entitled to his opinion, that's what reviews are here for!

I made this recipe without rice. I added more cheese than called for. It is delicious. I will definitely make it again. Too bad the cost of the baby eggplants is so high.

To the Cook on 9/29 or there abouts....just incase I got the date wrong....Yes indeedies life goes on - and you too should get a grip!

I hear people from White Plains N.Y. aren't "know" for their spelling and like to make generalizations about people from other places. I made the dish as suggested and it was fabulous. If someone else doesn't like it, that's their opinion and life goes on. Even in White Plains!

To the cook from England....first off you guys aren't know for your gourmet cooking so I'm not surprised that you can't tell a good thing when it bites you in the face...secondly - I don't boil or fry....I scoop the eggplant out and sauteed it with whatever else I'm adding ...then I stuff it in the eggplant.... and pour sauce over and and cook it in the oven....until the eggplant is tender...get a grip.

I followed the recipe to the letter and we both took one bite and said, "Yuck!" A dish fit for the garburater. And it took forever. First boil and then fry and then bake.

I haven't made this recipe yet - but I love this stuff.....and I've been experimenting with my own receipe....I add - sauteed mushrooms, hot sausage (cooked), chopped calmata oilves - locatelli and mozzarela.....oh and be sure to use italian eggplants - they cook better

This is excellent - even though I decided it would be too time consuming to fry the eggplants and just baked them with extra cheese on top. YUM!!

This was very good. It took a bit longer to make than I thought it would, but it was worth it in the end.

My husband and I love eggplant and this was just another way to prepare it. It was time consuming but I loved it since I love to cook. I followed the receipe exactly as stated and wouldn't change a thing. Went great well with a ceasar salad.

In answer to the previous comment, I think it's probably easier and neater to chop the tomatoes on board and then add them back to the juice rather than try to do it in a bowl with all the liquid.

I haven't yet made this recipe so I can't review it but I'm wondering - why drain the tomatoes if you're going to throw them in with the reserved juices immediately after?

EXCELLENT! takes some time but worth it. I accidentally left out the egg from the stuffing, but was still able to fry the eggplant+stuffing. I think the texture from frying was invaluable. One of the few recipes I wouldn't make a change to

The sauce is wonderful made with homegrown Roma tomatoes. Frying the stuffed eggplant really does work! It took some time to make but my husband said it is the best thing I've ever cooked.
