I will amend my review to add that the zucchini blossoms are prone to having ants inside (they're pollinators) so check that out. While I liked the blossoms I thought they were not so special. I tried male, female, stuffed with cheese, not etc. I did dredge mine in flour to help the batter stick.

I made this with a high quality porter. It is best with a little added spice. Substitute some garlic salt for the salt and add your favorites. I used paprika and cumin. The batter is a good one.

I really loved the batter. I used some skunked pabst that my boyfriend had in his fridge and I thought it turned out really well. He even enjoyed it and he doesn't even like zucchini. Zucchini blossoms are not really available in the winter, but maybe next summer I will give them a try.

Definitely one for the recipe box! But with suggestions: 1) Be sure to get as much moisture out of the Zukes as possible! Or you'll just have to use more flour. 2) I added 2-3 finely chopped garlic cloves, toasted pine nuts, and chopped sundried tomatoes. 3) I left out the dill. 4) Use the best quality feta you can find. 5) A little fresh lemon juice on the finished product brings out all the flavors with a bang!

I made this recipe with my giant yellow zucchini from my garden and cried over the sacrificed can of beer. Tastes just like tempura- but I wouldn't make this again as it's a bit too oily for me.

Very good. The kids loved them, and it was a great way to use up some extra zucchini. The batter is very tasty.

way too greasy

This is delish and easy to make. I suggest if making this to be sure to use a dark beer or stout like it calls for. A lite beer does not do it justice. Works with an array of veggies like mushrooms and carrots... Great appetizer for parties, but requires a cook on hand to prepare and serve. Best if eaten while warm/hot.

I made half this recipe and used Killian's Irish Red and freshly-picked zucchini. I subbed in 2 Tbsp whole wheat pastry flour for white flour. I pan fried in EV olive oil in a cast iron chicken fryer. The zucchini was delicious. I salted the zucchini about 30min before using and should have cut the batter salt in half since it was a little too salty. The batter kept fine overnight but possibly was not as good as the first day. I also fried portabella and eggplant slices.

Very good, however for those of you new to zucchini flowers, they are also tasty with out the batter, just a little butter and fry them up in a pan.

Easy to make - had these as an appetizer for friends and family and it was a great success! A great way to serve zucchini! Will definately be making this again! P.S. To the Cook from Miami - A zucchini blossom is the flower that grows on the end of the zucchini - I usually have to get them from my own garden as the plant is growing.

I want to make this, it sounds so good But I am ignorant about zucchini. Can someone tell me what a zucchini blossome is?

Delicious and easy batter and a great way to use some of the bumper crop of zucchini in the garden. Only beer I had on hand was Budweiser. Next time I want to try it with a darker beer, since it was a bit bland for my taste. But the kids gobbled it up and didn't even realize they were eating their vegetables! It could also stand up to adding any number of spices. This would also be great on fish.

This was an easy and fun recipe for Super Bowl Sunday. A couple of changes I made: put all the veggies in a bowl and added generous portions of salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder and paprika. Mixed to distribute then dipped into the batter and fried them up. I used zucchini, cauliflower and green pepper (what my in-laws had on hand) and they were gobbled down by all.

A wonderful way to eat veggies; with a meal or just as a snack, it hits the spot

Everyone ate them up and wanted more. I, too, added salt to vegetable before batter.

Excellent batter! My husband was reluctant to hand over 1/2 c. of his Creemore Springs microbrewery lager for a 1/4 size recipe trial. He is currently frying up the second zucchini and a green tomato as well, and said "This is the only zucchini recipe I have every REALLY WANTED to eat!" We're picking all the zucchini we can find from the garden. P.S. Salt the veggies.

Great little batter. I'm thinking of mixing some up in bulk, minus the beer, and just saving it for whenever. (That should be okay, right?) I could think of several ways to modify/enhance this batter, but not right now... I drank the rest of the six pack.

Delicious batter. I was out of cornstarch, like the other reviewer, and added more flower too. Also I substituted Coors light for stout, pre-salted the veggies, and used Crisco instead of Cannola. I fried some mushrooms in it, and my family couldn't decide which vegetable they liked more, the zuccini or the mushrooms, very good. I served it with homemade Ranch dressing for dipping.

This recipe was great! I didn't have any cornstarch on hand, so I just increased the flour amount by 1/4 cup. We also just used Amstel Light. I used the previous reviewer's suggestion of salting the zucchini before putting it in the batter, and was pleased that I did. It was scrumptious!

what a batter! probably good for any fish or vegetable around. Tastes good even cold

My husband and I thought this was great! The only substitution was the beer -- I used Coors Light. Next time I make this (because there will definitely be a next time) I might salt the zucchini before I batter it. It was just a little bland underneath the coating. Overall, a wonderful recipe.

Great recipe and so simple. Used this batter for other vegetables and even catfish.

My family loves zucchini and this recipe is excellent and easy. The batter is excellent, would probably be good on other things besides zucchini. We will definately try this again!
