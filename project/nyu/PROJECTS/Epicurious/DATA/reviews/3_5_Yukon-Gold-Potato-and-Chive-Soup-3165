Very tasty, but WAY too much stock. Luckily I looked at other reviews. I used 4 cups (1 cardboard container) for 2 1/2 lbs of Yukon Golds and it was just right. Would have been way too brothy for my taste w/ the called-for amount of stock. I also added 2 sprigs rosemary while it was simmering and took them out before pureeing. Lots of black pepper. Yum!

Extremely easy and delicious. Made it to complement a chicken panini sandwich for a quick dinner. Made a few adjustments which I think made it really flavorful. 1. Started soup by sauteing three cloves garlic and one small sliced onion in olive oil. Seasoned onions and garlic with dried thyme ~2tsp, and 1tsp kosher salt. 2. Only had 2 cups broth, so added 6 cups water and three chicken bouillon cubes. 3. Added white pepper as recommended by others. 4. Cooked the potatoes for an additional 20 minutes to let the flavors mix a bit more. 5. Didn't use half and half, dashed in ~1 tbl of heavy whipping cream and ~1/3c sour cream after having blended with immersion blender (much easier than blender if you have one). Yummy right off the stove top and yummy the next day for lunch!!

I made this recipe exactly as stated (even weighed the potatoes first) and I'm suprised no one had the problem I did of the soup being way too watery. I will try it again using only 5 1/2 or 6 cups of broth (not 7) and, depending on how it looks, I might just add 1/3 c. heavy cream (not 2/3 c. half-and-half). I also think the soup would really benefit from the addition of white pepper.

I tried to make it low-fat and used 1c milk wisked w/ 2T cornstarch & 1T flour instead of the cream. It had a good consistency and decent flavor even without all the fat. I added a little crumbled bacon to liven it up.

Add large onion or combination of onion, leek,or shallots to pot and boil with potatoes. Whisk 2 tablespoons of sour cream into soup with cream at end. Garnish with cheddar and bacon lardons.

Really easy, very potato-y soup. I dropped a 1" piece of fresh (if somewhat old) ginger in at the beginning, and used white pepper instead of black. That gave it a great zing, without an instrusive flavor, so we didn't have to dump cheese or bacon on it. Yummy.

Well received at my house. Garnished with grated cheddar and bacon pieces for extra flavor.

As previously mentioned, good as a base with additions of cheese and bacon bits. Cubed the potatoes and took out a lot of the chunks before pureeing.

Excellent base soup. Needs flavor, which can be as simple as grated cheddar cheese on top, to "loaded baked potato soup" with bacon bits, cheese, sour cream, and chives. A dash of hot sauce and homemade stock also liven up the flavor. Consider leaving some potatoes out of the food processor and place back in soup for chunky soup.
