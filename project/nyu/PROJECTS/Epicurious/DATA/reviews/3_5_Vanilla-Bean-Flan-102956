I don't know what the previous reviewer did, but I have to say the error must have been theirs. This recipie is lovely. Did require a bit more cooking, as others have said. And, I found that it takes quite a bit more caremalized sugar in the bottom of the cup than they reccomend, to get that beautiful, drippy flan wonderfulness. But, other than that, came out beautifully! (I am looking it up now to make again.)

yuck! this flan did not turn out like i expected! i was horrified when a guest said the flan tasted like something her mother used to make -- tapioca pudding! the taste was ok, but if you want a tastier and prettier flan, make the maple flan (bon appetit) on this website. this was one step above jello vanilla pudding.

Wow. Was I surprised! It was not only an easy recipe, but tasted fabulous as well. We used lowfat versus nonfat condensed milk, and it was great. Made it for a dinner party, and the guests were thrilled. I absolutlely would make it again. Thanks for the other reviews, they helped--especially about the carmel hardening.

Taste was wonderful except need to cook longer than specified.

I loved this recipe. It presents well. The cooking time does need to be increased, but it also doubles well. Caramel hards quickly, but magically softens in the baking process.

This was the first time I have attempted to make any kind of custard, it turned out to be restaurant quality. Quick enough, toughest part was locating a whole vanilla bean. Will make this again and again.

simple to make but did not yield the rich creamy texture served at fine restaurants..even the kids threw 1/2 of it away. nothing spectacular..maybe it was the nonfat condensed milk? bland at best..

Easy recipe to make. A bit of advise, if doubling this recipe be sure to increase baking time.

I wasn't thrilled with this dessert, but my husband and company liked it. Wasn't as easy as I anticipated based upon the other reviews. Made a mess with the caramelizing process.

This was heavenly and really very easy. Don't worry if the caramel hardens too quickly in the ramekins because it remelts in the baking process. Also, I had to bake it much longer than 40 min. but I am not sure how much longer since I quit counting after 40. I just kept jiggling it until it seemed "set". Will make this again and again!

This was so simple! I was intimidated to try the caramel, but it doesn't get much easier than this. I served this on individual plates drizzled with a raspberry coulis that I had left over from an Easter desssert. Yummy! Will definitely make it again.

This is one of the better flan recipes I have tried. It almost brought me back to the beach restaurant in Acapulco where I first tasted this treat. I poured a bit of Kahlua onto each serving plate for a little extra zing.

This was a wonderful low fat dessert. I doubled recipe and cooking time had to be extended, but it was very good. It was served at a dinner party and everyone loved it.
