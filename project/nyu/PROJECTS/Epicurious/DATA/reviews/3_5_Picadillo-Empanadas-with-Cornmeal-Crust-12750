Honestly,I'm all about being creative with a recipe, but if you are substituting half of the ingredients then you ARE NO LONGER making the recipe. So, please don't review it as if you were. That said, I made this. Loved it. Will make it again. Used currants instead of raisins.

I hate to say it, but I made a lot of substitutions. I usually make a recipe one time without any changes, but . . I was looking for a dinner recipe that didn't involve a trip to the grocery store. I used some already cooked chicken breasts (2)instead of beef, and added 1/3 C. toasted pecans. I threw those in the food processor to grind them up. I also swapped the jalepenos for one roasted poblano pepper. At the end, I added about a tablespoon of capers. I was afraid my picky husband wouldn't like the clove/cinnamon, but the scent was much stronger than the taste. We loved it.I am sure the original recipe would have been even more amazing. I will definitely make these again, and try to make them true to the recipe. The dough was excellent. A small version would be great for appetizers!

Very good filling for empanadas. Everyone who tried it loved it! I can't comment on the dough. I used pre-made flour empanada wrappers that I bought at an Argentian market and baked them. They filling was perfect for them

Great family dish. Husband loved it, I loved it and two-year olds ate it up. I used currants instead of raisins and added some capers in the olive measure/ YUM!!!!

I merged this recipe with the Pork Picadillo & Chipotle Salsa one and the end result was incredible. Substituted sliced pork tenderloin for the chuck, decreased the tomato & paste substantially, added slivered almonds, sour cream, and lime juice. Served with the Chipotle salsa and creme fraiche. People raved about them. I think the sour cream adds just the right amount of moisture and richness to the filling. The original recipe is good too, but you'll love this variation!

An excellent recipe- empanadas sounded daunting to me at first but it was easy. The crust was easy to make and rolled out beautifully. I plan to use this dough for an appetizer recipe as well. It is a big recipe- definitely for a crowd.

I made these a couple of years ago for a friends birthday. I was not sure how well they would go over but so many people have commented on them over the years that I am making them again for my neices wedding reception. I added some cayene but I add it to everything!

I've made this recipe twice and it was a HUGE hit both times. I doubled the amount of chili powder and halved the canned tomatoes. The first time I made them, I ran out of time for the crust and used refrigerated dough. When I tasted the picadillo, I was afraid my guest wouldn't like it because it was very spicy and the raisins were a little too distinct. Once the filling went into the crust, the spiciness was subdued and even my "picky" friends LOVED them. Definitely, a keeper!

I had intended to make the dough for the pork picadillo empanadas on this site for this recipe, but as dinner got later and later, we ended up using the filling in tortillas instead. Yummy! I accidently dumped the entire can of tomato paste into the mix (double what the recipe calls for) and found it a bit too tomato-y. Perhaps next time I'll follow the recipe (spaz that I am)! Otherwise, delicious as written. Oh, I also left out jalapenos, as I'm allergic; substituted cayenne pepper instead, and a few more raisins (I used golden). A keeper, for sure.

I will qualify making this again as I used the crust from Cafe Azul. I also used ground turkey, dried currants and 1/2 the requested tomato products. I added 3 small, diced red potatoes and 1 medium carrot, diced, too. My family enjoyed it made with the above changes. I plan to try this recipe's crust sometime.

My version of picadillo has diced carrots and potato in it. I use about 3 TB of the vinegar from the can of pickled jalapeños and I don't add all those herbs, just a pinch of cumin. Also, use about 5 cloves of garlic, AT LEAST.

Yummy with a capital Y! It's still a lot of work, but for a weekend meal it's ideal. I think that it might have tasted better with less "chopped" tomato and more tomato paste. The dough was great! We really enjoyed it and for a first try at the recipe it turned out great!

I doubled this recipe for about a 20-person crew of an independent film shoot. Made 1/2 vegetarian by breaking veggie burgers into the mix, and adding extra oil and salt. The beef version still tasted much better than the veggie (no doubt). Overall, the recipe is a little more tomato-y than I would like, so I'll cut back on the paste next time. The crust was good, but the dough was a bit dry--would cut back on the flour and make sure I roll the crust thin enough.

This is a great appetizer! I love the dough - it's very easy to work with and flavorful. For those reviewers that had trouble with the dough, I would suggest cutting back on the flour. I didn't use the additional 1/2 cup of flour at all and the empanadas sealed up beautifully (the filling also didn't leak out while they baked). I also made these smaller to serve as appetizers. Use a 2 or 3 inch round cookie cutter and a teaspoon of filling. If you can't find pickled jalapenos, fresh ones work just as well.

I made these as appetizers for a cocktail party. They were a hit! I doubled the crust recipe and used the same amount of meat mixture and had the perfect amount for 48 appetizers. I would definately make these again, but would like to try with a pastry crust just to compare.

I was having a hard time getting the empanadas to close, so I tried a different variation: mix one part cream cheese and one part sour cream and spread on a baking sheet. Spread the picadillo over, then sprinkle mozarella or monterey jack cheese over and quick heat in the oven. It makes a GREAT dip for nachos.

I decided to jump in with both feet and double this recipe because I was trying it out for a party and needed a lot. It was absolutley delicious but I made them slightly smaller than the recipe because I served them as an appetiser. I got 38 from the doubled recipe but had quite a bit of the meat mixture left. The empanadas were very popular and I will be making them again. The only problem I had was that I found the pies had to be sealed really well or opened up even though I thought I had sealed them the first time.

This recipe got good reviews from my dinner guests. I accidentially added 2cups tomato paste (instead of the 1/4 cup), which made the filling much richer and juicier -- the taste was still good. Instead of the cornmeal crust, I used ready-made pastry dough and baked them in the oven, so that I didn't need to fry them.

I recently made this recipe for a dinner club party and served it as an appetizer. To make the dough, I used my bread machine on dough cycle, which worked perfectly. I also cut each empanada into 3 inch circles to be appetizer size. I made an egg wash and used when I sealed the empandas which worked well. I also egg washed the top of the empanada, I would not do that again because it seemed to make them brown to quickly. I served the empandas with the fresh tomato salsa recipe which is on this web site, and a side of sour cream. They were very popular.
