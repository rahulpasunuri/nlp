Like the cook from berlin, I also used regular mozzarella. Didn't have a pizza pan, so I flipped over my thickest cookie sheet and cooked in the oven according to recipe. I made it for boys and they loved it!

Store bought crusts, cheese not smoked....but, yes, very tasty! Will do again properly when I have the time.

Made this once while catering Mardi Gras dinner theatre event, and it disappeared as soon as it was laid out. Made it again for a family gathering, and it's now high on everyone's request list. Using a store-bought crust made it easy without detracting: Use the pre-made crust, adjust the spice for everyone's tastes and it's a fuss-free winner.

I've made this several times and we all enjoyed it. I jazzed it up with a little creole seasoning and substiuted crawfish for the shrimp.

There was nothing special about this pizza except alot of work. I won't do this again. (Sounded better in print!)

The prep time on the creole is well worth the effort. (It took longer than the recipe said to reduce the creole on the simmer) However, everyone loved this pizza and go ahead - splurge on the smoked mozz - it adds the perfect finish to the dish. Delish!
