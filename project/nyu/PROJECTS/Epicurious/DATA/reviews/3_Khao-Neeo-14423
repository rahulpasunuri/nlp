Worked out perfectly using my regular old steamer. I used the rice (known as sweet rice at the Asian Market) as a side for my Thai BBQ menu, as well as for mangos and coconut milk for dessert. Came out perfect!

Order your Thai steamer from the Wok Shop (via Amazon sales) and use cheescloth to line it. Super simple; 2 cups serves 8 as Sticky Rice w/Mango.

The dessert sticky rice recipe I learnt in Thailand involved cooking the rice with coconut milk and sugar... not sprinkling them over, as suggested below. Although that could be a shortcut it sounds messy.

This recipe is good for the sticky rice part of sticky rice with mango. When in season, get a hold of 2 or 3 mangos, cut lengthwise, drizzel 1/2 cup coconut milk and 1/2 cup sugar over the whole desert and squeeze fresh lime on the dish. GREAT!

Rcipe worked incredibly well. Best sticky rice I've had in a long time. Big hit with the family. I was sure to buy Thai "sweet" rice from Thailand.

I purchased a conical basket and boiling pot from a local Thai store along with the rice. With some basic and helpful instructions from the store owner I was able to enjoy the best steamed rice I have ever had. Not only the excellent taste, it was the wonderful aroma that made this dish so great.

I'm not the best cook out there, but this recipe was easy, simple, & great. I knew I like Thai food for some reason, & now I know why.
