These potatoes are great. I felt the amount of goat cheese was pretty right on. I added some extra, but not too much because I still wanted to taste the onion and butter. (If all I wanted to taste was goat cheese, I'd just eat goat cheese). A note for those who worry about overcooked onions: you can strain them out. The milk/ butter mixture will still be infused with onion flavor but you won't have to worry about the texture.

Fantastic, I will definitely make these again. I agree it is about not over cooking the onions and using a whole stick of butter verses 3/4. Yummy!

Maybe it's because of my dulled taste buds, but I have to use about 8 oz. of Goat Cheese to taste it. My friend, who has sharper taste buds, thought it was fantastic at 4 oz. But when you figure out how much your guests like, this is superb. I have made this three times for friends, and will make it again in the future.

I wouldn't make this again. i added much more goat cheese than the recipe called for and we still didn't taste it that much. It was an OK recipe. I even used an herb goat cheese, but it still wasn't exceptional and delicious.

DELICIOUS! You must try this recipe. Who would have thought adding goat cheese to mashed potatoes would taste so great?

Yummy and so easy! You cannot go wrong with this recipe.

Really enjoyed these potatoes. Easy and very tasty. Instead of plain goat cheese I used a garlic herb coated goat cheese.

One of my favorite side dishes. I have made it several times and always have rave reviews. The trick is to not overcook the onions.

This would be a good accompaniment for a particully goat cheese friendly main course (lamb, etc), but didn't really mesh with the dinner it was paired with (chicken, green beans, etc). For solid, versatile mashed potatoes, I'll stick with creamier cheeses (i.e. gruyere), but will keep this recipe as a 'specialty' side, along with wasabi mashed potatoes for red meat dinners.

i caramelized the onions and added minced garlic. i wanted to cut down the fat some, so i used a mix of nonfat milk and nonfat half+half, subbed half the butter for olive oil, and it turned out great! only problem i had was that the potatoes weren't as thick and fluffy as i hoped -- next time i'd pour the milk mixture in and blend until i get the right consistency instead of using it all at once.

Added some extra goat cheese and family loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the end product was a bit bland. They don't reheat well, either. My husband was a big fan, though.

Delicious! We used a herbed soft goat cheese with terrific results. Great comfort food.

Comfort-Food-Licious! I've made these a few times now and find them even more "deelish" with extra goat cheese. Fantastic with any braised meat dish (osso bucco, lamb shanks, beef in burgundy etc). I've had more compliments on these than any other "mashed" I've ever made.

This is the perfect partner to "Pan Seared Chicken" (with Goat Cheese Mashed Potatoes). Glad to find one additional delicious way to fix mashed spuds. Try the above-mentioned recipe if you haven't.

Fantastic! I made this exactly per the recipe - although I may have had 3 1/2 #'s of potatoes instead of the recommended 3 #'s - and the milk measurement was exactly right. The goat cheese is not overpowering - which is particularly nice if you are serving with a flavorful meat dish - such as the Bon Appetit - Rack of Lamb with Port and Olive Sauce. These two dishes complimented each other perfectly and were DELICIOUS!

A very easy to make dish, I guess I was surprised at how subtle the flavor of the goat cheese was. If I had to do it again, I would add more goat cheese. Not bad taste and definitely better than just plain mashed potatoes.

This dish was very yummy. The potatoes had a nice bite to them due to the goat cheese--although, next time I think I will use the herbed goat cheese for extra flavor. I also used skim instead of whole milk and it turned out just as good.

Made this exactly as per the recipe the first time and it was excellent. But when I made it the 2nd time, I realized I had no milk at the last moment and used extra goat cheese - it was even better!

Very Tasty - nice and easy. Made it with herb rolled goat cheese and it was just perfect!Watch the amount of the butter/milk/onion sauce you add - maybe I didn't prepare enough potatoes - but had I added all of the sauce - this could have become soup very easily.

Very very good!

I made these potatoes to go with the Pan-Seared Chicken and what an excellent meal!! The potatoes can be made as an accompaniment to other entrees - they are sooo fabulous and as others have commented you can vary the amount of goat cheese according to your taste and menu.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! Fabulous taste, very easy to make. I agree with others that I would increase the amount of goat cheese for greater taste.

Very good with a mild goat cheese flavor - next time I will increase the cheese for a greater 'oomph'. Substituted shallots & 2% milk, which didn't seem to detract from the recipe.

Delicious!! (Although I did double the goat cheese content for extra zip!) So EASY to make, it's a fantastic do-ahead recipe. It also works well with your beautiful Herb and Spice Roasted Beef Tenderloin - using baby Spinach instead of Arugula! Always a hit!

This was a wonderful addition to Thanksgiving Dinner. My entire family raved about dish!

I love the idea of goat cheese more than the actual taste. I made this for a large dinner party and EVERYONE loved it! The goat cheese had a definite presence but was subtle and added depth of flavor to the potatoes. I've since added roasted or sauteed garlic and it keeps getting better. Gastronomically prude friends request this when I host dinners!

My husband and I thought these were very good. I did sub goat cheese with basil and roasted garlic and thought it added a little kick.

I thought these potatoes came out wonderfully. They were incredibly light and fluffy. Might add more goat cheese next time, as the flavor was very faint.

We did not care for this mashed potato recipe at all. Did not like the taste or the texture Would not make it again.

This was very good, but I probably wouldn't make it again because I think there are even better potato recipes available. The pancetta mashed potatoes out of Bon Appetit a few months ago were amazing. I'm not sure I'll ever find another mashed potato recipe I like as much.
