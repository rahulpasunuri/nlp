I've been on an Asian cooking jag lately, and decided this looked fun. It wasn't hard, except for prepping the kumquats, which got tedious. I followed the recipe exactly, except that the thighs had skin and the breasts did not. This is important. The recipe works SO MUCH BETTER with skin on. The thighs with skin were moist and succulent, with a lovely crispy skin. The skinless breasts were just... not so great. My family loved this recipe, but I'm not keeping it for this reason. I felt that the taste of the turmeric in the rub gave the chicken a taste that was trying to be Indian, but it wasn't really Indian. It was something else, and it didn't really work for my palate. But if you ask my family, they think I'm nuts. One dimensional. Not me! That's my take on the rub. Now if you added some more curry spices... maybe.

My husband & I both liked this recipe. The sauce is sweet and spicy. We used tangelos instead of kumquats. We reduced the fresh ginger to 1T, instead of 1/2 cup, and we also reduced the cayenne pepper.

Very flavorful dish. Definitely serve with something subtle (rice & veggies), as the sauce and rub are a bit intense. My chicken only took 15 minutes to cook in the oven after broiling.

Great large group entertaining dish; rubbed and sauce made in advance. Made x4 with chicken breasts for 22 people with black sticky rice and veg. Substitute d chopped tangerine for unavailable kumquats, and added chopped red bell pepper for a bit more color. Seared chicken on gas grill rather than broiler. Meat was indeed very moist. A keeper!

After trying this recipe, I made just the dressing and used it on salmon - it was really good. DH thinks it was better on the salmon than on the chicken, but he likes fish better than chicken any day.....

Spicy, sweet and savory and everyone kept commenting how moist the chicken was and were "impressed" although it was easy. I used breast and thighs with the bone in and it was great! Suggestions: Make the rub in advance and the sauce in advance so you just rub the chicken and cook it. It makes it easy for entertaining and the sauce was better after the flavors melded.

Added a bit of cinnamon to the rub and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. So yummy. My fiance said best chiken he ever ate, and he is not a poultry fan.Dressing accented this dish nicely but the chicken could stand alone.
