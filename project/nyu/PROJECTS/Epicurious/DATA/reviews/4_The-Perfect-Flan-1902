OMG! I've never made flan before and always thought if was beyond my level of expertise to do so. I started by trying this recipe...let me tell you, I was, in no way, disappointed! I even surprised myself! My suggestion, especially if you are trying to make something for a dinner party for a nice little desert...MAKE THIS RECIPE! Yum!

I love this flan for its simplicity and delicious balance of flavors. I have to admit that I don't make it using the vanilla bean anymore. I use a teaspoon of good vanilla extract instead and no one can tell the difference. Also, I bake the flan in a souffle dish to achieve the more traditional, large round flan shape. My brother-in-law's family are all allergic to gluten and this flan is a naturally gluten-free dessert I can serve them! I have to admit, though, that this flan doesn't seem completely like a traditional flan that you would get in an Argentinian, Mexican or Colombian restaurant. It is a little more on the creme brulee side--silky, not eggy, and not as firm as a traditional Latin American flan.

Thought this recipe was spot on! Made this for my daughter's "Day of Dead" celebration for her spanish class. A very smooth texture and wonderful taste. I doubled the recipe and used my 9" round corning ware. Worked fine - was in the oven for approximately 45 minutes +/-, but watch carefully, if the top browns too much it develops a skin that is not too appetizing. Brought back alot of memories of my childhood holiday parties. Also very easy to clean, just soak in warm water and the caramel melts away.

Perfect flan is right! I used a scant tablespoon of vanilla instead of the vanilla bean and skipped the steeping step--just brought the cream mixture to a nice simmer and added it carefully to the eggs--and it was still perfect. Perfect texture, perfect flavor. So, so good.

Excellent recipe! I reduced the sugar to 6 tablespoons and added the corn syrup as others had suggested. The sugar continued to cook and turned even darker while I poured it into the ramekins...so I suggest taking it off the burner when it's just "medium" amber rather than dark amber.

Have made this a dozen or so times. It's wonderful! This flan is great! I used 2 cups whipping cream, 12 oz canned milk, 3 whole eggs, 5 yolks, 7 TBL sugar Made 8 ramekins. Will try TBL spoon of corn syrup next time in caramel.

This really is the perfect classic flan, and surprisingly easy to prepare. I used 15% cream plus the milk and found it was sufficiently rick. If like me you have difficulty preventing the caramel from crystallizing, the trick is to add some corn syrup (about 1 tbsp) to the sugar at the beginning.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I used evaporated milk instead of whole milk and added a cinnamon stick with the cream, milk and vanilla bean mixture. Making the caramel was easy but watch it closely when it starts to turn golden. It can darken pretty fast after that. I've tried other flan recipes at this site and they were always a bit too eggy for me. This one is creamier and smoother with just the right sweetness. Definitely one I'll make again.

After reading other reviews, I was careful to get the caramel off the heat at just the right time. This was a winner! Made a double batch, used glass loaf pans as molds, and added coconut to one of them (which I didn't strain). Used as dessert following paella for a dinner party. Huge hit! Everyone had seconds -- of both kinds!

This was delicious...but do not expect to "get it" on the first try. I messed up caramelizing the sugar two times before it turned out OK. Third time's the charm. I loved the results but didn't expect so much work. I'd still make it again though.

As one who has never had much luck with making brittles, I was worried about the sugar step. I used a pyrex pie pan instead of individual ramekins. Yet despite the fact that my sugar topping had bits of sugar in it, when it all comes together it blended very nicely. I have never made flan before but this recipe allowed me to make one of the best flans I've ever tasted. The crowd agreed!

This was an excellent recipe. Although I agree it was more like creme brulee filling. I didn't have a vanilla bean and used 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract. It worked great. I made mine in a 2 quart casserole dish since I doubled it, worked great but took a long time to cook, almost 90 minutes. so if you do that make sure you plan accordingly.

I agree with some previous reviewers: This isn't really flan, not when it's made mostly with heavy cream. This turns out to be more like an overdone creme brulee. If you are expecting flan, you will end up with this desssert that is far too rich and heavy. Look elsewhere for a flan recipe.

My mom has been dropping not so subtle hints lately about how much she likes flan but how nobody (meaning me) ever makes it for her. So, I made this recipe to finish off her mother's day dinner. I made it in the cute little ramekins I had bought her for mother's day. Within 2 days, she eaten not only the one for dinner, but the 2 leftovers. Needless to say, they were a big hit. Easy to make. Smooth, creamy custard. I did not have vanilla bean, so I flavored the custard with about 1/2 tsp instant espresso granules. After turning the flan out, I had a bit of a panic as it looked like the heat of the caramel had cracked the bottom of the brand new ramekins. Fortunately, it was just that the hardened caramel remaining on the bottom of the cup was cracked. Anyhow, I would highly recommend.

Rating: 4
Terrific. I, too, used this dessert to cap off a Mexican-themed meal (Cinco de Mayo). Not a scrap was left; everyone loved it. It was quite perfect--to the eye and the palate. I read all of the reviews and am a grateful recipient of the advice regarding the caramel. TAKE HEED of the advice to stay within the light amber color parameter. For any errant crystalized sugar, dispatch it quickly with vinegar. This was my first flan. I made it the day of the meal but flash cooled in a bin to which I added ice an salt water. They cooled and set beautifully. Popped out perfectly. It does taste a bit eggy--not a criticism, but merely a description of the end result.

Fabulous! I highly recommend this recipe for the texture. Be sure to strain it - you'll be surprised what will be left in the strainer even after carefully beating the eggs. I, too, had a drift of vanilla specks across the top of the flan. I feel it gives it a homemade appearance. And my thanks to all fellow cooks who write reviews with their variations!

Rating: 3
Absolutely delicious. The other reviewers are correct - do not let the sugar become amber - when you see the sugar has become golden is the time to get moving. By the time you start pouring and swirling the sugar will have become amber in color. Waiting for deep amber color will guarantee a burned flavor. I didn't bother to put the custard through a sieve and it was like velvet. Really perfect. Also, people who found this flan not dense and rich enough are looking for a QUESILLO, not flan.

This is my second go round...have discovered the secret to getting the hardened caramel out of the ramekins ...you must let this sit for 24 hrs before serving (refrigerated). The caramel then gets all soft and oozy and easily drips all over your flan when you plate it. Then just drop the ramekins into hot soapy water and everything comes right out! A definite do ahead (so welcome!!) dessert.

This was outstanding and easier to make than the recipe actually looks. (getting the hardened caramel off the ramekins will be the challenge) Had one guest ask for another one! Another big plus for this recipe is that you can make it well ahead of time and serving it up is simple! The dogs are still working on that caramel!

I was looking for a dessert to round out a mexican menu for company and came across this. YUMMY! I am not a fan of flan, maybe I always had bad stuff at restaurants that was more gelatin-like, but this was incredible, more like a creme brulee. Guests could not believe how great it was, I had a few ramekins left in the fridge and people fought over seconds.

This dish reminds me of LECHE FLAN, a popular dessert in the Philippines traditionally prepared using duck eggs (origin is way back during the Spanish colonial times hence the similarity to the Spanish crema catalana from which the English creme caramel and the French creme brulee evolved). These days, chicken eggs (preferably farm fresh as they make for a brighter colored and better tasting flan) are used as they are more readily available. The mixture is poured into oval-shaped metallic molds called llaneras which are stovetop-safe and in which the caramel can be prepared directly. As with any traditional recipe, there are many variations. My favorites include: A. 6 egg yolks, 1 large can evaporated milk, 1 large can sweetened condensed milk. This makes a special melt-in-your mouth flan. B. 6 egg yolks plus 2 whole eggs, 1 large can each of evaporated and sweetened condensed milks. Whole eggs (egg whites) are added for more structure but still a tender flan. C. 6 whole eggs plus 2 yolks, 1 large can each of evaporated and sweetened condensed milks. A less rich version, firmer. D. 4 eggs, 1 large can each of evaporated and sweetened condensed milks. A less eggy version. The ingredients are simply mixed together using one direction during mixing, being careful not to make the mixture bubbly, then preferably strained through a cheesecloth especially if using egg whites in the recipe so as to remove the chalazae. Vanilla extract or a strip of dayap rind (similar to key lime) is added for flavoring. The covered custard mixture is steamed (great if you only have one oven and preparing other baked/oven-roasted dishes) or baked in a bain marie. This recipe is another variation of a wonderful dessert, especially handy when I don't have evap/condensed milk on hand.

I've made this several times now and it is 'perfect'. It's very rich - - almost creme brule-ish. I love it since it doesn't have any of the eggy-custard flavor some flans have. It's a truely elegant way to end a dinner party. The caramel part is tricky if you've never done it before - - it took a couple of tries and a lot of wasted sugar for me to get it. My advice - - don't fuss with the sugar - - just let it melt and boil on it's own and make sure to catch it in time. I used tahitian vanilla beans and added some more extract to the mix for added vanilla flavor. Make sure to use really great quality vanilla in this one since the flavor really shines through!

This was my first attempt at making flan- and it was a total success. It was Off the charts! My guests thought it was amazing, too. My advice, as mentioned below, is to make sure the sugar sauce reaches the amber color before pouring into the ramekins- it makes a huge difference in flavor. Also, it took me longer than 10 mins to achieve the right color, FYI. A keeper/classic!

This was excellent! Surprisingly excellent, really. The directions make it sound sort of complicated, but it's not at all. My boyfriend says it tastes better the 2nd and 3rd day, which makes it ideal for dinner parties. It didn't seem that the vanilla bean would impart too much flavor, but it's worth it! I have been asked to make it again for friends this week (it's one of my new favorite recipes).

I plan to make it for a dinner party soon-- I love that you make it ahead and it is quite pretty unmolded. Go for it!

Just Fab! I keep making this Flan and never disappointed. The trick below sounds like a good idea. Burnt caramelo will ruin this dessert so do whatever it takes to get the carmelo right. This flan is very light but full of flavor. Don't scimp on the vanilla bean, it is a must. Williams Sonoma carries a small vile with 2 whole beans.

Rating: 0
Haven't tried this recipe, but for those cooks who had problems with the caramel continuing to cook after you remove it from the stove: Fille your sink with a couple inches of water. When you remove the pan from the heat, dip the bottom of the pan into the water. This will stop the caramel from cooking, but leave it hot enough to be able to pour easily.

I made this the other night as a practice run, and very glad that I had done so! I've never had a flan before, so wasn't sure what to expect. As mentioned, very reminiscient of a creme brulee, and quite good. I also had a bit of trouble with the caramel. At first, I thought it was fine, and it blossomed to a beautiful caramel colour. When the flan was plated and served, it again looked fine. My first taste discovered a slight, burnt taste to the sugar. My other testers said they didn't notice it, but it seemed somewhat overpowering to me. Beneath the caramel, all was well. When I make this next week, I'll be sure to pull the caramel out a bit earlier than I did this time.

Excellent flan!! I didn't have a problem with the caramel. I cooked it until the edges were dark amber and the middle was still a light golden color. The trick is not to stir the caramel while it is cooking and be patient.

I, too, had a difficult time with the caramel: it didn't carmelize until all of the water had evaporated. I made this recipe for a Spanish meal I was catering and had some of the batter left-over the next day. I re-made the caramel sauce using just sugar and it turned out fine. I don't know if the problem had to do with my very tick-bottomed pans (Le Crueset) or if someting else was wrong. I will write to Cook's Illustrated to ask them if they know what went wrong with my first caramel attempt, unless any other cooks care to add their opinion. Great recipe, though, rave reviews from thre dinner guests.

Just a tip for those of you who have trouble with the caramel. This is my Mexican mother's short cut. Just use maple syrup. Put the empty dish in the freezer until your are ready to pour the flan. Then pour the maple syrup (the cold congeals the syrup bit to keep it from mixing with the flan mixture.) Add a dash of Kaluha for a extra kick pour the flan and bake.

Rating: 0
just a note to the reviewer who couldn't caramelize the sugar mixture. Melt the sugar without the water and without stirring until sugar is melted. Watch carefully as the sugar darkens quickly after it melts. Add water when the sugar begins to turn a rich amber color, stand back as the liquid may spatter.

Tasted great but I was frustrated with the amount of time it took to cook the caramel, and never did get it to turn "amber" even after cooking for almost an hour. It hardened as soon as it was poured in the dishes, making it a bit difficult to swirl. Guests ate with gusto, none the less.

The flavor and texture of this was very good, but the vanilla beans settled on the top of the flipped over cooked dessert. One unexpected disaster was that when I was pouring the caramel into the ramekins it continued to cook and was slightly burnt by my last 4 ramekins. It also got thick and gooey very quickly, I must have overcooked it. Still was tasty though and was enjoyed by my family as my first attempt at Flan.

This flan recipe was a huge hit among all my friends!! One friend even exclaimed that it was the BEST flan he had ever tasted in his entire life.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.

This is an excellent flan. I agree with the earlier reviewer who recommends taking the sugar off the heat as soon as it begins to darken, I waited too long and the sugar continued to cook after I had removed it from the stove, and took on a slightly burnt flavor. The custard was outstanding, I found it to be very creamy and smooth and I like the subtle texture that the vanilla beans added.

Rating: 2
My colleagues raved about it but I thought it wasn't as silky smooth as it should be. Perhaps I overcooked it because I made the flan in a loaf pan, and I wasn't sure how to adjust the oven time (I baked it for 60-65 minutes). I was hesitant to overmix the custard, and I was disappointed by the vanilla seeds that had settled ("Trust me, it's not dirt!") on the top/bottom. I will try other flan recipes before coming back to this one.

This was the best flan I've ever had. I made sure to pull the caramel off the heat just as it started to turn a dark amber (it kept cooking off the heat and got even darker). I checked it after 35 minutes in the oven and was horrified to see that a thin skin on top was golden brown and puffed up! Maybe my oven was too hot and overcooked the top, but I pulled it out and peeled off the burnt skin and it was still wonderful. I needed nine for a Mexican themed dinner party, but doubled the recipe so I had three extra in case I messed up the unmolding process. After chilling for three hours, I couldn't wait to see if it worked and tested one. I let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, but it was still cool on the bottom, so I put it in a bowl of hot water for about 30 seconds and it unmolded beautifully. I didn't need to let it chill overnight and I still have two extra just for me!

I served this flan to the 14 members of my women's group. They voted it the best flan they had ever had. The biggest compliment was from the our hispanic member.

Although I liked the recipe, this is NOT a typical Spanish flan. The original recipe may have regional variations, but it is usually made only with eggs, milk, sugar and grated lemon rind. Actually it's more a non-fuss, staple dessert in most homes, than a fancy dish. My family recipe is as follows: Beat 6 large eggs, add 2 cups milk, 7 tbsps sugar and 1 teasp. grated lemon rind. Mix well. Pour in caramelised ramekins. Put them in large oven sheet with water. Cook them for 1/2 hour (300F) or until knife inserted comes out clean. Wait until completely cool to turn them over in plates.

This is the best, foolproof flan I've ever made. I have used this recipe twice since the first time I made it and I've mastered the sugar bit. I've used half and half once and whipping cream once and one time I had no milk and I substitued 1/2 whipping cream an 1/2 water and each time it has come out fine. I also only used vanilla extract because I have no idea where to get vanilla bean. But it comes out perfect everytime. This last time I made it I used a corning ware pie plate and even then it was just fine. I absolutely love this recipe!

I made this recipe for a mexican-themed Christmas dinner this year. It was truly fantastic. I had never made flan before, so I was a little intimidated. The only problem I had was that I burned the caramel on my first try. The recipe says to cook the caramel until it is a dark amber. But by the time I got it poured into the cups, it was more of a black gooey mess. My second try was much more successful. I took it off of the heat as soon as I saw a little bit of golden brown color, and it worked perfectly. The recipe also doubles well, as I had to make a double batch for a big family crowd. I will definitely make this again!!!

It was so good my friends asked me to quit my job and make flan for a living! Make sure you cook sugar until its nice and golden color, about 12 minutes on medium high heat. The vanilla bean really adds flavor that vanilla extract can't match. It's an expensive ingredient but worth it

The flan was PERFECT! I brought it to a Mexican dinner party and everyone loved it. I made it in a glass pie pan instead of individual ramekins and it turned out beautifully, but I went to wash the pie plate and it had spider cracks throughout (I think that it must have cracked when the hot caramel went into it), so next time I will make it in a metal dish, but otherwise it was a lot easier than I expected and it really was amazing!

although i haven't made this recipe yet, i fully intend to. i noticed that a couple people were looking for a creamier, denser flan, and i just tried a recipe from a hispanic friend who uses cream cheese in the flan. while i prefer a more custard-y texture, the cream cheese may be the ingredient that you are looking for. she also uses evaporated milk in the recipe.

Yes, I agree with all of you that this is a delicious recipe, but unfortunately, it still is not what I'm searching for. In fact, I would have called this the "Perfect Custard" recipe.

It is absolutely the best dessert I have put in my mouth. If any of you fellow epicureans know what I am referring to, and if you have the recipe, please, please let e-mail me.

I made mine in one large dish and it turned out somewhat dense. The flavor was great though! I got a lot of compliments. Be careful not to over carmelize the sugar! It'll taste burnt.

Very, very tasty and not unlike spooning velvet. I received the highest compliments from my Argentinean friends who didn't think a Gringa could recreate a Latin American specialty. I baked mine in a cake pan for one large serving.
