We loved the simplicity of this dish! We use a marinated chevre that our local goat farm makes for some extra zip (it has cracked pepper and herbs in the olive oil marinade) and halved grape tomatoes (unblanched for a little crunch and extra freshness) instead of plums. It is easier to get nice grape tomatoes than plums out of season. Quick and yummy. Will try the pine nuts next time!

This is very good. I upped the vinegar to 2 Tablespoons and also added a little more goat cheese. I tossed in at the end to get it warm, but not completely melted. I also added toasted pine nuts and artichoke hearts. Good for a quick weeknight meal.

Decent, but mostly blah.

This was fair but not that interesting. The simplicity was nice as was the fresh basil but I think we will experiment with adding a bit more to it next time. Maybe we will incorporate some of the suggestions from the other posts.

I've made this recipe twice now - both times with canned tomatoes. Its a cinch to make and has worked out great both times. This last time I added some pre-cooked shrimp which I warmed up in a pan with some olive oil and garlic. Perfect for those on the run!

Considering the fact that you can easily whip this together (if you're using drained canned tomatoes anyway) in the time it takes to cook the pasta, this is pretty tasty. I also warmed the tomato mixture in the microwave.

Very good, especially for being so easy. I have made in a rush after work twice - all but the goat cheese and basil are pantry items (I think the fresh basil makes a difference). I did use a drained 28-oz can of tomatoes (chopped/smashed), and warmed the tomato mixture in the microwave while I made the rest. This would be great in the summer!

I was a little nervous reading the review which stated this recipe is somewhat "blah" so I incorporated every one of the other reviewers suggestions - more garlic, purple basil as well as green, etc. I even toasted pine nuts for a garnish, and I'm sure that would have been nice if I'd remembered to use them! I also added a pinch each of Italian seasoning and hot red pepper flakes. I used rotini (a smaller version of rotelli or "springs"). To avoid rapid cooling of an uncooked sauce, I slightly warm my sauce in the microwave and heat the serving dishes with the boiling pasta water. Oh, and I gilded the lily with a sprinkling of Parmesan. This is a lovely, tasty pasta dish, and I'll definitely make it again.

Yum. I added an extra clove of garlic. The only thing is that it turned cold pretty quickly, so maybe I'd warm the pasta bowls next time.

I loved this! And so did everyone at our annual block party, even though it's not a typical block-party dish. I used well-drained canned, already peeled tomatoes, which was a lot easier than peeling, chopping, etc. I also used a mix of purple and green basil, which with the tomatoes created a beautiful array of colors. Definitely a recommended dish!

My husband absolutely loves goat cheese and helped himself 4 times to more!! Delicious recipe and very simple. I used penne rigate instead of fusilli. If you aren't a garlic lover, don't use as much. Since it is raw garlic it is very garlicy. Excellent for leftovers the next night!!

Even though I had no basil, this was incredibly good -- and so easy. I have definitely had less successful dishes similar to this in restaurants, so I was exceedingly pleased with the results. I will make this again and again.

This recipe was really good...I used fettucine and added Vidalia onions and toasted pine nuts. It's also really good cold the next day so make enough for leftovers.

This recipe was okay, just nothing special. Given the other good things you could do with these ingredients, it seemed a little bit of a waste to use them on something so relatively blah.

This is a great tasty quick meal. I usually make it with a good quality canned tomato since I can't get good fresh tomatoes where I live. A good vegetarian dish.
