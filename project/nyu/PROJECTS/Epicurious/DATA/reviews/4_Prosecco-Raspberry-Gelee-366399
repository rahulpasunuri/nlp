A brilliant summer recipe that is VERY easy For something different substitute some of the raspberries for passion fruit pulp and the prosecco for an asti moscato. Went down an absolute hit at a recent dinner party

I've made this twice now to raving reviews. The PERFECT dessert for a hot summer night. It is so pretty and quite simple to make.

Completely refreshing, and still retains some of the effervescence of the Prosecco! I was dubious on this point, but was totally satisfied with the end result. As the previous review states, whent you get to the step of dividing out the dishes, the mixture seems cloudy. But I'm lazy and didn't feel like straining. NO problem! It separates itself out...bottom stays lovely and clear (although with a pinker tinge than the photo shows), and the top is raspberries and any raspberry bits. Still good enough for company, without whipping out the chinois, cheesecloth, whatever. YUM! (And I promise, I'm not a pastry chef...I burn ever dessert I attempt, and this one turned out great. Good for a beginner trying to impress!)

This is a sophisticated, elegant and easy dessert for a summer night. I found that straining the Prosecco mixture before I divided it among the glasses removed impurities and gave it a clearer, more translucent look.
