My husband and I have been making this ever since our family made it during a shore retreat in DE with fresh shrimp. The original recipe appeared in Gourmet with lamb and red pepper, and shrimp and sweet onion, all using the same marinade (only marinating the vegetables, lamb and shrmip seperately). It's delicious. We find the longer it marinades, the better.

Bland and unremarkable

I prepared this in November under the broiler. Very tasty, one left with the recipe. Didn't have mortar and pestel so I used the blender to frappe herbs, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil. Bought leg of lamb and cut into chunks, marinated for 7 hours rather than overnight so as not to lose the lamb flavor. Rave reviews. Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, light salad, and bread with roasted garlic. of course a nice cabernet too (meridian 98). Recommended for all lamb lovers.
