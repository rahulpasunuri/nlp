My sauce curdled like I knew it would when you pour cream directly on white wine and lemon juice. Sauce was too thin. I made much better than this, should have gone with my know-how and experience.

Terrific. Used thighs and breasts then deboned and tossed in sauce to create a kind of fricassee stew. Also blitzed a cup of the vegetables to add to the dish. Served over egg noodles which was good and plan to try it over mash next time... Definitely will repeat!

Easy and wonderful recipe, although a bit time consuming. I did make a few changes, however. I added crushed red pepper to the sauce during the boil as well as cayenne pepper when I dusted the chicken. I also used 4 pounds of chicken thighs with the bone in. Everything came out wonderfully. The taste was to die for. I served it with blue cheese au gratin potatoes and a nice salad.

You can use this sauce with debonded chicken pieces that are cut very thin. Just dust them with flour before cooking them. Also take the chicken out after it's cooked and keep it warm. Then make the sauce. Put the chicken on top of egg noodles and pour the sauce over it.

A lot of work to produce what turned out to be a mildly interesting dish. Wish I had cooked the sauce longer to make it slightly thicker.

This recipe is perfect for company or special occassion. Rich flavors. I made it again last night for a dinner party and there were no leftovers. We had a holiday party with a small group including children so I served it without sauce for the children and everyone raved about it.

I think that if I were planning to spend this much time, go through this many steps, and use all these ingredients, I might consider a different dish. Enjoyable, though I have enjoyed other fricassees more than this one. They seem to be an older style dish--it's difficult to find many recipes for them, though I would be interested to try more fricassee recipes rather than repeating this one.

Delish! I used half and half instead of cream with no loss of richness to the dish or difficulty with sauce breaking. I also reserved the carrots, per another reviewers advice, and served them along side the chicken with good results. (Peeled baby carrots instead of chopped.) Good call! Perfect match for a nice white Burgundy.

I made this dish on a tues. nite for my husband it was really delicious, it has a few steps but I like to cook. I used fat free half and half and it was still very good. I cut the amt. of dijon, I would add more for even more flavor next time. Yummy!-- I also used just chicken pieces, because of just the two of us.

YUM! Comfort food at it's finest. -I made this dish for my family. While my husband loves everything I make, my 12 and 15 yr old daughters are pickier and they ate every bite. This is definately special enough to make for guests. The preparation was very easy. I cut back 1/2 cup on the cream and did not add the extra flour. Sauce was not compromised in the least and we saved a few calories. Make sure you use organic or home grown lemons for the fullest flavor.

i thought this was good, but not fantastic, rather bland. add the number of pots to scrub after...probably won't make again.

I wanted to make a special dinner, but this took a little longer that I thought it would. Also I didn't know what exactly I was getting, so you should know that is makes a thick creamy lemony sauce to puddle around the chicken pieces. It's very elegant and "French" and could be used for entertaining guests. It turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly. My husband LOVED it and ate everything. One chicken was just enough for one meal for the two of us. Suggest you make sure the chicken is dried thoroughly before salting and dredging in flour, you'll get a better, crispier coating that way.

This was a very simple dish to prepare, but did take some time. I hated to throw out the onions and carrots so I served them on the side with some broccoli.I would add more lemon next time.

A wonderful dish with sophisticated flavor that is not difficult to prepare. The cook time may seem long, but there is ample down time to prepare side dishes. I served it with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts, which went very well with the sauce. My husband and I both agreed it was a fantastic Saturday night dinner.
