I've made this twice so far and it's well worth the time put into the sauce. I usually end up with more than I can use, so I've slathered the rest on a pork loin the next day. It's a beautiful presentation too. Good for company and feeding large crowds.

Really disappointing. I found the taste of the soy sauce very overbearing

I LOVED this recipe. Made it for a fancy dinner party, so I prepped the glaze the night before. It was a challenge to cook down, but not get it too hot, but worth the effort and time. The salmon was a gorgeous pink, and sooo tender. Usually, salmon's pretty easy to overcook, but I think you have a larger window when you are doing a slow roasting method.

Great recipe! The glaze was easy with a fantastic flavor - I pan roasted some chicken breasts for the kids and finished them in the oven with the rest of the glaze and they were almost as good as the salmon!

This was a lot of work (for the glaze) and a lot of time for pretty mediocre flavor in my opinion. There are lots of better ways to prepare salmon.

Delicious and one of the best salmon recipes I have made if done properly. If it's acrid you probably burned it, so only avoid it if you intend to burn it.

I burned the glaze the first time making it and had to redo it. You have to watch it carefully when it begins to thicken. Other than that, this was a fabulous dish and I have had many requests for the recipe. Very intense flavor, we loved it.

This has to be one of the worst recipes I have ever made. I did everything exactly as described. The result was a nasty acrid flavor that ruined a beautiful Copper River Filet. Please avoid this recipe at all costs and find another similar one.

strange recipe, I was worried I burned the glaze, it tasted over salty and had bits on bottom of pan (I thought were burnt). I had used crushed, jar ginger, so maybe that was left from ginger. But we used anyway, and after glazing/cooking on salmon, it really enhanced the fish, didn't taste burnt at all. Everyone loved it.

I've made this recipe several times and always to rave reviews. It is very straight forward recipe, the only thing is it does take time. I use the pre ground ginger in the sauce and that saves a lot of time and effort. I also double the ginger. This recipe ROCKS!

Loved the slow roasted effect, but found the lacquer way too cloying

I made the glaze a couple of days in advance to save myself some time. When I tasted it, it tasted over caramelized, almost burnt to me. So, being nitpicky, I remade the glaze using plain white, granulated sugar as opposed to dark brown sugar. I thought the taste of the second glaze was much cleaner. That's the one I used and it was a big hit.

I wish I could agree with the other reviews, but this was far from the best salmon I've ever made. I had no trouble with the reduction. I used my 5-quart dutch oven which allows you to boil the ingredients rapidly without spattering it all over the stove top. I would suggest everyone try the Maple Soy-Glazed Salmon, also at this site. Now THAT is an excellent recipe!

Fantastic, but I had to cook mine for well over an hour. I had a very thick fillet of King salmon. Also, after an hour of simmering, I still had two cups of liquid. I stopped simmering and used what I had, but now I wish I had kept simmering until it was syrupy, as suggested here. Even with my lack of patience with the glaze, it was an excellent dish. Some of the best salmon I've ever made.

One of the best salmon dishes I have ever had; unquestionably the best salmon dish I've ever made myself. Followed the recipe pretty much exactly, and it was wonderful. The only thing that changed was the simmering time on the sauce - maybe I didn't simmer it aggressively enough, but after an hour and a half I still had two cups of glaze. Which was still unbelievably delicious. Deviations I tried (and liked): adding some of the (unsqueezed) grated ginger to the sauce while simmering. once glazed on the salmon, they became delicious pieces of candy ginger that worked well. Also, in the last glaze, putting a little chopped garlic on the fish was a nice addition. Both pretty low risk suggestions. They worked for me.

This receipe is exceptional. The salmon was tender and moist, and the sauce was wonderful. I made this exactly as the receipe states. My dinner guests had thirds and asked for the recipe.

I made this tonight and it came out excellent. The Sauce was everything the description said it would be. The Salmon was flakey and perfect. Next time I will pay attention to the amount of time to reduce the sauce so that dinner is on time.

I made this for our family and will make this weekend for a dinner party. Was so tender! Even the next day, the fish was delicious served straight from the refrigerator!

wow, this is a fantastic recipe! It's nice if you can prep the sauce ahead of time so that when it's time to go in the oven, it's easy. I served it with roasted potatoes, but would also be good with steamed asparagus or mashed potato. (or both). Enjoy!

What a fantastic salmon recipe.... moist, tender and very favourful.. Our dinner guests raved! I ran short of time so I baked the salmon for 25 minutes at 350F and basted it often. Makes a lot of glaze, so I will half the recipe the next time.

Brilliant!! It had opened my eyes to many possibilities with other flavoring agents and other types of fish.

This recipe (along with the bacon- wrapped salmon also from Epicurious) is one of the most delicious recipes from this website I have ever endeavored to make. The glaze took a little more time than I had available (hungry boyfriend waiting in the wings) but it didn't disappoint: because I used only a one pound salmon fillet, I ended up with extra glaze to use in future meals (I'm thinking grilled chicken, shrimp, porkchops, even grilled vegetables...) Even though it was cooked all the way through (I usually prefer medium) this salmon was the most tender and moist I have ever made. If you make the glaze ahead of time this recipe is simple and would be great for either a casual supper or an extravagant dinner party. The cooking time was about the same for my 1 pound fillet as written in the recipe; it seems the time depends more on the thickness of the fillet than its length. I hope everyone enjoys this recipe as much as I do.
