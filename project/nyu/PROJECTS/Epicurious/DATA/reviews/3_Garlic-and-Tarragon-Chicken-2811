Delicious and very simple. I crushed the garlic cloves and mixed them with the olive oil and dried tarragon (plus a goodly amount of coarsely ground black pepper and a generous squeeze of lemon juice) an hour ahead of time to let the flavors blend, and rubbed the chicken with the mixture both inside the skin and out. Then I baked the chicken with quartered new potatoes, and served it with steamed fresh green beans. Non-tarragon-lovers may want to reduce the quantity a bit or simply substitute thyme for the tarragon. I'm certain it would be even better made with fresh herbs; next time I'll try it with lemon thyme from my garden.

I didn't find it to be bland at all. In fact, the tarragon was incredibly overpowering. For a tarragon lover, this might be great. I won't be making it again.

This recipe was INCREDIBLY bland!! It needs more oomph.

I followed the recipe, and we liked it fine. It was very quick and easy, a nice variation on your standard baked chicken.

I would make the recipe again with a few changes. 1/4 cups of olive oil can be reduces and a paste made with roasted garlic and fresh tarragon and spread on the chicken. In the original recipe, I would at least make the oil garlic mixture and let sit for a few hours so the flavors could 'marry'.

my mother called and asked for a quick tarragon chicken recipe. i immediately consulted the epicurious website and found the quickest, easiest recipe i could. this is an all-around wonderful recipe! not only is it delicious, but it is also beautiful to look at. the fact that we used fresh tarragon as opposed to dried made a huge difference, i think, in both the flavor and the presentation. we had garlic mashed potatoes and my mother threw together some tarragon and parmesan butter for the bread. please make this recipe...you'll be very pleased.

Good but not a stellar recipe. The chicken was a bland other then the very strong taste of tarragon which was a little over-powering. Next time I'll make sure to reduce the amount of tarragon that I use.

My family loved this chicken. I used fresh tarragon and about doubled the amount called for. I might use less olive oil next time and would love to try it with basil. This was certainly a simple recipe, but heck I had never thought to do anything quite like it before. I was almost expecting to see some bashing in the reviews because the simplicity and was glad there was not. We need simple good meals for busy times.

i just finished eating this dish and must say that i loved it. i made sweet potato fries to go along with it and the combo was delish. i was the only one eating, though, so i halved the recipe. next time i will add more garlic and tarragon (i love both!) and take the lemon juice recommendation. i used breast strips that were marked "perfect for stir-fry" and they cooked in about 20 min. a great, quick meal for one!

This was a very easy recipe, but don't make it unless you absolutely love tarragon - very powerful. I agree a squeeze of fresh lemon juice would work well.

Very very good and very very easy. The smell of this cooking brought the neighbors over to see what I was making. Served with a potatoe medley and fresh asparagus. Absolutely wonderful presentation. Don't worry about overcooking the chicken - I left it in for quite a bit longer than recommended and it was still wonderfully moist and tender. My highest recommendation!

This was quite good and could not be any easier to prepare. Some of my garlic did get a little too browned and tasted bitter--next time I'll put all the garlic under the skin. Tarragon is probably my favorite herb and that flavor would be enhanced, I think, with a little squeeze of fresh lemon juice.

This was easy and good. I loosened up the skin on the chicken and tucked some of the garlic/tarragon mixture underneath before roasting; the breasts were moist and flavorful.
