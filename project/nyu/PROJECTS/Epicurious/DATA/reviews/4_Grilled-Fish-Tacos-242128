Easy and delish! Since some reviews stated that the marinade flavors didn't really come out in the fish, I marinated the fish for more like two hours and I was sure to finely chop the onion for the marinade. The flavors did come out delicate but it was perfect. I didn't use the salsa verde.

Rating: 4
Was not sure how this would go over with my husband, but we both loved it. Some of the reviews indicated the fish did not absorb the flavor of the marinade. Instead of using orange juice, I used 2 tablespoons vinegar and the Tilapia tasted great! Other changes: used flour tortillas heated in the oven; sauteed the rest of the onions with the marinade as a topping. Will definitely make this again!

YUM!!! I've finally convinced my Husband to try fish tacos. These came out fantastic!!! Mixed a little of marinade into the fish once flaked, didn't need salsa verde it was so flavorful. Oh yes, he ate them..cleaned his plate even.

Used the recipe for the marinade on tilapia filets. I broiled in the oven then used condiments to mimic the fish tacos from the local taqueria. OMG. Everyone absolutely raved. Delicious. Better than the ones I was replicating.

We tried this recipe on halibut. It was absolutely amazing. I do recommend letting the fish marinade for the full hour. Also, pull the fish out of the refrigerator 15 minutes prior to grilling.

This is a wonderfully fresh baja style fish taco. The flavors work wonderfully with mahi mahi which is the fish I used. Like many of the other reviewers, I, too, switched to greek yoghurt instead of mayonnaise.

Rating: 4
Yummy! The only things I did differently was to substitute greek yogurt for the mayo in the lime mayonnaise, add chili in adobe sauce to that lime mayo, and grill the onion that I didn't put in the the marinade. This is officially my favorite recipe (at the moment)!

I just made this recipe for my family for the first time. It was delicous! I marinated the fish in a vacuum sealed bag to assure that the flavors reached the fish. Follwed the recipe to the letter after that. Yes, I used mayo. My three kids and husband loved it. I froze the left over salsa verde to use later. Definite keeper.

My extended family loves the breaded+fried fish tacos I have made for years. But when I made grilled fish tacos inspired by this recipe, they said they were now spoiled for anything less. I used fresh red salsa, mixed with mayo & lime on a generous bowl of shredded cabbage & onion & cilantro. Guests had only to layer their fish & avocado & "slaw" on the tortilla; easy. When there was no cabbage, a corn-onion-cilantro-lime salsa worked well. As another reviewer commented, you can play with this. Nice fresh grilled fish + fresh juicy veggies + rich avocado on corn tortillas = good!

I make these every Sunday now! I love them and I used the suggestion to use Greek yogurt in place of the mayo.

Fabulous - great weight watching recipe. We do not like cilantro - substituted with fresh chopped mango. Also deleted mayo and substituted with non-fat Greek yogurt adding fresh lime juice. If there's any way to buy freshly made tortillas - still warm from the oven - it's an absolute must - what a difference! Enjoy!

These were great, though mostly due to the salsa verde. I agree that the fish didn't take on much (if any) of the marinade flavor, even though I marinaded it for 6 hours. I made it exactly as written, though added one chopped jalapeno to the marinade, in hopes that it would help increase the tangy spice. None of that flavor came through. Also, i used fresh grouper as that was the only fresh, wild fish available at my local fish market. In the end, the salsa verde is a MUST. We were all fighting over the last bites.

Not spicy/tangy/flavorful enough

Phenomenal! The flavors were fantastic. Prepared the recipe exactly as written with following exceptions. I used Hallibut-fantastic. I used lowfat sourcream instead of mayo in the lime crema and it was awesome. Since the recipe did not specify what type of cabbage, I used Napa, It was good. This recipe is excellent as is, but obviously, you can play around all you want and still get fabulous results. DO NOT SKIP THE SALSA VERDE!

Rating: 4
These were great! I took the advice of previous reviewers and used greek yogurt and sour cream instead of mayo with no milk (added some chipotle paste to the lime crema) and cut back on the cilantro. Chopped mango was a great additional topping. I would have just used the avocado, but my husband insisted on making a full guacamole instead. We bought the salsa verde. Red cabbage adds great colour. I used cod as the fish - delicious! Much better than the fried fish tacos I've made in the past.

Rating: 4
Wow! I've made lots of fish tacos but this is by FAR the best ever! And really easy! I was feeding a friend who is allergic to garlic so I left that out, but otherwise followed the marinade recipe, using tilapia. Also used 1/2 cup fat-free Greek yogurt with 1/4 cup regular mayonnaise and lime juice. Definitely make the grilled corn tortillas too! Didn't have time or any tomatillos for Salsa Verde. Will definitely make that next time.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times for my friends and family. Always a hit. I've used halibut, tilapia, sole, and tuna steaks. Recently, I cut out the cilantro and replaced it with fresh mango and red cabbage instead of green. This was an immediate hit. My husband doesn't care for cilantro, and it seemed to mellow out the flavor while giving it pop and additional color.

Rating: 4
I always thought that fish tacos were too labor intensive to make at home, but this recipe was well worth it. Tips that made it worth it for me: I used the fish I had one hand - salmon, and it was great. I made the sauce from sour cream, not mayo, and it turned out great. I found a small cabbage so I knew I would not be wasting the rest of the cabbage which I was not likely to eat. Perfect! I also baked the salmon in the marinade and it was delicious!

Rating: 4
Have made these several times and always a hit. I typically use Mahi Mahi, but have used Tilapia a time or two. I add some chopped jalapeno to the marinade for a little more kick. Use store bought salsa and instead of the mayo mix (which I didn't care for), I use sour cream with lime juice, green onion, cilantro and a little milk to thin it out. Even non-fish lovers will love these!

Rating: 4
Accidentally used all the onions and cilantro in the marinade instead of reserving some as topping, which worked out as just cooked them on the iron pan which gave off a nice perfume of lime and brought out the flavor even more, used the cooked marinade as the topping. So added additional fresh cilantro for topping as well for freshness. Didn't make the salsa either. As to the mayo sauce used 1 spoon of cream and halved the mayo as ran out - it was good although the lime was very strong, could've halved the lime too. Can maybe halve the cabbage - but had leftover sauce and cabbage which mixed together made a tasty slaw. Also this goes well over rice vs. as a taco. Did a taste test on grilling tortillas vs. cooking on iron pan, results very similar however preferred the iron pan ones - the grilled ones had lots of black smudges from the smoke looked moldy but the pan was perfect. Lightly brushed each side of the tortillas with peanut oil and lightly salted before cooking.

Great recipe which received rave reviews from my guests. I'm a Californian living in the UK, and no one had even heard of soft tacos before, let alone FISH tacos. Everyone wanted the recipe. Tilapia can only be found frozen so I used red mullet, which was delicious. Made the salsa verde too (great!) and the homemade corn tortilla recipe also to be found on epicurious as you can't find store bought versions over here. I know I'll be making this many many times in the future.

We liked this recipe a lot. A few changes suited our tastes. I used tilapia. The marinade was great. Used the bbq. I agree with others that the extra chopped onion as garnish is too much. Also used sour cream instead of mayo. I didn't care for the cabbage as a topping. Next time I plan to use iceberg lettuce cups as "tortillas" and make this light and fresh recipe more carb friendly. That being said, it was really a nice light and flavourful meal.

Rating: 4
Great summer recipe, and really easy to throw together. I'm a bit of a cheat because I usually just use store bought salsa verde. At some point I will make it homemade. All the condiments (cilantro, cabbage, lime and avocado) make for a really pretty presentation if you're entertaining.

Rating: 3
The salsa verde is excellent - very easy and really made the dish. The lime mayo was not as good -- it should be a sour cream or yorgurt base, not mayo. Also, I recommend a sea bass or halibut... tilapia is too fishy tasting, but that's just my preference.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe and have made it several times. I have never managed to marinate the tilapia for more than the time it takes to get the condiments ready (cabbage, avocado, cilantro, mayo sauce), but no matter, it's always flavorful. Two slight modifications: 1) I buy an excellent fresh tomatillo salsa instead of making the salsa verde. 2) I use only 1 cup of white onion (don't reserve any for raw). Instead, I remove the fish from the pan and hold it warm for a minute while I quickly cook up the onion/juice/garlic/cilantro marinade mixture as an additional condiment--no waste and no raw onion breath.

Rating: 4
I "tweeked" this recipe slightly. I used the suggested marinade for the tilapia and it was terrific. To the mayonnaise I added Thai sweet chili sauce and spread that over the tortilla. I topped that with the grilled fish, drained oil/vinegar cole slaw, grated carrots and avocado slices. After rolling up the tortillas, I grilled them until they were crispy. A huge hit all around!

Lousy made with tilapia, which is too "soft" and flavorless a fish. Might try it again with something more stout such as sword or tuna. Recipe could also benefit from adding some kick (which I'll add if I make this again) from, say, cayenne or chili powder.

This was the best fish taco ever! I will be making this again and again. The salsa verde was wonderful, I used honey instead of sugar. I did use greek yogart instead of the mayo, the tartness was a perfect balance. I also chopped up some tomatoes they added just the right amount of sweet. It looked beautiful with the greens and reds, very fresh.

used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 greek yogurt for a lower fat sauce - plus to use mayo would make it taste eggy/oily :( Otherwise, fantastic! Added cayenne for some kick to the marinade and the cream mixture. enjoy :)

I stumbled across this recipe while I was looking for something to make with mahi mahi using ingredients I had in the house and boy am I glad I did. This was outstanding. For the most part, I followed the recipe as written, but did not make the salsa verde, cooked the fish in a nonstick pan and made only a quarter of the lime mayo. Flavorful, delicious and healthy. Looking forward to trying this again with the salsa verde.

Made this for dinner tonight, but used whole tilapia instead because that's what I had. Also used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, which made a refreshingly tangy condiment. After taking his first bite, my 10 year old son asked me to start gathering all my recipes, especially this one, so he can "eat this good" when he moves out for college. I think that makes this dish a winner!

Outstanding recipe. I made 3 pounds fish for 7 and it was completely eaten up. The salsa verde recipe was more time-consuming than others that I have made in the past and I am not sure it was worth the extra efforts, although it was good. I didn't put milk in the mayo but did add zest of a lime.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! I used almost 3 lbs tilapia for six people and they couldn't get enough. Followed the suggestion of marinating the fish in zip locks and it worked like a charm. My only mistake was doubling the recipe for the lime mayonnaise - had a ton left over, as a little goes a long way.

Absolutely the best fish recipe I've ever tried! Since, by background and inclination I'm more influenced by Mexican food than this recipe is, I changed a few things. Instead of the mayo/milk combo, I used Mexican Crema with the lime juice. I also added about 1/2 t. chile powder to the crema mixture and to the marinade. I also used my own Salsa Verde recipe (1 lb. tomatillos, 1 bunch cilantro, 1 t. salt 1 t. sugar, juice of 1 lime, NM green chile to taste, all pulsed together in a food processor) instead of the one provided. Everything else I kept the same, and everyone who's tried it raves!

I thought this was good, but not spectacular. The flavor of the fish was mild -- the first taste was good, but then the flavor of the fish was lost among the other taco ingredients. Though mildness isn't all bad -- my 4 and 1-year-olds ate it up. For the marinade, next time I would slice the onions instead of chopping them -- my husband doesn't like the texture of onions, so I had to brush them off the fish before grilling. Would probably marinate longer than one hour. I used tilapia, and would use a grill or fish basket next time, as the fish stuck the grill, even after I oiled the grates. A foil package, as suggested by another reviewer, could also work well. I used half mayo and half sour cream as suggested by other reviewers, but I thought the sc made it a bit too tart, so I would use only mayo and only make half as much. I used jarred tomatillo salsa. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and sauteed the marinade, making a sort of onion relish, and this was the one standout of the recipe for me! It had all the flavor that I had expected in the fish, and it added a little punch to the tacos. If I make this again, will definitely do that again, maybe even make a separate batch of marinade and add corn to make an onion-corn relish.

Rating: 4
This is my go to recipe for fish (mahi, grouper, or snapper are excellent if you have the option) when we have company, it's always well received. The recipe is very forgiving, I never measure anything. We usually wrap everything in foil and put the packets on the grill (or oven) for about 10 minutes. The juices sort of poach the fish, and then you have the wonderful onion mixture to spoon over top of your tacos. The salsa can be skipped, but I highly recommend the lime mayo. It's really simple, but surprisingly good, and most people ask for that recipe before anything else.

Preferred this recipe to the fish tacos I had during recent trip to San Diego -although these flavors come off more Greek/Mediterranean than Mexican to me. The mayo dressing should not be skipped - pulls ingredients together. I used tilapia. Will try again, perhaps with pita instead of tortilla.

Rating: 4
I've made these several times now and I think they're about the best fish tacos I've ever had. Even my husband loves them! I use tilapia which has the perfect texture and flavor. I didn't change anything; the fish really does only need to marinate for an hour as described and on med-high grill, it takes me about 3-4 minutes per side for perfection. I made my own tomatillo salsa verde, which was good, but to tell you the truth, these are so delicious, they don't need much of anything other than the mayo-lime sauce and a little cabbage. The fish would be great served even without anything else on it though. The smell from the grill while it's cooking makes your place smell like a great restaurant too! Served with a raw corn and radish salad with spicy lime dressing....healthy and delicious!

Great, lite and fun meal, great idea for a bbq. I marinated the fish for a couple of hours, no turning, just in a zip-lock. Super tasty, and moist grilled per directions. used a bit more lime in the marinade, and used 50/50 mayo/sourcream for the sauce, shredded lettuce instead of cabbage.

Made these tacos last night for 15 people, everyone loved them (including me). I made my own tomatillo salsa and ommitted the mayo sauce, otherwise stuck to the recipe. I will make these again, tasty, easy and healthy. My only question is how they taste on their own without salsa, cabbage....?

We served with the Quinoa with Black Beans and Cilantro and the Avocado and Tropical-Fruit Salsa found on this site. All delicious!

I bought tilapia for the first time and was looking for a recipe for it. I made just the fish, following the directions through to grilling the fish. I served with some broccoli and both my husband and I loved the fish. No need for us to add mayo, milk, tortillas, etc. Fish was sweet (oj?) but had a very nice taste from the other ingredients as well.

Wonderful flavors. Noone mentioned the length of prep time. I was chopping, slicing and dicing for a long time, but it was well worth the effort since I have made it twice.

Probably better grilled but noone had any complaints and it was ALL gone.

I followed the recipe exactly, although I halved the majo (thanks for the tip). Wonderful flavors and I can't say enough about the salsa verde. (Frontera Grill's tomatillo salsa would be an acceptable substutute in a pinch.)

There is a lot of bother inherent in all the prep, but worth it.

I have a ton of steak left over and zero fish.

The combination of ingredients for this dish are so good that most variations work wonderfully. You can bake, broil, grill, or pan fry the fish with the marinade and it will all be wonderful - we especially loved the tartness of the lime.

I made this last night with redfish and my wife was still talking about it at breakfast. The recipe looked very interesting to start with, but looking for opportunities to cut corners, without compromising the recipe I considered other user comments and made a few changes also. Saving on refrigerator space and clean up, I marinated the fish in a ziploc bag; added the cilantro to the mayonnaise to give it visual appeal; used flour tortillas; and opted for prepared Salsa Verde. The tacos go very well with jalapeno rice. The elements of this dish all came together for a tasty experience. I'll be making this again - very soon!

I was skeptical about this recipe, but I'm happy to say that it was awesome. I agree that the fish (I used tilapia) benefits from a dip in marinade beforehand--I used lime juice with cumin, chili powder, cilantro, and garlic--and be very careful not to overgrill the light, flaky fish. I used fat free sour cream instead of the mayo and flour tortillas instead of corn. I mixed up a batch of my fab mango salsa to accompany, and voila--clean, fresh flavors perfect for a summer evening!

The picture was so tantalizing; I had to make this recipe. I have made it twice. The first time I made it exactly as printed. I live in area where fresh fish isn't available and had to use frozen, but it was delightful. The marinade is delicious and the salsa verde is fantastic and if you cook quite often, this recipe won't seem like too much work at all. I appreciated making my own sauce as I am sensitive to food additives and therefore had no potential health risks to worry about as I would with a jarred salsa verde. It does make a lot, but we used it on various things throughout the week. The second time I made this recipe was for my father on Father's Day. He was impressed and even people who don't typically eat fish loved this dish. My brother obtained fresh fish from where he lives and the fishmonger strongly encouraged us to use mahi mahi and it was great, but whatever fish you like-I don't think you can go wrong! I didn't use the lime mayo the second time because it was a large amount and didn't offer the recipe anything that the marinade and sauce didn't provide. Some people in my family are die-hard sour cream and cheese fans and added that and it was nice, however, not necessary! Enjoy this recipe, it is soooooo worth it! We all loved it!

I have been trying and eating different fish tacos since I first tasted one in San Diego during the early 90's. These are the best fish tacos I have ever eaten! I made the recipe exactly as it appears using fresh farmed Tilapia from the local fishmonger. It also helps to use locally sourced tortillas (i.e. not a national brand). My friends will be impressed.

This dish was good but way overdone and time consuming to make. The marinade is so delicious by itself that the salsa verde and lime mayo are overkill. Lime mayonnaise is great on batter fried fish because the fish is rather bland but in this recipe the fish is very far from being bland. The salsa verde was good but.....sugar? I added it because I wanted to give the recipe an honest try, but I think it would've been much better without it. The salsa was very time consuming to make too. To make a long story short, the salsa and lime mayo are not necessary for this dish and make a lot more work for the cook. While the fish was grilling, I sauteed the leftover marinade in a saucepan and poured it over the fish on the platter. Simply delicious.

Rating: 3
This was really yummy. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I used orange roughy because it was the best bet at my store, a bottled salsa verde instead of the homemade one, and I used half (light) sour cream for the mayo sauce. The sauce, I think, benefitted from that. I would also recommend using even more lime in it. My grill is a mess now, but it was worth it. Next time (and there willl be a next time) I make it, I'll probably use a hotter grill to get more charring on the fish, because that's where the best flavor was, and just cut down a bit on the cooking time. Well worth the effort.

This is a really good recipe. I have made it twice now, once with chilean sea bass and once with tilapia. I thought the sea bass was much more rich and stood up to the powerful salsa verde better. The recipe makes tons of salsa verde! I did not pull out the seeds from the jalepeno (i used 3) and it was really hot salsa the first day. It certainly mellowed out after a few days though. A serious keeper...my husband was very afraid of the concept of fish tacos but now he is requesting them on his own! Enjoy!

YUMM!! Even my 5 and 8 year old kids enjoyed these tacos. I couldn't be bothered to light the grill so I baked the fillets in the marinade at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, until the fish flaked. The fish was moist and very tasty. I also added 1 diced chipotle pepper to the mayonnaise sauce for an extra kick.

These tacos were exceptionally good. My husband couldn't stop raving. I know the salsa verde seems like a pain to make, but it really made the meal special. I will definitely make it again!

I enjoy a good fish taco, and these were terrific. The marinade was excellent. I left as much marinade on the fish as I could when I put them on the grill. I added a bit of chopped garlic to the mayo sauce. The flavors were fresh. The fish was moist and flavorful. The tilapia was very good. However, I imagine that a variety of fish would also be good choices. This was a lean over your plate meal. Lots of juices leaking from my over-stuffed tortillas.

Oh my god! Had these last night for dinner and they were so good and super easy. We like our food on the spicy side so I added some Jalapeno peppers to the onion mixture. When it came time to cook the fish I couldn't bear to throw the marinade out so I sautéed the mixture and used that instead of the extra raw onions. Will certainly be making this again!

The entire family loved these. Used flour tortillas instead of corn, guacamole instead of avocado, skipped the salsa. Excellent!

We loved these - the sauce is great. Have also tried changing it up a bit, from the fish to the salsa - and all have been equally delicious!

My husband and I loved this recipe. Didn't bother making the salsa, just bought some tasty fresh from the store (there are so many good prepared salsas available these days). Otherwise didn't (and wouldn't) change a thing.
