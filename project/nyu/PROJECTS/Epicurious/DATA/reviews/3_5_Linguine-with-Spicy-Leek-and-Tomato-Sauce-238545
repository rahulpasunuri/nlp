Served over quinoa cakes from another recipe on the site. Very good, especially reheated the next day. I omitted the wine and vinegar and seasoned to taste with a pinch of sugar. I gave it 3 because of it's texture, its chunky and watery at the same time. Next time I'll put some tomato puree to thicken it a little.

Always looking for more neat stuff to do with leeks, I was excited to try this. Made as directed, but was underwhelmed. Some combination of onion and/or garlic with tomato/fennel/hot pepper is just SO much better!!

This recipe is nice for a change from our regular marinara sauce. It's easy to put together although there is quite a bit of chopping. We follow the directions exactly and have always been pleased with the results. It's yummy :)

This dish was tasty and easy to throw together. The flavor from the fennel seeds was a little overpowering, and I would add less next time. Shrimp was a good addition.

This was quick but just mediocre. I didn't like the addition of the vinegar - the tomatoes are fairly acidic anyway, and I thought it was just too acidic and not sweet enough. The combination of the fennel seeds and the red pepper was interesting but I didn't love it.

Added a little extra garlic to this and some onions. This recipe was extremely fast, easy and was full of flavor. I will definitely make it again and again.

I make this all the time. It's a big hit and I'm often asked to share the recipe. I do add some spicy sausage to the dish to round out the flavors (plus my husband wants meat!) I highly recommend this dish.

I have made this so many times! This was an immediate hit at our table. Very easy to make and it seems like you went to more trouble than you did. Make it vegan by omitting the parmesan cheese; sprinkle a little nutritional yeast on instead.

This dish was okay. I think you need to increase the garlic and possibly add a protein of some sort - this from a vegetarian! I think shrimp or a smoked fish would round out the flavors. PS - I left out the fennel since I'm allergic; could be why I found it lacking.

This recipe was very simple and versatile yet packed with flavor. I used rosemary linguine and homegrown cherry tomatoes - it a huge hit.

1 fork is way more than I want to give this. Absolutely disgusting, and I followed the recipe exactly. Bland yet hot, nothing interseting about it.

This was easy and delicious although I did double the dried red pepper for extra kick. Served it with the Grilled Jumbo Shrimp with Lemon and Oregano from Gourmet, June 2006 and an arugula and endive sald and it was a winner dinner.

This was really good! Fast, easy, and very flavorful. My spouse, who usually insists on meat of some sort with his pasta, ate this like it was going out of style. Spicy sausage would be a nice addition, though. Also, make sure you have super quality tomatoes - makes a huge difference. My home-grown beefsteaks were a superb substitute for the romas. I wouldn't change a thing.

This was so delicious. For my non veg friends, I grilled up some spicy fennel sausage. Will make it again.

This meal was just so so, nothing special. I added clams and artichoke hearts as others recommended, but probably wont make it again.

This was super quick and delicious! I used 1 28oz can of diced tomatoes, with juices, and added a can of artichoke hearts (chopped). Pine nuts would be a nice garnish, along with the Parmesan.

Excellent recipe with a good amount of spice. The leeks provide a nice crunch. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe just didn't do anything for me. All ingredients that I enjoy and use often but felt there was something lacking/missing here.

I made this with canned, petite diced tomatoes and added one small, fresh tomato - worked great! A keeper for sure.

I've made this several times and it always turns out beautifully, although I do double the amount of crushed red pepper.

This was a great recipe. Fast and flavorful, and nice to have a pasta dish without the heavy tomato sauce, for the summer weather. I used spaghettini (thin spaghetti) to make it lighter overall. It does require a generous amount of parmesan, salt and pepper just before serving, but it was soooo good! We thought it would be great with the addition of either clams or Italian sausage too.

very, very tasty! great summer pasta, light, spicy, and the sweet fennel seeds - very good.

The main amount of time with this dish is the chopping part. But it is great once you get the prep part done. Very tasty. I used whole wheat linguine and added a little extra red pepper to spice it up a little. Great as a left over too. Will try some variations with clams or Italian sausage. As is, a good recipe when vegetarians come for dinner.

Excellent dinner. We added grilled chicken and made it our main course. It was our Anniversary meal and we'll definitely move it up to company worthy status.

I made this for a get together with my friends and it was a huge hit. I used the leftovers for dinner the next night. I added scallops and just a little more wine & cheese. So good, I know I'll make again!
