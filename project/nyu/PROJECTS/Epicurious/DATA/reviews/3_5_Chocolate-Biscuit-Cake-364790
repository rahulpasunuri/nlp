I made this for our wedding watch party. It was pretty tasty. Especially good cold, that ganache hardens up and helps with those dry cookies!

Made this cake two days ago and turned out delicious. Mind you, I changed a few things & I disolved the chocolate in 1/2 cup boiling milk in order to get a softer cream mixture and avoid the "hard as a rock" result. Used Petit Beurre instead of McVities as I had them in the cupboard, and added chopped pecans for texture. I inter layered the cake with a chocolate ganache made with double cream, syrup, butter and Cointreau and used the leftovers to cover the cake. It was yummy and moist and very easy to slice.

I made the recipe both with the mistake (4 tbsp butter) and with the correction (8 tbsp butter). They tasted about the same but the 8 tbsp butter version was softer and therefore easier to eat. The second time I made it, I changed the glaze to a simple ganache (chocolate + cream + corn syrup) rather than the straight melted chocolate. Because the ganache was soft, it was easier to cut. For those who are worried about the raw egg: I used 1/4 cup Egg Beaters instead of the egg and it was perfect. You do not have to worry about bacteria when you use egg substitutes.

break the biscuits into almond sized pieces.....the smaller the pieces, the more likely it is that the cake will be hard as a rock. (as Cook from Exeter, PA discovered)

good catch nykatie. You're right, someone messed up when translating amounts for US readers. This isn't uncommon, though. YOu can find the real recipe if you google it.

I think something got lost in translation with this recipe.This recipe (same chef) was printed in a British newspaper. However, it called for 4oz of butter in the recipe and 4 oz of sugar, everything else the same. British recipes are based on weight,not volume. 4oz of butter is not 4 tablespoons/or half a stick- it's equivalent to a whole stick in the US. Perhaps that is why some aren't turning out well. 4oz weight of sugar is roughly 1/2 cup of sugar, so that doesn't affect the recipe. Try 4oz of butter and it will work a treat! Also, if you can't get McVities rich tea biscuits, they are similar in taste and texture to a not too sweet animal cracker.

OMG, used to eat this all the time as a kid, except we called it Chocolate Slice or Chocolate Biscuit Slice. It was a fixture at birthday parties!! It is yummy, but kind of an odd choice for a wedding cake... Are they having jelly and cream, too? And tea sandwiches with hundreds and thousands? And fairy cakes?

Made this Saturday night and it was fabulous! I had an 8" spring form pan, so I doubled the recipe, using McVitie's Chocolate covered Digestives and 70% dark chocolate, it was perfect, making it again on Friday to celebrate the wedding!

NY Times had similar story w/similar recipe, although it did not call for any eggs. (Recipe called for McVitie's, cream, honey, butter, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla - glazed with butter/cream/choc ganache). I made it as a joke and it was actually quite good...used Valrhona 70% & 72%. Will try this version for comparison. If raw egg is a concern, pasteurized eggs are available. Also, wouldn't Lyle's be more appropriate ( versus corn syrup)?

Sorry to post multiple times.... I used McVitie's Digestives in the recipe not the Rich Tea biscuits.

One more thing... I did this cake 24 hours in advance to allow it to set. Before I served it, I took it out of the fridge about 1-2 hours before serving time to make it easier to cut (and I used a serrated knife to cut it).

I did this cake this past weekend for an Easter gathering as a dry run. It was a hit!!! Just make sure to tell your guests that there is raw egg in here just in case there are allergies, etc. I am making it again for my Royal Wedding viewing party this weekend. Thanks Chef McGrady for sharing this recipe as McVitie's wasn't going to give out the recipe (I checked).

CORRIGENDUM: Bulgarian, not Romanian.

Well, the so-called Brit is wrong. McVities' Rich Tea biscuits, not digestives, are preferred. These are not a 'base' in this recipe, but rather an integral chunky element, something like a nut. This silly so-called Brit is correct in saying that neither are short bread. So let's give her credit for something beyond the Romanian, shall we?

I have not made this yet, but as a Brit, I can tell you that the biscuits used are more likely McVities Digestives, (that's the standard base in the UK for desserts) not Rich Tea, and neither are like short bread...

I am from the Chicago area and found the McVities biscuits at Cost Plus World Market. They are a little more than $3 per package, but you will only need one package for this recipe. I have not made it yet, but am going to try it out for my "Royal Wedding" party.

With these changes the cake is now 4- fork! 1. Eliminate the egg. 2. Substitute 1.5 cups corn syrup for the sugar. Works like a dream!

The raw egg worried me somewhat -- no baking takes place to cook it. The "cake" itself is not much of a cake -- it is simply cookie bits congealed in hardened chocolate (plus the raw egg mentioned above and some sugar and butter -- not sure of their purpose?). I liked the idea, but hope the "real" royal recipe has some ingredient or technique that was missing here.

I've made this twice. Each time it turned out very hard and almost impossible to cut. The first time I made it just as the recipe states. The second time, I cut the biscuits into smaller pieces, added some cream to the chocolate filling and doubled the amount of filling and it was still too hard, and it cracked when cut. Also, the sugar is not dissolving. I will try again with more butter as it is really delicious but like SofieP I think the recipe could be clearer.

LOL, ordering biscuits from another continent: total win. I was told McVities are shortbread cookies, it's easier to make them ;)

Very yummy, this type of dessert is a favorite throughout Bulgaria, but around here we usually make the chocolate mixture with cocoa. For this recipe - using melted chocolate makes it richer and tastier, but next time I'm going to double the chocolate cream for the same amount of biscuits - they were hardly covered with the amount stated here. Also, I used the "plain biscuits" we have around here, as that's the type we usually use for that dessert (think of a denser petit beurre). I can't have a way of knowing what "McVities rich tea biscuits" are and what would be a proper substitute. I will definitely make this again, but I'm giving it 3 instead of 4 forks because of the insufficient amount of the chocolate cream and the unhelpful description of the biscuits.
