Terrific flavors with the clams! I used fresh tomatoes instead of crushed, and a sauvignon blanc wine. I also tossed in some sauteed shrimp as an extra. I didn't think the peppers made much of a difference. Have a toasty baguette or grilled bread for that broth, it's delicious!

Easy and delicious! Better than I thought it would be. My nine year old want's to know when I'll make it again.

I too, like a previous reviewer, add chourico 1 - 2 lbs cut in rounds and browned the added with all the drippings. I double the garlic. I also add a good pinch of saffron. Great dish

I served this for men who did construction work at our home. They all loved it! I had to cook the onions & peppers down a little longer then recommended and next time I'll use a little less hot sauce, but they all demended more bread to sop up the sauce and unanimously declared this one a winner

Pretty good. Used regular onions but substituted Mirin Japanese sweet cooking wine for white wine to compensate for sweetness. Worked great.

An EASY, tasty, LOW FAT, dish with a fabulous presentation. We used "Maine" littlenecks (they look like a cross between a Manila clam and a small quahog) and they "pop" open dramatically when they are done. At 4.99 for a 2 lb bag, it was a pretty affordable meal for two. I used some crumbled bacon instead of the portugese sausage the commenter from Cape Cod suggested. I agree it adds something, but I wish I had some nice Iberian sausage to use! Don't bother with the sweet onions- They taste sweeter when they are raw, but they don't have more sugar than regular onions, they just have less of the pungent chemicals that give onions their sharp taste. Those chemicals break down when you cook them anyway, so save your money and your videlias for your salads and burger toppings, where they make a difference.

I've had this dish at Antonio's many times...the best of all the Spanish clam dishes in this area. When I make it, I add chunks of linguica or chorico (Portugese Sausage).
