Sounded promising, but needs something. So so and not worth making again.

Takes a little longer than recipe states. If you undercook they are a oily mess. Once they get nice and golden they are delicious!

Try adding a little cornmeal!!! I make a similar recipe with parmesan cheese, 1TBS cornmeal to 6oz cheese. They come out fantastic and crispy. Also harder grating cheeses may be less oily than gruyere.

This recipe didn't work out very well for me. I ended up with an unattractive, gloopy, oily mess. Maybe my error was baking in Corningware? Perhaps adding flour as some viewers suggested might help but all I ended up with was melted, oily cheese.

These are great. I tossed the cheese, nuts and a bit of flour together before dropping on the baking sheet. I know this sounds like overkill given how salty cheese can be, these were better with a light sprinkling of kosher salt before baking. Watch closely but let them cook to a deep brown, several minutes more than the recipe. Yes, they were oily, but I let them cool on paper towels and they were fine, this is not a low fat recipe after all. I have made them in advance and kept them sealed for a couple of days before serving.

Delicious combo of flavors. First batch was oily so I coated the cheese with flour before making the next batch of mounds. Time will vary depending on oven for sure - baked for 6-7 minutes and probably could have baked a few minutes longer for a more golden crisp. Baked on Silpat so they slid right off (Could that be why they were oily, though?? Parchment may absorb better so I'll try that next time).

This is the perfect little recipe for serving with a bold red wine. The wafers have an intensity that would balance perfectly with a special red. Plus, they make a beautiful little presentation. Be sure to use a nice quality gruyere!

These are very tasty and got rave reviews. I baked for about 8-10 min on parchment paper and they were very easy to make. It was also nice that they could be made the day before. I would definitely make them again.

Really liked this recipe. Did have to bake for about 8 min. I did not have fresh rosemary, but used fresh-frozen tarragon, and it was delicious.

Although these were very easy to make they lacked depth. We tried adding garlic, salt, pepper and other herbs but they still failed to excite. We baked them on parchment paper and they came right off the sheet.

These are really tasty, but STICK to the baking sheet. I will definitely be making them again, but next time I will use a silicone baking sheet for ease of removal.

The wafers passed with flying colors. They also freeze well if you can refrain from eating them all. I did have to bake them about 7-8 minutes.
