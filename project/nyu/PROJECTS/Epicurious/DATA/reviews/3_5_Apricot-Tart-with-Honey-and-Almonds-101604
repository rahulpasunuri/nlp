Super recipe even after all these years. Served it today to friends with whom I am traveling to France, and they loved it. The crust is very rich,almost like a cookie, but it sure tasted good.

This is definitely a keeper. True, it's time-consuming, but well worth it! Agree with the previous review - crust gets brown very quickly, it was ready after 10 minutes! The second time I made this tart I didn't grind almonds finely and added some marzipan to the custard - delicious!!!

This tart looked as beautiful as it does in the picture. I loved the taste of the almond and apricots together. This tart takes quite a while to prepare so be sure to set aside 1-1.5 hours. Also, the crust browns VERY quickly. I wouldn't suggest more than 5-10 minutes in the baking of the crust.

This was one of the best dessert recipes i have found on this site that isn't of the obvious sort (where it's super easy to improvise) and i was thoroughly impressed. the tart was beautiful with the golden custard and bright apricots all showing, and the vanilla seeds creating a lovely custard. It's mad rich, so just to lessen that a tad, i substituted 1/4 cup of the butter in the pastry with applesauce, and it was fine, so the quantity could probably be further diminished no problem. The finished product totally reminded me of the phenominl patisserie down my sttreet in Paris.

This tart is ample and worked well for a dinner party. I did not have a vanilla bean and used extract instead, which worked out just fine. I also had no orange peel for the crust, but that didn't seem to matter either. I did find the crust was difficult to work with; very sticky despite being cold. Be careful...that buttery crust browns quickly!

Everyone loved this. Even my friends who aren't apricot lovers. All the flavors blend well.

Excellent! This tart was one of three desserts I made for a party I gave. The general consensus was that this was the best of the three--people raved about the pastry cream! They liked the texture the ground nuts gave it. Have already had several requests to share the recipe!

This was very nice! I made it for 4th of July and everyone loved it. I used fresh peaches instead, since I had them in the house and it was fantastic! I can't wait to try it with the Apricots, that sounds good too.

The almonds in the custard give this tart an unexpected texture and the apricots complete a very spring-like picture.

Apricot lovers will enjoy this. It has a nice blend of flavors and consistencies.
