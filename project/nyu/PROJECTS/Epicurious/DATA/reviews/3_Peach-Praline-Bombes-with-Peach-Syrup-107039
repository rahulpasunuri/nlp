Didnt have time to make the ice cream, so bought good peach ice cream(besides, no peaches this time of year). Reduced Mango and Peach nectars to make sauce. I agree, this made a beautiful presentation, but was a major pain in the a----to assemble, disassemble, and plate up. Like the idea-hate the act.

I have made it five times since it appeared in the magazine. (I make several, freeze for later.) Three times I used an expensive mango ice cream instead of making the peach from scratch; I went through all of the other processes. It's delicious, it's tabletop theatre!!! It's not just the food, it's the "fizz", you know.

This recipe works and the end product looks and tastes great BUT it is very fiddlely. I would like to meet the person who can spend only two hours actively making it. I seemed to spend most on one day in the kitchen making it.
