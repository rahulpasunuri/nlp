This is quite similar to another favorite recipe found on this site -Cornmeal Crusted Chicken with Toasted Corn Salsa. I followed the recipe pretty closely with just a couple of adjustments. Used frozen corn and toasted it as described in the aforementioned favorite recipe. I also added a bit of cayenne to the cornmeal mixture just to spice things up a bit more. Served with basmati rice. Hubby and I both enjoyed this very much and will definitely have it again.

I make this recipe all the time and receive compliments each time I make it. I add extra chili oil to really spice it up but other than that do not deviate from the recipe. It's really good and super easy.

Used all fresh ingredients and the cornmeal coating on the chicken was a nice change of pace. It added some texture and went well with the sweet salsa. I added a little extra spice to the salsa and it worked pretty well. I will make this again.

The salsa was delicious and we have made it multiple times. The chicken is healthy, and tastes okay, but isn't the greatest I've had. Like a previous reviewer, we used Dole frozen mango, which worked very well.

The chicken was ok, good but nothing special, however, the mango salsa was delicious. I really liked it and was tempted to try it as a dip for tortilla chips, but sadly none was leftover. I would make the salsa again, but change the chicken or use a different chicken recipe. I thought the coating would be good, since I love cornmeal and coriander, but it was bland. Maybe I can jazz it up next time.

This is one of my favorite recipes, very tasty. If you're serving kids omit the chili oil.

Liked it, but nothing standout about the chicken. The mango "salsa" was pretty good and I would definitely make it again. The chicken, maybe, but more likely a different chicken preparation with the same salsa. Also made the three pepper slaw. Though I love jicama, and it was a nice compliment, I don't think I would make that again. Followed the recipe except coated both sides of the chicken. It was a good change for chicken but it doesn't go down as a favorite.

the chicken itself was a little blah, but the salsa had great flavor and texture

This dish was incredible. It reminded me that you don't have to cook a meat condiment for it to be incredibly complex and delicious. I dredged both sides of the chicken in cornmeal and pan fried them in just a touch of canola oil--putting cornmeal on one side seemed silly to me. Prep time is a little intensive, but it cooks quickly.

My whole family loved this recipe, even my five-year-old daughter. I added a little cayenne as others had recommended and used frozen corn (by necessity) and it was delicious. I'm making it again only one week later.

I didn't think it was boring at all. The salsa was great, and the chicken was nice and crispy. I gage my meals on whether my boyfriend responds to it, and he could not stop saying how good it was. It's tough to please him with chicken, too.

Boring chicken, good salsa. Would maybe stuff the chicken with goat cheese next time.

Very flavorfull and refreshing. Added a bit of cayenne and hot pepper flakes to the cornmeal mixture to give it some kick. I would make this again, but perhaps use different fruits in the salsa.

It is a party favorite- plus it is the only low fat- but still delicious dish I know of. I add extra salsa to it- and it is just as wonderful with shrimp.

Loved the cornmeal crust but added salt, pepper and cumin to it. It crisped up nicely. Also added some jalapeno pepper to the black bean mango salsa. Since I didn't have any mangoes in the house I used peaches instead and it was lovely. Everyone liked it including my 4 year old and my 18 month old.

My husband & I thought this dish was "just OK". We really liked the salsa but thought the coating might be better on fish? Probably won't make this again.

Didn't make chicken but am reviewing the salsa.......whole family raved about it. Easy and delicious. I always wonder about folks that rate recipes but have changed the basic recipe around....however, I am about to do the same.....I added a little cayenne pepper. Even better the next day.

The mango salsa is awesome, the chicken is nice--nothing special, but you don't want it to detract from the salsa anyway. Made this dish several times. The salsa is so delicious I use it less like a condiment and more like a salad/side. If you don't want to mess with a pan indoors, just sprinkle the chicken lightly with seasoning salt and throw it on the grill for 5-6 minutes a side. All our friends loved it. Definitely a keeper!

I can only review the salsa; we didn't make the chicken part. It's a great list of ingredients for a side dish, but I think it's a bit much. It was hard to appreciate the separate parts, with it all combined. We liked it, but were not crazy about it.

Rating: 3
Very good. Chicken does need a little more seasoning, but crisps up nice. I made a great salad by mixing left over salsa with shreded left over chicken, cooked pasta spirals and a little olive oil and vinegar. Love being able to use leftovers!

The chicken was really good. However, the mango salsa was too sweet and confused our tastebuds. Not worth all the work.

Made this last night for dinner. It was really, really good! I only made a couple of adjustments: I added a little cayanne pepper and thyme to the cornmeal/coreander crust. I also rubbed the chicken with minced ginger, salt and pepper and let it sit for an hour in the fridge before cooking. This dish will certainly be making repeat appearances at my table!

Simply lovely. Light and tasty!

Made this tonight, and was very pleased with the results. The mango salsa is awesome. The mango I used was really ripe, and I think that is what made it taste especially good. Chicken was a good complement to the salsa as well. I will definately make this again.

This recipe is great for the salsa alone. I agree with the reviewer who substituted frozen corn and frozen mango (Trader Joe's sells this in chunk form, in bags) which really saves time. This salsa is great over grilled fish, too.

This was absolutley delicious! My husband said it was a "5 star" dinner! I loved the way the Black Bean Mango Salsa complimented the crusty chicken, but my husband said even if I don't make the Salsa, the next time I make chicken, he would like it prepared this way. It was fairly easy and I made the Salsa a little in advance to make it even easier.

I made this dish for my boyfriend (who likes spicy dishes). He loved the mango salsa. I substituted frozen mango chunks for fresh which cut some of the prep time. I also used frozen corn, as fresh was out of season. I would recommend this dish!

This is an all-time favorite in our home. I always substitute Rose's Sweetened and Condensed Lime Juice for the fresh lime - I like the additional punch from the Rose's. Also, I frequently add a little more heat by using a bit of cayenne.

Very Simple, Very Good. I used fresh corn, but steamed it briefly before mixing it with the other ingredients. I seved it with jasmine rice, but next time I'll try the Three Pepper Slaw. Husband loved it, and its lowfat too!

I love this recipe. everytime I make it someone want the recipe. I would not omit the mangoes, that is what makes it so great.

The salsa is really good with tomatoes instead of mangoes. I've made this just for eating with chips. It's that good! I marinated the chicken in lime juice and crushed garlic before battering. This may have been what caused the crust to flake off a little, but it tasted a lot better!

A delicious recipe... fresh, light, and healthy with a lot of flavor. The salsa is especially good. I tried the rec. three-pepper slaw but was not as impressed. (If you love the flavor of chipotoles, you might really like it!)

I made the salsa without corn and the salsa was quite yummy. The breading and frying of the chicken (I did strips) was not worth the hassle, as the crust was just ho-hum. Would use the salsa again on a grilled chicken breast.

The Salsa is what makes this dish. Every time I make this everyone wants the recipe. Two thumbs up.

this is easy and healthy. i really liked the salsa, but thought the chicken was kind of ho-hum. took it to work for lunch and found that the chicken absorbs the salsa flavor really nicely if they sit together awhile. next time i'll try marinating it first...

The chicken was excellent, and we loved the mango salsa, but used a lot less cilantro, which is a pain to chop and tastes like soap if too much is used. Would definately make it again

I made the sals with hot sesame oil and green onions instead of the chile oil and red onions. It was very tasty and effective with the chicken. As suggested, I cooked it as chicken strips, and served it with green onion corn bread.

I have tried making this recipe twice. The second time around I cut the chicken into strips prior to breading and frying. I liked it better that way because there was more surface for the coriander breading to accentuate. The Black Bean and Mango salsa is an incredibly powerful side dish in itself. I love Carribean foods and could eat this along with rice anytime. A definite must try!

The salsa is good. Keep it on hand for some fish. As for the chiken, well I thought you could take it or leave it- the finished product is not bad tasting. It is very simple to make and looks impressive. If you wouldn't consider yourself apt in the kitchen make this one for the wow factor.

The black beans, didnot mix very well with the mango's. But the chicken was devine. I would recommend it to my friends and family.

The coriander was a bit too strong..I would reduce the amount next time. Also, I substituted jicama for the mangos which gave an outstanding texture to the salsa. Try it, you'll like it!

From guests of cook from LONDON (below) - We've come over for lunch with friends and much appreciated the food for the lightness of the salad and the chicken, as we're now on our way to go out and play pool and feel that we can spread ourselves on the baize quite comfoprtably.

Flavorful and easy. I brought the leftovers to work and 5 people asked for the recipe. Not too spicy; the chicken would be plain without the salsa. I used black beans with lime and cilantro already mixed in--I would do that again.

I tried this recipe on two out of town guests. They thought it was very good and so did we. It is something different and presents well. Be careful with the chili oil unless you want to clear your sinus passages :)

This dish was easy and delicious. The salsa was really flavorful, which is good because I think the chicken might have been a bit bland without it. I definitely will make this dish again!

This was a great recipe-more like 3-1/2. My husband loved it too. Though he's a light eater, he even had seconds and asked for more of the salsa and 3 pepper slaw the next day. The cornmeal/coriander made a nice crust for the chicken which was a bit plain but the other acoutrements were very good.

Rating: 4
A wonderful main course that also looks beautiful when served. The recipe for the salsa is more than plenty for 8. I served this with "Three pepper slaw with chipotle dressing" and the "Lime flan with caramelized pineapple" (also from 4/99 issue) and the meal was a hit. Be sure to give yourself plenty of preparation time and you will not be disappointed.

Once the salsa is made the rest is quick. Great way to prepare chicken with a delicious flavor and wonderful color appeal. A must make again!
