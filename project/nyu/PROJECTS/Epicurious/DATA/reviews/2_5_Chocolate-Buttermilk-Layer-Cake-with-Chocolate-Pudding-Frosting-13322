This review is just for the frosting. It was terrible and a waste of good ingredients! Perhaps I should have taken a hint from the name "pudding frosting" because it never set up and oozed all over. I even tried adding more chocolate, but just wasted more good chocolate.

I am only reviewing the frosting. After a search for easy chocolate frosting to decorate a giant birthday cookie, this one seemed fastest. It is very easy to make, you can pipe it easily, and it tastes pretty good. It doesn't have the depth of flavor of a ganache or egg yolk-based icings, but that's a quibble. Really hard to beat for quick frosting!

I only used the frosting from this recipe and I used milk instead of water but I must say, it was simple, creamy and delicious.

I'm only reviewing the frosting, as I didn't make the cake. It's a fascinating recipe - it doesn't have the drawbacks of either classic buttercream, which is too rich for my taste, or "lowbrow" buttercream, which is too sweet for my taste. It's light and creamy, just sweet enough, not too buttery, with good chocolate flavor. It's almost like a chocolate mousse. I admit that I used more chocolate than called for - a whole bar of 85% Valhrona (3.8 oz?) and double the butter. But it's really the technique that I find so interesting. Definitely a keeper.

The cake is good of the cocoa and buttermilk variety and it's moist and easy to make. I used Becel, salt free, instead of butter, with two 8" pans which may prevent some drying, and then split each. With 4 layers I used all filling (nice and chocolatey) and so spread whipped cream with choc. shavings on the top. It's a good keeper too.

What a disappointment. Unfortunately I made this cake for a special occasion. The cake turned out so dry and spongy that I had to throw it away and buy a store bought cake.

This cake was sooo dry you need 3 glasses of milk standing by just so you don't choke to death. I would not recommend this recipe for chocolate cake. I followed the directions and did not overcook, but the cake was extremely dry.

This was a good cake, but I wouldn't consider it company-quality. It was good enough to feed my family on a weeknight, but it really wasn't anything special. The frosting was definitely creamy,but it wasn't an especially unusual, impressive or delicious cake.

For a variation, substitute the water for milk when making the pudding. The chocolate flavor will not be so intense and the pudding will be less firm.
