Excellent. Don't change a thing. I made it with braised beef ribs. Yummy!

I have made this recipe so many times and have loved it every time. The trick is to really take it slow,allowing the rice to absorb the broth each time. I usually use chicken broth when I make it. I have also used dried mushrooms to make the recipe, using the soaking liquid for part of the broth. My guests are always impressed that I can make risotto!

This is my go-to recipe when I want to impress people. It is labor intensive (all that stirring!) but doesn't take much prep. Paired with a good wine and light salad, it's really a wow inducing meal.

I've made this recipe twice. I use shitake, portabella, and crimini mushrooms. Everyone, and I mean everyone wanted more of this. It was creamy and absolutely fantastic. I added just a touch more salt but otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

I've made this receipe a number of times. It's super simple & super tasty. I've made a few changes. I don't use the butter...I don't think that it's needed. Also, I use half olive oil & half truffle oil. (That little tiny bottle of truffle oil is worth every penny you spend on it!) Also, my final change is that instead of using sherry, I use whatever I happen to be drinking...usually a nice central coast pinot noir.

We've made this recipe several times and love it. There are several Wild Mushroom Risotto recipes on here, but this is the simplest and lightest. We use a few more mushrooms than recommended because they really shrink when sauteed. Also, we serve the parmesean cheese on the side (honestly, I prefer the risotto without the cheese, which makes it a lighter dish).

Rating: 4
tried this with wild and brown rice, and chanterelles (since none of the mushrooms the recipe listed are actually wild these days). the pervasive umami flavor was just amazing! the parmesan cheese isn't really necessary, since the flavor is already so rich, so it would be easy to make this a vegan dish, for those who care.

I though it was pretty good. My husband said it wasn't his favorite. Overall, just not as much flavor as I was anticipating. There are definitely better risotto recipes out there.

This recipe was extremely simple and delicious. I recommend to stir constantly in the beginning and stir only frequently towards the end of the cooking process. I also found myself adjusting between medium and medium high once you add the broth, but maybe that's just my stove. Highly recommended. It's also a very versatile risotto recipe, as you can sub whatever you want for the mushrooms and Sherry--I added prosciutto while cooking the mushrooms and added Irish Mist as I had no Sherry. I also used garlic instead of shallot.

Excellent recipe - thanks for submitting it. I make it often in winter. Often use about half "baby bella" mushrooms to go with half various wilds. I use a robust Italian red instead of the sherry. Dry thyme seems to work fine. Use a premium broth (Wolfgang Puck is great but they don't seem to be making that anymore), either chicken, vegetable or a blend and it is OK to dilute it by about 1/3 - 1/2. Don't scrimp on the parmesan. Risottos seem to take more like 22- 24 mins for me. This goes nicely with a grilled pork loin.

Lovely! One of my fondest memories of childhood was my mom's white rice with Campbell's cream of mushroom soup...I was not born into a household of foodies! I loved that dish back then, but this is so, so much better! If only Mom had tried cooking with fresh stuff! I only bought 1/2 lb. of mixed exotic mushrooms, so made up the difference with dried shitakes, which I rehydrated in the broth. Wonderful. I also found that my sherry had disappeared, so tried to make do with a mixture of wine, water, and port. I'll try it made faithfully to the recipe the next time, but this was quite delicious with our grilled duck breasts. I will make again, for ourselves and for company.

I was out of abborio rice, so I substituted half Trader Joe's brown rice medley and half brown basmanti rice. Very flavorful, nutty texture. I also chopped a large onion and sauteed the onion with 3 cloves of garlic in olive oil before adding the mushrooms. I had soaked the wild mushrooms in hot water and then used the broth along with a quart of vegetable broth, adding chopped parsley at the end for color.Delicious!

After I dropped the first, delicious-smelling bottle of imported sherry on my walk home, I was bound and determined to see this dish out. New bottle purchased, turkey broth in fridge, and dried thyme in cupboard led to simple substitutions that worked just fine. IMPORTANT ADDITION: For color and freshness, just-thawed green peas were added in the last five minutes. Made ALL the difference in the world in taste and appearance!

Mmmmm.... What a tasty, tasty brown blob. A couple notes: I halved the recipe, using one can of vegetable broth and half a can of water. Shoot for 1/4 can of water if you want it a bit more al dente. Do not hesitate to double the Parm or Thyme. I used a Norton Reserva Malbec instead of sherry and it really matched well to the earthy mushroom flavors but didn't pair as well beside the dish as it did in it, if that makes sense.

Rating: 4
Oh.My.Gosh. Run - don't walk - to your nearest farmer's market for the freshest mushrooms you can get. This was fantastic! My first taste of this risotto was accidental (I don't usually like mushrooms, but I do love risotto, so didn't hesitate to try it when I saw it). I absolutely had to have the recipe. This is so delicious! As some have noted, a bit ugly but definitely worth it. :-)

Rating: 4
Delicious! Using mushroom broth (I get it from Whole Foods) really makes a big difference. My only complaint is that it's not very visually appealing (think a brown blob) - so I usually top the servings with some fresh grated parm and thyme, to make it look a little prettier. Oh, and the recipe is still great if you substitute oil for butter and omit the cheese - so it's vegan-friendly, too.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I use less butter and soak half an ounce of dried mushrooms in the veg broth before cooking. Then I add the chopped reconstituted mushrooms near the end. Don't forget the thyme or sherry- - each element is important for flavor in this dish

This was my first time making risotto - and since my first attempt at making a roux (another item requiring slow addition of liquid and vigilant stirring) was a tremendous failure, I was somewhat intimidated. But this recipe proved to be both delicious and easy. I used only 2T each of butter and olive oil and 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese. I think more would make the dish overpoweringly rich and cheesy. I also replaced the shallots half an onion and a couple fennel bulbs. For mushrooms, I used half crimini and half portabello. This is the kind of dish that makes it easy to be a vegetarian.

Rating: 4
I've been making this for a few years now. It's become my "go to" recipe for risotto. I use to add more parmesan, but it really detracted from the flavor. Use only the amount called for. And to state the patently obvious, the mushrooms make the dish. Wild mushrooms fresh from the farmer's market = 4 star dining experience. Button mushrooms from the supermarket = 2 star dining. Serve and wait for compliments!!

Rating: 4
Wonderful dish. We used only 2/3 of the butter called for. Will become a staple.

This was the first time I've ever made risotto...I've always been a bit scared by it. This was absolutely delicious altho a bit time consuming. I realized after the fact that I forgot to add the olive oil. It didn't seem to be an issue. I paired this with broiled asaragus and a 2002 Au Bon Climat Pinot Noir...yum!

My husband made this as written, except he added a bit of spinach for color. Used only shitakes and criminis. Everyone loved it (party of 8). Next time we will cut the cheese a bit as it over-powered the wonderful mushroom flavor.

Rating: 2
This was good, but a little sweet for my tastes -- maybe less sherry? Or some lemon at the end? The mushrooms are great though...so I might make it again, with modifications. Also, not sure why but it *always* takes me longer (and I end up using more broth) than the recipe states in order to get the risotto to "al dente". I ended up stirring this for over 40 minutes once I started adding vegetable broth.

Rating: 4
This was SOOO incredible! I made this as a main course. I replaced 2 T of the butter with olive oil, and added a little more parmesan and thyme for presentation. While it does require a little more attention, I did not find it difficult or extremely time consuming at all. It was so delicious.

Crazy easy to make! Enough for 6 with some leftover if used as a side. I paired with Pan-Seared Tuna with Ginger Shitake Cream Sauce for a "mushroom" theme and it worked great! I even had a mushroom hater at the table and he cleared his plate!

I was looking for a risotto recipe where I could substitute quinoa for arborio rice and so decided to try this one. It came out absolutely wonderful, with lots of flavor, and still a great conistency. I actually used dehydrated wild mushrooms which I reconstituted as suggested on the packet, (it's all I had) and used veggie broth plus a bit of the leftover water from reconstituing the mushrooms. I was really happy with the dish. I also used a bit of lemon zest at the end to compliment the beautiful flavor of thyme. :)

Of all of the different risottos I've eaten, wild mushroom will always be one of my favourites. I made this as written, and used mushroom broth instead of vegetable because they carry it at my market. Also added a drizzle of white truffle oil at the end for a little pizzazz. Yum!

I had printed this recipe for a week before I got around to making it because my girlfreind kept saying it sounds too ............but when I finally did we both really loved it! It was also so easy, I used dried Shitake mushrooms and added the water from them to the broth and boiled it down. Nice!

I made this dish for the second time this past Friday for a lazy night dinner. Here were my amendments to the recipe: I halved the vegetable stock and diluted it with water. I also reduced the butter to a 2 x 2 cm. cube, which still kept the integrity of the dish while lessening the saturated fats, and used two tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil instead of three. The dish was still phenomenal.

Very good, but with a little tweaking, it is excellent. We like a lot of earthy mushroom flavor in our risotto, so I drizzle a touch of truffle oil in at the end - outstanding. In the absence of truffle oil, try boiling a few dried mushrooms (porcini or shiitake) in some broth or water, straining, and then adding this to the liquid used to cook the rice - this adds a nice, rich, mushroom flavor.

This was pretty good, but not anything too special- I used mushroom broth to up the flavor and extra cheese and herbs. Pretty good standard mushroom rissoto.

Excellent risotto recipe. Had to use chicken broth, which I don't think affected flavor, but next time I make it, I'd like to try either vegetable or mushroom broth. The flavor of the mushrooms was fantastic and really came through. Also, used chives instead of thyme and it added a nice taste. Well worth the time at the stovetop.

This is the easiest and best risotto that I've ever made! Use this as the meal to make when we're out of everything. Often use reconstituted 'shrooms of many varieties when are out of fresh. Have also used the risotto recipe sans 'shrooms for base of other ingrediets.

This was my first attempt at risotto and it was delicious. I bought dried mushrooms and used the liquid to refresh them as my mushroom stock. I supplemented that with some vegetable broth. I will definately be making this again - probably for Thanksgiving.

I agree this recipe is much better using mushroom stock. the problem with purchased mushroom stock or concentrate is that alot of salt is often added which makes it difficult to fine-tune the seasoning. To make your own quick mushroom broth, simply buy dried wild mushrooms instead of fresh and soak them in hot chicken stock, vegetable stock (low or no sodium) or water. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve or coffee filter, dry the soaked mushrooms and proceed. It is also worth noting that a drizzling of truffle oil at the end sends this risotto over the top!!

I loved this. In my opinion, it tastes NOTHING like "minute rice." I used a blend of fresh wild mushrooms, and mushroom broth. It was delicious, and since I was cooking for a vegetarian friend, it made a lovely meatless entree.

I love mushroom risotto and this one turned out great. I just had a question to the other cooks out there...would it make a big difference without using the 1/2 of sherry or dry white wine? My friend's diet cannot take alcohol (even the essence that remains upon heating)...any advice?

I made this with brown and wild rice. Didn't have shallots, used 1 garlic clove instead. Otherwise, followed it to the letter and it was great. BUT!!! It tastes remarkably like Safeway brand Long Grain and Wild Rice with Seasoning (purple box) which is 1/2 the effort and 1/2 the price. For those of you who love this taste but lack the time to make it, try the Safeway "minute rice" version.

Definitely use mushroom broth. A site called happycookers.com sells concentrated wild mushroom base and also I added the soaking liquid from dried porcinis, which I minced and sauteed with the other mushrooms. Also added a bit of minced onion and finished with a bit of butter. Excellent.

Although I changed the recipe it came out great. I added another 1/2 cup of rice (and added 1/2 more of the other ingredients) to make up for adding more items. I used dried shiitake mushrooms and the broth used was from the rehydrating of the mushrooms. I also added steamed asparagus and cooked shrimp at the end of the cooking cycle. This turned out great!

Amazingly made with veggie broth this dish is good, but if you substitute it with chicken broth it is outstanding.

We liked this recipe, had it as a main dish, and decided we may have used too much mushrooms. We had soaked some dry shiitake mushrooms, two little packages of them, and then used the broth along with some additional mushroom broth and some dry white wine. It was good, and once you got used to the mushroom flavor, we changed our minds and realized the amount of shrooms was good. However, it is a rich enough dinner that, despite having nothing else but bruschetta with chevre as an appetizer, it was more than we could eat. Also, it took about 2 hours from start to finish to incorporate the liquid. If you expect risotto or parmesan flavor, you might not like it. If you are a mushroom fan, you will love it.

This was the best risotto dish I have ever made. The variety of mushrooms and the addition of sherry (perhaps I would have added a touch more) was divine. I served this as a main dish, however if you are going to serve this as a side, make sure the main course is kind of simple so that it doesn't detract from the risotto.

Delicious. I'm eating it as I type. I substituted a combination of low sodium chicken and beef stock for the vegetable stock since my grocery store didn't have it.
