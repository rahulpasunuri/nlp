Don't change a thing. However, I divided the crust into 2 instead of 3 and made a slightly larger tart.

I made this for the lemon tart on this site as mini 2" tarts. One recipe yielded about 60 mini tarts. As other reviewers had advised (with that recipe) I added a little fresh rosemary. Next time will increase it just a bit- it's delicious. also, for reasons too boring to explain here, I added 1 extra egg with excellent results. Not sure how it compares to 1 egg but you could half the recipe this way.

Delicious and easy to make. A little bit difficult to handle uniformly when lining a pie pan but worth the effort. I have used in several pie recipes and have received lots of positive comments regarding this crust.

Agree with previous reviewer on its fragility but unique and tasty.

Fragile but delicious.

I've made this crust for Keller's Lemon Sabayon a couple of times now. It has consistently been delicious. It's fairly easy, given the complexity of many of his French Laundry recipes, but equally scrumptious.
