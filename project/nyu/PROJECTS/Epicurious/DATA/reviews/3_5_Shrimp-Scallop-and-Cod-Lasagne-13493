This recipe was awesome- on got started on it early but people began eating it and 4:30 it was almost gone- oh well. Mine was not soupy and I used nonfat milk also. I did not have fish stock so used one fish boullion in one cup of hot water and 1 tsp of lobster boullion (in a jar) in a cup of hot water. Everyone loved this dish! I will be making it often- it will be excellent for something like Xmas brunch or Thanksgiving pot luck, valentines day, birthdays. I'm thinking it may be greater with a touch of English parsley and one day I will try it with a few peas. Fabulous!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was delicious, rich and unique. Only problem, it was soupy as others have noted. I think you should use less milk and stock maybe only 3 cups total of white sauce. Definately include cod it flakes up nicely, helps keep filling together. Also I hardly cooked the seafood and found it to be tender after baking. I put lasagna together earlier in the day and waited to bake it. Did not notice any problem with this.

This was excellent, but it took a while to make and used a lot of dishes! Instead of cooking the shrimp separately from the other seafood, I just added scallops and fish a tad before the shrimp and cooked them all in one skillet. I used bay scallops instead of sea scallops.

Well, if I hadn't been in such a hurry to make this for a party I would have paid more attention to what was happening.. ended up with a very soupy (as previously mentioned by everyone) "lasagne" that I renamed a seafood stew. Why does the recipe call for whipped cream to be added to a perfectly thickened white sauce? I will omit this next time. Surprisingly, I could not locate a whitefish stock here on the coast of Massachusetts, so I bought some lobster shells from the local fish market and used them with my shrimp shells and some old leeks to make a lovely stock of my own. As per some notes here, I added basil. The result was very, very flavorful, with tender seafood, but so soupy. I bet some tomato paste would great, as suggested here as well. I'll try it again, but more carefully.

i think this is a really nice dish and have made it many times. i do drain the cooking liquid from the seafood, which seems to help with the runniness. also, i add a little tomato paste to the cream, which gives it a nice color, and have added fresh herbs when i have them. basil is really goo in this.

Whew, I could have used a sous chef for this one. Very tasty. Not so much chopping but so many layer, bowls, pans. The end result was very good. I used a bland shrimp stock I made from the shells so it could have been better. I was paranoid of it being too runny as many of the reviewers mentioned, so I used about 3/4s of the stock. It wasn't runny at all, maybe even a little dry. I used ritz crakers instead of bread crumbs because that's what I had on hand. I didn't use cod, only bay scallops and shrimp. It was very tasty. I'll make it again for my next party. I hope I can make it ahead.

This rates 4 forks as I adapted it..eliminated the cod and used only shrimp and scallops. Instead of white fish stock, I used lobster base and water that I had cooked the shrimp shells in. I added some thyme, Old Bay and sliced onion to the white sauce, cooked 1/2 an hour and then strained. I barely seared the shrimp and scallops, leaving them 3/4 raw. It is key to undercook the shellfish because if you don't, you'll end up with rubber. That was obvious from the first reading of this recipe. I've made this about 6 times and every time to rave reviews. I, too, use two square pans.

I was very disappointed with this dish; the flavor was too subtle to be memorable, and the no-bake noodles remained undercooked while the fish was overcooked. In addition, this dish requires a *lot* of chopping and prep work - the end result simply wasn't worth the effort.

I made this in two square pans, instead of one large one - and my family loved it so much they were guarding the second pan! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was incredible!!! The only thing that will keep me from making it often is the astronomical price of leeks and fennel (thought that might just be here in Hawaii). The ingredients cost nearly $90...

Used 2 lbs. of cod, 1 lb. of shrimp, and NO cream. Looked soupy when cooking but after sitting 10 minutes all the liquid was obsorbed and it was perfect.

I've made this several times and it always gets raves. Though I think it's good as written (though a little runny), I like the following changes: half parmesan/half Fontina, a little good quality tomato paste and fresh basil added to the sauce, no boil noodles, and mushrrooms added to the seafood. Also, I think bay scallops are a fine, and less expensive, substitution for sea scallops.

I'd make this again but with a few changes. The scallops were overcooked and tough, so I'd probably substitute pieces of salmon. Also, I reduced the liquid on the advice of previous reviewers but the result was too dry - I'd stick to the recipe next time. The sauce was outstanding though - restaurant quality. I think I'd make this again as a noodle dish rather than as lasagne - i.e. cook some noodles, pan fry the cod, shrimp and scallops, fold them into the sauce, then spoon the mix over the noodles - serving with a simple salad and cheese bread.

I followed this recipe to the letter. I thought the flavor was subtle, yet delicious...an elegant, cost-effective, convenient way to serve many. The dish was, however, very "soupy"...in fact, I had about two cups of excess "seafood sauce" which I used later over pasta. Someone recommended I use the non-no boil (regular) pasta and not pre-cook it. In any event, I'll definitely make it again!

Although I almost left out the fennel,I am glad I did include it; the dish was fabulous! I also threw in quite a bit of fresh garlic when I was sauteeing the leeks and fennel. I doubled the recipe for a large party, but used all shrimp and scallops. I made the white fish stock by sauteeing garlic, onions, potatoes and cod, before adding water. Most people ate this in total silence, it was that good. Use a high quality parmesan in this recipe.

I don't like fennel so substituted with chopped leeks and carrots. Instead of fish stock, I made shrimp stock with the shells. Also eliminated the cod and increased shrimp. I also would opt for regular pasta. I could hardly find the "no-boil" stuff. I don't think my changes were responsible for the dish not holding together, and I wondered if the addition of another, more solid chees might have helped. I let it rest for 1/2 hour, but it still didn't hold together. Also, the shellfish was tough after cooking then baking for 40 minutes. The flavor was good, but I'd do something else with the newburg-style sauce.

This recipe always sounded so delicious, and had terrific reviews - I couldn't wait to make it. Well maybe my expectations were too high but, I thought it was only good not great. I will try making it again though with some of my own modifications. I used the Barilla no-bake noodles, next time I might try a sturdier pasta which should soak up some of the extra liquid. Mine was a bit watery.

This is one of the most delicious dishes we've had. I've made it several times for special occasions, holidays, dinner parties, etc. My family and guests always love it. The work and expense is worth it. The combination of flavors is sublime. I definitely wouldn't eliminate the fennel - I think it's an integral part of the recipe.

Loved this lasagne. I used red pepper instead of fennel, as another member suggested, and made the fish broth by adding 2 cups of water to the skillet after frying the seafood. Omitted the cream as well. Even with all the changes, the dish was absolutely superb. Highly recommended.

I made this recipe with chicken stock instead of the fish stock. I used mini scallops in order to avoid extra steps in an already laborious recipe. Also, I used an old cheddar rather than the very expensive parmesan. Yum!

I would like to make this recipe but before i make it too salty or bland i would like to have some information on a basic amount of salt to use. Neither the white sauce nor the scallops contain any salt. Any help?

This was very time consuming to make. It was excellent - I used stick margarine and vegetable stock as substitutions. When I make it again, I would omit the step of adding the whipping cream. It was very rich and the white sauce was thick enough without the cream.

I totally forgot about this recipe! Now that I have been reminded of it, I think I'll make it tomorrow!

I added roasted red pepper sauce to the white sauce, omitted the fish and the fennel, and used 3 lbs shrimp and 1 lb scallops. I made the dish for a large party; everybody raved about it and requested the recipe - it was a hit. It is perfect for a party, because you can assemble the lasagne ahead of time, then cook it while the appetizers are being served.

We thought this dish was excellent. We were surprised to find fennel bulb at the local grocer and substituted veg stock for the fish stock. Its pretty easy to prepare, we even had our guests do most of the work.
