Can't say anything positive that hasn't already been said about this simple recipe. Added some toasted almonds, chopped, but I don't think they added much. If I'd had more time, I would have made "Peach and Cream Shortcakes with Cornmeal-Orange Biscuits", also from this site.

made a few changes. first we added a pinch of salt to the butter/sugar mixture. we also included bananas with the peaches. We served it over vanilla bean ice cream and threw on some crumbled up, home made chocolate chip cookies. overall it was a delicious and simple dessert. definitely a keeper!

This is a wonderful, quick summer dessert. Add some pecans. You can make it in advance until it is time to add the rum. Finish with rum on medium heat before serving over ice cream!

Full disclosure: I'm a wee bit tipsy writing this, but it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. This was so simple to make, particularly for how delicious it is. I cut up the peaches 2hrs ahead of time and added the vanilla, plus a dash of rum (1tsp) and a touch of cream and let it all soak. Upon starting the butter/brown sugar, I followed the directions as-written and this turned our marvelously. I think I'll do what another reviewer suggested and use this, sans rum, for french toast, crepes, waffles, or pancakes. Did I mention how easy this recipe is? YUM!

Made as dessert for a southern food themed gourmet group....filled margarita glasses with 2 scoops of vanlla icecream with sauce over top - made whipped cream and sprinkled with rum soaked chopped toasted pecans and planted a pencil sized wafer cookie on top! It looked peachy (couldn't resist the pun) and it was a perfect light and creamy ending for a July dinner party.

This is a good dessert if you are trying to get rid of some peaches. It's not quite as good as the caramelized banana with rum sauce from this site. The recipe halves easily. I misread the instructions, and cut each peach into 8 pieces - you really want to cut each half into 8 pieces, for 16 per peach. This makes it easier to cook and smaller pieces to eat.

A very tasty, very basic dessert. I made it with frozen peaches and it was still quite good. While I served it with ice cream this time, next time I might serve it with crepes.

Absoulutely scrumptious! This recipe is a keeper! It was so easy to make and the sauce thickens nicely. It's sweet, fruity,and has a great caramel-like consistency. This would taste fabulous on pancakes or waffles. You must try it!

Super easy. I put the peaches on the ice cream without letting them cool. It was a mistake; the ice cream turned to soup. I would suggest letting it cool maybe 5 minutes before spooning on top of ice cream.

Heavenly! And so easy to make. I added some sliced almonds on top which gave it a nice touch.

Delicious. I wanted to sample the dish before committing to the full size so I used two peaches and 1/3 portion of the other ingredients. Don't like cinnamon so I cut it out. And I used brandy instead of rum. Still delicious. I am wondering what it would taste like if I used a bit of lemon extract in place of some of the vanilla. In any case, my compliments to Chef Medeiros! Barknot, Miami Beach, FL

This recipe is good and simple, something you can do to dress peaches up quickly.

I made this dish because we were given a bag full of peaches. I wanted to make something easy for desert. This was a family hit and we will be making it more often. We will be using the leftovers on pancakes in the morning.

Why the 75% rating with two 4's and two 3's? Well, let me add another 4 anyway. This recipe deserves it!!!

I made this dessert for a dinner party and a friend who loves peaches. I did not expect to like it, but it is the best dessert I have ever made and have served it many times.

Given how easy this is to make, I'm surprised at the lack of reviews. It comes out wonderful exactly as is, unlike many recipes. We'll try it again on waffles instead of ice cream.
