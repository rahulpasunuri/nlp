FYI,this is not a dressing, it's a marinade. I wanted an Asian dressing recipe and tried this because of the name, but ended up throwing it away because it tasted so bad. Perhaps its better as a marinade.

I tried this salad two times. The first time it was good. The next time, it was so-so. You must let the mushrooms marinate in the dressing for more than 45 minutes to really have a good salad. If you don't, the mushrooms are hard and not very flavorfull.
