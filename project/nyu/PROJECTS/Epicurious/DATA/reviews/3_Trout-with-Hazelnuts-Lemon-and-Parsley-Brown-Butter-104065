Crucial detail: I started with a mix of raw hazelnuts and pinenuts, and forgot to toast them first! After adding breadcrumbs and It. parley, I decided to toast the entire nut-crumb mixture under the broiler. I browned it, and it seemed to work just fine. Also, the recipe has that annoying feature of using some ingredients at one point and the rest at another. I hate that! I always end up putting all or none in, and always in the wrong place. I cut the recipe in half, which added to the confusion. By the time I cut open the inside of the whole trout, I decided just to fillet them. I did not bake the fillets, just pan fried them. Also, I forgot to add It. parsley to the brown butter mix, and so I sprinkled it fresh on top of the sauce instead. Even so, the recipe was robust through all my errors and still tasted great!

a little buttery, and the crumb mixture was way too much. I would 1/2 this.

Made this for my husband who is not a trout person and he loved it. It's a great, somewhat unique dinner for guests. Used a bit of eggwash to help nuts stick. Be sure to keep the cooking surface well oiled and at medium or the nuts will burn before the trout is cooked.

This is really easy and delicious. I made it with pine nuts first time around, skipped the breadcrumbs and forgot the lemon peel but the spirit of the recipe is hard to mess up.

The hazelnut-trout taste was excellent and the instructions were simple. However, I chopped the nuts in my food processor and I dipped the fish in a little beaten egg to make the hazelnuts and breadcrumbs adhere a little better.

We really enjoyed this... My husband made this for my folks and I tonight. My dad is not the easiest man to please when it comes to food and especially when it comes to trout. Needless to say, he LOVED this. He wanted to give it 5 forks but with a modification. No need to bake the trout in addition to pan frying. Just an extra, unnecessary step.

Rather bland, the hazelnuts overpowered the trout. Don't bother.

I've tried this recipe twice, much better the second time after adding additional spice to the sauce like lemon pepper and seasoned salt to wake up the blandness...Macademia nuts used instead of hazelnuts gave a more buttery flavor.

A delightful dish. I will work on the presentation next time but thought the recipe tastes to be perfectly balanced. I served it with a wild mushroom risotto. A recipe to save in your recipe box !

Absolutely delicious; every time my boyfriend or I took a break from the trout to eat a side dish, the subsequent bite of fish elicited a "Wow, this is incredible." We used crushed pine nuts instead of hazelnuts (pine nuts were on sale for $2.99/lb, so how could we not stock up?), and the bright, fresh flavors were an absolute delight.

Considering the effort and the high-fat ingredients that went into this recipe, I was very disappointed with the bland results. It was not very tasty and did not make an attractive presentation.

Incredible recipe, especially with trout straight from the stream. Everyone I prepared this for was absolutely thrilled.

Made with trout filets instead of the whole fish (freshly caught!). Although tasty, the sauce was a bit rich - and I only used 1/2 the cube of butter - I felt it overpowered the fish.

Have made this twice for various special occasions. Despite its relative ease, this recipe tastes and presents like a dish from the finest restaurant. I will make it over and over.

This is a spectacular recipe!!! I have made it twice and everyone LOVED IT! Keep asking for those restaurant favorites! They're great! Made it with the pumpkin soup and it was a great dinner both times. Jenny J.

Made this dish for friends the other night, and we all liked it. The hazelnuts added a lot of flavor to the fish. And this was even though I forgot to make the sauce! (Got involved in conversation, hubby was cooking the fish, walked in the kitchen, looked at the ingredients for the sauce waiting for me, and said, oh well)
