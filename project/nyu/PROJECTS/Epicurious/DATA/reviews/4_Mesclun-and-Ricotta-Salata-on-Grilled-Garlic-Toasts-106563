yummy, fluffy, light. I served it with only roasted cherry tomatoes and a bit of basil. the only problem is that it didn't make as much as it was supposed to.

Flawless. The balance of flavors and textures is unbeatable. I read this recipe when it first appeared in print but without a grill was not able to try it. I finally did tonight and it lived up to the years of anticipation. I think the lemon garnish wouldn't be missed. I ended up with a big fat loaf of bread that would only cut into thick slices, and serving that alongside a gazpacho was a perfect first course. By August it will constitute the entire meal.

Delicious, delicious, delicious. Easy, easy, easy. The salad dressing is very light and lemony tasting. I zested a lemon using an ordinary zester and did not go through all the steps they mentioned. I used French bread and feta cheese beause I could not find ricotta salata. Also, I used the feta with black olives and sundried tomatoes. The bread is like croutons only a better presentation. Very pretty on the plate. This salad could be a light meal by itself.
