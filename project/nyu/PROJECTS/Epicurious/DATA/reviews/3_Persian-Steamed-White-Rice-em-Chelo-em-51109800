I have tried several recipes from this author and HIGHLY recommend her book. This method worked beautifully, the texture of the rice was perfect. The taste came out bland and the bottom part did not cook very well for me (I failed on the tadig). I think that had more to do with my lack of experience and uncertainty of what it SHOULD come out like (alas, I am not married to a Persian!)
