I cut this recipe in half and only used a pinch of salt; trick is to really cook this down in order to get the browned pieces that you want. Even with only 2#, it makes a ton, but who cares? Extra carnitas are not going to sit in my fridge for very long!

Best, simplest carnitas recipe I've seen so far. I agree with previous review regarding salt - I used 2 tsp, and that was just enough. Used about 12oz more liquid for larger quantity of meat during braise, then removed the extra liquid during open simmer. Added 1 orange, cut in eighth, to braise.

Do not use as much salt as they say. Used the 4 tsp kosher salt as listed and this is unbearably salty. What a waste of 4lbs of meat. I'm sure Everything would have been great otherwise.
