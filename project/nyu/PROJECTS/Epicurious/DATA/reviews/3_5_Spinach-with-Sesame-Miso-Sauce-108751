Like most Japanese recipes, Gomai is simple, fast and healthy. In Japan, they wouldn't waste the stems though, they're full of texture and nutrients. Instead, just trim the very ends to open them up. Take the whole bunch in your hands, stems down and hold the stems in the water for 30 sec as they take longer, then lower the leaves in for an additional 15 sec.

This tasted just like the Gomae at my favorite Japanese restaurant! The miso was a bit salty so I threw out the first batch of the sauce and started over with less miso. I also added about a teaspoon of fresh peanut butter, which added a nice peanut flavor. My whole family loved it!

Really good - just like I remember from Japan. Had to add a little bit more water for a better consistency. Also added more toasted sesame seeds. A hit!

My mom used to make Goma ae very much like this one! I highly recommend to use "toasted sesame seeds" which you can buy at Asian food market. It is really fregrant, flavorful and usally very inexpencive. (It makes such a difference in end result.) I used to make sesame paste myself like you make peanut butter.
