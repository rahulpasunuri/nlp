My favorite potato salad recipe, as-is.

I have never changed a thing to this recipe and it always comes out great. I make it all the time for BBQ's and everyone loves it!

This was great, basic potato salad. It didn't knock my socks off, but it made a huge quantity and was a big hit. It will definitely be my standard go-to potato salad recipe from now on. It was very easy to make. I splashed in some pickle juice, per the reviewers' suggestions, but perhaps I didn't splash in enough, because the extra kick of flavor wasn't noticeable.

Wonderful recipe. I modify to our personal taste a bit. I add 3/4C of sour cream to the mayo and mustard mixture and fold it all in at the end. I also add one 3oz bag of Oscar Mayer pre cooked bacon bits. When I'm in the mood I've also added shredded cheddar and or capers. Depends on what I'm pairing the potato salad with. My belief is that potato salad should basically be a cold picnic style turned out fully loaded baked potato.

I followed the advice below and generously salted the water. I also only used 1/2 a cup of mayo and about 1.5 tbs of dijon. It was fantastic!

Rating: 4
This is a great all-around potato salad recipe. My only adjustment would be to use less dijon as it was a bit overpowering. I also added a little sweet pickle juice. Everyone devoured it!

I've always tried to make "gourmet" potato salads and they never quite deliver. Wouldn't you know that the recipe with the most common ingredients can be the best. This salad is FANTASTIC! By far the best potato salad I've ever made. The addition of pickles added so much flavor. This will be my standard potato salad recipe from now on.

Adding the cilantro and curry powder was absolutely delicious! I thought it might overpower, but it was perfect.

WONDERFUL! Made it for the 4th of July. This IS the potato salad of choice for my family now! I made it exactly as called for in the recipe. Found it helpful to measure this time around so I knew what the portions should be like -- 8 of the dill pickle spears I had would have been too many for 1.5 cups.

I really like this potato salad. I'm not a fan of dijon mustard, but it's not too overpowering. I added a little Old Bay seasoning to it and it totally rocked!

Rating: 4
Fantastic, simple, balanced, perfect. I read all the reviews, considered everyone thoughts valuable but in the end discarded all the variations, wanting to givr the integrity of this recipe a fair try before changing it. It was perfect. Everyone enjoyed the salad, even those who typically pass up potato salad.

Great potato salad! Not heavy on mayonnaise flavor. I used sour dill pickles which added a great taste. I also cut the potatoes while hot and drizzled italian dressing over them and then let them cool before assembling the salad. I would make again!

Rating: 4
Do try the cilantro, it is an awesome flavor with the rest of the ingredients. Since I started making this, people rave about my potato salad and ask for the recipe.

Rating: 4
Everyone loves this! I make half the batch with eggs and half without. I thought it was too simple at first, but the flavors are incredible and everyone asks me for the recipe. I add about 1 tablespoon of coarse harvest mustard in addition to the dijon mustard.

classic, simple and great. What else is there is there to say?

Rating: 3
A very basic salad much like I've had all my life (and I'm 52...) One thing to point out is the suggestion to let this slad sit out at room temperature for an hour before serving - not the brightest idea with a mayonaise based dressing, especially during the summer and possibly at picnics where there's already a problem with keeping food properly chilled.

This is the only potato salad that I make. I just use a little less mayo. And kosher salt and pepper. Perfect.

I've been looking of a good, simple potato salad recipe that would remind me of what we ate at picnics and parties when I was young. This is it!

This recipe was wonderful. I don't even like potato salad but I really liked this. I made it for a BBQ and everyone loved it. I added the pickle juice like other reviewers suggested, plus the cilantro and curry powder-- YUMMY! This is a winner.

I used kosher dills, which are brined, rather than vinegar pickled. I found I had to add a splash of white vinegar to compensate. Also, the dijon I used may have been old and the mustard bite not as strong so next time I will buy fresher mustard or add more. I omitted the celery and missed the crunch but didnt miss the flavor. I added in some green onion tops for color and flavor. My guests ate it up and asked for the leftovers as we were packing up from the picnic

This has become our family favorite. It is Excellent! The pickles are wonderful in this salad. I do usually take most of the peel off the potatoes(kids). I don't think it would be as good if you skipped any of the ingredients, the combination is perfect.

Rating: 2
This looks like the potato salad I used to eat as a child (nice bright yellow color). But somehow, it's not quite right. The "sauce" was a little thin, and I thought it could have used less onion. It's possible to perk this up a bit with additions, but working just with these ingredients and directions as printed, I wasn't a huge fan of this edible, but forgettable potato salad.

Rating: 4
WOW!! What an easy & tasty recipe!! Everybody loved it. Instead of the dill pickles, I used relish, 'cause that's what I had at home, I just added a few tablespoonfuls, kept tasting until it's to my liking... oh, and I also skipped the celery, because someone in the family doesn't like it. But this recipe is so easy, and it taste GREAT!!!! I will definitely make this again and again.

I finally made this recipe, not bad, but I think I might have added too much mayonnaise, but it was delicious! I could have eaten a ton (but I'm dieting). Still, it was great to try it, will make again!

Great classic potato salad recipe. Liked that it wasn't heavy on the mayo (but still tastes amazing). I prefer sweet pickles instead of dill, used those and loved the result. I also used 4 eggs instead of 5. this one's a keeper!

I have always made my own version of potato salad. Well not anymore. We loved this recipe. It has the perfect amount of crunch and flavor. I did what a previous reviewer suggested and added some of the pickle juice along with the pickles. Great Advice. This will be our standard recipe from now on!

lovely potato salad like grandma used to make. i used the exact recipe, and everyone had a childhood memory from it.

And I just realized, in re-reading the recipe that the salt & pepper are in the instructions below! So, never mind! My aunt made the salad for a Mother's Day BBQ, and forgot the seasoning!

The only thing missing in this recipe is salt & pepper. It definitely needs some seasoning to it. Otherwise, it's a very good potato salad recipe.

Excellent basic potato salad recipe. I made it with a 5-lb bag of potatoes and upped the other quantities of ingredients proportionatly. Perfect!

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I've made dozens of potato salads over the years and this is the best. It's not too heavy -- just enough mayonnaise to coat the potatoes -- which is perfect. Add a generous helping of freshly ground pepper before serving.

I made this recipe with Idaho potatoes as that was all I had. I went precisely by the recipe, even adding pickle juice to mayo/mustard. I didn't like at all, I thought it was too "mushy". I guess I used too much pickle juice or Idaho's just don't work with this potato salad. I tasted too much pickle, onion and celery which I didn't like. Was not at all impressed with this recipe!!!!

Rating: 3
I just made this, and it's chilling in my fridge right now. First impressions are very good... old-fashioned style potato salad. Julia Child's recipe uses the same ingredients and some.. it is superior, but a lot more work. So I have a feeling I'll make this one more often. One thing - the recipe in the magazine says to cut up the potatoes and then cook them. This internet version says to cook and then cut. I made it from the magazine. I might add some pickle juice next time, because I like vinegar in potato salad.

I've actually made this numerous times, but never reviewed it. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper, but I do love it. Also, the kids really love this. I don't use red potatos, but regular ones - whatever they are called.

This recipe was so good that I'm making it again for a family reunion this weekend for many, many people.

Good enough for 4 forks! Secret=good pickles (kind that must be kept refrigerated) cut chunky. Also added lots of the juice for a creamier dressing.

Excellent! Very close to my family's recipe-- try adding a teensy bit of finely chopped sweet pickle, a finely minced/grated garlic clove, and a small splash of liquid smoke. Pure heaven...

I loved this recipe! I brought it to a cookout and everyone raved over it. I followed other users, and added a couple of tablespoons of pickle juice. I highly recommend this recipe.

Amazing...what a unique combination. Go with the other reviewers and add the chili powder...it really makes the dish!

Rating: 3
We've made this dish several times this summer--our new fav potato salad recipe (although, hey, I don't think it's hard to make a good potato salad!) Best recommendation is the curry powder. We usually eat it one day and then the next add curry powder/turmeric, etc. and serve the leftovers as a side with an Indian-type dish, (Indian-marinated lamb chops). If you're looking for a potato salad, you should try this one!

This salad was delicious and got rave reviews at a potluck to which i brought it. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 3
Was in a hurry and didn't read to cut them up before cooking until I had them in the pot boiling but that worked, chopped them slightly smaller than 1 inch. Halved the recipe (two eggs). Right after making, it was a little bland but a couple of hours later, delicious. Extremely easy to make. I like it because it's more potato salad than mayo salad. Usually have to cut the dressing by at least 1/3.

Rating: 2
It's not that this recipe was bad by any means, but it wasn't anything special either. In fact, it tastes the same as the potato salad I can buy in pretty much any grocery store deli. Next time I will save myself the hours of time shopping, chopping, dicing, boiling, cubing, mixing, and chilling -- and just buy it from the grocery store deli.

The reason you couldn't find the recipe in the June issue is because it's actually in the July issue -- including a mini-interview with Roseanne Cash. Epicurious put the wrong month on the recipe.

Rating: 4
I made this for a Fourth of July party and it was a big hit! Like a previous reviewer, I cut the potatoes and then steamed them for about 15 minutes-they were perfect and didn't fall apart. This is a definite keeper. I was surprised I missed this recipe in my Bon Appetit as I am a big fan of Rosanne. I just looked through my June 2004 issue twice and couldn't find it. Anyone have a page number?

This was a lovely potato salad. I added the cilantro & curry as suggested. It was a wonderful "different" salad. Several were surprised how much they did like it with the dill pickles & cilantro & curry. The flavors are vibrant but play together so nicely, no ingredient is too "loud". It's a keeper for picnics now for our family.

Rating: 4
Not the most original of recipes, but the kind of thing you want in a traditional potato salad. The coarsely-chopped pickles were a nice surprise. I think I'd add some chopped parsley, but that's all. Rosanne has done June and Johnny proud!

Rating: 3
Rosanne knows her potato salad. The only thing I did differently was to add a couple of tbs. of pickle juice. Other types of potatoes can be substituted, depending on how important it is to you that they retain their shape. Red potatoes hold up well, but Idaho will soak up more of the dressing. Just make sure they are well cooked. Life's too short to eat crunchy potato salad.

Rating: 3
One tip I picked up from Cook's Magazine that makes all the difference: slice the red potatoes before cooking them! This ensures even cooking, no matter how widely the potatoes vary in size, and eliminates the burned fingers and raggedy shreds of potato skin that result from trying to cut up hot potatoes (come on, hardly anyone ever waits until they've cooled enough!). I cut the potatoes into 1/4" slices, and add 2 tsps salt and 2 tablespoons vinegar to the cooking water, so that the potatoes have a very slight zing to them, and taste fully seasoned when dressed with the mustard/mayonnaise. I cook them until a fork penetrates the slices, but not too easily. Taste a cooled-off potato slice - it should be firm, not mushy or tender, but fully cooked and no longer raw-tasting. I mix the mayonnaise and mustard thoroughly with all the other ingredients before/during the potato cooking, and then add the mixture to the HOT sliced potatoes, stirring just enough to coat them. They will absorb more flavor if dressed/seasoned when hot, or so they say. Some slices will break apart, but it won't turn into mashed potatoes like some recipes can lead to.

This recipe was outstanding! It is quite similar to my Mother's potato salad recipe. My mother always "marinated" her potatoes while they cooled with Italian salad dressing...just enough to coat them and add an little extra flavor. It makes a BIG difference. Instead of using red potatos, I used white "Eastern" potatoes, which are pretty much all purpose. They held together perfectly. The key is not to over-cook them. I wouldn't have thought of adding the dill pickles, be we absolutely LOVED it! Even my son raved about it, and he isn't fond of mayonnaise. Going forward, I will only use this recipe for potato salad...it's a definite keeper.

In reponse to the ? below on red potatoes breaking up when mixing... Reds should be quite waxy, unless you got some "lemons" ;-) I suspect that they were probably overcooked for salad purposes. When boiling potatoes for salad, they should only be cooked until JUST fork tender, then immediately pulled from the water and cooled. I would guess about 4 mins less cooking time than for mashed etc. I cant comment on this recipe as I havent tried it yet, but it's almost identical to my standard except that I used green onions (scallions for you folks south of the border) rather than reds and I used fresh-packed full-sour kosher dills instead of spears.... mmmmmmmmmmm

I used small red potatoes and a half light mayo/half light sour cream dressing, with just 1 T. mustard. I added the pickles last and reserved some salad without them.

Try using Yukon Gold Potatoes in this recipe instead of red potatoes--you will find that they do not become as mushy--much better texture

I didn't make this but also chuckled when reading Cash's statement about someone suggesting she "market" this salad. This is about as basic as potato salad gets. Potatoes, eggs, celery, mayo/mustard - not exactly a big secret Roseanne.

I also hate sweet potato salad and I loved this recipe. I added some chopped parsley and sliced green pepper just because I love the freshness of flavor they add.

Rating: 4
Just made this one yesterday. Yummy! I hate sweet-tasting potato salads too and found this one to be right on the mark. It was easier to mix the mayo and mustard with some salt and pepper in a pyrex cup before adding it to the rest of the ingredients. A question about spuds: I bought red skins but they were on the large size. I thought they cooked up fairly starchy and they broke apart when I mixed the salad together. I thought red-skins were waxy and kept their shape?! Do any of you potato scholars out there care to enlighten me?

Rating: 4
Just right! The red skinned potatoes add just enough color to make it a bit different to look at than the usual "yellow" kind.

Rating: 4
This is virtually identical to my own potato salad recipe and I can vouch for the fact it's good. I use yellow mustard because it's more piquant and I make sure I use fresh pack kosher dills because they have a bit of crunch to them. The spears are a somewhat softer but they still impart that dill taste. Anyway, it's a perfect match of ingredients for a non-sweet potato salad (which I hate anyway). Rosanne, been listening to "I Want a Cure" a lot lately. Such an excellent song!

Rating: 4
it is quite interesting that you've use mustard together with the dill pickles, it gives the dish a tangy and unique taste. we could also use a dash of salt and a pinch of sugar to complement the fusion of flavors. its a very good recipe. wow!

Rating: 0
I haven't made this either but in response to the previous poster, when I compared the two recipes, this recipe uses dill pickles instead of sweet; more onion, more celery, more hard boiled eggs, fewer potatoes and does not add buttermilk or sugar. I think this will taste different.

I haven't made this yet so I can't post a review but isn't it almost exactly like the "State Fair Potato Salad" recipe. That was in BA a couple years ago. It looks the same minus the pickle juice??? She says in the magazine a chef told her to market it???
