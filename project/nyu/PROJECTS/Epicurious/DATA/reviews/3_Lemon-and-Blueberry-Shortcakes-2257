my new favorite summer dessert ~ just brought this to a cocktail party and made the shortcakes smaller... they were a big hit! i agree with the review below ~ real cream, real butter, etc... mmmmm

We served this in restaurant and got nothing but rave reviews. I don't recommend cutting any corners--especially on the real cream (no cool whip, please!) It's an excellent alternative to traditional strawberry shortcake. The sweet and sour flavors together are exquisite.

These were absolutely fabulous. And I substituted margarine for butter, milk for cream, and Cool Whip for whipped cream. I almost didn't make the lemon curd but I am glad I did. The lemon and blueberry combination (slightly tart and sweet)is out of this world. There are already requests to make it again. It is going on the top of my "make for company" list.
