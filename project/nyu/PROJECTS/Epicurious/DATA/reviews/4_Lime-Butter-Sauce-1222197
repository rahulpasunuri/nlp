Outstanding sauce that I will use time and time again. The fact that it is so quick and easy is a total bonus! Rave reviews from the dinner party of six w/salmon main course; several said it was the "best fish" they had ever tasted.

I added an extra clove of garlic and about 2 tsp dried cilantro. Also about a tsp of zest. Next time less zest and a pinch of cayenne. I emulsified it with my stick blender, served it over salmon. MY son said it was okay (I agreed). He enjoyed it on his spinach very much.

I use this sauce all the time! We love it on corn open grilled on the bbq. Recently tried brushing it on while grilling asparagus and it was fantastic. It would be delish on green beans or dressing a Nicoise Salad, I bet.

We had this on salmon and it was good-- I was scared so I only had my husband brush it on lightly on half the salmon. It was pretty good though, although I'm not sure I love salmon with that flavor. I did half butter and half olive oil and I liked that combo--any more butter would really make that flavor overpower the rest. The next day flavor was very nice on the leftover salmon. Would probably use again, but maybe on a white fish or shrimp; I think salmon has a better flavor on its own.

Delicious! I used extra garlic but sauteed it in butter to mellow the flavor. I made it a day ahead and liked the consistency better after a night in the fridge. It became a spread instead of a sauce. I put it on grilled salmon and corn on the cob. Everyone loved it so much that they spread the extra on bread.

Wow, this sauce is delicious! I made it for the grilled salmon [we actually used steelhead trout, which is quite similar], and after reading the reviews here I made steamed potatoes and asparagus, figuring those would go well with the sauce...dipped every bite in the limey deliciousness! And super easy. Will definitely be making this again.

As others have mentioned, this is a great sauce. I have made a few adjustments that I think work very well. First, I use half butter and half olive oil. Second, I add lime zest. Third, I add an herb of choice (e.g., Italian parsley, cilantro, tyme) depending on what I am using the sauce for. Fourth, and most significant, I saute a medium shallot (in place of the garlic) in the butter over low heat for about five minutes then add the butter, shallots and olive oil to the blender. This adds a slightly more refined flavor than the garlic, and it prevents the sauce from breaking down when poured over fish, chicken or whatever it is being served with.

I used olive oil instead of butter, as suggested by many. It was so delicious. Even better, it was quick and easy to make. It tasted like summer, even though I heard sleet pelting the kitchen window!

Wonderful sauce with salmon and am sure this would be excellent on so many other fish, and even shrimp or crabcakes! Used a tad bit less lime. Served over a black bean, corn, tomoato & avocado salad (that had lime in it also). So nice for summer. AND SO EASY! Love it.

Fantastic! What a surprise! So easy and so tasty. Even my 4 yr old tasted a tiny bit on her finger. I loved the reaction.. a little pucker, a little smile, a little "ew" - she said it hurts her mouth but she likes it a little bit, too. Translation... tangy, spicy, buttery, delicious! We served it with grilled salmon and steamed asparagus.

I have made this again and again over the last 2 years. Served it with everything, from salmon, to grilled vegetables. It is absolutely excellent on grilled corn, and I've even finished grilled steaks with the sauce. I make a double batch and keet it in my fridge and use it all week. Devine!

I used very good quality olive oil instead of butter and it was absolutely superb. I also mixed in some parsley. Served it over baked salmon and topped with chopped olives. Even my children were begging for more.

My husband has never loved my salmon so much as when I topped it with this lime butter recipe. It was also the easiest prep I have ever done for any type of fish. I just put salt and pepper all over the fillet, cooked it and then poured this yummy goodness over the top before serving. I didn't bother with the food processor... just added all the ingredients to the pot with the melting butter. I also left out the salt and pepper, since the I already seasoned the salmon.

Great with baked salmon, green beans and sweet corn. I'm trying it on chicken next! I made half the amount of sauce, as we only had 2 filets, and there was still sauce left over. I smashed the garlic into a paste with the salt and pepper, whisked it into the lime juice, then whisked that slowly into half-melted butter. No food processor necessary! It stayed emulsified perfectly.

Ultra-easy and can be used on so many things. I added it to grilled salmon this weekend. A basic to pull out any time!

SO EASY AND SO DELICIOUS! This would be great on any number of things. If we have bread with dinner, there will be none left over. It's so good. I could imagine putting this on any veggie I dislike and would end up liking it, just because of this sauce. We keep this in our fridge at all times (unless we're in diet mode). Definately worth trying!

Great sauce, easy to make. I served it on halibut and salmon - outstanding. I used the leftovers on brown rice the next day. I added the zest of one lime and 2-3 tsp of finely chopped cilantro. Tonight will try it on grilled turkey breast.

While I love this recipe, it does get a million times better when you add green onion and thyme after you've made the sauce. I actually like to grill the corn still in its husks and let it sit for 10 min once it's done. Then cut the corn into a bowl and toss with this sauce!

I used this sauce as required in the 'grilled corn with herbs' recipe on this site. I couln't even taste the butter flavor at all and it wasn't worth eating all that fat for no flavor. This sauce didn't work for me, at least not how it was used along with the grilled corn. Perhaps it would be better on something else? I won't be the one trying it again.

Excellent "staple" sauce for fish and chicken. I made a log of it and wrapped it on parchment paper then put it in a freezer bag. Whenever I need to use some of it I just slice off a few discs of it and let it melt over grilled fish or chicken.

This recipe is our all time favorite summer sauce for grilled fish - works great w/salmon, halibut, shrimp... especially good when you place the fish on a bed of cous cous and grilled asparagus then pour the sauce all over everything. The only alteration I usually make is to add about 2 TBS chopped fresh cilantro & a little zest from the lime. Delicious! Equally wonderful for a week night and perfect BBQ party wow.

Fantastic recipe for a beginner like myself. It's quick, easy, uses ingredients already at hand and it's a good recipe to experiment with. For example, I tossed some chunks of fresh pineapple in a food processor and added that to the sauce, which was perfect for the salmon I used it on.

This is simply amazing. It is quick and easy. I didnt make modifications to the recipe itself; however, I had to get creative on creating the sauce. First I didnt have a blender. I was suppose to use my boyfriends, but totally forgot that process while making it. To overcome this, I used half a table spoon, or more, of garlic powder, which I had lying around and basically got it in the form it was suppose to be. Secondly, if you do make it this way, the lime and butter wont seem to mix, however, when you stir it into the corn it will work out all the same. It was rather tasty and I can see applying this directly to the cob itself, however, this was great for mothers day for my grandmother and mother, who have dentures. Simply delicious for such a simple sauce, seriously, it took me, at most, five or six minutes to mix it by hand. Definitely will make this again.

Rating: 4
YEAH!!! Super easy, and looks and tastes fantastic! I originally made this to accompany the grilled salmon recipe on this site, and drizzled it over the fresh corn we had as a side. Ive since made it to go with grilled shrimp and over other veggies. Its a very easy recipe to create variations of: with excellent results Ive substituted the lime juice for lemon, as well as balsamic vinegar. The balsamic isotope was killah when brushed on grilled veggies before & after grilling! I have one of those little immersion hand-blenders and it was perfect for making this sauce. Using it, I didnt even need to bother chopping the garlic cloves.

This is truly a phenomenal sauce that is totally versatile. It literally is 5 minutes to make, but can make a simple item gourmet. I made grilled salmon and asparagus for dinner for my cousin and his family, and the sauce was great over both. Whatever you want to "dress up", this sauce is the trick! Don't change a thing! The sauce is so flavorful, that you can easily halve the recipe, because you need so little to achieve great results.

Delicious! I used a clove of garlic from garlic confit so as not to have the raw garlic taste. Poach 24 peeled garlic cloves in 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil for 45 min. Simmer only, do not boil. Keep in a jar in the fridge. Oil is good for salads too.

Unsalted butter is better quality butter. Salted butter hides impurities and imperfections. That's why you add salt to a recipe that uses unsalted butter.

I added more lime juice (using a total of 2 1/2 limes), used sea salt, added a dash of ground Ancho Chili Pepper, and (for health reasons) substituted 4 Tbl. olive oil for 4 Tbl. of the butter (making it 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil). It turned out great. We used the sauce as suggested, and also as salad dressing. This would probably work on any fish.

I bought salmon not because we like it but because I am trying to serve healthier foods to my family. We all liked this dish, even my picky 7 year old. I served the salmon on top of rice topped with a few young green beans. I drizzled the lime butter sauce over the fish and sprinkled with red pepper flakes to enhance the presentation. It turned out just as good the second time.

I tried it with the egg yolks but that didn't work either. The sauce didn't coagulate and it was too limey, in my opinion. There is a scallops with ginger lime buerre blanc sauce on this site which would work great. Maybe it's the french influence -- just kidding

This is a good, but not a great sauce, It is easy and flavorful, but I wonder if adding egg yolks to the blender before pouring the hot butter in, would create a blender "hollandaise", and a richer, tastier sauce? I think I will try that next time. Another reviewer, on the salmon page of this recipe, added chili powder and cilantro--that sounds tempting too. This definitely has potential and probably, a number of wonderful variations.

I made this sauce using only a half-stick of butter (only two of us). I didn't bother with the blender, but melted the butter in the microwave, and slowly whisked it into a bowl with the garlic, lime juice, salt & pepper. It emulsified just fine. I used a whole garlic clove and a whole lime, so it was probably a bit stronger than the original proportions would give you, but it was great on grilled swordfish.

To Ferndale: use your garlic greens to make a simple pesto (substitute for basil leaves or mix with other herbs). It's a great addition to any sandwich or if you're a real lover, as a pasta sauce of its own. As for this butter sauce, its great on everything.

Nummy! I've used this basic recipe forever, but I never blended it till tonight -- what a great consistency to drizzle over veggies and meat! We also used fresh garlic (not cured, with all the greens still attached) from our organic farm share tonight, as I wasn't sure what else to do with it. Can anyone help? How else do you use REALLY fresh (not the cured bulb that we normally think of as fresh) garlic???
