Very very tasty, indeed. I wanted to try this dish out of curiosity and now I plan to make some tarts as gifts for the holidays! Some notes: As a person new to caramelizing sugar, I was shocked at how quickly the pretty amber color described in the recipie can turn into black tar. It took me two tries before I got it right. If you are new caramel, err on the side of too light of an amber color. I did that the third time and the tart was very tasty. Once the sugar burns you can't go back, and it smells! Second: My puff pastry was perfect because I rolled it and froze it the night before. When it came time to assemble, I let the pomegranate mixture cool as instructed, and put the pastry from the freezer to the oven as fast as possible. I was very happy with the result.

Unusual, easy, and delicious. I found the crust to be very flaky ...not chewy at all! I rolled it very thin and froze it solid before baking. I put a soft whipped cream dollop on the top so the pomegranate seeds would show off. Good even a few days later!

Good and different, but I'd change the crust--the puff pastry with this recipe was rather chewy. Something flakier, or perhaps nutty. My guests enjoyed the novelty, but I don't know that I'd repeat it.
