Super quick and easy to make, and I thought they were wonderful. On the advice of other reviewers I sliced them thin and think this was a good way to go. They made a very nice addition to a cocktail party in place of traditional boring store- bought crackers. Guests either loved them or 'didn't get them' -- some expected them to be cookies by the looks of them, and thus were surprised. I will note that they are nothing special to look at, particularly since the shape of the 'squared off log' I made was less than geometric perfection.

Excellent! I took a few of the suggestions in the other reviews and used three teaspoons of lemon juice as opposed to just one and then omitted the 2 teaspoons of water. Since I like Pecorino Romano better than Parmesan, I used that instead. I set the time for 7 minutes instead of 10 and watched until the edges were slightly golden. They were PERFECT. I would absolutely make these again.

i cut and rolled them into thin rounds, taking the advice of topping with a bit of salt and pepper. i think i also added more pepper than the recipe called for. i think they are delightful, though i think i will up the ratio of lemon juice to water next time as well. or maybe mix a few peppers in. or both!

These came out really nice. Instead of cutting them I rolled them out on a floured surface to ensure a very thin cracker. I also added poppy seeds and sea salt to the top before baking.

I found these crackers to be very ordinary. The dough was very dry and crumbly, making it difficult to slice. I agree with previous reviewers and would have preferred thinnner, crisper crackers, but the dough didn't hold together to allow for thinner slices.

Definitely easy and I didn't have a pastry blender. Would consider using less flour and more cheese and baking longer for a crunchier cracker. Will definitely make again!

These were a big hit at my Christmas party. Though everyone else seemed to like them more than I did. The smell out of the oven sure was great, and they were easy to prepare ahead and bake at the last minute!

Uh, yum. These are a fantastic make-ahead hors d'oeuvre that I will make again and again. I've often made another excellent recipe from this site (Jo's Cheese Wafers), but I wanted something a little lighter and these were outstanding. I added a bit more lemon juice, but otherwise stuck close to the recipe. I agree that thinner is better - I (somehow) cut exactly 44 crackers, but preferred the thinner ones.

These were absolutely delicious! I will definitely make them again and again. The second time I made them, I sliced them thinner, so that they became crisper when baked. I thought they were better this way. A big hit with everyone at cocktail time!

The crackers just came out of the oven. It's all I can do not to eat them all before my company comes. For the other Washington, DC cook -- if you left out the lemon and the pepper, you didn't make this recipe. For the cook in Baltimore -- some crackers are meant to eat by themselves.

I made this with a firm, sharp organic cheddar cheese (organic cheeses tend to be firmer and less oily, You can also 'dry out' an ordinary cheese by leaving it un-wrapped in the fridge for a couple of days) instead of parmesan. Omitted the lemon zest and pepper. Turned out great. Be careful not to over cook. Lining baking sheet with parchment paper keeps the cracker from getting too oily. Nice as a crouton on ceasar salad, seafood pates or just by themselves.

I enjoyed the flavor of these crackers so much that when the second sheet went into the oven, I made a second batch of dough. The dough is easy to handle, and I love the make-ahead simplicity. I served this as one of the savories at a ladies tea I hosted, and they were a huge hit. I would caution you to watch them carefully, because they are not as tasty when they are browned all over.

This is a good dough and you can customize it really easily. I omitted the lemon-pepper angle, mixing in some asiago cheese with the parmesan and used it as a canape, topping it with chipotle-seared chicken and diced apples. This is good cracker standby. Be careful not to go too thick as they get harder the longer they cool.

Not exactly the cracker recipe of my dreams, but interesting nonetheless. It was easy to prepare, probably freezes well, and didn't taste bad, but I'm perplexed as to how one would serve this cracker. It doesn't seem like it would be good topped with caviar, peanut butter, jam or tapenade. That leaves cheese. I'm not sure if I would serve cheese on cheese. Maybe it could be offered plain, like pretzels.

I make these frequently and they're always a hit. The dough is very easy to work with.

These are very flavorful and delicious. I do a New Year's Day brunch for about 75 people, so I made a few logs a few weeks ahead of time and froze them. I baked them the day before and they were still great, but I couldn't resist eating a few right after the "cool down" time. Great!

When I make these I always make a double recipe and freeze half in "logs". They are ready to slice and bake for guests at any time.

I have made these crackers many times since the recipe was printed in 1993. I was glad to see it on the Internet for an opportunity to review it for other readers. This is one of my favorite snacks that can be served equally well with champagne or beer.
