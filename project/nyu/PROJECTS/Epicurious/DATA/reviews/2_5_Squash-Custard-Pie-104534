This pie was an excellent alternative to the usual dense squash or pumpkin pie you might expect at thanksgiving. It is light and has a creamy custard taste that complements, not masks, the sweetness of winter squash. That said, this recipe needed some adjustments. I used 2 cups of butternut squash purée, 1 cup of brown sugar (just to keep it simple) and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream as substitutes. However I couldn't fit all of the filling in the pie shell, so maybe I will use less squash and cream next time. I really like this recipe as a base and look forward to playing around with the spices to make it my own. I plan to make this pie with pumpkin for thanksgiving. It was just light and sweet enough to impress the squash haters in my family.

I wonder if the recipe is incorrect and should read 1 3/4 cup squash puree? It would seem pumpkin pie should have similar proportions, and most pumpkin pies call for nearly equal amounts of puree vs. liquid, while this one is calling for half the amount of puree vs. liquid.

This recipe turned out way to liquidy. Either it needs to stay in the oven a LOT longer (in which case the pie curst will definitely burn), or it needs a LOT less milk. I may try it again but put way less milk and add cornstarch to the milk so that it is a thicker consistency. The overall flavor was good, but serving a soupy pie is not pleasant.
