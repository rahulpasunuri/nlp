Followed all suggestions - added 1/4 cup brown sugar, caraway seeds, 1 cup apple cider, 2 apples. Used Pederson's Kielbasa and McSorley's Irish Black Lager. First meal of 2012 pretty tasty. Also had some salted rye bread to sop up the juices. Off to a good culinary start. Did not rinse kraut and cooked for 5 hours in slow cooker. Cooked Kielbasa with sliced shallot in non stick skillet, a little oil and added a bit Yuengling Lager, before adding to kraut mix. Cooked a pork loin roast separately in the oven, and sliced and added to the pot the last 15 minutes. Next time would skip the roast and add more sausages, maybe Mets, and or Brats. edit this note : Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Beer-Braised-Sausages-and-Sauerkraut-11382#ixzz1iG7hwyvX

Very good! I took the advice of other reviewers -- did not rinse the sauerkraut and added a little brown sugar. Made it in a slowcooker (low for 5 hours) and it came out really well...

It is definitely the BEER (lauger) that makes this recipe. This is not the place to skimp! In WNC I don't have the choices of products large cities offer, so I used 3 2-lb pkgs of Hebrew Nat. fresh sauerkraut and a variety of brat types for 2/person. My original dinner was for 7, had enough left over (added more brats each time) for 4 left over servings and still threw some kraut out. For my Oktoberfest dinner, we made the homemade pretzels, this brat dish, sweetnsour green beans, German potato salad with dill, and Stout cake. We got nothing but raves!!!!

I love this dish! I used 6 lbs of unrinsed sauerkraut, polish kielbasa and Leinenkugel Octoberfest beer. I didn't have enough room in my pan to increase the amount of meat but more would have been better. I also added 1/3 cup brown sugar, caraway seeds, 1 cup apple cider and northern spy apples. The apples and cider really add a nice tanginess to the dish. Note if you add the apples more than 1 hour before the sauerkraut is done cooking they will disintegrate.

Completely underwhelmed by this dish. I'd read all of the comments and modified the dish as suggested, but still underwhelming. This dish uses a lot of energy - 4 hours in the oven! Not worth the time, energy or good beer.

I bought all the meat and sour kraut from the Schaller and Weber store in Manhattan. Having read the warnings about bitter kraut, I took A Cook from NYC's advise and used Brooklyn Lager as my beer. I also decided to braise the kraut for 6 hours instead of 4, as A Cook from NYC does. I tasted it after every hour of cooking, and at hour 3 I added a few tablespoons of brown sugar. The kraut wasn't really that good until hour 5 when bacon flavor seemed to have finally infused into the sour kraut. It wasn't bitter at all however. Everyone at the party loved the sour kraut, but if I were to do it again, I would have done the rising step at the beginning. I like my sour kraut a tad less sour. Overall, a very good recipe, but the 6 hour cook time seems essential to its success.

I used this recipe mainly for cooking the sauerkraut. I used my own recipe for grilling beer-bratwursts. I used high quality sauerkraut (Boar's Head), and I used a good, dark beer (Beck's, Oktoberfest Lager). It is not a very hoppy beer, so I wasn't expecting any of the problems with bitterness that earlier reviewers mentioned. However, when I tasted the sauerkraut after 3 hours of braising, the kraut was extremely bitter. Not unpalatable, but not very pleasant. To try and cut some of the bitterness, I added a few tablespoons of sugar, and continued to braise for another hour. This definitely helped. The kraut came out with a nice caramel flavor, but was still quite bitter - for my tastes. So, if you like your kraut bitter, this is the recipe for you. After cooking there is very little tartness left in the kraut, and I found it to be far too bitter for myself (and my guests felt the same).

Deeeee-licious. I added 1/4 a cup of brown sugar to it as suggested in the other comments.

Made this for Oktoberfest party and it was a big success. I used 1lb of smoked bacon on advice of my butcher, quick rinse of sauerkraut, and added sugar as suggested previously.

what I disn't see in any other suggestion is when you add bacon and caraway to saurkraut also add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of brown sugar depending on the amount of kraut you are cooking...will definitely add a good caramel flavor to the dish.

I have made this many times (and am doing so again today). I make it in a crock pot, on low for 6 hrs. The beer is key. I use a dark lager--Brooklyn Lager usually, but might try a Stout to see how/if its subtly sweeter taste complements that of the cabbage. The suggestions to not rinse the kraut are noteworthy. Almost any German or Polish sausage works well here.

I have made this several times -- I don't follow the recipe but rather the method/ratio of ingredients (I am only cooking for two, so making 9 cups of sauerkraut is a little much). As others have mentioned, the beer choice is key - anything hoppy or bitter will result in a very bitter-tasting kraut. I've had the best luck with lighter beers (like Beck's), but there is still a slight bitterness no matter what I do. I also add caraway seed and juniper berries when braising the kraut. I'm not a huge fan of this type of dish, but my husband loves it. I also do not rinse the kraut. Pay close attention to the timing when you put the sausages in -- if you use whole sausages and cook them too long, they can split.

This recipe is awesome! I used a little more sausage and a little less kraut...as per comments. I also did not rinse the kraut. As for beer, Becks Dark has been the beer of choice for the last two Oktoberfests. Also, when I cook the sausage, EASH batch gets cooked in 12 oz of the Becks + 1 onion. My husband and I never have leftovers from this....and we use 10lbs of different sausages!! Thanks for a great recipe and the great tips!

Great flavor! Used only about 1/2 of the sauerkraut and beer because I was only making for myself and husband. Did not rinse the sauerkraut, but did drain it. Used Sam Adams Octoberfest beer. Flavor was wonderful. Will make again!

Use beer (the recipe is correct in calling for a lager) and sausages with tastes you like. Non-smoked Kielbasa is superb in this dish.

After buying all of the ingredients and spending a small fortune I was excited about this fall dish. After preparing and cooking the sauerkraut I ended up with a very bitter tasting dish. I used the suggested beer, to be on the safe side, and found that everything was ruined. (I believe it was the beer) I ended up adding brown sugar and placed under the broiler for a couple of minutes. This took away the very bitter edge and after eating the kraut the bitter taste remained. I'm giving it one fork because the sausages were so good and thats because they were purchased from a German pork store! Next time I'll just make the sauerkraut the way I make it, which is without beer.

I made this again for our annual Oktoberfest. This time I made the sausages and kraut together and used Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer. I made it earlier in the month and froze it. This really is an amazing recipe. EVERYONE loves it! It's easy and well worth any effort you have to put out. After defrosting, I braised it in the oven until it was hot enough to go in the sterno pans. My house smelt awesome! I thought I might have to add additional beer, but I didn't and the liquid did boil down some. Give this one a try!!

Made this dish for an office party, using a crock pot. Definitely do not rinse the kraut, and perhaps halve the amount. It makes A LOT of sauerkraut. Used an assortment of Polish sausages, and brats from a local butcher. Reduced the volume of liquid/kraut/vegetable mixture by about half before putting it into the crock pot, then, let it go on low for about 5 hours. Got great reviews!

My decision to make this recipe was spontaneous, so I used regular sliced bacon, and whatever sausages I could find at the store (Bratwurst, fat-free Turkey, Kiebasa). I followed the guidelines of the other reviewers (example: don't rinse the sauerkraut)....and had yummy results. Two out of my six guests asked for the recipe. NOTE: Pick the beer carefully, there was a slight "edge" to the dish that would have been better if I had purchased a high-quality lager. Do not use Spaten Beer. A nice drink to serve with this meal is Woodchuck's Hard Cider made from Granny Smith apples.

I only used the 4 wursts mentioned in the recipe in addition to the slab bacon & pork loin. I also doubled the amount of wursts. If you don't there will definately be too much kraut. I also only drained the sauerkraut and did not soak it. I followed the rest of the recipe up until the end. My Mom makes a great pork and sauerkraut dish and I guess I expected more from the sauerkraut in this dish. There was quite a bit of liquid left and it needed more flavor. I removed all the wursts, uncovered the pan and broiled the sauerkraut. I stirred it periodically (as it was browning) and broiled it until all the liquid was gone. This lets the sauerkraut truly brown and pick up a more intense flavor. If you are game...try doing it with a portion of the sauerkraut. You can see if you like the difference in flavor. It does lose that beer flavor once it is broiled. You can mix it in with the rest of the kraut to add flavor or broil it all. Make sure you try this with some interesting mustard blends. We all favored a sweet grain mustard with it.

I doubled and browned the sausages which worked out well. The boneless pork loin is fantastic for breakfast the next morning. A guest of mine who confessed to not liking sauerkraut went back for seconds, must have been the beer. I agree with the other review, DON'T rinse the Kraut.

This is a great recipe for enjoying sauerkraut as it was meant to be (carmely-brown and delicious) as long as you don't rinse the kraut (or, at least, rinse less than as per the recipe). Otherwise the recipe yields a more washed out-flavorless cabbage. I made this with Kielbasa and it was great. I also doubled the quantity of sausage and the recipe adapted easily. In fact, I think there would, otherwise, have been a disporportionate amount of kraut. This is definately a fall or cold-weather dish.
