These turned out great! Most of them broke apart, but it left me with lots of unique half curls and different shapes. If you are expecting perfect Shirley Temple curls, then you may be disappointed, but if you want a colorful sweet garnish, they do the trick. I will say the cooking time is a little too long, 20 minutes is plenty, and try and work with them quickly while they are still very warm.

I gave a two-fork review because I needed to modify the baking time dramatically. But, the curls came out fine in the end -- very pretty bright orange, unusual decoration. You have to make the strips not too thick (or they don't dry) and not too thin (or they fall apart). Mine only needed 20 mins in the oven to dry in strips, and then another 20 mins after curling to dry them the rest of the way. When you wrap the strips around the spoon handle to curl them, put the drier side next to the spoon. That way they hold the curl better and it's easier to slide them off the handle.

I made these to top a beautiful carrot cake and had two significant problems - first, the strips were so delicate once they came out of the syrup that they fell apart when trying to arrange on the baking sheet. Second, (and even more frustrating) after putting in so much time, after they came out of the oven the strips were so crisp and dry that they couldn't curl - just snap. Maybe baking time should be reduced to 20 mins.? The entire batch was a waste.

definitely worth the effort, I got a lot of compliments on this garnish!
