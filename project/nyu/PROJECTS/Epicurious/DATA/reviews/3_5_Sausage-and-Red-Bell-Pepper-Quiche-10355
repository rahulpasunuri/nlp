This recipe is easy and delicious. I had some sausage left over from grilling and used that along with some mushrooms. Gave the mushrooms a quick saute with some onion. I stuck with the egg/liquid amounts but used half and half instead of the heavy cream. It was plenty rich and had a wonderful texture.

Been serving this at brunches for years. A bold quiche that is a very big hit with the gents, who usually avoid quiche - so good it definitely encourages seconds.

I have never made quiche before and was nervous about the way it would turn out. I hate quiche that is too watery or eggy. This came out just perfectly! I didn't have time to make my own crust so I used a store bought crust (Trader Joe's). I pressed it into a 10 inch tart pan with a removable bottom. I didn't have bell peppers so used mushrooms instead. I followed the custard part exactly. The custard was just the right amount to fill up the tart pan. It was so delicious everyone asked for seconds. I am definitely making it again! I never knew quiche was so easy!

I made this for brunch--it was a hit. I used a prepared pie crust, but followed the rest of the recipe as listed. It fed the 4 of us, but no leftovers. I would definitely make it again.

I love this recipe--It's so changeable! I used chicken sausage, skim milk and yogurt (sometimes sour cream), added different veggies, different spices. I like the option to play and it always turns out well.

Made with vegetarian sausage and was delicious.

This was very tasty. Wanting to cut down on the fat in this recipe, I added a chopped ham steak in place of the sausage. I also added 1/2 red onion, and used orange bell peppers instead of red (the store was out of them). I also added 2 chopped green onions, 8 cloves of garlic (and it turned out surprisingly un-garlicky; just right), along with a 1/2 tsp each of marjoram, sage, and thyme. Also added 4 chopped sun-dried tomatoes. As another reviewer mentioned, it still was a bit pizza-esque, but somehow overall it still reminded me of a savory breakfast/brunch dish.

Made this tonight - very good! Used others suggestions and increased eggs to 4 and added more cheese. I used a mix of sharp and regular cheddar - also used 1 red and 1 green bell pepper as well as a premade (Pillsbury) crust. Was very easy and very yummy! I think I will try another suggestion of adding garlic and onion (and maybe the sundried tomatoes) next time just to add some more flavors. Hubby and son loved it and ate it all up! Will definitely make again!

i changed this recipe significantly. i doubled the eggs and milk and made 2 quiches. i sauteed a red onion and some garlic before adding the sausage and peppers, then i also added broccoli rabe. i used yogurt instead of cream and goat cheese instead of cheddar. it was delicious and cooked quickly. but the recipe as stands is kind of boring.

Added an extra egg, milk, and cheese. Baked in 2 deep dish frozen pie crusts! YUM!!!

This is really quick and easy to prepare, even the crust, and tastes very good. I took the advice of other cooks: used 1 large red bell, one full pound of sausage, and doubled the eggs, cheese & crust to make a larger quiche. I pressed the crust into the bottom of a 9x13 pan, and increased the total baking time by 15 minutes. I will definitely make again, next time with a different kind of sausage (spinach & feta?), cheese (perhaps mozzarella) and add green onions. I think this dish will only get better with creative substitutions like that.

This has become my husband's standard brunch before we go to an afternoon baseball game. He loves to prep it himself. We use frozen pie crusts (and it ends up taking two of them).

I was really disappointed in this recipe -- after reading the reviews, I thought it would be fabulous. It was just ok. The main problem for me was it was too pizza-like; sausage and peppers go great with pizza but they are not quiche filling. I'll stick with classics like Quiche Lorraine.

Made this last night and it turned out very good. Used a 9" frozen deep dish pie crust. Used reviewers' suggestions and doubled the cheeses and eggs. Also increased the sausage to 1 lb., and added 2 thinly sliced green onions to the sausage/pepper mixture. The whole thing barely fit into the pie crust. It also took about 45 minutes in the oven. Next time I would decrease the sausage a bit. It also turned out a bit juicy, perhaps because I used half & half and 2% milk instead of what was originally required. All in all, a very easy and substantial recipe that serves 4 as an entree. It is filling.

I modified this slightly, making it Vegetarian, by using Veggie-Sausage (I like the Yves brand products... and no, I do not work for them), which I cut into small pieces, and my husband (he's the Vegetarian in the family) just loves it! We each take half the quiche, with a side of salad, and it's a very filling meal. And if I'm in a big hurry, I use a frozen pie crust and it's just as good. Thanks again!

I've made this quiche a number of times to rave reviews. I modify it: 5 eggs, 1/3 cup cream, no milk, 1 large RBP. Make sure you use good parmesan (do not use canned or pre-shredded varieties) and good sausage. The crust has always shrunk for me. Hasn't mattered in the end (I just let the egg mixture run over and it tastes and looks fine), but I'm still trying to overcome that problem.

I usually see what other people think and was excited to see everyone would make it again. I found it bland and uninteresting. I ended up tossing most of it in the garbage.

Everyone loved this dish. I changed the recipe to make a standard-sized quiche for a standard pie pan by doubling the eggs and cheese. I took the suggestions of other cooks that reviewed it and added sun-dried tomatoes, substituted whole milk for cream, and used only one red bell pepper. I also substituted Bob Evans breakfast sausage (about 7 links) in place of sweet Italian sausage, used a fold-out pre-made pie shell, and cooked for 10 additional minutes at 350 degrees.

Doubled the eggs, and used some specialty sausage this time - chicken/turkey with artichoke and sundried tomatoes. Second time making it, and I find using some snazzy sausage can make the difference. This time I'm substituting 2% milk instead of heavy cream. Definitely a keeper recipe!

Wonderful recipe! Am planning on making it tomorrow for Grandmother's visit. Last time also added potatoes (diced and warmed by the microwave) to the sausage and red pepper stir fry. YUM!

This was okay, but I have to admit I was a bit let down, given many of the reviews. It is a perfectly servicable dish, and the tasters in my house decided that it seemed like a cross between pizza and quiche. It's easy and inexpensive, fine for a simple dinner or brunch on a rainy Sunday, but I wouldn't use it for a special occasion. There are much better recipes for such meals at this site, in my view.

This was a wonderful dish. I also doubled the egg amount and reduced the red pepper to one. My family said it was the best quiche dish they ever tasted.

We loved this recipe! I added some dried chilies to spice it up a bit. We got through half of it and I served the rest for brunch the next day with a piece of grilled top sirloin. I'm keeping this one on my list of favorites.

I doubled the egg amount and only used 1 very large red pepper. Guests raved and it was easy to make, since i prebaked the crust the night before. I don't even like eggs, and i love this recipe!

Crust was really good, but didn't have enough to fully spread in the quiche pan without leaving holes... next time I'd double the crust - so yummy you'd want more anyway.

Egg-cellent recipie! Quick and easy to make. I used this for making petite Hors d'Oeuvres, each in a small tart shell, garnished with a sprig of parsley. They were so good my wife wouldn't share hers with me!

This was my first quiche, and it came out perfectly! My friend had fourths (as opposed to seconds or thirds, lol). I'm a vegetarian and subsituted vegetarian sausage (for all you skeptics - it tastes the same - even my meat-eating dad raved about it), and it was delicious! Great recipe!

made this for a farewell brunch and guests raved about it...did make some minor changes - used phyllo rather than pastry and added 1/4 minced onion and used mixture of red, yellow & orange bell peppers...will try jalepeno's next time...simple yet delicious recipe...

This was great and everyone loved it. But I just have to say, regarding previous reviews, that using low fat cheddar in this dish (the mere 1/4 cup of it that there is) is like ordering a diet coke to go with your Big Mac and supersize fries. Nice try, but lets not kid ourselves...

First time every trying quiche and I enjoyed it very much. Even my husband liked it. The crust didn't come out well for me, but I have never made a good crust. I added some spinach to the dish as well and cut back a little on the sausage. Will make again.

I prepared this recipe and several other quiches for a baby shower, and it was the clear favorite among my guests. I modified the recipe by using a refrigerated pie crust in a 9" pie pan, a full pound of hot Italian sausage, and one additional egg. Definitely a caloric splurge, but worth it for special occasions...

My family thought this was really good. I used the frozen pie crust, which saved alot of time. Quick and good, what else can you ask for?

Definitely a winner for Christmas morning! I agree with the low-fat cheese (I use half low fat and half fat-full) but while many quiche recipes call for milk instead of cream, I think the heavy cream really makes the dish. Sometimes you just have to take the calorie hit. Overall the flavors worked really well together, and it made a super brunch!

This has become one of my favorite brunch recipes. It is simple and loved by all! I used a ready-made pie crust (Pillsbury is best; Oronoque is second choice) and left out the parmesan. I made a second recipe, substituting artichoke hearts for the sausage and mozzarella for the cheddar -- was also great! I always use low-fat cheese; there's alreay enough fat in the sausage and cholesterol in the eggs. This goes well with the Hash Brown Brunch Casserole and freshly-baked bread.
