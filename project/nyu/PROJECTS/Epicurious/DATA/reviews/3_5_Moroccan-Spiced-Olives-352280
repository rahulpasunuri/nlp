This was lovely and pleasantly spicy olive - served with cocktails and made as directed. Purchased a jar of Harissa at Crate & Barrel and later found recipe on this site to make my own.

An excellent addition to cocktails on the terrace.

These are delicious! I'd given them 3 1/2 forks if I could, but not sure they quite made the 4 fork mark. But this is a yummy recipe and definitely a keeper at our house.

These olives were a big hit at our passover seder. My 12 year old daughter (who loves olives) helped make them. We will definitely make them again. We made them as directed.

This recipe is very similar to my mother-in-law's who was Moroccan and an excellent cook. I added a little spice to it. You can either use Cayenne Pepper or other chili to taste. Also, I used green, pitted olives which made it easier for my guests to enjoy and a slice of lemon per serving that I added at the very end to prevent the lemon from getting bitter.
