Yummy and easy. We used grilled fresh corn and chicken andouille, and in addition to the other ingredients, added red bell pepper.

I used this recipe to introduce andouille to my family, and they really liked it. Nice spicy dish, but not overly so - my 10 year old loved it. I used garbanzo beans instead of lima because that's what I had on hand - it worked well.

Good for weekday supper, but probably not something I'd serve to company. Still, anything that gets my 6 year old to eat baby lima beans, has got a place in my rotation. For the adults, serving some hot yellow pepper rings on top was a big hit.

It's easy enough to make over a campfire (which I have done twice) and special enough to serve for Thanksgiving (which I will do this week). Can skip the andouile for a vegetarian option.

So quick and easy! Literally 30 minutes cutting board to table. I went to a creole themed dinner party and brought this dish, needless to say it was everyone's favorite!

I had andouille sausage in the fridge and was looking for a quick recipe to make with it. This was it! I used frozen corn, frozen soycutash mix from Trader Joes, 1 white onion and a can of diced tomatoes and green chilies. I didn't have the other fresh ingredients this recipe called for and it was still delicious. Spicy!

A quick and tasty weekday dish. Get the best quality andouille and ingredients that you can - it does make a difference.

This recipe is easy to follow and the succotash is pretty darn good. My husband and I have made it a few times, now, as it makes an easy, one-dish supper--perfect for week nights. I do think the butter beans take a little longer to cook than is indicated here, so I boil them for a few minutes before adding them.
