Made the suggested tweaks & one of my own came out with a spicy double chocolate chip cookie: left out the baking powder, doubled the cinnamon, doubled the pepper (and made it cayenne), then sifted 1/2 cup of Dagoba Xocolatl drinking chocolate powder into the mix. Otherwise followed recipe exactly, including cooling the batter in the fridge for an hour. Delicious chocolate chocolate chip cookies with a kick. Maybe I'll throw in some dried currants next time.

Yes, these are great but you need to do what the others suggested: double the cinnamon, double the spice (I used 1/4 t. cayenne, and 1/4 t. New Mexico Red Chile powder, instead of black pepper), omit the baking powder. And don't skip refridgerating the dough. These cookies are so worth it!

It was good though the seasonings are not all there. It seems to lack on the flavor. Also the dough is like a cake. I dont think these are good for cookies but for cupcakes yes, after tweaking the seasonings.

This is a great addition to my chocolate cookie recipe collection. I doubled the cinnamon and the pepper. I couldn't find Mexican chocolate, so I used dark chocolate chips and added 1 cup of chopped pecans. Then for extra flavor, I added 1/2 teaspoon dried chipotle peppers that my husband and I bought at a little country grocery store while traveling in New Mexico last year. Wow! The flavor was was very rich and complex. I definitely will make these great cookies again!

I made these cookies with the suggestions of others and they came out great. I used 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. I already had milk chocolate chips so I used them. I used one wheel of the Abuelita Mexican chocolate and used a meat mallet to break it up in a plastic bag. It pretty much made it into a powder, not chunks, but since I added the chocolate chips it was fine. It's that distinct flavor you want in the cookie and you have the other chips anyway. Another tip I would suggest is to line your baking sheets with parchment paper. You don't need to worry about buttering the sheets. Much easier for clean up. My batch made 34 cookies. I put 6 on each sheet because they do spread out quite a bit. I put two sheets in at once and baked them for 12 minutes. They came out soft which is how I like my cookies. I really liked these cookies because of the spicy flavor. I will make them again.

Used Mexican chocolate per original recipe author's instructions. These make far more than 30 cookies. I preferred the crispier batch (12 min) but not enough to make this again. The kids won't eat them and even the adults passed on them. It's is hard to get used to the grainy texture of the Abuelita chocolate. Maybe Ibarra would have been better.

Oh ya and cinnamon for sure.

Ok, seriously these are awesome. I made them many times and they are perfect every time. I think I use cold butter, but the key to not being cakey is not cooking them for 10 min. Try 8 instead. They will be nice and gooey. Oh and the cayenne is the key.

I followed the advice of some of the reviewers on here and put half Ibarra chocolate and half chocolate chips. I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and quadrupled the amount of pepper. They're great! A big hit.

You really do need the Ibarra Mexican chocolate to make this recipe, or else the cookies don't have that cinnamony-sweet kick to it. It would be like using plain gravy to make an Indian curry dish. I hope the site administrator makes this correction.

Love them! family and friends really enjoyed these cookies! and asked for more, I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and I also put the Ibarra chocolate into plastic bag and hammered away (no big deal), I also added 2 tsps. of cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp. of cayenne. I will be making these cookies again and again!

Rating: 4
High rating due to fact that by using tips from other reviewers I was able to drastically improve recipe. 1st time around I made as per directions with double black pepper, double cinnamon and some cayenne. Cookies are way too cakey. I've since used melted butter, avoided the baking powder and mixed by hand. They are so much more enjoyable and gooey. Next time I will be adding a dash of minced jalepenos. All in all a fun recipe.

I sent this recipe in to Bon Appétit, and unfortunately, when they published it they changed the thing that really made them Mexican chocolate chip cookies, by calling for chocolate chips instead of chopped Mexican chocolate (like Ibarra or Abuelita brands). If you can find Mexican chocolate (which has cinnamon in it and a distinctive, grainy texture), I recommend using it instead of chocolate chips. You must chop it by hand, not in a food processor, which isn't particularly easy (I recommend using a sharp chef's knife), but it's well worth it for the distinctive taste.

I agree that tweaking is important. I added 1/4 teasp of cayenne and some extra cinnamon. Also I dropped the baking powder in response to the "cakiness" critique. They were still a little cakey, i suppose, but not excessively, and they were soft and a little crisp on the outside. With the extra spices that are really tasty, and a little different in a good way.

The only way I would make these again is by following the suggestions of the other reviews. They were not bad cookies they just tasted 'regular' and I was hoping for some Mexican zip. Cayenne would of helped. Tweeking is in order for these. Good luck!

Rating: 2
Tooo cake-y! and I just creamed the butter and sugar together, didn't "beat till light and fluffy". the flavor was ok, but more a hint of cinnamon. should've listen to the other reviews and added more spice and some cayenne for more zip. I think next time I'll just take a plain (noncakey) recipe and add the spices.

These Mexican Chocolate Chip Cookies were to die for! I made them along with regular chocolate chip cookies and the Mexican kind disappeared days before the regualar did. I would recommend this recipe to anyone! WONDERFUL COOKIES!

With a little tweaking, this is a terrific recipe! I made this for a Mexican-themed Sunday brunch and they were a huge hit! I took the advice of some other reviewers and added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper along with the black pepper called for in the recipe. I mixed Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate chips, Hershey's Cinnamon chips and one wheel of Ibarra Mexican chocolate chunked-up using a ziplock bag and a mallet. Since I don't like cakey cookies, I took one reviewer suggestion and creamed the sugar and butter lightly (not until fluffy as recipe indicates). I also did not let the butter go to room tempeture and cut in in with the sugar while it was still hard. This tip is great if you don't like cakey cookies. Definitely try this, it's worth the extra trouble.

Well, I forgot to refrigerate the dough, so that may have been the problem, but these cookies crumbled and were greasy. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 doubled the spices and still could not taste them. I miiight try this again, but doubtful.

These are the best cookies i have ever had, i put a little less sugar in them and a little more spices. I Tried different types of chocolate in this recipe also, the dark chocolate mixed with a little white chocolate were the winners at my house. Super easy to make and the dough freezes great!

Great cookies! I used Ibarra mexican chocolate chopped as suggested by other reviews. I also reduced the butter by 1/2 cup. The hard part was getting the chocolate broken up! Nice taste!!

Why not just use real Mexican Chocolate chopped up? Seems that it would be a more authentic flavor.

I don't normally do this, but I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers who said this recipie is really nothing special. I added the extra cinnamon and cayenne but it just didn't come together into something different like I'd hoped - just tasted like plain chocolate chip cookies with a little cinnamon and pepper in them, which, while certainly not terrible, isn't worth getting excited about, either.

I made these to take on a weekend trip. I thought they were a little dry and cakey when I first took them out of the oven but after being in a sealed plastic bag for a day they were delicious. Everyone raved and asked for my recipe. I increased the cinnamon and pepper.

These are basically a chocolate chip cookie with a hint of cinnamon, and I didn't taste the pepper at all. They are good, but nothing special. In response to the cook from San Francisco: I have found that cookies will become more "cake-like" when the butter is very soft and and is creamed with the sugar "until fluffy" (as in this recipe). For crisper cookies, I use butter that is a little harder/colder and mix it with the sugar by hand, or with a KitchenAid mixer until just barely blended together. The more you "whip" the sugar/butter mixture, the cakier they become. I have no idea what the science is behind this process, but I never cream together sugar and butter and have always been pleased by the results. I hope this helps!

These were OK but not different enough from regular chocolate chip cookies to bother with. They were a little cakey.

These were delicious cookies! I happened to have Ibarra chocolate on hand and used that, along with some semi-sweet chocolate chips. Instead of cinnamon, I used some pumpkin-pie spice, and used garlic pepper. Strange as it sounds, they turned out terrific! Everyone who tried them said they were delicious!!!

Nothing too sensational about this recipe. Thought it was just like regular chocolate chip cookies. I would kick up the spices to give it some umph.

I made these cookies last night and they are great. I didn't have any brown sugar so I used plain white with about 2 tablespoons dark corn syrup (don't know why, for color I guess). I used the full amount of baking powder but half of the baking soda, so they were not flat, but not cake-like, as some reviewers noted their batches turned out. I used all Ibarra chocolate (which is a pain to chop!) in the recipe and studded the tops with a few regular chips before baking. I actually think they would have been better with half Ibarra half regular chips since the authentic taste really comes out with the Ibarra chocolate, but it doesn't have the creaminess of regular chocolate chips. Overall, a great cookie. Oh, I also didn't refrigerate the dough since it was late and I don't think it made a difference.

I really liked these cookies- they have a great flavor and are a nice change from the basic recipe. However, they are more cake-like. I do prefer crisper cookies. Any tips on how I could alter this recipe to come up with a crisper version. Does the lack of white sugar make a difference? Or the amount of baking powder or soda? Thanks in advance for help anyone can give.

This is my new chocolate chip cookie recipe. We thought they were wonderful! I liked the added spices added extra flavor (I added some fresh -ground nutmeg in addition to the other spices). I also liked the texture of these cookies, nice and thick, they had some substance. We also prefer softer cookies to crisp cookies at this house.

YUM!! I made them with a combination of semi-sweet chocolate chips and Ibarra Mexican chocolate. I put the Ibarra into a plastic bag and hammered away with a meat mallet -- much easier than chopping with a knife.

Rating: 4
WOW! What a kick! I used two teaspoons of cinnamon and ¼ tsp of cayenne pepper, as well as a few grinds of black pepper. I used Ghiardeli Double Chocolate baking chips as they were on hand. I cannot believe how delicious these turned out. They were a bit on the puffy side, so next time, I think I'll reduce the amount of baking powder and soda. Do try this recipe; it's chocolate for grown-ups!

I made these for a small dinner party, and they were a big hit! I substituted chili powder for the pepper and doubled the cinnamon and used the Ibarra chocolate. They were fabulous!

well, i know exactly why bon appetit edited your recipe! you cannot be "too busy to cook" to make these with mexican chocolate. the ibarra bars are a nighmare to break up into chunks--hard as a rock and crumbly at the same time--so using an 8-in chef's knife took forever to chop them. am i missing something? a better technique? with that said, i baked a double batch for a birthday party, and they were a huge hit. the mexican chocolate changes the recipe altogether because its main ingredient is SUGAR so they come out very sweet. next time i might try mixing mexican chocolate and regular chips, to save the time of chopping but still get that unique taste...

I'll admit, I didn't really follow this recipe. I just "stole" the idea of cinnamon and added it to my regular chocolate chip recipe (which is pretty similar to this one). I also added dried cherries, which were incredible with the cinnamon flavor (although might not go so well with the pepper, I guess). Anyway, just wanted to put in my recommendation for the cinnamon! :-)

I made these for a Mexican themed potluck. I took the advice of more cinnamon (2 tsp) and I doubled the black pepper instead of trying the cayenne. I didn't notice the pepper at all and would consider the cayenne pepper but I live in the midwest and few people can take the heat.

Well I took the advice of other reviewers and added more cinamon (2 teaspoons) and some cayenne pepper (a heaping 1/4 teaspoon). I have to say this was the BEST chocolate chip cookie I have ever made--ever! I'm lucky any of the batter made it into cookies cause that was fantastic too!

They were good. They didn't taste much different then regular old fashioned Chocolate Chip Cookies. But in the overview they were good and I would give them four forks and I would make them again, even though this time I made them for a Spanish project. Thank You for the recipe and I will be visiting your site for other Spanis projects in th future or just for plain old fun. -Ben Roembke -Age 13 -Student at Monocacy Middle School P.S.

For those people who do not understand what makes it mexican, it was in Central America, now ascribed to Mexico, that people first began to use chocolate and it was most popular in combination with PEPPER. Usually more chiles than black pepper, but it's still that famous combination. Mole for example: chicken, chocolate and cayenne.

Loved these cookies! I did think they needed a little kick though, so I added more cinnamon and almost 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne in addition to the ground black pepper - they were a huge hit, even with my father who hates spicy foods.

Delicious !!!! These disappeared so fast,and were not too difficult so I would definitely make them again.

The good thing about these cookies is that they are moist and soft. I love that. However, the dough has a somewhat bitter aftertaste when not guised by the chocolate. I believe this is attributed to using baking powder and soda together in this recipe. Next time I will try using just powder or just soda. Otherwise, the taste is unique and surprising.

Ok, and WHAT makes this Mexican? They taste like a regular chocolate chip cookie to me - and I added a little extra cinnamon just to "kick it up a notch". Not that they're not good (they're VERY good), just not in a "Mexican" way and since I'm bringing dessert to a Mexican food party, I'm back looking for another recipe that'll fit the bill.
