After all of the good reviews, I was terribly disappointed in this recipe. It was bland, and what flavor there was was not great. I love chilled cucumber soup, but will never make this one again.

I used yoghurt in place of the buttermilk. I also used 2 egg yolks and only half rice vinegar, half seasoned rice vinegar, which is sweeter and brought out the flavor of the mint more. I also used twice the amount of mint. I topped with scallions.

I subtituted yogurt for the buttermilk. I used half rice vinegar and half seasoned rice vinegar, which is a little sweeter and brought out the flavor of the mint a little more. I thought it was very nice. I topped with scallions.

This was such a refreshing soup for a hot summer day. I think next time I'll use lowfat yogurt for half of the sour cream just to cut the fat and calories a little.

Dropped the buttermilk. Made it once with the sour cream and once substituting plain yogurt. Very tasty both times but. Served with another dollop of sour cream in the center of the bowl and fresh ground pepper on top.

Due to lack of ingredients, I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and half and half instead of butter milk. Worked out just fine.

Wow, this is a nice cool tasty soup. Great for a Hot summer evening. May want to add just a touch of onion for complexity or hot pepper for interest. Fine the way it is though. Previous comment about vinegar was confusing. It would be safe to add more than the recipe calls for.

I've made this soup at least twice now. It's comforthing on hot days. Easy & delicious.

One more way to get rid of cucumbers! A little more acid than other recipes but give it a try. Certainly, in my mind, not a 'pickle soup' as one described.

I was very disappointed with this recipe which I followed to the letter. My guest nick-named it "cream of pickle soup" - it calls for too much vinegar. Would NEVER make again!

The vinegar and egg yolk really made this recipe. It was easy and I will make it again and again.
