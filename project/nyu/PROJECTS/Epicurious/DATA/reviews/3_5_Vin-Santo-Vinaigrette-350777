At $65 for a half bottle of Vin Santo, marsala is definitely the wine in my version of this vinaigrette. It's a bit sweet, but the walnut oil adds a very nice contrast. This makes a huge amount of salad dressing.

This is one of the best vinaigrettes I've ever tasted. The flavor from the vin santo is exceptional -- after making it the whole kitchen smells great! I would recommend against making any substitutions - the recipe as written is wonderful.
