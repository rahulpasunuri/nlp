YUM! These are very tasty and delicious cookies, and not at all difficult to make. The tangerine zest in the dough and the lime zest in the topping make all the difference. I used sweetened flaked coconut instead of the unsweetened coconut called for in the recipe - the only unsweetened coconut I could find was very dry, and I was worried about how it would affect the texture of the topping. The regular coconut was perfect, and did not seem to make the cookies too sweet at all. These are wonderfully light and refreshing cookies, a nice break from chocolate and other heavy flavors.

They looked unappealing to me, but my family loved them. They WERE tasty. Cut out all cookies before you portion the topping. I'll try them as shallow tarts next time and I'll substitute candied apricots for dry to improve color, texture & taste.
