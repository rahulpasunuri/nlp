Made twice as written. Cooked some fresh and froze some. Incredibly good and got rave reviews with or without marinara sauce. Freezes well; defrosted before baking.

Made these with Ground Moosemeat for our Superbowl Party and some frozen are headed to a group wild game dinner this weekend. MicroBrews and Homemade Hard Cider....That's suffering thru winter!

These are incredible! They are a ton of work, but well worth it in my opinion. I made a double batch because I knew I could freeze them for later and I'm glad I did! Followed the recipe to a T except that I added olive, not vegetable oil to the balls; I'll take extra flavor anywhere I can get it!

I made only a few minor changes and they turned out fantastic -- everyone loved them. I added only 1 teaspoon of fennel. I find if you rub it through your hands it helps release the fennel flavor and you don't need to toast or crush. I used Queso Fresco simply because I forgot to buy the ricotta and didn't want to go back to the store Thanksgiving Day. I added one egg to the meat blend to avoid the dryness reported by another reviewer. The most important change however was that rather than wrapping the meatball with sage, I fried the sage and then crumbled it up with the panko. The flecks of sage looked nice and the flavor was just right. And yes, they are spicy so consider reducing the red pepper if you want a milder outcome.

Very good for hors d'oeuvres. Served them at a party and got requests for the recipe. The sage leaves were a bit messy to deal with, so I skipped that step after the first dozen or so. Have also made as dinner entre, no complaints

This is a lot of work and the meatballs came out spicy and the pork was dry.

Easy enough, everything in stock, easy to freeze and pop into the toaster oven, but not great. In all fairness, I am not into sausage and fennel flavors too much. We enjoyed this more the next time with a sweet and sour sauce we made. I would say try it, see what you think, but for hors d'oeuvres, make them a bit smaller.

These are just OK. Very heavy on the sage and not really worth the effort. They are a lot of work.

I was looking for an appetizer to take to a party and took a chance on this recipe. I was not disappointed. I highly recommend it.
