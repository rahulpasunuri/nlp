I made this once, it was perfect, made it a second time, and something really weird happened. Tthere was this strange ugly baked layer of butter/fat/egg at the bottom. What did I do wrong??? I felt like it was really hard to fold in the egg white this time. I'm so disappointed, and my potluck plans are shot. Any ideas of what I did wrong?

Easy recipe with sumptuous results. Everyone who eats it raves about it. Crusty surface, moist inside. Very chocolatey. A lot less fussy than most flourless chocolate cake recipes I've come across. I originally found this recipe in the March 1998 issue of Gourmet mag and have treasured it since.

Great recipe! I plan on making it again and again. Deep chocolate flavor to the delight of real chocolate lovers as myself. You can even melt the chocolate instead of grinding it - that's what I did since I don't have a food processor here. I also didn't have enough ground almonds, so I made up for the difference with some flaked almonds (about 1/4 of the total), which added a wonderful crunch to the texture. I live in Italy but I still preferred to consult Epicurious for this recipe, as I knew I could count on it! Thanks!

To the Cook from DC: I used wax paper for years and then found I couldn't get it off without seriously tearing the cake. It's not this recipe - it's the wax paper. Use parchment paper, floured and buttered if the recipe calls for this, and your problems should disappear.

i have made this twice, and i am obviously doing something wrong, (everyone else's rvws are stellar) - in my case the wax paper sticks to the bottom of the cake- even though i buttered it. this ruins the cake. any suggestions? do you all invert the cake after it's been made? i used valrhona chocolate and premium almonds from iran, it's such a pity this dessert goes to waste.

Great easy make-ahead dessert. A new staple in my dessert repertoire.

A family favorite and it freezes well too. I especially like it because it gives me the chocolate and almond flavors I crave, but isn't too gooey and rich, so I feel I can make it more often. It is a staple for dinner parties because it is easy, do ahead, and makes a great presentation on a cake platter after the powdered sugar is sprinkled on. Yummy!

I have made this torte several times. Each time the torte looks completely different than the last. But, the divine, sexy taste always remains the same. A wonderful recipe.

This was delicious. It's the kind of recipe that it's hard to mess up. Really rich! Tastes even better if you use high quality ingretients. It would also be nice if served with a dollop of whipped cream, but then again, wouldn't everything?

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was fine, but I thought it might be better with a chocolate ganache covering. Next time, I baked the torte in two pans, adding a tsp of almond extract, to intensify the marzipan flavour, and filled and covered it with chocolate ganache. I served it with a raspberry coulis, and it was wonderful.

I made this to take to a Thanksgiving party. It was a hit, and a welcome change from the usual apple and pumpkin pies. One guest even said it was "sexy"! I added a raspberry/amaretto sauce. Great!

This was a really wonderful dessert, and different from a typical flourless chocolate cake. It was rich, crumbly, and nutty. I served it with the Sour Cherry Compote from another chocolate almond torte recipe on this site, and the combination was outstanding. It was so good I had to make two so everyone could have seconds.

I made this torte because I got inspired by the movie "Chocolat" and because it was Valentine's Day. The torte was delicious and very easy to make. I didn't add the almonds but made a chocolate raspberry sauce to go with it which made it taste fantastic. I recommend this recipie highly. I took some of the torte to work and people loved it and me as well!!!

I made this recipe for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. It freezes very well, too. A definite keeper.
