The orange vinagrette needed a tsp of Dijon, but very light and fresh tasting. We took advandate of a 70 day March day in Chicago and availability of little cutie tangerines. I grilled sirloin steaks to go with the salad. Nice presentation topped with thin strips of grilled sirloin steak. Might also be good with marcona almonds

Delicious and lovely, but trimming watercress is such a pain, that I can't imagine making this again soon. I might try it again with arugula.

Spectacular! For 4, I used 8oz watercress, just 1 clementine, 1T blue cheese, 2 green onions, then lightened the dressing to 1/2T olive oil, 1/2T OJ concentrate, 1/2T white wine vinegar. Four forks are RARE for me.

Fabulous salad, simple recipe, easy ingredients. Even my mother, not a blue cheese lover, enjoyed this salad! For her, I switched to feta cheese.

This was very good, using orange juice as a part of the dressing really made it special. Had tossed in a little Bok Choy and fresh blue cheese complimented the whole salad. Will make it again.

I made this for a Christmas Eve dinner. The color was beautiful and the taste was a nice mix of the sweetness of the citrus, I used mandarines, and the shallots and vinegar, I used apple cider. I will definetly make this again. I've already been asked for the recipe.
