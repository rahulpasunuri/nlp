I love the simplicity of this recipe. Yes, it is just one herb, but it lets the flavor of the carrots shine through. The mint is subtle. A perfect way to enjoy carrots.

The key to this recipe is use a thick bed of mint to steam the carrots over. Since I have mint overgrowing my garden, I harvested a ton of fresh mint and put about a half-an-inch of mint on the steam pan. The carrots came out with a definite mint taste, not mint-ish as the other reviewer commented. I used olive oil instead of butter since I prefer that, and it was perfect! Especially with the fresh mint thrown in at the end. I was tipped off to this recipe since I've seen it in a few San Francisco restaurants recently, and I will definitely be serving this at our next dinner party. Easy and fresh! Highly recommended.

I used tarragon instead of mint since I had that on hand. I couldn't discern much flavor from the tarragon--perhaps it's not a strong enough herb? In any case, I also used a mix of baby vegetables--zucchini and pattypan sqaush, in addition to the carrots. At the end I did a very quick sautee of the three vegetables in herbed butter I had made for something else (tarragon, parsley, and chives). I liked this recipe's simplicity and how fantastic the colors of the vegetables were--they remained very bright and beautiful as a result of steaming. Served them over a white lima bean puree with rack of lamb. Delicious!

Mint-ish, not mint-y. Good enough for what it is, but it's really just steamed carrots with a single herb. OK.

I served this vegetable dish for company and it was a huge hit. Everyone commented on the unexpected and delightful taste of mint in the carrots. This recipe is a keeper.
