Don't try use normal cake pans unless you want a very thin cake. It was like a gigantic chocolate pancake... a delicious chocolate pancake. The frosting was great! Made this for a friends birthday and was loved by all. Great for kids although my son pricked his finger on the rose garnish. Remove the thorns!

I only made the cake...will have to try the frosting one of these days! The cake has an amazing texture and came out wonderfully! Moist and rich. I used a high quality cocoa powder from a local chocolatier, so I didn't have trouble with the cake lacking flavor. Now this is my go-to chocolate cake recipe. Also unlike other cake recipes, I doubled the cake to make in larger rounds and had equally as delicious results.

Cake was a mild chocolate cake, and moist....found it wasn't as flavorful as would have liked. The frosting was terrific to work with and to the taste! Will definitely make the frosting again, and again. Use good quality milk chocolate for best results!

I love that this cake and frosting feature MILK chocolate. The milk chocolate is really the star of the frosting, and the sour cream lends a perfect balance. I made both the cake and the frosting exactly as directed (the only thing I didn't do was garnish with a rose), and they were perfect. I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe the quantity: I wanted more!

I just finished icing this cake for my brother's 23rd birthday. I am super pleased with the results. First the batter was super easy to prepare, the cake was light and perfectly chocolatey. Although I can see that if left too long in the oven it could quickly become dry. I did have a bit of a freak out moment while preparing the frosting because, after adding the corn syrup, it turned to a lumpy mess, I decided to add the sour cream anyways and see what happened and the frosting immediately came together into a smooth tangy chocolate delight. I will be using this recipe in the future. My husband has been dipping his spoon into the frosting every time he passes through the kitchen.

I am a box cake kind of girl and it's mostly because every scratch cake I have made are heavy and dry. But, I decided to give this a try anyways and it came out unbelievable good. The only complaint is the frosting is some what bitter but still very tasty. This is a great recipe.

Excellent recipe- not too much cake, not too sweet and nice and chocolatey- used Lindt- next time would use some dark in frosting. The tip for 20mins for frosting good and I put in fridge and perfect.

I highly recommend this recipe as is. My frosting looked just like the photo; it is slightly lighter than the cake. I used what I had on hand, Nestle Milk choc. chips (1/6 cup for the cake and 1c + 1/3 c for frosting) and 2% milk (with 1/4 t. vinegar added) instead of buttermilk. Also, I made cupcakes, but I don't recommend if presentation is an issue, as the batter ran over during baking and they came out looking like windswept mushrooms. Nevertheless, they were delicious. I chilled the frosting for 1/2 hr in fridge and it spread nicely. I had an ample amount, so I piled it high on the the 10 cupcakes the recipe made. Definitely a keeper.

I made this cake in normal pans just to avoid buying more pans. So the layers were thin. And then icing I made as directed. Quite an interesting recipe. Needless to say, I like it. Definitely a keeper and one dessert that will disappear quickly.

Made this cake to rave reviews for a birthday! Unlike other reviewers I have no complaints about the icing, in fact that is what I liked the most. Not at all sweet, but nice and chocolatey. Followed the advice of a previous reviewer and used 60% cocoa chocolate bar for the frosting.

Three forks for the frosting, four for the cake. Didn't have a 5" pan, so used mini bundt cake pans, filling 4 perfectly. Considering their smaller size, cut the time down to 10 minutes, resulting in moist perfection. Found 2/3 c of sour cream to be a bit over powering for the icing. Will tweak that in the future. Also used bittersweet instead of milk chocolate for the cake and icing. Will try semi-sweet next time.

Fantastic recipe! I doubled the recipe, baked it in a tube pan and used Lindt milk chocolate. It was amazing. My guests loved it.

To weigh in on the frosting -- if it says milk chocolate, use milk chocolate OR plan on increasing the butter. I recently tried dark chocolate on a Julia Child recipe when it called for milk chocolate and the result was NOT good, and I had to start over with the frosting. So, Bon Appetit staff or fellow bakers -- since the photo indicates use of dark chocolate, how much more butter needs to be added to the frosting recipe if one wanted a darker chocolate frosting? PS -- I ALWAYS read the reviews to these recipes and tend to amend them as a result. So THANK YOU reviewers!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday in Feb. We had a dinner party with 7 people and it was just the right size (well, we could have fed 8 with it no problem). It is rich and fabulous. I have now made it several more times and have started experimenting with different chocolate. Last time I used Toblerone which was really good. Once I used Green and Black milk chocolate, also good... although the second bar I had picked up had almonds so it looked like it had warts. :)

This cake was absolutely delicious. The cake was very moist and had an excellent chocolate taste. I have read comments about the frosting being to thin to work with...here is a tip make the frosting a day ahead...refrigate the frosting to allow a longer setting time....the frosting will be firm enough to frost a cake and possibly pipe decorations. Remember recipes are guides and can me changed to one's liking and tastes.

This is THE BEST CHOCOLATE cake EVER. the cake is absolutely the moistest I have ever had and finally, a chocolate frosting that is super light and creamy. Truly perfect. And I love that the size is tiny. Because everytime I make it, I am going to eat it in one day, haha.

I made this for a friend's birthday gift. Based on earlier postings, I decided to use the milk chocolate/sour cream frosting strictly as a filling and used chocolate ganache to cover the exterior of the cake. Boo to Bon Appetit for the misleading photo--that is definitely NOT what the milk chocolate filling looked like. For that reason alone, I gave this three instead of four forks. I ran across something similar in Elizabeth Falkner's Demolition Desserts--the icing as written was about 10 shades lighter than what was photographed ... very frustrating to the home cook. From the small amount of cake I sliced off to make level, the cake was great, and I really loved the filling flavor. I would make it again, but would instead make three cake layers instead of two and not split them ... the cake became quite high and unwieldy for transport with four layers ... all in all I agree with the other poster who requested more "mini" size dessert recipes ... this was a great size!

Perhaps it was because I used half dark chocolate in this recipe (for frosting and batter), but I thought it tasted a bit bitter. Hubs and I critiqued it as we sat there devouring it. ;-) This recipe should probably be followed as is. Will try again.

I loved that this recipe made a small cake. Although the cake was good as written, I added a chocolate mousse filling (found on this site under the "Double Chocolate Torte" recipe) and made an Italian meringue chocolate buttercream icing rather than the sour cream icing.

I just made this cake for Valentines. I used 60% cocoa, not milk chocolate and I think it's perfect. This frosting does tend to set up as it sits, but melts in your mouth. The cake frosting combo work very well with each other. The small size works so well for just a few people. No left overs to nibble. I would not change anything else.

I would give the cake 4 forks, but the frosting 2 forks. So I averaged for the recipe. I agree with the first reviewer about the frosting. There is something missing. Not chocolatey enough, definitely too much sour cream. I am not sure if using a darker chocolate would make it better? There is no way that the frosting in the picture is made with milk chocolate, so don't expect it to come out that dark. The cake itself is exceptional; I would absolutely make it again and use a different frosting. The frosting is the reason I took away a fork; the cake is very easy to make and came out really well in my 5.5" pans. I also would not bother splitting the layers in half horizontally if this technique is new to you; I found this to be more trouble than it was worth.

watch cake carefully as it cooks- easy to overcook- mine a little dry despite watching carefully. frosting not as looked in picture- appeared as though a dark chocolate was used instead of milk. my husband wanted more of a chocolate taste in frosting- thought too much sour cream.i also thought it was too stiff. will try again with another similar frosting recipe that calls for a darker/semisweet chocolate.

A perfect little cake for a few special friends, but my icing was not as dark as the photo. I'd like more downsized recipes for these little cake pans. Any suggestions?

FANTASTIC!!!! Heed the advice to use a good grade of chocolate and you'll have a cake that any chocolate lover could die for. Moist with a not too sweet icing makes for a keeper to make all year long.
