This is our favorite soup recipe ever. Loved by all. I do add the toasted squash seeds at the very end. It adds a nice crunch. I have to make multiple batches as it goes so quickly.

I increased everything a bit, because I had 2 lbs. of squash. I split the fat - equal parts bacon fat and butter. Also added about a 1/4 cup of apple cider. At final seasoning, decided it was a little too sweet- often happens with this squash. So, I added about 1 1/2 t. Cumin, which really added a lot to the flavor. Also, added crumbled blue cheese with the bacon for toppings. The sharpness of the cheese was a nice contrast to the soup. Flavor improved the next day

Forgot to mentioned I used a 2 pd squash, 2 leeks and 2 apples and probably 6 cups of low sodium chicken broth.

I recently made this for clients. First time it was good, second time outstanding! I hate it when I read a review and half of the recipe has been changed, all I did here was tweek it a little. I diced the bacon before (4 slices maple flavored) frying. I added butter to the bacon drippings before adding the leeks etc. Sauteed the apples (separetly) with butter and add cinnamon before adding the broth. Add a pinch of cumin and grate some nutmeg. Also added bacon bits to the broth (reserve some for topping) I transferred from skillet to stock pot just before the squash is totally cooked. I also think the cooking time is off. Also did not use water for thinning only low sodium chicken broth.

fabulous starting point for squash soup. Very good if made exactly as directed. I added a pinch of cumin and curry, and it became fabulous! Next time I think I'll start with the base soup and add fall spices and some raisins.

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful base recipe. I think the leeks are 100% necessary, but I also added butter (just a little) to the bacon fat when sauteeing the onions and leeks (and upped the garlic to 4 cloves), and also sauteed the squash before adding liquids. Also added a dash of cumin and a dash of curry (great suggestions) to the sauteed vegetables. This recipe makes barely enough for 1 dinner --- definitely double it if not triple it (to have some frozen).

I LOVE this recipe! I make it several times a year (fall/winter). I love the flavors and the apple/bacon topping is delish...definately recommend this recipe!

"This is amazing" is what I heard. And it is. Very subtle and delicious. Great, fast fall night dinner. No changes or substitutions, though I did add a little half and half while pureeing in the food processor the 2nd time and it made it just a little bit more delicious. Yum!

This sounded like just the recipe I was looking for, but it turned out to very disappointing. Despite some of the wonderful reviews this recipe received, it was an odd balance of flavors and highly underseasoned as it is written. I agree with one reviewer who described the leeks as imparting an acrid flavor; they do. I added a pinch of cayenne and a teaspoon of curry to add some flavor, but the suggestion of adding a small amount of sherry turned the whole thing into something inedible. I will definitely remember not to make this recipe again!

I followed this Epicurious recipe exactly, and the soup was wonderful! Like so many of the reviewers noted, the ingredients really can all be tasted, but perhaps we could say the total is even better than the sum of the parts. However, I would strongly suggest you use the leek without any substitution. To me, it's the leek that gives the soup its distinction and elevates it to being elegant. Leeks, of course, are an essential ingredient in vichyssoise. But I really liked this soup better than the vichyssoise I have attempted. I crumbled bacon onto the soup and also used a little apple garnish, following the recipe. But I believe if I were to do it again, I'd skip the apple garnish since it distracts slightly from the interesting complexity of the soup itself. Great soup!

I've made this today for the second time this week. This is my conclusion: the leeks are not worth it. The first batch I made with 1/2 red onion & 1/2 yellow onion. I also used a packaged of already peeled & chopped squash, an old apple hanging around and a bullion cube (I usually have fresher stuff in my fridge I promise). I added a splash of sherry at the end and a pinch of dried thyme before pureeing with my hand blender. This was delicious!!! Today I made the recipe as is and my husband and I agreed that the first batch was much better. The batch with the onion had a smoother taste, whereas the batch with the leeks was sweeter and a bit acrid. Don't waste your money on the leeks.

I usually make recipes as written the first time I make them, with the exception of substituting broth for water in soup recipes. With that one change, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this soup was. Very flavorful. A little sweet, but not too sweet, a little tart. It's as if you can taste every component. I was sorry when it was gone. I imagine it would be good as a purée, also. Just add less broth. All of the suggestions for additions sound good, too. I may try some of those next time.

In a double recipe, I spruced up the flavor by doing the following: Reduced the amount of onion, added a little more garlic, 3 bay leaves, and several sprigs of fresh thyme. I broiled the squash until cooked, and sautéed 4 or 5 apples in the left- over bacon fat. The 4 or 5 bacon strips I cooked never got totally crispy, so I cut them into tiny pieces, and tossed them into the pot. Then I added about 1 C. chicken stock and 4 C. homemade lamb stock. The stock alone made so much of a difference! I roasted the butternut squash seeds, ground them to a powder, and added them to the stock with some garam masala, cinnamon, cardamom, salt and pepper. I also tossed in some grated fresh ginger (about 3-4 tbsp). I let the stock reduce a considerable amount, and then stick-blended to smoothness. I added a combination 1% milk and nonfat kefir (no sour cream around) at the end. Was a lot of work, but tasted quite flavorful in the end!

This was amazing! People who said it was bland must have had bad ingredients, because it's anything but! There's a little sweet from the squash, a little tart from the apple, and delicious undertones of the leek, garlic, and onion. I also added a little cumin as well as a little garam masala, but not much. I absolutely love it, will definitely make it again!

Rating: 2
Just ok. Definitely needed to add some cumin to give it some flavor. I'm just not a fan of butternut squash soup as I find it too sweet.

By first carmelizing the squash in some butter, then adding the leeks, onions and garlic and allowing them to carmelize, it ads quite a bit of taste to the soup. Being salt sensitive, I sadded 2.5 c. water, one chicken boullion cube and further seasoned with a natural sea salt. What a wonderful recipe!

Rating: 3
I agree that this could have been a bland soup, BUT using what was available, I subbed a QUINCE for the apple and was very generous with the salt & pepper. I also added fresh nutmeg and cinnamon. Used turkey bacon instead of regular. And definetly used the roasted seeds. A winter keeper!

I love making soup, but this recipe was just okay. I had to double it, making the prep very time consuming. After all of the work, it was pretty bland. I had to doctor it up quite a bit. My guests said they liked it, but I think they were just being polite.

Rating: 4
To help bolster the flavor, I caramelized the onions and shallots, using the same skillet the bacon was cooked in. Just pour off all grease and add 1 Tbsp. butter, then onions and shallots. Cook for 30 minutes or so and add the roasted squash, two apples, a sweet potato and cook until soft. Deglaze the skillet with chicken broth and transfer to a pot, adding more chicken broth as needed and a bay leaf. Season to taste with curry powder, salt and a dash of cinnamon. Remove bay leaf and puree, adding more chicken broth if too thick. Roasting the squash and caramelizing the onions and shallots made all the difference! The result is a soup with a very rich flavor.

I have made this soup several times and may have even reviewed it before... last night it got rave reviews at a family gathering of 8 (tripled it). Here are 2 adjustments that bring out the flavors: 1) replace water with apple cider and 2) before adding liquids, stop and saute apple and squash for 5 minutes. Really amazing! Note that if you triple it, all the chopping takes longer than the stated time.

I lightened the recipe up by skipping the bacon and using non-fat yogurt rather than sour cream. The result was a fresh, slightly sweet flavor. Very yummy!

I've made this soup pretty much every fall/winter and we always love it. I go a little heavier on the squash and add a bit of cream and tabasco. This year I tripled the recipe and gave it out as a gift to neighbors during the pre-Christmas rush. Freezes well.

Rating: 3
This recipe is wonderful and goes to 4 stars when I reaf some readers' comments and did the following: Added to the soup: a pinch of cinnamon, 1/4 Cup good apple juice, 1/4 Cup half-n-half instead of sour cream, and 1/2 teaspoon madras curry powder. I also made simple croutons out of rye bread covered in cheddar cheese (cover slices with cheese, toast, cool, cut into squares). the flavors blend deliciously with those in the soup. Also: like others recommended, cut the squash in half and bake for 20 min, then peel (MUCH easier); for all this work and cooking time, definitely double the recipe if you want 4 solid servings.

Terrific! I don't mix the sour cream into the soup, I use a dollap on top when serving. Served this many times, and it freezes well (minus the sour cream).

An *excellent* fall treat. I brought this to a party last night and people were asking for more long after it was gone. I made the entire batch the night before the party (all except the sour cream) and stirred that in as I heated it up before serving. I think the soup benefitted from being made a day ahead of time.

This is a great fall soup with just a hint of sweetness. I incorporated all the great hints from other cooks: cut squash in 1/2 lengthwise and baked @ 350F cut side down for 20 mins before peeling & cutting to save time & energy. I added 1/2 tsp. each of ground cumin & coriander to the sauteed vegs. (I don't like curry powder). I thinned the soup with a 4oz apple juice box and 1/4 cup of apple brandy (no additional water). I mixed some ground cumin into the sour cream. I thought the soup, as doctored, was delicious and not too thick at all. The flavors are subtle, but not bland. Great for a cool autumn evening.

If there were a negative, say, two forks, this recipe would deserve the rating. It's bland, even with added cumin as one of the reviewers suggested, and with vodka replacing some of the water to dilute it. (I wouldn't suggest doing this, btw, since it leaves the soup with a vaguely acrid aftertaste.) It's also way too thick--a problem that would be cured by adding more liquid (than called for in the recipe), granted, but since it was already so bland, I didn't want to dilute the flavor even more. Perhaps the recipe's blandness had something to do with the fact that I roasted the squash to avoid peeling, chopping and dicing it? No matter: if you're looking for a good butternut squash soup, I've had much better ones. My advice is to keep looking.

For ease in preparation and to save time, you may substitute William-Sonoma's Butternut Squash Puree. It comes in a 32 ounce jar and is generally available from October through December at all Williams-Sonoma stores. It is an organic product. As it has limited availability, buy several jars for use throughout the year. Butternut squash can be used in any recipe where you would use pumpkin. Alternatively, you can also use pumpkin puree in this recipe.

This soup is easy and colorful. I pureed it right in the pot using a hand held blender, which gave a great and creamy consistency, while leaving a bit of texture. I might stir in a little heavy cream of half and half to thin it the next day, rather than adding water as is suggested for thinning. Definitely will make again.... perhaps for company next time. Can be made into a beautiful presentation for fall!

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful soup! I suggest using an apple smoked bacon as the bacon flavor is fairly prominent. In addition, the second time I made this soup, I substituted vodka for the 1/2 c. of water. It added a little tang to the flavor! I also doubled the receipe as it doesn't make much.

Took some hints from recipe and reviews for Butternut Squash Soup with Ginger (on this site),such as baking the squash, adding coriander and cumin, fresh ginger. Guests really liked the soup, although I would add more liquid at some point because I thought it too thick.

Except that I roast my squash to deepen its flavor, I follow this recipe as written and find it very flavorful. I do use my own, homemade chicken broth which I'm sure boosts the flavor. First time I made this soup I tasted it when it was almost done but before I'd added the sour cream. It as a bit flat. I added the two Tbsps sour cream and that really woke up the flavor. Balanced out the sweetness just right. In general, my husband does not like pureed soups but he raved about this when I served it last night.

I made this soup and it was easy and turned out great. It was a bit bland and I added curry to the soup while it was simmering. Everyone loved the subtle flavor. I did put the creme fresh in (and I love cream), but don't even think it was necessary--butternut squash is so creamy as it is.

Love this soup! I used it as a starter for a thanksgiving dinner I hosted. I used an additional apple and nutmeg as suggested by a previous user. I also added 1/8 tsp cinnamon, winw and apricot brandy. I mixed the sour cream with cumin and placed a dollop in the middle of each bowl with bacon spread across the top. Yummmmm!

Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised at how sweet the soup was because I often serve baked butternut squash, but I didn't care for it. Neither did my husband, who was looking forward to it. Also it was really thick, which could have been cured with adding more water or broth, but.... it just wasn't what I was looking for.

Maybe I used a superleek or something, because that flavor seemed to overwhelm all others. I will be making again because my hubby liked it, but this time will use more apple and squash, less leek and onion. I prefer a sweeter, creamier squash soup. Note, I used apple juice instead of water, as another reviewer suggested, yogurt instead of sour cream for health reasons, and added honey to counteract the leek.

Yum! My picky son asked for a second bowl which is saying something. I mostly followed the recipe with these exceptions: I forget to get a leek so used a whole onion and a shallot, the combination of ingredients seemed to cry out for sage, so I added some of that with the bay leaf, and just before serving I threw in a splash of brandy. I also baked the squash prior to putting it into the soup, this makes for much easier removal of the skin and it contributes a nice flavour.

I've made this several times and it's always a favorite. Make sure you have extra bacon to top the soup for serving. Also, if you double or triple, don't double and triple the leeks -- it is too powerful for the soup, or at least that's what I've found. I had to "fix it" the next day by adding additionaly squash.

I thought this receipe was fantastic. I used turkey bacon for the non pork-eaters in the crowd. I served this dish at our new years eve sudo-Iron Chef competition to 10 people. They all raved about this (and the apple walnut ravoli). I used 1 large braeburn apples and 1 large granny smith.

I thought this was a bit watery and on the bland side. My husband says "It's like kissing your sister." I made my own chicken broth first and perhaps I did not reduce it enough. I think you must be sure to weigh the squash after you cut it so buy a butternut squash that weighs almost two pounds. I would slightly decrease the water or leave it out altogether next time. I left out the bacon because my daughter is a vegetarian, and I thought the sour cream at the end really helped. It's a keeper though.

I had to wing it a little today. Used acorn squash, pierced with a barbecue skewer and nuked whole until it was soft enough to cut. The leek I had was HUGE, so I omitted the onion and garlic, just sprinkled the leek with a little garlic salt. During the blending, I used apple juice (swiped one of my kid's Juicy Juice boxes) instead of water. And stirred in a generous sprinkling of ground ginger before reheating. Still, an excellent recipe, especially if you like to tinker. Next time I'd like to try adding a splash of Chardonnay just before serving.

I have tried several butternut squash soup recipes and always come back to this one. To save on fat and calories, I skip the bacon grease but then sprinkle with 2 slices of crumbled turkey bacon. At the end I swirl in some fat free half ' half. Even with these adjustments, the soup is a rich treat. I use an emulsion blender instead of the food processor and it really saves time.

I made this for our dinner last night, along with the Cheddar Chutney Toasts (just okay). The soup was great! We both enjoyed it. I made it according to the recipe except I split the squash in half, covered it with Saran, and nuked it. I then just scooped out the squash. I don't know how anyone could ever get through that skin! It was a challenge splitting it in half. I'll make it again!

Like always, I had to mess with the recipe. I didn't have my hands on fresh butternut squash, so I used canned pumpkin and instead of chicken stock, I used my homemade turkey stock (made from a grilled turkey carcass) and it added a wonderful smoky hint that blended well with the bacon. It's a great basic recipe that can be adapted easily. P.S. I did not feel the need to add sherry, because the large apple I used added enough acid to the soup.

I gave this recipe a low score only because I added sherry to it which some reviewers had suggested. I wish I hadn't added the sherry. It gave the soup a bitter flavor. So, I will be retrying the soup w/o it next time. Other than that, the soup seems good enough to try again. Before I added the sherry it had a mild flavor. I thought the sherry would be good since I often add sherry to my recipes. But it was a bad idea :( So my suggestion: DON'T add sherry.

Next time I'll saute with only 1 T bacon grease (I like flavors to be a bit more subtle). I did not stir in the sour cream at the end, but thinned it down with a little half & half, put it in a squeeze bottle and made a squiggly design on each serving. The bacon was cut crosswise into thin strips before sauteing - it made a lovely garnish over the sour cream. The presentation was lovely & my guests gave this a definite thumbs up!

I believe that you can't go wrong with squash or pumpkin soup. I didn't have butternut on hand, so I used a kabocha squash (sometimes called a Japanese pumpkin) instead. The bacon was a nice touch, but I prefer spices such as ginger, nutmeg, cumin, curry, etc. If you use these spices, skip the bacon and garnish with a little cilantro instead.
