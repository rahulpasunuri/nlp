Super easy, delicious and elegant. Flavors are subtle and complement the scallops beautifully. A touch more fresh ginger doesn't hurt.

This recipe was so easy and so good, even the next day. I used Trader Joe's New England sea scallops, a very good curry powder from my local natural food store, and a fresh off the vine zucchini. Didn't have any ginger, so I served chutney on the side. There's something marvelous about the combination of curry, scallops and zucchini. It was so quick and so good, I will make it for guests.

The recipe was delicious and it took no time at all. It was easy to follow and my fiance, who doesn't like fishy food, loved it.

This was a delicious recipe. Added one scallion that I started to saute about two minutes before the garlic/ginger. Forgot to add lime & didn't miss it. Be generous with chopped cilantro. It's perfect for the dish. Easy & colorful & good enough for company. Served garlic yukon gold mashed potatoes.

Not sure I liked the combo of curry and scallops. I added yellow squash/zucchini to enhance color.

I thought this recipe was fine, but for me it wasn't worth the cost of fresh sea scallops. I expected to love this recipe, given the ingredients and the favorable reviews. I liked that it was quick, and the zucchini was very nice, but the curry powder flavor just didn't do justice to the scallops, in my view.

Fast and easy. Good weeknight meal. The zucchini was awesome. I plan on making the zucchini part of the recipe many times in the future - it was the best zucchini I've ever had.

I'm afraid that I didn't like this as much as the other reviewers (although everyone I served it to liked it). I thought the curry overpowered the scallops and took away from their natural sweetness; I have other scallop recipes that I prefer. My kitchen smells too bad this morning to justify a meal that I thought was just OK, so I won't make again.

Quite good. I thought the zucchini was a nice complement. Added the juice of one lime to the scallops at the end. Will make again. Cut up leftover scallops and served with pasta and parmesan the next day. The original recipe is healthy and effortless.

Absolutely Delicious!!!!!! Very impressive to make for company.

Very tasty, I made it w/o cilantro (cause I think cilantro is absolutely disgusting and should be banned from the universe) and used powdered ginger since I didn't have fresh. Presentation friendly as well, you could easily serve this to guests and they'll think they're getting something mega gourmet. I'll definitely try what another reviewer said and skewer/grill it.

A delicious and easy dish. I have sometimes made it without the zucchini, instead serving it over a simple spinach or green salad.

Delicious, quick and easy! What more could you ask for? I never prepare this dish that I'm not asked for the recipe. Can be made on the grill, too, if you use aluminum foil and thread two skewers through the scallops for easy flipping.

We have been making this recipe for years now. I agree that it is a quick to cook and tastes great dinner for midweek. We don't mind the zucchiini as much as others have because we coat them with curry powder also. We typically have this with Indian rice and a nice Gewürztraminer.

I have made this recipe several times using the hints from "A Cook from Philadelphia". In order not to break the bank, when serving scallops at a large dinner party, I add 5 jumbo shrimp per person to the recipe. I put red, green and yellow peppers in the rice for color. It makes a great presentation with the shellfish served over the rice - the scallops in the center and the shrimp & zucchini alternating in a wheel around the scallops. I pour the sauce over the shellfish and sprinkle some scallions over all.

Quick and easy midweek lunch. Start to finish in less than 40 minutes, including the cooking of jasmine rice and picking of cilantro from the garden.

this was really excellent. i was serving this with an indian rice dish, and felt that the meal could use more of a sauce. i saved the liquid the scallops came in for later use and left out the zucchini. after searing the scallops, i removed them from the pan, and added to the oil some cumin seeds and madras curry powder to toast for a minute. then deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup dry white wine and added 1/2 cup chicken stock and the reserved scallop liquor. let simmer a few minutes. at the last minute, swirl two tablespoons cold butter to sauce. served the sauce over the scallops and rice. divine!

This is a great quick and easy dish to prepare. The seasoning (I added some fresh lime juice at the end)is just right, and the whole thing comes together beautifully. I served it over plain couscous, but it would also work well with basmati rice. I'll absolutely make this healthy and flavorful dish again!

It was quick easy and elegant, but needed more zing. Next time, I'll add some red pepper flakes at the end. Maybe Tabasco? We liked it, will experiment. Thanks, Epicurious, for giving us recipes we can play with!

Terrific and easy, last minute dinner dish. Recipe is more than enough for two - can easily serve more, especially if served over basmati rice.

This dish didn't really do that much for me. The combination of curry and scallops sounds great but after making it, it tasted a little strange to me.

This is such a simple and quick dish to make, and it really is quite delicious! A favorite in this household.

Very good recipe. Extremely quick and elegant - Just the time of recipe I love to have on hand for a no-fuss, yet first-class meal! Next time I make it, I will add a bit of lime juice over the scallops just before serving. It really enhances the flavour. A perfect match!

The subtle taste of ginger and curry is wonderful with the zucchini and scallops. This was very easy to make and went well with lentil rice pilaf from Whole Foods. Excellent summer fare with red wine.

This dish was delicious and was a hit with the gourmet wine ladies. Everyone wanted the recipe. I did leave out the garlic, however, as one lady is very allergic and the scallops were still great! Definitely, this will be made again.

When I first saw this in the magazine I thought the curry would overpower the scallops but last night when I didn't have anything in mind for dinner but I had all these ingredients I decided to give it a whirl and we were glad. I agree with another reviewer about the ratio of zuc to scallops so I used one medium zuc (a great way to use that garden produce!) and it was just right. I also used a bit of butter in with the olive oil. This, rice and green beans and you have an elegant, easy meal.

This dish was delicious! We followed the recipe quite closely and it turned out perfectly. We used a high quality olive oil that enhanced the flavour and we also increased the amount of garlic and ginger (by about 50%). We have decided to add it to our list of "dishes that impress".

Considering how quick this recipe is to make, it's quite good. I used significantly more curry powder than is called for, which I think is helpful. And if I were to do it again, I might use a bit less zucchini for the amount of scallops. Still ... for something so easy, it's great and will undoubtedly make it into my "not much time for dinner" repertoire.
