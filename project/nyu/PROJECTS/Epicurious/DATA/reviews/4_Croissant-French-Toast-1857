Wonderful recipe. May become our standard french toast recipe. Some reviewers suggested soaking the sliced croissants for 10-15 minutes. The croissant halves fell apart for me after sitting in the custard that long. We found that whole croissants held up well in the custard for a long soak while the halves did not.

This is a fantastic recipe. The orange juice and peel are what make it great. This is my new go-to French Toast recipe.

Exceptional french toast and really quick and easy. I let the croissant soak for 10 minutes on each side per another reviewer.

This was very good and easy. Some people commented that the peel was too much trouble, but I used the zester and it was quick. I only used about 1/4 the amount of butter in the recipe and it was still very rich.

This recipe is really delicious and I think the orange zest really adds something flavorwise. Excellent!

This recipe was delicious. You could not taste the individual ingredients in the batter--they were all very subtle. It was a little soggy in the middle, but maybe that was my fault.

It was pretty tasty, my 5 & 6 year old loved it- they said it was the best french toast I've ever mae. Pretty high praise from the peanut gallery!. I would probably have soaked them for a little longer to make sure the custard was completely absorbed- at least 15 minutes per side. other than taht, very good.

These were delicious and a nice alternative to traditional french toast. I didn't have any orange peel so I left it out and added a little salt as recommended by others.

A very delightful change from the usual french toast. I added salt like a few other cooks suggested and I thought the orange really shined through. I will definitely make this again. My kids really enjoyed it as well (5 and 7).

I used medium sized croissants without splitting them to make this FREEDOM toast. We topped with powdered sugar and a touch of maple syrup. They were delicious with grits, eggs, and bacon for supper.

Just lovely and quick to prepare! I did omit the powdered sugar step, and used miniature croissants from one of our local grocer's bakery section. I loved the subtle hint of orange from the juice/peel combination and think that is part of what makes these different. Wonderful twist on an old standard... KIMBER

This recipe is delicious. I added a little salt and omitted the orange peel(too lazy). Also, don't bother with the maple syrup, powdered sugar is sweet enough. I also recommed good quality croissants.

Though it may look like a time consuming recipe, you can make the milk mixture in advance, and refrigerate it overnight or until you need it. Then simply dip in the croissants and voila! I like to press down on the croissants and flatten them out before dipping them in the milk. Also, feel free to buy those Pilsbury instant crescent rolls and flatten a little right after they come out of the oven.

I really enjoyed this one! I served the croissants with strawberries that I had soaked in an orange juice and sugar mixture. Topped with only the strawberries and powered sugar or smothered in maple syrup this is a great brunch/breakfast dish!

This is also very good with lemon zest instead of orange, it adds zip!
