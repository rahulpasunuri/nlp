Thanks for all the nice comments about my recipe. This is based on my grandmother's Southern Pecan Pie and the explanation for the name(which appeared in the Gourmet issue)is that we were waiting for hurricane Wilma, the 4th in a row here in south FL that year, and I wanted to make something amazing to eat when the power went out (again)! In our family, we eat it for breakfast every day afterwards, until it's gone. Note: The original recipe calls for finely ground pecans (we do them by hand).

Very tasty recipe, although it can be pretty messy. We heated ours up before serving and it was an enormous, gooey mess. Basically, we just used spoons to get the pie on plates, which became big mounds of pie-goo. Maybe it's supposed to be served cold or room temp.

Wow. I cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup and it was excellent. Totally decadent but worth it.

This pie is yummy!! I also made my own dulce de leche as I could not find it in the grocery store. This is a keeper in my house. I also substituted 1/2 cup of the corn syrup with amber agave nectar and next time I will try using all agave nectar and add a bit more flour......

I made this for Thanksgiving 2009 and will definitely make it again this year. I made the dulce de leche from scratch (Alton Brown recipe), which is what I think made this recipe so darn good. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone raved about it.

Made this for Thanksgiving 2009. Didn't change a thing but used the vodka pastry dough recipe from America's Test Kitchen, and added a light sprinkle of Maldon Sea Salt flakes to the finished product. Wow. This was delicious and SUPER rich - like eating a candy bar, really. I felt that it improved with age (it took us a few days to plow through the leftovers), but that might just be because I was less overstuffed with other food on the days following Thanksgiving. A nice change from standard pecan pie.

Made this on Saturday for a pot-luck and then on Sunday for friends coming over. Fortunately, not the same group! Anyway, here's what I learned from Saturday - watch "finely chop" for the pecans. You definitely want the chunks of nut, not rubble. I had some pieces that were too small so a rougher chop on Sunday really allowed the pecan flavour to come through and gave a nice textural contrast between the crunch and the goo. Secondly, I cooked it for less time on Sunday. 50 minutes in my oven made it too dense whereas 42/43 minutes on Sunday allowed it to stay puffed and have a little tiny bit of softness to the filling. Lovely. Make the pastry, it takes minutes and is better than a store-bought pie shell.

It's too bad that this wonderful recipe has such a silly name. Rich, great textural contrasts and flavor. It is definitely a keeper. I made this pie for Thanksgiving 2009 and it completely disappeared, and that was with stiff competition! BTW, I was short on pecans and supplemented them with hazelnuts. Chocolate, dulce de leche and nuts = winning combo.
