I reduced this to 2/3-lb (2c) cherry tomatoes for two people and there were just a few tomatoes leftover. I used dried marjoram (added the last 10 mins). Super tasty!

I cant say I loved this. It was a bit dull. I served it at a party last night and it was the least favorite of all my epi recipies.

Hi, I skipped the marjoram as well. I made this for Christmas Dinner Appitizer and there will be kids. I know Basil is well liked so I used that. It smelled very good while the tomatoes were roasting last night. Can't wait to serve it today. Taking the advice from another cook, I will cut up the ciabatta before adding the tomatoes. Oh yeah, I'll sprinkle some Parmesan Cheese before serving, Everything goes Better with Cheese :)

Cannot go wrong. I served this full recipe as part of a dinner for 15 people..it was gone in minutes.

a slightly diff take on bruschetta. The benefit is that you can make the topping one day ahead so you have less to deal with on the day you are entertaining. I cut down on the red pepper since it was for kids too and went with basil instead of marjoram. Am making it the second time in 2 weeks !

I loved this recipe! Delicious and so simple to make. I made it 2 days ahead of time. I used dried marjoram and a sweet locally made balsamic. I added a touch of sugar. It was sweet, but fabulous!

Delicious and great presentation. I followed one the reviewer's suggestion and cut the bread into serving pieces before cooking. Anything that I can do ahead of time works for me. I also sprinkled a little parmesan on. I didn't use the marjoram as I had fresh basil - the flavors were wonderful. This will be on of my go to appetizers for dinner parties.

I don't understand why there aren't more reviews here. This is a phenomenal, easy recipe that can be made in advance. I make the tomato mixture as is and serve with french bread rounds on the side. Have left overs? Try serving over chicken or pasta. Simply. Easy. Fantastic.

I made this for a wine tasting picnic and everyone loved it! I did change the recipe slightly... I roasted the tomatoes as instructed but instead of placing it onto bread and toasting I pored it over goat cheese and served with crackers. Will absolutely be making again!

I made this two days before my Christmas party, which gave the flavors time to really settle in. Absolutely delicious. What flavor - and easy. I followed the recipe as is and had no complaints.

This was a very fresh, easy spread. I made it 2 days before it was served. Very tasty!

This was a good way to use up the mulitude of cherry/grape tomatoes from the garden. Was a bit sweet. Next time will follow other reviewer's suggestion of using a little cheese to balance the sweet.

New Year's 2006 Progressive Dinner hit! I took the advise of previous reviewers and added lots of fresh basil along with slightly less marjoram. The crispiness of the ciabatta was fantastic contrast to the juicy tomatoes (also used some yellow grape tomatoes along with the red one's). They are very sweet and needed quite a bit of salt to balance flavor (be sure to taste for salt at end of roasting phase). Next time I will also add a some garlic to the roasting pan. Good quality ciabatta is key - the holes soak up the juices and the crust remains crispy!

It looked beautiful, but I did not like the marjoram taste. I would use goat cheese and top with basil instead. I brought it to a party whole and cut it when I got there. Everyone thought is was very martha stewart.

Excellent! Made with tons of fresh basil. Next time will add garlic to roasting pan, pinch of brown sugar to juices.

Made it with assorted color cherry and grape tomatoes and came out beautifully. Reminded me a great deal of one of my favorite summertime dishes (panzanella), which also has the marjoram. There is no substitute in flavor. Great taste and loved the crispy ciabatta.

This was a smashing success at our New Year's party and I would make it again, as is. For those who do not like marjoram, basil would be a delicious substitute.

The tomatoes were terrific, roasted until juicy and tender. The ciabatta was crusty and delicious. The marjoram was horrendous! I was not familiar with marjoram before, and added some fresh, as the recipe listed. I found the taste strong and soapy. It would be a delighful fragrance for a facial cleanser. The rest of the recipe was just terrific though, so I will 100% try it again with basil or with flat leaf parsley.

This was good but needed something. I sprinkled on some grated asiago cheese before putting it back in the oven. Also I cut the bread into serving size pieces before putting the tomatoes on top. Was easier than trying to cut it afterward.
