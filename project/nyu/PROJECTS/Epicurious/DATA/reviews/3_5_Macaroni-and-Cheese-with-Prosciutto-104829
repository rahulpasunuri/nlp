Definitely a make again since my daughter and I ate half of it for dinner. My macaroni directions said to cook for 7 minutes for al dente - I cooked for 6. I used 2 cups of cheese - 1 in the macaroni and 1 on top. I also added panko to the topping. Mine cooked for 25 minutes because I wanted the topping browner. I had no problem with soupiness.

@#$% Are you kidding me? So good. Served with Garlic Pepper Chicken and asparagus with lemon and garlic. Part of what my fiance called her favorite meal ever.

I've been looking for a great mac n' chesse recipe and this is it! I did make a few changes to enhance what was already there. I sauteed the prosciutto with 2 chopped shallots prior to adding it and used light cream instead of whipping and whole milk. Adding panko crumbs with the last cup of grated cheese for topping was also a hit.

Rating: 4
Love this - I make it often. I do add more cheese than it calls for - about 2 cups+, and add 1 cup to the macaroni, and mix 1 cup with about 3/4 cup of Panko bread crumbs, and put that on top before baking. Makes a great crust. A really easy pasta dish that is always a hit!

I made this for a casual dinner with friends last night. I used leftover ham diced very small and added just a little goat cheese because i didnt have quite enough gruyere. It was absolutely superb. From the 6 yr old to picky eater dad, everyone LOVED it!

This was a crowd pleaser. Very simple and tasty. I did not have any runny issues at all. It did sit out for 10 min before eating. Will definitely make again.

A great recipe that is simple and a crowd pleaser. I had the problem with it being runny as well, but tried it in a more shallow pan, and that solved the issue for me.

GREAT recipe, 2 things though that made it 4 stars for me and made mine not only solid, but runny only by virtue of melting cheese! the best kind of runny. First thing, I used a 3 cups of cheese. second thing, a touch of truffle oil makes a HUGE difference. And i used bacon too. But the recipe is good. really good.

I love this recipe, and have made it several times. and have not experienced the runny problem. Besides being delicious, it's simple to prepare. no food processor necessary. I usually serve it as a side dish with a nice bowl of minestrone or tomato basil soup. great comfort food.

Rating: 3
This recipe is delicious but flawed. It is indeed runny as many reviews say, though I solved that by using a slotted spoon to serve it. Gently frying the prosciutto, as one reviewer suggested, is a plus; it brings out the flavor of the meat and helps separate the pieces that stick together. Next time I'll make a roux -- as another reviewer suggested -- as see what happens. This dish is so good that it's worth reworking the recipe instead of tossing it in the wastebasket.

Wonderful recipe! I have made this a dozen times, followed the recipe exactly and have never had it come out runny as many reviewers have complained about! I weigh out the elbow macaroni instead of using a measuring cup, maybe it makes a difference. Also, I only cook the macaroni the least amount of time suggested on the package. That way it isn't water logged before you add it and it's able to soak up some of the cream and milk. I also don't think the cheese and prociutto clumping is a problem, just make sure you stir it together with a wire whisk and it all breaks up. I am a cheese lover and usually add extra cheese to everything but I don't need to on this recipe, it is plenty cheesy! Don't let other reviewers scare you, you wont' regret making this. It's delicious, and I get compliments on it every time I serve it.

I made a vegetarian version of this (sans prosciuto). It's very good. To avoid the problem of being runny I omitted the milk altogether. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream and it turned out great - in 20 mins. I also added broccoli. Next time I'll add onions and either cayenne or hot sauce as someone else mentioned. I add both to another similar recipe I make with cheddar.

Rating: 3
Halved the recipe (cooked in a smaller casserole dish) and it was still enough for four. Easy to put together, however this was not a spectular combo. The next time I make this, I won't add the salt to the milk/cream/cheese mixture; it was a bit too salty for my taste. Next time I'll add veggies and herbs to make it more interesting.

I followed the recipe but used a much small baking dish and cooked it for about 30 minutes. I broiled the top for about 4 minutes before taking it out of the oven and it was perfect.

This was excellent with two small changes. I made a roux to start the sauce, by mixing 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of flour as the base for the sauce (like a bechemel.) I also sauteed the prosciutto in butter for about one minute. make it more stable (less runny)

Great recipe. I didn't have the problem of it being runny like others have said. I just let it sit out for a bit to absorb the excess moisture when it was cooling. Rave reviews at my company BBQ. If only it were healthy!

Nice flavor, but somewhat runny. That was my only gripe.

Rating: 3
Delicious! We couldn't find Gruyere, so we used another sort of swiss cheese and it was great. I messed up and stirred ALL the cheese in with the cream, instead of just 1/3 of the cheese. So, then I sprinkled some extra grated parmesan over the top. But, the bottom half was much cheesier because of this, than the top half. It was still SO good and a big hit. Next time, I'll do it right! I also think it would be good with some minced onion added in and a bit more prosciutto, or maybe canadian bacon instead.

Rating: 0
pancetta works just as well - for faster cleanup just prep the prosciutto/pancetta like you would a tartar with two knives, and give a toss with minced fresh herbs before folding into the cream mixture

Solved the problem of cutting the prosciutto: Put it all in the food processor and pulse until it is diced. Super fast!

Fantastic! Also added sharp cheddar cheese and black olives which went very well with the prosciutto. Great comfort food.

I combined this with another mac and cheese recipe and the results were excellent: start by making a bechamel sauce (whisk flour and butter, add milk/half&half), add salt/pepper, dash of hot sauce; take off heat and add chopped proscuitto, sauteed mushrooms, and cooked chopped broccoli. Add the grated gruyere and mix with cooked macaroni. Put in dish and sprinkle with seasoned bread crumbs. Excellent.

This was tasty, though the texture was a problem. I made it exactly as written but it never did thicken up. Well, it did thicken up some, but perhaps not to my preference. However, all my guests raved over the dish. I may try it again, with some changes.

Delicious and easy. Made a double batch for New Years and it was devoured. Made it earlier in the day and just baked it when the time came. Wasn't runny at all. Cooked it for a bit longer than called for - everyone (kids and adults) loved it. I even had an extra pan of it that I refrigerated for 2 days and then cooked - still good, though I thought the original pan (refrigerated for about 6 hours) was a bit creamier. re: the proscuitto clumping - as I diced it I put it between sheets of waxed paper - clumping wasn't much of a problem. I don't really care for regular mac & cheese - but I loved this. Will definitely make this again and again!

Rating: 4
This has been a staple in our house since the month it came out in the magazine; children and adults alike can't get enough. It is rich, to be sure, but with salad and (in our opinion) white not too dry wine it can't be beat. Regarding being too runny, my suggestion is to take the 11x17" pan seriously, and if you double the recipe bake it in two pans. Also, use really good cheese. Regarding the proscuitto clumping, it's true but I just pull the pieces apart when I chop them and then mix them in slowly rather than in one big handful so all the pieces get covered with cream.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe today for the first time. I changed it a little bit so I'm not sure you can call it the same recipe. I used two strips of bacon in place of the prosciutto, and sauteed two cloves of garlic and 1/3 medium onion to add flavor. I also used swiss and sharp cheddar cheese in place of the Gruyere . Boy was it good, not runny at all. I plan on making it again and again. : )

My roommate said this dish was the best macaroni and cheese dish that he has had. For my tastes, it was overly plain. The best results I have had in making macaroni and cheese were with three cheeses--Gruyere, Asiago and Fontina combine well--but this dish will definitely be a crowd pleasure with good looks.

This is a fantastic mac and cheese recipe. To those who thought it runny, please follow the directions.

I changed around this recipie a bit to make it thicker. I made a roux with the flour and some butter, then poured in the milk and whipping cream and whisked until it was combined. I then added the gruyere cheese until it was melted. I then added the cooked macaroni, and stirred in the procuitto slices, then baked it.

The first time I made this dish, it came out so-so because it was so watery and light. The second time around, I made some slight modifications and got rave reviews! I took the advice of a previous reviewer and asked the deli person to slice the proscuitto 1/4 inch thick then cubed it into tiny pieces myself. I also used approx 1/8 cup less whole milk and added 2 ozs. more gruyere cheese into the macaroni. This time it came out PERFECT.

I made this recipe for a friend and kept a little bit to try at home. I put two ladles full of the noodles and sauce in small souflee ramekins and baked them in the toaster over for lunch one afternoon. Oh MY were they heavenly! It's the perfect Mac and Cheese recipe for sure. The other recipes that call for a white sauce including flour and butter always end up on the grainy side and they dry out as left overs. This recipe is perfection. No grainyness and SO easy and quick to make. Only downside is that it's high in calories. I'm going to try to make it next time with a lower fat milk and reduced-fat cheese just to see how it turns out.

WOW! I doubled the recipe and wound up with WAY too much sauce, but that's okay. We were ALL impressed with this stuff! I sprinkled a mozz-cheddar blend over the top to add a little more flavor and color, and it was sooo good! My sister and her family were over to watch the football playoffs, and this was the first thing they sank their teeth into. She then said, "I need this recipe!" Thanks for another great one! Oh, and doubling the recipe was just enough to feed 4 adults and 4 kids. I didn't use macaroni, as the store (surprisingly) didn't have any. So, I used some other kind, don't remember the name, more like a curly-q type (picture Shirley Temple's hair). Turned out GREAT!

Tonight I stumbled across a solution to the prosciutto sticking together, which i've also had trouble with in the past. although i normally don't buy things like pre-shredded cheese because they are lower quality and more expensive (usually), i saw diced prosciutto in the store tonight and tried it. it worked SO much better!

This dish is a sophisticated version of the comfort food we all love. The prosciutto adds a nice twist and lots of flavor.

Okay, the reviews that it was a little bland made me try and spice it up, but i did not do enough, so i suggest further. Main problem, it was too runny, but I did not measure any of the liquid ingredients, so that could be my errror, though i am good like that. Runny or not, it needs a little kick and my substitution of montery jack w/ jalepenos (1/6) and a sharp chedder (1/6) (in addition to gruyere (the other 2/3rds of cheese input)) did not quite do it. I also used pancetta instead and fried it up a little before adding it in. Yummy! I think next time i will saute some onions in the pancetta drippings and then add cream/milk to that to thicken a bit (and maybe a touch of flour). I also added peas, which was nice. I am trying to copy a Mac 'n' Cheese i had at Balthazar the other day - YUM!

This was good, but my husband and I like more creamy mac & cheese dishes. If I make it again I'll use a creamier cheese such as a white cheddar. Great flavor though.

I used this as a "base" and made the following changes: I used 3/4 cup sharp cheddar mixed with 1 1/4 cup TJ's four cheese blend (Parm, asiago, fontina and provolone cheeses).

I thought it was very good and very easy to make on a weeknight. Like another reviewer, I found that the prosciutto stuck together in several spots in the finished dish. I may try it again w/ canadian bacon or regular bacon, just so it doesn't do that. Also chopped tomatoes would be a nice touch.

Terrific recipe! I took it to several potlucks and it was gone in a flash from people going back for seconds! I made exactly as recipe was written and it came out perfect. I didn't need to cook extra time as other reviewers had written, in fact I think it would have been a bit dry if I had.

While this recipe was OK, and tastier than the classic mac and cheese, the mac and cheese recipe that's in the March '02 issue is so much superior.It's in the RSVP section and is from the Penisula Hotel's Belvedere restaurant in Beverly Hills. I don't know why that recipe isn't published here or in the RSVP section; it's soooo good!

OK - based on the reviews (and a lot of left over Easter ham)I made a couple adjustments. First I used 4 ozs Gruyere and 4 oz extra sharp NY chedder (yellow). The I cut the whole milk in half and substituted white wine. Finally I used Orechette pasta. I baked the dish until the top was lightly browned (about 40 min) then colled fro 15 mins. Excellent!

It was great! It was similar to a restaurant favorite of my husband's, so very well received by him. I found the prosciutto a little salty and might use less. We gave it a quick broil at the end to give it a nice cheesy crust. Destined to become a favorite in spite of calories!!

I prepared this dish twice; the first time, it was to-die-for delicious. I made it the night before, following the recipe exactly, except I added some extra cream. The following day, I brought the mac/cheese to room temperature and cooked as directed. It was perfection. It was the best mac/cheese I have ever eaten. The second time I made this, I was sooo disappointed. Again I followed the recipe exactly, but this time I did not make it the night prior. I cooked it and we ate it. The texture was all wrong. It was runny. It was bland. Has anyone experienced the same thing? Any comments?

I made this for my husband - he sort of grinned at me when I said I was making mac & cheese, but he fell all over himself telling me how wonderful it was, and taking note of where I stashed the leftovers in the fridge (this from a man who can't find it if it's not front & center on the top shelf). I found it a bit rich for a main course (I could feel my arteries clogging), but looking at the other reviews, I would take the suggestion to make it as a side dish in the future.

This was good, but not great. I thing you really have to like gruyere cheese. I thought it would be enough for a main couse since it had meat in it an all, but it is so rich it makes a better side dish. If I make it again, I wouldn't have the prosciutto sliced as thin.
