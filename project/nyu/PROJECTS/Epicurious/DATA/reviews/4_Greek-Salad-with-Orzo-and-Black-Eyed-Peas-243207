Excellent, very satisfying indeed. I'm preggers and this held me the rest of the work day. I have also tried it with White beans (had them in stock) good but I prefer the Black-Eyed peas more.

3 forks as written, 4 forks my way...the first time we made it I thought it was too vinegary so I added dijon mustard and tahinni the second time and thought it improved it. Also added chick peas and used Farro instead of orzo to healthy it up...good stuff!

nice blend of flavors, some bites are lemony, some vinegary. The lettuce adds a much appreciated crunch. this recipe ages well

Got some fresh organic black eyed peas from my farmbox program and didn't know what to do with them. So many pea recipes call for various applications of pork fat, while tasty, were too heavy for this sultry coastal Georgia evening. So this was a very delicious version of a Greek salad and great use of the peas! Didn't have fresh parsley or oregano, but had plenty of mint from the garden. Family doesn't like peperoncini, so I used just plain old green bell pepper. Since my peas were fresh, it needed some salt. Also used a lot of fresh ground pepper. Very yummy paired with planked tuna and fingerling potatoes roasted on the grill!

Like most of the other reviewers, I just mixed this up in a bowl instead of making the jars, and I left out the romaine. It's a great summer dish for a light, fresh and quick dinner.

I do this often, and often substitute black eyed peas for chickpeas and the dressing for a tahini base sauce with some water added and it's delicious. Great healthy lunch, done in 5 minutes, with tons of flavours. Much better than a regular greek salad! Also changed the feta for goat cheese.

I have made this recipe three times now....time to review. Lovely, although I don't serve food in glass jars. Presented it as a composed salad, chopping the romaine in chiffonade. This was a hit with the rest of the meal. Great for the Hollywood Bowl dinner too!

This is a great recipe. Easy to make and delicious. I followed the recipe pretty close. Served as part of a greek menu theme dinner. Did not use jars, just layered in glass pyrex.

Delicious! Didn't use the romaine because I wanted more of a "bean salad". Added thyme, a can of chickpeas, and a can of blackbeans. The whole huge bowl was devoured!

Delicious! The only thing that I would do differently next time is to use less oregano - it was a little overpowering.

Very nice fresh flavors and very open to adaptation to what you have around. I had quinoa (not orzo) so used that, and couldn't find black-eyed peas so used a "bean salad" mix from a can and it turned out lovely. The fresh herbs, the acidity from the lemon and vinegar, the tangy saltiness of the feta and the earthiness of the beans all combine to make a lovely side salad for 4, or a main salad dish for 2-3.

We've made this several times for company, and its always a hit. Fresh, super tasty, with lots of different flavors and textures. I'm making it for vegetarian company again tonight!

I have made this salad to take to an outdoor movie festival and for at home. It is delicious! I added chopped grilled chicken as a layer and that made it a dinner salad and the leftovers were great for lunch the next day. My two teen age sons love it as well.

Great recipe! Used mint instead of parsley, 1/2 yellow pepper instead of peperoncini, and skipped the romaine. And I just mixed everything together instead of layering it. Delicious!

Great recipe, easy to make. Love the idea of doing this for dinner and weekday lunch the next day. Will try with couscouse rather than orzo next time.

Substituted mint for the parsley and oregano because I didn't have either. Also no tomatoes. But still yummy!!!

Made this for a work party, so no cute glasses, I layered it in a larger container. Delicious! I was lucky enough to have some fresh oregano growing in my herb garden...really made the orzo layer sing. So easy, yet so tasty! My 11 year-old daughter took some for lunch and she loved it, too. Can't lose with this one.

this is really good. If you like vinegar type (like 4-bean, etc.) salads, you'll love this. I leave out the red onion since it can overpower a dish, but other than that, it is really good, and good for you to boot. I can eat this for all day. Definitely need to the romaine to add the crunch.

Orzo and black eyed peas and feta? I never would have thought of that combination. It turned out great. I wish I had had some fresh oregano. I think that would have made it even better. Like others, I did not use romaine and included a red bell pepper. Delicious.

Rating: 4
I did not layer this, instead assembled the black-eyed-pea mixture separately to allow for the 15 minutes of marinating and the orzo mixture in another bowl, combining the two and adding the feta. I omitted the romaine (which I added the first time I made this and it seemed very out of context with the rest of the ingredients, perhaps due to not layering) and pepperoncini's. It is a fabulous salad!

I made this salad for a family dinner and everyone loved it. People were calling me the next day for the recipe. I mixed everything together instead of layering them. Other than that no changes were made to the recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe! So easy to make, so healthy, so surprisingly delicious. I think the type of orzo is key...I like Barilla (rice shaped) vs Davinca (small circles). Be sure to cook al dente. I used low fat feta. Didn't have jars...no problem. I think I will invest in jars when I make it for family and friends.

this is making it into our regular rotation of salads for weeknight dinners. fast. easy. delicious. works as a side or can "beef up" with a larger portion of greens to make a large entree salad. may add a little more vinegar next time.

I've made this so many times I've lost count. I tried it once using kidney beans and it wasn't bad but the black eyed peas really make the dish. Great for a potluckit's always the first dish to disappear.

A delicious variation on Greek salad, also makes a meal in itself. Took to summer potluck & guests raved. Have substituted with chickpeas & used stelline (tiny star-shaped pasta). Highly recommended!

delicious! just made it tonight for a light, easy dinner. i don't like olives so i omitted those and chopped up some asparagus to put in it as i had some in the fridge! absolutely delicious!

This is a fabulous and easy recipe. Would add more tomato next time, that's just my preference. As another reviewer noted, I added fresh basil insteqad of parsley. I had on hand and just like it better. The orzo and black-eyed peas not only turn the salad into a main dish, but soften acidic sharpness of greek salads I have had in the pasrt. I do not understand the point of layering in a mason jar. Even taking this on a picnic, I tould probably just mix and store.

Made this for Easter dinner and thought it was very good. I used garbanzo beans instead of black-eyed peas, other than that I followed the recipe. It is a nice make-ahead salad. I refrigerated the lettuce, orzo, and beans separately then layered them in that order in a large salad bowl shortly before serving. Feta on top and peperoncini around the side. The salad holds up well although the flavors are more muted the second day. I'm not a big fan of orzo, might try couscous the next time. I also think arugula would hold up well as a base and add additional flavor. This is one to play with.

So easy and yummy! I haven't tried layering it, I just mix everything in a bowl. It's really good. The lemon zest really makes it stand out from other main course salad type things I have tried.

Love this salad, as recommended by another user, I use Roasted Red Peppers instead of Tomatoes. I also love the way this salad looks, it is great for picnics or pot-lucks. http://gingerlypig.blogspot.com

I was skeptical at first, since it *seemed* that there were so many steps, but quickly realized the benefit of having a healthy layered salad for the work week that could be prepared ahead and doesn't require more than one container. PRICELESS. I will definitely make this again, and try different variations of flavor and ingredients.

I had to adjust this recipe for someone with a fairly restricted diet, but it still came out excellent. No one suspected that I had to doctor it for dietary reasons. I omitted the romaine, used french green lentils instead of black eyed peas, two roasted red peppers instead of the tomato, peeled the cucumbers, and tossed the feta with the pepperoncini "juice" instead of putting whole peppers with the dish. Was excellent and will make again.

In my previous review, I meant to say that this recipe has virtually no oil - not none, as I stated. The point is that the salad is not drowning in oil, as is often the case.

I have made many fantastic recipes from this site, but this one simply stands out. I made this in desperation to get some nutrition into my 15 year old daughter, who is a vegetarian whose diet consists mostly of Diet Pepsi and cookies. I made the salad just for my family, so I did not bother with the mason jars, but simply layered it into a bowl. Every time I turned around, my daughter was eating another bowl of this salad. Both she and my husband raved about it, and they want me to make it often. So many Mediterranean salads contain a lot of oil, but this one contains none. Also, the contrast between the layer whose acidity was provided by lemon juice and the layer whose acidity was provided by vinegar was very interesting. For this last reason, the only thing I would have done differently would have been to store the different layers of the salad in different containers and let people layer their own as we ate it over the next few days. At some point the salad that I had layered became completely mixed, and it lost some of its impact.

This is one of my favorite Epicurious recipes to date. The ingredients and flavors are so simple but the combination is wonderful. Each bite holds a new surprise. I have made this recipe many times and have found no need to change a thing. Very nutritious and simple to make. I'm considering adding this to Thanksgiving dinner for my vegetarian in-laws.

Though I was skeptical about the black-eyed peas, they worked! I served this on dinner plates using the romaine as a base, left out the peperoncini, and substituted basil for oregano because that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, I made everything according to recipe. Delicious! The lemon zest in the orzo was especially refreshing.

i've been trying to make more vegetarian meals to cut down on our meat consumption, and this salad was perfect for that. i made a few changes. i swapped chickpeas for the black-eyed peas and i skipped the peperoncini. otherwise, i made as directed, though as a salad on a plate rather than in a mason jar. i put lettuce down first, then chickpea layer, then orzo layer, then cheese on top. it was a nice, light summer meal.

I made this with a few changes to accommodate my son, who loves orzo but loathes black-eyed peas. I prepared the orzo layer as directed, with an extra tablespoon of oil in the dressing to better balance the flavors. I added a pound of thinly sliced grilled chicken breast and some halved grape tomatoes, and used feta cheese with Mediterranean herbs. Delicious as is or with the chopped romaine. I may make the original version after he returns to college!
