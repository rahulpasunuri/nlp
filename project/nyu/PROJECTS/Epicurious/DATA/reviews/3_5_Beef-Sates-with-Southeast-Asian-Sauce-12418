we marinated cubed pieces of tenderloin overnite in the sauce. they had a great flavor right off the grill - you should try to serve immediately if possible. the sauce did lack kick. i would add fresh jalapeno...and perhaps cocunut milk to thicken it up per another reviewer's suggestion.

I followed the recipe exactly,using tenderloin. As soon as I complete this review, I'm deleting the recipe from my recipe box. What a total waste of good tenderloin!!!!!!

Yum! The sauce was tasty, but runny. Next time I'd thicken it with a bit of coconut milk. Marinate overnight instead of 15-30 min for a much better flavor.

I substituted Kansas City Strip steak sliced for skewers, marinated 4 hours. Extremely tender and tasty.

Delicious! I made this as as app for a bridal shower. Everyone loved it, esp. the sauce. I marinated the beef overnight and used another reviewer's suggestion of using 2 T sesame oil. Definitely upped the flavor. I tried the leftover sauce with grilled chicken, but I think it was better with beef.

Delicious! Didn't have the corriander. Served it over a bed of jasmine rice w/ a side of stir-fried string beans. Really nice flavor & very fast.

This was easy and delicious - my guests loved it! I would have eaten the sauce straight, with a spoon.

Have made this receipe many times. I agree with the reviewer above who substituted sesame oil for vegetable... you can use spicy sesame oil andd leave out the chile pepper flakes. I use the sauce on fish, rice, chicke - and I always get raves.

This recipe did not strike us as anything too good. the steak itself turned out excelent although the sauce did not taste as good as it seemed to some of my guests. The ingredients themselves are some of their favorites, but they did not go well together. I personally liked the sauce, but it wasn't something to make once a week.

Yummy! As a twist, I used 2 TBS sesame oil and 1 TBS vegetable oil which gives it a great flavor. I do this as a main course with rice and it's fabulous. The dipping sauce is great over the rice.
