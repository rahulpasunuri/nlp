I made these in my rice cooker and used short grained rice and ground pork. I was impressed with their visual appeal, however their taste in general wasn`t out of this world. I`d made it again for a Chinese-themed meal though.

We really liked this -- both because it makes a good visual presentation for a party and because of the taste. I used regular short grain rice with good results.

Can easily be made in a rice cooker. Adding a couple of chopped chillies gave them a bit more taste; otherwise slightly boring (and only worth two forks).

This came out pretty bland. As my Husband put it - "Steamed Hamburger???". That sums it up for me. So many better recipes on Epicurious.com!

I couldn't find the "sticky rice" so used short grain white. They look nice when done, the rice sticks out like porcupine balls! I also served it with soy sauce. They were equally good right from the oven and at room temp.

this turned out very bad. i was so excited to make these but i'd have to give it a thumbs down. i think i'll try using sticky (glutinous) rice the next time to get better results.

a winner with the family. the recipe seemed bland so i used pork sausage and seasoned the mixture with season salt and pepper. also believe using the sweet rice makes a difference, as it gives a sticky chewy exterior. a doubled recipe however, only fed 4. (three boys though). oh, and serve with soy sauce.

Very good. I used 1 1/2 lb hamburger with McCormick Meat Loaf Seasoning and followed package directions (2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 2 slices crumbled bread.) Because of the eggs in the meatloaf mix, I omitted the 1 tablespoon of egg white.
