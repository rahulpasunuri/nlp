This is a good sauce, and the suggestion to mix the last piece of butter with some flour is a very good one--I too like my sauces to have a little body. Regarding the onion and thyme, I say coarsely chop the onion and leave the thyme on the stem, then strain it all out into a small pot after the broth has reduced. Whisk in the flour-laced butter, and you're in business! PS: Cracks me up that recipe writers add pointless notes like "for a change of pace, use rosemary instead of thyme"--WOW! REALLY?? ;-0

Okay, so the sauce needs a little work, but this is too good not to experiment with! It's amazing with any breaded meat, and it'd probably be amazing with a pan-browned veal. This is not supposed to be a super-rich sauce, but lighter and earthy with a touch of acid, more to bring out the flavors in your entree than to stand on its own. Here are my recommendations: 1) Never, never use cooking wine. Period. And don't over-salt. There is enough salt in the butter and most good stocks that only a dash or pinch extra is needed. The reduced wine is flavorful enough, but just the right amount of salt seriously perks this up without getting briny. 2) I cut my onions to near-mush with a mandolin slicer, so they cooked down very fine. I wouldn't recommend pureeing, however. They have to be big enough to brown. 3) This is meant to reduce on medium-high heat. If you don't pause in the middle and set your stove at about an 8 if you're on an electric, it cooks almost exactly to schedule. Twenty minutes is totally worth it for this sauce. 3) I upped the thyme. It brought out the body in the wine a bit more. 4) When incorporating the butter at the end, mush some flour into the butter first and incorporate the paste a little at a time. It doesn't need much thickener, but it needs something to let the sauce adhere to the food without making your entree soggy. Flavor-wise, this was a perfect addition to the mustard-seed-crusted pork medallions. Cook these paired and you'll see what I mean.

No amount of butter, [added] flour or exceptional quality wine would make this sauce work. It takes a very long time to reduce, and even then it does not achieve any richness in texture or taste. I'd recommend going back to the drawing board on this one.

For some reason this sauce took ages to reduce. But it was worth waiting those extra few minutes, because the finished product was rich and tasty, and went really nicely with lemon-thyme chicken breasts and garlic smashed potatoes.

Maybe I missed something, but this recipe was very vey thin. The flavor, however, was lovely. I think next time I will add some flour to thicken the sauce.

Although the flavor is good (I added a little more butter at the end)I didn't like the onions in the final sauce. Next time, I would probably double the recipe and stain it before serving. Also, shallots may give stronger flavor than the onions.
