Have made a few times w/ gorgonzola and dried cranberries instead of dates. Used a ton more of toasted walnuts and parsley. Even those who don't like "blue cheese" raved.

sarahduncan10 How can you rate a recipe that you changed so much? Cheddar cheese instead of blue? That's like substituting chicken for lobster.....this kind of review really messes up the ratings system.

I made this for a group of 6 and had plenty leftover. Next time, I would divide the mixture and make two medium-sized cheese balls instead of one large one. I used 2% milk instead of buttermilk, gorgonzola cheese instead of blue cheese and increased the amount of dates. Incredible flavors and an impressive presentation!

I made this for a Xmas work family day to rave reviews from everyone! Changed quite a bit due to personal taste - replaced blue cheese with grated cheddar, dates with chopped dried apricots and cranberries and just used normal milk and finely chopped onions. Highly recommend and will make again!

This was the perfect party food! Great for entertaining! It was easy to make in advance, and all of my guests raved about it. I will be making this again and again!

Was a little skeptical about this one but was pleasantly surprised. I would like to try it with the cranberries as suggested by the previous reviewer. I actually had a few special requests to make this one again.

This is a good recipe - adding more dates was a good idea. Next time I will sub dried cranberries for more zing.

This is really delicious - I made it for a wine party and it was a big hit. I used 2% milk because I didn't want to buy a carton of buttermilk just to use a tbsp of it. I don't think it made a difference. I would use more dates next time.
