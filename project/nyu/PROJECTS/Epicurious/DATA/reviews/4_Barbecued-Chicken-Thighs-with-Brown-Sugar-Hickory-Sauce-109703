I just felt like barbecued chicken this week and found this recipe. My butcher has HUGE chicken pieces, so I made a half recipe for two thighs and two legs and basted the chicken on the side away from the heat, rather than the side facing down. Phenomenal. I do think, though, that the recipe underestimates the time to cook dark meat. My first turn was 15 minutes a side, followed by 5-8 minutes a side with the sauce. Delicious, and I have enough sauce left over to do two more pieces for myself.

Yum, Yum!!! I've made this recipe, exactly as written, using chicken thighs and ribs and it's delicious with both. If I had choose which I liked best, I'd pick the ribs. It will be my "go to" rib sauce from now on.

Excellent! A keeper! Baked in the oven.

I love a tart, yet sweet, sauce and this was it! The lemon seems excessive when you are adding it but it is not. I give this a 10 out of 10.

The sauce was king at the dinner party - beautiful flavors meld wonderfully together and made the chicken a winner!

Great sauce! Used this on skinless chicken breasts that I brined overnight in 10 cups water/2Tlbs kosher salt/1 cup brown sugar, as well as on some cajun sausage. We grilled - not baked. I made what I thought was extra and not a single bite was leftover.

Excellent! The sauce is so delicious. Very simple and quick to make. Did not make any changes to the recipe. Don't think I will - it's great just as it is.

I made these thighs today - they were so good! I was consulting several bbq chicken recipes because I had a craving and settled on this one. However, another mentioned brining, so I stuck the thighs in a 1/4 cup salt-2 quarts water solution for a few hours. I also took the skin off, as I'm watching my figure. I'm not sure what made the difference, but this chicken was absolutely great! I made this for a lunch party and everyone ate 3 thighs a piece and loved it! I was quite gratified. The sauce is delicious.

I'm still in seach for the prefect BBQ recipe, but this one will do for now! Baked some thighs in it, it was quick and easy.

We enjoyed this quick recipe for "homemade" bbq sauce. I made it in the oven since it was raining that night but I'm sure it would be even better on the grill.

I had planned to BBQ this chicken for my in-laws after a long day of sight seeing...turned out we were out of propane and it was much to late to get more. Instead of BBQ-ing it, I baked the chicken without the sauce in a 400 oven for about 35 minutes, draining the fat from the baking sheet once. I then dredged the chicken thighs (and drumsticks) in the sauce and baked it for another 15-20 minutes. It was so tasty that my mother-in-law brought the recipe home with her! I served it with baked sweet potatoes and a salad...yum, yum.

The sauce. Oh man... the sauce. Just give me a spoon, a straw, a shallow bowl and a napkin, I'll just make a pig out of myself and lap it up. The sauce makes the dish. Great on pork as well as chicken and who knows whatever else.

The sauce is tangy and sweet with a hickory flavor. I added a little more hot sauce and some Jack Daniels to the sauce and it turned out wonderful. It is also great to dip fries in and top hamburgers with.

This was great! One of the best bbq sauces that I've made and tasted. A definite keeper.

Okay, but nothing to write home about....

Very good sauce. I used a combination of boneless skinless breast and legs. Both were good. Can't wait to use the leftover sauce on a burger.

The sauce is fabulous! I've made this recipe over and over again, and each time, my family raves. Considering that they are not chicken lovers to start with, the raves are even more significant! I found that my thighs needed more time than the recipe called for, but I think that the time element is dependant on your individual grill heat and the size of your chicken thighs. Try this recipe -- you'll keep it in your repetoire.

This was quick and easy and made a good mid-week meal.
