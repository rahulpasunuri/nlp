This is an excellent orzo salad, even without having all of the 100% correct ingredients. I used anchovy paste and artichoke hearts that were not marinated. It's good by itself, but over the arugula makes it excellent!

I've been making this dish for years to rave reviews. I usually add half again as much orzo as the recipe calls for and I skip the arugula. I double (or sometimes triple) my adjusted proportions to make this for a large crowd. Best served with a chilled, dry white wine. Honestly, years after eating this salad, people remember it.

I doubled the recipe and used all of the ingredients as listed except half the mustard because I'm not a mustard fan. I loved the dressing and the overall combination of ingredients/flavors. Mixing in the arugula really brought it all together for me; it was the perfect complement. That said, I think the dressing got a bit overpowered by all of the ingredients (orzo, tuna, veggies) once it all was mixed, but perhaps that has something to do with doubling it. Also, it took me a long time to prep, but I imagine that could go faster when I make it again in the future, which I will.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, except used a little extra tuna (two 5-oz cans) and substituted baby spinach for the arugula. Making it a day ahead is key to let the flavors blend. It was a big hit at my potluck!

Great salad! So nice to give the stove/oven a break on a summer night. Most ingredients keep well in pantry or are staples in our fridge. Will surely make this again!

I can't find arugula in the store off-season, but find that baby spinach works instead. Sure, the taste is different, but not bad. In a pinch I've also used canned green beans instead of fresh, and dried thyme instead of fresh. I'm sure it is a pale comparison to the original recipe, but it is still a family favorite.

I always get lots of compliments when I bring this salad to potlucks. I usually don't add onions. I sometimes put in more tuna.

Easy, Fast & Full of Flavor! What more could you ask for? Plus it's easy to improvise.

This recipe provides a great starting point. One can easily switch fish or veggies to taste. It's the basic idea of a cold orzo salad with flaked fish and herbs that's most important. Good recipe? Sure. Useful recipe? Absolutley.

I had high hopes for this recipe. I love salad Nicoise... however, this was a real dissapointment. It was a big bland mess of flavors that did not mix well. I followed the recipe as written. I used the best quality ingedients. But it did not work for me. The dressing was bland. The orzo was bland. I would much rather have had a composed salad, where I could enjoy the olives, tuna, pepper, yes, even the anchoivies - one by one instead of mixed into this mess. I do NOT recommend this.

I have made this several times using both canned albacore and fresh seared tuna. Both great. Very nice presentation for luncheon or light dinner with crusty rolls and dessert. I add a little more garlic, red onion and some parmesano-regiano cheese. This is one of my favorite recipes and the ingredients are readily available even while traveling.

It was easy to make and tasty. I used parsley because there was no arugula, and added feta and capers. it was delicious. plus sorta healthy.

I have made this several times and it is a staple -- I think it is much better made a day ahead and served at room temperature. I do it exactly as the recipe reads -- great as part of a buffet. Very fresh tasting.

I used this recipe as a guideline to make a Nicoise type salad. Due to simply not having the specified ingredients in the cupboard - I made the following adjustments: I omitted the anchovies in the dressing. I used penne pasta rather than orzo. I used marinated peppers rather than artichoke hearts. I added capers and cut, seeded tomatoes and cucumbers.I omitted the arugula and thyme but added shredded fresh basil. Overall the same idea (!) and absolutely delicious as a summer course.

An excellent and easy meal to make. I ommitted the lemon juice and still found the dressing to be quite tart. I also added steamed baby potatoes and a boiled egg, in typical nicoise fashion. I served it to a girlfriend who doesn't eat fish, canned or otherwise and she ate it all!

DELICIOUS!!!

I feel like a new person now that found ORZO...this is easy and wonderful on the palate...I used edamame beans and added capers...a little bit of the south of France on a cold Canadian night...Magnifique

We have made this 3 times this summer and simply LOVE it. We omit the anchovies and use spinach in place of arugula. We have brought this as a side dish to a picnic as well as a main course for dinner on a hot day.

Nice, semi-interesting salad. It's quite tart and I would omit the lemon juice entirely. A little bit too much prep work for a pasta salad. Didn't use arugula (don't care for it) but used Italian parsley instead. Might be good with crumbled feta as well. Would make for a good pot luck dish.

Very easy to make - AWESOME! I used hearts of palm instead of artichokes. I also used yellow peppers to add color. My husband and sister loved it!

Rating: 3
I liked it a lot...my husband wasn't crazy about it. I think it'd be a better side dish or a potluck dish than a main dish. You get tired of the flavor after awhile. I used spinach instead of arugula and canned tuna.

Besides prep-work (chopping, etc.), this salad is really a nice one to have on hand during family weekends when someone is always rummaging around for something to eat or on hot summer evenings when you don't want to be in the kitchen. I used albacore tuna packed in olive oil for added flavor.

Rating: 4
I also used smoked trout which I think made the dish. I skipped the arugula as what the store had in stock looked pretty sad. Didn't miss it. I think it would be perfect for taking to a party as it travels well. It needs to be made a day ahead and I don't think it needs to be brought to room temperature.

I used poached salmon and did not use the olives (too strong) and served with homemade bread. The result was AMAZING! So delicious, my girlfriend and I polished off more than half the recipe in one sitting!

Excellent recipe! I used instead of caned tuna, leftover tuna steak and added some leftover vegetables. It was a great success with my husband. I will make it again.

While this was a good meal, it was not knock-you-socks-off stellar. I did make it with smoked tuna, too.

Excellent recipe!!! I love this salad is actually my favorite. I have made it many times. For the dressing I avoid the add the red vinegar because it is a little strong for me.

Sorry to spoil the 100% rating for those who would make this again(and again). While I found this recipe to be pleasant, I have had better orzo salads. I do agree, however, that it probably would benefit from the smoked trout or salmon.

Outstanding. We've had this several times already. I took one reviewer's suggestion and used smoked trout--now I wouldn't do it any other way.

I used a pound of flaked poached salmon because I don't like the canned tuna flavor. I'm giong to try halibut next week it's in season and on sale in the North West.

I used 8 oz. of flaked smoked trout instead of tuna, because we enjoy the trout. All else was the same, and we loved it. The orzo was a different touch from the potatoes in most Salad Nicoise recipes.

I made this last night and it was a huge hit. I had no leftovers. I used even less thyme than the recipe called for and I would not use any next time(no pun intended).Great, nutritious meal.

This was excellent, everyone liked the orzo with it. I substituted balsamic vinegar for half the vinegar and used less oil. I'll make this again.

surprisingly good. I left our the onions and it still tasted great. But then I used my own home pickled olives that added something special. I would try to make a little more dressing, the pasta tends to soak it up. This is truly an excellent dish.

This was one of the greatest salads I ever had. A wonderful summer meal.

I substitued risotto for the orzo (rinse the risotto after making it so it isn't too gooey). It is a great dish for a hot day but can also be reheated successfully in the microwave as a hot side dish. Friends raved over it.
