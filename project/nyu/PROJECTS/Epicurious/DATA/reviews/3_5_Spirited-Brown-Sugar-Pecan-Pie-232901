I was looking for a pecan pie recipe that didn't use corn syrup (did not have any on hand). This turned out to be a tasty and easy pie recipe. Was even a hit with my picky 4 year old nephew. The only item I omitted was the cinnamon. Still turn out great!

I been making this recipe now for 4 thanksgivings in a row and it is amazing! It is super high in sugar but it contains no corn syrup which my mother is allergic to. I add rum instead of scotch, we like the flavor better. Enjoy!

Absolutely wonderful! So nice to have a pecan pie recipe sans the corn syrup.

The pie tastes good but suffers from a very unappetizing appearance. It took more than an hour to bake.

I've made this pie twice now, with the following changes: I used Jack Daniels bourbon in place of the scotch, and added 1/4 tsp ground cloves. In place of 2 cups dark brown sugar, I used 1-1/2 cups dark brown sugar, and in a liquid measuring cup: 2 Tbs dark molasses, and then dark maple syrup to equal 1/2 cup. I have found that with the change of brown sugar to maple syrup, I needed to increase the cooking time to 50 minutes, or even more, if cooking two pies in one oven. I shake the pies to make sure they are "set". The addition of the molasses and maple syrup makes this pie decadently rich and with a complex flavor. A definite favorite in our holiday baking repetoire!

I left out the Scotch and the cinnamon, and it was *still* wonderful! Better than Costco! 8 ) I only had golden brown sugar on hand, so that's what I used, and the pie turned out quite dark and rich. I'll probably stick with that, because I don't think it needs to be any stronger. Also, I doubled the recipe, but only had 7 eggs - it turned out just fine. Love this pie!

I made this with a homemade crust and 2 tablespoons of bourbon. People said it was the best pecan pie they'd ever had!

Perfect as is- no need to change a thing. The only ingredient I forgot was whipped cream and had to make a dash to local gas station convenience store for vanilla ice cream. (Home made whipped cream would have been the ultimate.) I read all the reviews and realized the person whose pie did not set up, probably did not put the oven rack in the center of the oven-- be sure to do that, remember, heat rises. I did and mine set perfectly. I even pre-baked the crust a bit. Served it up for our Nova Scotian guests after a yummy jambalaya. (Both got rave reviews.) The Scotch flavor isn't overwhelming as I feared-- all it calls for is a tablespoon. (You could just buy a nip if you don't have it in your cabinet.) Now what am I going to do with the bottle of Dewars I bought? Hmmm- perhaps hot toddies on a head cold night this winter. Happy Thanksgiving!

Very yummy. I made the recipe into bars instead of a pie by using a 9 x 13 pan and starting with the shortbread crust (cooked) from the "apple betty squares" recipe on this website. Then I doubled the pecan pie filling in this recipe, poured it onto the shortbread crust and baked for an hour. Came out perfect! I also finely chopped half of the pecans to give the filling a different texture. Great flavor, and I love that it doesn't use corn syrup.

I have made a ton of pecan pies. I've been looking for a corn syrup free recipe to try out. This is wonderful and less intensely sweet than my usual stand-by recipe. I pre-baked the crust a bit and used Bourbon instead of scotch....yum! Mine baked up in 40 minutes in a pyrex pie plate.

My dinner party guests and I found this pie far too sweet. Having eaten it, I would agree with the other reviewers that orange zest would be a welcome addition to cut through the heaviness of it. We also felt it would work better as more of a tart (not so big in height) as it was just too intense for us.

Killer pecan pie! Out with the old corn syrup recipe - this is a keeper! The top gets a nice crunchy crust, and the toasty pecan flavor stands out against the complex caramel and whiskey custard. My filling set up fine - this is what I did: deep-dish dark glass pie plate, purchased crust that was just big enough to fold over lke a tart crust,baked in a 360 gas oven for about 46-48 minutes. There was 2-3 TBS of filling left over after filling the shell to the brim. It puffs up 1" above the rim, but settles as it cools. This is wonderfully rich, easily 10 servings with a little whipped cream, and good hot coffee. Try it!

Ok, I was told that this was the best pecan pie that our Thanksgiving diners had ever tasted. Orange zest brings out a nice flavor on the second day. Not too sweet and one diner said the texture was perfect. I made some substitutions which are in my previous post. I will keep this recipe around!

Having never made a pecan pie, I searched for a perfect jumping off recipe, and this one appealed to me. Had to make a gluten free crust, so made one with macadamia nuts and pecans. Left off 1/2 cup of sugar in favor of pure Maine maple syrup. Decided to use rum instead of scotch and also added some orange zest to the mix. Baking in the oven now and smells amazing. Happy Thanksgiving!

I read all these reviews and decided to stick to the recipe about 95% of the time. The only thing I did differently is parbake the crust for about 5-7 minutes and I cooked it for the additional 15 minutes everyone recommends. After all that, the taste is great, definitely not too sweet and with a nice complexity of cinnamon, whiskey and a caramel undertone from the sugar. BUT, the inside is not completely cooked! I tried the fork method and tried and tried until it would stick to the fork but it never did and the pecans on top started to look dark dark brown...in a bad way. So my advice? Stick to the recipe, it's a good one. Definitely use the foil collar around the crust to keep it from burning. And please, figure out how to cook it all the way through! p.s. mine wasn't runny, but could have been a little firmer. Thanks!

I just made this yesterday, substituting bacon instead of pecans. REALLY good. The cinnamon was just the right thing to cut through the richness of the bacon, sugar and eggs. Could have used more whiskey, but I'll chock that up to taste, not as a fault of the recipe.

I'm an impatient person. I drive quickly, I think quickly, I talk quickly, I make decisions quickly. Therefore, letting this pie cool all the way to room temperature was torture. And then....it was still syrupy in the middle! And the crust (Pillsbury) was still a touch unbaked in the middle. Next time I'll be baking 50 - 60 I think. And possibly blind baking the crust. But the flavor though....oh the flavor. Not cloyingly sweet like your "normal" pecan pie. I used Macallan 12 Year for the scotch and the caramel and spice notes in it play SO well with the pecans and molasses from the brown sugar. I will be making a few of these for family Thanksgiving. It's a keeper.

Very happy with this recipe. I used spiced rum instead of my bf's very expensive scotch, used very dark sugar but subbed out the last quarter for a glug of maple syrup because I don't like overly sweet things. At 40 minutes the top was puffed up and cracked and I thought I had ruined it, but as it cooled the top sank back into the crust and I guess it firmed up. It was AMAZING - not gummy at all, the texture was dense and eggy, like a custard, with a rich earthy flavour and a satisfying crunch. I used a tenderflake store bought crust (which was smaller I think then the dimension for the pie here b/c I had leftover filling which I poured into 4 tartlets today). So easy to make -- just whip up all the ingredients and pour!--- and so unlike--much better than-- any pecan pie I've ever tasted at a cafe.

I'm not usually a fan of pecan pie; it's too gooey and heavy and sweet. But while this one is rich, there's a complexity to the flavors (thanks, Cutty Sark!) and textures that elevates it to something kind of sublime. I did do some substitutions: For one of the cups of sugar I substituted a syrup I had made from 1 c. turbinado sugar, 1/3 c. water, and a pinch of cream of tartar (which yielded less than a cup of liquid); I added more pecans than called for; and I found out too late that I didn't have any pre-made crust lying around, and I'm lazy, so I slapped a flour tortilla on the bottom of the pie plate and called it good. This minimalist crust actually made for a nice contrast to the density of the filling. Everyone had seconds. One tip: obey the recipe when it says to cool the pie completely. Otherwise you're looking at nuts swimming in syrup.

i made 24 of these pies for our thanksgiving buffet. it is the best recipe for pecan pie. We only used 1 1/4 cups of nuts in our 8" pies. I like the goo to nut ratio to be heavy on the goo! I also parbaked the crusts to ensure a crips crust. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Alright, as i said i would report back. I thought that this pie had great flavor and was not too sweet at all. i would reduce the nuts by 1/4 cup, and make it the day before.

I am going to try this pie out soon and report back, i like that there is no corn syrup. To the question about making it ahead of time, yes you can and should so that it has enough time to set (maybe the day before) any longer than that and the crust will start to get soggy.

I loved this recipe. Couldn't be happier that Thanksgiving is back so I can make this again. I'm glad to find a pecan pie recipe that isn't too sweet.

I made this without the whisky in deference to my alcohol-flavor-sensitive friends, still it had great flavor.

A very good pecan pie, everyone enjoyed this. I baked it for upwards of an hour... waited for it to puff up and tested it with a fork, first test the fork had syrup dripping off, not done; second test had gooey filling clinging to fork, done. No residual granularity. I don't think I found this less sweet than a corn syrup version, but I was happy to avoid the jelly texture you get with a corn syrup filling.

I found this pie to be way to sweet and with a sugary texture! I did substitute the egg white with energ-y egg replacer, but added the yolks. The pie I made also still had the granulated texture of the sugar.

Just made this for a party and it was a huge hit! I used my own crust (the vodka crust) which I cooked for about 10 mins at 375 with pie weights first. Also doubled (or maybe tripled) the bourbon...

Best Pie I've ever had. The corn syrup makes pecan pies overly sweet and I do not like the gelatinous texture. I used fresh pecans I picked down the street and roasted them for about 10 minutes first. Everyone who has tasted this recipe has been impressed. Corn syrup pies are fakers this one is the real deal.

I followed this recipe to the letter and found (like loranac from Grapevine) that the 40 min. cooking time was not enough. It ended up somewhere around 60 minutes for me producing a pie that had a firmer consistency. Really odd. I'm wondering how different ovens can produce such different results. Anyyyyywaaayyy...the pie was delish! We all loved it. Sidenote: Its really cool to find a recipe without corn syrup. Do you know that light corn syrup contains high fructose corn syrup? Hard to get away from that stuff.

I have a recipe I've made faithfully every Christmas since I've been married from the Marlene Sorosky Desserts book. It's fabulous, but with so much to do this Christmas, I decided this recipe might be an easier version of that old favorite. I'd have to say it's every bit as good, just not as fussy. Think I'd rather try it with a homemade crust, though.

I have always made pecan pie with corn syrup, but was excited to try this one! It sounded delicious, it tasted delicious; unfortunately it didn't thicken at all and ran all over the plate once cut. It was more like eating pecans with syrup...why? I had such high hopes, any ideas.

I'm wondering if I can make this the night before serving. Do I leave it out overnight or refrigerate? Thanks for any suggestions you may have.

Easiest pie ever, providing you follow the recipe's advice and buy the crust.

I served this pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was a big hit. A definite winner!
