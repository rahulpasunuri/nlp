I should start by saying I am a Samoa freak. They are my all-time favorite cookie. I made this for a party in the hopes that it'd taste exactly the same. It didn't. It was too chocolatey. A lot of work, a decent payoff. Other recipes (i.e., Quick Pecan Tart) are exponentially better.

I enjoy finding new recipes to add to my "sweet tooth" collection. Next time I need to take a treat to my sister's school, I'll make sure to include these yummy treats.
