Good. I used balsamic in place of the red wine vinegar. Don't skip the eggs. They add alot to the salad.

Yum! I also added the balsamic to the vinaigrette and a wee bit o' sugar and it was delightful. And I used comte for the cheese element. Delicious nuttiness. And I used sweet, little grape tomatoes. And I'm so happy I have leftovers waiting for me at home tonight.

Delicious! I did make the following changes. I added an ounce of balsamic vinegar, cut the oregano to 1 tsp (which I thought was plenty) and added a tsp sugar. I also added jicama (family favorite) and cut the onion down to very little (personal taste). I will make it again very soon!!

Dressing is super easy to make and delicious. Very refreshing for a hot day.

Very, very good. Did add a bit of balsamic, but left recipe unchanged otherwise. Would be good for a light lunch. If you are not a garlic lover, you may want to keep it to one clove.
