I messed up on the recipe. I added both cukes to the tsatsiki. I ran out of Grecian yogurt and had to add sour cream. No excuses. Stupid mistakes. Yet the meal was wonderful and applauded on all sides. I can't wait to do it right.

I made this recipe with fresh chicken but followed the recipe other than that. It was fresh and healthy and pulled together quickly. But it was boring. The "salsa" was better on its own. The tzatziki was just ho-hum. And the chicken was just ho-hum. Together it was a pita full of blandness. I love me some gyros but for me this recipe was forgettable. Sadly, I won't be making this again.

Refreshing, flavorful, healthy and another great recipe for using up leftover roast chicken. I used naan because it was what I had, worked nicely.

This recipe was lovely, easy to put together and lots of flavor. I didn't have roasted chicken, but put some boneless breasts on the grill and cut them up and it tasted great. I used full tomatoes and skipped the lettuce. Used garlic Naan from Whole Foods which tasted great warm. Would highly recommend this recipe!

I thought this recipe was SO good. I made it for my mom and dad for dinner the other night. My mom is a cucumber hater, but I thought I might be able to convert her with the great tsatsiki sauce. Unfortunately, she said,"It's only okay," but she ate the whole sandwich. I still felt like this recipe was a success. I loved it! I'll make it again for myself and everyone else I know who loves cucumbers and raw veggies! If you love greek food, give this recipe a try.

mmmmm. This is a wonderful recipe! Love the lightening of one of our "junk food" faves: the gyro!

My parents, husband, 6 year old daughter, and teenage step kids all LOVED this recipe! I grilled the chicken rather than broiling it. I used the exact recipe for oil, sauce, and "salsa". I bought some of Trader Joes pita bread from the bakery (kind of dry) AND the frozen Naan (perfectly delicious!). Both were great, after being heated in the oven with that oil brushed on, but we all preferred the Naan. It was moist and chewy, rather than dry! I will definitely make this recipe again some day (when I have a lot of time, because it took several hours).

I used this recipe as a springboard. Used pickling cukes and grated them for both the salsa and the tzatziki. Didn't have mint, didn't feel like buying mint just for this recipe, so omitted it-- didn't miss it. Same goes for the parsley-- never use enough of it to warrant buying/growing it. Finally, in my finest moment of inspiration, used dried oregano and fresh rosemary. Generously seasoned both sides of chicken breasts (pounded thin and basted with a tiny bit of oil and fresh ground salt and pepper) which I then threw on the grill. We used store-bought garlic naan-- but if you have a Mediterranean grocery, go and get some pita!! They should carry the good kind used for gyros in Greek joints, not the horribly flat, dry, crumbly pocket pita kind that are only good for toasting and making chips out of.

Rating: 3
Even in the summer this is a delicious recipe; I will make it again when I have more cukes and tomatoes than I know what to do with from my little suburban garden. I did make a couple of changes - regular english cucumber, less mint (1/3 cup seemed overwhelming to me) and fresh rosemary and oregano on the chicken - time enough for dried herbs in the winter. Also, I only reluctantly eat those grocery store bought roast chickens and had no extra self-roasted at home. So instead I got two chicken breasts, poached them and then browned them in the infused oil - it was lovely. A relatively simple meal, that I shall make again.

Made this for my foodie friends. It was a winner and I will definitely make it again. I too followed earlier suggestions and added the extra ingredients to the salsa (amandacrumley - first page of reviews). I would double the rosemary oil for the naan bread so that there is more seasoning for the chicken.

Rating: 3
Made this today and it was quite good. I will definitely make it again. Best to start the day before, though, as it took a lot of prep time. Followed the recipe exactly, but added feta cheese. Could not find naan bread or pocketless pita, but agree with chowfornow that the garlic oil and toasting made for delicious results.

My naan bread wasnt very good so that made a difference. The chicken I used from store also ruined it. It was more my fault than the recipe. The salsa was great and yogurt sauce was wonderful.

Loved this! It takes a bit of time but is so worth it!! I used pocket pitas (which the recipe says not to use) but when they are broiled with the garlic oil they get very soft and delicious!! All the flavors reminded me of an amazing gyro I had in NY.

The chicken wasn't bad but even with marinating overnight the flavour just wasn't much. However the rest of the recipe was very nice

Absolutely loved this! I adopted the salsa suggestion made from another reviewer as well as using pita bread. Since I already had a rotisserie chicken, I simply used that. Because there are only two of us I cut the recipe down a bit but still had plenty of the tsatsiki & cucumber salsa. However, it was so good that we made fast work of it! Because there is so much prep involved, I would say to make the tsatsiki and cucumber salsa ahead of time. Next time, I will try it with the naan but I didn't feel the recipe suffered using the pita.

Outstanding, easy, tasty! As is the typical review...had to substitute. Used light sour cream in place of yogurt. We live in Mexico, a yogurt loving country...as long as it has sugar in it. Cut back on the garlic because as good as it tastes, it doesn't taste so great the next day. And I skipped the onion. Used frozen Naan bread from Trader Joe's and just heated it in the oven. Excellent meal that will become a staple in our house. We dubbed this dish "Greek Tostadas"

Firstly, this gyro recipe is fabulous! I made this for 4 totally different palettes - mine (not particularly fond of gyros), my husband (not real fond of feta or Kalamata olives, an American tenant (meat and potatoes kind of guy), and my Saudi tenant. I was going to follow the recipe exactly until I read several reviews regarding the salsa made by amandacrumley, so I printed her review with the recipe and made her salsa rather than the one in the recipe. Believe me, it is flavor-packed! I also included in her salsa recipe the mint and the parsley called for in the original recipe. I was also going to follow other people's footsteps and buy rotisserie chicken. But the owner of the Mediterranean market that I went to insisted that I use Shawarma chicken seasonings (that I bought in his store). Instead, we grilled the chicken with the Shawarma seasonings - so divine! The different levels of flavors from the tsatsiki, the Greek salsa, the Shawarma chicken and the fresh pitas from the Mediterranean market made a gyro believer of me. You absolutely must try this recipe. Everyone said they were the best gyros they had ever had! I totally agree with them.

this could not have been more delicious, and i highly recommend this. i took the chicken and lightly grilled it. i then shredded it and tossed with the oil flavoring.

We were so surprised on how good this recipe is. I made the tsatsiki and the salsa the night before, using freshly picked Kirby cucumbers from my garden. I grilled boneless skinless chicken thighs and shredded them. We had pitas at home so I used it in place of naan. Just before serving, I wrapped the pitas in foil and heated them up in my toaster oven. I made a half batch of the oil with herbs and tossed the chioken in it to heat. I split the pitas and opened the pocket. Spooned in some chicken, then salsa and topped it off with the tsatsiki sauce. We ate the whole thing - it was that good and an excellent use of cucumber abundance.

SO DELICIOUS! Makes great leftovers! I don't know what a kirby cucumber is. I used normal cucumbers. Worked great!The tsatsiki was amazing and so was the salsa and they both tasted better the next day. Next time I will make these in advance and let their flavors develop overnight. I HIGHLY recommend using naan!! Trader Joe's sells delicious naan. Also, I've found that a lot of the indian restaurants around me will sell fresh (homemade!) naan by itself. i just call and ask and go pick it up! easy! SOOO EASY & SUPER YUMMY!

This is an excellent quick and nutritious meal. I added fresh dill, Greek olives and reduced fat feta. I also used raomaine and red leaf lettuce and lemon wedges. My husband is hooked!

My family loved this recipe but we used oiled and heated flour tortilla's recently instead of pitas or naan and it tasted fine. I also made a side green salad with spring mix and romaine and skipped the ice berg in the gyros. I also used roasted chicken and roasted is my favorite choice in this recipe.

I made this last week on an unseasonably warm evening and it was a huge hit, with everyone going back for seconds and even thirds. I did roast a chicken first which may have helped. I made the recipe exactly as it's written, except for cutting back on the onion as recommended. I added extra garlic to the tsatsiki and actually thought it was too garlicky. The only problem is that it's a bit messy to eat. We ended up making open-faced sandwiches, but it wasn't the prettiest thing to watch.

This was delicious. I've made it twice, but I had to cut way down on the onion because it was too overpowering. The naan really makes it.

This was fantastic, even though I had to make quite a few changes out of necessity. First, I didn't have any leftover roast chicken, so I poached a breast and 2 thighs in chicken stock. This seemed to make a good amount of meat. My red onion was rotten so I used yellow. I didn't have any fresh mint or parsley so I used dried and threw in a handful of fresh cilantro just to have some kind of fresh herb. I'm sure this will be even better when I make it again the right way! There was one change I thought this needed however, and that was the salsa. It seemed bland when I tasted it, so I added a lot more lemon (all the juice of a medium lemon) and a drizzle of olive oil, and that really punched it up.

We made this almost exactly as written (roasted our own chicken and used an extra cuke in the tsatsiki) and it was a perfect weeknight meal - nice, light but satisfying.

Great recipe. Easy prep, even for a sad novice like myself. I used the following marinade for the chicken. It seemed to go really nicely with the rest of the recipe: two small/medium yellow onions (grated to a pulp) five tblsp of greek yogurt two cloves of garlic (minced) squeeze of one lime salt and freshly ground pepper 1.5 lbs of chicken thighs (boneless) The chicken marinaded overnight. I made the tsatsiki and the salsa, browned the garlic, and prepped the bread. Then I grilled the chicken on the bbq. After the chicken was done, I tossed it in the garlic oil. This was probably over the top in terms of richness with the extra oil, but it tasted really good. I used a spear of romaine lettuce broken in two and stuck into the salsa instead of iceberg to give it a little more drama. The wife loved it, so that is what counts.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to make it as printed. My teenage family loved it. The only thing I did was make the nans instead of buying them and cut the tomatoes in eighths instead of quarters and I did decrease the onion in the salsa as our family doesn't like "spicy". We unanimously decided that the homemade nans were a big part of the success. Next time I'll see if draining plain yogurt is just as good as the Greek style. I thought it would be quicker to put together but there is a lot of chopping for the salsa. This is a keeper.

Made this for dinner tonight. Tsatsiki is the star in this dish. We used chicken breast. We would probably marinate before cooking next time and add some crumbled feta cheese to our plate.

The salsa could be a lot more dynamic...I make a Greek salsa regularly and serve it with grilled pita and delicious lamb sausages from a sausage shop in my neighborhood. For my salsa, I chop and mix together: tomato, cucumber, red onion, pitted Kalamata olives, roasted red &/or yellow peppers (from a jar is fine) and crumbled Feta cheese. Add 1 Tbsp olive olive, 1-2 teaspoons red wine vinegar, 2 teaspoons dried oregano, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste (capers and anchovies if you really want to boost the taste). This offers a much more colorful and flavor-packed salsa that is good enough to scoop up with pita chips or serve as a side salad.

I was beside myself with excitement to try this. And it was delicious. I would put tsatsiki on everything, though, so take my opinion for what it's worth. I liked every part of this... but I think I could do without the chicken. There are so many excellent flavors that the chicken just seemed like it was in the way. I would have absolutely no hesitation to do this as a greek-style salad and flatbread and maybe swap the chicken for chickpeas for protein. (Actually, I think doing a mashup of this recipe and the grilled pitas with greek salad recipe from May 2007 would yield a most excellent salad.) Or somehow work together some homemade hummus and tsatsiki with the salsa part. I don't know - I think there's a lot of room to play around with this and make several different delicious version. When we made it, there were leftovers, so I just ate it as a salad (no bread) the next day for lunch and was quite happy. Definitely will make again, probably with some changes.
