Made this for the super bowl and everyone loved it. Prepared as written but added a little cayenne for spice (red pepper flakes would've worked also). I think the key is making this in advance, as it tasted much better after sitting in the fridge for a while. But my favorite thing about this recipe is leftovers! It makes the best sandwich spread ever.

Fantastic dip. So simple yet so very delicious with some good quality bread.

Straight out of the food processor, I was not impressed. After some time in the fridge however, this dip gets AWESOME. Flavor peaked after two days in the fridge. Plan ahead if you're making this for a party.

have made it for some time now, but have always "cheated" and used marinated bell peppers from a jar. Yesterday I made it for the first time with roasted bells. WOW, what a difference! I won't go back to the jar variety - ever.

This has become a staple when we entertain and friends love it. I just pulse the ingredients in the food processor to leave the dip a little chunky. It's too easy to be soooo good.

Good but not exceptional. Made exactly as stated, but added a splash of lemon juice.

If you want to steal the show with a simple appetizer, this recipe is the best thing to have in your back pocket. And what I love even more than the "oohs" and "ahhhs" you get when people eat it, is getting to tell them how simple it is, and how few ingredients are involved. I usually make this for smaller gatherings, so I do one broiled red pepper, 1 Tbsp of olive oil and 1 clove of garlic in the food processor (easy to remember 1:1:1), plus 1/2 cup of feta. I also make my own pita chips, which seals the deal. Take 5 pitas and use scissors to cut them so each pita gives you 2 rounds. Then while all the rounds are stacked, cut them into chip shape triangles. Put the triangles smooth side down on baking pans. Brush with 1/4 c. olive oil and sprinkle kosher salt on top. Cook 350 for 6 minutes. Flip the chips and do 6 minutes more. The combo of the dip and chips is really good!

This recipe remains one of my top favorite recipes of this site. It's so tasty and so darn quick and easy to make, there's no going wrong. If I'm in a time crunch, a jar of roasted red peppers works just as well, and I don't need as much oil if I go this route. I also add paprika to taste - the extra kick makes a difference. Always a crowd pleaser and I'm always asked for the recipe.

This turned out watery even though I cooked down the red peppers after processing them. I'm going to try this as a mousse, thickened with Knox gelatin and molded in a loaf pan mold.

This dip is pretty good but nothing incredibly special. It might be a good accompaniment to a Mediterranean-themed meal but on its own with other starters, it was severely outshone and ignored in favor of other foods! Disappointing.

This was just OK. I agree with the other reviewers that it was somewhat bland. I added some red pepper flakes and lemon juice and this did help. It has potential, but needs some doctoring!

Fast and easy. A good dip to make ahead for a party. I had some serious foodies in the crowd and they loved it. I thought the dip needed a bit more complexity, so I added a squeeze of lemon juice and a little cayenne pepper, but honestly, it was great without as well!

This sounds too simple to be so good but this was awesome, followed the recipe exactly. Remember if you chill this before eating, let it come to room temperature because all that oil will make the dip appear curdled or broken if it's too cold.

I halved the amount of olive oil, which seemed to still be plenty. Got very good reviews by everyone who tried it.

This dip was far from impressive. Especially considering the cost of the ingredients. I made it along with a few other snacks and it was hardly even touched. There are much tastier dip recipes on this site.

I thought this was yummy! In such a simple recipe it is important to use excellent quality ingredients.I omitted the garlic after the first time as it overwhelms all the other flavours and I added a touch of cayenne. Everyone I serve it to loves this!

I modified this recipe to make it better to my taste - out of the box I found it too bland. I also use Jarred roasted peppers, however and I use the Herbed Feta, and the juice of one lemon. It really picked up the flavors with no extra effort. My friends love it / beg for it etc.

I know this is not the Gourmet style, but I did not char my own peppers; just used a jar of them, which had its own oil, so I did not add much extra olive oil. But this is a great dip, different from and lighter than the typical cream cheese and whatever; so easy to make; terrific with toasted pitas or raw veggies. A keeper.

EASY!! Did add cayenne and paprika for a kick! Will try jarred red peppers next time for different flavor but will make it like this again. Followed it to a T and came out great! My husband wanted only it for dinner!!!!

I'm going to be making this again and last time I thought it was pretty good but my guests loved it. I roasted the peppers (put them in a bowl covered with plastic wrap or in a bag for several minutes after roasting so they shrivel up and then peel them when cooled). Add a touch of lemon juice to give it that "je ne sais quoi".

Very good; I used bottled peppers and added a bit of smoky paprika. Leftovers were good in a sandwich.

Rating: 3
We really liked this. I roasted my peppers over the gas stovetop and put them in a Pyrex saucepan, so the skins slipped off easily. The smoky taste is not something you could get from the peppers that come in a jar. Also used low-fat feta, and did not need any salt.

Rating: 4
YUM! I made this for a get together last night, and everyone raved about it. I added the zest and juice of a lemon, along with the fresh basil on the advice of another rater--it really made it pop! Two of my friends asked for the recipe. Next time though, I might buy jarred peppers, as I found getting the skin off them after roasting to be a pain.

OK. This is weird. I friggin' HATE bell peppers of any color, and I liked this. I tried it because I didn't have anyone there to see if it needed pepper or salt (no salt needed, a little pepper). I was shocked to realize that it is really good. I'm making it again for a reception for our newly ordained priest, and I'm sure it will go over well.

So easy and tasty too! I replaced the smoked red peppers for bottled pickled sweet ones because that's what I had on hand and the results were lovely. A great snack to eat and watch Survivor!

Great and so easy. I made a few additions that really helped it out. I added a little chopped fresh basil and the juice of 1 lemon plus some lemon zest to add little more complexity - both a bit of sweet and sour added to the dish.

Hey Everyone - this is one of my favourite recipes for special occasions, but a previous reviewer was right - it is missing something for sure. The recipe I use adds red wine vinegar, a dash of sugar and a dash of cayenne pepper to the red peppers and feta and doesn't include garlic - it isn't necessary to give anyone reason to avoid it...! Try it this way, and you will love it with some homemade toasted seasoned pita chips...

Made this for our New Years Eve bash and it was a hit. We made it with fresh roasted peppers, but I can see that jarred would also be good. The only change was we added extra garlic. I agree with the person who said the quality of the feta is key.

Delicious! I have been in search of a great red pepper dip for a long time, and this definitely fits the bill. I halved the recipe, but kept the garlic the same (2 cloves) - otherwise, I made it just as written.

My guests enjoyed this and the parmesan olive oil dip immensely as appetizers. Only altered the recipe slightly by making a 1/2 blue cheese 1/2 feta mixture and salt to taste. Served with warm crusty ciabatta bread.

This is simple and was a big hit with guests Saturday night. I am a simple person and didn't modify but may use some of the earlier suggestions next time. Simple, quick and ability to make the night before were the hits with me.

OOPS! Forgot the olive oil when I made this! After it was together, tasted and added a healthy pinch of cayenne and 2 of paprika. 24 hrs later: it came together and is great! With the oil it probably would be a good dip; even with my error it is very nice on French bread or crackers although probably slightly more chunky than the original.

I have a question for "fabmselle from TX" regarding the "Muhammara" dip from the December 19 Gourmet magazine. I checked the website for the recipe, but could not find anything close to this. Can fabmselle, or anyone else, please give the link, or recipe for this. Thanks.

I added lightly salted cashew nuts to the mix. The nuts gave it a sweeter side with more texture and substance.

This recipe is okay is you don't have many ingredients on hand. But if you want the best, most WOW red pepper dip, try the Muhammara recipe on this website from Dec. 1993 issue of Gourmet magazine. It doesn't get any better than this!

This recipe always gets great reviews at parties, but the key is to use a good quality feta cheese. Not all feta is created equally, which could be the reason for the bland taste of the dip made in the previous review.

I added some toasted pinenuts and chopped basil and it came out great. Served it with calamata olive bread for dipping. Definitely best eaten the same day. The garlic flavor gets a little too intense the day after.

This is very easy to throw together, and it's tasty. If I can make a suggestion-- use greek florina peppers for a better flavor. A few brands like Peloponnese sell jars of roasted florina peppers, and as a greek, I always use those when I can. They are sweet but have a nice bite to them.

Simple and good. Jarred red peppers from Trader Joes work well. Drain before using.
