I did a lot of substituting for this and still got aces results. The market had no halibut so I used haddock; I thought I had tagliarini but didn't so used fettuccine. As a side I cooked up some broccolini. All in all a fine dish, although I think next time I'll add more garlic and fewer anchovies.

I happened to have 2 halibut steak and decided to make it. I used what I have in the fridge. I didn't have parsley or garlic, just used green onion. I also use Sauvignon Blanc as the white wine. I don't have a pot that can go into the oven at 500F, so I changed the oven braise into just low heat stove top braising. I used Casarecce instead of Tagliarini. The recipe was easier than I thought and it came out great. I saved some for lunch the next day and microwaved it up, just as delicious as the previous night. I'd recommend just braising everything in stove top and save time and energy.

Excellent--as long as you like robust dishes. There are lots of variations to play with. I briefly sauteed 1/2 pound of large shrimp and set them aside while going on with the anchovies, wine and fish, per the recipe. Then I arranged the shrimp in circular fashion around the fish and on top of the pasta 5 minutes before the fish was done. It added a terrific dimension to the dish. One other point: a dry rieseling is definitely the wine of choice. Most other whites won't stand up to this dish.

The basis of this recipe is good. It does however require modification to bring out more flavor as well as enhance it visually. First the visual; I used Pasta Nero (sepia ink). The bright white of the fish is brought out on the bed of black pasta. Pasta Nero also adds a different flavor to the dish. Combine that with the addition of pine nuts and fresh rosemary, and more wine fior the pasta to soak and it becomes a stellar creation. Lastly, we find that the fish itself needs more salt.

This is a tasty, healthy, and quick dish for a weeknight meal. I love the idea of using the halibut steaks as they are usually $1.00-2.00 less per pound than the fillets. If you have trouble finding tagliarini, I use dried Farfallone from Francis Coppola. You do have to cook it about 15 minutes to get the right consistency but it is very hearty pasta.

I like the idea of this recipe, but unlike the other reviewrs, I was not happy with the results. The flavor is very one-note: fishy (even with a very good, fresh piece of fish). We spruced it up with capers, chopped tomatoes, and extra lemon, but it was still somewhat tasteless.

This dish was very easy to make and it was wonderful. My 9 year old son who is very picky loved it, he said it was the best fish he ever had. Just be sure the pasta is completely submerged in the liquid so it doesn't dry out.

My children won't eat fish, but they ate this. It was wonderful....I used tilapia, since that was what I had. very good, light tasting, flavorful dish.

Very good. I would, like one of the other reviewers, add more garlic -- maybe twice as much as called for. I love the anchovy flavor and might even add an anchovy or two. Lots of black pepper is good, too. Pretty in shallow pasta bowls or in soup plates.

Fabulous dish. We made our own pasta, doubled the garlic and added a cup or so of water in the final baking phase to make sure the noodles were submerged. The halibut sort of fell apart while I was trying to serve, but the flavor more than made up for my poor presentation. We can't wait to make it again. Great, light, easy, fun... a real keeper.
