I used my Kitchen Aid mixer and had no problem with the dough. I let the machine knead it for four minutes and then finished it by hand. It was excellent. My Italian family loved it, its definitely a keeper. I used rosemary and less sugar as well as seedless black grapes.

Despite 2 false starts due to dead yeast and having to hand-seed concord grapes, this turned out very good. I, too, cut back on the sugar - 2 tbsp raw sugar per layer, added some chopped fresh rosemary - 1 tsp per layer and would add more next time, and topped with 1/2 tsp kosher salt. There is no note how to deal with the VERY STICKY kneading step, it was stuck to everything and I'm sure I added way more than 1/2c extra and probably overworked the dough scrapping it up from the counter and off my hands. In all, will make again...thinking with champagne grapes.

This recipe is *almost* perfect as-is. Only changes I made were to use coarse sugar (and much less, maybe 1/4 cup total inside and out) and chopped fresh rosemary. Outrageously delicious.

This tasted pretty good but I had one major issue - the center was just wet and soggy while the outside and bottom burned. I could have taken out of the oven a lot earlier but the middle was essentially raw. So for next time I have a lot of grapes, I might make it again, since the part that was perfectly done seemed yummy, but would change it to only have half the amount of grapes as a topping, and place foil on the edges when they get brown. The dough was easy to work with though.

Wonderful! I made this for Christmas Eve dinner, to great acclaim. I wanted it a bit more savory, so I sprinkled both a little raw sugar and a little kosher salt over the grapes, and sprinkled chopped thyme and rosemary over the two layers of dough. I had no problem rolling out the dough. Be careful not to let the honey touch the yeast prior to it dissolving. I will make this again and again - a show stopper!

This is a wonderful treat that we look forward to at harvest time each year. I've been making this recipe for our annual "meeting of the purple feet" grape picking and stomping, for the last 9 yrs., and it is a huge hit! . I dont roll the dough, I just treat it like pizza dough, and stretch it out for the bottom, and then again over the top, it helps to press it into the edgest to get it across. Also use parchment paper, as it is pretty sticky, esp. the grapes that come thru to the bottom.

I prepared this for clients. I added rosemary to the mix and used ordinary table grapes. I thought it was very good and worth repeating.

The dough task can be daunting (especially since the best focaccia is actually quite a sticky dough and difficult to work with.) I suggest using a typical focaccia recipe (one featuring a goodly amount of olive oil) and topping with the grapes and sugar, not layering them. Use a hot stone & peel *to transfer* (heat stone it for at least 15-20 min. before placing the dough atop)and watch carefully, adjusting heat as necessary to prevent sugar from burning. Rosemary is a wonderful topping with the grapes, as is fresh thyme. The more you experiment, the better you'll get at judging texture & consistency of the dough.

Although I'm a pretty accomplished cook, I fully admit to being a relatively rookie baker. That said, this recipe didn't work for me at all. The recipe was simple enough, and everything went fine until I tried to roll-out/stretch-out the dough. It wouldn't budge. I knew enought to wait 5 minutes, but I still couldn't shape the loaves without tears and lumps. Putting the second half on top of the first was even worse. After all the work I had done, I threw the mis-shapen trapazoid in the oven despite its awkward appearence. It baked up very unevenly (no surprise), the two parts didn't come together as I expected, and it was overdone within 25 minutes. My very kind wife ate a piece without a word, but the remains will be fed to the birds. Next time I'll try a different focaccia recipe.
