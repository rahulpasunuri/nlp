This was a simple dish, perfect for fall flavors, and very simple to make. Used ground cardamom instead of the pods. Ginger and cardamom added exotic flavor to a vegetable that can end up boring. Wondering what else could be done to extend this dish.

Recipe is perfect as is....we now have them at every special meal. Making them AGAIN for Easter to go with our lamb. It compliments any meat entree.

Great vegetable dish! Agree with cook who said to watch cooking time, I did not cook as long as recipe suggested and had the right tenderness. Also found that one cup of broth (I used vegetable) was plenty, maybe because I reduced cooking time and it didn't steam off. Anyway, I prefer to keep the carrots sitting in broth as it helps them retain their heat.

I made this for a dinner party and thought it was a big loser, not enough sweet such as honey or sugar. The next day one of my guests called and wanted the recipe for her husband . . . he loved the carrots. Go figure.

THe carrots were too soft so I'll be reducing the cooking time. I'll also chop the ginger finely for more flavor. I may even throw in a little cayenne for more spice.

Okay, I am laying claim on this dish..lol..from now to family and friends...this will be known as Pam's Carrots. ;0) I fixed a real killer dinner for my husband on Valentine's Day...and these carrots stoled the show.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was so well received that Mom had me make it again for Christmas dinner so that the out-of-town family would enjoy these lovely root veggies, too! I used "rainbow" carrots from Trader Joe's, which as the name implies are a myriad of reds, yellows and whites and somewhat sweeter than traditional orange carrots. Very tasty, unusual carrot dish.
