These cookies were easy to make, but the flavor was bland. I thought that other reviewers might have some suggestions but, unlike me, most liked this recipe. I will not make them again.

These are so salty.

We really like these cookies. I rolled 1" balls and got 16 cookies. Used reduced sugar strawberry preserves...delicious. Did reduce the cooking time to 8 minutes on the first round and 7 minutes on the second round. I think it's a great peanut butter cookie base for any cookie.

This recipe worked quite well. I followed it almost exactly, except I reduced the cooking time to 7 and 7 minutes instead of 10 and 10. Perfect!

Have two Marines that come hom occasionally. They love these cookies and now I make them to take back to the base with them.

Just tried this recipe and it came out great. I doubled it, went a little light on the flour, used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy, and boysenberry jam instead of grape. I also made the indentations a little bigger so I could fit more jam inside Super tasty!

Not a bad recipe, but not stellar either, cookies were slightly dry and recommended baking times left them a bit dark as well (though my oven thermostat could have been off). The perfect pbj cookie is still out there somewhere.

these were pretty good. i was disappointed in the presentation though - the jelly melted over the edges of the cookie and into it leaving a not too pretty result. the idea is great but it just didn't look appetizing.

fun to make with my six year old. I doubled it and added the flour with a light hand to prevent dryness. probably 1/8 c scant on the dry ... turned out great!

Um...who cares! Just double it! I haven't tried it yet, but sounds great!!!!

Is it me, or does this recipe in no way make 30 cookies? I rolled 1" balls and got 11! They came out pretty good, but a little dry.

What an easy and amazing cookie recipe. I made this for my boyfriend who is a fan of PB&J although I'm not - I loved these cookies. This is definately a keeper!

Very good! Moist dense cookie, great for five year olds to roll in sugar all by themselves.I always tend to undercook cookies like this to keep them soft, and I added the jelly at the end and it worked out fine. I left some plain.

We've made this recipe over and over again at our house, and the kids and dad love them! Dad's a PBJ eater, but the kids are not. Even my pickiest kid in the world loves them. We make them about twice as big as called for, and stick with the stated baking time. I usually make a double batch and watch them disappear. Not everyone we've offered them to has been quite as enthusiastic, so I guess it's all a matter of preference. I always make them with an assortment of whatever jellies we've got open, so people can choose their favorites.

Good but not great. I'd be happier with regular ol' peanut butter cookies. I baked them for about 8 minutes at each step rather than 10 and they came out fine.

This recipe was very good, but my advice is to use grape jelly b/c i only had raspberry jelly and it wasn't as good as grape jelly. Also, 6-7 minutes cooking them make them just perfect. I would recommend this recipe to anyone it is yummy and very easy to make!!!

The timing set up to bake these cookies is way too long. I went through several sheets of cookies before I was able to figure out the timing. The first set should be no more than 6 minutes and the same with the last set...otherwise, you will burn the cookies.
