A tasty and fast stock but, if you want to use the giblets for gravy, a lot longer simmering time is necessary. I further cooked my giblets in water (after finishing the stock) for 45-60 minutes. The reason I used this particular recipe is that the amount makes 4 cups and I was cooking for two people. Perhaps the old-fashioned way is best after all - a long slow simmer.
