Hello, I'm hoping someone can help me. I am planning to make this for a dinner party for 25 this weekend and I don't want to use individual ramekins. If I were to double the recipe and bake it in a bigger dish, what would the baking time? Thanks very much!

The lemon turns this ordinary dessert into extraordinary. Easy and delish!

My mom considers herself a creme brulee connoisseur and this recipe passed with flying colors when I made it for her. It was so easy and came out beautiful. Two notes though: It only took 40 minutes for my custards to set, and I had 6 ramekins, not 8. I couldn't find golden brown sugar so I used turbinado sugar. It took a lot longer to caramelize under the broiler and was pretty uneven. I'm going to try out another sugar next time. Is golden brown sugar common or does it gave a different name?

This fantastic Creme Brulee with fresh raspberries was enjoyed by several friends at a wonderful maritime dinner. Definitely a keeper!

Sinfully rich with a light lemon and creamy texture. I use a convection oven so the tops were nicely browned. I cooled in 'fridge and then to room temp. Topped with raspberries and blackberries that had marinated in creme de casis. Torching the tops would of been perfection. Easy..keeper.

I had reservations about the lemon, guess I'm a creme brulee purist, but as soon as I tasted this delightful version I thought - LEMON! GENIUS! I strained the peel out of the milk as I whisked it into the yolks and sugar, seemed easier to clean the strainer that way. I halved everything because I wanted only four servings, but then the cups (which were the suggested size) were each only half full. We ended up having two each! Next time I'll attempt to fit a full batch into four cups. If there's any leftover uncooked custard it can be used in waffle batter. Also, the four cups cooked in 20 minutes, and cooled in an hour (outside rather than in the fridge). Will make this regularly!

This recipe tastes great, but i can't ever get the broiling right. I now use a flambe kit from dessertsnow.com & it comes out perfect every time. No torching & great aromas

WOW! This is a wonderful dessert. I took a chance and made this for the first time for a new book group. There was talk of licking the bowl, licking their neighbor's bowl - you get the idea! I rarely write reviews but just had to for this one. It's my new go-to dessert. Oh, I did use Creme de Cassis because Chambord is pricey, and I did a standard white sugar top and chilled for about 15 minutes instead of brown sugar.

I was a bit concerned about these brulees when after 40 minutes or so I peaked in and found that the tops of them looked a bit foamy or curdly. I was afraid the oven hadn't cooled down enough from the roasting I had been doing before. In the end, however, the brulees were creamy & delicious and not the least bit curdled in how they tasted. Perhaps the tops looked that way because I incorporated too much air in them when adding the cream to the eggs or because of some reaction of the acid in the lemon to the cream? Regardless, this is a tasty dessert- even without the Chambord which I didn't have on hand.

Made this for a large dinner party. People loved it. Pretty easy to make. Make sure you don't put the berries on until the last second, so as to preserve the sugar crust texture and be sure to drain them of the liquor as much as possible.

Yum! I divided this recipe in half for a family of four and it turned out great! Very easy, and everyone loved it. I used fine lemon zest, and next time I will just use large strips of lemon zest to make it easier to remove. I used the recommended amount of egg yolks, and I like the way it turned out. I used my oven broiler, but it took at least 4-5 minutes at 500F to get the sugar good and brown.

This was wonderful! I cut the recipe in thirds, as it was just for my husband and I. I used a vegetable peeler to peel the lemon zest, making it easier to pull out later. I also added a cinnamon stick to the cream while it simmered. I cut the sugar in half and added a tbs. of honey and it came out amazing! Will definitely use as a base recipe for other creme brulees in the future!

Rating: 4
I agree...this is wonderful! I increased the cream by 1/2 cup and added 2 egg yolks as I had 9 guests to serve. I used the same amount of lemon as called for in the recipe. This is creamy and smooth with just the right amount of lemon. The rasberries in Chambord takes it over the top. I have often made the Ginger and Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee from this site to rave reviews, but this may be my go to recipe from now on!

This is a great recipe! I disagree with the other reviewers and say that extra eggs are not needed. Be careful if you use smaller ramekins --baking time will have to be decreased to prevent burning. I used a teaspoon less of lemon peel, and still had a refreshingly lemon-y taste.

This recipe is delicious, however, mine came out rather liquidy. I think next time I make it I will use 8 eggs instead of 6, as another reviewer suggested.

I am so impressed with the way my creme brulee turned out! I'm not a great cook by any means but this recipe was simple and if I can do it and have it turn out like it came from a five star restaurant, anyone can. The only thing I adjusted was the egg yolks. I used 8 instead of 6 becaus e on other recipes' reviews everyone said 8 egg yolks and 3 cups of cream is perfect... and it was! I'll make this over and over again now.

My first try at creme brulee. It turned out pretty good. I made the mistake of straining the creme before I added to egg mixture. Instead of straining the custard. So not creamy perfection, but still very good. I made 1 and 1/2 recipe and only used 4 teaspoons of zest and it was lemony enough. I did a normal hard sugar glaze with a torch right before I served.

Rating: 4
This recipe is very easy, and the results are amazing. I use this as a basic recipe for all of my crème brulées. If you want a different infusion or flavor, you can easily substitute lime peel, mango, chocolate, etc., for the lemon peel and it works fabulously. I definitely recommend this recipe.

I got an ovation from my guests when they finished their desert! I was worried about the altitude but it set nicely and was easy to make. I followed the instructions for the crème brulee exactly but topped with strawberries and framboise (raspberry wine) made by Bonny Doon. Excellent. Will be making again!

Very good and easy to make. Give yourself plenty of time. If you can make night before, that would be best. Also note that this recipe does not yield a hard sugar top since it is being chilled after broiling. If you want the hard top place the brown sugar on top just before serving and either use a torch or broiler. In addition, a hand held sifter works great to put the brown sugar on top. I will make again. Enjoy.

This was my first time making creme brulee and I made several mistakes (forgot to strain the custard and the brown sugar, and two minutes under my broiler was too long, resulting in a charred and inedible topping). Nonetheless, they were delicious and creamy under the topping--I will definitely attempt again!

Made this with organic 1/2 and 1/2. It was just delicious. So light! A great summer dessert.

I made this without the berries because I am pregnant and didn't want to use the alcohol. The lemon flavor is light but adds a depth to regular creme brulee that is often lacking. It is amazing! I also used my creme brulee torch instead of the broiler-much more fun that way!

When people were eating this, you could have heard a pin drop. This was a huge success, and not at all difficult. I did cut down on the lemon a bit and it was very nice. The only challenge I had was that I was serving it at lunch, which means I had to start it at 6:30 in the morning! (Yes - next time I'll prepare the day before.) I followed the recipe to a T and had no lumps or any problems. For the brown sugar, I used my fingers to separate lumps and left out to dry, as suggested, then when it was time to put on the creme brulee, I just sprinkled it on with my fingers; didn't use a sieve. I did make one mistake: I didn't have the proper dishes, so used an assortment. The ones that were in large, flat dishes (and therefore only around 3/4" deep) were perfect. The ones in the deeper dishes were just liquid and never thickened properly.

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe! I've made it twice in the past 2 weeks and everyone has raved about it - and asked for the recipe! I'll add this to the favorite recipe collection and will definitely make it again and again.

This was my first attempt at creme brulee and I must admit, it was very successful. Fresh lemon zest is a must and I used blackberries instead. Thanks Alexis for an incredible recipe that I will make often.

Excellent creme brule. Great lemon taste and delicate texture. Everyone is always so impressed with creme brule...if they only knew that you make it ahead of time (even a couple of days will work). So easy and so impressive. Kids even love "pudding with candy on top" A blow torch is key.

I'm a novice at making creme brulee, so my problems were probably due to lack of experience. I thought the flavor was great! But my texture wasn't quite right--slightly "lumpy." And my oven broiler didn't do a very good job of making that nice brown sugar crust on top. Will definitely try again with some of the suggestions in other reviews.

Although very good, this was more work than any creme brulee I've made. Definitely too lemony -- we found we prefer vanilla. And way too much work when other, better recipes (such as Julia Child's) are out there. It was a huge hit with my guests who never had anyone make them creme brulee in their home.

Thought this was a great recipe for brulee. The lemon brightens it up a bit. 2 suggestions though: dry out the brown sugar by spreading out a thin layer over parchment paper in a cool dry place for several hours; and go ahead and invest in a small kitchen torch. Many non-commercial oven's broilers are not up to the job.

Sure, this was delicious - but not sure why the author needed "months perfecting" this. It's just creme brulee with a little lemon zest - hardly rocket science. The proprtions are the exact same in almost every "recipe" for creme brulee. This should as much of a staple as pie crust - something most semi-accomplished weekend chefs know by heart.

Both my husband and I thought this was terrific. The ingredients are always on hand and it was simple to make. I did not have the berries, but it didn't make a difference as it was so good. I teach and during the summer I like to try out receipes for future use. This one is certainly a keeper.

To "A Cook from Yorba Linda, Ca."..... You strain the custard through a fine mesh strainer. They range in size from 3 or 4 inches across to 8-10 inches. Buying a strainer about 6-8" shouldn't cost more than $10 (from Bed, Bath & Beyond or similar). You are removing the lemon zest, since the flavor has been released already, and any bits of egg that may have not incorporated fully. The resulting mixture will then be VERY smooth and produce a velvety custard after baking. Just pour the custard mixture through the strainer and press lightly at the end with the back of a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Discard the solids that are left behind. ---BTW-- A very smooth and creamy brulee. Very rich though. The tartness of the berries cuts the fat nicely.

Could someone please tell me what one "strains" the custard with? Thanks in advance.

A very good dessert. I have cooked many of your recipes and most of them have come out o.k. I wonder if it would be possible to have a section for questions and answers, not only to rate recipies. It would be very useful.

I did some research and I think I may have poured the hot cream into the eggs too quickly, making the eggs cook slightly before their time, resulting in a less-than-smooth texture.

I love custards! This one is a nice summer-time dessert because the lemon in the custard is very refreshing. We used strawberries and creme de cassis (no raspberries in season). Two things to note: my lemon zest was too finely grated and not all of it came out when I strained the cream, making the end product slightly grainy. next time I will use a larger-size grater on my lemon. I wonder if another thing contributing to the grainy texture was over-beating the eggs? 3 minutes seems like too long (yeah, I timed it...and at a minute and a half it looked good but I kept beating) and when I went to add the cream my eggs had a big froth on top (the whites, I'm assuming) that didn't look right. Maybe this time is meant for hand beating (I was using an electric beater)? The flavor of this custard is what won me over, though. I know if I can perfect the texture this will be a heavenly summer dessert that I will make for many years.

Gosh, Fairfield, CT, rather than policing everyone else, maybe you should think about actually writing a review of the recipe, yourself. Kinda makes you no better than the "chatters" you have so kindly taken it upon yourself to police, don't you think? At least everyone else is actually discussing the recipe at hand. By the way I loved this recipe and wouldn't change a thing. I had to use other berries, but it was still heavenly.

please do not "chat" in the reviews - it ruins the review table (this recipe has no forks and 4 reviews)

To christy34 ....add a couple of vanilla pods to the cream and discard after simmering. Or, if you prefer a milder vanilla flavour, add a couple of pods to your sugar jar....after a couple of weeks you will have lovely vanilla flavoured sugar.
