This is my first EVER recipe review and I have to say it tastes just like the sticky rice in any THAI restaurant. Like others I only soaked the rice for three hours. Do not be intimidated by the steaming instructions, you can steam any way. I used my dutch oven. Totally worth making!

This turned out perfect with very little fuss. It's an easy dessert to serve when you have guests as you everything can be prepared in advance. Made it for friends and we all lurrrved it! Definitely give it a try!!

This recipe sounded so good and I had these delicious ripe Indian mangos and a can of lite coconut milk in the cupboard, but no sweet rice or patience. So I made Basmati rice (the only white rice I had) in the rice cooker in 20 minutes and otherwise followed the recipe. Taking a tip from another reviewer, I used toasted coconut instead of sesame seeds. I know my dish is far from the right consistency (not sticky at all), it is none-the-less so delicious I can't stop eating it. Haven't tried it on anybody else yet though. I had an urge to add some lime juice or lime zest, but resisted it. Wonder if that would make it even yummier. Unrelated tip: freeze diced leftover mango and coconut milk (use ice cube tray) to add to smoothies. Blend with a little orange juice and milk and a little sweetener, if desired. Tastes like Mango sherbet.

Mmmmmm!! Just like our favorite Thai restaurant makes (actually better since I don't have to pay $7 for one little bowl...) Next time I might try using toasted coconut in place of the seeds, but it's good with the seeds too. Yum!

Great recipe - enough to stop me from going to our local Thai restaurant to buy this. From now on, I'm making it at home for much less. I've tried another recipe by Emeril Legasse, but this one's better. (Sorry Emeril.) For the coconut milk that was added on after serving the rice, I doubled the milk to 2/3 cup and only put in 4 T of sugar. Next time, I'll try just 3 T of sugar. I also used manila mangos which are seasonal. I've tried it with the regular mangos, but sometimes found them too stringy.

Just a tip to add: Do remember that since the rice has to sit in the coconut mixture after being cooked, do not steam it too soft. I only soaked my rice for about 3 hours and it turned out fine. My family had this fabulous dish (Kao Niow Ma-Muang) as part of a traditional Kantoke dinner in Northern Thailand and absolutely love it!

I tried this for the first time and it was a great success! The method of steaming the rice in the sieve and not boiling it kept the texture very nice and fluffy. My husband dislikes glutinous rice but this won him over! Due to one of my eaters being neutropenic, I had to steam the mangoes. Mangoes were very soft and warm - also very good!

I made this recipe and my family ate it in less then a day... they were hesitant to eat it at first but its so sweet that they loved it. We eat it without the mango, but it's good either way.

Really good. I steamed the rice the old fashioned way--so the rice was a bit mushy. This truly is an easy recipe that any group will LOVE! Mango is essential!

Very, very good. The second time I made it I used light cocunut milk to lessen the fat a bit and liked it even better.

I think toasted coconut would also be great for the top.

I wasn't sure what "sweet" rice was, but found one that said glutinous. I didn't soak the rice overnight, just a few hours, which turned out fine. I did however let the rice sit in the milk/sugar mixture for about an hour, and it turned it a bit too sticky and lumpy. But, it was delicious. I used toasted almond slivers, and they added a nice crunch to the rice and mango. I also used very ripe mangos, and drizzled a bit of coconut cream as well. Everyone loved it! Next time, I will make the rice, and not mix it into the milk mixture until a 1/2 hour before serving.

Soak rice a few hours and put into cheesecloth to steam 20 mins. (Thai steamer purchased from Wok Shop on Amazon). I used a can of coconut milk for recipe for soaking cooked rice, but doubled the sauce for the finished dish. I omitted the seeds for a change. Thick, ripe mango slices are a must. This is as good as the dish I had in Phuket! Thanks!

Two questions: If you do the rice cooker option, do you still need to soak the rice overnight before cooking? And where do you find toasted mung beans? I've looked all over NYC, and haven't been able to find them. The closest I've come is dried yellow mung beans. When I've tried toasting those myself (both in the microwave, and on the stove top), they've just taken on a burnt flavor. Help! Has anyone tried substituted roasted soy nuts?

I couldn't find glutinous rice, so I substituted purple rice. And the Mexican mangoes I used will never be confused for the Thai mangoes I remember from my days in SE Asia. But the sweetened coconut rice was just right.

This is a wonderful dessert; for an extra touch, drizzle about 2 T. of cream of coconut (i.e., Coco Lopez) over each serving. Also, if you can't find ripe mangoes, try this with fresh pineapple; even my super-picky grandson likes it!

This was just like the one they served in the Thai restaurant we went to. We used the rice cooker as well, and it turned out perfect. We actually enjoyed the sesame seeds with it, albeit un-toasted . . .

I had the best tasting result using the sweet rice from Koda Farms. I have used the same rice in other dishes, asian and otherwise; it's a nice change from regular rice and the best sweet rice. I love this recipe, especially the quick method with the rice cooker.

I agree with cook from LA about using the rice cooker....it was totally fool proof and very easy. It did indeed turn out just like the restaurants. I'll never pay $4 for it again!! Yummy.

My family loves this recipe -- the kids and my husband jump up and down when I annouce that I'm making it for dessert -- and guests rave forever! It's especially fun to make if you get the authentic gear from a Thai market to make it in.

I was looking for the recipe for weeks now and was so glad to find it here. It is my favorite Asian dessert now! Thanks, epicurious!

I added a few slivers of fresh ginger to the rice for a nice subtle flavor and scent. Yum!

Delicious. I just simmered the coconut milk with the sugar until dissolved, then dumped it into the rice cooker with the rice and water and cooked everything together. This takes only 5 minutes of prep time and 15-20 of cooking time. So simple! I agree that the mangos should be cut into thick slices and that the sesame seeds should be omitted. This results in a more authentic dish.

Very easy. I have never yet served it to someone who didn't enjoy it, and have had many requests for the recipe. I think the sesame seeds (toasted) add dimension and counterbalance the sweet nature of the dish perfectly, besides giving a wonderful presentation.

Omit the sesame seeds--the dish should really be served with mung bean seeds, or none at all. I like less sugar in the first batch of coconut milk--about 1 cup--and a little vanilla in both mixtures. Cooking the sticky rice in a rice cooker first yields perfectly fine results and is way simpler. I also like cutting the mango into thick, hearty, meaty slices rather than thin. Otherwise, I'm impressed--this is the most authentic Asian recipe I've ever found at this site, nearly identical to many I've found in Thai cookbooks. Great!

Excellent dessert. However, I didn't know that it really is only good the first day, used within a few hours. I had made it one evening for dinner the next day, and the rice had stuck together in one big mass. Still tasted good, but not the same delicate texture. I would still make this, albeit the same day I'll serve it. Tasty!!

I orginially tried sticky rice with mango in a Thai resturant. It was delicious. I went back a few weeks later & they took it off the menu! I began asking different Asian friends if they knew how to make it & got very vague responses. Then I began to browse "The Epicurious Food window" & found this recipe. Thank you. Thank you.

Great dessert for a thai or asian meal, and easy to do.

If you like mangos, this is one of the most delicious desserts imaginable. I've craved Sticky Rice and mango since the first time I had it at a Thai restaurant and am thrilled I now can make it myself at home.
