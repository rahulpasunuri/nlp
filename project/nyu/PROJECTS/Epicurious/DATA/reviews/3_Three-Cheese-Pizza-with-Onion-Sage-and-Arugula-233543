Yuck! I usually like strong tastes but the sage was overppowering and the raw onions too potent.

Delicious & very refreshing. Reminiscent of a pizza we had in N. Italy some years ago. I used a prepared organic pizza shell, caramelized onions, & cambezola cheese from TJs.

the most delicious pizza! i made it 2 nights in a row (with a few changes: used trader joe's pizza dough instead of making my own, the tiniest bit of tomato sauce, and sauted the onions) and liked it even better the second time. the gorgonzola is a lot less harsh once melted, and the other two cheeses definitely temper it a bit. the fresh arugula on top was wonderful, and every once in a while the sage flavor would come through nicely. definitely definitely worth making!

too many sharp flavors competing with each other--raw onion, gorgonzola and sage. I think caramelizing the onion first would be an improvement--salty cheese needs something sweet to play off of it.

I made this recipe just this past Friday night. I always struggle to do something fun and a little bit different during lent, mostly because meatless meals at our house are few and far between! This pizza was fun to make and was satisfying. The sage gave it a little different twist that we really enjoyed. I didn't make the dough as suggested here. Instead I bought a frozen pizza dough to save time. We will keep this recipe and make again!

This is a great pizza recipe. The combination of the three cheeses, red onion, and sage is delicious. The dough is also particularly good (the recipe is right -- it is wetter and stickier than most pizza doughs -- but it bakes up light and crisp). The arugula on top is a nice touch, though you only need about 1/3 of the amount specified by the recipe.
