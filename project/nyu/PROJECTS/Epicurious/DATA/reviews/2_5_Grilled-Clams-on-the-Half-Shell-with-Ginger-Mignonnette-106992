The easiest way to grill clams is to first clean them in a salt water bath 1/2 hour. Scrub shells clean and place in a disposable foil pan or a cast iron skillet with 2 Tbsp. olive oil, 1 Tbsp. butter, 2 chopped plum tomatoes, 2 grated garlic cloves (per dozen clams). Cover with foil and grill until clams open. Serve with chopped fresh basil and grilled Italian bread. Start to finish: 45 minutes. Easy, fast, and great...
