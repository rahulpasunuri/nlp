I always am asked for this recipe when made. On hot days it is refreshing when served cold, and is delicious when served warm. Make sure the oranges are clean and well trimmed. I usually make a double recipe of wine, sugar & water and make it a day ahead so that the flavors have a chance to absorb into the oranges.

Refreshing dessert. We'll make this again.

This was extremely simple and very good. My husband LOVED it. I scattered some raspberries on the top which was not only pretty, but surprisingly tasty with the cinnamon. I will definitely make this again.

Extremely easy to make. I think I would serve it over sorbet or cinnnamon ice cream next time.
