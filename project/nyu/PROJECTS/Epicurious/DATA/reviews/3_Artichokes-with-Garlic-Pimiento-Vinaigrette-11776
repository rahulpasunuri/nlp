I love this recipe. It's especially good if you can get a bunch of the small "baby" artichokes. (We've got three big plants in yard so supply is not a problem.) It's a fair amount of work prep them, but the dish is a real crowd pleaser

English is my second language and I had no problem making this dish, is easy and everyone in my dinner party loved it...I've done it several times.

The directions to this recipe were so confusing I had my entire dinner party in the kitchen helping. We never did figure it out, so we ate the artichokes the traditional way. The sauce was good though.
