This was delish! I didn't have Gruyere on hand, but used "Holstein Goat Gouda" I believe there were crimini , shitake, oyster and baby portabellas in the mushroom assortment. This was a treat for an easy dinner.

Mmmm...so good. Saute mushrooms and shallots until shallots start to caramelize.

Unlike the buttom mushrooms that most Americans grew up with, shiitake mushrooms are strong - with a very earthy taste. I love them, but the taste is predominate in this dish so you might want to try one first, if you are unfamiliar with this mushroom to make sure you like the taste. Nice recipe.
