Easy and delicious. I roast the halves and don't bother cutting up into smaller pieces.

meh, maybe adding some cooked turkey sausage and fresh herbs would enliven this dish.

This recipe was meant to be a simple side to accompany a dish with more powerful flavors, and in that vein it works perfectly. I used it as an accompaniment to pan-seared pork chops that had a bold sauce with them and it was a lovely contrast. Using a balsamic that's slightly aged (maybe an 8 year) is a nice touch too, it's not as acidic but not too sweet either so it still adds that tanginess to the squash. All in all a nice, simple side to boost the flavors of your main dish!

This is easy but boring in my book ...

It is the simplicity of this recipe that makes it outstanding, a perfect autumnal partnering with poultry or beef. I tried this out to see if I wanted to use it at the Thanksgiving Dinner table, and it will possibly become a regular in the rotation. Try the recipe you won't be disappointed. I did cut mine in cubes and roasted at 375 for 45 minutes, it caramelized nicely and add the balsamic while it is hot from the oven to fully appreciate the flavor.

Using pre-cut squash makes this recipe super easy and just as delicious. The match of vinegar with squash is excellent and unpredictable. We drizzled it on at the table.

This recipe is so easy to make and unexpectadly delicious. I would have never thought the vinegar would taste good with squash. My 20 month old loves it!

Easy, easy, easy. I hate peeling squash and this gives me a good excuse not to! The balsamic vinegar is a nice change from the more traditional ingredients. I will make this again.

I thought this was a nice simple side dish to make. I'm going to make a delicious variation of this for Thanksgiving. Use Acorn Squash instead of butternut. Then make a reduction sauce with 1 cup B. Vinegar, a tablespoon of honey (more or less depending on taste) and use a stalk of rosmary and thyme when you are cooking the reduction to 1/4 cup. It is really delicious, and would likely be good on the butternut squash also. The butternut would be a little too sweet for me, but to each his own.

I have made this dish numerous times and it is always wonderful. I love the simplicity and the flavors, especially when the skin is tender enough to eat as well. Add a little bit of freshly grated pecorino romano for an added kick.

This is a very simple way to prepare butternut squash and the balsamic vinegar is a great compliment to the sweetness of the dish. I just loved it. I served it with Buttermilk mashed potatoes with caramelized shallots and Beef tenderloin with garlic and brandy (also from this site). Delicious. I would definitely make this again.

Both my husband & I enjoyed this easy to make dish. It was a really quick weeknight side after I purchased the pre-cubed, pre-peeled squash.

This dish was easy, delicious and a colorful addition to roasted chicken and leeks. Using a good balsamic vinegar is important, though. We loved it and I will make it again!

The balsamic adds a nice flavour to this. I love squash no matter how it's prepared (except if it's sweetened - blech!)

I added a little cinnamon to the squash before baking and the baking time was not as long as the recipe indicated. (in A convection oven) Also, turn the squash throughout the baking process. Having never had butternut, it was really easy and delicious. I would make this again.!!

I love roasted squash, and found the balsamic to be a nice enhancement. It was a handy side dish for company, very quick to prepare, easy to cook and keep warm in the oven (i served it warm).

I've enjoyed several buttenut squash soups which I've tried, so I thought that I would try just the squash as a side dish. We didn't particularly care for it, to be quite honest. I served mine room temperature, which I think was a mistake. I would try it again next time right out of the oven. Also, we love balsamic vinegar, but it didn't really seem to compliment the squash too well. This recipe wasn't a total failure, but I won't rush to make it again soon.
