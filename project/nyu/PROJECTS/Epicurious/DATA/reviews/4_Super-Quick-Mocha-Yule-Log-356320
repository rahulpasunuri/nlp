This has become a family favorite. Genius! It's easy to make and delicious. This year I dusted it with crushed candy canes. My niece says this is her favorite part of Christmas.

This is a great update of the old classic refrigerator cake my mom served in the early 70s. I added an extra cup of whipping cream and increased the rest of the ingredients proportionately except for the cookies. I made a side bump and used some peppermint meringue cookies for garnish. It was a huge hit and really delicious. The best part is it's super easy & I'm always so busy on Christmas that I don't have time to make a dessert, so I usually serve cookies. But now I have a new tradition. Make sure to slice it on the diagonal for the best effect and to let the cake chill in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours before serving.

fun and super easy. I doubled the cream part as suggested by the first reviewer (great idea). Bought mini meringues which I carved into mushrooms (and added under the whip to make bumps on the log). It was a hit at our Christmas party!

When first tasting this, I thought the flavors were a little simplistic. I am still giving it 4 forks because I think it improved after chilling and because the response I got was terrific. You could also add some flavors to the cream to make it more interesting. A suggestion: don't overdo the cream between the cookies (as I did). A thin layer is enough. The cookies soften up nicely and otherwise you end up with not enough cookie to offset the cream. I may use this recipe as layers in a trifle in the future because I know I'll be asked to make it again at other times of year.

It was delicous and easy to make!I made it for a Christmas party last night and all the guests loved it! The chocolate mocha flavor was delicous I coulnd't find any meringue mushrooms so I used mini meringues from Trader Joes which looked really cute! I also added a little "bump on the log" by adding a stack of cookies and mocha cream coming off to the side. I would make a doulbe batch of the mocha cream though, as one was not enough for me. A double batch was not too much, more like barely enough to cover the log. I would recommend this recipe to my freinds and anyone who is thinking of making it! Five stars!
