I made this for an Indian holiday party, and agree that it didn't have enough "authentic" chai taste. I made a glaze from Ground Cardamom, chai spice and powdered sugar-- this gave it the perfect finish!

I was given some instant Chai powder and had no idea what to do with it. I normally make my own chai from bags. I was very happy to see this recipe. It does just taste like a spice cake but a good one.

This recipe is great as cupcakes. I even put my own twist by adding cream cheese frosting. Yummy!

Although the flavor of this recipe was good, I agree with a reviewer that the batter was runny. The cakes came out extremely soft. I had originally planned to bake it in the new Nordicware beehive cake pan, but after seeing how liquidy the batter was, I used mini-loaf pans instead, and honestly, I don't know how well this recipe would have stood up to the details of a real bundt pan. It's a great way to use up chai tea mix, if, like me, you had some you didn't know what to do with.

Like some others, I was underwhelmed by this recipe. There are a lot less expensive ways of making spice cake than using 1 cup of powdered chai, and this cake tasted very similar to your run of the mill spice cake. The batter was also incredibly runny and I wasn't very fond of the texture once completed.

I made this for a Bridal shower as a cake. Everyone loved it. I'm hosting another and it was the first thing requested. The trick is using a full flavored instant chai. Also godd topped with glaze made with chai and powdered sugar. Yum!!!

Yummy! To add more "chai" flavor I added a 1/2 tsp each of ginger, clove and cinnamon. That helped bring out more of the kick in the chai flavor. However, I would suggest cutting the syrup recipe in (at least) half. There was MORE than enough, even when I made the cake as a full size bundt cake. But this recipe is certainly a keeper!

Hello Fellow Food-lovers, Well, I just bought a charming mini-bundt cake pan (6 minis in one pan) that I hoped to make an inaugural recipe in. The pan came with a recipe for chocolate-spice bundt cake, but it had a lot of butter in it, and I didn't quite have the ingredients for it. I'm really glad I made this, however, because I really liked it. My husband proclaimed it 'freaking awesome'. Laugh. Reading the reviews, to give it more of a chai-flavor, I added a teaspoon of cardamom (you could use less or more--it is a strong flavor), and it seemed to do the trick. I cut back on the brown sugar as well so it wasn't quite as sweet (also per some of the reviews). The result was fairly light and full of flavor. Enjoy! (oh, also I added some cocoa powder to the last batch for a twist)

These came out gorgeous and they last wonderfully in the fridge. I used agave (sp?) cactus syrup instead which was nice and tasty. It tastes more like pumpkin bread than chai though, and I think it needs some kind of kick, although I can't decide what.

This recipe is absolutely outstanding! Very light and moist. I served it with maple syrup and cream instead of the Spiced Syrup. Even my pickier brothers enjoyed it! The recipe made exactly 13 mini bundt cakes. I agree with some of the other reviews that the cake doesn't taste like Chai tea. But it has all the same spices. It actually had a similar flavor to Gingerbread. I will definitely pass this recipe on to others!

I can't believe anyone would give this recipe less than 4 forks. This is such an amazing dessert recipe. I use spiced chai, either Trader Joe's or Oregon. I use a large bundt pan and bake for about an hour. The spiced syrup is not necessary but perfects it.

I've made these cakes several times and have received rave reviews. They were really good when I used "Big Train" brand chocolate chai tea. The syrup is good, but I have used regular maple pancake syrup (bottled) with good results. My husband likes them with ice cream and chocolate syrup. They freeze well and are fun to have on hand for drop in company.

These cakes were very easy, and very nice. The vanilla ice cream complemented them very nicely also. The syrup, however, was NOT good. Ended up almost adhering my guests' mouths shut! Any suggestions on how to improve the syrup would be appreciated, because I don't know what I did wrong to end up with such a hard, gooey mess...

I make these for a holiday tea, and they went over very well. They were sweet, and needed tea to compliment them - but everyone finished theirs.

Easy enough to make and really delicious! Had to use a tube pan and bake longer, but the cake was great...a little chewy on the outside and moist and light on the inside. With the syrup and vanilla ice cream, it made a wonderful dessert.

I made just the cake for Thanksgiving to take to someone's house...I didn't have the money to shell out for mini-bundt pans, so I used a regular one and baked it for about an hour...I said I wanted to take as little home as possible (because I knew I would eat it) and they certainly obliged!

This was good but so sweet! Chai powder, honey, brown sugar... and I did not taste a strong chai taste, rather just like a spice cake. Good but not outstanding as I had hoped.

I was hoping for a strong chai flavor and this recipe just didn't deliver that. I tasted just like any other spiced type muffin or cake recipe. I was hoping for much more.

I used a really big muffin tin to make these, and they still puffed up a lot. I had to cut the tops off to get them to sit flat on the plate. Went very well with the spiced syrup and some ice cream!

I Made this in a large Bundt pan, and it was just fabulous. Just had a piece, hot, with cream, and dribbled the syrup over the top, mmmm, think I should go back for another piece!

I thought the batter was very lumpy and the lumps didn't go away with baking -- next time I'll whisk the batter more and get the lumps out. I ran out of mini-bundt pans and put the rest of the batter in a layer cake pan and it also was good. Served it warm with ice cream -- yummy! Syrup is also good on oatmeal in the morning.

over alli t was good. It was more spoungy than I would have expected froma bundt cake. a little on the sweet side as well. I served it with some good vanilla ice cream, which was nice. It was also very good with some stong coffee at breakfast.

To echo other reviewers, yes, this makes a lot of batter. We tried using larger muffin tins, it made 12 plus a pile of mini-muffins. We had a hard time balancing getting the middles cooked on the larger muffins with not overcooking edges. Worked better the second time we tried with mini-bundt pans. For a wonderful dessert, serve hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Awesome.

I wasn't expecting such a "gingerbread" taste to this cake; it didn't remind me of drinking Chiai Tea which is one of my favorites. I also found the texture too "spongy" and not dense the way I expect a bundt cake to be. Will continue to search for a better way to incorporate Chai Tea into my dessert portfolio

The chai tea ingredient is misleading as printed in this recipe. It should read "instant chai latte mix" which has milk powder. I used Trader Joe's "spiced chai latte" mix. They came out of the mini bundt pans well, make a pretty presentation and are tasty. I'm serving them for Halloween dinner dessert.

I bake frequently and I have lots of great recipes, but my husband declared these were the best cakes I have EVER baked. Their texture was light and the flavor was delicate. Delicious!

I was disappointed in this recipe. Perhaps I lost something by using Tazo Chai Tea (non instant variety) in a cup and three fourths water vs. using the instant in water. It tasted like a bland pumpkin spice cake.

Rating: 3
I was (like another reviewer) really freaked when I saw how wet the batter was! BUT, the cakes are moist and very tasty! I found Lipton's Chai Latta instant mix at a discount market, it worked great! The only other thing I would caution about is that it makes a TON of batter! I made 12 large muffins and 3 mini loaves. You could probably half the recipe to get just the 12 large muffins.

This sounds great!!! I can't wait to try it - in response to the question of using brewed Chai tea - you can make your own chai tea powder. Search "instant chai tea podwer" I did and found lots of easy recipies to amke it!!

These are little gems! So easy to make. I made them for a brunch at work and they went immediately.

This was a delightful twist to the honey cake recipes traditionally served for Rosh Hashanah. Everyone loved being served an individual cake and the spiced syrup was wonderful. I purchased Lipton's ChaiLatta Chai Tea Latte Mix - Original and would use it again. I found that 20 minutes was enough cooking time, and froze the cakes, reheating to serve. I definitely will make this recipe again

Could you used brew chai tea (using chai tea bags) instead of using the chai instant powder and hot water? I have chai tea bags but don't remember ever seeing instant chai tea...

I made the cakes for a Thai dinner and it went nicely with the menu. I prebaked the mini cakes the night before and warmed them the following day in the oven at 250 degrees for about 10 minutes. They were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, then served them with vanilla bean ice cream and some chopped mangos. My guests loved them!

I am always on the lookout for something new and this fit the bill so much I made it twice this week. Simple and delicious. Everything the previous reviewer said, I second. I used Trader Joes "Trade Winds" Chai and made it in mini angel food cake mold, not a bundt, so there wasnt quite enough of the batter, but it came out perfectly.

At first I was frightened by the batter which wasn't just thin but RUNNY. But I was pleased that the cakes baked up light and springy, with a nice chai flavor. This was a super easy recipe -- a little pricey because of the chai powder, but worth making again. Nice, slightly spicy flavor.
