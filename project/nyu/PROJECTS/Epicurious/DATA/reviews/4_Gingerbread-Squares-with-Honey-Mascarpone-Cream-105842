After purchasing some excellent gingerbread from Whole Foods a couple of weeks ago, I've been looking for a recipe to make at home. This one was perfect! Of course, I made a few minor changes. I only had black strap molasses on hand, and I prefer dark gingerbread, so used that. I doubled the recipe, so used 3/4 c molasses & 1/4 c honey to balance it out a bit. I used orange zest instead of lemon, because I prefer the taste, and added fresh grated ginger as recommended by MN in 10/14/10 review. It was fantastic, and agree it only needed 30 min.

This is my go-to gingerbread cake - and I love gingerbread cake. It always gets rave reviews. I usually go heavy on the spices, but not quite double, add more crystallized ginger, plus a good knob of fresh ginger, grated in. Also a twist or two of black pepper also makes a difference. I've never made the topping - fresh whipped cream does it for me.

I made this for Mother's Day, my Mom loves Ginger Snap cookies and thought it would be a nice cake. She loved it. I put finely diced fresh ginger instead of crystalized (didn't have any left). I also did not have mascarpone cheese and did not want to go across town to get it and used cream cheese instead it was great, a bit thicker but really a good flavor, I added an extra tablespoon of honey. This cake was easy to make (even my four year old helped with out any problems, he cooks with us a lot). And, the cake is nice and light with a great flavor. Will make again any day or time of year.

This was lovely! The gingerbread was the perfect holiday flavor I was seeking and the marscarpone cream was so good, too. I had never worked with marscarpone before, but I see more of it in my future.

Delicious gingerbread! I used "heaping" spoonfulls for the spices, but did not double them. I baked mine in an 9" diameter cake pan & it came out perfectly after 30 minutes. It is not the most dense, moist, gingery cake I have ever had, but I prefer it this way. I thought this cake was the perfect level of moisture & flavor without being too heavy & overwhelming. Friends & family agreed. They LOVED it! I did not make the topping because I was planning to serve with warm caramelized pears & vanilla ice cream, but the cake was so good we just ate it plain. Can't wait to see how good it is the day after! So fast & easy, I will be making this all autumn & winter!

This is the best gingerbread recipe I have ever made. The crystallized ginger really makes it something special. I made a lemon sauce as a topping, because that has always been my favorite with gingerbread. This is a true "comfort food" dessert.

This is the perfect gingerbread. I didn't have crystallized ginger, so I used the real thing and it worked great. The mascarpone was nice, but not essential.

Yum. This was absolutely delicious. I did n't change anything and thought the crystallized ginger was delicious and an interesting addition. It does not need the mascarpone in my opinion but if I made it again I would use orange in the mascarpone and not honey.

I had lots of mascarpone laying around, so I made this and was very pleased with it. I didn't have lemon, so instead of lemon juice in the mascarpone mixture I used 2 Tbsp of orange marmalade and it was a nice compliment to the wintery flavors.

Yum! A moist, cake-like gingerbread that wasn't overpowered by the crystalized ginger. We ate it plain and it was great. I added 1/2 tsp more ginger and cinnamon (per other comments), and it was terrific. Bon appetit!

Made this without the Mascarpone cheese and crystallized ginger (replaced with fresh grated ginger), but it was still great! Would definitely make again, and so easy!

Easy to make and everyone loves it. Thanks for recommendations about increasing amount of ginger and cinnamon. Used cream cheese instead of mascarpone because of cost. Will make again!

Easy to make. And a favorite for many. Though, some people asked if I would use a sour cream frosting instead of the Mascarpone Cream.

This is a fantastic recipe. I increased ther ginger, cinnamon by 1/2 tsp. The crystallized ginger really sets it apart from the rest. I've made it twice, and both times have had a problem with the center sinking. I increased the cooking time by 5 minutes, and still had the same problem. Any ideas/suggestions? Also, I made the Apricot Sticky Sauce from another gingerbread recipe on Epicurious. I'd give that a big 4 forks! Yum!

I've made this recipe a few times and agree that it is a good, quick, easy gingerbread recipe to have on hand. I've never made the mascarpone accompaniment, because I usually eat it plain or serve it with whipped cream. I also prefer a spicier gingerbread, so I up the spices to 1 generous tbs ginger, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves and I add a few good grinds of black and white pepper as well. I've also found it comes out just as good with regular granulated sugar if you don't have brown sugar on hand. Happy baking!

This was great! I took it to a potluck with rave reviews. Very moist. Mascarpone cheese and honey was perfect compliment.

This gingerbread cake is very moist and delicious- definitely worth making because it's super easy. However, we didn't think the mascarpone was that good. Instead, I whipped up a 1/2 cup whipping cream until it was stiff, added 1 tablespoon of confectioner's sugar and 1/8 tsp vanilla, whipped it all together and served that as a topping. It was terrific as a tasty and festive Christmas dessert.

Very ho-hum. But easy, so that's a plus.

Soooo good. Very moist and fresh tasting. I used cream cheese with the honey, and left out the crystalized ginger, b/c quite frankly...who has that on hand? Will make again!

Simple and satisfying. My family loved this gingerbread and the decadent topping. The crystalized ginger is a nice touch.

I made this for Thanksgiving, along with the cover recipe in the Bon Appetit, November 2001 issue. It's a tradition and it didn't let us down. This gingerbread is a little stout in flavor, the kids liked the frosting better than they did the cake, but the adults loved it. The crystallized ginger was wonderful and made the cake moist and sweet. I did as the magazine suggested and started my TD dinner far in advance. I mixed the dry ingredients for this cake the night before and just whipped it up as soon as I pulled the turkey out of the oven, while it was carved, the cake cooked and filled the house with the warm, sweet smell of gingerbread. GREAT!
