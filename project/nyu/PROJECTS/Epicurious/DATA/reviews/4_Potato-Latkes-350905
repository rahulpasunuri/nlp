I haven't made this recipe, but I want to point out that people should please not replace 1/3 c of flour with 1/3 c of baking powder as suggested by Phillycarol. That would be inedible. Likely her relatives were suggesting adding a bit of baking powder (maybe a teaspoon) in addition to the flour to give them some lift.

I finely chopped the onion rather than grating it, and then browned the onion pieces a little first. I also gave the grated potatoes a few good squeezes before adding the flour and eggs, but even then they still continued to drain liquid. These turned out very crispy and flavorful, and I would use this recipe again.

I made these as directed - it seemed odd to add the flour and egg and then drain but it did work and I had good latkes. My Jewish relatives said they were a little heavy, and I should have used baking powder instead of flour. I will try that next time.

Just made tonight for the first night of Hannukah. Delicious, light and crispy. Kids loved them! Didn't peel potatoes and drained before mixing with flour and eggs. Then mixed in bowl put back in colander to drain while cooking the batches. Came out perfect. Used coconut oil for frying.

I use a salad spinner to remove the liquid from the potatoes and onions. It's easy and effective.

I am of Russian/Lithuanian heritage. While the ingrediants are correct, there are other steps that have been left out, that are most crucial to the texture, taste and cooking of latks. Definitely do not cook on high heat, the potatoes won't be cooked all the way. I have been making latks for 50yrs., taught my Nephew how to make them as now he makes them for his family and they love them. I know people have their own way of doing things, but there are certain food that are best when done the original way, which is from the cookbooks of the country. This recipe is from the Baltic countries, but along the way, someone has left out crucial, important information.

am looking for tips on how to more effectively squeeze out the water from the potatoes. Used a paper towel - three times! Has to be an easier way...

To GGuerrette - All I can say is, "Oy Vey!" Smoked clams in latkes!

I used organic yukon gold potatoes and mixed in one large russet. I think the quality of the potato is the most important part of how any latke turns out, so make good potatoes your #1 priority. Still, this recipe is simple, not too oily, and the brightness the lemon adds is great. I'll definitely make these again.

I was so pleased to find this recipe ... a simple, basic recipe to work from. Some adjustments to the ingredients and technique produced an extraordinary result. The adjustments are as follows: Dice the onions, finely (rather than pass them through a food processor). After grating the potatoes through the largest openings of a hand food grater, I placed them in a tea towel and squeezed the liquid from the potatoes. Only AFTER the potatoes were dry, did I place them in a bowl and add remaining ingredients; flour last. Two additional ingredients were added: Two small cans of smoked clams packed in oil and two teaspoons of fresh Taragon. These additions changed this recipe from a side dish into an entree. Also, I used peanut oil vs. vegetable oil. Enjoy!

I'd never made latkes before but this recipe was great. Didn't want so many so I used 2 large baking potatoes that weighed just less than 2 lbs., and kept the other ingredients the same, and they turned out super. I use extra large eggs so I only used two. I mixed everything together per the recipe and then drained everything as called for and they were super. My husband doesn't like potaotes but loves crispy hash browns so this was right up his alley. I used a 1/3 cup measure to put them into the oil and used the bottom of the measuring cup to flatten the latkes once I put them in the oil. To save paper towels, I used newspaper with one sheet of paper towels on top to drain. Have made these twice and loved them both times. My Jewish friend told me that flour would be just as good as Matzo meal so I didn't hesitate using it. Would love to try these with not only Yukon Gold potatoes but also with sweet potatoes in the future.

The best and easiest recipe I have come across. Made them last year to rave reviews and am doing it again this year.

I have never had latkes this good before. Top notch. Highly recommend Yukon Golds as a potato choice. Also Peanut oil, not vegetable oil.

All the comments here are valid and correct BUT if you want a true latke you have to fry them in schmaltz (chicken fat) It only once a year and worth the added taste Ummmmm!! ;-) Happy Holidays

These were very good but they were not the best I have tasted....next time, I will definitely double or triple the onion to potato ratio. also, i drained my mixture as the recipe stated - after mixing everything together - and it tasted good but I can see how something would be missing. The food processor's shredding blade did a fantastic job and saved who knows how much time and effort. Latkes are always best straight from the pan to the table so if you can make your mixture in advance, there is plenty of time to drain prior to cooking. This was my first time making latkes (though I have eaten them all my life) and overall, these were good, but I would try a different recipe or combination of a few next time.

I made these spur of the moment, and I didn't have any onions so I just substituted a bunch of onion powder. I thought it was fine. The flour is so important. I put sour cream, smoked salmon, chopped hard-boiled egg and lumpfish caviar on top of these for Christmas eve and I ate six. Delicious!

I made these for company during Hanukah and they RAVED! Said they were the best latkes they had ever eaten. I made 2 changes--didn't peel potatoes and substituted cornstarch for flour as one of my guests had celiacs disease. They really are more like crisp fried potatoes so if you're expecting stody thick latkes, forget this recipe. I'm going to make minis and freeze them for New Year's Eve.

To the Cook from Ann Arbor - Food processors are wonderful tools for making fast work of chopping and grating. You can certainly use a hand operated grater like a box grater. It will work fine but just take longer.

I haven't actually used this recipe; I have to agree with the critics (I have made latkes for 20 years with nary a lemon) and the recipe i use is very simple and pretty much the same as the Zabar's version found here: http://www.oneforthetable.com/oftt/hannukah/one-for-the-tables-latke-extravaganza-2.html

These were excellent - won over our crowd of latkes fans. Will be making this recipe again next year!

I'm with "A Cook" - too fancy and totally unnecessary. Yukon Gold potatoes - unpeeled... If you run some onion and some potato through the shredder together, there's no need for the lemon. The onion works to keep the potatoes from turning color. Matzah meal instead of flour, certainly, and my "best" latkes use only 1/4 cup of matzah meal, only 1 egg, and 5 lbs of potatoes with 2-3 onions. I do drain the potato/onion mix in a colander. Put a piece of parchment paper on top and push down HARD to squeeze out excess liquid. Works every time! Instead of paper towels, you can set the cooked latkes on cooling racks over a rimmed cookie sheet to drain or, better yet, buy those ridged foil roasting pans. To the people who want to freeze and reheat: cool completely then place in freezer bags to freeze. Reheat on cookie sheets directly from freezer.

Enjoyed great crispy Latkes. I also drained the potatoes & onion mix

I agree with "A Cook"...the recipe is written poorly...you have to drain BEFORE you add additional ingredients to the grated potatoes and onions otherwise much of the flavors are lost in the bowl with the discarded liquids. Also, loss the lemon..matzoh meal better than flour and your potatoes to onion ratio is off too. Where did you get this recipe???

I have made potato pancakes for years but never knew they were called Latkes. I think it was from Joy of Cooking that I learned to roll the grated potatoes up in a towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible to help make them crispy. I am sure someone will let me know if I have stepped out of bounds here.

Great, crispy latkes! For crispy ones, I think the russet potatoes are a must as is draining the mixture after the eggs are added. Actually, I drained the potato and onion mix before adding the flour and eggs, and then afterward as well. Yum. I'm glad that Hannukah has several more nights so I get to make these latkes again!

I was surprised to see that the recipe called for draining AFTER adding the eggs and flour, but the latkes came out great! I froze them since I need to feed 14 people next week and didn't want to be trapped in the kitchen (my usual fate at Hanukah). I hope they re-heat well, but I haven't tested that aspect of the recipe yet. Even though your Bubbe may not have used lemon juice, it kept the potatoes from discoloring and did not at all affect the taste. I used peanut oil and gave up on the thermometer, but the basic recipe and technique produced a very good latke. Bubbe learned by trial and error, and so did I, but this recipe is a good shortcut to learning how to make a great latke and will save a lot of tsouris. Since I planned on freezing them, I wanted to get them as well-drained as possible, on paper towels, and then I cooled them completely on a cookie rack, before layering them between sheets of quick-release foil on a cookie sheet and freezing overnight. The next morning I re-wrapped them and put them back in the freezer in a storage container.

OH, PLEASE! Don't peel the potatoes - wash them thoroughly - grate them with the onion (2 lbs potato to one medium onion) - Matzoh Meal, not flour - forget the fancy schmancy lemon and the thermometer - you're Bubbe didn't need them and neither do you. heat the oil and cook by instinct - you'll know a good latke when you see it.
