yum yum yum!! Amazing! The sauce was really good with the cakes. The only thing I changed, was substituting spring onions for chives.

My family loved this so much that I made it twice in one week. The first time I did not have yogurt and substituted sour cream and that was not a problem. I also added capers to the sour cream and when I made it again to the yogurt. Fantastic recipe and so easy to make. This will be stable in our house.

This was a fabulous weeknight meal! We really didn't change a thing (we used my homemade bread in place of the pita) except we added grated garlic to the yogurt sauce. Really loved it and cannot believe how quick and easy it was!

This recipe took me about 30 minutes, start to finish, including side dishes... super quick and easy for salmon cakes. Used an extra half-pound of fresh salmon but didn't really need to increase the other ingredients. Made 6 medium cakes. Opted for 3/4 cup plain panko as suggested in other reviews. Delicious! I was surprised how well these cakes stayed together (I think the key is to blend the mixture by hand like meatloaf). One tip - cut the sauce recipe in half, it made way too much. Overall, two thumbs up. I will make this a regular meal!

Tremendous. Salmon cakes were a new concept for me, and there could not be a better introduction. This was delicious from the first bite, and oh-so-easy to make. The only caveat: it's heavy food, so even while you'll be tempted to do otherwise, one good-sized cake is enough. Great, Great dish.

This was very tasty. Like other reviewers I made some of my own changes: added extra lemon to the cakes and sauce, added dillweed to the sauce, and added extra corriander and a bit of salad herbs with a little lemon verbena. Simple and quick. I will definitely try it with the panko next time, as others suggested, the hubby thought it was a little too "bready." This would be a pretty impressive but easy weeknight dinner.

I am in the process. Don't have coriander seed - subbing with tarragon since that comes up with the chives. Also, subbing Miracle Whip instead of mayo because that's what I have, but using half as much because it's sweet. Let you know how it turns out. Having grilled corn with lemon and cayanne and grilled vadalia onion. And broccoli with shallots and cappicola fried in bacon grease and lemon zest.

I must admit to having a dislike for salmon cakes. There are so many recipes out there and all fall short in my opinion...until these. I followed the recipe to the letter altho I didn't bother with the sauce. I wanted to taste the salmon and not have it smothered, which is a good test of the recipe. They were terrific! Everything came together beautifully and very balanced flavours. Next time I'll give the sauce a go. You gotta try these!!!

Great recipe. Only change I made was subbing the pita for 3/4 cup panko as previous reviewers suggested. They came out exceptional. It was my first time working with fish and everybody loved them.

Used a can (yes! a can) of "good" salmon in lieu of salmon fillet, and went with a previous reviewer's suggestion of 3/4 c panko rather than the pita. Easy, easy, easy for a weeknight dinner. The dressing was fab - and did go w/ another reviewer's suggestion to up the lemon juice and add in some dill weed. Was my lunch the next day and was still delicious (sometimes a concern with fish on the next day).

Super good. Have always loved this recipe. Being the season, I had some huge zucchini taking over the garden. So, substituted the zucchini for salmon. Just diced the zuc's and cooked for a few minutes to soften. Then followed the recipe. Still amazing.

My husband loved these and asked for them again. I did make several modifications: feta salad dressing instead of mayo, red onion and chili powder instead of cayenne, and loads of extra lemon in both the cakes and the sauce. It turned out great! Served it with a greek style cucumber tomato salad.

This is a great recipe. Like other reviewers I did make some changes.The biggest one, I think, was that I started out with grilled salmon which added a great smokey flavor to the cakes. I used whole wheat and flax seed pitas (I was worried these might ruin the texture but they worked out well) I substituted tarter sauce for the mayo and I increased both the lemon juice and zest in both the cakes and the dressing. I cook a lot and I must say this is one of the best dishes I have made.

I made this recipe, but instead of pita, I used 3/4 cups of panko as per other reviewer suggestions. I also added a jalapeño to the salmon mix and upped the chives and lemon juice a tiny bit. As for the yogurt sauce, I used a plain, low-fat greek yogurt. It was rather bland, so I added one more teaspoon of chives, maybe a teaspoon more of lemon juice, and added dill to taste. It ended up being delicious. Also, I used .87 lbs of salmon, which may have helped it stay together better because I used what the recipe said to use for the egg, mayo, etc.

Rating: 4
A superb collection of tastes. What makes this recipe is a couple of things: 1) the size of the salmon pieces, provides greater depth of fish and texture. (I don't enjoy the fish cakes where it's essentially a puree of mash.) 2) the sustained presence of lemon in the cake through zest and juice in the sauce keep the whole dish fresh and light. I added a bit more lemon juice to the sauce. Only problem was that the cakes didn't stay together as firmly as I would have hoped. I need to work on that. I love this recipe and will make it again. Served with a baby gem and watercress salad.

Rating: 3
Good recipe. Followed other reviewers suggestions and used panko crumbs, but think regular bread crumbs may work just fine. The lemon yogurt sauce needs more of a kick - I used more chives and cayenne. Worked very well using the salmon I'd hot smoked the day before (Northwest style).

Rating: 4
Great recipe! For some added bang, I threw in a Jalapeño pepper - seeded and diced - along with about 1.5 Tbsp of flat-leaf parsley before forming the patties. 3 minutes in the pan on each side cooked the patties perfectly. The lemon yogurt sauce is excellent as well. I will definitely be making this one over and over.

Took the advice from others and used panko breadcrumbs instead of pita rounds or white sandwich bread. I used approximately 3/4 cup of panko, adding more to the completed mixture for more texture. In addition, I added some Old Bay's Seasoning and more chives (I actually didn't chop or measure, just threw it into the food processor). I decided to put all of the salmon into the food processor, but next time I may leave a portion out to give it more texture. As for the sauce, it was plain jane and will probably not be made again, which is why this is a three fork recipe. Everyone enjoyed the salmon cakes and will be making them in the future! Cheers!

Rating: 3
Succulent and moist! The panko made them particularly tender. I used homemade mayo as well, which added richness. I actually enjoyed the sauce, despite the plainness. I wanted more flavor in the actual cakes... if I was to make this again I would add more coriander and cayenne (i love the jalapeno suggestion as well) so that the soothing yogurt had something to cool down.

Rating: 4
this is a luscious summer lunch meal with lots of taste sensations, because the individual ingredients are not blended in a food processor. in my case it did have trouble maintaining its unity as a salmon cake and during the cooking process threatened to become a salmon frittata so i might up the mayonnaise next time around, or add mustard to add the necessary mush, and add a bit of celery for crunch. re the sauce-nice but bland, could benefit from more chives, coriander, cayenne, something with more spice and sizzle

Rating: 4
So, I made these for a few friends coming over, and forgot they were vegetarians. They obviously aren't all that dedicated, as there were NO leftovers even though I doubled the recipe. Something strangely gratifying about bringing them back to the "dark side." Anyhow, I was worried about them holding together (the cakes, not the vegetarians), so I put half of the allotted salmon in the food processor, combined it with the chunked salmon, and formed the cakes. Also put them in the fridge for an hour beforehand. Would recommend adding spicy mustard, dill and a little hot sauce to the yogurt for kicks.

This was amazing. Some people complained about how the cakes wouldn't stick together -- I popped them in my food processor for about 15 seconds and this seemed to do the trick. I fried them in my cast iron skillet and they stuck together beautifully. Not only that, but they tasted *amazing*. Based on another's advice, I threw some dill in the yogurt sauce (also used Greek yogurt). I didn't see any chives in my grocery store so I used scallions (yes, I know they're nothing alike, but they tasted great nonetheless). This is definitely a keeper. Very easy, looks great, and tastes better. I served with a tossed salad and cauliflower roasted with curry and turmeric.

Rating: 3
I made the cakes as written and my husband and I thought they were fantastic. The pita gives them a pleasant chewy-texture and they were a nice alternative to our usual crab cakes. Used a not-stellar cut of salmon and they were still tasty. I think the key to getting these to stick together is actually tearing the pita into as small of pieces as possible. I also chilled them for 10 minutes to firm them up, and then cooked them on the grill (on a grill plate). The only reason this didn't get 4 stars is the sauce definitely needed some doctoring. Used greek yogurt, added lots of dried dill, and extra lemon juice.

I ran out of mayo and made my own for the first time (1 egg yolk; 2 tsp either vinegar or lemon juice - I used one of each; salt; and 1 c olive oil very slowly added in while whisking other ingredients). I used that both in the recipe, and the leftovers I mixed with some dijon, which accompanied the cakes very nicely. Because of other reviewers, I just skipped the yogurt sauce. I also used regular bread crumbs. I chopped the salmon in smaller pieces and used slightly less cayenne because I was feeding it to kids. I also ground my own coriander because I didn't have any ground (used an old coffee grinder). I was generous with the lemon zest. I did not have chives, but chopped a small scallion very finely. My 5 year old couldn't get enough, but then again he is a Salmon fiend.

Rating: 1
I'm sorry, but these were pretty plain and boring, in both, taste and texture. I had to sprinkle it with some chopped walnuts to add some texture. I also added more lemon juice and zest to the sauce. I would have softened the bread in some hot milk to make it a homogeneous mixture so it's not clumpy when you mix it with the salmon. I was also surprised that the recipe didn't use any onions. Would not make again without some modifications.

We thought these were just great! They taste amazing. I also had trouble keeping mine together, so the presentation wasn't great, but none of us really cared. Next time, I'll cut the sauce recipe in half because you don't need much on each cake.

I subbed panko for the pita and omited the chives because I didn't have any. Cakes came out awesome--I cooke them in cast iron at a higher heat and they came out nice and crusty in less time than recommended. I turned down the heat for the second batch and it wasn't as good. I made the yogurt sauce with greek-style yogurt, salt and lemon juice and I didn't have anything else on hand to fix it so I ended up tossing it because it was awful. The cakes are excellent--the sauce not so much.

The yogurt sauce needs dill and more lemon juice. I used stale challah bread and my croquettes came out doughy and delicious! Be careful not to overcook. I served these with cous cous and green salad w/ baby cucumbers.

I am not sure what happened but these just fell apart. They tasted great....but very unappealing to look at it and as mentioned, just in pieces. I used fresh bread crumbs and egg whites as binders (and as called for) and they still fell apart. Hmmm...need to think on this.

Love this, even with canned salmon! I substituted naan for the pita, which turned out to have a great slightly chewy texture. I liked the sauce recipe but didn't care for the yogurt that I used. I think a Greek-style yogurt would be much better than regular whole-milk. Still, great recipe! My boyfriend had the leftovers the following day and said that they reheat well. I can't wait to make it again with fresh salmon!

Wow. . .delicious!! I made the sauce with dairy free coconut yogurt, a dallop of mayo, and the juice of a 1/2 lemon, and it was fabulous. I substituted dill for chives, used gluten free bread and used two eggs for the cakes. They held together well. This was a great way to use up a pound of leftover grilled salmon. My 7-year-olds loved it, too.

I have made these twice and added 2 eggs the second time and found the cakes held together a bit better. I also substituted canned salmon, and (probably since I have never tasted it with fresh) that works great. I love the yogurt sauce, I found myself daydreaming about it today after nearly a year and so I thought I'd better whip up some!!

These came out great and were very simple to make. Instead of pita, I toasted 3 pieces of whole wheat bread and then broke them into pieces into the mixture. It came our really well! The only reason I gave this 3 not 4 sars is that I didn't really like the yogurt sauce. It would have gone for a more traditional tartar.

This was incredibly delicious and so easy to make. I'm sure we'll make it again and again. Instead of whole milk yogurt, I used non-fat greek yogurt (pre-strained so that it has a thicker consistency). Next time I might try a non-fat or low fat mayo, too.

This dish was very tasty, and was something that my entire family enjoyed - even my husband, who is not a salmon lover. I used panko instead of pita rounds, and this seemed to work out fine. I also accidentally put all 2 Tbsp of scallion in the salmon mixture, but they were not over powering. The lemon yogurt sauce complimented it wonderfully. I served it all on top of a nicoise type salad with a lemon vinaigrette. I will definitely make this again - light and tasty!!

When I first made this, I omitted the zest, used toasted bread crumbs instead of the pita bread, and used yellow onion instead of the chives. It was fantastic! However, I then tried the recipe to a T, and it was terrible! No flavor! Next time I will go with my first instincts on this one.

This was truly exceptional, and unusually easy. I was skeptical about the pita, but it's a great addition. Because the cakes and sauce have some of the same ingredients, it was easy to make both at the same time. I mixed the bread with the herbs and spices, then added the fish, then whisked the mayo and egg in a separate bowl and mixed it all together.

I've made these lovely fish cakes a few times now and have never had a problem. It works perfectly. I like the way the fish pieces keep their shape and they kind of crisp up nicely. The texture is great and no-one seems to have noticed it has pita bread in it. Lovely with salad for lunch.

Rating: 3
Great flavor, but had a couple of difficulties...cakes didn't stay together well, as other reviewers noted, and were almost black on the outside while the inside was nearly raw in the recommended amount of cooking time. Not sure if I made them too thick, or if the low smoke point of olive oil is to blame. Next time might try to make them thinner (although will then be harder to keep together), or substitute vegetable oil for frying. Nice flavor though, and the sauce was a good complement. Also did the potato and celery salad.

My husband and I really like this recipe: the slamon flavors is excellently balanced and the texure is great. The cakes do seem wet before you cook them but, they hold together as long as you don't flip 'em like they're burgers. On the pitas, I found that just tearing them left the pieces too large so after tearing them, I diced the pile up with a nice big knife. I used fat free yogurt which was fine. regular would probably be better,

This was great and easy to prepare. I used fresh coriander, chopped and 1/2 small white Onion istead of dill. I also baked mine for 14 min at 375 degrees, because I usually make a lot at once. I suggest to refrigerate the mixture until well chilled and then form the patties, so they won't fall apart. Then refrigerate again and bake. They lift off the baking sheet without falling apart.

My husband and son loved this; my daughter & I thought it was fine. Good texture, but IMO could have used a bit more flavor. The lemon-yogurt sauce was a hit with the grown-ups (the kids aren't into sauce of any kind). I used a combination of low-fat and Mediterranean-style yogurt, doubled (more or less) the lemon juice, and added a tiny pinch of cayenne.

This was easy and delicious, a great weeknight entree or, if made into smaller cakes, a good appetizer. My only change to the recipe was to use low fat mayo which made the weigh watchers point value for each cake 6.5. My mother would have called these "latkas" or "croquettes."

I love this recipe and make it often. I use the food processor to crumb the bread/pita then I put that in a bowl, then put the salmon in the processor and pulse until it is about the size needed. I also have pre-assembled these, covered and refrigerated for several hours with good results too. Just a couple tips! :)

This was a good, but not great recipe - so two forks. Not something we'll eat often but it was a reasonably good way to use up some frozen salmon. My son who hates salmon said he'd eat them again. Daughter who loves salmon said she'd rather not eat them again. So... this is likely a good way to get salmon onto the plates of non-salmon eaters, but for those who love a beautiful salmon fillet this is a cover-up. Really liked the lemon yogurt, I'd serve it with a grilled fillet.

Really delicious recipe. It took less time than the recipe says. I roasted the eggplant on the stovetop over an open flame and it only took ten minutes (for the Morrocan egglplant salad recipe that's recommended to accompany the fish cakes). I wrapped the eggplant in foil to steam while I prepared the fish cakes. They didn't hold their shape as much as I would have liked them to, but maybe I should have put them in the fridge for a few minutes before frying them up. However, a cube or two of fish refusing to stick to the patty didn't ruin the meal. If you don't have salmon on hand, tilapia or sole are great substitutions (and cheaper, too!) Also, I didn't use chives. Dill goes really well with fish if you have that on hand.

It is a good, simple recipe. My daughter loved it. My daughter loves salmon. If you enjoy salmon you will really enjoy this recipe. If you are on the fence about this fish- I wouldn't get my hopes too high. As for making the patties... you can't really shape these things. Think of a mud pie, once it looks flat in your hand plop it in the hot pan and leave it there about 5 minutes before the flip.

We have made this twice since it came out already. They come out really well. The cakes will stick together better if you mix the liquid components with the pita and let stand a few minutes before adding the fish. I also added a tiny bit of lemon juice to the cake mixture -- that helped too. The recipe doesn't say, and this might be obvious to some, but mix all spices with mayonnaise and egg prior to adding any solid ingredients -- for proper blending. I do not like the normal consistency of crab cakes, and the pita works much better, IMHO
