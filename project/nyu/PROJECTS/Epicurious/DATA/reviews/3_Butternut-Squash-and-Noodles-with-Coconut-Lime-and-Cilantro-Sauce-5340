I wanted to like this, in spite of the many reviewers who didn't. I added extra everything - ginger, red curry, fish sauce, both cilantro and Thai basil, but it just was bland with the noodles. I think it's good as a soup, much like another recipe on this site, maybe on rice, as it wouldn't be absorbed as much. The noodles were a bland mess.

I've made this 3x in past 2 months. It's excellent and I've gotten many compliments. Definitely needs 3x the ammount of red curry and even a pinch of cayenne and/or crushed red pepper. Added another cup of broth as the squash soaked most of it up. Tried serving over brown and jasmine rice - both good. Added shrimp this last time which was a perfect combo. want to try adding fresh ginger next as recommended by others.

I'm giving this recipe 4 forks with the addition of more red curry & the fish sauce recommended by prior reviews - made this with local butternut squash & fresh cilantro, made a separate batch with chicken - entire family loved it...will go great with rice or noodles

Following the recipe resulted in a very mild, tasteless sauce. I ended up adding 3x the curry paste and more cilantro and still found it profoundly lacking. One of the few recipes I would say just isn't a particularly good one.

Needs more red curry paste, i like a lot and used about 1 1/2 tablespoons. I'd also add some fish sauce and fresh ginger if making again. It was super yummy and gave me a good starting technique for other curries i want to try and make.

My niece just made this and recomends more Thai red curry paste and thinks it would be good served on rice. I agree.

If you do a search for "spaghetti squash" this recipe comes up...which threw me for a loop, since I started cooking it and all i had was the spaghetti squash. So i just made the sauce without cooking butternut chunks in it. Major alterations that you too can try: didn't have jalapeno so I sprinkled some crushed red pepper, cayenne, and turmeric in at the same time as the broth. Gave it plenty kick. only had full-fat coconut milk - scooped off the solidified fat and used the juice. Also added some chopped fresh ginger which was essential (and dont skip the cilantro). Poured the sauce over spaghetti squash innards...turned out pretty good. I'd serve it to guests if I added some shrimp or chicken, but it was decent on it's own. Also, vegan, which is always a plus!

I made this with just a few alterations: fresh basil rather than cilantro, three times the amount of red curry paste, and a little more garlic than it called for. As suggested I added a tablespoon of fish sauce at the end of cooking and it was definitely a good choice. Made it in a wok rather than a skillet and it worked great. I spooned the sauce generously over spaghetti and topped with the basil for a prettier presentation. It got great reviews from everyone at the table and everybody had seconds. Perhaps next time I would try to make more sauce, it was delicious and more would be even better! Also we made the mistake of cutting some squash pieces too large so they were still a bit crunchy, but that's it. Next time I think I would add more jalapeno for more spice, or a teaspoon of Asian-style hot sauce. Easy and tasty, definitely will make again.

This is tasty! I tripled the curry paste and added 1T fish sauce at the end. Next time I may substitute basil for the cilantro. Also, I thought (Japanese) soba noodles would be a strange culture clash with this Thai-style dish, so I served it with jasmine rice instead. It was perfect with the rice.

Exceedingly tasty and healthy vegetable stew. No need for noodles or rice - it was hearty enough with the squash. Did great in my pressure cooker for 5 minutes at high pressure.

Rating: 4
when i saute the onions in the bottom of my soup pot, i also saute chopped mushrooms and celery. when they are slightly cooked, i add about 2 cups of water (negating the need for vegetable broth), bring it to a boil, throw in the squash, as well as some chopped up green peppers. add other ingredients in the order specified. sometimes i throw in shrimp, broccoli and carrots (i like undercooked carrots in my soup) at the very end, though not always. this soup *always* *always* *always* turns out delicious for me. for those complaining about the soup's tickness, simply add more water (or vegetable broth) as you're cooking.

I couldn't get any udon noodles and was going to use another type of pasta, but the whole concoction ended being too thick for noodles (especially with the squash and coconut milk). Instead, I tripled the amount of vegetable broth, adding more curry, lime and coconut milk to taste, and served it with rice.

Rating: 3
I skipped the noodles and used spaghetti squash. The fish sauce really does take it to another plane.

A new interesting way to use butternut squash. Unfortunately, my eyes crossed lines of text while reading the recipe and I ended up overcooking the squash so it was more of a mushy sauce, but not unpleasant, over wholewheat linguine. I'm mystified by others who thought this dish had no flavour or heat, mine had plenty of both. If you're not vegetarian, I highly recommend adding about 1 to 1-1/2 T of fish sauce when the recipe says to season to taste with salt. I didn't have lite coconut milk, so I used regular. I skimmed the thick cream off first and bloomed the curry paste by cooking it in the coconut cream first. The onions must be cooked long enough to add depth to the flavours, and fresh squeezed lime juice is a must. It may be a matter of how much one likes butternut squash. I thought the dish was good, and my guest thought it was great. Served with steamed Asian greens on the side for colour. I'll make it again and try not to overcook the squash.

This turned out to be even more delicious than I expected. Had to cut down on the heat due to a spice- sensitive guest, but even with moderate amounts of the jalapeno and curry paste, the dish was seriously yummy!

I don't know what you bland nellies are talking about: this has kick! as other reviewers have noted, I think it may be about buying some quality thai curry paste rather than uncle shmo's at the local market. followed to the letter, spicy and delicious!

There was something lackluster about this dish. It was o.k., but not worth making again.

I made this one along with the Thai-style chicken and vegetable stir-fry from this site and it was a great Thai dinner. One can of coconut milk is enough for both recipes. Also used whole wheat linguine. It was good reheated for lunches with the left-over chicken mixed in.

like other reviewers, I liked it, but wasn't wowed by it. it was just missing something and definitely needed more heat and some more lime juice to wake it up.

this recipe was good but it def needed a little something more. i ended up putting a few splashes of fish sauce and some more of the curry paste in mine. my family loved the end product!!

Rating: 3
I enjoyed this recipe, but because I like my food very spicy felt it needed more heat. Next time I will use hotter peppers. Also, I tasted it when it was done and then added a tablespoon of Thai Fish Sauce and another teaspoon of red curry paste. I think this improves the complexity of the dish. Even without these changes, it was very good.

Rating: 4
I get the feeling that the type of curry paste is key to this dish. I used Thai Kitchen red curry paste, which is spice-o-riffic, plus a nice hot and fat green jalapeno, so it was way far from bland. I actually ended up using the entire can of coconut milk so I wouldn't burn my tongue off. A bit of honey or brown sugar definitely helps, but I was confused by the sour comments. This could probably benefit from some red bell pepper for color, but over all, this is going in my favorites.

Here I go again... Forgot to say that I didn't really measure the ingredients as I do with all recipes, I just used more of the things I like and less of what I don't. All cooks in my little opinion should do this to make things you will like. I used half the noodles and had more of the awesome sauce. I served this with the pan seared tilapia and WOW these go great together..and EASY!

I am at a loss as far as all the negative reviews! My husband and I loved this dish. I am a newbie to cooking this type of cuisine and this was easy and delish! I did make a few changes because of what I had on hand. I used zuchini(spelling?) and green thai curry paste. The dish was very green but very tasty. I also added the chopped peanuts at the end and we thought this was an essential touch. Not to be too wordy here but I think anyone can make this even a novice to the kitchen. I used my cheapie wal-mart chopper for the jalepeno and garlic (takes seconds) and fried the onions, then zuchini for a couple minutes and fried the jalepeno and garlic with the curry then added the broth and simmered. The cilantro and coconut milk I added when the veggies were cooked to my liking and turned off the heat. In my new asian adventures i've found that overcooking the fresh/subtle ingredients kills the flavors. As far as the noodles same thing cook to the doneness you like and bathe in cold water to stop further cooking (or sogginess) then toss it all together when ready to eat and reheat if necessary. Please try this!

I agree with many of the reviewers--what is usually a great combo of ingredient turned out uninspired and bland in this recipe. I ended up throwing my leftovers away. I'm not sure what the problem was, but there are many similar recipes that are so much better.

I found the recipe to be quite sour. I really wanted to like this recipe because I love the Cilantro, Coconut milk and curry combination. I'm not sure if it was the brand of red curry I used or just the overall combination (I followed the recipe to the letter). I just could not swallow any more than two bites. The sourness was so overwhelming. What a disappointment.

Rating: 3
I was impressed with the recipe. I used simple Chile Paste instead of Thai Chile Paste because I couldn't find the right one at any of three different supermarkets near me. The dish turned out great, however, despite my reservations I had from reading the other reviews. I guess this all depends on what you like!

I wanted so much to like this recipe, as I love butternut squash and I'm always looking for new ways to prepare it. But this recipe was just bland, bland, bland. I followed it to the letter, I used fresh ingredients, etc. And normally I like subtle flavors--I don't know why this one was so uninspiring.

I made this dish with rice noodles because I couldn't find the right kind of udon. I used 8oz and thought the dish was really tasty. I used the juice of one whole lime and added quite a bit of soy sauce after the squash was cooked (to keep it veg, use fish sauce otherwise). I left the seeds and membranes in the jalapeno and it had quite a kick.

After reading the reviews of this recipe, I'm shocked. Luckily I didn't read them before I made it the first time. I thought it was incredible! I made it for my boyfriend, who said it was the best meal he's had since he's been in San Francisco! I used all organic ingredients, and it was spectacular. I am making it again tomorrow night.

I won't rate this since i modified it quite a bit. I suggest that one fry the curry paste and garlic with the onions and squash mixture. Also if anyone is trying for a "Thai" flavour, do add fish sauce 1-3 tbsp at the very end, along with a tsp of brown sugar, and try substituting basil for cilantro. I made it following these steps, used 1 tbsp of an indian madras curry paste (i've never found a commercial thai curry paste that remotely resembles the real thing), and regular coconut milk. the flavour is decent and satisfies a thai craving, although of course not terribly authentic.

A waste of good coconut milk and a fine-looking butternut squash. Toronto was right on the money -- pasty and flavorless. If you must make it, do add the fish oil and peanuts. And drink lots of red wine: it gets slightly better after four or five glasses...

I actually make this with sweet potatoes; it's much less of a production than the squash, and it's at least as good. I also use half regular coconut milk and half light; it makes a big difference in the flavor.

On the page, a compelling mix of flavours. On the plate, a pasty and flavourless disaster! It has spice but manages to be bland. Perhaps substituting the squash with shrimp and adding more stock would help? Good from afar but far from good.

This is a really good and very easy recipe. I followed the recommendations below and added a generous shot of fish sauce at the simmer stage and some peanuts just before serving. Not having tried without them, I cannot compare, but they were really good and seemed to help. I heartily recommend this one.

We really enjoyed a modified version of this recipe. I added some Thai fish sauce (perhaps a tablespoon or so -- obviously a no-no if you need to keep this vegetarian) and that really perked up and brought out the flavor. I suspect that the dish just needed some added salt. If you can't use the fish sauce, I'd suggest soy sauce or using plain salt. I've also made this with shrimp (instead of butternut squash) and it was a keeper; I quickly stirred fried the shrimp and added them to the pasta and shrimp. We were impressed by the "rich" flavor of the dish considering the relatively low fat content.

I agree with previous reviewers - perhaps chicken and peanuts would add to this already fabulous recipe. The udon noodles were a little strange, but cooked for only 2-3 minutes they were fine. Don't overcook the squash and this will be a great meal!

I made this dish for a vegetarian friend of mine. I followed the recipe, but served it over wild rice instead. We both though it was great; sweet and spicy, and not too heavy. I served it with a romaine and pear salad, and a nice loaf of bread. Finish it off with a sweet/fruity white wine, and you can't miss. It was also very easy to make. I will be making this one again.

Followed the recipe, but added chicken as suggested...it was a little boring. the heat mostly cooked out of the peppers by the time i plated it up and the coconut flavor wasn't really there. overall it was kinda disappointing.

Loved this as a nice change. Adding chopped peanuts makes the recipe. Also - I added some chopped chicken for protein (as I don't like tofu) and that made it even better.

Great recipe! I have made this easy dish for many of my non-meat eating friends and they love it. I sometimes leave out the extra pepper and sometimes put in a bit more red curry. Every time I have made it, it has been a big hit!

The flavor was nice but lacking some complexity. It would be better as a side dish or part of a composed plate. I served it with peanuts to give it more texture.

This was a nice,wintery dish. My husband just loved that it got spicier as left-overs (I just loved that he was eating left-overs!!!)Anyway, I thought it was a nice dish and I will make it again. (I would buy a pre-sliced squash, but otherwise, it was good).

I have made this several times at home and actually brought this receipe with me on a business trip to Montana where I made it for some of my clients. They loved it. I do add some chili paste as I like my food hot. I lost my recipe on my Montana trip and wanted to make it again so I searched it out on the Web. That is how much I liked this recipe!

The whole dish was a soggy mess. It sounded wonderful, but the reality was very disappointing. Needs a lot more zing and spice and crunch - perhaps chilli peppers and chopped peanuts and scallions would help to improve it.

Yuk. I'd actually rate this as 0 if there was one. I love this website and all of the recipes have been at least good if not excellent. But this one was awful. My husband, bless his heart actually ate it but I could only eat a few bites before throwing it away. Bad combination of foods. I think the coconut milk and lime were the offenders. I forgot to add the cilantro which I had chopped but I don't think it could have been improved.

Wonderful recipe! I added an extra jalapeno to give it an extra kick--very yummy and easy.

This was very good -- especially liked the flavors of lime, coconut milk, and squash as a combination. I, too, made a few changes. I added strips of red pepper and green peas to increase the color. I also added some sauteed tofu. I took the "add peanuts" suggestion as well, and highly recommend it.

Although this is a vegetarian dish, I served it with Grilled Beef Tenderloin Steaks in Balsamic Marinade from the July 1998 issue to rave reviews! I also tried to cut a corner and use a bag of pre-cut frozen butternut squash. The flavor is still there, but it tends to make the dish a little mushy. I use the linguine in the recipe and overall, it has become a favorite recipe to try on guests at dinner parties. Excellent flavor combinations!

I substituted some chickpeas for about 1/3 of the butternut squash and it really enhanced the dish.

I only used 8 oz of Udon, as the packages only came in this size, and it was perfect. It had just the right amount of sauce with that much Udon. The flavors are wonderful. The red curry and coconut milk combine very well with the coconut milk. Excellent vegetarian dish, very hearty. :-)
