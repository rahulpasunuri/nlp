When our CSA basket is overflowing with delicious carrots in the fall, we make this lovely soup at least once a week. It only takes 10 minutes to prepare and the results are always delicious. We use chicken broth and water and we usually throw parsley on top rather than nuts.

I've made this soup several time. I love it for being quick and light. Makes a great soup"shooter" for a party. Add a bit of maple syrup or brown sugar to the pecans when toasting.

Wasn't sure what all the buzz was about this soup. I made it with chicken broth but found it rather bland. Thought it needed more cumin and eventually added curry powder to liven up the flavor. It was good but feel there are more flavorful versions of this soup.

Quick, easy, flavorful. I made it as written and wouldn't change a thing.

This is a fabulous and easy recipe. I doubled the recipe and made it almost exactly as written, substituting chicken broth for water and swirling in a bit of creme fraiche at the end to finish. Very delicious, comforting and rich while not being heavy, and so fast! I used an immersion blender so it was a breeze to clean.

So easy and soooo good! I used chicken stock so it had more body. I didn't have pecans so I used toasted almonds which were good also. Everything else was as stated in the recipe. I will make this soup again soon, everyone loved it!

Really, really tasty and pretty simple to make. I used vegan margarine so that it was completely dairy-free. Didn't miss the butter at all.

Rating: 3
Everyone liked this soup; most present had seconds; there was none left over. It's also very simple to make and doesn't call for a lot of ingredients. In all, a winning combination. I used chicken stock vs. water and I confess to not cutting back on the butter at all and I even added a bit of heavy cream that I had in the fridge. I would recommend definitely using the pecans--just toasted in the oven or in a frying pan--they added a lot to the soup, we thought.

Loved this soup both for its flavor and simplicity. Like other reviewers, I used homemade chicken stock. Other than that, I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. My family enjoyed it so I will make this again.

I LOVE this recipe! It's very easy and quick to make. I used olive oil instead of butter; I also added a 1/4 tsp. more cumin, as well as 1/2 tsp. of cayenne. This is one of my favorite soup recipes...

I served this over the weekend as a first course at a dinner party for 12 people, and it was a huge hit. I made 6 times the amount called for and had plenty to go around and a considerable amount leftover. I made a few modifications based on other reviews - I used vegetable stock instead of water and cut the butter in half. For spices, I used 1/2 the amount of cumin called for, and added an equal amount of curry powder and coriander. I also added a little dollop of creme fraiche as a garnish before sprinkling on the pecans.

Unbelievably easy, inexpensive and delicious. I added a little half and half to finish- but would have been perfect as is.

this soup is easy and tasty. i've used water and roasted vegetable stock, both with success. dry roasted pecans add a nice dimension, have also used a bit of crema as a garnish.

I gave this recipe 4 forks because it meets both my weekday criteria: very good, and very easy! I usually make it with chicken stock rather than water, for a slightly richer soup, but otherwise follow the recipe (more/less!). If I don't have pecans, a drizzle of yogurt at serving time really perks up the dish

Rating: 3
This was my first time making carrot soup. I thought it would be easy with the few ingredients it called for, and it was. I followed the recipe to the letter but when I tasted it, it seemed to be missing something so I added a bit of sugar, that didn't do it so I added cinnamon and it was perfect. And I agree with the other reviews that broth may be better than using water. The pecans gave it a special touch.

Rating: 3
This is so delicious and simple, I found everything in my college student pantry. When I make it again, I'll probably make it with less butter. It's a easy recipe that you don't have to pay much attention to and it lends itself to many variations. It tastes great the way it is though!

Very easy and delicious. I've made it according to the original recipe but have since substituted curry powder and coriander which gives it a more complex flavor. It's also more flavorful with the chicken stock but also good with just water.

Superb! Delicate and subtle, but keeps you wanting more. I was a bit skeptical at first, but this is definitely a keeper. Who knew that such a simple recipe could produce such an outstanding soup!? Simple, easy to make again and again (just don't skip the blender bit!).

A great simple soup! Like others, I substituted chicken broth for the water. I also used a few bay leaves which added some good flavor. I will definitely make it again soon.

We loved this recipe. I tripled this recipe for a dinner party. To simplify the recipe I used baby carrots (27 ounces.) I also replaced the water with chicken broth. Though I served it with the toasted pecans, I would leave them out next time.

Rating: 4
Wow! I added a can of butter beans in the simmering stage - helped to thicken up the consistancy. Added another can of butter beans at the end (un-pureeed) to make the whole dish heartier. Added a dollup of sour cream just before serving along with the pecans. Great presentation. Served with homemade beer bread for a complete meal.

I made this recipe X 10 for a dinner party as a first course (assumed this reciped served one person generously--my peeps don't eat like rabbits!). We all loved it and no surprise, I did wind up having leftovers. Because a) my first batch in the food processor didn't have a creamy enough texture and b) pureeing so much soup was not an enticing thought, I served it as a broth--it was delicious. I also added a few tsp of cinnamon, red pepper flakes and cayenne powder to the mix because I was low on cumin--again, tasted yummy.Stirred a teaspoon of heavy cream into each bowl just before serving , which made the soup heartier and easier on the eyes. Of course, because I skipped the pureeing, I ommitted the pecans.

Rating: 3
Mmm! It's great if you just follow the recipe, but it's even better with about a cup of shredded sweet potato added in with the carrots! I definitely had to reduce the butter, also.

Yum! Very good and easy to make - I chopped the onions and the carrots in the food processor since I tripled the recipe and it cooked very quickly. I would probably use less butter next time, though.

Great soup. VERY easy. I doubled the recipe but halved the butter. Added a couple of yams too because I had some that needed using. skipped the pecans (one less step) and added a dallop of low fat sour cream for garnish instead. You can eyeball everything in this recipe. Had a couple of friends over and they nearly licked the pot.

This was a great soup, and actually my first carrot soup. The pecans did not add as much as I hoped, but they did add a festive look when put on top. I used chicken broth instead of water, cut the butter in half, and took out the butter used to toast the pecans. This is definately a keeper.

Rating: 2
A super simple recipe, but somewhat lacking in flavour. Next time I'll substitute chicken stock for water for just a little more oomph without overpowering the natural carrot flavour.

Rating: 4
I find that the soup is good with water rather than stock *if* you use less water than the recipe calls for. I made it with about half the amount of water (just enough to cover the vegs) and then thinned it out, to taste, when it was done, and it was extremely good.

Rating: 4
This soup is easy, cheap, and healthy, keeps well, and tastes great. Don't skip the pecans: it's okay without them but awesome with them. Pecans also make it more filling: it's not very substantial without them.

Rating: 4
This has become one of my favorite soups because it's so easy to make, quick and delicious. I use organic carrots to make the soup sweeter and the color more robust. The toasted, buttered pecans are wonderful. I ususally triple the recipe to have plenty left over.

This soup tasted good...nothing that made me swoon but really did taste good. It was so incredibly easy and fast and, even though I used canned chicken stock in place of water, it was fairly low-calorie. I estimated, even with the pecans, that it would be between 150 and 200 calories per serving. It really only uses things I have on hand so I'm sure I'll make it again soon.

Husband with sore throat loved it! Very quick & easy. Used a level teaspoon of cumin, one stick celery & one clove garlic. On serving, added finely-grated fresh ginger & finely chopped tops of green onions. Didn't miss the pecans. Have added to the "good enough for guests" list!

I thought this was good, and I'd make again. The soup was a good proportion of vegetables to liquid (I used chicken broth, too), which made for a very creamy consistency. I agree that the pecans were an important touch.

This is probably my husband's favorite soup. He says he'd eat it every day if he could. We agree that it needs chicken stock instead of plain water. We also add 1/2 teaspoon of yellow curry in addition to the cumin. Very tasty. :) Don't omit the pecans. They really add to the soup.

VERY nice soup! I agree that the cumin does not overpower...just adds lovely flavor. I also made this with chicken stock instead of water. Much more body. My only complaint is the consistency...not quite as smooth as I'd like. Maybe just a hint of cream during the blending process?

My husband said he liked this recipe, but only in small servings. I didn't care for it at all, although I like cooked carrots. It needs more and/or different seasoning. It looked like baby food. I usually enjoy recipes from this sight, but this one just wasn't for me!

Rating: 3
I have an abundance of carrots this summer, and I thought this soup was quite tasty and relatively simple to prepare. The toasted pecans add interest and flavor, so don't skip those. I seasoned the soup as the recipe instructs and found that it needed a little something, so I added a bit more cumin, several grinds of pepper and a pinch of cayenne (I like heat- others might not like this). Just as good the next day, re-heated.

I love this soup & so does everyone who tries it! I've made it several times & am always asked for the recipe. I throw in some minced garlic at the end of sauteeing the onion, I add a stock of celery, chopped, and I use vegetable stock instead of water. I like the pecan topping, but actually prefer topping the soup with a dollop of sour cream & a sprinkling of chopped cilantro. YUM!!

I have made this several times since it is so easy. I have always quadrupled it to have enough for a couple days. I use half water half stock to cut down on the sodium. But I only double the butter. You can make this thick or thin depending on how many carrots you add. Scrumptious!

We just made this for a dinner party and everyone asked for seconds! I doubled the recipe and used one stalk of celery, 1 clove of garlic (minced), Chicken broth and sprinkled freshly grated fresh ginger on top. We also made it a little thicker so we could use it to pour two thick soups, at the same time, in the same bowl. Looked great and tasted wonderful.

Very nice soup. Used vegetable broth rather than water, threw in a few cloves of garlic with the onion, and, most importantly, added a few tablespoons of raw minced ginger after puréing the soup -- so good!!! Also tried it both with and without the pecans: to my surprise I actually preferred it without them (they overwhelm the soup a bit).

Perfect consistancy! Wonderful flavors! So simple! Although I used 1/2 onion plus two shallot cloves. Since I didnt try it with only onion I wouldnt know, but I think shallots are always subtle in flavor. My husband rated this #1!

Do yourself a favor and buy a beautiful bunch of sweet, fresh organic carrots. It is worth if for this is a wonderful receipe. A great first course,especially for the vegetarians. I was tempted to use chicken broth, but it really doesn't need it. Double or triple the receipe and serve it in hot soup bowls for company.What a great find!

Rating: 4
This soup was absolutely wonderful--and, while I'm sure there are others that are as good, this recipe gets my vote because largely of the simplicity. I used a bag of baby carrots (didn't bother chopping them) and tripled the recipe--in no time and with almost no effort (and no trip to the grocery store!), I had tasty soup for six.

The pecans really do make this soup great - we thought it just okay without the pecans. If you like this recipe, you must try 'Carrot Soup with Ginger and Lemon' also on this website - we like it even better.

Very good soup. I added 1/2 teasp caraway seeds while the onions were cooking and it added a nice flavor in combination with the cumin (suprisingly enough). I gave my guests a choice of croutons or pecans - both toasted with 'jerk' spice. Plus a little salt since the spice was salt-free. Served with a drizzeling of thinned sour cream. By the way, if you use broth..use GOOD broth and not from those dried cubes. It makes a difference.

This soup was great and easy to make. I also used less butter (about half) and veggie stock instead of water. I can't believe something so rich could be so healthy. Next time I may try a little nutmeg.

Wonderful! Rich (in fact, I added quite a bit of extra broth & it was STILL rich & creamy - even without adding any cream.) VERY flavorful, though next time, I think I'll add some sea salt to bring out the flavors even more - and perhaps a touch of garlic would not be amiss. Perhaps my only 'complaint' is that it did not make enough! This keeps well - I made enough for dinner that evening & several (3) lunches during the work-week - and still have about a cup left to savor with something else. I'm wondering how it will freeze, and may try that, next time.

Very good and very simple. A nice recipe for a wintry day. I too used less butter, and chicken stock instead of water. I'm planning to use other spices another time, and to substitute some of the onions by leeks.

Perfect for a cold winter night--IF you doctor it up a bit and cut out some butter! I only used a half tablespoon of butter for the onions, and used half water, half chicken stock. I did need to add some stock since I decreased the butter. Added white pepper and coriander with the cumin, and, at the end, a splash of skim milk for creaminess. I decreased nuts to 1 T (no butter!), but they ARE a must!!! (I'm eating leftovers as I write this!)

This was a terrific recipe for a Sunday night when you don't feel like going to the store, but you want to eat something delicious! The recipe includes most things already in your kitchen. I, like others, used chicken broth, but, added a dash of allspice to round off the flavor of the cumin. I served it with a dollop of sour cream in the middle to counterpoint the soup's richness and create more depth to its flavors. It tastes great served with quesadillas and guacamole!

Delicious! My husband has been clamoring for this (clamoring! for carrots!) since I made it, and I thought it was lovely, too...very subtle, and the toasted pecans are terrific on it. Substitute if you must, but at least give the nuts a try. A little budgum of sour cream is good, too.

This is a delicious and nutrient loaded soup which is both easy and quickly made. The substitution of diced Jicama, for the pecans, adds a unique crunchiness for a textural contrast with the smooth soup. I don't particularly like nuts hence the substitution. Equally good is the use of chicken broth i.p.o. water.
