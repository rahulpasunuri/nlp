Very good, had to sub 2 tbsp ground ginger for fresh ginger. When I make this again I'm going to double the sauce (as others have said) and add baby corn and julienne carrots. Serving over rice would probably taste good as well.

Do not waste your time and money making this recipe. It takes about an hour to make and was barely edible.

I loved this dish but the next time I make it I'd add choopped honey roasted peanuts to the recipe or Thai peanut sauce as someone else suggested. I think this would really be great with the peanuts. And possibly I'd add ginger as well.

This is a great, easy recipe. I added some shredded carrot and julienned yellow pepper. I usually up the spice and cilantro a bit as well.

The base recipe is a good start, but it was SO bland. We like a lot more kick to our food, and added chili sauce, more cilantro, and a bit of thai peanut sauce. Adding lime juice would improve it as well.

AMAZING chicken recipe! I never cook Asian food but my husband really wanted lettuce wraps so I made this chicken salad. It is delicious and healthy and so full of flavor. I doubled the dressing (including the crushed red pepper) and diced rather than shredded the chicken. I also added minced ginger to the garlic and served with these toppings separately: shredded carrots stir-fried in sesame oil for a minute, crushed peanuts, sliced water chestnuts, pea shoots, and cellophane noodles. Wrapped the whole thing up in butter lettuce leaves. Restaurant quality!

Great recipe! I added a little soy to the poaching liquid, and added a lot of ginger to the dressing. Omitted the cilanto and mushrooms because my family doesn't like them. Added matchstick carrots and snow peas to sub for the mushrooms. Also added some coursely chopped cashews for crunch. It turned out excellent! I used the leftovers with a boxed pad thai mix (the noodles and sauce) for a quick midweek supper. I just drained some of the dressing off and tossed it in. Delicious! And I love a recipe that can do double duty!

Loved it! I agree with the previous reviewers on doubling the sauce. Also, I think that almost any vegetable addition (eg. carrots) would be nice. I think I'll omit the cilantro next time...a few people said it took away from the other flavors.

Yum!! My husband and I loved this recipe. Although we did double the dressing. I also grated some ginger into the dressing since it didn't seem to permeate the chicken as much as I would have liked. I also substituted grated carrots for the mushrooms because my husband hates mushrooms. It was an especially pleasing dinner and I'm looking forward to my leftovers for lunch.

Cold chicken salad? I'd rather order in a pizza! But the ingredients were so inviting, I just had to try this recipe. I read the reviews and doubled the sauce, but I shouldn't have doubled the hot pepper -- too spicy for my kids! Also, poached the chicken in chicken stock for added flavor and served with pasta. The perfect quick & easy Sunday night pre-bowling dinner!

I love this recipe! It is a simple meal that doesn't taste so simple. I used butter lettuce which was phenomenal, they are already cupped and so tender crisp. One omission...no shiitakes, had to make child friendly. This is also great cold as a light lunch.

Delicious! I took a few liberties and made it vegan-style -- I used soy "chicken," left out the mushrooms (didn't have any on hand) and served it with wide rice noodles. I will definitely be making this dish again.

This was really good. So refreshing, I could make it all summer long. It's also quick. I had leftovers for lunch the next day, and it was even more delicious. Husband loved it.

I did not care for the texture of the shiitakes after so long on the heat, but the dressing (as many have noted) is quite good, so I will be using that in other salads & for dipping in the future. (I used chili paste in place of flakes in the dressing.)

I enjoyed the recipe. I don't like mushrooms but the shiitakes in this recipe were good. I used rice wine vinegar and served over thin rice noodles. It was great. The only thing I had a problem with was the recipe did not yield enough sauce. Guess I'll just double it next time.

As written, this recipe was acceptable but lackluster. Luckily, I had heeded the advice of previous reviewers and made extra sauce which I then used for dipping. This made a big difference. I served the chicken in wrap sandwiches with lettuce and had plenty of sauce on hand. (I ended up making 4x the sauce, using the specified amount in the chicken and the rest for dipping--its very quick & easy.) Note: this recipe tasted even better the next day.

I'm not a fan of mushrooms or ginger so I had to alter this a bit and use baby bok choy, but it was delicious. I would definitely make this again and again!

This recipe is exquisite =) We always double the sauce recipe and add 1 1/2 tablespoons of Mirin. It is very easy to double, triple or even quadruple this recipe to accommodate a large group of people. P.S. YOU MUST USE ASIAN SEASONED RICE VINEGAR!!! If you do not it will not taste right.

not one of the best

I also made a few changes. Added julianne carrots and snow peas (slightly blanched). Also added a bit of mirin to the sauce. I added the sauce to roasted chicken (I purchased) and tossed with thick pasta noodles. My guest loved it. Would be great over soba noodles, too.

We really liked this recipe i did add a couple of things to the sauce , I omited the pepper flakes and added about a teaspoon of " Sambal Oelek" and 1 tablespoon of Mirin . I also doubled the sauce recipe 1/2 to add to the chicken and 1/2 as a dipping sauce and sprinkled the chicken with chopped peanuts and bean sprouts . I served it with a asian green bean salad .....I will be making this again SOON !

This recipe was very easy and very pretty. Makes a great dish to serve to guests. It would be good with sesame seeds or cashews.

Lots of good ingredients...but out of proportion, I think. The cilantro added a great touch, but there was too much flavor of soy sauce and rice vinegar, not enough ginger. The dressing seemed to overpower the mushrooms, unfortunately.

Excellent recipe and is a low carb/low fat meal. I'm really surprised that I didn't have to amend the dressing. It was perfect the way it was. Like another reviewer, I made extra to pour over the lettuce. I also agree that the ginger in the simmering water didn't add much to the recipe. If I were pinching pennies or time, which I usually am, I'd skip that step. This will be a great way to serve left over chicken- really quick meal to do it that way.

Made this for a lucheon and it was very well liked. Very tasty.

Very tasty! It reminded my husband and I of Thai beef salad - with chicken instead of beef and no lime juice and with the same kick. I am not sure about the ginger when poaching the chicken - I could smell a note of ginger once the chicken was done, but just could not taste it. I may leave the ginger out the next time I make it & add a very small amount to the dressing. We also made twice the amount of dressing so we could drizzle some over lettuce.
