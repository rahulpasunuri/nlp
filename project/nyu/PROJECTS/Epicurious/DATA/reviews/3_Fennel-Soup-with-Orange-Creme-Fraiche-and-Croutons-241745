This is a fantastic recipe, with a couple of modifications. I added more garlic, and substituted vegetable broth for the water. And, I added a dash of sherry at the end. Truly delicious.

I also found this to be too bland. I added salt, which brought out a lot more flavor, especially the orange in the creme fraiche. But it still wasn't that flavorful, although it was certainly easy. Stock is a sensible suggestion.

I agree... certainly an interesting idea, but I felt like I needed to add plenty of salt to add flavor, and I don't generally do that.

Quick and easy, but I think it was missing something. I think I'd make it again, I'd just have to get a little creative. The base is only water which doesn't add any flavor, so at a minimum I think it should be stock or at least let it reduce a little longer.
