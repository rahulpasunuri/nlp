Seriously, could this be more delicious? No way! Such a beautiful sauce--looks impressive, easy to make and tastes like a million bucks. At the end of the night my guests were standing around my stove with spoons in their hands eating it straight out of the sauce pan. Fantastic!

Perfect! Delicious, easy, and impressive. My go-to sauce.

This is a really, really, really delicious sauce. I made an ice cream cake with chocolate wafer crust and layered the caramel sauce with vanilla ice cream. I had made two cakes and thought I would save one for later. It was such a hit I had to go get the other one. I don't believe the recipe said to toast the nuts but I did and I thought I had raisins but I had prunes so I used them instead. Really nice.
