You can add an Italian touch by replacing the orange/lemon with balsamic vinegar.

My father-in-law doesn't normally like squash, but really liked this recipe. Served with Moroccan spiced roasted chicken. Fresh tasting.

This was a very weird recipe. I didn't really like the citrus-y flavour it added to the usually sweet squash, and none of my family did either. Won't make this again

Good squash recipe. Next time I will try it with the lime zest as suggested below.

What a nice way to cook butternut squash. At first when I put the squash into the saute pan with the other ingredients I thought there was too much liquid, so I let it cook a little longer than specified in the recipe. This worked just fine and the squash absorbed any extra liquid. The overall flavor was kind of mild, plesantly sweet with a hint of citrus. This recipe is definitely a keeper, not to mention pretty easy.

Love the sweet combo of orange and honey! Since I don't have a zester, i used grated orange rind and more than suggested. I also sprinkled cinnamon on the squash, stirred it in, and let it meld with the other flavors. A little salt and no pepper, and it was a wonderful side dish.

Very nice side dish. I agree with the other reviewer who substituted lime zest for the orange - a better contrast for the sweetness of the butternut squash.

Very nice. Never one to leave a recipe alone, the second time I tried this, I replaced some of the orange zest with lime zest and grated fresh ginger - and that turned out even more lovely. Try this!

This recipe smells as good as it tastes!! It's very easy to make and the orange and honey flavor are a great combination with the squash.
