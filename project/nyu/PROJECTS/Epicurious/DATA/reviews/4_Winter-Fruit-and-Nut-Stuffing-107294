Exceptional stuffing - perfect alongside the Bon Appetit Herb-Roasted Turkey with Apple Cider Gravy! I would absolutely make it again. I considered adding sausage, but am glad that I didn't - the stuffing has great complexity of flavor without the addition.

Fantastic recipe. I used wheat bread, no apricots (didn't have any), lots of dried cranberries and threw in a couple of small apples (with the pears, treated them the same). I also added what we call fauxage, which are the veggie sausage links. Also used a white wine and wheat bread. I can see the potential for variation in this brilliant little recipe, and while dinner isn't ready yet I am having a hard time keeping my hands (and those of my four young sons) out of the pan. This will be a staple for years to come. I made mine in a pan, is slightly crisp on top while moist and supremely flavorful. Wish I could rate it 5 forks!

LOVE this recipe. I've made it the past two thanksgivings and plan to make it again this year! It is so tasty, even the carnivores are fighting over it. Tip: I use a nice big rosemary loaf when making this. It just adds a little more holiday spirit :)

This stuffing pairs nicely with pork. Served it for a dinner party alongside a pork loin a few years ago....everyone loved it. Will be serving for easter dinner along with a ham this year. I do add some chicken broth so that the stuffing doesn't come out dry.

This was sooooo fabulous!! Just follow the instructions as written. I did use Reisling as another reviewer wrote since it is definitely easier to find. One note: This is a sweet dressing and quite moist; we did not make any gravy to go with it.

Wonderful stuffing. I made it with gluten free bread. I subbed the prunes for figs and would recommend adding about 1-2 cups of broth before you cook it or it'll be a little dry. It's sweet but delicious.

I have been making this for at least four years now, and both sides of the family always request it. I use cornbread (Trader Joe's Mix) and it comes out more like dessert, but it is amazing! It's also a very forgiving recipe-- use what you love and what you have, you can hardly go wrong.

I made this stuffing 4 years ago and it's incredibly delicious. I'm not one who likes stuffing and neither is my husband but since my first year making it, my whole family requests that I make this stuffing each year. It's so full of flavor and compliments the turkey so well. You will get plenty of praise for this dish!

My post-college foodie stepson and my finicky young teen children both requested this stuffing this year, the third year I'll serve it. Rarely does any one dish make everyone in our house happy :)

My husband insists on this stuffing every year and I can't blame him. It's one of the only three stuffing recipes I've ever found that I like. This year I'll be making a triple-batch to take to our 60-person Thanksgiving buffet!

I've made this 3 years in a row and it continues to be a crowd favorite. Very easy and delicious. This year I added a pomegranate and used rosemary bread instead of plain bread. Yum!

A delicious stuffing that pleased both the vegetarians and omnivores at my Thanksgiving table. I made it exactly as directed except I covered the dish with foil for the first 20 minutes of bake time, then uncovered and baked for 25 minutes more.

I think this is a delicious dressing, and I followed the recipe exactly. I don't know if the rest of the guests liked it as much as I did, because I had a lot leftover. We had a lot of dishes to sample, but I think this recipe could easily serve 16, not 8. When I make it again, I'll use everything the same, with half the bread.

Incredible recipe although I changed it quite a bit - substituted green apples for the pears, omitted the prunes but added some currants, and used chestnuts instead of the pecans - it was awesome! I'll definitely be using this again!

Best stuffing I've ever made! I did added less of the prunes and apricots, and a little more bread because I did no want it too fruity/sweet. Also, I rosted the walnuts. It turned out AMAZING!

Awesome, but I made some changes. 1) I cooked it (up until the bread) a few days in advance. I wanted the discordant flavors to blend; 2) I substituted persimmons for the pears, figs for the prunes, dried cherries for the cranberries, and added the seeds of one pomegranate; 3) I used Viognier for it's creaminess; 4) I added chicken stock; and 5) I added 1# chopped chicken and sauteed chicken livers. This helped give it a depth and richness I thought the original lacked. The result reminded me a bit of my grand aunt's mincemeat pies, and a bit of a fig pate.

I've made this three or four times. It's outstanding. I've made it to accompany a spiral ham. Just be sure you REALLY love dried fruit before considering.

I LOVE this recipe. I've also made it with rice-- stir fruit and onion mixture into rice of choice cooked in Chicken broth. Add cinnamon, Salt and Pepper to taste and Nuts before serving. The rice is awesome with pork, lamb or chicken in the spring.

This is one of the world's great foods! Don't hesitate to make this. I follow the instructions to a "t" and have been totally successful every time I make this (which is a lot!). Do not over-saute the pears and you will have plenty of juices for moisture. Of course we all like to experiment, but you can use this recipe exactly as is(altho I usually substitute Riesling for sauturnes ((sp)) because hard to find) Truly a keeper for ever!

This dressing is quite possibly one of the best things I have ever eaten. It is fabulous with turkey or pork. The moisture helps when we freeze leftovers. Absolutely delicious.

My family enjoyed this stuffing but we like dried fruit! I substituted riesling for sauterne and we added a can of chicken broth before we stuffed it into the turkey. It was even better the next day as a leftover.

I love dried fruit in my dressing so I had to try this one...very tasty. I may try it again with apples instead of pears. I also left out the nuts...personal preference.

Fabulous! I love this stuffing. I can't wait to make this again and again. I didn't use all the bread and added a little bit of stock to moisten up the bread. It was moist and flavorful.

A really nice recipe. Just make sure that your guests don't have a problem with fruit in the stuffing. My husband thought the concept was gross and wouldn't even try it. No need to use 10 Tab. of butter. Just used a few of marjarine and it was sufficient.

I tried this as something different for Thanksgiving- even though I was a bit put off by the expense of all the ingredients. Bad idea- even though it looked and smelled good while making the fruit/vegetable mixture, once the prunes were added it al turned an unappetizing shade of brown (like the spoonful shown in the picture.) It was very dry after adding the bread, and no one touched it- a big waste. Make the chile-and-corn stuffing on this site instead- it was gone before Thanksgiving dinner was over, and I've had requests for a second batch to go with the turkey leftovers.

This was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving celebration. I left out the prunes and used cherry flavored cranberries. I also used quite a bit of chicken broth to make it moist. Delicious!!!!

Loved this stuffing! You may need more broth for it, it dried up quickly.

Best stuffing I've made or tasted. Substituted half apple cider and half sherry for the Sauternes; found it a bit dry-looking halfway through baking so I added extra liquid. Delicious!

I haven't made this yet, but to the person who complained about the recipe not being the same as the one in the magazine, I reviewed the magazine and it says to not add broth and to bake covered for part of the time and and then uncover for last few minutes.

This is absolutely sublime. I didn't use the prunes but it turned out wonderfully and now it's a regular holiday must!

This is a wonderful holiday stuffing . Substituted Johannisberger Riesling for the Sauternes but made no other changes. This recipe makes a LOT of stuffing. The reviewer before me is wrong about the broth etc. Those were general directions that do not apply to this recipe.

Please proof read your website recipes. It is unfortunate that your website failed to mention the addition of broth to the recipe otherwise required for baking in a dish according to the Bon Appetit recipe (Nov. 2002). 3/4 to 1 and 1/2 cups of broth, according to the magazine. Also your web site prescribed baking uncovered; Bon Appetit called for baking covered. These changes made a difference: the result from your website printout was a far cry from your magazine published version.

This stuffing was so good, it was almost like a bread pudding. We didn't have sauternes, so we mixed chardonnay, dry sherry & apple juice, and worked great. Colorful and delicious!

I made this for the first time last year and I am making it again it was so great! Most of the 40 people I had for dinner loved it. I made one change and used an artisan bread instead of regular bread, perfect!

I made this recipe for the first time last year and loved it. Altho I forgot to add the nuts, it was still delicious. I plan to make it again this year. Do as much prep the day before as possible, then it's simple to assemble and bake.

I served this at Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. Instead of using the Sauternes I used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 pinot blanc (any sweeter German white would work) as I was afraid it would be too sweet. It was fantastic and I'm going to use it again to stuff a pork loin roast!

This is a great change of pace from my usual sage and cornbread stuffing. I pretty well agree with everyones coments on how good it is. I prefer to toast the bread and then added about a cup of turkey broth to it because it was too dry from the toasting. I may experiment with subsituting some cornbread for part of the white bread to give it a more southern flavor. I used roasted hazelnuts instead of pecans. I wonder how some chopped jalapeno peppers would taste in this. The prep and cooking time on this is at least about an hour so next time I will make the fruit part the day before.

We made it for Christmas Dinner and invited 3 families over to celebrate, it was the hit of the dinner. It was easy, since we prepared the fruit mixture a day ahead and just finished it off and put in the over when the turkey came out to rest. Definately on our table in the future.

One of the best stuffings I've ever made, or for that matter, ever had! Great textures and blending of flavors. I paired this with the red currant and citrus glazed turkey, and it was a great complement to this dish. Will definitely make again!

Wonderful! Did not end up looking at all like the photo, but great taste, texture. Fruit mixture can be made ahead, just toss bread and pecans before baking. Big hit at our Thanksgiving, and will be a family tradition now !

This is a comples, but not hard to make, very spectacular stuffing. The flavors and ingredients delight and surprise, and held up very well for a leftover dinner the night after Thanksgiving. This will be a welcome staple to our holiday menu.
