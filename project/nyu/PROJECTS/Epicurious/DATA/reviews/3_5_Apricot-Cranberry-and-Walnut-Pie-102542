Love this pie and have loved it for YEARS! so much better than the traditional pecan pie (if you are looking for a nut pie for the holidays). Wonderful!

I have made this pie since I first found the recipe. I lost said recipe and have been in a quandry trying to find it. Got out an old copy of bon Appetit and found your web address. Thank you for this great pie. L bunton

I like to celebrate the seasons with seasonal food and found this pie perfect for late autumn/early winter. Each time I've made the pie it was delightfully chewy but not dry. This may be because the dried apricots were moist and Ichopped them small. The recipe is very easy to make and refrigerates well. I just microwave the slices to warm before serving.

Too dry! I tried rehydrating the apricots with hot water, but it didn't do much good. I served it for Thanksgiving and some people liked it, but I didn't. I suspected that the pie wasn't going to be on the moist side when I read how little liquid is used; I was hoping it might still turn out though.

This pie is very good, I found it a bit too dry though. I served it for thankgiving and all who ate it like it. I made it with Apricots, cherrys and pecans. We all agreed, we would hydrate the apricots and the cherrys first, then add a bit more cream next time.

This was super easy. I did it with apricots, dried cherries and a mixture of 1 cup pecans and 1/2 cup walnuts, it was really good! A definate hit at my dinner party!

I made this pie for thanksgiving this year. My husband and I managed to eat half of it for dessert that day. I took the leftovers to work, and they were gone instantly. I had many requests for your recipe. Everybody LOVED this pie!

Incredible! I loathe apricots and made the pie thinking there would be no temptation...WRONG! The aroma from the oven alone told me this was something special..co-workers (my willing guinea pigs)loved it to the extent that I had to taste it for myself...superb! Will make it again..and again! Also, the dried cherries and pecans sounds intriguing...will try that, too. Perfect..and easy for even the "I don't bake or cook" group..it's foolproof and WONDERFUL.

This is a fantastic pie!! I made 3 pies on Thanksgiving, and this was the clear winner.

Damn good pie! I made two, one following the recipe exactely. The other I used 3/4 cup dried apricots and 3/4 cup dried cherries. I also ran out of walnuts so I added 1 cup of pecans to the 1/2 cup walnuts I had. I also added a little moisture (a splash extra of whipping cream). Both pies were excellent.
