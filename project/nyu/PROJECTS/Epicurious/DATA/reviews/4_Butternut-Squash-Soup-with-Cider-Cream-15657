Loved this soup! Looked beautiful and tasted rich and satisfying. I used only one apple and 2 lb squash already cut up from Whole Foods. Made the process easier. The cider cream is key--don't skip! Definitely will make again.

I have made this soup many, many times, and it is one of my fall standbys. The first few times I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. Now I know that it is a very forgiving recipe, and I make shorcuts whenever possible. I use frozen carrots, applesauce if I don't have apples, and recently even tried using thawed frozen "winter squash" from the grocery store. This squash is cheaper and much less labor. Even this didn't do anything negative to the soup - the flavor was basically the same, although the color was a bit redder. I added the thawed squash when I added the apples. I also always add 1 tsp. cinnamon and a few dashes of fresh nutmeg at that point. One of my favorite soups by far!

Definitely the weakest part of Christmas dinner. Until adding the apples and apple cider, this smelled amazing. But the apples threw this soup's flavors out of whack, making it too tart, too sweet, and not nearly savory enough. If we were to make this again, I think we'd add only one apple and possibly no cider at all, but for the cider cream.

I've made this soup many times now as it has become part of the repertoire in my traditional holiday menu. I usually use hard cider, although it's very good either way. It's nice to do so much of it ahead of time. It is perfectly sublime as written, but I have cut back on the fat when it's not for company by using non-stick spray instead of butter, non-fat evaporated milk instead of cream, and non-fat sour cream instead of regular. It turns a superb soup into a healthy, tasty one.

I am very disappointed with this recipe. I read the reviews before deciding to make this but it did not live up to my ideas. I found it to be unbalanced and not very savory. I will not make it again. It has given me some ideas - so at least I have a starting point. No apples - maybe some potato and certainly more savory flavor.

With 293 reviews already submitted, did I really to add another? YES! This soup is outstanding. I used only 2 lbs. of squash, since that was what came in the package and substituted vegetable broth for the chicken. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!

This was my first time making this soup and I thought it was incredible! I followed the recipe with the exception of using vegetable stock instead of chicken stock and onions instead of leeks. I will make this often in the fall and winter, but in a reduced quantity! It's definitely restaurant quality and tastes like Thanksgiving in a bowl!

Rating: 4
Excellent, healthy soup sans butter...use olive oil. I have made this numerous times and it's always a success. The cider cream is easy to make and a must to take this soup to gourmet level. I use one apple instead of two as I think the apple can be overpowering, especially Granny Smith. A Gala, Fuji or Braeburn is better. Great for a special occasion and the leftovers are just as good.

Rating: 4
Yum. I didn't have cider or apple juice but I did have apple/raspberry juice. Took a chance & the results were great. Used it in the soup and, reduced as per recipe, for the sour cream topping. Put in a bit of curry, as another reviewer suggested. Added a couple cloves of garlic to soup and, also as mentioned by others, added salt and pepper. Used chicken stock.Had a single small apple of some unknown denomination. Prelude to main course last evening. I'm looking forward it for breakfast!

Made this one night and fell in love with it. My husband even enjoyed it and he really dislikes sour cream (I've put a quarter cup in mashed potatoes for 8 people and he complained about the taste of it!). But sitting down with a nice bowl of this soup and some bread to swish around all that delicious cider cream is just so cozy!

I made this for a potluck lunch at work (needed to impress the crowd as we are a bunch of foodies). It was a HIT and not a drop left! I doubled the recipe and to make it easy, just roasted the squash rather than peeling as recommended by others. I also made the toasted Gruyere croutons to serve with the soup which is a perfect addition. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Winter-Squash-Soup-with-Gruyere-Croutons-2997

Rating: 4
This recipe was very tasty. As the other reviewers suggested, I also roasted the squash first, but because of the comments about needing a flavor boost and so much salt, I gave the butternut a little bath in coconut oil before roasting. Definitely a great flavor boost! After sauteing the veggies, I added the cider and let it simmer down until almost evaporating before adding the broth (veggie broth). As others stated, the cider cream was delicious! Definitely a must have. I served it with some crispy Parmesan french bread that I made under the broiler. This was really delicious and I will certainly make it again.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fabulous! The cider cream just makes it exquisite. Everyone I served it to requested a copy of the recipe, and seconds! The only change I made was to only use 1 tsp of dried thyme (not 1 1/2). I might try vegetable stock next time, though or half chicken stock & half vegetable to bring out the squash flavor a little bit more. I'll update you if I do.

Thought this was boring. Needed salt. Two cups of leeks is a lot of leeks. Maybe roasting the veggies would help.

I absolutely love this soup. I have made it tons of times and am dreaming about it now. I never use celery because I don't like the taste and don't add a substitute. And I don't make it with the cider cream because that seems like a heavy next step. With these changes, it's still a delectable dish. Try this soup.

Rating: 3
i used precut squash and roasted it in the oven with salt and pepper so it would take less time to saute. i also had to use vegetable stock because i was making it for vegetarians. otherwise, i followed the recipe exactly. i thought it was very, very good - and the addition of the cider cream was absolutely essential. i gave this a 3 instead of a 4 simply because i had to use a surprisingly large amount of salt in order to get the savory-sweet flavor to balance. still very tasty though. our guests loved it.

I just tried this recipe for the first time and it came out DELICIOUS. I prepared a whole slew of things for a dinner party and this soup was definitely the winner. Do yourself a favor and make a double batch... freeze the leftovers, give it away, but share the gift of this soup with others.

Rating: 4
Cider cream IS awesome. I have made this many times and recommend the following shortcut: cut the squash in half, scrape out the seeds, and roast upside down at 400 just until you can poke a toothpick through the squash. Let it cool down and then you can pull the peel right off and drop the squash into the pan (kind of mash it with a big spoon as you go). This saves all the peeling and chopping, which not only takes forever but leaves that icky raw squash coating on your hands.

So i followed the recipe exactly and it came out bland with no after taste. Not sure if i did something wrong but I feel it needs to be sweeter. Next time i think i'll try sweeter apples

I have made this many times and it is always a big hit. I usually use vegetable broth because my son is a vegetarian and many times, leave out the cider cream. It is still wonderful.

I made this soup for a dinner party and it received RAVE reviews. I did not find the apple to be overpowering at all, though the soup was sweet not earthy. I wound up adding more salt at the end to cut against the sweetness. I thought the cider cream was really tasty and made for a nice presentation. I also fried sage leaves and layered those on top of a dollop of the cream in the middle of the soup - looked great. I would definitely make this again.

Ok, I made the soup but it was missing something for me. Tried adding a little salt and that helped. Then I remembered a recipe that a friend recommended that was a butternut squash soup with apples and curry. I thought, why not? I started by ladling some into a bowl and mixing in just a little curry powder. Wow! It put the soup over the top. It turned out that 1 tbsp added to the pot was just the right amount. Served to a group of 10... sprinkled chives on top, but no cider cream and got great reviews!

This was delicious! I didn't have leeks or celery on hand and the soup was still terrific, though I look forward to making this again exactly as the recipe calls for. I used heirloom apples with a higher sugar content (about 19 brix) than the apples suggested and the soup was definitely not overly sweet or apple-y. Next time I will add ginger and perhaps a bit of cayenne or red curry.

This is an autumn necessity at my house. Best squash soup I've ever had. I make it as written, and add pumpkernickel croutons.

This soup is delicious and has become a Thanksgiving tradition. We have never found it to have too much apple flavor. One note for a previous reviewer: It calls for apple cider, not cider vinegar. While a dab of the Cider Cream will do the trick, it really adds to the finished flavor and texture of the soup. I wouldn't leave it off.

it's ok. glad i followed reviews to not add cider, it's already quite appley as is(in a strange way). First spoonful was odd, did not like. after the next few spoonfuls I started to like it because of the taste of the leeks. I would not skip the cream as some reviewers did. Maybe I'd add a potato or something next time to add body.

This is a cool weather staple in my house. I have a teen vegetarian so I make it with Imagine no chicken broth, this tends to make it a bit sweeter so I only use half the cider. I have made the mistake of using apple juice - if you use it, only use about 1/2 cup otherwise it is way too sweet.

Rating: 4
I have made this soup quite a few times with a few alterations. First, make it a faster (but more expensive) process with pre-cut and peeled squash. If you don't use the pre-cut, remember that when you weigh a squash you are also weighing the parts you discard when peeled (this is why some people may have called it an "apple soup"). Second, I make it vegetarian style. Why kill a chicken, when veggie stock is just as tasty? Third, use the white and pale green parts of 3 leeks, not 2. Last, adding any type of cream to this soup cancels out the other flavors of the soup. And we're in a recession, less is more , eh? Instead, I roast a few pumpkin seeds as edible garnish to give to soup added nutrition and flavor.

Rating: 0
Okay, you have to try this soup! It is time consuming to make, but it's well worth it. I brushed the squash with olive oil and broiled it (per other comments) for half an hour. The skin was very difficult to peel, so perhaps 40 mins would have been better. I also used half/half instead of the heavy cream, which was perfect. It had just a touch of sweetness to it, but it was not overpowering. I didn't think the soup tasted like apples at all; through and through butternut according to my tastebuds. I would say to double the cider cream as one batch produces a small quantity.

Rating: 2
This soup really should not be called "Butternut squash" soup, but a more fitting name would be "Apple soup." The taste was strange, but did get better after a few days sitting; the apple flavor just took over the flavor of Butternut squash. If you are interested in a more classic Butternut squash soup this would not be it, however, if you like a sweet Apple soup, this might work for you. The 2 fork rating goes to the Apple cider cream which really was over the top great! I would not make this particular soup recipe again, but I absolutely will make this cream drizzle for a more classic soup.

This recipe is terrific and abundant. I made this on a cold Chicago Sunday as a first course for 3 friends, took some of the leftovers to work and froze the final quart. I served the remainder to my book club (8 attendees) in espresso cups with freshly made cider cream and dressed with Hawaiian Black Lava salt for both flavor and intrigue. It was a universal hit!! This soup freezes extremely well. I roasted the squash, used 4 cups of broth vs. 5 and 3 leeks as advised by other reviewers. Will definitely make this again!! Greek yogurt (fat free, Fage "Total 0%") works well to save a few calories in the Cider Cream,however, any plain yogurt will also work. I pland to have on-hand for the Christmas holidays as well.

I made this soup and definately would make it again...in fact the ingredients are in my fridge now. That was one thing I really liked; that most of the ingredients are staples in my kitchen. Just had to buy the produce. I did find it a little sweet so I added a pinch of cayenne to offset that. I also didn't make the cider cream because I made it just for myself. For company, I would definately make the cream too.

I made this the other night, used honey gold apples. Be sure to make the cider cream. I am still haunted by a butternut-apple soup from the now defunct Tanya's Soup Kitchen in Wichita KS.

I'm a college student who's still developing a palette and cooking skills...had a couple butternut squash lying around so I gave this a shot. Delicious. I cubed and roasted my squash with olive oil, salt, pepper at 400 degrees for about 30 mins. Used half and half instead of whipping cream. Also didn't have thyme or sage and instead used a bay leaf and a little herbs de provence. Finally, only had honeycrisp apples so I added a little cider vinegar for tartness. The cider sour cream is so good...my roommates were eating it with a spoon. I followed an earlier reviewer's advice and reduced an entire cup of apple cider to the 1/4 cup. I just wish my broke ass had some fresh crusty bread to accompany this awesome soup!

This is, by far, the best Butternut Squash Soup I've made or eaten. I brought this to a Gourmet Club dinner, and it was the hit of the night even with all the other dishes prepared by other cooks. One man, who hates squash, had two bowls and made me leave the leftovers for him. I made a few changes based on reviews. I added an extra cup of leeks, used a bit more squash and a bit less broth. I also cut the squash in half, rubbed with olive oil outside and in and roasted it at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes. The skins of the squash peeled right off. I used an immersion blender in the pot, which made it so easy. Also, I think you can skip the heavy cream or use skim instead if you want to lighten it up. The flavor of the soup without the cream was great, although I did add it for my dinner party. The KEY is the cider cream. Don't skip it. I doubled the cider and reduced to 1/4 cup, then drizzled the cider cream on the soup with a squirt bottle. It made me look like a true chef. I also added fresh thyme to the recipe since I had some on hand, in a ratio of 3 times the fresh amount to the dried amount. This is truly a 4 star yum. There is a sweetness to it, but not too much. I'm making a second batch to freeze. LOVE this soup.

Delicious! My favorite squash soup recipe from this website. The leeks, apples and herbs enliven this and keep it from tasting bland or heavy.

This recipe was fantastic and "souper" easy. Made this for a dinner party and it recieved rave reviews! I skipped the chives, used an immersion blender right in the pot, instead of blending in a blender. Also, I let this simmer for about 30 - 45 minutes after adding the whipping cream (guests were a little late) and I will actually add the long simmer to the recipe the next time I make it. The extra simmer really thickened it up. Lastly, I put a dollop of the cream in the center of the bowl and used a toothpick to make a "star". Pretty & delish...Do NOT skip the cider cream!

Since it's abundant at the farmer's market this time of year, I substituted celery root for celery, and roasted it with the squash and carrots, which worked out nicely. A really complex flavor, especially with the cider cream. Truly manages to be sweet and savory at the same time. To cut the fat, I reduced the sour cream to 1/2 cup of low-fat and used evaporated low-fat milk in place of the whipping cream. With a green salad and some nice crusty bread, a terrific winter supper.

I love this recipe. The only thing that I believe improves it further is using vegetable stock in lieu of chicken stock. It adds a slightly richer flavor.

I thought this was a perfect Fall soup! I followed the advice about buying pre-cut butternut squash @ Trader Joe's (I loathe cutting the monstrous thing!) which made it super easy. I thought it was weird the recipe didn't include salt and pepper with the sauteed vegetables. I ended up having to sprinkle some at the end and it turned out much tastier. I used my immersion blender which made the pureeing process a lot quicker. The cider cream drizzled right on top made for a stunning presentation! Next time I'll probably add fresh thyme & sage instead of dried and puree the soup less so it's got more texture. Overall, great soup to curl up to on a Fall evening!

This was really good. I served it with a simple green salad and my guests loved it. I used pre-cut cubed butternut squash, which made the process a snap. By the time the soup was ready everyone was starving and I hand't made the cider cream, so I just skipped it. Also, I used half & half instead of heavy cream; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I think next time I might omit adding cider to the soup because I thought the flavor was just a little TOO sweet. But I'll be making this again for sure -- and next time, I won't forget the cider cream.

This was SO good. I made it as the first course for early Christmas and it was light and flavorful. Bagged cubed butternut squash is available at most markets though, aside from wonderful Trader Joe's, it's absurdly expensive. Don't leave out the cider cream! Yum.

Oh, plus, I roasted the butternut squash, more depth to the flavor. And, I agree, pureeing with an immersion blender was easier.

Rating: 3
YUM! Needed a bit of salt to bring out the flavors, but fabulous recipe. Wasn't really sure if the cider cream was worth the calories, since the soup had enough flavor on it's own. Plus, I made this veg friendly using water instead of chicken stock (didn't have any veg stock on hand) and it came out great, just added a bit more cider to the soup to punch up the taste.

This recipe is really spectacular and really quite easy. We made it for Thanksgiving last year and this year and now it has become a staple in our household for the cold fall/winter nights. It tastes best if you error on the side of more squash and less chicken broth - it makes for a thicker soup. Also - it's easiest to puree it with a hand blender right in the pot rather than working in batches and using a standard blender.

This soup was a hit at our Christmas dinner last year. The cider cream makes it! Everyone loved it and had seconds. If you like the sweet taste and would prefer a chunkier soup, I suggest the Butternut Squash Chowder with Pears & Ginger. Mmmmm! Love butternut squash!

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving feast. It is much, much easier to split the squash in half, rub the cut side with olive oil, salt and pepper and roast cut side down until soft. The skin will pull right off and the soft squash can then be added right to the soup pot. Much better than peeling and cutting raw squash and the roasted flavor adds depth.

Except for not realizing how difficult cutting squash could be, I was able to make this dish exactly as instructed, and it was DELICIOUS! I've tried many canned soups searching for a good butternut squash soup, but I think I'll just have to stick to making this recipe from now on. Absolutely fantastic! I'm a slow chopper, but I was able to make this soup from scratch after work yet still in time for dinner!

This soup was good, better on day two, though next time I'll try another recipe. It might have been tastier if I'd roasted the squash as another reviewer suggested. Finally, alhough I made the cider cream, I didn't really think it added much.

Before I had learned about Epicurious, this soup had become a Thanksgiving tradition. I lost the recipe for a few years and tried to improvise. Although it was still good, I was overjoyed to find the recipe on Epiurious. This soup is smooth, complex and delicious. I double the cider, and reduce to 1/4 cup before I mix it into the cream as I feel the cider is overpowered. What a treat! My family members can't wait until Thanksgiving!

Delicious - a complex and lovely flavor. I used fresh sage & lemon thyme from the garden - the usual equivalent of 3 times the dried amount. I roasted the squash first, so it would be easy to peel and cut up (Cut in quarters, roasted face down in a pan at 300F for 1 hour, peeled, cut in 1/2" chunks). Then, I added it to the sauteed leeks, carrots, celery and continued the recipe. Used a fresh cider, needed more than was called for of the reduced cider to give the cider cream the proper punch. Will ABSOLUTELY make again - next time for my winter soup party.

Wonderful soup! I will definitely be making this again. I couldn't bring myself to add the cream -- I used fat free half & half and it was great. I also used lowfat sour cream. I can't imagine it could have been any better with the extra fat. Next time I'm going to try roasting the squash and carrots first just to see (I can never make exactly the same recipe twice -- you only live once!)

This will now be my go-to butternut squash recipe! It is delicous- rich and thick with great flavors. The cider cream was a bit bland, not sure if I did not let the cider reduce as much as it should have or what... but still a nice addition. Can't wait to make it again!

Rating: 4
Restaurant quality soup! Warm and hearty on a cold day. I misread the directions and put 1 1/2 cups cider into the soup rather than 1 cup, then compensated by adding an additional cup of broth. It was still delicious and thick, but I am looking forward to making it again and following the exact directions. I also didn't have chives, so I substituted green onions on top. Still good, but will try chives next time. I think they would be a bit more mild, which would better compliment the soup. Easy to prepare and will definitely be making again.

I made this soup twice in the last month - first as a pre-Thansksgiving trial and then again for the big day. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and would not change a thing. Don't skip adding the cream or the making the cider cream. I received many compliments on this dish and was told it rivals the bisques served at fine restaurants. One tip - I used a hand blender to mix the soup in the pot rather than transfering to a blender. This worked well.

Rating: 4
Amazing! I have got to be the worlds WORST chef, and yet not even I could mess this soup up! It is yummy with and without the cream -- I could hardly tell the difference without -- make with a splash of whole milk too. The second time I made it, I forgot the cider, so I substituted a bit of applesauce with water to equal the amount of cider and threw in some extra spices -- cinnamon and nutmeg. Top with toasted pecans for an extra treat. This is now one of my all time favorite foods. I LOOOOVE this soup. A friend said this soup was so good she dreamed about it that night!

This was an enormous success at our Thanksgiving dinner for 12. I made a 1-1/4 batch and added the spices and some maple syrup as suggested by others. Made this on Tuesday, and kept chilled with the cider cream separate, until reheating for our appetizer course. Served in white oval bowls with the cider cream drizzled across the top, it was an impressive visual equal to the palate pleasing blend of flavors. As for the 3 fork rating, I just think the "dish beyond compare" description reserved for four forks is in need of editing. How many dishes, really, can be "beyond compare?"

Made for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I had to make it Vegan style for a vegan so there was no cream or cider cream and everyone still loved it. Added more spices as everyone suggested. Whole foods only had one leek left so I used that and green onion. Accidently forgot the carrots and it was still great! The vegan had seconds and so did someone else. Highly recommend. I made it in my pressure cooker in 6 minutes!

I really LOVE making this soup, but am noticing in the recipe that it does not call for salt. It most definitely needs it to bring out the terrific squash flavor. Add the salt to taste after you have pureed. As in the previous review you may wish to add more thyme and sage as well - I think the specks of spices look attractive in the soup so it doesn't bother me at all. The cider cream is also wonderful.

Rating: 4
I reviewed this recipe a couple of years ago and I just have to do it again. I have made this soup for many ocassions including winter weddings. I made it last week for 100 guests and once again received rave reviews from everyone. I served it as part of a soup trio with chicken noodle (with homemade noodles) and new england clam chowder. I thought all the soups were great, but the squash took the top spot. Please try this for your next special get together. In my humble opinion, this soup needs more of all the spices to really bring out the flavors, so just keep playing with it until it tastes just right.

This is wierd, but I (who hate squash) loved this soup, while my wife (who loves squash) just thought it was ok. Very simple to prepare, and really tasty.

This really is wonderful. I wouldn't change anything. I, too, made it ahead and reheated it and it was super. To the cook from Washington, NC, there is NO vinegar in this recipe.

I've been searching for years for a butternut soup recipe that's as good as the butternut soup they make at Whole Foods. This is the recipe!! I only use about half the butter, a little less sage and thyme, and with the creaminess of the butternut, I leave out the cream completely and it tastes amazing!!!!

I made this for a holiday open house party. It was a big hit. I felt that the thyme was too strong but all of my guests liked it. I added a 1/4 t of nutmeg, 1/8 t cayenne, and one half of a large onion. I omitted the apple juice entirely and I used a bit more squash than the recipe calls for. To adapt this for the crock pot, which is the perfect way to serve this soup and keep it warm for a cocktail party, I pre-baked the squash. Meanwhile, I sauted all the other vegetables and the spices. I then combined the cooked squash, and the vegetables, and the broth in the crock pot and cooked for 5 hrs on high. I pureed it with my "boat motor", adding the cream.

This is a great recipe. I made with ingredients I had on hand. No apple cider, but I had apple cider vinegar, so I just added a tablespoon to the soup at the end of cooking. Also, didn't have sour cream, but did have mascarpone cheese, so I made the cream with mascarpone, cider vinegar and a bit of maple syrup. Decadent, but so worth the fat. Also added a bit of cayenne pepper to the soup and roasted the squash. Delicious!

I just ate a bowl of this soup for lunch after making it for dinner last night. It is just fantastic. I cut down on the fat because I am a bit of a nut, but my fiance, who considers fat to be the most important food group of all, couldn't tell the difference. I used nonfat half-and-half in place of the cream. I used lite sour cream, but I didn't add any reduced cider because we like things to be more savory than sweet. It was a tremendous hit. My fiance actually detests mixing sweet and savory, but this dish had such a perfect combo (without the cider in the cream) that he loved it. I will definitely make it for Thanksgiving!

This was by far the best squash soup recipe!! It was easy and absolutely outstanding. I made it last year for Thanksgiving and it was the hit of the meal. This year everybody is telling me that I must make it again!

This soup is amazing! I've made it several times for friends, and it always seems to be a hit. I sometimes substitute creme fraiche for the sour creme...works great!

We served this soup to our friends last night and everyone raved about it. We chose to peel, cube and roast the squash first for a richer flavor. Also, we made a sour cream/curry paste mixture instead of the sour cream/cider mixture...just for an additional kick.

My sister made this soup for me and I loved it! She did not include the sour cream, but it was not missed. A comforting soup for a cool Fall evening!

What a wonderful soup. I don't understand the negative reviews. I have made this soup numerous times all with great success and raves from everyone who has tried it. I strongly agree in roasting the squash beforehand and add during the puree process (not before or you will cook all the flavor out of the squash). I also substituted creme fraiche in place of sour cream. I also added 1/2 granny smith apple, scant 1/2 teaspoon honey to the cider to infuse more flavor (let sit 10 minutes). Don't add too much cider cream to the soup!!! Also, the soup does not need the addtion of cream it's texture is perfect without it.

Adfter reading the positive reviews, I decided to include this soup for a company dinner last evening. What a mistake! I heartily agree with the cook from Oregon - so did my husband. What a waste of a lovely squash. I should have stuck with the Japanese Cauliflower Soup which I have made to rave reviews numerous times.

My cousin made this dish for Christmas dinner this year. I was a little skeptical about it, I'm not a big fan of squash. I figured I would at least try it. I loved it! So did my Mom, she wants me to make the dish tomorrow, for New Year's day! It looks easy, my cousin said it was very easy to make and there will be plenty for leftovers for lunch!

What a wonderful recipe!! I, too, decided to roast the squash in the oven, then add it to the tender vegetables. It worked great! Also, I added a splash of fresh lemon juice after The soup was pureed.

The flavors were non-existent. Everyone thought it was too sweet and had no depth. No one at my dinner table thought it was great though no one thought it was awful either, though based on everyone else's reviews, we are in the minority. The leftovers went down the garbage disposal. Would not make again for all the squash in the world!

I made a totally traditional Thanksgiving meal except for this soup~it was marvelous. Made it the day before and chilled it. Added a bit of ginger and a dash of curry to the soup while making it and topped it off with some crumbled fried sage leaves. I got rave reviews for days afterwards on how good it was. I am rationing out the leftovers!!

I was looking for a recipe because my grocery had squash on sale, 4-lbs. for a dollar! Lucky me, I found one more recipe for my "Delicious Dishes" file! My modifications: I roasted halved and seeded squash first in a 350-degree oven until tender (45 min.) and added the cooled, scooped out, cooked squash to the other veggies after they were tender. Believe it or not, I skipped the cream and added some milk instead. Gotta watch that waist line! Next time, I will add less sour cream to the cider reduction to intensify the apple flavor, but that's just a tweek to an excellent recipe. Do yourself a favor and try this one.

We loved this soup!! Great autumn or Thanksgiving soup. It does take some time though and peeling the squash is definitely painful!

My family loved this soup. I gave some to my 6 month old, and he loved it. I don't think I put enough butternut squash because the apple flavor was a little strong. I'm going to make this soup for Thanksgiving.

My husband enjoyed this soup, but I will probably make it without the carrots and celery next time to highlight the squash and apple flavor, and substitute yellow onion and shallot for the leek. The cider cream is phenomenal! I added a little allspice to it. Great.

Rating: 4
wow! i make this soup year, after year, after year...always a huge hit. i substitute vegetable broth for the chicken stock so my veggie friends can enjoy it too...i usually dread making this soup and make it a day ahead because of the annoying peeling process--pre-peeled or baking in the oven sounds wonderful! i think i will continue to make it a day ahead because i agree with others' comments about the flavors and i will probably double it, since i am sick of never having any leftover to enjoy for myself the next day...

The soup was wonderful -- a great first course for an autumn meal. I purchased peeled butternut squash (it's more expensive but worth it if you've ever peeled squash).

This soup was the hit of our dinner party. The flavor was full and hearty. I took another person's idea and baked the squash in the oven first, adding it with the apples and spices. The cider cream was a nice complement to the soup. I'll definitely keep it in my file to make again.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. I made it as a first course for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. Peeling the butternut squash was no fun, however... next time I might try modifying the preparation a bit and roast the squash first so that the pulp can simply be scooped out... I never want to peel another squash again in my life.

I made this recipe as an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit! The different ingredients compliment each other well and it was very easy to make. My family decided that this should be a permenant addition to our Thanksgiving meal.

This soup has become a Thanksgiving standard in our family - 3 years and running! It's a great cold rainy or winter day soup as well. The cider cream is the best part - we love drizzling it over each individual bowl in pretty patterns, making the soup stunning to the eye as well as the palate.

This was the best soup I've ever made (and I make quite a bit). I've tried different butternut squash soup recipes and this one had a great flavor (and just the right amount of sweetness from the apple juice). The cider cream was nice, but not a necessary addition. For example, I didn't use if for the leftovers. Served it with warm, homemade bread & a salad. Perfect!

This is my favorite soup, I first made it in 1998 and since then friends beg me to make it for them. It is good with or without the cider cream and apple juice can be substituted for the cider. Also I found that this soup freezes well in individual containers for the best lunch in the office.

Have always made butternut squash of some variety for the holidays. This soup contained all my favorite ingredients and so I thought let's try this. There were nothing but raves for this soup, the nuanced flavors of the apple, thyme and sage, the smoothness of the soup, very hearty and filling: everyone claimed they would have been content with just the soup for Thanksgiving. The next day it was wiped out as post Thanksgiving lunch.

I made this for Thanksgiving 1999 and still receiving unsolicited raves about this soup. I will be making it for Christmas dinner this year (2000).

Made this for Thanksgiving...I loved this soup, but my guests were of mixed opinion. I sampled a bowl before and after adding the whipping cream and decided I would omit the cream next time, as it seemed to cloak the lovely flavor. Would definitely make again, but only for people who enjoy butternut squash!

The recipe says it serves 10, but those are very small portions. You can use vegetable broth with good results as well.

I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday, and it was unanimously enjoyed by all. I'm typically not a big fan of winter squash, but I found the sweet and savory combination in this soup to be just about right. I added an additional chopped onion along with the leeks and added a dash of allspice to the cider cream. A great do ahead soup and it a beautiful addition to an autumn table. I'll definitely make it again.

I just made this for Thanksgiving. It was so good. Great to make ahead and just heat up. Everyone enjoyed. I will definitely be doing it again.

I made this soup for Thanksgiving dinner and it received rave reviews. I would recommend that you make the soup the day before you plan to serve it, so that it develops more intense flavor and a slightly thicker texture. The apples & cider lend complexity and the cider cream adds a beautiful garnish.

I've made this soup twice and love it! I made it "lighter" by making a few substitutions: 1-2 tbs. of low fat butter, 3 cans of fat free chicken broth, low fat sour cream and fat free 1/2 and 1/2 (in place of the whipping cream). It came out delicious and I was asked to make it again!

This is a wonderful soup, and it even tastes better the second day as the flavors mellow somewhat. The "make ahead factor" makes this soup perfect as a first course for a dinner party.

Made it for a dinner party - was a big success. I added a hint of cinnamon to the cider cream. I also had to use frozen pureed butternut squash rather than fresh squash ... I added a bit less cream to the soup since the frozen squash has some margarine and liquid in it. It worked out really well!

My partner and I have have made this recipe on numerous occasions. It is one of the best soup recipes that we've tried. Even our perpetually picky five-year old likes it, and, in fact, often requests it. We've also tried this recipe using pear cider and it was equally good.

Served this as the first course of a New Years dinner party. It was quite fine, but I have had better butternut squash soups. Used the cider cream to drizzle each person's initials onto their soup--that got their attention!

This is an award winner!!!!! I served this soup as one of the 5 courses in my New Year's Eve dinner! It was a hit with all of my guests...every single one asked for the recipe. Make it easy on yourself and microwave the squash for 10-15 mins before peeling and cubing! I wrote 2000! with the cream into the soup before serving to my guests....they were all impressed!

Great soup with a complex flavor. I added a bit of garlic, a splash of sherry and a touch of cinnamon to this recipe. Put the sour cream in a plastic bag and snip the corner - then you can use your artistic talents to drizzle the sour cream in squiggles or other patterns over the soup.

We had this soup the other night at our friends Katie and Carols house it was so good that the pot was empty and everyone wanted seconds.. So here I am on line getting the recipe so that I can make it at home for Keat and I to have and NOT SHARE IT! YUMMMMMMMM

We had a soup tasting lunch the day after Thanksgiving for 40 family members. All three soups were rated excellent by adults and kids alike. This rated a close 2nd after the Winter Squash Soup with Gruyere Croutons (Bon Apptit Dec 96) but ahead of the Spicy Pumpkin Soup with Mexican Cream (Bon Apptit Nov 97). The cider cream makes the dish.
