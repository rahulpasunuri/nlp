First off, I would like to warn everyone of the time needed to make this. For me it took a whole afternoon/evening, just to make the sauce (I finished the meal the next day). The straining part was what took the most time, I would recommend using a sifter. Secondly, I do not recommend tasting it during the entire process, unless you like the taste of dried peppers. I kept tasting it looking for something to show for the hours I was spending and, to me, it tasted awful. But then I finished, took it off the heat and let it sit over night and ate it. I almost cried with relief. Despite all of this grief, it was incredibly delicious, I made it with Pork instead of turkey (and used 4 cups of chicken broth and some chicken stock I made instead of turkey). It makes cups and cups of mole sauce so we only used a bit and then vacuum sealed and froze the rest (which I have just tossed the frozen sauce in the pot with some warm water and cooked meat)and it was still delicious.

I've had this recipe in my box for months... finally found the time to make it today while watching the NFL playoffs. WOW.... It is truly incredible. From the moment I finished the initial step with the chilis, I knew this was going to be good. There are some unusal steps... but just have faith and patience... you will be rewarded. I can't wait to see how this will taste in a few days as leftovers based on the other reviews!

I have to defend this recipe. I think the secret to getting this right is to making it a day or two in advance. I served it to mi amigo from Puebla on Thanksgiving day and he said it was good. On day 3 we took it out of the fridge and heated up the left overs and it was so much better. I bought all my ingredients at a Mexican market.

Making mole is such a deep culinary experience, that after all the energy to prepare you want it perfect. I made this recipw and thought it had WAY too much sugar...but I did it anyway. As well as ordered the book from whence it came. Three days later when the book arrived-the recipe DID not have the 1/2 cup of sugar! Everything else was identical. So...I will only add 1 tablespoon of the Mexican sugar next time, if that. Epicurious is my main source of recipes (amd the magazines where they are first published, but I do not know what happened to this one.

I had never had mole before - but love most Mexican food. So based on the rave reviews here, I thought I would give this recipe a try for my gourmet group. HOWEVER, from the first step of frying & then boiling the chilies (which filled my house with such a VILE smell that it drove my family away) - to the last steps (fry a piece of french bread & then throw it in the blender???) . . . I was perplexed by the bizarre set of ingredients & steps to make this sauce. This may be "authentic" mole - but I would love to know what sadistic type of person first came up with this odd mixture of ingredients & complex steps? I agree with one previous reviewer who suggested NOT to taste this sauce until the very end. I kept on hoping that each successive set of ingredients would make the awful sauce taste better . . . but unfortunately it did not. I have to say the final product was OK (declared "edible" by my family, and "good" by my gourmet group), I would definitely NOT declare it good enough to make again. And I won't need to, because I ended up with gallons of the stuff - which oddly enough I couldn't get anyone from the group to take some home with them! I would suggest only making this sauce if you KNOW that you love mole sauce. Otherwise, it is probably not worth the effort.

Like most of the other reviewers, I would absolutely make this recipe again. It is truly the best mole I have ever eaten. Here are a couple of other tips though: there two sections of the recipe which ask you to strain the contents from the blender through a metal strainer into the pot. I would highly recommend straining the contents into a bowl first to save your arms (unless you are super strong, which I'm not). Also, make sure you do use gloves to clean the chilies because even though they are dry, they still have the capacity to sting the eyes (or in my case, the nose). Lastly, like the others, I ended up with alot of sauce left over which I froze and will plan on using the next time I have extra roast chicken or turkey. I will plan on making this though at least once a year.

As each process takes 20-30 minutes, it helps to get several steps going at once to lessen the overall time spent on this dish. While the recipe does still take 3-4 hours, the result is truly scrumptious. I served this with grilled corn-on-the-cob topped with chipotle sour cream and red Mexican rice. Also, there is quite a bit more mole in the end than necessary for the amount of turkey, so I popped some in the freezer for a future treat.

stunningly delicious. i took this mole to a church function (a HISPANIC CHURCH FUNCTION) and 3 women approached me after to get the recipe. as a single white male...this was a bit presumptuous of me to bring hispanic food, but the results were definately worth the time. if you have a free day to cook, MAKE THIS!!!!

Prior to making this recipe I had never tried making nor even tasting mole. Another reviewer described it as a spiritual experience. All I can say is "Boy, it's hard work." I started at 5pm and ended at 1am. However, based on the reviews received, everybody loved it, so that made it worth all the effort. I served it with the Kemp's Black Beans & Summer Rice Salad w/ Goat Cheese Dressing from this site. Modifications made were slight, chiefly I boiled a whole turkey and then shredded it. I also added boiled chicken to it to increase the meat to sauce ratio. One word of warning, I brought the leftovers in to work while they all enjoyed it, EVERYBODY had an opinion, comparing it to their own family recipe. With so many ingredients and such complexity of flavor, you will be hard pressed to please everybody's palate.

I live in Guadalajara, Mexico. When I make this mole for my Mexican friends, they rave about it. It always takes about 4 hours to make, but it is a spiritual experience going through the whole process.

Although, I kept telling my friends to savor and really enjoy this mole because I'll will never agonize through this preparation again. I keep reminding myself that this is the BEST mole I've tasted by far. It made my Cinco de Mayo dinner party a huge hit, the turkey was so moist and the mole sublime. 4 days after my party and I still have friends emailing me they're dreaming of my mmmmmmmmmole. In short I have this distinct feeling I will be making this mole again. The up-side; the receipe made enough to freeze half for later use, when I'll be able to enjoy it once again without all that labor involved.

Four Students from my sons high school Spanish class made this last night. It was the best mole I have tasted! We bought everything from a store with several bins. We brought measuring cups and spoons and measured everything in the store! This saved so much time! We organized everything in groups so each student prepared a part of the recipe. Not only did the kids make a very authentic dish, they also learned many cooking techniques.I was lucky to take a cooking class from Diana Kennedy, she told a story about serving Mole in her restaurant. One of her customers told her that they had never tried Mole and wanted to know if she baked or fried it and where can you find fresh Mole or did she catch her own!

This dish tooke me approximately 4 hours to construct (not including shopping time, and many of these items could only be found at Whole Foods which is not close to me). I have to agree with the other posters.. this is definitely worth the effort. I have never found ANY Mole recipe that tastes as authentic as this one. Also, the recipe is easily twice what you need for a turkey breast and would well with many other recipes, including the ancho-quajillo enchilda recipe on this site. I would definitely make this again, and probably double the sauce since it's the same amount of work, and freeze it to use in all of my Mexican meals. It really is THAT good.

Yes, I would make this again and it was absolutely delicious, but I would leave out a few steps. I did not cook the chilies in the fat before simmering them in the liquid since the recipe called for dried chilies - there didn't seem much point in that step. I also would probably leave out the last step with the thickeners. I used Mexican chocolate, which already is quite sweet so I think I would cut the brown sugar down to 1/3 or 1/4 cup. The whole part with the chilies is the most time-consuming and I have trouble working with even dried chilies - sometimes even hard to breathe - wish there was a simpler way but I do think it was one of the reasons it was so fantastic. I used a metal strainer to sieve the chiles and pressed them through with a spoon which was VERY slow, but made for a nice smooth texture. The second time it called for using the sieve, I used a Foley food mill, which was quicker but ended up with more seeds. Is there a better solution? Lastly, I cooked 5 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs instead of the turkey just because of my own preference. I shredded it and added it to the sauce before reheating. It was the right amount and was easy to serve.

Oh MAN is this good. Completely worth the effort. However, do not even attempt this if you are in a hurry. This is a slow, though not very complex, process that produces an amazing mole!

One thing to add about the actual turkey. While I purchased a bone in full breast, next time I would purchase either turkey pieces, light and dark, or a whole small turkey. Why spend the money on the turkey breast only?

This will become a family favorite now. This dish is not as hard as it seems. I made it after work one night, but you do have to dedicate your evening. Do the shopping one night and the preparing the next. This was a wonderful experience and delicious as well. I followed the recipe exactly, except instead of all Mexican chocolate, I used some bittersweet chocholate as I had it around. Also, I did not cook the 1/2 cup oil into the chili puree, but next time I will. I think it will make the sauce more velvety.

This is the best mole I have ever tasted, and it is worth the time and effort to make it - especially because it makes a very large quantity which you can continue to enjoy if you freeze half of it. I did not make this all in one day, but split it up into three days, which made it easier. Day One: I bought all the ingredients, and prepped them. First I made the turkey broth by combining 2 boxes of all natural free range chicken broth with the onions and garlic and added water to equal 13 cups. While it was cooking, I prepped the chiles and put them in an air-tight container. I measure out all the nuts and put them in another air-tight container. For the fruits, I prepped the tomatoes and tomatillos, and combined them in an air-tight container with the raisins and put it in the refrigerator. For the flavorings, I cut up the onions and peeled the garlic cloves and put them in a separate air-tight container in the refrigerator. For the spices, I combined them all together, and without heating them, I ground them up together and put them in a bowl. For the thickeners, I even measured out the dark brown sugar, got the bread/tortillas out, and measured out the chocolate. Day Two: I completed the steps for the chilis and nuts and refrigerated it over night. Also, I did not pass the chili mixture through a sieve, which added a good texture in the end! Day Three: While the fruits were simmering, I heated the onion and garlic and completed that process and added it to the mole. At the exact time I finished that, the fruits were done, so I blended them and added them after. Then I added the spices and thickeners at the end. In all, it took about 1.5 hours on day one and day two. It took about 2 hours on day three. When we tasted it, we were absolutely thrilled with everything, especially the complexity of the flavor, which continues to blossom and express itself on your palate for a full minute after the first taste. This recipe will not disappoint you!

This is fantastic! But you MUST be a mole fan and have LOTS of time, becase it does take all day to make. Earthy and complex, well worth it if you're a mole fan. Really, very excellent!

This is fantastic! Definitely worth the huge amount of time. My only suggestion is DON'T taste the sauce until everything is in the pot! Until you get all the ingredients together, it's actually pretty bad. Had a hard time finding all the chilies, but luckily there are several Hispanic markets fairly close. Definitely use Mexican chocolate; the wonderful flavors of cinnamon/nuttiness make all the difference in the world.

We love mole and we've eaten it at several restaurants and venues and tried many recipes ourselves. The process of making it is one fun way to spend a day! So, it wasn't the work involved in this recipe that makes me say I wouldn't make it again, as it is no more work than other mole recipes. It was that we thought the mole itself was good but not as good as some others we've made, such as those by Rick Bayless in his "Mexico One Plate at a Time" cookbook. So, good recipe, we're glad we tried it. We'd recommend it to others to try it, but it didn't end up in the "keep file" at our hosue.

This recipe is, in a word, perfection. I have had several authentic moles in slow food restaurants and this ranks with the best of them on our first attempt. Yes, it takes about six hours start to finish, yes the techniques require you to pay close attention and yes, the mess is daunting . . . but, yes, yes, yes, it is worth it all. My husband and I preapred this dish together and having a second pair of hands is very helpful. Pick a lazy day, make this mole, invite friends over the next night for dinner and you will be hailed a great chef. FYI, great drink accompianments are the jamaica margaritas from Bon Appetit, or the fresh lemon/lime margaritas from Cooks Illustrated.com.

Fabulous and as authentic as they come. I said that I'd make this again, but only if I have the help of 2 or 3 other cooks. Very labor-intensive, time-consuming, and as others have said, well worth it if you have the time.

Wow. The mole is amazing. I haven't gotten to the turkey part, but it is wonderful so far. I made a half batch (restricted by amount of peppers and stock on hand) and decided to simplify my life a bit and roasted my ingredients in three batches in a cast iron skilett (1. poblanos/green peppers, 2. peanuts (1 1/4 c) and pepitas (1/2 c) 3. quartered onions and garlic) As you can see, I left out some ingredients. Dumped the roasted ingredients in a crock pot with the 2c stock on high for 4 hours since everything will be cooked down and blended together anyway. Used a stick blender to blend. Allowed to simmer on low for a while longer and added cinnamon, allspice, cumin, 1 teas molasses, and a couple handfuls of choc chips. it turned out amazing. Even this bastardized version is wonderful. I'm sure the original is even better. If you're scared of the time committment, roast everything at night and then put it in a crockpot on low while you're at work. It will smell amazing when you walk through the door and then all you have to do is blend it and add the chocolate and spices. It was then thick enough. Didn't bother with the bread. Well worth it.

Add 1 Food processor, 1 immersion blender, 1 burr grinder - whammo! Made a double batch of this magic sauce - what a delightful way to share with friends and celebrate the holidays.

Yup, this mole is the real deal. It is time consuming, messy, and well worth the effort.

I'm mexican and it's the first time ever to find a REAL mole recipe, most of the times people called it chocolate sauce and it's not just that, the brown color comes from the chiles and the chocolate is used to thicken the sauce and reduce the hot in it. Is it too hot for you? I'll give you one suggestion, pour over some sugar (not too much), it's a little bit sweet, but gives you some rest.

Can some more people who have lots of time make this more often. I will as soon as I can find the time and this recipe is inspiring. I've made mole concoctions but this seems like the real thing. Next time I am on the verge of a depression I will go for this. In Toronto the chillies can be purchased in the hispanic food shops at Kensington Market which are chockful with these ingredients.

This is the longest, most difficult recipe I have ever made. I started it 3 days in advance, but it took me all of that time to make the mole! I think it will go more quickly the next time. The turkey breast does not cook in 35 minutes, more like an hour or more. The mole sauce is way way more than can be used at this one meal, so be prepared to freeze, which it seems to do quite well. Other than those details, it was absolutely delicious and worth every messy hour of preparation.

I haven't made it yet but am absolutely delighted to find a recipe for mole. I love mole and have been buying it ready mead in a jar. I am eager to try this receipe.
