This was tasty, and quick. Did everything per the recipe. Don't change a thing.

I'm not sure if the other reviews are for the same dish that I made, but what I ended up with was awful. The rosemary did nothing for the yams. It was a good thing I had back-up frozen vegetables

Great flavor and much better than a sweet dish with lost of sugar. I found the cook times a bit short but maybe I would make the slices a bit thinner next time.

This was a delicious dish! I have made it several times and we love it. I have added also some fresh ginger. I don't think whipping cream is necessary--coffee cream and a ittle sour cream are fine. The rosemary gives the yams an unusual and exotic fragrance and taste. I will make it for my gourmet grup next month.

This recipe was very good. I followed other poster's advice and added 1 tsp of Cayenne pepper as I was serving this with the pork loin with apples and prunes found on this site and did not want a sweet side dish. The mix was amazing and definitely tempered the richness and sweetness well. I will make this again!

this was so easy and tasted great. we added a little cayenne and that balanced out the sweet and the spicy just right. it's a keeper.

The flavors of this recipe didn't seem properly balanced. I didn't like the savory shallots with the sweet yams.

This was the best yam recipe I've ever tried. So delicious. I didn't have nutmeg on hand so used a bit of ginger and cinnamon and it worked great!

Super recipe for someone who never liked the sticky sweet yams of yore! Doubled the recipe for a large crowd, and nearly messed it up in a pot that was too small. Nonetheless it was a hit and I've made this every Thanksgiving since then.

oddly bland & heavy. Although I am not a spicy food person & do like "less-sweet" sweet potato/yam dishes, this was so odd & uncomplimentary to the nature of the yams that neither hubby nor I had more than a few bites.

This dish was a real litmus test at my house. Personally, I loved it and give it four stars, then again, I hate "candied" yam recipes. A couple of my guests thought that this recipe was only so-so. While trying this dish, they discovered that they really don't like sweet potatoes per se...they really like the "candied"-type sweetened recipes.

YUM! The perfect complement to naturally sweet yams. I tried it again after Thanksgiving, and you know what was EVEN MORE delicious? I partially micro-steamed the yams (for speed), then ROASTED (450? or was it the broiler?) them in (yes, in) the cream sauce. Talk about tasting like dessert! The yam juices and cream almost tasted like caramel, and it had that attractive roasted appearance. However, for this second attempt, I did not have the rosemary in it. I'm not sure what the rosemary would end up like at a high temp. I'd give this variation five forks!

Excellent! The yams are still sweet but paired with the rosemary and rich cream you don't feel like you're eating dessert with dinner. My guest loved this dish and I'll be making it again for Christmas dinner.

I was nervous about replacing the sweet yam/pecan/cream dish I have always made for Thanksgiving, but this was much, much better! EVERYONE loved it and they are still talking about it. The combo of the yams w/ the rosemary was awesome and unexpected and it was still sweet because of the yams. It's also VERY easy to make. This is it for T-Day from now on.

My family was very pleased with this dish. We agree, it is a nice change from brown sugar/maple syrup recipes for yams. I sprinkled chopped scallion on the top.

We served this recipe again this year at our family Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone likes it! It is so easy to fix and not just for Thanksgiving. Use it often.

Finally a yam recipe without sugar!! Thank you, Thank You, Thank You!!Try this with fat-free half and half for a healthier dish!

I made this for Christmas two years ago and have made it seven times since, to rave reviews . Everyone asks for the recipe. In order to keep the fat content low, I only use two tablespoons of cream and the results are quite good. This dish is now a tradition in our household

The whole family agreed that this was our favorite dish on the table this Thanksgiving. Having never really found the marshmellow/yam dish served so often I personally found a new adoration for this orange toned root withen this dish! Splendid mix of flavors with the shallots, nutmeg and rosemary - I would like to investigate modifing this recipie into a winters soup - maybe just more cream?

Yum! Great flavor and very easy to make. I added a little more fresh rosemary.

Made the yams for Thanksgiving and we had 11 children at the table. Most tried it and a few even liked it! The adults enjoyed the roesemary flavor of the dish. Definately don't overcook the yams. Only cook until tender.

I just made this for Thanksgiving. I was disappointed with the appearanace so I mashed the yams. It tasted good - but I am going to try other recipes before I come back to this.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving 1998 and loved it! I don't like those sweet potato recipes with marshmallows so I was looking for something different. I am making it again Thanksgiving 2000. TRY IT!

Only use fresh rosemary.
