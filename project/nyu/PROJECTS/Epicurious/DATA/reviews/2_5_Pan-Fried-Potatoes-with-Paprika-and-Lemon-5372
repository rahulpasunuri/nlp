It was alright, but I found it rather bland, not a keeper. Very blah.

This recipe is nothing special-won't bother to save this one to my recipe box.

My husband loved this recipe. It is great because you don't have to pre-boil the potatoes.

I added fresh rosemary and quite a bit of kosher salt and pepper. I would definitely make it again.

Made as a side dish with Schnitzel and it was a great addition. I liked a bit more lemon and did it in a lg. frying pan, rather than the pot that was suggested. Very good... KIMBER

Easy to make, the lemon adds a nice flavour to the potatoes. Good sidedish!

This is a wonderful recipe. The lemon added at the end adds a wonderful freshness. I have used Spanish paprika which is a little spicer with good results and another time adding some leftover red bell pepper (with regular paprika).

I have made this recipe a few times and my family really likes it. Easy and quick to make. I cook the potatoes and onion ahead of time and just before serving reheat and add the lemon and parsley. Great low fat dish.

I felt that this dish was very good in that it was easy to make and the combination of the paprika, onion, and fresh parsley gave the dish a unique flavor.

This side dish was ok. Thought the lemon juice added at the end was a little overpowering for my tastes.
