This is great, and very easy, but the author forgot to mention when to put in the vanilla and where! I added it to the egg mixture after I'd added the milk, as I was so focused on following the directions, I realized too late that the vanilla was not mentioned. Still delicious! Top with nutmeg and a sprig of mint for a nice finish.

Lovely, creamy custard with good color and pudding-like consistency.

This was really, really yummy. Instead of all milk, I used 1 1/2 cups coconut milk and 2 cups of whole milk, and it turned out so good!
