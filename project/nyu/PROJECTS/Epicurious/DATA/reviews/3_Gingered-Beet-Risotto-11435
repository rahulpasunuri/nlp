This was a great recipe for beets. I didn't have any wine, so I just skipped it, came out fine. I did add more grated ginger at the finish and used about a cup of parmesean. When I make it again, I'll also use more garlic at the start. My husband thought it was great too!

DID USE 3 LBS. OF BEETS.

This was a good idea that just needs some fixing. I made the recipe as written but would echo some earlier comments that it could have used more "something." I would probably not use chicken broth as the flavor might overwhelm the beets. I'll either use veggie broth or the orange juice addition suggested. Also, more beets and ginger would be wonderful. Don't skip the beet greens. I'm looking forward to tinkering.

I have made this recipe many times and to add zest to it, add garlic and fresh orange juice in the beet broth and orange zest at the end.

I had one shortcut but we loved the result! I roasted the beets in the oven but then I skipped making the beet broth. I simply chopped the beets and added it to the risotto in a later stage as the recipe indicates. Instead of beet broth, I used chicken broth. Turned out great.

not my favorite risotto dish, nor beet dish. i love both independently, but this was really missing something...beautiful presentation, but surprisingly bland.

I really loved this recipe, but hesitate to give a 4 forks because it lacked that "je ne sais quoi". Next time I prepare it (and I certainly will because it has promise to be a great dish) will be to add more ginger, maybe some shallot and/or garlic. I loved the addition of the beet greens, gave it an extra bite. An awesome looking dish on the plate with whiter meats, like a pork tenderloin.

I've added ginger root to the broth, and added choped green stems of beet stir-fried for a minute in olive oil together with beet to risotto. Also it's nice to add almost at the end of cooking a little bit fresh smashed garlic and freshly grated ginger root. Very good both looks and taste.

I found this to be a bit bland. I will try it again, however, I'll up the amount of pureed beet in the broth and double the amount of both garlic and ginger. The appearance of the dish was great.

Beautiful and flavorful. My first risotto, and a great success. Since I hadn't made one before, I hadn't realized how all-consuming a task it was. Luckily my girlfriend came home in time to cook the rest of the meal, otherwise we would have had only the risotto - not really a problem!

Easy, gorgeous, and good enough to win over non-beet-eaters.

My first risotto! And very easy to make as well as flavourful. A couple of my guests were a little hesitant to tell me that beets were not their favorite veggie. But after they asked for seconds they admitted that this risotto was totally ymmy. I served it alongside the honey hoison salmon steaks. These mouthwatering orange and red dishes looked beautiful on the plate.
