Made as written except I added roasted red peppers that I wanted to use. The sauce is very tasty but I agree with another reviewer that the sauce would benefit from being a little thicker. Next time, I'll cook the tomatoes longer, add some paste, and then add the remaining ingredients.

This was delicious. Came across this recipe as a way to use up a bit of port; I didn't have enough so added some sherry as well. Next time, I might use slightly less olives and capers as it came out very salty, but I like olives, capers, AND salt, so really you can't go wrong.

This recipe had a lot of potential, but I felt that the port ruined it. It came out way too sweet for my liking, and washed out the flavors of the capers and olives. I'll make this again, though, except I'll be sure to use a dry red wine instead.

The port wine makes all the difference. Try to stick to fresh herbs only. Best tomato base sauce (vegetarian) we've tasted yet. Anybody has a four-fork reco?

I really wanted to love this dish as I love all the ingredients and it was easy and quick. Unfortunately, I found the sauce to be far too watery (even after adding tomato paste) for my tastes and that too many of the wonderful fresh herb flavors were lost. Very disappointing.

This recipe is boring...an awful lot of work for a rather indescript flavor. Wouldn't bother to make it again.

Tossed in a few toasted pine nuts and used a bit more Port. Used at least fresh basil and oregano; the rest of the herbs for me are usually dried. Love this recipe and make it often! Agree with authors - go light on the parmesan. Delish!

I made this dish for a party of 40 by quadrippling the recipe. I used canned, diced "kitchen ready" tomatos. I also added 5lbs of shrimp that I first peeled, deveined and then sauteed in garlic. The dish was a hit, everybody came back for seconds and practically licked the bowl! tlz, Putney, VT

When I saw that this recipe included kalamata olives, capers and Port, I knew it could never be "ordinary". I used all fresh herbs and kept the crushed red pepper to 1 teaspoon. While it definitely had a kick to it, I didn't find it too hot. If you like strong flavors to your food, this one is a must. Just wonderful!

I love this recipe - and unlike the others, I do not find it difficult or too timely to prepare. However, I do enjoy the process of cooking and maybe that makes all the difference. This dish has a nice, contrasting flavor with the olives and pepper and herbs. I think it is wonderful!

I didn't find anything exciting or special about this dish, and it seemed a lot of work for a very ordinary sauce. I peeled and seeded fresh tomatoes, but would use tinned if I did it again.

The first time I made this dish I was in awe. After one spoonfull, I sat down and said aloud, "Damn, I'm a good cook." It reamins one of my favorite pasta dishes to this day.

This dish was a big hit. I made it with 2 14 1/2 oz. cans diced tomatoes instead of fresh. The only thing I would change is to lower the amount of crushed red pepper to probably 1/2 tsp. While I like spicy food, this was just a little too hot.

We loved this recipe and have passed it along to several other pasta lovers. I used pre-pitted kalamata olives to save time and effort. It held up very well as left overs the next day. In fact, it was almost better.

really good- I had to do without the port wine and it was still really good.

Great dish and very simple to make. I used plain black olives and it was wonderful.

This was a delicious recipe. The hardest part was pitting the olives and all the chopping, but the end result was well worth it.
