I probably am having problems with my oven, but mine burned terribly in 9 minutes. These have a lot of butter, so watch them carefully. Thankfully, I made a double batch so I had plenty.

Makes a smooth, easy to work-with dough. Delicious!

This was the perfect crust. It's yummy without being too sweet, it's firm and not at all crumbly, wonderfully soft texture, it was very easy to make, and I've made both the lemon and chocolate tarts with amazing results. Definitely a keeper!

These were pretty good. I didn't like the way they looked when I pressed them into the pan, so I rolled out the dough, cut them with a round cookie cutter and then placed them in the pan to give them scalloped edges. They turned out very pretty, though I was looking for something a little less dough-like. I filled them with vanilla ice cream and lime curd and they tasted wonderful, though maybe a little too thick for my taste.

I made just 24 of these. They were easy, and although a bit time-consuming to roll up 24 little balls and press them into 24 tins, that's inevitable if you want mini-pastries. They are very tasty and versatile, and I was so happy to get this idea for making tartlets without having expensive mini tart pans. However, they really should be advertised as mini-quiches rather than tartlets, since the sides are high due to the muffin tins. But still just as cute and delicious.

Really easy to make! I used fluted tartlet pans and liked the result. Perfect for a topping of whipped cream and berries or lemon curd.

Absolutely amazing. (There's not much to say other than this is pure perfection.)

Superb! An easy recipe, I was able to prepare without much difficulty. I followed the recipe without any variation or substitution. The results were excellent! A light, flavorful shell, perfect in color and texture. An ethereal sweetness. I taste-tested a couple of them fresh out of the oven - delicious!!! I am planning on filling them with key lime custard or lemon curd and topping with creme fraiche. I can't wait to taste the finished results!
