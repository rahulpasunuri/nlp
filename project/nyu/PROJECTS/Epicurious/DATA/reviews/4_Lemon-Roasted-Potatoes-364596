I made this recipe for a group on vacation last night, and it was a big hit. Pursuant to some of the other reviewers' notes, I decided to make the vinaigrette with half the amount of olive oil, mix the garlic into the vinaigrette, and spoon much of it over the potatoes at the 30-minute mark. (We also subbed in parsley/chives for the dill and used pre-diced garlic, which cut way down on prep time.) I roasted the potatoes another twenty minutes or so, dusted with salt, and served with the vinaigrette on the side for whoever felt they wanted more. The potatoes were crispy and had a bright, summery taste. Recommended!

I loved this recipe and will make it every time I make roast potatoes. I used small yukon golds. Instead of 2 tbl of sauce with the garlic I mixed nearly all of it together and, after the 30 min roast, I tossed with the sauce several times so that they didn't get soggy. Put them in a bit over 45 mins and they were crispy and delicious.

I made this recipe as part of the "Go Greek" menu. But I winnowed down ingredients for one. So exceptionally yummy! I would make again!

Great recipe! I used tarragon instead of dill - my personal preference, but it worked really well.

i thought this was really good but agree that the dressing is way too much. in fact next time i'll take out the last step of pouring the dressing over the "done" fingerlings as it makes those nice crispy potatoes kind of soggy. also i turned the oven up to 450 for the last 15 min and cut the time back a tad as this was sharing the oven with the lemon oregano chicken which was also delish and they came out great.

Delicious. Made for Easter brunch. Do not use the whole cup of extra virgin olive oil though. Cook from Darien, CT was right. I cut it to 1/2 cup and I still had too much. I think you could ease up on all dressing ingredients. Be sure to top with kosher salt before serving.

I made this with Yukon Golds and they were still fab.

This is good but WAY too much oil is called for in this recipe. I prepared the dressing and ended up using maybe a quarter of it.

This is an easy and delicious recipe with little last minute work. I used larger potatoes cut in wedges, and it turned out fine.
