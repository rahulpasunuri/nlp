The first time I made this I cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup but it was still way too sweet. I also used a little almond extract as someone suggested. My family ate it but asked for less lemon juice, no almond, and less sweet. The second time I made the pie I only used 1 cup of sugar and decreased the lemon juice to 2 Tlbs. and used only vanilla extract per the recipe (the almond was overpowering for our taste). The pie received rave reviews the second time around.

I used a crust I made myself and the edges shrunk a little after I baked it, consequently my filling was a little too much. Next time I will probably make the edges really hang over the sides. In also thought the baking time was a little long as the pie was browner and tougher to cut than I wanted. Overall, it was pretty good and super fast to make.

I halved this recipe to bake in ramekins (the egg wasn't easy, ha!) which worked fine with the same baking time. I opted to bake the crust for a few minutes longer than directed b/c it still looked too un-done in the center of the bottom. It was fine, sweet, but for some reason I was hoping for more coconut flavor. I even added a dash of coconut extract during assembly. I think the biggest drawback, though, wasn't the recipe, it was the crust. If I made this again I would use a crust recipe off this site that incorporates coconut, to give it that last much needed boost.

This pie was heavenly. All my friends and family raved about it. I tried to make it with Splenda and that did not go well at all so I made it regular sugar with spectacular results. The top came out very brown (almost looked like pecan pie) so I might lessen the baking time just a bit the next time I make it. It had no effect on the taste but I think it would have looked prettier if it weren't so brown.

This is absolutely nothing like a coconut chess pie, or a coconut cream pie. It's more like the gooey filling of a pecan pie, studded with shredded coconut. I love how the top of the pie forms a chewy/crispy crust. It reminds me of a coconut macaroon. Surprisingly, I found the lemon juice to be a bit too pronounced. I might halve the amount next time.

Sorry, forgot to mention that I used a 1/2 & 1/2 combo of vanilla extract and almond extract! Try it...the almond really brings out the flavor of the coconut!

I had just received some of those cute little leaf-shaped pie crust cutters and couldn't wait to try them out, so wanted to find an easy pie to make with ingredients I had in the pantry. I found some coconut and immediately came to Epicurious to find a recipe. This sounded EASY and DH loves coconut, so I tried it. OMG!!! I do not really care for coconut, but I loved the taste and texture of this pie! It is reminiscent of a pecan pie filling. Following the advice of other eviewers, I cut the sugar back, but only by 1/4 cup. It was perfect! DH had to have a small sliver after it had only cooled about 45 minutes. When I saw him roll his eyes back into his head, I knew I had a hit! He's already begging me to make it again!

My husband has been making a similar pie for years. His Grandma in Ark. calls it Chess Pie, something he's loved since he was a boy. I thought this was it... but his calls for sweetend condensed milk and vinegar. I followed this receipe, without the milk and added lots of vanillia, and apple cider vigegar instead of the lemon juice. The flavor was really amazing, I really liked the variation! Interesting how much the vinegar tasted like lemons.

After reading the reviews, I used 1 cup sugar instead of 1 1/2. My family absolutely loved this pie. It was a bit sweet for me but very tasty. I found that is appeared to be slightly less sweet when I ate it the next day. I will certainly make this again.

I had a craving for coconut pie, looked up this recipe and made it. It was just exactly what I wanted, and was easy as can be to throw together. I used slightly less sugar. Very yum.

So, this is what I get for being lazy. I was in the mood for a coconut CREAM pie but all the recipes on this site seemed to be more complicated and time-consuming than I wanted. So, I opted instead of this coconut pie. It was very easy to make, took no time at all. But I was not impressed whatsoever. It came out dry, not exciting. It was very sweet but not the coconutty sweetness I was looking for - just a plain sugar sweet. I will NOT make this again.

This is now my favorite coconut pie recipe. It is super-fast to make and absolutely delicious. I toasted additional coconut for topping. Perfect for a an easy week-night dessert or pot-luck.

I am a born and raised Yankee with very limited exposure to Southern cooking. I served this pie to my boyfriend who has been pestering me for years to learn how to cook soul food. I fixed this one night last week and the look of pure bliss on his face was worth it. My only complaint? He wouldn't share the pie with anyone else. I substituted lime juice for the lemon, since this all I had on hand at the time.

A deliciously simple recipe. Very sweet, but a crowd pleaser. It took almost an hour to bake.

I've made this pie twice. On both occassions, I received rave reviews. The filling is very, very sweet and rich...very similar to tassie filling or pecan pie filling. I also made my own regular old pie crust. If you love coconut, this is the pie to make. Especially good with chocolate ice cream.
