There's got to be a better recipe for peas than this. Absolutely no flavor.

Very meh. Again swimming in liquid even after adjusting as suggested elsewhere. Garlic and thyme flavors did not really come through. I like the idea for this recipe, but next time I'll saute the garlic and thyme in butter and toss with steamed peas.

this was ok but not a huge difference from "regular" peas with butter. My kids didn't like them and they usually are crazy for peas. I do agree with San Jose that the amount of water needed for frzen peas needs to be cut WAY back. I used about half of what was called for and they were still swimming. I think a few tablespoons should do it. I probably won't make again.

I love this idea for peas! It adds a wonderful variety to traditional plain peas without being overpowering and unusual (so the picky eaters won't be left out). One of my favorites, I'll probably use this for Christmas dinner again this year.

I made this simple dish with rice as a quick lunch. It was great, my wife loved it. I am going to add this recipe to my bag of tricks.

I'm lucky enough to be able to get fresh peas from our farmers market, and this was an excellent way to cook them. I'll definitely be making this one again.

Excellent! I used frozen baby peas at Xmas. It was a hit and have made it several times. Even my toddler likes it.

Used a bag of frozen peas & carrots. Good change of pace for the usual.

These peas were fantastic! I really never been much of a pea fan, but I found this dish delish. I did use chicken broth instead of water, also upped the garlic. I could not find fresh peas, but even with frozen, it was still awesome.

Easy addition to make to standard peas. A word of caution when substituting frozen peas: reduce the amount of water added as frozen peas already have a fair amount of water in them. This made my recipe too runny, and I couldn't boil off all of the water. I had to drain the peas, and unfortunately most of the thyme. Still, the favor was an improvement over standard peas.
