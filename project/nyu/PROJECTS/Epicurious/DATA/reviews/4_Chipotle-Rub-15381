To the person who wanted the Fajita recipe from the La Parilla cookbook: sprinkle both sides of 2-lb skirt steak with chipotle rub (3T total) and onion (1 small, white onion, finely diced). Moisten with beer (1/2 c dark Mexican beer) and olive oil (1/2 c). Let marinade briefly (up to 30 mins). FYI, you can find lots of copies of this cookbook on Half.com. Hope this helps!

Can anyone please help with exact amounts of beer, lime, etc? The cookbook is out of print and I want to make this for chicken fajitas for a party this weekend.

GOD -- spectacular when mixed with the dark Mexican beer, lime juice, and olice oil in La Parilla's fajita recipe. Best grilled chicken ever.

I rubbed steak with this then marinaded along with Dos Equis amber & olive oil. It's a fajita recipe from the La Parilla cookbook. Mmm... sooo good! I highly recommend combining chipotle rub & beer. This makes lots of rub.

Great condiment for just about anything that is grilled. I've been making it for over a year and give it to friends and family and they all love it too. I now add the zest of 3 blood oranges and 3 T of Droste dutch process cocoa to it and 2 T of whole cumin seeds that are toasted along with the oregano.
