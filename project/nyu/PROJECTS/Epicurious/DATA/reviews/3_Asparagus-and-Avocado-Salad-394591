Rave reviews at my dinner party. Blanched asparagus 2 minutes then sliced them oh so thinly on the diagonal with a knife. Arranged avocado slices in a wheel on top of the asparagus and added bits of goat cheese and chopped mint and sea salt. It paired well with champagne as a first course.

We did enjoy this salad. I didn't find the shaving of the asparagus all that difficult & used a thin paring knife to slice the parts too small to shave. I also did not make individual salads but mixed all ingredients together in one bowl; cut the avocado into cubes & added some onion for crunch. Next time I will use more of the asparagus bunch and will eliminate the mint. Neither my husband nor I really care for mint & I don't think it added anything. Altogether a very nice salad.

This technique of stripping the aspargus was a pain and not worth it. Also I thought I might cut myself. Took tons of time. Looked cool. The flavor combined weren't very good either. I topped with fresca cheese and still not good. I liked the idea, tried to make it 'work' but didn't.
