I was reluctant to try this for my Thanksgiving turkey with only one review. However, it was exceptional! I made a garlic/rosemary/sage/olive oil rub and rubbed it between the meat and skin. It was moist and delightful! Anything wrapped in bacon is a treat too. My only regret is that I bought the pesto and I didn't think the pesto was very good. Next time I'll use a higher quality pesto or make my own.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used pepper bacon, and a puree of basil, garlic, and rosemary under the skin. Also I added extra pine nuts to the stuffing. The gravy was simple and delicous. All seven of my dinner guests loved this tasty and moist turkey.
