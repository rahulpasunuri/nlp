I found it to be a bit acidic. To balance, i added two tablespoons of honey. In addition, I added a pinch of smoked paprika.

I had this at a friend's house and it was so delicious that our conversation kept getting interrupted by oohs and aahs and mmmmmmmhs.

I was making an Italian antipasta party and wanted the shrimp to be a highlight. This recipe was a great success. I did not have the piment d'Espelette so I used cayenne and it was fine. I let it marinate overnight and the flavors were deep and delicious. I have a new batch marinating so I can have it all for myself.

Simple, flavorful, refreshing, delicious - definitely a keeper. Served the shrimp over lettuce with the dressing, and leftovers worked tossed with linguini. probably will try a bit more anchovy and garlic next time.

Fantastic, a wonderful summer dish. I served it with my favorite tabbouleh salad and fresh ice tea. I used anchovey paste instead of fillets and next time would add more. Might even consider sprinkling with a fine goat cheese also for a bit of zing.
