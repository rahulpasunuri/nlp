This was amazingly rich and good. It was only the second time we had made ice cream, didn't get as thick as I thought it should coming out of the machine, when frozen got a shiny look to the surface. But that didn't matter in the end because it tasted awesome with chocolate sauce , whipped cream and a cherry on top. It got a lot of "You made this?" responces.

Does anyone know how you can make the ice cream without an ice cream maker? Every recipe seems to call for one but I am sure there is a way of making ice cream without - any suggestions?

This ice cream is just delicious! I did not make the chocolate sauce because the ice cream is so rich and delicious that it did not need it! I make this all summer long for guests and the kids! Everyone loves it!
