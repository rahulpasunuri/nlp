This is a great dish. I had to make a couple changes but it was delicious nevertheless. I didn't have leeks and substituted shallots, and used a large can of Cento Italian peeled tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. We will keep this recipe!

Delicious! Wow. The tomatoes! The arugula! The goat cheese! Yum. I will definitely make this again.

Super Yummy if you like creamy spicy pasta. I halved the recipe but bumped up some other things. My sis said "if this is wrong, I don't want any right." I did 1 lb of tomatoes and 2 tbsp or so of balsamic vinegar. The same amount of bacon, in my opinion the world is too short to live without bacon. I did one medium leek, 1 tbsp of garlic, 1/2 tbsp rosemary, 1/2 tbsp of red pepper (grabbed the wrong spoon, but the heat was just right) about 3 cups of spinach, and 4 oz of goat cheese. Same idea with the goat cheese as the bacon, life's too short not to enjoy it! Super Super yummy, and we drank Folie a Deux Sauv Blanc. It went really well with the pasta. Definitely adding to my weekly rotation recipes.

This one's a keeper. I only wish I'd had a glass of wine to wash it down with. Will have to do so next time.

Just made this for dinner and everyone ate it but we kept talking about what was wrong with it... sad to say I do not agree with most of the other reviews and will not be making this again.

Even DH, who hates arugula, voted this 4 forks. Used canned tomatoes instead of fresh since it's off-season and dolloped the goat cheese at the end instead of mixing it in. Definitely the way to go. I think the idea of adding toasted pine nuts is great - wish I'd had some!

I loved this pasta...very fresh and creamy. I used 6 slices of pancetta instead of bacon and halved the rest of the recipe. I really liked the taste of the arugula.

This pasta is delicious and has such a warm, unique taste. I would not want to mess with the balance and substitute anything, although I did leave out the parmesan since I'm not a big fan, and I didn't want to distract from the creaminess of the goat cheese. I halved the recipe, except for the bacon and the balsamic vinegar. I had never soaked tomatoes in balsamic before, and I thought it was wonderful. I might even add more next time. I was also surprised at the wonderful soft sweetness the leeks added - I was not very familiar with their flavor and will use them more often after making this recipe. This pasta is just wonderful! Such a great combination of flavors.

I thought this was super easy and I served for company, everyone enjoyed it! I did increase the olive oil to 6 Tbl instead of 2, this helped the sauce be a little creamier.

My wife bought watercress instead of arugula but it was still great. Added basil also. Will add pine nuts next time. Good wholesome creaminess. My that sounds odd...

I make this pasta about once every two weeks. It's amazing! Left overs are even great too!

This is very good but I think it needs a few additions to be a four fork dish. I doubled the bacon, added more goat cheese, and used about twice as much parmesean. Not necessarily healthy additions but I thought it was a little boring as-is. If you make those changes, it's excellent. I also liked it much better after a day or two.

This was delicious. I added diced pieces of boneless chicken breasts after I cooked the bacon. Used canned diced tomatoes (removed most of the watery liquid) and campanelli pasta. The sauce held up great with this trumpet shaped pasta. Will make again.

Rating: 3
Delicious dish. Perfect amount of goat cheese for a rich sauce that was great with the peppery arugula. Needed a bit more seasoning even with the bacon. The tomatoes made for a bit too much moisture. Would love to try with other kinds of pasta as well.

I made this using my own garden plum tomatoes, pancetta instead of thick bacon, green onions instead of leeks, my garden basil instead of rosemary, and baby spinach instead of arugula. This sauce base was excellent! However, I also used the 6 oz. of goat cheese, but it was left over from an 8 oz. package I had opened only a few days ago. It was definitely too "cheesy" in flavor; maybe not fresh enough. Perhaps sprinkling it on top like others suggested would work better, or using VERY fresh goat cheese. I will definitely try it again using very fresh goat cheese and sprinkling it on top, and maybe a little less parmessan as well. That one can always be added as it is served. I also used farfalle and can see why others suggested not using fettuccine. It really needs a pasta that will "hold" the sauce and not break down. I'm anticipating that this will even be more evident when it is reheated. Overall, as I made it, good, but needing improvement.

Just did not enjoy this. If I make it again, I'd use fresh basil instead of the arugula, increase the red peppers and omit the goat cheese. I like goat cheese, just not in this combo.

My husband and daughter really enjoyed this dish. We loved the creaminess of the goat cheese and flavor combination was fantastic. It was a great weeknight meal.

We totally enjoyed this meal. I was too lazy to cut up tomatoes so I bought diced tomatoes in a can and drained them. My husband could not stop raving about it. I followed the recipe exactly except for the tomatoes I mentioned above. Make it, you really will enjoy it.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. Not only does it taste good, but this is very easy to change. We tried the pasta with olives, smoked salmon, etc. Also, instead of using fettuccine, we used farfalle. Fettuccine was a bit hard to work with. Instead of adding all goat cheese to pasta and tossing it (which melts into the pasta), we topped it with crumbled goat cheese. No matter what we added, the flavor was great. This is an awesome pasta.

I have made this dish many times and my guests have always raved about the taste. I, too have made substitutions. Used prosciutto instead of bacon. Scallions or shallots instead of leeks. And any kind of pasta works well.

My husband and I are not big pasta fans, but this recipe was superb. I substituted hot pepper infused olive oil and baby spinach for the arugala AND I added some fresh asparagus cuts before adding the tomatoes. It was spicier and quite tasty.

This recipe is delicious and fairly straightforward to make. The goat cheese adds a nice flavor. I doubled the recipe but felt like I ended up with too much pasta for the sauce I had, but maybe I did my math wrong. I used canned (diced) tomatoes because I'm lazy and it was still good.

Rating: 4
I guess I didn't really make this recipe but it was an excellent jumping off point, used Farfalle (all the reviewers are right, farfalle really works in this), canned tomatoes, pancetta, basil instead of rosemary, and baby spinach instead of arugula. It was very, very good.

Rating: 3
This is really fantastic with a great combination of flavors and it's easy enough to make for a quick weeknight meal. I used pancetta instead of bacon and since tomatoes aren't in season anymore I opted for canned. This will stay in my recipe box!

I LOVE this recipe. I used canned Italian tomatoes, substituted spinach for arugula and used veggie bacon (I'm sure regular is better, but we veggies can be picky).

My daughter-in-law requested a pasta dish with goat cheese for dinner last evening. I had all the fixings for this dish and everyone loved it. My salad, on the other hand, stunk...literally. I will never use the bagged, prewashed lettuce again. I washed it to try to get that smell away but it never left and it ruined it for me. Glad the pasta was so good!

Rating: 3
How good is this? Really good, that's how. Easy to make, quick and with delicious results. You could go a little easier (or not) on the Balsamic, depending on taste. I didn't have enough arugula so I added some baby spinach; no problem. Also, I waited till serving to add bacon to maintain its crispness. And I don't think you need the extra Parmesan, it's a cheesy enough dish. Enjoy.

This was wonderful-I made this dish for a dinner party, and added pine nuts.

Agree, don't mix the goat chees in -- scatter chunks on top. And here in the Bay Area you can get bagged washed baby arugula at the chain groceries -- rednet xdevelopment -- how easy can you get? And use canned diced tomatoes -- altogether a great, quick, light, stylish weeknight supper.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and different. Next time, I will not mix the goat chesse in but use it to garnish the top - it will keep the flavors sharper rather than melting into a creamy - if tasty - goo. Do recomend using the listed ingredients and not substituing: leaks, argugula, goat cheese and all. They really make this dish distinctive. The flavors work wonderfully together.

Rating: 4
For an easy weeknight supper, this is just AWESOME! I usually substitute green onions for the leeks (too pricey and a PAIN to clean) and bagged baby spinach for the arugula (again, ease of prep.). Never ANY leftovers....

This recipe was wonderful--if you like goat cheese! We substitutes spinach for arugula, onions for the leeks and used a can of diced tomatos. It was very easy and a big hit with my husband.

Can't imagine this dish without the arugula...I made it once without and it wasn't the same. This recipe is an excellent main course...I served a double recipe to several friends who all brought red wine, and I can't remember them having a better time. Be prepared for the time it takes to chop leeks finely and seed tomatoes. Every time I do this recipe I underestimate the time it takes to prepare the veggies. Be conservative with the goat cheese, add almost all that the recipe calls for and taste first. It is possible for the goat cheese to overwhelm the other flavors.

Made this one evening after work...quick and simple. Substituted linguine for fettucine, spinach for arugula, and onion for leeks (didn't have time for a grocery trip). Heated up well for lunch the next day. Husband thought it was too spicy, but I loved it.

my husband made this for me after a long day at work and it made me feel a million times better, definite comfort food. he used boxed fetucinni and we used fake bacon instead of real and it was grand. the sauce reminds me of pink vodka sauce you get in real italian restaurants.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I cut the ingredients in half, used baby spinach instead of arugula on 1 lb. of noodles. There was quite enough sauce for that much pasta.

Magnifico! Given the rather ordinary ingredients (I couldn't find arugula and so substituted baby spinach), I didn't think this was going to be anything special...but it was AMAZING!

YUM! This dish was really good. There's alot going on, but the flavors are all very complimentary. My only variation was using penne instead of fettuccine, as suggested by many other reviewers, and I agree that it was a much better shape for the chunky sauce. My mother and sister both loved it as well... nothing overpowered... some suggested omiting the bacon, but I say no way! I suppose if you felt strongly about doing so, you should really add something else that would give it a little crunch - maybe pine nuts. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

i love this! i've made it on several occasions, and it turns out great every time! depending on what I've got in the fridge, i've substituted turkey bacon, canadian bacon, spinach, miscellaneous farm cheeses...all with great results.

We really enjoyed this dish. We made it exactly as described, cutting the recipe in half for two people. We also used a different pasta as others suggested - gemelli (sp?) We may try this again without the goat cheese. Though delicious, we felt the dish was a bit rich to make more than once in a while. Without the goat cheese, this dish would be very fresh-tasting and light.

Rating: 4
This was so yummy...incorporated so many of my favorite foods. I used turkey bacon, which was great, and I used tat-soi instead of arugula...milder but very interesting flavor. Also, to keep the sauce from becoming runny, I added the tomato mixture to the pasta using a slotted spoon.

Rating: 4
yum! this was great. like some of the others i used farfalle which was perfect for catching all the goodies. i disagree that it was too spicy, i thought the red pepper was necessary to contrast with the sweet balsamic vinegar and the goat cheese which would have been overwhelming otherwise. and the bacon is definitely a must!

Rating: 4
Excellent!

Rating: 3
This was an awesome dish...very flavorful. Only two complaints: as others have said, the fettuccine is so unwieldy, it would be better with penne or a similar size pasta; the other complaint is the spiciness. I cut the recipe in half so I only used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. I always use this amount in the dishes I make, but in this dish, that amount made it very hot. Other than that, this dish halved very nicely.

This was delicious. I agree that it would have been great without the bacon--so many strong flavors. I used farfalle. Will definitely make this again.

Made it with dried linguine, firmer so had no trouble mixing or eating it. Had all ingred. on hand except goat cheese so used feta, very good. one suggestion , it does not say to discard bacon grease, i did and replaced it with additional olive oil . Also used low fat feta so fat grams were considerably reduced

Rating: 4
Very good -- especially without the bacon! The other flavors in this recipe are inherently strong and capable of standing alone; also, I thought the addition of bacon would make the dish too rich. I used Penne, agreeing with others that Fettuccine is too unweildy for easy mixing. A hit with my sometimes finicky husband.

Rating: 3
This recipe is easy, in expensive and so good days after. I used farfalla instead of fettucine: easier to mix. You can use any number of meats..(any kind of sausage works just as well) It's a great meal when you have unexpected guests. I do cook a lot so the ingredients in this dish are staples in my home, others may find it more specialty items. I love this recipe and make it at least 4 times a month.

Rating: 2
Tasty dish. I used capellini, and substituted pancetta for the bacon. I don't like goat cheese so instead I used a Reblochon Chavie (a brie-like cheese, recommended by the cheese counter guy), but like the previous reviewer said, this made the sauce milky and it lost its shine. I'll use only the Parmesan the next time.

Rating: 2
Fettuccine seemed to be the wrong pasta shape for this recipe. It was difficult to mix all of the chunky sauce ingredients with the long strands of pasta. The goat cheese, though added at the last minute, after the pasta was in its serving bowl, melted rapidly, giving the sauce a milky quality which muted the bright colors of the tomatoes and arugula. The taste wasn't bad--it was mediocre, I'd say--but it wasn't worth the expense of the specialty ingredients.

Rating: 3
This is a real spunky dish, and unusual (but very tasty) with the balsamic vinegar. Proportions are wonderfully flexible (we even made it once without the bacon -- also yummy). Hint: if you're planning to have leftovers, save out some of the arugula, and add it to the leftovers when you reheat -- you get that fresh green flavor.

Rating: 4
This was fun to make, smelled great and although the arugula is probably not supposed to cook thoroughly or be reheated, I did so and had it all week for my lunches. I added more goat cheese for additional protein.
