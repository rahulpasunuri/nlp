This recipe rocks! I skipped the brandy and used 3/4 c of dried cherries instead of raisins because a lot of my guests don't care for them. Terrific dessert for a winter holiday.

I soaked the raisins in orange juice, increased the eggs to 4 whole eggs + 1 extra yolk, decreased butter to 3 TB (including what I used to butter the pan) and decreased the sugar to half a cup. Next time I would: put the pannetone slices in the toaster and add melted butter to the custard mix instead (pan frying took too long), decrease the sugar even more, and only cook for 40 minutes (I cooked for 45 to get the top more browned, but ended up with it burning on the bottom - watch out, it burns easily!).

For xmas eve, doubled the recipe and soaked golden raisins in amaretto and St. Germaine. Awesome results. Possibly even better as leftovers served cold.

Found it a lot easier and less messy to melt the butter; brush one side with melter butter, put it in skillet buttered-side down, then brush butter the top side. Also didn't want to buy bourbon just for this so used dark rum. Added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Made a rum sauce for it. Made it the day before, took it to Christmas lunch. Forgot to reheat it. Everyone loved it anyway. Just imagine if it was served warm.

As advertised! Easy, quick and delicisous! Use a good quality panettone and serve with bourbon sauce found on this site. I've made it twice - serve it straight from the oven rather than reheated as suggested.

Alright, I'm sorry, I don't know what keeps happening to my review! One last go... This recipe was inspiring. I used leftover challah, dried cranberries that I soaked in a tawny port and let me tell you. It was amazing. Amazing! I am making it for every and any holiday I can get away with.

Very easy and very good. I skipped buttering the panettone and instead put unbuttered slices under broiler to toast. This worked well, but I suppose it depends on the panettone you choose. Mine (from Costco) was quite buttery to start. I left raisins out, but think next time will try with dried cherries.

I forgot to add that I bought a Bauducco Hershey Pannetone with chocolate chips at Wegman's. I think that added to the wonderful taste of the bread pudding. Who doesn't like a bit of chocolate?

Absolutely delicious! Easy to make and a dream to eat! A great addition to any Christmas or holiday dessert menu.

wonderful recipe! even my 14 yr old son, who doesn't like bread pudding loved this with cinnamon caramel sauce: 1/4 cup cream, 1/2 cup (packed) golden brown sugar, 1/8 teaspoon (generous) ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoons vanilla extract. Combine brown sugar and 1/4 cup cream in small saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves and caramel sauce is smooth. Remove from heat; stir in cinnamon and vanilla.

This recipe is fantastic. I could not believe how delicious this bread pudding was when I finished it. I made a couple modifications to the recipe, which I think added to the taste. We did not have panettone, so we used a slightly sweet bread with raisins in it. I also added nutmeg and spice to the mixture, as I felt they would enhance the flavour of the pudding. I am going to make it again this weekend.

Wow this was good. I bought the panettone from Costco. I used Grand Marnier instead of brandy to soak the raisins and did not discard the excess GM, just poured it over the panettone. I used a vanilla bean + i tablespoon of extract and used only one half cup of sugar. I served it with orange caramel sauce and orange sorbet, recipes also available on this site. This was one of the best things I have ever made. Will be making this many more times.

This is such a delicious bread pudding! I used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar and added a bit of cinnamon; it turned out fantastic. I also had to cook it about 10 minutes extra. Great texture; smooth and creamy on bottom, slightly crisp and buttery on top!

Wonderful and easy dish. Have made 3 times. Instead of frying bread, I buttered both sides, put on a cookie sheet in a hot oven and browned there. Turned over about 1/2 way through. Also increased the custard a bit, I like mine a little more moist.

Wonderful and easy. Adjusted the recipe using dry cherries and brown sugar.

Exceptionally delicious and easy to make! I've always liked bread pudding, but the panettone stepped it up a notch. I used Amaretto instead of the brandy and added it to the wet ingredients. It was fabulous. Everyone raved. I will definitely make it again.

I made this for New Years and it was fantastic! I didn't have brandy for the raisins so I substituted Grand Marnier. The orange flavor complemented the candied orange in the panettone, so it was perfect! Panettone is my favorite dessert, and this bread pudding took it to another level!

When I saw this recipe, I thought it would be good. But I didn't think it would be THIS good. I'm not the world's biggest pannetone fan, but this is just outstanding.

I have made this 3 times now to rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. The first time I made it I also made a Bourbon Sauce (Maker's Mark, of course)and passed this at the table. As prior reviewer said it is also good for breakfast (minus the Bourbon Sauce) and microwave works well. You will not be disappointed.

I made this using eggnog in place of the half and half...and added some cinnamon and nutmeg - delicious. The eggnog really adds a lot more flavor to this recipe.

I needed a recipe for breakfast Christmas morning and I had a panettone... This is just excellent. Watch pan- frying the bread because it browns fast; just soaked the raisins in hot water rather than brandy and they plumped up beautifully. Makes 6 large servings; I made it Christmas Eve and re-heated it Christmas morning - rather than waiting for the whole thing to heat through in the oven, just cut in large squares and heat in microwave for 1 & 1/2 minutes each. Delicious, not soggy, everyone loved it. Ina has a similar recipe on foodnetwork dot com using almonds, but this is a keeper!You won't be disappointed and a great way to use up 1/2 of a 2-lb. panettone!

Fantastic. I'm a big fan of bread pudding to begin with but I made this for breakfast on Christmas morning and it was perfect. I had to cook it about 10 minutes longer to dry the bread out as after the suggested time it was still too wet in the middle. But great flavor and not too sweet. Delicious.
