OK, so making this over and over. In fact, having a party all about mint ice cream. This has gotten rave reviews every time I've served it.

This was deeeeelicious. My three guests agreed. I didn't have an ice cream maker so I had a bit of a work- around to manage. Came out beautifully. Didn't have a terrine pan either...no problemo. So the shape was a little log like....who cares? The ice cream was divinely minty and the chocolate was excellent. Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!!

Wow! I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews here. The ice cream was a piece of cake, so to speak. We grow several varieties of mint and I purposely mixed the varieties. The chocolate was stupendous. The dish was a hit. Guests and family raved!

This ice cream is delicious. I could wish for a sharper mint flavor. Instead of using a terrine, which I don't own, I chopped up some semi- sweet chocolate and made mint chocolate chip ice cream. In addition, I made ice cream sandwiches, using the cookie recipe from the Chocolate Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwiches with Caramel Ice Cream (available from epicurious). Extraordinary! I'll make the ice cream again with my new growth of mint.

This has become a fast favorite with friends and family. I've had to make it 5 times in as many weeks. I cannot imagine what was done that would make this less than fabulous!

This was a very good recipe. I used garden mint and I strained it though cheese cloth and fine sieve. Very successful!

The ice cream is too sweet. The mint gets overshadowed and isn't refresshing enough.

Absolutely delicious! Very refreshing ice cream with a very dark chocolate coating. Imressive presentation, but easy enough to make. My family loved it...my 5 year old asked for seconds in seconds. And he usually dislikes mint! Very different from the fakey mint stuff. I did, however, think the custard tasted strange. But once it was frozen and put together it turned into something else altogether. Try this!

I didn't even get through the ice cream part. The ice cream is absolutely retched. The idea of a mint ice cream made with fresh mint leaves instead of extract was very appealing. Perhaps if you steeped them in the cream/milk? In any event, grinding them up in a blender is not the answer. I'm amazed this made it to print.

This is exquisite! The soft, clear mint flavor, the light and rich texture of the ice cream, and the deep chocolate covering meld together perfectly. Doesn't make a huge amount, but you can slice it thinly. When you want to pull out all the stops, this is the dessert to serve. Plus can be made a day ahead.

I completely agree with the reviewer from MA. The ice cream is terrible. The color is unappetizing and the taste is a cross between medicine and vegetables. I wonder if there was an error in ingredients or instructions.

The concept of mint ice cream encased in bittersweet chocolate is appealing and the technique works well, but the mint ice cream itself is disgusting. It was described by my tasters as "medicinal", "herbaceous", "tastes like tea". Yuck!! Coffee, vanilla, raspberry, or almond ice cream would work well-- or even a better mint ice cream. But forget this one.
