Decidedly good as written, possibly a bit higher than three stars. With some modifications it becomes even better. As mentioned by another reviewer I diced and added a yukon gold initially for body and I used about 1 1/2 lbs. of chicken breasts instead of the thigh meat. I increased the curry powder to 3 tsps. initially to give it the kick that it needed. After adding the puree and stock and simmering for about 10 minutes I added somewhere between 2 and 3 handfulls of fresh baby spinach (for texture and color). When I tasted the final result I was quite pleased but not entirely satisfied and so I finished it off with perhaps a 1/2 can of light coconut milk and an additional 1/2 tsp of curry powder. This soup I would give 3 1/2 stars.

My husband and I enjoyed this a lot, but I also added celery, garlic, a bit of red chili paste, and the unusual twist of peanut butter - 1/4 - 1/3 cup, or to taste.

I used this to make more of a curried stew- added potatoes and ginger. Had to improvise the curry powder with cumin, more coriander, paprika, cinnamon, clove, pepper. Used half the broth and it made a thick sauce - served it with rice. Nice quick and easy meal that we made with little to draw on from the fridge and pantry.

This is delicious, fast, easy and healthy! Including prep time for chopping, etc., it took about 45 minutes to make this hearty, spicy soup. I added 3 cubed potatoes (with skin) to the onions and carrots, doubled the amount of curry, and threw in a package of frozen peas with the broth. If I serve this to company I will garnish with a dollop of sour cream or creme fraiche, for presentation and to cut the spice for those who like it milder. I will make this again and again!

I've made this soup several times and my family and I love it. I add a bit more curry than called for, and top servings with a dollop of low fat sour cream and a sprinkling of chopped cilantro. Great!

I also added potato and used breast meat. I also added some celery. Really I think any veggie subing would be good. I plan on making the recipie and pouring over rice next time.

All in all a pretty good recipe. I added a ton more curry, some garlic, a little cumin and a potato. I still feel like something's missing, but overall it was tasty and very pretty. I think I will use chicken breast the next time (the soup was a little greasy), sub a sweet potato for the potato and add some spinach.

I hate to give such a low review, especially because part of the problem might be mine. First, I took the shortcut and used the baby carrots (pre-cut). The "look" of the soup was way-off because of that! Believe me, it's no shortcut when the soup is visually unappealing. Second, my soup was incredibly HOT!! I used curry powder from Whole Foods and this batch must have been extra spicy. Husband, who usually is not overly fond of hot foods, liked it. I thought it was overpowering. I did like the taste of the cardamom, coriander, and curry.

Very nice and easy. Used crushed red peppers instead of jalapeno. Delicious.

I made this almost exactly as given. I did add more cayenne, salt and pepper, as well as as some breast with the dark meat. It was a wonderful soup, especially nice with sour dough bread warmed and with butter...very nice, but will probably add potatoes and peas next time, to make it heartier. My fiance loved it just the way it was. When he walked in the house he raved about how good it smelled...truly an easy and lovely main dish soup...will make it again!

Awesome. I used chicken breast meat instead, as I don't like all the fuss with chicken thighs. I like my soups hearty, so I added potatoes and peas. Don't skimp on the curry either! So delicious.

This recipe was delish! Easy. A bonus because I always have these ingredients on hand. I added ONE potato and cooked with the carrots and onions as previous reviewers suggested. I served this over rice for a meal. My whole family loved this one.

I am rarely motivated to rate recipes. DELICIOUS. EASY. I followed the recipe exactly. Thighs are no fuss; you can buy boneless thighs and the dark meat is very flavorful for soups. Bland? Not at all. Must use good curry powder. My picky 2-year-old ate 2 bowls. She only eats soup with a lot of flavor. Will make again and again. Thanks!!!

Really fantastic! I would use chicken breast however, less fuss.

the soup isn't even finished on the stove, and already it is delicious. as others suggested, added celery and 1 clove of garlic to carrots and onion. also added 2 small sweet potatoes. while i pureed half of the vegetables, i fried the spices to release their flavors. simply wonderful on this rainy day in new england...

Made this last night. Wow! Did as others suggested added celery and potatoes. Put the onion, carrots and celery in the food processor to chop. Didn't have the cardamom. Added curry paste as well. Used chicken breasts cause that's what I had. This is the best will make this again many times.

I love this soup with cauliflower, potatoes, peas added.

Made this with minor alterations as suggested: added garlic and celery and doubled the curry powder. The curry gave it the needed pop but it still tasted like something was missing (yes, a little bland). So I added in fresh ginger, pepper flakes and...1/2 can coconut milk. The coconut milk reduced the healthy factor but - YUM did that give it the missing flavor. I separated it into two batches and simmered half with chicken and potatoes, served the other half over udon noodles with fresh broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms and fried tofu. I will definitely make this again.

Added potato, celery and minced ginger to veggies, can of cream of celery soup (or chicken) and 2 cups water, touch of sherry and lots of frozen peas. Very good.

I've made this soup at least 20 times for my family and they love it. Even my 9 and 12 year old children request it.

This had such a delicate and unusual flavor! Following earlier reviews, I added some diced celery, a diced white potato and 2 cloves of garlic minced to the sauteed vegetables; used 1/2 hot, 1/2 mild curry. I may increase the curry next time. Once you get past the dicing, this is easy, unique and very tasty. Will become a favorite.

my girlfriend made this for me and it was so good! she added little dumplings that just melted in your mouth. an ideal opening course for a dinner party, especially in late fall or early spring. best with a little extra red pepper, to give it some extra kick! enjoy!

Thank you Epicurious for including reviews with your recipes! I had all the ingredients for this recipe on hand but was reluctant to make it as it looked somewhat boring, but as always, I read the previous reviews and went for it! I pretty much followed the recipe (added garlic and celery when cooking the carrots) and was really really happy with the results. It was raining all day in Southern California and this hearty soup (along with Costco's famous rosemary bread) was just perfect.

This was a great soup! Very tasty. I thickened the soup slightly differently. I added the flour (I used about 3 Tbs) about 6 minutes into the onions and carrots cooking and cooked the floury taste out of it. Then, I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe. I also seasoned to taste with cayenne and salt. It was fantastic!

This is a rich soup - small portions are best. I added 1 shredded potato to thicken as recommended by previous reviewers. Different blend of ingredients.

Earlier reviews very helpful. Didn't have cardamom so increased curry and coriander. Added garlic, celery and noodles. Absolutely delicious. Will definitely make it again!

agree w/ blandness comment from prior rater, so i doubled the quantity of carrots, and added large amounts of celery, potatoes, and crimini mushrooms as well. also some coconut milk and hot pepper flakes, but forewent the flour. very good.

This soup was very good. I did add some salt and pepper as it was definitely missing! (Nothing worse than unseasoned soup :( Also added a little milk before serving.

I've just finished making this and the kitchen smells wonderfully aromatic with those spices and the fresh cilantro. However.... I'm a little disappointed with the flavour of this soup. It is good but there seems to be something missing. Apart from using chicken breasts (what I had in the fridge), I followed the recipe to the letter. There's something a bit one-dimensional about the flavour and the broth is a little thinner than I'd choose. I will definitely make this again though, and next time possibly take earlier reviewers advice and add some potato with the pureed vegetables to thicken it up a bit.

I made this soup this weekend after having seen it as the "recipe of the day" last week. It was simply excellent and must be pretty healthy as well. I added celery as many suggested, but did not change anything else. I ate it the day after making it and very visually appealing.

There was a time, not too long ago, that putting together this delightful soup would have been an enjoyable evening pastime. Since the birth of my daughter, cooking weekday meals has become a bit more chaotic, and the phrase "Too busy to cook" has taken on a whole new meaning. It took me about an hour, start to finish, to put this beautiful soup on the table. It was definitely worth the time and effort. I chopped the onions and the carrots finely in the food processor, but I cubed the chicken by hand. The bits of chicken were juicy, rather like little dumplings. The final texture and look of the soup was very appealing and rather elegant, but still hearty enough for a main course.

This soup is fantastic and flavorful! It's not difficult, but is definitely a crowd-pleaser. It keeps very well in the fridge and is even better after chilling and re-heating.

One of the best soups I have made! My whole family loves it (even the picky eaters). I do not use all the spices, just the curry (and salt/pepper) and I use a tsp. each of red and yellow curry powder. I add lots of celery and sometimes yukon gold potatoes at the end. Easy recipe to double.

A keeper for sure, says my husband. Daughter and pickey son said "excellent". I used the chicken breasts and didn't have cilantro. Also added diced potatoes and a bit of celery. Next time will add some garlic. There were four of us and I wish I had doubled the receipe so there could have been leftovers!

I doubled the curry and added some ground New Mexican red chile for good measure. I pureed all of the carrot and onion mixture. Good stuff.

YUMMY! I combined suggestions from other cooks' reviews and it was so easy. I used chicken breasts instead of thighs, omitted the cardamom and cilantro, added some minced garlic, added extra curry powder and corriander. Also added potatoes and celery to soup while simmering. My husband is pretty picky and he says this one is definitely a keeper!

This soup was fantastic! I used two different curries. I used a hot Indian curry and a sweet Malaysian curry. I also added one cup extra of water and one cup of chicken broth. People went wild over this soup. I'd definitely make it again, in fact I think I'll make a batch today.

M'mmm Goood... Wonderful aroma made my mouth water while preparing this soup... and I wasn't disappointed upon tasting. And I'm making it again today! I added a little tumeric to jazz up the color, but the taste isn't lacking without it. I like a little cauliflower, potato and celery thrown in as well.

Exellent. For deeper flavour I added 12 cloves of Garlic. My partner took leftovers for lunch to her job and I had already two requests for recipe. Congratulations to its creator.
