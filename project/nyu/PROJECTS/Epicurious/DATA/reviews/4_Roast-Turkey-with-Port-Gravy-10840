I made the port gravy today with a roast turkey I made for my husband to take to his office party. The gravy was outstanding! I will make this again!

This is the best gravy recipe! I've made it the last two years. I use a different stuffing but I follow this for roasting and gravy. I brine my turkey but don't find the gravy at all salty. I do cut down the lemon juice to 1-1/2 tablespoons and the broth to 3 cups. Fabulous!

This is my favourite turkey and gravy recipe. I use my own stuffing for this but follow the instructions for cooking everything else. This gravy is the ABSOLUTE best in the world, hands down. I'm not normally a gravy person but I could drink this down by the cup!

Excellent! I brined the turkey, so the gravy was a bit salty. Next time I will use unsalted chicken broth

I made this recipe for the first time this Christmas for a group of 15 people and recieved rave reviews. I made quite a few amazing side dishes, but the gravy seemed to be the favorite thing. Rather than using butter, I rubbed the turkey with olive oil and a rub consisting of fresh herbs (sage, savory and thyme) and 15 cloves of garlic all finely chopped in the food processor. I learned this year that the key to roasting turkey is to roast it on a rack (from a cook shop) upside down sitting above the broil pan (then you can roast potatoes, or carrots, or have room for your gravy). Also, this way the fat drips into the stuffing and makes it extremely moist and you do not need to baste the bird AT ALL throughout the entire cooking process. You only need to wrap the fat and leaner parts with foil and tent the belly. You also need to tie the wings with some kitchen twine. As I had limited room in the oven, I cooked the reserve stuffing on the bbq, basting it with juice from the turkey and it turned out excellent. This stuffing is by far the best I have ever tasted. The left over stuffing went very quickly. The turkey looked like it should be on the cover of a magazine. This is well worth the effort and will be my traditional turkey recipe from here on. We used a cheap tawny port and it turned out beautifully.

This has been my T-day dinner the last 3 years and it has been wonderful every time. I do substitute a 1/2c port for some water to the turkey while its cooking and 2T each of fresh Thyme and Rosemary into the butter that is spread on the turkey for more flavor, but otherwise devine.

Excellent gravy! I have been struggling for years to find the perfect gravy recipe. It's easy, and full of flavor. Everyone Loved it. I did use chicken broth (instead of turkey giblet stock). I bought an expensive tawny port, because I figured it would have good flavour.

This recipe makes the most delicious gravy! My husband and I have made this for the past 2 Thanksgiving dinners and our family will NOT let us do anything else!!! My answer to 'would you make this dish again' is a resounding yes.

I made the turkey and gravy only. Turkey was good but the gravy was outstanding. Gravy was thick, rich and delicious!

This gravy was great. I doubled it and sort of messed up the thickness by not doing the roux properly. HOWEVER, it tasted wonderful. I will make this again and follow the directions better. This is a keeper.

I used this recipe for the gravy only and was delighted by the earthy flavor created by the port deglazing process. My guests were quite impressed!!! This recipe is a keeper for the holiday season. I must not fail to mention how easy it was as well. One note, perhaps because of Denver's altitude, I did have to simmer this for about 3 times as long as recommended to acquire the desired thickness and depth.

I made this with a turkey breast, and it was to die for!! Excellent choice for a diner party.

The very best turkey gravy we've ever had (and we don't usually like gravy at all). I used the "dried fruit stuffing" instead of the "potato, apple and prune stuffing". The guests were impressed.

Fantastic gravy!! The turkey was beautifully browned. Served with a bread stuffing with apples and cranberries which complemented the turkey and gravy very nicely. I am already looking forward to next thanksgiving so that I can make this again.

Oh my, was this delicious. Call me extravagent, but I used a 1970 Taylor vintage port to make this recipe, and was in heaven. Guest could not stop raving about this recipe. For a very good, more economical version, use Six Grapes or Warre's Warrior vintage type port.

This, together with the stuffing, is the receipe I have been searching for, ever since I Lost my copy of Gourmet. Excellent stuffing and gravy, used it 3 times and am glad to have found it on the web.

This is fabulous! The juiciest, loveliest turkey. I basted the turkey with some of the port while cooking, which gave it a lovely golden color, and tucked sprigs of thyme under the skin of the breast. My husband and guests raved!

I've made the turkey and the gravy (it would be a sin to not use my Mother's stuffing recipe... or so she tells me). The port wine gravy is to die for, people can't rave enough about it. The turkey is moist and tasty, but if it weren't for that port wine gravy, I'd give it 3 forks.

My wife and I have been making this recipe, sometimes more than once a year, since it first appeared in Gourmet back in '94 (that issue of the magazine has long since fallen apart...thank God for the Web!) often adding cider to the basting juices for added flavor. The gravy and stuffing are absolutely the best -- rich and full of complex flavors. If you have a full fruity red like a strong Pinot Noir or good Grenache and Syrah blend that you want to serve with Turkey, this stuffing and gravy combination is just the thing to bring it together.
