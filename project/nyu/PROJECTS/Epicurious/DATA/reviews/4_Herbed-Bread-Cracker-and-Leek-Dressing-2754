I'm updating my review from 2001 b'c I've made it every year since! This is an incredibly savory stuffing! Aside from a tasty, albeit heavy, cornbread-sausage stuffing with apples, this one is the most flavorful stuffing I've ever tasted or made. With its liberal use of herbs and crackers it's easy to imagine that this is the kind of stuffing early settlers in North America may have prepared in their rustic kitchens. My only change to the recipe (every time I make it) is to add a bit more liquid before baking the bit outside of the turkey.

I have made this stuffing every year and everyone just adores it. I like to mix sourdough bread in with the white bread and I add a nice selection of wild mushrooms to the pan at the tail end of the leek and onion sate. I also strain a bit of the liquid that the dried porcini mushrooms were soaking in and add it to the stuffing with the chicken broth. Delicious!

The BEST EVER. I only used 1 leek and used vege stock instead of chicken because my daughter is a vege. I never even liked stuffing before but this year it was my favorite part of Thanksgiving dinner!! You gotta try it!

I made this dish last year for 45 of my finicky family members, and received rave reviews! Absolutely delicious, and so moist. Served it with HERB-ROASTED TURKEY WITH SHALLOT PAN GRAVY. TDF.

This has become a family tradition and I have used it with chicken also! Wouldn't go back to the old recipe!

This has now become my Thanksgiving stuffing recipe that I whip out each year. It makes a ton of stuffing, and it's great for vegetarians, too. The flavors are strong, but truly great.

This has become an annual tradition in my Thanksgiving meal since it came out in 1996. I haven't been very creative in coming up with my own version of the suggested recipe since it has been such a crowd pleaser. The only negative reactions I have had with this recipe is when I suggest trying a different one.

I make this dressing every year but I do add 3/4 lb mild sausage, a tart apple and 3/4 cup dried cherries. These items absorb some of the herbs and add a wonderful consistency to the dish.

This was my first attempt at dressing from scratch. I usually just "doctor" a box of Stove Top. I wasn't exactly sure what kind of bread to use, so I used an italian bread from the bakery. The recipe was really easy to follow & turned out wonderfully! I baked mine outside the bird, as I didn't want it too soggy. Turned out great!! the top was crunchy, and the inside was really moist. A perfect combination! Will definitely make this again. :-)

it was easy to make. but i think it had way to many herbs. i should of read the other reviews about reducing the herbs.

This dressing has been a staple at our Thanksgiving table for four years now. I don't think I could switch without a riot! I make it the day before and don't change a thing. Delicious in or out of the bird.

Fantastic and easy to make - very flavourful. Found that the dressing baking in the side dish had better consistency than the dressing from inside the turkey (kinda mushy). I think I may have stuffed the dressing to tightly...

This was really good! I made it with the maple glazed turkey, and found that the stuffing IN the bird was perfectly moist, but the stuffing in the roasting dish was too dry. Next time I'll add more chicken broth to the remainder after scooping some into the bird. I liked the leeks (never had dressing with leek before), but think it would help me to know HOW MUCH leek, as in "1 cup" or whatever, rather than just "3 leeks," because I didn't know whether I had enough or too much. I had one leek that was bigger than the other two, and didn't know whether I had 1 average one and two small ones, or two average ones and one huge one...sounds silly, I know, but when preparing a meal for people you've never cooked for before, this is a big deal! :-)

Stuffing was very good- but slightly mushy. It may have been because I made it a day ahead. I might use one less leek next time. Couldn't find any savory but used all the other ingredients. Fairly easy and MUCH better than using bagged croutons.

Great stuffing -- rave reviews. Do not omit any of the herbs. I used 3 onions instead of 2, and it turned out very very well. I will definitely make this stuffing again, with or without turkey. (The turkey recipe accompanying this stuffing is excellent as well.) Definitely a recipe to keep and pass on.

The stuffing was good but not great. I didn't have any savory or parsley so these were omitted. Perhaps that's what was missing. I'm going to keep searching for another recipe.

This is a great stuffing. My family loves it and always has lots of praise. A magical pairing with the maple roasted turkey.

I've made this dressing a few times now, and it always gets rave reviews. Definitely a keeper!

The best stuffing I've ever created. Prepared this for Canadian Thanksgiving and it was superb!! I sub'd the milk for chicken broth.

My favorite stuffing recipe of all time. It's great...I use good old Premium saltines and it comes out terrific!!!

This was a great stuffing. I have made the recipe twice and used the recommended herb mix and found it was not overpowering (hey, this is California and people are used to strong herb flavors). I did, however, make my own crackers and add a bit more liquid than called for. I think the result was better than if I had used saltines...

We really loved this dressing. I took the advice of a previous cook and halved the amount of herbs, and left out the sage. It was wonderful.

This tasted better before it was cooked. I think the amount of herbs should be reduced; they were overpowering. Next time I'll reduce by half and with gravy poured over it, it should be perfect.
