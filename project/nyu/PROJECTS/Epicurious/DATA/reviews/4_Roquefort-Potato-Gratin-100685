Greatest. Potato Recipe. Ever. Every time I make it, it gets rave reviews and eaten up! Very hard to mess up. I don't bother peeling the potatoes...and a mandoline makes super-quick work of slicing.

These are so creamy and yummy. I made a couple variations to the recipe. I added a couple cloves of minced garlic and I substituted the Roquefort for plain old blue cheese but it was still excellent.

The first Potato Gratin I've ever made, and I think it may be the only one. Made with fried breaded chicken breasts & a green bean & blood orange salad (from the Dec. 2009 food&wine). Terrific Sunday dinner combo!

Loved this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly except that my casserole baking dish was made of glass and I couldn't broil it in the end. The top wasn't crispy brown, but it didn't stop anyone from giving raving reviews at our Easter brunch. :)

Oops, I meant I used FRESH rosemary.

This was easy and a big hit, even with the picky kids. The only change I made was to use rosemary. Also, maybe my oven is running hot but I almost burnt it using the time specified.

Terrific! I was initially concerned about the strong flavor of Roquefort: don't be with this recipe. Flavor after cooking is to die for; mild, and leaves you wanting more of the taste even when full. I've had to use Gorgonzola or blue cheese and I now double the amount if I need to substitute. Perfect. This is my go-to potato gratin recipe; until I find a better one - and I've been looking for a long time. Almost decadent. So tasty. Make this one at least once. If you like gratin potatoes, you won't be sorry. It is also easy to make.

I used fresh rosemary and home-made breadcrumbs from a sourdough baguette. It was divine!! I'm always trying new potato gratins and this is the best by far to date.

Get out your mandoline and make this! So easy, so good and everyone loves it!

Whenever people bring potatoes to family dinners, it usually has cheddar cheese. This is a big change and a very welcome change. I think I found a new potato staple.

Absolutely delicious!! I used russet potatoes and gorgonzola cheese and it was just delightful.

As everyone has said, this dish is FABULOUS! I made it with yukon gold potatoes and gorgonzola crumbles since this is what I had on hand. I don't think I would make it if I didn't have a mandolin slicer--it makes the potatoes cook evenly and is so much easier. I'm looking forward to trying a less high-fat version, maybe with whole milk...

This is wonderful with garlic/rosemary lamb or barbequed steaks with grilled onions. Can be baked several hours ahead and refrigerated. Reserve the crumbs. Reheat in oven until hot, then add the crumb mixture and broil as noted. One of our favorite potato recipes although we have yet to get the salt just right. I agree that it's closer to 15 servings.

Fabbo and so simple. The blue cheese taste (and this is with good quality blue cheese) is very subtle but nice. When I make it again for strictly "blue cheese lovers," I plan on doubling the amount of blue cheese. We did 1/2 recipe in an 11x7x2 and all amounts and cooking times worked out perfectly. Only change was that I just browned my bread crumbs on the stove top so did not have to mess with broiling.

i have made this several times...it is rather heavy however. it really feeds about 15-17 servings, due to the heavyness. it is great however with a roasted prime rib.

I made this for an office Christmas luncheon. It was delicious! A great alternative to a traditional potato casserole! I used regular blue cheese instead of roquefort and it was delicious. So easy! The hardest part is slicing the potatoes. For a smaller crowd I would consider halfing the recipe. It makes a huge casserole! Enjoy!

I just had a gourmet party this weekend and I made these as my main side dish. I did not change a thing in the recipe, and I received rave reviews!! Delicious!

I used twice as much cheese as called for. I thought it was really good the day it was made, but when reheated, it was just greasy and kinda gross. I'd make it again, but I'd only make enough for one meal. I thought the breadcrumbs were good, too.

So easy and SO tasty! I used 2 tablespoons fresh minced rosemary instead of dried, and it was absolutely delicious!

Excellent dish! I only used about 4 lbs. of potatoes, same amount of cream, doubled the cheese (used Gorgonzola because I like it), and kept everything else the same. Served with blackened steaks; the potatoes came out great, and my guests said it was a "keeper".

I think I've found my new favorite potatoe dish. I made it pretty much as as, but can see that it would lend itself to infinite variations.

This was very good - needed to bake longer than indicated. I added extra cheese, and some chopped sundried tomatoes which went very well.

Excellent! A keeper. I used bleu cheese and doubled the amount. Easy to do and delicious.

This dish was outstanding and so easy to prepare -- especially when you need idle time to be preparing a main course. I've made it twice for dinner parties and everyone requested additional servings. The second time I made it, I used nearly twice the listed amount of roquefort and it added a little more blue cheese taste without being the least bit overpowering.

Rating: 3
Very yummy. The roquefort cheese is not overpowering. I served it with pork tenderloin but I can see where it would be awesome with a beef dish. The prep was a cinch. We'll definitely be adding it to our recipe book.

Very tasty with anything grilled! I still prefer my wife over any potato gratin, unlike the cook from florida who claimed she liked it better than her husband...

This is the best potato gratin--ever. The sharpness of the Roquefort is the perfect dressing of the potatoes. I never make any other potato gratin after making this. My guests always rave.

As someone who has never been particularly stimulated by gratins, this changed my mind. I used gorgonzola instead of roquefort (gorgonzola, roquefort, bleu cheese...all similar enough), and I omitted the bread crumbs and butter over the top. I think that next time I make this I will use less whipping cream. It was a little soupy, even after more that an hour in the oven. I served it alongside pan-seared tuna steaks, sauteed grean beans and salad. It was a very impressive Valentine's meal. I don't usually co-mingle potatoes and fish unless it is one great big decadent pile of fried fish and chips. But this was great. Old dogs can learn new tricks!

My wife and I loved this recipe, but I didn't quite follow it exactly. I used mostly Camembert cheese (and I used ~1.5 times as much as the recipe requires), and I even supplemented the overdose of cheese with some small bits of Cambozola and Emmenthal. No, there weren't any Roquefort leftovers in the cheese drawer. Anyway, it turned out fantastic! My wife has declared this her runaway favourite recipe for potatoes. As a note, the switch to Camembert may have made the meal "cheesier". (Actually, before it was cooked, it smelled SO strong I was questioning my recipe choice).

My husband and guests pronounced this dish delicious with a Christmas rib roast. I did take the advice to add more bleu cheese. The rest of the recipe was easy and worth the calories! A definite repeat for company.

After looking at some of the comments, I decided to alter this recipe slightly (I also cut it dow since I was only serving 6). Instead of potato slices, I used hash brown potato shreads. I also added extra roquefort. My guests raved all night about my meal. I served this with individual beef wellingtons made with 5 oz. filet mignon and steamed asparagus tossed in a seasame seed oil, soy sauce, fresh ginger and garlic. Loved it and will definetely make again.

Delicious recipe. I used extra Roquefort and it was very tasty. The breadcrumbs brown quickly-within 2 min-under the broiler and I almost let it burn on accident, so watch it. Very simple too. We had this as a side with bourbon glazed pork chops and it was a fabulous meal.

Very rich and creamy texture, but somewhat disappointed in the lack of cheese taste. My guests swore there was no cheese in the recipe. Next time I'll sprinkle an extra 1/4 cup blue cheese on top for the last few minutes of cooking.

This is a wonderfully flavorful dish to accompany lamb or beef! Easy,straight forward, and not overpowering. I used an Amish blue cheese, slightly less butter, and slightly more breadcrumbs. My non-blue/roquefort cheese guests enjoyed this side dish too.

Excellent.

This recipe had a nice flavor, but was way too oily for my husband's and my taste even though I substituted milk for the cream and cut the butter in half. I used 4 pounds of potatoes and kept the cheese/milk as written in the recipe. The amounts worked out perfectly this way. I may try it again with skim milk to see if I can keep the flavor, but lose the grease.

Excellent- got rave reviews- will go with almost any meat ....great for entertaining!

I made a quarter of the portion and used a dolce gorgonzola. It was slightly tangy, I may use a gorgonzola next time. The recipe was easy and fullproof.

This has just become my new favorite dish for a quick and very different potato side. The flavors are so rich and smooth- it is a pleasant new twist to serve with steaks- perfect for guests when they expect the usual and are surprised by the distinctly original flavor! Many who have protested the taste of Blue Cheese have succumbed to this dish without knowing the "secret ingredient". Although [so far] I've only made it a few times, it has always gotten many "ohhs and ahhs"! The best compliment: "I must have that recipe!"

This turned out great!! And it was easy to make, too. I read the first review of this recipe and decided to increase the cheese and cream measurements by 50%. It was a little too much and it boiled over in the oven. But the result was luscious and creamy. Also, I sliced the potatoes a little thinner than 1/8 inch and they came out really nice and soft (as opposed to firm). I used Parmeasan flavored bread crumbs. I love this dish.

If you like blue cheese this is safisticated change from potatoes make with american cheese or kraft cheese I kept the skins on the potatoes and par boiled, drained and placed in baking dish, added sauce and finished cooking. Removed potatoes to serving dish then put bread crumbs on and browned. Took this to a party and everyone enjoyed. Thanks Need to make more cheese sauce for this recipe next time yum yum

I replaced the bread crumbs with parmesan and added it along with the butter before baking. I deleted the rosemary altogether. I used Gorganzola instead of the Roquefort cheese. I took the foil off for about 15 minutes before serving. THIS IS THE BEST POTATO RECIPE I HAVE EVER EATEN. RICH, RICH, RICH!!!!!!
