I tried to edit my earlier review, but no go. Anyway, the recipe does say to finish the fried fish in the oven, but on reexamination, the use of a total of 1/2 cup of oil for two servings of fish still boggles my mind. That's 8 T of oil at about 120 calories per T; or about 480 oil calories per person. Why not just oven fry the fish with the coconut coating? Is the remaining oil really critical to the sauce? I like the idea of the underlying flavors, but I'm mystified by the cooking technique's reliance on lots of added oil that usually undermines subtler flavors.

The recipe continues to show up very oddly on line -- the sauce directions show up three times, and there is a brief reference to turning the oven to 450, but then, frying the coconut crusted fish, and the oven is not used at all. I also find the use of olive oil for frying coconut crusted fish off-putting. I can't figure this one out to even begin. This dish appears to have a lot of fat -- a total of at least 6 tablespoons of oil divided between two people, plus coconut, which is high fat.

I only made the fish without the sauce. Used Ocean Perch rather than Mahimahi, and it was fantastic!

This is a very nice, light and quick meal. My wife and I cooked it tonight and were surprised by the results. We served the sauce and the fish seperately so that the coconut crust would not become soggy. The coconut adds such a nice, "Lightly there" after taste that compliments the tangy sauce perfectly. This would be the perfect dish to serve on a nice evening outside with a white wine. We served with a fresh made Bruschetta and a Rhubarb crumble for dessert and it went perfect. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this for my fiance and we quite enjoyed it. He was a bigger fan of the salsa stuff, I'm more simplistic and could have done with just the coconut and the fish. I'm making it again and will try the mango and basil.

Coconut on the fish had great texture and flavor, and could make the mahi the base of a really simple, fantastic recipe. But this ain't it. I took another reviewer's advice and substituted mango and basil for hte tomato and rosemary, but this dish still needs another couple layers of flavor, probably including lime.

Recipe was ok, however, at the time I'm writing this, the recipe is messed up. How to make the sauce is repeated 3x for example. Likely a computer glitch. Otherwise, not bad but a bit bland I found. I was really hoping the coconut flavour stood out more.

I liked the flavors, especially the sweetness of the coconut and the tart of the herbs and tomatoes. What I didn't like was the steps that were involved in making the fish. To me, the marinade step can be skipped. It didn't add to the flavor. Also, dredge all the pieces before you move on to the egg wash, then do all the egg coating before you move on to the coconut. Otherwise, all your coconut ends up on your fingertips rather than your fish. I would quickly make the sauce as the fish is in the oven to save time. All in all, good flavor but too many steps to get there.

I really loved the fresh tomato sauce. The flavors married well with the sweetness of the coconut.Very light and fresh. I served the sauce over the fish which softened the cocount crust. Next time I would put the fish on top of the sauce. Very fast and easy to make.

My family loved this recipe. I made it using all fresh herbs and it turned out better than expected. I loved the way the sweet in the coconut blended so well with the Rosemary,garlic and tomato. I used a little more Rosemary than called for.... The presentation was wonderful.

To be honest, I wouldn't give this recipe one fork, but I did like the coconut on the fish. The tomato sauce was completely out of place in this dish. If I were to make this again, I would substitute mango for the tomato and basil or lemongrass for the rosemary (sooo wrong for the fish). I cook from this site all the time, with wonderful results, this, however, was a waste of some perfectly wonderful mahimahi.
