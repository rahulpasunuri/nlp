While you can't go wrong with fresh, tasty nectarines, the texture of the ricotta was awful.

The ricotta-vanilla cream had an unpleasant texture and was not that tasty. Both my husband and I through ours out. I will not make the recipe again but the pine nut brittle was excellent and I might use that in a different dessert.

easy to make and so good. my caramel took a good 30 minutes of boiling before it became amber. i didn't have mint but it was delicious anyway.

This is one of the most delicious summer dessert. I made extra of the ricotta mixture to use the next day and used a mixture of stone fruits. Pine nuts are a little too expensive in my area so used almonds. Everything turned out great. Two thumbs up on this one.
