Perfect. Just the right combination of crunch (toasted and good bread), sweet and savory. I splurged: Very good bread, real serrano and good cheese.

Simple...delicious. I used arugula, too, but added it after we put the sandwiches under the broiler for a minute or two. Instead of fig jam, we made fig confit from another epicurious recipe. Yum!

Made this last night to take to a Ladies Night In. This was fantastic and has been added to my cocktail nibble repertoire. I followed previous suggestions and added some baby arugula dressed with evoo, kosher salt and cracked black pepper. Also cut the baguette into crostini and toasted well, they stayed crunchy all night. Used an imported Irish butter rather than supermarket brand and used fig preserves. Next time I'll slather the fig butter on even more generously. They were so delicious.

Needed something quick and easy for a party. People freaked out about them. Will definitely make them again.

First made these when my dad sent me some of his homemade fig preserves. Have long used up that jar & have gone through many a store-bought jar. Always a hit!

did not enjoy this excepyt for the fig butter which i will use in other recipes for sure. too salty for me because off the meat so it would seem a matter of taste.

I, too, prepared this an an appetizer. Toasted baguette slices and then added the butter/fig spread, pepper, prosciutto, then shaved manchego. I skipped the olive oil. It was a big hit, and my 10 year old daughter is begging for the sandwich in her lunchbox. Delicious and very easy!

This is THE BEST. It's one of my new favorite things to eat. I love to cook and am more than willing to spend a whole day cooking- but this proves that some of the best foods are the simple ones. Use a really good bread. AMAZING!!

Wow, I'm a believer. I made these for my son's 4th birthday party one afternoon, and they were gobbled up by all the grownups--and the kids, too. Next time I will add something sharp and green, as other reviewers have suggested. But as they are--easy and delish.

These are fantastic! They're easy yet seem like you've done way more. The fig butter is the key and finding the right fig jam/preserves makes a lot of difference. I use prosciutto since it's a little more accessible and inexpensive than serrano (yet, it's hard to beat serrano) and toss arugula leaves in some olive oil for a touch of color and texture. People go nuts for these - definitely a party staple or a great friday night snack

Great. Made for a huge cocktail party. Good for do-ahead. Quite pretty. For leftovers, I warmed slightly in the oven - they were jsut as good that way.

I needed to make this fantastic recipe ahead of time and transport it to a large cocktail party. Used crispy black pepper flatbread (croccantini from La Panzanella bakery)and followed the recipe,but deleted the olive oil,and added the arugula as suggested by others.The flatbread stayed crisp,the presentation was great, and this got rave reviews.Served it with a good Rioja.Will definitely make it again!

I followed the directions except for using a fresh baked baquette and did not toast the slices. I thought this was merely good enough (I certainly ate it) but nothing outstanding.

This is the easiest appetizer to make. I cut the baguette lengthwise in half, toasted it, and then cut it into bite size. Then I pretty much followed the recipe, added some baby arugula and sprinkled some ground pepper on top as well. It was absolutely a hit. Can't wait to make it again!

This was such a hit at Thanksgiving. I cut the baguette into smaller, bite size pieces, added arugula on the top. The sweetness of fig butter and the saltiness of the ham and cheese complement each other extremely well.

Made this as an appetizer to pass at Garden Club. Used toasted baguette slices with very thin coating of butter to keep toasts crisp then spread with fig preserves, topped with prosciutto and shaved Mancheco cheese. Got rave reviews!

The ease and speed of this recipe is amazing, given the fabulous flavor it produces! I have made it 3 times, first with manchego, then with freshly grated parmesan, then with freshly grated gruyere. The second time I added arugula, which was also nice. The first two were my favorites. Also, I have found that chopping the proscuitto (vs. tearing it) results in less of the bruschetta stringing and dripping down guests' fronts. This is a keeper for the make-it-quickly-but-impress-everyone file.

I tried this with Serrano ham, and found the flavor a bit overpowering. I added black and white pepper and more fig preserves to the butter to try and balance out the flavors, but it still wasn't what I would call 'harmonious'. I'll make it again, but next time I'll use prosciutto.

This was a big hit in our house. I made them on toasted pitas and my family gobbled them up. I will certainly make it again as an appetizer for a cocktail party-- lovely presentation. I also added rocket lettuce and mixed fresh figs and apricot jam with the butter.

I was looking for something easy and substantial to take to cocktails with friends. I had prosciutto on hand so I decided to try this recipe. It was great! A few alterations were made to this recipe.I added a little bit of baby arugula after spreading on the butter/fig mixture ,put cracked pepper on the ham, cut the bread into 3" pieces and arranged them on the platter and then shaved the cheese on, deleted the olive oil. Nice presentation. The plate was cleaned! The salty/sweet flavor worked well with the range of drinks and it was easy to pick up and eat while conversing.

I've made this for a couple of parties, and they have always gotten rave reviews. Beautiful, classy presentation with little effort. I couldn't find fig preserves or jam, so subtituted apricot instead, turned our great each time.

This was elegant and delicious! I made two different butters - one with the mentioned fig preserves and another with apricot preserves. Both are equally delightful. (The apricot butter was a tad sweeter than that of the fig.) And it's so easy to make that it's going to be added to my work lunch rotation.

This recipe is insanely easy to follow. I made it tonight and my boyfriend professed his undying love. His friends are all jealous, too. Thank you epicurious!!!

I couldn't find fig preserves or jam, so had to substitute apricot. Turned out fantastic. Served as an app at a party and got rave reviews. VERY quick and easy to make.

The fig and butter are an easy taste . . . I tried just the preserves as well and did prefer a butter/preserve mixture. It is an exquisite sandwich . . . served on a picnic by the sea.

This is a great mix of flavors. I chose proscuitto, as it was more readily available. Easy and very yummy! My company loved it, too!
