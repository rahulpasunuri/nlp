So good! Easy recipe, had all of the ingredients on hand. I followed the recipe exactly. It was perfect. Wonderful chocolate taste, and the consistency was creamy and smooth, not too runny or thick, just right. My 5 year old daughter loved it too. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips.

For whatever reason I just didn't love this recipe. Too thick and lacking in taste - maybe it's the combination of chocolate and cocoa? I love mousse made with chocolate (no cocoa) and heavy cream or chocolate pudding made with cocoa (no chocolate).

Thick and creamy pudding. Served it with a little milk poured over the top, just like mom used to do. I made a few changes... I used 1% milk instead of cream, and also added a little instant espresso, ground cinnamon and chili pepper powder to the dry ingredients before I added in the milk. I only used 2 oz chocolate and it was plenty chocolate-y and sweet.

The flavor of this pudding was good, but the texture was horrible. 3 tablespoons of cornstarch is entirely too much - if I make this again, I'll decrease that by at least 1T. If made as written, this pudding is much too firm.

used a little less sugar and 1% milk instead of cream- yum!

Okay to all you (pardon me while I wipe off the chocolate tracks from my keyboard...!) nay-sayers! This recipe rocks! and the most delicious chocolate party in my mouth in a long time! I couldn't wait til it completely cooled off and man, what could be better than that???? O and I used SOYMILK! That's right and it is YUMMERS! I'll leave you now so I can continue my chocolate orgy!

Okay, it may not have gourmet pizzaz, it is just pudding after all, but considering how easy it is make, the fact you probably have all the ingredients on hand, and the wonderful taste, it gets 4 forks. I make this with 2% milk and it is still great.

Made this exactly as written...whoops, except I used whole milk instead of cream. I thought it was very, very good. It didn't have the "gourmet pizzazz" that I prefer in a dessert (perhaps it would, if I used the cream) but I would definitely make it again. In fact, I am actually switching (from a chocolate custard recipe I use as a cake filling) to this one due to its simply delicious taste, which I know will have a broad appeal. Husband loved it.

This is a really great pudding recipe with just a couple of revisions. I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/3 C and also reduced the amount of cornstarch to 1.5 Tbsp. When I tried using 2 Tbsp of cornstarch, it just seemed a little too firm to me. I also really love how you can use light cream, whole milk, 2% or even non-fat milk, and it's still delicious.

All I had was unsweetened chocolate, so I increased the sugar to 1 c., which seemed just right. I also avoid cornstarch so I substituted arrowroot, and only used 2 T., which was perfect while the puddings were still room temperature; when they had been refrigerated they were still way too thick. But the flavor was outstanding, and the recipe sooo easy to make. I will probably make this one again-- maybe just add a bit more milk.

after trying other chocolate puddings on this site, I've landed on this one, made with low-fat milk and 1/2 c. sugar, to be our "everyday" favorite. this version is creamy and chocolatey enough without too much guilt. I used Dutch processed cocoa, Ghiradelli 60% bittersweet and organic cane sugar. Yes, it's better with 1/2 and 1/2 but very satisfying even with 1% milk.

After adding the chocolate, the pudding curdled and separated and the oil from the chocolate floated around the top and sides. It was a really hot day (95 degrees) and the chocolate was some great baking chocolate I buy in Italy (Majani), so maybe the chocolate has different properties or maybe the kitchen was just too hot. However, happy ending, because when I put it in the fridge the oil hardened (ewww!) but was then easily mixed into the pudding again and no one noticed. It was really chocolatey and everyone loved it, but I sort of felt like I was serving a can of Duncan Hines frosting. It was a bit tooooo much. I added white chocolate-dipped raspberries (sooo easy to make) and they cut the chocolatey-ness a bit and classed up the dish somewhat.

My 8-year-old son and I whipped this up in about 15 minutes, incorporating a few reviewer's suggestions. We reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, used only 2 tablespoons of cornstarch, and used milk instead of cream. It was easy and so delicious. We'll make it again and again.

I forgot to mention that we made this dessert with 1% milk instead of the cream. The lower fat alternative wasn't readily apparent in the result, so really, there's no reason to use the cream.

Added 3 T Chambord, maybe a little (1/4 c?) more grated chocolate. Oooooo yum! Now -- imagine this with a raspberry sauce, maybe enclosed in a nice butter crust w whipped cream....or is that gilding the lily?

This recipe has taught me that something simple can be absolutely decadent! I used this pudding as a layer in a "sex in a pan" type dessert: a cookie&pecan crust, a layer of "old-fashioned butterscotch pudding", a layer of this, and a whipped cream/cream cheese topping..fantastic. This is the best pudding recipe I've encountered.I will make it to have on its own next time.

This is a great recipe for pie fillingrich and thick.Tastes like grandma's. Not too sweet. If your eating instant pudding your missing out. Ya gotta try this one.

This was easy and fantastic! I used 1/2 whipping cream and 1/2 1% milk, as that's what I had...and added grated orange zest to the mixture as it cooked, and a tablespoon of gran marnier instead of vanilla. Wonderful, deep, chocolate orange flavor. Only used 1/2 c sugar.

This pudding is always a crowd pleasers. V ery quick, easy and mostly delicious! My suggest when making this is using just 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of corn starch. 3 Tablespoons is just to thick like jello,not pudding.

This was fantastic, easy to prepare, and received rave reviews from guests. I served the pudding warm which was a nice treat from traditional cold pudding. With the ease of cooking I doubt I will ever make "box pudding" again.

Made it with Chocoalte Silk (soy milk). I also reduced sugar and it was very good. Served with raspberries.

This is delicious! I used this recipe for a gathering where we were supposed to bring our favorite childhood food, and this was the closest to how my mother used to make chocolate pudding. I doubled the recipe by using 2 cups half & half and 2 cups milk, without doubling any of the other ingredients except for the chocolate that's added in the hot pudding, and it was perfect!

Great recipe. I substituted Splenda for the sugar and skim milk with a splash of heavy cream for the light cream. I also decreased the cornstarch to 2 tbsp. Very easy and very good!!

Mmmmmm good. So easy and so full of chocolate goodness. I would agree with others and reduce the sugar (try 1/3 cup) next time and the cornstarch (to 1.5 or 2 teaspoons). Will make again soon.

Good gravy, this is some rich pudding. SO chocolately (good thing I'm a chocoholic) and ridiculously thick. I'd cut back on the cornstarch if I were serving this just as pudding (w/ perhaps a dollops of freshly whipped cream), but I actually used this as a cake filling layer, and it was PERFECT. It really is thick enough to cut w/ a knife, but that's what I was looking for in this case. If you're looking for a pudding that is silky and milk chocolatey in which you can taste actual dairy, this is NOT the recipe you want. However, if you're looking for a pudding that is dense, powerful and intensely chocolately, then this is the one for you.

Oh my gosh this is sooo good. My best freind and I made this while we were on vacation on the coast to kill time as a filling for some pudding puffs. They are wonderful! and the pudding is perfect, I put in the full amount of corn starch since I needed it to be firm and it is quite thick with all the corn starch- Nancy We used bakers german chocolate and it was very good. It was also very chocolatety.-Michelle

If you are a chocolate lover, you will love this recipe - It's VERY dense. I used the 2T corn starch recommendation and still found it to be too thick.

Yum! Yum! Yum! I used 1/2 c. of sugar, and skim milk, as well as 3 small handfuls of decadent chocolate chips. So, a few substitutions, but yummy yummy yummy....and not too fatty either.

Delicious! Worked well with skim milk, too. Used full amount of cornstarch and sugar/chocolate. A keeper.

Good flavor but terrible consistency and a strong skin when chilled for a few hours as directed. It could have been cut with a knife...try less cornstarch or a different recipe!

This recipe "elevates chocolate pudding to a new level" was what one of the guests at a party told me upon sampling the pudding. Was wonderfully simple and very quick. I received several requests for this recipe and will definitely be making it again.

The second time I made this, I added a table spoon of Cognac into the milk and the result was a flavor reminiscent of the best Swiss chocolates.

Very delicious and easy to make! I also used 1 c heavy cream and 1 c 1% milk. Also used about half of the bittersweet chocolate and agree that the recipe doesn't really need it. My kids loved it (and so did I). Will definitely make again!

This was great. Very thick and delicious. I would be very careful at the part when you are stirring the milk and cocoa powder. I added a couple of fresh raspberries on top when I served it chilled. It was a hit!

As per the other reviewers, I cut the cornstarch to 2 tablespoons. I thought it was fine but my family didn't think it was thick enough. Next time I'll try it with the 3T that is calls for. I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup 1% milk. It came out fine. The only changes I would make would be to leave out the semi sweet choco. It really isn't necessary and the pudding is a tad too sweet with it.

Rating: 4
absolutely sinful. reduced cornstarch and added more skim milk for a thinner consistency, but making it as written would make for a delicious filling to a layer cake..... maybe for my birthday....

I think that this pudding should be illegal - wow. I used it as a filling for a meringue pie; it actually needed a bit more cornstarch to give it a slightly firmer texture for a pie. I also used fat-free half-and-half. The flavor was awesome, pushing the edge of being almost too chocolatey. I think that reducing the sugar and adding either a little coffee or a bit of cinnamon would not be amiss either . . . lots of opportunities to be creative.

Rating: 3
My 3 and 5 yr olds liked this recipe. It was easy enough for my 5 yr old to help make it. I used just 2 T cornstarch as recommended and the pudding thickened up quite nicely. Only drawback to this recipe is that I found it to be way too sweet...(and I rarely say that!) Next time I'll definitely cut back on the sugar.

Rating: 3
I agree w/ other reviewers- reduce sugar to 1/4-1/3 cup and reduce cornstarch to 1.5- 2 tablespoons. Once it sets, it will be the consistency of yogurt. I used 2% milk and it came out very nice. To give it more depth...I added 2 teaspoons of rasberry flavoring instead of vanilla and 3 tablespoons of instant espresso...IT WAS AWESOME - LIKE A MELTED TRUFFLE !!! I do urge you to use a good cocoa powder like Drost or Ghirardelli. You won't be sorry.

This recipe is a great starting off point for lots of experimentation. I ended up creating an almost inedibly decadent treat by making the following alterations: reduced cornstarch to 2T, used Newman's Own Sweet Orange Dark Chocolate bar instead of the bittersweet chocolate, put in 1/4 c sugar (next time I won't add any, the sweetness from the candybar was enough), used lowfat soymilk (I'm vegan and that's what I had around the house), and added a few drops of orange extract. The result, a ridiculously rich, vegan dark chocolate orange pudding.

A great quick dessert! My kids love it, as well as the adults in the house. If there is any left over, I mix it with some whipped cream to make a quick mousse! Yum! I did reduce the cornstarch as previous reviewers have suggested.

This was very chocolate-y and yummy, but it was too thick from the cornstarch. I agree with others who reduced the cornstarch to 2 tbsp. Some of the chocolate did not melt all the way in mine, but that left extra-good chocolate chunks in the pudding, which I actually prefered.

(Spelling mistakes corrected version) I loved this recipe for it's usability and end result. I substituted soy milk, and although I haven't tried it with milk or cream, carnivores and vegans have asked for more, with the addition of whipped cream for those wanting more.

Very Rich! I only used 2 tbsp of cornstarch and it was still thick enough. The only problem was that it turned out a bit lumpy, but that was probably my fault. Still, much better than pudding-from-a-box!

Wow! This recipe was so good people requested I NOT make it again (they ate every serving)!! I sincerely recommend this recipe to anyone and all who want to make a quick impressive dessert. I topped this with whipped topping and shaved bittersweet chocolate. What a delightful dish! An instant keeper!

Very rich tasting and too easy. This recipe exactly as written makes a very good chocolate pie filling that stays firm and slices perfectly. For pudding I cut back the sugar to 1/3 cup and the corn starch to 2T or it's too thick.

OH MY! Throw your chocolate boxed puddings away! After having this recipe you won't go back! I increased the cream by 3/4 cup. It was dense and rich tasting. I also used Hershey's Special Chocolate for the bittersweet chocolate. I would've used Dove Chocolate but this worked just fine! Will definitely make this again and serve it with fresh whipped cream, and maybe I'll add some Kahula too! YUMMY! And it was so easy, too. This is definitely a KEEPER! You must try it!

Thanks to all the reviewers, I cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup and the cornstarch to 2 T. However, in an effort to avoid dairy products, I substituted two cups of SILK (chocolate soy milk) for the cream and it was wonderful. I did cut the bittersweet chocolate from 3 oz. to 2 oz. I might bump the cornstarch back up a bit since it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked but my husband said it was the best chocolate pudding he ever had!

I agree with the cook from Rio del Mar- next time I try this, I will either cut down on the cornstarch or add more milk/cream. I'm not sure if I'm the only one for whom this happened, but the pudding became er - quite firm . . . reminded me of "flubber" that jello we could hold in our hands when we were kids . . . I would also suggest cutting down on the sugar substantially as others have suggested. Forgive the heresy, but does this taste so different from boxed puddings?

Rating: 4
Oh this was wonderful!! I did use quite a few substitutions though: a very scant 1/3 c of raw suagr, skim milk, and instead of three ounces of chocolate I used five handfuls of ghiradelli chocolate chips. My hands are small so I can't imagine that was a tremendous amount more than called for. Oh and my last substitution was to use two bowls instead of six. Way too much for a 'proper' dessert - but who wants to be proper all the time?

Fantastic!!!! I used bittersweet chocolate and used whole milk instead of light cream, and it came out rich and deeply chocolatey. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is good provided that you reduce the sugar by at least half (I used only 1/4 cup. 3/4 cup is way too much!) Once you mix together the ingredients in the pot, you can taste it and adjust the sweetness before bringing to the boil. I also used semi-sweet chocolate and about 1 2/3 cups whole milk (homogenized)and 1/3 heavy cream. It turned out rich and creamy with a hint of sweetness. Yum!

This just goes to show that all recipes are not "tried and true". Tastewise, the pudding was very rich, and chocolatey, just the way I like it. I sucessfully substituted half and half for the cream to lighten up on the fat content. I would strongly recommend to anyone that attempts this pudding to increase the cream by 1/2 cup, or lessen the cornstarch by 1 tablespoon. Also stay on top with your whisking because this pudding can seize up in a blink of an eye.

Delicious!!! VERY chocolately! Easy to make. I've even used skim milk to replace the cream and it worked very well. A good and easy recipe.
