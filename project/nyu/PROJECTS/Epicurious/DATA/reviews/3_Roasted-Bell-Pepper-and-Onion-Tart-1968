sorry I forgot to specify: by "anchovy" I mean "oil-packed anchovy" and not the fresh fish.

I think what may be missing is a little anchovy melted together with the onions: just add it when the onions are done and stir well until it's melted. Bell pepper+onion+anchovy is a standard pairing in Italian cuisine and it just jazzes up this nice tart. If you have some capers on hand, throw them in, you won't regret it :)

I have to agree with one of the other posts, that while this was good, it was missing something.

This was OK. But just OK. It really needed some thing else. kind of bland.

This is very nice. I roasted the peppers and cooked the onions a couple of days prior to making the tart. This made it much quicker on the day I actually made it, and good for a busy week night.

Delicious and beautiful.

I thought this was delicious. I did make one substitution: I used fat-free half and half instead of whipping cream. It was still yummy, although I had to bake the tart about 15 or so minutes longer. Do try it!
