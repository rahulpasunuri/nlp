I made these for a super bowl party and everyone loved them. I didn't mix the bacon into the cheese mixture. Instead, I put a layer of cheese on, layer of bacon, baked for 5 minutes and then put another layer of cheese over the bacon and put back in the oven for the last 10 minutes. Party pleaser!

Very yummy! I made these for a super bowl party and roughly doubled everything. A few changes I made... reduced oven heat to 375 and baked for 15 minutes. Melted perfectly and reheated nicely as well (I think grating your own cheese is key). Also, didn't oil the sheet before baking and still turned out great. Would definitely make these again.

Great recipe for an appy that will disappear quickly upon serving.

Delicious! Tastes sinful, but they aren't. Could make a meal out of them.

this is good, but do NOT cook it for 25 minutes, that is way too long, my cheese came out a little hard and crisp, which is not what you want. The second time around, I put the cut skins in for 10 minutes, and then added the topping and put it in for 10 more minutes. Turned out amazing!!! crisp skin, gooey cheese, and omg bacon

LOVED this recipe - LOVE Cattleman's!!! My 9yo daughter and I made these and they were awesome. One word of warning: best served immediately. I had to hold dinner over for about 15 minutes and kept these in the oven (which I had turned off) and they were a bit overdone. That didn't stop my family from devouring them, though! Will definitely make again with no changes to the recipe. Enjoy!

I didn't know potato skins could taste so good! The cayenne pepper is key. Also, I substituted pancetta for the bacon. Delicious!!!

We made these in my cooking classes at our elementary school this week, and they were well-received by all (minus the uber-picky eater who doesn't like anything unless it's fast food). I think almost all 10 of my students would give it 4 forks!!

Yum yum! The hubby and I gobbled these up. I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder and that really enhanced the flavor. I also inadvertantly overbaked the potatoes but that was fine - they just had an extra delicious crunch to them. I will be hanging on to this one.

I love potato skins, but have never made them... I thought that the potato part had to be fried -- what a pleasant surprise to find that these abe baked, and DELICIOUS!!!! Without a doubt as good as those in restaurants that are fried, and better b/c they are better for you! Everyone loved them. They were easy, delicious, and I will most definitely make them again!

I love this recipe. I cheat and use Sargento's shredded 4 Cheese Mexican blend (Monterey Jack, Cheddar, Queso Quesadilla and Asadero Cheeses). To save time, I use the pre-cooked bacon. Bake the potatos and put the bacon in the oven while you scoop them out and prepare every thing else. The bacon is perfectly crispy to crumble into the cheese. We don't like sour cream so add guacamole instead. Perfect!

Excellent - a huge hit at our Super Bowl party! The only problem was they went so fast, we have to make another batch quickly!!

These potato skins are better than the restaurants! I added some extra cheese and a sprinkle of bacon after cooked for a more "gormet" look... they are very good. I would highly recommend these potato skins over other recipes. I also added some caramelized onions and it made them even more delectible

Delightful and easy appetizer. doubled the potatoes, bacon, parsley and cayenne as I was afraid of a cheese overload. I thought those proportions were fine

I love these, I've tried making foods similar to these from other recipes but this is the best recipe I've tried so far.

This is 3 and a half forks in my opinion. These are very good potato skins. Recipe is easily doubled. Love the cayenne pepper in them...don't be tempted to skimp on it. The heat is not over the top but it's enough to give it a subtle kick. I substituted the scallions for chives, as I like them much better. They were delicious on them. The shells can be made in advance and filled and baked before serving with no problem. I think the shells benefit with a quick crisping in the oven before filling and baking, but this is by no means necessary. I just prefer a crispier potato skin. I served these with sour cream, salsa and extra chives on the side so that each guest could eat them according to their preferences. They completely devoured the platter! Great recipe!

Good appetizers for New Year's Day football games. They were easy to make and made the house smell great. Used 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper that added only added a slight bit of heat. Served with barbeque sauce. They were gone in seconds.

This is a delicious late night snack...I make it vegetarian using soy bacon bits. It's fairly simple and quick, too.

My kids love these skins. I won't change a thing in the recipe. I make mashed potatoes (with the leftover baked potaoes) the next day.

These are excellent and easy. We will enjoy these often.

The cayenne added a nice kick-heat w/ flavor but not overwhelmingly hot. Will make again for sure, but next time will add more bacon and less cheese (had some cheese leftover).

Very yummy appetizer. Made for a BBQ with 10 kids, 12 adults, thinking this would be something the kids would love. Everyone loved it!! Added more cheese and bacon and green onions. Served sour cream with small spoon in a bowl on platter of skins.

I made this for a 4th of July party, and it was a huge hit! A little bit of time, but relatively easy and very yummy.

I had to substitute the Monterey Jack with other cheeses (emmental, gruyere) as it's only available in the US and I don't much like it anyway. Also, I accidentally added too much cayenne and the skins still turned out great! A very straightforward recipe with excellent results.

I have made these potato skins many times for my family and we have always enjoyed them. Recently I went to a party and decided to bring these as an appetizer and I received three requests for this recipe. Most of the positive comments focused in on the skins having a great "bite" to them (cayenne pepper). Great party food with a small amount of effort!!

I made this last night for friends (I double the recipe) while we watched the hockey playoffs. It was a huge success. My fiancé told me 3 times that night that he really liked it. So, this recipe is a definite keeper.

I had a discusion with my wife about the way to make potato skins, she said that first they had to be emptied raw and then cooked. I am glad I found your recipie and it is exactly the way I thought it would be.Just delicious. Thanks
