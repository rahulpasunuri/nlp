Delicious! And so easy to make. Our family & our friends loved it -- and the kids went back for seconds. Didn't have time to make this a day ahead, so it got only 8 hours to marinate, but that was enough to make it really tasty. We found the skewers made it easier to turn the lamb on the grill. Will be making this again for sure.

I have been making lamb for all of the 35 years I've been married to a wonderful Greek man. We loved this recipe! I will be making this again and again.

Outstanding flavor! I made this for Christmas dinner last year and everyone raved. So now it's in my rotation. Only problem is there is never any leftover because everyone loves it so much. I buy a boneless leg of lamb and butterfly and clean it myself. Getting all the fat and skin off takes longer than I would like. Others posted that they didn't need the skewers. I found them very helpful for keeping the meat in place and compact. Without them, I think it would be very hard to turn over on the grill. Oh, and I trim the ends of the wood skewers so they don't get caught in the grill grates when turning. I wouldn't change a thing - except to buy a bigger leg of lamb!

I am yet to use this exact recipe, however have used this combination as a roast leg and as a butterflied leg many times and is it flawless in flavour and tenderness. Sensational... An for the poster who asked what to do with the left overs (if there were any!) try some cold with a leafy salad.

absolutely awesome! I'm not a big lamb fan but this was excellent....what does one do with the leftovers?

This was quite excellent both times I have had it. I added about a 1/4 cup of dry red to the marinade which I think adds a little depth. I have found that it is not necessary to have this marinade for more than 6-8 hours as I set it out about 1.5 hours before cooking.

This is so good - it's become a family favorite. The recipe is excellent just the way it is, I don't change a thing. The first time I made it, I had it marinading for a couple of days because we were camping. I grilled it over the campfire, and it turned out to be the best lamb we've ever had.

I agree that this recipe is delicious. I did leave the bone in as I love the added flavor. Will make this again for sure!

This recipe was delicious. I cooked it a little longer than recommended, did not use the skewers, and only marinated it for about 5 hours. It turned out great and received compliments from everyone at the table. I will definitely make this a standard dish for dinner parties. Loved it!

I followed the recipe, except I used leg of lamb with a bone. It turned out AWESOME! I actually cooked the meat on my smoker with mesquite wood. This is the third time in my life I've tried lamb; once was at a restaurant, and once was cooked by a friend. The first was gamey and I didn't like it at all, but the other was really good, so I wanted to give it a shot. This recipe definitely elminated any gamey flavor! I highly recommend this recipe and will use it many times more in the future!

I too added the 2 tsp of Dijon mustard and put the lamb on the rotisserie. It was fantastic. I took it off when it was 135 instead of 125. It went up to 140 but was beautifully pink inside. Incredible flavour.

Other reviewers have said it all. Simple, fast, and stands on its on without any need for a sauce. This recipe/marinade does what all marinades should, bring out the good pure flavor of lamb.

This recipe was a solid hit! I made it for a group at a dinner party and everyone raved about it! I followed the recipe but added 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, doubled the garlic, used fresh oregano and cut small slits into the lamb prior to marinating, as recommended by other reviewers. I also omitted the pepper (personal preference). Marinated 24 hours. This lamb was wonderfully flavorful and moist and did not need any additional sauce. Definately a keeper!

excellent! The marinade is wonderful- very simply recipe

I'm making this for the second time tonight. It was so good last time; I know it will be a winner tonight with our guest. My husband grilled this and the flavors were dancing on my tongue. The lemon added something special that I wasn't expecting to taste. We have found a new love for lamb and the recipe didn't disappoint.

Loved this and will make it again many times for sure! I used fresh oregano and added about 2tbl Dijon mustard on another reviewer recommendation because we like Dijon and thought it sounded good and it was. Very simple and VERY good.

YUM! The marinade is excellent! I used it on small boneless lamb chops and only marinated for about 3 hours, and they were delish!

Outstanding! Have made this twice and loved it both times. So simple for such great flavor. No need for sauce or anything else - perfect as is. I'm looking forward to the leftovers!

I'm not a lamb fan personally, but I've made this twice for others and they LOVED it. The ingredients are so simplistic and the results...I have to do it again by special request!

!great. Marinate up to 24 hours in fridge putting slits in lamb to let herb taste soak in....Grill it on high to seal juices it.. then finish on top rack of grill to liking. Slice think with sauce or mint jelly

Have made this twice. I don't bother with the skewers - I fillet the leg of lamb so the thickness is the same and cut it into three portions so it is easier to grill. Served it with Tsiziki (sp?!) and Orzo with Everything (both recipes at this site). Wonderful.

Excellent dish. Very tasting and easy to make. I would definitely make again.

Made this for my California foodie friends -- they were suitably impressed. Did not use the skewers, but otherwise followed the recipe. Would not change a thing!

Made marinade as directed, did not use skewers to grill. Delicious! Would also be good with fresh oregano or rosemary, Served with orzo/artichoke/pine nut salad (from this site) & greek salad. I found the butterflied cut much easier to work with than a boned rolled & tied leg.

Made this dish but substituted boned and skinned turkey thighs for the lamb. Also used fresh oregano from the garden.It was totally delicious and affordable. Served sliced for sandwiches on grilled garlic ciabattas and it was great.

Careful: don't overcook the lamb! And a surprising and delicious accompaniment to this lamb is big crescent slices of a cool, succulent, perfect cantaloupe...au naturel. The flavors and textures compliment each other fantastically. We had it cooked on a simple charcoal grill outside one summer's eve, and there wasn't a morsel of melon or lamb left. Memorable. I didn't use skewers, though, and had no trouble with curling.

No rating because I, too, have not made this, but have made many similiar ones which are very good. Julia Child always put the skewers in, because the kept them from curling and it was easier to turn. I always trusted Julia's methods over the years and never went wrong. She was the best.

I have made the dish but with dijon mustard added. It takes away the "lambiness" that some people dislike. A great crowd pleaser, even with the kids.

I have not made this, but it is similar to one that I do make....suggest that you use more garlic, puncture lamb with a knife and place slivers of garlic in the lamb, add 3/4 cup red wine and replace oregano with bruised mint leaves. Marinate overnight or at least 6 hours, turning. Skewers is a new one, but it probably does help to keep the curling to a minimum although I have never had a problem with that...long tongs make the flipping easy. Bon Appetit all.....

this looks like I would like to try it. What is the purpose of the skewers? I am going to assume it is to prevent the lamb from curling up but I would like to verify that.
