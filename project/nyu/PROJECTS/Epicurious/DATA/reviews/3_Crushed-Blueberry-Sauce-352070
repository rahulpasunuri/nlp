I made this today (for the lemon cornmeal cake with lemon glaze) with fresh blueberries and it came out perfectly. I did not crush any of the blueberries, I thought it came out just as nice (and a little prettier) as is.

Great recipe. I made the following substitutions and it still worked very well: Substituted 1/2 cup flour with whole wheat Substituted 1/4 cup butter with apple sauce Used brown sugar, and reduced quantity to about half a cup Added rind from 2 lemons Added 1/2 lemon juice to batter. Also added 1tsp poppy seeds.

I used frozen blueberries and maybe that's the difference but my sauce never got syrupy. The sauce itself was just okay... I made it for the lemon cornmeal cake which I felt didn't need the sauce. I will definitely be making the cake again soon but sans the blueberry sauce.

I don't know what went wrong...mine NEVER got syrupy. Honestly, it was tasty, but more trouble than it was worth.

Was delicious with fresh berries. I cooked the blueberries longer and still didn't get to a "syrup" consistency, but it was still great with the cake. I used all of the glaze and found it to be a bit overwhelming. I wouldn't change the recipe, but would use less next time.

I used fresh blueberries and much less sugar, and it was a perfect topping for the lemon cornmeal cake.

WONDERFUL PAIRING with the lemon cormeal cake. The sauce came out perfectly, had a very nice consistency. I did cut the recipe in half and it was plenty to serve w/ the cake, although leftovers would be great on anything!...waffles, pancakes. Will def make again.

This goes perfectly with the cake. I made it with frozen blueberries and didn't find them to be a problem at all.

Delicious and perfect with the cake. I cut the sugar in half and added more lemon juice. Especially like the extra pop of the berries added at the end.

I must have cooked this for at least 20 minutes and it never got syrupy. I did use frozen blueberries and I don't know if that made a difference. It tasted ok but I wouldn't bother making it again.

This is a great sauce. I liked just boiling it enough to crush the berries and then adding in the rest at the end. The flavor and consistency were great. We still have some in the fridge and will have it with ice cream, on pancakes or waffles. I used frozen blueberries that I picked last summer and they were perfect. I didn't find them chewy. Maybe the store bought frozen is different from fresh frozen.

I would highly suggest using fresh blueberries, as the frozen ones I used in cooking ended up chewy in the end. I ended the recipe with fresh berries and those were fine. Overall taste was good, but texture would likely improve with all fresh berries.
