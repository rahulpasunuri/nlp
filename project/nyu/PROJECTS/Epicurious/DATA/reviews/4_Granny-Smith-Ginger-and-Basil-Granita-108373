This was such a light and refreshing dessert. It's has lots of flavor and is great for you. I saved time by using half of an emergency packet instead of the crushed vitamin C tablet and it turned out great! I will be sure to make this again.

Very, very nice! It went beautifully for a dessert course with thin ginger cookies, following a spicy Thai Turkey salad. I don't have a juicer, and used the sparkling apple cider. Grating and pressing the ginger was interesting; I had no idea ginger had so much juice!

This is a deliciously refreshing ice. OK - I don't own a juicer. But I did have bottled apple juice on hand that I needed to use up. I used only 1/4 cup of sugar and blended that with the basil and ginger. It all strained out beautifully. I skipped the vitamin C tablet. I also froze it in my ice cream maker, so it's technically a sorbet and not a granita. But it still made a lovely mid course refresher. I was pleased to find that it was not too sweet, as I had feared. The basil and ginger give it a very nice zip.
