This sandwich is simply delicious. My boyfriend and I were raving about it the first night I made it and have been talking about it ever since.

In case it is not obvious...I served the "Mini pizzas" open faced...

this recipe is a great base for what I like to call mini pizzas! I put pork and artichokes in the search and this was one of 10 results. I am not a big fan of prosciutto and I didn't have any anyway.I made the mayo mixture and it was fabulous! I used mini ciabatta bread (which I often use as a base for a pizza);Thinly sliced roast pork for meat and artichoke tapanade. The flavors blended so well topped with cheese of ones choice...delicious!

Both my husband and I agree, this is a boring sandwich. Will not make again. It's fast and easy, but without taste, still not worth the effort.

I have made this recipe many times for dinner, once for a picnic. My husband says he would eat it every week, maybe twice a week! I couldn't find the fancy cheese, but fontinella and parmesan taste perfectly good. I've always used fresh rosemary, which I keep in the freezer--I think that might make a difference.
