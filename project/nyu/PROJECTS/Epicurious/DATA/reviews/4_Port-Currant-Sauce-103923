I agree with most of the reviews. It's good sauce and very easy to make. However, I served this with the duck salad, put the WHITE plates in the dishwasher and when I took them out the next day I had to soak them in a clorox solution to remove the stains. Is it my dishes or is this a common problem?

I made this sauce as an alternative to mint jelly as an accompaniment for rack of lamb. The only changes I made were to add a little cider vinegar at the end as I wanted a little tang to the sauce. I also reduced it to a syrupy consistency. It was a good move because it concentrated the flavors even more. I also suggest rehydrating the currants while the sauce cooks. They are great when they are plump.

This is an amazingly simple and basic recipe that tastes out of this world. It was a great way to get rid of a bottle of port from the Christmas basket. We were only disappointed at the small amount it renders by the end of the preparation!!!

I used dried cranberries instead of currants...just delicious! Buy a decent bottle of Port, it makes a difference.

This sauce is great - especially for duck. chicken or pork... just wondered if it would be too sweet for a filet of beef?

I make this port-currant sauce often. I serve it with duck breast or add some fresh rosemary and serve it with lamb. I have also added dried cherries to the recipe and it is great. Everyone always asks for more sauce!

This sauce was so easy to make and the taste is indescribably delicious! This sauce would be wonderful with roast pork as well as duck. I added extra sauce on each salad plate and my guests were scraping the pattern off to get the last drop of sauce. SUPERB.
