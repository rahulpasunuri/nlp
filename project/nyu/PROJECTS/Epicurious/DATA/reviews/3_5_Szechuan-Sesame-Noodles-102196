I add 3 TBS tahini and whatever veggies are at hand (lightly steamed brocolli, red peppers, jicama, carrots, snap peas). I never seem to have leftovers!

peanut allergy here so omitted the peanuts all together. yum! you can make them spicier depending on what your serving them with by adding more of the chili used dried chinese egg noodles

Great easy recipe. Pairs very well with the Chicken, Shrimp and Beef Sates with Peanut Sauce recipe. Easy to double/triple for a large group and is good cold the next day.

I made this for a potluck to rave reviews. Very easy and flavorful!

We used 2 lbs linguini and tripled the sauce. This served 22 ladies for lunch with Watercress and Mango Salad and Mu Shu in Moments. We stir fried the red onions and added the peanuts last.

I am rating this a 4 fork, with the changes I made. It was easy to make and very tasty with the changes. After reading the reviews, I too, decided to add peanut butter (about 4 tbsp)and more chili sauce to the sauce. It made a world of difference. I also added alot of sesame seeds for a nice crunch to the noodles. This was a lovely side dish to a 5 spice duck breast recipe I made. I will definitely make this again.

Great, but I took the advice of others and tweaked it a bit. Skipped the peanuts and instead added some peanut butter to the sauce near the end, stirring the PB in to melt. Sauce seemed a bit thick so I addd a bit of the pasta cooking water. Also kicked up the chili garlic paste to 1 TBSP. Spicy and delicious!

Eh. Not bad, not great. I found it a little one- dimensional (wish I'd taken others' advice to add peanut butter and more spice). There are so many other good sesame noodle recipes out there that I probably won't revisit this one.

This recipe was easy to make and great cold for leftovers. I think the results will depend on which teriyaki sauce one uses. I thought about making some teriyaki sauce from scratch, but didn't have the time and ended up using Yoshida's gourmet sauce (sold at Costco). I didn't follow the recipe precisely but I used all the recipes only I put them in as suited me

Perhaps because the stir-fry I made with this had so much flavor, I wasn't hugely impressed with this noodle dish. The people I made it for were, but it needed more flavor in my opinion. Next time I'll add more spice (I used chili powder instead of chili oil) and maybe some peanut butter to kick up the flavor.

I just made this and it has a nice flavor. I am not overwhlemed with it. it is just nice! Too much of a teriyaki taste and I always thought szechuan was supposed to be spicy. I followed the reciep but also added a large dollop of creamy peanut butter instead of peanuts to enhance the sauce a bit as well as some red pepper flakes. The peanut butter just added some depth to the sauce. Will see how it goes over and decide if i make it again!

Delicious! Added leftover Costco chicken breast, re-hydrated dried chinese mushroom & hulled edaname for a main dish. Would definitely make again.

This was excellent and simple to make, even though I had to improvise and make my own teriyaki sauce. I added lightly roasted zucchini and red pepper to add some crunch and colour and served with a simple green salad with an sesame, soy dressing and it was great. Will definitely make again!

This was simple and delicious. I added some finely sliced strips of celery, carrots, and bell peppers to make it into a light but satisfying lunch. I didn't have teriyaki sauce, so I used a dark soy sauce and just a drop of molasses instead, and it worked well. I also added a finely chopped green chili just for fun. I will definitely make this again!

I've been making this dish for about five years -- always to rave reviews. Easy to double (or more) for a large group. A great base recipe that you can improvise on to your liking as many others have indicated.

Delicious! My entire family loved it, including kids from 4-12! The only change I made was I added snow-peas and some sauted chicken to make it a full meal. This is going into my regular rotation.

Need to add mushrooms definitely. Also recommend stir frying the onions also. This makes it a little sweet but tasty. Also use homemade teriyaki sause: basically soy sauce, mirin, and sugar simmered.

I made this tonihgt. my wife thinks it's the best noodle recipe i have made yet ( and i made many) I added Shitake Mushrooms to this dish. thanks again

Simple and delicious! I added chopped mushrooms, red peppers, scallions, and snow peas. I used hot sesame oil and adjusted the chili garlic sauce to taste, but it was nice and spicy. Very quick and easy - and with the veggies, it's hearty enough on its own.

Yummy and simple weeknight dish. I added both the red peppers and the snow peas - next time I'll add a little less ginger, but there will be a next time.

I made this last night to go with the Chinese barbecued pork from this site. Delicious and spicey.

Absolutely wonderful - we were trying to decide what to make at 7pm and this was what we went with. What a great dish - simple with lots of flavor and easy to make!

I like that this salad has a little bit of a kick to it, but I found the dressing to actually a bit on the bland side. At the end of the day, it tastes like Chow Mein with Soy Sauce and lacks the MMMMMM factor.

This dish was just okay. It did not have nearly as much flavor or punch as I had expected. I added shrimp and red pepper which was probably the best thing about the recipe. If I ever made it again, which I most likely won't, I would add more garlic and chili sauce.

Rating: 3
This was great as a main dish. I cooked some shrimp in the skillet with the garlic, ginger and sesame oil and then tossed it all together with the pasta. We did, however, end up adding a bit more chili sauce after tasting it to intensify the flavor and the heat. I can't wait to have it again!

I loved this receipe - I think I may have over cooked my rice noodles - but who cares - the flavors are fabulous......definetly on my list of things to cook.

Thought this was yummy, but I did make some changes. I added chicken marinated in soy sauce, a little teriyaki, and a 1/2 t. of chili-garlic sauce. I cooked that before making the sauce. Instead of using so much teriyaki sauce I used half of that and half low sodium soy sauce, a half teaspoon more of the chili sauce, and less sesame oil in the skillet. Really good, and very spicy. My family loved it!

AWESOME!!! I thought I loved ginger, I would add less to this recipe. I kicked it up a notch with cooking the garlic and ginger in chili oil and adding cayenne pepper flakes at the end. I didn't have peanuts, so I used peanut butter. I like using the green scallions. I also added toasted sesame seeds. I thought about throwing in a few mushrooms but couldn't wait. I can say WOW to this one.

A definite keeper; easy and light.

Very yummy! I used half of a golden onion, which I sauteed with sliced red bell pepper. Also, I cut the amount of ginger in half. This was a really tasty dish, very flavorful, and the chili-garlic sauce gave it a nice spicy flavor.

I found this to be yummy. I did cook the onions for a few minutes to soften them. I also tried it adding sliced bell peppers and shrimp to make a main dish, and it was a hit! Could have used a little more of a pepper kick...add some red pepper flakes next time, maybe?

I had no luck with this dish. The ginger overbearing and the only other thing you could taste was Teriyaki sauce. It is easy though.

Instead of adding the red onions raw to the cooked noodles, I cooked the onion with the terryaki sauce mixture to soften them a little. This was good lukewarm, but probably better cold. The key is probably finding a good terryaki sauce - the one I used was roasted garlic flavored. Served with steak salad, which made a good combo.

This one is a keeper. It had a lot of good flavors and had just the right crunch with the bell pepper and snow peas. I had it heated the first time around and then discovered the leftovers were just as good right out of the fridge.

Excellent - great flavors - thoroughly enjoyable - this one is a keeper!

Very good. I vary the spiciness and use natural crunchy peanut butter. I find the warm noodles more appealing than cold. The dish is fine with regular pasta and whips up in no time but still wows the crowd.

This was very tasty, I made it a bit hotter. It makes a ton though! We did manage to eat all of it, even my very brave 2 year old!
