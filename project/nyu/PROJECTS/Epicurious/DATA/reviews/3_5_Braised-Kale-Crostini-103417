We loved this dish. I made a few modifications including reducing the amount of broth (I used 2 cups vegetable broth and 1 cup water). It makes a lot of kale, so you could cut up a whole baguette. My husband who scrunches up his nose at the word "kale" enjoyed the dish, which is saying a lot.

Simple and a nice alternative way to eat kale. Even the kids liked this. I used way less stock than called for. This will stay on the keeper list.

This is an easy appetizer to make and a healthier alternative to ones' loaded with fat. I added a white bean puree first. ( can of canneleni beans, garlic, onion and a bit of chic broth then pureed.) I put on the kale which I chopped up fine and finished with a sprinkle of finely chopped raw red bell pepper. Yum and perfect for the holiday.

Ohhhh, myyyy goodnesss! Where do I go to submit not just a review, but a menu suggestion?! Make this, with "Chicken With Prosciutto, Rosemary and White Wine", (this site) and you will convince even olde world Aunt Sophia who thinks she's the only cook in the family! I added a shallot, because I had one begging to be used, and like the results. I also topped with fresh grated parmesan. Awesome!

Very nice recipe. The entire family loved it. It was the first time two of us ever had kale and the other two each had it before and disliked it. After eating this, we all agreed we would even have the kale by itself! I found it a bit salty even though I used very diluted broth so next time I will be sure to use no-salt added broth and adjust seasoning at the end. I'm watching my fat intake so I did not drizzle olive oil at the end and don't think it needed it. This one is definitely going in the "keepers" file.

This Kale has become a staple in our house. It's really good the next day in sandwiches too!

I agree with over reviewers. It is not necessary to add as much liquid as the recipe recommends. I used only a cup of broth, and it turned out very well. I made the crostini for the party and had left-overs. They reheated very well in the toaster. (I was afraid they would be soggy.) My husband had a bad experience with kale as a child. But I think after making this recipe, we will try to introduce it into our food repertoire.

Easy method of kale preparation, I would skip the crostini next time and serve the kale as a side dish. I agree with the previous reviewer - use less broth for best results.

I make this wonderful dish often since I found the recipie a few years ago. I tend to use less broth than called for and cook for about 10 more minutes, then drain kale, as I always have broth left over that won't evaporate. I serve this alongside a lemon, garlic angel hair or just a big veggie salad. The other thing about this dish is that it has other, "ahem" benefits which we sometimes need to take advantage of. Quite a tasty way to clear things up, so to speak.

This is wonderful, either as an elegant appetizer or as an unusual side dish. Be sure, however, to use low-sodium chicken broth. Otherwise, the stock reduces and the salt becomes so concentrated that it makes the dish almost inedible.

My wife and I, as well as our dinner guests, really enjoyed this delicious appetizer. One suggestion: either use low sodium broth, as indicated in the recipe, or reduce salt to taste.

This recipe is great. It adds a twist to the idea of bruschetta and is well loved by even the pickiest in my family. I make it every chance I get.

Amazingly delicous, unexpected crostini. Black kale is tender and tasty with the evoo and garlic, salt and pepper added in.
