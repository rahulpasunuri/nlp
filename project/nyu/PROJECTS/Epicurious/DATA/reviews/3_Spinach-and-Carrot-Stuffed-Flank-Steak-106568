I marinated the meat for a day prior using the "Gilled Marinated London Broil" recipe on Epicurious. I added cheese along with the other vegetables and found the flavour to be wonderful!

I made the recipe exactly as given -- except for shortening the cooking time a bit at each step. The presentation is elegant, and the combination of carrots, spinach and the herbs in the crumb stuffing made an excellent contrast in flavors. Expecting leftovers, every scrap of meat was consumed at dinner. I served this with Baked Potato Chips and salad. This recipe will likely replace a number of favorite ways of preparing flank steak.

On the advice of one reviewer, I added a leek instead of using an onion (since I had one in the 'fridge) and carmelized parsnips instead of adding carrots. Also added chopped mushrooms to the filling mix. Next time, I would use less bread crumbs and be sure to have twine on hand. The recipe wasn't as difficult to put together as I thought at first glance. Cooked using the searing/roasting method. Will surely make again with the variations already tried.

Since other reviews indicated that the flavor was bland, I used additional seasoning. While presentation was beautiful and the steak was tender, the outcome was not worth the effort needed for the assembly. Sigh.

Great dish!!! I added sauteed onions and mushrooms along with extra garlic. The carrots don't add much falvor to the dish, next time I would roast the carrots instead of boiling them for more flavor.

This was much easier than I thought, taste is wonderful off the grill. I actually added extra garlic and bacon to the bread crumb stuffing, which was really good!

We really enjoyed this and thought it was quite flavorful. We don't have a grill, so followed the roasting instructions, and had to cook it longer than the recipe called for. Served it with grilled asparagus with gorgonzola butter (on epicurious), herbed rice, and a caprese salad, and it was a fantastic, summery combination. We'd make the whole menu again!

While this recipe was not as difficult as I thought it would be to make, the result was disappointing. The bread crumb stuffing was not very flavorful, and the consistency was soggy. The spinach and carrots looked beautiful rolled up in the flank steak, but they, too, lacked flavor. I would recommend adding cheese (something strong like feta or fontina) and sauted onions to the stuffing, in lieu of the breadcrumbs, and increasing the vegetables - more carrots, for example, and/or a more flavorful green such as chard or argula. The dish does present very well, and with some variations, could be something worth serving to company.
