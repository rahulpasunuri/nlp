Followed directions as stated in the recipe. Used Trader Joe's Greek Style Honey Yogurt. Layered in a parfait glass and put some chocolate shavings on top. Delicious. And, quite healthy. The only sugar is in the 1/3 c of Red Currant Jelly.

I made this dessert on a whim as a thank-you for some friends of mine who let me crash at their house for a few days, and it was perfect with vanilla bean ice cream. The taste is both intensely sweet and intensely tangy; the balsamic and red-current sort of melt down into a Jello-esque substance at first, but fear not! The key is not to let it get too hot on the stove, preventing scorching. I alternately halved and quartered the strawberries, but ran out of time to let them macerate--instead, I threw the whole thing in the fridge for a bit and let it marinate. It got good reviews from everyone, including the unexpected dinner guests. ;) There was a bit of extra juice left at the end, but that could have just been because it didn't quite soak into the strawberries because the whole thing was chilled.
