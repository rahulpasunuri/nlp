We loved this recipe and thank the reviewers for their tips. We like the idea from Raleigh, NC to saute the tomatoes in the garlic to make a sauce for the orzo. Adding the feta was a good idea too. Two cloves of garlic -- yes!! We plan to try this again soon, and will add more tomaotes and spinach.

Ok but not great. Made exactly as written but it seemed to be missing something. Quite bland and not worth the effort and all the dirty dishes that are required.

Made this for my grandparents and they loved it! I like that is was quick and easy and healthy and delicious!

This was easy and came out great. I used italian orzo made with durham wheat, grape tomatoes instead of cherry and a bit more garlic. The halibut cooks well in our toaster oven, keeping the kitchen cool.

We like this recipe a lot. I have used halibut, cod, scallops and want to try it with chicken. Last night I sauteed some mushrooms with shallots and garlic; cooked the orzo pilaf-style and stirred in the mushroom mixture w/the spinach and tomatoes. Added a little feta spinach - it was quite good.

Add 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese to couscous or orzo.

I made this tonight for my husband(who doesn't care for fish) and he loved it. I made a couple of changes. I sauted diced onion and garlic and then added the spinach,sauted lightly and then added the tomatoes. For the sauce I added a tspn of Dijon mustard to the oil and lemon juice.

This was very good. I used red cargo rice instead of orzo (which would also be great) and threw some basil into it with the spinach. Also, I heated the pan up with a very thin layer of oil, put it in the preheated oven, then turned on the broiler. This browned the fish nicely and made for a nice presentation.

Liked the fact that this was pretty healthy, but the flavors in the orzo didnt blow us away. I think the spinach was too overpowering. I give it high marks for ease of prep.

I Made this recipe last night and it was superb! I fiddled with it a bit by coooking the Orzo in about 1 cup of chicken stock and letting the Orzo absorb the stock. When it was almost absorbed, I added the tomatos and bit of fresh basil. At the very end I added the spinach. When it was just wilted I added about 1/2 cup of feta. For the fish, I seared in on high heat on both sides for 30 seconds a side then cooked it in a 425 oven for 10 minutes and it was perfect. The meal was amazing...we were still talking about how good it was the next morning. We will make this for company.

My husband and I have been making this meal for years and we love it! We switch up the orzo recipe a bit though: when we add the orzo to the boiling water, start sauteing the garlic (usually 2 cloves) and then add the tomatoes along with a pinch of red pepper flakes and liberally season with salt and pepper. When the orzo finishes cooking add it to the pan along with the spinach. We have found that cooking the tomatoes like that creates a type of sauce for the orzo that we really enjoy.

Excellent recipe! It was easy, quick and delicious. A great week night meal.

This recipe was very good, although I changed it up just a little bit. For one, before baking the fish I seasoned it liberally with salt and pepper before putting on the dressing. I also added garlic to the dressing in addition to lots of pepper and a little salt. I cooked the orzo while I had a separate pan sautéing the garlic (I used 2 cloves) with a couple pinches of red pepper flakes. After a few minutes I added the cherry tomatoes, spinach, and basil, removing from heat just before the spinach began to wilt. I then drained the orzo and combined it with the garlic mixture. While I did use some additional dressing to top my plate, I don't think it really needed it and next time won't add it to the cooked fish.

I've made this twice. First time I seared the halibut to get a brown top then ran it in the oven. That worked. This time I gave the recipe a try and cooked it for the alloted time plus some in the oven. I then turned the broiler on. It got just slightly brown. I did not want to overcook the fish. Also the spinach was slow to wilt both times I've fixed this.So - I'll work with these couple of issues because this does taste so good and it looks awesome!

Very tasty. I especially liked the orzo with spinach and tomatoes. I added a lemon-basil sauce to the fish before cooking at it was nice.

Used 3 pc of halibut, skin on, approx .5 lb each. kept the dressing etc as written. cooked halibut approx 14 min on 415 degrees convect bake on foil lined cookie sheet, skin side down. Perfect - the skin stayed on the foil and clean up a breeze. Orzo - used 2 clove garlic, cooked orzo approx 5 min as directed, grilled organic grape tomatoes then cooled and cut in half. Added feta and organic baby spinach - spectacular! Could make orzo in advance and add spinach and tomatoes before serving. Son loved it too. Served with the Quinoa black bean salad recipe on this site - flavors complemented well and even tasted good together! Fabulous.

the first time i made this, the fish fell apart so it was more like chunks of fish mixed with orzo. it was great! a nice light midweek dinner dish. i plan to make it tonight and add the feta as others have recommended.

This dish came out really good. It was light, but tasty. I used cod because it was on sale. I also took the advice of another user and added parmesean and red pepper flakes to the orzo. Yummy!

This was really delicious. I served the wilted spinach/tomatoes over brown rice because we'd had pasta the night before. I like the idea of roasting the tomatoes and adding pine nuts. I will try that next time. A keeper.

Cooked this dish for a few friends and everyone enjoyed it. I thought it was a bit bland, but very tasty nonetheless. You can't really go wrong with halibut.

This fish was simple, light, and delicious! I made this for my boyfriend when we first started dating, and it was a hit. I loved the effect of the lightly wilted and warmed cherry tomatoes, it kept the pasta light while balancing out the fish, which might have been bland without the orzo. I will be using this approach to pasta and fish for my own baked fish recipe, substituting the orzo for angel hair.

Delicious and easy! I added some fresh tarragon to the olive oil and lemon dressing. A nice addition.

This was a lovely,easy ,quick dish. I did roast the tomatoes first but did not add any cheese--saving on fat and calories. It was delicious and definitely a dish I would serve guests.

As is, I think it's a little bland but with a few changes it becomes pretty good. I tripled the garlic, added some red pepper flakes, capers, toasted pine nuts and lots of parmesan. I roasted the tomates (tossed in olive oil and sprinkled with a little parmesan) to bring out their flavors and I used salmon instead of halibut because that's what was on hand. Next time I would use a more flavorful cheese and add some roasted red peppers. Quick and easy, which makes it good for a week night, but it does need a little help/adjusting.

This was delicious. I went easy on the spinach, and added loads of fresh basil and oregano. Next time I will add feta. I also doubled the lemon juice mixture, and it was all just wonderful!

This is REALLY good. I've made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe as is...and it was good. The second time I roasted the tomatoes before adding them to the dish....and that made it GREAT! Also served with parmesan (or gouda).

We thought this was an excellent weeknight recipe. Quick and flavorful and calls for items we usually have in the pantry. I added toasted pine nuts and my husband and I thought that was a great addition. Next time I think I'll try adding a little crumbled feta and some kalamatas as others have tried/suggested, just for variety and because those are ingredients we love and usually have on hand. Try this recipe --you'll probably love it, too.

Made this for my boyfriend last night and it was perfect. Wanted something light and healthy and this fit the bill. Did add feta, mostly because I love it, but thought it was plenty flavorful. Fish came out perfect as well. We're keeping this on our quick meal menu.

Quick and easy! Definitely include sliced kalamata olives and feta cheese (I used tomato & basil flavored feta). I also only used 1/2 cup of orzo, but could've use a bit more. I think 1 cup of orzo would've been too much.

The baked halibut was wonderful. I would definitely make it again. It was easy and delicious.

This is quite good for a fast, basic and healthy recipe. I do see how it can tend toward bland  i used extra lemon juice, chili flakes and a little parmesan. I also subbed Chilean Sea Bass (the new sustainably farmed kind) for the Halibut. I didn't think it would make so much, but the person who said that 1 c. of orzo is a lot is right  we are huge eaters and we couldn't finish it.

This is in frequent rotation in our house. It's fresh, easy and delicious. The cherry tomatoes come out very sweet. I can never get the spinach to wilt as much as shown in the picture. Next time I will try cooking it separately before adding to the mix.

A review for the Orzo Pasta: Really tasty and something different from my usual rice with fish dish. I made this for friends and they really raved about it - especially the colors of the tomatoes and the spinach. If the spinach doesn't wilt, just cook it a little longer.

Rating: 2
I like this recipe because it contains many healthful ingredients all combined to create a balanced and nutritious meal. I like the combination of colourful spinach and tomatoes, as well as the zestiness of the lemons. However, I did find it a bit on the bland side. Maybe needs something to give it a little punch. Not sure what that would be. I did use a little bit of chili pepper flakes, but still needs something else. It's both simple, nutritious and nice to look at. I am keeping this one as one of my staples.

This was not good. I don't know what happened, b/c i followed the directions pretty much exactly. The dressing was overpoweringly lemony, the spinach did not wilt, there was WAY too much oil, and the flavor was too acidic. The fish was fine. Waste of time.

Loved this. Added some grated parmesean to the pasta to give it a little more flavor, but it was very good and light.

Great recipe- I always love quick dishes that include the veggie without considering a side. Added some toasted pine nuts and crumbled feta to the spinach/cherry mixture for texture and flavor. Also agreed with the other cook- you need to pan sear the fish for a bit if you want the golden crust in the photo. Yum....!

Quick, easy, fresh & delicious! It reminded me of something ordered from a restaurant. Yum! I doubled the pasta because it did not seem like enough... and regretted it. It was too much! I had to sub Sole for Halibut and it was still excellent!

My husband and I loved this...the children thought it was too tart...ce la vie! It is light and delicious. I poured all the dressing on the halibut and then topped with some petit diced (canned) tomatoes I had opened. I then poured the cooked sauce over the fish and pasta when serving. I would use 1/2 the amount of pasta. We love pasta...but this was a lot of pasta. I sauteed the tomatoes and then the spinach for a few minutes before adding the pasta and they both had a great texture and flavor. Don't be afraid to use the salt and pepper...I used fresh ground of both and a lot of them. About 1/4 - 1/3 pound of fish per person is more than adequate.

This was easy and very good. I substituted tilapia for the halibut. Will certainly make it again.

A simple, easy, tasty recipe - exactly as promised. I substituted mahimahi in place of the halibut (because it's what I had handy) and found the lemon dressing added the right amount of zip. I'll definitely be making this again.

Sorry, this just didn't do it for me. The spinach did not wilt down enough and the fish was kinda tasteless. One plus....it is fast and easy. The only way I would do this recipe again is to serve the fish, vegetables and pasta seperately (not combined as prited)

Just okay, didn't love it. I took other readers' suggestions and added feta and olives to the orzo so it wouldn't be so bland. This made the side dish tasty, but the halibut was nothing special. Could have been the condition of the fish.

I am not a fish lover - but I really liked this dish. I slivered some kalamata olives and added to the orzo mixture. I also sprinkled with some crumbled feta. Just the extra flavor nudge that it needed!

I liked it quite a bit, but I can't help feeling like it could use little kick of some sort. I even doubled the garlic and added a splash of white wine to the spinach/orzo/tomato mixture. Still, I'm yearning for a little more pizzaz. Maybe a few red pepper flakes in the orzo mixture next time.

I only made the orzo for a side dish. I didn't have cherry tomatoes but large ones from my garden. I quartered the tomatoes and it worked out well. This is an easy, delicious side dish and will go well with anything.
