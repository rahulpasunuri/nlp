I've made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. The second time, I substituted arugula for the dandelion, assorted baby squash for the delicata squash, and spicy roasted pecans and almonds for the pine nuts. It was even more delicious. With the baby squash, you can eat the peels which makes it more elegant.

The squash was not as delicate "no pun intended" with the salad as I had hoped.

Loved. I did not use pomegranate juice but fresh pomegranate seeds and some of their juices. It was pretty and tasted perfect.

I used 2 Tbs pomegranate molasses instead of juice, to amp up the flavor. It turned out too sweet - I recommend using 1 Tbs of the molasses. Otherwise delicious and impressive.

we used arugula instead of dandelion and something called a sweet dumpling squash instead of delicata. this was a huge hit, people absolutely loved it. took some time to brown the squash, but it was worth it. total raves.

This is a beautiful recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving. It was a big hit with my vegetarian guests. I loved the combinations of flavors but cut the dandelion greens with some red leaf. I will make it again but next time serve it at a more intimate dinner party. The squash was wonderful. I used pomegranate molasses in the vinaigrette and added extra balsamic.

We made this recipe and now just omit the salad greens. This recipe is flavorful sweet,tart, and beautiful enough that it is on our Thanksgiving menu by request from guests again this year.

The flavors just didn't work together. Very disappointing since it looks so beautiful.

This recipe provides a very pretty presentation but offers no flavor. I would NOT make this again.

I absolutely agree with the last review: delicious and as beautiful a complement to a dinner as you could ever wish. I tried to get the concentrate but couldn't--the juice was fine. I used arugula, which was excellent. I plan to make it OFTEN.

This salad was absolutely beatuiful to lood at and even better to eat...Rave reviews. I did substitute Pomegranate concentrate (with is very costly), but it brought the flavor to an intensity- that you just will not get using the juice. Also I used mesclun greens -appealing to a wider audience.
