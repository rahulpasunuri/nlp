I make this regularly, always omitting the blender and sieve parts. Terrific! Wonderful over ice cream. A great, easy, light way to cook rhubarb.

I used some blueberries too, and the sweetness of the berries perfectly complimented the tart rhubarb. Easy and very very good with some home made whipped cream. Ice cream or a little cake/shortbread would have been good too.

Easy but wonderfully rich. Great combination.
