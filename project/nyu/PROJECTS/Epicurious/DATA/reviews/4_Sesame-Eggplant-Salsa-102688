Love it. Always a hit. Done just as instructed.

Brought this as a vegetarian option to a party and everyone LOVED it. Didn't have chili-garlic sauce so just added some minced garlic with Sriracha. The pita chips are great with it. It leaves something to be desired visually, but what can you do. Just stuck some cilantro leaves in the center as garnish; it helped a bit. Either way, once you try it there's no denying it!

Meh. I was excited about this after reading the rave reviews, but I've got to say I am underwhelmed. First of all, it is VERY spicy, which I should have known when I saw how much garlic paste went into it. Secondly, it is too sweet and kind of mushy. I'll try adding some lemon juice and salt to balance it before I serve, but I don't plan on making this again. Plain Babaghanoush is tastier and much easier to make than this dip.

This is a fabulous dish. Everyone I've ever made it for agrees. It doesn't look as good as it tastes but the flavors all come together very well.

This is one fantastic, delicious, savory appetizer. Everyone I serve this to raves. I will say that I generally add more of some of seasonings, to my taste since we are a family that loves a lot of flavor. Can't wait to make it again.

Absolutely delicious! Every time I make this it goes quickly and always to rave reviews. The pita chips are perfect to serve with it. I make extras to use later with other dishes. I highly recommend this dip if you like full flavored food.

This is one of my favorite recipes and always comes out great. The fusion of ingredients gives it an interesting flavor and everyone loves it. I usually do not go through the trouble of making the pita crisps. I just purchase various crackers instead.

I made this last week along with the pita crisps for a party - it was gone in minutes!! Everyone raved about it!

All of the ingredients in this recipe make for a fleshy, chunky salsa, which I love! However, I found the taste to be a bit bland despite the fact that the amount of cilantro called for was excessive. It overpowered everything else in the recipe. Perhaps a little hot sauce or other strong spice would be good. All in all, I would make it again with some personal spicy favorites added.

This dip gets rave reviews from everybody who tries it. (it's not really a salsa though, dip is a better description.)

Pass on this one. The ingredients sounded good but I didn't like the way they tasted together. Not visually appealing which didn't help either. Much better recipes out there for eggplant.

I made this dish a couple of times to raves from party guests. Healthy too!

Wonderful Salsa, everybody loves it at parties. It makes so much that you can even keep it for a few days. The parmesan crips are easy and different.

Hmmm...I was convinced this would be a fail-safe recipe considering all the rave reviews however, I made this salsa, along with 'Party Salsa' and Provencal Salsa and nobody touched this one. Being chinese, the taste wasn't so strange but perhaps for salsa, it just didn't taste 'fresh'. For me, the texture and taste seemed more suitable for a dish served hot. In fact, it tasted good when I was cooking it, but afterwards, at room temperature, it just tasted sort of like 'leftover' sauce, not really a salsa.

Just a little too different for our tastes.

I've made this twice now, with rave results. Both times, I've baked the eggplants a couple nights ahead of time and refrigerated until the day of the party, when I put it all together. Everybody loves the ginger and the unexpected heat, which is still tame enough for my midwestern friends.

I have had more people ask for this recipe than any other item I have made.

I am very finicky when it comes to eggplant, but I love this recipe!!! ! I made it for a holiday party, and have been asked to make for every gathering since. Very unique flavors that come together beautifully. Definitely a recipe to hang on to!

This dish received rave reviews at our holiday party -- I believe it was one of the most talked about dishes! Definately something more on the original side that your guests won't find at every party -- so try it!

This was the one recipe at our annual cocktail party that everyone asked for.

Made this for a party last night--it was a BIG hit! The parma. crisps were great with it, but you could also serve it with veggies, or even cracker. Wasn't hard to make either, but did take a little time, so don't wiat until the last minute!
