This was a major disappointment. The topping was OK, but the bread part had little flavour and an unpleasant dry crumbly texture. I am used to doing gluten free baking -- these results were worse.

The combination of ingredients was excellent; however something was missing. The dough was extremely dry and after baking it had the texture of a hockey puck. I consulted a culinary professional who thought it lacked sufficient gluten and should have some regular flour mixed with the semolina.
