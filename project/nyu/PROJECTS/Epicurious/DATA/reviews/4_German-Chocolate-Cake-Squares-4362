Great recipe - it's odd that the cuisine listed is German and it's lumped in the Oktoberfest group. The "German" of GCC has nothing to do with Germany. The special sweet chocolate was created in the early 1900's by Sam German, a New York baker.

Loved this receipe but made some minor changes. I used a decorative baking dish as it is easier to transport and I did put some mini choc chips in the cake but not in the icing. For the icing, I roasted the pecans as that really brings out their flavor. The amount of 'custard' for the topping seemed excessive...so I took out 3/4 of a cup ...then added the coconut and the pecans. I figured I could add it back in if it seemed too thick but it was PLENTY of nice thick icing. I left the cake in the decorative dish so didn't ice sides...you might want all that icing if you ice the sides. It was delicious! A christmas tradition I will make again next year for sure.

I've made this twice now. For a moister cake: rather than separating the yolks and beating the whites, I added both yolks and whites to the sugar/butter mixture and then added 1 teaspoon baking powder to the dry ingredients. This was a much much moister cake, still with a tender crumb.

Rating: 4
a very tender crumb to the cake. Like other reviewers, I would recommend removing the chocolate chips from the cake batter, as they are really just distracting and too much (from someone who usually thinks there is never too much anything!).

This is a great recipe. It's easy and absolutely moist and delicious! No need to try to turn it into a layer cake. It's humble presentation is more than made up for by how delicious it is.

Rating: 0
PS: Re frosting the sides: it worked well to frost the top normally, then use a greased baggie to apply and spread the frosting on the sides of the cake. The frosting recipe made just enough for a 2-layer cake (top and sides).

I am a german chocolate cake lover, but I didn't *love* this. The cake was good but not great. I made it in 9" round pans so I could layer it (made 2 but it could have fit in 3 pans more comfortably). I had the feeling when I made it that I should be buttering and flouring the pan, but the recipe said to butter only, and white flour doesn't look good on a chocoate cake, so I skipped it and ended up with...chunks. It didn't loosen well at all and it was a mess to fix. The taste was good but not wonderful. The frosting was good and had a nice balance. I think I would try the inside out german chox cake from this site before making this again.

I took this cake to a party tonight and returned home with an empty pan and rave reviews. I followed the recipe as written, but didn't put chocolate chips in the icing (I did put them in the cake). This cake is incredibly moist and has a fabulous taste and I will definitely make it again. My only complaint is that the cake rose so high the batter ran over the sides of the pan and all over the floor of my oven. The batter started to burn, my kitchen was full of smoke and even the dog got up and walked out. I wasn't sure the cake was done but it stopped jiggling after 50 minutes so I took it out. It collapsed a little bit after cooling but once the frosting was on, you couldn't tell. An absolutely delish dish!

This cake was better the next day. I cut the recipe in half and used an 8 X 8 inch pan. For the frosting, I used two egg yolks and it worked very well. If you do this, be sure to reduce your cooking time. It baked in approximately 40 minutes.

I left the chocolate chips out of the recipe but followed all other directions and this cake turned out PERFECT!! It doesn't have the same look as a German Chocolate layered cake but it makes up for it in taste. I will definitely make this one again.

I made this as a stacked cake, using 2 round metal pans, and baked for 45 min. (which was just right). In future, I will skip the choc. chips. My fiance found it almost too rich--the chips put it over the top. (To me, there's no such thing as "too rich" so I thought it was delicious in general, although the chips did gravitate to the middle of the pan and sink a bit into the batter, which was frustrating.) Some might want less almond extract. Also: Don't try to frost the sides if you bake this as a cake! The pecans make the frosting slough off, and it's very ugly...

Rating: 4
Really good frosting. The only thing I did differently was maybe add some more pecans because I had some extra, and I didn't use the chocolate chips. I used this frosting with the cake from "inside out german chocolate cake". It frosted three layers very generously. Best german chocolate cake I've made yet, I make one every year for my dad's birthday.

This review is for the frosting. Had limited time, so used a Betty Crocker's German Chocolate Cake Mix (yes, I admit it) and made a 2-layer round cake. It was moist and wonderful with this frosting. Slight changes: I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, omitted the chocolate chips, and added a tad more coconut and pecans (because I had just a little extra and wanted to use them up.) 1 cup sugar created the perfect amount of sweetness!

The icing is what really makes these delicious. I made these for my Dad's birthday and he and everyone else loved them. Toasted the pecans as suggested, which was a good idea.

I'm not a german chocolate cake fan, but some of the people I love are. I read the reviews and made several suggested modifications plus some of my own. This cake got an A+ from hard core german chocolate fans! Here's what I did to modify the recipe: used four ounces Baker's german chocolate and two ounces Schaffen (sp) semi sweet; substituted one tablespoon of cocoa for one tablespoon of flour; eliminated chocolate chips in cake and icing; toasted the pecans before I chopped them; substituted 1 1/2 tsps vanilla for almond extract; added salt to the icing.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. The only thing I would do differently next time is cut the frosting recipe in half. I found that it made way more frosting than I (and my family) felt it needed. Otherwise, fantastic!!

German Chocolate cake is my husband's favorite! I made this last night for his birthday and it is the best cake bar none! I read many of the reviews. Some changes I made were: I used 1 1/4 cup sugar for the cake, added 1 tab. Droste cocoa and eliminated 1 tab.of the flour amount. For the frosting: I use 1 1/4 cup sugar, toasted the pecans and used 1/2 t. vanilla and eliminated the almond extract. Next time I will try using only 1 cup sugar in the frosting. I used a metal baking dish and an oven thermometer. When reading the recipe, I felt 1 hour baking might be too long. I baked the cake for 50 minutes and it was over-baked a little. Next time I will test it after 45 minutes. In the future, this will be the only German Chocolate Cake I will make...it is so delicious!

I just made this cake last night and followed directions. I am not thrilled wiht the cake itself- it fell in the center and would not recommend adding chocolate chips to the batter. I thought they made the cake too rich. The frosting was great with one exception, it needs a healthy pinch of salt. Otherwise it is overwhelmingly sweet. A little bit of salt perfects it. I still only used half of the frosting and plan on using the rest on another cake recipe.

I made this for my mom's birthday knowing she loves german chocolate cake. However, I did my own take on it because my local grocery store didn't have Baker's German chocolate. If this happens to you, here's what I did. I used regular baking chocolate in the cake and stirred coconut into some regular chocolate frosting that I bought. When I made the frosting originally, it didn't go quite as planned. However, everybody raved about it and it was even better the next day after being left out. This cake is amazing and I look forward to making it again!

My husband has had German Chocolate Cake for every one of his many birthdays. This year I made this recipe--all other recipes will now be ignored. I did change the all-German chocolate to 4 oz. of German and 2 oz. of dark baking chocolate. As others, I didn't want to be left with 2 oz. of German chocolate and it seems to only come in 4 oz. boxes. Other than that, I changed nothing. The cake was moist and perfect. I have a friend who is married to a professional bakery chef and I would be proud to serve this to her.

My first ever German Chocolate cake! Used semisweet chocolate instead of german sweet chocolate, used unrefined sugar instead of granulated sugar. The most important thing, my cake was done in 45 minutes. I put it in for additional 5 minutes just in case, but 45 minutes would have been fine because it could have been a little less crumbly. For the frosting, I only made half: used 2 egg yolks, only 1/4 chopped pecans, and actually added maybe 1/3 cup of chocolate chips to make the frosting a bit chocolatey also. I will definitely make this cake again - cook it for 45 minutes and make it in a round pan, flip when done, frost the top and the sides!

this cake was very moist and wonderful. the only thing i would change is to only use about 1/2 of the frosting. it was too thick and overwhelming...good but overwhelming. i think less is better so you can taste the cake.

This recipe is a keeper. I made several modifications. First, I cut the recipe in half (baked in an 8x8 pan, used 2 egg yolks in the frosting). Second, with a baby underfoot and a lack of enough clean bowls, I decided to put the eggs in whole. The result probably wasn't as fluffy as it would have been but it was still pretty darn fluffy and exceptionally moist. The cake was fantastic and it hardly took me any time at all. Will try with separated eggs one of these days but it doesn't seem like the whole eggs hurt the cake much.

The very, very best German Chocolate cake, ever. I made the following modifications: I used a darker chocolate for the cake. I omitted all chocolate chips. Sometimes this cake falls, but I make it at least 2-3 times a year and it is always "the best Geman chocoalte cake" anyone's ever eate.

I just made the frosting. But I used 1/2 evap. milk and 1/2 regular milk. I think it turned out perfectly that way. I let it cool for while before putting it on the cake. And judged the thickness by running my finger over the back of a wooden spoon dipped in. Didn't use choc. chips and used pecans instead of almonds. Awesome!

Wonderful! With some minor adjustments recommended by previous reviewers  thank you. Not wanting to be stuck with 1/2 bar of Baker's Sweet Chocolate, I bought one of their German's Sweet Chocolate Bars (4 oz) and used (2 oz) of some 70% chocolate I had in the pantry. For the frosting, I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar (instead of 1 1/2) and added 1/2 a teaspoon vanilla along with the extract. Many commented on the thickness of the frosting so when removed it from the heat I stirred in 2 Tablespoons of heavy cream to loosen it and temper the sweetness. I skipped the chocolate chips in the cake and in the frosting - not needed. Make sure to use a METAL 9x13 inch instead of glass. Go to Williams-Sonoma and invest in a good pan  you will use it forever. Make this cake! The lucky recipients will be licking their plates and forks.

This cake was moist and delicious! I followed the previous reviewer's recommendation and substituted one tablespoon of Ghiradelli cocoa for part of the flour, which gave it a nice rich flavor. I used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips over the batter before baking. This cake also had a wonderful light texture. I was surprised how high it rose and that it kept its height even after it cooled. There wasn't enough room between the cake and the top of the pan for all the frosting! I took it to the office and got great compliments from all. Highly recommended recipe.

Not being a fan of Baker's brand German's Sweet Chocolate, I substituted 6 ounces (two 3-ounce bars) of Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate. I also substituted 1 tablespoon of Pernigotti cocoa (available at Williams-Sonoma) for one tablespoon of the flour. The chocolate substitutions made all the difference. Scharffen Berger is a richer and slightly darker milk chocolate with caramel undertones that compliment the frosting. I also omitted the chocolate chips. With these changes, I'd give the cake four stars. Otherwise, it's too sweet and somewhat ordinary. This cake can also be baked as two 9" inch layers, providing the pans are also 2" deep (many cake pans are only 1.5" deep) or three 8" layers. Spread the frosting/topping between the layers and on top - no need to frost the sides.

Great cake, amazing frosting. I toasted the pecans lightly before adding to frosting--sublime. I baked in 2- 10 inch cake pans and there was still a bit too much batter--I filled each pan half way and then made about 6 muffins (filled 1/3 each). It took about 40 minutes to bake the cake layers. While the frosting does make a lot, it was not quite enough to fully frost a layer cake--I should have made an extra 1/2 recipe so that I would have some to spare instead of just barely covering the cake. Next time I would also add some cocoa or something--the cake wasn't quite as chocolatey as I would have liked. Also, I might try to melt the extra cup of chips with the chocolate in the beginning instead of floating them in the cake. I used regular flour, but although I used an electric mixer for the butter/sugar, I mixed the flour mixture with a spatula so it wouldn't be tough.

I make this for my dad every year for his birthday and it is his absolute favorite. That's saying a lot since he is a gourmet chef who used to own a restaurant here! I don't do much to alter the recipe except that I make it a 3-layer cake and use unsweetened coconut. For presentation, I rim the top edge with raspberries and fill in the center with the chocolate chips and include a 3-raspberry plus leaf design in the very center. It is beautiful and delicious.

Rating: 3
The flavor of both the cake and icing (with some sugar reduction) was very good. I do agree that I would simmer the icing just a little bit less, so it's not so firm when it sets. I have a question about the cake texture. Mine was so soft (because of egg whites?) that when I made it as a 2 9" layer cake, the slices fell apart and did not make a pretty presentation. I used the all-purpose flour per the recipe, no cake flour. It was soft and moist but it just didn't hold together. Any suggestions? I will try again and let you know.

Good German chocolate cake recipe. Used semi-sweet Ghiradelli and added 1/4 cup cocoa powder that resulted in a not-too-sweet (but chocolatey)cake so that sweet frosting complimented the cake nicely. Had no problems with the frosting---allow at least 2 hours for it to set before serving. Worth making again.

I made this cake in two round cake pans,cutting back on the sugar and omitting the choc chips as suggested by other reviewers. I found the cake to be quite moist but there wasn't enough chocolate flavour for my taste. Next time I will add 1/4 cup cocoa. I agree with comments about the frosting being too much. This cake can stand alone with just a dollop of thickened cream or marscapone and a handful of fresh berries to garnish.

Rating: 4
This is a very delicious, moist cake. I also substituted the sweet chocolate with bittersweet. I agree with a previous post that the cake would stand by itself without the frosting! (Although the coconut frosting is very delicious as well, it seems to compete with the cake.) This may become my main chocolate cake recipe.

Rating: 4
Unbelievably luscious cake. Keep on whipping that butter and sugar, and do the same for the egg whites. I used a metal pan, no problem. I used salted butter, no problem. I used Giradelli chocolate for the cake itself, and dark chocolate chips. The last time I made it I didn't even use frosting and it was so delicious, I could actually taste the cake. Remember to use great quality vanilla, it makes a difference. For leftovers I heated the cake, split a piece and drizzled Cajeta (or caramel sauce) and some vanilla icecream. Delicioso. Truly a good cake and I am very difficult to please.

I'm not much of a cake person and German Chocolate Cake has always been too sweet for me. I halved the sugar content of the recipe (for cake and for frosting) and substituted two baker's unsweetened squares for two of the german sweet chocolate squares. It was a huge success, particularly because everyone was surprised it wasn't too sweet. The birthday "boy" loved it.

Delicious! I cut the sweetness a bit by using semi-sweet chocolate, using 1 2/3 c. sugar in the cake and 1 1/4 c. sugar in the frosting. I baked it in a 9x13 pan and cut it in 15 squares, which were plenty big enough, the cake rises quite high. I made it the day before I served it, and the frosting had set, so it was not "messy" as a previous reviewer had posted.

Call me crazy, but this recipe didn't work well for me. Seems that the choc chips fell to the bottom of the cake and burned on the glass bottom, leaving brown charred bits. The cake was dry, has to cut the edges off as it seemed burned despite cooking one hour. Salvaged it somewhat for an event, but barely. Make the frosting, dcelicious, just use another cake recipe.

The frosting was delicious and easy to make -- a little time consumming, but well worth it. Might try it with unsweetened coconut next time but it really was great as is. I used mini chocolate chips on top. You don't really notice the taste so may cut them out next time. Can't say anything about the cake, though it sounds wonderful -- I love buttermilk. I used the cake from the inside out german chocolate cake from this website in place of this one because of the lower fat content. It was rich and delicious, by the way.

Whatever you do, DO NOT try to make these as muffins. I did and forget that the egg whites would cause the cake to puff up. So when I opened the oven, I had several pans overflowing with cake!

Absolutely delicious!!! I didn't have a big enough glass pan, so I made this as a 9-inch layered cake (2 layers). I substituted half of the butter in the batter with applesauce. Since hubby didn't like coconut, I made the frosting without coconut and nuts, and then frosted the one layer of the cake, sprinkled chopped nuts on it, frosted the rest, and sprinkled nuts on side and part of the top of cake. Then, I toasted coconut flakes, and sprinkled them on the rest of the top. This cake was absolutely divine, I'll certainly make it again and again and again!

Excellent tasting cake. Make sure you use a 13x9-inch pan. Sometimes when I'm making cakes, I use a smaller pan (11x7 or 12x8). I really love this frosting. Even if you don't like the cake (which I did), you could still use the frosting for a cake that you loved. I thought the cake would be dry, seeing it was used butter instead of oil or shortening, but was surprised that it came out moist. Takes some time to make though. Make sure you have lots of time.

This recipe yields enough batter for three 8" or 9" round cake pans if you want to make a layer cake. You can use the frosting between the layers and on top of the cake; be generous, and then you can leave the sides of the cake naked, which is what we did. If it looks too raggedy, I would suggest making a VERY LIGHT buttercream frosting for the side, and then pressing chopped pecans into it. Also, next time I plan to toast the coconut first, to add another layer of taste to balance out the richness. This is incredibly rich. The person I made it for was a German chocolate cake addict and he was totally off his dot over it. The cake by itself is absolutely delicious... silky texture, a lot of body yet light in the mouth. It would be dynamite baked in a bundt pan with a rum glaze drizzled over it, for a less rich dessert.

This recipe converted me into a german chocolate cake lover! (I usually find them too sweet.) The frosting was so good, it took all my will-power not to eat the excess with a spoon. The frosting recipe made about 1/3 more than was needed to generously cover the top of the cake. I wanted the cake to look especially pretty, so I frosted just the top, and iced the sides with a shiny ganache. I decorated the edges with chocolate buttercream rosettes, and pecan halves. Since I planned to use so much extra chocolate on the decorative icing, I omitted the chocolate chips in both the cake and the frosting. I also used unsweetened coconut flakes from the health food store instead of the sweetened coconut called for in the frosting--I think this keep the frosting from getting too sweet for my liking.
