This recipe is outstanding. I was able to find sake kasu in the refrigerator section of a Japanese market near the miso products. I had to buy a bag of it that was the size of a basketball (and the recipe calls for just 1/2 cup) -- no joke. But it was only $2.99 so I went ahead and got it. The young guy at the store said, "oh you must be making a fish marinade." Sake kasu is NOTHING like sake -- so I would not think sake would be an acceptable substitute. I am going to make this again, without the sake kasu, and see if it compromises the flavors. The green curry sauce was delicious but I agree it can overpower the delicate flavors of the fish. I also used halibut because it was fresh and sea bass was not currently available. Served with Forbidden Rice with roasted cubed Kaboocha squash mixed in with the rice.

First a confession: I've been using Epicurious for well over a year now without creating an account. Now you know how good this dish was that I had to create one just to rate it. I used barley miso instead of white and just plain old sake instead of sake-kasu. If it makes a big difference, I couldn't tell, plus I had sake to drink during the meal. I let the fish marinate for 4 hours. The coconut green curry sauce is an absolute must. To make it slightly healthier, I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk and just let it reduce longer. Served this with jasmine rice, which I mixed the leftover coconut milk in with the water to make, per another user's suggestion (3/4 cup coconut milk, 1 cup water for 1 cup rice). Absolutely divine and certainly not too rich.

I searched everywhere in the Montreal, area for sake kasu (to no avail). However, I substituted the sake kasu with Mitoku Rice Malt. Excellent! Also, due to a late decision to postpone this meal until the next day, I ended up marinating this dish for 1 1/2 days. It turned out absolutely beautiful. So don't over-think or worry about how long to marinate (as can be the case with other marinades). I agree with other postings as well that the recommended accompaniment of the Coconut Green Curry Sauce was over the top. I added it (sparingly) to the rice and it was more than enough. The Coconut Curry just pushes the otherwise wonderfully rich, yet balanced, combinations past the 'great' point. There is indeed such a thing as too much of a good thing. Wonderful without it, I'll skip it completely next time. BTW: This plate pairs beautifully with a quality White Bordeaux. Gorgeous.

Loved this!! I used wild halibut because Chilean sea bass is hard to find and over $30.00 per pound. I could not find sake kasu and used regular sake--the coconut green curry sauce made the dish. I made this once without the sauce and it isn't nearly as good. Restaurant quality recipe!!

A huge hit with my guests who were raving about the flavours weeks later. Served with basmati cooked with half water/half coconut milk. Moulded the rice. Surrounded the rice,fish and snowpeas with sauce. Garnished with fresh coriander...very pretty.

OUTSTANDING. We love Chilean Sea Bass and my husband thought I was "ruining" the fish by marinading it (I usually just autoroast the fillets with a sprinkling of Creole seasoning). Once he tasted it, however, he promised to never question my cooking again! It truly is delicious. Not sure what sake kasu is so I just use sake. I find the green curry sauce to be too much flavor for the fish, but I like it spooned over jasmine rice as an accompaniment instead.

I found sake kasu in the refrigerator section of a Japanese market. It is a solid white/beige paste kept near the miso products. I prefer this over regular sake because it makes the marinade thicker so it coats the fish better.

The flavor of this dish is amazing. I adjusted this recipe for only two servings and was wishing I hadn't because we wanted more. Forget trying to find Sake Kasu. The asian market thought I was nuts. I found one online source, but there was a $50 minimum purchase. Don't worry, it's very good without it.

The fish is fabulous. I made my own version of lower fat Coconut Green Curry Sauce. The fish works well even alone!

My only tips are to watch your reduction portions and wilt a few basil leaves in the sauce just a few minutes before serving. You can place this on top of the fish for some color. Serve with brown jasmine rice, and garlic/crushed red pepper baby broccoli. Total PHENOM.

So when I asked all my coworkers where I could buy sakekasu, they called me crazy, acted like I had just asked if Buddha lives down the street from me, or exclaimed, "Only old people eat that!" Determined, I scoured the supermarket for it and even asked a clerk if it was stocked, to no avail. So much for being able to buy it at a Japanese market. I ended up using a strong sake (not cooking sake) and it turned out pretty well. I'm not a huge fan of miso but this marinade didn't have a strong miso taste to it.

Excellent dish! We used fresh albacore for the fish (my husband just got back from a fishing trip) and it was simply outstanding. We too passed on the oven to control doneness. Restaurant quality, simple to prepare ... whats not to like?

Perfect company dish - with most of the work being done ahead of time. You can rely on the recipe as written. The only change I made was to use fresh cod. We decided to omit the baking part and cook the fish on stove top so we could control the doneness. Do not try to substitute kasu with plain sake - the kasu has the pungent flavor that keeps the dish from becoming too sweet. Leftover kasu can be frozen for 6 months or so. The flavor is delicate, the sauce divine. I served it with jasmine rice (perfect with sauce) and Chinese long beans.

I would say this is awesome too! I used red curry paste instead of green. No Sea Bass at the market so I used halibut...great!

All I can say is, AWESOME. I made this for my gourmet club and it was a hit. All I could find was frozen bass, which is always a little mushy. I couldn't believe how impressed the guests were. I served it w/steamed snow peas and wasabi mashed potatoes.

I use salmon as a substitute and I broiled it in the oven. Quite a flavorful recipe and tastes wonderful too. I make extra to use the next day in a salad - it is spectacular!

This is a fabulous fish recipe. I have noticed that this style of marinade is on the menu at many of the hot pan-Asian and Asian-influenced restaurants. I substitute Black Cod for Chilean Sea Bass and serve it without the curry. It's spectacular. Be sure to marinate it at least 3 days.

We served this dish, with the curry sauce, for an anniversary dinner party for 14. It was an excellent dish that got rave reviews from all of our guests. We were a bit skeptical about marinating fish for so long, but we did it anyway and were very pleased with the results. We will be making this again!

My cooking club made it this evening with halibut and the results were fantastic. We added some of the marinade into the skillet when we moved it from stovetop to oven and the result was incredibly moist fish. Other than that we followed the recipe religiously and the results were phenomenal. I'd definitely make it again.

Please Do not cook Chilean Sea Bass. As a Chef and Buyer, I know that chili Bass is way over fished, and northern halibut is Just as Good. Also ther are many Types of alternative fish. Finally, All Chilean Sea Bass is frozen at Sea. The Fisherman stay out for weeks at a time and the fish will spoil if it is not frozen. So, not only is the fish very expensive, but it is not even fresh. Please do not serve chilean Sea Bass

I haven't made this recipe, yet, but I will be sure to substitute Chilean Sea Bass with Striped Sea Bass. I'm with Chapple Hill and I am appalled at such ignorance and greed as displayed by Spokane.

This is a really delicious recipe and very easy to make. I made it for a New Years Eve dinner party and everyone loved it. The ingrediants were a little more difficult to find unless you have an asian market near you which I did. I highly suggest making this recipe you will not be dissapointed.

The marinade works on a variety of fish so substitution is very easy. For those really concerned about price and fish environment farmed catfish was excellent in this recipe. The fish handled being marinated overnight very well. You do not need the curry sauce though that is very nice but it is well worth it to do the marinade. You can use regular sake and even commercial varieties of mirin with no ill effects. I would recommend straining the curry for the sake of your guests and the sauce freezes well for later use. It was a very popular dish at a party that I had thrown recently even with so many other main courses. Also, try the fish with a nice chutney such as green apple for some added texture and flavor.

I can't believe the sheer ignorance and irresponsibility of people like Spokane. Type in "Chilean sea bass" in any search engine and read up on the issue. Many top US restaurants have boycotted Chilean sea bass because of the severe shortage. You don't have to use Chilean sea bass in a recipe if you can make appropriate substitutions (e.g., striped bass), which would probably also save you money.

I just saw this recipe today and it sounds really delicious! I also saw the comments from the person at Fall City, WA., whining about the availability of sea bass in the next 5 years. Many of you know that sea bass has a sweet, firm texture that stands up to flavors like curry. I'm going to go out of my way to buy up all the sea bass that I can get before it's gone and make sure that I enjoy it to the max. Yum! At $12.99 a pound, if y'all can afford it, why not enjoy it? Meanwhile I'm sure that the old sea bass will be around 100 years from now.

Chilean sea bass is rapidly becoming an extinct species. A better alternative is cod or halibut, which are more sustainably harvested fish. Unless demand for chilean sea bass declines, estimates suggest that it may be commercially extinct within 5 years!

It is an easy and elegant fish for a dinner party. I transfered the fish to a different dish into the oven. The Green curry sauce is remarkable. Served with Asian Cole Slaw, Greenbeans sauted in soy sauce, brown sugar and toasted seaseme seeds and finally jasmine rice. Wow!

So simple, yet elegant. Also served with Wasabi mash and sauteed green brassica with garlic. Didn't even bother with the green curry sauce after reading Jan 02 Gourmet issue. It is fabulous without the sauce. I used regular Sake instead of Sake-kasu. I will serve this again!!!

Other than the fact that NONE of the Japanese markets in Hong Kong have sake-kasu, this recipe is fantastic. Can't wait to try it again once I can get some sake-kasu. The fish comes out really delicate and is beautifully complemented by the green coconut curry sauce, although it is also fine on its own.

Used Chilian Sea Bass, omitted the Sake Kasu and was VERY pleased with the results. Can't even begin to imagine that Sea Bass was tough, as one reviewer commented. Must have been cooked WAY too long

Made the recipe without the coconut green curry sauce and I don't think it was missing a thing. Marinated the fish over night, which really enhanced the flavor. Served with stir fried baby carrots and snow peas and basmati and it was a hit with the company.

I was intrigued by the Thai/Japanese influences in this recipe and looking forward to preparing it. Chilean sea bass is one of our favs and we thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. A bonus that it was so easy to prepare. There is only one tweak that I will make next time. I marinated the fish for 5 hours and found that it made it a little too sweet for my taste so I would either reduce the mirin to 1/2 c., or omit the brown sugar. I started out with 3 - 12oz. pieces of fish and ate only half because along with the heavenly richness of the sauce, it was overload! Served with coconut steamed jasmine rice and a medly of stir-fried vegetables with oyster sauce. Will try with halibut also.

Excellent recipe for a delicious fish. I would urge some of the other reveiewers to give Chilean Sea Bass another try. Perhaps it wasn't cooked properly. The fish most definitly needs to be seared in order to seal in the moisture and then should be finished off in the oven. This is the common procudre for cooking this fish, not just in this recipe. The fish should have large, moist flakes.

Rating: 3
Sauce was very good but I must have overcooked the expensive sea bass since it was a bit tough. Will try halibut next time and I agree with another cook, I would cook it entirely on stove or in oven. Disappointed with the sea bass, but would be an amazing dish with a tender fish (properly cooked...).

The fermented flavor of the sake kasu was a bit overpowering...I would prefer to substitute it with 1/4 c. sake. I used the black cod instead of the sea bass and got great results. Marinating it for two days enhanced the flavor.

I used Chilean Sea Bass, and it was very good. Don't think you need to sear fish. Next time I'll just put in the oven.Didn't use the curry sauce. I think the recipe in BA 1/00 maybe a bit better tasting, but still no complaints here.

I used Chilean sea bass for this recipe as directed and I can only say that is one OVER rated fish. It was mushy, and expensive! I rated it a 3 fork because the flavor of the sauce was excellent. I think next time I will use either halibut as the others did, or may a white sea bass.

This dish was succulent, mouth-watering and quite rich. I loved it. We made it with halibut instead of sea bass. We also used regular sake. We did marinate it for 2 days. This time we'll try marinating it for half an hour and see if it's as good. My guests loved it too- they were quiet through most of the dish except for the occasional "mmmm" and sighs of bliss.
