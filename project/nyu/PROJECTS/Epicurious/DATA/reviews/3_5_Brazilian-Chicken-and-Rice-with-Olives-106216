I can't remember if I've rated this dish before but I have now made it many many times and it's requested often. I am only back here as my son is making this for a date tonight and wanted his own copy of the recipe. I double the recipe and usually toss in a little extra liquid. I think it's very tasty for such a quick meal. I find yellow rice pretty dry. A cuban friend adds a very small amount of mayo and now I do that too. Maybe a 1/2 tsp per 2 cups of rice, just enough to make it moist without the taste of mayo.

Rating: 3
With a few changes I would rate this 4 forks. The favors are amazing. Hiwever, my modifications are as follow: as is, the recipe serves three people a dinner size portion. Double everything! Also, use fresh squeezed oj. I found that using three oranges was a nice balance to the saltiness of the olives. It really is very delicious with a lovely presentation. Enjoy!

I used Mahatma yellow rice. I did not like this dish very much and was undecided whether to give it 1 or 2 forks. I think my reason for not liking it is because of the packaged rice I used. I also used chicken breast (not thighs); thighs would have been better.

Rating: 4
OK, I made a couple changes. This was wonderful. I used the whole package of rice and adjusted the oj/broth accordingly. I used chicken broth instead of water. My famly would squeel over olives, which I would love, so I used capers and some jarred red pimento. OUTSTANDING. This was received very well by even my 8 yo. I was already requested to make it again. Very tasty indeed! =o)

Rating: 4
I give this 4 stars because it was a perfect weeknight meal that took little time and had interesting flavors. I used Basmati rice, chicken stock instead of water, and I bumped up the OJ to 1 cup. I couldn't find fresh pimiento-stuffed Spanish olives, so I used another type of spicy Spanish olive, which was perfect. Next time I will add a seeded jalapeno and a small handful of raisins. The leftovers were even tastier.

Rating: 3
This is a quick easy dinner and very good. I used half chicken stock and half orange juice as suggested by other reviewers. I also added chopped onion, raisins and slivered almonds. Quick, easy and tasty. Next time I'll use fewer olives or maybe substitute capers.

This is the perfect recipe for busy chefs...I am a private chef with very little time. Brazilian Chicken &Rice w/Olives~ is simple to feed our tourists with~ or for an intimate dinner at home. It was simple to make~ and to embellish. To the chef who created it, four forks!!!!

Excellent. Not authentic, but good nonetheless. I used a mixture of bone-in and boneless chicken and it ended up overcooking just a touch, but the other flavors were so nice that it didn't ruin the dish.

Agree with other reviewers to use the amount of liquid called for on the rice box - in my case 2 cups. Thought this dish was okay. I bought cheap-o jarred olives; it'd probably be much better with good, fresh olives. Don't skimp!

Very tasty dish, I just change the rice in a heavy rice pot saute 1/2 sweet onion and 2 cloves minced garlic in 1/4 cup butter till tender add 1 cup white long grain rice1/2 cup brown rice saute 2 min add 1 pack of Sazon Goya with coriander & annatto add 1 cup chicken broth and 2 cups water( hot) heat in microwave cook covered 20 min add cilantro. put chicken mixture over the rice on a serving platter.This cuts down on the salt. Note most Brasilian dishes are very salty to the American pallet

Rating: 4
Omg, SO good! I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and used chicken broth instead of water, added raisins and (seeded) jalapeno, and rinsed the olives (to reduce saltiness). I served it with the recommended salad and cornbread. Perfect... we were licking the pan!

This dish was ok, not sure I'd make it again. I used low-sodium chicken broth, did not salt the chicken and it still came out way too salty (FWIW, I Used Zatarain's brand yellow rice). Would recommend NOT replacing the water w/ chicken broth.

Absolute hit! I took comments to heart, added onions and more garlic. Also, used 1 cup OJ/1 cup chicken broth and regular long-grain rice with a 1/4 tsp tumeric for color. Chicken breasts instead of thighs. Delicious!

I've been making this one for years with the following tweaks: Use amount of liquid called for on rice pack, 1/2 orange juice 1/2 water. And I have always marinated the chicken in the garlic/zest for a few hours which really pumps up the flavor. Easy, with bright latin flavors!

Rating: 4
This is a winner. The rice mix is salty, so no need to sprinkle chicken with salt. I bumped up the water and OJ by 1/4 cup each. Also, 1 cup of cilantro sounds like a lot - trust me, it is not too much.

This was very easy, and with other reviewers' additions of broth instead of water, onion, raisins, and almonds it was delicious. I think using plain rice is better - the flavors are good enough on their own without prepackaged spice packets added.

I made this dish last night and my picky husband loved it ( so did I ). I served it with homemade corn bread. The only thing I had to do differently was to add 1/2 cup more water and 1/2 cup more orange juice to the cooking rice mixture. Otherwise, I found this a very easy and delicious recipe. I will definately make it again.

Seriously loved this dish, and my boyfriend told me (and his mom!) that it is one of his favorite things... ever. I used extra garlic, reduced fat/sodium chicken broth instead of water, a whole cup of fresh squeezed orange juice, chicken breasts, extra olives, a chile pepper and a jalepeno. used Goya yellow rice. The chicken was perfectly cooked as were the rest of the ingredients. I served it with corn bread (awesome) and added chopped chile peppers to that as well. Also served with steamed spinach. This or some variation of this will probably become an easy weekly dinner.

Rating: 4
I get rave reviews and requests for this all the time. I made a few changes...add in fresh sliced jalapeno's when you put in the cilantro for a little kick. Also I couldn't find the yellow rice so I used a rice pilaf mix (far east brand) with almond slivers for a bit of crunch. Make sure to use fresh squeezed oranges! The corn bread side dish is a must.

This is a great dish, but use some common sense. Your dish will not be better than the sum of its parts, so if your yellow rice mix is no good.... Mahatma saffron yellow rice works well. Made as written, with the following changes/suggestions: chicken breast instead of thighs, lots of garlic and chopped green olives(more than called for), 1 cup OJ and 1 cup chicken broth, and monitor the rice to see if it needs more liquid. This dish always comes out excellent. Perfect for a quick and easy weeknight meal.

Use all juice (fresh squeezed) and add water towards end of cooking time to keep rice from sticking. I have made this several times for weekday entertaining--easy, but pleasing and festive. Serve with sauted garlic and collard greens for a real Brazialian plate. So good.....

I made this dish for a camp. Yellow rice packages are not easy to find here and quite expensive when one does. Therefor i used tumeric to make the rice yellow along with onion and garlic. I also used chicken breasts cooked with the rice. The chicken came out dry. I served the dish with a salad and the corn bread. The kids liked it but the adults raved and wanted the recipe. Next time I will make it with veggies and leave out the meat.

Rating: 4
I have been making this recipe for quite some time "as is", and, the other night I decided to add about 1/2 cup of chopped jalepenos to the mixture (I added it with the olives). I didn't think this recipe could be improved upon, but, the jalepenos make this dish extraordinary. Granted, it's a matter of taste . . . but, if you like heat, you won't be disappointed. To take it even further, serve it with some tabasco/hot sauce. Awesome.

I was about half in the bag from sipping on some good old "Bookers" (small batch bourbon) all the live long day with a few friends....we also had some left-handed cigarettes as an accompanment :) ANYWAY....I misread/forgot/spaced 1/2 cup orange JUICE and used 1/2 cup orange CONCENTRATE.........it came out very orange and DEEEEEEEEELICIOUS!!!

I thought this was a good weeknight, one pot dish because it was flavorful and easy. I used chicken breast instead of thigh and thought that if cooked according to the instructions, the chicken came out a little dry. Maybe this wouldn't have happened with the thigh meat that has a higher fat content? Also, I bet you could substitute the orange with a combination of orange, lemon and lime.

I have made this twice and my husband and I (who don't always share the same opinion on food) really like it. I followed the recipe but used only 2 TBS oil as suggested by previous reviews.

The best part is that it is very easy to make. A definite keeper!

It occurs to me that whether or not you like theis dish (soooo easy) might depend on the kind of yellow-rice mix you use. There are some that are chemical garbage and some that are just like homemade. My suggestion would be to try again with a more high-end mix. Near East makes a good one, and I'll bet there are others even better.

i make this dish very often, it is always great, although my friend from Sao Pauolo Brazil has never seen anything like it, so I am not sure why it is called Brazilian. For previous reviews- If your rice comes out too dry, its your own fault, not the recipes. Add chicken stock or water.

It's always fun to try a new recipe as this was but and I stress BUT I wouldn't recommend wasting time or ingredients making this one. The rice was dry and not much flavor to the whole recipe. It wasn't awful but not as nice as hundreds of recipes from this site are. Instead I would recommend trying "Sauteed chicken w/tomatos, olives with feta" or "Penne with chicken, arugla, roasted tomatoes and feta".

Rating: 2
I never use packet mixes of any kind because of the chemical element, so I improvised here. I used tumeric, saffron, cumin, chicken stock, cayenne pepper and chopped coriander (cilantro), parsley and chives from my own garden, but still this dish lacked flavour. I would make it again however but with some changes. I'd replace the orange with lemon & add some onion, chili and go a bit heavier on the herbs.

I tried this recipe and found that the dish came out very yellow! My kids didn't want to eat it just because of the color (and my kids generally aren't picky). I also found that the olives added a lot of saltiness. Other than that, the dish didn't have much flavor.

I agree with the cook from Manhattan. Though I love olives, they were strange in this dish. Also, this was salty.

I used Goya Yellow Rice Spanish Style mix. The color was beautiful. The flavor was good but I found it too salty (and I didn't salt the chicken as directed in the recipe). I would omit the olives (a shame because I love olives) next time and add frozen peas instead. Love the fact that it is a one pot meal. The fresh cilantro makes the dish. Will make this recipe again with modifcations.

We all liked it--and I've got a couple of real picky eaters. I made a few adjustments to give it a little more flavor, but I skipped the olives. I also added a little hot sauce when I cooked the chicken. The juice I had on hand--was Dole's peach-mango-orange. I also added toasted slivered almonds and dried cranberries. The orange sections fanned on the plate was a nice touch (trimmed from membranes). I made fruit pizzas for dessert to go with. Used flour tortillas, baked 8-10 minutes at 400 degrees with pam, sugar, cinnamon. Then cream cheese base (add a little sugar and milk). Then assortment of fresh fruit and brush orange marmalade on top--next time I'll drizzle chocolate ganache on these as well. My 16 year old son would have preferred whipped cream as opposed to cream cheese base. Delightful meal! And so easy!

FYI...To ensure tender, fluffy rice, the correct liquid to rice ration is 2x liquid to 1x rice. OJ counts as part of the liquid. Note to earlier reviewer: Shouldn't matter what cookware you use. I have All-Clad also and haven't had your problem.

I have made this several times and my husband and I really enjoy it. Each time I have a little trouble with the ratio of liquid to rice and end up adding more liquid,but I never take the time to write down the difference on my recipe.

This is a great weeknight diss...nothing fancy but quite tasty!

Good, but not great. I made a few changes to try to spark it up. Added two strips of bacon, and cooked the chicken in the bacon fat. Added some red pepper for color, some dried appricots and used 2 cups chicken broth instead of water. I used only one half cup of cilantro instead of one cup as it seemed like too much when I began to add it. If I make it again, I'll probably add some onion and a pinch of red pepper flakes to spark it up. I know, this is one of those reviews where it is changed and not given great reviews, but I think my changes helped.

Once again my husband and I fail to agree on how to rate a recipe. He really liked the salty - vinegary effect of the green olives (3 Forks).

I think it needs a big salad or some vegetables on the side to balance it out.

This is very good and easy. I used boneless chicken breasts, rather than chicken thighs. Also added raisins, as others have. The next time I think I'll add more orange juice. Also, I think it would be nice to put diced orange sections on top of the dish before serving, to add a refreshing citrus taste to an otherwise pretty salty dish.

This is quick and easy, and tastes good too. I didn't happen to have any rice packages on hand, I usually have Vigo, so I used a cup of rice and substituted chicken broth for the water and added a package of Sazon Goya. I also used chicken thighs with bone as we prefer them. I used only a very small amount of olive oil, just barely coating the bottom of the pan, as the chicken thighs with bone usually have some fat. It worked just fine, but the Vigo would have been quicker. The orange flavor really picks this dish up.
