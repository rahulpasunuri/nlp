Made this for a grilled lamb roast for my husband and I. We used the leftover lamb and salsa verde in pita pockets later in the week. We then used the salsa verde with broiled fish. It worked great every time.

Fantastic-quick, easy and extremely flavorful. Can't wait to make this again.

This is a great condiment for steak and the leftovers can be mixed in with orzo for a fabulous salad!
