Love it. I used balsamic vinegar, and doubled the cumin because I love cumin. I bet this would be good with brussels sprouts as well.

I give this recipe 2 and a half forks (between "good" and "delicious"). It is a nice variation for broccoli. I thought the recipe makes too much vinaigrette - I used just over half of it to coat the broccoli.

I LOVED the Rasin Vinaigrette. Instead of broccoli I used broccolini and added some asparagus spears aswell. Some may have found the broccolini to be a bit chewy but the flavors of the vinaigrette were a perfect balance of sweet and savory on top of the vegetables.

I liked this recipe. My husband thought that the vinaigrette was a bit overpowering, but I did not. Our broccoli was not tough, either.

I liked the roasted broccoli and the vinaigrette was a nice change of pace from the usual. Will definitely make this again.

I did not love this dish. I agree that the roastd broccoli was not pleasant, but was rather tough, and the flavors/textures together were just strange. I threw out more than we ate.

Broccoli roasts beautifully. I used craisins. My husband, who usually prefers salty to sweet, ate 3 helpings!! Easy and quick to prepare. Looked great on the plate. Will try this with dinner guests - the color,texture and flavor were wonderful.

It's hard to say why I didn't like this recipe. The tangy-sweet vinaigrette was good but seemed to overpower the broccoli. Also, broccoli doesn't seem to be a dish that roasts exceptionally well.

I liked the vinaigrette, but would recommend tossing the broccoli with less oil than the amount in the recipe.
