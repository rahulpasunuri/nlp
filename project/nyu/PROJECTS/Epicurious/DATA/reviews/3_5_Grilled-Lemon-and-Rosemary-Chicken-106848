This has become a staple for me; it's so easy and reliable that I use it for an everyday dish, but also good enough to fix for guests. I have both rosemary and lemons growing in my yard so the result is very fresh despite the bottled dressing.

I've made this several times, using on occasion balsamic or raspberry vinaigrettes. I also toss the two end caps of the lemon into the marinade. If you want to leave this to marinate while you are at work, I suggest not pounding the chicken breasts, they'll stand the marinade longer without drying.

We really liked this dish - the bottled salad dressing did not hold us back. It was quick and easy and tasted great! I will keep it on file for entertaining the endless guests that come through our summer home.

For something so quick and easy, this is surprisingly delicious (even with the bottled dressing-couldn't resist getting that comment into the controversy!). When spouse and child rave as if I'd spent hours in prep, you know it's gonna be a repeat.

A great recipe if you're looking for something tasty, as well as quick and easy to prepare. I don't usually have fresh herbs on hand and have made this frequently with dried rosemary, and it still comes out great. It's also super versatile; besides serving with grilled veggies as suggested in the recipe, I've also used this to accompany salad, as pizza topping or an ingredient in gratins, casseroles and sandwiches, and even paired it with another recipe from this site (Penne with Broiled Veggies and Feta Cheese; a great combination). Don't be turned off by the bottled Italian dressing the recipe calls for. My first reaction when I saw this was to pass it up, but I'm glad I gave it a try (BTW, I use Ken's Lite Italian Dressing).

I found this recipe to be very easy. In fact I even made my own salad dressing (got the suggestion from another review). In our home we prefur hotter food. So I added some red peppers, garlic, and added some various dry spices in my cabinet. All and all would make it again, it just needs some tender loving care before you grill it.

Nice and simple, and fantastic. We all loved it, bottled dressing and all. Some of those complaining about the bottled dressing - do you realize this magazine has a small segment towards the end called 'Too Busy to Cook'? And that this recipe came from there? It's supposed to be instead of takeout. I think the addition of the fresh rosemary was enough of a gourmet touch for a busy weeknight meal, and it did make a difference.

I used a bottled vinaigrette and added some fresh garlic. The chicken marinated for about an hour and cooked up nice and juicy. I served it w/ grilled eggplant and white rice seasoned w/ fresh parsley and ground black pepper. All in all, a very nice and easy dinner.

Oh Virginia, (8/6/02), the world is just going to hell in a handbasket (filled with Wonder Bread no doubt) so you'd best be working at saving it - gourmet-wise that is. Since the situation is so dire, why are you slacking from making your home-made hollandaise and raspberry souffle and ratatouille (for the crepes) instead of berating a bottle of italian dressing? This is a really nice recipe. I prefer to make my own dressing.

I think that in this day and age it is nice to have simple and quick recipes. Who has time to come home after work and whip up a gormet meal every night? I applaud Gourmet and Bon Appetit for giving us a variety of recipes for every occasion.

Quick and easy with great results. Yes I used bottled dressing that wasn't even a "gourmet" brand. So sue me. I didn't grill the lemons. Instead I added the juice to the marinade with lots of rosemary fresh from the garden. Next time I'll add garlic too. For easy entertaining, this is the recipe to try.

I tried this recipe with Emeril's Vinaigrette dressing, and I realized that I like the dressing works better as a marinade than on a salad--it's tasty and well seasoned without being too pungent or acidic like some bottled dressings would be. The chicken was tender, juicy and delicious. My family preferred it to the Greek-style homemade marinade I usually use for grilled chicken. (I skipped the lemons--why bother?)

I just stumbled onto this controversial chicken dish; haven't made it. I, too, am curious as to the 9/9 posting from NYC. Where is it? (Perhaps the author will see the interest, and re submit it!) I've never written/reviewed anything on Epicurious,though I use the site often, but based on the lively interchange here, I may start.

Darn! I don't see the "apoplectic" comment from NYC on 9/9 (yesterday?). Could it be the big Brother is editing this forum? I thought a post will only disappear if the same person posts a new comment. Anyone know? BTW, this is just grilled chicken - I see this as perhaps the foundation of particular recipes - not as a recipe unto itself. Grill + acid + fat + herb + chicken = Grilled Chicken!

If you want to go that way, bottled dressing works. But, we prefer to use olive oil, fresh garlic, lemon juice, rosemary (or whatever fresh herb is on hand), and S&P. A few minutes on the grill, and YUM! The perfect base for a great sandwich or salad. We like to cook this when we have other things we want to grill as well. It always seems like a waste to have hot coals and only a few minutes worth of cooking to do.

I made this last night. Admittedly, the bottled dressing I used made the chicken taste slightly bitter, but it sure was convenient for a quick Monday night meal. By the way, I don't know why NYC (Sept. 9) gets so angry over this whole thing. He/she just can't seem to leave it alone, all the while insisting that he/she doesn't care.

Hey NYC (9/9): your own whining is worse than anyone else's. For someone who claims not to care about homemade vs. bottled, you seem to be visiting this recipe and posting apoplectic comments rather frequently.

This is a quick and tasty week-night meal. Okay, so I used a "combination" dressing (approx. half homemade & half good bottled) with a few sun-dried tomatoes, garlic (already in the homemade dressing) and freshly snipped rosemary. It was good!

Like 1st Amendment said in the Salted Water reviews, YOU chose to click on this, so if you don't like it, leave this recipe! You also chose to perpetuate it being in Constant Comment by writing your snotty little comment. Yes, a lot of people are getting very crabby with this recipe and I think it's because some people are being snotty about others' choice to use ready-made ingredients. Same thing can be said for the recipe, if you don't like it, don't use it! Find a recipe that does suit you and leave everyone else alone!!!

Okay! Here's an even better recipe! While you're at the deli picking up the pasta salad, pick up their lemon/rosemary rotissierie chicken. And I'll bet they have a really good dessert available, also! : )

People have their personal preferences for food preparation. To NYC (the one who is advising people to "get a grip"): for someone who claims not to care about whether people use bottled dressing or not, you seem to be engaging in a bit of name-calling. Please try to keep a minimum level of civility. As for me, I use both homemade and bottled, depending on how much of a rush I'm in. Each has its merits.

This is a fabulously easy and delicious recipe for summertime grilling! I've made it 4 times so far and used a different dressing every time, including 2 different bottled and 2 of my own. It's great every time and has impressed dinner guests. I love a quick meal that everybody loves, so I can spend time with my family and guests! Bring on more!!!

Oh My Goodness! While the recipe was quite fine and the chicken was tasty, I certainly never expected this chicken dish to become the focal point of a moral debate between foodies (Bottled Dressing vs. Home-made). Why can't we just be friends and eat chicken without reinventing the wheel?

Easy there, Kalamazoo. Nobody insulted your mother. Indeed, it sounds like she deserves an award for managing to avoid being co-opted by the processed food industry that took over America's kitchens in the post-war era. They sold convenience, fair enough, but insidiously, they somehow managed to convince virtually an entire generation that bottled, canned, frozen or boxed processed food also was somehow superior to freshly prepared. Instant potatoes had no lumps! Minute rice was "perfect every time." And so on. The result was the culinary dark ages. Eventually, there was a renaissance, thanks in no small measure to a few magazines, including Gourmet, that resisted the temptation to become shills for the processed food industry and continued to celebrate the glories of real food, freshly prepared. Thus this debate is about much more than bottled dressing. Those who value Gourmet and Bon Appetit's contribution to cooking in America are alarmed.

It seems people have been whining for years about Bon Appetit dumbing down. Well, if a particular recipe offends you, there are plenty of other recipes to choose from. I'm sure there are many people that appreciate Bon Appetit's ideas on super-fast weeknight cooking...and that doesn't make such readers lousy cooks or vulgarians. If you think Bon Appetit (which is a rather mainstream, middle-brow magazine to start with) is too unsophisticated for you, start a subscription to Saveur.

I have been making a version of this recipe for years - I add the juice of one lemon directly to the marinade w/ the dressing (like Kraft balsamic vinaigrette) and the fresh rosemary. I am glad this recipe is the 'constant comment' section - it reminded me of the delicious results one can get with simple ingredients and preparation. P.S. I cooked the chicken breasts on the George Foreman grill because it's WAY too hot/humid to grill out. Enjoy!

Any idiot can buy a marinade (I have several, unused so far, sort of tells you something doesn't it). Anyone can soak a chicken in anything flavored or unflavored (please refer to instructions this site for salted water). Bottom line for me, I don't come here to get recipes I can get in magazines other then Gourmet or Bon Appetite. So, label me a snob, I don't care, this is an obvious recipe, the trick to it is the grilled lemon. But? Is it worth it? Heck if I know, I am still working on salted water. Personally (and that is also a trick) my comment to this recipe is: No kidding, what do you do with the lemon slices?

Rating: 3
It gets 4 forks for simplicity and ease and 2 for taste, bringing it to a solid 3 fork total. Put me in the pro-bottled dressing recipe camp. You can obviously make your own if so inclined, but sometimes you need something that's going to come together in an instant and this is one of those recipes. I love this website for all of its variety, and if a recipe calls for bottled dressing - canned soup - pre-made pie crust - whatever, and people like it, bring it on! There are plenty of recipes where you have to make your own veal stock represented in the collection.

Lay off the cook from 8/9! I have to agree with them. People get so snobby about using ready-made stuff (anybody remember the Heinz 57 broo-haha?) and there is nothing wround with it. Yes, some have added chemicals, but many do not but that doesn't change the fact that many people eat and enjoy them. Quit being a wannabe and get over yourself!

This looks ok but here's what I do to get really good lemon rosemary chicken. I juice about 4 lemons. To my mini prep processor I add about 4-5 large cloves of garlic and rosemary from 2 sprigs plus some of the lemon juice. Blend that up and then add it to about 1/4 cup olive oil. Marinate the chicken in that and you will have real lemon rosemary chicken.

Kalamazoo is correct. This is a great place to start. I have since prepared this recipe three different ways. The first as listed which my whole family like. For the second I used a raspberry vinagrette and served it on top of a rice pilaf. The third time I made my own vinagrett with ¼ cup balsamic vineger and ½ cup olive oil, and the rosemary. Hmmm, very good.

"A starting point" is the right way to take almost any recipe. This one presents good, basic method and is easy to adapt to one's own taste. Wherever we see "bottled Italian-style dressing", we use Julia Child's Sauce Vinaigrette (Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol.1, pg 94). It, too, is presented as a starting point with many optional variations suggested to the cook. It has been our all-purpose salad dressing and marinade for nearly 40 years.

I think the cook from Virginia needs to check for intestinal blockage. That said, I liked this recipe for what it is--sometimes, I just need an idea, a starting-point, and I don't want to go to the store. To me, there's nothing wrong with a bottled Italian dressing as a marinade. It tastes/contains no more chemicals than many of the foods we eat today. I used fresh thyme instead of rosemary, and served this with linguine tossed with oil, vinegar, garlic, and tomato. Also added a hefty chunk of feta to the plate. We enjoyed eating it, and I enjoyed not having to bend the space-time continuum to create a meal. And as far as "dumbed-down holdovers from the 1950's go:" I grew up eating my mother's food, and she is the most innovative, talented, and held-over cook you could imagine. I'll take that over "nouvelle cuisine" any day.

Excellent recipe! I was very surprised because it is SO easy and simple. I used paul newman's balsamic vinagrette dressing and it was great, and the lemon really makes a difference. A really great dinner when you don't have a lot of time but want to eat well!

There is so much variation in what is in bottled dressing as to make this "recipe" essentially meaningless, as it will turn out differently depending on what you use. And it will probably taste like the chemicals in most bottled dressing, anyhow. I subscribe to Gourmet and Bon Appetit to get real recipes, not this kind of dumbed down holdover from the 1950s.

O.K., I cheated a bit (I always use garlic) but it has a good base to start with if you want to jazz it up a bit. I used a mix of Italian and Greek w/Feta Cheese dressing, garlic and some hot chili paste. What more do you want for a easy, fast dinner?! If you want to make your own Italian dressing....go ahead, be creative!!! This recipe is meant exactly for what it was created for.....fast and easy every day cooking with ingredients most people have in their fridge. This chicken could be served for an informal barbecue with good results.
