I made this to use a lot of leftover melon from Mom's Memorial Day party. It was good, and everyone liked it, although Mom commented that it had a "medicinal" taste. I doubt I'd make it again...I've had better fruit&syrup dishes.

I served this recipe at my herb study on rosemary and everyone loved it. They were surprised to find out that the recipe called for peppercorns and said they probably would have eliminated them from the recipe had they not tasted it first. They all asked for the recipe!
