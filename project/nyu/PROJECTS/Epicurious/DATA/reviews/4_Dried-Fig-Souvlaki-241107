Definitely a do over. We used prosciutto and stuck with the feta and sage as called for. We served these as appetizers at our dinner party last night - there wasn't a scrap left. Great combination of flavors.

I liked this but i wasn't crazy about the Pastourma (the meat). I think i would have liked them more with proscuitto. Also, i can see that a zippier cheese would be nice. I couldn't really taste the sage or feta enough b/c the meat i had overpowered everything else. That said, i'll make these again and experiment to get it just right - it's an awfully good idea.

This was fantastic just as written. I made it, along with some homemade hummus, to start out a wonderful Greek meal. Yum. It's a "do again" for sure.

Entertained my friend's mother from Crete and she loved this. I used the brasaola and it was delicious just as written. Will definitely make again.

Excellent, easy and a nice compliment to the menu. Made this with fresh figs - did a taste test tonight as it is one of the 7 dishes for New Yr's Eve. Will either add just a tad more Feta or even switch to Blue Cheese for an extra kick. I had the proscuitto sliced a bit to thin so will do two wraps around and instead use two small sage leaves one on each side. I know it will be a hit! Only made one for taste testing an hubby was looking for more! Thanks

Wonderful! Very Filling. I placed several on a bamboo skewer and seared them on both sides. I also tried a batch with Stilton Blue Cheese and it added a nice Tang for those who enjoy something a little more zippy. Will make and serve again.

I recently served this at a cocktail party and it was an absolute hit. I also used proscuitto and half a leaf of sage and found that the flawors blended well. It is also really easy to do ahead of time and just fry them up a few minutes before serving.

This recipe was a snap to make and the flavors married nicely together. The sweet flavor of the figs was great with the salty flavor of feta and proscuitto. The sage is a must but I would only recommend using a half a leave as it can overwhelm the other ingredients. I served this at two different parties and got very positive comments.
