I have made this 3 times now and always to rave reviews. The last time I made it with some beautiful sea bass. The first comment that my guests have made is that it is better than any fish that they have had at a restaurant. There is something about cooking the fish on top of the veggies that makes it so moist. A true keeper!

After making this, I agree with tsombrero's review. The cilantro sauce is okay, but for me it didn't go with this dish. I used my friends canned heirloom beets, so the cooking time was fine..but I didn't love the taste. I usually love beets, not this time. Truthfully, the combination of tastes made my stomach turn a bit..

This is an amazing recipe! My husband was apprehensive as he dosen't like squash or beets. However, he loved the beets and squash in this dish. He also said the Halibut was very moist, and the sauce was outstanding. This dish is going into my "keeper" file.

Earthy, sweet, bright, comforting, satisfying, and just-filling-enough. I can't describe how much I loved this recipe, and am already salivating over the idea of making it again. I made it exactly as written, with the exception of roasting the vegetables maybe another 10 minutes, which made them just to my liking. Heading to the fridge for leftovers right now- YAY!

Surprisingly, a bit plain. I prefer my halibut sauteed rather than roasted... Cod or another white fish would be just as good as expensive halibut, roasted with the veggies. I was hoping for the fish and veggies to "meld" flavor-wise, but they didn't have time. Maybe it would work better as a papillotte. BTW the beets take longer to cook. The cilantro sauce is good but to my palate it doesn't really compliment either the fish or the veggies. I am looking for another good use for it. If you want to cook some halibut, try the sauteed recipe with the walnut/pecan shallot topping.

After reading all of the great reviews of this dish and the sauce, I decided to give it a try. Usually with recipes I make my own variations, but for the first time I followed the recipe exactly. I was extremely disappointed in this dish. The sauce was not all it is cracked up to be (and I love all of the ingredients in it!) I cook all the time, absolutely love to cook, and this was a disappointment. I made it for my bf and his friends, and he said this was the one meal I made for him that he almost couldn't finish (and he loves my meals) and had something else to eat instead. I know some of you may think I made it wrong or something, but I did exactly as the recipe said (and I know what I am doing in the kitchen too). I think I am going to stick to making my own meals. This was the first time a tried an Epicurious recipe, and it was rated 4 forks with all great reviews... I am very hesitant to even try another recipe on here... I usually do not write reviews either, but I felt so strongly about it, that I had to.

Easy, nice presentation and very tasty. Agree that the veggies (depending on what you choose) do not need to be roasted for that long at that temp. This dish also gives you time to relax with guests, instead of preparing and closely watching the food, as well.

This was an easy, quick and nice dinner. It may have been because I halved the recipe. Active oven time turned out to be total 22 minutes. Used carrots instead of beets, whiting instead of halibut, since those were what I had. If you microwave the squash two or three minutes whole, it will be easier to peel.

This turned out well and was fairly easy to make. We substituted fingerling potatoes for one of the squash and enjoyed the variety.

My husband LOVED this dish. I made the recipe as is BUT for the Spicy Cilantro Sauce, I substituted fat free chicken broth for the water and my husband decided to add a teaspoon of Asian chile garlic sauce. I will definitely make this again with the following change: the squash, beets, and onions need to roast for different durations, so I might separate the squash from the beets/onions since it cooked more quickly. Also, I used sea bass instead of halibut since halibut is not in season now, and it was wonderful. Keeper!

This was sooo yummy. I agree with others that it was a bit time consuming in the prep and next time I'll cut up veggies and make the sauce the night before or earlier in the day. I loved the cliantro sauce on the fish and it made an interesting combo with the veggies--nice contrast. I didn't have any parsley so I upped the cilantro and was worried that it would be too much. it wasn't. so good and my husband who hates veggies actually ate them! will definitely make this again.

I thought this was great. No halibut so we used cod instead, which was fine. When we make it again, we'll try toasting pine nuts to use as a garnish. Tasty!

I was underwhelmed by this dish. The roasted vegetables taste great, the fish is fine and the sauce is good (though I would sub olive oil for some or all of the water called for), however, the diverse elements didn't really pull together. Perhaps if the fish was marinated with lemon juice, cilantro, parsley, etc. ahead of time it wouldn't taste as if it had just been plopped on top of the roasted vegetables. Bottom line: Not worth the trouble, in my opinion.

This makes a stunningly beautiful dish! I made it with some redfish filets my boyfriend caught. Roasting the fish over the vegetables gave the veggies a little bit of briny tang that was the perfect foil for their earthy sweetness. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

wonderful wonderful dish! we loved it so much, we made it again after two days. it is just perfect as it is, but we just wanted MORE, so - we added a few more vegtables - parsnips and jerusalem artichokes (thinly sliced) were a great add. the turnips didn't work so much for me, but my husband liked it. also - it is pretty low on calories and works well with our diet!

Being curious about what butternut squash tasted like, I bought one and searched for a recipe. How lucky was I! I asked my husband what he would rate it and he said 4 1/2 forks. This is an incredibly easy recipe to make for just 2 people. I used orange roughy instead of halibut and a simpler cilantro sauce recipe with readily available ingredients (lime juice & zest, garlic, cilantro, cumin, cayenne, olive oil, salt). An easy, really good fish recipe for after a long day's work...

I made this dish in the dead of winter and the fresh taste and amazingly vibrant colors really helped to pull me out of the winter blues. It was also quick and easy to make.

I thought the sauce was fantastic... i substituted ground cumin and ground ginger and it still worked out well. I skipped the beets and used a "sweet dumpling squash" rather than butternut squash but it still worked very well. if you have never tried this squash, i highly recommend it. it is incredibly sweet!

This was great....the beets and sauce are a killer combination of colors and the sweetness of the squash is complimented wonderfully by the sauce. I too used tilapia sauteed. Make this dish!

I made this dish for my extended family. Everyone loved it. Several people said it was now their favorite fish dish. I used cod, which worked well. The cilantro sauce was fantastic.

This was really much better than I thought it would be. I wasn't too sure about the cilantro sauce, but it really it what makes this dish shine. The presentation is really very nice as well. I used Tilapia as I couldn't get Halibut and it was just fine. I also used turnips instead of beets. I'm going to try this with chicken next time.

No halibut at the market today so I made this with Tilapia and it worked just fine. I added carrots and asparagus to the roasted vegetables for some more color. It got a great review from my boyfriend who can be finicky. The cilantro sauce makes it great.

Trader Joe's grocery store has 1 lb. bags of butternut squash and beets that are peeled, raw and already cubed. Really helps with the prep time on this recipe.

Delicious. I made the halibut with cilantro sauce but not the roasted veggies. Very tasty and perfect kick to the cilantro sauce.

Rating: 3
Very good recipe, esp. spicy cilantro sauce. The prep work is a bit time consuming--next time I'll prepare vegetables & sauce the day before. The color of the roasted vegetables is wonderful. Used the spicy cilantro sauce the next day as the base for personal pizzas instead of pizza sauce. (Drained some liquid from sauce spread olive oil over dough to prevent it from getting soggy.) Topped pizzas with cheese, scallions, and artichokes. Delicious! Would also be good with mushrooms.

Excellant recipe. With the exception of peeling & cutting the squash, the dish was exceptionally easy, has a lovely presentation (you cook the fish on the roasted veggies) and was well received by all. Took me a total of about 40 minutes of active cooking.

This was a fun unique recipe...I added more ginger and garlic and it was great. I also had some sauce left over so I added lemon juice to it and marinated chicken breasts - they were great as well.

This is an excellent dish (with special kudos to the cilantro sauce). It's not only delicious, but beautiful and low in fat. I wanted to have this on a Monday, so I preroasted the vegetables and made the sauce the day before, so I could pop it in the oven with the fish when I got home from work. Perfect!

Given the 4 fork rating, I really expected this dish to wow me...and it just didn't. It was a nice change of pace from our normal dinner menu, but not something I would serve to guests. I thought the cilantro sauce had more of a summer feel to it, while the roasted squash and beets seemed like a hearty winter meal, so I didn't feel like it all went together very well. Overall...it tasted okay, but I wouldn't make it again.

I just cooked this dish for my mom's birthday dinner and it was a big hit. I simply followed the directions and voila! A delicious meal with lots of flavor...the sauce, squash and beets were especially superb. Here's a hint for those of you near Trader Joe's...they sell bags of beets and butternut squash already cut up in the fresh vegetable section. It cut my prep time in half!

This was excellent, the sauce is to die for. I didn't have time to roast the vegetables and halibut. Instead, I made the sauce, and simply served it on lightly pan-seared halibut with fresh Asian noodles.

Somewhat time consuming, but worth the time. Didn't change a thing, and it is definitely a keeper.

Everyone in our house loves halibut and the cilantro sauce puts this recipie over the top. I've made this dish several times and have substituted acorn squash instead of the butternut and it's still delicious.

Was tempted several times to vary the recipe, especially when I was putting raw fish on the beautifully roasted vegetables. Soooo glad I followed the recipe. I make fish a lot and this was incredible, almost fluffy it was so moist and flavorful. The sauce is sort of Indonesian and that was a nice surprise. I tossed the vegetables with whole cumin seed and cooked them ahead of time 1 hour or so at 350 till they were almost done. Then when ready to serve I followed the recipe 450 oven adding garlic 8 minutes etc. My husband wanted to drink the sauce.

I made this about a year and a half ago when I knew NOTHING about cooking. It took a long time because I had pathetic equipment. But, the recipe was quite good, expecially the cilantro sauce. I made a note on the recipe to make more sauce next time. I'll probably make it again this fall.

The Halibut turned out just right. I used Parsnip instead of Beets. The Cilantro Sauce goes very well with the vegetables, but I preferred the Halibut without it.

This dish was excellent! The vegetables made this dish very colorful and flavorful. The sauce was wonderful, and can be used with many other dishes too. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious! We used gold beets (not really a beet fan) and they were wonderful with the squash and onions. We followed the recipe as written (except we used diced garlic)and thought that the spicy cilantro sauce really complemented the sweet squash and beet mixture. A great lowfat weeknight recipe!

This recipe was very good but next time i'd make it with pork instead of fish to make it excellent. this fish was wonderful with the cilantro sauce but i'm not sure the sauce was a good combo with the vegetables which were fantastic all on thier own.

I haven't enjoyed fish this much in a long time. The combination of vegetables accompanied the halibut very well. I put the sauce on the fish only, and ate the veggies without any, and I found the flavor to be perfect to my taste.

Excellent recipe! Definitely halve the vegetable amt. Also I halved the pepper flake amt and it was still spicy without being overwhelming.

My husband said it was the best sauce he's ever tasted - the type you would fine in 5 star restaurants! I added a few more hot pepper flakes to it because we like it really spicy and it turned out perfect :) The halibut cooks @ exactly the 8 min. the recipe called for and the combination squash, onions, garlic and beets was the perfect choice for the fish...I've forwarded it onto my sister and mom - I look forward to their reviews soon!

This dish was so excellent, especially the sauce, which paired nicely with the sweetness of the roasted vegetables. You could probably halve the vegetable portion and still have plenty to go with the fish. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe last Valentines Day and it became one of my favorites. Somehow I forgot to comment on it, and can't believe no one else has commented either... Try it! . I appreciate that it's a good fish recipe that's baked. Also love the vegetables. They are beautiful, colorful, and delicious!
