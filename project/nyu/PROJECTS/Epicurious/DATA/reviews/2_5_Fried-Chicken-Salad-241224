Well. Lord-a-mercy!! We tried this recipe and loved it! I did increase the spices a bit. I must heartily desagree with the writer whose comments were tasteless and absurd, to say nothing of being downright unkind. We have enjoyed many fine meals first at Olives, and at several of his other restaurants.

My hubby picked this recipe, after viewing my online recipe box. We tried it last night and we certainly were NOT impressed. The chicken was bland. The spices weren't pronounced at all. It tasted like it had just been floured and peppered. Also, we really didn't care for the salad dressing. We love making our own dressings, but this one was completely overpowered by the balsamic vinegar. If you try this recipe, I hope you like vinegar, cause it's all you will taste. It was edible (without the dressing), but certainly nothing to write home about.
