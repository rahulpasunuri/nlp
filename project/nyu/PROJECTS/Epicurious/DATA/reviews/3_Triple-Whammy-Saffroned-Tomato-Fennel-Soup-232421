I made it as written first time, and it was good, but found a few things that could be changed to make it lower in calories and easier. First, no need for all that oil. Reduce it to a teaspoon of full flavored extra virgin olive oil and use a non-stick pan. Cuts most of the fat right there. Second, no need to toast the saffron then grind it. Heat the wine in a small pan, turn it off add the saffron. If you don't want the saffron threads (the only reason I can see for going through the grinding step), steep for 10 minutes then strain into pan. Can be a very low fat and flavorful soup, with these changes.
