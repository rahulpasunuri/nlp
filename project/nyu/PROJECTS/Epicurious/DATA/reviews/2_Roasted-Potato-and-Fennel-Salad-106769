I added some New Mexico red chile powder and sea salt with Herbes de Provence to the recipe to give it some life. It absolutely worked. I think this recipe is a good base for spicing the salad to your liking.

Salad was OK but not really exciting. Maybe a little more zip in the dressing would wake it up
