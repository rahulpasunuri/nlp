We made the cocktail sauce as an appetizer with shrimp, but not the Green Goddess dipping sauce. The cocktail sauce was delicious. For my taste, I reduced the horseradish by half, used sriracha chili sauce instead of tabasco. We also started with Heinz chili sauce instead of ketchup. Light and refreshing with a little zing!! It was the hit of our Christmas appetizers.

The cocktail sauce was great - the orange juice and zest really make the recipe. For the shrimps, first I remove the vein on the unpeeled shrimp (you need a fine serrated knife) and simmer in white wine (instead of salted water as indicated in recipe).

Made the Orange Tomato cocktail sauce and it is a keeper. Easy, fresh, and much better than regular cocktail sauce.

Both of these were a huge hit. The cocktail sauce, as written, is strong, I could see clearly and breathe better than ever. So, I added a little sour cream, it calmed the strength of the horseradish a little, but didn't change the taste. Thank you.

An excellent "twist" on classic shrimp cocktail! The cocktail sauce was delicious as was the green goddess - guests liked the option of two sauces. I also served crab claws along with the shrimp.

The cocktail sauce is fantastic and easy to make - I added a little extra orange zest, lemon juice and tabasco for extra kick but it wasn't necessary. The green goddess was very bland to my taste and I ended up adding a lot more of the "green" ingredients, probably wouldn't make the recipe again.

I only made the green goddess dressing, so I can't comment on the others. It was delicious, and all of my guests devoured it. The only thing I did is double the amount of tarragon and add some fresh dill. It was a little bland at first, but after adjusting the herbs and spices, it came out perfectly.

Don't bother with the Green GOddess--it is ok, but actually not as good as bottled (or made from Penzey's spice mix). The cocktail sauce is fine, but not earth-shattering. Both recipes make abundant quantities; I think half recipes would still be too much!

The cocktail sauce is great. I love the hint of orange and it's so easy to make. I'll never buy bottled sauce again. The green goddess was very good too but a bit more complicated for the last minute drop in guest. I always have shrimp in the freezer.

I can't speak for the orange tomato sauce, because I just made regular cocktail sauce & added lemon zest. But the Green Goddess dipping sauce was fabulous - we dipped shrimp, raw veggies, and rice crackers in it. The other two dips I made got left in the shade!

I was not thrilled with this recipe. Though the shrimp cooked perfectly, I didn't care for the cocktail sauce. The freshly squeezed orange juice was a bit sweet and I thought it lent an off flavor to the sauce. The ketchup already has sugar in it; the cocktail sauce didn't need the extra sweetness of the orange juice. Next time, I would leave out the orange juice and just use more lemmon. I didn't make the green goddess dipping sauce so I can't comment on it.

The orange cocktail sauce is incredible (the green godess sauce was a hit too, but I am not a fan of mayo) I have made the orange sauce again and again.

Great w/ the orange zest. Use fresh horseradish in the cocktail sauce if you really want a bite. Buy a plane grater (its got a handle and a long, 1.5 inch wide by 12 inch blade with small grating slits, great for ginger, parmesan, orange zest horseradish) to make this easier. Better yet, grow your own horseradish!

Great! Use all the horseradish, add the anchovies...nice change from the 'regular' sauces.

Both sauces are an interesting change from regular cocktail sauce. My guests especially liked the Green Goddess.

i made this for my husband's birthday this year and we are bringing it back for our holiday party -- the green goddess is especially refreshing and a nice change from the usual cocktail sauce!

Very good! I took it to our gourmet group and it got rave reviews. I would still go for the full 3 tablespoons of horseradish!

Really great combo - don't be tempted to cheat and use bottled cocktail sauce - it doesn't compare to the fresh taste of this one. The Green Goddess dressing is fabulous - don't skip the anchovy -even if you hate them - it adds a great flavor.

The cocktail sauce was great, but I was glad I put 1 tbsp horseradish at a time, 2 was enough for us. The green goddess sauce was nice as well, very thick. i would go for lofat ingredients next time i make it.

I made the orange tomato sauce and it was a very nice change from regular cocktail sauce. Will make it this way all the time now.
