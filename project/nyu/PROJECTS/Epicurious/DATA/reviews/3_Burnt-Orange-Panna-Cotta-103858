Delicious! I made this recipe exactly as written. My family thought it was fantastic.

I made this for a dinner party and my husband said it was the best dish there. This is a good recipe but I've had better panna cotta in other epicurious.com recipes.

The texture of the panna cotta was great and easy to make. It definitely needs the orange segments and juice for extra flavor. Maybe my oranges were old and of not great quality because I had a hard time tasting the burnt orange taste. I have yet to get my husband or friends' review.
