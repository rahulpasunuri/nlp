The name James Beard did entice me try the recipe and I was not disappointed! The microbiologist in me appreciated that he used gelatin as a substitute for the traditional raw beaten egg whites. The results were creamy and smooth and not at all jelly like. I prepared it the morning of, as a dessert for my Oscar dinner. Served with chai tea lattes it was the perfect rich end to a dinner of several spicy courses.

Not because the name james beard appears on the recipe, it is right away worth three forks! Look into any classical, french cookbook. nowhere, nowhere gelatin is used.

Rich and tasty. I used perserved cherries, pinapple, and apricots.
