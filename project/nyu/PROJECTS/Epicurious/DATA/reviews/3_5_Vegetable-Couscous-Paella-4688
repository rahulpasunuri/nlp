I thought this recipe was great. I didn't even have peppers or carrots to add. Instead I used adzuki beans, doubled the peas and also added in some raisins. I also sauteed and browned the artichoke because I prefer it that way. I was very impressed and this recipe was incredibly easy to make. Came together in no time at all.

I thought this was pretty good, not excellent. I added veggies-- zucchini, mushrooms--and used smoked paprika instead of the usual stuff. I also found it mushy, though that might be due to my whole-wheat couscous. What saved it-- besides aggressive use of lemon-- was accompanying it with dollops of tart yogurt. That made it much better.

I won't give a fork rating because I had to make substitutions: jarred roasted red pepper instead of red bell pepper, 6 cloves of garlic instead of 1 tbsp, water instead of vegetable broth, a serrano pepper and 1/2 tsp cayenne instead of 1/4 tsp, and turmeric and garam masala instead of paprika. No carrot. Despite all the substitions, the flavor was boring. I was expecting a rich and savory dish but I just got something mushy and bland. It needs something.

Wow! Tremendous. Even better than the seafood version since it keeps well and can be reheated for lunches. I used a rice pilaf instead of couscous. Cooked the rice seperately in water, drained 4 minutes before finished and then added after the vegetables. Also, i used frozen artichokes hearts and added those with the carrots. The only change I would make is adding the peas a little later so they don't over cook. Don't skip the lemon and parsley, they add alot here!

This is a fabulous and quick meal for a weeknight or special occasion alike! I threw it together with whatever I had in my kitchen, so was missing a few things (no paprika or saffron, used garlic powder instead of fresh, canned tomatoes instead of fresh). I added a few canned mushrooms and white wine, and I used quinoa instead of couscous to make it even more filling and nutritious. I can't wait to try this again with the missing ingredients, including the artichokes and lemon wedges on top! Yum!!

A great variation of some classic spanish flavors. I used risotto, rather than couscous, which obviously took a bit longer, but was well worth it. I followed the recipe exactly, up until the part where you are to add the cousous. Instead, I drained all the liquid into a pot and set it on low, and used that liquid to make the risotto. Once the risotto was nearly done, I integrated the vegetables back into the risotto. It was a big hit with everyone.

Great dish... have made it many times

I have made this recipe a number of times. Everyone I have made this for has raved about it. I usually add zuchini to give it even more. The 1/4 tsp of cayenne is amazingly potent.

I love this recipe. It is a great vegetarian main dish, but I usually make it as a side dish, substituting chicken broth for the vegetable broth.

One vegetarian in our family of four, so I'm always in search of main dishes that will excite both persuasions. I used a few more garbanzos than called for and had to sub red pepper flakes for cayenne and whole wheat couscous for regular. Hubby like this one more than I did: he gave it a 3, I gave it a 2.5. He said it was tasty, filling and he felt he had eaten something very healthy; I thought it was a bit too much as a main dish, but I'm full and feeling healthy myself. I'll make it again, but serve as a side dish or alongside a large green salad. Beware: the recipe, prepared as written, makes enough for a small army.

I made this for a small dinner party that included vegan guests. I made a couple minor changes. I added some extra seasoning and a splash of white wine. I also used a can of fire roasted tomatoes (juice included) instead of the fresh tomatoes, and I really think that was a good change. I thought the paella had enough peppers, but I did top it with artichoke hearts and lemon slices. This was a very simple and tasty dish that looked nice coming to the table. All of our guests had at least two servings, and even the omnivores really liked it. I served it with a simple green salad and poached pears for dessert. It was quite a nice, simple vegan meal.

I made what I would consider significant changes to this recipe, and it turned out great. It may also turn out great without these changes, but I wouldn't know because I've just made this once. I had just had a party so I used all the cut-up veggies I had left over: red & green bell peppers, red and white onion, white beans, tomatoes, carrots, and peas. I forgot to add the artichoke. When I tasted it, it was somewhat bland so then I added some chipotle powder, which was very much out of place. To remedy this I cooked up some chorizo, cut it up, and simmmered it with the paella and the dish was AWESOME!!! I also used orzo instead of rice.

This was delicious and very easy to prepare. I also added a splash of white wine with the stock. Next time, I may experiment by adding more vegetables but this was very good as is.

As a vegetarian, I am constantly looking for hearty, filling recipes, which this certainly is. As the prep work is fairly intensive and the recipe yields a ton of paella, I'd probably only make this again when entertaining or for a group. I made this with whole wheat cous cous and it turned out great -- very healthy. My only variations from the recipe was substituting dry white wine for some of the vegetable broth, and I also sauteed some shrimp in garlic and served on the side. This was my first time cooking with saffron, and I fail to see what it lent the dish (especially for its price!), though I am a novice cook and may be missing the point!

Good, good, good. Served this as a main course, for a dinner that included vegetarians. Even the meat-eaters took seconds. Used canned tomatoes. Would certainly make it again.

This was excellent, my whole family raved. i used whole wheat couscous and no one even considered how healthy it was. we didn't have saffron, so i skipped it, but i doubled the paprika and cayenne for some extra flavor. i would highly recommend this dish.

Very tasty. I'm not a vegetarian, but I made this for a shower (for vegetarian guests) that was cancelled due to weather. I'll happily eat the results for work lunches this week.

Fantastic! I added a lot more garlic (crushed and chopped), and much more onion, and increased the broth accordingly (I used low sodium chicken broth). I also used more chickpeas. It was delicious.

We make this on a regular basis. I double the spices and also add zucchini with the carrots. The left overs make for a great lunch the next day.

This is now my favorite paella recipe. The flavors are wonderful and the couscous makes it incredibly light and fluffy, not sticky and heavy like some paellas. A real keeper.

Too healthy! I had contemplated making these with brown rice, but then we truly would have felt that we were doing penance. This dish needs something rich and decadent to make it more interesting.

This may be my favorite recipe from epicurious so far. Insanely easy (took less than 30 minutes of active cooking), insanely cheap (about $15 for all the ingredients for 4 servings), and insanely tasty! This is a gem, especially since it will be a great dish to be able to serve to vegetarian guests. Will definitely make this one again!

This is a very tasty and easy to prepare dish. Mine ended up a litle different because after I had began chopping and cooking everything, I realized that we had no couscous, so I used arborio rice and added a can of tomatoes for extra liquid. So, it took a little longer to cook, and tasted more like a regular paella or a risotto. Will do again! Maybe next time with couscous!

Great use for whatever veggies are in the house. I cut up some stringbeans and zucchini and threw them in. I wouldn't cook the onions quite so long next time since they and the tomatoes completely broke down. I also made some seared shrimp with rosemary and olive oil to serve on top. Enjoy!

This was a huge hit with everybody when I cooked it, even the non-vegans. The only changes I made were: I used canned chickpeas and canned tomatoes, and used the liquid from both cans in lieu of vegetable broth. This made for an intense tomato flavor. I'd recommend making a double batch and keeping some in the fridge: it only gets better if you let it sit a while, as the flavors meld. This is one of the best recipes I've yet found on Epicurious

This recipe was easy to make and a hit with our vegetarian friends. Even my husband who is a devout red meat fan liked it!

Tasty, colourful, and easy. I also threw in asparagus for the heck of it. A pinch of the freshest, best-quality saffron makes all the difference.

Great recipe - quick, easy, and versatile. I didn't have saffron or paprika, so used curry powder & turmeric instead & threw in a palmful of currants. Ended up with a curry dish instead of paella, but it was delicious. Will definitely make again, will try different veggies as well. Will try it with paprika & saffron next time.

Excellent. The only thing is that I've made this twice and both times it seemed so time consuming... perhaps it was the wine I was drinking while cooking which made a difference. I am a non-vegetarian and I didn't feel like this was missing anything though and I will continue to make it.

Non-vegetarians, like myself, may want to add cubes of chicken breast. This simple dish really hit the spot. It was just what we were searching for.

This is one of my favorite vegetarian dishes. It is a hearty and festive entree, but it also makes a glorious side dish for a dinner party. I add a pinch of sugar to balance some of the sharp flavors. Do garnish it with the bell pepper slices and the lemon wedges, because that makes the dish even more colorful and inviting.
