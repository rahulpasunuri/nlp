Really, really good! Had a nice nutty and light flavor and was a great way to use herbs from my garden. Made it exactly as written except without marjoram. I tasted it before adding herbs and thought, "woha, big garlic taste!" but that was balanced out perfectly after the herbs. Will definitely make again.

I really liked this rice, however, I thought the mint was too much. I'll definately make it again....just skipping the mint.

Great rice recipe! Took this and black beans to a football potluck. First dish to run out. Adults and children where asking for more and for the recipe. Used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth so that my vegan friend could eat it also.

I personally did not like it, but my wife did. I really felt the marjoram overpowered all the other herbs. I had never had marjoram before and now know I really dislike it's flavor. If you like marjoram than it's probably a really good recipe, but I prefer the recipe for Jasmine rice with garlic, ginger, and cilantro also on the website which I think is outstanding!

Fantastic recipe. Very, very good -- definitely a keeper. I love garlic, but I thought "Wow 12 large cloves of garlic!", but after reading the reviews used them all -- glad I did. The flavor of the rice is wonderful, not 'garlicky', but a nutty flavor. No one would ever guess there's 12 cloves of garlic. Used 1/2 C each of the cilantro and parsley; didn't use the other herbs -- this time -- because of the flavor of the chicken entre I was serving with the rice. This is winner.

Fabulous! Have made it a few times. Turns out well without cilantro too.

Delicious! I didn't have marjoram on hand and substituted fresh oregano.

I didn't have any cilantro and I made it in the rice cooker to save time, but this turned out well. It's a very fresh yet substantial side dish.

I'm all about the spuds, so I rarely make a rice dish. This one may just turn me around! Loved the goldeny color, the rich, golden umami of the garlic and chicken broth combo, and the tang of the lime and herbs were perfect even though I had no marjoram. Fantastic as a side, and awesome in shrimp soft tacos! I'll be making this again!

Very tasty. I didn't have any marjoram, so I just went with the cilantro/parsley/mint combination and it was delicious. I made it with the Grilled Pork Chops w/ Garlic Lime Sauce (also from this site), and I think the flavors were a little too similar. But that's not this recipe's fault. I would definitely make this again.

This is a staple rice dish, especially during the summer time. However, I use long grain brown rice (basmati or even brown Jasmine rice is great) to give it some nutritional value. I also use a blend of cilantro, mint and basil and skip the parsley and marjoram. It takes longer to cook due to the brown rice, but it turns out awesome. I'm a garlic lover but I don't feel that the qty called for makes it at all overpowering.

This is so yummy! It's pretty easy (even I didn't burn the rice - as I usually do) and the herbs really make it. You can't even tell it has 12 cloves of garlic in it. It's a keeper!

This recipe is a refreshing change of pace. I loved the garlic and lime flavors. I used brown rice and it was very tasty.

I was surprised about the 3C of broth since I usually make rice at a 1:1 proportion w/ water, not 1:2 like this recipe calls for. So I used 2 cups of broth instead & it was enough. Also, I cut the garlic in half. At first I had real doubts about this dish! HOWEVER, it all worked out...after all the flavors have a chance to meld together - so don't give up mid-stream like I almost did! Didn't add any salt. Used fresh herbs (think that's the key). I also added a finely shredded carrot (no need to cook it) because I love adding that to rice (always adds a nice contrast & subltle flavor). And must admit I added a handful of shredded white cheese (manchego). Thanks for the recipe. Made it the day before a dinner party & served with enchiladas. Great flavor combination!

The fresh marjoram made the whole thing taste like soap. Next time, I'll leave it out. I think it would have been delicious if it didn't taste like Dawn.

this was great. i didn't use the garlic, or any of the other herbs except for the cilantro. i served it with beef tacos, & it was the perfect accompaniment. my family really enjoyed it & i will make this many more times! there is a lot of room for variation with this recipe.

This was a delicious accompaniment to the "Soft Fish Tacos" on this site. I used all the fresh garlic specified in the recipe, and it was not too much for us. I just didn't have all those fresh herbs and spices, so I subbed dehydrated (at 25 per-cent of the amount called for). Also replaced the grated lime peel with the exact amount of jarred orange zest. Added all these flavorings when the rice was about 3/4 done. Omitted the salt--didn't need it. It was absolutely YUMMY.

Okay, but way too much garlic! Next time, I will cut it back by at least half. The herbs and lime were terrific.

Rating: 3
Made this to accompany fresh pickeral! I too, like some other cooks, thought it was a lot of garlic but it wasn't--the garlic flavour is very mellow.The lime juice and rind make it a wonderful accompaniment to fish or seafood. I think the herbs make this dish very fresh tasting and unique and great for the summer!

I followed the recipe using all the herbs recommended. I did, however, cut the cilantro in half since I loathe and detest cilantro. Doing that, I thought it was perfect! Served chilled as a salad with roast veggies and pork roast. It was very, very well received.

Oh, this was SOOOO good! I made it for a family get-together with the Broiled Salmon with Citrus-Yougurt Sauce. The sauce was great with the rice. Very Mediterranean and very tasty. I am so glad I found this recipe because I am going to make it again and again. I did not find either the garlic or the herbs to be overpowering. I did not use mint or marjoram, just the parsley and cilantro.

I made this dish for a crowd and everyone loved it. This is by far the best rice recipe I have ever tasted.

This rice is so delicious! It was perfect with a spicy chili I made, and it was good for leftovers, too. It's very much like an aromatic rice from an ethnic restaurant, and had a palate-cleansing freshness to it.

This was so great! Do not make this recipe unless you have all the fresh herbs- it really adds to the deliciousness of the recipe. Also, I only used 10 garlic cloves- and it was perfect. But next time I will try 12. Great dish.

Yes I agree, very fresh and aromatic. I made it with brown jasmine rice. The aroma reminded me of being in some ethnic restaurant but I can't say what type. Maybe Indian or Middle-eastern? I like it a lot!

Yum! I made the recipe as written, except I did not rinse the rice. Flavors are very fresh and clean, and it's such a nice change from regular steamed rice. I like to serve it with a simple grilled meat because the flavors are so fresh.

A great side dish that's easy to make. I didn't find the garlic at all overpowering. I'll probably increase the amount of lime rind and/or lime next time I make it. I made it to accompany turkey breasts and onions in a nice medium indian curry sauce and found the combination worked very well.

Delicious, easy and very fresh tasting....Will make again.

This is one of those recipes that is made again and again in my house. We all love the fresh flavors of the herbs and lime. I have to disagree about the comment on too much garlic-- I'm amazed at how the flavor is tamed in the process. I might add even more this time!

This dish is excellent! It goes well with various meats. I've made it for dinner and for parties and everyone loved it. Adding chopped chives and different kinds of mint enhance the flavor.

Good recipe. Could be better with less garlic and less herbs. I added cooked baby shrimp to it. Gives it a mediterreanean feel to the dish

Loved this recipe. Perfect for spring/summer because of the fresh taste. My husband would like me to use a little less herbs next time but I loved it as is. Serve with the halibut fish tacos (Bon Appetit, May 03) and you won't be sorry!

Not bad. I found it to be a little too garlicky. I like the cooking method, so I might try again with a little less garlic. The herbs and lime are a really nice touch.

My husband and I both loved this recipe. We have made it twice in one month. I love herbs, my husband likes them in moderation. It satified both of us!! The taste was fresh and spring-like. The garlic was only a hint of flavor, which was a nice change. I am usually heavy-handed with the garlic because I like it so much. I must confess that I added sauted chopped shallot, can't make rice without it. Try this one, for sure - you won't be disappointed.

Very good and easy....I served with lime marinated lamb kabobs with most of the same herbs and it was wonderful together.

Great recipe! Served it for a dinner party with both salmon and pork recipes from this site and everything was a big hit. I used a little extra of all the herbs too.

I made this to go with my husband's pheasant (he uses just the thighs, drums, and boned breasts, dipped in seasoned flour and fried). It was delicious. The garlic flavor was soft, not sharp. I will definately make it again - and soon!

Fabulous rice! You can taste each herb and it is so fresh tasting. We had it with pork but I'll bet it would be wonderful with fish. What a nice change. Perfect for the coming of spring.

Hey, "Cook from Strong, Maine," who are you? I live in Freeman. Maybe we could exchange recipes sometime.

The dish works very well in an automatic rice cooker. We were very happy with the results, but will probably play around with the ingredients a little bit on our next attempt. Unlike the previous post on the rice cooker, I would recommend keeping the original amounts for the chicken broth. We used 2 cups instead of 3 and found it to be a little dry.

This was good! I halved the recipe for three people and used a little less garlic. Used Jasmine rice and only had mint and cilantro. A good simple recipe and a great alternative to the usual rice I make. Served it with roasted ginger-soy glazed salmon (not from this site).

Even better in automatic rice cooker!Comes out perfectly. Use the same quantity of chicken broth as rice ie one and a half cups of each or two and two for larger serving. (Better to have some over than not enough)!

The cilantro & lime reminded me of Mexico. I even got my partner to try it and he is no rice fan so that's something. I did use more garlic the second time. I really love garlic and it wasn't overpowering at all. Great dish.
