I only made the chutney to go with grilled butterflied leg of lamb for Easter. The chutney was fantastic.

OUTTA CONTROL! This was great. I do have a couple of suggestions, however: 1) You'll have to double the chutney to suffice for this amount of meat. 2) Add 2 teaspoons of minced ginger when you start to cook down the chutney. 3) You'll have to cook down the chutney for a lot longer than the recipe stipulates. It took me 40 minutes over low heat before I got the right consistency. 4. If you use a leg of lamb, as I did, instead of chops, stuff some cherries and/or apricots (fresh or rehydrated) into the folds of the meat before roasting it.

I made this tasty chutney to go with couscous and minted lamb patties (recipe from this site.) I think the chutney would make a great sandwich spread too.

This a great recipe. I've made it for my family as well as dinner parties. Everyone loves it.

A favorite dish of my husband and mine--we often have made this when we've had company over for dinner. I prefer to use boneless lamb sirloin tips (the filet mignon of lamb...) instead of chops.
