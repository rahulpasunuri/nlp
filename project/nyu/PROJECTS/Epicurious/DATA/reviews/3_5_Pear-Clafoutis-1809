I've made this one twice now with ground cherries and peach (one sliced peach plus enough ground cherries to fill the rest of a 10" pie dish). I put the peach slices on the outside and filled the center with the ground cherries to resemble a flower. Also dusted with nutmeg. The second time I made it was for part of a Slow Food $5 Challenge dinner. So easy and so good, can't wait to make it with Pears!!! Served it with a choice of homemade creme fraiche or whipped cream (no sugar as the clafoutis is sweet enough to carry it)

It's such an easy thing to make and perfectly delicious! I didn't find the recipe needed any adjustments. I used an extra pear and the amount of custard was just fine; it filled my pie dish perfectly. I loved how easy it was to get the custurd texture without the fussiness of a bain marie. Dust with a bit of nutmeg, if you enjoy a little spice. Overall this is an ideal mid-week dessert, fast and comforting.

I would double the custard recipe for the same amount of pears.Probably not the butter however, I will leave that the same.

This is a great recipe! I made it first time as is, and second time with blackberries. Both turned out wonderfully. I don't understand one of the previous reviewers about too much butter and too sweet... I think s/he made it wrong. Also, you don't really "take it OUT of the pan": it's a clafoutis, you can serve IN the pan!!

I loved this recipe!! Took it to a dinner oarty and received rave reviews. Just the right touch - very light and flavorful - after a full meal. I did have to make a couple of modifications, though: 1) I used red pears and left the skins on so that the color showed through the batter. 2) I used 4 pears and I used my 10" white pyrex tart / flan pan, which has straight sides and allowed for the liquid to be more evenly distributed that a typical pie plate. 3) I did have to put it is my convection oven for another 8-11 minutes AFTER the initial 55 min recommended time, as the center was not set. 4) I made a cinnamon Chantilly Cream - it was just the right touch, and complimented the pears nicely. 5) Next time I will soak the pears in Port or Red Wine to give them a brilliant hue - as the presentation was already beautiful with the skins left on.

This did not come out nicely at all. Other than the fact that I used apples instead of pears, I followed the recipe exactly. There was way too much butter (I actually poured butter off the top), and I found it overly sweet. Then, when I went to take it out of the pan, it completely fell apart. I love clafoutis, but I will not use this recipe again.

Posiblemente añadirle polvo de hornear a la harina, hará que quede de textura esponjosa. Puede agregarsele almendras y pasas.
