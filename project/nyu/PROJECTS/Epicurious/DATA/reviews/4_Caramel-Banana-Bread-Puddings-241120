Awesome recipe. Made them for a dinner party dessert. Everyone loved them! Time consuming, but easy. I prepared in advance and refrigerated them, but cooked them and served them immediately after cooking with more caramel sauce on the side. Yummy!

I wouldn't say these are "fast and easy" but they are definitely special! really impressive!

As with the previous reviewer, I am not a huge bread pudding fan but even I liked this one! And, my family LOVED it. I had no ramekins so made it in an 8x8 glass dish and it worked just fine. I made my own caramel sauce from the April 2006 epicurious recipe, which was great. I also skipped the butter on top, as did not think you needed it. Oh, and I used challah instead of white bread.

I hate bread pudding. I have *one* single recipe for bread pudding that I actually like (white chocolate thing) but other than that, I have hated every ingle recipe I've ever tried. Except this one. I followed this recipe exactly... well save one edit to the custard: I added cinnamon (it amazes me how many banana recipes are out there, and they ALL omit cinnamon), and I increased the egg by one, the vanilla by a touch, and the half and half by roughly 1/3 cup. (Mainly because after soaking, the custard was too low in the cups. This slight increase filled them right up!) These were *delicious*. Now, my son (who's 6) is quite the picky eater, and he didn't like them at all. But everyone else scarfed them down. I turned them out, warm, into bowls and topped with vanilla ice cream and extra caramel sauce... mmmmm!

This is a great dessert. We added more bananas, used jar caramel sauce, pam spray on the ramekins, and fat free half & half. Made one with chocolate sauce works well too. A holiday favorite.

This was a big hit!! I layered it into a dish and pureed the bananas instead of slicing them. Made my own caramel type sauce with butter, brown sugar and cream. It was delicious!!

This recipe is AMAZING. So easy, and a real crowd-pleaser, even for people who claim not to like bread pudding. As for the reviewer from Alexandria, I just don't understand people who rate recipes with their own misguided adjustments! A 9x13 dish is way too big, the ingredients must be layered, and salt is a major component of the recipe!

It was just OK. With this recipe, I think bananas just don't belong in a bread pudding compared to a fruit like apples. A disclaimer, though, I did make a couple of slight adjustments. I did not bother with sea salt, and I put the ingredients all together in a 9x13 dish.

This recipe was delicious -- even my husband, who is not a bread pudding fan, loved it. I used Pepperidge Farm Very Thin sliced bread, and I used my leftover banana slices to fill the empty spaces in the ramekins, so I suppose it was a little less bread-y than what's pictured. I also skipped the melted butter on the top, and I quartered the recipe to make only 2 servings. Yum!

This was wonderful !!! I followed the directions & they all went nuts over it & will make it again very soon.

We loved this dessert. I omitted the butter at the end and I used high quality caramel sauce instead of corn syrup and food coloring...but it probably would have been yummy either way. And so easy and fast. Make sure you soak them for a while before baking to avoid dry bread bits.

I made this in one, large dish instead of ramekins; followed the recipe exactly, except served it with softly-whipped cream on top (if I had time I think creme anglaise would be great, but the other was faster). It was a huge hit with my entire family - they all want to know when we will have it again.

This was delicious. I followed the directions except used a baking dish instead of ramekins. My one suggestion would be to let the bread soak in the custard for much longer than 1/2 hour. Next time I might try leaving it over night in the fridge before cooking it.

This is an excellent winter dessert recipe especially in Minnesota below zero weather! I used 6 slices of bread and 2 bananas. Other than that followed recipe exactly.

I doubled this recipe and did not mess with the ramkins. Very yummy and easy to do for a crowd. Will make again.

I put everything in a square baking dish instead of using ramekins. Also added some cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkled on top. My husband rated this a 7 on a scale from 1-10, so probably a 3-fork rating for us. Very RICH!! We ate it hot, served with whipped cream on top.

I'm giving this a 2 forks my daughter gives it 3 forks. We too added extra caramel. There are so many great desserts I don't think I'll bother making this again.

This was a good addition for this Christmas. It is important to wisk the liquids thoroghly. Also, extra caramel on the bottom is great idea!!

Made for Christmas Eve dessert, Excellent!You really need to use the 3/4-cup ramekin. Mine were a little larger and I had to make more custard.

So easy and delicious (this coming from a horrible cook)! I'm huge caramel fan, so I increased the amount of caramel at the bottom of the ramekin by about two tablespoons with no major fall out (baking wise).

This dish did not turn out well in the individual ramikins. The bread on top was dry, and there were pieces of cooked egg custard at the bottom. If I were to make it again, I would mix, let the bread soak, and then place in the dishes. Very disappointed

This was an enormous hit at a recent party, and so easy and elegant. Only notes would be: don't skimp on the caramel sauce, and no need to serve ice cream with it!

Made this for a dinner party and it was a hit! Served it warm with vanilla ice cream with a little carmel sauce and a small sprinkle of brown sugar. Yum!! Will make again.
