skip the micro.... saute the onion in the butter, make the roux, pour it over the cut veggies and bake till tender. Easy, tasty and pretty.

Although the mixing of the rutabaga and sweet potato was a great idea and quite tasty, I think the recipe was a lot of trouble and the sauce separated. Next time I will make a bechamel and pour it over steamed veggies.
