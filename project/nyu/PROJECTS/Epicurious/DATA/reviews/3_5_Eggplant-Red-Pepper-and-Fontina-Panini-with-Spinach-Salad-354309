Fabulous!! Made it just as the recipe called for, and it was really, really good - extremely flavorful. The fontina cheese complements the eggplant and red bell peppers well. The fresh basil and oregano added a lot of flavor and freshness, so don't skip those. I was also concerned re the repetition of ingredients in the salad, but it went well with the panini and the balsamic based dressing added another level of complimentary flavors. This sandwich will be a repeat and a regular addition to our menus.

Grown up grilled cheese! I skipped the bell peppers and used extra eggplant. This was so tasty and a great way to incorporate more veggies into the diet. I served with some blackberries as well. Tasty and easy

DELICIOUS. I used swiss cheese instead of the fontina (personal preference). I shared with friends and they all enjoyed very much, even one friend who claimed she doesn't like eggplant. The recipe is simple and I will definitely be making it agin.

I am counting points on Weight Watchers and this was an easy lunch to adapt. Used Japanese eggplant (small) and Double fiber bread. Replaced fontina with laughing cow french onion. Ditched the salad because the ingedients seemed repetative. Served with baked blue corn chips -- yummy!

This was quite good but next time I think I'd use goat cheese and experiment with different vegetables. Maybe zucchini or asparagus...

This was really pretty tasty; I used some Italiano bread I baked today. I think next time I will replace the Fontina with Mozzarella...just a personal preference.
