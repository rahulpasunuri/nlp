This was just OK. I found the cake to be lacking somehow. The pudding at the bottom was marvelous but the dessert was better when kind of "mixed up" together. This made for an unattractive presentation, however. Did not like the almond addition at all. Will look elsewhere for a key lime dessert.

I'm not exactly crash hot at baking, but I thought I'd try this out, since I had a bag of key limes languishing in the fruit drawer. It got off to a rocky start since I couldn't find my ramekins, but made do with some glass bowls. It was absolutely delicious. We licked the bowls clean and the leftovers didn't make it to the fridge. A definite keeper.
