Excellent recipe. Superb taste for fresh corn.

Very simple and quick to make. The flavors blend to create a very unique taste. Everyone in my family, from the youngest (2) to the oldest (42) liked it quite a bit. The only possible change would be a touch more salt. We will definitely make this again!

My boyfriend thought I was crazy when I put the corn straight on the grill rather than wrapping it in foil first, but he ate his words! I used cilantro instead of thyme in the butter because I am a cilantro addict, and it turned out AMAZING! I used the extra butter on white rice and to butter bread. Delish!

I make this for Thanksgiving every year now, by request. No one in my family likes plain corn any more. I use canned corn, which I find crisper than frozen, instead of grilling. And depending on what I flavor the turkey with, I sometimes add sage or rosemary to the butter as well. The herb butter really makes the corn stand out - the shallots are a must.

Did this for a very large group so it was easier to use fozen whole kernal corn and mix chopped shallots into the corn. Made a large batch of melted butter and added the dried thyme. Added to corn in roasting pan, mixed it up, covered with foil, then baked at 350 for 40 minutes. Everyone loved it.

This butter is great. Tastes great on bread! I always have some in the fridge to add something special to a meal or recipe.

This is a keeper. The butter is so good, I'm using what's left over on tomorrow's baked potatoes. I will make this butter often. I recommend using fresh thyme, and make sure you saute the shallots until they start to brown.

This was FANTASTIC. The tastes blended together for a perfect contribution to just about anything that would require butter with a little bit a kick! Am making today and having again this week!
