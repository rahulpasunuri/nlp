Straining the soup is important. It won't effect the taste, it will effect the texture. The recipe did seem a little flat to me at first glace as well. I carmalized an onion in bacon fat (reserving the bacon for bacon bits, and a bit of the onion for garnish) and added that to the soup. I also used one more pepper than suggested. I served this with shredded grilled chicken, tortilla strips, carmelized onion and bacon bits. Pretty good stuff.

I had really high expectations for this soup, I think. Roast corn, chili and cilantro sounded wonderful, but in truth, I found the amount of work to make this soup did not match the end product. It was good, but not worth the work. When I got to the step to strain the soup, I just skipped it and added in the rest of the ingredients. I don't think it made a difference in the flavor. Probably won't make this again.

I was looking for a good way to use the surplus corn in the garden and I think I found it. In truth, the recipe is a 3...however with the addition of a few ingredients (and calories!) I turned it into a four. I was out of cilantro so I added ground cumin and a little extra chicken broth. I garnished with some of the roasted pepper, crisp crumbled bacon, and a grate of jack cheese. Yum.
