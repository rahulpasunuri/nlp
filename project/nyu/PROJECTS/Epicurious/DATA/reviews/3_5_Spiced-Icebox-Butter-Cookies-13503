I made these last year, and gobbled half of the dough raw... This year I tried another recipe and regretted it!

People gobbled them at my holiday party. I made them with the molasses and ground the anise. I think that the icing is too stiff for drizzling out of the corner of a plastic bag, though; I had a really hard time controlling it. When I make them again, I'll use a decorating bag with a piping tip.

These are great! I make them every Christmas - my kids love them. I enjoy how easy they are to make. The anise is a delightful flavor combined with the lemon icing

I've made basic dough for the last 3 Christmases, but until now I stuck to jelly bowl cookies & cranberry orange oatmeal. This year I vowed to make these because I love spice cookies! This recipe is easy and the cookies good! I didn't have anise seed so substitued 1/4t allspice.

These cookies always get rave reviews and friends request them year after year. I often omit the anise seed.

I made these cookies for a tropical theme wedding shower. I added macadamian nuts for a little crunch. I loved that they could be made in advance.

These are okay - they'd be way prettier cut out with cookie cutters, as someone else suggested. They're similar to another cookie that I've been making for years, only they're crispy and the others are soft. I like the soft kind, so I'll stick with the recipe I have.

I thought the dough was a little dry, then I realized I forgot to add the honey. But the cookies still turned out nice. I didn't have the spices called for on hand, I used a mixture of cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, all spice and ground ginger.

Made this with the honey, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and five-spice powder because those are my favorite spices; they were subtle and lovely. I rolled them out thinly, and cut them into shapes, and they were perfect! I did find the icing worked better just spread on with a knife--sprinkle w/a dash of sprinkles, and it hardened beautifully. A really attractive, delicious and elegant cookie.
