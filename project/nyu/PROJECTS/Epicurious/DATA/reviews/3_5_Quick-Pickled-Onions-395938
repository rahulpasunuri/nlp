I had these onions when I visited Merida, Yucatan for a wedding, and they were served to me in my friend's home as a topping for a sandwich (which was made with some yummy sliced pork the likes of which I have not seen in the States). I fell in love with them then and make them frequently as a topping for tacos. They could be probably be used with any sandwich such as cold cuts, or hamburger too, I would think. They are super easy to make and worth a try.
