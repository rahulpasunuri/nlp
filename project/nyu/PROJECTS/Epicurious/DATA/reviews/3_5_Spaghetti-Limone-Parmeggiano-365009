This was simple and quick to make. I added garlic to the lemon/cheese mixture and threw in a couple of handfuls of arugula but otherwise made to the recipe. I thought it was good. Simple but flavorful. Great comfort food.

i absolutely love this and find i always have the ingredients so its an easy go to. i add handfuls of baby spinach at the basil stage, add cracked black pepper to the sauce, and use whole wheat pasta. a favorite.

Easy and tasty. It doesn't have enough oomph to stand on its own, however, and needs a piece of fish or meat and a side salad, to complete it as a full meal. I used Parmigiano Reggiano, which gave it a very complex flavor. With a dish as simple as this one, you need to use only the freshest and highest quality ingredients.

This was exceptional. I added scallops and it was wonderful. Mmmmmmmm

Sadly, the hardest part about this recipe was finding a block of Parmesan to grate! My local store didn't have any - only the pre-shaved, bottled kind, so I had to go with that since I was in a rush. It made the lemon and cheese paste not quite the right consistency, but the taste was still great! I think the dish will be really phenomenal if I can get the right cheese next time.

This was absolutely delicious and super easy. I'm making it again for a dinner party tonight, adding shrimp to make it more hearty and healthy. Well done, Gwinnie.

This is good as is for a side, but I like to add to the strainer before draining the pasta a bunch of arugula. I also add in sauteed shrimp and/or scallops as well to make a main out of this dish

This was a good weeknight pasta - we did chop the basil before adding and added paste back to pasta in hot, empty pasta cooking pot. Used more lemon juice and drizzled extra virgin olive oil over the top. Good starter course, light dinner or side as part of a dinner with maybe grilled sausages & salad.

Quick, easy, and tasty. I'd change a couple things though next time: chop the basil fine, and mix it in with the cheese AFTER adding the pasta. Making the cheese/lemon mix and then dumping the pasta on top of it left big gobs of cheese - it didn't mix in smoothly at all. Used angel hair. Could have used a little more lemon, too - I'd use 1 1/2 lemons next time. But there will definitely be a next time!

Nothing too special. One-dimensional. Would not make again.

Very tasty, although I found that regular spaghetti (even 3/4 of the box) rather overwhelmed the delicate lemon and Parmesan flavor (too much spaghetti--the 'sauce' couldn't cover all of it well). Next time I think I'll try using angel hair or reducing the regular spaghetti to a half box or less in order to find a better balance. Would definitely make again, although this light dish could probably benefit from some excellent sides to bolster it at a meal.

Tasty and easy. Added chicken marinated in lemon juice, and it was great. The basil is a nice touch, though I'd probably chop it next time instead of tearing. This will definitely enter the rotation!

Super easy. My husband who is very picky even loved it. I will make this again. We ate with chicken.

I just got my copy of GP's new cookbook, and this was the first recipe I made. This was wonderful. It all came together so easily,and even my picky 18 month old son absolutely loved it. This is truly a perfect weeknight meal, with a green salad on the side. Easy, affordable, comfort food, and healthy to boot.
