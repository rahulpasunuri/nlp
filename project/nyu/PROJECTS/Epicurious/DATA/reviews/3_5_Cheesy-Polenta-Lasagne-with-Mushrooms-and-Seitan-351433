I made this with a LOT of changes and it was very good. I only had one tube of polenta so I made the rest of the recipe as is, made the polenta slices a little thinner and served it all in a small casserole dish about half the size of a lasagna pan. I also made it vegan by using, instead of the cheese sauce, a lemon thyme cashew cheeze sauce from the website Oh She Glows (I changed the herb from the Lemon Basil Cheeze sauce she uses in her lasagna). Much more healthy!

I'd say this was good, but not great. I've never been a fan of pre-made rolled polenta and this dish, sadly, did not change my mind. The polenta just had a rubbery texture that was disappointing. This recipe made a ton so I am still working my way through the leftovers. My husband thought it was ok, my daughter gave it a definite thumbs down. Bottom line: it was too much work for an average dish.

Delicious. The only change I made was adding some leftover rotisserie chicken instead of the seitan. Not the prettiest dish in the world, but what it lacks in beauty it makes up in taste. Everyone loved it and I would not change a thing.

For all those that want to make it healthier, may I suggest the following substitutions (Mine came out great with these changes, and it was delicious with less guilt!) Instead of a half (?!) stick of unsalted butter, use Olive Oil. Instead of Whole Milk, use Low fat or Skim milk. It may take slightly longer to thicken, but it will get there. I had a nice thick sauce with skim milk. To improve the flavor profile (especially if you have cut out the butter and whole milk) I suggest: Using a mix of mushrooms, I used Cremini and Shitake. Adding either truffle oil or truffle cheese to the sauce. Sottocerene is what I used, and is top notch and top dollar. Trader Joe's makes a decent truffle cheese that will work well too. To improve presentation: Instead of making in a large baking dish, make in smaller personal sized dishes. This improves the look, and makes it easy to serve as well. Variations: I am a vegetarian, but my gf is not, so I used two smaller skillets and made one with Seitan, one with chicken. Using the smaller serving dishes helped this happen, and made making everyone happy a breeze!

Just a comment on the recipe for making this a vegan dish. The reviewer used Smart Balance, which is a type of margarine. However, it IS NOT vegan. It contains whey, which is from milk. To make this totally vegan, instead, use Earth Balance. This is truly a vegan maargarine, and can be found at most health food stores. I've not tried this recipe yet, but am looking forward to it.

I haven't made this yet but want to add my comment regarding the remarks about it being for vegetarians who don't care about their health. I have complained for years about prepared vegetarian foods not being satisfying. I am health conscious but the reason I am a vegetatrian (not a vegan) is because I don't want to eat animals! No other reason. I don't eat fatty foods everyday but I also don't starve myself. I don't know why so many people equate vegetarianism with being on a strict diet low fat diet. I believe more people would try meatless dishes if they had more flavor. There are times when fat is good! I can't wait to try this dish. It is recipes like this that are slowly converting my husband to a meatless lifestyle.

I'm not sure I would make this again for a normal meal simply because it was so richly creamy and cheesy, but for a special occasion it was really tasty. I'm just not sure who it caters to, though - un-health conscious vegetarians?

This lasagne was creamy, flavorful, and easy to make. I would definitely make this for guests (especially because it can be made a day ahead.) Instead of Fontina I used the French version: Fontal, and it was perfect. Furthermore, I used grilled eggplant in lieu of the seitan and the flavors melded wonderfully. My only vice with this recipe is that it produces a bit too much cheese sauce...but who cares? It's delicious!

Made this last night for dinner and it was delicious! Even my non-veggie loving hubby loved it! I think there was enough cheese to all to enjoy. My next task is to figure out how to make it a little healthier.

This was absolutely divine! I made some major changes though! I made it completely vegan with NO cheese! I also made my own polenta from another recipe on this site. I made a vegan cream sauce by using 2 cups of unsweetened plain soy milk (West Soy brand), about 10 TBLS of Smart Balance spread, 1 cup of Tofuttie's Soy Supreme sour cream (tastes just like the real thing...so does their "cream cheese"!) 3TBLS of flour, some Italian seasoning, and about a 1/4 tsp of fresh grated nutmeg. I cooked on the stove until thick and bubbly. I made the mushroom mixture the same except I used fake chicken instead of the Seitan. Oh for those of you who care...to make soymilk like whipping cream use a 75% soymilk to 25% vegan margarine(Smart Balance is my fav). I haven't been able to actually whip this to make whipped cream...but maybe i needed to cook it first, but I digress! Even without the cheese this was uber fabulous! If you have a vegan cheese that's good then add that for even more creamy goodness! Not the healthiest vegan, but a heck of a lot healthier than the origonal recipe!!!

Love this. Let it sit for a little while before serving so that it holds it's shape. We are meat lovers and were wary of the seitan - I've never had it and loved it - but the whole thing worked together so well. Creamy, comforting, tasty, unusual. We bought high quality fontina - definitely worth the extra expense. Another one added to the permanent files. Even our 2 year old ate 2 bowls full!

Very good recipe. I will make it again. However I didn't use seitan since I didn't have it. I cut one chicken breast into small pieces and cooked it with the mushrooms. Good change from traditional lasagna.

This wasn't really quick or healthy. It was basically baked Mac and Cheese only with polenta as the starch, and adding some mushrooms and seitan (which, as a meat eater, was surprisingly delicious and satisfying). I followed the recipe fairly close, and found the final product very gloppy- not presentable to company- but very rich and tasty. Comfort vegetarian food.

Delicious for vegetarians & meat eaters alike! Yum.

Wonderful dish. I added a 10 oz bag of shopped spinach and about a cup of julienned sun-dried tomatoes to the filling. Delicious variation of an old favorite. Would be a great company dish.

I made it exactly as directed and it was delicious, and very rich, but still, needs some adjustments. I ended up having too little sauce and filling so next time, I'd make twice the mushrooms (at least) and try to cut down on the fat by making the bechamel much lighter.

A super easy and super delicious comfort food dish.
