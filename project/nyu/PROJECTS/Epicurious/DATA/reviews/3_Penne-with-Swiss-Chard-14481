I think this is the easiest and tastiest use of chard. Mind you I didn't use the chalks.

Liked it, but didn't love it. I followed the recipe exactly. Think it would benefit from some garlic and/or some of the additions other cooks have suggested.

i added a few touches from a similar recipe on marthastewart.com.: lemon zest and a slug of white wine. i also sauteed veg in a mix of butter and olive oil, and added a minced clove of garlic to the onion. cream is essential!

I made with whole wheat rigatoni, used escarole instead of swiss chard (what I had on hand) and added a can of white beans. I imagine this would be good with spinach as well. I topped it with fresh grated pecorino romano. It turned out really delicious--a terrific side dish for my meat eating boyfriend and a great main me for me, the vegetarian!

I added mild, pork italian sausage and garlic and it was excellent

This simple recipe was surprisingly good. The only thing I did differently is added the swiss chard stems before the leaves so they had extra time to cook. The hot pepper, hint of nutmeg and parmesan cheese added just the right amount of flavor.

Maybe more like 3 and a half forks -- this has become a weeknight staple. I add sliced vegetarian Italian sausage to the onions when sauteeing, and usually use half-and-half instead of cream. Yummers.

Wonderful and easy. We use campanelle pasta.

Delicious and easy. A definite keeper. I substituted 1/2+1/2 for the heavy cream for a slightly healthier version, and added garlic.

I substituted orzo for the penne (not the whole 6 oz. though) and omitted the heavy cream and nutmeg and just added a tiny bit of olive oil instead and a clove of chopped garlic (with the butter). Everything else was the same. I needed a side dish and this was perfect. It was delicious and healthy--I have to hide my veggies in recipes like this so I'll eat them!

So easy and so delicious! I added two links of hot italian turkey sausage, sliced into thin pieces. My brother was visiting and changed his mind about staying for dinner when he saw the dish! It's a good thing I made extra! Also, to make this extra easy, use a can of already diced tomatoes and garlic in jar!

Certainly easy and quick to make, but it seemed too dry to properly coat the pasta. Next time... more cream!
