Made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it. I took one reviewers suggestion to marinate in mustard, honey, dill, and I added Greek yogurt. I basted occasionally during grilling. It came out moist and tender.

Way better than I thought it would be! Not something I would typically make, and the flavours were new to us as well. Took everyones advice and halved the water, The dijon had a great kick. The pickles were fun, my 3 year old giggled while eating them. The meat, pickles and sauce in one bite.... yum! My husband who is a health nut and can be picky - had seconds and then thirds! I roasted in the oven for 25 min at 350. Took out at 150 degrees and let rest for 10. It was perfect.

I really wish I had followed the advice of many reviewers and eliminated or seriously cut back on the amount of water added to the sauce. It simply ran off the meat and into the grill. I threw it out and made a second batch of sauce with 1 T. water and served it with the cooked meat. The end product and the very good pickled zucchini made for a very tasty meal with plenty of leftovers for great sandwiches the next day.

I would give this 3 1/2 forks if possible. So easy and very flavorsome. Did cut back on the water in the sauce. And I agree with everyone, the pickles are a delightful addition. Trussed the meat up the nite before Easter.Served with deviled eggs, macaroni salad, asparagus & home made apple sauce. Now in my recipe box.

What a simple wonderful dinner that my husband and I both loved! I did use only 1/4 cup of water as others reccommended for the Mustard-Dill Sauce. The Zucchini pickles are a must and complement the pork perfectly and so easy to make! Used 2 packages of dill to get the amount needed for the recipe. I also basted the pork with the sauce while grilling and still had plenty of sauce for serving. It did take less than an hour to make. Love it, love it!

This recipe was delicious, my husband, 3-year old daughter, and I enjoyed it. Per previous review recommendations I held with water from the sauce. We decided the flavor of the sauce was strong and potent. If serving to guests who tastes I'm not sure of, in the future I will spread the sauce on the tenderloin with each turn on the grill rather than serve with the finished product.

The true highlight of this dish is the part that's not in the title - the zucchini pickles! They take just 10 minutes to make. The pickles are amazing, and I'll be making them all summer as a side. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

This was my first time cooking pork tenderloin and it definitely won't be my last! The flavours combine beautifully. I followed the recipe with two exceptions: rather than adding water to the sauce, I added a few tablespoons of yoghurt, and I used the sauce as a marinade for the pork. The results were lovely. Please, please, please, do not skimp on the zucchini pickles! They are fantastic, and they make the dish, in my opinion. They also transform the sandwiches of leftover pork the next day into something amazing.

I didn't make the zucchini, but the Pork was excellent. I took the advice of others and reduced the water in the mustard/dill sauce to 1/4 cup. I also used it as a marinade. I turned the pork every 5 minutes on the grill and applied a new layer of marinade.

No zucchini in Dominica, but I substituted christofine with excellent results.

I have to agree with Mtn View - zucchini was good but sauce way too watery. Would try again with less or no water in sauce.

This recipe was so easy! And it was great for when you're craving something that is bursting with strong flavors. I used an intense stone-ground mustard instead of dijon. Also, I baked this in the oven for 25 mintues @ 350... it turned out PERFECT.

I'm surprised that this recipe has gotten such good reviews. I loved the pickles (although I'm not big on raw zucchini so I substituted persian cucumbers) and though I liked the flavor of dill and mustard with the pork, I found the sauce extremely watery. It did not stick to the tenderloin before grilling and was not a nice sauce consistency to serve with the finished product.

Simple to prepare and flavorful.

Seriously yummy! This is so delicate & beautiful, even my little daughters loved it! We roasted the pork at 375 for an hour & it was LOVELY!! The zucchini were divine once I took them earlier @ gentlman's advice. Just a lovely spring meal!

This looks good. Plus, I think the calories and fat are overestimated a little bit. I see each serving to be about 200-250, depending if all the fat is trimmed away.

I did not have the white balsamic vinegar substituted red wine vinegar instead.

This sounds delicious but I don't have a grill. Can I roast it?

Very good and very quick, great flavour especially if you like dill. I added extra sauce to tenderloin while cooking and would leave the mustard dill mix off the zuchini next time as they were great with balsamic vinegar mariande alone.

Will definitely make this again. I even forgot to add the 1/2 cup of water for the sauce and it wasn't too over-powering. My 10 and 12 year olds even loved it.

First review on this site....both the pork and the zucchini had a great flavor. Definitely not subtle. My wife doesn't eat pork, so I additionally grilled some chicken breasts for her with the sauce on it and she loved it. Next time I'll stick to 10 minutes marinating the zucchini. I went a while longer and the vinegar flavor was a little too strong. Also, I'll grill the pork over indirect heat, so the pork isn't as blackened.
