This dessert was the pièce de résistance of our Italian dinner party! Everyone loved it and the Marsala sauce is to die for - I am still heating it up and enjoying it with strawberries and ice cream. Only changes were to use a different cookie for the base and light corn syrup instead of dark. Try it - you will love it!

I love the amaretti crust, and the zabaglione itself is really rich and delicious. The only issue my guests and I had was that we found the currants much too overpowering for the subtleties of the custard and sauce. If I were to make this again, I would halve the amount of currants or omit them all together. I would agree, this is a huge custard, it filled an 11 inch tart pan over 1 inch thick.

I made this for our dinner club's Italian night. After a delicious, very filling meal, I was pleasantly surprised to see my dessert was the biggest hit! My friends were almost licking their plates.

I've made this twice. You might think it's a complicated recipe, but it isn't.I fiddled with the crust. (The first time I made it with graham cracker crumbs and 1tsp. almond extract; the second time I made it with crushed Vanilla wafers and 1 tsp. almond extract. I reduced the sugar in the zabaglione custard a bit. There is wiggle room to do all this because there's no baking involved. This isn't chemistry, folks--it's fun!! As the reader from Africa wrote, there is much room for experimentation!) I also served it with heaps of strawberries because the berries REALLY make the dish a keeper! This is not a dessert for children,people with alcohol "issues" or the feint of heart. (And I do mean that literally! The custard has TEN yolks and whipped cream!!) I also found that because it's so rich, small slices of the pie are okay. The recipe could possibly serve ten if you increase the strawberries. It received accolades from those who've tasted it...and it is now part of my recipe collection.

Limited by our iffy African grocery stores, I made some substitutions (10ish Digestive biscuits and 1/2 c. coconut for amaretti, and 2/3 full cream sherry and 1/3 altar wine--yes, altar wine--for the port), omitted the whipped cream altogether (I'd have had to use rancid cream if I wanted any), and just crossed my fingers that I'd heated the eggs enough to kill the Salmonella spp. that were surely inside. I also poured about 3/4 c. of something approximating chocolate ganache over the crust prior to filling with the custard. Still and all, this absolutely slayed everyone at the table. The filling was sweet and boozy, the crust was chewy-crunchy, and the chocolate took it absolutely over the top. Will certainly make again.

This is the most delightful dessert I've ever had! There wasn't a face at the dinner party last night that wasn't in rapture as they savoured every mouthful. What a treat!

I made this for an Italian-themed neighborhood dinner party. The hostess raved about it and said that it and the cheesecake w/strawberries in balsamic vinegar (also found at epicurious.com) were the best desserts she's ever had. Others were also enthisiastic. It is an interesting combination and contrast of different flavors.
