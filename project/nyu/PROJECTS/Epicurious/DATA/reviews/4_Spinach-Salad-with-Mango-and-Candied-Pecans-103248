This salad was fabulous. I made it almost exactly per the recipe except used a spinach-mesclun blend of greens and added Montrachet goat cheese cut into cubes on top (to avoid white streaks throughout the salad). Highly recommend using Manila mangoes, which are smaller, sweeter, and less fibrous than typical Hawaiian mangoes, if you can find them. The candied pecans are heavenly and the simple dressing is perfect.

Very delicious...and elegant. I've made this several times with mango. I love it accompanied with a nice savory tart or quiche for a luncheon, like my French Onion and Bacon Tart. The vinegary and sweet combo of the salad cuts the saltiness of the tart.

I just made the persimmon version of this two nights in a row, and it was great. Also added the goat cheese per the suggestions of everyone and I don't think I would ever make the salad without it. Not only does it improve the taste (it balances the sweetness of the pecans and fruit), but it really adds another textural layer to the salad. I did not pack the brown sugar, though, and the nuts were still plenty sweet. Also, my partner who really won't eat salads or vegetables loved it, even when I added arugula on the second night.

I tried the persimmon version, and added pomegranate seeds for color and a burst of tartness to offset the sweetness of the pecans and the dressing. It was fantastic! A definite keeper.

Good salad. Mango is a nice addition to a holiday salad. The pecans were nice. The balsamic was not overpowering. I would say it's a good standard salad, but nothing over the top.

Not too difficult to make, and it was very tasty. I was a little concerned about the balsamic vinegar in the candied pecans, but they tasted just fine in the salad. My husband was late to dinner, and the spinach wilted too quickly. I would recommend keeping the dressing on the side.

This was simplicity at it's best. My husband and I enjoyed this salad with dinner this evening. I believe it is key to the recipe to use baby spinach leaves so the greens are tender and the mango is ripe so the sweetness compliments the other ingredients. The nuts were lovely and the perfect compliment to the salad. I highly recommend this recipe to all!

I made only the pecans from this recipe and they were excellent, fast and easy to make. I used them in a spinach salad with fresh sliced mushrooms, red pepper, blue cheese crumbled, and a balsamic vinaigrette with dijon and shallot. It got rave reviews and recipe requests. The nuts gave it a special feeling perfect for the christmas eve dinner I brought it to. This candied nut recipe is going in my recipe box as the go - to one from now on.

Just made the candied pecans for another recicpe on this site (mixed greens with pecans, goat cheese and dried cranberries). They are fabulous and it will take all my self control to not eat them all before I make the salad for our dinner guests.

i make this salad all of the time. it is great with indian dishes because of the mango. it is great with everything. its important to melt the sugar thoroughly and then add the nuts in until they actually roast. otherwise the glaze will be dull and brittle. i use walnuts instead of pecans b/c of the higher omega-3 and omega-6 content.

Spinach salad with mango and candied nuts? Fine. Just not these nuts, in my opinion. Maybe I didn't make them right, but the coating was dull and sort of thick, and the balsamic flavor bugged me. I doubled the recipe for the nuts based on other reviewer comments and threw away all but the handful I put on the salad. Several of my guests left pecans on their plate but ate all the salad. The salad was good - I added goat cheese because I always like that sweet/sour contrast.

Made this recently for a salad potluck and it was the hit of the party! It was delicious. The only thing I would say is that the mango can be substituted for any sweet fruit like peach. Make sure though that the fruit is sweet otherwise it doesn't taste half as good.

Everyone loves this salad. I add red pepper chunks and canned corn and I think it makes even better. For the dressing I use more vinegar, half the oil and add brown sugar or mango juice to sweeten. I prefer salad greens to the spinach.

I've made this salad for several dinner parties and always to rave reviews. I have substituted the balsamic vinegar with Vincotto (a fig vinegar) and was also very good. I double the pecans so I have leftovers (yum). I tossed with dressing at the last minute. There is really twice as much dressing as needed, so maybe those that didn't rate it as well "overdressed" the salad. Just a thought.

This was surprisingly boring once I made it. I followed the recipe exactly. The dressing was very oily and bland. I will make it again but I'll use field greens and a different dressing. The mangos and pecans are great together!

Rating: 4
Candied pecans are an ultimate combination of sweet and sour. They almost didn't make it to the salad -- guests and I were snacking on them so much. Now, whenever I make them, I use a whole bag of pecans, not just 1 cup. Fresh mangoes are a must in the salad; tried Trader Joe's frozen mango pieces and they were altogether too mushy and sloppy.

Rating: 3
Very, very good. Will make again but use mango chunks instead of slices (for ease of preparation). Did not use all the dressing - 1/2 was sufficient for spinach to be thoroughly coated.

This is a really tasty and refreshing salad. I used candied pecans from Trader Joe's, so it was a snap to prepare. I used arugula instead of spinach, as I prefer it, and I could see adding some chopped red onion. But, it was great as is, and so easy. Enjoy!

I will add to the positive reviews for this salad, even though I changed the fruit and nuts like many of the other reviewers. Walnuts are a favorite of my boyfriend, and when I went to cut into my mango, I discovered that a large part of the interior had actually gone bad. Luckily I had some strawberries in the refrigerator. But this was one of the tastier salad I have eaten, and by the far the best one I have prepared. Normally I try too hard, but the simplicity of the ingredients really made this salad work. Everything complimented each other well, and the balsamic vinegar in the dressing and on the nuts really pulled it all together. I'm sure it would be equally delicious with mango, and the presentation even more impressive. The only thing I would change would be too cut down on the oil a bit. As listed, the salad was a bit oilier than I would prefer, but I don't normally use much dressing.

WONDERFUL salad. I had some extra mangos getting ripe and found this recipe searching for a way to use them up. I LOVE the pecans - they worked out just as the recipe read.

I'm commenting on the candied pecans for the most part- these were easy to make..my pecans were frozen and when cooked in the sugar mixture, took slightly longer than the suggested 7 minutes. I then popped them in the oven for a about 7 - 10 minutes as one reviewer suggested. The pecans cooled nicely and are crispy and delicious. Will definitely make this again!!!

These taste good but are too sticky. I think the balsamic vinegar causes that. I'll use a different recipe for candied nuts; one that doesn't leave the nuts so sticky.

Wonderful recipe! I'm not a fan of nuts, but the candied pecans are very, very tasty. I did find that seven minutes was too long to cook the pecans - they would have burned. Instead on seven minutes, I found that about half that time worked well for me. As others have mentioned, double (at least) the candied nuts as they as were almost gone before I assembled the salad for my dinner party.

I've already made this dish twice, each time a little different. I added caramelized onion, blueberries and blue cheese to my store bought balsamic vinegrette the first time and it was an excellent balance of flavors between the candied pecans and blue cheese. The second time I used strawberries and omitted the onions. I kept the rest the same as the first time. The possibilities are endless. An excellent salad.

Made this for a Mother's day dinner last night and got rave reviews. As my parents are not mango fans, I substituted sliced fresh strawberries. I also used a different balsamic vinaigrette dressing (also on this site) and that didn't go over well with the two men at the table. Perhaps it was the shallots and Dijon mustard in that vinaigrette, but both my husband and father said the dressing was too tart and bitter, while my mom and I loved it. Go figure.... Anyway, the whole salad (especially the pecans) was very easy and delicious. After all the reviews about having trouble keeping the pecans for the salad, I decided to double the recipe and now have some really wonderful (if highly caloric) snacks for a while. I'll try this again with a different dressing and different fruit or combination of fruits, like kiwi and mango, or papaya, or peaches. The possibilities with all the wonderful summer fruit are endless.

This was a super good salad that was very easy to toss together because I just so happened to have some candied pecans in the house already. I recommend buying premade pecans because they were great, and it seems to be the only problem anyone has had with this salad. I thought the mangos were too slippery a fruit for this dish. Next time I will use green apples instead and add warm goat cheese. (Making it a completely different salad, I guess, but that's okay!!) :)

I just made this salad and had a hard time deciding on how many forks to give it. The method of cooking the nuts didn't really work for me, as the sugar seemed to burn before the nuts got toasted. Next time, i think i'd toast the nuts separately first and then quickly sautee them in the syrup. Other than that, i think this salad has potential. I added a bit of sugar to the dressing and added chopped green onion. That seemed to 'kick it up a notch."

Was a great recipe! The leftover candied pecans are great for snacking on! I did a little variation and used sliced pears and goat cheese instead of the mango.

I thought this salad was so-so. I guess because I make another one like it with a sweet dressing that everyone loves and asks me for the recipe, it has scallions, caramelized sliced almonds and mandarin orange sections. I think that one is much better. I had trouble getting the pecans in this to get crunchy in the oven, and even took the advice of another reviewer to bake in a low oven, but still no luck, but the mango came out very well (I usually have a hard time with mango). I also added a little sugar to the dressing, I thought it needed more pizzazz.

Excellent salad! I added some finely diced red onion and I made my dressing with less oil. The nuts are especially tasty--since I already had the oven on, I put them in a non-stick small roasting pan at 450 with the vinegar and sugar (no oil), checking them often, for about 15 minutes. Then I spread them on a plate and refrigerated them, so they hardened quickly and were cool when added to the salad. I'll definitely make this again.
