Like others I used this as a base to make my own recipe. Added dried tyme and a dozen full cloves of garlic to the carrots and cooked them longer then recipe stated. I served it cold on a base of salad and added others suggestions for the dressing (lemon juice, olive oil & balsamic vinegar). It made for both a hardy & refeshing salad.

This is obviously just basic guidelines on how to roast beets and carrots with room for your own seasoning additions. I added a lot of lemon juice and a little pumpkin oil, a little cilantro (which I don't recommend) and they were very good. it's hard to go wrong with beets and carrots

For Thanksgiving Dinner I had to bring two vegetable side dish recipes. I made this recipe and "Cauliflower with Mustard-Lemon Butter" also from this site. Everyone liked both recipes. I ended up using only 3 of the 6 beets I bought. I think 6 would have been too much. 3 beets made the dish 50% beets and 50% carrots. I also took the advice from other reviewers and added some balsamic vinegar, evoo, fresh thyme, and lemon juice. With these changes its a definite 4 fork recipe.

I took this to a holiday potluck dinner where it was well received, even by the non-beet eaters. It works well at room temperature. After reading the reviews, here's what I tweaked: I tossed the roasted vegetables with 3 Tablespoons balsamic vinegar, 3 Tablespoons e.v. olive oil, zest of 1 lemon, and ~2 Tablespoons fresh tarragon. A squeeze of fresh lemon juice when warming it up the next day worked well.

Delicious. I roasted at 400 because I also had chicken in the oven. I used another reviewer's suggestion to add 3 Tbs. extra virgin olive oil and 3 Tbs. balsamic vinegar, the zest of 1 lemon, and fresh thyme at the end. I tossed this with the roasted beets and carrots, added a sweet onion cut in wedges, then returned everything to the oven and roasted for another 15 mins at 425. Beautiful and delicious! The foil keeps the beets moist while the roasting intensifies their flavor; the carrots needed a longer roasting time than called for. (4 forks for flavor and appearance; 3 forks because time/temp seemed a little off.)

It is time consuming to roast beets, however it is easy. I seasoned with salt and pepper and threw in some fresh rosemary, which was ok... I think the recipe could benefit from the added flavor of an herb but I am not sure which one would be the best pick.

This is now my husbands favorite recipe! I followed the directions exactly but added the following after they were done roasting. Whisk 3 Tbs. extra virgin olive oil and 3 Tbs. balsamic vinegar. Add the zest of 1 lemon. Add fresh (or dried) thyme & margoram to taste. Toss with roasted beets and carrots. Gives it a great flavor.

This was a huge crowd pleaser. Even my most fussy eaters loved it. I saved the greens and sauteed them until tender in olive oil with chopped garlic, shallots and a little salt & pepper. I couldn't believe it when my vegetable-challenged son said they were "awesome."

I'd never cooked with beets before trying this recipe, and I was very happy with the way it turned out. I might add a few herbs next time.

I have made this several times. I love the beautiful colors. I add a coarsely chopped onion to the carrots, I like the added flavor. Also maybe some sage leaves, if I have them handy. Its just a nice dish for fall/winter, and seems to accompany a wide variety of meats well.

Pretty good, but I agree that the carrots needed more than 20 minutes in the oven. I think this would benfit from something else added, maybe honey or herbs. Will try it again though.

Love this! I serve it with roast chicken, it makes a beautiful color contrast. I also add a bit of chopped onion to the carrots. Leftovers the next day are awesome!!!

This dish was served at our Thanksgiving dinner this year -- it was just beautiful to look at, and so sweet to taste. I bought an assortment of various colored smaller beets (golden, red, and purple) and roasted the beets, then the carrots, early in the day. All that was needed prior to meal time was another 15 minutes in the oven (to heat through). The carrots were a bit firm (my family likes them that way, but if I'd had more time, I might've cooked 'em a bit longer) but the combination of flavors and colors was great! Definitely a keeper and would be great when entertaining guests (nice presentation).

The best with roast beef! Colourful, tasty and sooo simple. Reheats beautifully just before dinner.

Yummy veggies. The texture and mouthfeel of these roasted root vegetables make you think you're eating high fat when you're not! I added parsnips to the mix, using a pound of carrots and a pound of parsnips with the beets. The secret here is plenty of salt, and the lemon juice adds a wonderful depth without brining attention to itself. Good stuff!

I loved this recipe! I read the reviews ahead of time, so I added lemon juice and it was the perfect touch. The dish is so colorful - it is very eye appealing.

I used gold as well as red beets -- so colorful with the orangey carrots. After roasting I squeezed in the juice of one lemon and then tossed with thyme and dill. Very nice as a side dish with pork.

This was so easy and colorful. I cut the carrots and beets in small wedges and made it the day before and reheated it. I added lemon juice and parlsy but will try a different herb next time.

Having been a beet and carrot lover all my life this sounded like a sure thing. I followed the recipe exactly. The beets are good, but don't really taste that different from the canned ones. Next time I'll add the lemon that another writer suggested. BUT, the CARROTS.... Wow, they tasted almost sweet - so delicious that I could have consumed them all myself. The overall dish is lovely, very colorful with chopped parsley over the deep red and the orange, served in my celadon bowl. Be sure to add butter (and lemon) before dishing up - that was the only thing missing in a very good vegetable dish.

All 4 kids will eat this one. Herbs and spice to taste though. We pre cook the beets and finish roasting on the grill. Great out doors!

Simple and delicious. I did have larger beets and had to roast a bit longer. This combination is great together.

The carrots are a nice touch, but overall this is a little bland. Definitely needs some lemon juice and spices.

Delicious, and can be made ahead of time. I have also been asked for the recipe, and have directed all to your terrific web site.

I am changing my review of this dish, realized that my taste buds were tainted by a head cold. I had said they were dry and I would not make them again. When I reheated leftovers in a hot oven, the veggies became softer and tasted much better. I think they needed longer roasting the first time, perhaps I cut the carrots too thick. Also added the touch of lemon suggested. Still think they need some fresh tarragon and will do that next time.

I've made this twice in about a month for two vastly different crowds and received rave reviews both times. In fact, two people who looked at the beets like I had put worms on their plates ended up asking for the recipe. Adding the juice of half a lemon and a handful or two of fresh chopped parsley right before serving or right before going into the oven for the final warm-up is a nice addition

It went really well with the Gourmet menu for brined pork chops and mashed potatoes with turnips and horseradish. I have to admit (ok, I'm ashamed), I've never had a fresh beet until today, only pickled/canned. YUM! Even my vegetable-hesitant husband ate them. He loved the carrots and "tolerated" the beets quite well!

made this with short ribs and it was outstanding! A wonderful winter side vegetable.
