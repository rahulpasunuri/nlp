Made this many times as a family birthday favorite. Fresh parm/reg a must. Have used a combination of dried breadcrumbs and panko in place of fresh breadcumbs. Add cheese slowly off the heat so it does not seize up.

Cut the recipe in half for 2 of us, using one chicken breast cut in strips and 1/4lb shrimp. To flesh out the recipe and get rid of some broccoli, I steamed broccoli florets. The broccoli was added to the sauce with the chicken and shrimp. I was rather generous with the parm. It was a hit! Next time I might add frozen peas instead of the broccoli-I like the crunch and color of a veg.

This is excellent! It is perfect for entertaining. We cut the chicken up in small pieces before cooking it since it is less messy.

My boyfriend makes this for me when he wants to curry my favor - it always works! As I have celiac disease, he uses GF noodles, and, what with the whipping cream and cheese in the sauce, you would never notice the difference. We also found that crushed corn flakes are a perfect substitute for bread crumbs.

This recipe is excellent. I omit the shrimp. It is a lighter version of an alfredo sauce. My kids all love it!

I have made this recipe for years and it is one of our family's favorites. Because my husband doesn't like shrimp, I use a diced red pepper and some onion in its place. I agree you have to serve it pretty much right away for best effect.

This was easy and very good. I didn't have any shrimp, but the dish was fine with chicken alone. I should have listened to the other reviews though about doubling the sauce; I will next time. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a couple of cloves of garlic to the sauce. I can see how people had some problems with the sauce coming together. You really need to serve this right away. I let it sit til my husband came home and the sauce kind of evaporated and I had to add more cream. Regardless, it was still very good-my husband loved it.

This is a great change for a creamed based pasta recipe. I had made several times when it first appeared but had forgot about it till today. I agree on upping the cayenne and I also like to add a little thyme to the sauce instead of more parsley.

Rating: 4
I was heavy handed with the cayenne because that's the way I like it, ditto with the parmesan. The result was fantastic. I'm embarrassed to admit that it only ended up serving two since we both went back for seconds, much to my roommates chagrin (they were hoping for the scraps).

Just looked this up again so I could send my dad the link; made it when he was out here and he really liked it. Don't understand the less-than-impressed, but to each his/her own.

This is so delicious! I've made it twice and both times it has been excellent. The chicken is so tender and flavorful. The shrimp is good too, but you could leave it out if you didn't have any. Everybody's taste buds are different, but I'm not sure where the "bland" comments came from....this dish is far from bland. Matter of fact, I doubled the sauce this time while keeping the original amount of cayenne, and it still had plenty of flavor. Used 1C whipping cream and 1C half and half, and once mixed with the pasta it was fine. Thanks to the lady who suggested one egg - I hate to waste. Might I also suggest cutting the bread crumb mixture in half....you'll never use the whole two cups, I threw a bunch away. This ain't diet food, but it is wonderful and does remind me of a meal in a New Orleans restaurant. Such fond memories.

Just ok. I felt the breading along with the cream sauce wasn't a good combination.

First of all, I am absolutely amazed at how good just the chicken is! After I panneed it, I tasted it, and it was SOOOO succulent and juicy and delicious! Anyway, the complete dish is just out of this world. I am from south Louisiana, and I can attest to the fact that is is indeed good New Orleans cuisine. I have no idea how some of the reviewers could have found this to be a bland dish. I also want to note that I had no problems with curdling... Try it! You'll love it!

Not bad, but not great. I can think of much better ways to use a half pound of shrimp...

Made this great dish again last night. Only one change:you don't need 2 eggs. One is more than enough, save the other for another dish.

I used light evaporated milk instead of cream. My sauce curdled - I put in more parmesan than called for because the sauce seemed too bland. Overall, still too bland. I think I will add some garlic next time but overall pretty good recipe.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe. There are just a few extra steps I add. First, I heavily season the shrimp with salt and pepper before putting them in the pan. Also, after browning the chicken, I deglaze the pan with some of the white wine so it picks up the bits of chicken stuck to the pan. Leave these in the pan, add the oil, then cook the shrimp. It really fuses the flavors nicely.

This is a great dish to make for leftovers. It is rich enough to fill you up in one serving. I also agree with increasing the sauce amount--at least by a factor of 2. I also added peas and fresh basil since the recipe lacks veggies. I think it was a nice modification--at least my friends and husband loved it!

DELICIOUS!! I took the others advice and doubled the sauce, I also chopped garlic and added it to the breading. My husband and I ate the whole amount in one day! I can't wait to make this recipe again.

Delicious comfort food. The combination of flavors and textures are wonderful. I added a little more wine at the end because the sauce got very thick. Yummy!

Rating: 4
This is the ultimate in comfort food (that you can serve to guests who will all ask for the recipe). It has become my husband's signature dish and the last time he made it - maybe it was all the wine being consumed and talking with friends while cooking - he used dill instead of the parsley called for in the breading. It was delicious and something no one present would ever think to do! We usually dislike chicken leftovers, but i this case we fight over what little is usually left.

This is a regular in our repertoire. Very very delicious!

There were two problems with this recipe: 1) the chicken took longer than 4 minutes per side to cook - not a big problem - but it threw off the timing a little and 2) the wine/cream sauce kept curdling. I tried and retried the sauce 3 times but couldn't keep it from curdling..so I gave up and made a creamy alfredo sauce instead. I'd try it again, but I'd serve the chicken on the side or over the pasta...squeeze a little lemon juice on the chicken.

Deee-lish! I added a little garlic and a half cup of parmesan to the breading. Will double the sauce recipe next time! It was a little dry. Will probably make this often!

I was looking for a quick but yummy recipe and this turned out to be perfect. My whole family loved it. I added a few favorite herbs to the breadcrumb mixture and put in a little extra cayenne pepper for an added kick. Any kind of pasta also works. I didn't have any fusilli, so I used tricolor bowties. Very good!

Although I use this site frequently for recipes, this is the first time I've rated one. This recipe is fantastic, and I've made it many times. Its great with both chicken and shrimp, or if you only have one of the two on hand, just double the amount.

This was way too bland !

Very tasty. I served it with a red pepper pasta which gave it a nice zing. I just had the leftovers for lunch--good both cold and reheated. Also not too hard to prepare although I cut the chicken into small pieces before I fried it. Worked well!

My husband and I made this tonight and it was superb! We were tempted to serve the breast filets on top of the pasta...but decided to prepare as the recipe dictated, and are we glad!!! We pounded the breasts as others had suggested,and the results were great!

I make this dish often - My wife asks for it more often than any other recipe I make, and I make a lot. I increase the amount of shrimp to about a pound and I do flatten the chicken breasts for more even cooking. Leftovers usually spark a wrestling match around here. Delicious!

Excellent and easy to make for weeknight suppers.(7 and 9 y.o. kids love it) To be quicker, I simply coat chicken with plain breadcrums. I use 10%fat cream rather than 35% whipping cream .

Rating: 3
This is a wonderful dish that even my fussy husband liked. The next time I make it,I will pound the chicken breasts fairly flat and double the sauce. This tasted even better for lunch the next day, so having leftovers is a treat. Also, I would use a pound of shrimp rather than the 1/2 it called for. Try it!

This recipe was quick and easy, but I wouldn't use any additional cayenne. I like spicy, but the amount called for is quite enough. Also, I added some peas when I returned the chicken and shrimp to the sauce.
