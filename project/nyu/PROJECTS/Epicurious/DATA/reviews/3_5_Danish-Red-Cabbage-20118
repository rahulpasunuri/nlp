Made this dish as part of a traditional Danish Christmas dinner. I did not include the apples. All I can say is wow! Normally, I'm not really a fan of red cabbage, but this dish was addictive! I was fighting my husband for the last of the leftovers! The red currant jelly can be difficult to find, but don't leave it out!

Although this is good, it is spectacular, if you add a whole brown onion studded with cloves while cooking. Put in several apples, (peeled and sliced)and remove onion before serving.

My partner is Danish and he says this is exactly as his grandmother used to make. I use equal amounts water and vinegar and leave out the apples....I can never keep my fork out of it while it is cooking, though!!

Turned out great! That is, I loved it, but my husband, a southern pinto beans and cornbread type of guy, passed on it completely after a taste. I used strawberry fig jam. Good flavor if you like the sweet. Might have used a tad more vinegar if more of a sour flavour was desired.

this recipe was very tasty , however there is water mentioned in the directions and no amount is specified. I used 1/2 cup and ended up adding about a 1/4 cup more.

I tripled this recipe for a dinner party and I thought it was excelllent. I did need to add more vinegar and sugar to achieve a good sweet, sour taste.
