On paper it seems a bit strange but what an excellent dish. I found it in a search to use the Cubanelle's that I grew this year. The plant was labeled Frying peppers and I was hoping for the lovely little shishito peppers I get from my CSA but no such luck!! Anyway it led to this recipe so all is good in the end. I downsized the recipe for one very thick strip steak and cooked on the gas grill. Paring with the Chive and Garlic Mashed Potatoes from the menu made for a very satisfying meal.

I'm a novice, but I love to cook. This is one of the best things I've ever made. It's a lot easier to make than at first glance of the recipe. Lot's of taste in the leeks and the vinaigrette. I did change two things. I used tenderloins for the steaks. They're a bit more $, but it was a special occasion. I also topped the whole dish with a small amt of crumbled goat cheese (substituted for queso fresco). The creamy cheese added a nice balance to the acidity of the vinaigrette. I will definitely make this for guests!

I made per recipe. YIKES. Loved it. The leeks just bleed flavor and it works with the meat. The vinaigrette works too. Will make again and again.

I loved the combination of these ingredients! All the flavors just worked so well together. As I was making it, I sampled the individual components, and I have to admit that I had my doubts, but then when it was all put together, it became a definite keeper.

This is very easy, healthy, and very good. The leeks are so sweet they tasts as if sugar were added. Flavors blend beautifully. I would serve this for guests.

I loved this dish! I would cut back on the salt a little but other than that it was perfect. The vinaigrette is so tasty! http://megan-deliciousdishings.blogspot.com/2009/04/grilled-steak-and-peppers-vinaigrette.html

Excellent recipe, even though I cut it down to a smaller size. All the flavors go together beautifully. The leeks are oh so good. Not as fussy as it looks at first scanning.
