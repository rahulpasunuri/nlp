It made me cross-eyed, it was so good.

Like the first reviewer said, I would use two tablespoons of rosemary - dried is okay, I've found. Also, I notice the sauce is better when you let it cook longer - I guess it allows the flavors to mellow. Overall, I like it but would definitely let it cook long enough or it's a little strong and lemony.

Believe it or not. I was so stupid to have followed this recipe and added 2 cups of fresh rosemary from my garden. It was a disaster and an embarassement for my family. Obviously, the taste was so overwhelming that we couldn't eat it. If I ever repeat this recipe, I'd cut the rosemary by at least 2/3 and the lemon by half.

Well, sure, I guess if a recipe doesn't quite suit your sense of what's right, you could assume a typo. But I look to Epicurious for creative and original ideas - and sometimes new ideas don't seem 'right' until I've tried them. Assume typos and you miss out on a lot of new and exciting recipes. That said, I would like to point out that this particular recipe was part of a cookbook review and the reviewer commented on the unlikelihood of having 2 cups - yes, cups - of rosemary at hand. The reviewer, by the way, loved the recipe, 2 cups of rosemary and all.

I gave this a 1 rating because as-is, really isn't good at all... My only question is do they have really weak rosemary in France? I used about a cup, and it was so incredibly overwhelming - not to mention the effect it had on my digestive tract. I don't think a body was meant to eat that much rosemary in one sitting. I added sauteed chicken to the dish, and when reheating the leftovers, added cream - which mellowed out the rosemary. I'd make it again with about 1/4 cup of rosemary, and use cream and chicken.

I read once in some cookbook (wish I could remember which one) that too much rosemary in a dish can make it taste soapy. I never knew what that meant until now. For this recipe, I only had around one cup of rosemary at hand, but even that was just too much. It was overpowering. Maybe, for my taste anyway, around 1/3 to 1/2 cup of chopped rosemary would have been better.
