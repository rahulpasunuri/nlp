Excellent recipe. Could use a little more seasoning and less oil, but EXCELLENT! ADD GOAT CHEESE as suggested and serve with crusty bread. Fast and delicious.

As written I give it three stars. It was really good, but I felt it could use a little something, so I added some goat cheese crumbles and drizzled a balsamic reduction over it all. I also sprinkled on some extra fresh chopped mint as recommended by another reviewer. That kicked it to a four star recipe. We will adding this into our dinner rotation.

This recipe was delicious! As suggested by other reviewers, we added some onion. We weren't a huge fan of the radicchio, but that is just personal taste. Everything was delicious and so healthy! I didn't taste any mint after the veggies were cooked..I might consider putting some on the veggies after they're done cooking before serving. Yum!

great way to make tofu. I added some hickory wood chips to the fire and that adds a nice smokey taste!

This was very tasty and is presented in an impressive way, however, I made one change to the recipe to give it a little more flavour, and my husband said that the change "made it." I added garlic/herb boursin cheese to a few layers. If this was in the recipe, I would have rated it 4 forks!

My children liked this recipe, to my surprise. I adored the mint. It really gives it a punch. Looking forward to making this again!

very good option for when you want to grill, but don't want meat. some of the vegetables turned out much better than the others (the radicchio and zucchini were standouts). the tofu lacked a bit of flavor though, and stuck to the grill. next time maybe i'll marinate the tofu longer or with something more flavorful. overall, this is a great basic recipe though, and certainly something i would cook again.

this was awesome. I only had eggplant and shiitakes mushrooms for veggies, and used extra-firm tofu. I served it with fresh corn on the cob smeared with basil butter. my initial thoughts, after reading the recipe and reviews, was that I would by underwhelmed. what a pleasant surprise! the textures were amazing. I used my grill like I would for a thick piece of pork or chicken: high heat until grill-marked and browned, then moved to lower heat until done through. I used a longer marinading time (added some lemon juice), especially for the tofu. It came out charred on the outside, firm and meaty on the inside. eggplant was tender and smoky without being soggy. the real star was the shiitakes! perfect sharp bite against the bitter-smoke of the eggplant, and it lended flavor to the tofu. Marinate longer and use high heat and you will be pleasantly surprised by this.

This was my first attempt at tofu too. Initially, not a big fan. At least of this recipe. Too much oil, not enough taste.

This was my first attempt at cooking tofu, and it was quite good. Gives me courage to do more! I skipped the raddichio and threw in tomatoes.

I'm adding this to "My Delicious Diet" recipes. If light and healthy always tasted like this, we'd all be fit and trim. Yum!

This recipe embodies summer. I used the round zuchini and patty-pan squashes, both slized to resemble the slices of portabello. The flavors, especially when you chomp on a piece of mint are extraordinary. I served it crusty french bread to sop up the juices. Amazing.

Taste good, but too much oil.

Rating: 2
definitely easy, and a good meal, for sure - just not all THAT exciting. I felt like the flavor came more from the yummy veggies (we opted for just portobellas and red pepper) rather than the tofu really soaking up the flavor. Maybe we'll try marinating longer, but then I'm afraid it will come apart more easily? Also didn't get a nice crisp crust on the tofu like you do when pan-frying or sauteing... But simple, healthy, and good enough that I'll make again.

one of my favorite dishes and i am not even a vegetarian. i put a little basil in this as well as some feta cheese to sprinkle on top.

Oh yes. I forgot to mention that I added some toasted pine nuts to the stack. They add just the right texture and flavor.

This recipe is unbelievably simple and delicious. I was looking forward to it because it reminded me of a penne, eggplant, mint, parmesan, and pine nuts dish from Bon Appetit from the early 90s that I just love. Since I now eat more tofu and less pasta (!), I tried this the day I got my magazine. I too skipped the radicchio. Simple balsamic marinade, but it flavors the tofu and eggplant beautifully. For the cook who had trouble grilling the tofu, you should try extra- firm tofu and/or a grill plate.

I had several people over for dinner, and made this for the sole vegetarian. It was fast, easy, and *looked* amazing. All of the meat eaters were disappointed that they were getting chicken instead...

Rating: 4
Wow, I am a big meat eater but this meal was probably the best vegan meal I have ever had. Easy, quick, filling, and flavorful. I used less (1/2) oil and also used a tomatoe instead of raddichio. I counted calories and it was under 300 calories per serving, but I was full!

easy and quick veggie night meal skip the radicchio and use a grilled tomato instead. and yes grill the tofu it gets nice and crispy just use firm tofu and drain it

This was a tasty and easy vegetarian dinner that we both really enjoyed. I am not a big fan of eggplant so I skipped that part and we couldn't find radicchio's at the market, but with or without it was a great dish. I also used smaller Portabello mushroom (used two per person) as I think they are more tender than the big ones. I served it with a super easy corn salad with shredded spinach and some feta. I dressed it with the leftover marinade. Perfect!

To Lecross: Whether something looks "unappealing" or otherwise is completely subjective. If you find the picture unappetizing, it would be in your best interest to refrain from writing a review. I, for one, find the photo delectable and enjoy the concept very much.

Oh come on Bon Appetit! This looks so unappealing I wouldn't even consider making it.

Pretty basic but good. I am not sure if you should grill tofu however, it breaks apart pretty easily and does not heat easily on a grill. But the end results were yummy. Lots of leftover marinade which you can drizzle on more after you are done cooking. I left out the raddichio because it looked wilted in the store. Also I would cut the eggplant thinner than what they suggest, it takes the longest to cook compared to the other veggies. I would cut it in thin 1" to 2" rings.

teh marinade makes much more than is needed... you can halve teh marinade recipe and still be ok.

Rating: 4
AWESOME!!! Love the combination of flavors. To make this a little heartier, I put everything between toasted rye bread. Left out the mint, because i had none. Added some roasted tomatoes that I had left over in teh fridge. Will DEFINTELY make this again. The balsamic garlic combo is fabulous.

I used the recipe for the base. I didn't make the stack but served the veggies and tofu individually. It was great and I liked the subtle marinade.
