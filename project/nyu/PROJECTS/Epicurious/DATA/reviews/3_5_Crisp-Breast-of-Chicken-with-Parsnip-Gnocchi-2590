Excellent dish. A new family favorite. Being able to distinguish the pecan flavor over everything else is not important.

This is now a family favorite. i cut the chicken breast halves in half lengthwise to keep the chicken moist. The blend of flavors is great--doen't really matter if you can pick out the flavor of the pecans. Serve with gnocchi, mashed potatoes, buttered noodles.

Wonderful!! We're officially on a low-sodium diet, so made a few modifications, like fake salt for breading and low sodium chicken broth in the sauce. Served with a baked potato and fresh steamed green beans. Delicious and nutritious! Will add to my list of things to make again!

While the chicken was moist the mess was not worth it. I did not do the gnocchi so I cannot comment on that. I felt the flour/pecan ratio was way out of whack (too much flour). I agree with prior a cook who said no one could identify the pecans.

I made this last night and the whole family loved it. It was easy and maybe not too gourmet but helped our cure of boring chicken breast meals. I didn't change much and would make it again as is.

I was searching for a quick bonelesss chicken breast recipe, something approximating "fried" for my kids, and found this. I discovered too late I had no nutmeg, and no shallots. I substituted minced onion and served it with mashed potatoes instead of parsnips. It was great anyway! Really delicious. I served it with the sauce for the grownups and the kids gobbled it down plain. Even my tired and distracted husband said, "Delicious!"

i won't rate the recipe as a whole cause i didn't make the sauce. but if you are looking for a pecan flavoured recipe, this isn't it. my family couldn't identify the secret ingredient, they just thought it was tasty "fried" chicken.

A new favorite! We really liked this... great way to make chicken breast.. would be a good coating for pork as well! I did not make the ghocchi.. the chicken really was delicious.. I agree with the prior reviewer - the brandy sauce makes it!!! Will make again & again!

I rated this with 3 forks because although it was delicious, it isn't something that I would pick to prepare if I was cooking to "really" impress. The herb and nut coating provided a flavorful and wonderfully crunchy crust. The brandy sauce was the perfect accompaniment. The gnocchi was great and required very little effort. Conveniently made earlier in the day.

a new way to cook chicken boobs...bread the chicken and pop in fridge for an hour or so, breading stays in place better. also had noodles, buttered with parsley. that and a green salad made a great supper

Delicious, easy to prepare...be careful because the pecans will burn when you are frying. The sauce is wonderful. Our company loved it!

Served with buttered noodles instead of gnocchi. Delicious! Easy to make and our guests loved it. I'm going to try the same breading and sauce with pork.
