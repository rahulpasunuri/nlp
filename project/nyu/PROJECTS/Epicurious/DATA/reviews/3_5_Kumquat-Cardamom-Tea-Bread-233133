I adore this recipe, and make it whenever kumquat season rolls around. There's always too much icing, but that's not a huge problem. Always gets rave reviews!

I wanted to like this recipe, really I did! We love unique flavor combos, but this one just didn't quite work.

This recipe took a bit of time because you had to cut and seed the kumquats, but it was worth it. Very easy to make. I took the others' advice about cutting the amount of powedered sugar for the glaze in half and it turned out just right. I sliced a couple of kumquats for the top, and a couple of days later, one slice was turning moldy (it was on a covered cake stand). The rest was fine though and the flavours really complimented each other. We ate one loaf and froze the other. I recommend this recipe!

I wanted to try this recipe to see if it was good enough to serve at my friend's bridal shower tea luncheon. It was a huge hit with my family and co-workers and I will definitely make it for the bridal shower. However, I'm going to try it in a bundt cake next time; the glaze frosting makes it more of a cake-type dessert. Also, I only used about 2 cups of powdered sugar for the glaze because I had read that it was too sweet with the 3 cups. It turned out perfect.

I made this as a gift for neighbors and friends for Easter. It was very pretty (turned out just like the picture). Everyone enjoyed very much. It was an easy recipe to make as well. I thought that the icing was sweet, but we liked it and thought it was a good contrast to the bread itself. We will definitely make again.

I thought this bread was very good.I only made half the amount of frosting and found it to be the perfect amount to frost both loaves.

I gave it two forks but said I would make it again because I'm not a very experience baker, so I think it came out a little dry because of me. I will try it again and see how it comes out and add to my review, it is definetely worth trying out, excellent flavor, just a little dry.
