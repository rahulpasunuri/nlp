I thought the batter was dry and needed milk or another egg to make it creamier. I also think all the carrots absorbed some of the liquids and would use less carrots next time.

This is pretty good, I halved the recipe and made them as muffins for Easter brunch. Everyone enjoyed them from 18 months to adults who "don't like carrot cake." That being said, I have had moister more delicious kinds.
