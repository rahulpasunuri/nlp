We've tried many rib roast recipes, some very basic, others quite time-consuming. None are as good as this recipe. It is bang-on for roasting method, timing, and the herb-rub is the perfect compliment for good beef. A reliable meat thermometer is key.

I only had a 3.78 lb. rib roast so it cooked faster. We took it out after 1 hour 20 minutes and it was at 130 degrees already. It ended up being medium, which was perfect for this household. I didn't have a rack to put it on in the pan so I diced 4 potatoes into quarters and used them as a bed to elevate the roast. I wish I had cut more because they were wonderful! It was the most scrumpious dinner.

I'm pregnant and I was craving prime rib, so after reading all of the reviews, I bought a huge roast without the bones from Costco and set to work. I also doubled the marinade and cut pockets for the garlic. I made the horseradish potatoes au gratin (fabulous!!) and a horseradish sauce from a salmon recipe on this website. Amazing!! Quite possibly the best meal of my life! We devoured most of it between four people and I ate the leftovers off the chopping block before they could make it to the fridge. Now it's my husband who is having cravings and is constantly begging for this dish.

As usual, epicurious (and reviewers!) comes through. I had never made a rib roast before, and this was dynamite. Absolutely perfectly seasoned. I used dried bay leaves and sea salt as substitutions. I had a 7-pound roast, and added 50% more of the rub, and let it marinate for 24 hours. When it came time to carve, the bones fell right off, as the roast was so tender. Two of my guests had seconds, and I had cut very thick slices to begin with! I skipped the jus and made a garlic horseradish cream. Definitely a win.

This was the first Prime Rib roast I ever made and it was fabulous. I did double the marinade because we had about a 10 lb roast but I think I would double it for a smaller one as well because it has such good flavor. We have a convection oven and we roasted it to an internal temp of about 130 and it was medium rare through out. Ths is a keeper!

this is my go-to rib roast recipe. super simple and just divine. i've also cut pockets into the meat and stuffed a few extra garlic cloves a couple times -- adds lots of garlicky flavor deep inside the roast. delicious.

Rating: 4
excellent! However, I don't feel that 8 hrs is not enough, the longer the better. The longer it sits the more the herbs permeate the meat, I left mine in for 72 hours and there was no need to add salt or pepper it was marvelous and even more tender than is normal. I also pulled it out and let it set during this lengthy time period. Having worked in the grocery business have found that most pieces of meat when aged are much more tender than fresh cut.

I usually use a different recipe that requires roasted garlic but decided to use this one because it had fewer ingredients and fewer steps. I will go back to my old recipe. The roasted garlic took longer but was easier than using a mortar and pestle. The 110 internal temperature was more rare than medium rare, I would change the internal temperature to 115. The jus was missing something - I like mine with a bit of red wine.

This was amazing. I had a big 10 lb. six-rib roast and followed the directions carefully as far as the rub. I skipped the jus (just too good all by itself). Never having done one of these before, I did a little research on how to best cook one. I heated the oven to nearly 500 degrees and let the meat sear for awhile. Then I slow cooked it at 220 degrees for several hours. It cut like butter and tasted better. Get the best beef you can find (mine was prime, which you can't always get). I'm doing another one for a Memorial Day cook out. Paired with some nice red wine, can't wait!

Highly recommended. All my years cooking as a personal chef, this is my first prime rib roast. This recipe is wonderful, delicious and EASY. I marinated for 24 hours, and used the mortar and pestle to make my paste. I finished each slice of meat with Brittney Grey sea salt, as the rub is not overly salty. Whenever I roast anything, I always put a quartered onion in the bottom of the roasting pan. This way, when it comes time to make your jus or gravy, you have a caramelized onion to add flavor, texture and depth. It's something my mother always did, and I have continued to always roast meat in this manner. I will continue to make this for Xmas dinner; my husband and son thought it was heavenly. My roast was a regular grocery store $3.59 a pound holiday special. It was 5.66# and I used the entire recipe for the rub. I took off the ties and put some of the rub in the flap above the bone and retied it before roasting. I am pleased with removing so much fat before rubbing and cooking. It yielded plenty despite the meager layer left on the meat.

This was amazing! Made it for our Christmas eve feast- it was thoroughly enjoyed by all. Had a 12 lb'er- didn't have time to let it sit an hour before going in the oven. So I gave it half hour at 500 degrees, then used the thermometer to adjust the oven temp between 150-300 degrees, monitoring the temp rise based on what time we wanted to eat. Worked out perfectly. Made with the creamy hoarseradish sauce and skipped the jus at the end- yum!

Fantastic, Easy, Do-Ahead Meal. I made this for Thanksgiving and we're doing it again for Christmas, but with a much larger audience. If you have a meat thermometer, set it to go off for medium rare (it's higher than the recipe calls for, but we had beautiful pink roast all the way through after the 20-minute rest period). Served with Potato Gratin with Gruyere and Creme Fraiche (B.A. Nov. 02). Awesome!

I always do prime rib for Christmas. This year I tried this recipie and it was AMAZING to say the least. I ordered a "small-end" roast, which is usually a bit leaner. I marinated this overnight with the rub/seasoning mix. My inlaws don't care for prime rib (unbelievable but true) and they devoured this with accolades. Oh, I cooked this just a bit longer until the internal temperature was 120. Can't hardly wait until next Christmas!

I doubled this recipe for my 6- rib, 14lb Christmas roast. I dry-aged the roast for 48hrs in my fridge, then marinated it the overnight. I didn't use these cooking directions, but followed the one from my best recipe book (200deg @30min/lb, let it rest for 30 mins and then blast at 500deg for 10 mins to brown). Although the low cooking heat took a while, the resulting roast was worth it - a perfect medium rare and gobbled up by the 9 people who came to dinner! because so little juice escaped during the slow and low cooking, i skipped the jus and served with the horseradish cream and creamed spinach deluxe recipes (also on this site). this recipe will be a repeater every Christmas from now on!

This was delicious!! I was a bit timid on making this dish, since I've never actually made a prime rib-roast before. But it came out beautifully & I was throughly impressed. I followed the recipe as stated, but chopped everything finely instead of using a mortar-n-pestle. Don't have one of those & wasn't really wanting to purchase one. Personally, I think the roast came out just as well without the marinade having to be paste-like quality. I marinaded the roast for over 24hrs, mine was ~2-4lbs with 1-rib. Yes, it was smaller than what the recipe called for. But then I wasn't feeding an army. When I make this again, I shall have a roast b/w 2-3 ribs & watch more intently the cooking of it. This time, it was a bit overdone. Probably should have watched it a bit more, though it didn't matter much cause the only pieces left were attached the bone & that was delicious as well. YUM!! The only thing I question is the cooking at 450 F for 20min. During that time period, it smelled as if the roast was burning. I suppose if your oven is immaculately clean then cooking anything at 450 F wouldn't matter much. But for me, I have better things to do then to slave about cleaning my oven after each time I use it. It smelled as though the oven was burning the tar off the metal, rather than searing the roast. I think next time, I'll sear the roast on the stove-top before baking in the oven. Otherwise, very delicious!!

Have made this recipe twice. The second time I had no fresh herbs and replaced them with Herbs de Provence that were put in the spice mill. Too lazy to mince garlic so used roasted garlic, which I had on hand. Also doubled the salt, 11lb roast. The second time was far better than the first.

I made this roast for the first time yesterday. The fragrance from the herbs filled my house. Wonderful! It was an easy recipe and very flavorful, HOWEVER, I found the marinade to be TOO SALTY. If you aren't much for pepper, you might want to adjust that, too. I followed the recommendation of others and doubled the marinade and it was just right for a roast much smaller than indicated in the recipe. Something not mentioned in the recipe is whether to cook it with the ribs up or down. I cooked mine rib side down and it came out moist and juicy. I will definitely make it again, but will adjust the salt, use a small food processor instead of mortar and pestle to mix herbs, and marinate overnight. This is a perfect roast if you want to impress guests!

Came out excellent. Not sure why some people are cooking until the inside temp is 125F. We found that 110F is about right; you do have to let it sit half an hour after cooking so the internal temp goes to 125F-130F. Tripled the rub as some suggested (but didn't triple the pepper or salt). Had a nice crust. The herbs didn't penetrate deep enough though (crust area tasted great though), so I'll probably try putting slivers of garlic into the roast next time.

This dish was good except I thought the pepper taste overpowered the thyme and rosemary. I threw in potatoes, carrots and celery into the pot with the beef and they too were too peppery, and i love lots of pepper, i will use less next time.

Ok, didn't have time for the 8+ hours of marinade. Also, didn't have the fresh herbs & only had California Bay leaves ! Sounds like a great start for this recipe eh? From the many recipes I have cooked from Epicurious I know you can vary some. So I put all the spices in the grinder, including the dry Rosemary & Thyme. (No fresh remember) Used an extra tablespoon or two of Olive oil to make a paste. (the extra dry spices soaked up the first tblsp of oil) Spread the paste on a room tempature roast, let it rest for an hour then followed the rest of the direction. WOW - WOW - WOW Don't know how the original could be any better.

I had a 16.5 lb prime rib roast to cook for Christmas. This recipe is excellent. I basically trippled the recipe and went for it. I did not use bay leaves, salt, or thyme. I used fresh basil and a quantity of olive oil to form the paste. I also placed slices of garlic, 4 per rib section as another chef commented about. The big decision was how long to cook the roast being it was 16.5 lbs. Since it was cylindrical in nature, I was of the opinion that the weight did not make a difference. A roast is the same cicular size regardless of the weight. Therefore, the 110 deg provided for a medium rare roast throughout, with the ends and exterior one inch being medium well. It was very juicy and provided a very exciting dinner.

I made this beef just as the recipe states. I did cook it about 20 minutes longer than it states and it came out perfect! I roasted potatoes in the same seasonings and it was a wonderful Christmas dinner. Will definately make again!

I'll never get prime rib at a resturant again. This was the best I have ever had! However I did some variations. First I didn't use a grinder, all though I used an ice cream scoop and a glass bowl for a morter and pestle. My mixture was still coarse. I rubbed this mixture as directed on the roast, and retied the ribs back on. I then went to another Epicurious Recipe called "beef roasted in salt crust", (Gourmet 1991). I followed the recipe except I added 3 or 4 tablespoons of Hickory smoked salt to the mixture. From there I placed the roast in a roasting pan on a rack with the cover turned so that the moisture could evaporate as it maranated in the refrigerator, for about 12 hours. It could have been longer, I don't think it would matter. I then followed the Herbed recipe cooking directions. This combination has no equil. I might try this on steaks, and venison. Tonight I making the Epicurious recipe " french onion soup" (Bon Appetit April 1993). This recipe also has no equil.

I tripled the recipe for a 6.5 pound beef tenderloin, marinated it for 24 hours, and grilled it on a gas grill. Turned it over on each side ~10 min to get a nice crust, and removed it from the grill after the internal temp. read 125 F. My guests RAVED about it, and my partner, who rarely eats meat, loved it. I will serve it again with prime rib.

One of our families favorites! I make this a couple times a year. I cure the meat in a semi open container in the fridge on a wire rack for at least 2 days to concentrate the meats juices. I make garlic mashed potatoes and a fresh vegetable, garlic bread and a salad - Horseradish sauce is a must! This is a very adaptable recipe and the herbs can be varied to suit what you have on hand. Use a good meat thermometer so you don't overcook it.

While I am generally not the lone dissenting opinion, this recipe wasn't as good as I had hoped. We make prime rib a couple of times a year; very good meat and simple preparation - salt, pepper, some olive oil and slivers of fresh garlic pushed into the meat in a lot of spots. It is always delicious. Although this recipe too yielded a good prime rib, I don't think it was better than the prior description. We also marintated it for 24 hours (was that too long?). It was more work and, at the end of the day, may have taken away from the taste. The sauce did not add much, as compared to fresh white horseradish. So, although good I don't think I'll be embarking on this journey once again.

A wonderful dish for a family dinner. Easy to make, and delicious! An eight-pound roast was more than enough for 10 people. The cooking time needs to be a bit longer, about 20 minutes. I skipped the step of trimming the roast of fat; it came from the butcher already tied. Next time I'll ask for it to be trimmed first. I'd never made prime rib before -- afraid of the carving. But it was easy (if unorthodox) to cut the meat away from the bones en masse, then slice the boneless meat and serve individual bones for "gnawers".

Great recipe. Made this for five kids and one adult - they all raved and asked for seconds and thirds. I would definitely make again, but this time I would leave the rosemary and thyme out when making the au jus and just use the drippings (rosemary was a bit strong).

Dead easy - especially if you eschew the mortar and pestle and just use a food processor. I can't think it makes any particular difference. The flavor was great and the roasting instructions are spot on. I will definately use this recipe again.

This is by far THE BEST rib roast recipe I have ever come across! Very simple too ! I liked it so much I've made it 5 times since I found it and have passed it on to many friends ! It's a keeper !

Everyone raved about this recipe. Made a 13# rib roast and adjusted time to fit. 450 degrees for 20 min then 325 degrees for about 2 hrs 40 mins. Next time would do 330 - 335 degrees. It was a wonderful Christmas dinner. Will make a pot of veg soup with bones. Kathy

Excellent. Easy. I cooked to 125 degrees for medium as suggested in other review, however, cooked a little to much for me. Will definetely make again.

I made the recipe exactly as written for Christmas dinner except I let the paste sit on the roast for 24 hours -- everyone raved! My brother-in-law said he's never had a better prime rib. Served with Old Fashioned Scalloped Potatoes and Green Beans with Roasted Onions, both recipes on Epicurious.

First time I've been moved to submit a review...delicious. Had my gourmet cook friends for Christmas dinner yesterday and they raved about it. Rub was good, but I'm most impressed with the fool-proof cooking instructions. We're not big carnivores, so I was afraid of ruining a piece of beef that I had to get a second on my home to purchase. It was perfect for all of us who were still turkied-out from Thanksgiving!

This is absolutely fabulous! I made it for 2 Christmas dinners last year and everyone LOVED it - both times. My husband actually went on line this year, found the recipe and printed it (just in case I lost the recipe)! Will make it again this year, and the next, and the next . . .

I have made this several times- I vary the recipe to suit what I have around but it is always good. This time I used melted butter, worstishire & oregano along with the oil in the rub and omited the thyme since I didn't have any fresh - I then coated the roast with some dried bread crumbs and poured about a cup of red wine under the roast to begin with - In other words, it is a great base recipe and can be adapted for your own taste!!! It is always great and even a novice could pull this off! I serve this with roasted asparagus, mashed potatoes, a salad & garlic bread.. A real show stopper!

I made this for Christmas dinner, 2001. I let the rub stand on the roast for over 24 hours. Guests compared it to Lawrey's Prime Rib restaurant's prime rib. For those of your who know....that's a huge compliment to the recipe.

This was simply great and quite easy. I added a horseradish sauce which went over better than the jus. I am now copying the recipe for the 6th person (that wasn't at the dinner), but heard about it.

What a fabulous main course for a dinner party! My guests thought I slaved away all day, but in reality, it was not at all labor intensive and allowed me to chat. I did increase the amount of garlic and herbs in the marinade by about half and I would do the same again. It was fragrant and delicious.

My boyfriend and I love this dish. This is the first time he raved about my prime ribs. He complemented it 3 times during dinner and he's a picky eater. I will definitely make this again with more guest next time. Remember, a way to a man's heart is through his stomach ;)

Absolutely fabulous! Recipe works perfectly. Everyone loved it, raved about it. Not a bite left. Everyone wanted the recipe. Marinated it for 24 hours and the flavour was superlative. Definately my favorite recipe for prime rib.

By far some of the best prime rib I have ever tasted. Just as good as Lawry's in Chicago and so impressive when you do it at home. This was the first time I made this roast and it worked out perfectly just following the recipe. My retreiver digs the bones, too!!

I got this recipe from my Aunt and it's one of the best anyone can ever find. If you are planning to have some friends over for dinner some night, this is the meal you would want to cook. I've passed this recipe on to all of my friends and they all love it. Try it out. I would make it again and again and again and again...best if you marinate the meat for 24 hours

Thanks to the many readers for their tips about temperature and, especially to Kristi of Seattle for the suggestions for dry aging and marinating for 48 hours, which I did. The amazing thing was that my rib roast was far from prime (local beef that I referred to as "racing cow")and, until I saw this recipe, destined to become stew. Except for having to cut away some gristle, the meat was extremely tender and most flavorful. Can't wait to try this with a real prime rib roast. Whoever came up with this marinade deserves a medal.

I made this recipe for Easter 2002 and it was not only fast and easy but mouth-watering delicious. By following the directions exactly as written the roast was a perfect medium-rare on the outer portion and rare in the center. Perfect!

This recipe is delicious but also very easy!

This roast is fan-tab-ulous. The garlic mashed potatoes are an excellent accompanyment. For vegies we did some green beans and red pepper in a balsamic vinagrette. Wine: Cabernet Sauvingnon. What ever you do, don't let the succulent juices that accumulate in the roasting pan go to waste. MAKE THE AU JUS!

I think that this is the best roast beef that I have ever had. Very very tasty!

This was great, the taste was out of this world. I cooked it until the internal temp. was 125 and then let it rest for 40 min. We like it medium and it turned out wonderful. My husband has requested it several times which is a first for prime rib.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous!! It is so easy but yet it can "wow" company. We had it for Christmas dinner and I think my in-laws commented at least 10 times about how great dinner was. I used a rolled rib roast and it took less time to bake than I thought. It went really well with roasted garlic mashed potatoes.

This recipe was great-definitly a keeper. I took the meat out of the oven at 115 degrees internal temp and it was perfect.Also used a boneless prime rib and I think it cooked a lot faster than expected

Loved it! I've made it twice already, the second time with a full rib roast, always to rave reviews. Both times I put the rub on the evening before roasting and let it marinade overnight. I too haven't bothered with the au jus sauce. A really great (and easy) recipe.

This was absolutely the best !Everyone raved. Follow the suggestions in the reviews regarding cooking times for med. well. My butcher recommended 1/2 hour per pound which was too long.I thought I ruined it. It still came out great, resting for 2 hours.

The 'au jus' sauce was superfluous -- Although I thought the roast perfect just plain, some guests used a little horseradish sauce.

Made this yesterday for New Year's Eve dinner. Followed the directions to the tee and it came out absolutely fabulous!!! Very tasty.

Rating: 4
A fantastic recipe, made it for New Years Eve party and it was a huge hit, everyone loved it. I agree with the other review regarding the temp. I took the roast out when it reached 120 (instead of 110) and while it rested it reached 130. Perfect for medium rare, wouldn't have wanted it any rarer. GREAT recipe and VERY EASY.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a good, not great recipe. The info on the temperature of the meat is plain WRONG. If you remove the meat when the internal temp is 110 the beef will be way too rare. If you like it very rare remove the meat when it reaches 120 degrees.

Ok, I admit- I lost my mind and decided to make a new dish (and my first roast!) for my in-laws on Christmas Day. Wow!! the flavors were wonderful! Only snafu was TWO meat thermometers that did not work properly- (a caveat for cooking in someone else's kitchen!) It came out on the rare side, but this problem was easily solved. My husband enjoyed it so much, he has promised me a new meat thermometer for New Year's! I made gravy and au jus. YUM!

This was great... It was our Christmas day dinner and everyone loved it (even my very picky side of the family). I had a gorgeous 10 lb. roast and I let it marinate for about 48 hours. I would also recommend dry aging (rinse & dry roast and keep in fridge, loosely covered in foil) for at least 1-2 days. This greatly helped the texture. It was so tender it fell off the bone. Served this with Roasted Balsamic Red Onions (off this site), mashed potato's, green salad, crusty bread and gravy.

After trying a number of standing rib roast recipies I must say that this is by far the best! We have just finished Christmas dinner where I served this and it was just to die for. I had a 14 lb. roast and I tripled the ingredients for the rub and marinated it for two days due to time problems(working, cooking X-mas eve, eve dinner, making stollen and getting X-mas eve dinner ready all at the same time) When it was served the looks of awe I got from everyone at the table were something every cook dreams of. I wasn't about to tell them how easy it was. When you are playing with a $70.00 piece of meat, you don't want just O.K. results. This recipie knocked our socks off. I didn't get to try the sauce cause my wife uses the drippings for Yorkshire pudding but I can't believe it could be anything but fabulous

Rating: 3
Actually the rosemary as I expected was not the best move. I've been a chef for over forty years and found this to be very near my own. Omit rosemary and turn the oven down to no more than 325, I personally prefer 300 degrees...slower IS better. Just marvelous. Thanks for the fun.

Rating: 3
The prime rib came out very well...herb crust is great. I have yet to let it marinate for the correct amount of time, but even so, get a good roast every time (made it 3x now). I am still wondering what benefit a slower roast temperature might bring; I have heard of top chophouses roasting at 225 to 250 degrees.

I made this last night for a birthday party, and it was easy and delicious. I used a 14 lbs. boneless roast and cooked it until the center temp of 120. It was a total cooking time of 2 and a half hours. There were medium rare pieces in the middle to medium well pieces on the end. The sauce is a must due. I forgot horseradish. However, I had the great sauce so no one missed the horseradish. I can't wait to make it again.

This was a fabulous recipe. I made a nine pound boneless rib roast on an outdoor grill rotisserie. The taste and presentation was outstanding.

Okay- I love Prime rib but I do not want it bloody so I roasted it until the thermometer read 120º - then let it rest for about 40 minutes. I served it with horseradish sauce We don't really bother with the Au jus sauce --- Garlic mashed potatoes and southern style green beans. I also had some honey corn bread that I made at the last minute. This was very good, made the house smell like heaven and it was a hit. My husband is spoiled already but now he thinks we NEED this at least once a month.

Decided *not* to go traditional with a turkey this year for Thanksgiving, and found this rib roast recipe that sounded good - and was it ever! I got a 5.5 lb. hotel rib roast, and used the same amount of herbs and spices for the rub...it ended up to be too peppery for my mother, but the roast came out wonderfully - very tender. Will definitely make this again - and will use the easy rub on steak and other beef roasts.

The roast was excellent and everyone raved. For au jus I added 2 cups of Shiraz and the remains of the vegtables I served with the roast (carrots, potatoes, asparagus, brussel sprouts and mushrooms), cooked it down and strained it. Then added the drippings. It was excellent.

Very easy and tasty prime rib. The au jus was simple but tasted better than most other recipes I have tried. Even the leftovers were delicious. My husband and I just wrapped the leftover prime rib in foil and tossed into the oven at a low temperature (around 250) for an hour or hour-and-a-half. It tasted just as good as the night we served it. I would definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
Really good and easy. Have your butcher cut the ribs and re-tie the meat - makes it much easier to serve the bones to those who want it. The butcher also suggested letting the meat come to room together (2 - 3 hours not 1). Then the cooking time will be perfect as suggested in the recipe. Guests raved. However, I will use low-salt broth next time for the au jus.

Fantastic and easy. Did the roast on a rotiserie on the grill 2 hours was perfect med. rare. no need to prepare the au jus had plenty just from cutting the roast ..yum!

This was a very simple recipe, but not a simple taste. My children, who are not big meat eaters, loved it. It is a perfect dish for a dinner party, because it is so liitle work. I cooked it a little longer and it was perfect for my family

I have made this several times for company. Always a crowd pleaser. People think I'm amazing and it's so incredibly easy. I find we like how it tastes just as much if I haven't marinated it at all. Be sure to bring it to room temp. before cooking.

I made this dish for Christmas Eve and it was very tastey and delicious. Marinating it the night before gave me time to enjoy the holiday with my family. I did have to cook it longer than the recipe indicated and it delayed dinner a little longer than I planned but the wait was worth it. Made Sandwiches with the leftovers with grilled peppers, mushrooms and onion and provolone cheese, quick easy and tasted great

Can't wait to make this again!! However, I will cook the roast longer as it was too rare even for us cannibals. I didn't marinate overnight, due to lack of planning, but the flavor was still fantastic. And I thickened the au jus for gravy on mashed potatoes. My husband's birthday dinner was a big success.

Thanks for the idea about letting the roast cook to 125 instead of 110! I've prepared prime rib roast before, but not using olive oil. This recipe worked out nicely. mmm mmm good

Absolutely the best prime rib I've ever had! I'd never been much of a fan of prime rib but this recipe has changed my mind. The only difficulty in making this was that the aroma started about 10 minutes into cooking and we still had hours to go! I had the butcher cut the bone from the roast, then tie it back on. Made it much easier to slice thin when serving. Can't wait for the next time I can make this!

Very Good! Needed to cook longer, well worth it!

A little nervous because this was my first prime rib. What I did, after I rubbed the paste on the roast I tightly wrapped it in plastic wrap and refrigerated it for 24 hours. Pat (Miami Lakes) thanks for the idea of adding the cumin and worcestershire - it really did add great flavor and the smell while roasting was wonderful. I also used Jennifer's advise (Boston) and kept it in the oven until 125 which was perfecto! A new tradition for New Year Eve dinner.

This was a big hit on Christmas Day! It was so tender that most of our guests didn't even need the jus. We cooked it a lot longer than the recipe required... until our instant-read thermometer read 125 degrees. Then it continued to cook on the counter for the next 25 minutes before carving to the perfect temperature- approximately 140 degrees. I'm very glad that we let it cook longer. Taking it out at 110 degrees (as the recipe says) would have resulted in an extremely rare roast.

I used this recipe for a 14 lb. 7 rib crown roast. I doubled the recipe for the herbed paste, added a little more olive oil, about a tablespoon of worcestershire, and about a teaspoon of cumin, and let it marinate overnight. Using the crown roast, I put the paste on the cut portions of the roast. My only concern was how long to roast, as I didn't want it to be overdone. As it turned out I undercooked it and it was rare, but mostly everyone wanted it that way, and it was sooooo tender. For the one person who wanted their's cooked more, we put their portion back in the oven. It was really delicious!

We made this recipe for Christmas this year. It was delicious and easy to prepare! I mixed all the merinade the night before and rubbed it all over the roast and let it marinate over night. Ours was a little over 8 pounds, so we cooked it a bit longer and it was perfect! Not too rare, but not well, either. The aroma of this roast in the oven was so wonderful and everyone loved it! It will become our new traditional Christmas dinner.

A perfect Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it. We added a little cornstarch to the au jus to thicken it up a bit, and a dash of Worstechire sauce. Also, serve with horseradish sauce. It is perfect with the potatoes and sauteed celery & fennel, as suggested in the December 2000 issue of Gourmet magazine.
