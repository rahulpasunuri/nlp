Very good. Didn't need to heat the nori. Definitely hold yourself back on the rice, I ended up with too much.

Oh My!! My first attempt at sushi and it's better than anything I've ever had in any restaurant. I followed the recipe pretty closely, just subbed imitation crabmeat...I know, I know; Blame it on the budget. It was still phenomenal. Many thanks to the reviewer who suggested the mayo/garlic chili sauce combo; really enhanced the flavor. Dipping the fingers lightly in the leftover vinegar mixture made it much easier to spread the rice out and a sushi mat made rolling it a breeze. Love it!!!!

Nori is Japanese seafood "sheets" which you use to roll the sushi. If I recall correctly, roll shiny side out. Rice is sticky so water helps on the finger tips but not too much. You will be impressed by your own sushi!

Just a question...what's nori?

Totally awesome dish. I use kokuha sushi rice (medium grain) and imitation crab meat as well as Trader Joe's guacamole (instead of avocado). It came out fantastic!

I made this dish exactly as stated. You really must remember that a little filling goes a long way. I had a very sharp knife, but it didn't slice as easy as my sharp serrated knife did.

This recipe is excellent. I love to make sushi and had been looking for the right California Roll recipe for a long time. Many people thought the rice was too sticky and unmanageable (as stated in the ratings above) but the stickier the better. The correct way to handle sticky rice is to have a bowl of water handy, dipping your fingers in it before handling the rice, and repeat as needed, when the rice begins to stick. A wonderful recipe that I would definitely make again. Great for parties and entertaining!

First time to make sushi. Had a little difficulty rolling it up. Wrapped it in some plastic wrap to help, but still was not tight enough. But it tuned out fine & tasted great. Used the sushi rice & brought it to a boil very slowly, as another reviewer suggested, so it didn't burn. Used imitation crab. Added some thin slices of carrot & waterchestnut. My husband was so impressed & thought it actually came from the grocery store. Nope! Was fun trying this recipe out.

I had gotten a recipe a few yrs back from foodnetwork...that I need to look for again, since I had some trouble handling this rice. Very sticky, and was missing something in flavor. I went to the Oriental grocery, and was told that it was sushi rice, but it said medium grain on the package. Maybe that was it!(the stickiness)I think it also needed more salt and sugar. I took some immitation crabmeat and mixed it with a mayonaisse/chili sauce/hot sauce mixture, added some julienne carrots, cucumber and avocado. I made 2 batches of rice, and the 2nd time I let it cool a few minutes before covering it with a towel. Was somewhat dryer this way. My husband said that it was better than in the restaurant and a whole lot cheaper too.

My husband and I enjoyed these -- the result of my first effort to make sushi! I omitted the cucumber because I just don't like it, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I used real sushi rice and it was just perfect - not one bit burned and it was lovely and sticky. One tip (though those who are not novices certainly know this already): give the rolls a few minutes to sit so you'll be able to slice them. I was impatient and was unable to cut the nori as everything just fell apart! Still tasted great, but presentation means something, too!

Regarding the tip to get sushi rice, you can just cook the rice with more water and longer to get it to be sticky enough to hold together...try adding tuna sliced thin to the outside, just freeze fresh tuna steak then defrost it (same priniple as cooking just in reverse, and make sure the tuna is fresh fresh fresh when you get it), also try green onions inside and/or advacado

Making sushi at home is a lot easier than it seems. Altough, my rice burnt to the bottom of the pot the first time I made it. But I quickly got the hang of it. (Let bring to boil at a lower heat) A very easy and delicious recipe, to be tried by any sushi lover.

The sesame seeds from another reviewer was a good idea, but after toasting them I thought they looked nice enough to sprinkle over the top of the rolls (instead of on the inside). Turned out great. And don't forget the Wasabi--a little goes a long way!

I make this all the time and it is always an impressive appetizer for a dinner party. When I make it I add toasted sesame seeds. I toast the sesame seeds and then crush them to bring out the smell and flavor and then sprinkle a little bit across the rice before adding the crab, avocado and cucumber. It adds a little something more.

Just another note to this classic recipe...If you want to save a few $$$ you can also easily substitute artificial crab-meat, which also imparts a little more "sweetness" to the rolls, also, pop the extra $$$ you save on a bag of sushi rice (from your local specialty shop or Asian market) and the rice will have the right adhesion to work perfectly everytime! Carrot slivers are also a colorful addition, and give a little crunch....Lastly, a smear of water on the end of the seaweed will help seal the roll, and 1/2 hour or more in the 'fridge prior to slicing will help avoid tearing of the roll.

I enjoyed it!!! great blend of flavors in a mouth full!!! The combination of the crabmeat and avocado is out of this world!!!!

Excellent....fill generously! Much easier with a bamboo roller. No need to heat the nori.

This is definitely worth making again, but I felt the method directions were not explicit enough. For one thing, should the nori be wrapped before being heated in the oven? I tried one sheet of nori laid on a baking pan and heated at the temperature and for the time prescribed, but it dried out and cracked. For the remaining sheets, I used them straight from the package and found them pliable enough. I also question the amount of water for the rice. I think it depends on the brand and age of the rice. I used almost 2 cups of water and the rice still seemed a little drier than I would have liked. I would suggest using the package directions for cooking the brand of rice you're using. All in all though, this is one of the easiest sushi roll recipes I've come across. Wasabi and pickled ginger are a must of course.

I never thought I would make sushi at home. Me and my husband used to spend a lot of money eating sushi in restaurants, and now we don't have to do it anymore. Great recipe. Also made sushi with eel and avocado, delicious. Enjoy

My husband wasn't thrilled to find out I was making sushi for dinner, but he absolutely loved this! I found "sushi rice vinegar" at the Asian market, so it wasn't necessary to add the sugar, salt or sherry to the rice. I'm anxious to do this again and get creative with it. Sushi is something that I never, ever thought I would attempt at home.

Great recipe! I love California Rolls with a passion, while my husband prefers the more traditional sushi fillings. After the initial fussing with rice and veggie cutting this is an easy and impressive appetizer. Even people who hate sushi, love this one. The Wasabi is essential, much too bland with even a tiny dab.

Wonderful recipe. The most time consuming part is the rice and slicing the veggies. Very easy to make and I agree with another reviewer:Wasabi is a must with this dish! Can't wait to make it again.

When I first tasted this dish I wasn't sure how to feel about it, I wasn't quite sure I liked it. It was a different taste. A year later I craved the taste of the California Roll. I had always gone to a fine restaurant to buy them, until I decided to go at it alone and now I cannot stop making them.....enough said. Joy

Great for parties! We had everyone roll one to share - lots of fun & excellent tasting. We tried adding roasted red peppers, salmon and tuna for different combinations - turned out great!

Simple and delicious. I have made this several times and adapted it to create other fillings such as smoked salmon and scallion with cilantro. Make sure the rice is good and soft and that you do not overfill the nori - a light layer of rice is sufficient. A great beginner's sushi - I recommend using a bamboo roller for a nice, tight roll.

a fun recipe to make, not as time consuming as it at first seems. Cannot wait to make for special get togethers.Wasabi and pickled ginger a must have(check specialty markets)
