This is a nice way to add a hint of something to a plain veggie. Good but not completely outstanding.

Fantastic, I couldn't find Broccolini so I just used a regular broccoli head instead. Worked just fine, great taste boiling the broccoli for a few minutes, the smell of the oil is very reminiscent of Carraba's bread oil. Will definitely make this again. So Tasty!!

Skipped the broccolini, made the Italian Herb oil and used it as a bread dipping sauce. Excellent flavor!

Excellent! Just one change; no oregano. (What a horrible herb, which none of my Italian friends - - the ones who live in Italia - - never, ever use!) The broccolini is also delicious the next day, from the 'fridge.

I thought this was great - have made it twice and both times it was well received. The flavor is good, it's easy and the sauce can be made ahead and used at the last minute. I didn't give it 4 forks because I just have trouble giving a vegetable 4 forks - holdover from childhood maybe. Would absolutely make again.

Just OK. Not sure why the recipe calls for boiling the broccolini -- I usually steam them, and wish I had after tasting these, as they were mushy and soft (even after reducing cooking time by a minute or two). Definitely use smaller garlic cloves, as the taste of raw garlic is a little overpowering.
