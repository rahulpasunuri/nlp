I like this recipe, because it is fast, simple, and seemingly healthy. I do not think 1 lb of spaghetti is correct. According to a 1 lb. box of spaghetti there are 8 servings. So you need to cut the amount of spaghetti in half. Also, you don't need that much water to cook spaghetti, just eye ball it. Also, I do not know what lemon basil or garlic chives are. I just used basil. Very important: only use half the amount of pasta called for.

A nice light summer recipe using farmer's market ingredients. I will use a lot more tomatoes, chives and basil next time. Parmesan adds a nice kick too.

I've made this twice now - once following the recipe, and the second time using lots more basil. It may be only July, but my lemon basil is crazy big, so need to use it in something. I liked it a lot better with more basil - the first time was pretty bland despite the fresh tomato taste.
