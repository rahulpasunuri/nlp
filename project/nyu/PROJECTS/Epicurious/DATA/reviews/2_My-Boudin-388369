An hour and 45 minutes was way too long on the meat. There was no texture left at all. Granted, no two boudins are identical, but I missed the thyme and bay that most recipes include. I expect Louisiana food to light up my mouth with both heat and flavor. This boudin lacked both. My favorite boudin I stumbled upon at the St. Gabriel Grocery in St.Gabriel, Louisiana during Hurricane Katrina.
