I disagree with anyone who found something wrong with this recipe! Although I did put the orange peel in the cream and milk mixture instead of using orange zest. The texture was silky and delicious! I didn't find that either the chocolate or the grand marnier were over powering, I used the bakers special dark chocolate and I will most definetly use this recipe again.

It was alright, but I think adding the chocolate is a little bit of overkill to the entire dish. For me, the chocolate made the dish a little more richer than I would prefer. I found it great to take the creme brulee out of the mold (I know, it's like a sin to do so), make the sugar crust on top, and then drizzle the dish with freshly melted chocolate. It does wonders to accentuate the orange flavor and add the right amount of chocolate to the dish. I think a little less Grand Marnier would do better. Also, like others on here, sifting out the orange zest would do wonders to keep the silky texture. Also, to enhance the orange flavor while not ruining the texture, just squeeze the orange to get as much juice as you can into the cream mixture.

I made this as a special Valentines dessert for my husband (who really enjoyed caramelizing the sugar, or "FIRE!" as he yelled while doing it). It was super easy and came out delicious, with a beautiful texture and I loved the balance of flavor. I didn't notice anything weird with the orange zest being detectable in the custard. I will definitely make this again and think it will impress anybody. Someone else commented you could barely taste the chocolate. I thought ours was quite chocolatey but perhaps it depends on the kind of chocolate used (I used Scharffenberger bittersweet)? I was also thinking that you could use chocolate milk to make it richer.

I have made this recipe multiple times and haven't served it to a guest that didn't love it. I think the chocolate orange combination is my favorite kind of creme brulee and I absolutely love it. Try it now.

My first try at creme brulee and it turned out quite well. I (like some of the other raters) did not mix the orange zest in with the custard. I did however substitute non-fat milk, and it turned out great. I'll make it again.

My creme brulee did not set. It tasted okay, but was pretty goopy.

Great, silky texture and crispy top made with brown sugar and my favourite new kitchen toy, a blowtorch. However, there are many better recipes for creme brulée in this site. The Grand Marnier was overpowering and the chocolate, barely noticeable. Also, the orange zest should be (as advised by one of the reviewers) just boiled with the milk and cream and then discarded, as it kind of ruins the aforementioned lovely texture.

Yummy yummy. We used cointreau instead of grand marnier because that's what we had and it was great. I also didn't stir the zest into the custard ...just a quirky texture thing for me...so instead I cooked larger pieces of zest with the milk and then strained them out. Turned out terrific.

This was a lovely dessert, light but full of flavour. We served it with a dollop of whipped cream and a rolled, hazelnut-filled biscuit. Our guests loved it!

Absolutely delicious and easy.....I used Trader Joe's bittersweet chocolate. I'm doing it for the third time tomorrow and plan to use my new kitchen toy...the personal blowtorch!
