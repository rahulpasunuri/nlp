I made this once for dessert at Christmas, using apricots and cranberries. The bread pudding part was great, but I felt that the caramel sauce was too sweet but otherwise kinda of bland. And there was way more than was needed. A week later I made the bread pudding as before, but took a different route for the sauce. After straining out the fruit, I put the cooking liquid back on the heat and reduced it down until it was much thicker and darker. (This took a while since it started with more liquid.) Then I dropped in a tablespoon or so of butter and mixed that in, then added a bit of heavy cream to thin it out a bit. I ended up with a nicely-flavored sauce that worked well drizzled over the bread pudding.

I made this last night for Christmas Eve dinner, and did the following: used 8 oz of cherries, no apricots-- added 1/2 t dark rum to the caramel sauce after adding the cream-- used challah bread-- make 1.5 times the amount of custard, and added 1 t vanilla to the custard-- let the bread/custard soak for 30 minutes-- cooking time was the same - 55 minutes-- it was FABULOUS, and all guests loved it!

Idecided to try bread puuding since it's something my hubby loves and I'mnot drawn to. I have to say I am a new convert. Excellent flavors!I gave some to my neighbor and she also raved. Trying it again tonight for guests. I made a few changes. I used white bread on the bottom and then the fruit. I then topped it with croissants. Instead of the suggested caramel sauce I made the salted caramel coulis from the May issue of Bon Appetit. Delicious!

A recipe worth every bit of the effort required to produce it! Everyone loved this dish at Christmas, and I'm making it again already for New Year's Eve. It's not too sweet, has a wonderful light texture, and the caramel sauce was to die for.

I made this a few times for this holiday season and got into a groove making it with pecan/raisin bread, extra cranberries and some golden raisins, and dark chocolate chunks scattered around. I can also tell you that you can sub in splenda for EVERYTHING but the caramel sauce. No one in our circle could tell, and it made the calories just a bit lighter.

I absolutely love this recipe, though I do substitute challah for the white bread. Much better! I also occasionally made my brandy version: I add four tablespoons of brandy and use the brandied caramel sauce (recipe on this site). I top it off with dried cherries soaked in brandy, and a touch of fresh, whipped cream. But I suppose this only works if you like brandy!

Enjoyed this recipe, but myself and guests found that with the caramel sauce the pudding was too sweet. When I make it again, will serve without the caramel sauce. A very rich tasting custard.

This is the fourth time I have made this. I have made some adjustments to the caramel sauce because I think this one is a little bit bland. I use half brown sugar and half white for the sauce, let it boil on low for the full amount of time (it will look darker than normal- don't panic and pull it off early). While it is in the final thickening I add vanilla extract, a tiny bit of cinnamon and 2tbsp butter. This has always gotten rave reviews. It always turns out. I love it.

Served this to my supper club last night and it was a hit! Yum! I cut the sugar and had to cook the caramel sauce for quite a while to thicken it. I sprinkled about two tablespoons of mini chocolate chips on top! Very tasty!

I made this last night for my mom's 75th birthday dinner. It was fabulous--everyone raved! I did increase the fruit to 6 oz. of each, and I cut the time for boiling the water and sugar for the caramel base to about 9 minutes--it browns fast and continues to brown after it is removed from the heat. Have your soaking liquid handy! I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Thanks to the reviews I read, I reduced sugar in half and it was great. I can't imagine if I had used the full amount. It was really good and easy so I'll make it again but next time I'll use more fruit. The carmel sauce didn't come out right so if anyone has a hint on that, I would love to hear it!

This recipe was much too sweet. However, when I used 2/3 of the specified amount of sugar, it became very good.

I have made this recipe for several large thanksgiving dinners and xmas eve parties. It has become a "family standard" and is our most requested desert.

I've made this recipe twice. I really hate bread puddings but this one is different. I really like it. A friend who also dislikes bread pudding really loved this one also. If you find you need to make bread pudding but can't stand the stuff, make this one! Ha!

I have been trying to recreate the bread pudding at The George Washington Inn in Abingdon, VA. After reading most all the bread pudding recipes on Epicurious file (there are 97) I choose this one to basically use. IT WAS WONDERFUL!!! I CUT THE SUGAR IN HALF in the fruit and in half in the sugar, cream & eggs. The change that I made was to continue cooking the sauce on top of the stove until thickened, and then pour it over the challah bread cubes and then bake 45 mn. (I did pour a little warm cream mixture on the bread cubes before thickening) I made the caramel sauce while it baked. Also I added to the fruit a 1/2 cup hot Sherry wine with 1/2 cup sugar to the dried cherries instead of water. EVEN WITHOUT THE CARAMEL SAUCE, IT IS AWESOME!! MY HUSBAND LOVED IT.
