The good news is that this is a absolutely delicious potato salad; the vinegar soaked potatoes coupled with the paprika spiked mayonnaise is a winning combination. I also really liked the texture of the crushed potatoes, it added to the creaminess. The bad news is that my salad had no visual appeal (as I made it). I mixed the parsley with roughly chopped arugula into the crushed potatoes, which just looked a mess. I might try chopping the arugula more finely next time. And putting some parsley on top (as suggested) to disguise any remaining shortcomings, Ingredient notes: a) where do you get shallots so big that you only need to chop up 2 for 1 cups worth? b) The dilled beans were a nice addition, but you could make this salad with dill pickles.
