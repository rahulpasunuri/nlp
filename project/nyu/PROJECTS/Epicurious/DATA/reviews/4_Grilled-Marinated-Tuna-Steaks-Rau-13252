Maybe I marinated this too long, but the tuna turned brown - and even cooked didn't look that appetizing. Next time I would marinate no longer than 20 min and then reduce the leftoever marinade and serve with the tuna.

I have been making this recipe over and over since 1996. Totally delicious. Occasionally, I will add cilantro at the end. Other than than, I can't see how it can be improved!. I also usually cook off the marinating liquid until it is reduced to top it off!

This is our favorite go-to tuna recipe, hands-down. We only change 2 small things: A generous amount of chili-garlic (sriracha) sauce instead of pepper flakes, and doubling the marinating time. Make extra, because tuna salad sandwiches made with the leftovers are soooooo good!

I discovered this recipe a couple of years ago and it is by far by #1 entertaining meal when my husband and I have guests. Everyone we serve it to LOVES it and it's my husband's most favourite meal ever. I serve it with green beans steamed in a soy/ginger broth, sprinkled with sesame seeds and mango salsa with a tonne of cilantro. We include wild rice when we have guests but usually don't bother if it's just the two of us.

Wonderful! Marinated the tuna for one hour. Heated the marinade and served with the meal. Paired with Jasmine Rice, wild mushroom compote, asparagus, and a very good rose' wine. Definitely will do this again.

My boyfriend and I love all kinds of food as long as it's fresh and filled with flavor. Well, this is it when it comes to marinades. We live by the ocean and have fish every night (lucky us) ... picked up two pieces of yellow fin tuna and made the marinade exactly as suggested. It was superb (dare I say that while the fish was on the grill I sipped the marinade a spoonful at a time!)

Made this exactly as written and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again. It's a good one for company, I think.

Really, really nice. It's always good to have these very simple recipes available. Make sure to pair with simple sides.

Followed the recomendation to omit teriyaki and double everything else. I also subed sesame seeds for the oil and some other minor changes. Had lots of family over for tuna steaks on the grill for the first bbq of the season and what a hit! A nice change from the expected wasabi sear.

Rating: 4
followed other reviewers advice and skipped the teriyaki, doubled the other ingredients (which basically included all the teriyaki ingredients anyway) grilled the tuna "black & blue" as another reviewer called it and served our grill-seared delicious tuna with a sauce made from 2% greek yogurt, a bit of wasabi powder and a bit of the marinade (after having reduced it down on the stove). my husband was thrilled and ate 2 large pieces of fish as well as the leftovers on our son's plate. will definitely make this again!

Wonderful marinade. We cooked the leftover marinade for a few minutes and served it over the fish and a side portion of jasmine rice. Think of what this would cost in a fine restaurant.

I halved the teriyaki sauce as recommended and skipped the ginger since I didn't have time to pick any up. It came out excellent-- it probably would be even better with ginger, though. But if you don't like or don't have ginger, don't be afraid to try this without it. You'll like it!

Rating: 4
This is really good. I was out of sesame oil, so I toasted some sesame seeds lightly and then powdered them in the mortar and then added to the mixture. Still got the sesame flavor. I had some left over after putting the tuna in the marinade, and used in on a pork tenderloin. Also excellent.

Rating: 4
This dish is great and soo.. easy. As others have suggested leave out the teriyaki, and make double the marinade for 4 servings. Grill tuna for only 3 min/side on very hot coals. Served with wasabi mashed potatoes, and made a condiment sauce of mayonaise, some of the marinade liquid and wasabi paste to taste. Actaully make a lot of this it's the perfect compliment.

This marinade was a huge hit! My whole family loved it, even my husband, who doesn't normally eat fish. I didn't buy the highest quality tuna, and the marinade really made up for it.

Excellent marinade! I continued to brush on remaining sauce while cooking for maximum flavor. Sprinkled sesame seeds on top in the last few minutes of cooking. Will double to freeze next time!

I omit the teriyaki sauce completely and double the marinade ingredients. I reserve part of it to serve over the tuna and use the rest to spoon over the cooked (barely grilled and served "black & blue") tuna. Rave reviews every time I have made this dish. Goes great with wasabi mashed potatoes.

I thought this worked well, but agree that the sauce is slightly overpowering the tuna. It might stand up better with Beef. I would definitely make it again as is for beef. For Tuna I would cut the teriaki sauce in half, or leave it out altogether.

One of the best marinades I have yet to experience. I add a tiny bit of chopped fresh coriander before grilling. Everyone I've made this for raves about it - including my children, one of whom does not like seafood in general! Works on other fish as well.

This is a great recipe. Make as written and then grill. The flavors are wonderful. Do not marinate to long an hour is plenty. Fresh ginger is a must. I add a touch more than called for. Serve with cous cous or sesame noodles and a salad. Perfect meal. Have made this many times.

AWESOME recipe. Made with fresh swordfish. Forgot to add wine to marinade.

I thought this recipe was dreadful. The sauce was so overpowering it completely obliterated the taste of the tuna. There are much better marinades out there, that enhance the flavor of the tuna, not kill it.

Looked at recipe and thought it was yet another soy-tasting tuna recipe, but it's a lot better. It has a mix of asian flavors and intermingle nicely, and it's easy. For those of you complaining it's salty, try light soy. It's healthier for you too :-)

Rating: 2
If you like teriyaki or are cooking for a crowd, you will like this recipe or at least find it convenient. Unfortunately, those who describe this marinade as salty and overpowering the taste of good (and probably expensive) tuna are correct. Tip: if you are looking for a great tuna recipe, try Prudhomme's "Fresh Fish Two O'Clock Bayou" -- p. 40, "The Prudhomme Family Cookbook" 1987. I have yet to find a better recipe for tuna.

This is really an amazing recipe. I was so excited when I saw it because it is very similar to tuna I have at one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. I simmered the excess marinade on the stove, and it made an amazing sauce for not only the tuna but for veggies. The teriyaki sauce used will make a difference, it has to be one that is for basting and glazing, not the Kikkoman that is like soy sauce.

Boy was this a big hit amongst my friends, who all asked, "What's in the sauce?" I reduced the marinade as others suggested - great tip. I served it with a mixed greens salad with honey mustard dressing.

my husband liked it more than I did...maybe cooking down the marinade was the answer...and yes....seared is the way to go

Rating: 4
I have also made this dish many times and I think it is fabulous. Last night I seared the tuna instead of grilling it, and it was equally delicious. I agree with the cook from Seattle that cooking down the marinade permits its use as a sauce. Also, this is excellent for swordfish.

Rating: 4
I have made this many times and everyone always loves it. I cook down the leftover marinade to use as sauce. I think the kind of teriyaki sauce used is important. I use Very Teriyaki. I always serve this with "Rice with Pine Nuts and Cilantro" which has been best if I follow the recipe exactly.

No forks for you. This marinade was awful. It was way overpowering and raw tasting. It tastes like something you would get in a chain restaurant--a lot of taste but no refinement. I reduced the marinade to make a sauce and that was overpowering. I think the teriyaki sauce puts this recipe out of balance.

This was delicious and simple to make - added bonus. I used three times the ginger called for and a bit more red pepper, and then we boiled the marinade and served it over the grilled steaks. A nice side is grilled asparagus which took to the sauce well also.

Hey, it's not too salty! The marinade has a complex, very Asian flavor. It's slightly sweet and very easy! The recipe calls for marinating fish in advance, but we didn't do that at all- who has time to wait? We reduced the marinade by heating it in a sauce pan over a medium heat for about 5 short minutes, then we spooned it on top of the fish we were broiling and put some on our rice too. We left the swordfish slightly underdone- the fish was not completely white in the center, but partially translucent- and I think this must be the perfect way to eat it. Mmm!

Rating: 3
very tasty and easy. We used swordfish as well as low sodiom soy and teriyaki sauces, with no saltiness problems.

I really loved the marinade for this recipe, but next time I will use chicken instead of fish. I used fresh marlin steaks and, while I liked the flavor of the marinade, it really overpowered the fish. I didn't have fresh ginger, so used 1/2 tsp of ground. Also added a big tsp of garlic chile sauce. Great flavors!

Wonderful marinade! Made extra and used it to saute some baby broccoli...excellent flavor. But way too salty; might try low-salt teriyaki sauce sauce next time. Went heavy on all of the spices but would probably ease up on the ginger.

Very flavorful marinate. Made with swordfish, broiled it in the oven for 4 minutes a side and had excellent results. Can't wait to try it on the grill. Increase the ginger, garlic and scallions by about 1/2 again for more flavor, and definitely boil leftover marinate until it slightly thickens and have on hand at the table to use as a sauce. (Agree it is a little salty, so next time I'll go with the low sodium teryaki and soy. Served with wilted baby spinach sauteed in olive oil, garlic and ginger. Nice complement to this dish.

I loved this tuna dish!!! We didn't have any teriyaki sauce, so instead I combined the rest of the ingredients and added a little brown sugar.

Very simple, quick to prepare, and delicious. I have used this recipe several times, broiling the tuna steaks in each case. Because I found the the marinade a bit too salty when prepared according to the recipe, I now reduce the amount of teriake sauce and increase the wine with great success. I also eliminate the red pepper flakes entirely. Served with rice pilaf and sugar snap peas (or asparagus), this recipe has become a family favorite!

Very moist and flavorful! (Not to mention easy...) Instead of serving the boiled down marinade, I made a pineapple salsa to serve as the "sauce".

I look forward to making it again soon.

Excellent dish, I was a little apprehensive at first to make this recipe, fish can be a little overwhelming I found it very simple and it tasted great; I served the tuna with mixed vegetable & baby potatos on the barbecue and used the remaining sauce over the veggies it turned out just excellent; I did not take the other viewers advice about boiling the remaining sauce and serving it over the tuna, I wanted to keep all the natural flavours. I will however next time replace the brown sugar with honey this recipe is definitely four forks. "Its definitely a keeper will make it again"!

Wow! I was hesitant to make tuna, but I couldn't pass up this recipe. It turned out fantastic!

My fish market did not have tuna on the day I was having guest for dinner, so I bought swordfish and blue marlin. Both were a superb substituion for tuna.

What fabulous flavor this dish offers! I ended up grilling the tuna on the bbq and also broiled the sauce to pour over the steaks - delicious!! I made the mistake of preparing a rather rich risotto for the side; the tuna has so much flavor that it is better served with a plain rice and perhaps steamed asparagus, for example.
