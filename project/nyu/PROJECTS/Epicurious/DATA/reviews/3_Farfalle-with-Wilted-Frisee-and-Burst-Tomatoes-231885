Forgot to mention, I couldn't find frisee so I substituted 1 bunch of dandelion greens and 2 heads of radicchio.

Excellent! Was a bit skeptical because of the other reviews but it turned out great. Could cook the tomatoes less because they basically fell apart, but delicious none the less. The Parmesan finished it off nicely.

Not bad. I agree, don't cook the tomatoes too long; there's lots of cooking after they burst and if you leave them in there too long, they'll overcook. I'd make it again if I had a lot of cherry tomatoes to get rid of (as I did today) and it's quick, easy, and nutritious (I halved the butter and substituted swiss chard for the frisee, by the way).

I made this for a potluck -camping no less and thought it delicious and easy. Pre-cooked the pasta as we were at 6000 ft. and had it in my cooler in a zip lock bag. Used mixed greens of arugula, radiccio and spinach (couldn't find frisee.) Very popular and the leftovers were good cold. I will make it often!

This has become a regular dish in my house. I omitt the frisee but am plentiful with the tomoatoes, lemon and cheese. Half the butter is sufficient.

Was so disappointed! The tomatoes looked like the picture right after they burst, but when I went through then next steps, they became mush. ANd the frisee looked fresh at first, but became stringy looking when heated. Overall flavor was bland, or I could have forgiven the appearance! Blah dish.

I thought this was a very fresh, spring-like pasta dish. I used grape tomatoes, and a spring mix because my market was out of plain frisee. I did not use all the butter at the end (just about 1 Tbls.) and some of the drained pasta water. This lightened the dish quite a bit. The lemon zest adds just the right touch. A 'do-over' dish in my house.
