I used a half cup of almond meal instead of almonds, and added one additional tablespoon of butter. I also put in a teaspoon of genuine almond flavoring. While warm, I pushed back the outer cooked edges for space to cut. I didn't do any cutting till the shortcake had both cooled and been refrigerated. This seemed to solve the crumbliness. They're delicious. Thanks for a good grown up chocolate recipe.

very tasty, very easy. you don't need a food processor, either. i used my blender to grind the nuts with the salt and sugar and then mixed everything together in a bowl and cut in the butter with a pastry knife. if you have no eligible nut-grinding appliances, i'm sure you could do this with already ground almonds. i do it in a springform pan, which makes removal much less sketchy.

I have made this 3 times - no dessert could be easier. Mine never makes a "dough" - I just press the crumbs into the pan and only cut once when it comes out of the oven. Very good!

This recipe has become my favorite ever since I first tried it a few weeks ago.

it crumbles too much but it is tasty. i would favor the apricot orange shortbread bars( dec 2005 bon appetit )instead.

It's an adult tasting chocolate cookie that is good with red wine. Beyond the good taste, I like that it is easy, fast and doesn't dirty many dishes. Also, I used sliced blanched almonds rather than the whole. I don't see the benefit of one over the other, you are chopping them anyway.

I thought they turned out pretty good. Anxious to see if they become better tomorrow like the recipe indicates. I made a one substitution - I used whole almonds (didn't have blanched), which I toasted for 10 minutes. I also baked them in cast iron heart shaped mold pans (6 per pan) so that may have allowed them to "dry" better than in a 9 inch square. Flavor was not "floury" at all - maybe because of the toasted almonds?

This is a simple recipe and tasty (the cinnamon adds a really nice something) except is does taste a lot like eating cocoa and flour mixed together with some nuts thrown in. The recipe does not specify cold or room temp butter. I used cold and I think it does require room temp. The ingredients never formed a "dough". So I dumped it into my pan and just pressed it down really hard. Because it was so dry, it was almost impossible to cut through on the first cut (it just crumbled) but I did it. Baked it for 15 minutes, took it out and pressed it down again. Took about another 15 minutes to be "dry" as indicated in the recipe. I was able to recut and the end result looks pretty good but this recipe either needs more butter or less flour. I would try it again with room temp butter but will wait to here what other epicurians have to say!

it is very easy, and simple ingredients..i like the texture as it reminded me of a type of chinese almond cookie i like...the taste was a bit flour-y, i think i'd add a little more butter and longer baking time...i didn't have unsalted butter, so i used salted and just omitted the salt - i don't bake much so i don't know if doing this affects the product? can anyone enlighten me?

The tast is great, but the dough was to dry. Maybe more butter?
