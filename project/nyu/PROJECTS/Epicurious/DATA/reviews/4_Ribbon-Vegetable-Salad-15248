A mandoline makes short work of this salad. I use the Benriner, a Japanese mandolin... not too expensive, but indispensible.

Substituted shallots for scallions, as that's what I had on hand. Excellent salad; healthy, quick and easy.

It takes forever to grate everythig, but it's a very pretty salad and the dressing is very light. I served it with chicken tandoori and the jasmine lemon/pea rice (both from this site) and out of those three dishes, this was the favorite. The non-cucumber guests even liked it. I probably won't be messing with this on a weekly basis or anything, but it is a nice change from a lettuce salad.
