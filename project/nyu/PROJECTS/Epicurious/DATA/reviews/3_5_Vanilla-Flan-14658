This was delicious and looked beautiful. As others indicated, the caramel hardens very quickly; we warmed the dish that the flan was going in, but the caramel still hardened very quickly. It also took much, much longer to bake than specified. But the taste was great and especially for a dessert that is quite low fat and relatively low cal. I used 1/3 C sugar instead of 1/2 and that seemed to work well re the sweetness issue.

This is a great simple recipe I made with my mom and made a great family dessert. Isadora Osgood age 11

I agree with the others that this was wonderful and so easy to make. It is sweet, but creme caramel or flan are sweet deserts. This is much lighter than traditional which balances out the sweetness.

My son has Celiac Disease so it is hard to find good & easy to make desert for him. He is only 2 and he can already make this cake except for the caramel part. I make this flan at least once a month and for every potluck!

This was a great recipe, as is. The second time I made it, I tinkered with it to make it lower in fat / cholesterol. It was wonderful. My mods included: using just one heavier bottom cake pan instead of a saucepan for the sugar/water as well as a traditional flan baking container, putting the sugar water into it on the stovetop and following the recipe for caramelizing. After, I waited about 2 minutes for it to cool then poured in the egg mixture. This saved time, energy, and sugar! For the milk, I wanted something like evaporated milk, so I used 2/3 cup good quality instant dry milk flakes, mixed with between 1 1/2 and 1 2/3 water. I used about 1/2 tsp almond as well as 1 tbsp vanilla extract. I used 2/3 cup egg beaters and 1 egg. I bended it all together in blender at a low speed to prevent frothing and strained it. My fiance loves authentic flan like mama makes, and loves this!

Very tasty and easy. Mine needed to be baked for longer. I let it go 15 minutes extra and it still came out a little too wet, though it did hold together nicely. Next time I'll bake even longer.

This has become one of my favorite desserts to serve. I have added maple syrup, or berries, or whipped cream or left it alone with a wafer. It still amazes me how versitile and popular it is!

This is a great, easy recipe that my dinner guests swoon over. I bake it for 1 1/2 hours to produce a perfect texture. This has become a dessert staple for our family.

This was so easy, smooth and wonderful - needed to bake it at least 30-40 minutes longer - could be out altitude (Colorado), but after the hour and 15, it was still quite liquid - was perfect and more like jello texture at 2 hours - placed it on a plate of toasted coconut... yumm....

I was dissapointed by how this flan turned out and I followed the recipe exactly. The flan was too sweet. Only my young daughter liked it. I guess I was spoiled growing up in Spain. Once you taste the real thing, this does not compare.

Yum! I can't believe how easy this was. I used 2% milk because that is what I had and did not sieve, the testure and taste is incredible. I love bread puddings, I think this would make an incredible (and easy) custard for a bread pudding. I will make it again and try adding pumpkin and some cinnimon raisin bread.

Great recipe!!!!. I've made it twice for my family and they loved it. A tip.. When making the caramel, you might think that it's never going to turn into a golden colour. Be careful because the caramel turns from clear to caramel color in a second!. It takes about 5-8 minutes to have the caramel turn in a golden colour, once it turns into a golden colour place it in the baking dish right away because caramel burns in seconds.

Wow! Great taste and light, and so easy. Since it was for Valentine's Day dinner, I added some quality cocoa to the recipe, but otherwise followed it to the letter. We're flan fanatics and order it often and this was better than the heavy flan at many restaurants.

So easy and always comes out great! I'm scared to give people the recipe because they will think I am lazy. It's sooooo good!

Loved this recipe! My Aunt who doesn't like custard wanted more.

Nice! I'm a rookie baker and have almost never baked anything. This was a very very simple recipe and quite idiot-proof. Tasted nice--would probably taste much better with berries and cream: just something to make it a bit special; something to keep friends and family from forgetting it too soon. ;-) Will certainly make it again.

Everytime I make this (and I make it often), someone asks me for the recipe. It's so easy, that I'm almost embarrassed to give it to them! Great with fresh berries on the side.

This dessert is amazing! Very easy and delicious (I used 1% milk)...Makes a wonderful presentation. Word of caution, watch caramel carefully...I burned my first batch. Husband and guests gave rave reviews!

AB FAB! Easy, delicious, fool-proof. Whole family loved it. Ditto Kristen from Philly, also greased souffle dish lightly with butter, used 2% milk, less sugar and high quality vanilla. "I am not a custard fan" husband proclaimed it a keeper.

This was great...very simple and tasted like traditional flan. Although the milk is nonfat, the eggs are not and there is quite a bit of sugar in this recipe so I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a "healthy" dessert.

Nice recipe for creme cararmel. This is not a Flan!. Maybe a little too sweet on the caramel, but I would make it again.

I usually ignore nonfat desserts--but this one is great. It tastes very rich and creamy. (Of course even the nonfat version of condensed milk rather "calorie dense!")

Very good low fat version of the original recipe.

I have made this recipe many times for dinner parties and it is always a hit. Delicious and no one suspects it is lo-cal.

I burned the sugar caramel the first time....be careful. Also, I didn't have at fatfree condensed milk and I used regular. I'll make it next time with fatfree. It was really sweet but it tasted like traditional cuban flan.

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo party and it was a hit! Very easy and great when you're looking out for fat calories! One suggestion, heat the dish before you pour the carmel in it. As soon as I did it hardened and I wasn't able to coat the inside of the dish.

Very simple to make yet always well received. This has become a "favorite dessert" with my family. Very rich and creamy texture; a perfect flan recipe.

the texture is not smooth and creamy as expected, it's so thick and too sweet, my daughter doesn't like it, so does the whole family.

Very smooth and creamy yet low fat. I served it with fresh sliced mangos after a large meal and everyone loved it. It was easy to prepare. I will be using this recipe again and again.

Pretty average flan recipe. We prefer flan recipies containing almond.

This is a great, easy recipe. I've made it for several dinner parties, and people are always impressed. It also earns high marks when you take it as a dish when you're invited for dinner -- very impressive and it goes with everything!
