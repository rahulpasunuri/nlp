I love the whole idea of this...I needed something to go with egg noodles that wasn't a white sauce and because I had roasted red peppers in a jar on hand searched it. I also had sun dried tomatoes but dried so here are the changes I made~instead of broth used the water I re-hydrated the tomatoes in (next time I would use more) and doubled the balsamic vinegar. Wonderful!!!

This sauce is extremely versatile and quick/easy to make. I have started making extra and keeping it in the fridge. It's also a great accompaniment to many dishes served cold, as a red pepper relish.
