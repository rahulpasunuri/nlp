I found this sorbet to be very easy and delicious. However I found it too sweet as a cleanser so we had it for dessert without the sauce. I had some amazing ruby red grapefruit, so taste the juice and adjust the sugar according to taste.

I have made this sorbet on several occasions,served as both dessert and palate cleansers. As a palate cleanser it is perfect and not too sweet if served in small portions with just a touch of sauce. As a desert,I have drenched the sorbet in the delicious sweet sauce and have surrounded it in pinapple and grapfruit segments. This is such a light,tangy, and refreshing addition to any meal, both casual and formal.

Fantastic and perfectly refreshing! I made this recipe as written 2 years ago as a palate cleanser between fish and meat courses for our annual New Year's Eve dinner. I can't wait until the the 'best of' New Year's dinner to bring it back!

Great! Easy and impressive. I served it with chocolate wafers. My fifteen-year-old brother declared it "scrumptious".

I made this a day ahead for our New Year's Eve dinner and the results couldn't have been better! I thought it might be too tart for some, but it was just on the VERY tasty side of mild and wonderfully sweet. It is a memorable keeper!

YUM! I tried this inbetween my pasta and main course...and it was just perfect. I used a passionfruit/white grape sparkling drink instead of champagne, and added Grand Marnier to the sauce. I might add that I chilled my serving parfait dishes first , then transfered the frozen sorbet into the dishes and covered with wrap. It was easy to pull out of the freezer and serve on a tray!!

This recipe is a standard at all our dinner parties as a between-courses palate cleanser. My husband has gained his fame with this simple recipe. We don't use the sauce but it is still a standout. Rather than open a full bottle of champagne we just use a split, which is just the right size.
