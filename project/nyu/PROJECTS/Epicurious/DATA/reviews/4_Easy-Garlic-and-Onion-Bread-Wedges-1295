This recipe is great, I switched it up a bit. Instead of just the parmesan cheese, I did half Mozzarella & half parmesan cheese. I cut it into small slices and served it as an appetizer.

Reading all of the positive reviews, I thought this pizza would be better than it was. The taste was a little boring and the mayo makes a very creamy (read: too creamy) sauce. It is too rich to be a side to a meal, if you make it I would try eating it as your main, casual dinner. if you like alfredo, this is kind of what it reminded me of. be careful with the salt, ours turned out too salty.

I will definitely make this again and again, it is fast, simple, and delicious.

I was a little skeptical when I read this recipe, despite the great reviews (and the fact that I really can't imagine using store-bought pizza crust). I wanted something to serve to my young niece and nephew that was fast, easy and kid friendly. It was a hit! Pretty easy to whip together (although I agree that you might not want your guests to see it being made).

This is so fast and delicious - even using dried basil and bottled garlic (horrors!). It's really a pizza though, so pair it with something light like a salad, quiche, or soup for a quick and yummy meal. Even my 4 & 6 year olds liked it.

I made this for Christmas eve dinner as an appetizer. I cut into squares instead of wedges and made two(large crowd). The plate was clean and everyone wanted the recipe!

i agree that you have to use fresh ingredients for this recipe. rave reviews whenever i make this. everyone asks if it homemade foccacia - no one ever guesses it is a boboli.

This is a great appetizer or party food. I have taken it to alot of functions and it always gets gobbled up. Very easy to make. I also like to add some cayenne pepper or chopped fresh chiles (jalepeno) for heat.

to the cheap- asses who try to use low-fat mayo, garlic from a jar, or dried basil, THIS IS THE REASON IT DOESNT TASTE GOOD! you must use FRESH basil, REAL garlic and actual mayo, NOT low fat or miracle whip! come on, people!

I make this pizza all the time- every time someone has a party i am requested to make my pizza bread. It is so simple, and delicious!

From all of the amazing reviews, I suppose I had very high expectations; in reality it was OK, not great. Perhaps I expected something a bit more like garlic bread with a zing, and I thought the mayo might melt?! But it ended up more like a creamy white pizza. Don't get me wrong, it tastes good, but it is too heavy and creamy to serve as a side of bread with a meal, as I had planned. On its own or with a salad might be better.

My BF and I frequent an amazing little Mexican place every weekend. As we are very gracious regulars, we were invited to their Christmas party. I made this recipe for this party and I must gloat about the compliments I recieved on this dish!! Everyone just scarfed it up and sought me out to tell me how much they loved it! The only 'modifications' I made were to substitute the parmesan for a mixture of 1/2 parmesan and 1/2 asisago - both freshly grated, to omit the olive oil (with all that mayonaise, I saw the oil as overkill) and I used the thin crust Boboli as that was all I could find. This recipe is a definite MUST!!!!!!!!

Just like it says - very easy, but very good! My guests ate it up and took the recipe ... highly recommended!

This looked kind of gross when I was making the mixture and the smell was overpowering, but HOT DAMM ITS GOOD!!!!!! Poeple could not get enough. Make sure it is made before the guest arrive, otherwise I am not sure they will eat it. - It is super stinky. It even looks good after being baked. Yumm, I can not wait to make it again.

This was definitely easy to make. I wasn't crazy about it, though. It smelled absolutely wonderful while it was baking, but I was disappointed by the taste. I found the onion to be overpowering. I will likely try making it again, but with less onion.

This is one of my all-time favorites! It's one of the easiest recipes, and it's always the biggest hit! Perfect with a crisp salad and a bowl of pasta. *THE* best!

This was one of the easiest things I have ever made...I am not a cook, I have just started really. But this was super easy and recieved rave reviews and disappeared in a matter of minutes. The mayo through me a little at first, but i came out just great. I did skip the "brushing with olive oil" it didnt need it. I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent. I was a bit concerned at first with the amount of basil it required. Basil can be somewhat overpowering at times, but it was just right. I brought them to a party and all I heard was "I want this recipe!".

It was very easy - I took the other reviewers advice and used the thin Boboli and REAL mayo. Served it at an "appetizer party" and it was a hit.

This was very easy to make. I used Sargento's Angel Hair Salad Creations shredded Parmesan, Mozzarella & Romano cheeses and the thin Boboli instead of the Parmesan and the regular Boboli the recipe cites. It was absolutely delicious. I used a pizza wheel to cut everything up into appetizer sized pieces. I made it a few hours ahead of time for Thanksgiving and it held up really well. Not a heavy dish before such a big meal.

Well there's always one wet blanket in the reviews and this time I'm it. I took this to a dinner party of 8 and this was not finished. I thought the taste was a little odd. I used low-fat mayo; grated parmesan (that I had frozen); fresh basil and jarred minced garlic; and a red onion; and thin Boboli. No one said a word about it. My fiance did not like the parmesan. I think I may try this again but use a parmesan blend freshly grated from a local gourmet market.

I made this recipe for a luncheon at my sister's and it was a big hit!! I doubled the recipe and then cut it into little appetizer size squares. Everyone is asking me for the recipe now. I used the thinner Boboli bread loaves, regular mayo, and fresh basil. It was delicious and sooo easy!! It will one of my staple appetizers now! Defininetly try it!

Could this have been any easier or any more delicious?! My dinner guests loved it. I made the mayo mixture the night before so the flavours really had a chance to intensify. It was a snap to have ready when my guests came. I also had some roasted red peppers in the fridge that I chopped up and added. It gave it a nice colour and a great flavour. It makes me laugh when I think about how much time I've spent fussing with other appetizers. Another idea for these if you need to have little finger appetizers (poppers!) is to make them on english muffins, cut them in quarters, freeze them in the pan and when frozen, stick them in zip lock bags until you need them. I have a similar recipe I do this with and it's great to have them in the freezer for quick & easy entertaining. Enjoy!

This was really good, considering how easy it was to make. I made it for a family get-together and both the kids and adults commented on it.

My nephew turned his nose up as I was mixing everything and then ate 4 pieces when it came out of the oven. It's easy and great!

I made this with Romano cheese and it was excellent. As I always have the other ingredients on hand, I keep a Boboli in the freezer for when I want a quick easy lunch

Great appetizer. I use the thin Boboli and keep an extra one in my freezer to whip this up on the spur of the moment.I've made this many times and always get compliments.
