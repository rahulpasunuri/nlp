Brought this to a Cinco de Mayo-themed party - those who understood the dish loved it and said it was sooo good; everybody thought the use of jicama was so creative. Used crab from snow crab and king crab legs - that seemed to work just fine, but may not need as much salt as in the salsa recipe, so suggest add crab to salsa, taste on the jicama, then salt. I would skip the water in the salsa - somehow there ended up being liquid in the bottom of the serving dish, which made it less attractive and more difficult to serve. But it was still very tasty - yum! Over all, I'd say the recipe was a great success and I'd definitely suggest people try it.

I liked this, and it is especially good with the homemade salsa. I'd slice the jicama a bit thinner next time to make it easier to eat.
