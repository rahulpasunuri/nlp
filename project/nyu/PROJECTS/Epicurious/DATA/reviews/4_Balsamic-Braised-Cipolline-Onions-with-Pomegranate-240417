Although a little hard to brown round objects evenly, the result is great. Hubby even loved them and he's not an onion eater. Served alongside a beef dish,they made a wonderful presentation.

Made this for Thanksgiving two years ago in '08, but forgot about it until my 24 year old daughter requested it this year. She remembered it exactly and now we're making it together. Easy (except for extracting the seeds) and unusual. Dee-lish.

Love this recipe! Had to substitute Craisins for the pomegranate, but it was still great. My dinner guests raved! It's worth the time and can be done ahead of time.

Outstanding! I made this for a dinner party once, and have not stopped getting special requests for it ever since. The sauce is a nice compliment to meat/potatoes or any winter menu. I love the touch of tart/sweet pomegranate seeds, but when they aren't in season I've substituted dried cranberries as recommended. It takes some time to blanch and peel all of the onions, but it is worth it.

Oh my goodness. These are unbelievable. I did not use the pomegranate seeds and instead plan to serve as an appetizer: toothpick it with a small hunk of blue cheese and serve with a Merlot. The thickened syrup ends up so rich with so much depth. What a hit! Unfortunately, my Minnetonka, MN did not carry the peeled onions, but worth the labor.

I've made this twice for thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. It's both beautiful and delicious with the pomegranate seeds. Many asked for the recipe and some said it was the best dish of the night.

AMAZING! Everyone loved this unique dish. I wouldn't change a thing. The pomegranate seeds I found at Trader Joes. This will be a must serve dish for future holidays!

This was delicious! It had great flavor and was a delightful side to a rich meat (I served it with lamb). My only issue was that it wasn't very pretty. It sort of looked as though it was a big bowl of red goop. I'll try it again and maybe cook it down a bit less and see if that helps with the aesthetics.

The onions are delicious, but I wouldn't bother with the pomegranate seeds next time. This dish doesn't present well, even with the pomegranate garnish. My onions looked more brown than deep burgundy--not so appetizing to the eye.

OMG these were wonderful!! What a great dish to add that special pow to a meal. We all loved these, going into the traditions folder.

These were delicious, but we used bigger white boiling onions instead of the cipolline, which I wished we had used. The pomegranates were festive.

Wow, these were excellent. Had with prime rib last night and I plan on having them again for Thanksgiving. I purchased the cipolline onions at Trader Joes already peeled so this recipe is a snap. Yum yum

This dish is exceptional. My son made this for Christmas dinner. Amongst all of the other wonderful dishes on the table this one stood out. We served on a white platter and drizzled the creme fraiche over the onions and topped with the pomegranate seeds. Beautiful. The flavors are rich and wonderful together. We are making again tonight. Everyone wanted more of these.

I've made this twice, once with little boiler onions and once with the cipollines. Both times this dish was outstanding. These onions eclipsed dishes I had worked much harder on for my New Years dinner and got a lot more attention. This is a good do ahead recipe, since the onions take on more of the sweet syrupy balsamic reduction overnight. I didn't change a thing. The pomegranate seeds make it sparkle. Don't skip them, if they're in season.

This has been the "killer recipe" for Thanksgiving, Christmas and a third dinner party we had last week. It is so amazing how good this is!! Every, and I mean every, guest I have prepared it for has not just asked, but demanded the recipe. It's going to become a regular on our Thanksgiving menu. Don't change a thing with the recipe! It's perfect!

Did not have Balsamic vinegar- used Red Wine Vinegar instead and it was super--loved the tanginess, that I don't think you would get with balsamic vingar. Get the pomegranate seeds--they are well worth the effort.

made this with the pomegranates, small boiling onions and whipping cream. It was delicious!! a great side dish for a beef tenderloin. I will definitely make it again

My whole Thanksgiving meal was out of Bon Appetit and this was my favorite dish of the night. Made with whipping cream and pomegranate seeds. Definitely go with the latter, they make for a nicer presentation, but more importantly add a nice texture and a bit of acidity to contract the rich onions. If this recipe sounds good to you, you will not be disappointed!

Very good, richly flavored, deep brown, wonderful for Thanksgiving. I used pomegranate seeds, which add a nice tartness, and made it ahead, as indicated. I thought that the small boilers I used might have been a trifle too oniony-I'd use cipollines next time.

I used Fig Balsamic vinegar and made the onions one day ahead. This was the hit of our thanksgiving dinner. I will definitely make this again next year. Delicious!

Outstanding! Was the hit of Thanksgiving dinner. Paired very well with smoked pork loin. Not a bit of it left at the end of the meal. Made with pomegranate seeds which didn't add much flavor-wise, but made for beautiful presentation. Will definitely make again.

these are wonderful! I made them for thanksdiving and wish I had made two batches. Do not skimp on the basalmic vinegar here, use a high quality one. The Premium Balsalmic from O and Co is a great choice for this recipe.

I would use less creme fraiche next time. These were gobbled up at Thanksgiving dinner.

VERY FESTIVE, EASY TO MAKE; USED POMEGRANATE SEEDS AS TOPPING; USED LEFT OVERS IN A SUPERB SALAD THE NEXT DAY.

Made this for Thanksgiving. It was a little sweeter than I normally like, but I just tend to not like sweet things with dinner. Everyone else, however, really loved it. And this was the first time I'd had cippoline onions - I would definitely make this again, but perhaps leave out the cranberries. I don't think the dish needed them, and perhaps would reduce some of the sweetness. --Janene from theweedpatch.typepad.com

Huge hit for Thanksgiving. Everyone went home with the recipe. I left out the pomegranate seeds and used orange-flavored "Craisins" instead of plain dried cranberries.

Delicious! These were the hit of the Thanksgving Dinner. I have been asked by everyone to share the recipe. My husband even told me "If you want me to eat leftover I have to have those Onions" - Guess I will be making more of these tonight, as well they were the only thing not left over. Trust me you will love this!

An interesting variation on the basic balsamic cipolline ones, with the creme fraiche addition. Definitely tasty but less like the relishy ones I've purchased at my gourmet deli. However, it is worth making as a very nice side, with a tang.

I loved this, and so did all to whom I served it. The recipe works nicely... I found the direction regarding cranberries vs. pomegranate seeds confusing, as they are not used in the same way. I skipped the cran and used the pom (plucked right out of the fruit) and loved it a lot.
