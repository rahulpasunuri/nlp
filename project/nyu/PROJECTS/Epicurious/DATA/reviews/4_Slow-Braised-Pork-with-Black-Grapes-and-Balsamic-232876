Made this for a dinner party and it was delicious. After taking out the pork, I strained all of the liquid, skimmed the fat, then reduced it. Everyone raved about it.

This is a great dish! My sometimes picky eaters loved it. And the next day is almost better. Made it with boneless country ribs and doubled the recipe. Had to break it into two pots (one flatter and one a true dutch oven) it definitely benefitted from the deeper pot, the shallower one cooked dry, so make sure there is enough liquid to get you through the cooking time. Also did not have as much of the fat/skimming issues as described. Served with wide egg noodles and broccoli and some steamed/sauteed kale. Had leftovers and they heat up wonderfully. Great and relatively easy dish for a weekend when you have a couple hours to braise.

I brined pork in the Maple brine found on this website; used red seedless grapes. Pork was so tender! Next time I will combine the Food and Wine pork braised in champagne vinegar recipe and this one using champagne grapes. Definite keeper!

Excellent rich flavours! Definitely will make again. Family loved it, yet it is certainly company worthy. Sauce was plenty and was rich brown in colour, which for some reason I did not expect...Only thing I did differently was cut the pork shoulder into approx 1 1/2 inch chunks so the end result was more stew like, and I did not add the extra sugar. The grapes sweetened the sauce perfectly . My whole grapes cooked down completely into the sauce - no grapes left to be seen, which probably added another layer of flavour to the dish itself. The meat was tender and moist and flavourful. Served this with fresh parsleyed green beans, grilled polenta triangles, then topped it with the braised pork. Delicious!

This was a fabulous recipe! I couldn't find black seedless grapes, and used red seedless grapes instead. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to put the fresh herbs in cheesecloth, so I can retrieve them better after cooking. I served this to a friend who told me he hadn't had anything this good since he left France! I will certainly cook it again.

Agree with other reviewers that it is quite sweet even after halving the sugar. (I used a fav, good quality balsamic that is already sweet.) Thick spaetzle on the side with wilted spinach would be good or mashed yellow potatoes, maybe a salad of bitter greens with blue cheese and grape halves? I also cut up the pork into large, two-bite chunks. Recipe gave lots of sauce. French-like dish = next time will plan ahead and get a bottle of full bodied French red.

Pork being on sale for .99 a pound I had 4 in my freezer, thus the adventure in this recipe. It was amazing. I did not have fresh herbs :( So I used dried. (Culinary Father forgive me for I have sinned) I cut the grapes in half but I ended up straining the juice after I had cooked it so that was pointless. The only departure from the recipe I made was when I took out the pork and strained the juice, I added more broth and balsamic vinegar to it and cooked some potatoes mushrooms and carrots down in it. Before serving I added back the pork and it was delish!!! My husband and company went back again and again for seconds, thirds etc..This went into my recipe box and will deff make it again. I also cooked it in my cast iron dutch oven. I served it over a bed of creamy polenta. With greenbeans as a side dish.

This tasted amazing! I used the ingredients in the proportions described, but there were a few modifications. I didn't realize until after I started that the free Concord grapes I'd been given had seeds, so I spent 45 minutes removing seeds. I didn't have a pot that would go into the oven, so I covered it and simmered on the stove. Also, I neglected to thicken the sauce at the end - it smelled so good that I didn't even bother to read the end of the recipe. The only thing that would stop me from serving this to guests is the slightly purple color the pork turns. Maybe with candlelight!

It was good but too sweet. I used 1 red onion and 1 yellow onion in place of shallots and had red grapes instead of black. I hesitated on adding sugar, but did it anyways, wish I didn't. Also didn't have fresh sage and used oregano instead, however the balsamic really over powered all of the herbs. I served sauce and pork over Rigatoni which was good, but it could of use a bag of lightly wilted spinach to off set the sweetness.

One of the best recipes I've made, and so EASY. I did not cut up the grapes or blend them and they were fantastic! Maybe it was the kind of grape I used, but they held up through the cooking and were nice and juicy (and they didn't look bad either).

very good! Added apples and pears with the grapes. Instead of cooking in the oven, I put it in the crock pot for 4 hours. an hour before serving I added beurre manié to thicken the sauce. lots of rave reviews.

Great recipe. I omitted the sugar and cut the pork in to smaller pieces, which took only 1 1/2 hours to braise. I would definitely make this again!

This was ok and I will make it again. Next time, however, I will use larger herb sprigs. Seems my definition of "large" is not the same as the author's definition.

new dutch oven sponsored by mom and dad: $219 pork butt on sale for cinqo de mayo: $2.99/lb 3 contented family members, bellies full of slow-braised pork with black grapes and balsamic vinegar: priceless i made it as directed...except i used regular chix brith and a tiny tiny bit of olive oil. i'm sure that using a good quality balsamic makes a difference, but if you don't have one on hand, use the sugar to take out any harshness from a less complex and yummy one.

Wow! This was amazing! Made the following slight changes, as some of the other reviewers suggested: used boneless pork chops cut into cubes; DID NOT discard the fat in the pan since it did not render much; cooked it covered for 1 1/2 hours and when I uncovered it, added cut-up carrots and mushrooms and let it cook another 1 1/2 hours. Served over mashed potatoes. It is amazingly flavorful and a wonderful entertaining dish as you can put it in the oven with little effort.

A friend made this for dinner last night, and it was delicious! He did say that he reduced the amount of grapes used by a bit, and he served it over mashed potatoes. I asked for the recipe, as I definitely plan on making this again!

Delish! Made the first time with substitutions -- onions for shallots, 1C raisins for grapes, 1/2C pom molasses for balsamic, no rosemary. Very good. Second time used balsamic, but with the same other substitutions. Both SO good. Served with mashed kabocha squash (baked whole in oven with pork, then scooped out, mashed in pan with some EVOO and broth). Great combination.

The perfect dish dish for a cold & rainy Sunday. Just put it in a pot and into the oven while running errands, watching the game or cleaning the house - in a few hours you have a delicious dish! I always omit the sugar but make the rest of the recipe as written. Fantastic over polenta, and trying it today with spatezle - yum!

This turned out fabulous! To avoid the grapes turning into "insipid orbs" I sliced them all in half. I also cut the pork into about 3" cubes and trimmed the fat. I ended up cooking it for about an hour and a half with the lid on and then another hour and a half (because I had time to kill) with the lid off. Cooking it with the lid off at the end seemed to work really well because everything cooked down beautifully. I didn't have any fresh herbs and I didn't have any rosemary at all - just used dried sage and thyme. I made it for Easter dinner. People were skeptical when I told them what I was making but there wasn't a single person that didn't love it (including my picky 11 yr old).

This is a wonderful dish! The juice is great over mashed potatoes. It is sweet and savory. I've made it many times and served it to dozens of people. Everyone loves it. I must admit that I do not use fresh herbs. I have also added potatoes and carrots when I turned the meat. I definitely recommend this recipe.

I made this dish for a friends birthday and it was different, delicious, easy, and beautiful.

Had high hopes for this as I love meat and fruit together and I have a recipe for pork braised with port and prunes which is outstanding. But the meat wasn't as tender after the alloted time (braised it another hour and it was better) and the grapes didn't "cook down" as described. They became these little insipid orbs that were mushy in your mouth. Maybe if you pureed them into the sauce which was decent and was definitely better the next day. Sorry, but not my favorite.

This was very good. I love just about anything slow-braised. But pork with fruit and balsamic vinegar... yum. A winning combination. I didn't find it too sweet... just right. Served it over whipped potatoes. Next time I may try it with a nice, creamy polenta. Oh, and to top it off, it was incredibly easy. I considered chilling it to make the fat removal easier... but then decided to use my under-appreciated fat seperator pitcher which worked beautifully.

Excellent slow cooked pork dish. Made it for company (reduced the sugar by half) and my guests are still talking about it. Best when cooked ahead and reheated - the flavors really come together.

Very straight forward - I left the recipe with my Dad who is learning to cook. A very nice make-ahead dish - made it 2 days ahead. I used tenderloin which made for a pretty presentation. Young (2yrs) up yo old-ish (70yrs) all approved. Served with creamy mashed potatoes and green peas.

I made this with pork the first time and only used half the sugar. It was still too sweet. The next time I used skinless chicken breasts and no sugar. It was perfect! I removed the meat and herb sprigs used my emersion blender and added 1 1/2 Tbsp Alton Brown's schmaltz mane (which I keep in the freezer as he suggests) to thicken. Rave reviews served over mashed potatoes. Won't go back to pork, the chicken was moister without being fatty and super delish!

I LOVE it!! I've even made the entire meal the day before, put it into fridge overnight, reheated in oven at 325 for 1 hour and served. It may have been better the second day. Great make-ahead meal.

This is really good and really easy to make. I made two small changes to the recipe. I used a boneless pork loin (which I left in one piece) and when I was finishing the sauce I pressed down on the grapes to slightly thicken the sauce and eliminate the black olive appearance that another reviewer (correctly) commented upon. The pork melted in my mouth and the sauce was a splendid complement. So glad this recipe was in the buzz box for awhile .... I had thrown out the October issue without trying it, and never would have it hadn't been for reviewers raves! Thanks epicurious!

I made this with a 5 lb. bone-in pork shoulder. Too late, I found I had only 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar. I grabbed the other nearest bottle, pomegranate molasses, and topped it off, leaving out the sugar. Hey, it's all good! heeded the advice of previous reviewers and strained the pan juices and added cornstarch. I cooked it a total of 2 and 1/2 hrs. It was fork-tender and very, very, very good!

This was good, but not great. I liked the flavor of the sauce, but found the pork itself a little lacking, so I shredded it and served the grape sauce over it, which was a good use of liquid. I found that the meat wasn't meltingly tender, as I had hoped it would be. Perhaps this would come from cooking for longer at a slightly lower temperature?

This recipe is delicious. The grapes looked more like black olives after cooking (somewhat unappealing). Next time I will process the grapes after cooking, which might also help to thicken the sauce.

Try this in the slow cooker. I served with pearl sized couscous cooked with chicken broth and sundried tomatoes-the pearl sized couscous looks like acini de pepe. In fact if you can't find it that pasta is a fine substitute. The sauce would be great on chops, but not as full bodied as it is when reduced along with the pork's own juices.

Sounds like a delicious recipe (shame there's no picture) but I think I'll try making the sauce separately to serve with oven baked pork chops.

This is great. However, I make similar dishes using either blackcurrent or grape jam, or by making a port sauce reduction. It tastes quite similar and is a bit easier!

Fantastic! It made enough for two meals. The first night my husband and I ate it as written. Then I took the leftover sauce, pureed it all with my immersion blender and poured the result over the remaining pork. Two nights later I reheated the whole thing for my kids and they loved it!

The pork was wonderfully tender and delicious. The grapes did not cook down altogether, so I strained all of the sauce, pushing on the solids to get out as much liquid as possible. Then I thickened the remaining sauce with cornstarch. Really delicious.

This recipe is really delicious. If you like a sauerbraten like effect this will work for you. I followed closely the recipe, served it with butternut squash risotto from BA 1995 Oct. Nice combination. Garlic roasted mashed potatoes would work well also.
