I made this for my sister's 50th birthday party. She and everyone else LOVED it! It was VERY easy and the presentation was quite nice as I drizzled a bit of chocolate sauce across the top and onto the plate. It was gone in a matter of minutes!

I am always the dessert provider in group get togethers, many times friends or family making specific requests. Rushed for time one day, I presented this to a family gathering and received raves from everyone. I hated to tell them I had used all pre-made products and spent no time making it. Very simple to make and loved by all.
