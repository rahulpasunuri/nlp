Would love some advice before I make this cake. Can I freeze the cake with the filling until I'm ready to decorate it? Logic tells me I could but I needed to hear from more seasoned bakers. I gave it a three fork rating because I've made this filling several times before and loved it.

For "A cook from Iowa": Yes, you can beat egg whites too long! One way to test for stiffness: gently place a whole egg on the whipped whites; if the egg remains in place--does not sink in-- the whites are stiff enough. You can do this as a check after you lift the beater up to see if the white you lift up stays in a peak. The white will be glossy. Why not try another recipe for genoise? There is a good one, with very clear explanation, in Vol. 1 of Mastering the Art of French Cooking by Julia Child et al.

Like some other responders to this recipe, I suggest a light brushing of sugar syrup (flavorful alcohol added, if desired) on the cake before putting on the filling. (Just google for instructions.) The several French-language recipes I have do so. It does make a difference in the final product. A basic French buche de noel is very pretty and tastes very good, but it's not the exciting dessert some may want it to be.

I thought the cake was ropey and dry. I did like the way it rose but not the texture. Does it have something to do with beating the whites and yolks together? Better off to do them separetly? Can you beat egg whites too long?

I read all the reviews and decided not to use the cake recipe but keep the filling and frosting. The frosting was good. The filling was too sweet and turned very runny as soon as it was under room temprature.

This cake took some work, but I followed the advice of another reviewer and did it in stages: filling one day,cake another day, frosting and assembly the next. The filling appeared lumpy when it cooked on the stove but was silky smooth when blended with the marzipan- it was delicious but I may add less flour next time. The cake was good but stuck a bit to the wax paper even though it was greased - maybe parchment works better. I increase the recipe by 1/3 to accommodate my larger jellyroll pan. I rolled the cake in the powdered sugar-covered towel and stored it in the refrigerator for 1 day. It turned out fine and was easy to reroll once the filling was in place. The ganache was delicious. I used powdered sugar for "snow" after I frosted the cake and set the cocoa-sprinkled mushrooms in place.

I was disappointed with the cake. It separated when mixing and turned into an eggy mess when baked. The filling and chocolate topping were delicious. We had excess chocolate frosting and used it as sundae topping (heated it first). Was divine.

Too much work and not very tasty. Was fun to decorate but that was about it. I had a party and only 2 people ate it, the rest I ended up throwing out. After all that hard work! Hope to find a better recipe someday. The filling was terrible, cake was bland and the frosting was nothing special.

My 17 year old son just made this Buche de Noel for his High School French class. The teacher could not believe he made it himself. To say that it was a hit was an understatement! We did not have a 10X11 pan -- he used a 15X11 and sat with a calculator to increase the ingredients proportionally.

OK, for a laugh, if anyone is feeling intimidated by making this more complicated recipe, seeing someone else's results might be encouraging. You certainly couldn't do worse than the picture in the Wiki-How link below. Enjoy cooking! http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Chocolate-Yule-Log

I've made this recipe for a few years now, and plan on making one again this year. I've never had any problems with dry cake, but I'll be trying the Joy of Cooking Genoise cake with simple syrup this time just to see the difference. The marzipan mushrooms are a great way to involve the entire family. Last year's cake even had a marzipan frog sitting on top. One thing I've done to keep the process sane, is to make this cake over the course of a few days. First I'll make the cake one day, the filling the next. On the third day, I make the frosting. While the frosting cools, I roll the cake with filling, and finally frost the whole thing. Decorating is, well, the icing on the cake so-to-speak, and we'll do that when everyone is around and able to help garnish. I've found that the multi-day method really helps keep this cake manageable.

I also used this recipe last year and it turned out great. My husband said it was better than the bakery! Question: Has anyone had any luck in making and freezing this buche de noel? My mom used to make this for our school teachers (and there were 5 of us kids!) and I'm continuing the tradition with my kids. I'm making the buche for my son's teacher and plan to give it to her on the last day of school. Can she freeze it to save it to serve to her family for Christmas? Any ideas? Thanks!!

This was my first effort making a buche for Christmas. Due to time constraints, I only made the cake portion of the recipe. (I used a pre-made frosting for the filling and outside) I used an 18x12 pan instead of the smaller one listed. I was pleased to see that this recipe makes enough batter to fill it. I also used Pam with flour to spray the pan and parchment- it also worked perfectly. The cake came out flawlessly. Rolling the cake was incredibly easy, and it never cracked anywhere (this was a concern based on other reviews). The flavor of the cake was delicious, and the texture was light and moist. I made meringue mushrooms instead of marzipan ones. For me, the meringue mushrooms are pretty easy to create and look great. Overall, this cake was a huge hit at Christmas this year- no leftovers of this dessert!

This has become my traditional Christmas treat. I'll admit, it's used to be quite a process - a little difficult, but it tastes amazing - always a hit. Not a beginner recipe in my eyes. But the more I make it, the easier it is (obviously) - this year, my sister is demanding I make two - it's that good ;)

tried four other recipes for buche de noel. couldn't make any of the chocolate genois recipes or roulade recipes work. this one worked perfectly the first time and the pastry cream is the best by far. not for the novice baker, but work the effort.

Filling - The custard was outstanding, much better than traditional buttercream, everyone loved it. I never have whole milk in the house (1/2% or 1% only), but I had whipping cream for the frosting, so I just added about 4 teaspoons of whipping cream to 1/2% milk to bring the fat content up to the level of whole milk. This worked out well. Frosting - This spread pretty nicely after sitting at room temp for a couple of hours, but I was somewhat dismayed at how thick and sticky it got when chilled. I took the cake to a friend's house for dinner, and set it on the back porch, and was really surprised at how the texture changed in the few hours it was out on the porch at temps around 38-40F. It made the cake difficult to cut, because the frosting tended to pull away from the cake. The taste was excellent, tho. Cake - I made the genoise cake from Sara's Secrets/Food Network for the second time, and it cracked when I rolled it - for the second time. I baked it for only 10 mins. It doesn't sound like I would have been any happier w/ this recipe, tho - next time I will look for that recipe from Joy of Cooking.

I made the mistake of making the cake part, putting it in the refrigerator for the day, and then making the frosting. Terrible idea. The cake was dry. Also, my frosting was so liquid that there was no chance of being able to add wood like designs with a fork. I would reccomend using much less whipping cream, and making the cake and frosting the day that you intend on serving it.

To Carolyn from Canada, You can make a marzipan-like dough by heating the almond paste with a few tablespoons of marshmallow fluff in the microwave for like 30 seconds. Then kneed it with confectioner's sugar until it is a pliable consistency. If it is too dry, add a little more fluff.

does anyone know_ would I be able to substitute almond paste for the marzipan in the recipe? I would like to make it- Thanks

I made this with a chocolate mousse instead of the filling given, and I also used Emeril's genoise cake - I have made that many times, and knew what to expect, but the end result was divine - and it made a wonderful completion to Christmas dinner. I made the marzipan from scratch with almond paste - which I completely recommend....no one was afraid to eat the marzipan. Just one mushroom for each person to eat with the cake was perfect. I will make this again! YUM!

Caution: my cake was nearly over-cooked after 14.5 minutes. Make sure to check it. Also, make the custard the day before or early in the day, otherwise the logistics of putting everything together are difficult to time. The marzipan custard filling is outstanding, and the frosting (almost pure chocolate) was a big hit, but the cake not being a bit more moist cost this recipe the fourth star. Perhaps I should have tested it for doneness after ten minutes. Definitely good eats.

I made the cake for a Christmas party and everyone loved it. The icing and filling are wonderful, but I used Emeril's chocolate genoise recipe for the cake (foodnetwork.com). I brushed the cake with Amaretto before assembling and it helped keep the cake moist. I have a baking pan shaped like a log, which I bought many years ago. I split the cake into three layers and make a double recipe of the filling.

This will be the fifth year that I make this delicious dessert for Christmas. It is beautiful, too. YUM!

For thoses who's cakes are spongy, or tough. I think it may have something to do with the altitude of were you live. For in a higher al. cheesecake is not as lowered as one that is baked in a lower al. Just a little observation. I could wrong however.

I made a Buche de Noel using this filling and frosting to take to a party. What a hit! I used the chocolate sponge cake recipe from Joy of Cooking, which is very good.My daughters made marzipan mushrooms shaped like wood ears and chanterelles. They were gorgeous and a fun project for teens.

I read the reviews first, and did not make the cake in this recipe (I used a simple jelly roll recipe from the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook). The frosting and filling were amazing. One said the filling was better than sex! The marzipan mushrooms were delicious - I actually had friends make them at my dinner party, since I had run out of time, and I got some naughty shaped items too! I made two of these cakes, and the first one went in 10 minutes...

I made two of these cakes for a large Christmas dinner. They liked the frosting and filling but the cake wasn't soft and moist. Try another cake recipe for this one.

I too was a bit intimidated to make this cake, having never made a jelly roll cake before, but i did a little reading and found that brushing an ameretto syrup(page 1010 in Joy of Cooking) on the cake before the filling made it more tender. Also, instead of makeing mushrooms, I colored a small lump of marzipan red, and one green and made holly and berries, then dusted them with gold powder. The cake got rave reviews at our Christmas party. I'll definately make it again.

Thankfully I read the reviews BEFORE making this! I was able to alleviate the cake disappointment by making a sponge cake (The Joy of Cooking has a tasty, easy recipe) to go with the filling and frosting (which, by the way, were simply delicious!!) Every other Buche de Noel recipe I've researched uses a sponge cake (which is comprised of separated eggs, small amount of flour, confectioner's sugar and no butter). My guests loved the presentation and the dessert itself.

I wish I had seen these reviews before I made this recipe. The cake was simply awful. The frosting and filling were good, but I kept wondering what I had done wrong to make the cake so dry and tough. I think it is just a bad cake recipe.

I loved the frosting and filling. The cake however, was a big disappointment. So I tried it again using the cake recipe from the Letter from France, but keeping the same frosting and filling from this recipe. I had rave reviews. It's a keeper!

I found this cake a slight challange, but my cake was not dry or corse as it appears with others. I did have a bit of a problem with the mushrooms, but other than that, it was a total success and received rave reviews by my dinner guests.

I have to agree that the cake was tough, it did not have a desirable texture. I have never had a problem with replicating a Bon Appetit recipe and I was disheartened when this became my first failure. I have found another recipe that doesn't rely so much on the egg yolks to leaven the cake. Keep the filling just use another cake recipe, preferably one that uses baking poweder and egg whites as the leaveners.

I also found the cake to be pretty tough and dry. But the filling is amazing! I couldn't find a 10x11 pan (maybe a typo?) so I used a 15x10 also. I will definately use the filling again, but another cake recipe. Everyone at Xmas dinner liked it, though.

This makes a lovely presentation! We thought the cake texture was a little course and I tried to carefully fold in the flour, etc. so don't know what happened? The filling is to die for and the marzipan mushrooms easy to make!

I don't know what a 10 x 11 pan is, but I do know this.....I found a recipe that uses only 3 eggs and 3/4 cup flour and requires a 10 x 15 pan. I'd use the 10 x 15 pan for this recipe.

I haven't tried this dish - does it use a 10x11 pan? I can't find one. I'm only familiar with 11x17 and 10x15.
