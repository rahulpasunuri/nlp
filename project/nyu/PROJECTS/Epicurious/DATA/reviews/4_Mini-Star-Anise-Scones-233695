Delicious and unique. Not absolutely mind-blowing which is why the lack of the fourth star, but certainly good nonetheless. After zesting a small lemon, I had 3tsp. of zest and so I used all of it (why waste?). I didn't have a mortar/pestle, or spice/coffee grinder so I took the seed pods and crushed them between two mini nesting prep bowls and it worked like a charm. Getting the seed pods out of the star anise was the most time-consuming part of the process. To make prep easier and quicker, I combined the dry ingredients in my food processor and pulsed a few times to mix. Then, I threw in the butter which I had quickly/roughly cut into small cubes and pulsed a few times and voila, a coarse meal. Finally, I put in the cream mixture and gave it a few last pulses and the dough was perfect. I turned it out onto my floured board and kneaded in the raisins. They came out looking like a twin of the photo and are delicious with some Devonshire cream. One of the tricks to getting the scones to not bake flat is to make sure you start with chilled butter, and work quickly and don't over-handle the dough, to keep the butter as cold as possible by the time it gets to the oven. Also, it goes without saying, but check the expiration dates on your leavening agents. My final comment is that these scones are only *just* slightly sweet. Very subtle, indeed. If you prefer a sweeter scone, I would add a tablespoon (or two) more of sugar to the dough. Overall, these scones were easy, lovely, and I'll be making these again.

I would add a full egg to bind it better.The taste was lovely and plus the smell of the star anise

This recipe worked well for me. I might try some different citrus with the star anise. To Cook from Ottawa, sea salt is traditional in baking, try combining the salt more thoroughly with the other dry ingredients and breaking up clumpy salt if it's humid when you're baking before changing salt. Sea salt performs better than table salt when it's used carefully. If you do switch salts, use a little less table salt than the recipe calls for. As for the spreading, pay special attention to your mixing, that's likely to give better results than just making smaller scones.

These were FANTASTIC. Probably the best scones I ever made.The whipping cream gave them a beautiful, velvety texture. I will definetley make these again!

These scones taste good, but there are definitely 2 changes I will make in the future. 1) I'll use table salt instead of coarse salt because we're biting into giant chunks of salt here and there, when it should be blended right into the dough to give it a balanced taste. 2) I'll use a 1-inch cookie cutter instead of the 2-inch recommended in the recipe. My scones are wide and flat - they look like cookies and nothing like the scones in the picture! I'll review this recipe again after making a batch with the changes.

These were stellar (star anise - get it?)! However, I spent forever grinding the star anise in a very small manual spice grinder, so I went out and bought a coffee grinder and it will be easy next time. I used the rim of a regular glass to cut the scones in circles (I don't have a lot room to store doo-dads) and it worked perfectly. I also used dried orange peel and yellow raisins because that's what I had in the house. My oven's a bit screwy, so they burned on the bottom - next time I will use two cookie pans together - but I ate scone tops for three days straight and fed the burned bottoms to my pet rat. I want to try using buttermilk next time so that I can cut back on the amount of excess fat in my diet.

The directions call for raisins but the ingredient list does not. Can someone tell me the quantity of raisins to use? Thank you.

Really a lovely little scone! I did use buttermilk instead of the heavy cream, just prefer it, and this was an especially tasty treat to share with a hot pot of Darjeeling!
