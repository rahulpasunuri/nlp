This indeed was a great sandwich, Poker Guys really liked it a lot, but heres the rub. Its a sandwich and Good Kielbasa deserves front stage center. This was all about the addc ons. Not a gripe here but have had great Kielbasas without all the fuss.

Wonderful sandwich! Made it with kosher salami, it was weird to slice the long way and grill, but it sure tasted good.
