We made this for a summer family dinner for 12 and we all chopped and helped. We used mango from a jar (I was afraid we wouldn't find any in Door County, WI), and that turned out great and easy! Just prep in advance and tweak the dressing to taste, and it's delicious. Everyone LOVED this tasty summer meal - it's all in one, so no other sides! The rice wine vinegar idea sounds good - will try that next time!

We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, especially the change in taste provided by the mango. I cut the oil in the dressing by half. I agree with some of the reviews that the dressing is missing something, perhaps a bit of pureed mango or something else to increase the tartness. Red peppers would be a great addition to the salsa.

I substituted black beans for the jicama in the salsa to good effect. The second time I made it I added red and yellow diced peppers to the salsa too. Absolutely love the simplicity of this meal --- perfect for a light but filling meal on a hot summer evening!

This was good. Next time I make it I will make the dressing tastier with some extra vinegar or more adobe sauce. It seemed flat to us even though I cut the oil by 1/3. The steak was very tasty and we enjoyed the variety of flavors. Well worth perfecting.

This was wonderful. I will make this again and again. I forgot to look for the special chilis so I improvised with jalapenos and Tapatio hot sauce.

I made the dressing for a green salad and topped it with the salsa in some of the dressing as the recipe states. This recipe was a great blend of textures and flavors. I always think dressings are too oily, so cut back the oil to 2/3 cup, it was perfect for my family. I also served this salad for company and they raved about it. I did not make the steak. I will be making this salad many more times.

This dish was so/so- we didn't throw it out or anything, but I would not make it again. However, the salsa was wonderful! Next time I will make the steak and salsa and wrap in a tortilla with some sour cream.

This is a great recipe, worth every minute of the prep time. Couple of comments: first, the spice paste for the steak is so intense there's no need to let it marinate for a long time. I waited maybe 30 minutes. Second, I added 1/4 cup of rice wine vinegar to the dressing and emulsified it in the blender - gave it a nice sweet tang that balanced the flavors. Highly recommended!

I've made this recipe a few times now and love it. It's such a great summertime recipe. Although there's a lot of chopping, it makes a fine meal so the total time is about the same as putting together 2 or 3 items. It does make extra salsa so I serve corn chips alongside.

Good stuff. The dressing is terrific. The salsa is also excellent. Served on platters to a crowd with great success.

This is an excellent recipe - it was worth all the chopping and dicing. The flavor is terrific and it makes a great summer dish. I made extra corn for my two young boys, so they enjoyed the meat and corn without the lettuce, salsa, etc.

Great salad in taste and appearance. Have made it numerous times with rave reviews. I grill the steak and chill, so everything is ready to assemble when guests arrive.

I didn't think this salad was as good as it should have been for all the time (chopping and dicing) that went into it. The chilies overpowered all the other flavors I like such as lime and cilantro.

I made this recipe using large portabellas instead of steak, and it was wonderful!!! I love the combination of flavors. Will definitely make this often.

Another thought regarding chipotles: when a recipe calls for just a tablespoon or so (like this one and the Honey Ginger Salmon recipe), I substitute a good flavorful chipotle salsa. Seems to work as well and avoids the problem of what to do with the rest of the can.

A hint for left over chipotle chilies: freeze them individually on a cookie tray and then package them well.

This was an awesome recipe; we first served it for ten people as a main course. The salsa makes a lot; we had leftovers t a day later with chips and everyone wanted the recipe! The only problem is, when you open a can of chipotle chiles and use only a small amount, you have to find other recipes to use the chipotles up (try the turkey enchiladas with chipotle - you can find the recipe in Epicurious).
