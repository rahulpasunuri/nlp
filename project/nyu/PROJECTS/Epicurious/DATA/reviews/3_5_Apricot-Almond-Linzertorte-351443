This recipe is good but quite as good as the hazelnut raspberry linzertorte recipe that is printed in the 2004 Gourmet cookbook on pp. 787-788. The proportions on the hazelnut-raspberry linzertorte are better: they yield a crust that is a bit stiffer (i.e. more crumbly and crunchier) and that makes a huge difference.

-can be made with different fruit. Made it with persimmons -in my experience, cooking time was reasonable. -dough was a bit fluffier for a linzertorte than is my personal preference. -directions need to be cleaned up. This is an extremely simple recipe but it sounds more complicated than it is.

I'd give it five forks if I could.

Cooking time was off in this recipe and not worth trying again.

Initially the recipe appeared overwhelming. However, not as complex as expected and delicious results. Definitely a keeper.

We make the whole menu with friends who are planning a trip this spring to the area. It was fantastic.... but a few things to note. Could never find apricots labelled Pacific - assumed thy meant the tart ones which are labelled California apricots. Re the veal dish with peppers - never found the specific pepeers, just used peppers labelled sweet. Re the wines, never found any of them. Used Hunarian dry Tokay, which was great, and used a Hungarian Blaufrankish for the red with the meat. Also, found the veal shanks very expensive - had four people and the meat was $44.00. But having said all that, the meal was delicious.

"Remove bottom of springform pan and invert, then lock on side." That's a confusing little bit of instruction, no? Does anyone know what it means? Is it even possible to lock the side of a springform pan onto the bottom when the bottom is turned upside down? I used my springform pan as usual and the torte came out great. I served with home made cinnamon ice cream.

Beautiful flavours and not as difficult as I had thought. I added some almond meal because I didn't have enough whole almonds. Definitely needs to be served with yogurt or cream. Lasts well, which is lucky because you can only eat a little piece at a time ... so rich and sweet; will cut back on the sugar next time.

Excellent. Served warm (did not allow to cool as recipe suggests) with whipped cream. Lots of compliments received.
