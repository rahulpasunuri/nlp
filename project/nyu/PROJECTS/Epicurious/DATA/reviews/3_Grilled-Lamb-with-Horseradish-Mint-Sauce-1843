Delicious... eventually. 5 minutes each side at medium hot was perfect cook time. May have been able to get away with 5/4 with added rest time. Used about 2T horseradish, 2T mint and approx 1/2 lemon for sauce. Added 1/4 T salt and a bit of sugar. Otherwise bland. Needed to at least double garlic and use stronger mustard.

Hard to understand the previous negative reviews. The sauce is a delight that I would also use with grilled chops. I did use very newly opened horse radish and mint that I picked right before mixing. It is one of those recipes that could not survive even slightly older ingredients.

Ummmmm, I thought this was barely OK. The sauce was good, but I did not like it with the lamb personally. Bland I would say - I have had much better lamb.

Simple and tasty! I did it with my 3 months old boy looking at me! Yes, that fast!!! We loved the results, I just put in more mint, a hole (small) bunch! It was a great succes

I am reviewing the sauce only as I paired it with another lamb recipe. I have been cooking almost exclusively off of this website for 3 years now, but have never registered. My family disliked this sauce so strongly that I registered just to rate it! The mint flavor was almost non-existant. Overall, very bland, waste of expensive ingredients.

The taste comes out really well, but it is particularly appealing because it is so incredibly easy to make.

SIMPLE INEXPENSIVE AND TASTY --- WHAT MORE COULD ONE WANT.
