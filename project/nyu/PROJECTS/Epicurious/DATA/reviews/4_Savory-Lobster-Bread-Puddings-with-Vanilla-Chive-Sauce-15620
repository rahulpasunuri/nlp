Help! Amateur cooking enthusiast here... * If I use seafood stock instead of making my own lobster stock, at what point in the sauce recipe do I begin? At the brandy part? * The ingredients list calls for "canned tomato puree"...can someone confirm for me that they indeed mean puree and not paste? Given it is only 2tsp, I would've expected they meant "paste"? Thanks in advance for your help!!!

labor-intensive but crazy-good. I made the sauce and the custard mixture the night before so all I had to do was bake the pudding the night of the party. so good. so rich. so worth the time and trouble. I'll definitely make this again for some future special occasion.

My third time making this, as an amuse bouche for Thanksgiving this time. It's better in small servings as it's so rich. I always double the lobster when I make it and it is perfection. 20 servings went out and not a scrap left on the plates...Works like a charm and the sauce is the star!

When only memorable, decadent and luscious will do. Recipe works perfectly and the sauce is amazing.

Decadent! This was worth the work...I doubled the Lobster so I could place a whole claw on each pudding...lovely presentation (placed the buttered claw meat on top for the last 10 minutes). The sauce was so rich and flavorful. The pudding texture was also just right. I'll try this with lobster and large lump crab next time.

This recipe is so amazing. It is a lot of work, but worth it. If u love lobster, you will love. I used only tails and this worked fine also.

I made this two years ago for New Year's Eve. My guests called it "orgasmic". I am pulling it out again this year as a first course. Seriously, seriously great.

This recipe was great! However, in the interest of time, I would use a high quality store bought seafood stock and container of fresh lobster meat next time I make it. It would save a tremendous amount of time, without compromising the integrity of the dish.

I couldn't eat this myself, but my guests loved it, very rich. Can easily serve 8 as part of a full menu.

To die for! Served this in small ramekins - small portions better as this is very rich - alongside Chargrilled Beef Tenderloin with Three Herb Chimichurri for an elegant "surf and turf." This recipe is time-consuming but if you prepare some early in the day or day before serving (bake the brioche pieces, cut up mushrooms, make lobster stock)it will not be so overwhelming. I purchased lobster meat already cooked which made for much less mess/hassle - When I ordered the lobster meat I asked them to reserve 3 of the leftover lobster bodies which I used for the stock. I will definitely make this again as a first course starter to an elegant meal!

This was an awful lot of work. But lobster is (relatively) cheap these days -- I got 4 2 lb bugs for $7.99 a pound at the local Chinese supermarket! I was up all night preparing the sauce and dealing with lobsters but it was yummy. I served it as a main course (with champagne, pea shoots sauteed with garlic, and an arugula/shaved fennel salad) and def. would make it again, but as an appetizer. Also, I made it in a casserole dish. Am thinking of doing it for a Valentines Party.

Very rich but elegant. Tip for more substantial broth: once simmered for an hour, ladle into blender and blend all the contents - lobster shells, body, legs, veggies and then strain and proceed. Omitted tomato paste (by default as I was out) and was satisfied that the sauce had sufficient color, body and taste because of the boost it got from nuking the solids in the blender instead of pushing down on them into the sieve. A lot of work but a gem of a dish!

This was a very good dish, however it was so rich that I think it would be better as a first course rather than a main entree. The vanilla was very interesting. It has a strong presence, although without the sweetness that so often accompanies it. This dish was delicious, but a little goes a long way. Next time, I'll serve it as an amuse bouch, as a previous reviewer mentioned.

I agree the sauce is to die for. However I baked the puddings at 350 for 35 minutes then took foil off raised the temp to 400 and cooked another 15 minutes. It was nicely browned on top and easy to unmold. Beautiful dish. Had my guests licking their plates clean.

This was absolutely decadent! I served this as a single spoon amuse bouche for our New Year's Eve 12 course meal. 'Ooohhhss','ahhhhhs' and moans were heard around the table. My favorite comment was "This is as rich as a major league baseball player." :-) It did however take almost 8 hours to prep. I then put it in the fridge for the following day. I baked it in a shallow casserole dish rather than ramekins, and I did not bring it to room temperature prior to baking. It took over 90 minutes to bake. Every bit of work was worth it. We had leftovers the next morning, and ate it for brunch! Yummmmmmm!!!!

This was AWESOME! I made the first time as one of several courses for a dinner party for 10, and made the portions smaller. It was still very rich, but absolutely decadent. I made it again and served it as a main course with a side salad.

Absolute perfection!! Impressive, decadent, delicious and totally worth every once of effort!

Fabulous! Also one of the most complicated and time-consuming dishes around (not to mention the cost)... Good for making a big impression. The only criticism I have is that the puddings look ugly when you take them out of the ramekins. I left them in and we spooned sauce over as needed.

Give this 6 stars. One of the best recipes I've ever made. It's the sauce. Simply amazing. Worth every bit of prep work. Of course, lobsters are my favorite food and I am a fool for bread puddings, so how could this lose? Used 2 real live Canadian lobsters and a whole vanilla bean. Since I was serving 8 and did not have ramekins, made this in my standard bread pudding dish. Brioche is common here so that was no problem. I now have a new "starter for the best dinner ever". served with a white montrachet burgundy that worked very well. oh, the sauce! Worth every bit of fat and cholesterol - it is sacreligious to try to make it "healthier". Please. Some things are good for the soul.

This is a very tastey dish and it makes a lovely presentation cooked and served in the lobster tails. As others have mentioned, I had to substitute Challah and I was surprised to find even that in New Hampshire. It's a fair amount of work (but not difficult) and fairly pricey. I did appreciate the call for only 2 inches of vanilla bean. So many recipes call for a whole one and I find them more expensive than lobster.

wow! made this for a special new years dinner. it was amazing!! used challa bread for the pudding, it was thick and rich tasting.forgot the chives, but DO NOT SKIMP ON THE SAUCE! it really made the dish. question, lobster costs an arm and a leg, do you think this dish would work well with shrimp or some other shellfish? well even if i only get to eat it once a year it is still great!!

Incredible!! Outstanding! I did not start with a whole lobster. I found frozen slipper lobster chunks and sauteed them before the leeks. I used lobster base rather than the lobster shells and it turned perfectly. I will say I always use VSOP brandy and it really adds a nice sweetness. The sauce is to die for! Don't skimp it is well worth every calorie and fat gram.

Outstanding dish, and wonderful presentation. This is a lot of work, but it's exceptional. I cut back on fat by using lowfat milk and 3 whole eggs in the puddings, but stuck with real cream in the sauce. Still turned out silky smooth and delicious. Don't skimp on the sauce -- real cream and real vanilla bean are required! Will make again for a fancy occasion. Give yourself a relaxing two days to prepare this one.

I made this as part of my 6 course Valentine's day extravaganza. I thought it was awful. For all of the preparation I felt that the stuffing lacked flavor not to mention I had to drive all over town looking for brioche. The vanilla chive sauce is excellent though.I made it the night before and left the vanilla bean in to intensify the flavor. I served it with the lobster tails I had prepared.

Agreed this was very rich but a very necessary extravagence when the occassion calls for too much lobster and cream. Using a can of frozen knuckles and claws made the recipe far less effort.

Absolutely o/s but extremely rich. Halve the recipe or double the guests. A lote of work but well worth the effort
