This is my go-to crumble recipe! Quick, easy and tasty. I've done it at least 5 times by now (within 3 mths), and each time it gets better (says my husband). I shaved the frozen butter (thanks to a tip found here) into the flour on my 2nd attempt using my lemon zester as it fits in the mixing bowl and this definitely saved me lots of time and effort, and i had fun too! I do use slightly more flour than the recipe called for, other than that, it's a great recipe. On a side note, i think i might just make a huge batch of crumble (pre-baked) and freeze it for easy access in the future.

A nice, easy crumble recipe. I personally would have enjoyed more of the crumble part to balance out the apples. I used one and a half times the amount of cinnamon and sugar because I thought the original amount wasn't enough to cover the apples. I ended up with a good amount of watery juice at the bottom of my pan, I don't know if my apples had a lot of moisture in them. Though it is not a stunning dessert, all my friends enjoyed eating it and complimented my recipe!

Used 600g frozen blend of berries. Was really delicious and very quick and easy. Served in bowls with whipped cream.

This a good basic crumble recipe, you can build on easily, it turned great for me. But on another note, I dont know what KelleyKPeters problem is, she had to post 77 times! the exact same comment, but strangely she varied her star rating from 2 to 3 stars?! You have to go to pages 7, 8 and 9 to find the real commenters and get past this serial spammer/commenter, gee thanks kelley. I hope epicurious can fix the problem.

Excellent, simple recipe. Made in the food processor. bumped up salt to 3/4 t. and added handful of rolled oats. Substitute nectarines, blueberries and tri-star strawberries instead of apples when in season or plums, apricot peaches and strawberries with 1 T microplaned fresh ginger.

Baking at 450 for 15 minutes and then turning the oven down to 350 takes care of the browning issue. I also substitute light brown sugar in the crumble mixture and butter the dish. I've baked this crumble using mixed frozen berries, frozen peaches and frozen mangoes. I've also used fresh baking apples. This is an excellent recipe.

I used 1 pound bags each of frozen cherries and frozen peaches instead of the apples, defrosting them until they were generally room temperature. I, too, grated the butter into the flour mix. For whatever reason, the crumble never browned, but it was still delicious and very easy.

I thought it was really delicious. Mine turned out great - that being said, I used frozen mixed berries, 3 tb of cornstarch to thicken them up, lemon juice, cinnamon. I also used frozen butter instead and grated it in the flour. For frozen fruit, the cooking time must increase to 1 hour, or until the crumble is hardend and the fruit is bubbly. Will make again.

I have made this recipe 3 times since I found it (the fourth is in the fridge, waiting to be baked for a picnic today). The first time I used only granny smiths, but after that I've used a combination of apples and raspberries, apples and mixed berries, apples and apricots... This recipe is so versatile! Also, I find that I don't have to sweeten the fruit very much or at all, which makes it lighter -- the raspberries, for instance, are allowed to be nice and tangy in contrast with the sweet topping. Try it a la mode.

I made this crumble to bring to a friends house a few nights ago. The crumble had just the right ratio of salt to sweet, and I threw in approx. 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the flour. It did take quite a bit longer to brown to my satisfaction, but was worth the wait! I also used 1/2 Granny Smiths, and 1/2 Bosc Pears. YUMMY! This reheats beautifully. Just be sure to leave it uncovered so the crumble crisps up. The empty baking dish came home with me that night..... always a good sign!

This is one of the best crumble recipes I've found. The first time I made it, I found that the apples were still a little on the cruchy side. The next time, I added a step of sauteing the filling (after mixing all filling ingredients) for about 10-15 minutes. I also found in the end that the topping wasn't browning enough after 40 minutes, so I put it on broil for 7 minutes or so. It's a keeper!

This was a fantastic recipe. I am terrible at following directions when it comes to recipes. I usually read a couple of variation of the same recipe and extrapolate my own. But I followed this one to the letter and it came out perfect. Highly recommended!!!

This recipe is so easy and so tastey. My husband told me tonight (and he loves my apple pies!) that he prefers this Fruit Crumble to my pies - I'm game - its quick & easy & has a wonderful flavour. I made an apple crumble and served it with vanilla ice cream. The flavour was to die for. The recipe didn't state the baking temp. but I ended up cooking it at 400 and then turned it up to 425-450 to get it browned on top. I then reheated it for dinner around 200. You have to try it!!

The topping ended up very gooey. Not too sure what I did wrong. It seemed everyone else raved about it. I may possibly try and make it again and we will see what happens. It tasted good, but the consistency was just wrong!
