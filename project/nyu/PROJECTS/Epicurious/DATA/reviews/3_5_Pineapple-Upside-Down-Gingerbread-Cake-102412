No need for the heavy syrup with the pineapple; pack with juice works just fine AND you have a tasty beverage to swig whilst you measure. Don't be put off by the long list of ingredients, chances are you have most of them on hand. It goes very, very fast. And don't you dare think of this as seasonal! It's good always.

The end product of the cake was very tasty. The first batch of caramel burned so don't use the 6 min. in recipe, watch it closely. The second batch went better and I got it in the oven but baked it the posted time and it was overdone and caramel was burnt AGAIN! I cut off the pineapple/caramel part and burned edges and it was a very tasty ginger cake that I would make again but might forgo the caramel or cook alot shorter time. I bake alot but not my day to bake I guess

Looks 10, tastes 3. Too many flavors clash in this cake. I was intrigued by the recipe because I had a couple of cans of pineapple sitting in my pantry and I happen to love ginger cake and its malty taste. The combination of ginger and pineapple was not a happy union; too sweet with neither the tang of the pineapple nor the spice of the ginger cake . It tasted muddy and cloying to me. If you still want to give it a go, I would recommend using the full 2 cups of flour. I heeded the reviews and tried it with only a cup and a half, which contributed to the cake's resulting doughy texture. The timing may also be off. Instead of 40 minutes, I had to cook it an hour and still it turned out too wet. The only star it deserves is in the looks department for this cake is a definite beauty on the outside. Good Luck!

Made this recipe with the cake recipe from the pear gingerbread upside-down cake, based on those reviews. Still thought it was only 3-star worthy. Next stop: Gramercy Tavern.

Made this yesterday and my family loved it, especially my 4 yr old son. I made it in a cast iron skillet and did not allow sugar/butter mixture to boil for more than 3 mins as it started to scorch. Also, I used half whole wheat flour and half white to add some fiber with no adverse effects and because I ran out of molasses I used about a 1/4 cup of dark corn syrup to make up the difference. Even with the WW flour I found this cake moist and delicious. It is soooo not the pineapple upside down cake from my childhood!!!!

I love gingerbread & the addition of caramelized pineapple is wonderful. We enjoyed it while still warm & didn't have any problem with the cake being dry. Caramelized pears &/or apples are yummy, too.

I made this recipe with 1/2 cup less flour since the other reviews mentioned it being too dry. No need to sift. We are on the second day of eating it, and so far, it has stayed pretty moist. For those chocolate lovers, I would add maybe a 1/4 tsp extra cocoa powder. I was skeptical at first will all of the varying flavors but it turned out really good.

I've made this recipe 3 times and people LOVE it. It was moist and delicious and a crowd pleaser. It's a great cake for a party because it looks so pretty. Feel free to play with ingredients, and I didn't sift. The most important part is carmelizing the brown sugar and butter. I baked it in an oval Creuset dish and also a glass pie pan that I poured the brown sugar/butter mixture in after heating. If you do the latter, made sure the pie pan is HOT or else the sugar will harden. Enjoy!

This is a delicious cake! However, I read the reviews and made a change. I cooked the cake in a 9x13 dish for 20 minutes...It came out thin, like a brownie or something, but there was enough pineapple and goopy butter/sugar mix to keep it moister. The flavors are wonderful together. I'd make it again!

The concept was better than the execution. The flavors are great together. Unfortunately, the cake recipe turned out extremely dry. It was edible warm with whipped cream the first night, but not at all good cold. Gingerbread typically ought to improve after standing a day. I would try again with another, moister gingerbread recipe, or perhaps try cutting down the flour to 1-3/4 or 1-1/2 cups. It would also be good as the previous reviewer suggested, as a pear upside down cake.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made it last fall for my brother & sister-in-law and they loved it. To help out on time the other day, I made the recipe with a gingerbread cake mix, mixing in the crystallized ginger and used pears in place of pineapple. It was delicious too.
