not bad, though a kinda bland. Needs lemon juice or hot sauce or something.

Great, easy dinner. I poached the eggs, as we like poached better than fried. This also saved time as I could cook the eggs as the veggies were cooking! I served with fresh, Oxnard-grown strawberries and a fig-walnut bread.
