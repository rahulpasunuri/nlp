Very overwhelming taste, I would not make this recipe again. It is nothing like I remember my grandmother making.

The overwhelming iron-like molasses taste of this cake made me think I must have made it wrong, but I hadn't. I love the molasses flavor of other gingerbread, cookies, etc., but this is way over the top. Find another recipe or reduce the molasses and increase the sugar. Also, perhaps light molasses would do the trick; I've never worked with it b/c I love richer flavor (but this cake proves there is such a thing as too much!)

this was a really good cake. i reccomend that you use a light molasses otherwise it overpowers the ginger and turns into a molasses cake. also, don't use too much Pam because it makes the outside of the cake burnt. if you do end up using too much of it it really doesn't matter because it makes it gooey which is quite good. so, this was a really good cake and i loved it. YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY! :)

i made this recipe and just added a few extras things, jiggled it around a bit. I added a little less molasses and a little more ginger, added some dried cranberries and a splash of cognac. It was absolutely delicious.

The good thing about this gingerbread is that one can't have too much of it - the flavour of the blackstrap molasses gets kind of overpowering after a while. But for the first few bites it tastes almost like a rich chocolate cake. Next time I'll probably use more ginger, though, as I could barely taste it over the molasses.

I love gingerbread, but as it turns out, I do not like blackstrap molasses. The cake itself is delicious, and I will make it again with a slight modification.

I don't really care for ginger, so I cut the amount in half. I also scooped the flour into the measuring cup and leveled it off w/ a knife so not to pack it. It was an extremely moist, but dense cake. This would be good w/ pumpkin in it too. If anyone has any suggestions on ratios of ingredients, please post. Thanks. My 2 year old even liked it!
