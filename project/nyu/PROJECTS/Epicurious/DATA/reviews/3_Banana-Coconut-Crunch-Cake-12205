OK, I'm going to throw in my two cents. This is a great, easy cake I make for my son every year for his birthday since he has graduated from chocolate cakes. It is quite idiot proof, something I always look for. I have made many substitutions over the years and they don't seem to 'kill' the cake. First I always double it as there is not enough in the present recipe for a layer cake. I use two times as many old frozen (defrosted) bananas as called for and plain yoghurt instead of creme fraiche. The cake is plenty moist then. Anytime bananas get too ripe, they go in the freezer for this cake. No rum syrup, no banana chips and my own version of cream cheese frosting (not as much sugar as someone else noted). Delicious.

Not my kind of cake. Although I added the extra baking powder it was just too dense. The cake did have a nice flavor but the texture was off putting. oh well!!

Wonderful! I made this cake with the exact ingredient quantities specified, except that I used AP flour and I used a mallet to break up the banana chips so they were in varying sized pieces. The cake was pretty dense but moist, and the frosting was a perfect consistency (and I used it all, as I love frosting). Next time I may add some rum to the frosting and sprinkle some coconut on top. But, it was a success as is.

I faced many of the problems described by other reviewers, but this cake was still a hit with my friends! First of all, the cake layers DID turn out very squat and dense. To make my cake taller, I added a layer of fresh banana slices over the first layer, and then more frosting over the banana slices. This complimented the flavors of the cake excellently, and made the overall cake much lighter. Also, if I were to make this cake again, I would put about 60% less sugar in the frosting. Cream cheese frosting does NOT need to be that sweet!

i was looking for something a little different to do with a ripe banana rather than a banana loaf, and found this. it turned out really nice, and i used it as a snacking cake rather than icing it, and getting all complicated. i followed the advice of other bakers and added a little more baking soda, and added white chocolate. you can never go wrong with banana and white chocolate. i took the rum syrup and brushed it hot on the cake right out of the oven. i wanted to ensure it stayed moist. it has a really nice crumb, not too crumbly, and it's texture is nice and light. i added a little untoasted coconut too. it is not too banana-ey, and not too coconut-ey. not too sweet either. all in all a good cake that i can add to my repetoire.

I thought this was quite good. Took the advice of others and added another 1/4 tsp of baking powder. Added 1/3 cup of untoasted coconut to the batter in response to another reviewer claiming you can't taste the coconut. Regarding the runny icing: Don't soften the cream cheese and butter. Just put the cream cheese into your mixer bowl right out of the fridge, beat it a bit, and add the butter in pieces. I use 6 T of butter to 8 oz of cream cheese, and 2 cups of powdered sugar. Skip the salt and vanilla and use 1 tsp of lemon juice. I even added a splash of coconut rum to the icing and substituted 2 tablespoons of it for 2 tablespoons of the water.

This was a delicious cake, and a little on the decadent side. I served it as a treat for my southern neighbors--they loved the banana and coconut. Among the four of us, we managed to consume 3/4 of the cake! I had none of the problems described by some of the previous reviewers, and I followed the recipe exactly.

I hate to be the dissenting voice here but I really didn't like this cake. It's certainly easy to make, although a bit labour-intensive, and it does make a whole lot of washing-up. I wouldn't mind this if I thought it was worth the effort. To me, it had a strangely one-dimensional flavour, no real impact and the'crumb'of the cake part was almost too tender and insubstantial. I thought the icing was flavourless - just rather rich and greasy tasting - and overwhelmed the cake (and I only used half the frosting recipe). Altogether a big disapppointment that wasted most of an afternoon and ended up in the garbage.

I took a lot of the advice of previous reviews and this turned out wonderfully. I added 1/4 t of baking powder to the cake. The rum syrup turned out perfectly from the recipe, and was just the right amount. It didn't make the cake soggy or anything. For the frosting, half a recipe WAS enough, and I added rum, some dried lemon peel and half of a mashed banana. It was quite good this way. I thought I'd have trouble making two layers of such a thin cake (I only had 9" square pan) but it was fine, and the frosting in the middle is a good thing. I also decorated the top with some pecan halves and made a flower out of some sliced & cut banana dipped in lemon juice. This cake is really yummy and fluffy. It would be good for brunch or dessert.

not bad. I only made half the frosting and it seemed to be plenty. I added rum to the frosting, but it probably could have used a lot more. And more rum on the cake. More rum all around. I also added a mushy banana to the frosting (had no banana chips) and though I increased the powdered sugar a bit, it wasn't as runny as I expected. The frosting also could used some lemon zest. next time.

Made this today & dinner guests were very pleased. Heeding others, I lightened it by increasing the baking powder to 1/2 tsp and adding one egg. I baked it in an 8" bundt pan (buttered & floured). When cool removed from pan & made tiny holes with the cake tester before drizzling rum sauce over it (skip the water - just use rum for the sauce). Finally, I used the banana icing recipe from Joy of Cooking (1970s) & topped with toasted coconut flakes. It was light, not overly sweet and a big hit with all. I credit my success to the comments of those who went before. Thanks very much.

I made this cake without the syrup and icing and served it with ice cream. It was fine, a great way to use up a browning banana and some leftover toasted coconut. I may make it again as a brunch dish--it's more interesting than banana bread but just as easy.

I baked this cake twice in one week for different occasions and everyone loved it. Not sure why other reviewers had a problem with a thin frosting. Consistency was fine. It was just a little tricky to spread because it pulled away from the layers until you got the hang of it.

I love this recipe, in fact I lost it and found it at this website(thank-you!). Yes, it is a dense cake ( not as dense as my banana bread either!), but thats ok. I find it an easy and delicious summertime cake. Also, I leave the coconut out without a negative effect, I use vanilla sugar for the sugar, and I use a good dark rum for the sugar/rum syrup. Yes, the icing seems a little runny at first, but the addition of the banana chips (and these must be pulverized in the cuisinart!!!) soak up the moisture; I let it sit for ~ 15 minutes to get that going and by serving time the icing is rich, dense, and very delicious. Every time I have made this it has been a big hit with requests for the recipe. Go ahead and give it a try...I think it's a hit!

Instead of trying to split the cake into layers I used a skewer and pierced holes into the top of the cake and poured the syrup over the cake and into the holes. As far as the frosting being thin, I didn't have a problem but I did add a little more powdered sugar to make it a little thicker. I also didn't add the banana chips to the frosting, instead I added more ground coconut. (My family doesn't really care for banana chips)

Please don't waste your time! I doubled the entire recipe because it didn't look right to me. It is a good thing I did that because it is a small flat cake (I made it layered with coconut pudding and sliced bananas in the middle) Inn addition, I used the cake flour (non rising) as suggested and I sifted all the dry ingredients and whipped everything well and the cake turned out to be dense like banana bread! You cannot taste the coconut in it and the frosting is runny even though I only softened, NOT melted the butter and cream cheese and even tried refrigerating it for a while. When I spread it the COOL cake, it ran, was thin and I couldn't make it look beautiful. This cake was also time consuming and I could have made a kick butt moist banana bread in a 1/4 of the time.
