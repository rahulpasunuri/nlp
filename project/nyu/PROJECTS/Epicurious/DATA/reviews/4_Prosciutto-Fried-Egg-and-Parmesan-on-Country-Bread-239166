This is my secret breakfast, I only make it for myself. I've done many variations, but is the gold standard as written.

I can't believe there aren't more reviews of this fantastic recipe! I've made it several times, just recently for guests and they LOVED it! I didn't add the anchovies because I don't like them, and no one knew they were missing. It's a great easy meal for dinner or a Sunday breakfast/brunch!

Loved this recipe! Made it for the weekend and substituted capers since I didn't have any anchovy fillets. Would definitely make this again.

Scrumptious. I've made this twice and the first time the anchovies were way too strong. Second time I used only 2 anchovies and rinsed them first, which was perfect. I also threw in plenty of extra spinach.
