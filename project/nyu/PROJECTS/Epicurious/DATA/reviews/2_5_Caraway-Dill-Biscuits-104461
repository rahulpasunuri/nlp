We had a party with 60 people, and everyone raved about them. They were outstanding with a slice of country ham and spicy mustard.

hese biscuits were just so-so. The dill taste got lost with the caraway. Also I don't think this recipe really makes 48. I made 48 and they were very small and a little hard. Maybe making less with a larger cutter would help.
