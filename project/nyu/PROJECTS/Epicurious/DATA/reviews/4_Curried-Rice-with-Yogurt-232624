We just made this and it is an excellent side of rich, flavorful rice. It was light and spicy. I think we will make a red lentil dahl later to compliment it. We grated fresh coconut instead of reconstituting dried coconut. We used cayenne as the chile powder. The mustard, fenugreek, curry leaf hot oil addition at the end lends texture and an excellent finish.

This is a delicious recipe. I substituted about 3 cups of chopped chard for the cucumber and stir-fried the seeds and spices together before adding yogurt, to reduce the number of steps.
