Loved it. I've waited 9 yrs to make spaetzle (from when i first ate the dish in Berlin). it was exactly like i remembered it. the texture, the buttery-ness. I made it with an eggplant ratatouille from the Joy of Cooking, and it was a great combo. i only had 1/4 cp milk left, so i used half and half for the rest. but it was a little thick so i added 1/4 water. i used a metal colander and figured out a swapping technique to push the dough through. it was a labor of love. i would definitely make this again.

I used a little cream to offset 2% milk, and held back a little so I had the right consistency (no need to add flour if you do milk last). Using a baggie w/ 2 corners cut was a great suggestion--I've used pastry bag in past (hate colander method) and this was even better.

This is an excellent spaetzle recipe. I pushed the batter through a colander and it worked very well. After boiling, I let it sit for an hour while I made the rest of the meal and then cooked it in a bit of butter until crispy and brown.

YUM! But what isn't yum when tossed in brown butter?! Still, for my first go at homemade noodles of any kind, this was a winner. Grill basket & about 1/2 c. extra flour as others suggested worked great.

LOVED this recipe. The batter looked a little thick, but I went ahead without tweaking it. (Other than I didn't have any whole milk, so used 2/3c 1% and 1/3 c cream.) I can see how this would turn out a mess if you don't have a spaetzle maker, though! Trying to squeeze it through a spoon or a colander just won't cut it. I used a cheap spaetzle maker that I got for Christmas and they turned out perfect. Great flavor, though I might suggest using a pinch less nutmeg if you're serving the spaetzle as-is. (Though it just might have been than my nutmeg was freshly ground and was a bit stronger than store-bought pre-ground.) At any rate, this recipe was fantastic and delicious! Will definitely make it a new staple. SUPER easy, quick, and painless. Totally worth the investment in a spaetzle maker.

my kids freak if i don't make this at least once a week. get a spaetzle maker instead of a slotted spoon, they are inexpensive and make the job soooo much easier

This was a terrific recipe. I added 3/4 c. of flour to the mixture, per another reviewer's suggestion. I also used the plastic bag trick, snipping off both bottom corners so that there were two strands of batter coming out. The end result was the perfect consistency, and was very light and tasty. I will definitely make this again. (By the way, I made up the batter in the morning before I went to work for use at dinner. It was perfect right out of the refrigerator.)

I mixed regular and whole wheat flour half & half and cup waaaay back on the butter. The "new year's resolution" turned out just fine. They seemed a little smaller and puffier as compared to the spaetzl of my youth, but they were tender and tasty. It went very nicely with roast duck for Sunday lunch, but they are time consuming and messy to make -- I used a slotted spoon and a 12 qt pot, and it still took 3 batches to get them all cooked.

The reviewer from British Columbia was right on the mark with the suggestion to use the barbeque grilling basket. The spaetzle turned out beautifully! Perfect texture! I fried up the spaezle with some coarsely chopped onion. Delicious! Next time, I will use a bit less nutmeg. YUM! This is good PMS food.

Husband can be a challenge to cook for and feed. He grew up w/authetic German cooking and really likes spaetzle, so I decided to give this a try. He liked it very much, and said he'd eat it again. I used a potato ricer to push the dough into the boiling water....messy, but it works. The brown butter is a nice touch.

I tried this recipe rather than my usual recipe that I've been using for years. Big mistake. The batter was way too loose. I didn't even have time to move the spaetzle basket back and forth because the batter just poured quickly through the holes. The recipe I have used for years always holds together in a nice tiny dumpling shape in the boiling water. This spatzle came out looking like mashed potatoes. If you do use this recipe put more flour in !! I would not use this again.

Used a BARBEQUE GRILL BASKET,(looks like a large black metal bowl with 3/8" holes, and handles)better than a spaetzle maker as it sits directly on top of any size pot of boiling water, leaving your hands free to add the spaetzle batter, and is a very fast way of cooking them. Remove the cooked spaetzle with a large slotted spoon or sieve to a large shallow pasta bowl, and toss with butter each time. Salt lightly. These are very good. Enjoy any leftovers the next day fried until golden and crispy in butter/olive oil. We like them plain fried or with ketchup. :)

The directions said I could make this two hours in advance but it all stuck together in a big soggy lump. The finished product was gummy and unappealing.

I found this batter to be way too runny with 2 cups of flour. When I went to boil it, it was the size of couscous. I added an additional 3/4 cup flour last time and it worked out just fine.

You can buy spaetzle makers. at Tuesday Morning department stores for $2.49 which regularly sell for $10.99. CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE! M!AKES THINGS A LOT EASIER It also comes with a spaetzle recipe on the package which is quite delicious, although I alter the recipe to all milk, instead of part milk and part water.

I can not find the patience to smoosh the batter through a spoon or collander...so I have discovered a trick that works magic. I pour the batter into a gallon zip bag, and cut a tiny opening into one corner...then I squeeze the batter that way. It works wonders, is easier for clean up...and my husband LOVES this dish.

I served this last night with the gorgonzola pork tenderloin and maple ginger butternut squash and everyone loved it. I took everyones advice and bought a spaetzle maker. It was easy and actually kind of fun. The great thing about this recipe is that it can sit for a couple of hours so you can make it beforehand. Spaetzle is a great alternative to rice and potatoes.

Very easy. As per suggestion from The New Professional Chef I used a potato ricer. It worked very well.

This recipe was very difficult to make at first. I tried using strainers and various slotted spoons. Nothing worked. The spaetzle turned out like grits! The I found a web site (German Corner) that sold a spaetzle maker for $15.00! What a difference!! It was so easy!! Fool proof!!I highly recommend using a spaetzle maker for this recipe. The difference is like night and day.

I had some butter milk left from the Butter Milk Ice Cream recipe so I used that instead of the whole milk. I also utilized my pasta pot with the insert along with my spaetle maker. It made removing the dumplings from the water easier.

I cut this down to 1/3's for just 2 of us. First time making spaetzle. Used newly bought spaetzle maker. Piece of cake. What fun! The spaetzle turned out light & creamy. I didn't have whole milk, so used equal parts of skim milk & heavy cream. So easy!

Great recipe, easy with a spaetzle maker. Didn't use as much butter to brown and toss. On the second time around, I added sun-dried tomato paste to the browned butter. Flavors are mild so my kids (4 yrs and 20 months) can't get enough of this. Word of caution...one minute after floating means one minute, much longer and you end up with mush. Simply put, it's quick, so don't wander off to play.

I make spaetzle all the time, and my family loves it, I make it tons of ways, with gravy, with scrambled eggs cheese bacon, with just butter and layers of cheese, with browned bread crumbs on top, yum yum, also have fried it in a pan with butter, left over roast beef, salt pepper, paprika, and a few spoonfuls of sour cream to make it rich and creamy!!! try this you will love it, also good with pork chops, make a cream sauce from heavy cream, lemon juice (to taste) paprika, and of course lots of pepper, with the pork chops (make the sauce in the pan when the pork chops are done frying,you take them out of the pan, make the sauce put them back in and continue to cook til sauce is cooked thru) poor over spaetzle and enjoy!!!! hope you all love them as much as we do, I love these noodles soooo much i will try and put them in anything!! lol, They are very easy to make, especially with a spaetzle maker or I use a potatoe ricer with the disc with the big holes, i have tried all the other ways even thru a colander (sp) but they are just to tiring, i highly reccomend you get a spaetzle maker and you will truly enjoy making them and eating them all the time!

Quick, easy and delicious -- what more could you ask for? I especially like that this can be made in advance, so it's ready when you are. I used a spaetzle maker, and this was an absolute breeze. I followed the cook from Toronto's lead and drizzled some truffle oil after cooking -- yum, yum. My family absolutely LOVED this dish! It's great even without the butter, too.

I made this recipe once & it was fantastic. The preparation was simple, although pushing the dough through the holes was tiresome. I bought a spaetzle maker in Zabar's for under $10 & plan to use it this week to make enough for 8 of us.

I don't know what all the complaints are about. I have tried to make spaetle before and it turned out to be a mess, but this one turned out perfect.It didn't take me an hour and I didn't use a spaetzle maker. I did, however, follow the directions exactly, and used a wide slotted spoon. YUM!

I lost my spaetzle recipe that I had used for years. I use spaetzle maker, which is fabulous. I wouldn't bother going through the trouble of making spaetzle without it. It makes spaetzle-making a BREEZE. I wanted spaetzle one night, so I tried this recipe. It was awful. It just glumped together in a pasty mess. My kids were SO looking forward to spaetzle, and wouldn't even eat this. Try "Joy of Cooking"s spaetzle recipe; it's far superior.

Made this as a side for our gourmet dinner group and it was a bigger hit than the main. Instead of putting in a buttered dish, I stirred in a little white truffle oil and let it stand for a couple of hours. Also, when reheating it in the butter, I added some fresh herbs.

We really enjoyed this recipe and would make it again. I made a few substitutions, I didn't have whole milk so I used skim with a little heavy cream. It was really gooey though and needed to be thinned out, I added a little more milk (to a total of 1 cup). At that point the consistency was great and it wasn't overly difficult pushing the dough through.

Very Good - Will definately make again. Nice to have a spaetzle maker.

This is a staple is Germany, especially around the Black Forest and Swabia (Southern Germany where my father is from). I have to agree with the other reviewer and add that there are spaetzle makers out there (you'll find them at cookware stores for about $10-$15). MUCH easier! The gadget is easy to use too. This is a good basic recipe; however many Germans eat spaetzle with meat gravy as a side dish to a main course. In Swabia they often toss the spaetzle in a simple cheese sauce (basic bechamel with cheese just like most mac & cheese recipes), the dish is topped with sliced onions browned very well in butter and baked to heat through. Sometimes a chopped tomato will be added. Very old rural German farm cooking here and a great variation of macaroni & cheese.

I haven't made this recipe but wanted to reply to the cook who did. There are, in fact, spaetzle makers out there. You can find them at fine cookware stores, or you may order one on-line at KitchenKaboodle.Com.

This Spaetzle is especially good. In fact it was wonderful. But plan a extra hour for preparation. It takes a very long time to push all that dough through a slotted spoon. There has to be another way. Is there a spaetzle maker?
