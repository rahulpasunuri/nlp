I found that the 1 tablespoon of black pepper was too much but otherwise this is only an ok recipe. Much depends on the type of cheese that you use. The more flavour that your cheese has, the better will be the result of these scones.

I made these for a Sunday brunch, but added crumbled bacon (that I previously baked, not fried) and a dash of cayenne pepper. They not only got rave reviews, but people actually asked for the recipe after the brunch. I used a round bisquit cutter to shape the scones and brushed the tops with egg wash before baking.

Super easy to follow recipe! Turned out flaky, buttery, cheesy, warm, goodness. Make them.

I am in New Mexico where we put green chile in everything. I added two roasted and peeled green chiles (finely chopped) with the cheese and cut the black pepper to about a teaspoon. Nice bite but not overwhelming. Will definately be putting this in a regular rotation!

I'm not a huge fan of scones or heavy bread/rolls, so I was hesitant to try these. I made them with the cauliflower with seared scallops soup that another reviewer suggested. These were very tasty and a nice side with the soup (which was fantastic!) I used a full cup of buttermilk, which added to the overall moistness of the scone.

This is a good basic savory scone. Sometimes I vary it by subbing in chilled bacon drippings for half the butter. They come out crispier. I also cut them sort of like the width and length of two fingers. It makes them crispier (best if you are going to eat them quickly). Sometimes I add larger chunks of cheddar or mix in some strong parm or toss in some bacon pieces or crispy ham. Recently I carmelized some onion rings and embedded them into the top of each scone before baking. They were pretty and a nice change. With my changes I give the recipe a 4 fork! ~naturally~

I thought these were a good first attempt, though they didn't taste cheesy enough for me. Perhaps I would change to a stronger cheddar or add a little parmesan next time. The pepper tastes much stronger the next day, so perhaps I would consider cutting back slightly. Still a good basic recipe, would try them again!

The recipe was easy and delicious. I made the dough and refrigerated it overnight so making after work was a snap

These scones are even more savory with 2 ounces of freshly grated Reggiano Parmesan and 2 ounces of Boursin instead of the cheddar. Freshly ground pepper on top makes for a nice finish. The baking aroma is out of this world.

Just got done eating one of these as it came out of the oven and it was fantastic. Just the right amount of pepper. Great with honey. I also think this would be great in the morning with gravy and scrambled eggs. I will definately make these agian.

I made ham sandwiches with the scones for a football tailgate. At first, I didn't think they were anything special. But the next day, we had the scones warm, rather than cold (the sandwiches had been in a cooler), and they were fabulous. They just melt in your mouth. I decreased the pepper by half, but next time I'll use the full amount. I shaped the dough into a rectangle & cut twenty-four 2" x 2" squares--just the right size for finger food. I'm a big fan of King Arthur flour after using it for the first time a few years ago; I'll never use another brand of flour. The King Arthur truly makes a difference.

I gave this one 4 forks because my husband loved them, and he hates scones. They really are more biscuit than scone. I cut them in 2 1/2" squares, but other than that no changes. I made double batches for a film I catered - the actors and the crew raved.

Best baking powder biscuit/scone recipe I've ever made. Made me feel successful as I've often ended up with flat or not very flakey biscusits.

These had a light texture, crumbly outside and moist inside. Not having buttermilk or yogurt on hand, I used milk soured with lemon juice which seemed to work perfectly well. I used slightly less than half the salt, because the farmhouse cheddar I had was quite sharp.

yum! the first time I made these I used buttermilk and they were pretty dry (I will admit that it could be my fault) and wasn't sure if I would make them again...but I pulled it out last night to make with orange/molasses glazed chicken....I had some sour cream to get rid of and used that instead of milk and they came out fantastic. They took a little longer (20 min) but were crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside. I'll definitely make it this way again.

Excellent! I first made this recipe in my culinary-school production kitchen, and it was very popular. A great brunch scone...

good recipe, although I would advise adding more salt than the specified amount.

I made these for a dinner party and took the leftovers to my grandmother's 85th birthday party where my aunt, who has an old Irish coffee chain's secret scone recipe, loved them and they were gone before I even had one! Everyone thought she had made them because, even a day old, they were awesome.

Easy and delicious! I loved the black pepper flavor. These made a great complement to bacon and scrambled eggs for a not-so-healthy breakfast!

One word: yum. I admit that I had a bit of trouble working the dough after combining with the moistener (I used buttermilk), but I got my elbows dirty and worked small pieces at a time. I rolled the dough out and cut them into traditional triangles.

I have made scones for years yet the last few times they came out a little too dry. I just moved in with my man and some things are still in boxes, including my recipes. So luckily I decided to try someone elses recipe and alas.....amazing. An absolute winner!

These biscuits would be a great to accompany a meal, rather than be served alone. I found them tasty, but not cheesy enough (you might want to add more cheese). Overall, they were a good experience, but definitely not amazing. And you definitely want to eat them warm.

Delicious, light, fluffy biscuits, much less dry than the typical scone. I made a large batch for a gathering and they were quickly gobbled up. The pepper makes them warm and spicy, but not too much so. These would be great with a thick chowder or stew.
