Quite possibly the best dessert I have ever eaten. Used marshmallow fluff and browned the top for a nice contrast in texture, and made the chocolate ganache with half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet and it was plenty rich!

I followed what others have said and skipped the marshmallow topic--opted to top it with a layer of mini marshmallows and then broil it. It added a nice crunchy texture that complemented the smooth creamy chocolate filling. I also opted to use a store bought crust--I imagine it would have been a bit more tasty with the homemade crust, but I was in a rush. It got good reviews at a small dinner party.

4 forks because everytime I make this it's gobbled up. I made this the first time for Thanksgiving. I attempted to MAKE the marshmallow and gave up - it was way too time consuming. Talk about a bad ROI. Instead went to mini marshmallows and just broiled them. Turned out wonderful. The second time I made it, I melted the marshmallows in a double boiler first. This made it difficult to pour over the pie before broiling it. The third time I made it, I went back to just marshmallows on top. It's definitely worth the effort.

I totally cheated with this recipe. I used 1/2 milk, 1/2 dark chocolate. I used a pre-made graham crust and mini marshmallows instead of making the marshmallow topping (if added as soon as the pie comes out of the oven, they melt to cover). I used a brulee torch instead of broiling. Even after all these alterations, the pie was fantastic! My family LOVED it, and ask me often when I will make it again.

I made this for a pot-luck dinner as I was in charge of dessert. My girlfriends LOVED it and I have to admit I enjoyed it as well, however nex time I would do 1/2 milk chcolate, 1/2 dark chocolate, as it was a little too rich for me (and I LOVE chocolate). I used pre-made graham cracker crust but I layered some extra pieces of graham crackers on the bottom because I just love that flavor. I also used the mini-marshmallows shorcut and it turned out great. I waitied until right before I was ready to serve the pie and broiled the top so it didn't harden. Turned out great and with all the shortcuts, it was super easy!

this tasted really good but I would def make some changes. 1st I would use hershey bars for the chocolate (just like a real smore). I would toast the marshmallow with a mini torch (like for creme brulee). Finally, I would NOT refrigerate. The filling gets way too hard and cold - unlike real smores.

I made this for Christmas dinner and overall it was very good. The crust is excellent and very, very easy. The best graham cracker crust I've had so far. In fact, everything about this recipe was easy, and I didn't have any trouble with the marshmallow topping like some other reviewers. I do agree that I would make changes to the chocolate filling as 1) it was too thick compared to the other layers and 2) it wasn't sweet enough. I mean, it tastes really good, but not like the chocolate you'd use in smores. I do plan on making this again though! It was a total hit.

Wish I had read these reviews before tackling. I used 70% cacao and it was just too bitter (and I like dark chocolate). Also, I made the marshmallow topping twice and couldn't figure out how NOT to have it turn into hard candy as soon as the beaters touched it. Now I know to cook to 240 instead of 260 as the recipe calls for. Having said that, what topping I was able to save I really liked. Will try this again using a combination of bitter and milk chocolate and removing the topping from the heat at soft ball stage.

If I could enter a rating for each layer I would have to give the fluff topping a negative rating. Now I admit to trying to make it by substituting (once with org. corn syrup, once with rice syrup, both times with vegan thickener). Both were a BOMB. But having said that, the chocolate layer and the cookie crust (made with wheat-free animal cookies) were great! Next time I am putting peanut butter pudding and whipped cream on instead of that fluff layer.

Way too rich. I did a test run before making it for Christmas, and decided against serving it.

I loved the concept of this pie, so gave it a try for Thanksgiving. I made my own crust and I think that's what "makes" the pie so wonderful. The chocolate center was way too bitter for my taste, but the marshmallow's sweetness helped somewhat to balance it all out. It was eaten up though, every last piece. I had used bittersweet chocolate that was aproximately 65% chocolate liquer. Next time I will mix half semi-sweet with the bittersweet, and I will surely be more pleased. My biggest concern was finding a pie pan that is suitable to place under the broiler. I covered mine with ample foil and hoped not to disurb the crust too much. I used the jar of marshmallow creme to save time and clean-up. And I will continue doing so unless I have a huge amount of excess time and energy to make it all from scratch the next time. This is a very rich recipe that was very easy to make with my simple little short cut, that I've noted others have used as well. Thanks.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner with the family. Couldn't get the marshmallow topping to come out right, probably b/c I don't have a candy thermometer. Gave up and used a jar of marshmallow topping. It didn't brown evenly under the broiler, I think the creme brulee torch would work better if I had one. Everyone loved it though, it was the only pie completely gone by the end of the day. And it also didn't take 7 hours to make, as the recipe says. Will definitely make this again!

This pie is delicious - but RICH!! It's definitely one for chocaholics. I used one bar of Ghiradelli bittersweet and 3/4 bar semi-sweet chocolate, which balanced well with the super sweetness of the marshmallow layer. Gotta admit, I copped out and used a store bought crust, which was just fine. Though I am an experienced cook, after reading what others had to say about the difficulties they had with the Marshmallow, I figured - why bother? I opted for the easy way out and used marshmallow fluff from the jar. I let the baked pie cool for about five minutes, then spooned the fluff on top of the hot pie filling, where it spread out beautifully on its own. Then chilled it, and popped it under the broiler as directed. But DO watch it very carefully as it broils! It goes VERY QUICKLY!

This pie is insanely good, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like s'mores at all. I was afraid this pie would be too sweet and make me ill, but somehow I've eaten three pieces! It looks scary to slice, like it will all get sticky and run together, but that's not the case at all; it slices beautifully. I also used the culinary blowtorch to brown the topping and recommend doing that at the last minute to retain the crackly crispness. Delicious! (Now I finally know what "S'mores" means .. if there were any of this pie left, I'd be having some more.)

I made this for a dinner party for my friends and they LOVED it. I thought it was good, but next time I would put an additiional layer of graham crackers on the bottom and do 1/2 bittersweet, 1/2 milk chocolate. The chocolate was just a little too intense, especially when you're trying to evoke the feeling of a smores. I've never eaten a bittersweet chocolate smore, but that's just me ;) Great recipe though, will definitely make it again

Great for everyone! Surprised no one has thought of this before. So gooey good looking. The marshmallow topping takes patience to make and precise timing but is all worth it.

Okay, I'll be honest. I've made this recipe as written and it was gone by morning. Had the same trouble with the marshmallow, but it was still great. But as a shortcut, I've also made it with a prefab graham cracker crust and jarred marshmallow! It's not as good, but it's better than most desserts.

I've made this pie several times and everyone loves it! I follow the recipe exactly when preparing for adults, and substitute 6oz Hershey's milk chocolate + 1 oz bittersweet when making for kids. It's delicious both ways, but my kids definitely prefer it with the milk chocolate. I use a creme brulee torch to brown the marshmallow so the bottom layers stay cool and the very top is hot. Delicious! Oh - I usually do the marshmallow without a stand mixer and haven't had a problem.

Won best overall at my office for this. It worked well sitting overnight and used a toaster oven to broil the topping...while not ideal it worked. Great recipe and worth the time for something so one of a kind.

Rating: 3
This is a very good recipe. I used high quality bittersweet chocolate, and of course it was very rich as the chocolate layer was basically ganache with an egg added. I pulled the marshmallow mixture off the stove at 240'. It also took a good 10+ minutes, using my stand mixer on high speed, to get the marshmallow to triple in size. Maybe I could have gotten it to increase in size more if I would have continued to beat the marshmallow, but at that point I was starting to have concern for my mixer. I WOULD NOT ATTEMPT WITHOUT A STAND MIXER! I used a spring form pan, not a good idea! The marshmallow gets soft and runny after broiling and takes a LONG time to re-solidify. Definitely use a pie plate for this one!

This was fabulous! I also had issues with the marshmallow topping and had to make it twice. I didn't read the comments on this site until after my first flop or I would have only had to do it once! I agree that the syrup temp should probably be closer to 240- 250 (the 6 minute mark in the recipe is pretty close). Once it starts to get a hint of golden color, you've gone too far. Even on the 2nd attempt, I was never able to get it to whip to 3X volume, but 2X worked well enough. And if you are careful about not browning the topping too much the first time, I was able to broil it again to crisp the marshmallow topping for leftovers- -tasted as good as the first time! I also recommend letting the pie come to room temp before serving. The chocolate filling is pretty solid out of the fridge, and the broiler doesn't warm it up enough.

This is absolutely perfect. My 8 year old loved the marshmallow best, my husband loved the chocolate layer the most and my 11 year old adored the crust. I loved it all. Started thinking about when I could make it next as I was eating it the first time...

Followed recipe precisely and had no problems with the topping. Really enjoyed the combination of flavors and appearance of the pie. Only negative was that the crust fell apart and the three layers did not stick together well, but I used a smaller pie plate than was recommended and may have made the crust too thick.

Ok, I was really excited to make this for Thanksgiving, it looked delicious in the magazine. I liked it quite a bit, but I like dark chocolate (used 60% cacao bar). Others in my family weren't so happy with it and suggested using a milk chocolate bar next time as they thought the dark choc. was too bitter. Plus that would be more like the s'mores that use a Hershey bar. The topping was great right out of the oven, I didn't have trouble with the temp but did have trouble figuring out how long to beat it. I overdid it and so it was hard to spread w/o messing up the chocolate below. But you may want to make sure the pie gets eaten in one sitting, the marshmallow topping when it cools becomes very solid. I probably won't make it again, the end result wasn't worth the time involved in making it.

This pie turned out as pictured. It tasted fine, but nothing spectacular. The chocolate filling was good but the pie was too rich for my taste. None of my guests said more than "this is good". If you love s'mores and rich desserts you should give it a try but I will not make it again.

Already making this again today. Didn't have time or energy for the homemade topping, I carefully aligned mini-marshmallows upright over the top which looked very cool after the broiler. Also used 8oz of 60% bittersweet and it was not too dense by any stretch. This was so good we didn't let the kids have any!

Ok, first off don't even attempt to make this pie if your not very experienced in the kitchen. The syrup for the marshmellow topping should be cooked just under the soft ball stage to about 240 degrees. Cooking to 260 resulted in rock candy for me. It is easily remade though. Making the topping yourself is so much more rewarding than cheating and putting the fluff on top. Plus, it really doesn't take that long to make. I made the filling with 70% cocoa and it was a bit too dark for some, but I LOVE dark chocolate, so it was good to me. Watch the topping in the broiler LIKE A HAWK! It will burst into flames if you don't, but luckily I know my broiler(not done one second...burned the next)and didn't make this mistake. When our family gets together for Thanksgiving it's about 40 people with most of them bringing a dessert item. This pie was the only thing that was totally gone by the end of the day. It was a success I would deffinatly make again for any occation.

This was a big hit with young and old (ages 6-71) at our family Thanksgiving. I do have two caveats, however. First,I can't imnagine doing this without a stand mixer to beat the marshmallow topping. Secondly, you need to watch the marhmallow like a hawk when it's in the broiler. I turned my back and the top went black. However, I scraped off the black top layer and the pie was still delicious. I don't think my family will let me host Thanksgiving again without making this.

Unfortunately, my experience with Chocolate S'more Pie was closer to eversince from Los Angles than A Cook from Norfolk MA. I tried the marshmallow topping twice, and got rock candy each time. I think the sugar syrup temperature is wrong, too high. I then did what A Cook for Stockton, Ca did, I used a jar of Fluffy Marshmallow Topping and called it a day. I mean it was Thanksgiving morning and I had a turkey to get in the oven! Everyone loved the pie, my son announced that this would now be his new Birthday Pie. Chocolate filling was very dense. Next time I will use a single 5.3 oz chocolate bar instead of 7 oz.

This is a good pie for s'mores fans. It was a hit with the 18-and-under crowd... everyone else took a forkful and agreed it was VERY sweet. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect -- the marshmallow really does require 5 solid minutes of the electric beater on high. A very sticky undertaking... can't see myself making this again.

My Aunt made this for Thanksgiving. It was a hit, everyone loved it so much! Im on here to print it out myself and make it for my hunny. My Aunt put Marshmallow Fluff on top instead of making the topping. It was A beautiful golden brown, Like a real smore.

Cursed the name of Gourmet magazine when my first marshmallow attempt turned into cotton candy (plus a bit of rock candy) in the standing mixer. Tried again, this time only boiling the sugar mixture to just short of 240 degrees, and it worked well (although didn't quite "triple in volume" as the recipe indicates). Next time, will double the marshallow portion, as more marshmallow is needed to balance the rich chocolate layer (used a 4.5 ounce bar of Cadbury Dark bittersweet chocolate, and the rest milk chocolate). The result is beautiful (heed the advice of another reviewer - keep the oven door open while you broil the top, and watch constantly!), and as rich as a candy bar.

Will have to make again because my daughter was so disappointed when it burst into flames. 3-4 inches from the broiler, as the directions indicate, may be a bit too close and do not set the oven timer for 3 minutes and walk away. Think of what happens when holding marshmallows over the campfire and multiply the effect by 10. Once the flame went out, (immediately turn off oven and keep the door closed if this happens to you) and we scraped off the incinerated marshmallows, the kids thought it was pretty good.... but it may take a while to get over the trauma.

I tried making the marshmallow topping three times and it simply didn;t fluff up. I am not sure what I could be doing differently. Otherwise, this recipe is delicous and worked as long as I used store bought marshmallows.

Rich, dense and delicious. I used a Ghirardelli Bittersweet Baking Bar with 60% Cocoa. I believe it's quite important to use bittersweet chocolate so the flavor does not become overwhelmed by the chocolate. I made the marshmallow topping as directed, but didn't have a candy thermometer. A few sugar lumps formed while blending which flew across the kitchen...I had to pick them out of the cat and dog's fur quickly! Otherwise, this dessert was a huge success at our friends dinner party...the kids especially loved it.

The first bite was overwhelming - too strong of a chocolate taste. I didn't make the marshmallow topping, but used store bought marshmallows.

I used 60% cacao chips. Since a true s'more uses regular store-bought ingredients, I cheated and bought a pre-made graham cracker crust and used marshmallow fluff instead of making from scratch. It was excellent - the chocolate layer is super rich but delicious. I think I made too much chocolate, next time I'll try to equalize the layers more.

To Bevamery from England - yes a digestive biscuit base is similar to a graham cracker base. A s'more is a traditional campfire treat where you toast your marshmallow on a stick and then put it between two graham crackers (they are shape of Ryvita), along with a few squares of chocolate. The hot marshmallow melts the chocolate and you have a delicious gooey treat. If you try using premade marshmallows let us know how it worked out.

I've never heard of ' s'more ' before but this looks delicious. I've also no idea what graham crackers are. Would this be similar to a digestive biscuit base? My 12 year old daughter wants to make it so I thought I'd just pack those big round fluffy marshmallows on top. Would this work?

Rating: 4
Soooo good! The chocolate is indeed very rich so next time, I'll cut down on the quantity. Also, a word of caution: do follow the 3-4 inch broiler recommendation. In my overzealousness, I put mine 2 inches from the broiler. It's pretty impressive to see a whole pie on fire in your oven!

Do not knock this until you try it. It even improves with age. I used a ready made marshmallow instead of making my own and put it on the chocolate right as it came out of the oven, this allowed the mallow to ooze all over the top perfectly. I also took the advice of another reviewer and used 60% cacao chocolate. Just like a being by the campfire in your living room.

All I can say to previous reviewer ... you've never done a real s'more over a campfire have you? If you had, you surely would know that the true "prize" is roasting the marshallow so it's totally melted inside as it's gently fire roasted to a golden brown on the outside. The real ones look just like the picture. How much better can you get!

I disagree with one of the previous reviews. I don't think it looks yucky. Just by reading the recipe, it looks like a yummy treat. I've not tried it yet, but I'm thinking about it. If you love chocolate, I think you would enjoy such a dessert... At least, give it a shot before you give your opinion!!!

The chocolate part of the pie was very rich, I definitely reccomend using 60% cacao. I had to make the marshmallow part twice because the first time I let the sugar get too hot and when I poured it into the gelatin it was a lumpy gluey mess. This recipe was a lot of effort for a so-so recipe. Real s'mores are ten times tastier and EASIER!!!
