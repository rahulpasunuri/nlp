Made these last night for a potluck. They are super easy, even without a mandoline. Mine may not have been perfect squares but they still looked elegant and were inhaled. Of course, there were a lot of teen boys and they eat almost anything... I reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes and used 6 very large potatoes. I roasted the cleaned potato "scraps" on a cookie sheet at the same time (shook them with olive oil and miscellaneous herbs). That way we could munch on "poor man potatoes" while admiring the "rich man potatoes" before the event.

This is an amazingly simple and delish recipe. Who knew bay leaves could be used this way? Weren't we taught that you only use them to throw in the soup pot!? One challenge is that they cannot be made ahead because you can't soak them in water to prevent browning. These are challenging to make for a large crowd!

No need to peel the potatoes if you are slicing off the sides and ends. I've made this twice and both times it disapeared. So fragrant and crispy and beautiful to look at. I would recommend doubling the recipe since the amount of potatoes is rather small once they are trimmed. I like the fact that this dish is not all that time- sensitive, meaning it can sit a bit if the rest of the dinner isn't quite ready. Great for a dinner party.

My guests loved these potatoes. Lots of waste but kept the sides and extras and made mashed potatoes. With the mandoline the slicing was easy. Wasn't sure that my "meat, potatoes, and gravy" guests would like them, But they loved them and almost licked the dish clean.

We love this recipe and it is such a beautiful and simple presentation. The WOW"s we received when serving them surely made the effort making them all that more worthwhile. To the reveiwers who hated all that waste. try making a spanish tortilla with the leftovers the next day!

This was one of the most simplest and delicious potato recipes I've ever tried. Let' face it potatoes can be boring. This recipe not only looks beautiful, which I must confess is the reason why I made it, but tastes wonderful! It's amazing how so few ingredients can change a potato. This is a keeper. I will make this again and again. This October 2011 issue had so many good recipes in it, it kept me awake at night!

Delicious! Used duck fat instead of butter. Wonderful. Cooked in less time than 1 hour. Will definitely make again.

Very rich and delicious- beautiful presentation as well. I used the whole potato rather than cutting them into rectangles and it was still just as pretty without all the waste.

Absolutely Loved these Made a five pound bag for 11 guests Should have made 10 pounds. Everyone wanted seconds You'll need to be creative with all the left-over potatoes created by slicing the shape.

These are delicious. You do lose a lot of potato when making the rectangle shape. Keep an eye on them as mine were almost overcooked at 40 minutes. I was running an errand and asked my husband to take them out of the oven. A third of the pan disappeared before I returned home. Hmm. The kids were fighting over who would get to have the remaining potatoes.

This was great just out of the oven. Not as good at room temp or reheated. Saved a lot of time by slicing potatoes in the food processor. Also made a second batch with even thinner sliced potatoes just reduced the cooking time and let them brown more. A very easy fast recipe.

I simply do not think this is worth the time or effort to make. Just an okay recipe. The picture looks beteer than it actually is. A one time recipe!

Loved this.Made ahead and reheated.Only issue was the bay leaves browned after only 10 minutes so perhaps I would use smaller or halved leaves so less stick out.

Simple, yet elegant. It impressed my kids, and they don't impress easily. I used a cast-iron skillet, and covered the bottom with onion slices to keep the potatoes from sticking. The onions caramelized and were delicious. I will make again, but will save the rectangles for special occasions. I'm sure it will be just as delicious, and nearly as visually impressive with round dominoes.

Great, classic recipe. Made as directed first time, then used cooking spray second time, but buttered pan. Potatoes turn out a bit crispier but little difference in taste. For the reviewer who thought this recipe was wasteful: I cooked the excess potato pcs and made mashed potatoes.

These were lovely, if a bit too rich for me. My family really liked them. If doing for company, I will trim the potatoes for presentation, but I'll use the whole potatoes for a weeknight thing. Also, these are great with minced rosemary instead of bay leaves. I will be trying them with sweet potatoes per a previous reviewer's suggestion.

After enjoying the recipe as written, I tried using sweet potatoes with cumin butter and sage leaves. Wow! This was great with a rack of slow cooked pork ribs. Cooking time was a bit less with the sweets.

Simply delicious. Paired this with a big ribeye steak and sauteed fresh beet greens. Loved the combo.

Absolutely delicious but incredibly wasteful. In making the domino shapes, you lose a lot of potato!

I didn't have any bay leaves, but I had some sage, so I made this with the sage instead and it was so delicious and so beautiful. What a great and simple recipe!

This recipe is one of those rare gems...incredibly easy to make, simple ingredients, looks gorgeous when served and, best of all, TASTES WONDERFUL. It can also work with several types of fresh herbs...bay leaves are great, but I also made it with fresh sage leaves and it was magnificent. The parts of the sage that protrude become crisp, like fried sage. The potatoes are both crisp and tender. Worthy of a very good restaurant. I will make this until I'm old and gray.
