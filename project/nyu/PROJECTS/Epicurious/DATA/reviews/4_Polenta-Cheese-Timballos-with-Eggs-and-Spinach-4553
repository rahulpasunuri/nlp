I've made this recipe twice now and I love it! The only changes I've made are as follows: #1: find the biggest muffin cups you can, or better yet just use a medium sized ramekin (once you line the cups and put the egg in it starts to over flow before you even try to put the lids or the cheese on. #2: my hubby is a chef, and he's made lots of polenta in his life; he adds the butter and cheese, plus some half and half or whipping cream, in addition to the broth, for a nice creamy texture (maybe look around at some other polenta recipes for specific amounts) #3: if you like your eggs on the runny side, bake the cups and the lids (on a separate tray) without filling them for about 10 minutes, then add the egg and cheese and lids...bake for another 12-15 minutes. This should make for a nice runny yolk inside. Otherwise, this recipe is delicious!
