I've made this recipe many times and is a keeper. Also tried the suggested red wine vinegar and blue cheese very tasty!

I am a big fan of roquefort dressing so have tried many over the years. This one is excellent! I used homemade mayonnaise in this recipe and was very happy with the results!

I've been making this since '96 and it's been great every time. I use fresh mayonnaise, cut down a little, and I tried adding the red wine vinegar. It was even better! Great as a dip too.

Add 2t. of red wine vinegar and you will have an EXCEPTIONAL dressing. We did the old iceberg wedge with grape tomatoes and crumbled bacon. The only problem is that you will want to eat it all the time!

I don't know whether it is the taste of the dressing or memories of the formal Ritz Dining Room which closed in January, replaced by a more casual restaurant, but we think this dressing is excellent. High quality Roquefort and homemade mayonnaise make a difference. Thanks to the cook from Atlanta who suggested adding the capers - very good!

I made this recipe for a bibb lettuce and grape tomoto salad. Wonderful! So creamy. Next time I would add a little garlic to it though.

We found that this was too thick and had an odd taste. I've had other creamy roquefort dressings that I much prefer. We threw out the remaining dressing after the first use.

I cut the Mayo to just one cup and added more buttermilk for a not so thick dressing. I also used lite mayo to cut the calories. Tastes great!

This recipe is SO delicious. I've made it with blue cheese, as well as roquefort, and they're equally tasty. I like to add small- to medium-size capers to add a bit of a zing. I definitely recommend this recipe!

I don't care for the very thick style blue cheese or roquefort dressings often found in super market refrigerator cases. This dressing is easy to make, light-tasting and wonderful. I'm about to make it for the third time and now keep the recipe in my permanent file.
