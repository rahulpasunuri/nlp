A table of 10 friends couldn't get enough. It's a bit decadent and one cannot eat much of it. I didn't have time to roast cherries so I put dried figs in instead, which worked great. Because I knew it had cornstarch, it affected my opinion because I didn't like having to use that ingredient. It's incredibly smooth but the smallest bit gummy. I'm not sure how anyone could say it was grainy. Quite the opposite.

This recipe was neither cheesy enough nor did it have enough cherries--but it was plenty goat-y! I doubled the cherries and used an ordinary goat cheese. If I try it again, I'll triple the cherries just use cream cheese. I also the water bath method was such a hassle in my tiny kitchen that I'll stick to my former method or making the custard early in the day to thoroughly chill before turning it to ice cream.

I've never had goat cheese ice cream before, but like other reviewers mentioned, it has a cheesecake mouthfeel to it. It's not an ice cream where I would want to sneak several scoops, because it is so rich, but it is definitely an impressive treat for guests. I wouldn't consider it 'refreshing' like how other fruit featured ice creams tend to be, because of the goat cheese. I decided to use tapioca starch instead of corn starch, which is a substitute listed in Jeni's book, and I have to say I might continue to go this route. Besides using roasted strawberries instead of cherries (due to personal preference) the only other deviation from the recipe was that I strained the hot milk mixture before adding It to the goat cheese/cream cheese mixture, and that really smoothed things out.

This was incredible. A perfect romantic dessert for my anniversary dinner, would also be sweet for valentine's day. The texture was creamy for me, not chalky like some people posted. The difference may have been that I used a very high quality goat cheese. The ice cream paired beautifully with the cherries, but I have also served a dollop of it plain alongside a red wine chocolate cake and everyone agreed it was the perfect accompaniment.

A reviewer below noted a grainy texture, and I found the texture to be less than ideal myself. Not grainy, though. More like chalky, which I suspect is from the cornstarch. I was wary of this technique for that very reason. I boiled it until it was slightly thick, which took a little longer than a minute. In my experience, it seems like no matter how long you boil a cornstarch mixture, it always has an off-texture on your tongue, and it seems like this may have been the case in this recipe. Of course, goat cheese can be a bit chalky as well, so maybe that was the contributing factor. Also, though the recipe promised to retain a better texture in the home freezer than other recipes, I didn't find that to be true. The best ice cream recipes I've used have come from David Lebovitz, and they work quite well in the home freezer (the tin roof sundae is indistinguishable from commercial ice cream in texture), maintaining a silky quality for a couple of days. I guess I was hoping for an improvement over even that, and it was not the case. Anyway, this gets 3 stars because I did like the flavor and the texture was acceptable, but not the exquisite sensory experience I was expecting. My husband was less than impressed by the flavor, and spat it out, so he didn't really have time to comment on the texture. I might make it again if I happened to be out of eggs and wanted homemade ice cream, but it's not likely. Oh, and whoever tagged this as kid friendly is clearly mad. You might get a kid or two who would eat this (if you could get them past the concept of goat cheese ice cream), but more likely than not you'll be pulling out some Breyer's vanilla for them. I'm a little bummed that I bought the author's book before trying the recipes published here. I wouldn't have if I had.

I've made this several times now with great success, but not the cherries. the 1st time I followed the recipe,but added some vanilla. It had a nice cheese cake like flavor. I've used the same base for a number of other flavors such as Irish Creame, Ameretto, and a Hazelnut using a Chocolate Hazel nut spread like Nutella and Frangelico. I have been making a base using the strawberry gelato from this site that also uses cornstarch. I find my liquor based gelatos do not freeze as solid as I would like due to the liquor even when simmered for a while. The goat cheese and cream cheese seems to overcome that and they freeze nicely. I added a tbl of liquor to top a serving and added some chopped toasted and buttered hazel nuts as a topping which made it special.

I haven't made this recipe, so I won't rate it. I'm looking for one that is cow dairy free. Any ideas for substitutions, say for the cream cheese?

I made a different flavor of ice cream (cake donut) using the base recipe that Jeni Bauer has released recently in her cookbook, and which this recipe is also based on. (The base is just this recipe minus the goat cheese and cherries.) A local ice cream truck here makes incredibly creamy, not eggy tasting, weirdly light in some ways, ice creams, and I have always wondered how they did it. Jeni's base recipe seemed like it might be the trick. The ice cream truck I love has a donut flavored ice cream, including little donut crumbs, so I tried that. (I just steeped donut crumbs in hot milk for a while, strained them out, then proceeded from there with the rest of the recipe, and folded in some more dry donut crumbs at the end.) It was completely vile. All you could taste was the cornstarch. The texture was pretty good, but hard to even assess objectively in the face of the absolutely disgusting taste. I think this cornstarch technique might be good with extremely intense flavors to overpower the cornstarch, and that does seem to be a pattern in the Jeni's ice cream flavors I have seen, including this goat cheese one (e.g "beet mascarpone poppy seed," "darkest chocolate ever," etc). So I would say, please don't make her recipes with light or simple flavors like I did! In the past I have made a goat cheese ice cream that involved corn syrup, plus lots of egg yolks, but no cornstarch. That was absolutely amazing, and all my guests raved. I think I am going to try again with the corn syrup and 3Tbs cream cheese or goat cheese, but no cornstarch, and a few yolks.

This was very good. I used Rainier cherries so reduced the sugar on the roasted cherries a little. I think I would have preferred a more tart cherry. This was still really delicious. The texture is a little grainy which is the only reason I gave this a 3 instead of a 4. No one else mentioned this though so I I'm wondering if I did something wrong. Love the idea of serving this with grilled peaches. That would be perfect.

OMG!!!!! Ican't believe I found a goat cheese ice cream recipe. I went to this restaurant about 3 years ago and they had a goat cheese ice cream desert with grilled peaches. They wouldn't give me the recipe.I was so disapointed. I made this today, and like I said at the top...OMG!!!! It is so creamy, smooth and rich. It tastes just like cheese cake only better. It's truly decadent with the cherries. Brava!!! Next time I make this I'll serve it with grilled peaches, or any other fruit for that matter. Fantastico!!!

Ice cream was easy to make, and delicious. No problem there... but the roasted cherries were NOT good. they were sickeningly sweet. Totally unnecessary for the ice cream. If you need a fruit to compliment the ice cream, just slice up something fresh... don't hide the creamy/slightly tart flavor under a red sugar bomb!

This is absolutely amazing! The ice cream is extremely smooth and creamy. Don't skip the roasted cherries - they add a lot!

Delicious! The roasted cherries are wonderful. I used a mixture of fresh bings, Rainiers, and frozen pie cherries and baked those for 45 minutes. I wanted more vanilla flavor so scraped in the seeds from about 1/2 a vanilla bean into the ice cream.

Just finished making this ice cream- the bomb!! Used fresh blueberries in place of cherries. People freak out when you say Goat Cheese ice cream, but the tangy flavor reminds you of greek yogurt.Its gonna be beautiful served in a martini glass after a grilled meal on the deck...

Wow. This ice cream was good. Creamy and good texture when hardened. I didn't make the roasted cherries. Just plain is good. And it does taste like frozen cheesecake. This would be good on top of apple pie, cherry pie slice.

I've just made this ice cream over the weekend. Despite messing up on the cornstarch step, it came out amazing! I topped mine with a home made sour cherry compote instead of adding roasted cherries. LOVED. Here are the photos from the recipe http://www.mangotomato.com/2011/07/jenis-ice-creams-goat-cheese-ice-cream.html

This was absolutely amazing. I didn't make the cherries, but paired the ice cream with a lattice topped cherry pie for the fourth. This seriously tastes like cheesecake ice cream too! In addition, the texture is so creamy. Just make sure you give the ice cream plenty of time to thaw out before serving. Absolutely delightful!
