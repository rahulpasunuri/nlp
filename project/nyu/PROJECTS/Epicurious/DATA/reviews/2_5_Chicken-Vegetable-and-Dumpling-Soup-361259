I make turkey and chicken stock ahead of time, and skip the first part of the recipe. The idea of basically making stock as part of the process of making the meal seems to turn people off- too much time and as a reviewer put it - "wasteful". But it is an old fashioned technique that creates flavor superior to store-bought stocks. I use thanksgiving turkey remains to make stock and then freeze it- a way to "waste" less but still get rich flavor for quicker cooking times. I like the brown flavor the roue adds to this, and the dumplings themselves are amazing- although perhaps tricky for dumpling novices to make. The celery leaves int he dumplings are a great flavor addition, and I love the flavor of parsnips in the mix.

I combined a couple of different recipes for the chicken and dumpling soup I took to a soup potluck. I liked the idea of adding a roux as described here, so I used that feature of this recipe. It gave the soup some body and made it easier and neater to eat. I intend to make this recipe sometime, but I am definitely going to add a roux to future chicken soups.

Very good and different. Had trouble at first with dumplings, water has to be at a very low simmer but they are worth it. Stock is very involved, don't know that I would go to same effort again but concept of recipe would be worth doing again for sure!

Help! My dumplings have disintegrated. I have checked the recipe and have made it exactly as stated. I have tried lowering the boil and drop instead of dipping in water. I was attracted to this recipe because of dumplings. The soup takes forever and seems rather wasteful.
