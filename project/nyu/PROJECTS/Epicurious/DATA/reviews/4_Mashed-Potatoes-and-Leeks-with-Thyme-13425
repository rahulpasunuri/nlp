After reading the reviews I was so excited to try this recipe. I was making a simple Spring dinner last night of double lamb chops with balsamic glaze and asparagus and thought the potato with leeks sounded delicious. It was tasty but I didn't like the texture at all. I also love leeks but thought 6 were about 3 too many. The texture is just strange...the smooth mashed potatoes and the chopped leeks..even though I cooked them until very soft..just missed.I did put 2 thyme spring sin the cooking water and I think that adds flavor.

yes, SIX WHOLE LEEKS! i was a little afraid at first, also. i wondered maybe it means 6 leek "leaves" but NO! i searched online for help and found that when a recipe calls for 1, 2, 3 or more leeks it really means WHOLE leeks. so, i'm making dinner for just my husband and myself so i used 2 potatoes and 2 whole leeks, cooked them down for almost 20 minutes on low heat. i got them nice and tender and finished the dish. it's deeelicious!

The big advantage of this recipe, besides its inherent quality, is that almost all the work can be done the day before. All you have to do before serving is heat the dish in the oven. This makes it perfect for large meals, such as Thanksgiving, as mentioned by another reader.

I cut the leeks down as suggested by others. The flavors are terrific and I thought this was great for Thanksgiving since I could put it in the oven.

My family loves this recipe! I've been making it for Thanksgiving and or Christmas since it appeared in 1996. Not only does it taste great but you can make it ahead of time.

Made these last years- as in recipe- for Thanksgiving, and they got rave reviews. Easy since they are prepared a day ahead of the big day. This year, I may make them with scallions or shallots instead of leeks to eliminate having to clean the leeks.

We made this dish over the weekend and everyone loved it. I was a little skeptical that mashed potatoes made the day before would really be that good, but they were. This is a great recipe for Thanksgiving when it helps if there are some things that can be made ahead of time.

I liked this recipe, but I left the leeks sliced instead of chopped. For the sake of texture, do not make the same mistake! I'm not so sure that I like this better than my normal mashed potatoes. This dish does, though, has the advantage of being able to make it ahead.

Part of this year's Thanksgiving menu, and everybody liked it a lot. I adjusted the leeks to 4, and it was still plenty. I also used 2% milk and substituted half-and-half for the cream, and it was still delicious.

Very good. Though I prefer a milder leek taste. Next time will use only 2-3 stalks and make sure they are chopped finer, about 1/2 inch thick slices. Did not use thyme because the store was out. Unnecessary if you are serving to traditional eaters.

I second the opinion that it seems crazy to give 4 forks to mashed potatoes, but hey, these are amazing. I used a tip that I found somewhere else on epicurious... add a sprig of rosemary to the water with the potatoes, and discard it with the water. Adds a loveley flavour. I also mash the potatoes leaving them lumpy.

I used 2 very large leeks instead and it seemed to be enough. Everyone liked the extra flavours from leek and herb. Will make again for sure.

I was actually looking for 2 recipes (one for potatoes and one for leeks) when I found this one. I thought it was going to taste a little bland, but was very pleasantly surprised at the wonderful taste and fabulous flavors that this dish provided. I did cut down a tiny bit on the butter, so added some grated gruyere to make up for the lost calories....

Great potato dish. Made it with Yukon Gold and it was absolutely delicious. Love that you can make it ahead of time. Will make it again!

This is not your ordinary mash potatoes. Very easy and very yummy. Will do this many many other times!

The only thing that would make this better is if one could remove all the calories added by the butter and cream! This was just the ticket for make ahead mashed potatoes for dinner guests. Thanks to all who contributed their opinions that made me want to try these. For a treat serve these with the braised short ribs from the Em Bistro in the November 2005 RSVP section. I substituted pork shoulder ribs for the beef ribs, but used that recipe with these potatoes alongside and it was a winning combo.

It may seem odd to give a mashed potato dish 4 forks, but this is the only recipe I use anymore because everyone prefers it. Leeks are a perfect pairing for potatoes, and I usually prefer them to onions in many dishes (from stuffing to soups). As a side note, I will sometimes leave the peel on the potatoes and then use less water for boiling (and don't pour much off) so I'm not discarding most of the vitamins, and then gently mash the leeks in (leaving some texture). I use more thyme and some crushed garlic, depending on what it will be served with. For company I peel and serve smooth, but we like the texture when it's just for us. Try it!

Let me get this straight San Mateo.....you omitted all the butter and salt, then had the nerve to say this was a bad recipe. I blame the cook instead of the recipe!

Overall this was very good. We did not chill, but made and then warmed in the oven for an hour. The flavor was very good and we will make this again the same way.

This was the first time I have cooked with leeks. How do I know if I prepared them correctly? Over moderately low heat, I ended up cooking them for a very long time, almost as long as the potatoes were simmering. Also, the green leeks tinged the potatoes green; did that happen to anyone else? For that reason alone, I will not make this recipe again. I confess I replaced the heavy cream with milk and omitted all the butter and salt, but I wanted to know how much the recipe depended on "bad" ingredients and how much it derived from "better" ingredients like leeks, thyme, and milk. Apparently, it depends quite a lot on the bad ingredients! Like another reviewer, I also needed to reheat for 30+ mins at the 350F temperature.

My guests raved over this dish and I loved it as well. Hat's off to the reviewer who suggested this with the mustard/garlic/herb encrusted beef tenderloin! A perfect combination. Fabulous recipe from a pre-prep perspective. Great for a host who wants to spend time with their guests instead of getting stuck in the kitchen. Pull the dish from the fridge, pop it in the oven and go back to the cocktails and hors d' oeurves with your family and/or friends!

I've made this recipe several times since I first discovered it and it is always a hit. The leek taste was a bit strong so next time I think I would use 4 instead of 6, but my guests loved it, and requested seconds. I served it with the Herb and Mustard Crusted Beef Tenderloin from this site, and they went together perfectly.

I made this dish for Thanksgivung last year and I substituted zero fat "smart milk" and chicken broth for the milk and heavy cream to cut down on the fat and it tasted great. I'm preparing it again this year.

WOW!! I hesitate to serve mashed potatoes for company because they are best prepared at the last minute. But this is a great dinner party dish since it can be made ahead of time. Try it!!

Oh My...if you want to make everyone happy, these are the potatoes to do the job. I served them for Thanksgiving and they pleased every palate!(2 yr. olds to 65 yr. olds) A definite keeper!

These potatoes have become one of my Thanksgiving traditions. I made them four years ago, and, due to heavy demand and a threatened mutiny if they were not included in the menu, every year since. They are delicious and actually make the holiday less hectic since you make them ahead of time.

Fantastic! I highly recommend this recipe. We made it for Easter dinner, and had it with Currant-Mustard Glazed Ham (also found on epicurious.com), along with several other sides and an orange butter cake for dessert. We recommend a fruity merlot with this meal. We will definitely make this recipe again!

I've made this dish for Thanksgiving and now for Easter dinner with ham. They were absolutely delious both times. They went very well with the turkey and the ham. I will be using them a lot in the future.

Outstanding, rich mashed potatoes.Seems like a lot of leeks, but they just melt in. Everyone loved these. And the best thing is they're make ahead. One note: it takes more like 30+ minutes to reheat at the 350 temp.

This dish was absolutely delicious!!! I was cooking for a party of 25 and the two bowls of it were all devoured in a matter of minutes!

Made this once to try for Thanksgiving, making it again for the company potluck and then again for Family Thanksgiving. It's easy, and can be popped in the oven once the turkey comes out!! Friends raved over it.

This is the best mashed potatoes recipe I've made. The leeks complement the potatoes, adding the "je ne sais quoi", the thyme gives the fragrance. And all the dairy gives it no-apologies richness. All the while, it feels like a classic dish that will not overpower main course. Also very good re-heated.

I agree - it almost gets four forks! I'd like to try it with rosemary vs. thyme since I love rosemary with potatos.

Almost worth the 4-fork rating.
