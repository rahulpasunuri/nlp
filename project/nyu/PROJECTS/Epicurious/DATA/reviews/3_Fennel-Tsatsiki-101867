If you have an instinct to saute or roast or grill the fennel bulb before adding it to the yogurt, obey that instinct. Otherwise, it's a crunchy, fibrous mess. Flavors are cool though. Next time I might just use fronds & double the fennel seed.

Go ahead, be wild. Add a thinly sliced white onion.

This was a nice sauce that went well with the halibut. Some people preferred the fish plain, and some loaded on the sauce. This recipe makes a lot of sauce, by the way.

I served this scrumptious sauce with poached salmon - very yummy...However, I decided the next time I make it, I'll omit most of the fennel fronds. I only used about 1/4 of the fronds and it was too much. I think a little will go a long way. The taste was fabulous, very fresh and appealing. I'll be trying this with tilapia and mahi-mahi.
