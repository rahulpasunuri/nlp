This was terrific! Couldn't imagine the other reviewers weren't exaggerating about what a hit it was. But so true! I did the onions just as the recipe called for -- delicious! Put them on top of the brie in a bread bowl that I had brushed all over with garlic butter. Hollowed out the lid and the bowl and used those pieces (cubed & baked with the bowl) for dipping. Baked on foil and a cookie sheet for 30 mminutes at 350. Only crumbs were left!

I've made this so many times that I have started to try variations. Its not the prettiest dish because of the dark brown of the onions, so I topped that with lightly toasted shaved almonds. It adds a nice texture too. Also, I have used 2 wheels of brie and put the layer of onions between them. for the top I tried a thin layer of fig confit, again followed by toasted shaved almonds. That was really good, and attractive too. People literally DO stand around the platter til its gone!

I use the basic recipe and made individual baked brie in wonton "cups". place square wonton wrapper in mini muffin pans that have been sprayed with oil. put in cheese and top with onion mix. I also use wrappers for mini quiches, or fill with a mix of spinach, grated swiss, and egg. There are lots of variations. People are really impressed and it's easy and freezes well. Anyone else do this?

To the Cook from Norfolk, MA - seriously, you couldn't figure this out? Take the brie/onion out of the box, put on a platter and surround with baguette slices. Pretty simple. Oh, then take a serving knife, top a small amount of the brie/onion mixture on a slice of baguette, open your mouth and pop it in - enjoy! A wonderful recipe BTW.

Excellent recipe and very simple. I did the onions ahead of time and decreased the amounts because my brie was smaller. I also used a brie baker dish instead of the box. While it doesn't look very appetizing, the taste is really nice. All of my guests loved it.

This is easy and excellent. I poured a bit of maple syrup over the Brie before I added the onion mixture which added a nice flavor. I also cut the cooking time in half as the Brie did not come in a wooden box to hold it up. It was soft and creamy but did not spill out over the plate.

Outstanding recipe. I've made it several times - when you do the onions ahead of time the assembly is very easy. My changes that have been popular...I omit the thyme, spread a thin layer of fig spread before adding the onion mixture and then top with toasted almonds.

I made this recipe Christmas Eve, subbing Camembert for the Brie. What a big hit! Out of everything made that night this was the one dish my boyfriend kept bringing up, well after the party. I agree with other reviewers that this dish does not have the "prettiest" presentation, but it tastes so good that really nobody cared. Tasty! I will definitely be making this for years to come.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times over the last few years and I continue to get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. The carmelized onions/garlic are awesome with the brie. Rather than cook it in the wooden container or wrap in pastry, I usually hollow out a bread boule and use the left over bread for dipping along with crackers. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes as the recipe suggests. Fantastic presentation.

Rating: 0
A Christmas eve staple for 12 years and counting! Everyone who tries this swoons with the first bite!! Don't change a thing in the recipe, make sure you cook the onions down slow and long enough for great carmelization. You can't hurry perfection!! I use the wooden container, but I place that inside a pottery pie plate. Beautiful presentation.

Rating: 4
For longer presentations, use two small 6" wheels of brie and heat the second later in the party. It keeps the dish fresh and enjoyable. I also use a quiche pan or similar dish to encase the cheese without the wooden box.

I have made this recipe many times and it is always great. I have decided that when serving it for large parties that I cater I serve the brie 'en croute'. Buy a circle of pasty dough, cut away extra, wrap the brie in the dough (I leave the brie intact), prick all over with fork, use extra dough to make leaf cutouts, bake in oven for 25 min at 350 deg. I serve with onion confit or appricot preserves on the side so it isn't too messy. Once baked in the pastry dough it stands up very nicely.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe several times for company and it is truly delicious. Here are my suggestions. Sieve 1/3 cup of heated apricot jam or preserves and spread that over the top. Spread some sliced almonds over the jam. DON'T leave out the thyme. Staple the wooden sides of the box where the wooden strips overlap because the sides tend to give way when the cheese starts to melt.

I served this dish at a party on the 26th of December. I made a large batch of caramelized onions for Christmas dinner using a very similar technique. I simply added thyme to the pre-made mixture. While the flavor of this dish was good, people enjoyed it and some even asked for a recipe, I'm not sure that I would make it again. The appearance suffered immensely after just a few people took a portion of the cheese. Presentation is important to me and this dish failed in that area.

Carmelized onions were great on the brie. I also added almonds and crumpled gorgonzola on top before baking. It was a hit, although the gorgonzola melted into like a crust on top-not exactly the result I hoped for.

Everyone's ideas were great. I, too, used puff pastry after slicing the small brie in half. After sautéeing the two large-diced onions to a golden brown, I used a marsala wine and skipped the sugar. I also used the apricot preserves, but I'm not sure it was necessary or even noticeable. I'll make it again and again.

Rating: 3
A very tasty appetizer. I followed the directions of other cooks and used a puff pastry because I couldn't find a wooden box. I think that the pastry tasted great and was an excellent, easy addition to the dish. I used a layer of apricot jam underneath the onions, which was delicious. I also used red wine instead of white, because that is what I had. Even with all the little tweaks, it still turned out great and received great reviews!

Rating: 3
Terrific! I made a cream cheese, butter, flour pastry for the brie, since I could not find any wooden boxed cheese. It helped the appetizer stay together and look great for the short time it stayed on the buffet. Guests found this truly decadent. Also, I followed previous reviewers' comments about freezing the brie prior to cutting in half. Much easier to slice! I used half the onions in the middle then covered the top with the other half. I encrusted it all in pastry. Highly recommend this one!!

I recently made this for a large crowd and they loved it. I replaced the white wine with sherry which added a nice rich flavor.

I have made this recipe several times now. Always to repeated requests to make it for every one of our cocktail parties! I find that making it 'en croute' makes it visually very elegant. I usually use two small wheels as one is never enough! I don't even bother cutting the top of the brie either. I just arrange the carmelized onions on top and envelope the entire thing in puffed pastry. Last time I made this, I made one with onions and one with a wild mushroom saute deglazed with sherry. My guests loved both, but a lot preferred the mushroom mixture, though i enjoy the onions more. I just pulled out the recipe again as the holiday season is almost upon us.

Rating: 4
This recipe was incredible - easy to make, elegant, and very very yummy! I caramelized the onions two days ahead of time and used a small round of brie since there were only four of us. We had the brie with slices of bread which we toased on a skillet and rubbed with a clove of garlic. Our friends were so impressed and enjoyed it so much that they said who needs dinner and they'll never go back to unbaked brie again! By the way, went perfectly with Merlot.

Made this en croute because the brie didn't come in a wooden box. I did it this weekend as a trial for Easter and it was very well received. Hubby has already requested it again, sometime this week. He can't wait till next Sunday.

I put the round of brie in the freezer for an hour or so to make it easier to work with. Then cut the brie in half horizontally, topped the bottom with the carmelized onions, put the brie top back on, wrapped it all in a well rolled out (unfrozen) sheet of puff pastry, and baked according to pastry package directions. Fantastic. Am craving it right now.

This was a hit at a recent cocktail party I hosted. I made a few adjustments based on previous reviews and was very pleased. First, I used the smaller, standard size boxed brie (14 guests didn't need that big wheel). I cut the rind off the top and then cut it in half for the extra layer in the middle. I cut the onions into manageable pieces as they cooked - used the spatula. I also added toasted almonds along with onions to both the middle layer and the top. This is now my favorite brie dish!

This went over extremely well, but it is just TOO huge! The next time I make it, I will make only an 8 oz. portion...2 lbs of cheese is an awful lot!! I did make the change recommended by an earlier critic- I wrapped the brie in puff pastry before baking. Next time, as I said, I will downsize the amount of cheese, but I will keep the amount of onion mixture the same. I would probably make it a three-layer deal, instead of a 2 layer appetizer. It would be nice to have onion flowing throughout. Your friends will love this dish. By the way, the puff pastry did keep the cheese from melting everywhere, and it looked quite nice.

This recipe is very tasty. However, it is not visually appealing (as noted by my husband), which is probably why it did not get gobbled up. Next time I will freeze the brie for 30 minutes, cut the wheel in half, and bake the onions BETWEEN the layers (and sprinkle nuts on top). Another elegant option would be to bake it 'en croute', enveloped in puff pastry.

This is one of the best Epicurious recipes I have tried. Sure, everyone likes melted cheese, but the combination of the cheese with the onions is simply excellent. I have never had any left when serving it. Even health freaks had seconds, and my boyfriend alone finished 1/3 of a pound of brie, melted.

I make this every year at our pre-Thanksgiving Day party (the Friday before the real day) and there is always a crowd around the table to get at "it". I have found it harder and harder to find the brie in the wood box as the years have gone by, but this year, my new French butcher in our neighborhood has a 12 inch brie he carries, and I know my friends will devour the larger size in no time at all! I use Vidalia onions and I can't recommend this recipe enough, I promise your friends will love you!

This is a great recipe that everyone raved about and it was very simple. Normally when you serve baked brie it looks like the same old thing so I put the 8 in brie round into an 8 inch souffle dish and put the onions on the top, so it baked like a gratin. Also, adding 1 Tbsp of brandy to the sauted onions is a nice twist.

Because I couldn't find an eight inch diameter brie wheel I used two 4 inch ones. Then I had to dust off my decades old geometry book and found that the surface area for the two 4" bries was about the same as half of the one 8" brie. So, I halved the recipe and had the perfect amount of caramelized onions for the tops. Everyone raved and fought over the two little rounds. Don't let the 3 forks scare you off. This is a recipe I highly recommend.

I baked the brie in a sourdough round, as suggested, and it came out great - like a fondue. I made the mistake of using Gevurstraminer wine instead of just a plain Chardonnay and it threw the flavor off - too sweet with the carmelized onions.

Thanks so much to all who posted their modifications and suggestions. That is what makes this site so great to use! I followed someone else's lead and peeled the brie completely and baked it in a hollowed round of sourdough bread. It was fantastic, rich and so delicious. Next time I might brush the inside of the bread with pesto, or for the winter holidays I would coat the inside with a layer of cranberry sauce.

This is my second time with this recipe. It is becoming a favorite. This time around I spotted a brie with a hole in the middle at Trader Joe's. I made the recipe the usual way, but put the onions in the middle so people could scoop as much or as little onions as they wish to have. One caveat if you go this route. When the brie warmed the middle caved in. So next time I am going to reinforce the center with a circle of foil or something like maybe a ramican. Everyone has loved it thus far. For leftovers, I made the most delicious brie/carmelized onions quesadilla.

I added a thin layer of apricot jam under the onions which was excellent. Also, after reading the previous reviews (THANK YOU ALL) I stapled the box bottom at the seam (be careful or it will split)and also the lid, and doubled them up for a base in the oven, hoping it would stay intact when the glue warmed; worked really well. To Cook from Toronto....if you use cheap cheese, you get what you pay for. many of us choose to "sacrifice" a really good brie to the oven. Warmed brie is so good...we just expect it to be eaten soon. Pick a different, more appropriate recipe for long open houses...the fact that this recipe doesn't hold for hours does not make it bad...and leftover brie is wonderful in sandwches, on crackers and lots of other ways.

Ummm good. I wanted to find a 16 oz wheel of brie with a wooden box, but couldn't. So I baked an 8 oz wheel.
