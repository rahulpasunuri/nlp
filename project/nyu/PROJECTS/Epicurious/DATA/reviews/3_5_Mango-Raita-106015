I took this to a party where there was another version of Raita and this one got the raves. Delicious!

Delicious and refreshing. I served it as an accompaniment to grilled pork. Definitely a keeper!

A friend made this recently and it was amazing. I'm a big indian cook and will definitely add this to my menu.
