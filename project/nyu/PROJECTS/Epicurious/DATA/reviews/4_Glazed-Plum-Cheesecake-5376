One review in eleven years?!!! This was really really good - a light and somewhat delicate cheesecake. I had plums and was giving a party, and decided to try this. This was a real hit, and some of the guests were serious foodies. Two changes: used low-fat sour cream (because I had it on hand), and couldn't find red current jelly at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods, so ended up using chokecherry jelly (it's a local thing in northern New Mexico) - tart, which I like.

Delicious!! The filling was surprisingly light--it melted in your mouth. I didn't use quite as much fresh ginger as the recipe called for and I substituted a gingersnap (cookie) crust for the traditional graham crackers.
