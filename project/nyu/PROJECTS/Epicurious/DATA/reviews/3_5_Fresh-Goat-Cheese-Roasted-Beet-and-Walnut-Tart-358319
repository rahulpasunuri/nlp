Really yummy. Used pecans, as my SO has walnut allergy. No parsley in house, so added steamed kale- chopped, instead. Thought this made it more healthy, too. Might use an olive oil crust next time, so it feels less sinful.

This is a good start.....next time I think I will cut up the beets and roast them with thyme and/or some other spices. We thought 1 cup of walnuts was too much and that they weren't toasted enough. So next time, I will toast them separately and sprinkle them on top of the fully cooked tart. The basic flavors of this tart are wonderful!

With the exception of using refrigerated pie crust, I followed this recipe pretty closely. I used a "sweet" onion and caramelized it per other rater's notes. We all thought the tart had a funny sweetness about it, and although I won't be making this again, we thought that a regular onion might add the bite the tart needed. But all in all, it was just okay, and I just never make things so poorly rated by us again, not with so many other recipes to choose from! I had high hopes and was very disappointed. One of my guests said that even my less successful recipes are quite good and that this wasn't good at all, really. Ouch.

That is really good.

This was a time-stood-still-for-a-moment-with-the-first-bite dish. I don't like making pie crust, so I used refrigerated one. I also used 4 small beets and 4 eggs. I also used Vidalia onion for extra sweetness and carmelized it before adding sliced beets then the wine. Fabulous recipe.

My sister made this for me and I have to say I'm addicted. It is a time consuming recipe, but sooo worth it in my opion. I love beets and goat cheese, however even if these aren't on you list of "love to eats" I still think it's worth the try!

This was really good....but not the best thing I ever made. I made it exactly as the recipe said (which is rare for most people that review recipes on this site). It's a good recipe to try and I would probably make it again. It is pretty time consuming given the fact that you need to make the crust, roast the beets, saute the onions etc.
