I tried this without whipped cream. It is very sweet - the cream certainly helps. I threw some in the blender wwith some half and half, and voila! A yummy coffee frappe! I will experiment with proportions and adding chocloate syrup to the frappe or adding cocoa powder to the granita to get a mocha granita.
