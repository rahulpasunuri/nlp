This is such a great and easy recipe. It won't blow your dinner crowd away, but it is so easy. I found this dish to be very versatile in the sense of customization. I've served it with pasta, garlic bread, I've use boneless chicken breasts and tinkered with the recipe by adding spice and other italian flavors. You can even 'bolognese' the sauce by throwing it chopped carrots and celery.

When I first made this, I tasted the sauce at the end of cooking and found it to be almost inedibly salty, I think thanks to the prosciutto. I rescued it by adding a bit of sugar and some half-and-half and sour cream, and it tasted pretty good over the chicken. But the reason I give this dish 4 stars is that the next day I made spaghetti with some of the leftover sauce and chicken, shredded, and it was fantastic! I added some greek yogurt and a dash of olive oil, plus some of the pasta cooking water and lot of grated parmesan and the resulting sauce was creamy, flavorful, and delicious. If I were to make this dish again, I would skip the original presentation and go straight to the pasta.

This was fantastic, and worth the effort. I took the skin off leg quarters and thighs and browned them first. I also used chorizo (that's what I had). The sauce was a little thin, so next time I'll thicken it a bit. Meat fell off the bone, and we didn't miss the skin. This is a keeper.

Rating: 3
I made this today, and it was delicious. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts were on sale, so it's what I had. I didn't take into account that there weren't bones, so if you use boneless breasts, be sure to reduce the cooking time in the oven. I cooked them for the 20 minutes, and they were too dry. I should have been smarter than that, but next time, if I do it, I'll cut it back to 10, then check, then add a few more minutes. I think it would be tastiest with the bones, but it worked this way too.

Great flavors, simple preparation, and it tastes even better the next day!.

This was super tasty, the chicken came out moist and falling of the bone. The sauce is so delicious that I really wished that I would have gotten the ciabatta bread to mop up the sauce like the recipe calls for. I made this for two people so I only used thigh and drumsticks. I had to keep it in the oven a little longer than 20 min, perhaps 30 min. I think this was probably because when I browned the chicken I had the skin down so there was no direct contact for the meat to the pan. Very yummy!

one more thing: The sauce is delicious. Next time, I will double it for the same quantity of chicken. You might consider the same. :)

Rating: 3
This recipe serves as a great base recipe. I'm sure it's very good as written, but it's also basic enough to alter without fear. I used bacon instead of prosciutto -- it's what I had -- but I chopped it, cooked it, removed it and most of the fat from the pan then browned the chicken. I added the bacon back in at the end. Also, I used half thyme and half rosemary -- again, it's what I had. Diced tomatoes. I did have to add a little slurry made of flour and the sauce to thicken it, probably because of the diced tomatoes sub. Finally, I used a dry riesling for the white wine, which I thought was delicious. Have fun playing around!

Rating: 3
Played around a bit with quantities as I made this with only two chicken breasts, and added a bit more puree after cooking in the oven to help thicken the sauce. I also added sliced mushrooms and onions to the sauce, which I fried along with the prosciutto/garlic, and served it on fusilli pasta. It was very tasty and the chicken turned out tender and moist.

I fail to see what all the hub bub is about. Lots of tending to it and it wasn't that great.

I'm surprised someone had a bad experience with this. I followed the recipe, except I used only boneless chicken breasts and I had the deli cut 6 thin slices of prosciutto vs. the chunks so I could reduce costs. I had read many of the reviewers comments about the sauce not reducing, so once I put the dish back onto the stovetop and removed the chicken, I added about 1.5 cups of pasta that I knew I was going to serve with the meal anyway. It cooked the pasta while thickening the sauce. Once the pasta was al dente, I stirred the chicken back into the dish for 1 minute to warm up, added parmesan and it was delicious!

I made this recipe exactly and the chicken was horribly dry and salty. The sauce never reduced. Overall, it was very disappointing and expensive.

Just made this tonight-had the recipe printed for a couple of years, but finally got around to making it. It is OUTSTANDING! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, browned them then tossed the whole thing in the oven for 15 minutes. Followed the recipe as directed and reduced it down without a problem. I served it over fried polenta, garnished with a lovely sprig of fresh rosemary and had plenty of sangiovese and crusty bread to augment it. This is defintely a keeper. Next time I will make a double batch so there will be enough for another night!

Yum! I added a leak and sliced mushrooms as they were in the fridge and needed to be used, and I had a bit less than a cup of both the wine and broth. also I didn't have an oven safe pot, so I did everything in a skillet then transferred to a pyrex for the oven. oh - and I only used boneless skinless chicken breasts. served alongside mashed potatoes, sorta mixed it all together on the plate. very tasty!

Outstanding. Even my steak loving husband gave it a 4 star. My only change was to thicken the sauce before serving.

I used the recipe as a guideline and really didn't pay attention to the amounts. Instead of using the tomatoes in the recipe I used 3 large spoon full of left over homemade tomatoe sauce. I used a table spoon of capers to give it a lift. I served this dish with some thickly cut crusty bread. It was very good. I'll make it again. As a variation next time, I might use some grouper (medium thickness), instead of the chicken.

This recipe was just okay. I think partially it was my fault. When I sauteed the chicken it didn't brown because I think two tablespoons was too much. I would not make this again.

Okay, I tackled this dish for the second time, for a crowd of 8. I cooked it in my huge Mauviel roasting pan, so I could go from stovetop to oven, with just some foil on top for the roasting portion. I used 8 chicken breasts and 4 chicken leg quarters, a whole head of garlic, about 6 tablespoons of fresh chopped rosemary, 2 cups of white wine, and two cups of chicken broth, and a large can of good Italian crushed tomatoes. My comments are: brown the chicken really well - it adds to the taste and final presentation. Be careful that you don't burn the garlic - I turned the heat down quite low and browned the garlic with the proscuitto and rosemary very gently, before adding the liquids. Cook at a higher temp than the recipe: I cooked at 375 for an hour and a half. The meat stayed juicy and practically fell off the bone. I didn't bother reducing the sauce - just spooned it over the chicken and some orzo. Some roasted asparagus on the side made for a great meal. Really really delicious - my guests didn't leave a smear on their plates, and asked for seconds. This was great for an Italian-flavoured summer feast, and I could cook it a day ahead, and reheat in the oven. Highly recommended recipe.

This was good, but I made the mistake of burning the garlic, and then the sauce ended up infused with that taste. I'll try again though.

We LOVED this dish, very rich and hearty. I didn't have prosciutto so I used 4 strips of bacon, diced. Also I used a homemade marinara instead of the crushed tomatoes, same amount as recipe called for. Other reviewers complained of the sauce not being thick enough so I kind of 'felt' it as I was adding the liquids. I used 3/4 c. each of the white wine and chicken stock instead of the amount the recipe called for and found the sauce the PERFECT consistency. Also added a touch of onion when I added the garlic, as I can't cook without it. I'd entertain with this dish and will definately be making it again.

Rating: 4
The family loved it. I doubled the recipe and used diced canned tomatoes, only slightly pureed the tomatoes. It was great!

Perhaps because I didn't have proscuitto and had to sub pancetta, this recipe was so greasy that the sauce was inedible. I used a little of the sauce to flavor the white bean paste I made to accompany it and used a slotted spoon to get the chicken out and it tasted fine-- not great, even without the oil.

This was delicious - my boyfriend said it was "restaurant quality." I just used boneless, skinless chicken thigh meat for the two of us, and it was excellent.

The sauce was absolutely delicious! My sauce didn't thicken-I simmered for at least 15mins and gave up, but the flavor was still awesome. Next time I may try boneless thighs and/or boneless breasts. I will also try with kale crostini(as in another review)-as that would provide the green and the bread for soaking up the delicious sauce.

Ohhhh myyyyy goodnessss! Where do I go to submit not just a review, but a menu suggestion!? I'm not the exciteable type, but damn! This was awesome!

I added a chopped shallot because I had one begging to be used, and I think it was a lovely addition. DO NOT be a timesaver and use pre-chopped bottled garlic!

Based on the Cook from Minneapolis' advice, I decided to leave the sauce separate, and then had a miscommunication with my husband (happens when the guests are ill, the two-year-old hyper, and the neighbours in need) so he threw 1.5 cups of basmati rice and 3 cups of water into the pan with the sauce. It turned into a lovely paella-sort of dish in about 20 minutes, and I spooned the chicken on top and served it all on one platter. A big hit. Served eight of us quite nicely with a large salad and some asparagus on the side.

I've made this several times, and it's delicious. I love salty food, and have never added salt to the sauce b/c the prosciutto adds it all!

This is a smashing dish -- as someone else remarked, if you prepare it exactly as directed (especially, use prosciutto! not bacon) then it yields a beautifully balanced set of flavors. I have made it repeatedly and it never fails to win raves from guests. Nice leaned against a small pile of orzo, with a sauteed bit of something dark green (broccoli rabe, kale, whatever).

Rating: 3
I was one of the 1st to review this recipe, and have made it many times since, and offer the following. I've made it with and without the prosciutto. The difference is subtle, but worth it if you have prosciutto on hand. I follow the recipe (using less olive oil) until the point of putting the sauce and chicken together. I find that the chicken becomes too stewed and the sauce not thick enough. So, I continue to reduce and thicken the sauce on the cooktop, roast the chicken separately, then add both together for the last 10 minutes of baking. Hope this helps.

This recipe is ridiculously similar to Jeff Smith's (The Frugal Gourmet)Chicken with Rosemary. Anyway, when you combine pork fat, wine and rosemary you can't go wrong. I would, however like to respond (unsolicited though it may be) to a few of the other comments about this dish. To neems from Swarthmore, PA: Your modifications to this simple (it's MEANT to be simple) dish didn't resemble the original recipe except for the rosemary and chicken. What made you think anyone would be interested in knowing ALL that. To grace_33 from Boston, MA: the cooking time in the receipe totals about 45 minutes, plus carry over cooking after browning. You must have missed a few key sentences/words. Were you drinking the wine or cooking with it? Thank you.

The weather was too hot to turn on the oven, so I used only chicken thighs and cooked the dish to completion on the cooktop. I added some sliced mushrooms which my family likes. This was a good dish (and simple to prepare), but I'm not in a rush to make it again.

I followed this recipe to the letter, with the exception that I used all dark meat. The chicken was nowhere near done after 30 minutes in a 325 degree oven, the time the recipe states for the thighs and legs to be cooked through. Did no one else have this problem?

This was rustic Tuscan cooking at its best! I had something similar in Sienna last year. Served this in pasta bowls over polenta with crusty bread to soak up the juice. I used bacon since I did not have prosciutto on hand and this was mid-week fare. I sauteed the bacon first and poured off the extra fat. It is good enough for casual entertaining for "foody" types.

I'm relatively new to this website, and I would just like to say thanks to all the people who take the time to add their comments. It's so helpful! I made a few changes to the recipe (like using bacon) based on what people said and it came out absolutely terrific. This recipe is now in our list of favorites!

This was deliscious. Based on other review, I made a few modifications. I used 4 boneless breasts and 8 chicken legs. I also used Niman Ranch bacon instead of the prosciutto because I had it in the house. I cooked the bacon first, poured off most of the fat and then cooked the chicken breasts. I removed the breasts and browned the legs. I removed the legs and added a sliced onion, the garlic, rosemary, and sliced mushrooms, sauteed them for awhile and then added a whole can of crushed tomatoes and 1 cup broth. I added the legs back in and cooked in the oven for 30 min. When it was done, I put all the chicken in the fridge and cooked the sauce on low for 2 hours. I added 2 T tomato paste and an 8oz can of tomato sauce. I added the chicken back in and warmed it for 30 min and served over angel hair (I would use a thicker pasta next time.) Guests gave it rave reviews. The bacon gave it a subtle, smoky flavor.

While looking for a use for my white wine and costco chicken breasts, I was lucky enough to happen upon this recipe. It is so easy, and delicious! The only thing I didn't have in my cupboard or fridge was prosciutto (I substituted bacon strips) and rosemary. I did break down and race to the store for the fresh rosemary. I served this with mashed potatoes. The sauce never got very thick, but it didn't matter, I just poured it all over our chicken and potatoes. It was so extremely delicious, my husband and I stuffed ourselves till our stomachs hurt! I just finished eating my leftovers for lunch at work. This is an amazing recipe for taste and nutritional value. I can't wait to make it again, preferably for friends so I can show it off.

I used thinly sliced proscuitto instead of cubes and it was saltier than I would have liked, probably b/c I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh as well. Overall the flavor was great. I made angel hair pasta to go along with it. I loved the sauce.

Had a ton of chicken thighs from Costco...this recipe was a terrific use for them. The sauce is to die for. I would recommend browning the prosciutto a little more than one minute, and using a big can of crushed tomatoes, which you can then reduce when boiling the sauce at the end.

I deleted the prosciutto from this recipe, used only boneless, skinless breasts, and added sliced mushrooms. I used an inexpensive Mondavi Sauvignon Blanc, which I also drank with the meal.

I've made this recipe a couple of times - wonderful. The only change I make is that I only use chicken thighs, which really simplies the cooking process. I've used prosciutto and bacon with equally good results. I serve it over skinny pasta or rice, depending on what I have on hand. Excellent!!!

I've made this recipe twice and though it had a really nice flavor. I was a little concerned that the garlic would be overpowering, but it wasn't at all. I'm not really sure if the prosciutto added much to the flavor. I also tried pancetta and got the same result. I think it would be just as tasty if you used regular bacon or if you left it out entirely. I used only chicken breasts, instead of thighs etc. Next time, I think I would double the sauce so as to have enough for leftovers. Yummy over pasta!

Serve this over a bed of Creamy Grits (Bon Appetit, July '99)and the rating goes up to a 4! Next time I'll follow the advice from other reviewers and use all thighs.

this was a very good dish even if i didn't make it exactly as written (as i usually do the first time trying something). based on notes from others (i do read the comments before trying a recipe and consider what each person had to offer) i did dredge the chicken in a bit of flour and a few grindings of pepper before sauteeing it. i omitted the chicken stock just because i didn't have any and i cut back the prosciutto to about 3 oz because we are not huge fans of salty flavors. it might be a bit tame for some but we thought it was very flavorful and will make it again--might even saute some mushrooms to go with it the next time. served with a salad of mixed baby spinach and greens tossed with herbed lemon vinaigrette and some garlic bruschetta, we had a great meal!

Anyone who knows anything about great gourmet food would certailnly agree that this is an excellent dish. It's simple and absolutely delicious.

This was really delicious. I made it for two people so I only used bone-in chicken breasts which cook fast, therefore I skipped the oven process and simply cooked it all the way through on the cooktop following the rest of the ingredients per the recipe. Eliminating the oven step made it fast and easy. This was really a subtle, yet satisfying dish -- definitely company fare. Next time I will serve it alongside a nice risotto and roasted vegetables as it needed more flavorful side dishes than I served it with. Highly recommended!

This recipe isn't a fast and simple dish but the results were very good. I served this dish over some pasta and it tasted excellent. I wonder if bacon can be used instead of prosciutto. Maybe fry the bacon first then set aside before adding it with the garlic and rosemary.

GREAT RECIPE! Here's what I did: I dredged the chicken (thighs and drumsticks only) in flour and black pepper, browned them, then removed the skin. (Based upon a technique I read about in Cook's Illustrated which provides flavor, but reduces fat.) Not having enough fresh rosemary from my, newly planted, herb garden and not willing to pay $3.50 per bunch at the local grocery store, I only used about 1 tablespoon. To compensate, I added some fresh, chiffonaded (is that a word?) basil at the very end. I served this over Saffron Orzo (Gourmet, March 1990), also featured on this web site. Absolutely great dish. As I said in my review of the orzo recipe, my harshest critic, my very honest and beloved husband, declared the combo company worthy. As a side, I served mixed baby greens, simply dressed. EASY mid-week meal, but I'd not hesitate to serve this to "company" company.

A beautiful yet easy dish for entertaining. I used about half the prosciutto, added some basil and shallot.

Delicious, simple and fairly quick to prepare. My advice is if you have the time, make it a day in advance and stick it in the fridge. The flavors just intensify and if you are entertaining the only thing left to do when your guests arrive is reheat on the stove to let the smells fill the kitchen. Add a salad and a nice crusty bread and you're set. Your guests (or family) will think you worked for hours!

My wife loved this one - I'll definitely make it again. Very good indeed, it has a lot in common with many Spanish dishes - and if you can get some good-ish jamón serrano instead of Italian prosciutto, so much the better as it has a lot more flavour. Next time I do it, I'm going to try putting the chicken under the broiler for a few minutes to get the skin more crunchy. Otherwise, I'll leave it exactly as it is.

This is a great winter dish to prepare the day before - and works well for casual company. The chicken falls off the bone and the sauce is quite complex in flavor. We are not big fans of dark meat...but in this recipe, even the drumsticks were scrumptios!

This dish was delicious with its dense and flavorful sauce clinging to the chicken pieces, and more subtle and sophisticated than its rather ordinary ingredients sounded. My only caveat would be to be sure & use low salt broth. Prosciutto is very salty and there is quite a lot of it in here. Too much salt can mask any of the more delicate flavors.

I've now made this dish about 10 times and think last night's was the best. I removed chicken skin and dusted with flour. You don't miss the inch of fat and the flour makes the reduced sauce much richer. I also cooked one large and thinly sliced onion with prosciutto. Added some dried basil and (this sounds wierd but was recommended by an italian friend) a pinch of allspice to sauce. Served on pasta it looked and tasted fantastic.

This is a good recipe, a bit on the salty side though. I like the basic idea, so next time I will make it with a few changes. Maybe a little bit of chopped up prociutto, basil instead of rosemary. The sauce is good, just too much prosciutto for my husband's taste. Easy to make during the week.

This was a good recipe. Next time, however, I will double the sauce and probable add some red pepper flakes. I had to leave when I started baking this dish and turned the temp down to 175 degrees and when I got back in an hour and a half, the chicken was still moist and tender.

This was awesome! I used 3-4 oz of prosciutto instead and it was a bit salty (which I loved, but others may not). I was very glad I didn't have the full 5 oz in it, though. Next time, I will really watch how I salt the chicken pieces (or avoid salting altogether). The sauce reduced beautifully, but it did take around 30 minutes (well worth the wait!). Fabulous recipe.

Delicious! My husband and I enjoyed it so much! It was pretty quiet at the dinner table last night, as we were concentrating very hard on eating. I cooked the chicken in the oven for almost an hour and used only thighs and drumsticks with a little more wine and tomatoes like another reviewer. I also spent at least 1/2 hour reducing the sauce, stirring frequently. Take the time. It's worth it.

This dish created a wonderful smeel in my kitchen! The chicken became tender as it cooked in the wine. I didn't have proscuitto and used bacon instead, which was kind of fat. I would definitely try this again with the right ingredients.

I agree with the previous reviewer and used only thighs and legs as the breasts will dry out!. I've made this twice for larger dinner parties (14 to 20 people)and each time it was received to great reviews. You will need to thicken the sauce with either tapioca or corn starch/water and I suggest making this dish the day before and reheating. I accomponied each dinner with the crab cakes from the same issue which also came out very nicely. We were not at all disappointed and will definately make again.

Rating: 4
Unlike the other reviewers, my sauce came out the right thickness. I boiled the sauce more than the recommended 5 minutes making it thicker to begin with. I also added more white wine and crushed tomato than recommended (which probably is what made the sauce thicker). I cooked the chicken in the oven for 50 mins instead of 30 mins and then reheated it later for 10 mins. The chicken was so tender that the meat fell right off the bone. Of course, I only used thigh and legs as breasts tend to dry out with extended cooking. I also did not have prosciutto on hand so used bacon instead for the flavor. For me, this was one of the most delicious dishes ever.

I rate this recipe 3 forks because there are, in fact, no provisions for thickening the sauce. Any cook with half a brain can deal easily with thickening a sauce using either arrowroot or a good old fashioned flour & cold water mixture. My family prefers more prosciutto & less chix bones, so I used 1.5 cups prosciutto & 4-5 boneless/skinless chix breasts. We were pleased with the results; very nice.

Had great taste, although sauce didn't thicken like it was supposed to. We really liked the rosemary & proscuitto combination. Was very easy to prepare; nice autumn dish.

Nothing special. Too many good chicken recipes out there, I don't think I would make this again.

This is a great company dish. Make it ahead and forget about it. I added some crushed red pepper to give it a little kick and an extra pack of chicken breasts (boneless/skinless). It went great with the poached pear recipe in the same article.

I made this recipe as is, as I usually do with something the first time. The flavor was OK, but I guess I expected more, given the incredients. The sauce didn't thicken up as I had hoped.
