Made it again...in ramekins, with hot butterscotch and ice cream. It went fast. Make sure you get extra fine cornmeal....better texture for pudding.

This recipe was closest to my Mom's. Like the other reviewers I substantially increased the seasonings (2 TBSP Ginger, 2 TBSP Cinnamon, 1 TBSP Vanilla Bean Paste, 1 TBSP Maple Syrup, Dark rather than Light Molasses 1/2 Cup Raisins) to get the gingerbread like flavor I remember. I served it with Cream Cheese Ice Cream and Butterscotch Sauce from the Pecan, Bourbon and Butterscotch Bread Pudding Recipes on this site. I made 1 serving in a ramekin and will make them all that way next time as the cookie-like crust was delish! A total hit!

Good, simple comfort food, really satisfied my sweet tooth. I doubled the molasses, ginger and cinnamon. Yes, it did take forever to thicken (more than 15 min) and much longer to bake in the oven (2 hours?) I had never heard of Indian Pudding before, so I don't know what it is supposed to taste like, but it was so good, I kept going back for more! The edges were the best part, so maybe it would be even better served in individual ramekins.

I used dairy-free margarine instead of unsalted butter and full fat soymilk instead of whole cow's milk in this recipe for an animal-free/vegan version. I also added about 1/2 C. of raisins. Spooned a little vanilla soy ice cream over the top and it was fantastic!

I was quite disappointed with this recipe...I felt it was quite anemic, with very little flavor. I agree with the cook from Seattle...if you make it, at least double the amount of ginger and molasses. The pudding did have a nice texture; it just desperately needs pizzazz.

This is superb, the Indian Pudding of my New England childhood. I've made it for Thanksgiving, and for dessert after an Indian meal. One supporting note: as you whisk the ingredients in the saucepan, it will seem too liquidy for too long, but it does thicken eventually and bakes up beautifully.

I was so pleased to find a recipe for this childhood comfort-food favorite of mine. I've made it four times in 3 weeks! This is an excellent rendition as is, but is improved, in my opinion, by a few easy modifications. Unless you're looking for something more subtle and delicate, definitely increase, up to double, the amount of ginger and molasses. I also added a lightly beaten egg with the vanilla and butter, and that worked well to give it a little extra body. This dish begs for a high-quality vanilla ice cream accompaniment and I have been happy with either Dreyer's (Edy's on the East Coast) "HomeMade" Vanilla, or Breyer's French Vanilla.

This is the perfect treat for a cold fall night!

Being a 'transplanted' New Englander, I had been longing for some of the Yankee dishes I grew up with. We've been invited out for Thanksgiving dinner, and we thought we'd make something 'New England-y' for variety. This recipe is delicious...easy and inexpensive to make. We made a 'sample' recipe for us to taste, and we devoured it! Yum!!!

As a New Englander I am fond of Indian pudding; I generally include raisins. This recipe is considerably less involved than our family recipe, which requires hours of baking time in a low oven. Excellent quality!
