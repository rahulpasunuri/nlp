Beautiful presentation for any kind of frittata. 2 forks due to the tarragon - it totally overpowered the dish. Other reviewers said not to skimp, but I didn't go overboard either - couldn't taste the shiitake :(. In the future I would use another herb that is more subtle. I doubled the recipe; after scrambling, poured everything into an oiled half-sheet pan and baked about 8 min at 375, turned the broiler on for 2 min. Came out in one piece with no edges to waste, easily made 60 pieces.

This was both a quick and easy recipe. However, I served it as part of an entree and cut the frittata into three sections and using another reviwer's tip, blanched green onions (not chives) and wrapped one across the top of each section length wise, just off center. The presentation was elegant and no fuss. I also omitted the prosciutto and used the tarragon as a garnish, which made for a lovely addition to the presentation.

I had a very difficult time with these. The frittata stuck to the pan and parts of it broke apart when I took it out. It looked like a small amount also. The taste was good but I spent a great deal of time and pretty much gave up.

really good, and not nearly as hard to make attractive as I thought. lesson; if you blanch your chives for just 20 seconds or so in boiling water then transfer immediately to an ice bath & towel dry, you will find them more pliable and easier to work with

Very good and unique presentation. A fussy recipe with the chives and you're at the mercy of what size chives the store has. I ended up using a couple of reviewer tips. I made half the recipe, cooked the mushrooms and shallots, added the eggs until almost set. Then transferred them to a small loaf pan and padded them down, put under the broiler for a couple of minutes and they wer perfect. I did this several hours ahead and refrigerated. So easy to cut and no trimming. I wrapped each rectangle with the proscuitto and then wrapped 2 chives around all sides and placed a toothpick in the middle to hold the chives in place. My chives were short and there was no way to tie them. I don't think the flavor was a real WOW but a little more parmesan tarrgon and shallots might to the trick.

I found these a bit difficult to make. The proscuitto I had was too thin and didn't wrap well. They tasted OK, but I wouldn't make them again. They definitely didn't look as pretty as the picture.

I just made these for a brunch, and they were flavorful and made an elegant presentation. However, I'm not entirely sure I'll make them again, given the time involved. They weren't particularly hard (it didn't take too long to get the hang of tying the chives around the proscuitto) but it definitely took more than the estimate of one hour. I think there's probably a better "bang for the buck" out of other recipes.

Just made this for New Year's Eve -- easy to make (although the chives are a bit fiddly) and very good. We're planning to have at midnight with champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries. (BTW I'd be happy just making this as scrambled eggs for a very decadent breakfast.)

Great and easy. Go tarragon.

Very good, and so much easier than they look. I was making a double recipe, so once I'd scrambled the eggs/mushrooms, I put them into a sprayed small rectangular pan, cooked them over low heat for a couple of minutes to set the bottom and stuck them under the broiler. Let them cool, flipped them out of the pan, trimmed the edges as called for. I took these to a party and while they lasted I kept hearing people say, "Who made =these=?!" Definitely a keeper. Don't leave the tarragon out -- it makes the dish. My produce market only had 12 oz of shiitakes, so I subbed a few ounces of baby bellas and it worked out fine.

This looked and tasted great! I was concerned that the perfect look in the recipe would look ragged with my real world execution. I found that it was pretty easy to do; I used kitchen shears to trim up the edges and the result was great. Don't skimp on the tarragon.

Outstanding. I made these for a dinner party and was a bit concerned about the results, since I'd never made the recipe before. (I had some backup frozen appetizers as backup!) I was happily surprised at how very simple the recipe was, and I made it exactly as written. I wouldn't change a thing! The recipe seems a bit labor intensive, but it was actually very easy. The frittata itself was so delicious that I honestly had to restrain myself as I trimmed it into a square. I very nearly ended up with a much smaller square!!! My guests (rather finicky in general where food is concerned) raved, I was delighted, and I will make these every chance I get. The hardest part about the entire recipe was actually tying the chive without it breaking off, which is fairly easy once you've done a few. What a wonderful addition to my entertaining recipes!

Amazing! Very simple and has great flavor. All my guests were blown away. Great choice for a summer dinner outside.

I doubled this recipe for a party and it tripled the preparation time. But it was worth it. These very attractive appetizers pleased both the eyes and the tastebuds! The only thing I would change would be too add perhaps a dipping sauce of some kind - maybe a sour cream based herb sauce - as they were just a tad dry. I will definitely make these again.

Excellant! The thinner chives where easier to use than the fat ones.

Great flavour! I happened to have a handful of fresh asparagus on hand so I blanched them & cut into small pieces and put them in with the mushrooms just before adding the eggs - very happy with the result. I would not cut back on the prosciutto like another cook suggested simply because it adds so much to the flavour of this yummy tid bit. Hint: if you drop the chives into boiling water for only 3-4 seconds & immediately remove and plunge into cold water - they are sooooo much easier to work with !

I served this to my Daytime Gourmet group, and they loved the flavor and the lightness of this dish. I did not use the chives, but put a colored toothpick in each square. I only used about 5 slices of prosciutto, cut lengthwise in 3 narrow strips and then in half.

Used this for a wine tasting and was very pleased. the flavors were subtle and paired well with several wines. We will certainly make it again.

We "tested" these before a party we were having and thought they were wonderful! We love shittake and proscuitto and this suited us perfectly! They are quite filling, so you may want to cut the squares smaller, and also buy long chives (because tying them around the squares can be a challenge, especially after a few drinks!) or just sprinkle the chives over the top of each square (that solution worked just as well).
