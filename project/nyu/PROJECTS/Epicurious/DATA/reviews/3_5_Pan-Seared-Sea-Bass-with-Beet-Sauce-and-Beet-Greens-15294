This was so good! Yes, I made some changes. I used broth instead of water at the puree stage and dropped in a clove of garlic. I used garlic and lemon zest for the greens. Oh, almost forgot. I subbed hake for the sea bass. Cheaper and more enviro friendly, I think.

The beet sauce was initially overpowered by the soy. I let it simmer for a very long time and it mellowed, so the beet flavor came back. The dish is beautiful, sauce on the bottom, nice piece of fish in the middle and beet leaves on top. Im not sure I would do this again, however. I think there are just better sauces for fish. But this was good for a change of pace.

the beet sauce was different than we expected and quite lovely. YUM. I undercooked my beets a bit, even though they were in the oven for well over an hour. Must have been much larger than medium I guess!

I too thought the water sounded weird and this was before I read the reviews. I didn't use anything except the soy sauce and the balsamic and was more generous with these 2 ingredients. The fresh ground pepper really gave the sauce an elegant finish. My husband is not fond of fish nor does he like beets. This was a winner - he loved it. For a fish lover this was truly a treat!

I tried this recipe with some seared scallops instead of the fish. Excellent. I also made some pan roasted potatoes to give it some more texture. As for the sauce, started with the roasted beets, soy and balsamic and added chicken stock as I went. Kept tasting and tweaking until it was just right. Easy and highly recommended! With the scallops would make a great date-night dinner.

4 forks w/serious modifications... can't imagine how the writer of the recipe used a whole cup of water- definitely only 1/3 cup chix broth & added garlic as suggested, very good balsamic & soy. the sauce was superb & very flavorful. i was using very fresh small beets which probably helped. only used part of the bunch to make 1 lb beets & greens, but used greens from entire bunch. they cook down quite a bit. if you like veggies like me, esp with no starch side, then use more greens. delicious. no sea bass at the store, so used halibut. fine, but probably better with bass. it was (1) 1.5 lb pieceI cut down to 3 pieces. next time I will select smaller thinner filets, because the crispy/chewiness of the edge pieces was superb against the textures of the greens & smooth sauce. i like strong flavors, so I did use more ginger on the greens, and much more coriander on the fish, with a bit of fresh cilantro, too. a good simple recipe to work with & make your own.

I made this with fresh calico bass. Used the previous suggestions of 1/3 c. chicken stock instead of the 1 c. water, and a high quality balsamic vinegar. I didn't roast the beets with the garlic, so I just used 1 clove of crushed garlic. The flavor was fabulous. Hubby was thrilled and it was so good that we didn't need to have anything else for dinner with it. Would make it for company---the color is exquisite. I would pair it with a spinach pasta.

I made this as an amuse. I cut the fish down to 0.75 oz. pieces and served a bite-size piece of fish over the sauce with a single leaf of the beet greens on top . I did use chicken stock instead of water, and I added it a little at a time until I had the consistency I wanted, which was pretty light.

I made the beet sauce from this recipe to go with Horseradish-Crusted Salmon elsewhere on this site. Taking heed from other cooks who had thought this sauce runny and bland, I made the following modifications: I roasted the beets with four unpeeled (that's important) cloves of garlic. When the beets were cool enough to handle, I peeled and chopped them AND squeezed the roasted garlic out of its skin into the blender along with the beets. I added the soy sauce and very high quality balsamic vinegar (I think this makes a big difference too) as indicated, but only 1/3 cup water instead of a whole cup. WOW! No salt and pepper needed. I was fighting my husband out of the kitchen, who kept sticking a finger in the sauce and eating it. This was beautiful with couscous and horseradish crusted salmon, and a side of steamed spinach.

I used this recipe for the beet greens only and it was a perfect side dish along side a half split lobster basted with butter and lemon at 350 degrees for two 15 meinute segments with a baste of pan juices in between.

I made the beet sauce to serve with Horseradish-Crusted Salmon (BA 10/99) and inspite of substituting chicken broth for the water I found the sauce to be bland and a little runny.

My only change would be, is to use fish, vegetable or chicken stock instead of water for the sauce. It adds a dimension. Other than that it is a great light tasty dish. Thanks!
