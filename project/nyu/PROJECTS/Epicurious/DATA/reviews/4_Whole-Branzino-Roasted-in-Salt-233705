Easy and delicious. I'd never done a salt crust before, but would definitely do this again.

Fantastic...one of the best fish dishes I have ever had. Can't wait to make it again. Would definitely make this for company.

Easy-breezy and delicious! My kind of dish - easy enough for weeknights and beautiful enough for entertaining.

Outstanding!!! Terrific for entertaining because presentation is exceptional. Makes for light, tasty fresh fish, but not salty! I found it took far more egg whites than the recipe recommended (10 jumbo egg whites) but it came out wonderfully.

I have made this dish many times now and love it more each time! I have made it for a large group with a bigger fish and everyone raves. The salt crust is a spactacular presentation.
