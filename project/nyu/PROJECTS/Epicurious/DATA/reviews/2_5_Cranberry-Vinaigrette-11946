Family and guests loved this dressing which I served on salad made of leaf lettuce fresh from the garden, thinly sliced red onion and radishes. I do not agree with previous reviewers that the vinaigrette is oily. I followed the recipe exactly. It emulsified and came out beautifully, with a nice balance of flavors. Its a keeper.

I thought this would have a more pronounced flavor, it's really very mild. I used grapeseed oil instead of veg. oil. I headed the last reviewers advise and used only about a 1/4 of a cup and it was plenty. I think any more oil and you wouldn't be able to taste anything but oil.

I found this recipe too oily. I will try it again but with substantially less oil.
