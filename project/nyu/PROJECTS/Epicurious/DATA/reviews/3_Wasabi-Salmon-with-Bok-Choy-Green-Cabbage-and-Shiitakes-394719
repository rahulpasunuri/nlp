I thought this was really good. I did take other people's advice and add the soy sauce and lemon. With those adjustments, it was delicious.

Easy & tasty. I add a touch of low sodium soy sauce since many said is was bland and the lemon at the end as suggested helped as well. Will keep this one.

Excellent light fare! Agree with other reviewers, roast the veggies first for 8-10 minutes, then add the salmon later as it only needs 6-7 minutes. I recommend finishing the whole thing with the juice of half a lemon!

I used Copper River salmon, which was the best thing about this recipe - and the mayo. I think I would add more ginger to the mayo and maybe keep the skin on the salmon and make it crispy style. I chose to make this dish because it is very healthy and low carb.

This is good but not great. I will occasionally make this again. I used regular bok choy because I couldn't find baby bok and I added 1/2 cup of Kokoho rose rice to each plate so I wouldn't starve. I think it needs some carbs. I must confess I prepared the Wasabi & mayo part and then forgot to get it out of the fridge at dinner time. I do think it helps the dish as my leftovers were better with the wasabi.

I am making this for the second time since it was printed in the March Bon Appetit edition. I think that says a lot! Followed the recipe exactly as printed, except used regular sized bok choy, as I couldn't find baby sized. My whole family really enjoyed it. I didn't measure the veg exactly, so I may have had more than the recipe called for, because I had left-overs that I used in a lo mein the next day.

My family loved it and I made it exactly as written, except I couldn't find baby bok choy and had to go with the regular size and chopped it up. I did take some of the left-over veggies and make a lo mein with them the next day. I didn't measure those exactly, so maybe I made more than the recipe called for.

This is a great way to celebrate salmon! I agreed with a previous reviewer that the salmon doesn't need to be cooked for 15 minutes. So I put the veggies in first, and then the salmon for the last 11/12 minutes. I would definitely recommend squeezing lemon on veggies and salmon after pulling them out of the oven. The hit of acid just balances it all out. Really yummy!

My husband doesn't really like salmon much but he enjoyed the bok choy and the wasabi mayo. He ate his portion of salmon as a result...good thing! I am always trying to find ways that he will eat salmon since I love it. We both look forward to having this again soon! Very delicious.

Really excellent. I mixed straight wasabi powder into mayo with a squeeze of lemon and the sauce was great. Will make again!

his was an easy and tasty dinner. Loved the easy clean up.

Great, elegantly simple dish. I would agree with other reviewers that cooking everything for the same time overcooks the salmon so I'd recommend putting the salmon in for maybe 10 mins at the end.

Made this last night and we are still talking about it--simplicity at its best. Only substitution I made was using savoy cabbage. The blending of flavors is incredible. Not sure if preheating the pan is the key, but believe it helped. Had some bok choy, a few mushrooms, and cabbage left over so did a stir fry this morning and it was just as delicious.

I made this recipe for guests, and they loved it. It was easy, healthy and delicious. The nice thing is that it is a basic recipe - WYSIWYG. If you expect something a bit more flashy you will be disappointed. Given that fact, the ingredients tasted great, I love the random shiitakes, I really like the taste of cabbage and bok choy tossed with good olive oil and the salmon was cooked perfectly.

A good basic recipe, but I think it wants creative touches. The sauce seemed bland to me after melding, so I added a little seasoned rice vinegar to perk it up - 1 or 2 tsp - which worked well. I also plan to try substituting gari juice (the juice from Japanese pickled ginger) for the grated ginger (and the rice vinegar, if used). Make extra sauce, and use with the veg, too.

This is a great recipe to riff on...I added fennel and leeks because I needed to use them up. Added some more olive oil as a result, more ginger/garlic/sea salt...it came out well. I doubled up on the mayo and wasabi too, spread it on the fish before I put it in the oven. The only consequence was that I had to put all the veggies on to roast for 10 minutes before adding the fish on top of them. Gave the veggies a head start on cooking. Total cooking time was about 21 minutes. Everyone loved it.

Absolutely delicious and easy. I did substitute cauliflower for the cabbage and cooked it a bit before adding the bok choy and shitake mushrooms. I would also suggest checking after 10 minutes; I prefer salmon a bit on the undercooked side and 12 minutes was a bit too long.

Cooked vege's a bit first before adding salmon. Added a tsp. of sesame oil to the olive oil for vege's. My family really enjoyed it and we do a lot of salmon. Would certainly make again.

This was pretty good & easy to make, except that there was way too much cabbage, we were choking on it... Next time I will omit the cabbage entirely and make it with just the bok choy.

The vegies did not cook evenly and could not save the very bland salmon. The sauce was too heavy on the mayo and just too heavy period. It was very easy but disappointing.
