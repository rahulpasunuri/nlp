Very good. I followed the recipe except had to cut some of the mustard because I had run out when it came to adding it to the sauce. I think this was a fortunate oversight as it might have overwhelmed the sauce.

I crumbled goat cheese over the top for the last 5 minutes in the oven and used a touch of it in the sauce. I didn't have savory, but over all, it was pretty delicious

I used two 1-lb pork loins and couldn't find any savory. It still came out great, though I agree with the previous reviewer who pointed out that the shorter roasting time doesn't allow the herbs to fully infuse the meat. Even though I only made half of the pork, I still made the full amount of sauce. The extra was great on green beans. The vermouth adds an unusual and really delicious flavor.

Made with 2# loin so cooking time shortened and herb flavors never really developed - great mustard flavor that we enjoyed.

This was a pretty good roast, but not as special as I expected from all the reviews. Pretty sure I didn't do anything wrong as the meat wasn't overcooked and the instructions are fairly simple. I may make it again just because it's easy, but probably wouldn't serve it for a special occasion.

Used a smaller pork tenderloin and roasted for 45 minutes; skipped the sauce and served with purple mashed potatoes and cabbage. Delicious.

I have already added this to my recipe box and will be making it again soon. The bed of fresh herbs really permeated the roast. I had no shallots so used combination of onion and leek with great success. I'm not a big dijon fan, but it didn't overpower. Almost skipped the sauce but sure glad I didn't - it was divine!

Excellent; followed the recipe except baked it to 150F internal temperature and it rose to 155F while resting. I didn't thicken the sauce with butter and flour; only reduced it until it tasted good.

Had to make this in hurry-up mode and it still came out succulent and flavorful.took it out at 135 degrees and let sit and it was pink and perfect. Highly recommend. I did add cream to the sauce to extend it but otherwise by the book.

Absolutely perfect and low maintenance! I had 2 surprise guests for dinner, who upon finishing the meat both mentioned they didn't like pork before. Will definitely make this again!

I made this last night for a family gathering. It was super easy and very tasty. I will do this again. I used a package of pork tenderloins from Cosco, there were 4 tenderloins in the package, I used three. They took a lot less time to cook and were perfectly done. Tender, not dry and flavorful.

Made as written other than I brined it for a few hours before roasting. I had just trimmed all of my herbs before bringing them inside for the winter so it was perfect timing. Very delicious and the house smelled amazing. Served with roasted butternut squash, wild rice, and cranberry sauce.I would make again and will try the method using other cuts of pork.

This was my first attempt at roasting a large piece of meat like this. My experience was similar to someone else's on here. Having followed the directions exactly, it still seemed a bit undercooked. I presume the internal temp did not rise as much as expected while at rest. I will probably try again and just get it to a higher temp before removing from the oven.

This is a fantastic and fool-proof recipe! I have made it three times and it's perfect every single time -- a real crowd-pleaser. I usually serve with roasted potatoes and veggies to keep it healthy. Great for a special occasion, or for any night when you want to eat well. I highly recommend!

Excellent!!!! I made this for a quick weeknight dinner; used dried herbs mixed in with the Dijon on the pork (did not have fresh on hand). Pork was excellent! I'm sure it would be spectacular with the fresh herbs. Sauce was very tasty... complimented the roast, and great on the mashed potatoes. This is definitely good enough for dinner party!

This was the best pork loin roast I have ever made. I made it for a small dinner party and it was so easy and a huge hit. I highly recommend it. I did not have vermouth for the sauce so I used white wine with a dash of white wine vinegar to make it more dry. I also add a splash of cream after I strained the sauce right before I served it. The sauce was great on potatoes as well as the pork.

Rating: 4
Wow! So amazingly juicy and full of flavor. I added 2 onions and some organic baby carrots (not the bagged kind) to the roasting pan which absorbed the flavor from the mustard and herbs and were carmelized and delicious. I can't wait to make this again!

Very simple and elegant main course. Guests really loved the sauce and one guessed correctly that white vermouth was the star. Bravo!

Rating: 4
Note to those who suggest doubling the sauce. While it's amazing, I wouldn't suggest doubling it- much of its flavor is coming from the pan drippings-if you double the rest of the ingredients you'll dilute the flavor as you can't double the drippings. We did thin ours down with a little more chicken stock which worked well.

Rating: 4
I made this pork loin for dinner last night and it was fantastic! It is a great company-worthy main course ( and its reasonably cheap to make too). I made it per the recipe with only one change ( without the Savory- adding more rosemary). The meat is incredibly succulent and the gravy is so good that my husband ( a foodie) literally licked the saucepan. We served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, homemade Challah bread and the Wilted Mustard Green Salad recipe from this site; it was an excellent combination. Highly recommend!

This was great. Made it for a "quick" weeknight meal and it turned out lovely. The sauce is so silky and very tasty, though I made it with white wine instead of vermouth. Next time will definitely try it with vermouth.

Like another reviewer, this was my first attempt at a pork roast and I have to say this recipe is basically fool proof. It is true the total prep/cook time took longer than indicated (more like 2 1/2 hours if you include the 25 minute rest time). I used a combination of fresh and dried herbs that I had available and more dijon mustard in the rub. The meat came out very juicy and fragrant. The best part of the recipe was the sauce! Superb. The next time, I'll have to double the recipe sauce...

This was a last minute dinner and with no shallots or fresh herbs on hand I did the whole thing with scallions and dry herbs and it was still wonderful! Excellent technique and timing for whatever flavors you want to bring out. The 2.5lb loin was just barely pink and juicy...perfect...in about 45 minutes. I'm looking forward to leftovers.

Scrumptious! Ive cooked this dish twice and both times it was wonderful. For the roast, I purchase two pork tenderloins (about $14 total) from Costco and tie them together with string to create a 5-lb roast. With my nothing-special, GE, gas oven the roast takes an extra forty minutes to cook. I dont pull the roast out until it is at 150 degrees, and I let it rest a full 25 minutes. Unlike other reviewers, I have used a rack both times Ive cooked this. With burners off, I also deglaze the roast pan with the vermouth and mustard mixture, then transfer the resulting liquids to a sauce pan before beginning the boil- down process. The result is a lovely, tender, fully (but not over) cooked pork roast that is excellent as the main dish for a banquet, and just as good as leftovers the next day or sliced up for sandwiches. Based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer, Ive served the roast with Caramelized-Shallot Mashed Potatoes, and roasted asparagus or wilted spinach. Since nearly every reviewer has warned that it takes longer to cook this roast than the recipe states, keep that in mind when planning your dinner, and choose side dishes that can be completed within the 25 minute rest period. You wont be disappointed.

I made this for a group of friends and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I thought it was easy to prepare, although the prep time is longer than indicated. Very tasty, smelled delicious and pretty healty as well. I took it out when the thermometer was at 146 degrees, but it was not totally done (pink juices, still a little pink in the middle). Next time I will cook it longer than the recipes calls for. I am definitely planning to make this again.

This was so good and easy! My family loved the pan sauce and the herbal flavors of the pork roast. Like the other reviewer wrote, you can sear it and make the sauce in a regular large pan over one burner instead of a roasting pan over two burners.

Really yummy and super easy to make. Like most people, I had a few mods. For one, I didn't bother using my rack, and just seared it in a pan rather than in the roaster. I also didn't have Vermouth on hand and couldn't get any on a Sunday, so I used white wine instead. Everyone agreed that the gravy wasn't really a necessity, but it was delish, so all was well there. Am definitely adding this to my file. Served with my special mac and cheese. ^_^

I cook frequently, but often stay away from pork for fear of it being dry. This recipe was great. Like another reviewer said, it still turns out fine without a rack. I took it out at 140 and the meat was moist, but I do think it could have come out a few minutes earlier. The sauce was delicious.

This was a huge hit with my family. I'm a novice cook, but this recipe must be nearly fool-proof because my father (the real chef in our family) pronounced it "excellent." And my mother, who eats like a bird and never has a second helping of anything, actually came back for more!

Let me include my praises for this dish. I loved it. So easy but impressive. My husband thought it was fantastic. The only change I'll make next time will be to chop some of the herbs and add to the mustard/shallot/garlic mix. I used a thermometer with an oven probe and pulled the roast out at 140 degrees and it was perfect. We served it with a green tomato chutney I made that had mustard seeds in the spice. Really complimented the meat.

I made this last night for a family of six with some really picky kids. Even the pickiest loved it! It was the most tender and juiciest pork roast I've ever had and the flavors were exceptional. I didn't do the sauce as I ran out of time, but it didn't seem to matter. I didn't use savory because I couldn't find it, and I would use a little less rosemary and a little more thyme for the next time. I served it with stuffed baby pumpkins and roasted pear bread pudding with butterscotch sauce. It was a perfect fall meal!

I used a 2 lb pork loin and cooked it for 48 minutes and it was perfectly tender. I did not have any fresh spices, but put dried thyme and sage in the rub. The pork was so delicious that it did not need the gravy, but the gravy gave it an extra special touch and gave the pork another dimension in flavor. It was also relatively simple to make, where most of the ingredients were already in my kitchen.

Family loved this one, perfect for Sunday night dinner. I used white wine instead of the vermouth, sweet onion because I didn't have any shallots, skipped the savory and it came out perfect. I also didn't use a rack and it cooked up fine, took about 1 1/2 hours for a 4 1/2lbs.

Made this last night for a club function for 60+ people. It was a big hit. Brined the pork overnight first, which kept it moist. The herbs and garlic/shallot coating was excellent. The sauce was good, too. Added some mushrooms to it after sauteing them.

This may have been easy, but was in no way fast when you include the prep, cooking and resting time. I was extremely unhappy with the results, especially after reading so many glowing reviews. I've always put a lot of trust in user reviews on this site and have never been disapointed...so this is my first review but won't be my last. I found the pork to be bland, unexciting and overcooked.

SO GOOD! I was somewhat sceptical as I don't love herb-heavy dishes but this was absolutely fabulous. I didn't change a thing (save for using savory as I didn't have any in my garden). Served it with mashed new potatoes and the swiss chard gratin recipe on this site.

Found this recipe delicious! Next time I will probably use only 4 sprigs of rosemary as I found the balance a tad overpowering compared to the other herbs. Sauce, made with low-sodium broth, was exceptional. Went very nicely with Roast Potatos with Shallots and some sauteed asparagus.

This is a seriously WONDERFUL recipe! I had a 2 lb. boneless pork rib roast and it worked perfectly. Following what others have said, I cut back on the salt used to season the pork roast, and I used homemade chicken stock (only 1 cup's worth instead of the original recipe's 1-1/2 cups), but kept the remaining ingredients pretty much the same. Instead of melting the butter and adding the flour to make a roux, I made a modified beurre manié with 2 Tbsp. of butter and 1-1/2 flour. I didn't have fresh sage or savory, but used 1/2 tsp. dried savory and a healthy pinch of dried sage in the olive oil/mustard/shallots/garlic mixture and it was just fine. Fresh thyme and rosemary sprigs underneath the roast and on top of the mustard blend really adds a nice flavor - top notch recipe!

Wow! Wow! Wow! That's what my husband kept saying as he ate this. This is one of those recipes that's ridiculously easy and extremely tasty. I happened to have all of the herbs fresh in my garden. I didn't have any vermouth, so just used white wine, but I can't imagine the sauce tasting any better. It was so good you could practically drink it. I served it with mashed potatoes, which was great for the leftover sauce. Definitely use reduced sodium broth, and cut back (or out) on the salt on the pork. Otherwise I think this dish would be too salty.

This was really delicious and economical. My family LOVED it! Active time was a lot longer than 20 minutes though. This is an excellent Sunday dinner. I browned the pork and roasted it in the oven in the same pan on top of the herbs. Pork loin is not fatty and there really was no need for a rack. My sauce was a bit salty because I did not have low sodium broth. I will definitly make this many more times. The only problem was that it smelled so good as it was roasting that my family could not stop asking me when dinner was going to be ready!

The pork came out moist and tender and delicious! I added a little honey to the smear and it gave it just a hint of sweetness. I think I would use a little less shallots next time, but it was a wonderful recipe. You can also use dried herbs if you are in a pinch!

OMG! My sister made this dish for me on my visit with her in Canada. The herbs enhanced the flavor of the pork so nicely, the aromas in the kitchen reminded me of Mom's home cooking.
