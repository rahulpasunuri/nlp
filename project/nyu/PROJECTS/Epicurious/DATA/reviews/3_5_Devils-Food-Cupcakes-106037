I successfully doubled the recipe for the cupcakes and I was very pleased with the results. I used olive oil since that's all I had, and a basic vanilla cream cheese frosting. I put some sprinkles on them and used them for valentine's day. Made about 40 of them. I loved the deep chocolate flavor.

The cupcakes are perfect but do not even bother with the frosting recipe - it's a disaster. Rather, use the chocolate, orange buttercream that accompanies the Devils Food cake recipe - absolutely delicious!

These cupcakes were great, moist and I enjoyed the slight hint of coffee. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews on the frosting until AFTER I mixed it up. To save it I creamed 1 stick of softened butter, added the cooled chocolate frosting mixture and mixed. Then I added about 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar. A much more spreadable frosting with great chocolate flavor. If you like a thicker frosting, chill it for about 30 min.

Outstanding, moist cupcakes! However, trust what the other reviewers have said and use a different frosting recipe - this remained soupy in spite of refrigerating for over an hour.

Delicious and easy cake recipe, however the frosting recipe is incorrect, perhaps not tested or containing a typo? Found this recipe on a Web site listing the 50 best cupcake recipes on the internet. This one should be deleted.

Awesome recipe. Substituted Mexican Chocolate and doubled the amount. Came out perfect.

These were okay but nothing special. The texture was the best thing about them. These would be good for a child's birthday party (using decaf coffee) but not for people requiring a more sophisticated flavor. Perhaps using 6oz of chocolate would be better.

I made these for Valentines Day. Used Baker's unsweetened chocolate, good quality, strong, decaf coffee, full fat sour cream (organic) and coconut oil. I did not make the frosting. It made 23 cupcakes. I tried silicon cups, paper cups and Pam "Bakers Spray" and by far the Pam worked the best - the silicon cups left the bottoms gooey and the paper cups were hard to remove. I cooked 25 minutes in a convection oven at 300. They were delicious - very moist and flavourful.

These were the best chocolate cupcakes ever! (My 9 year old agrees.) So light and the flavor is chocolately without being sweet or cloying. Texture is perfect. The only change I made was to listen to the other reviewers and use a different frosting recipe. Doubled the recipe and got 45 out of it.

This recipe makes a lot of batter. I filled 24 cups and still had plenty left over. The cake was excellent; very tasty and much better then the one I made from cocoa powder. Next time, I'll shorten the cooking time from 25 minutes; the bottoms were just burning (actually a nice flavor). For the frosting, I used the "Vanilla and Almond Frosting" recipe, but not the one shown (way too much butter and sugar);lolav11 gave a better recipe in the comments section. I'm still looking for a less buttery, more sugary frosting.

Excellent cake - moist and great flavor. The coffee adds richness. I made different frosting. Simple butter cream works well.

Chose this recipe becasue I was out of cocoa powder and this uses baking chocolate. A couple of hours after baking and frosting w/ a basic buttercream (1 stick butter, 2-2.5 cups powdered sugar, milk, vanilla), they were terrible. Stuck to the cupcake wrapper and were dry and fell apart. The next afternoon (that would be now), they did not stick to the wrapper and were much moister...hmmmmm. OK in a pinch and pretty easy to make, but certainly not on my make-again list.

The cake part of this recipe made the best devil's food cake I've ever eaten but I've had no luck with the evaporated milk frosting and I've tried it twice. (It's soupy.) I'll use a chocolate glaze or traditional white frosting next time.

These cupcakes were a hit! I substituted some 2 oz. semisweet choc. chips for hlf of the bking choc. to give it a little more sweetness. They were very moist and rich at the same time. Delicious!!!

These cupcakes were delicious, light and chocolatey! I had to substitute greek yogurt for sour cream but they were great. Didn't make the frosting though - I didn't have any chocolate left so I made a white greek yogurt frosting.

The cupcakes were easy and yummy, but I didn't make the frosting. Will make these every time I need to bake for a large number of people as I managed to triple the recipe fairly easily.

i think i will look for a recipe that uses butter or some other oil instead of vegetable oil in the cupcake--i think i could distinctly taste the oil in this recipe.

Outstanding, chocolatey, and easy. As good as cupcakes get.

My experience with the frosting was the same as the previous reviewer; it never set up and in fact separated after about 30 minutes in the fridge. Yuck. Cupcakes were nice, but not deeply chocolatey. Definitely use a different frosting recipe if you make these.

The frosting never firmed up for me. Even after a lengthy chill, it still was very soupy. Perhaps I mixed the milk and sugar too long? That's the only thing I can think that I might have done wrong. The cupcakes themsleves were perfect. I had to use a different frosting recipe.
