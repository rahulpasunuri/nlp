This is probably my all time favorite appetizer recipe. I serve it with water crackers so nothing can detract from the salmon flavor. The problem is...no left-overs!!

I actually made and meant to review Fettuccini with smoked salmon, goat cheese, leeks, and zucchini. I couldn't figure out how to delete my review. This looks good, just not quite as good as one with goat cheese.

I served this delicious appetizer in choux pastry shells, garnished with dill sprigs instead of chives, with champagne before a formal dinner party. There were no leftovers!

Originally inspired to prepare this appetizer for an "Irish" theme dinner party (last year), I'd make it for any special get together. So far, I've made this appetizer twice and have received rave reviews on both occasions.

This recipe is not only delicious but very simple and quick to prepare. Our guests had nothing but compliments for its flavor and presentation.
