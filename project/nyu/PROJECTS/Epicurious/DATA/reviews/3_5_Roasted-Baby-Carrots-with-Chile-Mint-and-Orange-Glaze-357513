We thought these were OK. I suggest you go easy on the mint (I *love* mint, but the texture was a bit off), heavier on the orange and chili (not Chile).

I generally like my carrots raw, but was intrigued by the ingredients in this recipe and impressed by the reviews. I made it last night and it is a keeper. Even my husband, who does not like cooked carrots thought it was terrific.

I made this for a side dish for Easter this year. I couldn't find the baby carrots but is did use those tiny carrots you can get at Costco. They were delicious and I do not like cooked carrots. I would add more Chili and mint to this the next time. They were beautiful and very flavorful!

We made them for company, they were so good and our guest said, I don't like carrots, but these are fabulous. Yep, they sure are tasty without the sugar glaze. Definitely, making them for Easter but without the crushed red pepper - this way kids will love them also.

Thought these were FABULOUS! A strong statement for carrots but I was really impressed. After the initial roasting I finished them off in a large saute pan. Already made them twice. Highly recommend you give them a try.

I love plain roasted carrots, but not crazy about 'glazed' carrots. However, this recipe has a nice combination of flavors. Will definitely make again.
