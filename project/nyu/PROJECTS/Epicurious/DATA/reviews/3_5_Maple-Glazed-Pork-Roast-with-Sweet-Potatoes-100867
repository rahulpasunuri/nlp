Followed recipe as is and it was quite delicious. Pork was moist and I was happy to have a sauce, even though it was mostly sweet (like caramel) rather than richly meat-flavored. I used "white" sweets and the puree was very good without any butter or fat! Had the sauce been "meatier" and the pork a bit more flavorful I would have given it 4 forks. It was just a touch bland.

I added a good amount of rubbed sage, pepper and sea salt to the outside before roasting to have a savory balance to the syrup. Overall the dish was very nice and leftovers served with a little chutney will be enjoyable.

I thought I followed all the directions and everything smelled really good while it was cooking but thought it was bland and had almost no flavor at all considering I covered it with maple syrup every 10 min. Thought it would taste way better then it did.

Had all the ingredients on hand and it required very little prep. Added a tablespoon of grainy mustard to the sauce at the end; a tablespoon of maple syrup to the sweet potato mash and passed the pepper grinder around. Used a boneless shoulder (3-1/2 lbs) that took longer (20 minutes) to cook but it was still great. Had friends over for dinner and they loved it!

Deceptively simple and remarkably flavorful. I skipped the sweet potatoes and just made the pork roast in my electric roaster set at 350, basting the roast with maple syrup every 30 minutes or so. Because I was using an electric roaster it did take about 4 hours to reach 175 internally, but the maple flavor was so well infused into the meat that it was delicious and moist, even without gravy.

This was my first time making a roast, and I found this recipe easy and delicious. I added some spice to the sweet potatoes (ginger, nutmeg) and ended up with a sweet pie-fillinmg type side dish, but it went well with the roast so I didn't mind. The gravy was very sweet, but good with the flavours of the roast and potatoes.

Absolutely did not care for this at all. Too sweet. Too bland. Threw the recipe in the garbage before starting the dishes.

Great Dish! Adding yellow raisins and maple syrup to the sweet potatoes carried the flavors throughout the dish. I also added an onion and apple to the roast to liven it up. The flavors were subtle but delicious. I found the sauce to be very complimentary to the roast. Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious! I used a pork tenderloin, which I brined overnight (I use a solution of 4 cups water, 1/8 c. plus 1 Tbl. salt and 1/2 c. sugar) My husband and I loved the maple flavor and the sweet potatoes. I will definately make this again!

This was a delicious meal. I will definitely make it again in the future, as it received rave reviews all around. I can see what people mean about the gravy being a tad bland, but in a way I think it is a nice contrast to the sweetness of the pork and the sweet potatoes. However, I'm toying with the idea of adding a touch of maple syrup to the gravy next time.

I really loved the taste. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. My husband on the other hand thought it was bland. My gravy wasn't very tasty. I don't know why but it tasted very bland. The pork and the sweet potatoes were great though. Next time I'll have to work on the gravy.

Wonderful flavor. For those reveiwers who felt it was too sweet, be sure to use real maple syrup, not the fake stuff, like Log Cabin. I served it with corn muffins, which went well.

Just made this for dinner tonight and it was a huge hit. I didn't change anything nor will I when I make it again in the future. Simple and delicious!

I must be doing something wrong. I made this once and found it to be bland. I gave it another go last weekend, marinating the roast in syrup for a few hours. Didn't help.Boring!

THis is a real winner - for family, or entertaining. Very easy prep

Fast and easy. We added few fresh herbs and inserted garlic slivers into roast for added flavor- a crowd pleaser. Try seasoning roast with Kosher salt.

This is a great easy dish,which I love. My kids also really enjoyed it, I've made it a number of times.

I was leery about making this recipe after I read the last reviewers comment that it was too bland. I decided to make it anyway since it seemed so easy (which it was). I used a pork loin and marinated it in maple syrup for several hours prior to roasting. It was moist and excellent.

I decided to try this recipe after reading the rave reviews -- however, I found it marginal. It was certainly quick and easy, which is always a plus, but the flavor just wasn't for me -- a little too sweet, and pretty bland otherwise. Maybe it was the maple syrup I used? The pork roast, however, was very moist and juicy, which inspires me to find another recipe that better suits my taste!

We LOVED this! Wow! I used a 2 lb boneless rib roast instead of the tenderloin, and it took about an hour and a half to cook, but I started basting it with the syrup after 20 minutes. I made the same amount of potatoes and follwed the recipe amounts as they are listed for the sauce, and boy - it is truly yummy! I want to make this for a Christmas dinner. Everyone should try this :). PS - I also added some ginger and a bit of chicken stock to my mashed sweet potatoes for a little more interesting flavor.

I've made this recipe several times and each time my dinner guests have raved about it and taken seconds and thirds. I serve it with kale sauteed with garlic and seasoned with a dash of balsamic vinegar to offset the sweetness of the maple syrup.

Wow! This was so great the first time, had to serve it again for Christmas dinner! Didn't use as much maple syrup as called for -- seemed fine. Took the advise of earlier reviewer and did roasted garlic mashed potatoes instead of sweet potatoes. This will be a family staple.

I don't eat meat, but my we had my husband's family over and everyone else really liked the pork. We had a large roast, so used extra maple syrup (the more the better, I think). Also, I substituted carrots, potatoes, and asparagus for the sweet potatoes. First I sauteed them in olive oil with salt and pepper, then put them in the roasting pan around the pork. They picked up the maple syrup flavor and were delicious.

My guests raved ovet this dish. I used 1 cup of maple syrup and smoothered the ppork with cracked pepper. The pork was juicy, tastey and tender. sServed it with garlic potatoes instead of sweet - perfect. Will make it again.

This recipe was simple and it was quite tasty. It turned out very moist and the flavor had a nice sweetness to it. My husband, who is not a pork eater, really liked it. I would make this again.

I have made this dish several times for guests. Everyone loves it. A great and easy dish for entertaining. I have also made it with garlic mashed instead of the sweet potatos. I used the potato liduid for the gravy. Highly recommeded dinner

This dish was a smash hit with my parents! I would 100% make this one again. I made a slight change ... I didn't have sweet potatoes so I substituted roasted herbed potatoes. It's a good balance between the sweetness of the Maple syrup and herbs in the potatoes.

Tasty. Very easy, a bit on the sweet side. Might mix the sweet potatoes with yukons next go around.

This recipe was great! I added a touch of brown sugar and butter to the potatoes when I mashed them, otherwise they're too dry. The technique for making the gravy is one that I will use for all my other gravy recipes. Mixing the flour with the softened butter prevents those nasty flour lumps!

This recipe was very easy but delicious. I avoid making gravy but it never turns out right. This makes wonderful gravy and it was so simple.
