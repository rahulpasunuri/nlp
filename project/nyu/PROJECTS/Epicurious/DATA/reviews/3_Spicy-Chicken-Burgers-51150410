I must start off by saying that my husband loved this dish! I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added an egg, but the burgers couldn't hold their shape! I ended up baking as a casserole. And with a cup of edamame, mine turned out a little greener than those pictured.

That sure doesn't look like an English muffin to me

Delicious and fairly easy but completely fell apart while cooking, maybe add an egg to keep it all together. I also didn't add the cucumber to the topping but it was still delicious, maybe add a bit more yogurt!
