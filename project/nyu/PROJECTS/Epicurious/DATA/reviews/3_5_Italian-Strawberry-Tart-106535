Regarding whether this is a tart or a coffee cake, it's really more of a coffee cake or what I would call a "rustic cake." On the same day, I made this cake plus a similar recipe from Martha Stewart whose version used more milk, more sugar, and vanilla in place of cinnamon. The Epicurious recipe was ok, but I preferred Martha's recipe.

I used a 7-inch springform by mistake, and I had to nearly double the baking time. I really didn't care for this at all. It turned out pretty, and it was a cinch to prepare. But the cake was so... blah. It just didn't work for me.

The easiest dessert EVER! My guests all raved about how unexpectedly wonderful the combination of cinamon and strawberries are. I've also made with cardamom which makes for a nice change.

I needed a quick and easy recipe to use up late harvest strawberries and found this. It was perfect. I used almost 2 pints instead of one, otherwise kept the recipe as is. Used a wooden spoon and then a metal whisk to make the batter, which is extremely thick. Spread it in a regular round cake pan. Turned out awesome. I don't see the benefit of a springform pan. This is a classic base cake to use for other toppings like plums, rhubarb, etc. I think a balsamic syrup would have been good drizzled on top.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I made it with tart blackberries and sweet nectarines which really compliment each other. The cake is so moist and I love the touch of cinnamon.

This is so easy and delicious but don't bother if you're not going to serve with vanilla ice cream or something else sweet and wet. It'll just be dry and boring.

I really like this recipe, but it is more of a strawberry cake than tart. I use mostly whole wheat flour rather than white and skim milk rather than whole. I think the important thing here is not to overmix; the wetter the batter the easier it is to spread and press the berries down.

This was lovely .. simple, fresh tasting and not cloyingly sweet. Re. author's note, this recipe resembles the famed NY Times Italian plum tart (one of their most requested recipes) .. so unless Lisa first printed it for the Times (years and years ago), she needn't feel guilty about its dissemination.

Not exactly gourmet, but delicious. Everyone loved it and two or three went back for seconds. Very easy to make.

This is like a kuchen...moist and simple. It is great for breakfast. Eat it fresh, it is not as good the next day.

Fast, easy and delicious! A hit with the kids! I cut up some extra strawberries, combined them with sugar to make some juice, and served them on the side. I brought it to a baby shower where it disappeared in minutes.

This was ok. I agree with a previous reviewer who suggested putting strawberries into the batter as well, perhaps letting the sliced strawberries sit for a few minutes in a little sugar to help sweeten them up. A nice, light, easy to make weekday treat.

What a sweet, simple, little recipe!! Just right when you want to make something to bring to a friend's house, or just for yourself. It literally took me 5 minutes to make (with help of my KitchenAid mixer for the butter/sugar mixture), then spread into the pan with a spatula. Simple, light and not too sweet. Will definitely make again.

This was good. I agree that the cinnamon doesn't add much to the strawberries. I used a 9" round cake pan and it worked fine. If I made this again I think I would use more strawberries and maybe try to mix some into the batter. I loved the hot strawberries, they melt in your mouth.

Tart is a bad word, it is more of a cake, it leaked and made a huge mess in my oven. The dough was a soppy mess. Very difficult to work with.

I loved the cake, but didn't like the baked strawberries. It was easy to make. Think I'll use this recipe again in the future without the fruits as a sponge cake or use it with fresh or canned fruits with cream and\or pudding.

I thought this was great. It was so easy to make and everyone loved it. All the ingredients we had already, so it was easy to make. It baked for thirty minutes and turned golden brown. The strawberry juice started to cook and go sticky, but I thought it was delicious.

Click "See it on TV" to see the Hints from Our Test Kitchen before attempting this recipe. This is indeed a recipe for a coffee cake, not a tart. So, it's really a cake batter you're spreading in a 9 in. springform pan; but like the test kitchen says, you can use a regular cake pan. I substituted 1/2 tsp. cardamom and a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg for the cinnamon - - it seemed to go better with the strawberries. I baked it for 40 min., but it probably was done at 35 min. This actually was a very easy cake to make and tote along to a picnic. I served it with sweetened whipped cream, but vanilla ice cream works too, of course!

This was so frustrating. The tart dough was just a sticky mess. The list of ingredients needs to be checked. Something has to be wrong. Very disappointing to waste the ingredients and time.
