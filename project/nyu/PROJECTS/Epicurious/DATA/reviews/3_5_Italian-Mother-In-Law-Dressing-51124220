I made this for an "after" Thanksgiving get together with our kids who spent Thanksgiving with their in-laws. I thought this sounded like a good twist on traditional stuffing and since we were smoking our turkey I decided to give it a try. Everyone loved it and I thought the flavors were particularly intense. I agree with the other reviewers that it takes some time so making it the day before would be helpful. But, I also agree with the reviewer who thought it was a bit soggy. I thought this too; although, it didn't affect flavor. Next time I think I will lighten up on the broth. This recipe required a lot of broth and I think I will cook the last 10 minutes uncovered. But, if it's still slightly soggy, oh well!

This was a favorite at Thanksgiving this year. It was a bit of work, but I made it a day in advance, and it was well worth it.

Wonderful with our Thanksgiving dinner. Great flavors and not as heavy as other dressings. It does take a while to get everything chopped and ready, but well worth it.

I made this in advance of Thanksgiving because it sounded delicious-I wanted to love it, but I only liked it. It's missing something in the flavor, and the top was well browned while the bottom of the pan was moist to the point of almost soggy but not quite. I will try it again with some tweaks, just not sure what those will be-I welcome suggestions.

This is a keeper! There's a lot going on here, from the chard to the raisins and olives to the onions, cooked as you would for traditional Italian cipolline in agrodolce. It all works together for a wonderfully complex variation on traditional stuffing. Turned out perfectly moist and well seasoned. I tried this out in advance of Thanksgiving and I'll make it again for the big day.
