great recipe as is. . but accidentally discovered a way to make it even better: I had some balsamic vinegar out for another dish, and we decided that a dip in the balsamic and then a dip in the sugar was delicious!!

I made this tonight. Delicious! Would have been better if I had removed the skin. Definitely need to remove the skin next time. Followed to the letter, except at the end served with a sauce of Tabasco and powdered sugar that our waitress at Galatoire's showed us.

Like everyone else said - the people who swore they didn't like eggplant really enjoyed this. I sprinkled just the lightest dusting of powdered sugar on these, and think I preferred the sweet to savory. We were all surprised at how the eggplant just melts away. I don't know how healthy eggplant is, before or after frying, but if you were trying to sneak veggies into kids' gullets, this recipe would do the trick.

I LOVED this recipe. I was not paying attention and I cut into rounds. Next time, I think I will peel it first because I found that the skin got tough when I fried it. The powdered sugar over the top was delicious!

It's interesting, but I don't think I'll make it again. I liked the eggplant but it lacked something, even with the powered sugar. Perhaps I should have tried it with salt.

I used peanut oil dn cut the eggplant into 1/8" thick rounds, not sticks. I preferred a dusting of sea salt as another reviewer recommended. It was glorious. Perfect snack food for a cocktail party.

We thoroughly enjoyed this dish, and I must put eggplant on my list so that I can make it again! Unique and wonderful, especially while warm...

The best fried eggplant I have ever eaten! I just ate an entire eggplant myself. I love Galatoire's, so I figured this recipe must be ok, but doubted if it would work out as well as promised. It was beyond compare! The eggplant is creamy and tender inside, surrounded by a golden exterior that retains heat and stays crisp. I followed the recipe exactly, which is a rarity, for me. A light tableside dusting of sea salt is all that you may want to add. Be sure to cut the sticks to the recipe specifications. This recipe is by far the most simple and delicious recipe around.

I grew up in Northern Ohio and this is how my mom prepared fried zucchini and eggplant. Never knew this was a southern dish...LOL!

My husband loves eggplant and I was looking for a new recipe. He was over the moon for this one. I would have never thought to pair eggplant and pwdered sugar, but it's great! Works best if you can make the strips as close to 3/4" x 3/4".

I was a bit skeptical of the powdered sugar and almost omitted it, but it made this dish superb. An easy dish worth serving to company. Delicious and unusual!

I made this for friends and we ALL just loved it. I used Chinese green eggplant, which were fresh and delicious so I didn't soak them at all. I also just sprinkled the warm eggplant with the powdered sugar. Can't wait to make it again.

This is the first time I've ever seen this recipie written down. My father was from Opelousas, La., and used to make this frequently when I was a child. It was one of my favorites then and remains so today. People who hate eggplant will love it fixed this way. Just don't tell them it's eggplant.
