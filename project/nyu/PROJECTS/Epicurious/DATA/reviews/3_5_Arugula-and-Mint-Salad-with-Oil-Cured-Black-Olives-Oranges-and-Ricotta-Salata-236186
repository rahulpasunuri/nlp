Meh. This was a lot of shopping and work for the result. I DID add the orange flower water and found it didn't contribute much. Does anyone know a really good brand? Years ago, Crabtree & Evelyn had a really good one. I have tried Cortas and one other but both blah.

I eliminated the flower water and the onion. Made smaller orange pieces and tossed with the greens, dressing and ricotta salata. EXCELLENT!

Very good. The arugula combines nicely with the oranges.

This salad is so delicious! I used fennel instead of red onion and feta instead of ricotta salata. It was served with Lamb Tagine. Everyone loved it!

Made this last weekend for our gourmet group's Mediterranean themed dinner and it was marvelous with an intriguing combinations of flavors that complimented each other beautifully. This one is a keeper. Would be especially refreshing on a hot summer evening!

Loved the combination of flavors in this salad - the olives added I nice touch. Feta or goat cheese are good substitutes for the ricotta.

This is an amazing combination of flavors and I'm adding this to my regular standbys. If you can't find ricotta salata, substitute a mild goat cheese or feta, because you really want that salty taste to round out the flavors. I did't have the orange flower water, and the dressing was just fine without it.

Made this for 8 people to go along with the Chicken Tagine with Apricots & almonds recipe on this site. Several people said they "loved" the salad. I thought it was delish myself. My grocery store did not have ricotta salata so I just threw some feta in. I also could not find orange flower water so just left it out.
