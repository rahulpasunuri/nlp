Easy and delicious! Only had Shiitake mushrooms on hand, they were perfect. As I had no low-salt chicken broth, I used regular, and next time I will try low salt or add water... a tad salty but still very tasty.

Very good. Made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand: dried porcini and oyster mushrooms instead of portabellos, with a couple cups of the liquid reserved for the risotto; shallots instead of onion; regular salted butter instead of European-style butter. Used a cup of white wine for the first liquid after combining the barley with the shallots and butter. A few tablespoons of fat-free half and half at the finish. 45 min was about right, and we liked the al dente texture.

? I cooked this for an hour and it was still really chewy.

Wow! This was a great way to use the extra barley I had hanging out in my pantry! I also used some mixed gourmet mushrooms instead of just portobello. I only had 1.5 cups of barley so I used less stock. I modified slightly per some other reviews. I used all the butter at once and sauteed the onions and garlic first. then, i tossed in the mushrooms for a few minutes until just soft, and then added the barley and sauteed a few minutes longer. I then added 1 1/2 cups of white wine in batches first and let that cook off. Then I added 4 cups of broth in batches as recommended by the recipe. I added an extra 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese but forgot the herbs. It was superb. I didn't have any of the issues of "toothiness" mentioned by other reviewers. The barley was a perfect texture - a soft and creamy texture. My boyfriend said that if it hadn't been for the line in the middle, he wouldnt have guessed that it was barley. I will definitely make this again and it went perfectly with the duck I made!!

A very interesting alternative to arborio risotto. I can see where some people might be put off by the texture as the grains are a little chewy, but we liked it, even someone who dislikes Parmeggiano. It keeps better than rice for leftovers too.

Loved this! I made it just like regular risotto: I sauteed the mushrooms with the leeks (instead of onions), added the barley, added 1/2 c. white wine as the first liquid, then proceeded with the remaining chicken broth. Used about 6 cups total, but I think I could have used a bit more as my barley was a little too toothsome. Also, make sure you use low sodium, as this came out a little too salty for me (and I'm usually the one adding way too much salt for everyone else's taste). Otherwise, very creamy and delicious!

This recipe is amazing. I love how toothsome the barley is and prefer it to risotto made with arborio rice. The amazing thing is that I really don't like mushrooms, but I adore the portobellos in this. I have made it many times and it is my go-to recipe to accompany steak when entertaining.

This is a very delicious alternative to the typical risotto. I added a very small dash of cream, and cut down the butter to make it lower fat. I think it could use a bit more flavor though - will play with the herbs next time.

This was delicious! 6 cups of chicken broth was definitely enough and I doubled the herbs. It was so creamy, rich, and just heavenly!

I made this with leeks instead of onions and sans mushrooms. I'm not a fan of arborio rice, so it was nice to discover that I could enjoy a risotto without it. I do love barley and this was a fantastic, quite simple way to prepare it. It requires little supervision once everything is in the pot. I did not need extra chicken broth and I doubled the amount of parmesan. Next time I'll add more parsley for a garnish.

I made this knowing I did not have all the ingredients (specifically, the mushrooms and herbs) but intrigued by the idea of using barley instead of arborio rice for a "risotto". I was not disappointed. It was very good. I did use a bit more stock than was called for (maybe 1/2 cup) because it did not seem creamy enough. I'm sure it is even tastier with all the required ingredients,and next time I will be sure to have them on hand. My 7 year old, however, liked it just the way it was.

Can't wait til it's done. Taking twice the liquid. I glazed the mushroom pan with the broth (ran out of chicken, used veggie, water and a Verdicchio). Currently simmering with a lid on it to get the last bit of the hard center out of the barley.

Lovely. It took 8 1/2 cups of broth, so make sure you have extra on hand. I don't like parsley so I left it out, and doubled the chives and basil. I don't get good results when using arborio rice, but this worked beautifully -- and I'm a huge fan of barley, so I'm in heaven! The mushroom/parmesan combo makes for something mild and savory.

took more time & liquid, used 1 bottle of Jackson Trigs Dry Reisling. Browned mushrooms with garlic as this greatly adds flavor! I would par boil the barley in the stock before beginning as this would cut down on cooking time & wouldn't loose the starch.

This was very tasty. I used leeks instead of onions and it worked wonderfully.

the flavors worked really well in this dish. The barley creates a much heartier risotto. This is a keeper

I thought this was a terrific variation on risotto. I used beef broth because I wanted the intensity of flavor along with a cup of the broth from the mushrooms to give it more character. I also added a touch of cream for lightness.

I make only half the recipe and it still was a lot. I really liked it and was surprised by it's taste. Good as a main dish.

This is my new favorite recipe to serve with beef tenderloin. Have made it many times- it really is better with a european butter. Also- I dislike mushrooms and think this is really divine anyway!

This is a fabulous recipe. Honestly, I like it better than risotto made with arborio. Pair it with some filet mignon done on the grill with butter and garlic and you will get raves!

Barley "risotto" is it's own concept. I have done this before with rich chicken stock and saffron minus the herbs and parmigiano reggiano and it works as a change of pace, especially with Lamb Ragu-type of dishes.

We tried it with arborio rice instead of barley and it worked perfectly. Take your time when adding the broth.
