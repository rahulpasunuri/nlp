I thought this recipe had too much cinnamon and was way too sweet.

The flan is delicious but the pumpkin seed praline is a long run for a short slide - skip it, your guests won't miss a thing! I've made it 3 times now for guests and it's definitely a keeper.

I have made it ahead of time. Leave it in the pan and plate it when you are ready to serve it. It did not affect the texture too much. We always make it the night before Thanksgiving. Make sure you strain it before cooking - makes a huge difference with the texture. Good luck, this is absolutely delicious!

QUESTIONS!!! If you are making the flan 2 days prior to serving, do you leave it in the pan it was baked in? AND how hard will it be to remove? Any tips?

I've never made flan before and was nervous about trying this recipe but it turned out beautiful. It made for both a beautiful presentation and a fabulous- tasting dessert. It is much like pumpkin pie without the crust - but that works for me!

I like the flan but it was not great. It was basically a pumpkin pie without the crust and not as creamy as a flan should be. The carmel top was nice though and that is the best thing about this recipe. I thought the pumpkin seed praline was awful.

Every time I make this, it gets great reviews. The combination of flavors and texture is unbeatable in my opinion. It always takes people by surprise, because it's pumpkin flan. Great fall recipe! Might be great for a change to your regular Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie too:)

While the flavor was delicious, the texture left me disappointed. I agree with the other reviewers about the grainy-ness. As a lover of great flan, I appreciate the creaminess of the custard as much as the flavor, if not more. As much as I did not like this recipe, my boyfriend adored it, so I guess it is just a matter of personal taste.

Pumpkin Seed Praline 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup water 1 cup hulled green pumpkin seeds, toasted Pumpkin Seed Praline: Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Lightly oil a large sheet of foil on a baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Cook sugar, water, and a pinch of salt in a deep 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring slowly with a metal fork, until melted and pale golden. Cook caramel without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden. Immediately stir in pumpkin seeds and quickly pour onto foil, spreading into a thin sheet before it hardens. (If caramel hardens and is difficult to spread, put in a 400 degree F oven until warm enough to spread, 1 to 2 minutes.) Cool praline on baking sheet on a rack until completely hardened, then break into large pieces.

My son loves to cook and we have made this several times. It has become our traditional thanksgiving dessert with all the flavor of traditional pumpkin pie but much lighter (better, in my opinion) texture. With the caramel glaze and pumpkin seed praline it is fantastic! We just have to watch we don't eat all the praline before serving dessert...

This flan was to die for!!! I made it last year for my family in Puerto Rico and they all raved about it. A few weeks ago, I happened to have some sweet potatoes and didn't know what to do with them. So, I tried this recipe with sweet potatoes and it was just as good. (Next time, I would probably reduce the amnt. of sweet potatoes by 1/4 cup to have a more custardy texture)

Quite tasty-- I've changed my mind about the caramel coating. True, it was a lot of trouble, but it's a lovely burnt-sugar flavor that spices up the flan delightfully, especially with the touch of rum (which I substituted for the tequila). I didn't taste it the first time I tried the result, possibly because most of the sauce was left in the dish after unmolding. But I must agree with a previous reviewer who commented that the grainy texture is slightly disappointing in contrast to traditional eggy flans. Instead of the praline, which most reviewers seemed to think wouldn't work, I just cooked up some pepitas in some caramelized butter and sugar, then added a splash of vanilla. The entire dessert was delicious, albeit troublesome!

I've made this flan twice so far. Substituted rum in place of tequila and topped with dark chocolate shavings. Very tasty.

FYI-shelled pumpkin seeds are also known as pepitas. They can be purchased in most health food stores, often in bulk, or at Mexican stores (if you have them in your area). Please, save your fingers, don't try to shell yourself!

This dessert is unbelievable!! I work at a country club and the members loved it. So did my brother-in-law. The recipe is very easy to follow and instead of pumpkin seed, I made pecan pralines. Awesome flan!!

Delicious! As a "first timer" flan maker - the actual flan part was easy to make - the caramel was more challenging - it took an hour to melt the cup of sugar - any suggestions - or futher clarification of "moderately low" ? Despite the slow start, it turned out well, and while I didn't do the praline topping ( exactly HOW is one to shell pumpkin seeds? ) the task seemed too daunting and I liked another reviewers suggestion of whipped cream laced with tequila - that worked just fine....

This was a nice alternative to pumkin pie and I would make it again. But with all of the other flans that I have made once you go beyond the egg base you lose that custard texture and I always find that disappointing. If any one has any suggestions that would prevent that grainy feel please forward them to me. I also found that the praline was labor intensive ( had to shell the pumpkin seed ) fortunately I had a helper in the kitchen. It took them longer to shell the seeds then it did for me to make the flan and get ready to make the praline.

Yes, you can make this, and any other flan ahead of time. Even 2 to 3 days days ahead.

can I make this one day ahead? I would like to make for Thanksgiving, but will need the oven for the turkey!

I made this for Easter Dinner and my guests couldn't get enough of it, the praline topping really takes this beyond ordinary flan!!!

Very good and not difficult. However,it is better to use a whisk to blend ingredients, rather than a mixer. Even on low speed and with using a paddle attachment, the top will become foamy when baked. Although I have not yet tried the praline, it sounds interesting. I served it with whipped cream laced with the tequila or bourbon.

A wonderful recipe - unusual, pretty, delicious and can be made a day ahead. I didn't try the pumpkin seed praline. Everyone liked it and I'm making it again for Thanksgiving.
