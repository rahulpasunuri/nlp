Yummy and easy on a work night. I made a couple of changes as follows: I used regular brandy, substitued sherry for the white wine, 2.5 tablespoons of mustard not 3 tblsps, half and half instead of heavy cream. Definitely let the sauce thicken, do not rush that last step. Delicious with fresh mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus.

I took the idea of the recipe, but I didn't measure. I added until it tasted right. Keep in mind, letting the sauce thicken takes a few minutes. Don't add cornstarch. You get a better reward by allowing the flavors concentrate.

It always bothers me to throw a good sauce away after a meal so I saved the sauce for the next day's tuna casserole. I cooked a 12 oz package of flat egg noodles, added 2 cans of tuna, 1 can of condensed cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic, about 1 cup of cheddar cheese, the leftover sauce and enough chicken broth to reach the desired consistency. It turned out quite good.

I loved it -- followed other reviewers' advice and it came out great. Couldn't easily find apple brandy, and the only pear brandy was $36/bottle. I'm not a brandy drinker -- liquor store owner recommended stoli apple vodka -- it worked just fine. Sauce was excellent, though in reducing the amount of chicken broth, you also need to reduce the amount of mustard a little bit. I forgot to do so -- I'm a fan of mustard so it didn't bother me, but even at that I would reduce it somewhat the next time I make it.

An easy to make and delicious way to serve chicken. The only thing I did differently was to flatten the chicken breasts prior to browning. They cook faster this way and because they are thin, the meat is more flavored by the sauce than a thick breast would be. Be sure to serve this with Chinese sticky rice (short grain) as the sauce clings to this kind of rice and it is really delicious.

I wanted to rate it 3.5. It was great over carribean rice or chicken flavored rice. It was quick, easy, and full of flavor.

This is a great recipe! I make it all the time and I have even used some of the suggestions from the reviews. I use sour cream instead of the heavy cream, I think it works well. I have also used pork loin instead of the chicken. Just as good!

Yummmm. Made this tonight for the 2 of us. 2 large chicken breasts, but the whole sauce recipe. I did adjust a bit after reading the reviews. Marinated the chicken breasts in olive oil/garlic/fresh thyme while I was preparing the other ingredients. Reduced the broth to 3/4 cup, used non-fat Greek yogurt instead of heavy cream, added 1 tsp hot dry mustard, and added only about 1 Tbsp of fresh chopped chives at the end. The chicken breasts I had were huge so I sliced one for the 2 of us, plated it and poured the sauce over. Delicious. And now we have the other breast and sauce to try "cadapi09's" suggestion for the leftovers.

I love everything in this recipe, but it just didn't do it for me. I wanted to make it for a long time and just wasn't impressed. Bummer!

This was a delicious dish. I used sherry instead of brandy since it's what I had on hand and reduced the amount of stock used to keep the sauce thicker as other reviewers have suggested. The mustard flavor of the sauce was a bit strong so I added 2 tbsp more cream at the end. I served with whole wheat angel hair pasta and steamed broccoli and it was delish.

I ended up with a lot more sauce than I needed for this recipe. I wished I had some rice or something to help soak up the juices. Not bad, though.

Another basic, only OK dinner. Certainly not restaurant quality unless you are a Dijon-aholic! Would modify sauce to a completely different flavor...maybe lemon or red pepper.

Yum. Butter, booze, cream and chicken...how can you go wrong? This was delicious! I was afraid that it would taste too boozey with the brandy and white wine (we used cognac and dry vermouth), but they really blended in nicely with the other flavours without becoming overbearing. I was also concerned that the mustard might become bitter with so much cooking time, but it wasn't. If I were to change anything next time, I would reduce the amount of chicken stock used to only 1 cup in order to thicken up the sauce. Delish. Give this a shot.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. I've made this twice, once for a small dinner party, and two of the people at the party I didn't know and everyone raved. Not too difficult, makes a little much sauce. I had forgotten that between the times I made it. Next time I might scale back the recipe, hopefully not at the expense of moist chicken. Will definitely make again.

Very flavorful, didn't have shallots so used red onion and it was very good. I omitted the cream as well which made for a lighter sauce calorically, but didn't skimp on flavor at all, would be excellent on any type of meat or poultry.

Outstanding! I read comments about the sauce and did as others suggested...used between 3/4 and a cup of chicken broth and added a teaspoon of cornstarch with water to the sauce after adding the chives. It was thick and amazing. Also added a teaspoon of dry English hot mustard to the dijon. Great mustard taste and tang without being overly spicy. Just loved this recipe!!

The Sauce was too thin for me... I had to add a lot of flour

Rating: 4
This recipe was delectable and relatively easy to prepare, even for someone as inexperienced as myself. Even with out the liquor I'm not old enough to buy or chives I can't stomach, this dish comes highly recommended. The next day, the sauce and chicken (chopped) was great with sautéed shrooms over penne.

Rating: 4
The recipe produced a delicious dish, but I will make a couple of changes the next time I prepare this recipe. Other than cutting the recipe in half to make for the two of us I followed the recipe in detail and used Kiwi Brandy. The next time I reduce the liquid in step 3 & 4 for a much longer period of time. When I return the chicken breast it will only be to warm them again and serve immediately.

Rating: 4
I substituted 1/3 cup sour cream for the whipping cream, along with some vigorous whisking, and added corn starch and water to thicken after the chicken was removed. I also tossed in some fresh tarragon with the chives, which finished the sauce perfectly. The result was a big hit - so much so that I plan to make extra sauce next time.

Definately not flavorful enough. It was ok - but I would definately add more zip via more mustard, additional pepper, etc.

I made this with five 4-oz thin- sliced chicken breasts (so I only made about half the suggested amount of chicken). I made the full sauce recipe but, based on the reviews, I used only half the suggested amount of chicken broth and still had to cook it slightly longer than suggested. I thought I had cream in the house but I did not, so I subbed 1/4 c. sour cream. My major impression of the dish is that it was much more mild than I would have thought. Also, I think it would be better to add the chives at the end rather than heat them for 5 minutes. One reviewer said it was salty; I thought it wasn't salty enough. I think this might be better with pork than with chicken

Easy and good. To cut down on fat and calorie content I added just a splash of heavy cream and it was great. Also added some frozen artichoke hearts. Yummy.

Excellent sauce over chicken, the chicken was so tender and moist and the sauce was great. Next time i will add some sauteed mushrooms.

Sorry, but I was not crazy about it. The sauce is very thin and not especially tangy. James Beard has an excellent recipe for chicken breasts cooked in mustard sauce, and although it is quite different from this one, I would make it instead of this.

Great Recipe! only thing I changed is instead of heavy whipping cream used Greek yogurt to save a little in the fat department - will definitely make again!

This is DELICIOUS! I doubled the shallots and used Calvados that I significantly reduced but kept all other measurements the same. Served with mashed potatoes (sounds strange but wasn't!) and a simple salad with a balsamic/shallot vinaigrette! YUM!

Easy, delicious recipe. I've done several variations on this classic over the years. Adding sliced cremini or white mushrooms, or sometimes chopped red bell pepper as well. A little tarragon is also a nice addition. Definitely worth using homemade or v.good quality chicken stock, brandy & heavy cream to keep the recipe true to it's French bistro roots. Shallots and fresh chives also make a huge difference. Serve with basmati rice and sugar snap peas, c'est bonne.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe almost exactly but did not add any cream at the end (or milk or any substitute) and it was delicious! I did add 1 tsp. cornstarch, as other reviewers suggested, to thicken the sauce. The sauce was think, beautiful and SO tasty. We just wished there was more sauce (it was that good). I will double the sauce next time. Also, served with roasted carrots and parsnips. Excellent for a Sunday suppa.

Great weeknight meal. My husband licks his plate with this one. Still good without the chives.

I had this recipe in my recipe box and had tried it; thought it was good, but the second time was even better. I am not sure what I did different...I think first go-round I did not have any shallots. They are an important ingredient I guess. I used Jim Beam bourbon.

Rating: 4
Very easy and delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but took the recommendations of others and reduced liquid slightly (only used 1 cup chicken broth). I used Jim Beam, which was good but did leave a slight alcoholic flavor. Next time I'd like to try it with Brandy. Also, I didn't have shallots so used half an onion, which was fine. Great dish, I will definitely make again! I served it with garlic mashed potatoes. See a picture of the finished product on my blog http://southbronxfoodie.blogspot.com/

I made this for dinner last night and I used half the chicken but made the full sauce. My husband went out to "clean up the kitchen" for me but I could hear him finishing off the sauce and groaning with pleasure. I used bourbon instead of brandy, no other deviations. We will be having this again very soon.

This was so good!! I took the chicken breast and put in a ziplock bag. Added a little olive oil, garlic, Thyme & dill and let it marinade. The dill was excellent in it. Once marinaded, I added peanut oil to pan and browned chicken lightly. Added the "chive" tops from green onion and sauteed some more. To the wine I added the dijon and stirred to combine slightly and poured over chicken and let come to a boil. Turned down heat and added the chicken stock mixed with cornstarch and let come to another boil. Poured the whipping cream on and let simmer while I made some herb chicken flavored couscous and steamed up some green beans. Very easy even for me. Would def make aganin

Excellent! Used less chicken broth (approx 1/2 - 1 cup) so as not to have a watery sauce. It is very rich and delicous. The sauce would be great on beef or pork as well. Do try this recipe for an old school classic with a modern twist.

Fantastic recipe! I use wholegrain dijon mustard, lots of fresh chives from the garden and yogurt instead of the cream. This is also amazing served with middle eastern couscous, which gets really pearly and absorbs the sauce very nicely. I make this dish often!

Simple, but delicious and looks gourmet. To cut the fat content, we used non-fat sour cream. At first the sauce seemed a bit runny, but after a few more minutes, it thickened up nicely.

Loved it. Makes great leftovers as well. Used boneless chicken breast and boneless chicken thighs...thighs were delicious. Let the sauce reduce a bit at the end just before adding the chicken back in. Whole family loved it and looks beautiful. One of those recipes that is easy and fancy enough for guests. Great rewarmed as well.

I took this receipe and pounded boneless breast flat then added good quality swiss cheese and procuitto, then rolled up the breast. The gravy on the breast was delicious. I too thickened the gravy and I used more then the required amount of shallots. I served this at a bridal shower and is was both gorgeous and delicious. I served it with roastie potatoes and two salads, yum!

This is an "impress the father-in-law" dish! Or anyone else you need to impress with your cooking skills. We used margarine and non-fat milk for health reasons and we didn't miss the higher fat products at all. Served it with a crisp green saled and steamed rice. Will definitely make this one over and over.

We were very pleased with the results. Next time I will thicken the sauce with corn starch. I used an imported dijon mustard which had a nice strong flavor. Served chicken on a light pasta and poured sauce over it. Would work very well with mashed potatoes.

Good, easy, impressive. As always I substitute whole-milk Greek yogurt for the cream c;utting the fat conent hugely without sacrificing flavor or texture. I also stir about 1 tbsp of flour into the yogurt to thicken the sauce.

Not bad. I'd prefer a slightly thicker sauce so next time may try adding cornstarch as others have said. Maybe a bit more mustard as the amount of chicken broth dilutes the flavor. My husband enjoyed it and it was easy so will definitely do again.

Made this for my boyfriend and I. He loved it, I liked it but the sauce seemed a little overpowering. I normally do not use sherry, so that might have been the flavor that I was tasting. I followed the directions almost exactly except I did use cornstarch to thicken the sauce up a little more. Not too hard to make and I'm sure I will try it again.

Delicious. The sauce doesn't thicken much but is perfect over mashed potatoes. I added three peeled, cored and sliced apples to the pan with the shallots.

Delicious restaurant quality meal at home!! My husband and I LOVED this recipe. The sauce is absolutely delicious. I took the advice from some of the other comments and used corn starch and water to thicken the sauce before serving because it was very soupy. But once thickened it was perfect! Great flavor! I had to substitute the greens of green onions for the chives because I didn't have chives on hand and it turned out great. I will definitely make this again!

This was fantastic! I am always looking for new ways to cook "chicken again?". The only change I made was to add cornstarch as was suggested. Next time I would serve it over pasta or with rice as I am not a big mashed potato fan. I don't think you can go wrong with any side dish. All 4 of my kids liked it and it was easy to make, but I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to guests. Definitely a keeper.

Had problems getting the sauce to reduce, which wasn't helped by adding too much chicken broth. Couldn't tell if I was just supposed to let the alcohol in the brandy burn off, or all the liquid. Otherwise, a supereasy, superfast, supertasty dish

This was easy, I had all the ingredients on hand and my family loved it! Easy weeknight dinner with a gourmet flair! Served with rice and broccoli, the sauce was delicous with both! I found it took longer to reduce the sauce than stated in the recipe once you add the chicken broth - seemed like a lot of broth to add.

Oh. My. God. I am always looking for good chicken recipes, because it's cheap, but I'm reluctant to cook it because it's boring. This changed my mind. The sauce was rich without being too creamy, although I would add a bit more mustard. It was fairly easy, but I had all of my ingredients prepped and measured before I hit the stove, which I recommend, because once you start, you really need to stay at the stove. I served this over mashed red potato, which was amazing for soaking up extra sauce. I will definitely make this again with more mustard and maybe even some more chives, to add a little freshness to the cream.

It was GREAT. Fiancee raved and could not wait to eat leftovers next day ( I made full dish for the 2 of us - that's the only reason there were leftovers). My sole complaint is that it was a little salty, but I did not use unsalted butter when sauteeing the chicken - otherwise it was perfect!

really nice! Didn't have shallots, so I used leeks which worked perfectly fine, perhaps a bit milder. Also, I used a little less Dijon (I ran out) and thought it did not need more. The cream offset the sharp vinegariness of mustard nicely and made it less heavy. Easy to make, definitely a repeat.
