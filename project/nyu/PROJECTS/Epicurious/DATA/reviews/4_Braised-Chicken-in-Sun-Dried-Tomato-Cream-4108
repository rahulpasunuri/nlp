I prepared this according to the recipe with one change: I cut the breasts in half horizontally before cooking. This caused them 1) to cook faster, and 2) to be more tender.

Definitely double the sauce. I added mushrooms, leeks and petits pois to up the vegetales as well as mini tomatoes for color/

This was delicious. Everyone in the family loved it! As other reviewers suggested, I braised the chicken a bit longer than the recipe said to, but I didn't let it go too long so it wouldn't dry out. I topped it with grated Parmesan and served it with wild rice. I'll definitely make it again!

It was really delicious! As mentioned by previous reviewers, I doubled everything except for the chicken, braised the fillets for 15 minutes, turned off the fire, went off for a pre-dinner run, came back and heated it up before rescuing the chicken and making the sauce. Served everything over a bowl of penne pasta and grated parmesan, we ended up licking our plates. In a spot I had no white wine lying around the house, and used some drinking sake, and it worked perfectly!

I made this last night and would have given it a happy 3 forks then, but boy does this recipe taste great as leftovers. I used sundried tomatoes packed in oil and they worked very well indeed. Like many here have suggested, double or triple the sauce and braise the chicken in it for 20-30 minutes. The sauce does start off thin but thickens nicely towards the end. (Not sure what kind of chix breasts are cooked through in 4 minutes/side of saute plus a 3 minute braise....wimpy ones, I suppose.)

This was delicious! I also cheated and used fat-free half and half and the sauce was still creamy and extremely tasty. Served with a salad, roasted veggies, and the rest of the white wine. Yum. Will definitely make again!

Made this tonight for dinner. So simple and quick. I braised it for 20 minutes like the previous post and it did infuse the flavor into the chicken. I served with a best of rice and some green beans. My only comment was how thin the sauce was, probably didn't give it enough time.

Rating: 4
I give this four stars for its simplicity. Look folks, you through almost a cup of whipping cream into any dish, it's going to please. This was no exception. I understood what prior posters were saying about not getting much flavour infusion into the chicken in this three minute "braise". After browning the chicken and adding all of the various ingredients (doubling everything), I put this on super-low, lid on, and braised those puppies for about 20 minutes. This facilitated the issue about having the sauce too runny while also gave the birdies some additional flavour. Served on a bed of rice, nothing fancy, but perfect for absorbing the sauce.

I wanted more of a pasta dish. So, I did this recipe only over a bed of penne pasta and added feta cheese!! So delicious. And I definitely agree about making 3times the sauce. I wiped the plate with some garlic bread it was that good. Everyone wanted the recipe

In the middle of a snow storm so had to use what was in the house. I Made this with boneless chicken thighs. Did not have cream and did not miss it.Served over brown rice, with roasted cauliflower and a green salad on the side This is a keeper, I can see using the sauce over pasta or pork or flank steak.

Oh my goodness, this was great. I added about 2 tablespoons finely diced red onion and doubled teh amount of cream and sun dried tomatoes.

I made this a little different, but it was so good! I cooked the chicked in olive oil and 3 cloves of crushed garlic for 10-15 min.(until chicken was brown) then added 1 cup white wine and cream and two tablespoons of capers, and a package of cut mushrooms-cooked 40 min. I also added 1 teaspoon of tarragon and salt and pepper. This was amazing! served with pasta and sauted green beans. Yum!

Rating: 3
Very easy and tasty. I doubled the quantity of the sauce ingredients (except for the cream, which I left at one third of a cup), because I knew I wanted to sauce a little side of pasta. I halved the breasts, and floured them before pan frying. Knowing that I was doubling the liquid, I added about about a tablespoon and a half of flour to the pan immediately after adding the garlic. I cooked the flour with the garlic and oil from the sun dried tomatoes so that I had more of a paste than a roux. I then added the liquid ingredients, including about a half cup of tomato sauce while stirring constantly. The resulting sauce had nice color and consistency. I added back the chicken, with the basil and a little zingy red pepper flake. - I'm not really a cream sauce kind of person but I was cleaning out the fridge, lol. This was good enough to make again on purpose. :)

Yum! I let the chicken and sauce simmer together for at least 30 minutes until the chicken was tender.

Followed the recipe to a T a few times and also with variations. Each time it has been fabulous. Like others I have also used whole milk a few times which curdled but the time everything was done no one noticed/didn't care because all plates were gold stars. I never liked sun dried tomatoes until this dish but it has made me a convert! The sauce should definitely be doubled or tripled!!!!

Excellent flavor. I sauteed the chicken and then made a pan sauce. I used sliced dried tomatoes reconstituted in boiling water and added quite a bit of red pepper flakes. Using the oil from sun dried tomatoes really gives the sauce depth.

Rating: 4
Really great but I think I either need to marinade the sundried tomatoes for over a day in the oil or buy them already in oil as the recipe suggests. Also must double or triple the sauce and I might suggest tenderizing the chicken and maybe even marinade that as well. It seemed a bit disconnected from the sauce - cooking it in some of the sauce just wasn't enough to soak up the flavor. Must serve with bread to soak up the sauce. As you can tell, the sauce is great! I added spinach and cremini mushrooms which I feel are a must for this one. The mushrooms were fantastic match! Enjoy.

This is a real favorite in my house. I always double the sauce and serve this over buttered egg noodles or rice so you can really enjoy the flavorful sauce even more. Sometimes I brine the chicken in the fridge for 1 hr with 2 tablespoons of salt beforehand.

I used this recipe as a springboard to try and recreate a dish I had at a restaurant here in my city. I tripled the sauce at least. I really didn't measure anything so who knows. I am just really starting to use wine in my cooking and it has beeen successful so far. It really does add a flavour chicken stock alone cannot achieve. I served this with fresh homemade pasta which I thought was not as thin as it should be. I will get it right eventually.

This is one of those unsuspecting recipes that one might look at and think sarcasticly, "Gee, garlic, wine, sun- dried tomatoes, basil, chicken...THAT's innovative." But, in fact, this recipe is PHENOMINAL, and one of the best I've come accross in all of my years using epicurious.com. However, I put my own twist on it technique wise, and I adjusted a couple of minor things: I DOUBLEDthe amount of chicken, and I TRIPPLED the rest of the ingredients. I also cooked this dish in my 6 qt. French oven and had to adjust the heat accordingly. Instead of reducing the sauce for approximately 2 minutes, I reduced it for a whopping 20- 25 minutes (*tent chicken to keep warm and add it back to the sauce to reheat right before serving; while this is reducing, it's is a good time to make the pasta). I got nervous because the sauce didn't seem to be thickening all that much as it reduced, but don't let that scare you; the sauce thickens to a nice, alfredo-esque consistancy once it begins to cool slightly (not completely; just cool enough for one to eat). Lastly, I was tempted to use parmesan cheese to thicken the sauce, but again, there really is no need. Once reduced, the sauce is extremely flavorful and will thicken on it's own. I sprinkled just a smidgen of parmesan, along with a little additional basil chiffonade, over the top of the chicken and pasta once plated, but that was purely for presentation sake. This recipe will DEFINITELY be showcased at least once a month on my table, and I can't wait to have a chance to make it for company!

Good recipe, although i did add a little extra cream because the sun-dried tomato and wine flavor was overpowering to me. I am not normally a fan of sun-dried tomatoes. I ended up slicing the chicken breasts at the end and putting them on top of a bed of orzo pasta with the sauce spooned over the top. I will say it makes a terrific presentation with the tomato slices and the basil. It looked amazing on the plate and would be very good for a dinner party. Pretty fast and easy too.

I've made this a few times for dinner parties, and it always get rave reviews. I sometimes substitute half and half for the cream to ease the guilt a bit!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes! The suggestion to serve this with "radicchio with oil, vinegar and Niçoise olives, and mix chopped chives and grated Parmesan into pasta" makes for a remarkable presentation and an amazing flavor blend. And now remember guys, you can never trust a recipe to season itself and then complain because it's too bland. You have to take responcibity for seasoning your food the way you like your food to be seasoned and that appies to every recipe, not just this one.

Would have to agree with others comment of it not being as flavorful as expected. I did double the sauce, a great suggestion. Used bite sized piece of chicken, also added some chopped leeks and quartered mushrooms. I think next time I would puree half of the sun dried tomatoes to give the sauce more color and texture. What was great was that since I have a window sill herb garden I could literally open my window and cut the basil for the sauce while the sauce was simmering. Doesn't get any fresher than that!

Very very simple and delicious. I doubled the sauce as suggested by others, and highly recommend doing so, especially if serving with rice.

Quick, easy, delicious, and pretty! I made a couple changes: I used 3 chicken breasts (because I'd packaged them that way to freeze them) and cut them into cubes. I used chicken broth instead of white wine. I went slightly heavy on the basil and garlic, and a little skimpy on the sundried tomatoes. When I make this again (and I will!), I'll be even MORE generous with the basil and garlic, and not skimp on the tomatoes. The first bite was a taste 'wow', but after that I wanted stronger flavors. Also, there was plenty of sauce for me, but only because my boyfriend isn't really a sauce person, so didn't take much...I'd probably increase the cream and broth by about half. I served this over jasmine rice. This is definitely added to my list of yummy, quick and easy weeknight favorites!

Planning to make this for the second time. It was great with couscous. It's a little garlicky for my taste, so I might cut down on that a bit. ChezGuy: Your trouble is most likely due to your substitution of half-and-half for cream (if you think about it, it'll make sense that a thinner liquid would make a thinner sauce). If you still don't want to use cream, try stirring a little cornstarch into your half-and-half before adding it; that should thicken it up.

Rating: 3
First off let me say I'm totally new to cooking so forgive my ignorance of basic culinary techniques. I've made this dish twice now and both times it's been pretty good, but like other reviewers I've had problems with the sauce thickening. I sliced the chicken in strips and substituted half & half for the cream, doubled all of the sauce ingredients as people suggested, kept the chicken in the sauce as it simmered, and tried letting it boil longer/simmer longer. The first time the sauce pretty much evaporated completely during boiling and absorbed into the chicken...the result was delicious but I'm sure not how the recipe was intended. The second time I let it simmer a few minutes longer and boil longer, in addition to lowering the temperature (I'm using an electric range stove so that might affect this too), but it never really thickened. I read someone let the sauce simmer for 20 minutes...are those the kinds of times I should expect, because I myself am weary of going that far pass recipe guidelines because, as I said, I know next to nothing about cooking. Any suggestions/comments are appreciated.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Following previous suggestions, I added mushrooms with the rest of the sauce ingredients, and doubled the sauce. The sauce does cook down a great deal, I may more than double the liquid next time. Served over pasta, and it makes a great and relatively quick dinner. I cook a fair amount, and my boyfriend is a good cook as well, and hands down he said this is now his favorite dish that I make.

Great dish - only three forks as I reserve four for the truly mind-blowing dishes. Made as per the advice of others, cutting chicken into bite-sized pieces, doubled sauce amount and pureed it after cooking, then tossing chicken in it before serving over pasta (penne). Sauce came out very thick and velvety and doubled amount was just right for two servings with the pasta. Would definitely do again over any smaller pasta, even rice, and wouldn't change a thing except to add some mushrooms. Yum - and pretty quick too!

My friend gave me this recipe and she raved about it. I don't think mine turned out as well as hers did. I thought there was too much of the sun-dried tomato flavor and not enough of the cream.

Not so much guys. Maybe I'm just not so much on the sundried tomatoes... It wasn't bad, and one of my roomates really liked it, but it definately was not a big enough hit to make again. Especially after the Chicken Voldostana recipe on this site, this chicken didn't measure up. It WAS easy though so at least I didn't feel I wasted a gigantic effort. Also, the wine I used wasn't my normal wine, and didn't taste that good to drink so maybe that affected the flavor as much as the sorta' bitter sundried tomatoes.

Great dish but made a few changes. After cooking the chicken breasts I covered them and put them in a warm oven to keep. Then used the wine to deglaze the pan; let that cook down a bit and continued making the sauce. I also doubled the sauce. Near the end I removed most of the sundried tomatoes; used a handheld blender to puree them a bit and added back to the sauce. That made it nice and thick and rich - yummy! Served the sauce over the chicken and steamed asparagus. Will definitely make again!

This is one of my absolute staples, making an ordinary night seem special. AND the chicken is always moist -- an important thing with me. As others, I always double the recipie for the sauce, and add the wine first, let it warm up, and then add the cream (for the person with the curdling problem). I tried adding sliced portabello mushrooms with huge success, adding them with the liquids and tomatoes. As for watery thin sauce problems, I've learnt to let the sauce simmer for much longer than 2 minutes to get it to a good consistency. Just keep going until it looks right.

Good for how quick it is! I go by taste and eyeball, so I eyeballed the cream and wine. But I did use more than the recipe called for, and used closer to equal parts cream and wine. I also found it a tad thin, so I added just a pinch of arrowroot (probably 1/8 tsp) to thicken it up a bit and it worked like a charm. I'm sure you could use a very small bit flour or cornstarch as well. I also diced up my chicken beforehand. This made the dish super quick and very, very easy. I think next time I will try adding a handfull of roasted or fresh red peppers and perhaps some freshly chopped tomatoes at the end to round it out a bit.

I am not a cook at all. This is seriously the first thing I have ever made from scratch. It was so easy and tasted so good! You really do need to double the sauce and maybe even triple it. We almost didn't have enough and I doubled it. Overall, very good!

I was told this was the best chicken they'd ever tried...thanks for keeping my guests happy.

Very good dish and VERY easy to make - a great combination for a weeknight meal; it also has a nice presentation. I substituted half and half for whipping cream and it turned out beautifully. I served it with wild rice and it made for a delicious meal - boyfriend loved it. I think it would also work very well over pasta.

What did I do wrong? I followed the recipe perfectly, up to the point where I added the liquids, and the cream curdled. After that, I tried some amendments others had mentioned--braised the meat, then put it all in the oven to thicken and finish. I added some artichoke hearts, and it was all good, but my sauce was never right.

Rating: 2
This really rated 2 1/2 forks. It was easy and good, even though I forgot to add the basil. I served it over whole wheat pasta and with snow peas. It was pretty on the plate. I used evaporated skim milk to cut the fat, and it worked out ok...I'll probably use whole milk next time.

Very good and easy. Definitly will make again.

Took the advice of many of the other reviewers and cubed the chicken and served it over pasta, along with grated fresh Parmesan. Since I was using up an already opened box of shells and had less than 1/2 lb left for two people, I thought I'd be fine with the amount of sauce called for in the recipe. Wrong! In order to allow the sauce to thicken, but still get enough for the chicken and pasta, I should have doubled it per the advice of many of the other reviewers. I liked the flavor of this, but the overall dish was just okay and I don't think I'd make it again.

Really great, fast, relatively inexpensive dinner. Reheats for lunch the next day very well.

A big thanks to previous reviewers - all the advice really paid off. I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces, doubled the sauce, let it thicken a bit on the stove, and served over pasta. My guinea pig (who is also my boyfriend)raved about it.

Yum!! This dish was a fantastic find, that dosen't take alot of time to make! I had no problem with the consistency of the sauce, just leave it on the heat a few extra minutes and it thickens right up! It's easy to customize this dish, you can add mushrooms, onions or any other ingredients you have on hand! Creamy and fantastic! Tastes like something from a fancy restaurant! The kids loved it too!

Rating: 4
This recipe was fabulous I added onions and mushrooms and used Light Cream instead of the heavy. I also doubled the sauce -- a must! Quick and easy -- I would make again as my husband loved it!

Rating: 4
My husband and I thought this recipe was absolutely, positively delicious. The first time I made it I made the mistake of trying to balance this recipe with non-oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes (re-hydrated sun-dried tomatoes), which caused the dish to be too tangy. The second time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and therefore I completely amend my first opinion of this recipe -- this dish is so amazingly good. For those reviewers who thought the sauce was too thin, increasing the cooking time for a couple of extra minutes thickens the sauce perfectly ("flour and wine slurry" in this recipe? Can't even imagine that.). I served it alongside Roasted Asparagus (heat oven to 500-degrees; trim asparagus stalks; place in glass pan in one layer; drizzle generously with olive oil; drizzle with balsamic vinegar; season with salt and pepper; roast about 10 minutes until asparagus is fork-tender; remove to platter; sprinkle with parmesan cheese and serve.) Absolutely try this recipe, it's fabulous.

Rating: 3
What a find! This is an easy and quick way to fix chicken, but it tastes like a special occasion. I cooked the sauce just one minute longer, and it reached the desired consistency. I'm going to make sure I always have these ingredients on hand so I can make this whenever the mood strikes.

Rating: 3
Agreed with previous comments about sauce being too watery; I made a slurry using flour and white wine. This thickened it up a bit. I will definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
As I'm not one to follow the recipe point-by-point, I roughly made four times the amount of sauce called for the recipe and served bite-sized pieces of chicken over pasta (serving 8 people). Every last bite was cleaned up and my friends thought it was quite tasty. Note: I added more tomatoes and half-and-half in proportion to white wine, and added lots of herbs and spices since I thought the sauce to be somewhat bland otherwise.

Rating: 2
Although I liked the chicken seared in the tomato oil, I found the sauce to be very thin. Perhaps increasing the cooking time would help to thicken the sauce.

Rating: 4
This is a great tasting recipe that can be made quickly. I doubled the sauce and sliced the chicken as suggested by others. I also added sliced mushrooms which was delicious. I topped the dish with Parmesan cheese. Next time I will probably add the cheese into the sauce while it's cooking. I'll definately make this again!!!!

Rating: 4
This was sooo good! I used fat free half and half rather than heavy whipping cream, to cut down on the fat, and I wiped the excess oil off of the sun dried tomatoes. I added capers and artichoke hearts as well. I used the sauce to coat penne pasta and sprinkled feta cheese over the top. I am going to add kalamata olives when I prepare again. What a hit this was. I will absolutley make this over and over again.

Rating: 4
Last night I had the pleasure of having 8 very special people over and I needed a dish that would be equally special. I usually prefer a "baked chicken" recipe, so I can be at the table, rather than in the kitchen. So, I seared the chicken in the tomato oil, then made the sauce <1part wine, 2 parts cream, fresh mushrooms and extra tomtatoes> placed the chicken in the sauce and let simmer for about 20 minutes while covered. The meat was exceptional and this recipe made my evening a hit! I will DEFINATELY make this one a regular.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. Some suggestions: Mix equal amounts of wine and cream-the wine flavor is too strong. And triple the amount sauce. Chop chicken into bite-size pieces and serve over bow-tie pasta.

This was good but left me feeling like it needed a little something. I made it again without the chicken, added some dried porcini mushrooms, thinly sliced pepper and served it over gnocchi. A handful of pignoli stirred in was good too.

I have made this dish several times... I like to serve it with some butter-garlic angel hair pasta on the side... I also double the sauce...

Rating: 4
This recipe is great, as long as you amend it with the recommendations of the other cooks -- (generously) double the sauce and cut the chicken into stir-fry sized pieces. I had no basil on hand, so I used a dried herb mix that contains basil, shallots, chives, tarragon and dill -- flavor was terrific. I might make it with this herb combination again next time.

Rating: 3
I thought this was quite good. I took the advice of others and cut the chicken into strips and doubled the sauce (except for the tomatoes). Served it over pasta with steamed veggies and a baguette. My boyfriend has never had sun-dried tomatoes and he really liked this... so did I! Would definitely make again... very fast to put together.

Rating: 2
Sauce smelled great but didn't live up to its promise. If I make this again, I'll follow the suggestions of others and use chicken pieces/tenders rather than the whole breast. Also will double the sauce (I increased but didn't quite double) and use the fatfree half and half another cook suggested, as this took roughly forever to thicken. Also definitely needs more tomatoes and possibly parmesan/romano cheese. I'll try again.....

Rating: 2
This recipe was ok but nothing special. We found the sauce lacking something so I added about 1/2 cup grated parmesan. I cut the chicken into strips as suggested by other reviewers and served with pasta but I didn't find the taste compelling. It definitely needs something (nicoise olives, maybe or capers). Overall, not spectacular.

Rating: 4
Yummy! I rushed home from work one evening and decided to toss this together instead of the frozen pizza in the freezer. Boy, was my husband glad!!! Definately double the sauce and use chicken cutlets instead of the full breast.

This is great. Like some of the other cooks, I sliced my chicken into strips, doubled up the sauce and served over bow-tie pasta. All the ingredients blended perfectly and the taste was excellent. I even had an 11-year-old, 9-year-old and 8-year-old asking for seconds.

Rating: 4
I have made this at least a dozen times now, as everyone always raves over it. The previous reviewer indicated that they used "dry" sun-dried tomatoes, but I really think it's imperative to use the ones packed in olive oil. The use of the sun-dried tomato-infused olive oil in the dish adds incredible depth and flavor that would surely be lost without it. Definitely a keeper to be made over and over again.

Rating: 2
I didn't *love* it, but the Man o' the House loved it, so yes, I'll be making it again. Used 1 tsp. of olive oil, 'dry' sun-dried tomatoes reconstituted with hot chicken broth and light cream (there's an oxymoron if I ever saw one!) in an attempt to lighten it up. Tossed pasta with sauce and some steamed broccoli; served chicken on top. QUESTION: Can someone suggest a good substitute for heavy cream? We're trying to lose weight around here!

I thought this had excellent flavor! Doubling the sauce is key, otherwise there isn't very much to serve over the chicken. I served the extra sauce over penne pasta and it was delicious!

Really good!Double the sauce and basil. I used just 2 half breast sliced thin, kept them in the pan the entire time. I served the dish over rigatoni with some fresh grated parmesan cheese, salad and bread. Give this one a try. I would even serve it for casual dinner guest. The only complaint is the high fat content, so will not make it as often as I would like to.

Rating: 3
You can serve this to guests, if it's not a super-fancy dinner party. As other reviewers have suggested, I served it with tagliatelle, and that's perfect. I also recommend a dark green side vegetable like spinach or broccoli, simply because it looks good on the plate next to the chicken in that red-specked sauce.

Rating: 2
Probably 2.5 forks. I used fat-free half and half and it thickened right up. The sun-dried tomatoes made the sauce really salty though. I did like the flavor that the oil gave the chicken. I'd make it again if I had the ingredients on hand.

This is a good recipe for beginners because it looks fancier than it really is. I substituted evaporated skim milk for the cream and it was equally delicious with less fat.

In my opinion, this was a good, normal, week-day family recipe (doubled)that can be prepared in the time it takes for the pasta water to boil and the pasta to cook. It was not a rave recipe. Everyone ate it, the ingredients are appealing, noone complained, but no raves either, myself included.
