I've now upped my rating of this wonderful recipe with the following changes: don't cook the basil at all, add all to the processor raw. Then, cut the liquid in half (3/4 cup of broth), and, if you can use homemade broth. I served the revised dish at another dinner and got raves all around).

Delicious! The only changes I made were to puree the vegetables in my food processor (not my blender), and then I trimmed the broth down to 1 cup. The pistou was so terrific, I didn't want to water it down. I'd like to offer some advice to the other reviewer - you may not have completed the favas properly. First, you remove the small light green bean pods from the large outer pods, then cook them, (one minute is a standard time), then remove the bright green pea from the hard shell. Use a paring knife to slit the shell and pop the bright green fava out. Discard the shell. I'm suspecting the other reviewer did not complete this last step. Favas are both a little time consuming, and a little frustrating in that you start with these large pods, and by the time you are done, you only have a little tiny pile of bright green beans. But oh, what a wonderful flavor those bright green beans have - and they really make this recipe. This is going into my early summer rotation!

This did not work at all. Followed recipe and cooking time for fava beans was inadequate. Boil 1 minute? They are basically blended raw. The ingredients were interresting but the beans ruined it. Had to throw it out, what a waste!
