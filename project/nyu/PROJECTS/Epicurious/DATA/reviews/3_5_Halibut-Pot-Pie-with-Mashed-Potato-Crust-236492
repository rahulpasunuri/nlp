The only change I made was to add some mushrooms and thyme.I think the fennel is essential to the flavour of the sauceIi made it in advance and reheated in the oven at 350.

Solid base to build from but needs help. I used 1/2 lb leeks plus two carrots instead of spinach. It needs fresh herbs - whatever you have on hand but I use sorrel, chives and thyme in mine. Also, a few splashes of tobasco and 2 TBSP cream put it over the top. As for the fish, I use cod or hake. For the mashed, I recommend adding leek and parmesan. For two lbs of potatoes, I saute 1 lb leeks plus 1/2 cup parmesan plus rind of one lemon and rosemary. With all these changes, it's a real keeper.

This was delicious but I'd highly recommend adding some herbs or spices like many other reviewers mentioned. I used fresh basil, thyme, extra shallots and a few tablespoons pesto sauce. I also added sugar snap peas and celery to the spinach and fennel. I used frozen Mahi from Trader Joe's and it was great. My husband loved it. The dish was perfectly savory and flavorful with awesome textures and a nice thick sauce - only using the flour. Perfect for a rainy day!

Add frozen glob of pesto and perhaps some Crazy Jerry's hot sauce to this bland recipe. Baked a trimmed puff pastry by its self and topped pot pie instead of potatoes. Looked professional.

Due to availability, personal preference and cost (halibut was almost $20 lb -- eek!), I made a few changes... Subbed orange roughy & cod for the halibut, added mushrooms along with the fennel (probably about 1 1/2 - 2 C). No veggie broth, so I used a 50/50 mix of mushroom & chicken broth. Also added more spinach and some leftover haricot vert and used olive oil instead of butter (1 T rather than 2). The sauce was a tad thin, so I made a cornstarch slurry to thicken. Didn't have a broiler proof baking dish in the right size, so I just topped with the potatoes and broiled in the same 12" sautee pan I used on the stove. It worked out beautifully and saved a little on clean up. Everyone loved this dish - great use of those mashed potatoes (and haricot vert) from Thanksgiving, too!

Used mahi-mahi for the fish. I think it needs the fennel but only used half the amount along with fresh minced thyme - the two pared perfectly with the fish. Also added just a little cream and shiitake mushrooms. I would make it again with these changes.

Loved this! As did my family which includes very picky teenagers. Did not use the fennel at all because husband doesn't care for it and did not substitute any other vegetable. The spinach was enough and delicious. Was not watery or thin at all. Used exactly the amounts called for in the recipe except I used organic chicken broth. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

Tasty! But a couple of notes: Unless you LOVE fennel, I think there is a bit too much. Next time I'll reduce to 2/3 bulb. I added some mushrooms, which were perfect and extra spinach as others suggested. I also added a touch a cream, which didn't maintain the healthy factor, but sure was good. Watch it that the potatoes don't sink. You have to make sure there is enough filling (the firm stuff - vegis/fish) underneath to prop them up. This dish is definitely worth making, but I recommend experimenting with it a bit.

I've made this dish many times. The recipe as shown is very good, although I would reduce the broth slightly because the fish adds liquid to the dish also. I've used the following substitutions with great success: Tofu instead of fish (brown the tofu in olive oil over medium heat until golden brown, then add 1/2 cup of vegetable broth and simmer until tofu is kind of carmelized in the broth. If you substitute tofu, be sure to use the 1- 1/2 cups of broth as described in the original recipe for the "gravy". Our family loves the dish made with tofu more than the one made with fish. I've also substituted a mixture of vegetables (carrots, peas, corn, haricot verts) for the spinach and fennel if someone doesn't care for those ingredients.

since I do not like fennel I substituted Celery (its closely related) and I used instant mashed potatoes because I can never do fresh right -_- and some of the halibut ended up as cod, (about a 1/2 pound of it) it is delicious, I'm going to go get my second helping now.

I used salmon, and had everything at hand except veggie broth and potatoes. I subbed a mixture of milk and white wine for the broth, and butternut squash puree for the mashed potatoes, to good effect. It ended up as more of a fish bake than a pie, as the squash wasn't starchy enough to absorb extra liquid. That said, the end result was very tasty, and I would certainly make this again. I added leftover mashed potatoes (from shepherd's pie the next night) to my leftovers, and that made it perfect.

This is a really good recipe. I incorporated several suggestions from previous reviewiers: used salmon instead of halibut, chard instead of spinach/fennel( because I don't care for fennel), added more veggies (carrots and peas) and spices (thyme and basil). This is a keeper!

I loved this recipe, after reading the reviews I decided to add more veggetables and the result was delicious. I think it could also work with chicken or ground beef also (using the best choice of stock in each case)

I loved this recipe! I also added carrots, celery, spices, and made individual pot pies in ramikens. The pot pies kept nicely in a warm oven for over an hour before I broiled for a few minutes before serving.

I was a bit wary of this. My husband and I can tolerate only the smallest amounts of dairy, and we both desperately miss chicken pot pie. I used skim milk and water in the mashed potatoes and they turned out fine. Added baby portabello mushrooms and lots more spinach to the mix, then realized I needed more broth for simmering, and then more flour for thickening. It took much longer to broil - I left it in about 12 minutes - but that was probably because of the extra ingredients. I let it settle for about 15 minutes before serving. This stuff is RICH. Delicious, though. Creamy, comfort food flavors. My only change will be larger and more chunks of halibut and fewer potatoes...maybe just a few dollops on top instead of a full layer. All in all, a definite keeper, and it's inspired me to experiment with dairy- free chowder. I'll share the recipe once I perfect it!

I thought that this was just OK. It was a little bland with way too much fennel. I gave it 2 stars because it is so healthy. My kids would'nt touch it, so I won't be making it again.

This was a great and pretty simple recipe once you get the mashed potatoes! We also added a lot more veggies like Mushrooms, Carrots and added Celery to the fennel and shallot sautee. And tarragon and thyme to the final mixture. It turned out fabulous!

My husband and son loved this dish. Made it a second time already and added peas, corn and more spinach. Liked it even better with more vegetables. DELICOUS !!!

Went over very well with the family. I I made with salmon in lieu of halibut - everyone here in the PacNW knows that fresh halibut not available until spring / summer.

we added swiss chard reduced in chicken broth and celery in lieu of spinach and fennel. we were astounded at how much we enjoyed this dish! * one note, it took almost 8 minutes to saute the fish before broiling and six minutes to broil, not four.

Made this last night with Mahi b/c the store was out of halibut. I added a 1/2 cup of white wine the last 2 mins with the fennel/shallots and before the flour. My husband was skeptical but went back for thirds. Definitely going in my file...

How wonderful to find a fish pie recipe that doesn't use loads of double cream! Have made as is, v good; also made last night after defrosting the freezer and needing to use up bits - combined salmon,smoked haddock & peas, even more flavourful!

This is an easy, quick, tasty meal, although i took liberties with the recipe. I could not find halibut so used Tilapia which worked very well. I'm not keen on fennel so used celery and added nutmeg, a teaspoon, to give flavor. All blended very well.

Healthy, delicious, works for non-fish-lovers.

Very nice! The market had no halibut, so I used sole...it might have been better with a meatier fish, but it was still really yummy. I made some mistakes, but the recipe is very forgiving...my one fennel bulb did not yield 3 cups, but it was fine, and I thought I overcooked both the veggies and then the fish, but again, fine. I think the pot pie concept is fool-proof! I served it with a simple salad. My dinner companion said it was fantastic and I loved it...will definitely make this again!
