I made this for breakfast this morning. I used creme fraîche instead of cream cheese. It was the bomb. The english muffin with fig and orange spread and russian caravan tea I had with it went perfectly too. I expect I'll be making this one again.

Used a smoked chub instead of the trout and it was delicious.

This is excellent. I just made myself a single serving to test it before I made it for others and was very pleased. I didn't have any dill on hand, so substituted some dried tarragon- lovely.

This really was as easy and as good as everyone says it is. I ommitted the dill cause I don't really like it and used a bit less cream cheese.

Delicious... I had smoked salmon, so I used that instead with great results. Very simple and easy brunch dish.

I've made this twice now and it's great! The last time, I didn't have any cream cheese and crumbled up some fresh goat cheese instead. It gave the dish an added complexity as the goat cheese has a much stronger taste. Either way, it's delicious.

A refreshing variation for scrambled eggs. The fresh dill gives it a very pleasant flavor. This dish would be good any time of the day.

I had some left over smoked salmon and used it instead of the trout. The consistancy was great. It is a easy and great brunch dish.

We've served this dish at several brunches to rave reviews. A nice alternative for those who don't like smoked salmon.

This was a simple recipe. I substituted 3 egg whites for 2 of the whole eggs and added less cream cheese. It was a little runny, but overall it got great reviews from my guests.

This made a great Sunday brunch!! This is one I'd make for company.

This is just excellent - very light and creamy as the title suggests and very flavorful. We made half the recipe and found it more than enough for 2 people. It is also very versatile. Paired with a salad and bread it would make a nice lunch (how we had it) or a light supper.
