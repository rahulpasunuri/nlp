I made these for a party yesterday, with a few changes because I was short on time. They came out well, but not a slam dunk (the number of leftovers prove that). I used chicken sausage instead of pork, and bought premade phyllo cups instead of sheets. I also skipped the parsley and bread crumbs. I pureed some of the mixture, leaving enough of it over to add chunks back in. Definitely didn't get the texture right on these, and they were an unappealing color too. They tasted good, but I'm not anxious to finish up the leftovers. I might try this recipe again with a different sausage, and would use the parsley and bread crumbs.

A fantastic hors d'oeuvres and quite easy to make. I was pressed for time as I made several hor d'oeuvres for our New Years party and used a food processor for the mushrooms and onion which still yielded excellent flavors. I also served this towards the end of the night, so I made the filling ahead and kept it in the fridge until it was ready to serve. It was a hit and I definitely plan to make it again.

Delicious recipe. I have made this a number of times and it is a real crowd pleaser. I use the pepperidge farm puff pastry instead of the phyllo. I rolled out the pastry to about double the size and then cut into 2 inch squares. I filled them and folded into triangles, sealing with some water.and then pressing tight. I brushed the triangles with butter (to help them brown) and baked on a buttered cookie sheet.

Great! Definitely use the mini-muffin tins. Phyllo difficult to work with in CO, but turned out great. Used fresh mint.

Using the mini muffin tins is a great tip! The filling is flavorful, and the phyllo presentation elegant. I skipped the bread crumbs. When I don't have as much time, will make the filling and serve on Triscuits.

Great appetizer, I also used mini muffin tins to shape and bake. It made it very easy and the result was more uniform. My son said he could eat the entire recipe!

This was good, not great. I think I didn't put enough filling in the center (triangles) so it was a lot of phyllo, not a lot of filling, which on its own was quite good. Cut the cumin in half and didn't bother with the mint. Used hot sausage.

I cut the phyllo into squares, buttered and layered them in a mini-cupcake pan. This was quicker and easier than trying to fold the phyllo dough which kept tearing. These went really fast at our party! Good for winter.

We have made these twice and had great results both times. The second time, we used three sheets of phyllo to make the twists, which seemed to help them hold their shape better than the two sheets!

This was a good appetizer, but next time, I'll serve it along with other choices. This is to "strong" an hors d'oeuvres to stand alone. Took the suggestion below and used hot sausage and folded into "mini triangles." Also made some phyllo cups, but liked the triangles better. Freezes well.

Yum! I substituted Pepperidge Farms puff pastry sheets for the phyllo and took the recommendation of the writer below... it was fabulous.

I omitted mint, cumin and allspice.I just used a hot,spicy sausage. I folded them "flag style" as you would small spanokopita and placed on cookie sheet in freezer. Once frozen, I bagged them in zip lock. Just remove from freezer and bake. They are delicious & always on hand for guests who drop by for a drink.
