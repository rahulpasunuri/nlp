My family loved, loved, loved this cake. I drizzled the syrup over the hot cake after inverting it and poking it with toothpicks. The cake absorbes much of the syrup making the taste much more intense. A delicious cake and easy to make.

I made it in 9 x 13 and used low fat cream cheese (neufchatel)frosting but still drizzled key lime on top.. Found it a bit dry and I was not impressed but all the guests felt it was better than i did. as an aside; i used real key limes for zest and juice but the bottled would be no downgrade.

I followed a wonderful recommendation by a reviewer for zesting which was to cover the finest side of your grater with plastic wrap and zest away. Worked like a charm. Also decided to replicate LiaC's "mistake" and put the coconut directly into the frosting. A warning on toasting coconut, it toasts quickly. I used a 325 oven and watched it carefully. I also used a tube pan avoiding any chance of spill over. I was asked for the recipe so I consider it a success.

Delicious! Great lime and coconut flavors. Mine came out quite dense, so a little slice was perfect. This was quite easy and quick to make as well, with readily available ingredients.

I have just turned out this cake from a spring form pan! I looks and smells wonderful! I can't wait to put the glaze on. Hope it lasts until dinner is over....

Was easy to make and the glaze was excelent-I added the toasted coconut before which made it stay better. Used low fat milk instead which was fine-I overcooked the cake a little so it was drier than it should have been-ice cream helped hide that!

This is such a delicious cake. Two recommendations: a 9" springform and using store bought self rising flour. First time I made the flour adding salt and baking powder according to a recipe I found online and it just wasn't right. Another delicious mistake: at the end, I mistakenly mixed the remaining coconut into the glaze mix, instead of sprinkling it on top of the already glazed cake. I plopped the glaze right on the cake as soon as I took it out of the oven and gently spread it around as it warmed. Amazing.

I love this cake! I have made it several times and it always turns out great. As all of the ingredients are usually on my pantry shelf, it has become my go-to dessert for the summer.

I followed this recipe exactly with the self-rising flour. It overflowed my 9 inch pan & made a mess in my oven. I found the frosting hides the cake taste. I would make it again but in a springform pan that is deeper. It would also be easier to get out.

Using what I had on hand, I substituted regular limes, salted butter, and fat free milk with a splash of heavy cream. (Also baked in 10" springform pan.) Cake was wonderfully moist and not overly sweet...and serving it with Haagen Dazs ginger ice cream kicked it into dessert bliss. Definitely a repeat!

Made this for a fish fry party. Very good, but if you plan to flip, I would not recommend doubling the recipe, as it was too heavy and blew apart all over my countertop. Could do nothing but laugh and serve it in unattractive chunks, as I was not about to punt after spending so much time with those limes. Very moist & flavorful, but I also increased both the limes and coconut. Will make again (as written).

This is really good. Zesting and juicing key limes can be treacherous but it only took me 9 limes so it wasn't that bad. DEFINITELY use a 10 inch cake pan - that's what i used and it rose to the top (it was 2 inches high). Took about 42 minutes to bake in the 10 inch. Be sure to spray your cake racks with non stick spray - i forgot and mine was a little difficult to get off. Very moist. There is also no need to use buttermilk - by adding an acid (lime juice) to the milk, it thickens like buttermilk. That's actually a substitute for buttermilk - add 1/2 TB lemon juice to 1 cup milk and let sit until thick.

I made this for the first time to take to an Easter gathering, and really liked the tart lime flavors with the coconut. Using fresh key limes was the most painful part of the recipe since they were about the size of a quail egg and getting enough zest and juice for a double recipe took over an hour. I may cheat next time and use a larger, regular lime. Also, I doubled the recipe and got two very large 9" round layers, which almost came over the tops of the pans. Loved the tart glaze!

I agree on the larger pan, I used a 10 x 2 tart pan and it was just at the point of going over and when I added the icing it did spill over some. The coconut toasted a little quicker so next time I'll watch closer. However, no complaints from my partner.

Used buttermilk instead of whole milk, and substituted self rising flour with reg flour, baking powder and salt. Baked only 30 minutes. Had great flavors, my husband loved it.

Simply wonderful tastes and light crumb and buttery color. Super yum.

Yum! I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of using a larger cake pan (I used 2 x 10 inch). I highly recommend this size pan... anything smaller would probably have batter spilling over. The cake was moist and delicious! I'd take this any day over key lime pie, and I served it a la mode with Haagen Daz Pineapple Coconut ice cream.

Very Good and easy recipe. Used plain ole limes and accidentely added two extra TBL of lime juice to cake mix. Took about 10 minutes longer to cook, but was nice and moist. Watch the coconut toasting instructions though. At 350; by 6 minutes your coconut may be TOAST, not toasted!!

No Key limes but it still turned out okay. I'll try again with the real limes. Nice moist cake.

I made this cake yesterday and thought it was outstanding. It's the perfect dessert to make when you are tired of the grey windter. Though, I can't wait to make it this summer, too. It was very moist and the lime in the cake was subtle. With the icing, it was wonderful. I couldn't find Key limes in my grocery, so I used regular small. I also didn't have self rising flour, so I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder and a generous half teaspoon of kosher salt to each full cup of flour. Turned out great.

This cake was tasty but I was disappointed for two reasons. It overflowed my 2 x 9 pan in the oven and made a mess before I realized and put a drip pan under it. Also the texture was extremely crumbly-- touching it with a fork to get a bite shattered the cake into a million crumbs. What went wrong? Did I use the wrong kind of self- rising flour? I used Gold Medal-- but it did say in smaller blue print under the "Self-Rising", "Better for Biscuits."
