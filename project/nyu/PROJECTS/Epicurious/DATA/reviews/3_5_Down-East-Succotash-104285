Very good, better than expected. Next time I'll serve it with rice for a complete meal.

This has become a favorite side dish on thanksgiving and always at our table for this holiday. I am a former New Englander and it reminds me of home.

This Was a real hit for thanksgiving. Adding a little color to the brown/orange...Substitute any of the woody herbs if tarragon goesn't suit. Marjoram is good. This is a family keeper on the T-day table every year now.

Appealed to all ages at our Thanskgiving dinner, from 5 to 80. Definately a nice twist on mixed vegetables and the colors on the plate were terrific
