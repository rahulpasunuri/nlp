It is really important to use fresh lemon juice, and I added lemon zest as well. The recipe calls for chopped nuts, but I think it really means pulverized--Mine worked best when the nuts and brown sugar mix was a rough powder. Making these smaller so they are bite sized seems really important to me.

This is indeed delicious, but not as easy as promised. Note that the recipe is for 4 tartlets ony. Making 4 would be pretty easy, but it's not realistic for most uses. I wanted to have these at a cocktail/dessert party, so I made 5 x the recipe and had over 30. I tried to make them pretty small so they would be finger food. They are very crumbly, especially if you follow the recommendation to keep the edges out, like a flower shape.

This was a very impressive and easy dessert. I used hazelnuts instead of pistachios which were delicious.

These were really lovely and everyone I served them to raved. I made the tartlets in advance and covered them in plastic and they held up well. I also used almonds instead of pistachios. I might try a nut-flavored liquor in place of the vanilla next time.

i was sad to discover that i should have defrosted the phyllo 7-8 hours beforehand in the fridge. i read tons of "don't try to defrost phyllo fast!!!" warnings. but i found a way that worked for me. my phyllo came in a box, with a sealed plastic bag inside (which contained the phyllo). I submerged the whole bag in a pan of cold water and voila, 90 minutes later i took it out and it worked great.

These were wonderful. I took them to a dinner party and got rave reviews. I followed the tip from another reviewer and didn't fold in the overhanging phyllo edges, and the cups looked gorgeous. I used extra pistachios and brown sugar sprinkled between the layers(right up to the edges as well as in the bottom) and used butter-flavoured spray instead of butter. I also added some vanilla to the sour cream topping. Definitely a keeper!

FANTASTIC!!!! Very easy, although it takes a little while to put the shells together. I doubled the recipe and then put each tart together as we ate it over the next several days. A real crowd pleaser. A hit at the bar-b-que. Very cute when topped with fresh cream swirl (from can) and a little chopped nuts.

Wow!! This was something else and very easy to make. I wouldn't hesitate to use the shells as the base for different dessert variations. I used three different kinds of berries, and the combination of tart berries and sweet sauce was incredible. A definite "do again"!

This was fun and rather quick to make. Leave the phyllo squares sticking out of the muffin cups, as another reviewer suggests, it does indeed make for more interesting presentation. One of my guests said, "That was Orient Express caliber." I thought that was a very apt compliment. I will definitely make this many times in the future.

I have made this several times, and it is always a big hit. However, instead of folding all the corners of the shells in I leave them up and pointing in all directions. This gives me more room for the filling, and creates a dramatic flower-like look.

This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review. I had an excess of phyllo to use and wanted an impressive but easy dessert to take to a party. These tartlets fit the bill perfectly! Phyllo is always time-consuming, but the steps were easy and the end result was stunning. Don't worry too much about folding the phyllo neatly in the muffin pans; by the time the are cooked and filled with the berries the tarts are delightful!

Very good, however you really need an extra pair of hands while working with the phyllo.

Presentation is nice - easy to make. The combination of the toasted pistachios, crispy phyllo, cream and fruit is fabulous. Can't wait to make it again.

Great! Easy to prepare and a show stopper. Prepared and baked the phylo shells the day before. Didn't have pistachios so substituted pine nuts. Fantastic. I've used the recipe for just the fruit and sauce as an ice cream topper. It will be a regular when fresh fruit is in season.
