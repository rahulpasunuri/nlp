This an extremely useful seasoning. I use it generously in poultry, fish and soup recipes---even in stir-fry. It can be very salty so I reduce the amount of salt in the recipe so I can add plenty of spice.

The caraway seeds smell delicious but once it's all done, it wasn't that great. I rubbed it on boneless skinless chicken that I seared.
