this is the first time i've said this (really!).. but this dish is really not worth the time. i think it would have been even better with just some sliced bananas and nutella on the crepes. it took several hours, a bunch of pots, pans and utensils and ended up tasting like maple syrup with bananas on crepes. the crepe recipe alone is great but next time i'll skip the sauce, pastry cream and the hassle and make them with more simple ingredients.
