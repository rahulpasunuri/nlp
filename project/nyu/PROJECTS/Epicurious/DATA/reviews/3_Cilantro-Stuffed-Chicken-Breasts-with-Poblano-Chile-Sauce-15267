I made just the chicken last night, added a little shredded mozzarella to the herb-garlic mix, and it was delicious--Chicken Cordon Green! Re: chiles, it seems that chiles that make it all the way to New England have virtually no heat. If I made the sauce, I'd include some veins and seeds for heat, as other reviewers suggested. In most recipes calling for chiles, I have stopped wasting my money on jalapenos that taste like bell peppers and use pickled jalapeno slices instead (although that wouldn't work for this recipe).

Sorry, but I pretty much followed the recipe with poblanos and it was blah. I even sprinkled some feta (to sub for queso fresco) on top which helped but not enough. The sauce might be good on enchiladas or something else with more going on, but with all the seeds and ribs removed it wasn't even barely hot. I should have read the reviews more closely before trying this, maybe leaving some seeds in and adding cumin would help. If you want a great green sauce to serve with almost any meat or fish, with no more fuss than this recipe, try the sauce from Bobby Flay's "Shredded Chicken and Tomatillo Tacos with Queso Fresco" on the food network site. I've done that one with flank steak and chicken, and it would go great with shrimp or fish too.

We have made this several times already; that said, I have made some modifications to the recipe. I add either monterey jack cheese or queso fresco to the pocket--it gives it a richer, smoother flavor. I also add about 1/2 cup of cream to the sauce to mellow out the sharpness. Serving this with black beans and rice makes a really nice meal.

In Japan, where we live, it's difficult to get the pepper; instead, we used regularngreen pepper for the sauce. My husband and I ended up screaming how good it was. fyi, this sauce might be good with pork chop or white fish (i.e. cod.)

I made this for my boyfriend and I last night and it was fantastic. Though I did make a few changes, I added shredded jalepeno jack chees to the cilantro and garlic stuffing. Also for the sauce since I couldn't find poblano chilis I used serrano chilis and left in the seeds but added about a teaspoon of sour cream to tone down the heat. Fansastic!!!

With the sauce, I followed the lead of some of the previous reviewers. I used a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic (about 4 good-sized cloves), added about a teaspoon of ground cumin (which lended a nice background taste - more cumin could easily be used for a stronger presence), and I included about a dozen poblano seeds which gave a strong amount of heat, but didn't kill the flavor or your tastebuds. The key, I believe, to making this sauce work is to reduce the amount of chicken broth to about 1/2 cup (that allows all the flavors to be stronger), and don't be afraid to add a good amount of salt - almost a full teaspoon. It won't be too salty. If you are doubtful, start with 1/4 teaspoon salt and taste, then add more, taste, etc. The sauce was great! I used about 1/3 of a cup of cilantro and had no trouble fitting it into the chicken breasts. Overall, this was pretty impressive. Add to that the fact that the chicken can be stuffed with cilantro ahead of time and the sauce can be made ahead of time, and it would only take about 15 minutes to heat the sauce and cook the chicken for guests. Garnish with chopped cilantro or a sprig.

I was a little skeptical b/c of previous reviews. I took the lead of others and added roasted cumin seed to the sauce, an extra garlic clove, and a few poblano seeds. The sauce had depth and a smoldering heat. It was great. I used dried cilantro leaves and bumped it up to 4 tbsp. I also broiled it a little longer.

When I saw cilantro and poblano chile, I had to try this recipe. wow! I don't understand the negative reviews on the sauce. It was anything but "bland" or "un-perky". Perhaps they did not use true poblanos. I added a little cilantro to the sauce and did not remove all of the charred skin from the chiles which gave it nice texture and added flavor. I also left a few seeds for the kick, and it gave the sauce that nice mellow heat only poblanos have. We also grilled the chicken along with corn in the husk and served it with simple baked white mexican rice. Absolutely fabulous dish!!!! P.S. this review is actually about a year old, went on the website to look it up again today and thought the idea of adding the cheese from the cook in Lake Forest to be an excellent idea, going to try it!

We really enjoyed this. I made the poblano sauce and found it had a lot of flavor. I also added a chunk of pepper jack cheese to the pocket in each chicken breast and it gave it additional flavor. Will make again. I served it with rice and beans.

The first time I saw this recipe I knew I had to make it even with some of the negative reviews it had received. I did make a few alterations to the sauce by using more chicken stock and reducing it to concentrate the flavor and also by adding lots of cumin which I toasted whole and then ground with a mortar and pestle. I then grilled the chicken which I had stuffed with double the amount of cilantro. It turned out great. If you are not a lover of spicy foods or cilantro then you will definitly want to avoid this recipe but if you are like my husband who claims that poblanos are his favorite pepper and that you can never have enough cilantro then this is for you.

I really wanted to like this more since I love all of the ingredients. The chicken may be a keeper with a better sauce - perhaps "Red Chile Sauce (Chile Colorado)" on this site would perk it up. I used poblano chiles for the sauce and it just wasn't what I hoped for.

First time on this site, this was very good and very easy to make, I made it with the poblano sauce, it turned out too hot (probably didn't take out the veins very good), but I toned it down with some "crema agria", after that is what delicious. I am going to try the sauce with chicken enchiladas.

The yellow bell pepper sauce was on the bland side, but there might be hope in the poblano chiles.

This recipe is great! Must serve over the Rice, Bean and Corn Salad: Gourmet Aug 1998. Best when using true HOT poblano chilies.

This recipe was like wax fruit; beautiful to look at but a disappoinment to taste. I made both sauces. The yellow pepper sauce was bland, the poblano sauce hot but no depth.

Fabulous recipe!!!!If you like spicy foods the poblano chile sauce is excellent. Would probably be great with some types of fish as well.

4 forks up and 2 knives as well! I made the sauce with roasted yellow peppers for a sunny-sweet touch. As a side I made mexican corn which went along with it perfectly. For casual dining I included chips with guacamole and chunky salsa. Perfect!

Made this recipe and got rave reviews. Low Fat and great tasting! A very clean and light dish. Try with a mango, jicama, and corn salsa as a side dish! Beautiful!
