I've taken this to a picnic and to a Christmas psrty and given it neighbors and friends. Everyone raves about it.

This is one of my party go-to recipes - I roast the tomatillos until the skin is just charred - adding fresh tomatoes is a good addition and adds some visual interest. Always the first dip to be gone.

Tasty and super easy. The description of it having a nice balance of the tangy taste of the tomatillos with the buttery goodness of the avocados is quite accurate. Only thing I would recommend is running the tomatillos through a food processor, since their skin can be difficult to cut with a knife alone.

We have made this many times . Have added tomatoes , when fresh and in season. Have also skipped the lime juice , and added sugar. Its a great salsa recipe that you can play with to get the taste you like . But , the tomatillo-avocado(rough chopped ) is what makes this recipe.
