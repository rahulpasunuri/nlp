Whoa - please heed the advice of a previous commenter to reduce the amount of salt in this dish. The rub alone is way too salty and when you add the sauce made with soy sauce it is bordering inedible it is so salty. Otherwise the flavors are tasty together.

I love this recipe and all it's components but... I have tried it as written both times first with beef backs and second with meaty pork ribs. The biggest issue that my diners and I had was too much salt. Between the 3Tbsp. for the rub and 1Tbsp. soy sauce for the sauce it was too salty. Also, be careful what brand of adobo chiles you purchase; La Costena are terrible! They have chunks of onion (not listed on the front of the package) incorporated into the mix that makes them, well, gross. You want an adobo that has nothing but peppers and sauce. I am still going to work with the recipe and hope for better results. Also, watch your cooking time especially with the beef back ribs; over-cooking can be an issue if your grill is too hot.

Spectacular! Sadly, I live in a small grill-less apartment in the city - so I made these in a slow cooker! I modified the recipe a tad (check it out with my slow cooking instructions at www.carolinescravings.com. The creators of this recipe are genius! I brought these ribs to a party and they vanished into the bellies of very happy, very satisfied people in minutes!

I've made this recipe 3 times using both beef and pork ribs. The sauce is the best! Cooking the ribs is a little effort but work it!

Cannot believe I never made my own BBQ sauce before. The chipolte cherry sauce was so easy to make and delicious. Like the article said, people will be talking about these ribs long after your party! Worth the effort.

I am a personal assistant and made these twice in a 2 week period. They turned out awsome. I used apple cider vinegar for basting and made everything else the same. Huge Hit! Would for sure do this again and again.

I actually made these twice, both times in the oven. First with the cider, didn't make the sauce, and they were just ok. Second time with cherry juice and the accompanying sauce (minus the chipotle) - wish I'd made more - absolutely delicious.

to the cook from Washington: You have to click on the link that says "Chipotle- Cherry Barbecue Sauce". The other ingredients are for the rub.

Haven't tried this recipe yet, but where is the Chipotle in the Chipotle-Cherry BBQ Sauce recipe??
