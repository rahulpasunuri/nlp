Delicous way to use up leftover or stale bagels. I was surprised by how much salt the recipe calls for. I slightly reduced the amount of coarse salt that I sprinkled on top, but still found the crisps too salty. Even my salt-loving husband agreed. Will certanly make again, but with less salt next time.

Taste was 4-forks; cutting bagels into uniform slices is quite another matter. I used some "Montreal bagels", famous for their being inconsistent in shape; thus, inconsistently-sized chips. For us, not a big deal, as it created very crisp chips and chewier chips in the same batch, but if you like your chips to be a consistent thickness (therefore, finished texture also consistent) you might rather try the store bought, more uniform ones.

Yum. So quick and easy and delicious. We made it twice in a weekend! Our recommendation, though - use fresh rosemary if you have it. It blends to a creamier consistency and gives a better (and more even) flavor to the chips. The dried rosemary wasn't quite the same.
