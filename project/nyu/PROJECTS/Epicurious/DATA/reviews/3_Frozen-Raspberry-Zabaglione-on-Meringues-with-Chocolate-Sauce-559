The frozen zabaglione is flawless and it got all my guests licking their fingers and begging for more. I actually made another batch for a friend the next day! The chocolate sauce is too rich, though, and it masks the tartness of the raspberries - it's totally unnecessary. And to hold the meringues in shape I had to add tons of extra sugar. But it's all worth it for the delicious zabaglione!

Beware, this takes lots of time to prepare. The Zabaglione melts quickly and the Meringues tend to stick to the cooking surface, but the result is great. My dinner for 10 all loved it. I would do it again but maybe put the zabaglione on a small pastry shell.
