This dish turned out REALLY bland. We did not care for this at all. I was tempted to add something to improve the flavor, but the consensus at home was not to, but to have a pizza instead! I never dreamt that one of my Bon Appetit/ Gourmet recipes would be voted down so strongly...

This is an easy way to cook these lovely borlotti beans, known in the U.S. as cranberry beans. Take care near the end of the cooking time (I didn't) to ensure the beans don't overcook; mine were slightly mushy but still very tasty. I plan to use some of them for a pasta and bean soup, aka pasta e fagioli, some for a salad, and the rest just as they are, sprinkled with olive oil and fresh herbs.
