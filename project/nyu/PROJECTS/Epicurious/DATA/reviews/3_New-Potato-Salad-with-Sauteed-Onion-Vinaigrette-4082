This is a great recipe- I've made it on several occassions and we always enjoy it. I really like the vege. additions- they bulk it up nicely and add great color and texture. I made it this past weekend and just used chunks of regular red potatoes (instead of new potatoes) with good results.

Good taste but didn't care for the look of brown potatoes (balsamic vinegar turned the potatoes brown)

Very bland, though it looks pretty before you eat it. I would not make it again.

Great!! Very lite and healthy for a potato salad. I will definately make this again and again.

Great recipe. I suggest serving it at room temperature for maximum flavor. It was perfect with grilled tritip steak.

I have made this or variations of this for years. Call me crazy, but i like to add a little brine from a jar of pickles in place of some of the oil.

IT'S ALMOST LIKE WARM GERMAN POTATO SALAD. BEST WHEN WARM.

we love red potoes with garlic, red potatoes & mustard shallot dressing, and this is another great red potatoe recipe to add to our list. Thanks for a great recipe, the crunchy radishes and the contrast with the raw & cooked onions helped make this recipe one of our favorites!
