This was easy and delicious, oh so healthy! It does not however make 4 servings, unless you're talking small children. Two of us easily polished off the 12 ounces. I would strongly recommend doubling or tripling for 4.

my husband really liked this dish, but I was only so-so about it. I think I needed to wring out the spinach more.

I ran out of lemons so I used a tangerine instead. It was a delicious alternative and will make again the same way.

Very quick and easy. The only thing I did differently was to steam the spinach. Delicious! I used it as a bed for the Monte Cristo Chicken.

Easiest recipe ever... I've also made the essence of the recipe for years, with a couple time-saving changes and the addition of garlic. On a weekday night, I use one box of frozen spinach , microwaved for 4-5 minutes just to thaw and get hot, and heat a frying pan with good-quality EVOO, a bit of high-quality sea salt (I prefer Ile de Re). Once it's hot, add the spinach and and one fresh minced garlic clove for only about 1 minute or less. Comes out like HEAVEN on a plate!!!

I agree with earlier reviewer, dont boil, just sweat in own water. Drain well, squeezing out excess water. Saute quickly in a good quality oil, salt pepper, squeeze of lemon and served with grated parmesan.parmesna

This is wonderful as written but even better is to try adding some grated reggiano parmesan and walnuts. One of my favorite salads!!!

Simplicity itself, but delicious and elegant. Since it is simple only the best of each ingredient is necessary. I used a spiced extra virgin olive oil, fresh lemon, and freshly milled pink himalayan rock salt. Lovely.

I have used this simple recipe for years but will sometimes vary slightly. I find steaming and draining the spinach is easier. Sometimes I will drizzle with balsamic rather than lemon. Sometimes neither but add crushed red pepper. Always sprinkle with Maldon salt. Great at room temperature too. Be sure to use your best EVO oil. Yum! In fact, I'm going to make it tonight for a side with grilled Hanger steaks.
