Fantastic recipe. I used pulled pork instead of brisket and might try shredded chicken too. As per the reviews, I agree that you don't need as much butter has indicated. Flavors really come out more if you make it the day before which helps.

Unbelievable!!! I substituted corned beef for the brisket, and it was the most flavorful hash I've ever made. This recipe is a keeper!

This was amazing! We made it for a tailgate party and it was such a hit! I grated the potato and turnip, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make this again!

I made this sticking as close to the receipe as possible. I found that, in contrast with the picture, there was much more meat than vegetables. It still tasted amazing, though - could stop at one serving! - but I'll definitely ass more vegetable next time.

Made it per the recipe and it was really delicious, decadent. Would never thought of combining rutabaga, apple, poblano and red pepper myself. No one taste dominated. The mustard and Worcestershire made what would have otherwise been dry leftover brisket crazy tasty. I did cut down on the butter a bit; wasn't necessary for the browning of the onions and the second browning of the potatoes etc.

Love the ingredients/also thought of the Butter(content)..but thought cast iron all the way..Hash&Eggs..is a favorite of mine.

A stick and 3/8 butter? Are you kidding me? Totally unnecessary. This would work fine with canola or olive oil -- particularly with mustard and Worcestershire and a Poblano pepper as flavorings. At least they didn't add salt to the large amount already in the mustard and Worcestershire -- and in their case - butter.

Easier way to do poblanos: after blistering skin, put in plastic bag & place in freezer 10 mins. For this recipe, you could take the skin off using running water if needed as you will then dice them so it doesn't matter if they don't stay whole. Wash your hands to remove chili oil and be careful of the steam when you clean your cutting board!

This was a firstrate recipe for those who like/love hash. Poker Guys love hash and eggs and we made this for our Tuesday nite game, BIG HIT!. We also played with the recipe and made it lean a bit more to the TexMex side as well. Great addition to the brunch Bar.

I made this in a big cast iron skillet, and it looked just like the photo. My family loved it! My husband even took a photo of it with his phone to make his friends jealous.
