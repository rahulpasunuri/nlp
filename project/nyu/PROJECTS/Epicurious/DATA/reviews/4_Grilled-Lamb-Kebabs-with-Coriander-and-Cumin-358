This was a fabulous, quick meal with pilaf and asparagus. I used it for chops, but marinaded them as suggested. Also, I used balsamic vinegar which added a wonderful flavor. My family loved them.

I roasted the skewers in a pan with the garlic, lemony potatoes from this website hence for more than 30' at 200C. I also added courgette to the skewers. It's was OK. Wouldn't go out of my way to make this again though.

this is delicious and super easy.I added some alepo pepper because I like it spicy, otherwise as written. Make sure to marinade it overnight. Served with tzaziki, hummus, pita, and mediterranean cucumber tomato salad from this site. Yumm!

This is a great recipe. Easy and tasty. But be prepared to babysit the skewers-a quarter turn every couple of minutes. The recipe wasn't quite enough for a full 1.5 pounds of lamb. I recommend adding a little more garlic and marinating 12 to 24 hours if possible.

Outstanding and so easy! We used the same marinade on boneless/skinless chicken breasts that we grilled. Also delicious.

Made these for superbowl party and they were a hit with kids and adults! Very good and will definitely make in future. Despite soaking the wooden skewers, they burned-some all the way off.

Yes, marinate the lamb overnight (it doesn't have to be an amazing cut, but you may want to hit it a few times with a tenderizer first), the vegetables a bit less. Definitely becoming a BBQ staple for me -- guests (and myself) love it.

Great and very easy. I marinated over night as recommended by others and it was very good. Don't be afraid to server this recipe to those who "don't like lamb" as many won't even know it is. I had two guests think it was fillet mignon!

I have made this over and over and it always gets rave reviews. Highly recommended!

Outstanding! I agree with the other reviewers... the meat needs to marinate for at least 24 hours. To make this dinner even easier, I sliced zucchini and yellow squash into 1/2- 3/4 inch pieces, added some vidalia onion and tossed them with a second batch of marinade for 4-5 hours. Skewered them and broiled along side the lamb and served with garlic rice. So tasty and so quick and easy!

This was fantastic! I usually have success with well-reviewed epicurious recipes, but this stood out. I too used boneless leg of lamb on the butcher's recommendation, like some other reviewers did. I doubled the marinade and left the lamb to marinade overnight, which I think makes a huge difference. I happened to grind the cumin seeds fresh (bec I had run out of ground cumin) which also seemed to enhance the flavour really well. I used the broiler (since it's freezing!) and it worked out - I broiled the skewers about 9-10 minutes, turning once and they were perfectly brown outside, pink inside. Served with broiled grape tomatoes, yoghurt with dill, and some pilaf. Great meal.

Delicious and so easy to prepare. Only a coule of changes based on input from earlier testers: 3 cloves of garlic instead of one, marinated for half a day.

Left the chops whole, marinaded for several hours at room temp in a Ziplock bag, slapped them on the grill, and WOW. Very tasty, whole family loved them. Must admit did reduce the cayenne pepper to accomodate my fussy 7 year old, and he loved this. Served with stuffed (rice etc) red peppers and green salad. Lamb is difficult to come by here in the mid-west, so I try to use it wisely. This is definately a marinade I will use again, and again.

I doubled the marinade for a rack of eight chops and it was the right amount. Marinated it an hour before grilling. It was great.

I didn't think that the marinade was anything special (I increased the quantity and marinated for several hours). It was fine for a family dinner.

Great dish for company,all our friends loved it. We made it with beef as well in case some did not like lamb. The lamb was much better. Served with Saffron rice and a Austrailian Cab/Shiraz.....Fantastic.

I made this for about 8 people and duplicated the marinade who-know-how-many times. I skewered green peppers cherry tomatoes and beef and then made a vegetarian rendition, substituting the beef with cubed egglplant. I will have marinated it two days before we eat it. It smells soooo good, exactly like the morrocan cuisine at a very authentic restaurant in Portland, OR. Definitely do this marinade!!

Excellent dish. I used boneless leg of lamb also. I doubled the garlic but definitely didn't need to because I served it with tadziki and Greek Salads and the garlic was a bit too much. But will definitely make this for company!

I chose this recipe over many others because of the positive reviews...and I made it for a party of 11 people, serving it with grilled sweet potato salad. This was well worth the effort. I did let the lamb/spice mix stand for 3 hours (not 5 minutes)

My family thought this is the best lamb recipe ever. Used boneless leg, cut up and bbq'd. Excellent spice blend! Can't wait to make it again.

we made it this weekend and it was great. is it the marinate or the lamb? i can't decide. just great.

My husband and I made this dish this weekend and we absolutely loved it. We used chicken and beef instead of the lamb and added extra cumin and corriander (about 3/4 tsp. of each). We let it marinate all afternoon and that made a difference. Next time I'll let it sit all night. We served it with basmati rice and grilled pita bread.

I used this recipe for a formal dinner for eight. Everyone loved it and it was easy to do for that many people. I used 4 pounds of lamb and had my butcher do the 1 inch pieces. He recommended leg of lamb and not shoulder as recipe suggests. Also, I prepared the sweet potato salad as another writer suggested. Outstanding combination.

I use a similar marinade but with 1 1/2 tsp chopped fresh rosemary, 3 tablespoons olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I've used it on lamb chops and roasted leg-makes a great gravy base.

I doubled the recipe using lamb cubes, tripled the garlic, and marinated it all day. It was fabulous and spicy (hot). A very convenient dish for a party. Served 5 people (we ate everything.) I also served grilled sweet potato salad (recipe on site), and grilled asparagus & red peppers. Had a 1994 Napa Valley zinfandel - just awesome!!

very tasty.... could use a longer marinade I feel.
