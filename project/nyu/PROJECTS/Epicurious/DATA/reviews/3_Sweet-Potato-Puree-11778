Sorry, I meant to put this under the sweet potato puree with sage butter recipe!

I found this a great basic for fish. This was fabulous when I used it as a bed for a very simple grilled halibut. The sage was not overpowering, it complimented the fish very well. But, I cut back on the butter and added a little heavy cream to make the puree extra smooth and creamy.

Simple and make-ahead was just what I needed for Thanksgiving. Made it the day before, and reheated in microwave. Baking rather than boiling preserved and concentrated the sweet potato flavor. Not excessively sweet.

This is the sweet potato staple at our Thanksgiving. I have never pushed the pots through a food mill, just roll up your sleeves and use a potato masher. I put it in a piece of oven proof crockery, and crisp it topped with butter while the turkey's settling. It's easy, and not so sweet as to make your hair hurt.
