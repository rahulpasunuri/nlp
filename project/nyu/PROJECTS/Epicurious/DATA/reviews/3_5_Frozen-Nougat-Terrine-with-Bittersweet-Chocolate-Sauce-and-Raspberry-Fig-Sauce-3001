This should be called a "white chocolate-nougat terrine", as the taste of the white chocolate really comes surging through in the final result. As someone else said, DO read the directions; the cold water is divided into three parts, and I had already done my egg yolks before I realized the mistake. I ended up having to go through a second heating process, so I may have lost a touch of fluffiness to my terrine. Everything else folded in nicely, though, and it definitely was light and mousse-y. Fig-raspberry sauce was amazing...I nearly licked the bowl, literally. Oh wait, I actually did. I found a bittersweet chocolate sauce on here as part of a chocolate ravioli recipe, and it worked quite well, and happened to be the exact amount needed; I made this for 16 people, so instead of cutting it extra thin, I just made eight slices, and sliced those in half. Will have to try this again next year!

I love this recipe just as it is. I bring it out when ever I want to impress my guests with a seemingly simple but elegant dessert.

This has been the standard Christmas Dinner dessert since the recipe was published. What could be better than a Light Nougat, Raspberry, Fig and Chocolate Sauce. We usually have a bottle of Moscato d'Asti opened to enjoy along with this special dessert.I would not change a think about this recipe.

Substituted milk chocolate as a guest does not like white chocolate. Used only hazelnuts. Thought it should be chocolatier. Was not thrilled with the result. Chocolate sauce was quite good.

This dessert worked very well and is especially nice because you can make it ahead and if you are having several small dinners, lunches, can serve a few slices at each one. It served 15 people when I made it, cutting the slices thin. One thing to be aware of is that the flavor is honey. I would add a bit more Grand Marnier next time. I served it with both sauces the first time, and with just the chocolate thereafter, and preferred it with just the chocolate. One of the times I served it I placed slices of it between crisp wafers (like ice cream cone, not sugar cones but the others) and drizzled the sandwiches with the chocolate sauce. My three guests loved it like that and ate them with their fingers. Just an idea.

I make this almost every year! It is a lovely, light and refreshing dessert after a heavy meal. It can be prepared several days in advance, which relieves some of the stress the holidays bring. It is somewhat complicated, but not difficult. Read directions thoroughly and have everything ready before you begin.
