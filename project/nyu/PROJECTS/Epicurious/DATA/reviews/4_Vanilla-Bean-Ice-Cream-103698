I unfortunately had no vanilla beans on hand (but I just placed an order on ebay thanks to someone else's suggestion) so made this with vanilla sugar and a very good vanilla extract. The ice cream is beautiful - great taste and delightfully creamy. Family thrilled. I know this will be even better when I use the beans.

I used this as a base and made an orange flower water/almond ice cream with lemon zest for a Turkish dinner party. Lovely lovely, dependable and versatile base.

This was fantastic. The vanilla seeds gave it a great flavor, although using 3 makes it too pricey to make everyday. I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it.

Instead of the vanilla bean (which is difficult to find and expensive here in Brazil) I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla sugar and 1 teaspoon os vanilla extract. The result was devine. Creamy and very tasty.

This is the first ice cream I ever made and it is amazing!! It has the perfect texture and flavor. I used the three vanilla beans (I have it easy - my sister grows vanilla in Hawaii) and it has the perfect vanilla flavor. This is definitely a keeper.

Great ice cream recipe. My only suggestion would be to use an extra vanilla bean. The vanilla flavor wasn't as strong as I had hoped.

I have made this recipe several times. I've tried one bean with 1tbls. of vanilla extract. I've tried 3 beans, I've tried 2 beans. It all tastes the same - outstanding. Try it!

The ice cream was easy to make especially since it was my first time making ice cream. It has been ranked in the top 5 repeat requests from my family. I'm not an ice cream lover, but I even gave it rave reviews.

Less eggy than most homemade ice creams, but still too much yolk flavor for my taste. I liked the idea of 3 vanilla beans (it made for a beautiful ice cream) as it lent a strong, pure vanilla taste, but I will omit the eggs next time, and cut the sugar down as well. I'm hoping that will make the ice cream less "creamy", and more "grainy", for lack of a better word.

This was creamy, easy and delicious.I like the custardy ice creams, but usually am too lazy to make use of all those leftover egg whites. This tastes like there are more than two eggs in it. I used Nielsen-Massey's Vanilla Bean Paste and so it wasn't so terribly expensive to make. 1 TB equals 1 vanilla bean. There are numerous places online to buy it, including cooking.com and Dean & Deluca.

Heck, if you're going to splurge on three vanilla beans, this is the best way to use them! I loved the slight crunch of the vanilla seeds. Unlike some earlier reviewers, I do like my ice cream "eggy" and custardy; however, this recipe was a refreshing, light alternative.

I love this ice cream and so did everyone at my dinner party. It is easy and fast to prepare, without the "egg yolk flavor" some other reviewers mentioned. Just fantastic!

I made this for a 4th of July BBQ. It was a hit. I did take others advice to double the recipe. This way it served 12 adults. I too loved it because it did not harden in the freezer. We served it with hot chocolate sauce. I've never made ice cream, this was so easy. I will make it again!

Vanilla ice cream DOES NOT get any better than this. Double the recipe or you will regret it! Other vanilla recipes taste too eggy. This one is perfect.

Next time I'll have to double the recipe because this is pretty small the way it is. We used it for strawberry shortcakes. I like the way it hasn't gotten too hard even after being in the freezer.

As I had only two vanilla beans on hand, I used them and added about two teaspoons high quality vanilla extract. The ice cream was still excellent, but better yet with the three beans, I'm sure. This is probably in the "can't miss" catagory of recipes.

The best and easiest ice-cream ever. I heat the cream/milk in microwave w/ the vanilla beans/pods for 5 mins. Beat the suger and eggs added hot cream then cooked agian in microwave for 3 mins,stir every minute. I did not strain and removed the pods just before I put in ice-cream maker. Cool in fridge for at least 3-4 hours. Not too eggy (which I hate) and really, really good ice-cream. Go to e-bay to get Vanilla beans for less $1.00 each.

With vanilla beans at $4.00 each, this is not exactly an economical ice cream, but it is delicious. I made it with two cups of half and half and 2% milk, only 1/3 cup of sugar and added a bit of vanilla flavor because it did not seem "vanilly" enough....a low fat version because my husband does not like full fat ice creams....yet with all my changes it came out wonderful.

The recipe was very easy to follow. At first,I made it according to the recipe. The second time I made it, I used 3 cups of whole milk and 1 cup of heavy cream instead of 3 cups heavy cream and 1 cup of whole milk. The second recipe was just as good as the first and the fat was reduced a bit. I Will definitely make it again. Everyone in the family loved it. The vanilla flavor was fantastic.

Very simple. For a lighter texture use only on egg, and all cream. Hot cream scones with dried berries partner well.
