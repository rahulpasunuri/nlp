Wow! This took less than 15 minutes to pull together and was fantastic. I used half clam juice and half stock, so I needed to add a little salt. So easy and so good - can't wait to make it again.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit! The changes I made were minimal: added an extra can of hominy, and used a clam juice/seafood broth mixture. This dish made for simple and easy entertaining - I made the broth prior to my guests' arrival (which made my place smell wonderful) and I added the seafood (frozen and defrosted shrimp and scallops) just before we were ready to eat.

We have made this time and again. It is so easy and delicious. I am going to serve it again with a warm spinach salad and white corn tortillas. Bon Appetite

I used frozen (defrosted) scallops from Trader Joes and replaced the lime peel with 1 tbsp of Key Lime juice. Yum! Yum! This was my second time making it, and my husband now has developed his own Posole Dance! It's delicious. (NOTE: I used 1 tsp of salt - next time I will only add 1/2 tsp)

I loved this recipe. However, I did use dried pozole, which I rehydrated and cooked prior to inclusion in the recipe. I also make this without the shrimp and scallops and use it as a side dish. It is easy and full-flavored.

I will make this again, but I couldn't give it 4 forks, especially as written - followed the recipe exactly and agree that it tastes pretty bland until you add the cilantro. I added 4 tablespoons of lime juice at the end to get a flavor that I liked. I used Frontera tomatillo + roasted serrrano & cilantro (Rick Bayless) which is rated medium. Next time, I will mince a serrano chile or two to kick it up. Clam juice supplied plenty of salt, if you use seafood stock, you will definitely need to correct for salt. I may try about 2 c clam juice and 2 c chicken broth and reduce it slightly to make the broth richer. Finally, I would skip the sun dried tomato and add some diced plum tomato instead.

Excellent! Salsa verde was a little hotter than I expected -- yet a nice hearty soup.

I have made this several times, I add lime juice at the end. You need to salt the onions or it will be bland. I use seafood stock usually instead of the clam juice.

This is one of my favorite soups and have made it several times as written. I will be making it again soon and loved the additions other viewers gave such as serving the salsa verde on the side, more cilantro, diced tomatoes and lime juice added at the end. I might try seafood stock found in most supermarkets instead of the clam juice next time. I will use the sea scallops as directed as there is a big difference in the taste and texture from bay scallops.

Made just as recipe instructed. Not good at all, was very bland. Not sure what I could have done to make it better...

This was so easy and such a big hit! I used Pace salsa verde with 'hand-picked jalapenos and tomatillos' and it was so excellent! I was very generous with the lime peel and it was fantastic.

Absolutely sublime. So delicious and simple to make, in a short amount of time. I didn't have hominy, so I substituted fresh corn. Still fantastic. Great for a dinner party. Will be making it again soon.

Have been substituting andouille sausage (made with chicken) for the scallops and using chicken broth instead of clam juice just to keep the cost down. AbFab --especially the next day.

I made this dish - exactly as written - along with the other in the menu (Escarole Salad with White Beans and Lime Vinaigrette), thinking both recipes were questionable and possibly duds, despite favorable reviews. I am glad I took the chance . . . What a fabulous combination of flavors!

This is my first review ever on Epicurious, but I made this delicious soup last night for dinner and had to weigh in! My boyfriend loved it and said it's definitely one to serve at a dinner party. Based on the reviews here and what I had at home, I followed the recipe but split the ingredients in half plus the following changes: used a whole can of hominy, a full 7 oz tin of Herdez brand Salsa Verde Mexicana Picante (in place of the tomatillo salsa) that I found in the "International" aisle of my grocery, peel of 1/2 lime, the liquid from a can of clams along with another cup of clam juice, then included the clams along w/ approx. 1/2 lb. frozen shrimp and 1/2 lb. bay scallops. I squeezed the 1/2 lime juice in at the end and added some cracked pepper. White pepper would have been even better. This was one of the easiest soups I have made. I served it with sides of rice made w/ onion + veggie stock and a green salad. Satisfying but not overly heavy. Just delicious...I only wish I had more left overs!

This Posole is sublime...I wouldn't change a single thing. The preparation is simple, the depth of flavor is rewarding. It's great for a work night or worthy of company. No question but that I'll be making this again and again.

This was terrific and so easy. I forgot to pick up salsa verde so I substituted a can and a half of undrained green chilis. I also left out the sun-dried tomatoes as my SO doesn't like tomatoes. It was still soooo tasty. With a well stocked pantry and freezer, this is an easy last minute dish.

This is an fabulous & easy soup that easily serves as an entire meal. I try to keep the ingredients available so if I'm stuck for a great mid-week meal I make this one. I've also made it using frozen shrimp without the scallops & I've even used bottled lime juice rather than fresh & it was fine. I've never had anyone think it was too spicy, but we may have a different interpretation of spicy in New Mexico. This has become one of my favorite recipes.

I have made this several times and love the lime and spice, it's so flavorful. A little too spicy for some people but we have begun to serve it with jasmine rice in the bowl to absorb flavor and cut the intensity a little. I also substitute chipotle in adobo (which adds more heat) for the sun-dried tomatoes (which I dont care for). Additionally I increase the lime, garlic, clam juice, hominy, and salsa-verde.

This was a great dinner soup. I would use less clam juice and substitute vegetable or chicken broth. Might also allow dinner guests to adjust the spiciness by adding less salsa verde directly into the soup and serving it at the table. Very hearty when served with a bakery multi-grain bread. Even better the next day as the seafood absorbed the seasoning.

Great. My husband said "remember this recipe". I listened to other reviews and doubled the hominy, added 1 can of baby clams using the liquid plus seafood broth for the liquid. Also added lime juice at the end. SO gooooood.

This is a nice spicy soup, very tasty. I doubled the hominy because I love it and added 2 cans of clams plus one cup of vegetable broth rather than clam juice.

Great soup! I made it for a large dinner party and it was delicious! I don't like hominy so I subbed beans for it. The clam juice is ridiculously expensive!

We loved this recipe. I doubled the hominy, added a serrano chile for extra spice and a bit of cheese on top. I used bay scallops but think it would be better with the sea scallops recommended.

My father-in-law made this soup for us and it was so delicious so I decided to make it myself. I love the texture of the hominy. I used Whole Foods' brand of salsa verde, medium heat, and it worked really well. I did not cool the broth before adding the shrimp and scallops. Does anyone know what that step is for?

This is a wonderful white Posole. Purchased salsa verde makes this easy, but using the right one makes a huge difference.

This soup was very quick and delicious. I don't like scallops so I omitted them and used 2 lbs of shrimp instead. (Frozen shrimp at that.) Use mild salsa verde and substitute 1 cup chicken broth for 1 cup of bottled clam juice for a milder soup that even children will love. A great last minute meal for the working parent.

Easy, delicious, and remarkably filling for a "light" dish. (I found it to be more than 6 generous servings.) Until I added the cilantro to the dish, I was thinking it was just so-so. But, after adding the cilantro, everything really seemed to pull together and "pop." Like other reviewers, I used bay scallops rather than sea scallops and added the juice and zest of one lime, rather than all lime zest. Used 4 bottles of clam juice and next time might even use 5... but the tomatillo salsa I used is quite spicy and potent. Thought it was even better the second day, after the hominy had absorbed the flavors of the broth. Defiintely a keeper!

Recipe was great and easy to make - I used diced tomato because I didn't have sun-dried and it added a nice fresh flavor.

This was so easy to prepare and tasted incredible! We added a little extra spice with some hot sauce and it was delicious. Easy, filling, and delicious.

I love this recipe. Second time I made it, I added some sliced andouille sausage, which makes a nice variation. I cook the hominy longer than the recipe suggests.

I didn't care for the Homimy. I will try the corn as one reviewer tried. Otherwise it was delicious

I, too, used twice as much hominy. I also used more than a cup of tomatillo/habenero salsa verde, and skipped the tomato. Delicious and so easy to make.

Excellent! I used parsley in the soup and served chopped cilantro at the table for those who like it. Very pretty dish too.

This is a great fast and satisfying soup. I made some minor changes: used no salt chicken broth, used all shrimp and only a pound and a half, as the pot was getting a bit crowded, squeezed half the lime in at the end. Yum! and so quick!

My friend made this for a dinner party she had last Sunday. It was really delicious! It looked very pretty and healthy. She said she followed the recipe but doubled the hominy. I will definitely make this soon.

Great recipe! and I do not like cilantro ( I know this is a fault in my palate!). This soup and the accompanying salad (BA March '07) were a big hit for Saturday supper. All was made even better by finding both the shrimp and scallops at half price today. I will definitely make this again, though next time considering the cost, it will be for company!

Used bay scallops because of the cost. Although I used medium heat salsa, it still needed some punch. About 2-3tsp of crushed red pepper did the trick. Could also use a little extra lime zest.

Hominy is not one of our favorites, so I used kernal corn instead. Not able to find Salsa Verde, medium red salsa worked fine. Next time we'll use hominy, but this is a great recipe for a quick, warm meal.

A wonderful adaptation of traditional posole. Lots of layer to the flavors for such a quick recipe. I skipped the scallops in favor of all shrimp, and squeezed a little extra lime on top. Light, fast and filling.

Good for a first course or very light lunch. Thought flavors were disappointing even though I used expensive salsa verde.

So quick to make and so flavorful. My husband and I loved this recipe. I made a few changes: one sweet yellow onion, one clove of garlic, 1-1/2 teaspoons of lime peel, and bay scallops instead of sea scallops. I also only added one tablespoon of cilantro to the soup, and served the remaining cilantro on the side. I think it would have been just as delightful if I'd adhered to the recipe. I know I'll be using this recipe the next time I have a dinner party.

We made this for Valentine's Day and it was delicious. Simple ingredients but complex flavor. We halved the recipe for two and used the smaller bay scallops instead of having to cut up the sea scallops. We'll definitely make it again for company. Be sure to buy the best salsa verde you can.

Tasty, quick, easy with good flavors from the lime and the salsa verde. Good choice for a light Sunday supper.
