The grill was on too high so the the leaves scorched and the fish was done before it FULLY got it's flavor from the leaves. However, it was still a hit and I would definitely try it again

I was excited about this recipe... the idea seemed like it would produce a moist flavorful salmon. However, first off the lemon and bay leaf techniques was cumbersome. When you tie the string, leaves and lemons are falling out of place everywhere. And for spending almost 10 dollars on the bay leaves themselves, it just wasn't worth it for me. My biggest problem was the cooking time, 20 minutes per side for salmon, are you joking? I cut the time in half to 10 minutes and it still was overcooked, even though my salmon was really thick. Maybe if you cooked it 5 minutes per side, this recipe might be nice. Still think its a waste of time and money though. just my opinion.

Excellent recipe - a lot easier to do than it sounds. Everyone raved, even my daughter who doesn't like salmon!

Very good. A little tough to assemble but worth it. Use a thermometer to get the right temp. I took it off the grill at 125 degrees and after resting was perfect. A great sauce is non-fat greek yogurt, chopped dill, chopped capers, 1 minced garlic clove, pinch of cayenne, salt, and pepper.
