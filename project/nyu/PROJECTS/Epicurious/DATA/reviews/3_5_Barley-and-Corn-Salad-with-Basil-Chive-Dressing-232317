Very tasty, easy, and satisfying. Had to use regular barley and subbed scallions for chives, but otherwise followed exactly.

Delish..fresh, full of flavor. I added more chives to the dressing and a clove of crushed garlic for more zip. This is a great basic salad recipe that you could add any chopped veggie to.

For better color, tear basil or shred instead of blending it and do add grape tomatoes. Somewhat bitter. Not enough flavor overall, even after two days of steeping. Double all flavors, cook barley in stock with more salt. Great on-hand dish--once tweaked.

Loved this, but I did toast the barley first before cooking. And as I was making quite a large quantity, I tried some with the endive and without, preferring the version without the endive. The summer corn makes it so wonderfully sweet, which the endive cuts into.

I made this salad again this year (didnt remember I made it before!) and changed it quite a bit, perhaps my tastes have changed. I added avocado to the salad, which toned down the endives a bit. I also made an additional half recipe of dressing, because i felt like there wasn't enough zip after adding the barley. Next time I might make the barley in chicken or veggie stock to give it more flavor. I also added jicama for extra crunch, which was good.

Loved this salad. We didn't cook the corn so it was crunchy and sweet, the basil and endive match the sweetness. Would definitely make this again.

I sauteed the corn with chopped red onion and chopped red pepper just until the corn was tender. Added veggies to the cooked barley with some sliced pan-grilled beef and the dressing. Served on curly endive for a hearty main-dish salad.

Delicious! I only had dried herbs on hand, frozen corn and no endive and it was all very yummy! I also did not add the sugar.

Took this to a Karaoke Potluck BBQ last night. A total hit! I may add some cherry tomatoes for color next time, but otherwise the flavors were perfect.

What a wonderful way to use those extra ears of sweet summer corn. Made it last night for an impromtu dinner and thought I would have enough left over for lunch...no such luck. My guests kept taking more. The next time I will add some parsley or chives or peppers to the salad for more color. Otherwise a great easy salad. I can imagine adding leftover shrimp or chicken and making it a luncheon meal.

This is a good base, but needs something to kick up the flavor. The barley and corn are a great base, but I found the basil dressing bland. I think I will vary it substantially if I make it again.

i used israeli cous cous and after reading somewhere that endive has no nutirtional value- refuse to spend the money , so i used the inner white part of an iceberg lettuce... i know it sounds bad...but it's not...and it has similar crunch and water content as endive, so it worked well... i agree that it could use more salt and i added brined grilled chicken breast which kicked up the salt factor enough for me... used this dressing again a few days later for a cocktail party on grape tomato and bocconcini skewers...used green onion instead of chives for deeper flavour...got raves..

Very tasty - I made this for my French in-laws and they loved it. I also roasted the corn and added sun dried tomatoes. The dressing needed a bit more salt in my opinion and a little garlic.

Regular barley, rather than quick-cooking, worked fine. I did add the endive, but will definitely skip it in the future.. I think the flavor actually detracts. Additional grape tomato chunks were wonderful, though! This salad was a good addition to a picnic on the Isles of Shoals.

I really loved this dish. I did not use the endive (don't care for it). The crunchy and chewy texture was great. A keeper!

Following others' suggestions, I added grape tomatoes for some color contrast and grilled the corn. Also added some cilantro. Thought it was good....but not exciting.

I substituted quinoa for the barley and didn't bother with the endives. Rather than a salad this turned out to be a delicious side dish for grilled fish. Will make it again with the same substition.

Tasty, easy to make, and a great way to work some whole grains into your diet. I added more vinegar and basil and eliminated the sugar. It came out great! Next time I might add chick peas for protein.

My family loved it. Instead of blanching the corn, I quickly roasted fresh corn on the BBQ, then cut off kernels to add to the salad. I used larger barley grain that was less processed and resulted in a more chewy texture. Keeps well in fridge for up to 4 days.

Texture is great if fresh. Dressing needs spiced up for my taste.

This was really great and so easy! Whole Foods here in LA has the quick cooking barley. I added the cherry tom's to the salad and the shallot to the dressing. It might also be good with an avacado and the lemon suggested. It's a keeper for sure!

A great salad for a picnic or a BBQ! Also, a great base to work around. Even picky eaters like the sweet taste of the basil...and it's a healty grain they're finally eatting! A few changes but kept the idea. -I had quinoa on hand instead of barley, and scallions instead of chives. Also, no endive so baby spinach, half saute/half raw. More vinegar and salt as well. A beautiful presentation in the end.

Added quartered cherry tomatoes to the corn and barley mixture and a shallot to the dressing along with a bit more salt. It was a big hit at the picnic dinner.

A nice salad. I added some black beans for protein, some cilantro, and the juice of 1 lemon (I like more tang). I would definitatly make this again. It's easy and cheap to make, nutricious, and tastes good.

Even with changes I made I did not care for this salad but my boyfriend liked it. Cooked barley in chicken stock, broiled corn for 20 min, instead of chives used green part of green onion and mixed white part in barley, doubled vinegar, added marinated artichokes and let salad sit for several hours before serving. Flavor was good but the barley did not do it for me.

Seemed bland so I added chopped garlic and sundried tomato and spooned into endive leaves. A great way to use the leftover corn I grilled last weekend!

Great recipe - so easy and delicious. I was short on time so I just used a can of niblets but would definately grill the corn next time. I did not add the endive as that seems like a strange combination. The dressing is very good but I thought that the dish needed something else such as diced red pepper for colour and crunch or maybe toasted pinenuts or wheatberries. I also think you could cut down on the oil a bit as it was slightly oily. Definately even better the next day.

I also roasted the corn and would increase by another ear next time. Delicious!

The dressing is delicious, and the salad is even better the next day after chilling. We roasted the corn on the grill inside the husks and put the cob on the grill for a few minutes to get more flavor once it was finished. Delicious. I will make this again!

This went together so quickly and was so simple. It looks just like the photo. Great summer side!
