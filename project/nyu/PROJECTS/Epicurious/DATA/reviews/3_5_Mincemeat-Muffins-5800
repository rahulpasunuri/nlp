Excellent!

These muffins are so good, they might even justify making a batch of mincemeat just for them! The base muffin recipe is delicious, and so adaptable, but this version is special, a wonderful way to use up leftover mincemeat. I didn't want to run to the store just for oranges so I left out the peel and they still tasted great; I'd imagine they'd taste even better with the aromatic orange oil in them.

I have used this recipe all winter long with the green tomato mincemeat I put up at the end of summer. A good variation is to substitute 1 cup oat flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour for the 2 cups of all-purpose called for here. Substituting 1/2 cup tofu for the eggs makes the muffins even more moist and creamy tasting. You may want to turn the oven down to 325 if you try this, as the bottoms tend to scorch a bit this way.

I made some changes...used 1 cup white AP flour, 3/4 cup wholewheat flour, and 1/4 cup wheat bran (not cereal).Instead of butter I used 3/8 cup (3 fl. oz.) cooking oil, and the leading brand (C&B) of mincemeat in a jar which contained no beef or beef suet. I used the amount of baking powder called for. The muffins were light and tender in texture, and tall. Fabulous! And delicious! The flavor was delicate with a light orange overtone. I will make again. These would be good for a brunch or any meal, not just for holidays.

Hmm, can't help wondering if the reason Sarah's muffins messed up her oven was that she didn't have/use a standard tablespoon measure and hence got way too much baking powder?

Delicious ! Just a few points - the beef referred to is in fact suet - which is basically grated beef fat but there is a veggie suet available . Also to Sarah from Peterborough - I know you wrote your message a while ago but just to point out that (A) this is an american site and (B) sets of measuring cups are widely available and it is in fact a very easy way of cooking ( I am also from UK by the way !) Some of the ingredients are different but there are "translators" around on the web to sort this out !

Delicious!! I was a little nervous about the lady from England's review, but the 1 Tb of baking powder worked just fine. The muffins do rise up high so be sure not to fill the muffin tins too much. I used mini bundt pans and baked the cakes for 30 min. Turned out to be perfect gifts.

THANX ALOT! 1 TABLESPOON OF BAKING POWDER! I DONT THINK SO! BEWARE OF THESE MUFFINS, THEY WILL EXPLODE, COATING YOUR OVEN WITH GOO. THE MIXTURE TASTED OK SO I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN, BUT DONT BOTHER USING THE BAKING POWDER, IT WILL RUIN YOUR MUFFINS, YOUR OVEN AND YOUR GCSE MARKS (IF THE SAME HAPPENS TO U AS IT DID TO ME) I AM A VERY ANGRY MUFFIN MAKER AND I SUGGEST THAT U CHECK THESE THINGS IN FUTRE. ONE MORE POINT, PLEASE COULD GRAMS BE STATED INSTEAD OF CUPS, IN ENGLAND WE DONT HAVE A CLUE WHAT YOU'RE ON ABOUT! THANX, SAZ.

No - mincemeat is not typically vegetarian. Here is a sample of a package label = raisins, brown sugar, dried apples, dextrose, water, salt, BEEF, corn startch, dried citrus peel, apple concentrate, spices, distilled vinegar. As with so many other products, you may be able to find vegetarian 'mincemeat'.

In answer to the question below, yes, most definitely in this form it is!

I substituted half a cup of wholemeal flour instead of the 2 recommended cups white flour. This made the muffins coarser in texture. They were very easy and delicious, even after 5 days. My family loved them and I'll certainly make them again. Very good recipe for large crowds!
