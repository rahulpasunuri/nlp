I, too, changed the wine to water ratio to one-one (2.5 C each), using a lovely sauvignon blanc which also went beautifully with dinner. It is the perfect preparation for either halibut or black cod. I made the broth a couple of hours before dinner and let it simmer partially covered, filling the house with a spicey-warm yummy aroma. Served on a bed of sushi rice with a side of haricots verts to raves and requests for more.

Excellent. Used a smaller water to wine ratio (only used about 3 cups of water). Careful on the ground cloves as the little pinch adds a lot of flavor.

A wonderfully subtle surprise awaits. With trepidation I made this for my 3 kids, but they quietly ate every morsel. Also added garlic, and served it over rice with peas. Then I grated fontinella cheese over their bowls. Quite a bit of broth left over, so I'll probably cook some shrimp and mussels and use it up.

Wow this is wonderful. I use 2.5 cups chicken broth and 2.5 cups white wine. I serve it over a simple risotto. One of our favorites.

I would suggest reducing the court bouillon (to concentrate the flavors) before serving it and the fish over a brunoise of roasted vegetables and garlic (ratatouille). Garnish with fresh basil and cracked pepper. Sublime!

Initially, I expected the broth to lend a lot more flavor to this dish, but the more I ate the more I liked it. In order to love this dish, you'll have to really enjoy the flavor of the fish, because the flavor that the broth lends to the dish is very subtle. The halibut, which I caught the day before, was very moist and light-tasting. I added a large, chopped clove of garlic to the broth, but omitted the cilantro because it wasn't available at the market. I served it on a bed of rice cooked in a light chicken broth. I would definately make this recipe again.

This was simple, easy-to-prepare and delicious. It was elegant enough to serve to company. I served it with nice bread, and it made a well-rounded meal.

The bouillon didn't smell that great so I was worried at first, but in the end the fish was moist and had a really good flavor. I didn't have ground coriander seeds so I used the whole seeds. Cooked broth about an hour and strain it before adding the halibut. The broth was enough for 6 filets. It was refreshing and tasty. The fish was moist enough I didn't spoon the broth over it, but am saving it for for fish soup.

This was a great recipe, easy, healthy and good. Used some chopped red bell pepper in the veggie mix. Left out the cloves and used an over the counter spice blend instead.

WOW!!! This is a dish I will make over and over again. It took about 30 minutes to prepare. The fish was light and scrumptious. The spices were just the right proportion (less pepper if you like a more mild taste). I added a bed of rice, fresh snow peas on the side and fresh baby spinich salad. The was a healthy and very delectable meal.
