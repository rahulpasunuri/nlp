I doubled the butter and added a good deal of quartered garlic cloves. Very tasty, makes more than two servings.

I never had celery root before. This was an excellent introduction. This was easy and really tasty, a little sweet even. No other spices needed - just make it as is!

Tried this recipe with lacinato kale instead of green beens (removing stems and huge ribs and cutting kale into thin strips), used a bit more butter that recipe asks for, and also added cumin while cooking. Definite keeper as even my very picky gourmet husband loved it!

Easy. Nice "comfort food" flavors. Made with pork tenderloin. I added garlic powder for punch and more butter.

This was so good, and so easy. A great recipe to get your winter vegetables in. I served with a roasted chicken--perfect.

We enjoyed this recipe. It was my first attempt at cooking celeriac, and was quite a success. Love your web site...especially my personal recipe box, and being able to read the comments of others who have tried various recipes.

This was the first time I had prepared anything with Celeriac at home and I was please with how simple it was to prepare. The slow braising of the vegetables made them delicious. I served this dish with Goat Cheese and Kalamta Stuffed Chicken breasts.
