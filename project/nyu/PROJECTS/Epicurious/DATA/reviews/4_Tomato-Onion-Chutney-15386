We enjoyed this recipe tremendously. Even the kids liked this chutney:-) It is also wonderful on biscuits or toast points, paired with a sharp cheese such as aged cheddar or chevre.

I used this as one of the accompanying sauces for a fondue party. It was excellent with the chicken and so good that one of my guests decided to put it on everything!
