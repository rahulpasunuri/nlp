Recipe calls for EITHER capon or roaster.

I wish more people would follow the recipe. Capon folks, not a "roaster" chicken. Oh and when you're shopping for a capon look for a bird that averages 8lbs. That is the appropriate size for a capon.

Capon was delicious, but the sauce ended up being too bitter. Not sure if was the lemons I used, but it only the drippings that were bitter not the meat itself so will try again.

The reviewer before me must have bought her chicken at the same market. Left everything the same. It was the best chicken/capon I have ever had. My spouse cannot stop raving about.

Bought a 5.5lb Chicken instead of the Capon. Cut all ingredients/time (except for pepper and thyme) by two-thirds, and turned out the most moist, best tasting bird i've ever cooked/tasted. Seriously..

This is one of the best chickens I've ever had. I used an 8 1/2 lb. roasting chicken and made it to take to a friend. It smelled so good I didn't want to give it away. Got rave reviews, so I made it again the next night. I skipped the currant jelly - I just ran the drippings through a gravy strainer to remove the fat. AMAZING!

This was really really good! II too made it with a roasting chicken. I didn't have red currant jelly (which I think would be ideal )so I used black currant jelly which I had, instead. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It was worth all the work. This is an outstanding recipe.

while the capon cooled for 20-30 minutes, I roasted fingerling potatoes in some of the butter/drippings. mmmmmm.

Moist, lemony and fabulous! I love lemon and this really delivered on the lemon flavor, both in the meat and the gravy. The finished bird looked amazing on the platter with the thyme sprigs and roasted lemon -- will certainly make again just as the recipe is written!

This is also an excellent recipe for turkey. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I basically tripled the recipe, but used about two tablespoons of thyme, an equal amount of fresh sage, and a teaspoon or so of fresh tarragon. Also added more of the red current jelly to the sauce, like others have. Turned out moist and delicious! Made soup from the leftover frame, with the herbs and lemon adding a fantastic flavor and aroma. This one is a keeper!!!

FABULOUS! Crisp on the outsdie, juicy on the inside -- what everyone wants, but is often hard to achieve. I served it with butter glazed heirloom carrots and mashed potatoes ... everyone raved ... will be making it again this weekend, but this time will serve it with butternut squash risotto (another great Epicurious recipe!) ... by the way, don't change a thing -- make it exactly as is and you won't be sorry.

This was very good and relatively simple. I really liked the citrus flavor in the sauce.

DELICIOUS!! Made it with an 8-lb. chicken (capon was too expensive for me), followed the recipe to the letter, and it came out beautifully! Make sure you truss the bird, as it really does make a difference. I served it at a dinner party with the spring vegetables with lemon, mache salad with pears and parmesan (both from this site), wild/basmati rice blend cooked in chicken broth, and lemon panna cotta with blackberry sauce (from this site) for dessert. It was the PERFECT spring menu! Everything had lemon in it, but nothing was over-powering.

This was the first capon I've prepared and it turned out beautifully. Our house guests loved the dinner and the leftovers were even better (save the gravy). Capon have a little more flavor than a chicken which is beautifully accented by this recipe.

Really good, solid chicken recipe. Loved the lemon flavor-- not too heavy, subtle and just right. I threw root vegetables in the pan and they also picked up the good flavor. Didn't use the jelly in the gravy, but still good...

Too easy and too wonderful. Great dinner for a work night. Served to guests on a Wednesday night to rave reviews.

My husband and I love this! Have made it several times- recently just for the two of us on Sundays to have good leftovers during the week!!

Never before has a chicken received so much praise. No one could get enough. And I've never had one turn out so tender. I followed everything to the "T" expect that I upped the temp to 400 halfway through and reduced the cooking time by close to 15 minutes. I like the higher temp toward the end to brown the skin more.

This was very good...my grumpy in-laws loved it! The sauce, I did have to add 2 more teaspoons of the red currant jelly, then it was tastier. Thank you EPICURIOUS for a wonderful THANKSGIVING!!!

Would rate 3.5 forks after minor adjustments. Used 2 - 4# fryers to prepare this recipe. Took apprx. 90 mins. in 375C convection oven. Will increase thyme as flavor wasn't pronounce enough even using fresh from my garden. Finely minced garlic would be excellent also. LOVED THIS SAUCE! Served with beautifully carmelized oven roasted potatoes, carrots, and onions prepared with skimmed fat from pan. Terrific comfort food. Easy to prepare and absolutely delicious. Leftover breast meat was great in a salade nicoise.

This was an amazing dinner. I made the capon (2, actually, for 16 people), and everyone RAVED! Very easy preparation and amazing results.

We used a roaster instead of a capon--came out very well. The lemons added such a wonderful different taste. The sauce was grand. Not too difficult to prepare.

A delicious result. We used a roaster instead of a capon, which substituted just fine. I especially liked the pan sauce, with just the right touch of lemon. Wonderful leftovers.

I used chicken instead of capon-- the results were delicious. The meat was not as lemony as I thought it would be.... much more mellow, but still great. Beautiful presentation!
