This recipe is so easy and so delicious. I've always loved horseradish mayo on a steak or roast beef sandwich but the croissant puts it over the top. A little tip for the onions though, when just about cooked add a pinch of sugar. It gives them a little something extra that will make people go hmmmm what's in these sandwiches. Will definately make these again.

This was pretty tasty. I made the horseradish mayo to my taste and not the recipe, so I thought it was just right. I didn't think the croissant was necessary, because I couldn't taste it and I wanted a sturdier bread.

This is very tasty. It is pretty hard to eat, as it falls apart. But I would make again. I did use sweet onion and used regular, rather than shiitake mushrooms. It's a great way to use left over steak!

Not that great...the onion instructions were off, the horsradish sauce was too mild and everything just ended up a gooey mess. The use of the croissant was the biggest mistake - better off as a cold sandwich.

Pretty good, but next time I wouldn't use croissants, and I'd make the horseradish mayo stronger.

I'm an easy kind of eater -- there's not a whole lot I don't enjoy. However, my husband is a bit harder to please and had a huge eyebrow raised when I informed him of the evening's menu. The result? Two spotless plates and a request for the menu to be served often! I served the sandwiches with a side of avocado slices lightly drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with a dash of salt. Enjoy!

We loved this last night. We used rib-eyes on Ciabatta Rolls with Vidalia onons, but everything else was done the same way. The steak was perfectly tender, the earthy richness of the onions and mushrooms was complemented by the tang of the horseradish-mayo and the Ciabatta Rolls were strong enough to hold everything together. I enjoyed it so much that I got up early this morning to eat the one that was left. Yes- we are making the sandwiches again this weekend since the person who got up late was very upset about being cheated out of left-overs. Thank you for a great simple and flavourful recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe for a quick way to make an awesome sandwich. This one got rave reviews at my house!! A keeper for sure. We will be making this again soon!

Yum. Caramelized onions take a long time to be done nicely, but the sandwich is really rich and tasty. This would also be good on nice ciabatta bread. The horseradish is key! Unless you're a Cheez Whiz fan, I guess... hmmm...

I left off the horseradish and added Cheese Whiz -- 4 forks!

Very good. Did not give it four stars because it was a bit rich. Used french bread and flank steak, previously grilled.

I'm hungry just remembering the wonderful taste of this recipe! I was only able to give this recipe 3 stars because (please forgive me!) I used deli-cut roast beef that I warmed in a crock pot of au jus. Served these for a Superbowl party, and everyone absolutely raved about the flavor combination! I agree with the previous review - "heaven on a bun!" This is a keeper!

I'm probably alone, but I thought this was really mediocre. Even with the arugula, there was not enough textural or taste contrast in the sandwich fillings. I might have been less picky except that I just made a similar, but much better sandwich last week (recipe was from Cooking Light); the other recipe added thinly sliced pears & gorgonzola and omitted the mushrooms. Made a world of difference.

All I can say is that this is the best sandwich ever!!!!

Hah! I haven't made this yet, but if you read carefully it allows for one vegetarian and three carnivores to enjoy the meal.

Outstanding! I had steak left over from a barbecue and this recipe was great. I used Walla Walla Sweets (onions grown here in the Northwest) because they are in season. A great meal for a hot day when you don't want to cook.

This sandwich was absolutely wonderful. However I did use crimini mushrooms and no arugala. The carmelized onions and mushrooms made this sandwich. It is also great reheated.

this recipe is ridiculously good and easy to make- we used rib eye steak, which was perfectly juicy. also added a little bacon, which may seem a little over the top, but was really great (as bacon usually is). oh, and we cut the arugula- it really didn't seem to be the type of sandwich that needed something green on it.

Yum, yum and more yum. It gets four forks for combining simplicity and deliciousness. A great way to use up leftover steak. I recommend skipping the beef broth and using red wine or sherry if that's what you're more likely to have on hand. Also, don't bother mixing the mayo and horseradish, just slather it on the bread to combine. Finally I just used button mushrooms and it was fine. I actually thought this recipe was too obvious to be a recipe but then I realized that I'd never made this combination before so I suppressed my snobbery and gave it a shot - yum!

Absolutely wonderful! I don't like beef or horseradish, but I loved this sandwich. We always have some of Sara Moulton's Horseradish Sauce on hand, so we used that instead of the mayo here. I added goat cheese to my sandwich, but my girlfriend had hers just as suggested. It now has "We Could Eat This Every Night" status in our home.

Take Staunton, VA's word on it. These sandwiches are THAT good. Once you've tried them once, you might actually find yourself fantasizing about the next time you can have them again.

Wow! This sandwich could very well be better than ... well, you know. I don't think I've ever had a better sandwich.

this was so good! i reduced the recipe for just 2 people. i used dried chinese mushrooms instead, and i think the intense flavor got a little too strong. will use shiitake instead next time. the horseradish mayonnaise was wonderful!

LOVED this sandwich. It was quick and easy and very tasty and fulfilling. I added a couple pinches of cayenne to the horseradish-mayo for an extra kick. I thought about leaving out the shiitake mushrooms (to avoid another trip to the grocer) but am SOOO glad I added them -- the sandwich benefits from the extra earthiness in flavor.
