This was dull, and I won't make again. It was meant as a low-fat recipe, and that's about the best thing you can say about it!

I really liked this! I left out the jicama, but otherwise followed the recipe and thought it was delicious! I tend to like fruit flavours in my salads though.

Its quite obvious that this recipe sucks

Interesting ingredients but for what it is, a chopped salad, it's too spicy - the other dressing ingredients don't come through. The radish sprouts are very strong.

It was okay. The seasonings and dressing didn't entirely work for me. The apricot was interesting.

multiple spicy/hot tastes competed with each other rather than complimented each other; found the raw onion to be WAY too strong. Good ideas but I think I'd try adding something sweet to help soften/round it out
