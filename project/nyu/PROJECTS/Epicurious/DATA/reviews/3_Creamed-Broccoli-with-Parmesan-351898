yeah, not so great. kept whole broccoli pieces whole, tossed with sauce and baked as some had suggested. Flavors didn't seem to blend.

Very yummy and surprisingly light and fresh tasting, not heavy at all. I used a bit less than 2 lbs of broccoli, an extra Tbs of parmesan, and a little extra salt and lemon. The result tasted more of broccoli than of cream or cheese, which was a good thing for me. I tasted it after the last step in the recipe and it was delicious, but a bit watery. I followed reviewers suggestions and plopped it in a dish, made a topping of parmesan, breadcrumbs, pine nuts and olive oil and baked it to let the flavors meld. The broccoli absorbed the sauce and ended up a bit dry, but very flavorful. If I was making this for company, I'd skip the topping and just make this ahead of time to let it set a bit. The topping makes it taste better, but I think a pile of green would make a better presentation.

We changed this up a little and it was delicious. Followed recipe but added a little more parmesan. Then put it in a casserole dish and made a crust on top using butter crackers, butter, and more parmesan. Baked it til it was golden and bubbly. Yummy!

I made this for Thanksgiving and to be honest, I wasn't thrilled. That was until I put it in my chafing dish and it sat heating for about 30 minutes waiting for my guests to be ready to eat. Then, it all came together really well and people loved it! I would make again but certainly let it set for a while, overnight or bake it for 1/2 hour.

I loved the nutmeg but the final dish turned out a bit soupy. I would throw the whole thing into a casserole dish and bake in the oven with bread crumbs/cheese over top for a little extra texture.

Not bad, not great. Too much nutmeg in mine (I might omit completely), and I added extra cheese for depth. One might be better off to make the creme sauce and pour it over the steamed veggies as the effort to pound the broccoli through the masher wasn't really worth it. Maybe try a hand blender next time?

Superb side dish. Whole nutmeg, freshly grated, added a lovely floral note to the recipe. We used half and half instead of cream which thickened nicely at a slow simmer. A heaping handful of fresh spinach lent the dish both a tender texture and gorgeous color.

I, personally, liked this recipe - but i am a person who likes my vegetables rich sometimes. My boyfriend didn't care for it as much - but that is because he like his broccoli raw and uncooked haha. He didn't hate it, but it wasn't his favorite. I added some toasted pine nuts - thought they added a nice crunch - toasted, sliced almonds would probably be good too. I will make this again - my boyfriend will have to deal...

I didnt like this at all!!! i Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out vile! the texture was disturbing and un apatizing the sauce did not complement the brocile. i was very disapointed and angry that i had to spent money that basicly just ended up in the garbage disposal. i do not recomend this at all!

I think this is better if you poor the cream sauce over broccoli pieces instead of mashing them. I added extra pecorino romano cheese and thickened the sauce with corn starch and then just poured it on the broccoli and it was delicious. Good flavor.

The first thing is you should like broccoli. Also, you should have some fundamentals of cooking under your belt. This dish takes broccoli to another dimension. Follow the recipe and enjoy the dish. Five Stars.

this dish was quite delicious, though I had to up the lemon juice, salt and pepper significantly to get the flavors to 'pop'. It's a great change from the typical steamed broccoli with butter, and not hard to make at all

Love this one, even my 15 month old daughter can't get enough (I usually make it for her, its become a house regular, its the only way I can get her to eat broccoli). Use whole milk instead of cream and double cheese and garlic and put in a bit extra nutmeg, FAB

I made this Saturday night. It was good, but I won;t make it again. I followed the recipe exactly and wondered where the Parmesan cheese evaporated went. We sure didn't taste it.

All this controversy! Well, I would guess a lot of people tried it just because . . . (me included). I also get the feeling that most of the people who are dissing the recipe haven't tried it, which makes it doubly ridiculous that they are even writing. To all of you who think fat is bad, read "Good Calories, Bad Calories" and "The Cholesterol Myths" before you start preaching to - and insulting - other reviewers. Anyway, on to the recipe. I am not impressed. Not enough flavor. I added a few flakes of red pepper, as suggested by one reviewer, and that helped. With the remaining portion, I added a T. of butter. Slight improvement. But I wouldn't make it again just because I didn't particularly care for the flavor. Oh, well, it's still better than any low fat meal I can think of.

Really I dont see what the big deal is. Yes, it has cream and cheese in it. Most things that are good do. This is easy and tasty. Is it healthy? No. Anyone that knows anything about nutrition can tell that from reading the TITLE of the recipe. If you're concerned about calories, just dont make it. Goodness. I for one, will certainly make it again when I'm feeling indulgent.

As a person who has read and contributed comments on this website for maybe a decade or so(?), I've seen this same argument over and over again. Bottom line: The anti-fat nuts don't understand the concept of moderation. Self-deprivation and the creation of anxiety over "forbidden" foods seems less healthy for the mind and body than having the random fatty dish! I do think it's important to be mindful of what you're eating, and mix in the "bad" with a majority of "good" foods.

This is a wonderful recipe, really can be adapted to spinach, etc. I am shocked at the rude comments about fat bellies, high cholesterol, etc. If someone has special dietary needs, fine. Don't impose them on the rest of the world. I don't have a big belly, I'm not overweight, I don't have heart disease or diabetes or high blood pressure or high cholesterol. I'm 55 and I eat what I want to eat and that includes sticks of butter if I choose. I hate low fat whatever. However, I don't impose my tastes on others. This recipe is wonderful, maybe a little more seasoning, if that's what you like.

I have to agree with the cook from Humboldt county. I'm not sure where the rave reviews are coming from, but everyone has their own taste I guess. I'd rather have steamed broccoli with a sprinkle of Parmesan and lemon juice. Simpler, tastier, and by far more healthy.

I was very disappointed in this dish, especially given the several rave reviews. It tasted good (but certainly not great), but I won't bother make it again. I would have rather eaten the broccoli steamed and topped with the lemon and Parmesan and maybe a little butter or oil.

It sounds delicious. I am going to try this recipe because of the vitriol found in too many of the "I know what's best for you" reviews. Such arrogance!! A cook who thinks for herself. 3/15/09

I'm going to try this recipe this week. It's amazing how a bit of broccoli and cream can cause such controversy. Food is one of the wonders of life. Enjoy and embrace it - it is not the enemy. It's all about balance in life. There should be no fear when you pick up your fork!

I really liked this! I generally try not to use heavy cream anymore, but this was a great side-dish treat! I added some hot pepper flakes to spice it up a little. If you are a good cook, you know that it is possible to substitute ingredients sometimes...this is cooking--not baking!

If you don't mind eating half your fat and 1/4 of your total days cholesterol in one little side dish then go ahead. Yes, life is too short with clogged arteries, giant bellies and high blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

Wonderful recipe as written, and with just 276.2 calories; 23.7g total fat; 84.8mg cholesterol; 130.4mg sodium; 12.5g carbohydrates; 4.0g fiber; 2.8g sugar; and 7.1g protein per serving, it is a quite healthy side dish in my opinion. Maybe if Epicurious posted nutritional info WITH the recipes, people would not freak out about ingredients so quickly. FYI: I used DietPro software and the USDA's ingredient data to do my nutritional analysis. Anyone concerned with such matters should have a tool like that. Whoever said 700 calories per serving is VERY misinformed. The entire cup of heavy cream has 821 calories, yes, but the rest of the recipe has negligible calories, and you divide by 4... I hope to see more recipes like this, personally

I liked this. I used *nonfat* half and half, followed the rest of the recipe as written, and topped with toasted pine nuts. Next time I think I'll try some chopped sundried tomatoes on top as well... And BTW, I don't think every recipe has to (or should) be written for people on a diet. It's nice to splurge once in a while, and if you want to make something lower in calories, you can often make substitutions. Take the recipes for their basic ideas and run with them! Please don't diss them just because they don't fit with your dietary requirements. And there's no reason to be rude to people.

This is absolutely delicious! Kind of like old fashioned creamed spinach. I still have some leftovers in the fridge and even the aroma is divine. Great with a steak, chop, fish entree. Would also be good tossed with pasta! And PLEASE, this is a site for NICE people who love food and cooking for those we love. All of you with a political agenda YOU'RE NOT WANTED HERE. There are plenty of other sites where you can be as nasty as you want with a lot of other nasty people. This isn't one of them. GET OUT.

A Cook, Yes, 2 oz per person isn't a lot of cream, but it's a lot of calories and saturated fat. Cream: Whipping, Heavy (37% fat) has 52 calories, 5.6g of fat and 0.4g of carbs in each 1 tbsp (0.5 oz). That makes each serving 208 calories and 22 1/2 grams of fat before you add anything else. The Parmesan adds about 110 more calories and 6 grams of fat. That's nearly 30 grams of fat for one person for one side dish. Sure you can lighten this up, but what's the point in 2009 of putting a recipe like this in a magazine? Sticks of butter dipped in cinnamon sugar taste good too---should we have that recipe next month?

My goodness! All this vitriol over a little old broccoli recipe. I cut the cream portion of the recipe in half, coarse chopped the broccoli and did not mash. Reminiscent of old style chopped spinach served in steak houses. Rich, yummy and okay for most people to eat in moderation once in a while. Calm down please.

A great, fresh tasting recipe for broccoli. I can't have garlic, so I use shallots in this dish. To make it lighter use half and half or even evaporated milk. Of course, the milk won't be nearly as creamy (and probably not taste quite so good either).

This has got to be now in my Top Ten most disgusting dishes ever! It's hard enough to get Kids, even a lot of Adults, to eat Broccoli - but this soggy mess will make even a Broccoli lover run (or get the runs) for the hills. Looks more like something we feed the pigs back on the farm when I was a kid. I believe my dad called it, slop. Oink-oink.
