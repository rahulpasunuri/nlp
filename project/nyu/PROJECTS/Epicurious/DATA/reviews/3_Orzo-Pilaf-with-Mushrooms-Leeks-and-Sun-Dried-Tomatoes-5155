This came together well. I finished it with some cold feta on top (love feta on everything) since it needed a little extra something. The fresh basil really makes it. For those new to dealing with leeks, be sure to rinse them in a collander after chopping. Easy way to chop is to cut lengthwise in half to the root, then turn half way and cut again, then chop.

This was good but not great. I don't know that I would add the balsamic vinegar if I make this again. Lots of flavor but very heavy for a side dish and not really good enough to be a stand-alone entree.

Hubby and I loved this. As the store only had smoked sun-dried tomatoes, I used those instead and they added a wonderful, smokey flavor and depth.

Deeeee-lish. My slight variation was to use a vegetarian broth and just chop up some oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes. The flavors were in perfect balance. The portabellos and leeks are exactly what the orzo wants!

My friend and I made this for our 14th annual Christmas party last year and it got rave reviews! She made it again for her family on Christmas Eve! I will definately make it again.

I made it exactly as written. My guests loved it and asked for the recipe. I would certainly make it again.

I added some sliced shallots, doubled the garlic, and used 1 cup chicken broth, and 1 cup white wine. The dish was very bland, and boring. Not worth trying to fix.

I didn't have the sun-dried tomatoes, but did have some roasted red peppers--combined these to cook with some diced fresh yellow peppers as called for, and the result certainly didn't lack for flavor. Great side dish or even vegetarian entree (using vegetable broth).

My husband and I thought this was excellent! I used plum tomatoes and added asiago cheese shredded and cubed. I also used FRESH basil from my garden. It was one of the best side dishes I have made. I don't agree that it has little taste....we thought it was great!

The first time I made this recipe I followed it exactly and used the balsamic vinegar. I didn't care for the taste so the next time I substituted white vermouth and it was delicous. I think the vermouth brings out the flavor of the other ingredients rather than masking them as the balsamic does. Great served with chicken roll-ups.

What a disappointment to go through all that work and have the finished product be just okay. The combination of ingredients was intriguing, and I like them all, but together with the orzo they just kind of melded into a very dull flavor. I could taste the tomatoes, but not the leeks or the garlic. I'm hoping the other orzo pilaf recipes on this site are better. Definitely would not waste my time or ingredients making this again!

I didn't bake this dish and it still tasted wonderful! I added the balsamic vinegar when I added the mushrooms and garlic, and added a bit of lemon juice and thyme at this point as well.

Hmmm, I don't get it. I didn't change the recipe and I found it dull and "zing"-less. I also didn't like the brownish color that the portobello gives the dish. Maybe button mushrooms would have been better but probably would have imparted less flavor. I prefer the scallions with parm cheese and scallions recipe on this site - easier and I thought tastier.

Very good and very easy. Have made it twice and there is never any left.

This recipe is terrific. I held back on the balsamic vinegar (used 1/2 of recommended) and also added artichoke hearts, corn, oyster mushrooms, brown mushrooms + portabellas and a several kalamata olives. Man...extemely good. I will make this time and time again!

I am a huge orzo fan and I made this dish for a large dinner party of 18. Maybe I did something wrong when tripling the recipe but I found the balsalmic vinegar to really overwhelm the other great flavors in this dish. I would definately cut back or omit the vinegar (I do really like Balsalmic). I also browned the orzo first which gives it a nice flavor. I think also after having experimented with many orzo recipes that I prefer cooking orzo as a risotto style as opposed to baking it.

This dish is really good and not too time consuming. Its very delicious and great with grilled chicken. Definitly prepare with portabello mushrooms they have a great taste. Its fun to make with a partner. I took the left overs on a picnic the next day and it was a big hit!

This is a nice side dish to accompany a pork or a chicken dish. It would be overpowered by a hearty meat dish like a steak. I used baby bella mushrooms which gave it great flavor.

Just made this for dinner this evening and it was just delicious. Very refreshing and filling. I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth and was pleased with the flavor. A nice meatless meal which I served with steamed asparagus and a fruit salad. You won't be disappointed with this dish as a side or meatless main course.
