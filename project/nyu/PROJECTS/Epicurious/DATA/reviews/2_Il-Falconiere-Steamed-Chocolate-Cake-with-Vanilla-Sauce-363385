these fell hard after I took them out of the oven, (i'm at quite a high altitude) and although i put them in for an extra 20 minutes all told, they never lost the gooeyness..(maybe they are supposed to be gooey?) the sauce makes about twice as much as you actually need, even if you drown every cake in sauce. all told, it was still a big hit, and i served it with raspberries which was a nice flavour combo.
