This recipe was easier than I expected. I found all of the ingredients to be just right. I also made a batch with about 3 tablespoons of truffle oil (a favorite) incorporated, the flavor was subtle but gave a little more substance. Either way, the crostini is good enough to eat on it's own! I topped some with an asiago and olive spread and others with the pepper beef tenderloin from this site.

instead of plain kosher salt, add citrus salts - orange and lemon lime.(equal parts "bone dry" zest pulverized and mixed with kosher salt). nice holiday touch.
