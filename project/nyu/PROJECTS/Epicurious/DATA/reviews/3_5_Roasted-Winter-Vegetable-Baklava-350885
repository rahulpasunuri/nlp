oh, and I also added 1 butternut squash and 2 sweet potatoes.

This a great recipe. My guests had thirds. It was a hit. I followed recommendations and did not use dill, but instead substituted 1 tsp sage and 1 tsp rosemary and added gruyere.

I made some significant changes to this and my guests were begging for the recipe. Among my changes: (1) I used canned Ghee purchased from a Brooklyn international grocer instead of olive oil for the phyllo. If you don't have ghee, use butter. In my experience olive oil & phyllo is a waste of phyllo. They're only 8 sheets of Phyllo, so it's not as much ghee/butter as you might think. (2) I added butternut squash to the veggies. (3) I used less dill and less fennel fronds. I added two T. of sage. (4) I used a convection oven otherwise the veggies wouldn't have cooked in 40 minutes. (5) I added three monster garlic cloves finely minced to the veg mixture (6) I sprinkled a little bit of gruyere on the top of the veggies. (7) I didn't crinkle the phyllo on top. Nor did I make two "purses." I simply slung down four layers on the bottom and four on the top.

This recipe was just okay. It was extremely dry. Butternut squash mashed in with the vegetables would add moisture and help bind the ingredients together. A little more spice is needed as well.

Excellent as a main dish! Loved it! i didn't think about cheese, but I'm sure it would be good too. My kids also loved it! It was very filling and didn't miss the meat.

Absolutely delicious. I used savory walnuts which had been roasted with rosemary, so I substituted the dill in the vegies with dried rosemary and thyme. I also used sweet potatoes instead of yellow. Everyone loved it....will definitely make again.

This was delicious, filling, and presents beautifully right out of the oven. I used toasted hazelnuts because that's what i had, and they were great, and goat cheese sounds nice but gruyere was fantastic. i shredded a good layer on after half the veggies and again after the second half. Also used sage, rosemary, and a bit of dill but not nearly as much as it called for. 3 minced cloves garlic really added to it as well-i mixed them in w/the herbs before the second baking. This was worth the time and effort!

This was wonderful. I made it as directed, but I also added some seasoned feta cheese, which gave it a bit of a punch. I also seasoned the veggies with thyme, sage and rosemary (all fresh) while they were roasting, which gave them great flavor. I think I forgot the dill, but since I'm not a fan, I don't think I missed out on anything.

First of all I used pecans (which I toasted) in place of walnuts (which we don't care for). Since there's just 2 of us we decided to make just half the veg, but forgot to put in the onion. Wondering how we would cut it out of a dish into 2 halves after cooking led to the idea of packaging it up into two phyllo "purses" full of veg. As well I liked the suggestion about goat cheese so we crumbled up 2 oz of that & tossed it around with the veg before cooking in the phyllo. This was my first time with phyllo so I felt like my purses were a big, shredding mess, but they cooked up fine & held together nicely and looked great after baking about 15 min at 425F. The whole thing was very tasty but surprisingly filling. I would make it again and would not change what I did, unless I decided to change the herb for variety (say, to thyme).

I wanted to make the dish more of a main course than a side so I added shredded chicken to the mix. I didn't have dill so I used some fresh rosemary and thyme. It was a spectacular fall dish. I especially loved the walnut mixture.

Was a little disappointed. Took a lot longer than recommended to roast vegetables. Lacked seasoning and was dry. The puff pastry, after the whole dish was done, was dry and tasted like paper mache. I added 8 ounces of goat cheese to inhance the dish after reading all of the reviews. It was still, not very good. Would recommend some sort of cream sauce...or creamed vegetables...

I served this last night at a New Years Eve dinner and it was a big hit. I added about a half pound of sweet potatoes and used more crumpled Phyllo on top. It was heated for the last cooking (along with other things in the oven) at a temp lower than 425 and worked fine. I was happy that it could all be put together in the afternoon and hold well until the final baking several hours later.

It had very little flavor and was a lot of work.

The flavors worked together wonderfully; this turned out to be a very savory, wintery, vegetarian meal - one would never miss the meat in this, even if they're not a vegetarian.

A good fall/winter vegetarian entree: the parsnips and fennel were delicious in combination with stand- by roasted potatoes and carrots. I didn't have dill on hand, but I didn't miss it after adding extra chopped fennel stalks. The only downside was that refrigerating leftovers made the phyllo dough pretty soggy and unappealing, so best to finish it off in one sitting. I will follow other reviewers' advice and try it with some goat cheese next time.

I give this 3.5 stars...it was really good. A couple things I did differently. Couldn't find parsnips so just doubled the carrots. Used more bread crumbs than called for and then forgot to layer them in the dough so I just dusted them on the bottom and up the sides of the phyllo lined dish and stirred the rest into the roasted veggies. Also first put a layer of veggies over the phyllo and dotted it with some crumbled goat cheese that I had on hand, then more veggies and the rest of the goat cheese. It was delicious.

There is already a proper name for savory dishes made by layering something with phillo dough: Börek! Sometimes, when recipe writers are a)trying to be creative b)haven't researched enough, they come up with weird stuff.

This was outstanding! The flavors of the vegetables melded together with the phyllo into one comforting winter dish. Like the cook below mentions, the bits of dough on top did cook quickly - just keep an eye on the baklava while it's cooking. I replaced the dill with thyme. Be on the generous side when buying vegetables - I wished that there had been a little more filling. Any winter veggies would go great in this - butternut squash, and maybe even a hardy green like swiss chard. Yum!

This was a nice light but earthy dish. I did add some crumbled feta before closing up the phyllo. I recommend covering the decorative phyllo on the top with foil--these wispy bits burn very quickly.
