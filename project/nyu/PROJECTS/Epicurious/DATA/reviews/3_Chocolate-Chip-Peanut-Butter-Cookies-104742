Yum! I love chocolate and peanut butter together and these cookies did not disappoint! I used all ingredients as listed and followed instructions to a T. Cookies came out perfect, so I don't know what the fuss is all about. I'm adding this recipe to my recipe box!

This has got to be the WORST cookie recipe I have ever made. I too increased the Peanut butter to a cup, used a a 1/3 of cup less flour, and they were still BLAND BLAND BLAND! DONT bother with this recipe. What a waste of ingredients.

I wanted to make peanut butter chocolate chip cookies and came to Epicurious. I had never had a bad outcome before. I saw the reviews and still decided to give it a try. I will say that since I do gluten free baking, I always have to make adjustments but for ordinary cookies my substitutions work just fine. I followed the recipe minus the peanuts and peanut butter chips. I noticed right away that the dough seemed drier than usual but proceeded to make the coookies. As stated in the previous review, they did not spread out at all when they baked and with the exception of some browning on the edges, they looked like a lump of cookie dough even though they had baked for 12 minutes. after I removed the batch of cookies, I flattened the dough for the next two sheets. I'm at a loss to figure out how to make the recipe work and you't think someone at Epicurious might have tested the recipe before posting it.

Just made these and was a little hesitant because of the bad reviews. I only made a half batch, but followed the directions exactly. The dough was oily and didn't hold together very well. When I added the chocolate chips they barely stayed in the dough. I recommend decreasing the amount of chocolate chips, adding the extra peanut butter, and when forming the balls, pushing a few extra chocolate chips into the dough before putting it on the cookie sheet. I was also surprised to see that they didn't spread out while baking. I took them out before they looked completely done and they turned out just fine. Not too sure if I would make them again.

I usually make peanut butter cookie packages for the holidays (http://imunchie.com/filomena0803/munchies/old-fashioned-peanut-butter-cookies) and this looks like it might be an upgrade to the ones I usually make! I will have to try it out!

What a boring cookie! I didn't have peanut butter chips, so I did as others suggested and increased the peanut butter. The dough seemed really dry from the start, and sure enough, it produced a dry and boring cookie. Wouldn't waste the ingredients on this one again.

As some others have done, we too modified the recipe a smidgen. Instead of the peanuts and peanut butter chips, we rounded the amount of creamy peanut butter to a full cup. Also, when cooking, we noticed it too a minute or two passed ten minutes. Just make sure you watch them yourself. Don't count on a timer to know when things are done. With our changes and slight timing difference in cooking, the result was some quite delicious cookies.

Very good. Moist, soft and delicious. I didn't add peanut butter chips or nuts, just the 2 cups of semi-sweet chips. Not sure how they could turn out bad. I baked them 350, ten minutes. They didn't 'look' done, but I took them out anyway and let them rest on the cookie sheet for a few minutes, then transferred them to a cooling rack. My kids loved them.

I changed the recipie to what some other reviewers said, and the cookies came out delicious. I omitted the peanut butter chips and peanuts, and put in just short of a cup of creamy peanut butter. I also found that 10 minutes was not enough baking time,and so baked the cookies for 11 minutes. They came out moist, and were not at all dry like other reviewers said. These cookies were fantastic, and I will be making them again.

i don't even know what to say other than "these peanut butter hockey puck cookies are horrible." i have made my fair share of chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter cookies, and countless other cookies and these are *perhaps* this worst cookies that i have ever tasted. even my boyfriend who has a sweet tooth the size of north america refused to eat these dry, bland pucks. and don't think that i am one of those people who reviews the recipe after added all of their modifications like, "well, the recipe says to add 1 tsp of this and instead i added 3 Tbs. of that and this other thing and splenda, yada yada yada." not the case. followed the recipe to a T. tweaked the baking times in hopes of them becoming more moist. total waste of time and ingredients. these cookies = epic fail.

This recipe does not taste good. I followed the recipe exactly as described and the cookies came out very dry. I don't recommend this one.....

I made these cookies taking into account some of the other reviews. Rather than mix the chocolate chips into the dough, as I was rolling the dough into balls, I would add 4 or 5 chips to each ball. I also didn't use the peanut butter chips or the peanuts, but both my boyfriend and I liked them. He's just mad I made them for other people to eat... not just him. :)

We omitted the peanut butter chips and peanuts, but it was still really good. We needed to bake it longer than the recipe said. I would make this again!

I thought they were excellent! (well, the one's i ate. my parents and some friends "didn't know where they went" when they "disappeared") I added a whole cup of chunky peanut butter and didn't add peanuts. also threw in some nutmeg and cinnamon. but as a base, they were great. and REALLY easy.

I didn't have any peanut chips or peanuts, so I did a bit of improvising. I only used 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips and about 4/5 of a cup of peanut butter. I ended up with 40 delicious cookies!

I love these cookies! I made them without peanuts and with 1 whole cup of peanut butter. I used dark chocolate chips, and because of previous reviewers comments, I only added ~1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips, which is more than other reviewers suggested, but less than the recipe calls for. I actually increased the number of peanut butter chips to 3/4 cup and it worked out well. Otherwise I followed the recipe. They're very rich, but totally delicious. Everyone who tried them loved them. Highly recommended!

Yes as others have said this is very bland and floury. Maybe, as someone suggested, substituting corn syrup in for the sugar would help, but considering that the recipe has other obvious flaws (the nut/ peanut butter chip issue) it's probably better to just find a different recipe.

I made the recipe exactly as written and found it neither bland nor overly laden with chips. But, maybe because of all the chips and peanuts, the cookies did not spread much. They were cute little round nuggets rather than large flat cookies.

I dont understand why everyone thinks these are so great. Honestly coming from a person who cooks for a living these are not that good. Never should have strayed from good old grandma's recipe. If you like bland cookies go for it.

Delicious cookies. We omitted the peanut butter chips and peanuts as well and they came out very well. We flattened some of the cookie dough, and left others in the balls to make for chunkier-type cookies.

Very good firm cookie. However, I generally like mine a bit doughier. I made them without the peanuts or peanut-butter chips, and I'm not sure how the dough could have held them since the 2 cups of choco-chips seemed like too much already.

Very good and easy to bake - I'm nine. The dough was yummy too. We left out the peanuts and the peanut butter chips.

These cookies are full of flavor and are perfect for satisfying my twin cravings for peanut butter and chocolate. I halved the amount of chips as recommended by a few previous reviewers and I'm very glad I did. These cookies are not too hard or crumbly as peanut butter cookies can sometimes get. I will make them again many times.

These are great. I didn't find them very peanut-y after baking them - this might change the next day. Although I didn't put in the peanuts since I didn't have any. I used corn syrup (brown sugar hardened on me)which was a good substitue - made the cookies very chewy. I subbed Hershey pieces for the chocolate chips, pressing a square into each cookie after rolling them into balls. I increased the pb chips since I didn't use as much chocolate. It made exactly 50 decent-sized cookies. Ten minutes baking time was plenty in my oven.

The recipe calls for about twice the chips that the dough can reasonably hold. Very good when fresh from the oven, dry and crumbly later on (although that's just how most people like their p.b. cookies).

Great recipe. I used 1/2 cup of choc chips and 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips because I thought the recipe called for too many chips. I also made the cookies about double in size and baked for 9 minutes.....AWESOME!

I really don't know what these other reviewers are talking about. I thought this was a terrible recipe. The cookies came out dry and bland.

I agree with the other reviewers - these cookies only need to be baked for 8 minutes. They come out perfectly. I also left out the nuts and I agree there were too many chips. But overall, very deeeeeelicious cookies

Searched and searched for a recipe like this. (I Left out the chopped nuts though) These are hard to leave alone. My husband is a picky cookie eater, and he loved these. I forsee this cookie recipe becoming a regular at our house.

Watch the time on these cookies. Too long and you will get really crunchy cookies. I used chunky peanut butter and left out the additional peanuts and chips. Thise cookies do not spread-so use a fork to flatten. I cut a reese's penaut butter cup in fourths and placed in the middle of cookie-- Yumm. TUrned a somewhat bland cookie into a treat.

An excellent recipe. I never let cookies cook as long as a recipe indicates in case they end up dry and crunchy. I left these in for about 8 minutes, and they seemed to come out perfectly. Additionally, I only put in a fraction of the chips. Too much chocolate takes away from the fact that it's a cookie, not a truffle. It's a good idea too if you shape the cookies with the palm of your hand before they bake. That way they come out looking as you would wish.

This recipe was alright. I would make it again for kids who don't really care what anything tastes like. I cut the chocolate chips in half and left out the peanuts. When I make cookies I either make them to take to something or to have a little something sweet. These are definately not a little something sweet. Pretty bland

Rating: 3
These were really good!! Deffantly make again!!! Only thing I would do to change them for the better would be. There were to many cho. chips and peanut butter chips and peanuts. A major cut down on the cho. chips would be best. It calls for 2 cups, next time I'm putting in 1 or 1 1/2 cups. You begin to wonder where the dough is!! That was what some one said to me when they picked a cookie up with very little dough on it. :) But otherwise Yummmmm!!!!!

These cookies are great. I would definately make them again. They also taste better when cooked for 12 minutes.

I will definitely make these yummy cookies again, but I will decrease the amount of chocolate chips. For the amount of dough this is way too many chips (and I didn't use the peanut butter chips or the peanuts!) At the end, I ended up with a bowl full of chocolate chips in a little bit of dough.

Rating: 3
I thought these cookies were very good and very easy to make. I guess my cookies were too big, because I only made 27 (versus 40 - 50) cookies with the above batch. Be sure to have milk on hand when eating because the peanut butter in the cookies tends to clog the throat.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I wondered if there was a mistake in the sugar quantities for the recipe as the dough was bland and not sweet enough. I looked up another PB cookie recipe and it had twice the sugar so I dumped in another cup and gave my Kitchenaid a hernia trying to mix it in with all the other goodies. The next tray of cookies was passable, but not great. I found the cookies to also be a bit greasy. This may have been caused by adding the additional sugar, but I won't make the recipe again to find out!
