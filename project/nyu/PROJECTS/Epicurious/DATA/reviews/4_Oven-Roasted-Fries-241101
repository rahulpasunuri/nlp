Most folks don't realize this, but this is largely based on an old Weight Watchers recipe...add dried herbs and/or spices to taste and you've got a fairly easy side dish that's low in points based on your portion size....I only know this because my ex's mother was a WW gal and used this all the time

Excellent and easy. I second the idea of using olive oil, and different spices/herbs to make it interesting.

Really good base recipe, but boring as written. i made mine with part peanut and part olive out and homemade emeril's essence. SO good.

the best oven fries I've ever made. Who knows why since it's so simple. I used a silpat mat underneath the fries and used a canola/olive oil mix. I cut the fries fairly thin, so I only needed 35 minutes. I made these with the turkey burgers from Get a Real Life food on this site and the cabbage and corn slaw with cilantro and orange dressing (also on this site) for healthier playoff/super bowl party eats.

Perfect. Easy and foolproof. Used coarse salt and olive oil. Nice change from Yukon Golds or red potatoes.

Fantastic. Perfect every time. I like these best with Yukon Gold potatoes, and they are also stellar with sweet potatoes.

The review recommending convection for 15 min is correct. They turn out perfectly crisp and not overdone. I used the olive oil, and added crushed garlic, rosemary and thyme. Excellent

We use this often, but salt the wedges first and roast in our convection oven.

Great side for various stews. Served it with boeuf Burgouinon to our guests delight.

I have made 3 times now using some of the suggestions from previous posts. I used parchment paper to line the pan - no sticking and easy clean up. I also tossed with peanut oil. In my convection oven - they only took about 15 minutes to brown nicely. Very easy and delicious.

Made these fries tonight for the first time and loved them. I never make real fries for health reasons, but I'll definitely make these again. I spiced them up somewhat since I once heard Oprah's former personal chef say oven fries need more spice for lack of fat flavor. She suggested garlic, cayenne pepper, chili powder, or dried herbs such as rosemary or thyme, but hers were made with egg white for crunch and I didn't really like the technique (clean-up was a killer). Long story short, these are great but don't hesitate to use your own seasonings to add zip.

I mix mine in a bowl with salt, pepper, and rosemary and thyme - sometimes a little garlic.

Try adding cumin with the salt and pepper. Fantastic.

We love this recipe and have been making it for years. I have found that Canola oil leaves a bitterness that is unpleasant. I use olive oil instead and do not notice the bitter taste. I keep an eye on the potatoes after about 35 minutes because if you have some thinner-cut ones on the pan, you'll have true crispy critters after 45 minutes!

I also enjoy this healthy version of Fries. I experiment everytime and never had a bad result. Dill and salt are exellent. Also try your favorite grill rub spices. When making fried potatoes on stove top, add chopped green onion toward the finish. So good.

I too have been making these for years. I prefer peanut oil, and always preheat the pan, then lightly brush it with oil once hot as I distrust the propellants in Pam. Fabulous, and especially good with sweet potatoes or fingerling potatoes.

I also have been making these for years with canola oil. I always line my baking sheet with parchment and I prefer cooking them on convection, It seems to make them so nice and crispy. So yummy with lots of sea salt and cold ketchup!

I cut the potatos in rounds instead of wedges. cooked at suggested temperature and they cooked in about 20 - 25 minutes. Used bread, Dijon mustard and sliced onions and made great potato sandwiches.

I've made versions of these for years using olive oil, but this recipe beats them all. I think it's the canola oil and the high temperature that make these lighter and crisper. Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper elevate these above mere fries.

This is how I always make "Fries" the healthy way. As epimom suggested, peanut oil makes them taste like boardwalk fries or you can save some time and just spritz them with the canola oil cooking spray for the same results. Slightly smaller fries, more 1/3" than 1/2" tend to taste more like their fried counterparts and get less oven dried.

Perfect! Used garlic salt - recommend it highly.

Yes, simple and delicious. I,too, have been making this basic recipe for years. My advice would be to line your pan with parchment (if you don't have a silpat) and experiment with olive oil. Also, just a question to the previous poster: why would you put artificial sweetener in this? I'm not sure I see the appeal of making this dish sweet other than using sweet potatoes as another reviewer mentioned.

Rating: 4
Simple and tasty! I added a little rosemary, crushed garlic, and a packet of artificial sweetener to the mixture. The additional sugar requires flipping every 10 minutes or so, but they brown up nicely. For a zippy dip, mix a few teaspoons of mayonnaise and dijon mustard and a dash of chipotle seasoning--Delish!

I have made a similar recipe for years and love love love them. I have a couple pieces of advice when making these. First, turn the fries midway during the cooking so they brown on both sides. Second, a silpat is very very helpful in preventing the fries from sticking to the pan. Third, try using peanut oil instead of canola for a "boardwalk fries" taste. Good luck!

What's not to like? It's easy and delicious. Also grilled sweet Maui onions to serve with!

I made this with the garlic and parsley topping for New Years Eve. It was a big hit-- fries were crispy without being greasy and the topping made it special enough to serve to company.

great recipe. very succesful at our dinner party. the garlic aioli is a must with this.

Really great and easy recipe. Better than deep fried versions. I used sweet potato and cut the fries slightly smaller, and reduced the cooking time to about 35 minutes. They were great.
