It tastes good but the texture is mushy. I am not sure why. I did not boil the kale, I fried it with the onions and fresh peppers which should have less liquid. not more?

I forgot to add, that I did not boil and drain the kale. I just chopped it fine and sauteed for a few minutes to wilt before adding onions and other ingredients. Also, mine never really got brown on top. It tasted better not being brown. I left it in too long, and then it got slightly too dry (we all had a slice before it browned, being starved, and that was better).

This was good. Coming from someone who LOVES baked cheese grits, I certainly missed the butter. But, it was a nice, healthy way to use some Kale from my garden. That said, I would NOT make it on a weeknight again. What a lot of work and dishes. Took way longer than I expected. Go ahead and add all the hot sauce, it was mild enough for even kids.

Great side dish, nice looking too with the different colors. Next time will use extra garlic and cheese.A lot of possibilities for variations. Serves a large crowd as a side dish.You can cook and drain the kale, then use the same pot to sautee the onion/garlic/peppers then use the same pot to boil the milk.

I wanted a way to use leftover fresh kale other than the usual saute or soup, and this worked nicely. I steamed the kale instead of boiling. Also, since my husband doesn't like red peppers, I used sun-dried tomatoes in oil instead. I used a round 2-qt. baking dish fro half the recipe. Half the recipe easily makes six generous helpings.

I loved this and my kids even ate it. It actually would have nicely served 12 as a side dish. I used well-chopped tender lacinato kale, and so skipped the boiling step (saved one pan!). Then by switching the order I saved another pot: first cooked the cornmeal mixture in a 6 qt. non-stick pot, and while it cooled used a round 12" x 3" lidded oven-proof non-stick skillet to saute the onions, fresh pepper and garlic and then wilt the kale. By mixing the eggs in the same 4-cup measuring cup already used for the milk etc., and mixing some of the hot cornmeal into that, then using the 6 qt. pan for the final mixing, the 12" skillet was available for the baking and no extra dishes had to be washed! Even in my runs-hot convection oven it took 45 minutes to be done, so perhaps the softness issues were from under baking. And yes, extra cheese!

This recipe was really good. I substituted pepper jack for the cheddar and hot sauce with excellent results. I also used fresh corn cut off the cob. A crowd pleaser

Halved the recipe and used a 9" pie pan. The consistency was good --- soft and just able to hold some shape in a slice. Next time, I'll use more peppers, more cheese (it was just barely detectable, and I'd like it a bit bolder), and not boil the kale as long (went only 8 minutes, but a good portion of the flavor still went down the drain with the water). This recipe does use a lot of pots, but the steps are all simple.

I used Monterey Jack, but I think pepper jack and no red pepper sauce would be tastier. I liked the loose and moist consistency, which might be the result of letting the cornmeal sit in the milk and water a long time. This recipe needs salt and pepper. It's a large recipe and uses many large pots, but for a potluck it would be perfect, because the food stays warm a LONG time.

I'm not sure if I did in fact measure everything correctly, but the texture was a bit mushy: the consistency of mashed potatos. I couldn't find roasted red peppers in a jar, so I just sauteed fresh ones. It could be an excellent vegetarian main dish if served with a warm bean salad or the like. When I make it again, I will add another kind of cheese (perhaps monterey jack) and perhaps chopped red chilies instead of the red pepper sauce.
