This recipe is a favorite of mine but I make one modification, i add red wine, usually when I put in the vinegar. Even without the tomatoes, it already tastes divine!

Excellent. Unique. Flavorful. Made as directed, wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious -- the balsamic and rosemary give it a sort of woodsy taste, and it's fast and easy to make.

Wow! I thought this was terrific!! I only made minor changes - for tomatoes chose diced roasted (Muir Glen) tomatoes, and used Barilla Plus penne pasta in lieu of pappardelle. Cut down the balsamic by a hair. Cooked it for an hour or more. Served it with a "modern Waldorf salad" (from this web site), and my sweetie was full & happy. As was I.

Been holding on to a box of Cipriani pappardelle for months and this was the perfect recipe to use it. Makes oodles of delicious ragu. Arugula adds a nice counterpoint. Made with portabello mushrooms but will change to cremini next time. Yummy

A simple satisfying dish and a great way to use up arugula that has lost its crispness. I didn't have pappardelle, so used bowtie pasta, and that worked very well. Threw the pasta in the sauce and let it simmer a minute before adding the arugula until it just wilted. Topped with some parmesan, this was a very tasty dish and a great weeknight meal.

Have made twice now and it was delicious both times. This time added some toasted breadcrumbs that I had in the freezer, which thickened the sauce nicely. Also, pulsed the rosemary with the garlic and mushrooms, which saved time. The sequence of chicken, then onion, then mushrooms, then vinegar, then finally tomato sauce serves to clean the pot over the course of the steps.

Makes a gorgeous dish and very easy to make. Impress your guests!

Delicious. Added a bit of crushed red pepper because we like spice, but the flavors melded nicely. Agree that you can cut back the oil just a bit. I couldn't get my hands on arugula and tested it out with spinach. Might have lost a bit of the bitter profile, but the spinach pretty much melted in and added some nutrients. My dude loved this.

I have been making this dish since it was published in October, 2008. I am quite surprised by any negative reviews - this has turned out beautifully every time I have made it. Cremini mushrooms do enhance the flavor and meld well with the chicken thighs. Also, pappardelle really does work best - try Trader Joe's

Really easy, quick and very tasty. We loved this dish! Changes to recipe were: did not pulse mushrooms (I used portabella), but did pulse the garlic along with the onions. I used chicken breast meat, but am sure the thighs would have been just as good. So I cooked the onion/garlic mixture together, then added the mushrooms, which I finely sliced, at the time the rosemary, salt & pepper are added. Since I had some, I also added some torn proscuitto when the chicken and tomatoes get added in, and used a mixture of rocket (aka arugula) and fresh basil, again simply because I had some!

A little surprised by the less than overwhelming reviews. I made this last night using far less oil than called for, and a bit less arugula and pasta (don't need all those carbs). It was absolutely delicious. I did let it simmer slowly about 30 minutes which I believe helped blend the flavors. My husband I thought this was a real keeper.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written, and it was a total waste of time. I had to throw it out. It looked like and tasted like mush with tomatoes. The house smelled like vinegar and the ragu tasted a little like that too. Of all the ragu recipes out there, this has got to be at the bottom of the list. My advice is to look for something else.

Very good. Made it with ground pork instead of chicken thighs.

very tasty! i changed it a little bit according to the ingredients i had on hand, but the rosemary and the balsamic vinegar really made this dish. i omitted the arugula, but threw in some carrots to add something else, and i used shells instead of pappardelle. i'll definitely try this again with the original list of ingredients!

I was expecting a lot, but frankly, I was underwhelmed. It was OK. But not more. I had the ingredients on hand, which is why I made it. But I won't bother again.

I made this recipe with homemade pasta that melted in our mouths. Also I didn't have chicken, but we did have chicken apple sausage which was great with it. I didn't have a 28 oz can of tomatoes so I put in a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and diced 2 organic tomatoes and it worked great. I also used white button mushrooms and not crimini, so the sauce was probably milder or lighter than usual, but it was definitely a hit. I don't know that it will become a regular rotation because homemade pasta can be time consuming, but it will be a monthly.

Very tasty and a great weekday dish. Do increase the garlic to give it some punch.

Really tasty dish. As long as you get all the prep done ahead, it comes together very quickly. Like other reviewers, I used a can of diced tomatoes in juice, and it was fine. One warning: for my family's taste, there was too much sauce for the amount of noodles, so I froze about 1/4 of it minus the arugula.

Delicious and easy for a weeknight. Modified the recipe to use pantry/fridge items: white mushrooms, dried rosemary, two cans diced tomatoes, farfalle, swiss chard. But I think I still captured the spirit of the dish, and it was fantastic.

Rating: 3
Very simple with a lot of taste! Like the cook from Brooklyn, all I had on hand were dried wild mushrooms, so rehydrated in chicken stock and strained liquid & added with tomatoes. Forgot to reduce the balsamic, so added a bit more to sauce to bring up the taste, and with all the others, added more garlic. Added good dash of red pepper flakes and good parm at serving time. Easy to make and very easy to substitute ingredients to your own liking and pantry availability!

Love this recipe! We have made this a few times, first time exactly followed recipe. Changes I would make to make it even easier and just as flavorful are; use diced tomatoes instead of whole. Saves on a big mess. Dice mushrooms and garlic by hand. Make day before if possible. Flavors meld together and are delicious!!

I made this recipe last night, and it was delicious. The only thing I would do differently is maybe use pancetta or another meat instead of the chicken, which was slightly bland. I used four cloves of garlic and used cremini and shittake mushrooms. I might also use diced tomatos instead of whole ones, as it was a little difficult to break up the whole ones. I'd definitely make this again.

delicious! i didn't use a food processor, just finely diced the mushroom and garlic. i also added extra balsamic and it was perfect. because i didn't have pappardelle, i used bow tie pasta and it turned out great!

This recipe is great for a quick during the week meal. I did the recipe as stated but I replaced half of the arugula with spinach in an effort to please my kids. It worked, they loved it. Also I didn't have any pappardelle noodles so I used orechiette, which scooped up the sauce very nicely. Great!

Delicious! I made some alteration based on others' reviews and my own taste: 3x the garlic, and extra shot or two of balsamic vinegar, 1/2 spinach 1/2 arugula. My family and I loved it.

Epic win! We used a lot less arugula.

nice flavors to this quick and easy dish. I used spinach instead of arugula and whole wheat fettucine instead of pappardelle because that's what I had on hand. I'd definitely feed this to company.

I thought this was a delicious and very easy weeknight dinner. I chopped the mushrooms and garlic by hand rather than putting them in the processor. Added the garlic to the onions and then put in the mushrooms after onions/garlic were soft. I used the vinegar but also added about a cup of red wine. The sauce was very hearty and flavorful. My kids and husband loved it. Will definitely make this again. Perhaps will serve over polenta next time.

Had this for dinner last night and my husband and I really liked it.Other than a little chopping it is quite simple and quick to make. All the flavors blended nicely. I followed the recipe to a 'T' (a little more garlic) but forgot the the cheese:(

This recipe was very easy. I have made it with chicken breast meat instead of thigh. I too used spinach in place of arugula. Tonight I am going to try it with pork sausage instead of the chicken to give it more zip.

I made this last night, and it turned out to be a yummy weeknight dinner. I followed the process closely, however, I did not use exact measurements- I'm more of a guestimate and season by taste cook. Instead of fresh creminis, I used rehydrated mixed wild mushrooms (from costco I believe), and when I added the tomatoes I also added the leftover mushroom broth and gave it a little extra time to simmer down. I also didn't process the mushrooms, I roughly chopped them for a chunkier texture. I will make it again!

Somewhat bland for all the things put into it...tastes mostly like balsamic vinegar.

This has the potential to be bland, but add extra salt, pepper and triple the garlic and its really delicious. I also did 8oz of cremini mushrooms and a vidalia onion rather than 6 which made it sweet. Even my 5 year old raved about it.

The ingredients were all good, but the execution was just flat and there was this omnipresent bitter taste. I made it exactly as the recipe called for, except instead of pappardelle I used some bowtie noodles.

I have to agree with mars418 from IL, this was very blah and bland. If you have this wide a noodle, you should have a really flavorful sauce. I read the recipe and was doubtful as it did not seem to have enough flavor to it. Also, it may be quick to prepare, but with the food processor, the saute pan and pasta pot, it takes much longer to clean up from than to cook. Not worth the effort.

Rating: 3
Not used to my new food processor, so I accidentally "proces sed" the mushrooms too much; they were tiny little bits on their way to becoming paste. Oops! Sauce was still delicious but lacked the nice texture larger pieces of mushroom would have provided. I thought the amount of garlic was just right but my 3 cloves were pretty large. Shaved parm on the top would be a nice addition.

Rating: 3
Nice, hearty fall/winter recipe and relatively quick to make. I did find it a bit underseasoned and will increase the amounts of rosemary, salt, and pepper next time, perhaps adding some thyme. A little shaved parmesan and pecorino work nicely on top.

Great quick meal and easy to prepare. Garlic definately needs to be increased though. I cubed the chicken and stewed it all together after searing first. With the leftovers, I added ricotta and this was even better.

This was good - and so quick and easy. I thought using chicken thighs was good as they have so much more flavor. I was surprised by how dark the sauce was, but found it to be very rich and flavorful. The only thing I would definitely change is to use diced or crushed tomatoes rather than whole tomatoes. I don't have much luck when crushing them with the back of a spoon. They end up all over my stove, kitchen, and me.

Delicious. I made more by using extra mushrooms, pasta, and garlic. I only used 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar (in response to the reviewer who said it was too vinegary), but probably would have been fine with all 3. The meal was great with grated parmesean & overall had an outstanding flavor. I will definitely make this again.

There was way too much vinegar in this. You can't taste any of the other flavors because of the overpowering vinegar taste. It felt like a waste of good ingredients. I was tempted to throw it out. I might try it again with half a tablespoon of balsamic or with wine instead.
