Epicurious - 4 fork rating - Gourmet, August 1997 is a much better recipe for the panna cotta. The raspberries were very good - I used Chambord a French liquor made with black raspberries, since I didn't have Muscato on hand. This panna cotta recipe has too much gelatin and the result was that it was too stiff and a little rubbery.

The panna cotta could do without the raspberry sauce as it has a wonderful delicate flavor. Raspberries overshadow it. Although I also made raspberry coulis as a previous reviewer. Another thing, I think maybe you need to whisk the panna cotta again after it chills for 2 hours. Mine had only chilled for a bit before it got a "skin" on it. And all of the vanilla flecks sank to the bottom. So I would whisk it at this point to re-incorporate everything again. But the flavor of the panna cotta is simply devine...I think the boyfriend managed an emphatic "fantastic" between spoonfuls. I skipped the liquer and I'm glad I did... the vanilla is perfect on its own.

Sounds kind of strange, but I added Bailey's Irish Cream and some almond extract. It was terrific, and so very easy.

I liked this recipe because it calls for real vanilla beans instead of just vanilla extract. I didn't use non-stick spray, instead I poured the panna cotta into fancy dessert cups or martini glasses. I also strained the raspberry sauce to get rid of those annoying seeds and simmered the sauce to thicken it a bit. If you're in a rush, use an ice bath to cool the panna cotta mixture and then pour it into the containers.

A few days after I bougth 24 custard cups to make this dessert for a crowd, I went to a large event panna cotta was also served. Instead of using custard cups, the chef had poured the mixture into small paper cups (like Dixie cups) - the waiters just had to tear the edges of the cups to release the desserts onto the prepared plates. Nifty idea, if a bit wasteful.

Loved it! My mother and I had this dessert in Positano, Italy two years ago. I made it for her for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a huge hit. Tasted almost like Italy. I made a chocolate sauce instead of the raspberry sauce, because that's how we originally had it.

As good as any we've enjoyed in Italy. I think the measuring cup with the lip is used to make it easier to pour the mixture into the little cups, without spilling. I always do that.

yum, YUM, *YUM*!! this was a phenomenally great dessert. i served it at an 11-person dinner; there was a 12th panna cotta left over and everyone was practically fighting over who got it. (i won!) instead of frangelico, i added 0.75 teaspoons of almond extract to the tripled recipe, i.e., a quarter teaspoon per recipe. it was very subtle and added an extra touch of complexity. i also served them in dessert bowls -- didn't bother sliding them out. not quite impressive, but believe me, the taste will leave no attention for anything else.

We had this for the first time in Rome. It's simplicity is its best asset. One problem: the recipe seems to be missing as step -- when does the cream mixture magically get from the measuring cup to the baking cups?
