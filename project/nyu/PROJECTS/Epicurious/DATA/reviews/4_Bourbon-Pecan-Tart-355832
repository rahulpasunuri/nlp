Fantastic! Don't change a thing.

This recipe was a huge hit. It isn't too sweet and the bourbon goes really well with the pecans. I think it is funny that most of the reviews of the recipe discuss problems with the crust shrinking, but there is no crust recipe here. Pie crust shrinks when you create too much gluten and there are many tricks to easily avoid this problem. Please read the Basic Flaky Pie Crust from Nov 1998 to learn how to make a flaky pie crust that will not shrink. I had no problem with crust shrinkage when following this recipe.

I wish I'd thought more about the shrinkage issue because for me it caused a significant loss of filling and the tart turned out very dry without enough filling. i made enough crust for two so i'm going to try it again, but will absolutely overhang the crust and double up on edge thickness. The issue should be addressed in the recipe; it was a real disappointment and a little embarrassing as my contribution to Thanksgiving dinner...

this was an easy make ahead recipe for thanksgiving. everyone in my family loved it including the kids....i have never made a pie crust before either and had the shrinkage/leakage issue but it still turned out great. next time i'll definately make sure to have overhang before baking. for sure it's a make again and again and again....

I'm not sure I should review this, because I made a number of changes, but I had never made pecan pie before and this was the "inspiration" recipe. I wanted a less sweet pie with a full flavor, so I used Grade B maple syrup in place of the corn syrup and used only 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also increased the bourbon to 1/4 cup. And, I didn't put any sugar in the crust, as I assumed that the filling would be sweet enough. It was delicious, and I'll definitely make it again.

So amazingly good! Very quick and easy to put together once you have the crust ready. I like the extra flavor the bourbon adds. No changes or modifications needed to this recipe.

Agree, great tart. Did not have problems with shrinkage.

Great tart. Made it for Thanksgiving and it was pretty easy. Used our regular (all-butter) pastry recipe for the crust. I did what I usually do for a tart with this kind of pastry: trim the crust so that there is about an inch of overhang, and then fold that back towards the inside of the pan. So effectively, the sides of the tart have double thickness of pastry. I didn't have any problems with shrinkage... presentation was fine.

Regarding the crust, I think the instructions could have been more explicit. My crust shrank a lot in the 30 minutes under foil. It didn't fit all of the filling and the filling ran over the side. I'm not very skilled when it comes to pie crusts, but the instructions do say trim along the edge. I would not trim to the edge of the pan but instead leave some overlap. Disappointing because it affects the presentation for a Thanksgiving dessert.

This was very good. I used Maker's Mark. My crust wasn't amazing, but I would use the homemade recipe again because I think using a packaged Pillsbury crust would detract from the other flavors.

I made this tart for my first-ever dinner party, and it was a hit! I love to bake and, compared to other desserts I've prepared before, this one is very simple. I made the crust the night before (making your own crust is key and will be noticed by guests) and finished it well before my guests arrived. We served it with vanilla ice cream.
