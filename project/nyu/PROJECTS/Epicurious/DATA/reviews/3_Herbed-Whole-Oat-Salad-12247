for the record, when cooked with plenty of water, 25 minutes is sufficient for a lovely al dente grain. this salad begs alteration. though a tabouleh-like concoction is great for summer, try mixing with cubes of steamed or roasted beets and chopped chard leaves, (wilted by mixing into the hot, drained grain). same with cubed steamed or roasted winter squash and kale, etc. if served warm or at room temp, any appropriate vinaigrette will do. herb it with the season: thyme, sage, oregano. parsley is always good. enjoy!

Really nice. Note that the oat groats need to be cooked for approximately 40 minutes. Half a recipe serves 4-5 as a side dish.

This is sort of like a chewier, nuttier version of tabouleh. It's delicious, nutritious, and a nice change of pace.
