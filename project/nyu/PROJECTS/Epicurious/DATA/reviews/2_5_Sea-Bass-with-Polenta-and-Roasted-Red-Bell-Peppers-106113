Just made the polenta part of this recipe. Too bland for our tastes but may work as an introduction for those who've not had polenta before. I would recommend salt and pepper on the bell peppers before roasting to bring out more flavor.

I liked this very much, I used talapia, a mild white fish, and I made the tapenade using mild black olives instead of the recomended kalamata olives.

I substituted halibut for seabass. The fish had a mild taste so the tepenade added a nice flavor. You can use instant polenta instead of slow cooking, I just added an extra 1/4 cup polenta to the liquid mixture. All the flavors blended together quite nicely. I would make this again!

I substituted halibut for the sea bass, added more garlic, and used dried thyme instead of fresh. The whole dish was too mild in flavor for me, except for the tapenade, which seemed to overpower the rest a little bit. Maybe it was the brand I purchased or substitutions I made, but I didn't think the overall dish was worth the time.
