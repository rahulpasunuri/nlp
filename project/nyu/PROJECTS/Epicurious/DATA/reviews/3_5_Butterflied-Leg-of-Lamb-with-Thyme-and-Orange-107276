I just made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I cooked it for about 12 minutes instead of 16. I used lemon peel and the juice of one lemon instead of orange because I have a lemon tree. I also added fresh marjoram because it is a traditional Greek spice and greek olive oil. I rubbed the mixture over both sides instead of the slits. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious -- not bitter at all! -- not sure what some of the other reviewers are talking about. I grilled the lamb on the gas grill outdoors. My dinner guests loved it too.

I've made this twice, it's fabulous! The first time was best, going to a good local butcher made a difference. I may experiment with substituting a little lemon zest for a portion of the orange zest.

Terrific low-maintenance quick recipe. I like to substitutes kumquat zest for the oranges.

The flavors are excellent and meld well. I mixed the olive oil and spices together and used it as a rub, rather than make the cuts into the meat, and it worked really well. There was plenty for both sides of the meat. I will definitely make this one again.

Orange "peel" called for may have added the bitterness. If you use only the "zest," the orange outer portion, not the white pithe (that's the bitter stuff)it shouldn't turn out bitter.

Easy to make and impressive.The flavors were subtle and delicious. Disagree with other reviewer that orange gave the lamb a bitter flavor--it added a lemon-y sweetness to mine. (I marinated the lamb for 1 day). Be sure to use fresh thyme.

I have made many leg of lamb recipes with all sorts of standard and unusual seasonings. I did not think this combination was that great. The orange peel made the flavor of the meat particulary bitter.

I have a question. Could I cook the lamb on the BBQ instead of broiling?
