This is about the fifth year we've had sweet potatoes this way for Thanksgiving. They are FABULOUS - why would anyone ever use brown sugar, marshmallows, etc. ever after tasting this recipe!!

I absolutely love this recipe!! It's not Thanksgiving meal without it. However, I do realize that it does not appeal to everyone's tastes. For those people that appeals to, however, they will 'thank you'. I think it's delicious!!

This is a staple in our recipes. I used the garnet red sweet potatoes for more flavor. Must always watch the truffle oil since it can be overpowering in the dish. This is such a wonderful flavorful side dish to serve or bring to a party.

Going the slacker route here, all I did was mash the yams and goat cheese together and this was FANTASTIC. I'd be curious to try out the full recipe at some point, but the butter and truffle oil didn't seem necessary.

I have never eaten yams or sweet potatoes but was trying to be adventurous, and WOW! My husband and I fight over the last few bites every time I make them! I will try the baked version, but I liked them boiled just fine--cuts the sweetness a bit, I guess.

I loved them i made the pesto crusted lamb and some steamed asparagus for easter lunch. i had never cooked with truffle oil and thought that the flavor was great my husband however hated the truffle oil and said for me to never use it again i suggest letting your significant other taste the oil before using it in these because he could not even stand the smell too bad i asked after preparation

I love sweet potatoes, I love goat cheese. I followed this recipe exactly and learned that together, these two ingredients make me gag. The gamy quality of the cheese is awful with the fruitiness of the sweet potatoes. And it wasn't just me. None of my guests, adventurous eaters all, ate more than a forkful.

Wow. I have tried numerous sweet potato recipes, largely based on some combo. of brown sugar/maple/pecans, and this is by far the most elegant and decadent. I followed the advice of most reviewers (as well as my own instincts) and nuked the sweet potatoes and scooped out the flesh rather than boiling. I also cut back slightly on the butter and didn't miss it one bit. Paired with a mustard/maple pork tenderloin and sauteed spinach, this was one of my most successful meals to date. My husband literally licked the plate. This is my first review after years of using this site...that's how good this dish was!I just had to add my rave.

Made this recipe for the family last night, and it was delicious! It made for a more interesting than usual side to chicken and asparagus. I left out the butter entirely (trying to make flavorful food with less fat) and it turned out great. The goat cheese is so creamy that we did not miss the butter at all. Rather than hauling out the food processor, I mashed thoroughly (and easily) with a potato masher. We'll definitely be making this recipe a regular!

I wish I could give this five forks. I've made it at least five times now, goes great with almost anything. I also subbed marscapone for goat cheese in a pinch one night, and that was delicious, too. EXCELLENT.

This is so delicious - I nuc'd the potatoes in skin - cooled slightly and added pulp to processor with other ingredients! The aroma of the truffle oil is incredible. Awesome with Rack of Lamb Persillade and Steamed Asparagus.

This sure changes the taste of sweet potato. I cook them for my mother-in-law and have prepared in many different ways, including using maple syrup and pecans, but I really like this one. Bake them in their own juices, but put foil on the oven rack below to catch drippings. Absolutely good truffle oil, as expensive as it is and rosymary improves almost anything. I put in a corning dish and will reheat tomorrow in the over before Christmas dinner.

This dish is truly delicious - and I agree with reviewers below about using high quality truffle oil and a mellow, fresh goat cheese. We used the leftovers for wonton ravioli, and served in turkey broth with swiss chard and oyster mushrooms - it was the best Thanksgiving "leftover" dish I've ever had, and bound to become a tradition in our family.

It was great. I could not get Truffle oil so sauted some mushrooms with good olive oil and used that oil.. Really good and will try with Truffle oil next time.

This is a very rich side dish- delicious. A microscopic pinch of rosemary makes it perfect. Use the best truffle oil you can- it really makes a difference.

I'm not a fan of sweet potato but my husband is and to my surprise this is a keeper I will make it again soon for friends next weekend, used olive oil with black truffle purchaced from France. Served this with roast beef wrapped in bacon and rosemary and of course garlic.

Perfect for the holidays, this side dish is so elegant and indulgent -- and so easy! I've used it for both Thanksgiving and Christmas and it's perfect for both. Having just finished Christmas dinner, I just had to sit down and RAVE! Thank you, Epicurious!

This was oddly enchanting -- very savory and good.

This is the second holiday that I am making this sweet potato recipe. My family and friends went wild for them last year. It sure beats canned yams with marshmellows. Of course, I add more butter. Bake the yams don't boil them.

Be very careful with the truffle oil- it's powerful stuff and a little goes a loooooong way. One major fault with the recipe is the boiling of the potatoes vs. baking them. I will make again and bake the potatoes for a sweeter, more developed flavor. It was a nice paring with butterflied leg of lamb and green beans.

A really different version of mashed potatoes. It demands an entree with strong flavors. I've made it with and without the truffle oil, and would strongly endorse the use of the oil.

Delicious with one change. I roasted the sweet potatoes, halved, in their jackets rather than boil them. More flavor that way. Splurge on the best bottle of white truffle oil--it's worth it. My kids even liked this addition to our thanksgiving dinner.

Very easy and flavorful. I liked that it was still sweet, but had another depth to it. Will make again.

This recipe is truly a gourmet, 4-fork, 5-star recipe! The earthiness of the truffle oil adds a nice contract to the sweetness of the potatoes. Delicious!! And so easy.

What can I say - this was FABULOUS!!!!!! What a simple recipe for a dish with such complex flavors. A reviewer prior to me said they didn't add the truffle oil - I thought that was what made this dish sooooooo yummy. Even my grandchildren love this one. My guests at dinner last week couldn't believe there were only four main ingredients. This one's a keeper and a real winner!!!

I found this recipe to make for a special occasion (Christmas). But it was so easy and everyone loved it so much, it is going to replace regular mashed potatoes in my family's meals quite often! Absolutely delicious!

I made this for Christmas dinner to go with roast Beef and Brussels sprouts. It was gobbled up, even by the grandchildren. I am making it tonight for New Years Eve.

This dish was great. Perfect compliment to Christmas Prime Rib. To maintain the color I did not add salt or pepper but both added to the dish.

These potatoes were fabulous! I didn't add the white truffle oil after reading other reviews. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I made these a day in advance, reheated them on the stove and then piped them out (from a pastry bag) when I served them. Fantastic!

The showpiece of the Thanksgiving Feast! Use herb/garlic chevre for an extraordinary side dish.

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful side dish, especially when it accompanied a strong main dish. My family raved about it and went back for more than seconds. I will definitely make this again! Note: I didn't have as much goat cheese as suggested in the recipe so I used feta to make up for what I lacked and it was really lovely.

this is my second time making this recipe...and it is just amazing. I've never been huge on sweet potatoes, but this one you can't get enough of, because the flavors are unique and subtle. great for special occassions too, very impressive.

A very nice and unique side dish. Found it when looking for a way to try a new bottle of truffle oil. Didn't change a thing and it was even better the next day reheated in the microwave

I made this for Thanksgiving & it was fabulous. Very creamy, smooth, rich, gorgeous colour. The truffle oil really made the recipe. Very easy; make ahead and then re-heat. I even served the rest (what was left, anyway) the next day as a dip for crispy breadsticks. Very tasty.

This was one of the tastiest dishes I've made in a long time. Very easy and quick to prepare, and a nice change from the usual mashed potatoes. I will definitely serve this one to friends!

I have made this several times and it's always been a hit. I always try to buy a good brand of goat's cheese - that seems to make a big difference. Also, since it's hard to find truffle oil in my neighborhood, I've substituted a little olive oil. It's fine. A new recipe - not yet up on the web site - of sweet potato/parsnip puree is fantastic!

Rating: 2
The goat cheese lent a peculiar, almost chalky consistency to the puree, and the truffle oil was indeed overwhelming. Cut the oil in half and add more to taste if making this dish. I won't be.

This recipe, so light and tasty, was a hit at my dinner party, it went perfectly well with the mustard thyme roast, it will be placed on my dinner table again.

Since we made this recipe we have not had sweet potatoes any other way. We used galic herb goat cheese and it really gives it a rich flavour.

Tasty and easy way to make sweet potatoes. Definately have to like goat cheese for this recipe - it is a pronounced flavor in the dish. The truffle oil is a bit of a nutty flavor, but very subtle. May be able to make this without it.

Great recipe! Have made it several times and always a hit. Strong truffle flavor so if you do not like truffles make the dish, but leave out the truffle oil.

This dish was tasty. We are big fans of sweet potatoes, but have never had the creamed. This dish has been a big hit with guests!

funky? Fungy? I blamed the taste on not-so-hot goat cheese. Reminded me of my teenage son's after-work-out sox. Not a repeat for me!

Rating: 1
I have to agree with the previous review. I think the taste was "funky." I believe you have to love goat cheese to like this dish. One son thought it was "OK" the other son said he didn't like it and my husband loved it! Oh well.

Is it me or this dish tastes really weird? I did everything exactly as it called for,and I am sorry to say that it did not turn out good at all. I used the white truffle oil and I think that the problem might of have been there. The combinatin of sweet potato with the very strong white truffle oil did not work for us. Very dissapointing.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find truffle oil in my area but even without it such a simple recipe had a great flavor.
