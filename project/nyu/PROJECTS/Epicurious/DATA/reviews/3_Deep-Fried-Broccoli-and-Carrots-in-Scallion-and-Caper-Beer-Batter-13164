Great batter, turns out really really crispy. I've also used it for fried celery root and onion rings, mmmm.

I did not like this at all. I thought the batter was too thick.

Yum Yum!!! I've also used this with zucchini, onions, sweet potatoes, bell peppers, and alot of other veggies. Works great. Keep right on asking those really stupid questions, folks. It makes the rest of us feel so much better to know we're not the only occasional idiots on the planet. If we made a list, we'd have a best seller!

Hey Cook from New York, When you fry stuff, you have to put small amounts in the pot to keep the oil temp from dropping significantly. Taht means you need a warm over to keep the first small batch hot while you do the rest in batches.

I tried it and I loved it, my mother used to deep fried squids in the same batter adding pepper

Good idea but I'm trying to figure out why we're instructed to preheat the oven to 325 degrees. To heat the kitchen perhaps?
