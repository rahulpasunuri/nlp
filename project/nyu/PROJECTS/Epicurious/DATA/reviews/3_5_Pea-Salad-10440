This is a staple at our house, great for a spring dinner party. My husband loves peas, I love radishes -- we use summer savory instead of tarragon but both are good. The recipe is easy to make in smaller quantities and we use frozen baby peas.

I would have given this three forks, but my husband was lukewarm about the flavor. I enjoyed it a lot more than he did. I used fresh peas, cut the recipe to two servings. I can't imagine havin to shell quarts and quarts of peas to serve a crowd, but I think the fresh sweetness of the peas really made the flavor. I added the finely diced radishes at the last minute so they'd be as crunchy as possible. Worth a try, especially in pea season! Consider it for a cookout, as peas can be tossed with the dressing and scallions a couple of hours ahead with little loss of color from the small amount of vinegar.
