I've made beignets from a mix before but never from scratch. After making these I wondered why! Very easy to make, and I agree with the reviewer who said after making them a couple of times, one will better know how to handle the very sticky dough. I served my beignets with an adaptation of Apple Ginger Pie with Cider Bourbon Sauce--also a recipe on Epicurious. To die for!

I randomly decided to take these on tonight and was pleasantly surprised with the result! Easy to make, simple to follow. Only true surprise was I didn't know I would in fact get as many as we did! The dough is very sticky, but I found if you just added a bit more flour when you're preparing to fry them, it is fine to work with. You just need a lot of patience and perseverance, and I'm sure if I were to make it again it would be easier to work with! Will definitely try making these for guests!

These were so easy to make! They dough is really sticky, but once you've made them a few times, you'll get a better sense of how to work with it. I had a friend from New Orleans taste them and tell me what he thought they were pretty spot on, but needed to be fried a little longer. We finally did have beignets at Cafe du Monde and theirs were better than mine, but hey, that's their business. FYI - Cafe Beignet was fantastic too!

A big hit, much easier than I expected, and fairly foolproof. For a typical large pot, it takes about 2 quarts of peanut oil to achieve a depth of 3 inches. This recipe would be enough for a dozen people to be satisfied (4 each).

If you have EVER had beignets from Cafe du Monde in New Orleans, then this recipe is for you!! Its delicious! I loved how well the dough puffed up in the oil like little pillows...it was amazing! My husband and I both loved them. I made the dough the night before and put it in the fridge after cutting it into squares. The next day I heated up the oil to the appropriate temp and fried them up...it took a little white to master flipping them before they got too poofy, but once I got it down, they were delectable! Definitely took me back to the south with every bite!

These were a mess-but still tasted good. My dough was very sticky, but tried it anyway. I did make them early and stacked between sprayed parchment-still got stuck. When I did manage to peel them off, they were not pretty! I fried them anyway and they tasted good-even better with a little sweet strawberry jam on them.

Let me start by saying: these were awesome! A big hit with everyonr! I used raspberry jam and a oral syringe to inject filling into some and they were even better! That being said- I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a bowl of "dough soup." I had to add about another cup of flour to make it workable. Even so, they came out great, and I'm probably going to make another batch since I've still got buttermilk left...

STARTED TO MAKE THESE BEFORE DINNER WAS SERVED. THE FIRST BATCH NEVER MADE IT, THEY WERE DEVOURED BEFORE THE MEAL. OIL TEMP AND SIZING ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR A COMPLETE FINISHED PRODUCT, THAT IS NOT OVER COOKED ON THE OUTSIDE AND UNDERCOOKED INSIDE. (MORE SUGAR,MORE SUGAR,MORE SUGAR) IT'S OK ADD MORE SUGAR

My spouse and I made these this weekend. We have been lucky to have beignets at Cafe Du Monde, they really are at their best warm, leftovers wouldn't do. Since we were just cooking for two people we thought 48 pieces was way too decadent so we halved the amounts. At the end of mixing one long look in the bowl showed us batter that was way too sticky and wet. We threw in a little more flour, gave it a few more turns and then let it rest. It was still too sticky to work with by hand so we just used spoons to form donut hole sized balls and eased these into the hot oil. The beignets still turned out tasty... kickin' with the chicory coffee we brought home from NOLA This is the first time I fried anything - I found the directions very helpful. A thermometer is a must.

Delicious! Will definitely make again.

As a first-time beignet-maker, I was thrilled to have chosen this recipe for my dinner party. My guests wouldn't stop eating them - so I kept frying them! Six people ate the entire batch. I made three simple dipping sauces: chocolate, blackberry, and maple. They were perfect: light, airy on the inside, and perfectly golden crispy after only a couple of minutes in the fryer.

Divine. These were really easy with a stand mixer (no kneading) and tasted soooo good. Made them spur of the moment for an afternoon snack and with 5 kids, they were gone by bed time. I also injected half of them with raspberry pie filling using a medicine syringe and this (for those that like the jelly filled ones) put them right over the top. There was an overwhelming demand for "Beignet Saturdays" from now on!
