I have made the mistake of trying this with pork belly ("chinese-style")instead of pork loin (American style)twice, yeah twice in NYC. Believe me it is an acquired taste...uncooked bacon kinda "taste"...steer clear of this type go with nice, simpl;e twice cooked pork loin

I was a bit disappointed in this dish, which wasn't particularly flavorful despite all the exotic ingredients. I hunted down pork bellies, chinese leeks and the rest at a Korean grocery, but in the end, the flair was not there. We wound up adding extra hot sauce at the table, because the flavors were lacking.
