Love this recipe and have made it numerous times. Really fast and really delicious. The only reason I didn't give it four forks is because I always struggle with the cooking time. Definitely takes longer than 6 mins under the broiler. I always end up having to bake it to finish it off, and check it compulsively so I don't overcook the fish. Tasty though. One note: I use low sodium white miso and it works well.

This was exceptional. Made it with wild cod and both my husband and young daughter loved it. Was even fantastic cold leftover the following day. Really easy to prepare. Sunflower sprout salad was odd to eat with a fork. I'd recommend chopsticks.

This is now my favorite recipe for fish fillets, whether using black cod, halibut, or tilapia. Changes I have made: I find it too salty as written, and prefer it with 1/4 c. miso and 1/3 cup mirin. While broiling, the sauce at the edges tends to burn, so I remove the pan once or twice during the broiling process and blend the browned edges of the sauce into the rest of the sauce with a rubber spatula. This way, at the end of cooking, the sauce is light brown and slightly carmelized--- altogether yummy. The sunflower sprouts can be deleted if making a last-minute weeknight dinner; or, I have substituted a sauted bag of spinach, stirred in the other ingredients, and served the fish on a bed of spinach. Its great either way. I have made this recipe so many times that I now buy a large amount of fresh ginger, chop it up, put 2 Tbls. portions in sandwich size bags, and freeze it until I want to use it.

I made this exactly as stated, only I subbed apple cider vinegar with a pinch of sugar for the rice vinegar since I realized at the last minute that I was all out. I also doubled the portion of sprout salad. It was amazing! Absolutely delicious. I think having a hot-enough broiler may be key -- I've got an infrared broiler that created beautiful caramelization over the entire pieces of fish. Maybe my pinch of sugar in the marinade helped as well? They looked way better than the recipe photo (which sort of looks like the fillet has peanut butter smeared on top). I also let the oven preheat for a while with the broiler on, and the fish was perfectly cooked through and unbelievably moist and flaky. We were wowed, to say the least. A bite of sprouts with each bite of sablefish.... it was truly a great springtime dinner. Paired really nicely with a fine rosé, too.

The miso so totally overwhelmed the delicate taste of the cod that it seemed like a disconnected element. A fraction of the miso called for would have been sufficient, and adding the extra marinating glaze atop the fish before broiling not necessary or desirable.

White miso was much too strong of a smell and taste - it ruined what may have been a very good dish. I will not make this again.

I had to make a few substitutions - chopped sweet onion for the green onions, steamed spinach for the sunflower sprouts, but this was really good. Definitely worth making again, and I'll probably use the spinach again.

Awesome if you love miso (which my boyfriend and I do). I'm on a grad student budget, so black cod was, but it was delicious on regular cod. However, since the sauce is quite strong I recommend serving it with a starch--we use a wild rice blend.

My husband and I both love miso and we were delighted with this dish! Pretty easy to make and very tasty. We scooped the extra miso from the pan onto the fish when we served it, which made a nice, creamy topping. I used black cod (sable) from Whole Foods but a similarly rich fish would probably work as well.

What kept me from giving this recipe four forks is the difficulty I had grilling the cod. The recommended six minutes weren't enough to grill 1 3/4 lbs of cod that I used. It might have been my oven, but I ended up baking it instead of grilling. It was very good, but the fish wasn't as brown on the outside as I would have liked. I used watercress instead of sunflower sprouts, and it worked very well. I balanced the bitterness with small bits of ripe mango.

This was wonderful and an easy meal to fix during this busy week. I just used regular cod from Whole Foods and the marinade worked perfectly. My cod was really thick and the six minutes under the broiler was not realistic. It would be better to bake in a hot oven instead.
