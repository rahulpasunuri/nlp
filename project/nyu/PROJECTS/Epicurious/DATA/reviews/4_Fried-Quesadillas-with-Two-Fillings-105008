This recipe gave me great inspiration, because I was looking for something a little more European; French mainly. So I substituted puff pastry for the quesadillas and used acual suqash instead of blossoms. mmmmm pastries!

Hint: instead of using a regular plastic bag, use one from the produce department that held vegetables or fruit. The texture of that type of plastic bag tends to stick less to the tortilla and doesn't stick to itself, either. It's also much more flexible, so you don't end up with wrinkles in your tortilla.

This is precisely my mother's recipe, right down to the cutting of the plastic bags for the tortilla press to prevent sticking. The only difference is the size of the quesadillas; my mother's quesadillas are made larger. I make this dish for my girlfriend all the time and she loves it.
