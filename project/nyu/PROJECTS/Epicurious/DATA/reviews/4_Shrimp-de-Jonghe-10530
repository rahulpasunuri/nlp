I made this when we had another couple over for dinner, and even though they usually eat at the likes of Nobu in Manhattan, they raved about this dish. I added a 1 lb of bay scallops, 1/3 c. of sliced almonds (sprinkled on in the last 15 min of baking), and multiplied the remainder of the recipe by 1.5 since I had the extra shellfish. For the presentation I spooned the shellfish atop a small mound of roasted red bliss potatoes. I topped it with a few spears of roasted asparagus and sprinkled the perimeter of the plate with some minced parsley for color. The result was a rich, indulgent dish that made everyone groan with pleasure. Its not diet food, but when youre entertaining you should never hold back anyway.

We have used this recipe for years and it is great. Dry Sack Sherry is a must for us when making this as other sherry's do not give it the same taste. While we love garlic we have found that more then 4 cloves detracts from the outcome.

I'm giving this three forks, because I made some changes that probably affected it somewhat, but it was still excellent. I recreated my favorite dish at Petterino's in Chicago. It is Scallop DeJonge. I sliced jumbo scallops in half to make thinner slices. I cut the butter back to 4 TBS and then added about 1 TBS of olive oil, to help replace some of the richness. I used everything else according to recipe, but would cut the Sherry back to 1/3 cup next time. There isn't quite enough fat to asbsorb the tang of the sherry, but for a much healthier version, it was worth it. I used Panko crumbs and whirled them through the mini processor with the garlic. Next time would only do that with half of the crumbs and leave the other half whole. I'm sure if I would have made it to recipe it would get a four. But if we can eat 3's and eat healthier - ok!!

This makes a great appetizer for shrimp and garlic lovers!

The two changes we made, were to double the garlic, and premix all ingredients (except shrimp),cover and set aside for approx. 2-3 hours. The sherry is almost totally absorbed and the results are amazing. Powerful stuff. Easy to prepare. Outstanding.

I had two pounds of large, cooked shrimp (approx. 50) on hand, which I used instead of the jumbo shrimp. I thawed the shrimp and then spread them out onto a jelly roll pan. I followed the recipe (only using two large cloves of garlic, and leaving out the cayenne pepper, since I didn't have any). The recipe tasted delicious, and I will definitely make it again.
