Only okay. Bland and missing something. Was great topping a cornmeal crusted fish sandwich with lemon aioli!

We've made this several times, exactly as written, but without the apple and we've loved it each time. It's quick, light and healthy. Great spring/summer side dish.

Too sweet! I am often heavy with the garlic, but some crushed garlic would really help here.

I usually prefer coleslaw that is less sweet but this was too sour for it's own good. I liked it, but I didn't love it. I would suggest half the caraway seeds.
