This ice cream is delicious when it works out, but for us, it was hard to get right. There were runny issues three out of the four times. We also had to increase the lemon by double or triple to get any kind of lemon taste (we were using Meyer lemons), which we think in turn made it runny in the mixer. We are going to try putting the lemon into the milk-sugar mixture to alleviate the water, but retain the lemony taste. But lemon sorbet seems to be a much better alternative to actual ice cream. Again, though, this is one household's opinion!

Custard didn't thicken particularly well. Final product was milky and slightly icy. Needed to be tarter as well.

This got rave reviews and is great paired with the blueberry sorbet. My father-in-law now thinks I should supply him with gallons of this. The lemon favor is mellow and refreshing. I think next time I would use zest instead of candied peel-the pieces got a little to hard in the cold.

Very straightforward recipe.
