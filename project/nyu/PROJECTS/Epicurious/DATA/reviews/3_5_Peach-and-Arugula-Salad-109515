I won't rate the recipe because I didn't follow it. I used what I had in the fridge: too many ripe peaches, fresh spinach, thick cut bacon and mild feta in brine. Fried the bacon in pieces, then drained the pan and fried the peaches in slices. Wilted the spinach and crumbled the feta. Really good combination of flavors, even if not as stated in the recipe.

Really good flavors. However, the pancetta kept slipping off the peaches and making a big mess when I tried to cook them (even with toothpicks per the other comments), so I ended up grilling the peaches (brush with a little olive oil, then lay them on the grill pan) and frying up chopped up bits of pancetta... which was delicious.

I liked the idea of the peaches wrapped in pancetta but I had a hard time turning them as they cooked. Maybe next time I will saute the peaches in butter and brown sugar and cook the pancetta chopped up separetly. Then put it all together. I toasted almond sliced for the top and used gorgonzola cheese.

Excellent salad-loved the pancetta around the peaches-doubled that-everyone thought this was so different and impressive

I reviewed this recipe on 09/05/06. I made this delightful salad once again for company and added a few changes once again. The peaches I bought were terrible, but I had 3 Japanese pear/apples on hand. So, in a last minute scramble, I used them instead. I secured the pancetta around the crisp slices with toothpicks and they seared beautifully. They did not discolor at all. I tossed the arugula with the dressing in a large bowl and then placed a generous portion on individual chilled salad plates. I then topped with dried cranberries, crumbled feta, candied walnuts, red onion, and then 3 of the pear/apple slices. I have never had such rave reviews on a salad and it was pretty to boot!

I apologize...I stated that I used pears but it was peaches!

Very tasty salad! The pancetta wrapped pears add a special, unexpected touch that makes this easy salad seem much more gourmet. I couldn't find arugula so I used a Spring Mix. The recipe plans for 3 wrapped peaches per plate but in case that was too rich I did 2 with pancetta and 1 w/o but still cooked them. Will definitely do this again!

I served this to guests and they loved it. I followed the recipe except I used half arugula and half baby greens. Also, when sauteeing the peaches, I took one reviewer's advice and used toothpicks to hold the pancetta around the fruit - such an easy solution, and when the peaches were all done, I just slid them off the toothpicks onth the salad plates and they stayed intact. Next time I will use blue cheese, as although the ricotta salata was good, it was pretty low in flavor, and blue cheese would definitely kick things up a notch.

It was good - had trouble keeping the pancetta rolled around the peaches - we liked the flavours - but just not enough for 3 forks! We used hot- n-spicy pancetta however which we would recommend, but in turn would recommend to use less pancetta (b/c there is a lot of flavour there)!

I liked the flavors in this recipe but if I make it again I would only make a dressing of good balsamic and lemon juice. The pancetta is oily enough (even after draining well). I tried both pancetta and prociutto and preferred the pancetta.

I was too lazy and just chopped the pancetta and peaches and cooked them together. Meanwhile, made the dressing. Then threw all ingredients together with the cooked peach and pancetta and served it on a plate with cottage cheese on top. It tasted great. I will try to make it like it says next time.

This was an excellent salad. The key is to use ripe sweet peaches. My family loved this recipe and I will be making this again all summer long.

What a delightful salad, and perfect for that company you want to impress! I added dried cranberries and thinly sliced red onions and substituted feta for the ricotta salata. I didn't have any problems cooking the peaches as previously mentioned. When assemling, I lightly tossed the arugula with the dressing and then topped with the peaches, red onions, cranberries, feta and cracked pepper. Delicious!

Fabulous. I made a couple of changes - this recipe stands up well to substitutions as per your taste. My changes: added a couple of slices of red onion & some lettuce (any) mixed in with the arugala. I used goat cheese instead of ricotta salata. I placed the salad in one bowl, but it looks picture perfect any way you plate it.

Very tasty and easy. The presentation is so elegant, no one will know how simple this recipe is to pull together. A keeper. I also recommend, as someone else did, using peaches that are slightly underripe, they'll hold up better in the fry pan.

I havn't tried this salad, but I make a similar salad using blue cheese / Gorgonzola or Camembert instead of the Ricotta. If available, pumpkin seed oil goes along with these as well.

Delicious. Have done this with goat cheese wrapped in prosciutto before (wrap the goat cheese in an endive leave first to keep it together, and then wrap the prosciutto around both). Used wooden toothpicks to keep everything together while sauteing and took them out before serving.

Wonderful. Used perfectly ripe white peaches. One guest said he'd never eaten a better salad.

Provocative combination of flavors. I used prosciutto instead of pancetta and the world didn't end. I served this as a main course and, for late July, it couldn't have worked more perfectly.

Absolutely delicious. The pancetta and peach combo is a winner. So much flavour and texture. I've done it with ricotta salata but also with crumbled greek feta which is equally excellent.

Fabulous!!! I did not peal the peaches, and I did not wrap them in pancetta. I sauted the peaches for 5 min., then sauted the pancetta for 5 min. I used red leaf lettuce and blue cheese. Apsolutely wonderful.

I didn't wrap any meat on the peach slices. Instead I heated the peach slices up just by themselves, put them on top of the salad with the balsamic dressing and substituted with regular feta cheese, which was excellent! I also added craisin (sun-dried cranberries) to the salad and it was just fantastic. It was a big hit with my friends and the combination of flavors makes this easily one of the top three salads on my list.

I made this salad for a baby shower brunch. What a hit! I used both pancetta AND proscuitto as well as crumbled goat cheese AND a bit of gorgonzola. I made it a bit ahead of time and served as a large bowl for the buffet rather than the individual servings. Turned out fine. Had a bit of trouble keeping the pancetta/proscuitto wrapped around the peach slices. I agree with another reviewer, it's fine to saute them all together, when served tossed in a large bowl the presentation is less a factor.

The store didn't have pacentta, so I used prosciutto instead. It was light, yummy, and very easy to prepare. I used fetta cheese as suggested by a previous reviewer.

Wonderful recipie! Wrapping and sauteing is impossible- I gave up and just did them all together in the pan- much shorter time that way! It may not look as pretty, but who knows?

Have made this twice now for dinner parties. Both times the guests raved and ate every bite! Next time I think I'll use goat cheese as another reviewer suggested. Wonderful blend of flavors.

This was great...I think I cooked the peaches a little longer than the recipe said, and it was still wonderful, the flavor combo is just heavenly. I think it would be good without with ricotta salata as well- but it's fine with.

Absolutely fantastic! I made only one substitution, I used a bleu cheese instead of the ricotta. This looked as good as it tasted, incredible. Use thin pancetta, wrap it snugly, and when you place them in the pan make sure the "loose end" goes down first and gets seared to sort of fuse the meat together. That way when you turn the peach it doesn't fall apart.

have the pancetta sliced thin so that you can wrap it around the peaches. Not necessary to peel them if the skin is thin.you can use any dressing you like

Rating: 3
A wonderful recipe, not least because it allows for substitutions. Mine: why bother peeling the peaches? I left the skin on, and used less pancetta than called for, just enough to wrap each section. Then I used a bed of plain red lettuce, for the more finicky eater in the house, and a plain chevre. Note for west coasters: dressing was excellent with Trader Joe's orange muscat vinegar instead of balsamic and lemon juice.

My absolute favorite summer salad. Changes? I use shaved prosciutto and fresh Mozzarella Bocconcini or a plain goat cheese. I love the interplay of spicy greens, salty proscuitto, creamy cheese, sweet peach, and sour lemon.

It was good but I had a hard time with the pancetta staying on the peaches. I would also use a different cheese next time, perhaps feta or bleu cheese.
