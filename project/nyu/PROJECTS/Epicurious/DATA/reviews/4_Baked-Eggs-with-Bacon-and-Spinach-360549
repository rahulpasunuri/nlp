I loved it. However I didn't have one of the 'fancy' ramekins cups but I had some cute little bowl that I was scared to put in the oven so I baked the eggs and whipped cream in a separate skillet and laid it over the spinach and bacon. I will be picking up some ramekins on my next trip to the store.

I thought these were really good. I made the recipe as stated and would not change a thing.

i found this recipe under the "Quick Breakfasts" header. 30-45 minutes is not what most of us consider "quick" when getting the kids off to school and ourselves off to work. I love your website but this is a joke.

Some of the best recipes are the most simple. The flavors of this petit dish are beautiful and rich. Though it looks like a small serving, it is enough and satisfying. Directions are correct so follow along and enjoy!

I made this for friends visiting from Paris and it was a huge hit. Nine months later, they still occasionally mention it.

Very yummy, easy, and it looks impressive to friends. I had to cook them a bit longer too to let the whites set.

My husband found this recipe and insisted we try it. He knew I'd approve because it had some "green" along with all egg and bacon, LOL. It was very easy to assemble and the presentation was gorgeous. I felt the spinach alone would be too bland so I put some onions in with the spinach saute and it was perfect! I also put some crumbled goat cheese on top of the muffin (and I didn't pre toast it) and a bit more on top of the egg. It added a nice creamy texture. I was craving a sauce or drizzle....since the entire thing came off as a hot spinach salad. I'm thinking next time I make it (and I most certainly will) I'll add a nice balsamic reduction and pull the whole "salad" taste together!

I couldn't wait to make this, and it lived up to my expectations! It looked so impressive for such little effort; I served it for dinner paired with Deborah Madison's Cream of Tomato Soup, delicious!

I absolutely love this dish, and it has been a big hit everytime I have made it for others. However, I did make a couple of changes that I am a fan of 1. I used maple bacon; that sweet smokey flavor really adds something to the dish 2. I added some swiss cheese; mild cheese flavor was another good addition.

I wasn't sure if I'd like the texture of the spinach but it really worked together. My husband thought that the portion was a little small, but I thought it was fine. Can't wait to make it again!

An excellent brunch recipe for holiday mornings. I cooked them in large muffin pans instead of ramekins, and they turned out beautifully. I did make some hollandaise as well *just in case*, and they were delicious either way.

Amazing, easy to make, easy to be creative. I recommend going anywhere from 30s-1min. to get the middle of the egg a bit more cooked. www.sickfreestuff.com

Very good, and easily modified.

This was very tasty and I liked it very much. The portion was just right. I let it cook a little longer so the yolk was not too runny, but still had a little run to it. I'd make it again for myself, but maybe not for my husband who thought it was "just okay" and nothing "special".

Very yummy, will definitely make this again. Made it with homemade English muffins, omitted the bacon (vegetarian), replaced the cream with half & half, and topped with shredded sharp cheddar and chives.

This is a fantastic easy recipe. The English muffins that I bought had sugar in them and we felt this detracted from the recipe. Next time, I will use bakery wheat bread.

We found it rather bland, but it is probably our fault; regular bacon, and standard English muffins. After reading the reviews, and discussing it, we would do it w a black bean salsa next time. Should be good. Also like the idea from another review of taking it out of the ramekins to eat.

Rating: 3
Very good! I reduced the amount of bacon to 4 slices of regular bacon, used whole wheat english muffins (trimmed a bit to fit nicely in the ramekin), a bit more spinach, and omitted the cream. I overcooked mine a bit; next time I will remove them promptly after 14 minutes. Great for brunch, and very quick and easy to make!

So good, we made it two nights in a row! The only change I made was based on another reviewer's suggestion of spooning a couple of tablespoons of chunky pasta sauce over the spinach, which I think gave it more flavor. Could not be easier.

Loved this recipe my husband found on Epicurious.com and asked me to make. Great combo and flavorful as written. The only changes I made were to use pepper bacon and finish it under the broiler for 2 minutes. I would recommend lifting it out of the Ramekin to serve--lifts out easily on the english muffin and makes it much easier to eat.

Very good dish. Had for dinner but would be most excellent as a breakfast or brunch item. Did not have the muffins but substituted left-over cornbread which worked perfectly. Seasoning is critical so make sure you don't forget the salt and pepper.

Not a big fan of spinach, but was nicely disguised by the bacon and egg. Might benefit from a touch of Hollandaise sauce, was a little dry.

Wow! This was delicious and looks so fancy. Here are the changes I made to make this dish a bit more healthy and more substantial for the big eaters in my family. First, I used bigger 2 cup ramekins. Then I placed two toasted english muffin halves in the bottom of each (one cut in half to fit the bottom of the ramekin better). Instead of bacon I used smoked ham lunch meat (three pieces per ramekin, browned in the skillet and placed on top of the bread). Topped this with the spinach and then two to three cracked eggs. Next, I substituted chunky tomato pasta sauce instead of cream. I also sprinkled a little shredded Italian style cheese on top as suggested by another reviewer. Then I baked at 425 degrees for 10 minutes. Perfect! The eggs were just done, a little runny, but the whites were done. The tomato sauce was flavorful and added color to the dish. I can't wait to make this for guests.

this was terrific! easy, fast and delicious. i definitely served them in the ramekins, because anything in ramekins looks delicious! my eggs were not all perfect because jumbo eggs vary in yolk-white proportions: some were perfect, some were cooked a little too much for my taste. next time i would try to pull out the ramekins as i thought they were done. i also doubled the bacon content.

Delicious! I used turkey bacon and it was great!!

So good, so easy....so bacon-y! I first saw this recipe in the September issue of Bon Appetit, then again as the "Recipe of the Day" on epicurious.com and knew I had to make it. Followed the recipe exactly as written. This dish was so yummy. Will definitely make it again!

yum! used pancetta instead of apple wood bacon; didn't have ramekins so just used my large muffin tins instead. Easy and quick. The recipe says its for four people -- not in my house -- two each were consumed by all.

This recipe looks great. I have one question though. How do you eat it? Do you leave it in the ramekin or serve it on a plate? I can't see how you can cut the muffin if it's in the ramekin. I will probably have to make a test run. Oh darn.

Rating: 0
Some changes I made for visual appeal: left bacon whole and curled around sides of baking dish to "cup" the egg; added a small amount of finely grated gruyere cheese on top of egg; removed muffin and replaced with a french bread crouton, cut on the angle and inserted in dish just before serving.

This recipe is just too bland. Nothing really going for it.

Delicious, used sourdough and chives as well. If you buy your eggs from corporate farms that are dirty and have horrible conditions for their animals, yes you may be concerned about salmonella. If you care a lick about where and how your food comes to you you'll know to buy cage free organic eggs and won't worry about salmonella. Humans have been eating raw eggs for thousands of years.

I've always loved shirred eggs, and this recipe is delicious. Great with chives, thyme, basil - any herb! And do I feel sorry for that family in Minneapolis! They live with a hectoring nanny. Get a life, lady! Don't tell ME what to cook! If you don't like it, don't eat it! Enjoy your turkey bacon and hard boiled eggs.

To the cook in Minneapolis Don't make the recipe if you are fearful.. My goodness some look for any reason to complain We make a similar version in my family..delicious

I also added some chopped chives over the eggs which I cooked thoroughly. Yum!

I made this over the weekend. I use sourdough bread. You was able to got the full flavor of the eggs, bacon, and spinach. I'll be using this recipe alot.

What's not to like? If you like spinach/eggs/bacon, that is. In my childhood, Mom would open and heat a can or two of spinach, and serve it up with sliced boiled egg and fried bacon and buttered toast on the side. For the last 40 years, my husband and I have enjoyed the same for a quick lite supper or Saturday lunch. We've also baked eggs with cream or sour cream and frequently added ham or bacon. This updates two old favorite standbys beautifully. YUMM!!
