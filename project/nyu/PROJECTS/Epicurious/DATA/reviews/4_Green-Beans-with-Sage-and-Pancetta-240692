I have tried this recipe 3 times, the first two times I did it as directed but now that we are trying to watch our calories we substituted the pancetta with canadian bacon. Actually thought it tasted better with the canadian bacon.

OMG! This was the best green bean dish I've ever tasted. Took *much* longer to crisp up the pancetta than indicated (maybe b/c my pan wasn't large enough), but no matter-this is so good, it's well worth the wait!

Definitely make sure the pancetta is crispy. Made this mixture ahead and just added to the green beans the next day. The flavor was perfect together, didn't need to use the fleur de sel, salty enough, save it for a better use.

Perfect! But you do need to add the salt when serving. . . the sage and pancetta worked wonderfully together. A hit!

This was very tasty, but definitely taste it before adding any fleur de sel at the end. Ours came out really salty -- the pancetta had plenty of salt, so we shouldn't have added any.

Great combination of ingredients but needs a little change in cooking times. Only boil beans for maybe a minute, blanch in ice-bath, then finish cooking when you sauté. Otherwise, beans aren't crisp but soft.

Excellent side dish. I added caramelized shallots and toasted pine nuts to the pancetta and sage which I prepared the day before. I also blanched the beans the day before and stored in the fridge. On Thanksgiving, I just put the beans in a 9 x 13 casserole pan, drizzled with a little olive oil, topped with the pancetta/ sage/ shallots/ pine nuts mixture, and popped into the oven while the turkey was resting. Easy and delicious.

Found an easy way to make this: go to trader joes... buy frozen green beans, fresh sage, and pre-chopped pancetta. Cook frozen beans in microwave, fry pancetta in olive oil on stove, and throw in chopped sage. No need to measure. Mix everything (minus the greasy olive oil) together in a bowl and serve!

a delicious item that may or may not be worth the expense...

everyone who has tasted this loves it. Green Beans and Pork are a traditional favorite. And this recipe elevates it to a level of 'gourmet food'. But, only when fresh ingedients are used.

A family favorite, simple and fast. Wouldn't change a thing. Family members actually request this recipe.

These are my all time fav for green beans. I love the pancetta sage flavor!

I was worried that this recipe was too plain to serve for Christmas, but it made a nice accompaniment to beef tenderloin with port sauce from the same menu. I used extra sage and added some shallot as others suggested. Next time, I will also use extra pancetta. After I blanched the beans, I plunged them into an ice bath rather than spreading on baking sheets. I did this early in the day and refrigerated until read to use, which worked fine and reduced last-minute stress.

everyone LOVES these beans. will make them again and again. !!

Alas...my grocery store was out of pancetta, and I didn't feel like store-hopping, so I substituted cappacola (sp?) instead. It actually turned out quite well and gave it a little extra kick. Very good, got rave reviews.

this side dish went over well with my family- a bunch of sophisticated 'foodies'! Such a classic combo of greens and pork. The Sage adds a substantial touch of class, and the flavors meld to a delicate but meaningful medley of hearty soul food! And just damn good too- as my son said!!!

used a past reviewer's suggestion and added some chopped shallots, put in more sage. SO good! guests were digging out the last bits of pancetta from the veggie dish

Best green beans I ever made. We had fresh picked beans and sage from the garden. I used much less olive oil and a good bacon. I can't wait for more beans so I can make it again.

Yes, Yes! Pancetta and sage very nice enhancement to plain ol' green beans. I also added shallots to add a little sweetness...enjoyed it!

This was good. Never would havethought of pancetta with green beans. I found another good Italian themed green bean dish at www.thegrilllife.com

I made these ahead of time (3 hours) and unfortunately the beans looked a little dried out by the time I served dinner - although the taste was still great and everyone had seconds. Not confident enough to make-ahead again even though other reviews said it worked... but would definitely make it again.

i made these for a holiday dinner this year - and there were some who are not green bean fans who loved this! the pancetta is a must - it makes a fabluous taste sensation

If I make this again I will use regular bacon. The pancetta was no more exciting than salt pork, and just made the beans greasy. The sage flavor didn't come through at all.

Did this last night for a New Year's dinner with the extended family and everybody loved it! Easy ans fast to prepare. Held up well for more than 45 minutes before dinner. Will definitely do it again!

This dish was ok but definately was not the highlight of my Christmas dinner. I would suggest maybe adding some garlic to give it another dimension.

I added some pearl onions and garlic to this and then crisped the pancetta in combination with those. It added even more flavor. Fresh sage made all the difference - amazing combination of flavors and incredibly easy to make. Everyone loved it!

I made these with the rest of the menu (roasted beef tenderloin with port sauce, mustard- roasted potatoes). These beans were spectacular. I used two packages of frozen haricots vert instead of fresh beans. They were really easy to prepare. My guests raved, ate every bite and even called the next day to rave again.

These were very nice and a welcome change. The sage and pancetta gives them an interesting flavor and is so aromatic! I didn't have fleur de sel, but regular kosher salt worked well. Not much is needed due to the saltiness of the pancetta. Simple, clean, and elegant dish.

This was simple and incredibly flavorful. Plus it held up well made 3 hours before my Christmas dinner. Went nicely w/the mustard roasted potatoes and the rib roast w/garlic-thyme sauce from this site. My folks said it was a perfect meal- I'll definately make these again- even on a weeknight!

I served this for our Christmas crowd of 16 and was pleasantly surprised at the ease of preparation. Not having made the recipe prior, I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the olive oil. I used the olive oil found in the pesto from the local Italian restaurant, Pasta Pomadoro. Everyone raved about the delicious flavor. Would definitely serve this simple but elegant show stopper again!!

Great addition to our Christmas Eve dinner, along with filet mignon and wild mushroom bread puddings. For those who didn't like this, I think there are a few important things to keep in mind -- be careful not to overcook the green beans and properly salt the water. Use haricot vertes. Large green beans wouldn't meld as well with the flavors of the sage and pancetta. Really crisp the pancetta, and use less than half the oil called for. Otherwise, I can see why people would find it oily. And make sure to use fresh sage, freshly cracked pepper, and large salt crystals for finishing. This is a simple recipe that requires quality ingredients and careful preparation to fully appreciate. Oh, I also didn't bother with the paper towels. I just set the beans in a collander to drain. We loved it.

Very good...I cut down on the amount of olive oil to one TB. Fresh sage must be used for the flavor to really come out. My guests raved about this dish!

One green bean recipe we really didn't like. I love crispy pancetta but the recipe is missing flavor. The sage just didn't do it. I used haricot verts. This one won't be repeated. Maybe sauteeing in butter instead of olive oil might improve the result.

It was almost disgusting. Waste of good ingredients. Beans and pancetta didn't mix at all so one mouthful was full of oily beans and the next very salty crispy pancetta. Pretty vile.

Simple and delicious! I love fresh sage and made the mistake of adding too much, but I was the only one who noticed - everyone else thought it was great. Almost impossible to mess this one up.

at first I was skeptical because I've made green beans with bacon, but the pancetta and sage really set it off. WOW that's all we could talk about at the table. It was a GREAT hit.

Great dish. Very sophisticated flavors that elevate the haricot verts to the next level. The adults loved it as did my older children but my niece who normally loves green beans didn't like it all. I will definitely make this again when I want to impress my adult dinner guests.

Excelent, I made the dish with the baby French green beans and it was heaven with my Lemongrass rubbed oven roasted tenderloin.

Nice recipe; green beans, pancetta, olive oil and fresh sage....what's not to like; I think it works well with any good sea salt. - regards
