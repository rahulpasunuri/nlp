This is a good, basic radish salad recipe. Traditionally it is eaten with a bit of "Kren" (horseradish). In Germany a device called a radish slicer is used to get nice and even slices. I saw one on the German amazon website (amazon.de) made by Fackelmann, it's called a Rettichschneider - neat little gadget.
