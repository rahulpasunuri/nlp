really really really delicious. I used a really fresh, again really delicious baguette, the sandwich filling oozed out ...we still thought it was great. But it was messy. It might have been easier to stay together if our bread wasn't so crusty.

This receipe was so delicious and easy to make. I brushed the garlic olive oil on the eggplant and tomato before seasoning with S&P. The flavor was amazing! I will definitely make this agian - tonight in fact!

This was a really great way to use the bbq and have a healthy meal at the end of it on a summer week night, They were really easy to assemble, and the ingredients were super fresh and spoke for themselves

These sandwiches are deeee-licious! They were perfect exactly as the recipe was, but 2nd time we added slices of dry salami with excellent results. Yum.

Absolutely delish! A friend made it for superbowl weekend and we LOVED it! Can't wait to make it myself!

A very good sandwich! It could use even more garlic, if desired. I used onion rolls instead, which was also very good. I would definitely make this again.

This was a very tasty sandwich. My husband who claims he doesn't like goat cheese loved this sandwich.

It was winter when I made this recipe and since good tomatoes weren't available, I substituted freshly grilled red peppers. I also used more oil and garlic and added a touch of mayonnaise. It's a darn good sandwich cooked entirely on the grill and served with a bowl of soup.
