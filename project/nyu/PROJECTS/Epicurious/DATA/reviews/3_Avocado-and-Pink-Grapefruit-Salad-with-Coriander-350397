Well...I don't really know what to say. The idea sounded good--the mix of textures and flavors sounded good. The reality was that we hated this. I'm glad it was just the two of us and that I could toss it without feeling guilty. The avocado and grapefruit we used were grown on our property, so I know its not the fruit. The combo was just completely off for us.

I didn't want a display salad, I wanted everything mixed together. Was fine, and salad turned out well. But: if you chop the grapefruit you get a lot of juice, so the salad is watery. I also used wild spinach (yum.) and ground dried ginger and fresh coriander. Dressing was very good.

I just made this and it is fabulous. It helped that the grapefruit I used was deliciously ripe, and more on the sweet side that sour. The dressing is wonderful! I will definitely make this again. And it is so easy!

I made this for a potluck and it just disapeared which is always a good sign. I didn't have enough grapefruit overall so I added a smidge of orange juice to the dressing and it definitely sweetened things up but it turned out really good. Very refreshing.

I chose to make this salad as a meal instead of a side dish, I made a double batch of the dressing and used half to marinade chicken tenderloins in and serve on top of the salad about 45 min... It was delicious, the avocado and grapefruit were a great combo of flavors, and the chicken gave it more substance... we are going to try it w/ shrimp next time for a great warm weather meal. As a note I could not find regular pink grapefruit at my grocery store and used ruby red, and it was still delicious!

This is an extremely complex array of tangy flavors, but softened by the avocado. I would not recommend it for a dinner party, but enthusiastically endorse it for people who like to experiment with flavors. Also, it is quite healthy! I used 1 grapefruit instead of 2 and found it quite hearty - I feel like if I used 2 grapefruits, it would have been a main course instead of a side.

This salad was so good. I didn't include/forgot about the coriander because it's really not my favorite flavor, and the dressing was still delicious. The creamy avocado paired perfectly with the grapefruit.

I loved the dressing, and I did love the grapefruit-avocado combo, but the second time I made it I used oranges. This seemed to produce a more harmonious dish.

Like the dressing, but otherwise thought the combination of flavors was a little off. Maybe I am just not a grapefruit person; I thought its flavor was just too strong.

I've made this several times. The dressing is excellent.

Wonderful salad, great starter or light midday meal. Dressing was incredible, and like the other review would be great on other salads. I wouldn't change anything.

This was a delicious light salad. I would make it again. The dressing would be great on other salads too.
