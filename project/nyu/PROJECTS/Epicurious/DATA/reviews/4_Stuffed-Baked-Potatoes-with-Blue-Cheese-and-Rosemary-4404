Solid recipe for a classic! For a twist I opted to fold in chives and roasted garlic cloves and olive oil in place of the butter. You may want to amp up the rosemary or use thyme. The creamy blue and sour cream added just the right amount of depth and robust flavor.

I used this recipe as a base for my potatoes. I used dill instead of rosemary. I forgot to put the garlic in. That would have been better. I substituted nonfat greek yogurt for the sour cream. I also added green onions which was awesome!!

Really good...made with provolone and goat cheese blend...cheated and microwaved for 15 mins first to cut down cooking time...it is a work week. Made with creme Fraiche....delicious!

What a great recipe! I served this as a side to the Buffalo Chicken Burgers recipe, and it was a hit. Also, I tried it once again with sweet potatoes, still came out perfect. Will be saving this one!

Perfect indulgent comfort food, and really simple to make. I used an inexpensive blue cheese from the supermarket, and you could barely taste it, although it was still creamy and lovely. Next time I'll try a stronger blue such as a roquefort... will definitely be making this again soon!

I thought the filling tasted a little bland as listed here, so I added 1/4 cup chevre. It made the filling creamy and delicious. Loved it!

I used a previous reviewer's advice, and used what was leftover in the fridge... carmelized onions, gorgonzola, butter, salt, and a bit of ricotta cheese... good, cheap, easy and filling... all that a poor student needs

I made this with Sunday dinner, and my always picky-icky pre-schooler and toddler yummed it up! This was SO EASY and delicious. It's also a very attractive side dish.

I loved this recipe made one substitution, made with gorgonzolla instead of blue cheese. Otherwise followed recipe to a T.

Delicious. I used gorgonzola instead of blue and substituted carmelized onions for the garlic. I also skipped the rosemary because I think the texture would be odd and used minced chives to dress it up a bit. Very, very good served with the filet mignon w/ mushroom ragout recipe found on this site and roasted asparagus. A classic combo all around.

I only made two potatoes, so I had to cut the recipe in thirds. I would increase the cheese a little, but loved them this time. Just about what I had envisioned.

These were a big hit at my dinner party and everyone wanted the recipe. I took the advice of another reader and used low-fat sour cream.

With modifications... do not use the Rosemary it conflicts with the blue cheese. Try with Tarragon, if another spice is thought to be necessary.

Very yummy. I reduced butter and used low-fat sour cream and it was still good. I found myself standing there eating from the bowl instead of stuffing the potatoes. For those with no time or gardens, don't listen to the purists - nuke the taters before stuffing (then bake for second period) and use dried rosemary. Still comes out great.

It was love at first bite for us with these potatoes. To save time I zapped the potatoes in the microvwave and finished per directions. The rosemary and cheese (I used gorgonzola) blended perfectly, and the amounts suggested are perfect. Although neither the rosemary nor cheese stands out, the bleu cheese flavor permeates the potatoes, so the dish is definitely for someone who likes such cheese or similar. In the realm of twice baked potatoes this recipe is one of the easiest, tastiest and least caloric, given the few ingredients.

This is time consuming, but worth the effort. I baked the potatoes earlier in the day, then got them ready later for my meal.I used feta cheese. Yum Yum

Loved it. Just what I was looking for (my mother has a similar recipe but wasn't home to tell me how to make it). Made it twice in one week-lots of blue cheese in my fridge. It was better when I chopped the rosemary finely.

This is one of my all-time favorite Bon Appetite recipes. Always a hit. I make it every year around the holidays. I recommend baking the potatoes as stated in the recipe. The skins are firmer and make perfect shells.

Rich, delicious, and easy. Pretty fast, too...at least in terms of active work time. I was surprised at how subtle the flavors were. They really come together very nicely.

This was really good. Do not need to pipette it just mash and stir in ingredients and put back in skins for cooking just like you would with twice baked potatoes. It was really good

Rating: 4
I followed an earlier suggestion and microwaved the potatoes 15 minutes instead of baking for an hour and 15 minutes. The potatoes were a little mushy but it was a great quick meal for a tired college student. ---Edited to say: I made this a second time, this time without the shortcuts and with extra rosemary, and it was fantastic and so easy. I'm going to try this one out on my parents when I go home for the holidays.

If you like blue cheese you will LOVE this recipe. It is easy and really great. I took it to a pot luck and everyone wanted the recipe. Awesome with any kind of baked or roasted meat. We had it with pork tenderloin and it was perfect. A definite must try.

My wife loved this recipe and it looked absolutely spectacular, but I found the bleu cheese a little overpowing for my taste. Next time I will try a sharp cheddar and maybe leave out the rosemary. But this was a very easy side dish to make and it is a good start to something.

This was delicious and easy to prepare. It's great that it can be done ahead and reheated. I will definitely make it again for special guests!

Stunning with a steak. I substituted some things, like gorgonzola for blue cheese, and creme frache (sp?) for sour cream. Next time I'll try either roasting the garlic first, or making a paste with it using coarse salt and chopping,and check before adding any more salt later. Even with the garlic texture the flavors were originally combined in heaven. Yum yum.

This is a great recipe! I tried it out on my family and they loved it. I can't wait to try it on company. The flavors were not overpowering. I did not add the sour cream on top, I think that would have been too much and would have interfered with the balance of flavors. They were wonderful.

In a word....AWESOME!! I modified the recipe for 2 people. I used light sour cream and instead of butter, I used some olive oil that I had roasted garlic & rosemary in. You can only imagine how good that was! I used rosemary from the garden and 2 cloves of garlic (we love garlic!). I baked at 400 for 25 minutes but it wasn't browned yet so I put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes. I also cheated and initially cooked the potatoes in the microwave for 12 minutes instead of baking for 1 hour+. Next time, I make this recipe, I'm going to do half the potatos like this and the other half with a pesto mixture instead of the blue cheese!

If the Queen of England were coming to my house for dinner and I wanted to impress here with a potato dish, this would be my choice. My kids fight over the leftovers (if any!)

We loved this recipe. It was delicious and creamy.I would never use dried rosemary...can't imagine it without fresh from the garden rosemary. Will definately make this again.

Delicious. Adjusted the recipe for 2 potatoes - used about a teaspoon dried rosemary. Used two cloves garlice and I think next time I'll use just one. Was just a little dry, but I may have baked it a little too long. With some steamed broccoli on the side - it was a great vegetarian dinner.

Excellent twice baked recipe. Did not cut down the rosemary as others had recommended. We did not find it overpowering (maybe they used dried not fresh?). Next time I will pop them back into the oven after I crumble the blue cheese on top. Then add the sour cream.

I took the previous cooks advice and cut down on the rosemary. This is a definite keeper. Blue cheese and potatoes, delicious!

I've been making these potatoes since the recipe came out in Nov '97. If you like blue cheese, these are unbelievable! My family loves them and I'm making them right now to take for Thanksgiving dinner this year!

This was one of the best potato dishes I've made. The subtle blue cheese flavor was a wonderful compliment to the tenderloin with merlot sauce. I cut down a bit on the rosemary since we aren't huge fans and it tasted perfect. Can't wait to make it again for friends to show off!!!!

The rosemary overpowers the taste of the bleu cheese...we will look for other recipes for twice-baked potatoes!!!

My Thanksgiving guests visibly blanched when they saw the size of the potato placed on their plate next to a mountain of other dishes. However, after a taste, everyone practically swallowed these whole. No one touched anything else on the table until every potato was scraped clean!

Excellent side dish that was as big a hit as the main course (Sirloin Steak). We made extra potatoes and froze them; cooking for about 45 minutes from the frozen state about a week later. These potatoes are much easier to make than what one would think. We used a spoon to but the finished potato-cheese-sour cream mixture back into the skins; running through a cake decorating tip isn't necessary.
