I love cookies and cream, so this cake was a perfect dessert for me.

Made this for my 8 year old on his birthday. We usually have the store bought ice cream cake, and I was waiting to hear the big sigh about the homemade one....but it never came! The cake was exceptional and a really big hit! I, too, thought the layer of fudge on top was very thick and when I make it again I will just discard some in the end. I think you do need to add the chocolate chips to it though--to get that thick pastey texture. Well done though. I will definitely make this again.

Whoa,now! There is more cake in this than ice cream. While tasting good, it was not what I expected. I would skip the second layer of cake in favor of MORE ICE CREAM. Also the fudge toping was a bit too much, and I like hot fudge. I would skip adding the chocolate chips next time.

I love this recipe and a favorite among friends. I use 3 cups cookies and cream ice cream and then make another layer (with more pound cake in the middle) of Coffee ice cream. Great cake!

You can't mess this up. It is delicious! I prepare a box cake mix, and slice into 3 or 4 layers and make a multi-layer cake. Brownies work well but make the ice cream cake very rich. Our favorite is chocolate cake with raspberry sherbet. Delicious!!

I have made this cake many times for different occassions and it was a big hit everytime. I have used brownie on the bottom instead of pound cake, and omit the second layer of cake and use more oreos. You can use your favorite kind of ice cream. I also push the whipped cream on top around the edges leaving the big center full of fudge and decorations.

I made this for a birthday dinner and it was a huge hit. With modifications for ease, it was basically an assembly project. I reduced the hot fudge and chocolate chips by 1/2, used an entire half gallon of ice cream, a bakery pound cake and Cool Whip instead of whipped cream on the sides. Decorated with sprinkles, candles and icing. Very pretty and delicious and people thought it was much more work than it was.

This is a great ice cream cake recipe! I did make a couple changes..made the bottom layer with coffee ice cream, then the middle of cookies and the top of cookies/cream ice cream. I did decorate the outside as the last person did with oreo cookies. Made for a pretty display. Very tasty and yes very sweet, but liked by all! I'm gettin ready to make this for Thanksgiving. Ok..not very traditional, but it was requested. :)

The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and found that the amount of fudge sauce called for is overpowering. You need a glass of milk finish a slice - it is that sweet. The problem is that there is too little ice cream and too much fudge -- there is a middle layer of cookies and fudge followed by a top layer of fudge. The second time I made it, I omitted the middle cookie/fudge layer. I used the oreos to decorate the outside of the cake instead. I also baked a yellow cake and cut it in half instead of buying one and cutting it up into triangles. This made for a more balanced cake -- more ice cream and cake and fudge as a topping.

My friends call this my cake-in-a-bowl since that's how I served it both times, but, more importantly, they request it all the time. The first time I made it as close to the recipie as possible until it fell to the side and I up-ended it in a bowl. Nevertheless, it was a huge hit and almost completely eaten by 8 adults. The second time, I made the pound cake in 2 9in pans and I found assembling it to be less messy. Again, it did end up in a bowl, but this time it was a pasta bowl functioning as a serving tray. I used only chocolate candies on top -- M&Ms were festive. super crowd pleaser.

Hosting a children's sleep-over birthday party for 12 10 year olds is a challenge!! - BUT, this recipe was not and it was a huge hit. I got raves from all the girls for this one!! (remember to put the candies on just BEFORE you serve the cake. I froze the cake with them on it in error and WOW! were the jellied candies ever hard!

This cake was very easy to make because of the bought pound-cake. The fudge layer was way too sweet though. I made it with mint chip ice cream. I'd do it again but maybe without the fudge or something less sweet. And probably with regular frosting.

I made the recipe with brownies instead of the pound cake and cooked them slightly underdone as suggested in a previous review. Then a layer of cookies and cream ice cream, (skipped the cookie/candy layer), a layer of chocolate fudge, and then chocolate ice cream topped with cool whip. My family loved it. I would defiantly make this again.

This recipe felt a bit clumbsy, since it calls for cutting up pre-made pound cake and freezing the layers took a good deal of time. The cake was too sweet and I needed a glass of milk as a chaser. I would make this again with more ice cream and without the middle layer of fudge sauce. This is a good recipe for kids to assist with.

C'est si bon! It's fun (and messy) to make. Kids and adults love it and it's even greater because if you, like me, don't like red hots but love gummy worms and M&Ms and jelly beans, you can mix and match! This is the coolest cake ever, but I don't get the cutting up IN TRIANGLES the cake. It's easier in squares or just tearing that puppy up! C'est si fun!

This was tasty, but it didn't turn out as I hoped. It was very hard to cut (the frozen cake), and it just didn't seem worth the time involved for the end product. Be sure you let it thaw a few minutes before cutting the cake.

I made this for a dinner party as a trial for my daughter's birthday cake. All four adults agreed, too much fudge, the cake was of no use, and there were not enough Oreos. Also, we didn't leave it out of the freezer long enough and it was very hard to cut!

this cake is both amazing & fool-proof. i mixed 2 flavors of ice cream, both vanilla based, although next time i'll do layers of vanilla, chocolate, etc. i mixed in a variety of chopped cookies to the ice cream & also sprinkled them between layers. in place of the poundcake i made brownies that i was able to cut out in 10" circles for the layers [slightly undercook them or they will freeze too hard]. like others i used more ice cream, about 3/4+ gallon. since i forgot to cover the top with the fudge [oops], i served it hot on the side along with various toppings [especially heath bar crunch balls!!]and the whipped cream. everyone loved it, both kids & adults and are begging me to make it again. i will asap!

I felt this was a wonderful recipe. It also saves money everyone loves an icecreem cake. I didn't care for all the candy on top. But that is of course something that can be altered to taste.

IT WAS VERY GOOOD AND EASY TO MAKE;...A YEAR-ROUND FAVORITE IN MY HOUSE.

Good. The problem I had was that it did not stick together between the chopped cookies and second layer of cake. This made it difficult to slice and serve. Did any one else have this problem, or did I do something wrong? Even so, it was yummy!

awesome...kids decorated this and said it was the best. I skipped the whipped cream. You can also substitute brownies for the pound cake.

Like others, I added more ice cream than stated, and omitted the "whipped cream on the sides". As it was a birthday, I topped it with many Smarties (I know what you are thinking - what is a Smartie? It is a Canadian M&M-type candy), and served it with sliced sugared strawberries and whipped cream. Received rave reviews. Next time I may try an adult version with mocha ice cream and some Kahlua in the fudge sauce.

I just made this cake for my son's 1st Birthday today! I also made a carrot cake thinking that it would be good for the adults, and the kids could eat the ice cream cake. Even though the carrot cake was delicious, everyone wanted the ice cream cake. It looked so amazingly festive and tempting, no one could resist. The M&Ms and gumdrops, and mulicolored sprinkles on top made it look great! I thought that it would be too sweet, but it was really very good. Others in my family are already requesting this for their Bdays!!!

I made this from my father-in-law's 78th birthday and my son's 7th birthday. They both loved it! When I made it the 2nd time, I used more ice cream otherwise I think the fudge is overpowering. My husband didn't like the whipped cream on the side of the cake so I left it off the 2nd time around. My son has already requested this cake again for his next birthday.

The cake was easy to make and all the kids(and adults) enjoyed it. I also used more ice cream than the recipe called for. It was very tasty. The whipped cream was my least favorite part. Maybe I would have liked the fudge around the sides but that might have been too difficult to do. Any suggestions anyone?

If you enjoy rich sweet desserts, this recipe is the one for you. I used a whole half gallon of ice cream. Six cups isn't enough to taste the ice cream. Very good, but it definitely melts quickly. Serve it and refreeze fast.

I made this cake for my son's 9th birthday. It is very rich. He loved it. I agree with the cook from CA., the ice cream was lost. I would use more next time. This is perfect for a child's party. Rich for the adults. Very, Very sweet.

I made this cake for my son's birthday, everyone loved it. I used a whole half gallon of ice cream instead of just 6 cups. The cake was sinful and the presentation excellent. I would make it again, it's a perfect frozen dessert to serve in the hot summers here in Arizona.

I just made this for my niece's 8th birthday. Everyone loved it! My biggest problem with the cake was that we served it outside on a hot day and it melted into a mess when we cut it. The cake didn't look as marvelous as the picture, but it tasted great!

Absolutely sinful!!! The flavors were great. Especially the fudge layers. I would make the cake slices even smaller and make the ice cream layer much thicker. We really couldn't even see or taste any of the ice cream.
