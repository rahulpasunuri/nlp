Elegant and delicious dessert. We substituted the prunes with organic dried black figs, marinated in a tawny port, and placed the almonds on top of the custards in custard cups. We also used farm-fresh eggs with deep orange yolks (from chickens that actually run and eat gravel & grubs) and raw cream. The scent was heavenly. Served warm. Next time we might add a sprinkle of frech grated nutmeg.
