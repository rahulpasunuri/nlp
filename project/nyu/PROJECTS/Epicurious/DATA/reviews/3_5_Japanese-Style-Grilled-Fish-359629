We made this recipe with trout. It was alright, but don't think we will make it again.

I tried this with bluefish filets and found it to be way too sweet, even though I cut back some on the sugar. The sweetness of the marinade was overpowering and really took away from being able to enjoy the flavor of the actual fish. Won't be making this one again.

Very easy to prepare and my kids loved it. I made this with frozen whole mackerel from the local grocery store and had use a chardonnay in lieu of the sake (no dry white on hand). Any recipe that can win over a 5 and an 8 year old with an oily fish like mackerel is a winner in my book.

Easy & very good. And very quick if, like me, you don't bother to cook the marinade & only marinate the fish for about 15 minutes at room temp. Delicious!

I forgot to mention that I used pecan wood chips for the smoke flavor. The leftovers were great cold.

A really great way to grill fish. Used catfish, followed recipe, and cooked on hot charcoal grill. Wonderful flavor, and fish was nice and moist. Served with home-grown tomato, mazzerella and fresh roasted pepper (roasted pepper before grilling fish) salad with basil dressing, and a baguette. Great dinner! My wife said that it was the best catfish I have made.

I have been looking for an appealing way to prepare the mackeral I catch to use as bait and the oily bluefish I catch incidently while fishing for striped bass. Mostly I have been smoking the blues, but this recipe looks just yummy. I'll post my comments after I make it next week.
