This was really good!! Use a quality Jasmine rice. I added some garlic powder and onion powder, a dash of sesame oil and cooked it all with chicken broth instead of water. This will become a rice standard at my house!

It's good with some soy added. I think i should have served it with a more exciting main dish than plain grilled fish.

I loved this. It is a wonderful side dish to have with spicy Asian foods - made it with Chicken Curry. I used olive oil and slightly less salt.

A delicious change of pace for rice. Extremely simple, and tasty. I used brown basmati rice, and sesame oil instead of peanut for a stronger nutty flavor. Also, try tossing the rice with the oil and salt BEFORE adding the water. It gives the rice a nice texture when finished.

Excellent recipe: delicious, fast, and nutritious. I sauteed some broccoli on the side with ginger and tamari and it was perfect! The sesame oil and toasted seeds absolutely make it.

It was good. But not amazing. I added sesame oil instead of what the instructions called for. Was looking for some sort of punch. Still if you can get soybeans in a recipie, thats a good thing. Nice neutral dish

If you like your soy beans crunchy, then this cooking time would probably suit you, as would the instructions on the frozen bag of edamame for 5 minutes. I prefer mine softer so I cooked them for 20 minutes and added them at the end. I can't believe I forgot the sesame seeds, I even forgot to toast them. I was so intent on making for the first time the Glazed Grilled Salmon on this site, which I mention here because it's just great. I'm sure the sesame seeds will add a lot of flavor to my leftover rice, which was very good anyway. I did add a few drops of sesame oil, a nice touch. I'm delighted to have this recipe as there are so few using edamame, such a healthy vegetable.

I loved this dish. I also substituted chicken broth for water and used less salt. I only needed about 1 1/2 cups of broth since I made it in my rice cooker which uses less liquid. It was perfect! I'm a big fan of Edamame so anytime I can, I throw them in. I never thought of using them in rice before. This is a keeper for me.

I made the rice according to the box directions and added the boiled soybeans only at the end. I didn't add any salt and it was still very tasty. It was great with the Oven Roasted Sea Bass with Ginger Lime Sauce!

I substituted chicken broth for the water and cut down on the amount of salt. All of my guests raved about this dish.

This is such a simple and delicious side dish. I loved it and have already made it twice. I didn't change a thing about it.

Although this is a simple recipe, I love the rice and sesame flavors together. I'm not a big soybean fan, so I left those out. Also, I use sesame oil to give it a bit more kick rather than the peanut oil. A great side dish with fish!

I used calrose rice and used no oil. Unlike the last reviewer, I did not expect fireworks of flavor, however it was a wonderful side dish to serve with asian food, fish, or just about any meal. I used soy sauce at the table. Fresh soybeans are addictive no matter what they are in! This recipe will become a standard at my house!

This recipe is on the bland and flat side, so I added Soy sauce to it at just before serving. In Maui, we add soy to rice and other vegetable to add flavor. A little goes a long way. My guests all loved it with my changes. May want to add more toasted sesame seeds. It was good cold the next day too.
