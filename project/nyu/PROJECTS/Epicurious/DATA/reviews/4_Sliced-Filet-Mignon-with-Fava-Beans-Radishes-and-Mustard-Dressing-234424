I used frozen peeled fava beans available at the Asian grocery stores. Don't use dry herbs as it obviously will not taste as good as the fresh herbs. I added lime zest to the dressing

Made this as a birthday dinner for myself. It was equally delicious and beautiful. I will definitely make it again!

Very tasty. However, the fava beans are time consuming to prepare -- but, absolutely delicious! Made the recipe exactly as written and it worked beautifully.

I used edamame instead of favas & "beauty heart" radish from my CSA...they looked just like the picture!I made a little more sauce for the steaks by adding some red wine to the butter in the pan to deglaze it. I used mint & basil for the herbs. Don't skip the feta--it is for more than just garnish! I'd give it 4 forks for presentation, probably just 3 for taste...I guess I like my steaks with warm stuff.

I didn't have fava beans at home, so I used peas instead. This was easy to make and very good! I will try the fava beans next time.

You know you're onto a winner when you hear "Wow!" as soon as you put the plates on the table. I served this dish with thinly sliced potatoes, deep-fried in extra-virgin olive oil circling the central presentation of the steaks atop the salad. The next word heard was "Yum!" - this from my 17-year-old daughter. Presentation, flavour, ease of preparation ... this dish has it all.

I thought overall the combo was great, with one exception; tarragon and basil should never be on the same plate. I knew this going in and all was fine, but the author really botched that one...

I made this dish last night substituting lima beans for fava (my local store wasn't currently caring any), added roma tomatoes, and used fresh basil and thyme. It was very good, and even my boyfriend who was a little scared enjoyed it. :)

Super-fast and a great, light spring dish, this was delicious. I used frozen fava (broad) beans that were not peeled, but just cooked them for 3 minutes (from frozen) and they were completed cooked and peeled very easily. I did marinate the beans and radishes (about 45 min) and the radishes remained crisp. I used fresh sage and thyme as the herbs, and found the feta went perfectly - it added a creaminess and accentuated the salt on the steak and in the dressing. With toasted pita or naan - fantastic.

This is a delicious steak salad. I was worried the radishes would get soggy in the dressing, so I didn't mix them all together. Instead, I layered the plate with the favas, then radishes, then dotted with dressing (with thyme mixed in), sprinkled with parseley, then steak slices and feta. The feta is unnecessary tastewise but looks pretty. When fava beans are out of season, arugula would be a good substitute. Champagne would be a good wine pairing, especially on a hot night in the summer.
