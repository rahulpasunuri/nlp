I did this recipe with only one substitution - swapped blood orange segments for the grapes. We had this for Christmas dinner and it was truly memorable. The red cabbage and wild rice was earthy, nutty, sweet, crunchy and a little tang from the vinegar - perfection!

You can use chicken. Sauce is very good. cook the rice according to the package instructions, adding in 1/2 tsp salt and 2 tsp margarine. Any type of raisins are ok. YOu can sub canola oil for olive oil. for the gin (vermouth) you can sub vodka. If you do not want to open a can of tomato paste, you can use 2 tsp ketchup. If you use bite size pcs of meat, you can skip the oven step. If you need to add some cornstarch in water to thicken sauce, do not worry--comes out fine.

I would double this rating if I could! If I had a restaurant - I'd be 4-star with this dish!! I'm writing in May because I just had some frozen leftovers from when I made this dish in December for Christmas! It froze & thawed beautifully. I read all reviews & adjusted my taste. Someone suggested preparing the birds/stock the night before, which worked well. I started with whole pheasant (2 birds). Pieced and left the bones in. I found the wild rice to be expensive for a tiny box so I bought one box and supplimented the rest with mixed grain/brown rice. This was perfect since the wild rice was still crunchy - turned out to be a nice touch/texture but not overwhelming as the solo. I stayed pretty true to the recipe but I watched the sauce/liquid as I cooked as some people had drying issues. I think I still could have used more (but then again I always have trouble with rice) I used a dried berry mix instead of raisins and added mushrooms. This was my first time cooking pheasant and after taking my time with this recipe -- I can't wait to make it again! Enjoy...

We bought boned-out pheasant already cut into pieces, and that significantly cut down the prep time. Used chicken stock, didn't use gin, savoy cabbage instead of red, and champagne vinegar rather than red wine vinegar. Served with roasted winter squash and lime-scented grated cooked beets. The rice simply did not cook, and soaked up all the liquid. I threw that out, but we enjoyed all the flavors of the meal and didn't miss the rice. It was a wonderful Thanksgiving meal for two !

Wonderful. I used chic stock instead of making my own. I made the sauce ahead of time and used dried cranberries. The rice was wonderful and went with the dish so nicely. I served a pinot with it and everyone loved it

First, the rice. The liquid in the rice recipe is wrong. Wild Rice has a 4-1 ratio of liquid to rice. The flavors were interesting, and you can substitue regular onions and add celery and carrots if you desire. Second, the sauce. It is great but.... The grapes and minced rosemary add nothing to the sauce, as they are vitually raw; put them in the braising pot to soften so they can impart their flavors. Try butchering the pheasant the night before and make up some pheasant stock (pheasant parts, bay leaf, parsely, onions, carrots, turnipis etc) for the sauce instead of these directions, it will be better stock and will save to time when you make the recipe and will make a nice brown carmely sauce. Strain it and let it chill to skim off fat the next day. Fourth budgeting time. The dish takes most of a day, so plan to a few things the day before, like the stock, the rice, the bacon, and whatever desert you are planning. The Pheasant can be braised and set aside an hour or two and all you have to do is heat up the sauce.

My husband brought home 4 pheasants from a hunting trip, and having never made pheasant before, I naturally turned to Epicurious to find a recipe. The recipe did take a lot of prep time, but the mixture of flavors was amazing. The sauce was marvelous and I wish I had doubled it. The wild rice was good, but took much longer than an hour to cook, but that was fine, as the pheasant took longer to make that I had planned, so everything got done at the same time. Complex flavors, a bit time consuming, but marvelous.

Outstanding! The flavors were fresh and blended together excellently. We used skinless breasts and mixed 1/2cup of brown rice with 1/2cup of wild rice. I thought that all wild rice would be a little too strong. It worked. The sweet and sour red cabbage and rice mixture blew me away. It was so good all asked for seconds and thirds. The only regret I have is that I didn't make enough sauce. I failed math 101 and did not scale it right for 6 people. A must do again. Next time maybe with Elk or Venison.

We are cooks that enjoy the prep as equaly as the eating, with this, the instrutions were contorted at best, the phesant would have done best by being browning in a hot pan then slow cooked in the oven with sauce. The results were tasty, despite the frustration and lack of fun in the preperation.

This dish was very flavorful. Preperation takes a lot of time, but the results were splended. I used dried cranberries insted of raisens and I mixed the bacon with the cabbage laying it over the rice. Outstanding!

My son brought home a wild pheasant after a recent hunting trip. I used this recipe and it was absolutely delicious. I substituted dried cherries--the sauce was wonderful. Everyone agreed. The pheasant was nice and moist and the wild rice not only tasted great but was very pretty to serve.

In the red cabbage I added julieanned apples and mixed a 1/2 tsp of balsamic vinegar to the misture. In the pheasant, instead of raisins (i am not a fan of raisins) I used dried apricots, chopped and it worked just fine. I also added sliced fresh brown mushrooms in the final 15 minutes of cooking.
