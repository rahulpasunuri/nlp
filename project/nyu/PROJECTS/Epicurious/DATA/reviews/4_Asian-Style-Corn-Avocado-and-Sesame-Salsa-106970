Amazingly good! Can't wait to have a party to serve this! - added cilantro, used sriracha instead of sambal oelek, to taste - great as a side dish!

Excellent! Tasty. Can be used as a side dish.

I used frozen corn and added the lime and cilantro suggested by others as well as a little extra chili paste. I served it with grilled pork tenderloin and it was exceptional!

I've made this many times, usually with Halibut and Sambal vinegarette (recipe this site) But it's hard to resist eating with a fork by itself. I've even used this with Pork Loin and it just can't be beat!

This was delicious and I would make it again for sure!I think the additions of lime and cilantro would be great. Served over peppered tuna steak.

This is great! Quite spicy alone, but it mellows with food. I serve over salmon with a honey-soy glaze and the flavors really complement each other

Very good change from mexican-style salsa. I tried adding fresh cilantro and it was delicious. I served it over a marinated tuna steak aside black mushroom and spinach jasmine rice.

Good, but I strongly recommend squeezing half a lime in there too, as the taste is a bit flat without the extra acid. The lime brings it to life, baby!

VERY good. Served with grilled shrimp and it was a big hit, but then again, how can a recipe with avocado in it be bad?

This rates 4 forks in my book because it not only is delicious, but it's unique. I found the flavors all blended together very well, and it's so good, the leftovers didn't last long in my fridge! I would stand there with a fork finishing it off. It's a little chunky for a salsa, but it makes a wonderful side dish. I followed the recipe exactly, including the sambal oelek, which is easy to find in the DC area. Definitely try this.
