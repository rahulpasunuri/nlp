I made this exactly as the recipe is written except I removed the skin from the chicken, only used one large onion and roasted it in my 5 1/2 quart dutch oven. It came out wonderful--perfectly cooked and the sauce from all of the fruits/veggies was so good. My family was very leary about this based on the recipe, but everyone thought it was delicious. The only change I would make is to brown the chicken on the stove top before roasting. Served this with Isreali Cousous (Trader Joes), with toasted pine nuts and lemon zest. It was a perfect accompaniment.

Simple to prepare but simple taste too, maybe because we used white peaches

I cooked a split chicken breast in a le creuset pot at about 350-375 degrees for about an hour. The bone-in breast has much more flavor than the boneless breasts. I used one large vidalia onion and spread my homemade canned jardiniere mixture on top of the chicken(the mixture includes jalapenos, carrots, and celery in white vinegar topped off with olive oil, basil and a clove of garlic). I took the skin off the chicken as well. Then, I used about 10 DelMonte sliced cling peaches cut up in smaller chunks. I did not use any other seasoning. I made some jasmine rice in my rice cooker as well. Healthy cooking and an outstanding sweet heat flavor!

great base recipe. very simple preparation. I have made it twice this summer with the following changes: only use 2 onions, remove all seeds from lemons. Use a gas grill for all the cooking; first sear the chicken on direct heat for 5 minutes per side, then add to baking dish as cook over indirect heat as per original recipe. after the chicken is cooked through, remove the meat and keep covered on a plate. Puree the fruit/veggies from the baking dish in a blender with the liquid. strain about half of it into a saucepan, add some chicken stock, white wine, and reduce. Add a knob of butter, honey, and salt until sauce is balanced. Serve with quinoa cooked with fresh peas, tiny tomatoes and sauteed onion. adds a bit of finishing time to the dish but well worth the extra effort!!

We thought this was very good -- I was halfway through preparation when I realized that I didn't have the jalapenos, so I threw in some red pepper flakes for a kick, and it was fine. The green of the jalapeno would make a better presentation. There was plenty of sauce just from the peaches, etc. We especially liked the way the garlic tasted - very mild and an interesting complement to the peaches.

This was an interesting and complex combination of flavors. Throughout dinner my 13 year old kept mumbling, "This is really good. This is really good." I thought an hour and 20 minutes was way too much time to cook chicken breasts, but they were perfect. This is a good way to use up the peaches from the farmer's market and the jalapenos in the garden.

I tried this recipe with almost over ripe peaches. I expected them to break down a little into a sauce, they didn't. I had no pan juices at all. I deglazed the pan with some vermouth and peach juice though and it made a great sauce. This recipe has potential but I will not make it again as written. I would add the peach juice and vermouth to the pan in the beginging.

This is an incredibly delicious dish! I have made it several times for friends and it is always a big hit. Definite keeper.

Won't make again. Interesting concept on paper, but didn't come together for us. One of the few recipes on this site that won't get a second try.

Worked great for me! I used frozen peach slices because I'm scouting recipes for when the peach tree at our newly-purchased house produces fruit in March. This recipe is a keeper.

The key is using bone in skin on chicken and following the cooking time exactly. This was a gorgeous tasting dish. I used one onion I found using more would be overkill and I love onions. The next day it was even better and tasted like it was cooked in wine. Gorgeous. Will make this again!

This is a wonderfully simple dish. The one important change I would recommend is using skinless chicken. Otherwise, this is a popular one in my house!

Easy enough to make. I just didn't find the juices that amazing. I wish I had used leaner chicken; the juices were a bit greasy and perhaps masked the flavor.

Well, my garbage disposal enjoyed it. This was truly awful.

Wonderful recipe. The phrase my guests kept repeating was "This is a keeper!". It's the wrong time of year in Western Maryland for fresh peaches - I used canned with nice success.

Interesting recipe, who would have thought that onions and peaches could be so delicious together
