In the hands of a more experienced baker, this might be four forks. In my hands, it was tasty and I want to make it again to see if it turns out better (I had it at a local Egyptian restaurant and it was one of the best desserts I've ever had...). USED semolina flour and topped with vanilla yoghurt instead of whipped cream, which was delicious. I made some MISTAKES: 1.) I only had a 9x13.5" pan, and I guess since the batter was spread a bit thinner in the larger-than-suggested pan size, the cake only took 25 min to bake. I don't know if that means it was dryer than it should have been or not... it tasted great, I just think it could have been better. 2.)The syrup did not turn syrupy- I put a lid on the pot while it was simmering, so maybe you are supposed to leave it uncovered?
