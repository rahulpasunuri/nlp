I made this last night for A New Year's Eve party at a neighbor's house. I used the chili garlic sauce instead of the red pepper flakes. Instead of serving the sauce on the side, I brushed it directly on the chicken after I turned them over the first time. I also broiled them longer than the recipe so they were crisp and not greasy. They were good, but they did not knock my socks off.

Delicious and easy! I was wary about corn syrup but it was worth using. I couldn't find wings, so i used drumsticks instead. It goes really well with potato skins.

Made this for a gathering with friends so I increased the recipe (x4) and decided to substitute Vietnamese "Chili Garlic Sauce" for the red pepper. I used 3 table spoons of the chili sauce- spicy and delicious.

Very simple to prepare. Not as spicy hot as I desire.....next time I will double the red pepper.

Akthough it's true this recipe has no Thai flavors, it's still delicious. I've made these for guests several times, they love them. Don't try to grill them however, they are best broiled, which makes them extra crispy.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome of these wings. I wouldn't change a thing on the recipe. Marinating overnight with the oil/garlic is key to this. The sauce mixture is just the right balance to offset the salt and pepper you had on while broiling. I made this for myself just to try it out because I wasn't sure what to expect, as it sounded too simple to have good flavor. I will try this out on guests next, and sure it will be a hit.

This is not a Thai dish- glad it came out all right though.

This was really tasty and pretty easy to make. I did not marinate them overnight as suggested, but they were still excellent. The sauce was not very spicy, and next time I might use less vinegar.
