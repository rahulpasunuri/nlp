This wasn't bad per se, but I couldn't find anything about it that set it apart from plain old roasted chicken. If I were to make this again (which I don't think I will) I would add more onion and definitely more five-spice powder because the flavor of it barely came through at all in the small amount that is used.

I made the recipe exactly as written. My husband was more impressed with this dish than I was. He had 3rds! I wished that the skin had become crisper; it was a little soggy right out of the oven which is unusual for baked chicken with the skin on. Although I am definitely a very big fan of 5 spice powder, the flavor of the chicken was ok but not great.

Quick and easy. Great flavor. goes great with the ginger rice and snow peas.

It is an easy recipe and the result was delicious. I used less salt than the recipe calls for and doubled the marinade. It was a big success at a dinner party. The chicken (taken out of the oven when the meat thermometer was at 140 degrees) was succulent and tender.

FANTASTIC!!! - I make this every couple of months and it is ALWAYS delicious. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I do not find it too salty, but it is important to use the proper salt - it calls for coarse kosher which is going to measure very differently than smaller kosher or table salt. This always turns out super moist. I have made it for guests numerous times and it is always a hit. Absolutely a go-to recipe - marinate over night, pop into the oven the next day and let it bake while you make a few sides - really couldn't be easier

This was good chicken, good, not great. You could have doubled the amount of marinate to improve it.

LOVE these flavors!!! The house smells amazing when it cooks - have made it about a half dozen times now, always make the ginger rice to go with, and vary the veggies. This last time - made stir-fried asparagus and a chinese inspired salad. (this goes great! http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Stir-Fried-Sesame-Asparagus-103789) This is an easy meal if you just marinate it over night, then pop in oven when you get home. Dinner on the table in just less than an hour, and it is company worthy!

I made this per the recipe & marinaded it overnight The flavor was delicious. I used the leftovers in a Chinese chicken salad. Other then too much salt it was delicious. Will make again with less salt.

Very tasty; kids and adults alike enjoyed. Made the entire menu. Would make again, with a bit less salt in the chicken. Might cook the onions a bit before adding the chicken.

Easy to make, tasty and a great source of left overs. If I make this, I can have rice bowls for at least two other meals.

I loved this dish. I halved the salt in the recipe and it turned out perfect. I also marinated it over night, which I think really enhanced the flavor.

Tasty, easy recipe. I toss the chicken with marinade in a plastic bag to ease clean up.

Once again, I should've read the reviews prior to making this. Following the instructions, the dish is way too salty, even for a person who LOVES salt. It was an okay dish but not one I'd make again.

Rating: 3
The overall flavors of this chicken were awesome, but it was WAY too salty. If you make the entire menu with the rice and pea pods, the suggested lunch bowls were a great way to use the leftovers. Minus the saltiness, it was a great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly. Yes, it was salty (only the skin) but the chicken was juicy, tender, and tasty. I will definitely make this again.

My mistake was reading what else you can do with Chinese Five-Spice powder prior to ever tasting it. Once I found out that it can be used quite nicely in gingerbread recipes, it completely ruined the flavor of this chicken for me. To me, the five-spice is something that belongs in sweet dishes -- not savory ones. It's a nice flavor, just not on my chickens, thank-you.

I made this about a month ago. Used 1/2 the salt recommended and it wasn't salty. I also sprinkled more 5 spice powder over the chicken before baking. It was outstanding. I think the kosher salt acts as a bit of a brine when kept in the marinade overnight because it was very moist and tender. Everyone loved it and the aroma during cooking was wonderful.

I really liked this recipe, including the next-day leftovers. I cut the recipe in half and sliced up the garlic instead of just smashed, which worked really well. I splurged (calorie-wise) on the skin-on chicken, but removed it before eating, and the meat was SO tender. Highly recommend! Very, very good.

I followed this recipe to the letter and neither my husband nor I could eat it. I think it was the five-spice with the ginger, cinnamon, anise and fennel. We'd never tasted it before but were willing to give it a try. Even the onions weren't good to us.

I took the advice and cut the salt in half and used fresh 5 spice....it was tender and juicy and had a nice mild flavour.

Definitely not the best chicken recipe on this site, actually very disappointing and to think I made a special trip to the Asian grocery for new Chinese five spice powder. Glad I did not have guests over for this one. Probably will never make again. If you make this cut the salt in half!

Rating: 4
I found this recipe to be truly surprising. I grilled the chicken instead of roasting. It was delightful. The flavor was tasty w/o being overpowering. I served it with snow peas and basmati rice. We'll save this recipe as a "go-to" option for the future.

I agree with the previous reviewer regarding the salt and spices. This chicken is loaded with flavor if your five spice is fresh, however it had too much salt. Try half. Kosher salt is not as salty as regular salt (approximately half strength); this recipe just calls for too much of it. The accompanying menu is perfect with it; we will certainly make it all again.

I was served this at a friend's home and thought it about the best roast chicken I had eaten in years. I decided to make it myself but cut the salt in half - kosher salt is VERY salty, so 1 Tbs is ample. It got rave reviews. I used split chicken breasts, cut in thirds, and chicken legs. We love the leftovers. It is important to use FRESH five spice powder. Don't mess with this recipe, other than the salt. It's terrific, and definitely a keeper.

I have to agree with the other reviewers, the recipe tasted too salty and I even added a few more pieces of chicken to the recipe than what it called for. Ended up tossing the extra pieces I didn't cook away. I had a great flavor is it wasnt for the saltiness. Will try it again without the salt.

Gotta agree with a Cook from Canada. I meant to use chicken but all I had was some billy goat meat dusted with a coarse animal stimulant... The powdered cherry Kool-Aid added nothing to the flavor...

i love these reviews... "i made it without the five-spice and with rabbit and used asparagus instead of onions and it turned out nasty, i don't like it..." a review is supposed to be OF the recipe not of the changes you've done to make it different

I did this on a gas grill on the top rack with a few chunks of apple wood for smoke. Rubbed the mix under the skin before grilling. Cooked skin side down for the first 5 minutes or so to crisp. Left out the salt completely. Drizzled mixture of olive oil/5 spice & garlic powder during cooking. Delicious. Did it again on the grill, added a bit of honey and some hot sauce to the mix...wow. Popped with sweet/spicy flavor. My kids destroyed it.

I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts [dieting). There's a lot of potential here, but I think it's mean't to be made with the skin on. The way I made it, it definitely had too much salt. I'd cut it in half. My 5 spice powder was very old, and I think that caused it to not have as much flavor as the recipe intended. Will definitely try again with fresh 5 spice powder and less salt. I'll definitely try it again.

I, too, used boneless skinless chicken breasts and we also thought it too salty. Will make again with less salt. The snow peas and ginger rice were perfect.

Made the chicken, snow peas and ginger scented rice form the same issue. Too much salt. Used boneless skinless chicken breast and had no greasy issue. Definitely will make again.

Prepared chicken as per recipe, added about 2 cups of chicken broth to roasting pan along lots of carrots, celery and whole shallots and loosely tented w/ foil. Next one I make will have twice the amount of garlic. Great dinner, brought lots of rave from my guests.PS, will add calabasa

Good, but greasy. Used relatively fresh 5-spice powder, which gave this a great flavor. Have made it twice, with the ginger rice recipe from the same issue of Bon Appetit. Both times, my wife devoured it & my 15 month old daughter likes it as well. I found it pretty greasy - even the 2nd time around, being very careful to trim the fat before cooking & not basting too often. Had to put the onions on paper towels to soak up all the grease. That's the only reason it got 3 forks, instead of 4. A simple winner!

I thought this had a very nice flavor. My whole family liked it, but we all agreed it had too much salt. I would halve the amount next time. I also used only chicken thighs, and took the skin off before roasting. I made this whole menu and it was very nice.

I rubbed the chicken with garam masala instead of the 5-spice. That did the trick!

Rating: 3
note that 5 spice powder fluctuates in intensity due to age, dryness, etc. note also that '5 spice powder' may contain more than 5 spices..... I believe this accounts for the varied reviews. Try it with Ras-al-Hanout and lemon peel for a quick trip to Morocco!

very easy dish to prepare my parents loved it with ginger scented rice and sugar snap peas.

This was absolutely wonderful and I didnt change a thing. Also, this was so simple to do for being so busy, that this deserves 5 forks. Will definately be making again and adding the butternut as one reviewer mentioned was a perfect touch. Also would be great for guests.

As written this recipe is close to tasteless and what flavour it has is delivered by the garlic and not the 5 spice. Use at least 2 tsp of five spice but feel free to add lots more. Add soy sauce or ketjap manis, crushed lemongrass, and some grated ginger for a more interesting flavour. The overnight marination is essential or the flavours just stick to the skin which most of the family don't eat!

This recipe is quick, easy, & delicious. My dinner guests really enjoyed it as well & have asked for the recipe. However, I did increase the 5-spice to 1.5 tsp & I used only chicken thighs (7), which I marinated overnight. I will definitely make this again.

Boring! Needed more of everything. The best part was the onions,

I used chicken thighs which marinated for 6 hours. I added cubes of butternut squash as well as the onions. Convection/Bake at 415 degrees for about 35 minutes. Very tasty, quick and easy.

Made this dish last night. Only had an hour to marinate. My girlfrield who hasn't found anything that she likes with Chinese five spice loved it, as did her daughter. Quick and easy. Definately going straight to my "Reciope Box".
