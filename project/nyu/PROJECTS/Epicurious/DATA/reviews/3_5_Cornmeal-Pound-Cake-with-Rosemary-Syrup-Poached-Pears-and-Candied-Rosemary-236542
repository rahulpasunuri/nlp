Letting you know that the pound cake took 20 mins longer than the recipe stated and came out oilier than expected. While the cornmeal flavour was good, the cake was also eggy tasting and retained the crunch of the cornmeal. Much as I wanted to like this, I won't be making it again.

This is a sophisticated and very Italian cake recipe. I added reisling to the syrup. When plating the cake I positioned the pear next to the cake and placed a dollop of fig jam nearby. THen I swirled the thickened syrup over the entire plate. Wow, what a presentation

I followed this recipe to a T and was very impressed. It is slightly time consuming but simple enough. My guests really enjoyed it. My partner thought the piney flavor of Rosemary reminded him of Christmas. The pound cake did however take 20 minutes less than the approximate baking time so it's a good thing I kept an eye on it. I also used an Okanagan Pinot Gris instead of a Riesling and it worked quite well. The ingredients are rather expensive too so make sure your guests are deserving!

Great pound cake! I made it for my boyfriend without rosemary or pears and he gobbled it up!

I gave this recipe 4 forks because I thought it was a delicious, intriguing, unique dessert. I love how the different flavors mixed around in my mouth and received positive comments from my family and our guest. We all thought the vanilla bean "dots" looked like dirt or pepper and enjoyed the crunchy cornmeal texture in the cake--so there was a lot to talk about while savoring the flavors. I lowered the oven temperature to 300F because I baked the cake in a glass Pyrex bread pan. It was ready in 50 minutes. Also--I halved and cored the pears. Having lived in Tuscany for 3 years, this recipe must have originally come from Italy. I'd like to find a way to lighten it because I can't imagine any Italian using 2 sticks of butter and so much sugar. Regardless, fantastic recipe. Now...if I can figure out what to do with the leftover rosemary syrup!

I made the poached pears for two dinner parties, although I served them with gingerbread. Everyone loved the pears...the vanilla and the rosemary combination was subtle yet distinctive. It will be a staple in my entertaining, and I can sip the syrup later.

I hosted a small intimate dinner party at which we had pretty well satiated everyone and we served the pears without the cake. The silkiness of the poached pears along with the aroma therapy of the rosemary was a most satisfying ending to an elegant evening.

I chose this recipe to end a formal dinner. It was delicious. The European cornmeal isn't as fine as what I buy in the US so I used less cornmeal and added more flour to compensate. The dessert plated perfectly and the aroma was perfect.

I was a bit worried before making it because at the time only the first review existed. I followed the recipe exactly, down to using Forelle pears, except that I cored mine. I thought that the pears came out with a delicious flavor thought my dad didn't like the specks from the vanilla bean because he thought it was dirt; the cake came out buttery (heavy, but that's how pound cake is); and the syrup tied the flavors all together. For the effort, I felt like it was worth it. It took some time, but most of that for me was peeling the pears because I detest peeling fruits/vegetables and it takes me a long time. I think even the pound cake on its own for something more casual would be delicious. Or the pears served with ice cream drizzled with the rosemary syrup warmed up for the person who didn't like the cake.

This recipe was a dazzler at my dinner party. The rosemary syrup and candied rosemary are a great touch. I baked the cake for just one hour, and it turned out perfectly moist. The cornmeal crunch is delicious!

Although I followed the directions to a T, the cake turned out almost rock solid and tasteless, like a baad batch of corn bread!
