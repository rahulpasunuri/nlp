Really fantastic and fairly easy. I bought a legless lamb roast at Costco, and was able to use fresh thyme from my garden (that's how I found the recipe - looking for a use for the thyme). It's amazing how the subtle spicing stands up to strong flavor of lamb. I was able to use my gas grill, following the instructions given. Pulled it at 125 degrees, then it came up to 140 while it was resting. Perfect!

I had to use my oven...I can only imagine the goodness that I would have had if I had used the grill! Next time I will double the marinade.

This recipe is terrific. I prepared it for family and friends to plaudits all around. The only observation/issue I have with the recipe is that the gas grill instructions did not work well with my grill. If you have a large grill, my suggestion would be to leave half the burners on, because one was not sufficient to cook the meat in any reasonable amount of time.

This was a delicious marinade. I will definitely do it again and try it with beef too. I was not able to marinate it for more than 4 hours, but it was still very flavorful. I think I did about double the amount of the marinade though. The "medium rare" was on the rare side of medium rare when I did it.

This preparation has exceptional flavor. The garlic and spice spiked into the meat permeated the meat but was not too dominant, especially since I marinated it for 2 days. The toughest part of this is planning ahead to marinate. Will be doing this for a dinner party next week. We took the wine rec and opened a bottle of Chianti. Very nice.
