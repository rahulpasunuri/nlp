Did not have mint or frisee. Did have an outdoor grill. So... drained the scallions and re-used the oil (with a little extra salt) to coat the top of the fish as I grilled it (skin side down, direct heat at medium). Tried to eye-ball the ingredients for the sauce and ended up a touch too lemony, but really enjoyed those scallions! Definitely making this again!

Very tasty, and it's super easy to make. I didn't have mint and frisee, but it still turned out beautifully. Definitely will make this again.

This is a fabulous recipe. I had the good fortune of making it this summer hours after catching the salmon I used. I called them Northern Michigan Bruschettas

So good! I left the mint out of the mayo... but I'm hesitant to add it as I'm afraid it might mask the grilled scallion which was delicious! I didn't put frisée or mesclun on mine either, instead I fried a slice of bacon/sandwich and put that on top. I used a whole grain Russian rye bun for bread. I served this with cucumber slices and carrots to try to make up for the slice of bacon, which BTW, matches VERY well with salmon and is a guilty pleasure of mine. It is also an extremely fast and easy dish to make. My husband really liked it and he normally does not enjoy Salmon. Another keeper from Epicurious!

Pretty tasty light dinner. I always add some plain yogurt to mayo to make it lighter, unless it's home made. The scallions did not add anything to the dish, next time I won't grill them. Served on rye bread.

I actually CRAVE salmon this way! The sauce can be made ahead of time and I toast thin slices of sunflower rye bread. I'm making it again tonight - you will love it! This recipe is lovely and impressive.

I have made this dish 3 times now, and it always gets rave reviews from my husband. Even my brother who doesn't like salmon enjoyed this dish. I tried using a food processor for the sauce once, but it made it to runny, so I would chop by hand.

My husband is not a big fan of fish dishes, and this dish has become one of his favorites!!! He even asks for it. Quick and easy to make and delicious. Definately awesome.

Quite nice! In my book, simple preparation, visual appeal, and delicious flavor = recipe of a successful entree. We served ours on my husband's homemade bread, which was just a white bread; we sliced a few pieces about a half-inch thick, toasted them really well, and they were a very tasty foundation for this salmon recipe. I might try cutting into quarter-servings as a first course for guests some time.

this was excellent! easy to prepare too. didn't have any scallions on hand, but used regular yellow onion and it still tasted wonderful. served it with baby arugula blend greens on top instead of frisee, which was a nice compliment to the flavors and made it more of a 'meal'. a definate crowd pleaser!

Great fish sandwich- tasty and quick! Second only to the seared tuna burger with ginger garlic mayonnaise on this site.

Another good recipe. No grill available so I had to pan fry everything. It still worked and tasted great.

Surprisingly good! My only mistake was in using bread that was not substantial enugh. Something crusty would have been better.

INCREDIBLE!! I made this with fresh Copper River Salmon, and added just a touch of dijon & lemon zest to the mayo (& used the real stuff, not low fat like I usually do). Didn't have mint so I added a little Italian parsley. Topped with lightly dressed (lemon juice & olive oil)Mesclun mix. Superb! Looks fabulous on the plate, too.

Our family enjoyed this dish very much. Next time, I would just cook the salmon on my Foreman grill to save time. I used lite Wasabi flavored mayonnaise and served the salmon over toasted crusty bread which was flavored by garlic cloves which I obtained at Giant food store.

Delicious, quick and easy - and looks like a million dollars. Used leftover roasted salmon, which worked beautifully. This will become a staple lunch!

Excellent and easy. Next time I might add more scallions and mint to the mayo, but otherwise no changes. It was even great the next day as a cold lunch!

I made this dish as an appetizer on a seeded baguette that had been sliced and toasted. I substituted fennel bulb grilled with the onions and chopped up in the mayo mixture. All was consumed. A hit. Flake the salmon, it sits nicely enough on the bread, just don't take it on the swings.

Gently flake the salmon? Does this mean the whole salmon is in small pieces? If so, what holds it onto the toast. Is sounds as if no mayo mixture is folded into the salmon. Pls explain how it worked for you! Thx

A simple recipe that made a simple cook look like a gourmet chef. With some steamed asparagus it makes a beautiful presentation.

I had all the ingredients except for salmon, scallions, frisee, and only enough time to stop at one store: the fish market. Used sliced Vidalia onion and finely shredded Romaine lettuce, and it was still delicious. The fresh mint is essential, and so is the grilled onion. Three of us ate the whole lb. of salmon.

Frisee is also known as curly or French endive, a sort of spiky-looking, frizzledy salad green. It's part of a classic French salad featuring a poached egg and crunchy lardons.

Semi-off topic, but what is frisee?

Made this last night and it was just great...a different way to present salmon (which we eat a lot of). I used lightly dressed watercress instead of frisee and rustic french instead of the whole grain. It was a huge hit!
