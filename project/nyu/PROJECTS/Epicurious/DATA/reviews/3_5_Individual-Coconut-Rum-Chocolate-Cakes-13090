Double the recipe fit perfectly in a 6 cup bundt pan. Plan on 50 to 55 minutes in the oven. This was a hit at a Caribbean-themed dinner. I served it with premium ice cream and tropical fruit. Chocolatey and moist.

i made this recipe vegan (with no animal derived ingredients) by the following two substitutions: nondairy margarine in place of the butter and Ener-G egg replacer instead of the eggs. the results were delicious. very moist. intense flavor. rich, almost brownie like. incredibly easy and fast to make but elegant results.

Deliciously easy (also, um, delicious) way to end a dinner. This is my go-to recipe when I need a chic enough dessert and can't bear to work to hard or wait to long for it. Serve with premium vanilla ice cream.

Excellent and super-simple. My wife asks me to make it over and over.

These were ok, but I probably won't make them again. I have other recipes for this sort of thing that are better.

Excellent and easy. They're ready for the oven in about half an hour. I've made these twice. Upon a reviewer's suggestion, I tried them in mini muffin pans instead of standard pans. Great! My guests devoured them all.

This recipe was very moist and yummy. I made them bite sized for a pot luck, sprinkled with powdered sugar, for which I received wide ego-stroking acclaim. Very easy as well. Planning to make them again this weekend for a wedding shower.

These were good and fun. I doubled this and used the mini-bundt cake pan, making six small cakes. We drizzled them with rum and then served with dolce de leche. Yummy and pretty.

I made these for valentine's day in heart muffin pans and served them with vanilla ice cream and strawberries. They were a real hit! The cakes are moist and just the right size. My husband said the recipe was a "keeper" and he doesn't say that often.

This is the second time I've made these and they are great. I used mini muffin tins so they were one bite and they were cooked in 10 minutes using a convection oven.

These were fantastic -- I wouldn't change a thing! Mine were done after 19 minutes, so you might want to check them a little earlier. Yum!

I brought these little gems to a party on Saturday, and literally had people fighting over them! And one lady 'hid' one so she could take it home and have it with coffe in the morning! LOL I made a batch the next day and tested several cakes for doneness - one tester will come out clean, and another will be gooey. My baking time was 5-7 minutes longer and I left them in the tins for another 10 mins. Very chocolatey and moist. The hint of rum and the texture of the coconut are magnificent! And I agree with the light sprinkle of powdered sugar to finish them.

Love the recipe! It makes a wonderful presentation, turned upside down, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a scoop of ice cream and colourful fruit. The presentation and flavour will make you proud!

Lovely little cakes!! Great deep chocolate flavor, the rum adds a nice note. I agree with the thought of doubling the recipe, since it doesn't make a very large batch and a little sprikle of confectioners sugar adds a nice touch.

My husband and I spent a week on Grand Cayman in January. While there we enjoyed a variety of rum cakes. Upon return, he asked if I couldn't make something similar. I went to Epicurious and typed in rum cake and a few other choices. I found this recipe. Since then I have made it numerous times. It has beome my husband's new favorite! It is quick and easy and delicious. The only thing I changed is to poke the cakes with a tooth pick several times and then drizzle with about 2 teaspoons more rum. Yum! PS I'd love to visit with any other cooks from Albuquerque.

This cake is not inedible, but you can definitely find a better recipe. The taste was good, but the texture was awful. Very moist, but too dense, like I didn't bake it long enough. When I took it out of the oven, it was done by all accounts -- clean cake tester, firm top, pulled away from sides of pan (I made an 8" round cake). It's really more a brownie than a cake. I think it needs less fat and a leavnening agent.

A wonderful, easy dessert. One problem was that people thought they were muffins. I would suggest sprinking them with a little powdered sugar. Also, it doesn't make much so consider doubling or tripling it.
