had the luxury of buying veggies at a local farmer's market--delicious! crisp, light (use only 1/2 the oil), and very colorful. they got more attention at an easter dinner than the garlic mash.

I needed an easy veggie dish for Easter-Wonderful! Just a bit of the fresh tarragon goes a long way. I didn't use the fennel bulb, though. I used extra virgin olive oil-I'm adding this to my collection!

Delicious! I have made this dish several times and it is always very good. Fast and easy is always a bonus.

My husband and I tried it and did not like it. We found that the olive oil made the vegetables a little too greasy and we did not like the taste of the fennel mixed with the other vegetables.

Wonderful! I made this the night before for a picnic at an outdoor concert, and it was great chilled. A nice accompaniment that was easy to take along in the picnic basket. The fennel especially was a hit; no one had tasted it before.

I cater and use this recipe as a colorful and delicious side dish. I do not use the fennel bulb when preparing for large events. I always get great reviews from my guests.
