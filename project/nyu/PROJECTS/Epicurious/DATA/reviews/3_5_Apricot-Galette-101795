This was too tart for my tastes and I love tart things. I made my own pie crust (store didn't have puff pastry), I doubled the almond meal/powdered sugar mixture and sprinkled the top with sugar and my apricots were eating ready, not mushy but definitely not green. I think I would add more sugar on top of them. It was gorgeous, for certain. I might make it again with modifications, but apricot season seems so fleeting when one doesn't have a tree of one's own!

Super easy. Next time I will increase the almond mixture and put a glaze on top. Then it will 4 forks!

I just had my second slice. Wow... I absolutely love this one. I made my pastry dough from scratch as I prefer home made to store bought. I definitely will top it off with apricot preserves next time just to give it that extra bit for presentation. Again... this is a winner.

I have been making this recipe for years. These days I replace the sugar/almond mixture with a thin layer of frangipane. I dont bother with flouring the bench or buttering the sheet pan (I unfold the pastry sheet on a parchment paper lined sheet pan), but I take time to lay apricot slices in concentric circles because I love the way it looks.

This recipe is SOO easy yet makes an impressive presentation. I used Trader Joes puffed pastry crust (rectangular shape). I just thawed it and turned up the edges to make a rectangular tart, rather than cutting out a 9 inch round. The tart served 4 adults (about a 3" by 4" slice per person). I whipped some cream with vanilla and sugar to top it with. Next time I will used peaches instead, because the apricots, even with added sugar, were still a bit too tart. I think this would also be good with thinly sliced apple or firm pear.

Simple, but good. I used ripe apricots and only a light sprinkle of sugar on the top.

This was a big hit. Everyone I served it to liked it very much and thought it was really special. I liked it because it was EASY. A good dinner party recipe--impressive and easy.

To review this a second time: I don't cut the dough in a circle, I just fold over an inch all around the perimeter and prick it with a fork, or score it every half inch with a knife. There isn't a chance of this serving more than four people. You can substitute Golden Delicious apples if they are VERY thinly sliced.

I have made this for many years using fresh peaches - it's a big favorite of ours. I also brush the top with a light coating of melted peach jelly/jam, then a dollop of whipped cream with a little sprig of mint. Colorful and delicious. To keep the serving from sliding on the plate, place about a teaspoonful of the whipped cream in the middle of the plate first.

Very nice dessert. Easy to prepare and easily doubled. Followed recipe exactly with good result. Sweetness seemed just right to us. A big hit with adults and kids alike. Looks very pretty, even somewhat impressive. I used the rim of a fluted tart pan to cut out the 9" circle of puff pastry...worked like a charm and added to the eye-appeal.

This became a family favorite as soon as it was published. I increase the almond base to 1/3 c confectioners sugar, 1/3 c slkiced almonds. Any soft fruit works with this recipe, and a mosaic of apricots, plums, and raspberries looks and tastes exquisite. This is so easy and everybody who tastes it, raves about it.

Great results for such an easy recipe. Great use for fruit when it is less than ripe.

Easy and delicious. Also makes attractive presentation. I thought it was sweet enough without the whipped cream.

I liked the ease in making this dessert. I think it needs a little more sugar, but using whipped cream made it sweeter. Adjusting the recipe to suit our taste is certainly easy to do

I have made this 5-6 times, and I plan to make it again this weekend. I think it is easy and a great blend of flavors.

Easy to make, and flavor improved the next day after baking. Nice presentation, light. I added a glaze of strained, melted apricot preserves on top - - gave extra flavor and improved appearance.

This was an interesting recipe that produced ok results. I guess I wasn't that big of a fan of this, but if you are, then you might like it more than I did.

Made this for my father, who adores apricots, and he LOVED it. If you like apricots, this is for you. Its also idiot simple. (Be sure not to skimp on the margin of pastry around the apricots, or the juices will leak.)
