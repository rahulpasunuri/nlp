I am making this for the second time in one week with apricots from my tree. It is so good (better than the apricot ice cream we made earlier in the summer). It is tangy and refreshing. Perfect for a tree bursting with apricots.

I made this to go with a chocolate sorbet. It was absolutely delicious. I used fresh apricots from the grocery store and the flavor was so fresh and tangy (the lemon juice adds to that as well). The combo of chocolate and apricot sorbet was delicious--it tasted like a chocolate covered apricot! I will definitely make it again.

This is delicious and so easy! It is a great way to use up extra ripe apricots.

This had wonderful apricot flavor -- I added preserves on the advice of the other reviewer. I strained it but even so found it a little grainy. Probably should use a very fine sieve.

The apricot sorbet is good but I boosted it a bit by adding apricot preserves during the cooking process. This gives the sorbet a very intense flavor. I have done the same with blackberry sorbet and peach sorbet. The addition of the preserves takes the flavor to new levels.
