I love the texture of these muffins! Fluffy and delicious, both right after baking and the following day as well. I used whole wheat white flour, and spiced them up with cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Next time I will add more of the spices, and maybe some ginger as well. I also put five cinnamon chips on the top of each one before baking. They did puff up nicely, too. A great healthy breakfast muffin, nice and light.

My favorite bran muffin ever and I can't believe it's low fat. I just made a few changes: used half buttermilk, half plain lowfat yogurt (because I ran out of buttermilk), used 2 Tbsp oil instead of 1.5, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg, used dark brown sugar instead of raw, and added 3/4 cup raisins. I think the sugar substitution may have made the most difference; most bran muffins call for molasses and dark brown sugar contains more molasses, which I think contributes to the "classic bran muffin" flavor.

These muffins were quick and easy to make... coming out of the oven looking perfect. I like that they are healthy, as I usually opt for the healthy version of foods. However I found the taste to be very mild and underwhelming. There was a lack of flavor, and the muffins sat for days uneaten by members of the household.

Yum! Used oat bran and added a mashed banana. Didn't add the applesauce. My husband and I almost ate the entire batch for breakfast! Will definitely make again.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time, they were by far and away the best bran muffins I've ever made. This is not saying a lot as far as bran muffins go, but they were still quite good. The second time I made them, I beefed up the vanilla and added more cinnamon, and they were excellent. This recipe requires very little tweaking to be wonderful and is good on its own. A perfect breakfast food.

I wanted to like these muffins but they were not popular with my family. While they did come out soft and moist, they had too much of that bran-y, "healthy" taste and no sweetness despite having a 1/2 cup of sugar. Next time, I'll probably try adding cinnamon like others suggested or maybe some fruit.

My kids love these muffins and so do their friends! And I don't mind them eating them because they are healthy: low fat, low sugar, lots of fiber. The only addition I make is to add raisins. They really are moist, chewy and satisfying and easy to make!

I'm revising my original review of this recipe. I first gave it one star after trying a muffin straight out of the oven. I had another the following morning and decided they were much tastier then. They were super moist and even my husband, who's not a bran muffin fan, loved them. I made them with bluberries the first time, and this time added some mashed banana, walnuts and a little nutmeg (topped them with a sprinkle of chopped walnuts). They just came out of the oven and look great! I'm looking forward to having one tomorrow morning with my coffee. On another note, I used 1.5 measurements of everything and that made 13 big muffins.

I chopped up some bananas into it and sprinkled cinnamon on top of the muffins before baking. They were moist and tasty!

Rating: 1
These were certainly moist, but I thought the taste was pretty bland, even with the addition of blueberries. Maybe adding some cinnamon would have helped. I'm willing to give these another try, since they're nicely low fat and healthy. But I'm starting to wonder if it's possible to make a bran muffin that's both healthy and tasty.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I made the recipe exactly and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. Moist, delicious, cakey. I can tell they're going into the rotation. My girls will love them. That said, we generally eat whole grains, not a lot processed cakes, etc. so we may be more acclimated to this amazing texture!

In a rush to make these, and while doubling recipe, I did substitute a few items: lowfat sour cream / milk in 2:1 ratio for buttermilk, used 2 ripe bananas instead of applesauce, grated 1 apple, and added 1 1/2 c raisins, 2 tbsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg. Used 1/2 of whole wheat flour specified, and substituted rest with quick-cooking oats. I was a bit distracted while making, so managed to leave out the baking powder. While they rose only minimally (due to baking powder omission), they turned out to be moist, somewhat chewy, and very flavourful. I topped them with a sprinkle of cinnamon and brown sugar (just a dash per muffin- to give some colour to tops- they were looking a bit insipid part way through baking due to lack of fat, I suppose..) Will be great at breakfast, and certainly pack more nutrients than most with surprisingly great flavour. I would recommend this "slap dash" version , but will include some baking powder next time! Enjoy..

Rating: 4
Excellent and low in fat. As another reviewer, I increased wheat bran and applesauce by .5 c and added raisins and nuts. I let batter sit for about 15 min. to absorb dry ingredients and then baked. They rose nicely with a chewy, but moist texture.

Rating: 4
I made these as a way to use up buttermilk and I was very skeptical of all the 'healthy' ingredients but I was pleasantly surprised. I followed the recipe to a T and found them light and springy. I think there are some good recommendations in other reviews - I imagine that cinnamon or bananas would taste really good. All in all I'm definitely happy that I bought enough wheat bran to make another batch!

Rating: 2
These were suprisingly not dry given the tiny amount of oil in the recipe (I actually doubled it because I feared they would be awful otherwise). That said, I like my muffins a little more substantial. These were very airy, and the wheat bran is a very noticable component of the final result. While a good bet for people on a strict diet, I probably won't make these again.

This is a good base recipe. I made so many additions and alterations that I choose not to rate it even though my results are pleasing. I just ran out of the eggs so I simply did not use any. I also omitted canola oil (don't like the taste it adds to baked goods) and added half a chopped Macintosh apple and 2T chopped crystallized ginger. Also I used low fat yogurt instead of buttermilk. The the concept of the recipe stayed pretty much the same. The muffins needed at least 22 minutes in the oven. They turned out definitely chewy (which I like) and quite moist. Next time I would prefer to substitute ground up rolled oats for half of the bran for more pleasing texture. But it's crystallized ginger that really made mine special

Rating: 3
This isn't a bad recipe. I didn't expect it to rise only because the recipe didn't specify that. It simply said to divide the batter evenly. I think if this batter was going to rise, it probably would have said to fill each cup just a certain amount. I used pretty much all regular unbleached flour and instead of wheat bran added dried cranberries. I think Ill do mostly all flour and just some wheat flour instead the next time. I thought this was moist, but it didn't break or crumble when I opened them up. They were moist and chewy.

This muffin was disappointing. The top was not crusty and the body lacked flavor. Where can I find a bran muffin recipe that replicates the wonderful muffins found in the cafes?

I think this is a great recipe. Relatively low in fat and not an excessive amount of sugar. They came out light and moist. I made the basic recipe and added 1/2 c. banana (didn't have enough applesauce), flax seeds, cinnamon, 1 diced granny smith apple and toasted pecan. Next time I'm going to try pumpkin or sweet potato puree in place of the applesauce. There are endless possiblities.

I've made these twice; today's batch followed another reviewer's suggestions closely, i.e., all whole wheat flour, carrot, raisins and cranberries added to the mix. I also used a ripe banana instead of applesauce because I had it. And though I probably could have left them in a minute longer, they're really good. I'm freezing them and using them for breakfast. One of the best-tasting bran muffins I've tasted.

These are wonderful and I have made three batches in the past week. I typically avoid muffins because they tend to be high in calories and useless in terms of the nutrition department, but these are great. As others have said, the recipe is really more of a base for you to experiment with your own ingredients. They are hearty but moist and light. I added cinnamon and a half pint of blueberries. The half pint was a bit much and the muffins were more blueberry than muffin (not necessarily a bad thing!). I will make these over and over1

I followed "blkestin's" revised version of the recipe. I don't know if I would call it "perfected," although it was quite good. I still prefer the bran muffins at my local café, so I guess it's back to the drawing board. As revised, they were just a tad bit too wheat flour-y for me (maybe add some baking powder, or keep some white flour?), and I LOVE healthy tasting food. Another taster said they were too "nutty." I may try it again, and this time either make it as written or add a little honey to increase the sticky factor. They were pleasantly dense. The carrots and raisins were a beautiful addition.

Rating: 4
I became obsessed with this recipe because I felt it had so much more potential than how it was written. I've made them every weekend for the past several weeks and have now perfected it. Here are my suggested amendments to increase the healthfulness, flavor, and heartiness: - use only whole wheat flour for the entire 1 1/3 cups of flour - mix 1/4 cup of finely chopped walnuts and 1 tsp ground cinammon into the dry ingredients - in a third bowl, mix 1 cup finely grated carrot (approx 1 large carrot), 1 cup raisins, 1 cups dried cranberries, and the zest of 1 medium sized orange. After your wet and dry ingredients are combined, fold these items in - once the batter is in the muffin tin, sprinkle some more of the chopped walnuts on top All of these additions require you to bake the muffins for a couple extra minutes - I find that 22-23 minutes works fine. I hope you enjoy!

Yum Yum! I made this recipe with oat bran (from Trader Joe's), mac nut oil instead of the canola oil (since I didn't have that). I followed what others have suggested and had: reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, added 1/4 cup honey, 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon. I used a giant muffin pan, baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, came out perfectly. I added 1/2 cup cranberries and 1/2 cup nuts. I think the next time I'll also add some shredded carrot or add more nuts/different fruits.

Fantastic-- moist, earthy, healthy(!), and delicious. I followed some earlier comments and made these changes: Instead of 1/2 c sugar, reduced to 1/4 c sugar and added 1/4 c honey.

I previously rated this recipe as pretty low, saying that it tasted like "health food". Since then, I have experimented with the recipe a bit, adding about 1/4 cup of honey to it. Now they're my husband's favorite breakfast, and I make them all the time. They came out sticky, moist & delicious-- all the things a bran muffin should be (and they're healthy!). I also add raisins to the batter at the end.

I understand that these muffins are "healthy", and for "healthy" food, I think they're pretty good. However, I would love a recipe for a great, sticky bran muffin-- the kind you'd get in a coffee house. This definitely isn't it.

Rating: 4
To BonnieLevy--the whole point of this recipe is that it is *not* the normal, dense, rich bran muffin. Rather, it bakes up light and fluffy, and does not overwhelm with its flavor, which makes it the perfect base for additions. The sour cream bran muffin recipe you praise so highly may be rich, but it is certainly not healthy with lots of butter and sour cream. If anyone wants a high fiber (especially if you use all ww pastry flour instead or ww and white), moist, light muffin that is very low in fat, this is the one!

Rating: 2
The sour cream bran muffin recipe on this site much better. The full flavor typical of bran muffins was lacking here. By looking at the ingredients it seems that it would have wonderful, rich flavor...but it does not. I am still convinced molasses is needed for the best bran muffins. If one wants to make a healthy, hearty muffin, there are many other options: no need to try cutting corners with bran muffins. Try the other recipe on the site.

This recipe has become an old standby for my family. Instead of the applesause, I began using up the jars of prune baby food I had in the pantry (one 4oz jar) and I also add anything from blueberries to pecans to craisins... whatever is on hand. They are always delicious and good for you!

Rating: 4
This recipe is a great, flexible base for many bran muffin variations, blueberry, apple, etc. I've found that using whole wheat pastry flour for all of the flour (ww and white) does not detract from the recipe, and I use 1.5 tsp baking powder + .5 tsp baking soda instead of the 2 tsp baking soda. This seems to give them a little more lift with the whole grain flour. For a no-cholesterol (and vegan) version, substitute soymilk soured with lemon juice for the buttermilk, and 1 tbsp flaxseeds, ground (measure before grinding) mixed with 1/4 cup water for the egg.

A definite keeper. I can't believe how good these are, particularly considering how much healthier they are compared to other muffins. My fiance raved, swearing they were the best bran muffins he's ever had (and he is a picky gourmet).

I added chopped dried prunes, but will try in the future with other dried fruits (cherries, apricots), as well as shredded carrots for a lighter faux carrot cake.

I LOVE this recipe--and it's low-fat and so healthy!! I made it for the second time and used dried blueberries for variation and am enjoying them now.

These turned out great, I made a few changes as I didn't have all ingredients on hand. I used milk soured with lime juice which worked fine instead of the buttermilk. I whirled the wet ingredients together in a blender which made for quick mixing and easy pouring. I used "raw sugar" cubes in the blender and they dissolved fine and used homemade applesauce, I also added dried cranberries and golden raisins and the recipe was wonderful, will definitely make these again and maybe cut down on the sugar as the rasins really added a lot of sweeteness.

Its really a three and a half. I stumbled across this recipe while looking for buttermilk recipes. I decided to try it after reading the rave reviews. I have been on a muffin quest with good, s0-so and fair results and this is definitely a very good one. Not oily or dry. I did make one substitution and a few additions. Instead of wheat bran I used oat bran (from Trader Joe's). I added one tsp. cinnamon, a half cup pre-toasted walnuts, a half cup raisins (plumped because mine were a bit dried up), and a half cup unsweetened coconut, based on other reviewers comments. Soooo good. They probably lost their lowfat status with these additions, but they were sure tasty. We actually ate them warm out of the oven and spread butter!! They held up pretty well the next morning after using the microwave. Try them, you will like them. Also, another good muffin recipe on this site is oatmeal muffins where the oatmeal is soaked for an hour in buttermilk. Dee-lish.

EXCELLENT. I have been making recipes from Epicurious for about 6 years, and this is my first review. These muffins are so great that I just had to write about them!

Just made them. Surprisingly moist for such a low fat muffin. Heed the advice not to overbake; mine were ready in less than 20 minutes. I doubled the recipe and made 18 larger muffins. I plan to freeze them. They will be great for packed lunches and snacks on the run. Admittedly, they are a little better with butter and jam :), but this is a nice basic recipe that you could add to.

made these for a guest who needs low fat. i was shocked at how delicious they were. i used regular sugar. also added a little molasses to make it a tad more sweet. now they have become a staple. yum.

These are OK for low-fat. They definitely need some cinnamon and raisins or something. Don't bake longer than 20 minutes despite your instincts.

These were yummy! Just sweet enough for someone used to sweet muffins. I made my own applesauce, and added diced apples.

Delicious! I am not a very good cook, but I got tired of buying bran muffins at the store every week, so I decided to try my own. This recipe was easy and turned out perfectly. Baked for exactly 20 min. I used regular sugar and added plumped raisins and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. You can buy wheat bran at a gourmet or health food store in the bulk food isle. Great recipe!

These muffins are absolutely delicious. I have used cranberry sauce instead of applesauce, added chopped apricots, dried cranberries, or cinnamon. Nothing seems to detract from the texture and flavor of these muffins. They are not at all dry. I will try adding nuts sometime.

These muffins are fantastic! I substituted 1 banana for the applesauces and WOW! I couldn't keep my husband away from them. DO NOT taste like a healthy snack! Great for breakfast on the go.

Finally, the perfect bran muffin. I added some leftover shredded carrots as well as blueberries and walnuts to the batter. Unlike most muffins these are not too sweet and are just as good the next day.

A good simple way to use up leftover buttermilk. I had some bananas that needed to be used up as well, and I substituted them for the applesauce. I also added a large handful of raspberries. Great for breakfast.

I've always disliked muffins and baking BUT this recipe not only tasted brilliant but those muffins were huge! I added 1 cup walnuts and drunken (rum soaked) raisins for extra taste and I will be making these muffins on a weekly basis even though I still hate baking. Thanks to those who offered their fruit tips.

These were excellent! I added a cup of walnuts to the batter which made them better. They don't have the "healthy" taste the sometimes scares people away from bran muffins. Very good warm out of the oven with a dollop of strawberry jam. Yum!

I made these muffins exactly to recipe (I did not add fruit as some of the other folks have) and I thought it was just perfect. The buttermilk adds moistness and flavor to this very healthy snack.

I followed the prior suggestion to add dried cranberries and apricots. The muffins are delicious. My younger children think that they are cupcakes and devoured them. You do have to like bran to enjoy them. The recipe just might not be right for some people. These have been put into my permanent recipe file. Our family loves them.

Wonderful! Just add 1 cup of frozen blueberries and you could not wish for better bran muffins.

Reacted to another user's comment that the muffins were dull so I added 3/4 cup of dried cranberries, 3/4 cup of chopped dried apricots, and 1/2 cup of slivered almonds. With these additions the muffins were very good.

Entire family immediately (and suspiciously) noted the "healthy" taste of these muffins. I found them dull and unremarkable; wouldn't bother again.

These light muffins are delicious! I have had to make them twice in two days since our household of two adults and one toddler devoured them all. A real departure from those leaden, oily bran muffins of yesterday. A real keeper.
