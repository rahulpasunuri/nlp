I was very excited about this recipe but it feel considerably below my expectations. It is just too bland. I made several different variations of the sauce and ultimately settled on something almost completely different (sour cream, blue cheese, chives, and the broth). But that is basically the kind of sauce you might eat with uncooked celery and I think I would have probably been more satisfied with that.

Terrific! So easy, and quite elegant, but it does NEED the anchovies...if you don't like anchovies, capers might do the trick. Good Dijon mustard is also essential. Guest worthy with a good fish dish.

This was OK but it needs something else - maybe paprika or onion powder or crumbled blue cheese. I don't know what - just something because right now it is pretty bland. I noted the use of anchovies - that would have done the trick, I think, but not to the tastes of the "everything but anchovies" crowd!

Great alternative to salad

It tastes great! I think this is a great way to use up celery you may already have on hand. I would also serve this to break the salad monotony. Be sure not to forget to de-string the celery, and I chilled the celery without the broth.

Absolutely wonderful change of pace for dinner salad. The celedon-colored lengths of celery look gorgeous on the plate, and this would make a lovely first course at a dinner party. The dressing is simple but wonderful. I simmered the celery in low sodium chicken broth, and with the dijon dressing, the saltiness was just right. I recommend chilling the celery and broth in an ice bath. It's incredibly quick this way, much less than the 2 to 3 hours of recommended fridge time.

Celery hearts are the inner, more tender stalks of celery. They are often available sold in separate bags. Otherwise, you can buy the entire bunch of celery and remove the outer stalks.

Would someone be so kind as to explain to me exactly what a celery heart/ celery ribs are. That help would be much appreciated. :)

Way to go, California! :-) And if your girlfriend was the one to make it, why do YOU get the reviews? Make it yourself and get spellcheck.

You do realize that 3 forks means delicious....... If you don't read directions it is no wonder that your cooking "sucks".

My girlfriend tried this and I got a rousing, "Oh, it's.... different" which we all know is a euphamism for "It Sucks". Another said it would be okay if it wasn't mustard coupled with the celery. Stay away from this recipe!
