Amazing. I used homemade chicken stock and added the bones to that for about 1 hour. After straining it, I then added it to my vegetables. This made for a much clearer broth. Spinkled w/freshly grated parmesan (oh added celery root too) & it's out of this world...

This soup was divine. The only changes I made were to use whole barley (needs to cook awhile longer) and to substitute jerusalem artichokes for 1/2 the parsnips. Still deliciously earthy! The only thing I can't quite figure out is using this as a "first course" - it was full-meal- satisfying to my taste - and that of my entire family!

This was really good. I substituted wild rice for the barley because I don't like barley. Better the second day, like most soups.

DISCARD THE SKIN?! ARE YOU INSANE?! Drain it on paper towels. Serve with the soup or just treat yourself. Fried duck skin is lovely; only a fool would throw that away! If you have duck confit, why would you even consider using anything other than duck stock? Chances are you've made that too. Low-sodium chicken stock is lazy, and it's not nearly as good.

Very easy and abolutely subtly delicious meal. We used all the duck stock we made and ended up adding only about 1/2 cup of water to the final soup. Fabulous with a Pinot Noir and home baked bread.

Made this as a starter for a about 10 people (i did 1 1/2 times everything)... it was fantastic! We already have snow here so it was a great winter warm up! We had a little left over and it tasted even better the next day!
