I found this salad very bland and rather boring. I wanted something light to serve with dinner and it was that, but I think that the dressing needed more flavor, maybe orange juice. I even served it on a bed of arugula for more color as the photo looked too white. There are so many good dressings out there that I won't bother trying to perk this one up.

Very nice mix of ingredients! Fennel oil is wonderfully fragrant on its own, but is a bit lost once the full salad is asssembled. The result is crisp, fresh and delicious.
