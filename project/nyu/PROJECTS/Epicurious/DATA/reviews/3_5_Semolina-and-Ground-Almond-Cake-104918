This recipe works well with other ground nuts besides almonds. Also I've found, interstingly enough, that this reipe can easily be modified into cookies by ommiting the eggwhites and syrup. The balance of citrus and vanilla blend wonderfully into the nutty cookie!

This was a wonderful cake. I would like to know if this is really the recipe that would be used by a Greek grandmother, because I made it for a Greek-themed dinner party, but even if it's not, it had a very complimentary set of flavors to the rest of the meal and all the guests loved it. It has an excellent texture and sweetness. I would like to try it with rose-water, but also might try it with an ouzo syrup instead of brandy. The only downside is that it's not especially attractive being served out of the pan in squares... I like cake baked in rounds and sliced in wedges so might try that next time. I used a 9x13 pan (instead of 12x18) and it was still done in 36 minutes.

This smelled absolutely heavenly. I made it just as written. Judging from the sweets at our local Greek bakery, the syrup should still be quite thin so it can soak through. I don't like rose water, so it was very nice to be able to make these without, even if it is not traditional.

I love this version of the traditional Middle Eastern version of semolina cake (sometimes called Basboussa). I added rosewater and orange blossem water to the sugar syrup in lieu of lemon/cinnamon. When I make it again, I may make 1.5 recipes to yield a slightly higher cake. As is, in this sized pan, it was under an inch in height. Otherwise excellent.

I made this wonderful cake. It was easy, but best of all it was delicious. I am making it again tomorrow.

You'll need to start the sugar syrup as soon as you put the cake in the oven since it took about 20 minutes (not 10) at a fairly high temperature (not a simmer) for my syrup to become "viscous."

I loved this dish! Being from Greece myself, I knew what I was looking for, and it was fantastic! It was almost as good as my mother's but much more simple. I highly recomend this dessert to all who are looking for an authentic greek dessert!
