Easy and delicious but I'd add more vegetables next time - I added sliced red pepper but I think other things like broccoli or the like would be delicious too.

Got a large bunch of green onions in my produce box. I found this recipe and thought, why not? Yummy! Different. I substituted an Asian hot sauce I had in the house for the spice called for here.

I diced up the onion, but otherwise made as written and these were fantastic! We especially loved the dipping sauce - easy to make and very tasty. If you're looking for an easy green onion cake, this is it! I would probably add more shrimp next time, and possibly would try seasoning the batter a tiny bit more, but they are good as written. I'm not sure I would have them on their own as a meal again, but they'd be a great side to any Asian type meal.

I thought these would be too oniony but they weren't. The pancakes alone were a bit bland (easily fixed on next preparation) but the sauce fixed all that. Didn't have carrots but otherwise made as written except slightly cut back on the flour. Found it much easier to make several 6" pancakes (much easier to flip). The texture was great. Excellent meal with a salad.

Used more green onions (leek sized) & shrimp and it turned out very well.

Made this recipe for a dinner party and people were asking me to make more because it was so delicious. Its very easy to make and keep in mind to not put too much sauce when putting it in the pan or else the middle becomes too moist and does not cook all the way. As for the sauce, I used already made Gochu sauce from the Korean market, but dumpling sauce is just as good.

Made per recipe, and they turned out great. Very easy to make, and uses simple ingredients. Would reccomend.

A great, easy weeknight dinner when paired with a simple green salad. Even the four year olds liked them. We did cut down on the pepper in the dipping sauce for the younger taste buds.

This was a disaster. It was wayyy too bland and the end result was a too-thick batter which made too-thick pancakes regardless. Thinning out the batter made an even worse flavored pancake.

I've never tried the real thing but these were pretty tasty. The tender texture inside makes them much different then Chinese and Vietnamese style pancakes I've had.

Made them twice...with and without the shrimp. The family thinks they're great. I halved the amount of Cayenne in the sauce and still thought it was plenty hot. Makes a great appetizer.

We tried these last night at dinner and were very pleased with the results. I did add a small handful each of chopped basil, mint, cilantro and parsley (thanks to the kitchen garden) into the batter which was a nice touch. For the sauce, we stirred in a spoonful of Vietnamese chili/garlic paste instead of the cayenne for extra kick. Also, we found that the pancakes on the bottom of the pile that had time to "set" had the best flavor!
