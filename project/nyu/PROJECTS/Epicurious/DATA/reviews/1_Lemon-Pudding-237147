I believe the "2 cup serving" refers to, 2 of the 3oz paper cups the recipe is divided among. The sugar-free lemonade concentrate would be the frozen kind. I hope that helps.

This recipe is written badly... is it frozen concentrate or is it like powder crystal lite, kool aid etc., also how does a recipe with one cup ingrident end up with a 2 cup serving?

I'm not sure what "lemonade concentrate" is. Is that frozen lemonade, something dried, or lemon juice? I'd like to make this recipe and would appreciate anyone's help. Thanks.

Geesh, I just saw it, the analysis is for a 2 cup serving, not the 3 oz in the recipe.

The nutritional info has to be wrong, a different, non-diet recipe has 65 calories and 9 grams of carbs.
