The whole family loves it. We use half mascarpone and half low-fat ricotta to lighten the dish. We also make a double recipe and freeze one. We've frozen it for 3 months with great results.

Blah, blah, bland. Had all of the ingredients on hand so it wasn't a big deal, but this was a pretty boring usage of my favorite ingredient (mascarpone). Next time I have some left, I'll make my old standby, the cauliflower mascarpone tart - so yum. This was just ho hum.

I can take the mystery out of this dish...either serve it as written and unbabked without the added pasta water, or make it a hearty casserole dish by adding the pasta water, meat and/or extra spices. If you choose to make it a one-dish casserole I would definitely cover it, cook it for at least 30 minutes, and uncover for the last 5- 10 minutes like you would any other baked pasta casserole. My husband and I liked but did not love it baked casserole style, but I'm not sure I would make it again either way.

This was a huge hit with my New Year's company. I followed the other reviewers advice and added minced garlic to the tomatoes before roasting, and roasted for about 25 minutes (I sprayed the pan with olive oil first). Used both chives and basil and it was great. Will definitely make again!

Rating: 3
I made this because I had some extra marscapone I needed to use. It is kind of like a cheater's macaroni and cheese, but I thought it was quite good. I roasted a bit of garlic and bacon along with the tomatoes, which helped add some depth to the flavor. I would make this again, the next time I have some marscapone laying around.

Rating: 2
My roommates love this, but I just wasn't thrilled. Not only did the flavor lack zip (definitely recommend some garlic and spices), but it was a lot heavier than i expected. I was trying to use up extra mascarpone, but maybe I added too much? I would also have done a little extra tomato or maybe some other complementary veggies to balance the pasta and cheese. That being said, I had one serving at dinner and my 2 roommates ate ALL the rest. So that's 5 full servings between 2 people! they loved it! i'm already getting bugged to make it again, but i'm not in a rush. I don't know, maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this when I made it.

I had some marscapone to use up and I had made too many desserts in the last few days, and and so I typed in "marscapone tomato" and this came up. It was easy-reading and easy-making. Delicious and brilliant!! Wish I had read the reviews and added garlic. I didn't have castellane, so I used normal pasta. Same flavour of course. A great put together for a simple lunch.

Rating: 3
I love this as it is, but I have to agree adding garlic makes it better. I also have to wonder how the cook from Tampa spent $26 on some pasta, grape tomatoes, chives and cheese. I'd probably be annoyed if it cost me that much to make, too. But it was more like 15, tops. And I used organic everything. I make it a couple times a year. Make it, I say; it's easy and yummy.

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious. Mascarpone makes for an incredibly creamy sauce. To increase taste complexity (and, OK, calories) can add diced pancetta or proscuitto (sauteed until crispy).

I added hot Italian sausage. Also added a bunch of garlic to roast with the tomatoes and a bit of thyme. Added a bunch of cracked pepper to the mascarpone before mixing into the pasta. Turned out great; husband went back for seconds.

This recipe is great! I made it with Fusilli pasta, I added sausage and scallions and stead of using the pasta water I added a cup of chicken broth to the sausage and worked perfect!! I also roasted garlic and added rosemary to the tomatoes. Serve with spinach with olive oil,balsamic vinegar and chives vinaigrette, awesome!!

good recipe, made it tonight using larger tomatoes and adding a slice of garlic to each tomato half before roasting. Pulsed the roasted tomatoes in a blender together with pine nuts and arugula before adding to the pasta-mascarpone mix. Will make it again!

Made this last night... read reviews and did a few variations based on what i had available. Used philly cream cheese instead of marscapone (had it with the marscapone @ a friends house before)... tasted just fine. also, added a brushed a whisked mix of balsamic vinegar, olive oil, minced garlic, salt, & black ground pepper over the tomatoes before roasting. YUM. Used penne instead of castellane. Came out great! Might try some shredded mozz over top of dish while baking next time to take away from some of the graininess from the sprinkled parm.

This recipe is delicious! The juicy grape tomatoes combined with the pasta & cheese are delightful. I substituted the castellane pasta for whole wheat risoto. I used low-fat cooking spray rather than butter. I also spiced it up a bit.

I could not find Mascarpone in either of the two grocery stores nearby, so I substitued Ricotta. The kids loved it and one asked that left overs be packed for her school lunch the next day. Not an overly sophisticated dish, but easy and fast to prepare. Which is just perfect for many weeknights!

So good! I halved the marscapone and it was still delicious. I added garlic to the tomatoes per the previous reviews. Don't substitute out the chives - - they are just right with the marscapone. Again, so good!

Rating: 3
Easy and very tasty. Don't go cheap on the cheese. That where all the flavor comes from.

Rating: 1
Mascarpone's fat content is much too high for this dish- it ends up being an oily mess. The roasted tomatoes are nice but not enough to cut the oil. A simple baked ziti is far better and basically the same concept. Ricotta is a much better cheese for the job. Will not make this again.

Rating: 3
My family loved this dish. I've made it several times, once when I was short on time, so didn't roast the tomatoes. It was still good, but definitely worth the time to roast them. I have also added chicken which was a nice addition. With or without chicken, we all loved it.

Rating: 3
I'm giving this three forks because there isn't a two and a half. It is better the next day, but there was way too much water in mine and it literally tasted watered down. I followed the recipe exactly, and when I added the pasta water, I knew it was a mistake. I'll try making this again minus the water, but it isn't worth the 26 dollars in quality ingredients.

Rating: 4
Made this last night and thought it was wonderful. I took the advice of other reviewers and added two large cloves of chopped garlic to the tomatoes before roasting. I also sprinkled the tomatoes with some fresh chopped rosemary and roasted them for slightly longer (approx. 25 min) so that the garlic had time to soften and caramelize. In order to make it a more hearty main dish, I added some store bought rotisserie chicken and a large handful of chopped fresh basil. I did bake it but covered it with lightly greased foil in order to prevent the drying out problem mentioned by some reviewers. The pasta on the top was a bit dry but a quick stir before serving and nobody was the wiser. Oh, and the wonderful aroma of the roasting garlic and tomatoes will make your family and guests think that you slaved all day to make this easy dish! Will definitely be making this again.

I loved this recipe! It's easy, looks great on a plate, and tastes like it maybe took hours to make. I used green onions instead of chives, and I thought that the slightly stronger flavor mixed well with the mascarpone.

Unbelievable!!! I think this is my third four-fork review ever. Great recipe. I tossed in some grilled chicken and sauteed mushrooms. Don't be scared of pasta water! It changes the nature of a sauce, gives a richness and texture that's wonderful. We ate it pre-bake, but I'm sure it's every bit as delicious if you can manage to wait while it's in the oven.

Followed directions with the addition of red pepper flakes which really made this dish extra tasty.

I substituted whole milk ricotta and basil, nixed the pasta water, and used that Barilla whole grain pasta (rotini) and this came out just great -- not too heavy. I will probably roast some garlic with the tomatoes next time.

delicious and simple. didn't use all the pasta water and used basil instead of chives. would def. make again.

Great dish. I made it exactly as written, except I omitted the pasta water because the dish seemed plenty wet enough after the mascarpone melted down (I may have added too much). It came out of the oven perfect--not too wet, not too dry. The balance of the sweet roasted tomatoes and the creamy cheese is really heavenly.

Yum! It was all I could do to keep from eating this before it went in the oven to bake. I added some red pepper flakes for a little kick. Very tasty!

Wow, was this good!!! This is such a versitile recipe -- the basics are so delicious that when you build on the recipe to suit your own tastes the result is absolutely incredible. We cooked the pasta in chicken broth for extra flavor, roasted the tomatoes with garlic and red bell pepper, used fresh basil instead of chives and added red pepper flakes. It was so fast, easy, pretty and delicious. We will certainly make this again.

This is a recipe my family loves. I use tomatoes from our garden, sliced in wedges, and slow roasted with olive oil, etc., for two hours. The sauce never gets pink or runny. I've also substituted basil for the chives. Mmmm.

I have made this several time, and we absolutely love it. I think that good tomatoes are the key, and that's one of the reasons I prefer this as a warm weather dish. It really is delicious, and can even be reheated, although it's far better when freshly made.

Rating: 3
I had a bumper crop of grape tomatoes, so used this recipe which we all enjoyed. It was quick and easy. I tossed the tomatoes with the S&P, two cloves crushed garlic, and some extra-virgin olive oil before roasting, as suggested. The mascarpone gave such a nice creamy taste and texture, but I'm not sure it's worth the expense. Unless I'm making for special guests, I'd probably substitute ricotta for a weeknight meal in the future. Or maybe I just need to find a place to get mascarpone for less than $9/lb!

I agree, this recipe needs a little help...just use the recipe for Vesuvius Tomatoes in the recipe file here and make sure your salt and pepper are up to snuff......DEEEELISH.

I took a few liberties with this recipe (since I was not limited to 5 ingredients), and found the results to be EXCELLENT -- creamy but not heavy, richly flavored. The recipe is probably good as is, but was also a great starting point to something really delicious. Changes I made: sprinkled 3 cloves minced garlic over tomatoes before roasting, used about 3/4 cup minced fresh basil instead of chives (I love chives, but I find good, flavorful chives are sometimes hard to get these days), added 1/2 cup coppa secca (cut into small, thin strips) and used only one 8-oz container of mascarpone. The baking step adds a nice crispness to the to surface. It may look dry to those unaccustomed to this step, but it really is a nice touch. Be sure not to overcook the pasta when boiling -- a little less than al dente is fine, since it gets baked afterward. Enjoy!

Rating: 2
I expected to love this recipe, based on the ingredients and positive reviews. Instead, I liked it but didn't love it. I followed all instructions, with the exception of adding some red pepper flakes to my roasted tomatoes (a good addition). I thought it came out tasting too acidic however, which was only marginally offset by the mascarpone . I also felt it was a bit bland, even with the red pepper flakes. Rather than make this again, I will save my mascarpone and beloved grape tomatoes for other things.

Rating: 4
So easy and quite delicious IF you make a few additions. Reading the prior comments, I braised the tomatoes with olive oil, basil, garlic, salt and pepper and still found the dish to be a bit bland. However, I added shredded prosciutto and that did the trick. The dish was even better two days later reheated out of the fridge.

Rating: 4
I would definitely make this dish again. I followed the recipe exactly, but I would add some red pepper flakes next time as others have recommended to give it a little more kick. I did not have a problem with the top drying out too much as others have. There is so much moisture inside that once it is served, it mixes together to just the right texture. Delicious!

Rating: 4
i am not a fan of tomatoes in general, but this sounded good, so i tried it... and i loved it! it was delicious! i followed other reviewers suggestions about tossing the halved tomatoes with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt & pepper (i meant to add some red pepper flakes but forgot). i'm not one with any cooking skills, but this was easy! i'll definitely make again! i noticed that people had concerns about the baking temp, so i baked it for half the time at 350 and then turned it up to 400 for the last half and it came out golden & just right!

A nice dish. Enjoyed the taste, especially with the roasted grape tomatoes. My guests enjoyed this as well. A nice do ahead dish. I would recommend covering it or mixing it again before cooking it. I let my sit for 2 hours as the recipe states before cooking and the top was dry.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe. i made a lot of additions/changes, though, which is the only reason it doesn't get a 4-fork rating from me. we used fresh-picked cherry tomaotes roasted with basil, garlic, chili flakes, salt/pepper--this really makes the dish, i think. i also added sauteed shrimp, as someone had mentioned earlier. i used penne instead of castellane. i did bake it, but sneaked a taste before baking, and it was great unbaked, as well! had this with a side of crusty bread--perfect!

Absolutely wonderful. Even better with a little cayenne pepper to spice it up. I also roasted the tomatoes (canned tomatoes) with rosemary on top. An amazing dish and so easy!

This is only the second recipe on this site I've awarded a 4 fork rating - I've decided it's that good! I used a shape of pasta I'm fond of called chiocchole. Heeding some suggestions from other reviewers, I roasted my tomatoes with a little chopped fresh rosemary, along with the salt (coarse) and pepper. To the final sauce I added a small pinch of red pepper flakes. One unfavorable review stated the top became hard and crispy. I certainly wanted to avoid that problem so I baked it at a lower heat (350 degrees) and for slightly less time than recommended. Next time I'll serve the pasta without the baking step. This is really worth cutting up all those little tomatoes!

Thought this was great, and very easy (not time consuming at all, though I halved the recipe so I wasn't cutting all those little tomatoes!). I think a key point is adding the pasta water to keep it moist. Very yummy--definitely a keeper.

I've made this as both a side dish and main course and it was a HUGE success each time! The marscapone gives the pasta a deliciously mild cheesy flavor, but too overpowering, as an alfredo can be. It's extremely easy to make, just a tad time consuming, but worth it! My husband and I have also played with other ingredients as well. We like to saute some shrimp in garlic and white wine, then add it to the pasta right before you bake it. Delicious! The leftovers are even better tasting!

Rating: 3
I've made this twice in the last three days, once for my family and once for a pot luck dinner. I, too, roasted the tomatoes with olive oil, thyme & sea salt. I couldn't find catellane pasta so I used a thin cavatelli and it was wonderfull. I made it the following day with shells. Yummy and very versatile. My kids weren't nuts about the tomatoe skins, but my husband and I loved it!

Rating: 3
Nice flavor. Easy to make. I added pinenuts, and black olives. Next time, I'll try baking it, as I just served it from the pan this time. Better flavor on day 2. Adding chicken would also be good. Overall, a nice vegetarian recipe.

I really liked this recipe. The mascarpone makes it a cream pasta, and it is delicious and fairly easy, though time consuming, to make. I loved the roasted tomatoes, even though they were falling apart. Halfway through eating it, we added a little bit of red pepper flakes to spice it up. I agree with the reviewers who think garlic would overpower the mascarpone. You want to taste the unique flavor of the cheese.

Really quite easy, and very tasty. I made exactly as written (first time, always), and agree with those who don't want to overpower the flavor with garlic (and I usually like garlic in everything!).

Have made this recipe quite a few times now and love it but have only made it as printed once! In addition to having added garlic and basil I sometimes saute a few large shrimp and add them or sliced chicken breast sauteed in olive oil and garlic and also sometimes add mushrooms. It's so versatile! The basic recipe is so simple and good but the add-ons make it even better as a main course since my husband needs protein with his pasta!

Wow, you have to love a dish that is this simple to make. I had an extra 8 oz. of mascarpone left over from making tiramisu that I needed to use, and this recipe fit the bill perfectly. I used a little less than a full pound of pasta, and only a cup of pasta water, and it worked out fine. I couldn't get chives at the store, so I substituted basil. Next time, I will add some garlic and maybe some balsamic vinegar, but this dish was great as I was able to prepare it. My husband devoured it.

The husband and I loved this pasta dish. I have never cooked with marscapone and would not have tried it if not for the comments found here. We took the suggestions of the other reviewers and added sauteed garlic and fresh cipollini onions. I topped the dish with a small spicy grilled chicken breast. We did not bake the dish, rather served it right from the pan. We used bow-tie pasta. Thanks to all the other reviewers for great ideas. I agree the dish might be a bit blah without the enhancements. I gave this dish 3 stars because it is a good recipe that is open to variation. Keep this one handy as you will make it again and again. Just use your imagination!

Every Sunday, I make a nice dish I can have for my dinners during the week....tried this one this past Sunday. YUMMY!!! My only substitution was penne pasta rather than using castellane. If I make it again, I might experiement with adding a different taste (perhaps adding shrimp, garlic, etc.), but as-is it had a delightful though very subtle flavor.... I especially liked this because I prefer to buy only organic food, and my nearby Whole Foods had all the ingredients for this dish!

Wow - this was yummy and easy to boot! I also added some garlic and basil per the other reviewer's suggestions, but the mascarpone gives it such a rich and delicious flavor.

This will probably replace Macraroni and Cheese at my house and possibly Alfredo as well. When I made it I grilled 2 large chicken breasts with cajun seasonings and then cut them up and put them on top of the cassarole. Excellent.
