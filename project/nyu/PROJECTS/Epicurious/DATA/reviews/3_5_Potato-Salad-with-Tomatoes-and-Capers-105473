Fantastic alternative salad, especially for those on Weight Watchers (2 points a serving)Found the key is using good quality ingredients. Could even use more sardines!

Pretty good. Don't know if I'd always use it to replace traditional mayo versions. I didn't use Sardines, and I didn't really like the oil cured olives I got. They were too briny! Although, I've had less potent ones. I would probably try next time, using plain ol' canned black olives!

I made this recipe without the sardines or anchovies, and it was so delicious! Very unique potato salad.

This was fantastic, and even better a day later after chilling in the fridge. I used caper berries (the big capers, cut in half lengthwise) and substituted anchovy paste in the olive oil instead of adding sardines on top, and thought the results were lovely.

I was looking for a salad with sardines, and this was a great choice! I added a bit of Worcestershire sauce as dressing, because I love it with sardines.

I used what I had - like all my cooking. Which means, this recipe was the starting point. I had red and yellow variety of various tomatoes, large capers, red potatoes, red onion, etc. To the sauce, I made up a Dijon champagne vinaigrette with cream. I loved the smoked trout suggestion, but added flaked smoked salmon. This was a HUGE hit. I served it with steamed King Crab Legs.

i think the sardines most be taken condtion carefully, some people dont want the taste of the fishy smell and taste of the sardines. i think the best way is to put a little grated ginger to eliminate the taste and smell of the sardines

I like all the ingredients in this dish...just not together. I wasted lots of perfectly fine foods to make this mess. I suggest tasting before adding the sardines. If you think you're on your way to a great potato salad, stop while you're ahead. Also, go light on the oregano.

It was delicious...didn't have all the correct ingredients so I used pimento stuffed green olives (sliced) and substituted anchovies (chopped) to replace the sardines....We loved it. Looking forward to making it again, the specified way.

I've made this several times to RAVE reviews. I use a coarse sea salt to add a briny flavor while omitting the anchovies. Be sure to find the yellow fleshy potatoes as regular white rose don't have enough flavor.

I've made this a zillion times always to rave rave reviews.... It has become my signature potato salad, since I hate mayo based potato salad. I leave out the sardines....

Very good. If you are looking for traditional American Potato salad--this isn't your dish. If you want a very good salad of potatoes, tomatoes, capers and the rest you are in for a treat. Tasty complimentary tastes. I added lemon juice for a twist. You could add a little mayo to make the dressing creamy. I used Tarragon instead of oregano.

Left out the sardines and served it as a lighter alternative to regular potato salad to accompany smoked pork tenderloin for our Fourth of July barbeque. It earned rave reviews!

The taste of the sardines combined with the potato and tomatoe were so subtle and delicious that it was a real surprise. Sardines should be included in the title!

An interesting blend of flavors, but not a winner. I guess it's a local delicacy, but not at my house.
