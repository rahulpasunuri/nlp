I make this recipe as is, but used canned black beans, and it tastes great. Serve with grilled chicken and fired sweet plantains.

Is there a way I could do this in a crockpot?

I like this as a solid beginning for black beans (which my husband and I make pretty frequently). We also like adding 1-2 bay leaves about 7-10 min before you're done simmering. My mother, who really generally dislikes bean dishes, loves it!

Great recipe for black beans. Used a yellow and red peppers instead of green (which I don't care for) and topped with some cheese. Also, added a dash of cayenne and went heavy on the cumin and garlic to address the blandness issue.

I use this recipe as a staple anytime I am making Mexican food. However, I use four tablespoons of cumin instead of one. Our family and guests LOVE this dish.

I have been looking for a recipe for black beans for a long time and I have found it! I halved it and had enough for 4 adults and leftovers.

This recipe is fantastic IF you fold in (don't mash the beans) 1/2 to 3/4 C. sour cream at the finish and a liberal amount of fresh cilantro. I agree that the recipe needs some pep and believe me, this is it!

Good but a little bland. I threw in some hot salsa & that perked it up.
