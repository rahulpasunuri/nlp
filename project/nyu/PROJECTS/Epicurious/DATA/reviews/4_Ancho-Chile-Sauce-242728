You can substitute 1 T Ancho Chili Powder for the dried chili and then add enough water to make it the consistency you want - start with at least 1/2 cup and go from there. Rich, flavorful, and delicious!

A winner. Had to add approx 3 TBS more of the reserved chili liquid.

Great recipe for a NY Strip. I did modify it slightly. I soaked 1 Dried Thai chili and tossed it in the blender to give it a little kick. The spice helped soften the flavor of the ketchup in the sauce.

I love this BBQ sauce, spicy with out being too much! I have made it with organic ketchup as well as substituting diced tomatoes and liquid. The first time I made it was to make BBQ Lima beans like I used to get in Chestnut Hill, PA! The best. Enjoy.

Loved this. Doubled the receipe so I could freeze some. Had difficulty finding ancho chilies so had to buy Pablono's (this is what dried ancho chilies are) and dehydrate them. Great for chicken or pork
