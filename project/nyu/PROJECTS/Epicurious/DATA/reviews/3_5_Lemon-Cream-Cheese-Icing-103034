I made this to frost a lemon cake that I made with a gluten free mix that I like. This was really good and very easy. I used a local organic cream cheese with an excellent flavor and Eureka (not Meyer) lemons, and it was outstanding. I did not use as much cream, since the cream cheese doesn't have the gumminess of Philly cream cheese and is softer.

This frosting is delicous and easy to make. I used it to frost a chocolate zuchini cake and it turned out great! I think the key is to use good vanilla....I used vanilla from a trip to Mexico. The taste was outstanding.

I didn't want a glaze type icing so I used a mixer - added the whipping cream in last. It was perfect!

Yummy! Perfectly tart, not to sweet or overwhelming. I used one lemon for the zest and juice and didn't measure, but it looked like the same amount the recipe called for. I will definitely be making this again.

Lemon is a fave, Great icing

This a delicious cake and absolutely worth making every week, only to discover that after an hour or so after serving it is gone! I did add a few more carrots and was also generous with the nuts and the lemon ingredients for the icing. Really lovely, thank you!

Thicker than a glaze, thinner than a frosting, this icing was the PERFECT consistancy for my lemon pound cake (baked in a bundt pan)...and the flavor - incredible! Just enough tart balancing the sweetness, and the cream cheese made the icing taste almost like a cheese cake in itself! This helped my cake be the clear favorite at our Father's Day neighborhood picnic. Thank you!

Delicious! I didn't add the lemon zest or juice as I was using it to ice lemon cupcakes and didn't want overkill. The consistency was great and the kids loved them!

This is a great icing, especially goes well with the caroot bundt cake. I usually end up adding double the whipping cream, as I probably beat it too hard. But definitely tastes fine. As for the cook on 06/03, "pourable icing" usually means a glaze in my book.... Alway read the recipe...

I usually don't like icings but this was fabulous. I doubled up on the lemon as many had suggested used it with the carrot cake and it was delicious! I will look for other things to use it with.

I made this but I let the cream cheese soften and grated the lemon peel. I also make a strawberry with seedless strawberry jam in place of the lemon with soften cream cheese.

WONDERFUL AND EASY

I just walked straight from my kitchen to the computer so that I can let everyone know that this is NOT an "icing" recipe, it's a GLAZE recipe! Hello? ICING should be thick enough to spread, not POUR for crying out loud! I had to add practically a BOX of confectioner's sugar to make this thick enough for what I needed it for! I'm giving it a single fork for a very bad descriptive title. Shame, shame Epicurious.

Just the right sweetness but maybe a little more lemon juice wouldn't hurt next time I make it. I paired this with a carrot cake recipe I found on this site. Delicious!

Very nice lemon fragrance. Probably wouldn't hurt to add a dash more lemon juice. I would use a blender next time instead of a processor though. The blades didn't mix everything evenly.

Easy to make and use. However, you may want to nuke the cheese to soften about twenty seconds, and substitute about a teaspoon full of 10 percent half and half for the whipping cream.

This was very good - I used this to ice the spiced pumpkin cake also on this site. Yummy. Added extra zest.

Lovely and easy. I went a little short on the cream (under 1/4 of a cup) to get a nice thickness.

Fabulous! Would, could, and will use on many desserts!

This is a wonderful accompaniment to gingerbread! It is light, cool, lemony and just a heavenly touch to add to a wedge of freshly baked gingerbread!

this accompanied the carrot walnut bundt cake, and was delicious. found i need to add in a bit more confectioners sugar to thicken it a bit. the lemon flavor made it refreshing; just great.
