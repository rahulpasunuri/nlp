Made this cake 2x - yesterday and in 2011. Modifications to 2013 cake resulted in light cake w/ subtle and complimentary flavors. Got rave reviews from Iranian/American and Polish/German friends who do not like overly sweet desserts. Used standard baking practices - ingredients at room temp, preheated oven; frosting bowl, whip and ingredients at cold temp (kept mine outside in 20deg F for an hour). Used the following modifications: 5 egg whites, 1/2 tsp cream of tartar, and NO added sugar in egg whites; 3 Tbsp water + 3 Tbsp rosewater, 1 tsp ground cardamom (did not like whole seeds in cake); liked the tsp lemon peel for the subtle citrus "zing". Beat yolks, then added oil until incorporated, then added waters. Baked in parchment-lined 10x15 sheet pan for 15-17 mins then cut for three (3) 5"x10" layers. For frosting: used 1 Tbsp rosewater, 1 tsp ground cardamom. First time I made this cake, I used grocery store roses to make candied petals - dried overnight, no problems. Second time, I used coarsely chopped toasted pistachio on sides. Cake was just slightly chilled when served and I found it was quite nice that way. Looking forward to make this cake again!

I enjoyed this cake however not everyone enjoys the flavour of rosewater. I would definitely make this again.Note: the only place I could find rosewater in my town was from a pharmacy, go figure.

Exotic and amazing cake for a special occasion. I am glad that I read the reviews before I went to the time and expense though. I agree with others who say many of the these cake recipes don't deliver the volume that the photos indicate, so I actually doubled the cake amounts. I also added more rosewater and less plain water. The aroma and flavors were unbelievable. The sugared petals never dried though, does anyone have any idea why?

Love this recipe. The cake is perfect,light and moist. I love the flavors of middle east, but wouldn't assume others would. Only a very inexperienced event planner - is this you angelmesbahi? - would serve this to a gathering without testing the recipe first. I've made the recipe as written and also modified it by filling the cake with a ground pistachio/rose water flavored whipped cream and using the saffron/rose water cream only for the frosting. I use a 10" heart shaped spring form pan. It makes a single 3" layer which I cut in half and fill.

This recipe is delicious, as is, with little modification. The flavours are delicate and do not need to be strong. I only modified it by incorporating slightly more grated lemon zest. I followed the recipe exactly, although I made cupcakes. The cupcakes rose as expected, so I can't explain why others had cakes that did not rise. The only addition I will try in the future is to add Dr. Oetker's Whip It to the whipped cream topping. I found that it started to slide off my cupcakes, even though they were fully cooled. The pistachios and rose petals are a nice touch!

I made this cake for Valentine's day and after reading the (very helpful!) reviews, made alternations to the recipe and still was a bit disappointed at the end result. The cake itself turned out quite well but the flavoring ingredients (lemon peel, rose water, cardamom) really needs to be adjusted to get the taste just right. I will definitely increase the lemon peel to about a tablespoon and a half and perhaps also add about a teaspoon to the frosting. The cardamom I have is VERY strong and it overpowered everything else. I also increased the egg yolks to 4 and egg whites to 5 (thank you to the person who suggested that!). I didn't strain the saffron and it was quite pretty. I wasn't going to use rose petals but instead sprinkled a few sweetened dried cranberries and crushed pistachio though much less than the amount called for in the recipe. I think Epicurious should perhaps experiment a bit and rewrite the recipe. My cake tasted like the Indian ice cream, kulfi.

Just made this for a group today and it was superb! Light cake with great flavor even without altering it much. Because I wasn't sure how adventerous my guests would be, I stuck close to the recipe with some minor alterations. My pans are 9 inch so the cake looked pretty flat. After spending time prepping those rose petals I wanted a grander looking cake and ended up making a second batch. It's an easy recipe. My alterations were: 5Tbsp of water + 1 Tbsp on rose water to the yolk mixture. A little more cardomon, and some ground star anise. The second batch I added some ginger and more lemon zest. Frosting: A little almond extract just for an underlying note. I think with my 9 inch pans I will now make 1 and a half recipes. Thank you all for your tips. I really appreciated them.

I did not make this cake, my brother -in-law did (twice) and I found it to be wonderful. I love the subtleness of the flavors. You taste all that goes into it, yet it isn't overpowering. It was picked out for a wedding shower and was beautiful. The only thing we noticed is you either LOVE it (as is) or you don't. I would recommend it for any elegant gathering.

This cake was great! A wonderful recipe for a base chiffon cake. I was a little disappointed by the frosting.. I was hoping for a more dense, perhaps whipped buttercream, but other than that, the taste was amazing. I also had a hard time finding the rose water; there aren't any Middle-Eastern Markets in Northwest Arkansas :(

There is simply not enough batter to make a cake of the height shown in picture, therefore make 1 1/2 times batter. Or make recipe twice for 4 layers. Yes, use cream of tartar and don't grease pans. Yes, crush cardamom,double amount, double rosewater with frosting if people are used to eastern flavours (then exceptional), otherwise very nice with more subtle flavours. Organic rose petals almost impossible to get...therefore in order to make impressive birthday cake, used pistachios, sprinkled frosting with edible gold (cheaper than the roses!) and was able to find some fresh edible flowers (didn't candy) at Whole Foods in the herb section. Also used Dr. Oetker whipit to stabilize the frosting. Rave reviews from guests and complemetary ending to birthday buffet of Indian finger food. However, reading other reviews was mandatory for success...Epicurious needs to rewrite their recipe and/or publish a more realistic image.

The candied rose petals were the best part. The cake itself did not rise, so had to baked another batch after I made few changes. The frosting was delicious and I added more cadamom seeds powder. Also sprinkled some candied fennel seeds which enhanced the flavor.

I haven't made this cake yet, but it already makes my mouth water. I've been reading everyone else's suggestions and when I make this in September for my boyfriend's birthday, I'm planning to experiment with something new. I am planning to: 1. Add 1 tsp ginger to the cake batter 2. Make a light lavender syrup to drizzle on the cake before frosting it (perhaps add tiny amounts of ginger and cardamom to it) 3. Add a bit of partially ground lavender to the frosting -- it might overpower the rosewater, but I hope if I just use a little, it will complement the rosewater Any other constructive advice is welcome. I'll let you know how this experiment goes.

One of my favorite desserts is bastani, a Persian ice cream flavored with saffron and pistachios, so I knew I had to try this cake out. It was fabulous! I did modify the recipe a bit: I added 3 Tbs rose water to the cake batter and used 1 tsp ground toasted cardamom seeds. I also added a pinch of cardamom to the frosting and used 1 Tbs rose water instead of a teaspoon. The frosting was WAY too much-I'd probably make half the amount next time. I found unsalted pistachios and organic roses at Whole Foods. The rose petals were a bit of work, but absolutely beautiful and delicious. The pistachios were a must! I highly recommend this cake and would make it again.

I just made this cake for the second time because I was determined that with a few tweaks it would be amazing. After reading the other comments and getting some really good tips from them, I went ahead and made this for my daughter's 20th b-day. Success! It was much better the second time around. I used the pinch of cream of tartar in the egg whites. I used 2 extra egg whites. I did not butter the sides of the pans. I replaced 2 Tablespoons of the water in the cake batter with 2 Tablespoons of rose water and this is where I sensed the most rose flavor came through. Much more so than in the whipped cream despite adding 4 teaspoons of rose water to that. I ground more cardamom seeds than called for. I also bought another brand of rose water. The first year I used some from a little blue bottle from France. I had just bought it, but maybe it was old to begin with because the more I added in my effort to get any hint of flavor, the worse it tasted. This year I had good luck with "Alwadi" brand rose water from Lebanon which I bought at the Brattleboro Food Co-op in Vermont. This is where I also bought some tiny organic dried rose buds to decorate the cake with since I didn't have fresh available. I was pleasantly surprised when my daughter's friends raved about the cake. I feared it would be too exotic for them, but they couldn't get over the aroma which they loved.

Rating: 3
This was really good, and super pretty, but I found the flavour was a little subtle. I would make it again, but up the amounts of the 'exotic' ingredients - more rose water, more saffron. It's very nice as is, but I think if you're going to use such an unusual (for a western palate) combo in a dessert, it should come through a little more. I decorated my cake with candied starfruit.

I haven't made this cake yet. But after reading the reviews, I want to offer some tips that may help you with baking chiffon cakes: 1. Don't grease the pan. 2. Whip the egg yolks until foamy. Add in the sugar, a little at a time. Beat well after each addition. Beat the yolks until the mixture is thickened to the point that it can form a ribbon when you pull up the beater. 3. Beat oil into the yolk mixture, a little at a time. 4. After the oil and yolks have completely incorporated, add in all the water. Mix well. 5. When you measure the flour, spoon the flour into the cup and then level with a knife. 6. Sift the flour for at least 3 times. 7. Use a wire whisk to fold in the egg whites. 8. Make sure that the oven is well-preheated. Happy baking!

I also had trouble finding unsalted pistachios, and ended up washing them. I used three 9-inch pans and increased the whipped cream by 1/2 cup, thinking I would not have enough to cover. I did end up having left over frosting. My main recommendation: make this cake in winter, not on a humid June day. Reduce the lemon zest and increase the cardamom (ground). I might look into using another sponge recipe too, because when I had all the non egg-white ingredients together, it wasn't batter, it was tough dough. Finally, use your hands to cover the rose petals with eggwhite foam rather than a pastry brush, it's just easier (and keep the rose petals off the cake if you are storing it for more than a few hours). Family gave this rave reviews.

I was so very excited to bake this cake. I put many hours of careful research into reading comments from all over the web and getting all the perfect ingredients. Very good cake- but not incredible. To be honest, I do not consider it to be worth the cost. I followed directions exactly with the exception of doubling the rose water. Very unique and was a great hit but the rose water just did not shine the way I had hoped-- even with increasing the amount as previous reviewers had stated. It was very fun to make and I would make it again, but will play with the rose water until it can actually be sensed. Also, the cake part itself came out a little too dense- I had hoped it would be lighter. Again, other than these two short-comings, this was a deliciously unique cake but there are numerous other "middle eastern" cakes that surpass this in taste, simplicity to make, and cost (try sfouf, http://www.bakespace.com/recipes/detail/~Sfouf~-My-Favorite-Childhood-Cake-!--As-moist-as-a-cake-should-be!/46462/, it might not look as pretty but was rated much higher when I brought it as compared to the persian love cake). Happy baking.

I just made this recipe and am really pleased with the result. I did tweak it a bit - I increased the number of egg whites to 5 and doubled the cardamom. I decided to forgo the frosting this time but will plan on making the frosting the next time I do this cake.

Oh my. This is fabulous. I'll add more cardamom and lemon peel next time to kick it up a touch. Worked perfectly as a Sunday brunch offering today. Easy to make, different and special. This little gem provided the perfect opportunity to try something new. So glad I did.

Hello, how much cream of tartar should be added to this wonderful recipe? (I will come back and rate with comments once done!). Thank you!

Continuation: For the frosting, I used 2 pinches of saffron threads and did not strain them out as I love the exotic look they lend the white whipped cream. Also, I only used a total of 1 ¾ cup of heavy cream because the amount listed would have yielded too much for my liking. I zapped the beater, bowl, saffron cream, heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and the rose water in the freezer for 10 minutes before starting. Using a bowl full of ice water under the KitchenAid bowl allowed all the ingredients to remain very cold while whipping. It took only 4-5 minutes on speed 6 for it to become frosting. For the garnish, I could only find salted pistachios so I rinsed them well in a colander for 4 minutes under the cold water spray head and their brown skin peeled right off. The cake looked absolutely adorable with the dried cranberries arranged into a large heart shape on the top with the pistachios strewn around and on the sides. I also added about two pinches of lemon rind to the center of the heart for added adornment. The cake tasted heavenly and was oh-so fluffy. My family was VERY skeptical about this cake as they are junkies for dense rich cakes but I was able to win them over with this one! Next time, I will use pomegranate and almonds to garnish the cake instead. This project took me nearly 4.5 hours but now that Ive completed this first trial run, I believe it should only take me 2 hours the next time I make Persian Love Cake.

I dont remember how I stumbled upon this recipe for Persian Love Cake, but I do know that once I read it over, I became obsessive about making it! I did extensive planning and research for about a week before getting down to business. I read every blog I could find and studied these reviews like a student before an exam. I had no trouble finding rosewater at our local Pakistani/Indian grocery but not for the life of me could I find unsprayed roses anywhere. I searched and called dozens of places but to no avail. Thus, being more than a little disappointed about not having the keystone ingredient, I used dried cranberries that I had on hand in its place. I created a master list of alterations and tips to the recipe: I used two 8 x 1.5 pans with only a circle of parchment paper on the bottom, absolutely no grease anywhere. For the batter, I increased the cardamom to 8 pods, grinding them finely with a mortar and pestle. In addition to increasing the lemon rind to 1.5 teaspoons, I added a few strands of saffron to the batter as well. I increased the egg whites to 4 and made sure that they were room temperature before whipping. I squeezed in a little more than an 1/8 teaspoon of lemon juice to help the egg whites form stiff peaks. The cake took 35 minutes to bake. Upon exiting the oven, I immediately took them out of the pans and rested them on a wire rack to cool. Leaving the cakes in their pans would lock in steam which deflates them.

This was a disappointment. My cake definitely did not taste like a cloud - more like a pound cake gone wrong. It deflated and started sweating at the top. Also, the icing was very strange as it tasted like very sweet whipped cream rather than a creamy, buttery icing. Considering the amount of work that was put in I won't be trying this again anytime soon!

Amazing and beautiful. I'm a pastry chef at a restaurant, and I love to make this cake in mini, single sized versions to be served with a lovely swirl of meyer lemon curd on the plate. I add a few tablespoons of rose water to the cake itself (just replace it for 3tbls of the plain water), and always a little extra lemon zest. I also add more rosewater to the frosting. It's perfectly sweet, not overbearing. A very delicate cake. I don't usually add the saffron to the frosting because it's so pricey, and I always use ground cardamom, and definitely more than the recipe calls for. I spent the time to make the candied rose petals once, and they're delicious, but painstaking. They aren't necessary except for decoration, and the pistachios sprinkled about are just as nice with a few plain rose petals on the side. It's so floral. I could go on and on. A perfect spring time dessert!

This cake is fabulous the flavours are unusual but delicious. I ground my cardamom and then pushed it through a fine sieve, just beautiful flavours and lovely light sponge.

Rating: 4
I made this cake exactly as directed with two exceptions: I had no rose petals and only used 2 cups of cream, which was plenty. The cake had a lovely lemony flavor that really went well with the cardamom; the rose flavor was very mild,so even those who don't like floral flavors would like this. Next time, I will add more rosewater and a bit more saffron. To make the cake rise higher, whip the yolk mixture with an electric mixer; no need to add extra egg whites.

I made this cake several times, and entered it in the Iowa State Fair cake division - I placed 1st place in 'cakes other than named' class (vs chocolate, carrot, yellow, etc...). All 1st place cakes then go head-to-head for best cake overall - out of 31 classes I took overall - a HUGE win! The judge gave it a perfect score of 100, and said it was "...like walking through a rose garden". I did make some of the suggested recommendations - 5 whites with a litte cream of tartar, and an additional teaspoon of rose water in the frosting. Also, to keep the cake from deflating, invert your pans while cooling - just like you would for chiffon or angel food cake.

This cake was not as much work or time as I expected. I followed recommendations: did not grease the pans but used parchment, doubled and crushed cardamom, used cream of tartar with the egg whites, and was generous with the rose water. End result was good. Not as amazing as I had hoped, but really good. I'd recommend a large pinch of saffron. And even though my cake didn't rise so much, it tasted good!

I've made this several times and it is very good.... but I always have trouble hunting down organic roses (the petals sprinkled on the cake really make it look much more special) Maybe its time to start my own rose garden.

Well I finally got the perfect opportunity to make this cake and was not disappointed. I loved the perfumed cream and the taste of the cardamom in the cake--very exotic and everyone just loved it. However, after having many not so great experiences with the cake recipes on this site (lots of filling but too thin layers) and reading the other reviews I decided not to chance it and used the recipe for Chiffon cake in Joy of Cooking. It called for 5 yolks and 8 egg whites so I used nine inch pans and didn't grease them as advised by so many other reviewers. I just added the lemon zest and cardamom. I even used EVOO instead. I didn't increase the frosting and it was a very good balance. The final results were perfect. One more thing, we can't get organic roses so I went out and picked wild roses and used those instead.

I used this recipe to make a small wedding cake and it turned out wonderfully. It is a "short" cake, the layers are a little flat. You can see that in the pic. I added a third layer and we got about 30 thin servings. (The bride's idea of having multiple cakes backfired as I was the only person to follow through. Thankfully it was a small wedding.) I couldn't find organic roses so I decorated the cake with edible orchids and almonds. It was lovely.

Rating: 4
Excellent! CRUSH the cardamom seeds, do NOT GREASE the pan, do use the parchment in the bottom of the pan, and do use 5 EGG WHITES in the cake. These previous suggestions from other reviewers made the cake fail-safe. Don't worry about runny icing--just keep whipping it, and it will reward you. The chiffon cake and whipped icing are like eating a gently spiced cloud. I made it (the first time I have tried baking a cake in YEARS) as a wedding cake: 3 full batches to make a two-tier cake. And I recommend a cake leveler to split the layers to add the moist frosting as much as possible in between the cake layers. I used odd-sized pans to get the tiers to my liking, and followed the instructions for baking that came with the pans--a higher temperature, mostly--and they came out lovely. I skipped the rose petals due to source issues and used prefab sugar orchids from the craft store. Not truly edible on their wire foundations, but easy and beautiful. The frosting is so forgiving that even on disassembling the tiers, a quick flick of a spatula erased all hint of anything resting on the cake surface. It was such a pretty icing I didn't even think of piping it with my cake decoator set. And I usually dread the icing stage because it is when a cake can so easily become Franken-Cake. Not with this forgiving frosting! The pistachios are just the right color touch at the finish, and are fun to throw at the sides of the cake--they stick if you toss 'em hard enough! DO make this cake! It is lovely, and only gets more moist as it sits in the refrigerator. The icing has not, as I worried it would, gone liquid even days and days later. So easy, so delicious. The foodie newlyweds were awed, and so were the guests--and so was I because it had all been too easy.

I thought this cake was wonderful... I did have a hard time with my whipped cream, not sure if the rose water and/or saffron cream kept it soupy or not.. but I will make it again and follow catethegreat's advice ..It was light and sensual... a hit this memorial day!

I think that it is overrated and that it was an overall disappointment. I would not recommend this recipe to other people unless they have a passion for cardamom, which clearly I dont have. As my family also pointed out it tasted like a curry.

I have reviewed this recipe before but have made it a few more times with increasingly good results. I made three batches of this cake for a friend's wedding and found a nice little tip. I ran out of superfine baking sugar and used powdered sugar in the egg whites (which I've increased to 5).It definitely made a difference. There was much more loft in the last cake. I also added a 1/4 tsp cream of tartar. When folding the the whites into the flour mixture, I've found it doesn't need to be all the way blended. This also helps keep the whites fluffy. Also I agree about not greasing the pans. Helps keep it lifted. Use parchment on the bottom and if the cake doesn't pull away just run a knife along the top to loosen. I get nothing but raves when I make this cake. Please try it! You wont be disappointed!

I was in search for non-butter cake recipe for layer cake. The cake just came out of oven and cooling on rack. I used one 9in x 2high round cake pan for 30min. It looks perfect and no sign of deflating. I used 1/8tsp of cream of tartar for insurance for beating egg whites to reach thick marshmallow like stage. Also used a baking strip around cake pan for even baking and level top.

Makes great wedding cake. Made twice. One three tier and the second 4 tier. Very moist and delicious. Perfect marriage of Indian and middle eastern flavours. I also tried to moisten this cake with "tres leches cake" liquid. Makes it lot richer and smoother texture. Just loved it.

A beautiful & delicious cake. Took two tries to get the cake part right. My first attempt, the layers fell flat as well, then I realized this is a pretty traditional chiffon-style cake. You are NOT supposed to grease a pan when making a chiffon cake (just like angel food). The cake needs to grab onto the sides of the pan to keep its height, so that was a bad instruction. Put parchment in the bottom, don't grease the pan, & the layers come out beautifully, once cooled. I also increased the proportions for the cake by half, so as to have slightly higher layers. I would DEFINITELY make it again, with the modified recipe. I also saw cupcakes with this recipe elsewhere on the internet -- very cute!

Rating: 2
I had the same problem as many others with the cake layers falling flat. I thought it was due to the elevation here (5000ft). I took the advice to add a little extra cardamom and rosewater, but I'm not sure it was necessary because the end result was very strongly flavored. Because of the thin cake layers, there was an overpowering ratio of cream to cake. If I made this again (which I probably wouldn't), I would use half the amount of cream. I enjoyed the cake more with most of the cream scraped off. Also, I agree that the cardamom seeds should be crushed before adding. Biting into a whole seed is slightly unpleasant. Overall, a decent and unusual cake, but I didn't like it enough to make it again, though I'm a big fan of cardamom and rosewater.

I made this recipe into cupcakes and they turned out great. I used a little bit of vanilla extract to replaced a bit of water. I took suggestions from other reviews and doubled the cardamon. You definitely need to crush the pods really well. As for the deflating, while whipping the egg whites to a soft peak, i added a little lemon juice to give it some more alkaline. If you find that your egg whites are not whipping properly, it means that there is not enough alkaline in the egg whites. Therefore you can add some acidity like lemon juice or cream of tartar. The cake had a hint of lemon, and hint of vanilla. Overall, the cake was good and will make again

I made this cake for my sweetheart's 50th birthday party. It was delicious and we loved the flavors! I wanted to make a triple layer cake, and so made one and a half recipes of batter and baked it in a springform pan. It looked so beautiful and perfect in the oven, but deflated to one third its height on removal! How disappointing! Needless to say, there was no way to slice it into 3 parts... so I baked another one. The same thing happened, so we ended up with a two- layer cake, which was fine. I am a novice baker and wonder whether there is some trick to preventing cake deflation??? Also, I have a suggestion for the rose petals. We found that they smelled of egg and my sweetheart didn't like that. So we spritzed them with just a little rose water, which left them pleasantly fragranced. The finished cake looked gorgeous and everyone at the party loved it. I would definitely make it again, but would love to find a way to keep the cakes puffy and tall.

I made this cake for Valentines Day and everyone who tried it gave rave reviews. The only problem I had was that the cake deflated quite a bit after cooking. The tastes were interesting and subtle when I made the sample cake, so I added additional spices (some Garam Masala and Allspice) extra lemon zest and I was pretty heavy on the rose water...:) I have been credited with having a mature palete and enjoy exotic combinations. All together, this is a wonderful escape from the norm.

Oh my! What a delightful cake! Its like eating Spring. Ive made it twice now. The first time I didnt get the egg whites stiff enough and had a flatter cake. But I got NO complaints. The second time I added an egg white and a half (cooking with my three year old niece , hence the half) and beat the dickens out of the whites and had a much fluffier cake. It did deflate a bit after coming out of the oven. Any tips on how to avoid this? I still got no complaints. Not even from my super picky brother in law! Also, I did end up adding a scant bit more cardamom and I increased the rose water to about 2.5-3 tsp. I used the superfine baking sugar for the frosting for the first one and powdered for the second, no difference. Everyone has loved this cake, even caught a few going to the cake plate and scraping the bits stuck to the surface. I will say this though (as some have complained this cake is weird)- If youre not an ethnic foods fan, if you think putting flowers in salads is weird, if you dont like spicy (not even just with heat, just interesting spices) or if youre not really an adventurer on the culinary front in general, this cake MAY not be for you. I dont want to discourage anyone, but just an FYI. But please try it if you have an adventurous foods spirit, its so worth it. Even my tiny niece loved it!

I've made this cake numerous times, all to rave reviews! Absolutely crush the cardamom; doing so spreads the flavor through the cake without overpowering the lemon (as ground cardamom does), and eliminates the risk of someone breaking a tooth! Yes, more cardamom, yes, more rosewater, and I love how the saffron threads stain the cream, so I don't strain them. I cut the sugar and skip the candying, using fresh, FRAGRANT rose petals, which have their own captivating sweetness. Pistachios are not a must, but they're a lovely addition. For gluten- and wheat-free cake eaters, use 2 parts Brown Rice Flour and 1 part Quinoa Flour. Also, I make it a rectangular three-layer cake (Frankensteined from two 9-inch square pans)--even more decadent an unusual, and easier to make a beautiful half-recipe cake or several mini-cakes. There's never a morsel leftover!

This cake is great! I agree strongly with earlier reviewers who say to add more rosewater in the frosting and more cardamom in the cake: if you don't, those delicate flavors are hard to taste. (And I like things with delicate flavors-- putting a bit more won't make it too strong.) I didn't have rose petals, so I sprinkled pomegranate seeds on top- that was pretty, too.

Oh, and there a better recipes to candy the rose petals. I consider the garnish optional anyway.

This cake is always a big hit when I make it, everyone loves the exotic flavors. I use 9" rounds to have larger cake that stretches a little farther. Also, I recommend using ground cardamom in addition to or instead the seeds. It spreads the flavor to the entire cake and some people have an aversion to the texture or appearance of the seed.

This was by far one of the most interesting and truly splendid cakes I have ever made! And b/c of no butter and/or oil, one of the lightest. I made this for a friend's birthday and it was a resounding success! It was met with "ooohs" and "aaahs" and people asking "how did you make that? that's amazing!" I was very pleased. Some things I did differently: I didn't bother with the rosewater, I went straight for rose essence. I'm Indian and these flavours are common in our sweets so I felt comfortable working with them. What the recipe calls for is way too little. You'd barely get any flavor at all if you followed the original recipe. Anyway, I put approx 1/2 tsp of rose essence into the whipping cream (just adjust to taste) and for the saffron, I definitely added at least 3 pinches. Trust me, it was not overpowering, instead, it yielded a lovely flavor. Also, for the cardamom, I had about twice the amount of pods they recommended. I crushed them with a mortar & pestle and coarsely ground them. Biting into a whole cardamom is kind of gross. Finally, I doubled the recipe and used 2 9x13 pans. I then stacked on top of one another on a beautiful white serving platter. I sprinkled the rose petals and pistachios on top and then I used the remaining 4 whole rosebuds as decoration on the 4 corners of my cake. People were freaking out, I kid you not! This cake was beyond good! Such a nice alternative to chocolate, etc.

I am hoping I can get an idea of where I went wrong with this cake. The cake, which I made in cupcake form, was excellent in texture and in the flavors, however it continued to have this distinct taste and smell of egg. I am trying to figure out if anyone else had this problem or if I perhaps did not beat the eggs well enough. Any thoughts would be helpful because otherwise the cake was heavenly.

I love this cake! I made for Valentine's Day last year and now again for some friends. I didn't have immediate access to either rosewater or organic rose petals, so I used orange blossom water and slivered almonds instead of the petals and other nuts. It was so good I'm having a hard time bringing myself to give the original rosewater version a try!

i thought this recipe sounded so unique, and i love saffron and cardamom. however, the flavors ended up just being plain weird. the cake was very moist, which i love. but, the frosting turned out terrible... terrible texture, nice yellow color but... just not what i expected. too bad its my 2 year anniversary tomorrow with my boyfriend and i planned on surprising him tonight with a beautiful masterpiece. this cake made me look like a crappy cook!

I have made this cake twice, and it has always been enjoyed by all. It is definitely unusual, but I think that is why people like it so much. It is very different than the usually birthday baked good fodder. It was described by one of my friends as Claire! This is so delicious. It is like running through a field, falling down and landing with your mouth open on some flowers! It was said with excitement and sincerity, so pretty sure it was a poetic compliment.

I didn't really go for the saffron in the frosting, though perhaps I overestimated what a "pinch" was? The cake itself was pretty tasty, but if you want to taste the cardamum definitely consider adding some ground/crushed in addition to the seeds.

Wasn't sure about this at first; my palate is pretty pedestrian but I was baking for much more adventurous people. It was almost too weird at first, but it was excellent after having been in the fridge for a day or two. The flavors melded much better.

This is so good! I had to keep on saying it to myself. With it's exotic flavors it was perfect for my Indian themed birthday party. Everyone loved it, even the picky people.It was such a hit that I am making a second one just a week later. As a lover of cardamom I will use more seeds and maybe some ground. The petals are a process, so I will try to buy some instead. Give this cake a shot and watch people be surprised by how much they enjoy it.

This was such a refreshing change from the same old cakes. I am an Arab American and these are very traditional flavors found in our cooking. I followed the instructions of the cook on 6/19. Except I put lots and lots of rose water because I knew my family would love it. I would guess it was about a quarter cup. Make this cake and add rose water to your taste. Great recipe.

Truly outstanding! I made this two years ago for my daughter's "Pink is an Attitude" themed birthday party and this is now her special birthday cake no matter what the theme. The flavours are exotic but pleasing, the texture light and everyone devours it. I shall have to make an additional cake so that we can enjoy leftovers! Simple to make {we use roses from our garden} and an enormous wow factor:)

I agree with the first reviewer. A litle ground cardamom and the seeds is better. I would caution about using a poor quality rose water. Some have a distinct chemical taste and are nothing like roses. My mother in law considers this her absolute favorite cake.

This cake had a wonderful, delicate flavor that we really enjoyed. I used both the whole cardamom seeds and a little ground cardamom in the cake mix (I would have never likened the whole seeds to anything unsavory had I not read these reviews!). The rose water/saffron frosting tasted heavenly, though I increased the amount of rose water and decreased the amount of saffron according to my own personal taste.

Rating: 4
I found this absolutely delicious, and the flavors were really not controversial--who doesn't like saffron and rosewater? I made some of the minor changes suggested by others--extra rosewater, coarsely ground the cardamom, multipled cake recipe by 1.5 and made 3 layers. Used assorted pkg of edible flowers, uncandied, as they were too small and delicate for the candying process. This cake takes not much skill for such a professional looking and delicate result.

This was delicious and easy to do - I'll make it many more times for something special. It is very light - and beautiful! I just used fresh pansies out of the garden to garnish - easier than the rose petals.

This cake is gorgeous! I added a bit more rosewater to both the frosting and the cake, and crushed the cardamom seeds so they'd be more evenly spread throughout the cake. For organic rose petals, check Whole Foods' flower section - they have organic roses, and if you ask the clerk nicely you might even get a few petals for free! Since I didn't have any pistachios, I also candied a few violets from my yard - they looked lovely. I'm making this again for an auction donation - it fetched a $40 bid!

This cake was absolutely outstanding! Such a nice change from the typical cake, but I love cardamom and rosewater so I might be biased. I made it in a 9 inch pan and cut it into 2 layers. Didn't have saffron, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I didn't want to serve seconds because I wanted the leftovers all to myself. I'm already dreaming of an excuse to make it again.

what a fantastic recipe and cake. it's both unusual and straightforward to make. (and i'm the sort who always has some saffron, cardamom, and rose water on hand, as i do quite a bit of middle eastern cooking). the cake was perfectly light, the frosting heaven. a flavorful fluffy cake that's not too sweet at all. i only had ground cardamom so i used ground cardamom instead of whole cardamom ground up. i added 1/4 tsp extra of ground cardamom and the flavor was perfect. i doubled the amount of rosewater in the frosting, since i'm a big fan of rose water. i did NOT have rose petals on hand (it's february and even in Berkeley California roses are hard to find blooming this time of year). so i used a mint sprig as garnish. i tried doing the same treatment (egg whites+sugar+drying) with mint leaves but not with good result, which is why i used a fresh mint sprig. i would go further to say that next time and for more formal events, i would make this a 3 layer cake (I made a 2 layer). i'm a big fan of this cake! and my guests ALL loved it.

I served this last night to 16 guests at a dinner party. Only one other guy raved about it - I watched the rest pick at it with their forks and try to unobtrusively set it aside. Personally, I LOVED it - I messed up the candied rose petals (turned out too heavily encrusted) so I garnished it with fresh rose petals and rose buds as well as the pistachios. I increased the cardamom to 1/2 tsp but found it too much - next time I will use the 1/4 tsp, maybe plus 1/8 tsp. (Yes, I ground it coarsely so it didn't resemble mice turds.) I baked it in one 8 inch springform and sliced it into 3 layers. The three layers were lovely, I'd do it exactly the same again. I also increased the rose water to 3 tsp and still could just taste a hint of it. I've given this only two forks because although I loved it (and am loving the leftovers), few others liked it. I think I was casting my pearls before swine, though!

I brought this cake to a brunch celebrating the Hindu holiday Dewali. I had no idea what to contribute to this event and the cake was perfect, very light and beautiful and the flavors seemed appropriate with the Indian food. No time to make the rose petals, I lightly colored the frosting pink and sprinkled broken pistachios over it. If I make this again I will absolutely increase the rosewater and the cardamom significantly.

Rating: 4
Marvelous cake, easy to make and so elegant looking! The flavors work well together and are a nice change. I agree with the others who recommended increasing the amount of cardamom in the batter and rosewater in the icing, and a third layer does make it an even more impressive presentation. The most time consuming aspect was preparing the rose petals. Lovely, lovely recipe.

I am so intrigued by this recipe and would love to be able to make it but am unable to find organic roses (guess everyone in Iowa uses pesticides)and the rose water I ordered from a pharmacy came with the warning to consult the poison control center if ingested.

This was a huge disappointment considering the cost. This is just one of many VERY expensive dishes I have tried from this website that was a total disapointment. I don't think that I shall try any more. I think I could doctor this recipe so that it would be good, but as it is right now, I wouldn't make it again. If you have money to throw away, go for it. I was unable to get the very expensive ingredients locally so had to order them on line and couldn't find one retailer who carried them all so had to order from several different ones with HUGE shipping charges. This was about a $100 cake and it tasted so bad, I wouldn't serve it to anyone. I am an excellent cook so it isn't because I don't know what I am doing. I don't know how anyone can say that this is good. But then there are folks who can't say an unkind word about anyone or anything even if it's true. I can say it about a recipe.

I made this for a dinner with the inlaws and everyone gave it the thumbs up. It was a lovely change from the rich ganache-on-everything desserts I usually make. I would increase the cardamom (crushed in a mortar) and rose water by a little as I didn't find the flavours very noticeable. Btw- in eastern Canada rose water is available at Bulk Barn and I've found it in the west at phamacies- ask the pharmacist. The whipped cream help up while refrigerated but started to droop after dinner. Next time I'll add Oetker's WhipIt to hold the cream longer.

This cake is amazing....and simple!! Grinding the cardamom is not a bad idea but otherwise I followed the recipe to a T.

I am a pastry chef and frequently use candied flowers and petals for finishing desserts. I use the powdered egg whites that are available at most large grocers or at your local Wilton supplier; there are several brands available and are listed as just whites or meringue powder. These are pasturized and there is no concern about bacteria.

Just casting my vote in favor of whole cardamon instead of ground...I thought it tasted wonderfully piquant, not overwhelming, and liked the crunch, and even the little specks. Also, I'd suggest using a generous hand in spreading the frosting in between layers--I ended up with a vast quantity of lovely frosting with nowhere to go...

Thanks to the Cook from SF Bay Area, I used all your 6/19 suggestions and it really helped the cake. I used one 8-in. round cake pan that was 3" high; it baked perfectly in about 33 minutes and easily made 3 layers. I ground the cardamon and went easy on the rose water. The cake is delicately lovely and delicious -- my family enjoyed the unique flavors of this dessert.

This is not a rating or comment - I haven't tried the recipe. But for the cook in Austin, Texas, try Wilton Cake Decorating suppliers for nice, deep, well-made layer cake pans. I got 8-inchers from them. I don't have the books here, but I do remember that Wilton had some kind of chart in their books about how many cups of batter went into pans of varying sizes. Maybe their website could help you? Or one that deals with baking wedding cakes from one batter to fill several graduated cake pans?

jessieroyce, when egg whites don't whip to sufficient volume, it's often because there's a little oil or grease in the bowl or on the beaters. This prevents the whites from reaching their maximum volume. Make sure your bowl and beaters are absolutely clean. One trick is to wipe them with a paper towel moistened with a little vinegar after you wash and dry them. This will clean off any residual grease left from another recipe.

As a note about using raw eggs to "candy" rose petals. I have used raw eggs extensively to "frost" fruits such as grapes, cherries, pears and kumquats. I have also used much the same recipe to candy violets and pansies. Since sugar (a preservative and anti-bacterial agent) is used, I am not fearful of using raw eggs. The only issue in using such a recipe is to make sure that the fruit and/or flowers are unblemished and completly dry. I have kept candied pansies and violets in an airtight, dark container for up to a year. Never have I had any problems as long as enough sugar was used to absorb the egg white.

sorry, I haven't made the recipe, but how great actually is the risk of salmonella? I've eaten raw cookie dough by the pound, made Caesar Salad with raw egg, and used plenty of raw eggs in various recipes. I DO always wash the outside of the shell, before I crack the egg. I have NEVER heard of anyone I know getting sick from ice cream, cookie dough, salad dressing....if salmonella is not a problem in your area, and you are using fresh, hygenic, organic eggs, is this a realistic fear?

Rating: 0
I hate to clog up reviews with comments that do not refer to the recipe, and this is the first time I've done it, but the comment about egg safety is flat out wrong! Any time you are using raw eggs you are at risk of salmonella. The only way to be completely sure is to use cooked or pasturized eggs. And salmonella is actually on the OUTside of the egg, although there are a few strains (out of hundreds) that can easily penetrate the shell. If you're not sure who to believe, look it up somewhere else like the cdc.gov

To: A Cook on 07/02/05 Remember to use pasturized eggs when making the candied rose petals. Salmonella, anyone? It isn't the egg white that you have to worry about it is only the yolks that carry Salmonella. So, as long as you don't break any of the yolk when separating whites from yolks, you're ok.

This is a delightful cake which I have made several times to rave reviews. As was previously noted, the cake is not overly sweet, which I find to be a good thing. While this recipe has no real connection to traditional Persian cuisine, it is an imaginative non-traditional vehicle for incorporating the flavours of cardamom, rose water and saffron, found in so many traditional Persian desserts. The frosting is pleasant (just go lightly on the rose water), and the chiffon cake alone is excellent and versatile enough to use as the basis for other cake and dessert creations. In the preparation, I strongly feel the cardamom seeds should be coarsely ground. They are a disruptive texture in the cake and can be rather hard when bitten into. Visually, they are esthetically displeasing. (you can figure out what they might remind one of) A course grind will provide a sufficient "burst of flavour". The presentation of the cake can be enhanced by baking it in one 8 x 3 inch cake pan (for app. 40 minutes) and slicing into three layers. You can also use more filling between the layers (1 1/2 to 2 cups). With the frosting ingredient quantities listed in the recipe, I was able to fill and cover a three layer cake, pipe some simple decorations and still have almost 2 cups of frosting left over. In spite of what may be perceived as criticism, I do think this is a wonderful cake and it has found a solid place in my cake repertoire. Had the cardamom seeds been ground and the cake presented with three layers, it would have rated a firm 4 forks.
