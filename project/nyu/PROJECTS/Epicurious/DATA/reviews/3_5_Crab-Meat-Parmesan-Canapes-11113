To make it easier i used phyllo cups and and to make it special I used lump crab. I added some Old Bay as suggested in other reviews. Didn't have scallions so I used freeze dried chives. These are going in my favorites!

These are ALWAYS a hit. I do add Tabasco and sometimes use it to stuff and bake mushrooms.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Per some other reviewers I cut back on the mayo and added cream cheese. I also added a couple of heavy dashes of Old Bay. They were served in filo cups and were a definite hit.

Followed recipe exactly and it was fabulous. Served as appetizer at a dinner party where I made the complete Pinot-pairing dinner from Bon Appetit on this site (roasted pear salad, roasted lamb chops, potato/parsnip gratin, pistachio crisp dessert)subbing for the recommended appetizer based on bad reviews. Perfect substitution! Paired with Oregon Pinot Gris.

Great easy appetizer. Goes well with champagne. Recipe is even easier using Pride of France mini toasts instead of toasting your own bread.

Delicious, after taking most reviews into account. Started with Phillips canned crab we got at Costco. No cream cheese - ugh! - but add 1T Old Bay [yes: the Marylanders' essential complement!], 1 tsp dry mustard, pinch of sea salt, and then make up a mixture of Old Bay and slightly dry/older grated parmesan cheese to sprinkle on top before [a] baking 375 for ~10 minutes to melt/heat through and then [b] broiling 1-2 minutes to brown the top. We used pastry shells and sprayed a little chili oil in the bottoms before filling ...yum! Thanks for everyone's comments.

Good but not spectacular. I added the Bay Seaoning--definitely needs it. I took it to a dinner party and it disappeared.

Mixed reviews. I thought it was bland and added about 1 TBSP of ground ancho, but still found it blah. However, it was the first item to disappear from an appetizer table. I was told that someone was 'licking the dish.' Will make again and try to zip things up more to my taste. Sam's Club carries lump pasteurized crab meat for about $15/lb.

I used fresh crab meat I found for $5. Much better than imitation. Also, used 4 oz. crm cheese and 1/2 the mayo, added 1/2 tsp of Old Bay, 3 scallions ... forgot that I didn't have lemon juice at home, but it didn't seem to need it. Instead of using the bread I used premade mini fillo shells and baked for 6 minutes. Wonderful and super easy!

Yuck-very bland. Didn't have "Old Bay", maybe that was the problem. As written, the recipe is not worthy of a second chance.

Rating: 3
This is a good recipe IF you omit the parmesan. It simply overpowers the delicate crab. Make the recipe as shown, omit the parmesan completely, and add about 1/4 tsp Old Bay Seasoning. My guests inhaled them, raved about being able to taste the crab.

I might tinker next time - but my guests ate these light little things right up - they were a wonderful beginning and not filling.

Didn't use the suggested cream cheese (why wouldn't I think it'd be better with cream cheese?!) I think I'd tinker with the toast next time: brush with oil/butter and herbs. However, pretty good and I used extra to make some divine crab cakes (just added more bread crumbs). I'll do this again.

Finally a recipe where you can taste the crab! I used canned crab, only used 2 scallions, and added Old Bay seasoning & cayenne as suggested by another reviewer. Very easy and my guests ate it all up!

We really enjoyed this appetizer - using fresh lump crab meat and homemade mayonnaise made a good appetizer really special. We like anything that is this good and can be made ahead!

Great, but read prior reviews for adjustments. Was a great appetizer for New Year's Eve.

Good basic recipe, but agree with other reviewers that this recipe improves with "tinkering". Old Bay, green onion, cayenne, cream cheese, etc. are all good suggestions.

Rating: 4
This was awesome! I did not use fresh lump crabmeat as I did know how it would turn out but I did buy a good quality canned crabmeat. I also thought that 4 scallions was a bit too much so I only used 2. It turned out to be plenty. I also added Old Bay and just a dash of cayenne and used half mayo and half cream cheese as suggested, it was perfect! My husband and I are always looking for ways to improve recipes and he made a interesting suggestion of adding chopped artichoke hearts. I would absolutely make this again and may try his suggestion. Now that I know it works, I'll use quality lump crabmeat next time.

My guests loved this! Quite easy to make too.

I have made this dish a few times and have recieved rave reviews. I made it again for New Years Eve and they were devoured. Definitely add Old Bay, it gives it a little kick and great flavor. Also use a thin bread such as Peppridge Farm brick oven. It is a little more dense and really makes the recipe. I will make this again and again to be sure.

These were a big hit at my cocktail party. I substituted cream cheese for half of the mayo per reviewers advice. I also added tabasco and Spicet and Cajun Breakdown (local spices made by a chef - Geoffrey Michael - you might be able to find them on line) which gave this the perfect zing and depth. Everyone raved! I actually had people coming in to the kitchen and eating them off the baking sheet before I could get them on a serving platter! I used a party sourdough bread - perfect texture without toasting - just cut in half. I made the crab mixture the day before. SO EASY!!!

I loved this recipe because the crab mixture was make ahead which is great for a holiday meal. I also cup the may on half and added 4 oz of cream cheese and the old bay seasoning. Everyone really enjoyed them.

I've been looking for quick, easy appetizers, and this was great! The seasoning definitely needed to be kicked up. I used the Old Bay suggestion from the other reviews and like the results. I have found canned crab meat for about $12/pound that is excellent quality and doesn't require work. Will definitely keep this as a staple.

This is good, but I have a lot of other appetizer recipes that I would prefer. If I try it again I think I'll add some cream cheese as another reviewer suggested. I used fresh lump crabmeat and also added the Old Bay seasoning as suggested. As I said, it's good, just not phenomenal.

Rating: 3
Very easy, very good, I did crisp the bread beyond the point where they should have been, so I will try the peppridge farm bread idea next time, or not toast them ahead of time and watch more carefully (hey, it was new years eve!) I liked being able to cut out w/cookie cutter to make festive shape.What is "Old Bay"? It was not in spice section.

Rating: 2
These were just so-so. I read the previous reviews before making the canapes and a) added Ol Bay seasoning (good idea) and b) took out some of the mayo (bad idea). I found they were dry, and as they cooled began to get a little greasy. There just wasn't a lot of flavor. My suggestion would be to add a little tabasco. Whatever you do - make sure the seasoning (salt, pepper, etc.) is a little more than sufficient. The flavors seemed to mellow, which ended up making a bland canape.

This recipe is okay. I substituted softened cream cheese in place of the mayo. AWESOME!!

I followed some previous comments and added Old Bay seasoning, cut down on the mayo, and used slices of baguette. I sprinkled additional parmesan on the tops, heated them in the oven, and then browned them under a broiler. Excellent!

I've made these for number of years for parties. They are always a hit!! I always add curry powder, to taste. Also, serve on sliced baguettes. No need to toast bread. Can add finely chopped white onions. Just place under broiler til golden and puffed. YUMM!!

These were pretty good, but next time I will add some Old Bay, because crabmeat is not the same without it.

Magnificant and so easy! This needed a bit of color, so I added a sprinkle of Old Bay to the tops. Marylanders have a tough time eating seafood without it. Instead of toast, I put the crab mixture in pastry shells. I even made the crab mixture the day before to save time. They were a huge hit at our Christmas wrapping party! Everyone wants the recipe but it might just stay my secret ;) Merry Christmas!

This was a hit at my recent holiday party. What an easy hors d'oeuvre !! I will definitely make it again !!

This was fabulous! Extremely easy to whip up. The only thing I would do different was omit salt. The fresh parmesan was salty enough, without adding more.

This stuff is great! I made it one year for a family Christmas party, and everyone loved it so much that I make it every year now. It's easy, quick, and delicious. The only trick is finding the right bread to put it all on. All I can suggest is to experiment.
