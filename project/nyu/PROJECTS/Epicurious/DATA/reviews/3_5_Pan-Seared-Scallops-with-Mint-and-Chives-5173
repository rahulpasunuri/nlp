Like other reviewers, I consider this recipe as embarrassingly easy but subtle. It is very good but I wouldn't consider delicious and this is why I gave 2 forks. I also agree that the herbs can be added later (I would try half away to the end) and more herbs added after serving in dishes. I used an iron skillet and after adding the herbs I reduced heat to half. It took about 5 minutes or so (instead of 3) to make the sauce thicker. I served with brown rice made with roasted vegetables.

I made this as the appetizer course for a small dinner party and it was just spectacular. It's very easy to make and my guests absolutely loved it. The mint is very subtle and really enhances the flavor of the scallops. I will definitely be making this dish again.

Simple but subtle and embarrassingly easy. Should have basic accompaniments, nothing fancy.

A unique blend of flavors. Best made with fresh herbs and fresh lemon juice. I made the sauce with fish stock because I was out of clam juice. The flavor was almost too strong for the delicate flavor of the scallops tho' I had anticipated that and made adjustments for it. Stick with the clam juice. Nonetheless it was excellent and I will make it again.

I made this scallop dish because I wanted "easy" and easy it was. Very good, too; much better than I expected. My dinner guest would have awarded the recipe 3 1/2 forks. I considered lightly flouring the scallops, but didn't. However, I might do it another time. The herbs lost their bright color in the boiling of the sauce. I think they should be added near the end, or a few saved and sprinkled over the finished dish. I'm surprised more people haven't made this and reviewed the recipe.

So quick and easy! The sauce was light, tangy, and unique. Garnish with chive flowers.
