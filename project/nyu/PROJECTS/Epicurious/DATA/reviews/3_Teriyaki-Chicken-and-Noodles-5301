this is is to make and you can basically throw whatever you want in it. I marinated some beef cubes in a teriyaki sauce with some fresh ginger for about 45 minutes, then stir fried it up with some yellow onion in some toasted sesame & olive oil. Added some shredded carrot, red bell pepper, sugar snap peas, green onions and a little more teriyaki sauce. Simmered and ate it over the Udon noodles. Easy. Yummy for all.

This is one of my favorites, but I do add a lot more veggies - red pepper, broccoli, sugar snap peas, mushrooms, baby bok choy, whatever inspires me!

It is a good base as a recipe. However, It felt as though more was needed. Bamboo shoots, celery, something more than was in there.

This recipe was quick, but not that great. It was too spicy for my preschooler and not seasoned & sweet for us adults, who like real asian food. I would say some soy sauce and brown sugar need to be added to this recipe. This recipe has inspired me ti use soba noodles, but I will make my own traditional stir-fry ingredients.

I would agree with other comments... this is okay for a quick weeknight meal for fussy kids, but its nothing special. In fact, even my kids found it dull. I'm going to try the Terriaki sauce suggested by Lindsey-Jayne to try to add a little more interest as my boys are looking for a weeknight chicken / teriyaki staple dish.

A great everyday dish. This was very easy to make, and my 6 year old and 4 year old both loved it. It also had enough flavor to satisfy an adult palatte. And as an added bonus, it is very easy to simultaneously make a vegetarian version - a must for my husband. Next time, I might add edamme or other vegetbles for additional flavor and texture.

I made this dish for diner tonihgt and it was very simple and quick. I added Mushrooms and yellow onions cubed in 1/2 pieces stir fried seperatly from the chicken (cross contamination) no green onions. I will be making this again.. Thank you :)

Awesome, made just as directed and everyone loved it (including the dog when I accidentally spilled some on the floor!). Added Trader Joe's stir fry vegetables on the side and what a meal! Two thumbs up!!!

Defenitley add other vegetables. Otherwise you are losing out on colour and nutrients. I also added shopped garlic and ginger. An okay weekday recipe. And there's nothing wrong with using a store bought sauce.

I make this regularly, but I usually used cubed tofu in place of the chicken. I just really like it that way. Very good basic recipe to experiment with.

I like it better with chicken cut into chunks.

Could easily be vegetarian, or you could substitute shrimp, scallops, etc. Stir fry is soooo flexible.

This is a good basis for any number of additions/changes. The type of noodle could be changed, any number of vegetables could be added; red or other colored bell peppers work well to help visually. Also black sesame seeds add a nice contrast. I like a little more heat, so I double the crushed red pepper or add cayenne for spice. It can be made ahead, but the teriyaki sauce tends to cause the noodles to break down so I wouldn't try to do it too far in advance. This is child friendly and good for adults who are picky eaters.

Pretty good, but I did make revisions which I believe are important if you want it to have any taste. I agree that it's a total cheat to call the recipe "teriyaki chicken" when the t.sauce is store-bought, but with additions I think it is turned into a recipe. Just think of the t.sauce as a more flavorful option than straight soy sauce. Anyway I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and marinated it in t. sauce with some added fresh ginger. Cooked an onion first, then added the chicken, then an assortment of veggies (carrot, zuchinni, snow peas, the green onion), chili flakes and sesame oil for flavor. Sprinkled sesame seeds on it when done. Tasty.

A little boring. My boyfriend liked it...I thought I did something wrong because it just seemed like it was missing something. Next time I'll try adding something to spice it up...garlic maybe? I agree with a previous reviewer who said that 8 oz is enough noodle for 4 servings. If you're doubling everything else, leave that the same.

I understand that this dish isn't exactly authentic and doesn't require any skill as a cook whatsoever, but it has several redeeming qualities. First, it's incredibly easy and quick. Second, it's great leftover. Third, it is something that picky eaters or people who consider their eating habits "normal" as in they don't like anything different from what they are used to eating, like. Also, it can be served warm, room temperature or chilled. Two amendments to the recipe that have worked for me are substituting ramen noodles out of convenience and cost, and using LaChoy teriyaki sauce which I think is pretty disgusting usually, but for this recipe a more authentic sauce doesn't have the sweetness and syrupy texture to adequately flavor the sauce. Every time I make this dish, I am asked for the recipe.

This was an OK recipe. It was certainly quick, which is nice after work, but didn't have much flavor. Next time I'll add more spices, garlic, and I would stir fry the noodles separately.

Edible but not exciting at all. Perhaps OK for a desparation dinner. I won't make it again.

I agree with the complaint about this "recipe". If I wanted to buy teriyaki sauce, I wouldnt need to use this website for instructions on how to use it. I made a really good teriyaki sauce out of my head yesterday, and you can try it out if you want: 1/2 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar 1/2 - 3/4 cup white cooking wine 1 clove garlic 1/4 tsp dried/powdered ginger 1 oxo cube, mixed with 3/4 c water dash dried chilli pepper flakes dash fresh pepper mixed that all together on the stove in a shallow pot, and thickened it with corn starch. i served it with stir fried vegetables and rice. i barbecued chicken, and brushed it with a more condensed version of the above sauce. the family and friends LOVED it.

Store bought teriyaki sauce? Other than amounts of veggies, chicken, and noodles what about this constitutes a recipe? Anyone can cook some vegetables and meat I need a good recipe for teriyaki sauce.

Although this was o.k. as written, I found it to be bland. Next time I make it (and I will make it again, because it was a nice change from just having a sandwich for lunch at work), I will stir-fry the chicken in some chili oil to give it more kick. And definitely add more veggies! The 8 o.z. of noodles the recipe required would make a good base for four servings.

Ah, c'mon guys. Give ol' Gene a break. Maybe he was on the cusp of some wild fusion-type experimentation! How else do some wonderful culinary discoveries occur?! I was just surfing tonight to find something to "do" with teriyaki chicken thighs, barbequed, and some kind of pasta. Will definitly give this a whirl. Just a note: as I was sampling the just-off-the-grill chicken, there happened to be a chunk of Parmesan nearby. I shaved off a thin slice and paired it with the chicken. Guess what?! I didn't DIE and it was even somewhat complimentary.

This sizzles with simplicity, and works well when pressed for time. It lacks extravagence, but the cleanup afterwards takes little time, and pasta with teriyaki sauce is a great alternative to pasta with marinara sauce.

Not amazing but good on a night when you don't have the time and energy to cook something wonderful. I would say this yields more than 2 servings. I added mushrooms, pea pods and one clove of garlic. I would make it again when I'm not feeling very inspired.

This is a pretty good recipe, good-tasting and very easy. But I would say it's a once-in-a-while dish..I tried it a second time only four days later and didn't like it as much.

Supremely easy. I followed others' advice and marinated the chicken in teriyaki, added red bell pepper and garlic to the stir-fry, and used ramen noodles. It may not be "gourmet," but it's tasty and quick; you'd be mad to add parmesan cheese.

Things I liked about this recipes: easy and fast to make, good for lunch the next day, and relatively healthy. I added some additional vegetables. One note though, oriental noodles (I used soba) are better when they are slightly al dente, so keep an eye on them while they're cooking.

I marinated the chicken in mirin and teriyaki sauce for about 15 minutes while I prepped the rest of the ingredients. When I added the veggies to the wok, I also added bean sprouts, pea pods, fresh ginger and garlic. This was a great weeknight dinner - easy and very flavorful.

Great for an easy meal. I marinated the chicken with pickled ginger,teryaki sauce,and mirin for about 30 mins before cooking. I added all these into the wok. Some chopped corriander worked quite well, as did bok choy. Packaged udon noodles cut down preprartion.

This is a good weekday dinner. I add a little ginger and white wine or sherry, a tsp or two to the teriyaki sauce to add a little more flavor. GREAT AND EASY!

As I sit here eating the leftovers for lunch, I can tell you that this is probably the best Asian noodle dish that I've made at home. I'm a fairly experienced cook and have made a variety of Asian noodles with huge ingredient lists, but the flavor never seems really special. I used angel hair pasta instead of the thicker Azumaya noodles that I normally use for Asian dishes and this seem to contribute to the good outcome. My husband pronounced it "REALLY good", which pleased me since he is a very picky eater. Of course, the fact that its "quick" adds to its being a real keeper. I highly recommend that you pair it with another recipe found on this website called "Super Slaw", which is an Asian-style cole slaw. You won't regret it. The dressing is absolutely superb.

This recipe has become a staple dinner in our house once a week. I use spagetti instead of soba and use garlic chili paste (lots) instead of red pepper flakes. I also marinate the chicken in teriyaki sauce for several hours or overnight. Finally, I add broccoli and any other vegetables I have around. Fabulous!!

Shame on Gourmet for sharing this god awful receipe! I've been cooking for many, many years. I've been a subscriber to Gourmet. I've certainly had more than my share of lousy dinners... but this one wins the cake! I followed the recipe to the letter. It was literally tasteless. I tried to spark it up with clam sauce... that didn't work. I put parmesan cheese on it and that did't help either. When I ran out of ideas to make is edible... I threw if out! Bad, bad, bad!

I needed to use up some shrimp so I added it instead of the chicken and it still came out good. I also added a bit of fish sauce to the dish. Wonderful slightly chilled as well. Great for a quick and easy dinner!

Chicken should be removed before sauteeing the veges. Also splash of Fish Sauce adds slightly salty flavour in keeping with the origin of the recipe.
