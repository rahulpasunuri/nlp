Very good tender ribs. Cooked in a dutch oven on the stovetop and put in oven. The recipe doesn't state, but strain the gravy and discard the solids. I didn't have port, so I just added a bit more wine. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I added some pomegranite balsamic vinegar instead. I cut the bone and fat of the ribs prior to plating.

Amazing! The sauce was so phenomenal, I want to put it on everything! Made this with the Sour Cream-horseradish Mashed Potatoes as recommended and loved both together very much. I will definitely be making this again, but for more people next time since it is pretty time consuming.

Wow- really excellent- I used maybe about 2/3's of the wine/broth and didn't have to do any thickening with the roux. Excellent with the spinach and the horseradish mashed potatoes

Unbelievably good! -- deep, rich, sophisticated flavors that also satisfy the most primal meat desires ... I followed others' advice and let cool overnight to better skim the plentiful fat away. I also omitted the butter-flour-roux, as I inadvertently cooked longer in oven than called for by about 60 minutes -- this reduced the sauce to perfection without overcooking the beef -- or adding any more fat or heaviness. Other minor amendments: Used beef broth, only a splash of port. Served with horseradish mashed potatoes and the wilted spinach -- absolutely fantastic!

Used trayed Short Ribs and horse radish mashed potatoes. We and our guests thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and unanimously agreed, this is a keeper recipe. We made two minor adjustments:1) the ribs were not returned to the pot until the aromatics were cooked. 2)We used roux to thicken liquid. We will be making this recipe again.

Definitely make it sufficientlay ahead of time put the strained sauce in the refrigerator or freezer. Then you can easily remove the layer of fat. Use half the broth (I used beef instead of chicken both). If you take the time to reduce the sauce separately from the meat, there will be no reason to add the butter/flour mixture to thicken. Throw a couple of tsps. of prepared horseradish in your mashed potatoes. Cuts the sweetness of the sauce.

This was a fatty disappointment that tasted a lot like sauerbraten, but greasy. It took two scrubbings to get the pot clean, too.

so tender and good. i only added 1/2 the wine, skipped the port and changed the chicken broth for beef stock and it worked beautifully. just the right amount of liquid and the whole house smelled sweet and savory.

This was an outstanding recipe, though I left out the port because I didn't have it. Make sure to use a very large dutch oven because there is a lot of liquid that goes in the oven. Don't reduce the amount of liquid because you need it for the sauce. My husband loved the short ribs and wants the spinach again!

Very nice. Left out the port and reduced the amount of broth and wine based on another review. Glad I did- it made plenty of sauce and was plenty sweet with the honey. I think port would have made it just a touch too sweet.

Not a huge fan of this recipe. The flavors were complex and interesting and the meat was tender but not something I'd likely try again. I was shocked by the sheer volume of liquid that went into the braise. 4 cups of stock PLUS 1/2 cup of port PLUS a 750 ml bottle of wine...this is easily 3x as much liquid as is called for in any other recipe. My ribs (and I did 6 pounds of flanken-style) were swimming in the pot of liquid. It looked like I was stewing rather than braising. The lovely melted collagen mouth feel that usually is part of the short rib experience was lost in this recipe. All the boiling down of the liquid volume did concentrate the flavors but made the end product taste flat instead of vibrant. I wonder what the outcome would be if the liquids were cut by 1/2 or 1/3? Perhaps all the money we shelled out for the ribs would be better worth it.

So rich! My family absolutely loved it. The perfect comfort food for the upcoming winter months. Do make the potatoes!

I substituted buffalo short ribs for beef but otherwise followed the recipe (I forgot to make the spinach). I served it with horseradish mashed potatoes and spanish prosciutto wrapped asparagus. I had a few buddies over for the game; all raved and one said it was the best meal he has ever had from a home.

Rating: 3
Easy to make just takes a bit of time. Overall, very good and got great compliments on it but I personally found it to be a bit greasy and that was after I let it sit in the fridge over night. Tried it first with mashed potatoes which went great with the sauce. I had leftovers with some egg noodles but they didn't soak up the sauce well.

Rating: 3
These were fabulous. Very easy to make... I followed the recipe to the letter, and served them w/ the sauteed spinach and the horseradish mashed potatoes. Nice balance of sweet and tangy... combined w/ the spicy horseradish potatoes... perfect. My fave short ribs recipe used to be the one w/ the red wine gravy from this site, however this one is better.

Rating: 4
Really wonderful comfort food. I followed other reviwers advice and roasted the ribs for 25 minutes at 400 instead of browning them in the pan. Even so, I skimmed off gobs of fat. The only change I made to the recipe was forgetting to add the port (!) which I think would have made it taste even better.

I'm not as impressed as most people by this recipe. It was okay, but tasted more like a stew. Quite a bit of work (I also followed other reviewers and let the sauce chill overnight to skim off the fat). The meat was tender.

Excellent recipe. Didn't bother with the spinach but did serve over the horseradish potatoes. Yum! We also love the savory Provencal recipe found on this site too. Do render the ribs in the oven (bone side down at 450 for 45 minutes, drain fat with baster, and roast 15 more minutes. Deglaze roasting pan.) rather than in the pan. It is easier and neater.

Fantastic dish- I have made this recipe many many times, with my dinner guests all swooning. Have followed all the tips regarding baking before braising and skimming the fat after refrigerating the sauce and ribs separately with great success. Only change I've made which was great was to use my immersion blender to actually puree all those wonderfully flavored but thoroughy cooked vegetables and meat bits into the sauce. This results in an even more extraordinarily flavored sauce with a nice hearty texture. A real winner!!!!

Rating: 3
I would definitely make this again. Very good and relatively easy. I did follow two tips suggested below, which probably made it both easier and better. 1) I roasted the ribs in my convection oven at 400 for about 20 minutes (NOT 45 minutes at 450 as someone suggested) to brown them and drained the fat. 2) I strained the sauce before reducing it at the end to remove the vegetable matter.

I made this today for Sunday dinner. I started it early this morning and had it all in the fridge by noon. What a great company dish it would be cause all the work can (and should) be done in advance! It's very rich and very delicious. Got raves from my family. I made it exactly by the recipe, other then, like others have suggested, I roasted the ribs in the oven first and drained away loads of fat.

This is my absolute favorite recipe for short ribs! I also browned the ribs in the oven and increased the amount of spinach. I have made it several times now. Once I made it for just 2 people and froze the leftovers, which were great reheated.

Thanks to the cook from Westlake Village for the tip to remove the ribs from the juices before placing in the fridge. This makes it much easier to remove the solidified fat from the juice. This recipe is a keeper

Love this dish! It is quite sweet, so be prepared - can be really difficult with dry red wines. I have made this recipe with boneless country-style pork ribs with good results. Less of the fat to deal with and often quite cheap at the grocery store.

Excellent, excellent. Definitely a dish that would wow guests. Simple, although the cooking time is long, which was fine with me, as it yielded amazing results. Served with mashed potatoes and the snap pea and carrot recipe on the site.

A wonderful dish. I followed the advice of earlier reviewers and roasted the ribs in the oven first. This was a much easier and less messier process than browning them on the stove. Plus cups and cups of fat were roasted out. I then followed the recipe with the exception of removing the ribs from the sauce (before adding the flour-butter mixture), refrigerating for several hours and then removing the thick layer of solidified grease. Even with the roasting and refrigerating, the ribs were very rich. Some people may not like them because of the way the fat makes them taste. I, however, love the rich flavor of the meat. And the sauce is simply delicious. I did not find it to be too sweet, even with the Port and the honey. I served this to four adults and four kids and all but the five-year-old loved it.

Excellent recipe - this one is a definitely company worthy. I took one reviewers advice and browned the ribs in the oven at 450 (I used convection). It was so easy and really got rid of a lot of fat. Put the ribs in one layer in a deep pot to prevent some of the splatter. I braised the ribs, refrigerated overnight, skimmed off the fat (which would be easier if you separate the ribs from the sauce before refrigerating), reheated, reduced, and with the addition of the flour,(mixed with water), I had a sauce/gravy to die for!! The meat fell off the bones and they weren't very fatty. I served the ribs on a bed of spinach with garlic mashed potatoes. If you like spinach and it's the only veggie your serving you could use one 6 ounce package per person.

I've made this dish a number of times and it's always a major success. Some of the things I've learned: - as others say, make it a day ahead, separate out the meat from the sauce, refrigerate them all, and scrape off the fat from the sauce (but don't get rid of it!) - some people don't like it as sweet; you can leave out the port in that case. It's not that sweet to my taste, and I love the rich port taste - I've made this for holidays and one criticism is that the sauce isn't thick enough to be "gravy" - so I used some of the fat and made brown gravy with it and some of the sauce. VERY VERY good. - I separate the sauce from the cooking stuff - basically, after taking out the meat, pour it through a sieve. Smush as much as you can through the sieve, but leave the rest behind. (and you get to eat the little bits of meat that you find.) - One person I know made the recipe and tied the large pieces of short ribs so that they didn't fall apart. I like them falling apart, but if you want the presentation, that works. - It works great with horseradish mashed potatoes, but all the recipes I've tried here have been too strong. I now use 1/4 the amount specified, or none at all

Rating: 4
Never fails to get raves. It's my favorite entertaining recipe because it can be made in advance and is fantastic (I've made it perhaps 15 times). The only thing I always do is skim off all the accumulated fat from the top of the pot directly after braising before proceeding.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe many times - the sauce is addicting! This is my son's favorite meal of all time. To save some mess and get rid of a lot of fat instead of browning, sprinkle ribs with salt & pepper, roast in 450 oven for 45 min. - then drain all liquid and roast for another 15 min. Deglaze roasting pan with the wine and proceed with recipe as usual. Enjoy!

This dish is really delicious. Wonderful for a group because it feeds alot and can be prepared in advance. I cooked the ribs and then froze it. It warmed up beautifully! When it cooled, and before I froze it, I scraped off the layer of fat as others had noted. A real crowd pleaser

wanted to REALLY LOVE this recipe. followed the recipe as written. the flavours just didn't do it for me. the technique is a pretty standard braise, yet the sweet taste was much too prominent for my taste. not even anything new to learn from the technique or spicings. REALLY wanted to like this recipe....but..........i am sure that there are better out there.

Rating: 3
WOW! Deserves four stars, except I'm morally opposed to that. This is the best braised dish I have ever made. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except that I reduced the red wine and port a bit before adding the remaining ingredients, I strained and defatted the sauce before thickening it, and then I rewarmed it the next day before serving it. Finally, I added a handful of french, green olives in the last few minutes of cooking. Served over soft polenta with parmesean and spinach on the side. Great.

Rating: 4
Terrific and easy recipe! The honey, port and vinegar makes a great flavor combination. The only thing I would do differently is to strain the sauce before reducing it for the final time. The veggies have lost all flavor at that point, so just get rid of them!!

Rating: 4
This is even better the second day. I served it in a bowl with wide egg noodles, topped with the spinach, and then topped with the meat and sauce (I didn't thicken the sauce w/flour and it was fine for us). The meat fell off the bones, so I spooned the bones out and it was more like a goulash. My husband loved this, too. It' best to chill the sauce ahead of time and remove the fat before warming up again.

The flavor was awesome and the smell of the house alone makes it worth making, but I thought I might need an angioplasty after eating it. I will definately take the advice on making it a day ahead to strain the fat when I make it next time, and I WILL try it again.

Wow - this is delicious! The sauce had a complex, incredible flavor. Since my ribs fell off the bone, I wanted to remove the remaining piece of 'cartilage' before plating the dish. The meat fell apart even more at that point, so the resulting dish had more of a stew-like appearance. (Which was okay, since it was just for hubby and me.) Because other cooks mentioned the dish produced a lot of fat, I strained the sauce into one of those fat-separating devices which let me remove almost 1/3 cup of fat! I plan to make this again with brisket or some other cut of meat that needs a long braise.

This is definately one of the most flavourful beef dishes I've ever prepared. I followed the recipe except substituted balsamic vinegar. There is some preparation time involved but once its in the oven you don't have to fuss with it. A wonderful, hearty Sunday dinner, I've made it at least three times in the last couple of months.The sauce is delicious and this dish is even better reheated the next day.

Rating: 4
Very good and fairly easy to make, although it takes a lot of time start to finish. The result is surprisingly sweet so I'd recommend reasonable amounts of salt. Next time I will actually bake it for 2.5 hours for even more tenderness. This is a rather high-fat dish, even after refrigerating the sauce and removing the fat solids. I will try it with a leaner cut of beef in the future.

I also strained the sauce and lifted off the refrigerated fat the next day before reheating. Red wine worked well in place of the port, too. Bless the creator of this recipe...it is divine!

This is simply wonderful. Previous reviews really helped me. The only way to make this is to do it one day before. I put ribs in one container, liquids in another and stored in frig overnight. That allowed for easy removal of the layer of fat the next day. The flavors are just out-of-this-world.

Add my voice to the chorus--this dish is simply sensational. I made it three weeks ago, and my friends are STILL talking about it! The meat is so tender it melts in your mouth, and the flavor is rich and perfectly balanced--your eyes will spontaneously roll back in your head. Making it a day ahead and refrigerating is a must--not trying to gross anyone out, but I scraped almost a full cup of solid fat off the top the next day. I started with a goat cheese salad, served horseradish mashed potatoes alongside, and made extra spinach--it looks wonderful on the plate. Thanks, Alex!

Very tasty recipe and nice sauce. However, I was surprised at the amount of fat on the top when I uncovered the pot in the oven after an hour. I strained the sauce and put it through a "gravy" fat seperator. You could also do what others suggested and make it a day ahead and skim the fat off the top after refrigerating. Be sure to coarsely chop the vegetables (if too small there won't be much left since they are cooked so long) and also use a very large pot!!

These ribs were incredibly tender, and the sauce was silky with some wonderful layering of flavors. I used boneless ribs and let them sit overnight, which really did, in the words of a previous reviewer, set up the flavor. I will definitely make this again.

The flavor is wonderful! When I took it from the oven, I removed the vegetables and meat. I let the meat fall off the bones, and discarded the chunks of fat. I chilled the sauce, and removed the surface fat. That took about an hour. Use your biggest pot!

one of the best meals I've ever had-- let alone made! I used boneless beef shortribs; thought I had garlic--didn't--so I used garlic powder. The sauce was awesome. I DID strain it, though. I froze the leftover sauce and used it on meatloaf the following week.

Outstanding!! The extra work is worth it. Great the next day. As with many recipes, the flavor "sets up" over night. If you want to cut down on the fat, chill over night, remove the fat on top and reheat.
