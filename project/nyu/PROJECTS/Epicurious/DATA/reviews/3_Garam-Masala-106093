I agree with the cook from San Francisco. Madaher Jaffrey's recipie for garam masala is at least 15 seasonings long. That was the first I tasted and will forever have a longing for it.

This recipe is very aromatic with cardamom, and perfect for Moghul style dishes such as the baked rice it is used in. The other reviewer completely misunderstands garam masala. Garam does indeed translate as "warm" or "hot", but it does not mean hot in the way that we think of chilies as hot. It is the heat that a food item produces within the body (Hot foods/cold foods as found in Indian, Chinese and Persian traditional medicines). Chilies are not "hot"- they are pungent- and chilies are, technically, classified as a "cooling" food. The classic garam masala is meant to be based cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves- next in line would be black pepper. It is its fragrance that is meant to enhance foods. However, there are regional variations and blends that do contain coriander, chilies, etc., but those blends would not be the proper choice for the baked rice.

This recipe for garam masala is very incomplete. We're been making garam masala at home for years. While the proportions of the ingredients may vary from one household to another...some basic spices left out in this recipe include coriander seeds, whole red chillies and black cardamom pods. The quantity of cardamom seeds is grossly large in proportion to the remaining ingredients. This garam masala will have a very strong cardamom flavor. The word "garam" literally translates as "hot". The spice mix typically has ingredients which lend a different heat. For example black pepper is felt at the back of the throat, the heat from red chillies is felt towards the middle of the tongue, etc.
