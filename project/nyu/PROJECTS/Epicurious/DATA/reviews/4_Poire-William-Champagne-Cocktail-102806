Excellent champagne cocktail! I have made this in the fall and winter for several special occasions and everyone loves it.

This is a great cocktail -- I actually omitted the sugar and used a high-quality canned pear. Dropped a couple of paper-thin slices in each glass, added about 1.5 tsp of Poire William and champagne. Also served a Kir Royale and a couple other champage cocktails, and everyone felt this was the best one.

This was a delicious cocktail. I served it before a dinner highlighting winter squashes. It can be sweet if you don't measure the syrup and just pour it into the glass. An elegant and unusual aperitif.
