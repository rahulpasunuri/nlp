I made this gluten-free/dairy-free with tofu cream cheese, all cornstarch and a little xantham gum, it puffed up beautifully and was delicious. I put just a little sugar and some toasted pecans in the pears, followed the recipe otherwise and didn't think it was too sweet. Will definitely make again and try some variations.

I made a reduced recipe (to two servings) and the souffles didn't fluff...so not sure if that affected it. The flavor was great and it was good with the pears too. I'd give it another shot.

My kids (age 7 & 11) loved this. I cut back on the sugar as suggested by others. A nice change up to breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday morning.

This was excellent. I accidentally forgot to add the sugar to the souffles, but it worked out great...would have been too sweet. Next time I am going to add walnuts or pecans to the pears, and try it with marscapone instead of cream cheese. Definately a keeper!

This is elegant and tasty, but SWEET. I served it as a main breakfast dish and found that we needed alot of coffee, tea, and toast to wash-down the sugar.

It's really good. I've made it several times now and always to rave reviews

My husband--Mr. Stoic--exclaimed, "My lord, this is one of the finest things I have ever tried. Wow!" I found it to be fast and easy and an impressive dish. It would also make a great desert. Note that I made it with apples, which was also very good.

I probably tried this under the wrong circumstantces ( I'd planned something else & then found out the night before that a guest was allergic to bananas). Anyway, the pears were FABULOUS! The souffle left a good deal to be desired..kinda blah. My dad kept saying that it tasted like bread pudding, but I gotta say I wasn't impressed.
