I am half Italian... and this is my favorite pasta I've made. Start with *good* ingredients: fresh eggs from the farmer's market; a mixture of cake & all-purpose flour, if available. The bright yolks made this a very yellow pasta, which I *loved*. I mixed it by hand using the egg-well-in-flour-volcano method.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times, and it's always been perfect. I have also frozen uncooked portions with success. I just move it directly from the freezer to boiling water about five minutes before I want to eat it...doesn't get much easier than that!

Perfect. I used a very basic hand- cranked pasta machine and had no problems. I will definitely make this recipe again; it's a keeper. Using a wooden pasta drying rack is fun and works very well.

This was very easy and tasted great! I rolled and cut it by hand with no problems. It gave the dish a rustic feel. I will make this again!!

I just made this pasta for the beet ravioli recipe on this site. I don't own a pasta machine, so I tried my best to roll it out thinly. Either I didn't roll it out enough (I tried!!) or I messed something else up, because the end result was very thick and tough. Any thoughts? I've never made homemade pasta before, so I could really use some tips!

This is a great, suprisingly easy, fun recipe. Two things: a. a pasta machine is not needed, just roll finely and cut. b. I used this recipe to make a tortelline. For the filling, mix two eggs with any amount/type of cheese (i recommend mozzerella), and a dollop of pesto sauce. cut the dough from the first step in half and roll each half finely. then put evenly spaced small dollops of the filling on one half of the dough, put the other half on top, and cut into squares with a pizza roller. cinch the edges with the tines of a fork, then boil as you would normally. It's delicious!

Delicious. I've made this recipe many times...sometimes with sauce, sometimes in soup and sometimes just with butter and a sprinkling of pecorino. I don't have a pasta machine, but the dough is still easy enough to roll and cut by hand.

Straightforward and tasty. Good with herbs blended in, too (I've used dried basil, crushed red peppers, sage). The first time I made it I thought I could get away with not letting it sit as long, and that failed. Completely. Using fresh pasta really made my dish taste better - the noodles absorbed the flavor of the sauce so much more. Everyone at dinner loved it.

What a flavor! Just great. I used 2 cups all purpose flour and 3/4 cup of whole wheat. Our kids just plowed the whole batch with butter. I can't believe I waited this long to make my own.

This was my first time making pasta, with a new machine, and I was a bit hesitant to try. However, this recipe was simple, easy to follow and foolproof! The dough is quite firm at the onset, but becomes more pliable and easy to work with once it rests. I had no problems with sticking or tearing throughout the process. It cooks quickly and has a perfect, firm but tender bite. Even the cooked leftovers maintained their texture w/o getting soggy or clumpy. I'll look no further! I have a recipe I can use again confidently. Serves about 4-6 main course.

the easiest way to make pasta...ever!!! I added a few herbs while mixing the ingredients for extra flavor.
