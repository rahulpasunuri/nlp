LOVED this RECIPE!!! The caveat is that we did not use the 2 jalepenos....it didn't sound great to us. Instead we used two poblano's, two banana peppers and one habenero (all were de-seeded and de-veined) roasted. Otherwise we followed the recipe exactly and we thought it was actually a "Fresh" chili! Even my husband who doesn't like green chili, loved this recipe. TRY IT!!

Fresh and delicious... my new favorite chili recipe!

This chili recipe is an absolute winner! I was bold and decided to make this for Super Bowl Sunday and I am so thankful it turned out fantastic! I followed the recipe and the suggestion of others and used a sweet onion instead of a white onion as that is what I had on hand. In addition, I used olive oil instead of veggie oil (my preference) and added a can of drained and rinsed black beans and diced tomatoes. I didn't have much fat to drain off so I didn't drain at all, as the fat from the pork gave it flavor. I will definitely be making this again soon! Excellent flavor, cheap ingredients, and happy tummies (my one year old loved it too)in my house!

I made this for book club and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as written. The only downside was that it does not look appetizing. The color is a bland gray/brown. Next time I would add something to give it a little color.

Always delicious. Wanted to stretch the serving size this time, so I made a heartier version with the addition of a diced zucchini and bunch of kale. Just increased the amount of broth, posole, and cumin and added a poblano and two banana peppers I found at the farmers market. A good variation that complemented the star flavor combo of posole and pork.

this is a go to favorite! we have occasionally substituted veggie crumbles in place of meat and i double the hominy.

Rating: 4
I too substituted canned green (mild) chilis and added only a tablespoon of jalapeno; I also added a 1/4 cup of tomatillo salsa for a little variety. Also substituted cubed pork for meat. What I really like about this recipe is that the core flavors are good and savory and you can easily adjust to suit what you have in the fridge and your household's appetite for heat.

We love this recipe; it is simple, delicious and versatile. After trying it once exactly as written, the next time I added corn and an extra clove of garlic to the puree, and just for fun threw in a can of black beans when I returned the pork to the pot. I've also used pinto and kidney beans. I serve it with cornbread and slices of salted avocado. On a side note, the pork didn't render a lot of fat (less than a tablespoon) so I didn't have to pour off any.

This is a keeper - it is a simple recipe with heat and depth. The hominy is great in it and it has a real pork flavour. Lovely as it is! We've made it twice now and will make it again

I still have the pot simmering on the stove, but my first taste of this was delicious! I ground my own pork from a loin that I had in the freezer. I already know that I will make this again.

I've been using Epicurious for about 9 years and have never posted a review, but after this disappointing recipe I had to add my two cents. I can't figure out why there are so many rave reviews - this was basically just some ground pork and hominy floating around in vaguely- spiced chicken broth. When I stirred everything together in the pot it looked so bland and boring that I double-checked the recipe to make sure I hadn't forgotten an ingredient. Easy prep, but I will not be making again.

Rating: 4
Every time i make this recipe i find I can't stop eating it. Truly amazing and surprisingly different. One of my favorites. Not to complain, but why do people leave reviews with 2 stars for a recipe they've altered. No one wants to read about you excluding half the ingredients and then bashing the meal. Annoying and disturbing.

Rating: 4
This was excellent and super quick and easy. The hominy helped give it a nice mexican flavor, which we've been missing since leaving San Diego. My husband used a spatula to get every least drop out of the pan. I probably used about half as much oil: there was none in the pan after I cooked the pork, and so I added a tablespoon of bacon fat and no extra vegetable oil.

The whole family loved this dish. Simple, easy and so delicious. Making it again tonight.

Rating: 2
I made this with a few minor changes. Added a small can of green chilis to the blender, used habanero sauce instead of jalapenos and added lime juice. It did seem a bit greasy so next time I'd drain off all of the pork fat and use less oil. Actually, I'd probably use shredded pork instead of ground because it seemed rather odd to me. Good recipe in a pinch since the ingredients are generally in my kitchen already.

Rating: 3
An easy and tasty green chili with a lighter broth than most green chilis. Nice for a weeknight meal with a green salad. The pork flavor is quite prominent, so I wouldn't substitute turkey. I removed most of the seeds from the jalapenos and it was plenty spicy.

Rating: 4
LOVE THIS DISH! I made it when it first was published in 2007 and burned myself badly when it splattered. Even after that I decided it was worth it. My children aren't big fans of spicy food, but they love this. We made it less spicy once and they all agreed that it wasn't as good; it lost something without the heat. It is everyone's favorite chili in our house and we make it frequently. YUM!!!

Rating: 3
Great, quick green chili. I note, however, that prepared as is, it's a little spicier than I expected for my kids--and they're used to some spice, especially Mexican and Thai foods. So, tonight, a little sour cream, and next time, for kids, only one jalapeno (but the adults will miss it :)

Rating: 3
So simple and delicious. I had all the ingredients on hand, except the pork so I substituted some Yves Meatless Ground Turkey. I used serrano chiles instead of jalapenos and used only a few tablespoons of oil. Even with these substitutions my family raved and I'll for sure be revisiting this recipe!

Rating: 3
I've been wanting to make this ever since I got the magazine in January - it was worth the wait. Delicious and fast. I used a panela cheese instead of queso fresco, which made it saltier but still good. Otherwise made as written - will probably cut back on the amount of oil, and use ground turkey, next time.

This was so easy and very good. I might substitute shredded pork instead of ground pork next time, it did seem a little Hamburger-Helper-ish, but tasted great!

Rating: 4
We loved this recipe. We like all kinds of chili and this one was no exception. I was surprised at just how easy to prepare and yet satisfying this meal was. I had not tried hominy before, but it was a delightful, chewy alternative to the beans that are normally in chili.

Rating: 4
My family loved this! The only modification I made was to use 1 can of white beans instead of the hominy because I didn't have any and I pureed some fresh sweet corn with the onions and jalepenos. I too wish I had doubled the recipe because there were no leftovers!

I loved this recipe. I am not a big chili eater because I do not like beans. I did love the hominy and the tast of this alternative to chile. My kids like it as well. Easy and quick and tastes great.

I'm not sure how to rate this! The flavor was really good, but it was kind of like eating a bowl of hamburger meat! Admittedly, I had more meat than the recipe called for, so I think it should have been more soupy. Tonight, I'm going to try adding tomatillos to the leftovers and see if I can make it more like chili and less like gourmet hamburger helper! One note: there was no ground pork at Trader Joe's, so I used ground turkey & breakfast chicken sausage instead. The flavor was great, and it was much healthier. Oh, and I always use gloves when handling jalepenos, because you never know when they will be hot enough to actually burn your hands (I've had it happen many times!)

Rating: 4
We really loved this, and made it exactly as it was written. It has great flavor, especially for a dish that was so simple to prepare. I made it a few months ago and am craving it today, so I just decided to make it again. A definite keeper!

I love that you use your food processor to puree all the ingredients that most recipes would have you chop. Makes for a quick meal and a nice thick chili. The hominy, pumpkin seeds, and cheese on top are tasty and what makes this a recipe I will keep.

this recipe is very simple and full of flavor. i usually double it, and freeze the other half for a quick meal some other night! we also substitute unsalted tortilla chips for the pumpkin seeds when we don't have pumpkin seeds around! highly recommend to serve this to your friends!

I'd like to try this but have never seen hominy in the UK. Can anyone suggest a substitute?

I enjoyed this recipe and was very surprised to find a can of Pozole at my local supermarket! I doubled the onion and cut down on the jalapeno. One medium jalapeno was sufficient for our tastes. It didn't need any additional broth and I added about a cup of frozen corn. I had decided to do that, thinking that I wouldn't find Pozole, but when I did I added it anyway - gave it a bit more ooomph. The recipe has a good combination of flavors. I icreased the cilantro a lot and we topped it with Manchego cheese from Spain.

Rating: 3
Very tasty and unique. I think I have too much time on my hands--I ground my own very low fat pork. That was time consuming but the result is very low fat and delicious.

Rating: 3
A great, easy and tasty recipe. I used a dried New Mexico red chile, softened in a cup of boiling water, with the jalapenos and used the soaking water in the soup for extra flavor and zip. Was surprised how easy and fast this was--a variation on another posole recipe from Gourmet a few years back. This is a keeper.

Rating: 4
This was really very good. A few changes: I used a yellow spanish onion, double the amount of garlic, a whole teaspoon of cumin, and quite a bit more cilantro that I added at the end, after I took the soup off the heat, rather than in with the hominy and browned pork. It had plenty of flavor, plenty of depth, and plenty of heat (with the seeds left in one of the jalapenos). Yes, it was a bit liquid-y, but then, posole is a soup, so... there you go. What more could you want from a 10-Minute Main?

Rating: 3
Very flavorful dish. I made it as written and it needed no further flavoring outside of an extra shakeful of salt during the final minutes of cooking. I agree with the reviewer re: the extra-lean pork in California so I do think that the addition of both jalapenos is key, and getting a few seeds in the puree certainly doesn't hurt in the flavor department while not adding to much heat. My husband really enjoyed this and asked me to make it again, so it's a keeper!

Rating: 3
I though this was very good, but was honestly hoping it would pack a bigger punch. I didn't find it had any heat at all and I followed the recipe exactly. I will make this again but probably add a spicier pepper.

Rating: 3
This was tricky to rate. Bearing in mind that in CA we can buy ground pork that is very lean, this came out spicy/warm, but didn't have much depth of flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, because I can't sympathize with reviewers who say "I used one jalapeno" and then complain it didn't have enough flavor. My primary complaint is that it turned out too liquid-ey. It was certainly spicy, and my husband loved it. I served it topped with chopped fresh tomato and shredded aged white Vermont cheddar. Final judgment: very fresh tasting, good heat from the jalapenos, not much depth, a simple and easy dish worth making. Next time I'll try adding a little minced bacon to it.

This was really delicious. I liked it so much that I made it a second time. I followed the recipe as written both times and thought the flavor was terrific - nice heat, good complexity of nice bright flavors. I am really surprised to see the negative reviews. I don't think they were eating the same result that we enjoyed.

Rating: 2
One jalepeno and a dash of cumin was not enough to give this dish any dimension. I ended up throwing in some avocado slices and hotsauce which helped. After a few bites we were full(it's a rather heavy, fatty dish) but not satisfied.

Dear London- "pozole" is a type of spicy pork stew (more of a soup consistency) popular in Mexico - Hominy is a type of corn kernel that is soaked in liquid until it expands - it's white and soft is found often found in Menudo - another Mexican soup. You can find it canned in places that sell Latin foods.

I've never heard of hominy or pozole. Can anyone tell me what it is please?

Rating: 1
I thought this dish was way too rich. Perhaps cooking it in water instead of chicken broth would cut back on the fatty taste? I used one large jalapeno and it wasn't enough heat. There are better pozole recipes out there.

This was a nice change of pace, but needed a little adjustment. I blended some green pepper with the onion, etc and sauted the onion mix with a few chunks of green chili. At the same time, I took a large tomatillo, removed the husk, washed and cut it in half, turned the cut side down on some foil and lightly blackened the tomatillo in the broiler for about 7 minutes. By the time that was done, everything else was almost ready to go in the pot. So, I blended the tomatillo--skin and all--and added it to the mix. Served with cilantro and white cheddar. Pretty darned good.

We ended up giving this to the dogs. I followed the recipe as written. It was bland with a little heat. Might be better w/pork cubes and lots more herbs and spices but then it would be a different recipe.

Rating: 3
We liked this recipe a lot. I used two jalopenos, but only used the seeds from one--and it was plenty hot. (We like heat, too, so these may have been unusually strong jalopenos.)I could only find a giant can of hominy, so I'm making real posole this week to use up the rest. I hope it tastes as good as this!

Rating: 3
We really enjoyed this dish. I even left the seeds out of the jalapeno and thought that it was plenty "hot". I topped it with crumbled manchego cheese and the pumpkin seeds and a little extra salt and it was not bland at all. I had one bowl leftover for lunch today and with a squeeze of lime..... it was even better. Will do again for sure. I love hominy and the ease of the dish.

Rating: 3
I just finished a bowl of this, and I thought it was fantastic. I'm not sure why some have found it bland. I made it exactly as written, though I did use regular chicken broth instead of low sodium. Do puree the onions, etc. The flavor blended nicely. Also, great tip on the lime; it really did make the final product zing. Topped with cheddar, as that's all I had.

Rating: 1
This dish was really disappointing. I don't consider jalapeno to be the same as "green chili" so I added a can of Hatch green chili to the dish thinking it would improve the taste. If you do this, I don't suggest cutting back on the Jalapeno or using mild green chili because it ended up bland. Dish may have been salvagable but it was not to my liking at all.

Rating: 4
Wished we had made double the recipe. This makes 4 portions but we would have loved to have had left overs. Miles easier than authentic pozole but nearly as satisfying. Served it with lime wedges and diced avocado as well as tostadas. Queso Fresco would have been wonderful but not available here.

I loved this, BUT: I used pork stew meat in cubes. I used extra broth as well, making it a brothy stew that was full of flavor.

I can't understand the rave reviews. I made it as written, and I know my way around a kitchen. Very strange recipe. Hot but bland. To salvage it, I added more garlic and cumin, some oregano, and tossed in a jar of salsa verde. It helped. Next time, I'd rather use the time-honored methods of sauteeing the vegetables and spices, rather than pureeing them raw in a blender.

Rating: 4
This was extremely easy and got many raves. I also toasted/popped the pumpkin seeds, added some cubed left over roast pork, and used sour cream because queso fresco is not available here. I will try the squeeze of lime next time - sounds just right.

This was quick, easy, and delicious. It's a good heary meal in half an hour. I served mine with a splash of lime on top of each serving, sprinkled with chives and cheese. It recieved rave reviews. The only thing I'll do different next time is double the recipe so there are leftovers.

This had a great balance of flavors, I used sweet pork sausage which worked well. Definitely a keeper and really quick!

I will definitely make this again. Though - there are more like 2-3 servings if it is a main course. I would suggest serving with lime wedges, the flavor would be enhanced with a hint of lime!

Excellent! I added two cored tomatillos to the blender mix, and toasted the pumpkin seeds in a dry skillet but loved the tastes, texture and ease of preperation.
