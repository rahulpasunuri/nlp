Complex and satisfying! Agree with kellys714 about skipping the steaming step. Also, as far, as portion sizes - the recipe really works out to 4 serving sizes, and there'll probably still be room for desert :) Also, it's much easier to divide it up among four plates, with each getting half of the fish, and still maintaining the beautiful presentation.

Having recently returned from a trip to Thailand, I thought I'd try this recipe - it is wonderful! I substituted anise seeds for the star anise, and lime peel for the kaffir lime leaves. I am making this again for a dinner party, and will omit the step of steaming the pork - I will just cut it into the 1/2' pieces before sauteing it, as it seemed to be a tad overcooked with both steaming and sauteing. Wonderful mix of flavors in this dish!

This dish rocks. The flavors are outstanding, and it is worth the effort of locating the wide range of ingredients. Most of the work can be done in advance, however, making it a good choice for entertaining. I will definitely make this again.
