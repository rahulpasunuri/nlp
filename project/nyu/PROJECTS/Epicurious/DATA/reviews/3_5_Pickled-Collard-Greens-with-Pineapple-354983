I set a bowl of this in the fridge and my husband and I warily eyed it for probably far too long. That's the joy of pickling though, it keeps! Finally I pulled it out and tried it with whole grain bread that I fried in canola oil and salt. So delicious! My first thought was "this is better than ketchup!" On a hot summer day it is the perfect light meal. I should probably note that I skipped the cayenne due to a personal allergy.

I like sour but this was a little too pungent even for me. I really like where it is GOING though- Next time I think I would add a teensy bit of olive oil and replace some of the vinegar with juice, and up the amount of pineapple. Could use another layer of flavor too- something else sautéed along with the onion, or another herb.

This was good. DEF needs the pineapple to mellow it out. Kind of sour. I made a rice pilaf with it and when the rice was mixed with the greens it tasted much better. It wasn't a bad taste, just super soury. Family ate it and liked it though.

Pretty good and unusual. Nice that it could be made in advance. But that amount of greens is a lot to clean!!!
