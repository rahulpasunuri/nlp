This is a really great recipe when you need something quick and simple. I have made it several times as is and another time altering it, which was amazing. Saute the onion in butter in a medium pan. add cubed potato, season with thyme and salt. In a separate pan cook the peas in chicken broth. When the peas are done, drain but keep aside about a tablespoon of the broth. Combine the peas with the potato and onion along with the tbs of chicken broth. Enjoy!

My mother used to make it and add the small macaroni to it, Like elbows. It was a staple in our home

Served these peas for a dinner party and got rave reviews. Very simple, but tastes like you did a lot more.

Loved this simple and delicious recipe. You have to love peas or don't make it.
