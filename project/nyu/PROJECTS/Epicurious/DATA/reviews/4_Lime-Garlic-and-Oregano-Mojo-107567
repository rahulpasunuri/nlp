Used some to marinate and some as a sauce for grilled chicken.

I used this as a marinade for elk roast and it turned out pretty good, but it was absolutely delicious marinating some quail before grilling.

Outstanding for Christmas dinner! I marinated a boneless leg of lamb in this; then while the lamb was roasting, I simmered it to use as a sauce. It was delicious! Definitely a gold star meal.

Great marinade for either grilling or slow cooking. I've used this recipe several times and everyone loves it!

I served this with roast pork loin and Cuban black beans and rice. My dinner guests couldn't stop raving. They put it on the meat, the beans and rice, and I think they would have slurped it right out of the serving bowl if they thought they could get away with it! It's perfect for entertaining since you can make it so far in advance, but even if you make it the same day it's no problem because it's so quick and simple.
