absolutely delicious bread! Incredibly easy to make. Great with smoked salmon & herb butter. Makes wonderful toast.

Bread came out nicely. I did not particularly care for the flavor of the honey in this type of bread. Overwhelmed/detracted from the dill flavor.

This was the best bread so far without useing yeast. It's very easy & absolutely delicious. I put dry dill weeds instead of dill seeds. It worked really great! I'll try to make it with dill seeds next time. You must try it, and then won't regret it.
