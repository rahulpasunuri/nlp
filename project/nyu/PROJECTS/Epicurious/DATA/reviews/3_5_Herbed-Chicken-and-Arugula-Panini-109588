I was looking for a quick and easy chicken sandwich idea for lunch and was lucky to stumble on this recipe. I happened to have most everything in my kitchen. I did have to substitute romaine lettuce for the arugula (good, but recommend the arugula) and had regular sandwich bread toasted. I tempered the sweetness of the sauce by exchanging one TBSP of the fig balsamic vinegar I had with one of sherry vinegar. I also swapped the red onion for sweet onion that I sweated in a pan before topping the sandwiches with it. Soaked the bread with the sauce and LOVED it. This makes for an easy lunch that tastes like it came from a high end restaurant. Simple, healthy, and good! Mmm mm mm. This will become a staple in our house.

Nice but not exceptional. Good for a fast weeknight light dinner. That said I'm not sure I'd make this again; there are plenty of other compelling recipes out there.

I wasn't blown away by this dish. It was pretty dry overall, having no cheese, mayo or other oil-based food to compensate for the moisture the bread soaks up. Also, this recipe doesn't call for the sandwich to get pressed or grilled, so the word "panini" in the title is misleading.

I served the chicken on ciabatta. It was good, but wow, what a mess that amount of oil made! I would cut way back on the oil for next time. The sauce was nicely sweet.

I love this panini and have made it three times - tonight wil be the fourth. If I can't find a fresh olive bread I slice Kalamatta olives, about three per sandwich, and sprinkle them on inside the sandwich. Also, I love to add very thinly sliced red onion - it adds a great crunch, and a slice of smoked provolone. I too always cook the sandwich. I don't have a panini maker so I butter my ridged grill pan, then brush the outside of the sandwich with garlic olive oil. I secure the whole sandwich with two extra lonog toothpicks so it doesn't fall apart, then break off the tooth pick right above the sandwich so the grill pan will sit level, then I put a large fry pan on top of the sandwich and weight it down with a can. I cook over med-high heat for about two min then turn. I am careful not to upset the sandwich then remove the toothpicks here. Once the cheese is melted the sandwich sticks together. I also agree with a previous reviewer that the arugula is essential - it's messy at first getting it to stay on but it adds just the right note of green & peppery flavor. The balsamic vinegar dressing is fabulous and I usually double the recipie. It makes a great panini whichever bread you use. Tonight I'm using La Brea Bakery chibatta - slightly crusty with a soft interior, or I use Trader Joe's panini rolls and pull out some of the interior bread to lessen the denseness. Great recipie!! Life partner always licks his plate. Me too!

Another fabulous recipe. The only thing I did different was I used a raspberry balsamic vinegar, it had wonderful flavor, I put the sandwich in a panini maker, delicious!! Don't leave out the arugula, it makes it.

This chicken is filled with flavor. Like another reviewer, we also pressed our sandwiches when we made them, and it definitely gave it that extra oomph. The chicken is good enough to have on its own. We will definitely be making this again!

This was a very quick, very easy, yet surprisingly tasty dinner (accompanied by soup). The directions were great - for once I didn't overcook my chicken breasts. I didn't have fresh thyme so I just sprinkled on some dried oregano and basil leaves instead (along with the salt and pepper) and it worked out great. Maybe a little sundried tomato next time for the heck of it?

This was delicious. I made it just as the recipe suggested, although I pressed it in my Krups panini maker from Williams-Sonoma to give it some crunch. I used soft Italian rolls and the panini maker made them so crispy. I think that really added to this sandwich. YUM!

This turned a simple soup and sandwich supper into a favorite meal.
