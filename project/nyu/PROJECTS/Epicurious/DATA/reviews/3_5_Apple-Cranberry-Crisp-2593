This is a good basic crisp recipe - the fresh cranberries were delicious,and everyone enjoyed the dish. I thought the flour added to the fruit resulted in a somewhat gummy texture. Next time I'll try corn starch or arrowroot.

I am so thrilled with this recipe (halved), I've made it three times in the last several weeks. First for lunch with a friend (her husband adored the leftovers, for a potluck at work wherein the recipe was requested, and then for Thanksgiving. Rave reviews every time. The tartness of the fruit crisp with the sweet creaminess of the caramel sauce is a perfect combo. Just be sure not to burn the sauce. I did once, and that was a mess.

I am pleased with this recipe. It will be one of the dessert options at Thanksgiving this year. I have used dark brwn sugar and added pecans and a bit more spices for addt'l flavor. Be creative. This is a good basic recipe.

So delicious! I added 1 tps cinnamon to the topping and left out the butter in the filling. I sprinkled walnuts on top during the last 10 min in the oven. Served with vanilla ice cream. Received rave reviews at my dinner party!

I make this dish over and over every holiday season. The carmel sauce makes it different than most crisps and the recipe is easy to make (which is always important for a busy working mom). Everyone always raves and asks for 2nds with this one. A real winner!

This was very good. I used light brown sugar instead of white sugar in the filling which, i think, gave the flavor some added depth. This recipe will be a standby for the fall and winter seasons.

This apple crisp came out great and was well received by my guests. I could not find Jonathan apples, so I used all Granny Smith. I increased the sugar to 1 cup in order to balance the tartness of using these apples and the dessert was not too sweet. Fresh cranberries were not yet in season, so I substituted about 1 1/2 cups of Craisins (dried, sweetened cranberries much like raisins) and it came out just fine; however by not using fresh cranberries you lose out on the flavors/juices they would produce during baking, so the result is more like just an Apple Crisp (with Craisins).

In an effort to use up a bag of fresh cranberries bought for Christmas I chose this recipe because it sounded quick and easy. Preparing the apples was the most time consuming part. I left off the caramel sauce but may try it next time because I found it a little tart while still warm and recommended my family add ice cream. I found it delicious the next day without anything added.

I have served this time and time again with rave reviews! When I say we are having apple crisp for dessert, people always ask expectantly, "Is it the one with the caramel sauce?".

I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner and it was very well received even with all the food we had eaten! I made the caramel sauce, but it really isn't necessary. A dollop of vanilla ice cream is a perfect accompaniment.

I made this as a desert to accompany dinner at my friends' lake house. (It followed the Smoked Sausage Cassoulet). The response: Restaurant Quality. I made it without the carmel sauce and it was pleasingly tart.
