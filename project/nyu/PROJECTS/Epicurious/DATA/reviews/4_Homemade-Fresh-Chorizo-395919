I made this for a dinner party, along with the chicken and shrimp fillings. The chorizo was the first to go. Will definitely make this again.

not a big chorizo fan, but when I saw this homemade recipe, I thought why not try. Made 2 of the other taco fillings and the tortillas in this issue. Tortillas were definitely the key! If you don't have a press, use bottom of a pie plate to smash, then use rolling pin to thin out. I like knowing what goes in my chorizo, so I enjoyed this recipe. I didn't go to store for chiles, so used my ancho chile powder. Was still good, but I might try the NM chiles just to compare.

I haven`t been able to find dried New Mexico Chiles, so I used Ancho chiles. I also have stopped eating chorizo due to the high salt and fat content, so I'm very happy to be able to make my own from now on.

I've always loved chorizo but I've stopped eating it recently because of the high salt content. Now that I can make it myself, I'll be making it all the time. I've made two batches of it already!

never write reviews. ever. this recipe was awesome, don't always lve chorizo- always seems a bit greasy=ew for me, this homemade version wowed and was just as good left over in eggs the next day. We made the ENTIRE "tacos tacos tacos' section of this bon appetit to EXACT recipes. - would highly reccommend this chorizo, could add heat to taste, the 'fresh corn tortillas'- lickity lip sick, and the 'rajas poblanas'- still salavating. these three were the best serve with suggested simple toppings, guac and such. rock n roll. mm.
