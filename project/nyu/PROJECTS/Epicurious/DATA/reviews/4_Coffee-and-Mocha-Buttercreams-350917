This is such an awesome buttercream recipe as most don't require to make the syrup, which really makes a huge difference. I plan on making variations to it going forward for vanilla, lemon, etc., for different cakes. I have to say, however, that if I didn't have a KitchenAid stand mixer, an All Clad double boiler, and a good candy thermometer, I wouldn't even attempt it. I can definitely see where it would be much more difficult

Made this for the 12-layer mocha cake and it was a royal PITA. I made the mistake of reducing the sticks of butter down to 4 and sugar down to 3.5cups as someone suggested and it came out a bit too sweet and it became lumpy cottage cheese. Threw it out and made it again and same thing happened and ran out of ingredients for another try so I googled for "fix buttercream frosting" on youtube and found a video showing how to rescue it. You basically have to warm up the bowl a lot and let it all melt together. The negative is the buttercream won't be as smooth but it still worked well enough. I don't recommended chilling it for the next day or doing it a few days in advance though...you'll have to stick it in the mixer and go through the horrible fix the lumpy buttercream process again when you're ready to use it because it'll be too hard to spread even if you let it sit at room temp for two hours :-P

Forgot to give it the 4 forks it deserves.

This frosting is the most satiny smooth frosting ever, but I suspect it will turn out properly only if you follow the recipe exactly, because there is some chemistry involved. Also, plan on having enough time with no distractions. I followed another reviewer's tip and buttered a Pyrex measuring cup to pour my hot syrup into, then I poured it into the egg whites--much easier than maneuvering a hot pan. I used a stand mixer, putting reusable ice packs around the bowl since they are very flexible. I can't imagine how long it would take to cool the frosting without them--mine still took about 35 min. Now, onto the other layers of the mocha cake! I hope that recipe will be this good.

This is the most amazing frosting I've ever made. Incredibly silky, buttery, and light all at the same time. I didn't have problems making this and I have an old mixer on the verge of death that I got from a thrift store 6 years ago. It nearly overheated lots of times but I never mixed for more than 4-5 minutes at once and it was fine. Be sure to heat the syrup over medium heat- I missed that part of the recipe and used high heat the first time and it got to 240 degrees in just a few minutes. I redid it over medium heat and it was fine. I used a metal mixing bowl, and put it on a round metal cooling rack once I added the syrup. This allowed air flow under the bottom and everything was completely cool within 25 minutes. I actually waited about 45 minutes from the point I added the syrup to the point I started adding butter because I had to take 5 minute breaks in order to stop my mixer from overheating. This didn't seem to cause any problems. Got very minor curdling after adding 1/4 or so of the butter, and by the time I had added about 2/3 of the butter it came together nicely. I wouldn't make this every day but don't be afraid to try it for a really special cake!

Absolutely luscious. Certainly the best frosting I've ever made, but it does take some effort. If you don't have a candy thermometer, for example, don't try it.

I'm not sure why everyone is having such trouble with this recipe. My meringue cooled after 15 minutes or so. Softened butter is necessary for the frosting to work. This recipe is a great base for Italian meringue buttercream. I've made it three different times now, the first being for the 12 layer cake and twice now as a vanilla frosting. This has become my go-to buttercream.

I followed everyones suggestions butter really soft put ice under the whites let them cool below room temp and added butter one T at a time but remained soupy and in the curdle state never came together or got nice and fluffy. Hesitant to try again but need an icing for the cakes

This was my first time making buttercream frosting as part of the 12 layer mocha cake. The amount of butter was a bit of a deterrent so I reduced the butter to about 3 1/2 sticks and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (1 1/4 cup in the syrup). I read a tip in the cake bible that came in handy. I buttered a glass measuring cup and poured the syrup into the measuring cup then drizzled it over the egg whites.The cooling temperature was about 30 minutes. I then added the softened butter. It curdled as the recipe mentioned but then it all came together. Even without all the butter, it was DELICIOUS! And a good amount left over!

OK, so I made the same mistake and didn't let it cool all the way, 30 minutes was NOT enough. I had gotten it to just barely warmer than room temp and thought this would be fine. Turned soupy. However, I put the bowl in the freezer for a while, stirred, back in again, till cool. Then, added the butter a T. at a time, like directions said, but instead of beating at medium I beat at high again, and this worked to get it back to fluffy and thick and not soupy. Flavoe- a bit buttery, but then again, I tend to not like buttercream frostings anyways, so I am not a good judge :)

these buttercreams were made as part of the 12 layer mocha buttercream cake, which is time consuming but a task absolutely worth the time. This was my first time making buttercreams and my first pass ended in failure. the second pass worked out nicely. Here are my notes, which come from a relatively inexperienced baker. 1. The butter has to be very soft in order for this to work. If you're pressed for time, use the microwave in 10 sec bursts-but don't try to use butter that isn't really soft. 2. After adding the sugar solution, the egg white mixture is very warm and, as noted by others, requires more than 30 minutes to cool. I placed the bowl in the refrigerator and stirred it every 5 minutes. Using a thermometer, I cooled the mixture to 72 and then returned to the mixer and started adding the butter. 3. I didn't have good luck placing ice water beneath the mixture as described in the recipe because I found it to be too cold for the butter-but others may get this to work.4. If you're making these ahead of time for a recipe and store them in a fridge, don't forget to bring them out several hours ahead of time so that they soften. In a pinch, 10-12 sec x 2 in the microwave does get the soft again...

great flavor, but agree with the rest of the comments on the time needed to cool off...30 mins is really not enough. I stuck to this and the final product ended up a little runnier than desired. still great though!

delicious! i definitely agree with other reviews on the cooling time. I stuck to the 30 mins...buttercream was holding up perfectly until i added the butter. no amount of further mixing or cooling helped get it more rigid. One other tip: do the syrup in a small saucepan. My first attempt was in a deep wide sauce pan and turned it off when it reached the right temp but w/in minutes it looked foamy; the layer of syrup as so thin that it dried up into a white foamy crystalized mess.

Butter flavor in the frosting was too overpowering, esp. in the coffee buttercream. The mocha buttercream tasted great, however, I would not use these frostings again with the 12 layer mocha cake recipe because the effect was too heavy and BUTTERy.

I have to agree with Ancaster, Ontario - this recipe is a LOT of work. It definitely took more than 30 minutes for the frosting to cool. To help the process and keep the frosting from becoming too runny, I put an ice pack around the mixing bowl. All in all, I spent about 1.5 hours on the frosting. But, the results were great. I couldn't stop eating spoons of the mocha frosting! I haven't finished making the 12 layer cake but if all else fails, we'll just eat frosting! It's so light and creamy that you almost forget how much butter you put in.

This is the best coffee buttercream I have ever used. Very easy, light and creamy. I will use this buttercream from now on.

wow! This is a bit of work but entirely worth the effort! I have never made a meringue buttercream before & was a little uncertain but it turned out beautifully, no problems at all, other than it took a heck of a lot longer than 30 min for the merangue to cool while beating. I plan to use this to ice a chocolate layer cake...can't wait! I will look for other excuses to use this in the future. Absolutley extraordinary.
