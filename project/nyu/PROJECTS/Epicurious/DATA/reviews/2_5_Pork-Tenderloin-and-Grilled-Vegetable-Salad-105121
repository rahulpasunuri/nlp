This recipe is not good. Alot of chopping fro a little flavor. Please don't waste your time on this.

I'm shocked that some cooks don't like this recipe. It's a favourite in our house. Has been for a couple of years. What's not to like? The marinade is very flavourful and the whole dish comes together as a delish main that can be enjoyed guilt-free given that it's healthy too. No substitutes needed. Just make sure to reduce the marinade. Try it.

This recipe still needs several generations to be improved. None of the flavors seemed to come together well - the marinade, the veggies, the arugula. I felt that all of the flavors were competing and none of tasted good in the end. Will not make again.

The red wine marinade was too strong even though it was marinaded less time than the recipe called for. The dressing was far to sweet and syrupy.

I've made this twice; the first time was OK, the second time was great. The key to success is that you must reduce the marinade so that you get a nice, intensely flavored syrup. It's delicious and greatly enhances the meat and vegetables. Next time, I think I'll double it.

For all of you who made this and were a little disappointed due to the blandness of the marinade, here are some possibilities: substitute ginger for rosemary and rice vinegar for red wine for an asian twist; if you want to stay with rosemary flavor, use more (like triple) and add black pepper, which enhances the rosemary flavor.

I found this dish to be fairly bland, and I didn't really like the marinade. It was an okay meal if you want to try something different, but I wouldn't make it for company.

i really enjoyed this dish. it was a great, light summer meal. i found the pork to be extremely tender. i let it marinate for about six hours. maybe adding more red pepper flakes and black pepper might give the pork more kick for the reader finding the dish bland. the grilled vegetables, tossed w/the wine sauce, were an excellent accompaniment. (i skipped the arugula.) i added rosemary-garlic roasted potatoes for a complete meal.

I was not blown away by the flavor of this marinade or sauce. I marinated the pork overnight as suggested and didn't think the meat had much flavor at all. I liked the idea of the grilled vegetables and pork together, so I might try it again and add some zip to it. Any suggestions?

The sauce was very good, but I was not impressed with the whole thing. I'm going to try it again to rule out user error. I can't wait to see what others write.
