I made this for my parents last night when dark and stormy weather put an end to our original plan to fire up the grill. I used fresh pasta, locally raised/cured pancetta, and some lovely chestnuts from my father, a great urban forager for our time. in a recipe of this nature, the quality of the ingredients is critical, and makes the difference between good and transcendent. As I had to peel my own chestnuts and grate the parmigiano-reggiano by hand, this ended up being quite the labor of love, but once the grating and chopping was complete, things really moved quite quickly. The flavors and texture were phenomenal, though I would personally decrease the chestnuts ever so slightly..just a matter of taste. As the dish is quite rich, I recommend a salad with a light vinaigrette to offer some balance. Outside of this, I served a simple dessert of crumbly almond and orange biscotti and a platter of fresh fruit along with coffee, and it was perfect. certainly not the june barbecue i intended, but very good. i will make this again and again when fall and winter arrive.

I really love this recipe. Some small tweaks... I find the cheese quantity a bit too much (I use about half) and would advise adding more as you go instead of dumping in the entire cup. I also like to replace the Parm Reg with Pecorino Romano for added complexity. Lastly, for me, the recipe works better with a smaller pasta (e.g., campanelle, conchiglie, farfalle, etc.) b/c the mixture doesn't really adhere to long pasta.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this, and have made it many times, with a few "tweaks". I don't use the chestnuts, I increase the amount of sage and increase the amount of pancetta (we love pork). I've made it with fresh pasta and dry pasta - all shapes - and all work. Sometimes I add in some chopped chicken if I want it as a main course. The flavors together are fantastic! I use only high-quality parmesean. I find that parm reggiano is too salty for this dish. Served it last night with pan seared pork chops and buttered green beans. Yum.

I thought this was really bland as is but I'm also not sure what was missing. Maybe some white wine? Or mushrooms? I think I can find better uses for chestnuts on this site than this recipe.

I found this recipe last spring and was so glad I could still find some vacuum-packed chestnuts at Trader Joe's. (The price wasn't outrageous either) By that time I already had some sage growing in my garden. The flavors are just delightful. I didn't find the pancetta to be overly fatty. I loved the addition of the fresh sage at the end, it was a nice contrast to the cooked sage. I also prepped and cooked the chestnut mixture ahead of time. It hung out on the stove off the heat until I was ready to cook the pasta and assemble everything. It's definitely a cool weather dish and now that fall has arrived I'm looking forward to enjoying it often.

The taste was good, but this recipe seemed very heavy to me. It would be good if you're in the mood for comfort food!

Rarely have I given 4 fork, but this gets it for the combination of taste and ease of preparation. I didn't add as much cheese as called for (did about 1/2), and next time I'd add a bit more sage (the stuff from the store just isn't as flavorful as what one grows), but other than that--perfect. It is really a perfect fall dish. It would be great for company: marvelous taste, easy to prepare, and much of the prep could be done ahead of time, just toss and serve at the end. Try it!

This is a wonderful and unique combination of flavors. The sweetness of the chestnuts is balanced by the saltiness of the pancetta. I used bacon, but will follow the recipe exactly next time. I cannot overstate the fabulousness of this dish: relatively easy recipe yielding an amazing level of deliciousness (except I bought unpeeled, frozen chestnuts from Trader Joes and had to peel them :( BUT , I am planning this for my daughter's birthday party.

I actually followed the recipe for once and thought it was great! My husband even said it's a repeater which isn't too frequent.

Outstanding recipe. I recommend using fresh pasta - I used fresh fettucine. To make this easy to shopt for, go to a store which will have all of: pancetta, fresh pasta, fresh sage, bottled peeled chestnuts.

Great flavors - I disagree about there being enough sauce for a whole pound of pasta, and I will double the cooked sage next time...I think the flavor of pancetta is important too.

This is delicious! We would definitely make this again but maybe using peppered bacon rather than the pancetta. The pancetta is delicious but very fatty. We boiled and peeled fresh chestnuts which worked very well. We couldn't taste the cooked sage so we rough chopped extra amounts of fresh sage to sprinkle on which made a big difference. Alsace Trimbach Gerwerztremener wine went fabulously with this dish!! Very easy, very delicious, definitley a keeper.

Made this for a dinner party, and had to go print out the recipe for ll the guests. The only problem was that I couldn't find already-roasted chestnuts, and I had to roast my own. But all I could find was a can of peeled chestnuts. The flavor could have been better.

Wonderful on a cold winter day with a glass of red wine. If you want to kick it up a notch (and who doesn't), put some fried sage leaves on top. Definately use the parsely; it brightens it a bit.

It was ok, but that may have to do w/ my choice of ingredients. Used a 12oz box of fettucine. Also had a hard time finding bottled chestnuts, so I used the roasted chestnut snacks you find in asian grocery stores. It was still pretty filling from the chestnuts, but the taste was just ok.

We liked it! I used a pound of pasta and somewhat increased the other amounts, but not the chestnuts ($11 for the bottle). By the way, I searched the supermarket and local Italian grocers for these, and finally located them at our "glorified" farm market (Lyman Orchards in Middlefield, for neighboring cooks). Product of France.

Great! Substituted Canned button mushrooms for chestnuts, but otherwise made it exactly as recipe reads and loved it. My husband is picky and he really enjoyed it. Use the Pancetta, it's worth it. Would serve to company and it's easy.

I just reread the recipe and realized I misread the pasta amount-- instead of 8oz. I cooked the whole pound. I agree with the previous reviewer-- the chestnut mixture was enough for the whole pound, although I had added a few extra chestnuts. I also used regular bacon that I had on hand instead of pancetta, and it was still terrific. My husband ate 3 bowls and ended up groaning in pain afterwards!

Very tasty - nice combination of ingredients. I thought the volume of the chestnut mixture was enough to support a pound of pasta, so that is what I cooked. Because of the increased volume, I added more sage and parsley and grated cheese onto the top of each portion.

My husband, a non-cook, made this for us for Valentine's day. It was amazing! He substituted proscuitto for pancetta, used half the chestnuts called for, and added some shitake mushrooms with the onions. So rich yet not overpowering. I will make for company.
