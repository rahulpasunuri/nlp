Excellent recipe. However, I cheated and used vanilla extract. Also, used a round, black, non-stick cake pan and then cut in wedges for a very nice presentation. Baking time was closer to 20 minutes.

Made this for Valentine's Day for husband and 2 kids (6 and 1 1/2). I loved it, but the rest of the family didn't. I have to say that I didn't do the syrup, just the cake and cream and berries. I loved the sour cream and whipped cream, you really got the sweetness of the strawberries that way... but it wasn't a crowd pleaser. The cake really turned out well, although I had to use an 8x8x2 glass pan--maybe that's why I had to bake mine almost 20 minutes. I will definitely use the cake recipe again with different accompaniments (I have a chocolate whipped cream recipe also from Epicurious that would be perfect).

i make this often for parties, except that i double the recipe and make it as a two layer 9 inch round cake and use a simple sweetened whipped cream instead, comes out great every time.

I had absolutely no trouble with the cake---they turned out remarkably spongey, eggy, soft, and sweet. Not at ALL what I've come to expect from shortcake recipes. I added the orange juice to the whipped cream (not the strawberries) and ommitted the sour cream. I ended up making it again the next day as well. The very simple cake recipe makes this dish special!

I have never heard of whipping cream and sour cream together!! I believe Serena when she said it didn't work! I have always whipped the heavy cream first and then folded in the sour cream. I think this step has been omitted from this recipe. Sheesh! trying to whip cream with sour cream, shake your head!!

I only used the cake portion of the recipe, but found it very lame. It was a bit of a pain to make and yielded a thin rubbery cake. Not worth the while

This was very good; faily simple but elegant. I used a 9-inch glas pie plate for the cake, which worked fine. Be quite generous with the soaking liquid; you can almost pour it on. The sour cream/whipping cream mixture did not whip up for me so I used regular whipped cream. Did anyone have more luck whith this step?
