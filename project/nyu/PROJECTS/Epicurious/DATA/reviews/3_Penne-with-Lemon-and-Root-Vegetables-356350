The first time I made this it was delicious. The second time I was a little fast and loose with the directions and I really screwed it up. So be careful, follow directions, love your veggies, and you'll have something great. Otherwise you'll end up with pathetic leftovers.

I did not like the flavor at all. We ended up with PBandJ for dinner. The kids wouldn't touch it.

I didn't have any celery so I used celery root, sweet potato, carrots and one beet. I also used vegetable stock instead of water and I cut out the second simmer period so my vegetables did not over cook. I added cilantro to replace the celery leaves. It was a wonderful easy supper, to use my husbands words it had "a delightful and unusual flavour."

I used turnips, carrots and beets that I had knowing that the dish would turn pink and was pleasantly surprised that it was a lovely orange color. The flavor was unique and delicious. My husband went back for seconds!

This recipe was incredibly bland. It tasted like someone had taken all the good stuff out of chicken noodle soup and then used the remains to make this. Barely tasted the lemon or garlic, and the nutmeg was a little too strong. Vegetables were mushy and the pasta bites were just plain pasta, no flavor. I was so disappointed.

Mmmm....I went back for thirds. The nutmeg/salt/lemon zest is a nice flavor combination. The first time I made it per the directions. The second time I made it with a chopped up sweet potato, colorful carrots and only one red beet that turned things a little red, but not too red, and a zucchini in place of the celery (it's what I had). This is one of those great flexible recipes that really just gives you an insight into a nice way to cook with pasta and winter veggies.

I thought this was terrific! Light, healthy, easy and delish! I had an abundance of parsnips, carrots and celery from our CSA box so kept it simple. I will definitely make it again!

I used orecciette instead of penne, and cut the veggies into discs. Wonderful flavor with a light taste. Great with a fish.

This was okay. We had it tonight, and it was okay. I wanted to like it... I really did, but it just wasn't up there with our favorite meals.

I decided not to use celery and ended up using a red beet, which was a total mistake. Everything turned a deep purple. I will consider making this again but will be sure to include only golden beets, will add celery root, and will cut down on the nutmeg. I thought there was a bit too much and it made for a rather overpowering flavor which didn't quite mesh with the lemon peel.

Truly delicious dish. Used it as a hearty side to compliment a dijon/breaded chicken recipe also from this site. I was a little cautious at first, but it totally blew me away. This one's a keeper. hint: add a little more lemon zest than the tablespoon it calls for and the flavors will just pop!

Loved this dish. Omitted the nutmeg (better left to cookies) and increased the lemon zest a little. Parsnips, carrots, butternut squash and beets were perfect. Will add celery root next time as previous reviewer suggested.

here's the deal, use celery root, parsnips and carrots, not beets. the celery root breaks down and thickens the sauce while the parsnips and carrots cook at the same rate. it's delicious and hearty while being more healthy with a ratio of 50% veggies to 50% pasta and only one tablespoon of oil

I thought this dish just tasted like wet celery. The vegetables had little to no taste, and the nutmeg, Parmesan and lemon zest were drowned out by the overwhelming celery taste. I like celery but this was dish was too bland.

I used striped Chioggia beets instead of golden, which added a nice deep colour without dying the rest of the dish red. Like lixandra19, I'll make it again, but will probably tweek the amounts a bit probably by increasing the lemon zest, Parmesan, and nutmeg.

Great vegetarian recipe if you like nutmeg and root vegetables. We used beets instead of golden beets - came out great (very red but great). We'll do it again, but add more lemon zest. Next time might add some Tabasco or Crystal to spice it up.
