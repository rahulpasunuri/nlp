Personally I liked this recipe but I didn't get rave reviews from my guests. Perhaps this one is more of a personal preference recipe.

I absolutely love this recipe. I have made it several times and it is always a hit. Even my brother, who hates raw onions and cucumbers loved it. I'm making it again this weekend. I've passed this recipe onto many others and it's hugely popular. It is a little labor intensive but definitely worth it.

Wasnt crazy about having to chop so much stuff but was worth it. I did puree the whole 5 cups, and maybe another cup because it was all chunk and not enuf soup. Did still have lots of melon pieces as well. Gotta love it that those bitter inside stalks of celery have a purpose! I love cold summer soups but still trying to convert the hubby to the whole idea. Refreshing, crunchy, savory and sweet. What isnt to love? Grilled thick slabs of sourdough brushed w/olive oil to go with.

We love this dish! The sweetness of the watermelon and the mint are a wonderful twist on the classic. It's fresh and cooling on hot summer days. I skip the celery because I don't like it - otherwise, I make it just as it is!

I made this for mother's day and it was a huge hit. I did make a few changes though. I didn't add the celery, mint or lime juice and added tabasco instead of the jalepeno. I wound up having such a chunky soup, I actually had to add more pureed watermelon, but it tasted great. Lots of chopping, because I don't like the way the peppers come out when I chop them in the processor but other than that, I would definitely make it again!! It's already really hot here so it was really refreshing!

Made this soup this summer for my parents in the desert. It was fast and simple to make and chilled while we were in the pool. I blended a couple handfuls of the other veggies with some watermelon, which worked nicely. And I omitted mint per request and just added it minced to a side of sour cream. Big hit and surprisingly satisfying.

I made this the other night, it was FANTASTIC! Perfect for a hot night.i put about 3/4 of the ingredients into the blender though because it came out looking like salsa and I like my soup a little smoother. I also omitted the cream, but I am making this for a dinner party and I am going to top it with a cucumber foam and a little creme fresh.

Am about to make a second batch of this for a Father's Day gathering. My husband loved it! I used plenty of jalapeno, lessened the mint a bit and skipped the cream. Not too sweet, very refreshing and beautiful.

Just made this. Light, fresh and delicious. I am not a big fan of fresh mint so I used a pinch of dried. I will be making this all summer. Such a nice appetizer for entertaining outside and incredibly easy. So healthy and low in calories. Yum!

This is an AWESOME recipe! I served at a Summer birthday party with other cold hors doeuvers and it was a hit! Pour into individual shot glasses for a self-service buffet or have them passed on trays. The refreshing and light taste is fantastic. Also great with a splash of Grey Goose Vodka!

I love it! And I love the mint too! Hot, fresh, refreshing, good and good for you. Labor intensive, but.......yum

We really enjoyed this soup, because it was relatively easy, refreshing and unusual. The sweetness of the melon was paramount. I used rice wine vinegar, which has slightly less acidity than red wine vinegar, and it worked out well. Left out the celery because I thought it was superfluous. There was enough complexity using the other vegggies. Especially after a day in nearly 100 degree heat, this is a winner.

This recipe was a success! I made it the evening before a brunch and it tasted delicious the next day! I served it in tall shot glasses and got rave reviews from most guests. Not sure if the texture is good to serve in a bowl, it tends to watery because the watermelon purees down to a liquid, but in the shotglasses, it was just right! I used 1 tbs red wine vinegar and 1 tbs balsamic which balanced the sweet and savory and I used 1/3 the amount of mint, as recommended by others.

I've made this several times now and it has been a crowd pleaser each time!This past time, I added more jalapeno and served inside one half of a watermelon...smashing!

We had Watermelon Gazpacho at one of the nicer restaurants in town, it was delicious. I made a note of the ingredients that I could discern. Same vegetables, mint and creme so I know they work well together. This recipe wasn't good though, all I can taste is mint. If I had read the reviews, I'd have known to cut back or eliminate the mint. I'll make this again without mint and see how it is.

My husband enjoyed the dish, but it wasn't my favorite. (Luckily he volunteered to eat the leftovers.) I pureed one- third of the vegetables with the melon to increase the savory factor. But I think I'm just a tomato-kind-of-girl.

excellent summer appetizer for lunch or dinner. Needs a bit more lime juice and vinegar and is nice served with fresh lime wedges. Very healthy and refreshing

So close to 4 forks -- my favorite food of the summer. Unlike other reviewers, I like the mint and decrease the jalapeno, but often make a small amount of melon puree with plenty of jalapeno for individuals who like/can tolerate the heat. I add some Balsamic vinegar to taste -- think it "kicks it up a notch" and often use more lime juice than called for or serve lime wedges on the side.

An excellent cold soup. I also left off the mint but doubled the jalapenos. I give it a four rating and will definitely use it again

This was beautiful and the flavors were excellent, but it was *WAY* too sweet for a first course. Luckily, I had time to make a different first course. I served this as a chilled dessert soup (as is often done in Scandinavia) and it was a big hit, but I can't imagine serving something this sweet as a first course. I would make it again, but only for dessert. Per earlier reviews, I decreased the amount of mint, otherwise made it exactly as written.

Excellent summer flavors. You can skip the sour cream and use a healthy drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle of kosher salt in the bowl at the last minute. Also, it gets even better a day or two after making it.

This was very good--and beautiful. It looks like a bowl of fruit jewels. But of course it tastes like vegetables. And you can adjust the vegetable amounts as you like. We liked it with a drizzle of olive oil and a few garlicky croutons on top.

Added two tablespoons of drained black beans. Delicious!

Just coming back from Spain this is the most wonderful gazpacho I ever had. Perfect balance of flavors!

Love this recipe - it's a perfect summer starter and pairs well with spicy foods. Top quality watermelon is a must - if you use watermelon that isn't sweet, this won't be good. I let is sit a day as suggested and it was great.

Honestly quite a disappointment. It turned out to be more of a watery salsa rather than a soup. To become a soup, I feel it needs to be pureed and then have some final touches added to it. However, the flavours were not promising enough for me to venture it.

I agree with first two about the mint - The second batch I made was 1/4 the amount and I also let it sit for a day before serving - this helped to marry the flavors - noticeably!

Three forks. We made it with Meyer lemon from a friend's tree the second time and it was so much nicer...also, the mint is overstated for most of us...maybe 1/3 if the recipe's amount? Going to be a summertime favorite for us.

We made this several times already substituting lemon juice from our tree for limes from a store. The mint was too overpowering, therefore we eliminated it after the first batch.
