I liked but didn't love these. Next time, I'll reduce the baking soda by a 1/2 tsp, as this amount gave them too cakey a texture and also that characteristic soda tang. Also, I think I'll omit the raisins and focus on the tart cherries, which along with the chocolate and almond, gave this recipe a lot of pontential.

In the end I just didn't like all that fruit in there. Oh well.

Oh these are good! I substituted half of the flour with whole-wheat flour, which provided a nice, sturdy base for the robust flavors of the dried fruits. I also used white chocolate chips instead of regular ones -- these are blondies, after all. I didn't have the huge pan called for, so I used two 9x13 pans. They worked just fine: the blondies puffed up at least an inch high and then settled down to maybe 5/8 inch. I needed to bake them for almost a half-hour. They are very rich, so I cut them into smaller squares -- about 2 inches, which made enough for a large crowd.

wow - these bars were a hot mess (I mean that in the best possibly sense) the mix in to batter ration seemed excessive while making, and trying to cut into squares but very delicious to eat. I might cut down by 1/2 cup on the dried fruit - but a great bar cookie to have in my back pocket. I liked them a lot better than brownies.

I made the recipe as written. It is delicious: moist, rich and complex. It was very popular at a pre-Christmas dinner and I had a surprising number of requests for the recipe. It definitely can stand alone as a dessert, especially accompanied by a good cup of coffee or tea which is how I served it.

Awesome bars -- very rich. Suggest cut smaller than recipe calls for. Can easily stand alone as a dessert as preamble says. Many requests for recipe after family party.

I think these are great. I agreed with some suggestions, such as to use 60% Cacao Ghiradelli Chocolate Chips (does anyone actually chop chocoate when such chips are readily available?), and it might make sense to use only dried cherries OR dried cranberries, as it is difficult to distinguish them in the bars. I also cut them smaller, making 48 bars. I used the stated pan and they came out just thick enough, and done in the suggested time. I also would soak fruits in liqueur next time. Otherwise, truly great recipe.

I've made these several times. I use a different combination of dried fruit and nuts each time and it's great! I even soaked the fruit in Kirschwasser and it was amazing!

I loved loved loved these blondies. Instead of using cherries, I doubled the cranberries, and I used chocolate chips instead of bothering to chop up chocolate. I then doubled the entire recipe and baked it in my big broiler pan, which measures about 18 x 13 (lined with foil, heavily buttered and floured). Baked for 30 minutes. They came out perfect, just ever so slightly undercooked the way brownies (or blondies) should be. The flavor was outstanding, and they stayed moist and chewy and wonderful until the very last square.

These were OK, not as good as I thought they would be. I think I'd rather have real brownies with all the fruit in them. If you want a really great Christmas bar, try the chocolate bars in Joy of Cooking - citron, almonds, frosting, and great spice. Wish I had made those instead.

I made the recipe as stated, but used a smaller pan for a thicker bar. The only thing I didn't like was the chocolate... I don't think it belongs in this recipe. Otherwise, it would be a nice, fruity bar - a substitute for fruit cake.

I doubled the recipe and the batter filled a 17x12 baking pan and 3/4 of a 12X9 pan. Both came out as a thin layer bar.

I soaked dried fruit in rum instead of water to add add'l flavor (heat rum first).

These are very yummy. However, I tried to bake in one 13X9 pan ( seemed like it fit fine) and the result turned out a bit thick,almost like a cake and took an hour to get done in the middle. Better in a large pan to create a thin bar, I think. But the flavors are great, and the batter was out of this world!

I made this exactly as stated and it was great. I used 2 pans, a 13x9 and 11x8 as I did not have a 17x12 and it was perfect.

Recently made substituting dried currants for the raisins. Loved them and so did everyone at work. We even used 'plain' bakers semi-sweet chocolate and it came out great.

Who said they weren't moist and rich? You must have done something wrong. They are tho most delicious and interesting brownies I ever made, and popular! I do always have to use two pans

I skipped the dried fruit (just didn't happen to have them on hand) and the blondies still turned out great. They looked like brownies, but tasted better.

I am not known for my skill in the kitchen, but this dessert blew everyone away (including me)! I am definitely planning on making it again.

After reading the rave reviews for these bars, I found myself disappointed. To me the flavor is just not that great, very underwhelming. I wish I had not bought high quality chocolate and dried cherries to make these -- not worth it.

Rating: 3
Easy to make and good keepers. Good quality bittersweet chocolate is a must to contrast with all the fruit. This is going to become a "regular" for Holiday baking.

I did not have as large a pan as the recipe stated, so I used one a bit smaller. The blondies were much thicker and took longer to cook - but WOW were they decadent! "Chock-full" of wonderful flavors and very moist. Served with vanilla ice cream was perfect!

I made these for our holiday open house this past weekend and everyone loved them (me too!). I cut them into bite size squares, easy to grab off the cookie plate. I found bittersweet chocolate chips (60% cocoa) by Ghirardelli in our local grocery store, which was a little cheaper than the high end bars. The combination of cherries, cranberries, raisins, almonds, and chocolate with the hint of cinnamon make it a perfect addition to my holiday cookie box.

Not bad, but certainly not that good. I expected something more moist and richer.

Really good and easy!!
