After reading previous reviews, I wanted to make these more moist. To do so, after chopping the dates, I soaked them in just enough boiling water to coat them (a few tablespoons). As they sat in the water, they broke down a little bit, creating a moister, less "chunky" texture. I did not need to drain them from the water as the water was somewhat absorbed and the mixture because paste-like. Also, I used whole wheat flour, reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, and used old-fashioned oats rather than quick-cooking. They turned out great.

Fabulous!!!! I modified this to make it "healthier". I used whole wheat flour, egg whites, and Splenda brown sugar (remember, only use half the amount)and added pecans. They were an absolute hit!! Thanks.

A delicious alternative to oatmeal raisin. I coarsely ground about half of my oats in a coffee grinder to vary the texture. Crispier than I expected, but still chewy and not too hard.

These turned out well--tasty and chewy. A little less sweet than I'd expected. Compared to other reviewers, I feel as if I made a different recipe. I didn't have any problems and the results were pretty much what the ingredients suggested. Someone recommended including some cinnamon or nutmeg, which I think would have been a nice addition.

These were good. I was worried they were going to be like a trail mix bar, which I didn't want. I definitely wanted a cookie, like oatmeal raisin, to use up some dates, not some healthy twist. So I cut back the oats to 1 cup and added about a cup of chocolate chips, and they were very good, moist but not too cakey - still chewy. I like how the dates go more into the texture of the cookie rather than raisins which maintain their identity.

(addendum to previous review) I cooked at 325 on convection for about 10-11 minutes which kept them chewy.

I seriously modified this but love the results: Used 1 c quick cooking oats & 1/2 cup wheat bran; added chopped walnuts and semi-sweet chips (which can offset some sweetness); used an eggwhite instead of a whole egg. I mixed the dates in the butter as suggested and was a little worried abut how the dry ingredients would mix in, but it came out fine. I tried dome and flattened shape, and like both. The domes stay softer in the middle and overall the cookies have a delighful crispy shell. And I just ate 6 for a "well balanced" breakfast :) I'd definitely make them again.

I loved these! Very easy to make. I shortened the cooking time to a little over 10 min. Also added a Tbsp or so of butter ripple liquer.

I had a surplus of dates, so I was excited to try this recipe. The cookies had a good flavor, but I found them very dry.

You must be a date lover to make these cookies! They are VERY sweet ... regardless of the low quantity of sugar used. They are a very soft cookie, you could even say soggy. I did like them however... but sickened of them rather fast. There's got to be a better recipe.

Exactly what I had in mind! Made it according to the recipe (less 1/4 ts salt because I had salted butter). The stovetop assembly was different but didn't leave much to clean up! I did decrease the cooking time, checking them at 7 minutes. Moved trays and gave them another 6 minutes - 5 minutes would have been fine. Soft, sweet but not too sweet - I've eaten three and am trying to stop at that!

I somehow wound up with a ton of dates so was excited to try this recipe out. I took the advice of an earlier reviewer and mixed the dates with the butter first. These are great cookies. A perfect accompaniment with tea or ice cream. Nice and chewy. If anything they could use a bit more salt. I'd go up to a full teaspoon. You could also grind the oats in the food processor for a slightly less rustic look.

Hm. Well, these did not turn out sweet at all, in fact, they could have used a bit more sweetness. The dates were very juicy and fresh, but none of that came through in the cookies. The texture is almost that of a light muffin, a bit springy even, not much like a cookies. Next time I try date cookies I'll test the other epicurious recipe.

These cookies are fair. They taste like something from the Health Food Store, not the bakery.

Yummy! My husband's only compliant was that he needed a glass of milk to wash it down. Great texture, great flavor. Easy to make. Couldn't ask for much more in a cookie. I took the advice of previous reviewers and let the dates sit in the melted butter. When I saw how they absorbed the butter I was concerned that my other dry ingredients would not incorporate. Everything worked out, but next time I will follow the recipe and put the dates in later. Might make for a moister cookie. Also, I found this recipe made more than 24 cookies. Quite a bit more. Don't make the balls of dough too big or your cookies won't bake at the same time - 16 miuntes (8 and 8) is all you need. Careful not to burn them. The bottoms of mine cooked faster than the tops. Strange. Have to watch for that.

As soon as they cooled, I had one and loved them so much I immediately started making another batch. I cut down the sugar by a quarter and it was still sweet enough. I added a shake of cinnamon and nutmeg. This will definitely go down in the 'family cookbook'.

Excellent cookies! I add rosted pecans to the dough, and they come out absolutely beautiful. Very sweet - just the way I like it! Also, as a former reader said, let dates sit in the melted butter for a few minutes.

Good, though on the sweet side. The oatmeal and dates yield a terrific chewy texture. FYI, if you bake them as balls, they will flatten into half-domes. Don't overbake or the cookies will harden significantly when cooling.

I've made these cookies about 5 times in the last week! I love it. However, I only used half a cup of sugar instead of 3/4 and only a cup of dates. I also added some applesauce to the final concoction as it looked too dry. Yes they do come out like a ball but after I rolled them, I flattened them slightly and then pushed a pecan in the middle for decoration. Turned out beautifully! I did not bake them according to the time stated, about 8 mins and then shifted the trays for another 8 mins. In fact, I'm going to make them again today! Everyone just loves them!

i have made this recipe hundreds of times. for more flavour, add the dates to the melted butter, stir and let sit for five minutes. dates melt slightly and add rich flavour throughout. one of the healthiest and best cookies ever. I sometimes add 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 walnuts or pecans.

Came out in little balls - dough did not spread at all. One batch burned on bottom despite shortening time and rotating levels in oven. May try again in case of error! Tasted fine.

I found this recipe to be a very unconventional method for making cookies. Eighteen minutes may be too long to bake these cookies. I won't be making these cookies again. I have found better oatmeal cookie recipes on this site.

Delicious chewy cookies! I agree that it was hard to tell if they were overcooked--probably because I used Golden Brown Sugar instead of light. I reduced the cooking time to 16 min or so. Very good--will definitely make again.

Interesting batter. I ran out of light brown sugar so I used some dark. It was difficult to tell if they were overbaking because of the dark brown sugar. The cookies turned out soft and chewy.
