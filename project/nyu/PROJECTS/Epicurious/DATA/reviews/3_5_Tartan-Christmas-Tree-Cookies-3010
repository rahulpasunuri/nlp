these cookies were absolutely delicious - light, crisp, and flaky - and thank goodness they were so good because the dough was so difficult to work with (dry and crumbly) that i almost chucked the whole thing before we even made it to the oven! i ended up having to spritz and work in a little cold water in order to roll it out at all... next time i will add a t or T of ice water into the mixer before popping it in the fridge. so try this recipe but be warned to keep an extra close eye on the texture.

These are the cutest cookies! We made them look like our family tartan "Keith". It's great for kids also!
