I make this dish at least once a year, for a large crowd I substitute lasagna noodles for the crespelle as it is easier to serve. To reduce the broccoli rabe bitterness only use smallest leaves and thinest stems, you can achieve this by buying an additional head or two of the rabe. This dish is always a huge hit....

This was quite good, although you do have to do a bit of multitasking toward the end. Like heidikleyn, my springform pan was too large and I thought it would end up a giant mess. So I used a smaller 7" (non-springform) pyrex, and said my prayers. It actually worked out fine, removing it by turning it upside down on a plate and then reverting back upright on another plate. It's true that rapini is bitter, as jiminaz complained, but the red pepper flakes and sausage are supposed to offset the bitterness with a bit of heat. Definitely fun to make the crespelles.

This dish was fabulous. I did make a couple changes based on leftovers. Instead of using sausage I used the leftover turkey from Chrismas and two sauteed portabella mushrooms. My springform pan was too big for the crespelles but that didn't matter. The cheese melted over the top perfectly and made a nice crust around the torte. I will probably make the same "mistake" again with the pan. Next time I will add sauteed onion and some herbs. The presentation was wonderful! There are numerous ways to make this and it will be fun to change it up.

This is a fabulous appetizer, especially for a crowd. I made this for our gourmet supper club and everyone raved - and they are a tough crowd to please. I made a few changes - I only sauteed the broccoli rabe (did not boil) and I used store bought crepes which I would generally never do but there was so much flavor with everything else going on it made absolutly no difference in the end and certainly makes the whole recipe much more user friendly

I made this some time ago and I just stumbled accross it here. I'm surprised by everyone's high praise. Mine turned out so bitter I didn't like it at all. I didn't serve it to anyone else- so maybe it's just me. Any suggestions from those who liked it so much? It is impressive to look at. Spinach sounds like a good substitute for the rabe.

Excellent! Served as an appetizer. Next time, I would not boil broccoli rabe. I'll add it to the cooked sausage instead. It's a very special recipe.

This is a wonderful dish to make as a first course. I increased everything and used a larger springform pan. Since this is a rich first course, I cut smaller pieces and served it with with a small salad on the side using a sweet shallot dressing. I also made the sauce thinner because I liked to drizzle some of the sauce over each wedge when served. Excellent dish!

I have made this for company twice and it's always a hit. One time instead of layering the crespelle you can wrap up filling in each one and make cannelloni - easier to make more for a crowd. Then just put dollops of the sauce overtop. Yes the sauce is thick but just put blobs of it- it thins out when it bakes. I've also used the filling and sauce recipes to make a basic lasagna - also delicious!!!

I think the ratio of flour to milk is off a bit. I just added more milk so that it would have a more sauce like consistency. I also used spinach (and no fat milk to save calories). A great way to flavor the bechamel if you are being calorie conscious is to throw in one or two "Laughing Cow" Light Swiss Cheese wedges. At only 35 calories a piece they add a nice flavor without a lot of fat.

This was very good, the sauce definately did not drizzle, rather I was dolloping spoonfuls of mashed potato-esque sauce that did not spread well. If I make this again, I would make the sauce much thinner. Overall the dish was wonderful.

I've now made this several times, following the recipe exactly. Yes, it's time consuming, but worth every minute. One more thing: Leftovers can be frozen in individual portions and then reheated, providing, of course, that you thaw them first to prevent any drying out. I thaw them overnight in the fridge, but, in a pinch, the microwave thaw cycle would probably work.

Really outstanding and unusual. Elegant. I almost always have fresh baby spinach in the house, so I used several handfuls of it in place of the broccoli rabe; I wilted the spinach in the same pan as the sausage once the sausage had browned. To cut some fat, I used skim milk instead of whole milk in the besciamella, and I did not sprinkle any cheese on top of the final layer of besciamella. It browned beautifully and reheats nicely the next day. Try this recipe! If you're good at juggling tasks on the stovetop, it saves lots of time to make the crespelle, brown the filling, and boil the besciamella all at the same time on different burners.

A beautiful meal. We've eaten it as dinner and as the 'pasta appetizer' before a 3 or 4 course meal. I found the sausage filling to be a bit thin and would make more next time but other than that, it's fantastic.

A bit daunting at first, but well worth the work. I cut the cream sauce by half and used chicken instead of sausage (for guests who were less fond of sausage) and it still tasted wonderful

My husband loved the dish, and I thought it looked very elegant. I would recommend this dish for pot luck events as well as serving company. It was the 2 of us & we were impressed :-) I followed the directions from the magazine to a T.

OK, I'm sold - have my 8" springform pan and can't wait to try it - but when? Is this breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner? Any suggestions for accompaniments?

Made this as an intro to Easter dinner, and it was wonderful. I didn't bother to search out my 8" springform pan and just used my 9" pan, so the torta presented with sloped sides and a domed top. Georgeous! Everyone loved it and it re-heated well the next day also. I'm thinking about making it again with smaller crepes and rolling the filling similar to canneloni, it will be wonderful for a buffet.

My husband would never eat broccoli de rabe. It's a staple in my Italian family. I served this at a Supper Club dinner party and everyone including my husband raved about it. This is a keeper. My only correction is to the besciamella, it needed to be thinned to better cover each layer.

This dish was excellent,delicious and it looks great! Although it was time consuming to prepare, I will definitely make it again and take the suggestions of preparing the sauce and crepes in advance. I followed the directions completely, but next time I will add the broccoli rabe to the sausage once it was cooked and let them simmer together (to save time and clean up). The sauce was thick and I used 2% milk, it just needs more milk to keep it thin for pouring on the layers. It's virtually impossible to ruin this recipe, I highly recommend it.

I thought this recipe was very good. I grew up with rabe, and we never boiled it. I decided to combine a few steps. I fried out the sausage in a dutch oven without the garlic. When it was done, I added the garlic and the uncooked rabe, salted, stirred, and covered until the rabe was tender--just a minute or two. The rabe was beautifully green, and I saved myself some time. I agree that the bechamel was too thick to work with. The next time, I'll add more milk. The torta is very rich, therefore, very filling.

I've made this torta twice. The first time as is and it was heavy but good. The second time, I lightened it up by using fat free milk in place of whole milk and half the cheese. I increased the crespelle portions by 1/2 because the first time the batter only made 5 crepes. I also used more broccoli rabe and drained all the oil from the sausage before incorporating the broccoli rabe. Not necessary but I used whole wheat flour instead of white. It was delicious and better than the original recipe my husband agreed!

I thought this recipe was outstanding! Mellow, delicate, even subtle. Do not correct how thick the bechamel is; the top layer puffs up and turns golden brown. I did not have Asiago, so used reggiano and grated cheddar for the top. It worked fine. And what a lovely presentation to boot!

I thought this dish was too one-note and not worth the effort. The crepes are too soft to even be noticed in all the bechamel. A layer of fresh tomatoes would've made it better. None of the elements is hard to make but there're so darn many of them that it ends up being "hard". In the end I felt it all would've just been better on a pizza. I wouldn't bother to make this again.

I made this recipe with spicy turkey sausage and fresh rapini from my garden. (garden fresh Broccoli di Rape in January is one of the pleasures of living in Hawaii!)I think the extra spice and the bitterness of the rapini was a perfect contrast with the besciamella. Saute the greens in olive oil with garlic WITHOUT steaming them. I think this brings out the buttery - bitter flavor. Boiling it totally ruins the signature flavor, IMHO. I too had to thin down the sauce as it was very thick when following the recipe exactly. This is a real keeper for any special event. It was totally worth the effort. Enjoy everyone! John D.

I made this recipe as part of a brunch that I put together for about 8 people. Everyone loved it! The combination of the sweet sausage, the bitter broccoli rabe and the luscious besciamelle is wonderful. Broccoli rabe is one of my favorite vegetables so I was easily won over but even my boyfriend who is not a big fan asked me to make this again!

my husband and I loved this recipe! I did pour off as much fat from the sausage as I could before adding the broccoli rabe. Note to the cook looking for the 8" springform pan: Bridge Kitchenware in NYC has them. www.bridgekitchenware.com

I wanted to love this recipe. It looked so gorgeous and sounded delicious but in the end I wasn't bowled over by it. I did like the idea of crepes replacing pasta, but the rest seemed fairly ordinary to me. It was time consuming to make, although not difficult. Not nearly as good or unusual as the pasta with cauliflower, olvies and almonds from the same issue.

Not difficult to assemble given the gorgeous presentation. Absolutely delicious!

Made this for New Year's day lunch for four and it was a big hit. Followed recipe exactly, but the besciamella thickened a bit too much, so I added more milk to make it pourable. Everyone had seconds and there was still a small wedge left over for the next day, and that heated up well in the microwave.Gorgeous to present. Gorgeous to eat.

I made this for an NYE dinner party for 6. Everyone liked it. The crepes were a nice change from regular sheets of pasta, and made it much lighter. However, is there an 8" spring pan in existence?! I couldn't find one anywhere, Crate and Barrel, Williams-Sonoma, etc. I ended up using a 9" and doubling the crepe batter to adjust to fit.

Oh this is one of the best breakfast recipe I have ever made. It is gourmet comfort food! It is worth the time it takes to make.

Hearty decadent good-looking comfort food. Made it veggie using veggie Italian Sausage, and used nonfat milk instead of whole for the cream sauce(which made it very thick). My husband can't stop raving about it. Best part is, it tastes just as good heated up the next day.
