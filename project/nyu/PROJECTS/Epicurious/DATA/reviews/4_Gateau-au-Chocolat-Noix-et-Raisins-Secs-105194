Seems very Italian as well as French. I love this cake and it was quite popular with guests. Didn't use as heavy a glaze, but delish!

This is an easy recipe for a delicious cake. I have made it several times with success and received many compliments. Recently, I added an additional tablespoon of Cointreau to the recipe and substituted the walnutts with pecans and the result was just as pleasant.

I have made this twice, I loved it both times. Everyone liked that it was rich but not so sweet as a brownie. I liked it best the time I didn't have enough nuts, only 3/4 of a cup, and ground up very fine. That time I also used less raisens, and I processed them too, so the cake was moist but no big raisen bite. I was pretty generous with the Cointreau, and I put a T of it in the chocolate frosting - mmmm. I'll make it often!

I've made this cake three times in the last month. Everyone loves it, even those who aren't too fond of raisins. I don't know what made the other person's cake crumbly, but I have never had that problem. I served it at a Bastille Day party, and I caught a man slicing bites off of the cake and eating it from the serving platter!

The cake was okay. I used a mixture of cashews and hazelnuts to get to the required amount. It was crumblier than i expected, i was hoping for something like the flourless tortes you get in a restaurant. Good for chocoholics, but otherwise i'll rack it up to a learning experience.
