Great basic shortbread recipe. Easy to use with a cookie cutter. I used 1/2 recipe for decorating cookies (icing and sprinkles) and added some cardamon to the other 1/2 for dessert (great with the addition of some spice).

This is a fantastic cookie! More delicious than traditional 3- ingredient shortbreads, it is easy, buttery heaven. I have made it many times, and people are often surprised it tastes so good. (It is very plain looking.) If you overcook them, they will still taste good, but will be a little less tender/more crumbly. Every grocery store in my area has European butter, but yours may store it in a weird place. (One has it near the fresh baked bread, not in the dairy aisle.) Please note this cookie is also popular with kids and is an excellent egg-free choice. Follow the recipe and you will be happy. :)

I love this cookie! Easy and quick, it's an especially good cookie for holiday baking. Did not find European style butter in my area, but the cookie is good with regular butter. This cookie is somewhere between a real shortbread and a sugar cookie...it's delicious!

These cookies have become the go to cookie to make for every occasion. Super easy. It also works well for cut out cookies. At Christmas we drizzle with melted chocolate it make it extra special.

These cookies were the easiest that I have ever made, and some of the most tasty. I replaced the granulated sugar with golden brown and went heavy on the flour because of the altitude here, but otherwise everything was as written. YUM!

These cookes were delicious; I put chopped pinenuts in the dough, then pressed pinenuts onto the top of them before baking. They came out all toasty and delicious - reminded me of these fantastic cookies I got in this little town in Spain called, Arcos de la Frontera. The cookies were made by the nuns there, and you could buy them fresh from the convent daily. Brings back wonderful memories....

Made this just as written. Fantastic! If you have good baking sheets and really good butter,(European style is the key to this recipe) you should be delighted with the results of this one.

I made some big changes to make these cookies really special. I added pistachio pieces to the cookie mix. After the baked cookies cooled, I iced them with lime fondant. I was actually trying to duplicate a cookie from a bakery in Berkeley and they were a huge success.

I followed the recipe by using the European Butter and I thought the cookies were very good. Not too sweet but very rich and creamy.

I thought these turned out pretty well. My 4-year old son loved them. The texture was a bit crumbly but the flavor was good. I admit, I did not use the European-style butter, just Land O'Lakes. Perhaps the higher quality/fat butter would have added the extra oomph.

I agree with first reviewer. This was more of a cross between a shortbread cookie and a sugar cookie, but not necessarily the best of both.

This tasted more like a sugar cookie then a shortbread cookie. Was not impressed...found that the only time this cookie was worth nibbling on was when it was eaten while drinking a cup of hot tea or coffee. Not very sweet, but not very interesting.
