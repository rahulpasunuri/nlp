This is a go-to favorite recipe of ours. We do not discard the pepper though.

First few times I made this I also found it bland. Made some very simple tweaks by swapping black beans for the pintos, swapping a poblano for the cubanelle and slightly reducing the water. I also served over rice that I tossed with line and cilantro. It vanished.

P.S. 2 cups of water is enough if made the way described below.

Tips from a woman who's been eating Dominican beans all her life: 1. Don't puree the beans. Puree 1/2 a green BELL pepper, 1/2 a red onion, 3 garlic cloves, and oregano with some white cooking wine. Saute half of the mixture. Add ham base to the sofrito for even more flavor. (The other half of the mixture can be used to season chicken, or it can be refrigerated and saved for the next time you make beans). 2. Use red beans (or Goya Dominican Beans if you can find them). 3. Add several 1-inch cubes of auyama (butternut squash or pumpkin) to the beans as they begin to boil. If you wish, you can discard the auyama with the cilantro once the beans are done. 4. The black pepper isn't really necessary and neither is the bay leaf. The auyama will thicken the sauce but you can also add a bit more tomato sauce if you desire a thicker consistency. Made this way, the beans should be ready in 30 minutes or so. Serve with white rice and tostones. Hope this helps. Buen provecho!

Took some work but well worth it. Very tasty. It was a big hit.

THis has a nice flavor but it is a little bland and I also thought it was a little mushy - i would use less water or puree a smaller quantity of beans. I don't think I would cook it longer. My husband added some hot sauce and next time I will either use a spicier pepper or add a little cayenne. But we both liked it enough to make it again.

It was OK - a little bland, but really easy to make.

Absolutely wonderful. Makes a great vegetarian meal served with rice and shredded yellow cheese. Or serve it with lime-marinated chicken, sour cream, tortillas, etc. Already made my second batch, made more this time. Much better than I expected.

This was delicious, a great staple. My advice: follow the recipe exactly except double the amount

Tallchick from CA--are you always so easy? Guess it doesn't take much to push someone's buttons. First of all, there is no such place as Whitebread, Kansas.
