SLOW COOKED ONION. So, I made this recipe overnight. Here's my update: I used half the butter, and put in a couple table spoons of olive oil. I left the top askew for the first three hours, and then stirred. I stirred an hour later, and settled the top to almost closed, then went to bed. Results: The onions were mahogany colored on the top half-inch. The rest were brownish. All were clear. I tasted those on the top and those below, and the texture of the top was a bit better, but the taste was the same. These onions are very tasty. I smothered a salmon patty with them for breakfast, and loved being able to use all the onions I wanted. Are they the same as pan-caramelized onions? Absolutely not. But they ARE yummy, and my son loved putting them on his turkey sandwich for lunch. I put half in a jar in the fridge, and half in a container in the freezer, and when we've used them up, I plan to make this recipe again. I marked the container: "slow-cooked onions" instead of caramelized. Next time I will leave the top a crack more open over night, to see if it improves the color throughout.

I saw someone else with a recipe for this, and the only difference, is that she calls for the top of the cooker to be left "tilted" (left a crack open) for the first 3 hours. Perhaps that helps the liquid be less, and doesn't "boil" them quite so badly. I'm going to try that tonight. I'll post what happens.

These were fantastic! Because a few people complained about lack of flavor, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 2 tbsp of brown sugar and 2 tbsp of soy sauce a little more than halfway through cooking. It smelled like French Onion soup in my house - yum! If it wasn't August and midnight, I probably would've made some on the spot.

Horrid. I agree with past reviews that state if anyone has caramelized onions the old-fashioned way on the stovetop, you will NOT want to go near these. What a waste of three good onions, some butter and the electricity to run a slow-cooker for 12 hours. They turn a very dirty and odd brown color as opposed to a rich golden color. I tried to rescue them with some sugar and salt, but to no avail.

Don't know why the bad reviews, but for me the onions were nearly dark brown at the tenth hour. I always cut my onions pole to pole when I want to caramelize them because they tend to stick together otherwise. If I were doing a small batch I would use a fry pan, but for a big batch this is the easiest way to go. I used a KitchenAid slow cooker and had great results. I was able to lift the onions and leave behind the "butter jus" for another use.

This recipe worked for us. 12 hours was enough in our Crock Pot slow cooker, we didn't need more time. I read other reviews about being bland. We added 2 TB brown sugar, 2 TB soy sauce about half way through and it turned out perfectly. This is an easy way to get carmelized onions without standing over the stove.

A hint to avoid disintegrating onions: slice them pole to pole, rather than into rings. They will hold together better. YES, They will take significantly longer than expected but the results will be worth it. You can also start them in the slow cooker and finish them quickly on the stovetop in a heavy pan or dutch oven. Used them for pizza, tarte d'alsace, scrambled eggs (with lox too!), sandwiches and, of course soup. Yes, use a cheap bag of yellow onions and they'll be plenty sweet. You can add a touch of (white or dark) balsamic in place of sugar as suggested by another reader to add some punch.

Turned out perfectly.

A waste of time and onions. I was suspicious about how this would work with so much moisture, and an earlier reviewer was spot on in calling them "boiled." Overcooked, bland and mushy, useless. I am rather suspicious that the folk giving positive reviews here have never done them in a pan.

This is the simplest route to French onion soup I've found. Throw in the onions, forget about them overnight, then reheat with beef broth and a splash of Armagnac the next day. Mine came out with a beautiful dark brown color and sweet aroma. The butter content, however, is bewildering. I put in two Tbs. of butter and 2 of oil, and will cut back to one of each the next time I make this.

Yes this did take longer than the recipe said (i did 18hrs), so thankful that it said it was almost impossible to overcook them. I too turned this into French onion soup. I drained (and saved the stock) the onions and saved 1/2 for other recipies (pizza today!). Put 4- 5cups of beef and 4-5 cups of chix stock in the slowcooker with 1/2 the onions while I separated the onion juice from the fat and put the juice back in the soup. A dash of port, generous salt and cooked it till it was hot. Then in bowls under the broiler with a slice of hard bread and shredded swiss. Easiest onion soup I've made.

This is the beginning to the best onion soup ever. So once you've finished this recipe, throw a bunch of onions back in the slow cooker with any kind of stock (veg, beef, chix or mix em) add a dash of sherry if you want and warm it all up. Onion soup is best served with a nice slice of bread and cheeze on top and broiled. Grueyere is the traditional but I like provelone!

This was good! Really good; nice gold color; sweet flavor; rich texture. However, I suspect to the people who say it didn't work that one of two things was the case a) their slow cooker wasn't at a high enough temp or they didn't cook it long enough (I let mine go for 15 hours) 2) I added a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar to help the process of caramelize the onions. Plus, I didn't have to stand there for 20 to 40 min, watching it. A big pluss

After reading the good reviews I thought I'll try this recipe for myself. I filled the slow cooker to the top with onions, added the butter and left them in for about 16 hours. Now they are done and a deep brown but are certainly not caramelized. With a little seasoning they might even taste somewhat good. For now I'm very disappointed. I hate throwing food out so maybe I can save them by additionally frying them for a bit and thus hopefully get them caramelized.

Nasty!&and not in a good way. I put them all down the disposal.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was horrendous!! I'd have given this a negative fork rating if I could. The onions were bitter, had no texture whatsoever and were just plain terrible. I ended up throwing the whole thing out and carmelizing them in a pan.

This is such a great use for a slow cooker! I used a whole pile of fresh (i.e. not dried) onions from a local farm that were DEFINITELY not sweet, and it still worked well. I left them in the slow cooker for almost 20 hours and we never quite got to "mahogany" but they are still delicious. Getting the broth and onion-y butter at the end are one of the best things about this! This does make quite a lot so I froze it in small portions and have had good results after thawing. So far, these onions have been pizza topping, quiche filling, and pasta sauce.

I just spray the crockpot with Pam then put the onions in on high for about 7 hours. They come out brown and sweet. I can always add butter or other fats latter.

Wow! I loved the smell of the onions and couldn't wait to eat them. I used a big bag of cheap yellow onions, 4 tbsp butter and 4 tbsp chicken stock. They came out a beautiful burgundy color. But I made a big mistake in turning them into onion soup. The onions were much less potent once combined with the broth. I think it was a waste of onions that should have been eaten as a side or with something less liquidy. I am making this again this week!

Unbelievable. I give it 3 forks, because it is, after all, onions and butter. But it's so amazing what happens when they cook. They are truly delicious. The person who said they "kept snacking" during the cooking made me laugh. I read the comment aloud to my husband and we both said, "yeah, right"... but it's true! You just can't wait to dive in and taste those buggers! I also took on faith that they guy who said to save my money with cheap onions knew what he was talking about. It made sense, but I didn't fact check. However, the cheap yellow onions I used came out sweet and flavorful and delicious, so it was worth the gamble. Finally, I planned to cook them for 22 hours, but they ended up only needing 12-14 as the recipe said. I served them tonight just as a side to filet, but I'm going to try using the rest in French Onion Soup. I too couldn't really skim the butter off, but they didn't seem greasy.

I've been making this for years now...got the recipe from somewhere else. I let cook on low for 14 hours and pack the whole crockpot with onions. Sometimes I mix red onions with Vidalias. Then I add veal stock or beef broth for an amazing French onion soup that was easy to make!

bland, boiled, brown onions! yuk. Take the time to carmelize in a saute pan for more flavor and texture.

For once I made a recipe as directed. The onions were a yummy side at Thanksgiving Dinner, especially since we don't do cranberry sauce. They were a bit too fatty though. Next time I will replace at least half the butter with broth. I loved how easy they were to make!

I'm single and cut the recipe in half. I used yellow onions and really enjoyed the results, but couldn't find enough ways to use them. I did make an onion soup by tossing them in a beef stock, and enjoyed them as a side dish. I have also heard about using them on pizza. In the future, I will make less.

A tip- don't waste your money on sweet onions for this dish- buy the cheapest ones. Sweet onions are best used raw. They have no more sugar in them than regular onions, they just taste sweeter because they have fewer of the bitter chemicals that give regular onions that strong taste. Cooking drives those chemicals off, so a sweet onion and a regular onion are equally sweet after they have been cooked.

Since the last reviewer said the onions were too sweet, I decided to experiment with red onions, and used olive oil instead of butter. Cooked beautifully, but not sweet enough for my taste; that's what I get for using red onions instead of a sweeter variety. My husband and I like these as an accompaniment to our T-Bone steaks, but they weren't quite worth it after 14 hours and the smell of onions wafting through my house.

Good and fantastically easy, but makes quite a bit more than I could reasonably use. It's maybe a bit too sweet, too. Try with other onions?

The onions were awesome! I slow cooked them in butter for about 36 hours in order to get the "mahogany" color onions. It's delicious with a good steak!

I made the recipe exactly as is. I love onions and I love butter but this combination was nauseating and greasy-I who can eat anything and use up anything threw this out(after a week in the fridge). Maybe using a small amount of olive oil would have been better- butter in a slow cooker smells awful- I used LOL sweet butter.

It may just be me, but I have been having problems with this recipe. The first time I made it I had to stir several times, because the onions on the outside of the pot cooked so much faster. The best color I got was a rather anemic brown. Last night I tried it and was awoken at 5am to the smell of burning onions. They had been in the crockpot for only 8 hours. I am beginning to suspect my crockpot cooks way to hot, even on low. I'll make this again, only because I am determined to make it work.

I found this to be the best thing since sliced bread. So easy to make French Onion Soup with. Only problem: has anyone tried this with less butter? I found it difficult to skim, even after refrigeration of 24 hours.

So easy and delicious! I'm not sure I cooked them long enough, since they are beige, not mahogany, but still taste good. Next time I'm going to try red onions.

YUM! Strain the onions and reserve the liquid for another use, add some sherry and serve as a side.

These are terrific. My only suggestion would be to make them when you will be out of the house, since the aroma makes it very hard not to keep sampling. It took mine a little longer than the 12 - 14 hours because we kept opening the top and snacking on an onion or two. My five year old even burned her finger trying to sneak a bite! I'm looking forward to french onion soup for lunch today.

I used these for the simplest appetizer (as long as you remember to start the night before)- just split a wheel of brie horizontally, add the onions, heat and serve. If I don't use the sweet onions, I add a little apricot spread. If I have fresh herbs (esp rosemary) I add that. The onions themselves are great!

This is wonderful! I like to save the broth and refrigerate. I skim off the butter when cooled (great for fried potatoes!) and then use a few of the onions, the broth, some Worcestershire sauce and a touch of sherry. Wonderful French Onion style soup! The onions are great on pizza, in pasta (with some of the butter and parmesan and Italian Seasoning!) and I always find another use for them!
