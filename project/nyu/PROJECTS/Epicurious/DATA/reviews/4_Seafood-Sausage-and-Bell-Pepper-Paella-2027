I would consider using a nonstick skillet for the rice.

Excellent recipe! Just don't overcook the rice or the veggies, or course, as this is always easy to do (and seems to be the case every time I eat someone else's paella). Followed the recipe with the exception of the fish - I left it out for ease as there was just so much protein in it already. I grilled everything I could. It does make a lot, so invite a crowd! And forget the "divide between two pans thing.." just halve it and you will have plenty of food and then some. Tasted great the next day, too.

At a dinner party for 9, only ate half of it -- and everyone loved it. BUT. For the amount of work put in, I could have made "Birthday Party Paella," another (much, much simpler)) recipe on this site, and I doubt anyone would have known the difference. If you are resolved to make this one, these are the simplifications I made based on others' experience: 1. Made the base the night before (not adding the rice), combining into one huge dutch oven I had. 2. The next day grilled the chicken and pre-cut italian sausage and the peppers. Removed pepper skins and placed all in a bowl with a cover for later use. 3. Added rice to mixture, then broth mixture (substituting stock for one of the cups of clam juice) and cooked as recommended for 25 minutes. 4. Got out paella pan and a 12" cast iron skillet, divded the rice between them and studded with all proteins (I used mussels, shrimp, chicken and italian sausage), plus peppers and peas. 5. Covered with aluminum foil and baked for 15 minutes. I got the crust I was looking for by placing the skillet directly on the oven floor when I reheated it the next night (probably on it for 30 minutes at 300). I was going to skip the Italian sausage since there was already so much chorizo in it, but I'm glad I didn't. The chorizo "disappears" into the rice mixture, so it's nice to have chunks of sausage on top. Have fun!

Used this as the basis for a paella party we had over the weekend. Marinated the chicken and did it on the grill. Did not use the colored peppers on top at the end since we had a roasted, marinated pepper appetizer, but added pimiento and smoked paprika to the dish. Rice was not quite as yellow as I expected it to be, but very tasty, nonetheless. We used traditional short-grained Calasparra rice and it did not get mushy, as some other rices do. Also used a combo of scallops, mussels and shimp along with the 2 kinds of sausage and bacon. Lots of flavor...rave reviews.

Excellent recipe!! This definitely makes a LOT of food - used 1/4 recipe and still had enough for 4 people. I left out the ham, pork, Italian sausages, and lobster tails - there is still plenty of meat without them. For those who like a little more spice, I recommend using a bit more cayenne pepper and extra hot chorizo sausage. Yum!

As noted in the other reviews, this recipe makes a tremendous amount of food. I would probably make half a recipe next time.

Wow! This one gets the award for most impressive and delicious meal ever. Every single one of my guests hauled out their phones and began documenting, tweeting and facebooking this dish when I delivered it to the table. And then they began to gorge themselves... 3 and 4 helpings apiece and demanded they be given leftovers if I didn't want them to spend the night at the table. The most arduous part of preparation was assembling all the ingredients and deciphering the splitting part of the instructions. After that, it was a breeze. I followed the recipe exactly except for using more saffron (relatively reasonably priced at Trader Joe's). It was a special celebration dinner, so I was okay with the high cost of the ingredients, but having done it like that once, I now know you could easily leave out the lobster tails and reduce the cost considerably. Really, you could leave out the scallops, too, but they were so tasty! Beware: what everybody says about the quantity this recipe makes, is true! I filled a 20" diameter platter with a mountain of paella 9" high.

Great recipe! I had a dinner party for 10 and still had left-overs. Served gazpacho soup beforehand and flan for dessert. I omitted the Italian sausage, chicken, mussels and lobster, but used white fish (grouper), shrimp, scallops and clams. I roasted 4 colors of peppers and they were beautiful when served on top. This recipe got rave reviews from my guests!

I decided to tackle this dish for a mother's day dinner for 12. I think I read every single review and here are the changes I made: Not a huge seafood crowd, so I adjusted and used 2lbs of shrimp, five chicken breasts, and 12 drumsticks, 1.5 lbs of chorizo - that's it. I cut up one link of chorizo and mixed it with the onions and tomatoes and grilled the rest to serve with the rest of the meat. Since peppers are expensive right now, I only did one green and one red and they added a nice touch. So don't be afraid to do less than the written 9 peppers. The spice rub is excellent - my texture was more saucy, but it smelled wonderful and gave a great flavor. I also used less cayenne. I used long grain rice and made a little extra since there were a lot of people and we have tons of leftovers. As I'm reading the recipe, I'm realizing I completely forgot to put the peas in...oh well. Don't forget to do that! They add another veggie to balance out the massive amounts of rice and meat. I'm not sure the saffron is essential...I know its a common ingredient in paella, but the stock and clam juice combo make a wonderful broth as is. So if you're looking to save money on the ingredients, I think you can skip the saffron. All in all, it got good reviews from my family. I'm interested in making different recipes of paella to see what variations there are. Enjoy!

I've made this twice now for large gatherings. I make the chorizo soffrito the day before, as well as grill all the vegetables and chicken. I get the largest aluminum foil pan that fits my grill and make the whole thing on the grill. Just cover with some foil and it's failproof. Because I made it for a huge crowd, I didn't add the lobster. Just shrimp, clams and mussels. Served with a nice salad and crusty bread - great dish for entertaining!

Great recipe to use as a guide. I've made slightly-modified versions of this dish since the recipe came out in print in the early 90s. My changes: Use boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs. I marinate them in 1/2 the herb paste and then have the husband put them on the grill (no char, just nicely grilled). I coat the scallops with a bit of the herb paste and oil and grill them too. I use Jasmin rice...so what if it's not authentic? Looks/tastes fantastic. I saute the chorizo, italian sausage, oil, onion, tomato, salt pork, etc in a large dutch oven, then add the rice and coat it with the mixture - adding the wine, stock, saffron, etc. Cover and cook like pilaf etc. For seafood: I use clams, mussels, squid, and scallops. All (except the scallops) are steamed in one of the dutch-ovens with white wine, garlic, and some of the herb paste...I usually start cooking the seafood when the rice has 5 minutes left until done. When the rice is done, I open the lid, fluff everything with chopsticks and pile the whole glorious mess on a huge platter. I then arrainge the grilled chicken and peppers strips on top, and add the seafood (strain the stock through a fine chinoise and spoon that over as well if desired.) Hit the platter with some chopped parsley - and voila! GORGEOUS, sumptious dinner.

My dinner guests told me this was the best dish I ever served. I think the herb paste is crucial but after reading other reviews, I decided to go with long grain rice as well, skipped the fish and used shrimp, clams, mussels and scallops instead. I also used Applewood smoked bacon instead of the ham/pork and used a pack of chicken andouille sausages instead of chorizo. My main challenge was finding enough large vessels to cook everything in. To make sure the mussels and clams were properly cooked, I made them separately in a large pot of boiling water with an "Adobo" seasoning package (made by Goya) and then displayed them on top of my 2 big paella pans that were loaded with everything else. This recipe is a keeper. Labor intensive but oh, so worth it.

Rating: 2
I followed this recipe pretty much exactly....although the end result was very tasty, the cost and prep time make it almost prohibitive. I would estimate several hours of prep and cooking time and well over 50$ of ingredients. To save on your pocketbook, you could easily eliminate the lobster tails and substitute shrimp... In addition, the resulting dish serves well more than 8! One could easily cut this in 1/2 to serve 8 adults! There must be something a bit simpler and as good....

This is a wonderfully flavorful and complex paella. Very time consuming, but worth it. The fresh herb mixture really takes it over the top. It was too cold to grill outside, so, after browning, I added everything but the peppers to the pan and put it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes total. Added the seafood for the last 20 minutes. Grilled the peppers in a grill pan and added them with the peas for the 15 minute resting time after taking from oven. I made about 2/3 of the recipe for 6 people and still had a lot left over. I changed up the seafood combination--used shrimp, scallops, mussels, and lobster. My guests oohed and aahed all through the meal. I served with a salad of mixed greens, orange, fennel and black olves and sangria IV from this site.

Made it to excellent results, despite taking lots of liberties -- we don't get all the ingredients here in India. One portion, in fact, didn't have pork because of the diner's sensibilities. Didn't grill the chicken separately, let it cook with the rice. Used only jumbo prawns, fish steaks and white wine and crumbled the hot sausage while adding it to the dish. Lots of leftovers, but am not complaining!

Rating: 2
The chicken paste was excellent. I used jumbo shrimp and only added the last 20 minutes and they were overdone. The rice (I used medium grain rice specifically made for Paella) was too sticky and very unpleasant to the palate; it ruined the end result. If I make this again, I will definitely use long grain rice (Uncle Ben's) and cook for shorter amount of time to ensure the rice doesn't split. Finally, the rice was not as yellow as some Paella's I've had, it was more green due to the chicken paste (!!??).

WOW great recipe. worth the effort. Many opportunities for adjustments. I omitted ham and salt pork-cooked 1/2# bacon in large pot, removed cooked bacon (added at end) and used the grease to start. Used all spices - and white wine vs red- for the 'marinade' which is incredible. no italian sausage, fish or lobster. halved the onion,liquids and rice, but added 2 extra garlic cloves. 1 generous tsp cayenne plenty. Used 2 chorizo and 2 anduille; 12 clams,2# mussels, 3/4#shrimp and one small chicken cut up. Grilled 1 of each pepper then put in paper bag a bit before peeling, coring and slicing. cooked all in one huge heavy bottom pot - everything cooked perfectly. Lemon and lime wedges when serving a must. And don't forget the peas. Made a ton of food even with all the reductions and omissions. Leftovers yummy too.

I read and reread many times over the reviews of this recipe before finally deciding to make it for new year's with friends. Just as everyone said, it was worth the effort! I prepared the chicken and chorizo the night before, which was a must for me. I cut the recipe in half since there were just 4 of us but enough leftovers for 4 more servings plus! My only suggestion that has not already been mentioned is to take the tails off the shrimp beforehand. Other than that this recipe was devine.

I made this dish for the second time last month and it came out better than the first time I made it which was years ago. Yes it takes at lest two days of prep and yes it feeds way more people than the recipe states but if you like paella,this is the one to try.

This was the best Father's Day Special!! with all the rave reviews, I knew I had discovered a keeper. Substitutions: a few slices of bacon instead of the chunks of salt pork, omitted the ham, long grain rice because of someones advice that it doesn't clump, extra shrimp, no fish or lobster, no clams and fixed about 30 mussles..Dad's fav, doubled up on chicken thighs, deboned with skin on, and a boneless skinless turkey breast, chunked, treated to the same rub marinade and grill as the chicken, added a jar of quartered grilled artichoke hearts. At the part when you cook the rice, with all the ingredients on the top, I didn't have a good cooking surface for a large pan to cook the rice so that it all cooked evenly, I hate raw crunchy rice surprises, and that has happened with paella in the past for me. So, in a larger cast iron pan, (the same one used for the prep of everything else, resulting in not loosing any of the drippings/flavours) I put the onion/saugage mixture, stirfried the rice for the 5 minutes, added the broth and let it slow simmer for 25 minutes. Once it was nicely cooked through, transfered it to my large baker for the shallow rice base that you need for paella, and arranged all the amazing meats, raw seafood and vegies. (Mussels were steamed sepearately ) The pan/roaster was in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes, flavours were amazing and presentation perfect and all the rice cooked to perfection. The only thing I missed was that authentic crust at the bottom of the pan you get when you order it in Spain!! And for that I need a real paella pan and a wood stove...someday, a villa in Spain...hmmm, until then, this took me there in aroma and flavour!!.

Halved the recipe and it fed a family of six with leftovers. Everyone loved it, but the telling remark came from my 10 year old granddaughter...Granddad, this is very, very, very, very GOOD! I used a 6 qt. paella pan and ran out of room so I cut back a little on the peppers (about 3) which seemed to be plenty. Cooked the seafood seperately. I used a large covered roasting pan to steam everything in one bottle of clam juice, one 14 oz can of chicken broth and a bit of white wine. I cut up a 1. 5 lb. lobster tail and added it to the steaming broth. After abouit seven minutes i added a bag of mussels, 2 tilapia filets and a hand full of red pepper strips I saved for decoration. Total time for steaming was about 14 minutes. I used about 3/4 lb. of precooked shrimp that I layered on top of the rice about five minutes before serving. I removed the lid of the paella pan and simply stacked all the other seafood on top to serve. It made a huge mound, but it looked pretty impressive. In addition to the lemon and lime wedges, I provided heated butter dishes at each place and that went over really well! About three tbs. of melted butter with a dash of garlic salt for each. It took at least 4-5 hours (first time), but it was well worth it and I will certainly be making it again.

Yum! I made half of this recipe and it generously served 6 people, including seconds. The spice paste for the chicken is a must-do. That's one thing that really makes this stand out. I used chicken, chorizo, clams, mussels, 16/20 size shrimp, and bay scallops. For the chicken, I used both drumettes and four boneless thighs cut into bite-size peices. Next time I will do 100% thigh meat, and more of it too; maybe eight boneless thighs. You cannot stuff enough chicken or chorizo into this; it really makes the dish heartier when it's served. I used clams and I put them in at the start. I added mussels halfway through, but they came out a bit underdone and should have gone in at the start too. There was no more room left to poke things into the rice, so I just sprinkled it all on top and it came out just right. I did everything ahead of time and just asembled it to do the final 30 minutes of cooking. I browned the chicken and the chorizo separately and put it aside. I did the whole onions & tomato mixture and set it aside, but I did keep the seafood raw. For the very last assembly step, I warmed up the onion base in the pan and tossed it with the dry rice for about five minutes. I added a splash of wine and the broth, brought it back to a boil, poked all the chicken chorizo and clams into it, and cooked it at a simmer for about 20 minutes. With 10 minutes left, I put a big handful of bay scallops and about a pound of shrimp on top of everything. I would use halved sea scallops and more shrimp next time. After it was done I put it in a low oven and kept it for another 15 minutes while we had salad, put the whole steaming pan on the table for people to serve themselves, and it turned out perfectly! It took about three hours total, I think, but you can do a lot of it ahead or even the day before. Perfect for a dinner party.

I've used this recipe as a base a number of times, and have been really pleased with the results (altho I've cut a lot of the work off of this.) First, I've reduced the sausage amount by half, and used anduille. Second, I've used my own chipotle-based spice rub for chicken (which gives a nice smokey flavor for those who don't have a grill). Brown the chicken in the paella pan and finish either on grill or in oven). I omitted tomatoes, ham and salt pork and used apple-smoked bacon. I also used a long grain rice which gives a totally different feel to the dish, and is much less sticky. I omit the fish and use whatever shellfish is handy - but I never forget to use mussels - this dish really brings out their sweetness. Also, i omit the clam juice and use dark beer and chicken stock. I've made this recipe as written and it was far too meaty for me. Using the modifications above, i've gotten nothing but rave reviews from everyone who's tried it. Also, served with sangria and a rich chocolate dessert. Really, really good.

Although there were a lot of ingredients, I didn't find the recipe that labor intensive. It was so much fun to make. I marinated the chicken legs overnight with the paste. Wow! they were delicious. I heeded the advice of other reviews, left out the lobster, put the clams in for 25min and the other fish in for 15. Used less clam juice - couldn't find Spanish chorizo and substituted Andouille. My rice wasn't quite done after 25 min. and I needed to add a little bit more liquid. Other than that, it was great. Everyone loved it. I would definately make it again for a special occasion.

Rating: 4
Many reviewiers suggested putting the seafood in "at the last minute". I put them in with 10 minutes to go. This worked fine for everything except the clams. Clams take more time to cook than mussels, shrimp, etc. I would suggest putting in the clams for the full 25 minutes and the rest for 10.

Okay, I am in the middle of making this dish for a party tomorrow. I have a few simple observations. Though I am doubling it, it is mad expensive. You're looking at 2+ beans *easy* for a double batch. Second, anyone who attempts this on their own without getting through half of it the day before is a stark raving booby. It's very time-consuming. Between scrounging up the interminable list of ingredients and cooking them, you're talking *several* hours. (Depends on your cooking speed, but don't think you're going to pull this one out of your hat four hours before service when you've yet to hit the store). While I love to cook -- even for umpteen straight hours -- I am not so sure about this one. The chicken marinade smells spectacular, but the cooked chorizo mixture might not past muster at a dog show. (Yes, I used high quality ingredients -- including $20/pound serrano ham). Will fill in the blanks tomorrow with the end result....

i don't know about this one. i tried to make it for xmas for a party of 12. it came out so-so. i made it in a huge paella pan, which may have been my mistake? i also used arborio rice, which came out soggy, not rice with a bite to it. my mom, who is a paella lover, said that the flavor was definately authentic but i just needed to practice this. anyone else have similar problems?

Absolutely delicious! I made this for a dinner party of 10 and everyone raved about it. It's a simple dish but quite time consuming - I made the chorizo mixture and the chicken legs the night before. I used 10 legs - couldn't get Spanish chorizo so used another reviewers suggestion and substituted andouille sausage with great results. I used a very large paella pan rather than the 2 dutch ovens and it worked beautifully. I used only 3 cups of rice and cut back a bit on the stock and clam juice, one lb of clams, no mussels, halibut, shrimp and skipped the lobster. Only used 6 peppers and it was plenty. Next time I'll throw in some scallops. This made a huge amount of food - everyone had large servings plus seconds and I still had leftovers!

Alot has been said about this recipie and it is excellent. It feeds eight....if they are NFL lineman, I fed a party of 12 and had leftovers. A couple of modifications: 1. cut the number of bell peppers in half and added two cans of artichoke hearts. I did not grill the vegetables but fried them in olive oil until al dente; 2. eight chicken legs are not enough, this should be doubled at least; 3. this is labor intensive and it is a good idea to prepare the Chorrizo (if you like canjun, substitute Andoulle sausage) ahead of time as recommended.

Yum! I would recommend cutting down on the clam juice and use low salt broth. A little too salty and I love salt. Also, I love hot food but used good judgement and cut the 1 T cayennne down to 1 t and it was PLENTY spicy, esp with those peppercorns. But my cayenne is extra hot(90,000 btu). I used scallops and not lobster or fish. Extra prawns and 18 chicken legs and clams, no mussells. I put the seafood in at the very last minute and it was perfect. I cant imagine how overcooked it would have been if I'd let it go 25 minutes + 15! The peppers were a nice touch.

This is only the second time I have made paella but this is by far the better of the recipes I have tried. Don't be intimidated by the number of ingredients; there is little special preparation required of the ingredients. I made a minor mistake in getting hot mexican chorizio rather than the milder spanish variety. That made the dish plenty spicy. I liked it that way but others thought it was a bit too spicy. The spiciness was toned down by serving a sweet Morrocan salad with it. The salad was easy to prepare; Bibb lettuce tossed with powdered sugar, Mandarin oranges, dates and rice wine vinegar. Add a little sour dough bread and a wine and this is a great dinner.

This dish was amazing and worth every minute it takes. Here are some suggestions I have learned and read about that should help. Make sure to have alot of stock on hand, homemade it better here. Saffron makes this dish so doubling that is great and using risotto is the best. I also included; Grouper, Halibut, Sea Scallops among other seafood and found clams hard to find. I also used the Shrimp shells in the chicken stock like someone eluded too. Yum and you can save a little $$. I also found cooking the items separately and assembling at the end to heat and serve preserves the rice and allows more people to help which is important and fun. Also having a bottle of red and white wine open for cooking and drinking is the way to go. I combined this recipe with two others and am in complete love with seafood paella. If you follow the above recipe allow about 3 hours or so and make sure you can have lots of left overs. This dish is spectacular the 2nd and 3rd day. I would rate it 5 forks if I could.

I'm interested in trying this recipe, but would like some advice first. Could someone tell me if I could use just one Dutch oven and cut out some of the dividing and juggling if I simply half this recipe? It sounds like it would still serve 8 people if not more. Any advice on simplifying this would be appreciated. Thank you.

I've been making this paella since I first read the recipe in my copy of Bon Appetit back when it was first published in the mid-90s. It is one of the best things I ever make. I assume no one would make this who was daunted by reading the recipe, so most people who do are not afraid of the work. Never fails to thrill the guests. But it's really just a suggestion. I use whatever mollusks I find and in the quantity I like, and I rarely add lobster, or even white fish, which doesn't come out well. It's a bit of a zuppa espagnole at times, but always immensely tasty and popular.

Results shimmered like jewels in the candlelight when I served it on a copper platter! Raves all around. Was better than we had in Spain. I used authentic paella rice and did it all in one pot. Grilling chicken would add dimension but I had no time. A bit of effort but a beauty for a buffet.

Not having two dutch ovens on hand we threw everything into one pot, which required some juggling but worked out fine. We added some scallops and beautiful purple peppers into the mix, and the result was good the first day and even better the second.

Way too complex to enjoy after all the trouble of making. Although I admit that the chicken marinade is quite tasty and can be made separately from this dish as an entree unto itself. Overall, if you have the time and enjoy the details, its worth it. Otherwise, there is simpler and tastier fare.

Busy work is not in the doing--it's following the recipe! I found the manner in which words "divide, half, remaining" were used to be disconcerting. I had to read & re-read too many times. Chorizo in my area is almost like pepperoni. Removing the casing was difficult & I pre-crumbled---don't think that would have broken up easily in Dutch oven--agree with others--way too much of this ingredient. Short grain rice made dish too much like risotto. I have a simple Jambalaya recipe that results in same taste, far less work & expense. Agree with 11/24/98, but I do like addition of flavor of grilled peppers; with grill going it's no big deal to bolster taste of sausage & chick as well.

This was a beautiful dish. I followed suggestions from others and substituted scallops for the fish fillets. I even omitted the clams as I couldn't find any. Watch overcooking all the seafood: put it in at the last possible moment. Clam juice imparts a strong seafood flavor, I might reduce that by one fourth next time. Use the freshest bell peppers you can find, they really stand out in this, so don't settle for less. I'll halve the recipe, as I'm still trying to get back all the tupperware from giving so much of this away.

Thank you to everyone who posted with their comments - it helped me tremendously! I grilled the swordfish and scallops (which I subsituted for the clams)and added right before serving. Next time, I'll grill the prawns as well (they were a tiny bit overdone). I used the shrimp shells for the stock as advised - much less expensive/time consuming than chix broth and much more tasty. Everyone loved it! I found real Jamon, Spanish Chorizo....wonderful. I served with Tapas to start, and served a wonderful sangria with the meal and ended with flan. YUM! Lots of work, but well worth the effort (and admiration from my guests)

Delicious! I made this for a party of 12, but it was enough for about 24! Everyone said it was the best paella they've ever had, including two restauranteurs and one professional chef. I've eaten paella in Spain, and I think this was truly as good if not better. I left out the lobster (too expensive) and substituted fresh scallops, and also fresh peas. Well worth the many hours of preparation!

Absolutely delicious! It was well worth the effort..and what an effort it was. Took me several hours to prepare, even with an additional hand in the kitchen. Substituted swordfish for the sea bass filets and cut out the chicken. We could have fed a small army! Definately the recipie to use when you have a penchant for paella.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made it for company and they raved. I omitted the Halibut and the ham, and used 2-Fresh Lobsters instead of the tails. I just added the Lobster claw and leg meat to the mix after grilling. This recipe is relatively simple, although the ingredient list can be a little daunting. It makes 8 very large portions.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! This is a seafood-lover's delight and would make any holiday or special family dinner! I am exstatic to have found this recipe after having lost the original 10 yrs. ago. I thought I would have to go to my friend's basement and search her back issues to find this irreplaceable recipe! Was in a huge hurry when I made this again and tried to combine a simple version with this one for the yummy ingredients. I ended up doing this recipe anyway, omitting the fish, ham, and salt pork, and the Italian hot sausage (because I was in such a hurry I forgot to buy it)! There are no difficult steps in this recipe, just many steps requiring lots of bowls and time. This is not something to whip out in a hurry, but is fun to do with help. You can bet I will be making this again. Thank you for this website!!

Excellent! I was going between 3 Paella recipes but mostly followed this one for authenticy & flavor. I omitted the lobster, fish, ham & salt pork & used 8 chicken legs/8 thighs, 1-2 clams & 1-2 mussels/pp, 2 large shrimp/pp. Next time I would use 1 hot Italian (turkey)sausage/pp. I used 5+ cups (2 very lrge) chopped onion, 1# tomatoes, 3 lrge. bell pepper - 1 of ea. color, peas, & medium grain rice (next time I would used long grain which doesn't stick together as much). I used 1 cup of clam juice (1 bottle) & 5 cups of chicken broth for 4 cups of rice. Looking at the different recipes, quantites and serving/pp was so confusing. Rice varied from 1/4 c./pp to 1/2?? I served this to 8 but as it reads this recipe is definetly for 10-12 depending on how much seafood & meat you put in. I would add the lobster for a special dinner. Great flavor and presentation. Don't skip the grilling step.

This recipe is now a Christmas Eve classic at our house. The family loves it. What would we do if it disappeared from the website! It's very spicy but it's devoured that way at our house. It splits and doubles well. The first year I split it in half. By the next year, word got out so I prepared it by one and a half times. Soon after, we doubled it. I leave out the lobster (budget), the ham and the fish (too dry and not needed with all of the other delicacies) add a few extra clams and mussels. When ordering the chicken, make sure you ask for "drummettes" or you'll end up with huge chicken legs that take up way too much room in the pan and the belly. I used powdered saffron once and it wasn't as tasty as the threads.

I am Spanish and learned to make Paella in Valencia in 1964. Since then, have gone on Paella hunting expeditions. There are tons of ways to make adequate Paella. This recipe is excellent. Major problem is baking the fish too long. Recommend sautee the fish separate for 2-3 minutes and add to the dish in the oven for the last 5 minutes only.

Serves eight? Eight what? Starving refugees? It was a wonderful recipe, a lot of work as stated before, and we fed twelve with lots of leftovers. We omitted the lobster and no one noticed. I might wait longer to put in the fish, it was overdone. A great combination of flavors.

I have made this dish several times each summer for nearly 10 years. We have "Paella Parties". This is by far the best paella I have ever eaten. It is a lot of work, but it is well worth it.

This recipe is a lot of work, period. Be prepared for it. On the other hand the results are amazing and truly wonderful, but pricey. The ingredients here in Atlanta ran roughly $100 (11/99). One of the most unusual and delicious items in the recipe is the spice mixture, keep that as something in your kitchen files by itself. In one outing, we skipped the lobster tails, (beyond the budget) and no one missed them. Figure the whole afternoon, if you work well, but my guests still talk about it.

This is a special dish to make when you have time. It was delicious! The grilling added a luscious smoky flavor you couldn't get with one pot. I cut the recipe in half and it made enough for 6. I would also omit some of the sausage ... it's too heavy on the sausage for my tastes. This recipe came the closest I've found to the flavors of the best paellas I've had in Spain.

The recipe starts out sounding very good, but there is way to much busy work. paella is more of a one pot dish, in this recipe you have a person going from the kitchen to the grill outside and then back and fourth. I personnelly think you need to go back to the one pot idea, brown the chicken in the dutch oven, remove and add the rest of ingredients, put the chicken back and let it all cook together, just like jambalaya.
