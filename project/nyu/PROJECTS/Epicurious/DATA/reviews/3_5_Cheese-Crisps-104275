I have not made this yet, but I can't wait! Thanks to all of you who had suggestions about amounts etc. Chicago: If you are such an expert, maybe you shouldn't be reading others' reviews.

I thought the recipe was great!! I was however, very disapointed in the reviewer from Chicago. It might not be that everyone has a knack for cooking, and many people need help in the recipe department. It would seem that if you feel the need to look down upon others, keep it to yourself next time. We are all friends here, and calling people stupid just doesn't seem appropriate. Good luck to all those cooks out there, and keep trying new things. It will all come together in good time!!!

The reviewer from Chicago spelled confit wrong.

This is another good use for the Pepperidge Farm frozen puff pastry. However, this recipe is written with too little instruction, especially for someone who has not used puff pastry before. For a detailed version of this recipe, search for the one called: Spicy Cumin Cheese Straws. It gives all the info you need. It also calls for a 425 degree oven, which is better than 350F. For this recipe, you really do not have to roll the pastry any thinner than it already is. Use the rolling pin to press in the cheese and pepper. If it gets too thin, just fold it in half. One of the best ways I have had this is to unfold the pastry, sprinkle with blue cheese and walnuts. Fold it in half. Press lightly with a rolling pin. Cut the pastry into strips, then into squares. Bake as above. So easy! Everyone loves this type of cheese pastry treat. It is a natural with a glass of wine.

My gandchildern and I made these for a party and they were really a big hit, a must have at other partys that we plan. It is easy enough for the young people to make and tastes adult enough for any party.

This has been a huge hit at 3 parties now! For those wanting specifics: I fine-grated about 1/3 - 1/2 cup of each cheese (2/3 - 1 cup total), mixed with about 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or to taste; I added more each successive batch), then spread over both sheets of a package of Pepperidge Farm puff-pastry dough (unfold but don't roll out). Make sure to separate the cut strips for maximum rising. Delicious!

I followed the instructions given by the cook from Los Angeles. These were the hit of the evening. Definitely a keeper.

lovely recipe... it's quite a crowd-pleaser! I'm suprised the Chicago reviewer enjoyed it; it's not bitter at all.

For the STUPID people (you know who you are) who insist on exact ratios and measurements, let me say that cooking isn't chemistry. If you had an ounce of intelligence in you, you could adapt this recipe. If you had an aounce of creativity, you could use this recipe as a springboard. If you had any power of observation at all, you could pretty much tell for yourselves when the dish was done or whether it needed a hotter oven, etc. Don't crucify the author for giving you the benefit of the doubt, you Cretins. That being said, I made this dish with a nice double Gloucster and some tolerable Asiago, and it was great as it was. Next time I would vary it a bit, treating it as a sort of crostini. Some capers and duck confite, a roasted red capsicum pepper and some anchovies, etc. All in all- a fine recipe for a cheesey, crunchy appetizer.

The baked results were gooey, the flavor of the chesses and the cayenne simply disappeared. They puffed up nicely in the oven but then collapsed. I would not try these again.

ok, do i use all of the dough? how thick should it be? could you give me a ROUGH idea of the suggested amount of cheese as a ratio to the dough, for example. does the dough rise? the idea sounds good but i'm baffled as to the rest of it.

How much cheese goes over the "crust"? How thick should the "crust" be rolled?????

Roll the cheese into the dough and twist the ends. Although this is a rather fragile (not good for dipping)cracker-type food, it has always been a tremendous hit at parties. The first time I made this I put it on the buffet, went into the kitchen, came back 15 minutes later, and it was gone. PS - Pepperidge Farm frozen puff pastry is an excellent choice if you haven't got access, or the time to make, fresh puff pastry.

Didn't try it - how thin or thick should it be rolled out and cut>
