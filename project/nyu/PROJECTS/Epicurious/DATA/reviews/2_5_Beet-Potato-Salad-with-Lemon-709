Tasty, lets the beets shine. I added lemon zest, which was great.

It's OK. Nothing special.

We frequent Meskerem and they now make this sans the beets. Double the potatoes, add ground white pepper, and you have a delicious potato salad that needs to refrigeration at a picnic!

Such an excellant recipe. I had friends and family over for dinner. I made this beet salad to go with grilled pork and beef; it was so very tasty. Everyone wanted this simple recipe. It's terrific with lemon juice. In addition, I love it with rice vinegar. muah!

I made this refreshing salad for an international dinner recently. The salad was a big hit and was very fresh tasting! I used red onion and 1/2 a pablano. Be sure to rinse your cooked beets after cubing to avoid turning your salad fushia!

Wow! I have been looking for this recipie for a long while now. I had it when it was initially published in BA many years ago. It is very tasty! The lemon is a wonderful surprise! The flavours in this dish complement each other nicely. I am glad to have found it once again! I will be making it soon!

I make this salad very often. It is very good. My husband and other guests who are not particularly fond of beets love it too! Very easy and perfect with grilled foods.
