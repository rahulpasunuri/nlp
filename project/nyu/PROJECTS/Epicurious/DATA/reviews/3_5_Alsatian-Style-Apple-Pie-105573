This is my favorite desert recipe ever. People cant seem to get enough when i serve it. Yes - recipe makes too much custard but I like to fill pie to the top. I use a mixture of apples (i.e. Fuji,honey crisp, etc..) to keep it interesting. The combination of the custard and the fruit is irresistible.

Was the perfect complement to Choucroute garnie and Salade Vigneronne ... The pie was very light and not too sweet.

delicious, I made the custard as described, used 5 granny smith and 3 golden delicious apples, and made 2 pies. For the top I used a crumb mixture of sugar, flour, cinnamon, and butter, very good recipe.

Since so many said they had leftover custard, only made 1/3 of the recipe. Perfect amount. But would use different apples next time.

I have made this two or three times since last fall, and it is one of my favorite pies of all time. I think the custard-apple comination is perfect and different from a simpler apple pie. So if you like custard, you will likely also like this pie. I can't speak for the crust, since I just used the recipe I am used to (and the recipe I know I like). I also like that it is a single crust pie because I'm not the greatest pie crust fan generally. I love this apple pie!

I had the same problem as others with excess filling. Otherwise everybody loved it, especially kids. Worth doing again.

This recipe was a real disappointment. The crust was heavy, flavorless and dry, and the custard was uninteresting and overabundant. I'll stick with good old-fashioned apple pie!

This is an excellent recipe. I had too much custard however to fit in the pie shell. Next time I will reduce the custard by half.

Fantastic! This is the best apple pie I've ever made. It was hit with the family

I loved the filling but the crust is just so-so. I will use my own pastry recipe--faster and easier--next time.
