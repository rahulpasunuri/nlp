Excellent! Better than most of the local restaurant chowders and we live in Massachusetts! I used Idaho Russet potatoes and left the skins on; also used fried bacon (so that it was crispy). It is important to let it boil "vigorously" at the 10 minutes as indicated in the recipe. That is when everything will emulsify.

Good basic recipe, but I added 1 diced celery stalk, 2 minced shallots, 1 minced garlic clove, and 1 t. of angustura bitters towards the end of cooking. Yum.

Not as good without the following tweaks: garlic, couple of celery stalks, sherry, couple of teaspoons of Old Bay seasoning.

I used bacon instead of salt pork, threw in some corn kernels and finely chopped celery. My boyfriend had two servings of the chowder, despite having just come home from dinner. I think this is a testament to how delicious this was.

Delicious! Stayed pretty faithful to the recipe, but couldn't afford fresh cod. So, I substituted fresh tilapia. One other small change that might help with the folks who found this to be watery -- I added a couple of tablespoons of all purpose flour after the onions (and celery, added that, too) were cooked. Let that cook for a while and then added potatoes and broth. Yummy and very authentic tasting!

Made this with a mix of cubed fish,plus added a diced fennel bulb with the onions and fresh chopped dill-- delicious. I also added a squirt of sriracha for a little kick.

Made the fish stock using tilapia head and bones. When making the soup, made a few changes. I don't eat pork so i just left out the salt pork. I used a combination of turnips and potatos and also a few carrots in the soup. For fish, I used monkfish, sea trout, and cod. I had a similar problem to some of the others in the the soup was watery. I hit it with an immersion blender a little bit and then cooked it for another few minutes and it thickened up beautifully. Since I didn't use the salt pork, I needed a different flavor so I battered and fried maitake mushrooms and put them on top as a garnish. All in all, amazing. Can't wait to have leftovers today and see how good it is after the flavors meld.

The recipe followed meticulously resulted in a watery, but flavourful soup with large chunks of fish. I tried to thicken it by mashing many of the potatoes (Klondike Rose) and even adding some cornstarch; all to no avail. Probably a more starchy potato would help. gw

This was delicious but not exceptional, possibly because of the changes I made. I used frozen fish - haddock as well as catfish - and stock from a box. I also used nonfat half-and-half. Otherwise I followed it, in half. What kept it from being exceptional was the taste, not the texture (which was perfect - loved the smashed potatoes); just felt the flavor could have been a little deeper. Maybe more thyme next time. But I reserve my final evaluation for tomorrow when , as jjanemin posted, the flavors may have more time to meld.

Instead of salt pork, I use chicken or turkey sausage cut into dice. Bacon works, too.

My husband is an avid fisherman, and in the summers in Maine we are often lucky enough to have fresh striped bass. We have experimented with dozens of recipes, but this chowder recipe is by far the most delicious. When we serve it to guests they always say it's the best fish chowder they have ever tasted. The salt pork, fresh thyme, and fresh fish are the key. Absolutely yummy every time!

I made this chowder and had it for dinner... very disappointed... decided it should get only 2 forks. Had some leftover the next day and found, to my amazement, that it was the best chowder I'd ever eaten and was now worthy of 4 forks. This is DELICIOUS and worth the wait for the flavors to meld. I will absolutely make it again... a day ahead of time.

Did not have either fish broth, nor the bones for making it. Had only a pound of cod filets purchased on sale, some potatoes in need of using, and some vegetable broth made in the slow cooker a week previously. Made about half the recipe, more or less. I did buy salt pork, somewhat reluctantly as I had never used any and was uncertain what it would do that bacon wouldn't. Obviously bacon would have been good, but I'm now a salt pork convert. The cracklings were delicious, though next time I will follow the directions more closely and start out over a low rather than medium heat. Used celery in addition to onion, as I had some that needed to be used. Used thyme as that was what was available. Had organic potatoes so left the skins on. Used about 3 cups--perhaps a smidge less--of veg. broth to cover probably 1 1/2 lbs. potatoes which were coursely diced. My potatoes were yellowish ones that held their shape well so I used the potato masher in the pot to mash nearly half of the potatoes. Fearful that the soup would be too bland due to vegetable broth, I used 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika along with salt and pepper. Did not cut up filets before cooking. Used only 1/2 cup of half and half as I'm constitutionally incapable of putting cream in soups. This by no means made it a lean soup as it still has fat from the salt pork, butter and the half and half, not to mention the potatoes and substantial fish chunks. It was really, really good.

This seems like a great recipe to play around with: I've used 1-2 tsp. smoked salt instead of pork, coconut milk instead of cream and added clams, salmon and celery. Both my husband and I like it this way too!

As many other reviewers, I also used bacon, chicken broth, and diced the potatoes. I had fresh tarragon, so I used that instead of chives or parsley (in the mira poix, not as a garnish). Used cod, jumbo prawns, canned clams with juice, and baby scallops. Served with a sourdough baguette and green salad. Great comfort food.

very good,living in Maine I have ample supply of fresh fish right off the boat. I always add a dash of Bay Seasoning to my seafood dishes,along with a little extra dry Vermouth in chowdahs. I also add the fish WHOLE, never cut at the end of cooking,turn off the heat, cover for half hour allowing the fish to cook and break apart easily at the end

I used 4 pieces of diced bacon as the base. Crisped it and reserved the meat for topping with chives and parsley. Didn't have fish broth so used chicken broth and added canned clams and their juice and it was great. Had a couple russet potatoes and a yukon on hand and I really think the way to go with this is to use what you have and build. Sword fish and sea bass was what I had in the freezer and they blended wonderfully. I look forward to left overs. One bay leaf and some fresh thyme sprigs which I pulled out when adding the fish. Used a but of pimente d'Espelette. Bread dipped in the broth was oh-so-good.

This fish chowder is incredible. I took the tips from reviewer Elecampane from New England and left out the bay leaf along with the pork or bacon, as I used extra butter instead. I added a half cup of milk to the 1 1/2 cup of cream and used the Strong Fish Stock, which I had kicked up a bit with the addition of more fish heads. Heads, fish frames and fish fillets were all king and Spanish mackerel. The results were so incredible. Best fish chowder I have ever tasted and the richness of the stock along with texture from potatoes in the chowder were perfect.

I have reviewed this already, and I have made it several times. I now add diced celery in with the onions and I add some frozen corn during the last 5 minutes. We thought that both additional ingredients, the corn in particular, really make this even more wonderful!

Just made this today, and it turned out great! Because I can never stick to a recipe, here's what I adjusted: -Made bacon for breakfast, then used the fat and dripping and one slice of bacon instead of the salt pork. -Added three small spines of celery and three cloves of garlic when cooking the onion. -Used dried thyme -Tossed in some left over shrimp cocktail shrimp right before the onions were done cooking. Putting this in early, right before the stock (I used chicken) allowed the stock to become more fish-esque as it cooked.) -Used a mixture of cod and tilapia -Used fat free half and half. It's definitely not a "thick" chowder, but I bet it will be thicker after sitting in the fridge for a day. My mom lives in Maine, and this turned out better than the one we made this summer. I really love this kind of fish chowder, and will definitely make this again!

Rating: 4
Very, very good. I adapted a bit from previous testers' suggestions. Used 6 slices of diced bacon, 2 cups of Kitchen Basics Seafood Stock, 3 cups College Inn Chix Broth and the heavy cream would not have sat well so I purchased light cream with some whole milk for back-up (we usually only have skim). Used just the light cream - 2 cups. Also added 1 tsp. of kosher salt and figured those wanting more salt and pepper could adjust to their liking. Topped with the crispy bacon pieces. An added touch (and this from someone who finds the heavy cream too much) is a pat of butter just before serving. Also, this was not thick - for fish chowder, that's fine with me.

Also - just remembered - I didn't even bother chopping the thyme - just through it and pulled the stems out later. So easy.

This was amazing. Very easy and delicious. My husband and I thought it may be the best fish chowder ever! We live on the Cape and love chowder - so that is saying a lot.

Delicious and very filling.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. Like another reviewer, my chowder was so salty as to be inedible. As per the instructions, I "oversalted" slightly near the start, but when combined with the pork, it was way too much! Even if I hadn't oversalted, however, I found the overall flavour to be bland and I would still have given this recipe a poor review. There are chowder recipes out there that are way better - I plan to use one of these in the future.

I make this often--the whole family loves it (even the picky one.) I use the Trader Joe's Cod. If you get the kids to peel the potatoes, this recipe is no work at all. I use chicken broth and throw in a can of clams and their juice. (Not the can itself, mind you.)

I'm sad to say that this recipe didn't work out for me at all. As a result of leaving the fat from the pork in the pot, which also left behind what I came to discover to be a ton of salt, the chowder was literally inedible. It was so salty that no one could eat it, and we had to dump it down the drain. This is the only recipe from epicurious that we've had to toss. But not being one to give up easily, especially after all the other good reviews, I'll try it again and next time I'll use uncured bacon instead of salt pork. Unfortunately, as it's written, it was a huge disappointment.

Rating: 2
There are some pretty good chowders listed in these reviews, but not very many authentic New England fish chowders. I appreciate that when cooking spontaneously all the ingredients might not be hand. A bit of thought will enable you to adapt what you have though. No salt pork?? Use bacon, but blanch the bacon for a few minutes to remove the smokiness, smokiness does not belong in chowder, it is for BBQ. If you prefer not to use pork products, use butter, it is also traditional. In my seventh decade of cooking chowder and eating chowder I have never had a chowder with bay leaves, chowder is delicate, bay leaves are distinctive. Thyme works well, but dont overdo. Chowder is one of the few white foods in which I use black pepper, that also works very nicely. For generations halibut has been the fish of choice in my family, use the bones for the stock. A starchy potato such as a russet serves to thicken the chowder nicely, if it is still too thin for your tastes, use arrowroot to thicken it. It does not get "gooey" like cornstarch or a roux will, but makes for a silky smooth chowder like you would get from using fresh heavy cream right from the dairy. Jasper White may be a successful businessman and chef, but he hasnt done that many favors for authentic New England seafood dishes. The intro to this recipe equated a classic New England chowder with zen, and that is correct..simplicity and purity are the essence of fine New England seafood cooking.

This is truly a beautiful soup. I usually like thick soups, but not the nasty gluey thickness of all chowders I've every had in restaurants. The potatoes and cream give this soup the perfect consistency. And please, please do not add Old Bay seasoning - it turns the refined delicacy of seafood into a vulgar one-taste-fits-all McChowder.

Excellent recipe. I used 3 frozen cod loins (from Costco - they held up very well), two cans of clams (with juice) 4 cups organic chicken broth, a can of corn (with juice) and fried up half a pound of bacon and added it after the loins. I also used 2 tbsp bacon drippings and two tbsp butter to saute the onion and herbs. The resulting flavor was amazing! I'm not a fan of fish stock but I love chowders and substituting clam juice, corn juice and chicken broth for the stock worked very well. My wife said it's the best chowder she's ever had but our 5 and 7 year old didn't care for it (oh well, more for us!)

I've made this a bunch of times now and it's my favourite chowder recipe by far. Still haven't gotten it to be as thick as I would like it though, even though I add several tbs of cornstarch. I can't find salt pork but use a type of fatty ham at the beginning, and leave this in with the soup as it doesn't get nice and crispy on its own; left in the soup it continues to give a nice flavour. Following this I add the cornstarch as mentioned and a combination of fish and chicken stocks - I like the flavour the two together impart. For a healthier version I usually use soy or oat cream instead of heavy cream, which is in my opinion just as good, and usually I only need about a cup. Oh yeah - and I always add chopped prawns and other seafood with the cod - delish!

And ate the leftovers the next day! I recommend this wholeheartedly.

I don't eat meat or fowl so I exclude the pork and make the Strong Fish Stock from frames that I acquired when buying whole wild salmon to make other recipes for the winter holidays. Using cod in this soup works just great, especially knowing you can save a few dollars with this less expensive (and healthy) fish. Also, I replace the cream with low-fat half and half. It's an absolutely wonderful soup for this time of year--a nice change from the holiday menus.

I made this for a birthday celebration in February...the "birthday boy" found the recipe and sent it to me! It was just wonderful- made it the day before using salt pork, bottled clam juice, canned clams, frozen cod (suggested at the fish counter)- really perfect- defrost, break in thirds and put in chowder- as it cooks and you stir, it breaks up beautifully. I used 2 C. light cream, 1/2 c. heavy cream and 1/2 c. milk- what I had in the frig. Nice and creamy. The guests requested the recipe- always a good sign. I've made this again with just milk- also yummy. Might be the best of the winter season! I froze the rest and we had it again tonight- my husband LOVES it.

Well! After reading all these stellar reviews, I just had to make this recipe. I used reduced fat kielbasa chopped up instead of salt pork (all I had on hand), and fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. I mashed up a few more potatoes to compensate for the loss of cream. Also, since I had no good fish stock available, I used chicken stock and experimented by adding a few dashes of Thai fish sauce. My husband LOVED it. Can't imagine how wonderful it would be with all the ingredients as written, but at least this is something I can serve my family with a good conscience. As I made it, it had only 7 grams of fat per serving and still tasted very rich!

This was definitely an easy and tasty recipe. I used Kitchen Basics fish stock in a carton, and it worked well. Also replaced 1/2 of the cream with milk to lighten it up, using some corn starch to thicken. Also added about a cup of corn kernels right before adding the fish...helped make it more chunky. Used frozen fish from Trader Joe's: cod worked really well, while the bass was too chewy.

I've made this recipe several times and company always seem to enjoy it. For simplicity I always use College Inn "chicken broth" and I substitute the savory with "fresh" minced rosemary.

Made this with some fresh striped bass I caught the day before. Cooked the bones down to make the Strong Fish Stock, which made all the difference as far as I'm concerned--by far the best chowder I've ever made, and the only thing I really did differently from any recipe I'd ever tried before was use that stock. Adding the whole filets was a good idea--ended up with nice big chunks of fish after stirring a few times. Definitely keep the salt pork separate--I added mine into the soup, and it gets kind of soggy, losing that wonderful crunchiness.

I haven't varied my "tried and true" chowder recipe for years, but I thought I'd try this one. It was so fantastic. Thyme was the surprise and perfect ingredient. I still just used canned, whole baby clams rather than fish. I also used fewer potatoes and one med-large onion. Terrific chowder.

This chowder is just ravishing! I made the Strong Fish broth suggested (with about 6 lbs of meaty halibut bones)--this provided MORE than enough very tender fish meat for the soup (I fished it out of the broth and shredded it by hand--I easily had 4 cups of shredded halibut to add to the chowder). Such a deal-- the halibut bones were only .69 cents a lb at Lunardi's, our local upscale grocery! I cut the potatoes in slightly smaller pieces (1/3 inch dice as opposed to slice). It was thick and delicious. Another bonus--with so many fish bones, I was able to come away with 8 extra cups of a truly delicious fish stock! It's amazing the next day... Makes about 5 quarts of soup. Thickens up considerably in the fridge--we had to dilute it quite a bit, so you may really end up with an extra quart or two! Does anyone know if you can freeze chowder?

Outstanding recipe. I intended to follow the recipe in all detail, but made a small error that may have actually improved the dish. I then decided to add a pound of 25 count shrimp to entice my wife to seriously try this fish chowder. She was impressed as the second bowl of chowder demonstrated. The error I made was adding the potatoes to the renderer fat in the pan at the same time that I added the onions. This may have made the potatoes softer and added to the liquid which was fan-------tastic.

I am certainly no chowder expert, but my husband and I loved this recipe. I personally prefer a not-too-thick chowder, so the consistency of this one was perfect. The broth is excellent - rich, flavorful. I did not have fish stock, and therefore used chicken, so I can only inagine how much richer this would with fish. Easy recipe, not too time consuming, though a bit expensive for the land-locked who pay $7 a pound for cod.

EXCELLENT RECIPE! I have tried many chowder recipes and I finally found the one! I only made 2 slight changes. The first time I made the chowder, the flavor was great but the consistency was too thin, even after breaking up the potatoes. So, I suggest you add 3 tablespoons of cornstarch when the broth is boiling. This makes the chowder a perfect consistency. The second change was to reduce the haddock by 1/2 pound and add 1 1/2 pounds of cleaned, medium raw shrimp- adds a great flavor! Also, I used chicken broth, b/c that is what i had on hand.

This was so much like the fish chowder my mother used to make (she's a native New Englander) that it brought back wonderful memories. The only real difference is in the presentation; she used to simmer the salt pork in with the soup, but I liked the idea of using it as 'cracklings' for garnish. I also liked the fish cooked as fillets and letting it flake naturally (mom cut hers in large chunks). I used fat-free half&half. The final direction in mom's recipe is "add milk until the pot's full and it's white enough". Home cookin' at its best! BTW, to the cook in the Netherlands: The only substitute I can think of for salt pork that would even remotely suffice would be smoked turkey -- preferably a wing or small drum, boiled first and the meat shredded. But isn't the meat/fish and dairy non-Kosher to begin with? Anyway, good luck!!

I have made this many times, as printed, (sometimes I use dried thyme), and it's absolutely delicious & incredibly easy. Even my kids love it. I use frozen cod loins from Sam's (defrosted in the microwave first), regular canned chicken broth & good quality thyme and bay leaves (I think that's important). This recipe actually DESERVES it's four fork rating! DELICIOUS!!!!!

This chowder was DELICIOUS, even though I had some problems. DO use WHOLE fillets (I used defrosted catfish nuggets that I could not skin, and then, since a lot of the nuggets disintegrated, the ugly skins made no difference). I halved the recipe and made some changes/additions. For my 1/2 recipe, I used 2-1/2 oz. Louis Rich low-fat bacon; added 1-1/2 ribs of sliced celery; used a 15 oz. can of Bella Clam Sauce and added water to get the required 2-1/2 cups of fish stock; used 1 cup half & half; added 1/2 tsp. of ground pepper, 3/4 tsp. Wyler's Instant Fish Flavoring, and about 10 drops of bottled Maggie Hot Chile Sauce. This was a delicious chowder. However, buy whole skinless fillets and don't goof with the fish like I did!!!

From a New England native, this chowder was fantastic! Especially good the next day. Definitely a keeper and I will definitely make it again and again. My changes: halved the recipe; used a medley of mussels, squid, and shrimp (prepared in the market) instead of fish; used the fat from a ham hock instead of salt pork (worked fine); used packaged seafood stock from Trader Joe's (delish!); and used red-skinned potatoes. Maybe because there is not enough starch in the red-skinned potatoes, but I thought the consistency of the chowder was a little too thin even though I followed the directions to smash a few pieces against the side of the pot. I ended up making a roux of 1 T oil and 1 T flour. This worked perfectly to thicken it up. Next time, I would add more potatoes over all. I'm not the cook from the North of Boston but I've eaten a lot of chowder and I've eaten a lot of catfish and I think catfish in this dish would be excellent!

The reviews on this site are raving and as winter's coming I can't wait to try this chowder!! But one question for those who have experimented with it: I don't eat most meats and my husband is Jewish and doesn't eat pork. Are there any good meatless substituations out there for the salt pork? Or has anyone had good results without this ingredient? Thanks!

Great recipe for classic fish chowder. I modified this to suit our taste for lower fat, stew-like chowder (all "stuff", not broth): no butter, 4 c. stock, cubed potates, and just 1/2 c. of 1/2&1/2 at end. I used a variety of fish based on what was on sale: salmon, swordfish, catfish and bay scallops (add at very end). 1/2 env. of powdered clam broth and a hit of sherry for extra flavor. Add a small pat of butter on top of a serving for max butter appeal, minimal real fat!

UNBELIEVABLE!!!! my bostonian husband said this was the best, closest to chowder he grew up on, chowder he ever had. the only change we made was diluting the cream with half and half (1 cup cream) and we used a combination chicken broth and clam juice. we used cod, which held up beautifully. this is the second time we made this. the first was supurb, but we used frozen haddock and the fresh cod was even better!

An absolute "keeper". I made the strong fish stock using the head and bones of a red snapper I purchased from the fish market. It wasn't as difficult as I had imagined. The rest of the recipe was very easy and the result was out of this world. The cracklings from the salt pork were not that necessary to serve for the flavor but did add something to the presentation.

This was the best chowder I've ever had! I took others suggestions and used clam broth instead of fish stock. The only thing I would do different is add more potatoes...I love potatoes. Fantastic!

A fabulous chowder. I used frozen halibut and about a tablespoon of dried summer savory. I have to say it is the most delicious chowder I have ever made.

I just made this Chowder for Dinner tonight and sampled it. I guess that I am going to have it twice today. It is GREAT.

I made this recipe with fresh cod, which was delicious however it was difficult to keep the fish from completely breaking up after the first reheating. I used Minors Fish Base to make the stock (excellent and available at specialty stores) and thickened it just a bit with flour. Finally, I made a few substitutions, i.e., thick cut bacon instead of salt pork and fresh dill and parsley instead of savory and thyme. It was delicious and will serve as my template for future chowders.

This ultra simple recipe has great flavor. I substituted Fat Free Half and Half instead of the cream, and used store bought Clam Broth to replace the fish stock, and this soup was wonderful!

Oh, yum! yum! yum! Delicious, velvety, rich and warming. I made it with bottled clam broth and cheapo frozen haddock fillets, and it was still *wonderful*, creamy even before adding the half and half at the end. Tasted even better after a day's rest in the fridge.

This is pretty much identical to my Maine Grandma's Fish Chowder but she uses milk not cream. So if you wanted to substitute it will be lower fat and more authentic. And wait a day, it is SO much better the next day you'll regret it if you eat it too early.

well, i didn't realize i've already rated this recipe once... and i'm making it again... and once again, on a scale of 1-4, it's a FIVE...I'm down at the Cape (Cod) and find it extremely annoying and ironic that the A & P in P'town did not have salt pork! Damned granola set has taken over, i think! But i'm substituting fatty bacon, and the cod is fresh, fresh, fresh, and i can even smell the salt in the air! Ah, Jasper White, we love you!

A perfect chowder! I used pancetta instead of salt pork (which i couldn't find) and cod. I served it with New England brown bread and a greens salad. So easy and so delicious -- it was a perfect meal for a winter evening!

I made this chowder for company. I did not plan enough ahead of time to prepare the fish stock so I substituted clam broth and it worked out very well. The chowder is rich, creamy and delicious! My guests raved! As with all soups, it tasted even better the next day leftover. Not only is this chowder hearty and delicious, but it is soooo easy to prepare. I highly recommend it! I used fresh cod and it was great since it has a nice firm texture and it did not break up too much, but rather just right! You'll never want chosder from a can again.

I took this to a Sunday School class party and people really liked it. I did substitute bacon for the salt pork and Land O Lakes fat free Half and Half for the cream but it was still great!

Mmmmmmm!!!! Real tasy. Use fresh haddock and add a lil' dill weed and you've got the best pot of chowda going!

This is definitely New England fish chowder like it is meant to be. Traditionally there is not any seasoning except black pepper, but I think the thyme is a great addition.

Wonderful dish for a snowy winter evening. Added whole cod fillets as directed - they flaked perfectly.
