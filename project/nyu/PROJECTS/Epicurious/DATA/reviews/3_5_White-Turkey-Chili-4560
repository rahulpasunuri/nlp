I loved this chili! I made the following easy modifications due to other reviews: I used 2 lbs 99% fat free ground turkey, put an additional cup of chicken stock (also 99?% fat free) and instead of jalapeño chiles, poured in a 15 oz can of chopped tomatoes with green chiles. Also had a package of sliced mushrooms I needed to use up, so added them. Perfect! And healthy! Will add a handful of chopped cilantro next time, too.

This is the BEST recipe I have found for White Chili. You can easily double it to serve more. I omitted the summer savory because I did not have it. I used one small can of chopped green chilies. Excellent recipe.

I had to use up some ground turkey breast in a hurry and I saw this recipe. I had to stick to what I had on hand, so I used 2 cans of great northern beans instead of using any garbanzo beans. I also don't like marjoram or have summer savory, so instead I threw in a little extra cumin and some ground chili with a dash of paprika. I didn't use any breast slices, just the ground. Also omitted the barley. Used 1/2 can of diced jalapeno. Then served w/ cheddar cheese and sour cream w/ chives. Even the boyfriend LOVED it! Will keep this (w/ my changes) for the future!

I tried this recipe with what I had - ground turkey and Great Northern beans, skipped the barley, garbanzos and turkey slices. It got thumbs up from the family, wholesome and satisfying on a wintery day.

I doubled the barley to make it thicker and instead of jalapenos added a high quality fresh tomatillo green sauce. 15 ozs and 2 teaspoons jalapeno powder. Very fresh and delicious!

I thought this was great, but I added green chili's and jalapeno sausage (instead of cubed turkey), extra hot sauce all for a little extra kick

Make this recipe with your leftover turkey (mine is smoked). My secret is to add this (pls trust me, it's great): 2 lbs. tomatillos + 1 lg. white onion, halved & sliced thin + 2 serranos, whole, all of which have been blistered under the broiler (turning once). Take the whole sheet pan of juices, tomatillos, onions & peppers (seeds included) & puree in a blender. Add it to the chili after you've added the spices. It adds a bright, acidic element, as well as some depth, to the chili.

I made this for a crowd the very first time and everybody LOVED it. Based on the reviews I added some things that I believe made it amazing. I added chopped green pepper and sauteed with the onion. As another reviewer suggested I added a few slices of chopped up cooked bacon as well as some spicy turkey sausage. I also smashed up the garbanzos- not completely but just so they were not completely whole. Everybody who ate it asked for the recipe- this is a winner.

My family loved this soup. Instead of raw turkey, I used "planned-over" Jennie-O Teriyaki Sesame & Ginger turkey breast I had grilled for dinner the day before, and just chopped it up and threw it in immediately before adding the chicken broth. This made a huge impact on the flavor, I suspect, and it was so good and so easy this way, I'll definitely go this route again. This pre-seasoned turkey is quite salty, though, so no salt need be added later. I had run out of fresh garlic, so used 2 tsp Thai chili-garlic sauce (then went easy on the Tabasco at the end) and a few dashes of garlic powder in its place, which gave the soup a wonderful warm spiciness. And, inspired by "A Cook from mill valley's" review, I chopped a few leaves of the Napa cabbage I had on-hand and added it with the beans to get a vegetable in there. This is definitely going on my regular recipe rotation. Absolutely delicious!!

I've made a very similar version of this without barley several times this winter. Like others, I just use ground turkey and navy beans along with the kidney instead of the garbonzo called for here. Consider adding kale or swiss chard for some extra nutrition and color contrast. A small can of green chilis works great and a pinch of cayenne never hurt anyone either. I also highly recommend a hardy portion of grated pepper jack over the top when serving.

My husband LOVES this recipe. I use all ground meat as well but usually make it with ground pork. I always add corn and don't usually add chick peas. I sometimes add sausages (usually chicken) for an extra bite!

Great recipe, but agree no chick peas. Needs the tabasco - don't skip this part! I used 4 slices of bacon to add a bit more flavor.

We loved this chili. I had a tiny problem with the consistency being to thin so I pureed an extra can of garbanzos and an extra can of the cannelloni beans and added that to the chili and it was perfect. For those who like more heat I put out chopped serranos and two kinds of hot sauce.

This was a delicious,satisfying meal--not bland as others have suggested. I used herbes de provence in place of savory and beef broth instead of chicken--pantry was bare. My husband loved it ,now wants it in the rotation--and he has a very discrimating palate

A little bland if you follow the recipe exactly, but it's nothing that a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes can't fix. Top with shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream.

Made this with all ground turkey and substituted herbes de provence because I couldn't find savory at the store that day. This was so flavorful, I did use all turkey thigh meat and topped with extra sharp aged cheddar and scallions. The leftovers were even better as other reviewers have mentioned.

I like this recipe a lot. Second time I made it I used all ground turkey, no jalapeno (for the kids sake) and no savory. Next time I make it I will substitute out the garbanzo beans. I decided that's the one thing I dont like in this recipe.

A friend passed along this recipe and we've tweeked it a bit by adding more barley, chopped carrots and fire roasted tomatoes. I also recommend stock over broth, of course. Absolutely delicious. A fave of our friends and family.

If you are into healthy eating, this is is the best. Deserves four forks. Summer savory is a must. I use it for stuffing so I always have it on hand. You can buy it on line.

I, too, didn't have turkey breast slices, so I substituted ground turkey. I thought the barley was an interesting addition. The jalapeno provided just the right amount of kick. I didn't have marjoram or savory and had to leave them out. I think that the addition of a dollop of sour cream and mexican cheese is a must.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe! I also doubled the barley and added a can of corn and tomatoes too. The jalepenos and hot sauce make the heat in this recipe just right. The fresh garlic, onion, summer savory and oregano from the garden made it even tastier. Have made it numerous times already and have been passing around to friends and family.

Boy, did I not care for this... The garbanzo beans are too rich for me, and the flavor of the dish just was not appealing...

I love this recipe so much that after reading the last review I simply had to write in. I use olive oil and all ground turkey, usually two pounds worth. Since I can't ever find Summer Savory, I substitute Herbs de Provence. The result, a yummy, velvety, buttery textured base with lots of flavor! I have given this recipe to friends feeling under the weather and new moms just home with baby. Plus, it has become a monthly staple in our home. We love it!!

I made this to the recipe exactly. Was not thrilled at all. Bland City. Thought maybe it was because of low-salt organic stock, then added salt and was not thrilled. I'm going to take the remainder of this (over 4 cups of turkey and beans) and do the sauce from the white chicken chili recipe. If it doesn't pan out - off to the disposal!

Fantastic. Omitted the savory and used one adobo chile instead of the jalapenos but otherwise went pretty much by the book, and it was addictively delicious. Also, we let it sit for a day after cooking and it definitely helped the flavors meld together. A keeper for the repertoire.

I'm usually a generous reviewer but this particular recipe doesn't allow for that. This was tasty enough, though a bit salty (I admit, I didn't use low sodium broth, but did follow the recipe otherwise). My three year old kept saying, "I smell fajitas!" while I was cooking. I suggest these ingredients would be better off in a burrito or corn tortilla wrapped fajita! Much too much liquid left for a chili dish - was more of a turkey soup. Not a special recipe.

Rating: 2
This recipe did not work at all. Used 3 cups of broth and after the 40 minutes there was little liquid left. Added beans and it was just a pot of beans and turkey. Nothing to "thicken up." So I added a can of diced tomatoes, a can of pureed tomatoes and about 1/4 cup tomatillo salsa. Then it had a good consistency and tasted quite good, but definitely not a "white" chili.

Rating: 4
Love this recipe. Note: it isn't soupy like most chiles. My husband and I like to use the leftovers a couple nights later as filler for burritos (just add cheese, non fat sourcream, onions, peppers and beans! voila!) great recipe and good for you two!

I modified this recipe a bit and it turned out delicious. I did not use the cinnamon and used 2 cans of fat free beef broth. For the beans, I used white and black-one can each. For the seasoning I used one package of chili mix, added two gloves of garlic, and put the fresh cilantro in the pot to cook along with the rest of the recommended spices. Jiffy corn bread was served, but to reduce the fat, we always use 2 egg whites instead of one egg. The meal was a hit!

I didn't share the previous reviewers' enthusiasm for this recipe - it was "ok". I would probably make it a little hotter by adding more chilies and hot pepper sauce.

I made this in a crock-pot slowcooking for about 6 hours using only leftover turkey. It was awesome. Even my kids had seconds. Only thing I would change next time is to put the barley in at about the half-way point. It cooked apart a little to much.

When using epicurious, I often pick a recipe based on user reviews. I look for a recipe that has overall good reviews. However, when considering this recipe, I found the user reviews unhelpful. Why does everyone post their review, if they are not using the recipe on here. It would be different if everyone had tried original recipe, said what is wrong with it, and then suggested how their changes have improved the recipe.

Yummy! What a perfect way to use leftover turnkey. We used leftover turkey breast and thigh meat, added 1 small habenero, two small ancho chiles and 1 jalapeno. It was perfectly spiced. Also used one can of black beans in place of the chickpeas.

I substituted a can of hominy for the chickpeas, a can of minced green chilis for the jalapenos, and some leftover cooked chicken for the raw cubed turkey and it was great. Nice blend of flavors, great leftover, my 2.5 year old loves it!

I won a chili cook-off with this recipe! When I doubled it, I used 2 cans white beans, 1 can chick peas and 1 can black beans. I used my own chicken stock (veal bones added for extra savory finish) and I also added quite a bit of thyme.

Really good recipe. We replaced the turkey chunks with spicey turkey sausage chunks to give it a bit of punch. We also added honey and sugar to sweeten it up a bit. Finally, we added some peach salsa as a side condiment along with recommended ones and it was great.

Really liked this recipe. I have made it both with turkey breast and chicken breast (when there was no turkey breast available) and it comes out great both ways. Instead of the jalapeno I substituted 2 chopped canned chipotles in adobo sauce (wihtout the sauce). It didn't really affect the color and added a good kick.

There is a Via Cucina right in my office building, and everyone loves their white turkey chili! However, the Via in my building must alter their white turkey chili from the corporate recipe because they add baby pearl onions and pickled jalapeno slices. It's the best!!! It's their best selling soup, and it's on the menu every day. With the exception of the addition of the pearl onions (and yes, I still added the minced yellow onion) and using pickled jalapeno slices instead of fresh jalapenos, I made this recipe as is. My opinion is that the combination of the turkey breast and ground turkey is a must.

Very tasty chili! Didn't have turkey breasts so I only used grnd turkey and it was very good. I forgot to use the green onions, cheese and sour cream at the end until my husband asked about it and then after I put them on, the dish was complete!

Excellent recipe. My only problem was that I used vegetarian fake meat instead of turkey and the resulting colour was truly vile, so I added some tomato puree, which improved it visually. I used herbes de Provence instead of the savory. My husband is always begging me to cook with barley - it's so good for you! - and this was a great way to make him (and the kids) happy.

Great flavors...loved the cumin. I used all ground turkey and no pearl barley. Instead, I pureed the beans to thicken the chili. Tomatoes, bell peppers, and cilantro make great additions. I used plenty of jalapeno with the seeds for spice perfection.

Delicious recipe. The market didn't have any breasts, so I used all ground turkey, worked just fine. Didn't have Summer Savory (let alone know what it is) so I used Poultry Seasoning. I know it's a "White" Turkey Chili, but I personally would like some vegetables next time, carrots, red pepper, green beans....I really lilked the Barley in it, instead of the normal putting chili over rice!

Rating: 4
This is the best chili recipe I've ever tasted. I've made this delicious dish several times and still get rave reviews. Although it annoys me when people change the original recipe, this chili easily can use substitutions like fresh cilantro instead of dried summer savory. And if you don't happen to have turkey breast, chicken will do. I love color so I always chop up red bell pepper for a topping. It's going to a Superbowl party with me this weekend.

Unbelievably good and healthy dish -- perfect for those rainy (or snowy) winter days. I boosted the jalapeno for a little extra kick.

I made this for a staff meeting. Several members watch their cholesterol, so they really liked it. Lots of flavor and very little saturated fat. I couldn't find regular pearl barley, only Quaker quick barley. So, after the initial simmering, I added the quick barley along with the beans. Worked fine. I agree that letting the chili sit for several hours really thickens it up.

This chili is muy excellente - a comfort food specially during winter time. If I don't have time to make it, I am quite lucky enough to be next to Via Cucina in Arlington, VA. I have to get there early enough or they are out of white chili by 12:30pm.

When I first made it, I looked at the pot thinking "My GOD, did I just make the same chili these other guys did?" It was soupy and thin! HOWEVER, I let it sit for 24 hours (in my garage, it's cold enough) and when I opened it up and reheated it, it was thick and yummy. The flavors definitely were better the next day. Next time I will skip the canned beans and replace it with 1 lb great northern beans (purchased dried, then soaked). The canned beans always seem to taste mushier to me. The barley did a nice job of thickening it up. So don't fret if it doesn't come out the way you'd like it - just let it sit for a day and it will be much better! It's not a pretty dish, but it's good.
