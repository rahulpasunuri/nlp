This sounds like it would be good with a fresh raspberry as a garnish, along with the chocolate curls.

I thought these were amazing. I tweeked a few things based on other reviews. I used a vanilla cookie and butter base and baked it for 10 minutes and cooled before adding the filling. I used Lindt chocolate and felt the flavor was delicious.

This has become a go-to desert, especially for the summer as baking is not needed. I use semi sweet chocolate rather then the white chocolate. I also add all of the melted chocolate to the ground cookies as it holds the crust together perfectly. I garnish with mint.

I have made this three times, and my son is begging for it again. I made a couple of changes though. I used a chocolate graham cracker crust, and I doubled the recipe, and used a standard spring form pan. The sweetness of the crust and the tangy of the limes complemented each other beautifully. I decorated it using slices of lime, raspberries and a sprig of mint.

These aren't horrible... but they aren't great. The "crust" is too crumbly. It doesn't hold together and frankly tastes like a sandwich cookie - surprise! The top is nice on it's own and would probably be really good on a crust. However, it tasted overall a bit like an oreo with a hint of lime. AND, it's hard to make a nice presentation with these crumbly little bars. You can't use a biscuit/cookie cutter, they are too creamy. They are hard to place symmetrically on a plate because they slide around on the little crumbs they create. Finally, they are easy, but you do have to drag out every piece of kitchen equipment except the oven. Lots of dishes, lots of crumbs, no big payoff!Oh, and they aren't inexpensive either.

These were delicious and went fast at a Christmas party. My food processor was broken, so my daughters used a metal dry measure to crush the cookies in a container. I followed suggestions to use 3 Tbs melted butter to hold the cookie crumb bottom together, but I also used the melted chocolate, which made it very tasty. When I first did the layering, I felt that the cheesecake portion was equal in size to the cookie bottom, so I doubled the recipe for the top and it came out perfectly! I also doubled the (fresh) lime juice. These were fun to make and easy since there's no baking.

Made this filling in a chocolate tart crust from Bon Appetit 3-2006 P. 92. Delicious. Filing is very firm and cuts beatuifully. Freezes well. A Mich cook.

I used vanilla sandwich cookies instead, since I wasn't sure that the chocolate flavor would really blend well with the lime. Next time I'll use 3 or 4 tablespoons of melted butter instead of chocolate to hold the crust together, but other than that, they came out ridiculously amazing. I also replaced the cream cheese with 1/3 less fat cream cheese to cut down on calories (35 less calories per serving that way).

Delicious and fairly simple recipe. Got rave reviews from an apartment-ful of picky college guys with distinctly different tastes. Everyone loved it! Instead of garnishing with white chocolate curls I used white chocolate chips and decorative baking glitter for a frosty effect.

I have made these bars twice now without incident. They have come out perfectly - no problems with the crust or filling. Everyone was happy to see them reappear in our kitchen.

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe was written. I had no problem with the crust or a runny filling as others had. Make sure you use "oreo" cookies or comparable and whip your cream to the stage mentioned. It is a super quick and impressive recipe with the lime sliver and shaved chocolate on top!

I made this for Christmas Eve. It was okay but nothing special and therefore I wouldn't likely make it again. I made the crust using oreo crumbs and butter (without the melted chocolate). Texture of the cheesecake was lighter than I anticipated (a plus) as it seemed really stiff while I was spreading it. As others have commented - it could have used more lime juice (at least 1 tbsp if not 2 tbsp more) and the texture would still have been acceptable.

If you instead use your hands to mix the cookie bits with the white chocolate you'll be left with a dry, crumbly paste. I've found that by doing this a more rigid crust is formed. Also be sure to chill it adequately before serving and press it very firmly into the bottom of the pan.

Whenever I ask my son what I can bring to he and his college roommates, this is the one they request. Their moms have even asked me for the recipe. I use the plain chocolate wafer cookies and add butter to the crust, but it probably works fine if you use Oreos. Delicious and easy!

The flavour of the cheesecake filling was really nice, but the consistency way too runny to cut into slices, as was shown in the picture. Adding gelatin might help. The base was OK after adding butter. I hate it when a recipe needs to be completely modified to make it work.

I wish I would have read the reviews before I made the crust. Next time I will add butter to keep the crust together. The taste was great and was a big hit.

These were tasty and everyone liked them (and I was fine with the combination of lime and chocolate) but the crust didn't stay together though I followed others' suggestions, and they just weren't very pretty.

I really like the filling (with increased lime juice) and will probably make it again as part of another dessert - maybe instead of custard in a fruit tart, or with a graham cracker base. I did not care for the combination of lime with the chocolate crust. Based on other reviews, I used melted butter and chocolate wafer cookies, and that makes a good crust, I just didn't like it with this filling. The filling texture is excellent, and would probably adapt well to other flavors: lime, orange, raspberry, coffee, vanilla, almond.

I made this for a dinner party we had, and everyone loved it. I changed the crust and made it more of a traditional cheese cake by using chocolate gram crackers and butter for the crust. It turned out really great.

This recipe, when I started making it, was doomed. It was one of those times when one is totally off their baking game and start making really mindless mistakes. Well, seeing as I totally butchered the prep (my mother is parcially to blame as well, she put margarin in the melted white chocolate:|), I expect the end product to be a disaster, but it wasn't. It was actually one of the best cheesecakes I had ever tasted. Even my father- who isn't a big lime fan- enjoyed it. Any recipe that can survive the hack- job I performed on it desirves even 5 out of 4 forks. I also strongly recommend going heavier on the lime juice; maybe even going as far as doubling it. (This is only if you like the stronger lime rather than a subtle flavor, of course. Also, the crust is a little too crumbly, so I recommend that you add melted butter to the crust to fix this problem.

This is a great no-bake recipe. No need to use premium quality white chocolate. I added the extra butter to the crust as suggested and it is definitely needed to keep it from crumbling.

this is yummy , i added extra white chocolate and 3 T. butter to crust,,and extra lime juice to the filling.. i've made this several times over the holidays..

Mmmmm! I wasnt able to find plain white chocolate, so I purchased Lindt's white chocolate with coconut and what a delicious addition to this recipe! Next time I plan to add butter to the crust to keep it together better.

I made this with key limes and brought them to a party. Everyone raved about them and asked for the recipe

Yummy, but I'd add melted butter to keep the crust from falling apart. I'd also consider adding unflavored gelatin to the filling to solidify it slightly more.

I thought these were just ok. Pros: the topping has a nice consistency, I like the topping with the chocolate crust, they are very easy. Cons: Not enough lime flavor. I added an extra TBL and it was still not enough. The chocolate base is too crumbly. I suggest adding butter instead of white chocolate and baking it. They have to be eaten on a plate with a fork. The base is too crumbly and the topping is too soft to be put out on tray like brownies or lemon squares.

I would choose a graham cracker crust instead of the chocolate cookies. The combo of lime and dark and/or mild chocolate flavors wasn't for me. I was disappointed as my cheesecake layer didn't blend well and came out a bit grainy. But overall the flavor of the cheesecake layer was nice. I added extra lime, without it the lime would have almost disappeared. Not bad, but I probably won't make again.

Super easy to make. Found crust was too crumbly - I'd add a bit of melted butter next time or another tablespoon of white chocolate. Perfect amount of lime flavour. Would definitely make again.

Interesting variations in these reviews...I thought the bars were very light, especially since they are called a "cheesecake". I also thought they were just limey enough. I used my microplane grater for the lime zest, so maybe the flavor came through better. For the chocolate curls on the top, I happened to find some lemon-lime flavored white chocolate made by Frey (got it at Target)and that worked perfectly! All my friends loved these.

Like the previous reviewer, I did not feel the texture or flavor of the oreo crust complemented the filling. Found the filling to be a bit heavy. Might have been better with a lighter cheese - ricotta or marscapone - and more whipped cream.

My friend made these this weekend, and although I didn't care for them, some people did. I didn't think the Oreo crust went well with the lime. We also added extra lime due to the reviews, and I still didn't think they tasted very limey.

OMG. I doubled it and made a cheesecake out of it, soooooo good, definately a keeper

My family loved these, I personally would have preferred a bit more lime flavor they were on the sweet side. They did not have a very strong cheesecake flavor to me. They were definately enjoyed enough and although the recipe used many bowls to prepare it was very easy. So for sure if they are requested I would make them again.

I was disappointed in these bars. Didn't particularly think the chocolate crust and the lime was a good combination. 4 days later and there are still some left...If I try this again I may just do a shortbread or graham crust. Also they were bland..needed more lime flavor...

While the results of the recipe were delicious, I had some trouble with the white chocolate. By the time I was ready to add it in to the cream cheese mixture, it had begun to solidify on the edges of the bowl. I'd suggest prepping everything before melting the white chocolate and adding it to the processed cookies and cream cheese mixture right before assembly.

They were a big hit at a recent party. I cut the bars into smaller squares (12 per pan) and topped each one with a raspberry. I also used the white chocolate bars but simply melted them in the microwave at 30 sec. intervals. Much easier and cleaner than using a double boiler. I also used the chocolate filled sandwich cookies.

wow! when i first opened my new october issue, i wanted to make these right away. if you read the forums, you might know that the first time i attempted this the white chocolate turned into a huge grainy mess in my double boiler. this time i used BARS (the chips didn't seem to melt as well), heated the water over medium before putting the chocolate on, chopped the chocolate into very small squares, and watched for a few minutes until the chocolate looked shiny. then i stirred it off heat with a fork and added it to either the cookies or the filling (and i did it in 3 oz batches just to be safe - didn't want to take any chances after the first go). this recipe was well worth the effort, and i am definitely going to make these again.
