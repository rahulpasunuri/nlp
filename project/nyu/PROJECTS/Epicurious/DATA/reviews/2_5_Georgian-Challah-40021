I am sorry to jump in on this one but Challah, is made with Egg, and it is made without Egg. You cannot say it is not Jewish Challah just because it is made in another area of the world. It was made by Jewish hands and served on the Sabbath by and for Jewish Families. Break the bread in peace, there are many other things to concerned about than if a bread contains an egg or not. Jim

My family came to the U.S. from Germany. It's funny to hear comments from people who think eggs make a challah real challah. In the eastern European tradition that is mostly true. However, in Germany challah had to be a white bread, fine- textured and nice and crusty. Egg challah seemed very odd to us. I think most Jewish communities in the world never put eggs into the challah dough. Nowadays I enjoy egg challah, but I still love the traditional challah I grew up with. Take a look at the Encyclopedia Judaica on this topic, if you want to see the variety of challot (with pictures) from around the world.

Plenty of Challah recipies don't have eggs - it is called water challah.

Georgia is known for its long-standing, centuries old religious tolerance. What do you know about Georgia or about the Jews there? Just because it's not the recipe YOU expect to see, doesn't mean it's not challah. Get out in the world a little, people.

People, "Jewish" does NOT equal "Ashkenazi." There are Jews all over the world, and have been for thousands of years. People raised in different cultures cook different foods. Just because it's not the recipe you grew up with doesn't mean it's not challah.

Baruch Hashem! Thank you for this recipe! My son has serious egg allergies and we have the hardest time finding an egg-free challah (frankly any recipe that doesn't call for eggs in Jewish cooking is hard to find) we can use. The best part is, the kids can help and we get to enjoy shabbat.

I like to make the braided kind and I use a little more yeast for that amount of flour

I added an egg into the recipe and brushed the top with another egg. Other than that it is a nice simple recipe for me.

You need eggs for challah bread! This recipe should not be on a site for traditional Jewish food.

I have a very similar recipe, the only difference is that I use 2 eggs. I also brush the tops of the bread with a scrambled egg before baking. This is an easy recipe and the bread tastes great.

Have not tried this recipe, but for people looking for a traditional challah, try "Almost Grandmother's Challah," also on this site (search on "challah") which got great reviews. Plan to try it myself this weekend!

Where were the Eggs ?? Challah Must have Eggs or it is Not actually Challah brd. Call it something else then but don't pass it off as Jewish Sabbath fare, please.
