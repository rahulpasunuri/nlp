Delicious!!! So filling and tasty and made enough for 5 big helpings. Great for Lent. Followed recipe exactly except no cheese.

I love this recipe -- I find it a quick, flavorful, and filling pasta option on days when I don't have much in the house. I've always used canned cannelini beans and dried herbs; haven't ever had the escarole on hand, but haven't missed it. I definitely salt both pasta and sauce well and increase the red pepper flakes somewhat.

As written, I understand completely why last reviewer said it had no taste--there is no salt and pepper in the ingredients. I added about a TB of salt and it brought out the flavor. I took your warning about the time and made the sauce with the spices, onions & garlic, simmered it 45 minutes, then added escarole and a can of white beans. Didn't have any white wine. Saved a lot of time and tasted yummy.

This recipe was entirely too bland for the amount of time and preparation it took to make. I spent more than 90 minutes preparing this seemingly simple dish. The flavor was non-existent.
