Made this for a winter supper -- toasted the fennel seeds (and used slightly more than called for as other reviewers noted). Used 3/4 c half and half and 1/4 c cream -- plenty creamy enough. We really liked it -- will make again.

This is a nice start but agree it needs tweaking. To bring out a more full fennel flavor, I toasted my fennel seeds (and doubled the amount suggested) and then after softening the vegetables, I deglazed (not much to scrape but spirit was there- pun intended) the pot with Pernod, a licorice flavored, liquor. I also crisped 4 chopped strips of bacon and reserved them along with about a cup of roasted root veggies (carrots and parsnip) and roasted a few diced potatoes to make for "croutons". All of those went into the soup during the "warming up" period after I integrated and simmered the cream. I also decided to experiment with another ingredient: I often make quesadillas for my kids using shredded cheddar and a few strands always slip out of the tortilla and burn in the pan. Not one to waste food, I've often eaten those crisp cheese flakes after they cool and, guess what - they're really good! So I burnt about a 1/4 cup of cheese flakes in the pan where the bacon cooked and used them as a garnish to the soup. It was a hit!

We made this soup for Thanksgiving exactly as prescribed. The presentation was beautiful, the flavors were well matched and complimentary to the salad course and main course. It is a delightful addition to a formal gathering and gives one the opportunity to use great Grandma's soup tureen.

This soup was good but not fantastic right after I made it. Simmering the cream for a few minutes didn't fully release the flavors of the fennel seed and tarragon but letting the soup sit overnight did the trick. Even so, it was not quite as flavorful as I had hoped. Next time I make it, I'll mix in a little roasted garlic and/or bacon and/or sherry or beer.

I get more compliments on this recipe than any other soup that I serve (and I am soup-crazy). I use only one onion and replace the other with leek. The lemon is the key ingredient, it really brightens the soup. Easy to make and delicious, this will be on my "menu" permanently!

I had some left over fennel bulbs from Thanksgiving, and this was a great way to use it. I added celery and carrot and it was delicious.

Normally I like a nice thick soup, but to my mind this came out rather like baby food or overly thin mashed potatoes. I could have thinned it out with more stock, but the delicate anise flavor I expected did not materialize. Without the tarragon it would have failed completely. The presentation was nice, with a dollop of sour cream and a fennel frond, but there was no texture. I have some left over and will add some more chicken stock and a stalk of chopped celery for a little crunch.

Great recipe, I roasted a bunch of root veggies...fennel, parsnip, carrot, potato with garlic s&p, and olive oil..then followed the recipe from there adding broth...I also added some grilled sausage before serving...awesome winter meal with crusty bread and a nice glass of pinot noir.

Other than nonfat half and half does anyone have a suggestion they have successfully used in place of the whipping cream? I have heard evaporated skim milk can be used as an everyday substitution. (For company, I would go with the full fat whipping cream!)~Thanks!!

Wonderful, decadent soup. Made with the Asiago cheese vaiation (about 1/2 cup or so). Lovely and easy. Very good to use the hand held blender -- much simpler.

Absolutely the best soup I have eaten. I took a cue from another reader and added some shredded assaggi cheese at time of serving. I also only pureed about half of the soup since I like it a bit chunky. It has been a terrific hit with everyone who has tried it at my home.

I FOLLOW THE RECIPE BUT THE END RESULT WAS TOO BLAND FOR MY TASTE. SO JUST BEFORE SERVING I ADDED 1 TBSP OF WAGNER ANISE EXTRACT. I LOVED IT! MY GUEST LOVED IT! WILL MAKE IT AGAIN IT'S A VERY ORIGINAL SOUP.

I followed most of the recipe, but since I don't eat much meat, I substituted the meat broth for veggie broth, and soymilk for the creme fraiche. To save on clean up, I used a hand blender instead of a food processor or a blender. I should have used a chinois (?) to strain the soup for I had bit of unpureed fennel in the soup...ick. Overall, it did have a nice texture, but it was on the bland to me. Merely adding salt wouldn't have done the trick, it lacked depth of flavor. I did add a bit of extra lemon (1 to 2 tsp) to see if that would help, but it still lacked.

Made significant changes as I used this as a base for a three cheese fennel soup I had at Camille's in Victoria, BC. Turned out awesome. I cut the fennel into slices, then caramelized them, cooking on a med-low heat for about 40 min until they were dark brown then proceed with this recipe. At the end, I added in about 1/8-1/4 cup of each cheese (fontina, feta, parm) until it tasted right... Rich, creamy, cheesy, delish! I came out with a soup that was almost identical to the one at Camille's. Try this variation... you'll love it!

I just made this for a dinner party and many friends asked for the recipe. I used Land of Lakes non fat half and half instead of cream. Also, I reduced the amount considerably. It was delicious.

I agree with my neighbor on Queen Anne Hill, the soup is excellent. I found 1 large fennel bulb yielded 3 cups. My market sells, in the bulk spice department, ground fennel seeds.

I can't review because I didn't really follow the recipe. i added about 1/3 a head of broccoli and skipped the cream as I usually do when making potato-based "cream" of veggie soups for myself (cream is great as a treat for guests but not really necessary for everyday). anyway the fennel flavour (i did use the seeds) was subtle and delicious, the broccoli/fennel combo worked, also it is a pretty celery-green colour. yummm.

Made this soup last night and it is delicious! I added more potatoes to the mixture so the fennel/potato ratio was different then in the recipe, but the flavor was still great.

The balance of flavors in this soup is perfect! I also used the recipe as a base for a main-course soup: I cooked thinly sliced Yukon golds separately to provide something to chew on, adding 1/2 pound of browned ground turkey. I added the potato mixture after pureeing the rest of the ingredients. This was also delicious.

Excellent recipe. This was a big hit for a recent dinner party and my husband keeps begging me to make it again. I wouldn't change a thing.

Wonderful recipe! The fennel taste is perfectly balanced in this soup, not overpowering. If you think you might not like the anise flavor of fennel, try this, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Will definitely make again.

Another great recipe from Betty Rosbottom. Of my cookbook collection of over 200 books, hers is one of my 20 favorites, so I knew the recipes in this Bon Appetit article were winners. As others have said of this one: easy, delicious, and attractive!

Very good. I served this to my mom and not-a-soup-fan dad. Both enjoyed it and acutally everyone was able to help and make the chopping go by very quickly. I believe we used 5 potatoes and 2 fennels (8 stocks..). Great and easy for a rainy day -- I would serve it as part of a multi-course meal for guests.

This soup is so good it's scary! I followed the recipe exactly. I found that I used just under 2 fennel bulbs to get 6 cups. When I crushed the fennel seeds I was nervous that they would over-power the soup but they just add another delicate layer of flavor. This is delicate enough for a dinner party but yummy & comforting enough to sip in front of the fireplace from a mug.

I made this just exactly as it is written and it was delicious. Fennel was definitely not too strong.

I actually did not follow the recipe to the letter, because I was worried about the strong fennel taste. I used about 2 cups fennel and 4 white potatoes, and no fennel seeds. It was creamy and smooth with a a subtle fennel flavor. My dinner party companions loved it!
