I love this cake. I often make it one to two days ahead - time improves the flavours. I pair it with creme anglaise or homemade french vanilla ice cream. Yum!

Overall a very good recipe, delicious flavor... My mistake - I made this in a 9" pan because it's better than my 10" one. The filling ran over the top, adn then when the cake "fell" the sides stayed up. Again, my mistake, will get a better 10" pan next time. Caramel has a delicious flavor, but did take forever to thicken.

very easy to make if you have all the ingredients out and ready, i doubled the recipe and made 2 for a dinner party. Everyone loved it. I served it with chocolate sauce, and coffee ice cream. this would make great individual size souffle cakes too.

fantastic! I made this for Valentines day and everyone loved it. The sauce was a little thin, but tasted great and looked pretty on the plate. The cake is great too. Very moist but not too heavy.

I thought this was good, but not great. It is one of many flourless chocolate cakes I now have in my collection! It tried it for the sauce, expecting something different. It really wasn't so different from the others I've tried. The sauce was good--I used half the orange juice since others said it was too thin. It still was thin with half the juice. My advice is if you don't have a flourless chocolate cake in your repertoire, this is as good as any. It just doesn't distinguish itself.

This cake was pretty easy. Serving it with vanilla ice cream really brought out the layers of flavor in the sauce. I also picked out the zest (which I thought was a little too bitter) and was VERY HAPPY with the results. Defintiely 4 forks!

This cake was so delicious. My guests at my New Years Eve dinner were raving about it. I did have some trouble getting the sauce to thicken. Mine was kind of runny, but still tasted great on top, with some vanilla gelato.

Fabulous cake. Made this for my husband's 30th birthday dinner. Will definitely make again. I, too had problems with the orange caramel sauce. I tried the sauce from Jan 02 Bon Appetit - similar to the recipe here but uses less orange juice. This sauce was runny as well. To thicken, I ended up boiling it for an even longer time. I also strained out the zest. To me the zest ruined the smooth consistency of the sauce.

I have a sealed system smeg oven so didnt need the dish of water. I also made a raspberry caramel which was thicker than the orange (added one punnet of pureed strained berries to the caramelized sugar) and the colour was to die for.

Fantastic cake!! We preferred a raspberry sauce: one container frozen raspberries with sugar, thawed, blended in the blender for 2 minutes, and strained. Sauce the plate, place wedge of cake on sauce, top with dollop of whipped cream and sprig of mint. We didn't care for the orange sauce as too thin, but oooh, the cake!!

This is one killer cake! I don't have much of a sweet-tooth, and a box of chocolates can sit on my desk for months, but this cake was a danger to have in the house. (I also opted for the orange-caramel sauce from B.A. from 03, 2000.) The taste, the texture, the ease...you have to try this one.

A very adult dessert. I cooked the sauce more to thicken it - an excellent pairing with this cake!

I would and have made this dish several times. I use Sharfenberger semi-sweet for the chocolate. Yes the sauce is thin. I pour the sauce over while the cake is still a little warm then when ready to serve I sprinkle with toasted pecan pieces and squeeze my own homemade (and much thicker) carmel sauce from a squeeze bottle. Garnish with an orange slice and mint sprig. This is the cake my husband asks for on his birthday.

Loved the texture and flavor of the cake. Passed on the sauce and served with whipped cream instead. Be sure to check at 50 minutes. Mine would have been ruined after the full hour in the oven.

Absolutely delicious -- the texture is to die for. Eve folks who don't usually like cake (because of its denseness) liked this one. The orange caramel sauce is unbelievably fragrant and flavorful. This is definitely a keeper.

Perfect chocolate cake! Caramel sauce wasn't (it was more like thin orange sauce), but the orange complemented the chocolate beautifully. Served with grand marnier whipped cream.

Terrific; might have to become one of my signature desserts. Easy, and I liked that no glaze was necessary; served with sweetened whipped cream rather than sauce, which was perfect. Light, moist texture because of water baking method and plenty chocolate-y for me. My guests loved it.

Rating: 3
It was good, but not quite as chocolatey as I was hoping for. Next time I'll experiment as the others have done to get a richer chocolate flavor and a thicker caramel sauce...

I MADE THIS CAKE AND IT WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED BY GUESTS, HOWEVER I USED A CREME ANGLAIS WITH IT INSTEAD OF THE ORANGE SAUCE.

This is a superb cake! It played to uniformly rave reviews at an elegant dinner party and earned me some major kudos. Appreciated the warning that the cake would fall during cooling; also, because of the "not-chocolately-enough" comments, I added 1 tsp. of instant espresso powder and 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the batter, which intensified the flavor. Like one of the other reviewers, I had trouble with the sauce and opted for the "Caramel Orange Sauce" from the 3/2000 BA, also available on this site; that one worked much better for me. We served the cake with a dollop of whipped cream in addition to the sauce. All in all, this one's a home run!

I have made this recipe twice already to rave reviews each time. Someone told me it was the best chocolate dessert he ever had. I am now commanded to make it for parties.

Very good and light, but not enough chocolate taste for me. Guests enjoyed it.Cooked a bit quicker. Really sunk, but not as "wet" looking as picture. Would give it a 2.5 rating.

THIS WAS A BIG HIT-- EVERYONE HAD SECONDS!!!

I found the combo of orange and chocolate in this dish to be wonderful. Even my husband (not much of a chocolate fan) thought it was delicious. I was especially happy to find in the directions the following :'(cake will "deflate" as it cools)'. Without that little statement I would have thouoght that I had done something wrong as it slowly lost its height.

I loved the cake, but my sauce was more like orange sugar water than a caramel sauce. What did I do wrong?

I made this cake for a friend's birthday dinner and she loved it, as did everyone there. It is very chocolaty and moist. I served it with the sauce, but added a dollop of whipped cream and mint leaves for colour. Everyone asked for the recipe.

I somehow managed to mess up the orange sauce and at the last minute made the chocolate sauce at http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=104084. The cake and sauce were were AMAZING and the chocoholics in the office LOVED it!

Excellent and easy to make - have always loved the comination of chocolate and orange - and would suggest doubling the quantity of sauce.

Easy to make, looks great, and very light, but not chocolaty enough for my taste. For a chocoholic like myself this cake won't do the trick. A good cake after a heavy dinner.
