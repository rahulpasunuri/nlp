I made this because I LOVE clam chowder. I was almost perfect. I had to change some of the herbs for a generic "italian blend" but it turned out great. I would use the best cuts of bacon I can find next time but I will definitely be making this again.

Good! Added more rosemary and thyme than noted - turned out great!

A nice chowder. I made the following adjustments: 3.5C milk + 1/2C heavy cream; 1lb chopped fresh clams with abt 1C juice; fresh herbs; added celery and some scallions with the carrots/onions. Tasty results; not too thin, not too thick. My preference is a higher enough broth-to-stuff ratio so I'll adjust proportions next time.
