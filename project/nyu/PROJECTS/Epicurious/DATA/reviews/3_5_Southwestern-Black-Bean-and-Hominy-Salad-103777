I used dry black beans instead of canned. Soaked the night before and cooked them with onion, garlic and bay leaves; which I think lends the dish slightly deeper and more nuanced flavor.

I made this dish to go with some Carnitas I was making and WOW, it was better than the actual Carnitas! My hubby loved it and is trying to eat it with everything (lol). It's great put into tacos, with chips as a dip, or as a side dish. I used fresh corn (not from a can) and I think it really made a difference. I omitted the avocado because it was already in our Carnitas dish... but I think I would have omitted them anyway knowing I'd still have the dish as leftovers. I also doubled the recipe like others suggested. I felt like it was missing something so I added more salsa verde (1.5 cups total) and that helped. I think next time I will add some type of spice (besides salt & pepper) for that added kick :)

We love this. Quick, easy and delicious. Rinse the beans and the hominy to get rid of the canned taste. Only about 900 calories for the whole thing. Doubles easily - use one red and one gold pepper for color. Great dish to bring - layer the ingredients in a glass bowl, then mix in the salsa just before serving for a beautiful presentation. We're serving it for Superbowl Sunday. Serve with lime wedges for those who like it.

This was a very non memorable salad. Something was missing. I ended up adding another can of beans and a tomatoe. The hominy gave the salad a canned taste. It would be much better with fresh corn. This is NOT my new favorite recipe by a long shot.

With both the canned beans *and* the canned hominy this is not a raw recipe. Further if canned or bottled salsa verde is used. This could be quite good with sprouted quinoa (uncooked) and fresh corn off the cob instead of the canned ingredients if raw is the goal. I'm sure it's also quite tasty as written but it's just not raw as tagged.

This is just fantastic and most of the ingredients are easily substitutable. Made it as is, but added the juice of a lime and some roasted corn (cooled) because it's in season. If you can't find salsa verde, it's still really good with just lime juice, salt, and pepper. Texture, color, and taste get rave reviews.

Loved it as did my dinner guests! I did what others suggested and served it as a salsa with chips. I did tweak it a bit though with a couple of shakes of Abdobo seasoning, and a squeeze of lime to brighten the flavors. It's not a pretty dish when mixed up, but it sure tastes fantastic!

Great SIMPLE recipe. Followed the recipe, adding 1 cup of salsa verde instead of 1/2 cup. Heated up flour tortillas and ate this burrito style. YUM! Will definitely be eating this a lot this summer. Total prep time: less than 20 minutes.

As others have stated, this is super easy to prepare and the results are delicious! I used a red tomato and chipotle salsa instead of the salsa verde because I had it on hand, and it worked wonderfully.

I left out the avocado and used parsley instead of cilantro. Before adding the salsa verde, I chopped everything just slightly in a food processor. We ate it as a dip. It was good and I will make it again.

Very tasty, healthy, easy-to-prepare, and cool summer main dish.

Very, good. Easy to prepare. Served with wormed wheat tortillas and roasted chicken. One substitution: corn instead of hominy. I didn't think my boyfriend would like, and I knew he would like the corn (petite white frozen)

I served this as an appetizer at a dinner party with tortilla chips. Big Hit!!

This is a beautiful looking salad that was a hit at my weekend barbecue. I served it in a tortilla shell like you get a taco salad in. My guests loved it, and we're still eating leftovers a few days later, and it still tastes great! Add a little more salsa verde than the recipe states, otherwise it'll be hard to use as a dip as it would fall apart. Yummy!

Totally delicious...great texture...relatively inexpensive yet glamorous side dish or dip. Tastes great the second day too! Make lots!

I made this for a superbowl party. Everyone loved it, its great rolled in a tortilla or with tortilla chips. Recipe doubles well.

I agree that this dish is very good however only after spicing it up considerably. I added cumin, chili powder, lime juice and hot sauce! Perhaps the salsa verde I used was too bland but the problem was easy to solve.

My daughter made this for a dish to pass. It was used as a dip with tortilla chips. Very Very Good! Don't skimp on the Salsa, and Salsa Verde should be used.

I couldn't find any Salsa Verde, so I just used regular salsa. The salad never made it to the table, as the family grabbed a bag of Tostitos and ate it like a dip.

I absolutely loved this recipe. The only change I made was to use red bell pepper instead of yellow and I think the end result was probably more attractive. It looked and tasted great.
