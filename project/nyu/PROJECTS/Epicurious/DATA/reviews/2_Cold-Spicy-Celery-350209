I made it exact to the recipe - I have been trying dozens of different banchan (Korean small dish) recipes over the past month, and this was surprisingly one of my least favorite. I love celery, but this recipe was just a bit bland overall.

This celery was cold and crisp--a nice change for salad. I was surprised, actually. Just happened to have only celery in the crisper.
