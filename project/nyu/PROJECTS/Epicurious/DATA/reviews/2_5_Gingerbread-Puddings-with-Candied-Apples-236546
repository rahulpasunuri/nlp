I made this for Christmas dinner 2007 and was VERY disappointed. (I used to be a pastry chef and cooking instructor, so I tend to know what I'm doing, and can see mistakes coming before they happen just from reading the recipe.) I didn't see this mess coming. The gingerbread was so moist and sticky and wouldn't dry out well which made the whole dessert mushy. The smell of ginger was great when making it, but hardly came through the final product. The apples broke down so quickly (under 30 minutes) that I had to throw them out. I was so embarrassed to serve this, we ended up defrosting the top layer of a 2 month old wedding cake I was storing in the freezer and served that - so much for the tradition of waiting for the 1 year anniversary.

I used my own gingerbread recipe (very similar, but uses 1/2 cup of grated fresh ginger instead of the ground ginger) and it was divine.

For the amount of work to put this together, the outcome was disappointing to me. The bread pudding was real bland. The apples overpower the bread pudding. Not a real strong ginger flavor.

This was good but an awful lot of work. I did as much in advance as possible (made the apples 6 days ahead and the gingerbread the night before) but it still felt like a lot for something that was good not great.

Not sure what I did wrong, but the milk curdled despite not yet reaching simmer and very fresh milk. I would try it again if I knew what I did wrong as we are crazy for ginger.

I expected more ginger flavor. Guests agreed that the sauce could be omitted. I needed 13 puddings and had 1/2 cup molds. We used almost all of the gingerbread, but didn't need to increase the "Puddings" part of the recipe.

Made this for Christmas. My family loved it. For the apple topping, I took the apples out of the sauce at 2 hours and then carmalized the juice. However, I don't think the apple topping is needed - it is very sweet. We would make again, but with out the apple topping.

The gingerbread was wonderful! The gingerbread pudding was good. I will try to make it again before I make my final decision on this recipe. The bread pudding was not as gooey as others I have tried and I thought there would be a stronger gingerbread flavor when all put together. The candied apples were a really nice touch and tasted really good with the warm gingerbread puddings.
