Delicious!! I started with a Tbs. or so of olive oil for the saute step and cut WAY back on the butter in the 2nd step. I only had dried marjoram on hand and can't wait to try with fresh.

So easy, so colorful and festive and so delicious. Love the make-ahead factor for holiday meal-planning and the marjoram is an unexpected and tasty addition. I've made this a number of times for large gatherings. A keeper.

I didn't get passed the boiling the green beans in salted water. They were so fresh and tender I couldn't spoil them with butter. So I cut a fresh tomato into slices and added a little Kosher salt. Wonderful

We love this recipe and now have these green beans about every other week. Marjoram really is a little used spice and it has a nice little spicey kick. I have used different kinds of onions and even shallots and every version is yummy.

Absolutely delicious. The butter and the almonds make for a terrific flavour.

This is so good, and a beautiful Christmas dish! I used whole frozen green beans and steamed them while saute-ing the peppers. I didn't use onions because we had them in the potatoes and salad, but the flavor of the marjoram was a great addition. I followed others' advise: used olive oil and a lot less, then threw in the almonds to saute at the last. Such a good blend - and no salt or pepper!

Very nice dish - very easy and unique fresh flavor with the fresh marjoram. I went on line looking for a recipe to use some of the 5 lbs of frozen green beans my wife bought at Costco - thinking I would end up with the proverbial green been casserole. What a pleasant light alternative!

Terrific. I added quartered carrots (parboiled); the flavor and color they added worked nicely. Lacking a red bell pepper I substituted a red Anaheim chile from my garden, which worked as well. I forgot to add the almonds but no one missed them. Marjoram is an underrated herb that everyone should discover!

All the extra prep work did not add that much to the green beans, and they were oily.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. It was a great variation on the usual boring green beans. The marjoram addition was so unique.

I followed this recipe exactly and don't understand what all the fuss is about. We found it bland and very oily. If one were to make it again, I suggest sauteing the peppers, onions, etc. in just a teaspoon of olive oil. At the end, I would add just a tiny bit of olive oil.

I was just going to my recipe file to pull this one up for yet another Thanksgiving. Everyone requests it, every year. It is a hit, prepared exactly per the recipe. I figure one time a year, on Thanksgiving, this much butter is forgiven.

Rating: 4
This one gets 4 forks just for LOOKING so pretty -- but the flavor reaffirms it! I used Olive Oil instead of butter, and I boiled the beans longer because I like them a little less firm. I also used slivered almonds because I already had them, and added a few to the pan while it was still over heat. Delicious!

This is a side dish I've made before for a large group (Thanksgiving); however, I used shallots instead of onions, bacon pieces, mushrooms (shitakes are delicious), soy sauce, sherry, then added a splash of lime juice at the end. Everybody raved about it and insisted that I make it again this year.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I used a red onion and red and orange peppers. Also followed others advice on cooking the peppers only about 4 minutes, and using olive oil instead of butter for the final step. Great reheated too.

Nice addition to a recent dinner party. I had requests for this recipe. I left out the marjoram, and it was still tasty! Pretty presentation, tasty way to spark up green beans. The "make ahead" directions were perfect.

Rating: 4
This recipe is similar to one that I have found in another gourmet cooking book. Instead of regular onion, I use 4 or 5 shallots cut in wedges, and sauteed for only a few minutes with the red peppers - then just add the cooked al dente green beans. I do not add the marjoram or the nuts. The flavour of shallots is wonderful.

Ditch the traditional nasty green bean casserole and serve this beautiful, tasty side dish. The perfect complement to all the rich foods on the Thanksgiving or Christmas table!

Great side dish with a nice blending of flavors. I cooked the green beans and peppers ahead of time and refrigerated them (separately) overnight. It was then just 5 minutes from refrigerator to table the next day--great when there is a houseful of guests!

I was looking for a recipe for green beans with parmesan. I didn't find one, but decided that a little parmesan on this dish would probably satisfy my craving. The result was glorious, though I couldn't imagine it being as good without butter and fresh herbs. This is a very satisfying way to eat your vegetables!

Great side dish. Very easy to make. The more you carmelize the onions and peppers the better it is.

Excellent recipe to make ahead of time for a crowd. Rave reviews from guests. Fresh marjoram is often impossible to find even with the abundant choices of fresh herbs available in my grocery. I've substituted a slightly reduced quantity of fresh oregano with good results.

I made this dish last for my family last Christmas and it was a big hit. I'm planning to make it again this year. It is not only tasty, it makes a lovely holiday presentation.

This is a terrific dish to make for company because it looks so appealing and can be done ahead of time. The marjoram flavor is rather unique and adds so much to the dish. I loved the crunchiness of the almonds next to the texture of the beans and peppers.It's very simple to make so it's great for holiday dinners.

I followed recipe exactly. However, I think the recipe should read diced not sliced onions and red peppers.

Rating: 2
Maybe unfair to rate this only 2 forks when I didn't have quite enough marjoram but I found this a little on the bland side. The reason I would make it again is because of its plate appeal and simplicity.

Rating: 2
This recipe had so many reviews that I just trusted all you other cooks... thanks! I made this for a crowd (55), about 6 pounds of beans, 8 or 9 orange, red, and yellow peppers, oil instead of butter. It was part of a buffet, so I had to serve it at room temperature, which was fine. It was beautiful, and everybody liked it. It's simple, but really, that's the point. I probably wouldn't have made it without all the good comments and ideas.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to cook the peppers for just half the recommended time. They were still on the mushy side.

This recipe provides a beautiful side to any meal. i used it witha seafood dish. I did decrease the butter and omitted the marjoram because i didn't have any. it still was great and this is a recipe i will use again in the future. maybe next time i will add some chunks of potatoes for more color and substance.

This was a hit for Easter! I used olive oil instead of butter, and rosemary instead of marjoram, and about 2 TB rehydrated dehydrated chopped onions, not chopped as in the recipe. It was wonderful that way. I'll try the marjoram next time.

I wish I had added cherry tomatoes and lemon, this dish looked beautiful, but I thought it was a little bland. I will make it again because it looked so pretty on the plate!!!

This is a great vegetable dish - I make it all the time. However, I use one red pepper and one yellow pepper for colour, red onion for more colour and to give it a little sweetnes - add halved baby tomatoes at the end of the cooking. Fantastic - everyone I have served it to has enjoyed it.

Very pretty, colorful side dish. Sometimes you need a nice, lighter vegetable dish to balance out a very rich, heavey menu & this one works great.

Rating: 3
This recipe deserves its many fine reviews. Very pretty for a holiday dinner, but tasty anytime. The comments regarding the cooking time of the peppers are right on target; they can easily turn to mush if you aren't alert. I had no fresh marjoram, so added a pinch of dried to the beans, and then chopped parsley to the finished dish. I also added a dash of balsamic vinegar. The toasted almonds make this dish special; try not to omit them.

A wonderful recipe. I switched out one red pepper for a yellow pepper to add color and it worked great. A beautiful dish and a keeper recipe.

It was the perfect vegetable dish for Thanksgiving - great color! All of the preparation could be done ahead of time and then reheated just before serving. For flavor, I added a little crushed red pepper with the marjoram. After reheating it, I added a little balsamic vinegar. Lemon would also be good.

I made several different dishes for a friend's birthday dinner, and this one was one of the most successful! It's easy, but more importantly, delicious!! I even forgot to add the almonds at the end (last minute rushing around!!), but will be making it again soon, WITH them, which can only make this dish even MORE scrumptious!

Rating: 3
Beautiful presentation! I used one red, one orange, and one yellow bell pepper because that's what I had on hand. The fresh marjoram adds a wonderful pine(?)-like scent. The bell peppers and onions become very soft if you cook for the specified length of time. Finally, this recipe contains way too much butter.

So easy and soooo good! Definately a do again.

Superb way for serving green beans specially with steaks or roasted veal. Served it first time on Christmas dinner, all the family loved it, very tasty & colorful (just the right colors of the season). I added yellow peppers as well. The kids called it Xmas beans, and they keep asking for it every other day. by the way i reduced the marjoram a little bit.

This dish was very tasty and colorful (it will make a great addition to the meal when I make it again at Christmas). My guests absolutely loved it. Not only that, the recipe can be made in advance and assembled at the last minute, which earns it HUGE points in the convenience department. Make this.

An adaptation to consider if marjoram is not available... I used the 2T butter to saute the peppers and onions, but when I added the beans to the pan I also added 1.5 T toasted sesame oil (but no more butter) for an Asian flair.

Great recipe - very festive for Christmas! Easy to do, but watch the saute time on the red peppers - they may get too soft.

Rating: 3
We used a red, yellow, and orange bell pepper to give the dish more color. Very festive looking when finished, and has a nice flavor. It is hard to find fresh spices in our area, so we had to use ground marjoram in a jar. It was hard to judge how much to use. Be careful not to overcook the peppers - we did and the dish turned out a little too mushy for our taste. We'll cut down on the saute time next time.

This is a easy and delicious recipe. Epicurious should cross reference this dish under Christmas, because the colors are perfect for the season.

In a word - amazing. This is the best green bean dish I've ever tasted. The combination of the onion, marjoram, and red peppers with the crunch of the green beans in perfect. I left out the almonds due to allergies and was unable to use fresh marjoram - I'm sure if I was able to make the dish as directed, it would only be better.

Nice and easy. To cut down on butter, I microwaved separately onion and peppers before mixing them with the beans.
