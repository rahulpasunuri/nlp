Good flavor on the sauce. I over-cooked the beans (my fault). But quite tasty and healthy.

Simple and delicious and every member of the family, even those who claim to dislike beans, loved it. I used peanut butter because my almond butter was way past its 'use by' date, but will make it again trying both almond and cashew butter.

This was quick and easy. We used peanut butter and soy sauce, and it still turned out as a tasty side dish!

Yum, Yum!! This was so fast and easy to make, but still had big delicious results. I substituted almond butter for the cashew butter and soy sauce for the tamari, but don't think it drastically changed the flavor. Love that this side can be done ahead and served at room temp - perfect for the picnic/bbq season.

This was great. I used the natural cashew butter as the recipe called for. VERY easy with great results. Would definitely recommend and will make again. Was served with Tuna Kebabs with Ginger-Chili Marinade and Coriander Rice (Epicurious recipes). This side goes very well w/Asian inspired mains exp. marinated grilled meats.

These were really delicious - I used almond butter as the other two reviewers. A simple and tasty way to liven up green beans.

I also used almond butter instead of cashew butter. I could eat the sauce by the spoonful it was so good.

I blanched the beans for a good five minutes. This sauce is delicious and my 3 year old actually liked it!
