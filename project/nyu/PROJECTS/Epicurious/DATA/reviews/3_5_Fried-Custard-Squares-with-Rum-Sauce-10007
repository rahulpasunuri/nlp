I only gave it 3 forks because I'm not a huge fan of star anise. The star anise can be a bit overwhelming if you're not accostomed to the flavor. If in doubt substitue a vanilla bean (which is more the Italian version anyway). My grandmother didn't add the cinnamon either! She ignited it with Grand Marnier or perhaps another orange flavored brandy or liquor, but it was served with strips of thinly sliced orange rind steeped in a sugary, orange syrup as well. Memories of youth...ahhh....

I had been searching for ages for a recipe my grandmother used to make called Fried Cream in Blue Flame (an old Italian recipe. Instead of bread crumbs she used finely ground almonds, andthe cinnamon was not used. The Blue Flame referred to Brandy which was ignited as you poured it over the fried custard. Quite a show!
