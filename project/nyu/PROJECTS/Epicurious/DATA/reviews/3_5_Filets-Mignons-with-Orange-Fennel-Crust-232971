This is an excellent recipe. My wife and I make this every year for New Years Eve and for the Fourth of July.

Very nice change of pace for filet. I followed the advice others did and increased orange and fennel, and decreased salt. what's nice is that it doesn't overpower a good piece of meat, just gives it a different slant. Easy too.

Very tasty, with these minor adjustments: I heeded the wisdom of reviewers who said the crust was too salty and reduced the salt by 1/2 and still found it to be a little too salty for my taste. So next time I will use maybe 1/3 the required salt. I also added extra zest and a little extra crushed fennel seed, and I found the flavors/aromas more satisfying that way. I served this with haricot verts w/ shallot-mustard dressing and a potato-leek gratin for New Years dinner. Guests loved it.

I used slivered almonds instead of fennel seed in the crust mixture, but did everything else as listed. It was AWESOME!!! I will definitely make this again!

I have made this recipe several times and it always gets rave reviews. However, I agree with the person who said not to put too much salt in the crust.

We were looking for something different to do with tenderloins. This was it! We prepared as written, and it was delicious and easy.

This was very uninspiring. We could barely taste the orange or fennel, which was disappointing, and I even used a little more zest than was called for. Oh well...

I've made this recipe twice and consider it a keeper. Don't use too much salt in the fennel crust.

This was simple and delicious. The flavors were interesting and complimentary. I repeat very few recipes, but I would definitely repeat this one.

This was good, but not great. Anytime you cook filet mignon without overdoing it, the texture will be sublime, but I didn't find the recipe so uniquely wonderful that I am thinking about when I will make it again.

Following the cooking times exactly produced a perfectly cooked (medium rare, on the rare side) steak. Fabulous. Not sure about the crust though - it's DIFFERENT, to be sure, but fennel and steak seemed odd to pair. Would be good with fish, no doubt. And I found the crust/crumb topping to be WAY too salty. I eventually scraped it off - but my husband liked it and ate it all. AWESOME with the rosemary potato wedges. That recipe is a keeper.

Outstanding! Paired the steaks with Potato Wedges with Rosemary Butter as suggested. An outstanding collection of flavors. My guests were equally impressed I also strongly agree with rgcards note!

Awesome. An orange juice port reduction would be a really nice addition.

Used the recipe only for basic filet mignon after our grill died. Only salt, pepper, hot Hungarian paprika rud. Perfect steak with timing exact, although did use convection oven @500 on roast setting. It should work for whatever embellishments one chooses, butI move toward simplicity.
