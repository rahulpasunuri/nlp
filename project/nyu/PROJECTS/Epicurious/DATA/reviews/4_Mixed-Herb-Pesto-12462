Perfection. A great way to thin out the herb garden and its flexible enough to allow for what you have on hand. I've made it with mint instead of the tarragon for an interesting twist. I've also thrown in garlic if I was in the mood. Adaptable, easy, but perfect as written.

Excellent recipie! Best part it uses all the herbs I have taking over my garden right now. Anyone know how long it will freeze?

A nice recipe when your herb garden needs to be trimmed! I used 1 C basil and 1/2 C parsley and 2 cloves of garlic.

A wonderful recipe that does not depend on, or even include, garlic. I'm alergic to the stuff. My guest disliked pesto because he dislikes the overuse of garlic. This recipe was thus a wonderful treat and a surprise. I did, however, vary it slightly. I used twice the basil and half the parsley, as I that's what I had in the herb garden, didn't bother to toast and cool the walnuts, and used preground parmesan (and Kraft at that). It was still delicious, though I believe I will try to go with the original recipe's proportions of parsley to basil. I also added a dash of onion powder, though I think chives would work better. But neither are necessary. I'm so glad to have a pesto recipe that doesn't depend on garlic.
