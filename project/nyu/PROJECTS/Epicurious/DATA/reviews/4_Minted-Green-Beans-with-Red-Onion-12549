about to make this for the 5th time, really nice light flavor, my kids love it cause the green beans are nice and crispy, everyone will be sick of it by the end of the summer cause i will continue to make it, also, i ran out of white wine vinegar and subbed in white balsamic vinegar and it worked fine

Nice. You can't have too many ways to prepare green beans, especially in the summer.

Quick, easy, and very good. I served it with the Grilled Monster Pork Chops with Tomatillo & Green Apple Sauce. I would use this bean recipe again.

This is excellent when eaten minutes after you prepare it and even the next day. Very summery and flavorful.
