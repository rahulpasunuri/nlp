Add about a half-cup of green chili salsa to it for a little more kick and texture. I've made it several times this way, served with corn crackers and it's always been popular.

Here's a variation that perks up the taste and improves texture: Use only 1 envelope gelatin. Use 1 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo. Add one 14.5 oz can of Diced Basil, Garlic and Oregano Tomatoes, well drained (use juice for other dish). Increase lemon juice to at least 2Tbl. I put this mixture into six small ramekins (perfect fit) and it was great! Very tasty and texture not like lead. Also, I really liked this warmed in the microwave for about 1/2 minute. It was creamy, like a thick porridge and the tastes came out even better than when eaten cold. Yum!

Made this dish in a fresh lemon shell as part of my lemon theme party. We liked the idea and the presentation, but as others have written, the recipe lacked zip. I would make this idea again, but add jalapeno, not so much gelatin and perhaps mayo instead of sour cream.

This recipe is wonderful. I have made it several times in individual molds and serve it with tortilla chips at bbq parties and everyone loves it. I always add some freshly chopped cilantro, chopped jalapeño chiles (not too many)and chpped green onions..the result is great!

I thought this dish was unique and quite delicious! I served it on a bed of lettuce with sliced tomatoes. Everyone loved it!

Yes this recipe needs help. I added 2 finely chopped green onions (scallions) 1 4oz can of chopped mild green chiles, 1 tsp hot green chile powder and a dash of Crystal hot sauce. I poured it into individual molds (used a non stick muffin pan) and turned it out on top of an arugula salad. All my guests raved about this opener. Very easy to do. It made twelve servings.

This recipe was only "fine." It needs something. I added a little more garlic. Hot sauce maybe? No one touched it at the party.
