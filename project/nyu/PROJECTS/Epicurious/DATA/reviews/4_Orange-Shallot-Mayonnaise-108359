i was going to make this mayo to use on a potato salad, however i had some hard boiled eggs and mixed it in to make citrus-y devilled eggs instead. these were a hit! used blood orange juice (from a bottle), and had to substitute vidalia onions since i mistakenly thought i had shallots on hand. when mixing in with the egg yolks, i also added some salt, a bit of lime juice from one wedge, and a couple shakes of nutmeg. i'd love to make this mayo again with shallots as originally intended to see how the flavor changes.
