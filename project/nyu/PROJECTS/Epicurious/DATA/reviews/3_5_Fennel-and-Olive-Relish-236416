Sorry for the double review--I' ve now tried it, and it's delish! Especially surprising because I've never cared for fennel in the past...

I haven't tried this yet, but I found a restaurant dish that may answer "what do I put this on?" Ciabatta Bread topped with Olive Fennel Relish and Manchego Cheese

I thought this was tasty, but wasn't sure what it would go with. It kind of overwhelms anything you put it on. My husband and mom both thought it was really strange, but didn't dislike it. It has a nice crunchy refreshing texture, but next time I'll just make an olive relish.
