I tried this once with dried cherris and it was okay. My husband was not wild about the sauce. With the rave reviews, I thought I would try again with fresh cherries, and found it was still not great. I think there are much better lamb recipes on this site

It's not cherry season yet, but luckly I was able to puchase some "Benjamin Twiggs Cherry Concentrate" This is a simple cherry juice that is very concentrated (no added sugar). I used that and a little wine to thin it and dried cherries. It was GREAT! My husband loved it, and we will definitely make it again. This is a very good way to make this dish when cherries are not available. Yum!

OK the oversupply of cherries in the NW this season, huge basil plant in yard and some kicking lamb loin chops in the freezer made me notice this. The note to use the 8 oz Knudsen Black Cherry concentrate (w/o diluting) for the sauce was spot on! So easy...so tasty...so upscale for a weeknight. Cook this for yourself or to impress for a dinner party. Enjoy!

The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. The second time I couldn't get the unsweetened cherry juice and had to settle for a cran cherry sweetened juice. It came out great, too. Used a rack of lamb from Costco and just cut up the ribs. Served with the salad and added a bit more of the Greek cheese rounds. My husband raved over it! Will definitely make again, next time with guests for dinner.

So, I changed it up a bit. I used lamb chops because they were less expensive and just added a couple of minutes more per side. I also love a little sweet with my lamb, so I used a bit of black cherry soda in place of the unsweetened juice. I omitted the onions. It turned out FABULOUS! I will so make this again! Perfect for company!

This recipe is extremely delicious and very easy! It's a decadent dish to serve for a special occasion. I had to reduce the onion and cherry juice for 15 minutes before it thickened up. Otherwise followed this recipe exactly.

Made this for my mom's birthday. It was awesome! Super easy to prepare, yet tasted like a lot of work went into it. We've made it several times since then, and it has always gotten rave reviews from people. I found cherry juice at Trader Joe's, Whole Foods and Henrys.

A great dish! I did not have any cherry juice, so I used a big, fruity zinfandel that declared it was full of cherries on the label. My husband, who is not a big lamb fan, went back for seconds. About a month later, I fixed it while visiting with my father. At 83, it's hard to find anything that pleases him. He asked for thirds. I've definitely added this to my recipie box and it will be a family favorite!

Outstanding! This recipe tastes like an expensive, laborious restaurant recipe but comes together in a snap. The most time consuming portion is pitting your cherries. The sauce is rich and complex. I paired it with sauteed kale and a wild rice/hazelnut pilaf. FYI, Knudsen makes an 8 oz unsweetened black cherry concentrate that works perfectly in the sauce, just pour it in - don't dilute.

I made this for Mother's Day and it was delicious. It was so fast and it turned out so tastey, I was really surprised. I didn't pair it with the salad that had the cherries because I thought the menu was a little "too-cherry", particularly since the cherry sauce on the lamb chops is so distinctive. I will definitely make this again.
