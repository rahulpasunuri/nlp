what a great savory for breakfast! I used pilsubry pie crusts cut to size instead of empanada wraps and kept the empanadas chilled until I was ready to fry them. my family raved.

I'm getting ready to make this again right now. I used soy chorizo which doesn't take as long to cook so I added it in at the same time as the potatoes. Delicious!

I used puff pastry sheets brushed with egg water to seal. Could'nt make them fast enough. Convection ovens rule with these.

Use any meat, pork, chicken or fish combined with any favorite filler and you will see just how versitle this turnover can be.Also don't bother trying to force air out of the pocket. It just browns and flakes better after cooking. And the presentation will be more befitting of the culture.

It smelled wonderful mixing everything up but came up quite short when eating it. It was okay but not great. I love spicy food and this one wasn't it. I won't bother making it again.

A great meal, definitely is best when fresh off the frying pan. If you like spicy foods, this one's for you
