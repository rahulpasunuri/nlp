I have made this a dozen or more times, as my kids really love this recipe. I use whatever cherry tomatoes I have on hand, red, yellow, etc. I agree with the previous review that if you have the time to brine the chops, it does come out better, but as a quick weeknight meal, I don't always remember to do that.

Easy and delicious! It's a great way to use the abundant heirloom cherry tomatoes in our garden. We've made it twice now and will make it many more times. There are couple of changes that we made, we brine the pork chops first before grilling them. The onions and tomatoes are still cooked in a pan on the stove.

This is our favorite pork chop recipe - it's quick and easy and always turns out great! I can't always find yellow grape tomatoes, so I just use more red ones, and it's still wonderful!

I made this using some leftover tomato sauce instead of tomatoes, and red onion. It was delicious!

Since I have made this over 25 times I thought I should send in a review. My husband always says "Don't change a thing" I do ...no changes needed. perfect!

I just made this for the first time and it was easy and delicious. I took the advice of a prior cook and marinaded the pork in good dry white wine for about 1 hour.I also "marinated" the cooked onions and cherry tomatoes in about 1/8 cup of good balsamic while the porked cooked. Then, after browning the chops on both side, I put the cherry tomatoes and golden onion mixture on top of the pork, lowered heat and simmered until done - a few minutes. Yummy. I served it with a light bulgar wheat with lemon and a nice Sauvignon Blanc. You will be happy you made this dish.

I followed the advice of a few previous posters and did a "marinade" for the onions and tomatoes while the pork was cooking. I also added basil. Made this dish better! I'd also agree that going heavy on the balsamic is not bad. The reduction creates a nice sauce. I, unfortunately, overcooked the pork as a result of fear of pink pork.

Have made this recipe repeatedly. Sometimes I leave out the onions, and it still tastes great. I find that using high-quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar makes all the difference.

Really really good. I added mushrooms and sauteed them with the onion first. Make sure to brown the onions well -- it makes all the difference to this recipe. Not bad at all for a clean up the fridge meal.

Firstly, the timing for the chops was off. Secondly, the tomato/onion recipe was a very poor imitation of the roasted shallots with grape tomatoes included in "Veal Chops with Roasted Shallots ..." which I do all the time and successfully pair with chicken, fish and pork. Also, there's obviously something under the chop which is apparently a secret! My guess mashed potato with green onion. I was very disappointed in this recipe.

I made this dish last night. I added some fresh basil before removing the skillet from heat. It was perfect for the busy weeknight. Fast, easy, and delicious. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it!

I'm not experienced with cooking pork, and this was the first time I didn't mess it up. Super easy to make, and just delicious.

I saute the onions as written, then, while the pork chops are cooking, I put the onions with the sliced tomatoes into a bowl with a fair amount of balsamic vinegar poured over them. Once the chops are browned on both sides, I add the entire tomato/balsamic/onion mixture back on top of them and lightly cover. The pork chops come out juicy and glazed by the vinegar. Really yummy!

I thought it was okay but nothing worth repeating. I'm actually sorry I wasted all the tomatoes on this dish.

So easy! I grill the pork and saute the onions and tomatoes seperately with garlic and extra balsamic. The onion and tomato topping is also delicious with chicken.

I give this 2 forks, husband gives it 3. Simple, very tasty. I threw in some portobello mushrooms as well, and the leftover tomato, onions, and mushrooms was DELISH. Give it your own twist, and it's a keeper.

This recipe is very simple but delicious. The wilted tomatoes and golden onions compliment the pork surprisingly well. I like it slightly generous on vinegar.

By the way - those of you who are concerned with the amount of olive oil, this recipe is Italian-influenced. For this reason we must think of the olive oil as a seasoning rather than just something to use as a saute. An Italian chef would be likely to add additional olive oil over the vegetables AFTER cooking as well.

This was a great, quick summer Sunday dinner dish when everyone was too busy outside to bother much in the kitchen. Made one change - I grilled the chops instead of cooking them in the pan - can't possibly resist grilling in good weather since it has to carry us through the entire winter here in the cold land. Note to chefs finding pork too dry, it's the pork, not the recipe. Berkshire pork is the only way to go as it's not so lean. It's hard to find right now but luckily we have a farmer nearby who brings it to the St. Paul Farmers' Market. Otherwise, brine the chops in salted water before cooking but then watch the salt in the recipe.

.A very easy recipie and so tasy. I will definitely make this again

I thought it had a nice taste and was fairly easy to make. I did make some adjustments though; I sliced a pork loin about 1 1/2" and let it marinate in white wine with S&P and a sprinkle of thyme for about 2 hours. Then I grilled the chops seperately as I was cooking the onions. I added the the chops and the tomatoes to the onions, poured in the vinegar (I thought it needed more than called for) and covered for a few minutes. The pork was very moist and didn't have that 'plain' taste that some reviewers commented on. I served it with the grilled potato & blue cheese salad on this site.

While i've used many epicurious.com recipes, this is the first i'm revieving as it was so spectacular, we were eating for sport long after we were full. My fiance calles it my masterpiece to date. SO delicious. Will be a once-a-week-dish!!

I liked the onion, tomato and sauce part. My chops came out ok. Not sure if it was me or the recipe. I LOVED the veggies with the scallion potatoes in the picture. Went back for seconds on that, not the chops, the chops were a little tough. Cooked too long? Too short?

It's a bit tiresome and dangerous when chopping baby tomatoes but otherwise it's fantastic!

For being a simple recipe, this was delicious, and quick! I will use a little less olive oil on the onion cooking step next time- it left the salsa a bit greasy.

Excellente! the blend of cherry tomatoes and balsamic vinegar is fantastic. Not to mentiion the perfectly sauteed pork chops.

I coated the chops with ground nutmeg and grilled them. I panfried the onions in a tablespoon of virgin olive oil added fresh from my garden tomatoes and then a splash of white wine vinegar. I served it with a green salad.

This made for a delicious meal! I added more balsamic vinegar than the recipe called for. If you use a high quality vinegar and love the taste it makes for a great sauce. I didn't have yellow grape tomatos on hand, but one pint of red grape tomatos was more than sufficient. A definite repeat!

DELICIOUS and very easy to make!! My new favorite for pork chops. I didn't follow the recipe to a tee because I didn't have grape tomatoes so I just chopped up a vine ripened tomato. I also added some red and yellow peppers since I only had one tomato and one medium sized onion. The pork chops were very juicy and veggies were very flavourful. This recipe is probably great exactly as written.

The ingredients and textures didn't come together well in this recipe--the onions were soft and rich, the tomatoes also soft, but a little tart, and the whole thing seemed too tart and not flavorful enough.

This was a tasty way to serve pork. I used pork loin, roasted & added drained yellow peppers in a jar to the sauce. It was a nice mix of interesting flavors.

I made this for dinner tonight and found it to be just okay. My husband liked it better than I did. The PLAIN sauteed chops remain flavorless even topped with the onions and tomatoes. Not a disaster but not worth a repeat.

I thought this was quite good - fairly quick, easy, nice flavor. My boyfriend thought it was better than at a restaurant - but he always says that. I would try to add a little yellow pepper next time.

I will definately make these pork chops again!! The balsamic vinager adds a depth of flavor and frankly the chops tasted better the next day.

This is very simply delicious. Like the photo, I served it with mashed potatoes. Toasted-Barley Mashed Potatoes were perfect [email me if you would like the recipe]. This ranks among my favorite pork chop recipes. I highly recommend it for an easy yet special dinner.

As promised, this is an easy recipe. I couldn't find the yellow tomatoes, so I used all red. It's a good recipe to put together at the last minute. The tomato and onion combination, with the balsamic vinegar goes together wonderfully. I served it with a fresh cut corn, peppers and tomato salad that I picked up ready-made at a supermarket deli. The leftovers made a great Saturday lunch.
