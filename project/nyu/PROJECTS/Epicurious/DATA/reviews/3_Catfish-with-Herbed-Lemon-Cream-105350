Nice dish but I subed lime for lemon and added a dash of fresh tyme works well with Tilapia also

I made this with Tilapia instead of catfish but it would work with any white flaky fish or even chicken. It was fast, quick, and easy as heck to make. I added a bit more zest and black pepper than called for and covered it for a bit after turning to speed up cooking the center. Excellent fast week night meal.

A disaster of epic proportions...though I suspect that is b/c my new stove runs a little hotter then I am used to and had an issue with the covering not staying on the fish. I certainly did not enjoy this with catfish, as stated it might work better with trout or a snapper. The sauce was odd...chunky, and musky.

Wow I was surprised how badly this turned out. The catfish took MUCH longer than 3 minutes per side. Also the sauce was wierd -- too strong and lumpy. Nor am I crazy about the corn meal breading.

This was the first time I have ever cooked catfish and it was really nice. The lemon cream would be fantasic with many other dishes as well.

Looked lovely. I'd make more sauce if I did it again and probably spice up the coating a bit. Had it with cornbread and mole beans though and it was good and simple.

This was a great summery dish. Although it tastes like it was difficult to make, it's actually quite simple. Instead of catfish, I used tallapia, which tasted great. I served it with a mixed greens salad and followed it up with a cool, simple dessert. I think a lemon sorbet would match it well.

Very easy to make. The sauce was tasty, but there wasn't that much of it. Next time I'll try this with a different fish (maybe trout?), since it's a simple and somewhat spare preparation that depends on a high-quality fish as a foundation.

Did I do something wrong? I'm not a novice, but the cream sauce didn't resemble sauce. Just a tasteless, clotty mess. Any advice?

I don't understand all the rave reviews about this dish. I thought it was very average and bland. Nothing I would make again. It was easy, but not so great tasting.

Made this last night for friends and it went over very well. I thought the sauce wasn't right (too much lemon and a little flat) but in a leap of faith I put it on the fish anyway and the combination was wonderful. I used dried thyme and wish I would have sent the husband for the fresh.

I just made this recipe tonight. So quick and easy and wonderfully flavorful. Served it with coleslaw and homemade cornbread. would have been great with smoked vegetables. This will be a stock recipe in my repetoire.

I love this recipe. It's fast and inexpensive and tastes very fresh. The only change I would make is that to make the sauce, you must lower the heat significantly--otherwise it burns.

I thought the fish came out very tastly, but didn't care much for the sauce. It was a little overpowering. I would make the fish coating again, but with a light lemmon and butter sauce.

This is one of the best catfish dishes I have ever made. It is simple and very quick. I serve it with cole slaw and corn bread, which I think the magazine recommended.

This is a wonderful catfish recipe. The crust was very good and the creamy lemon sauce finished it off nicely. It was quick, easy and made with ingredients I usually have on hand. I would even serve this to guests.

We thought this was delicious. The cream sauce makes the dish though - very flavorful and easy. Next time I will probably try it with orange roughy or sole though.
