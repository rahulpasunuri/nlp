A review of only the ice cream: I wanted to lighten it up just a bit, so I substituted 2 whole eggs for the 6 yolks. I also left out the vanilla because it masked the brown butter taste (tried it with part of the batch). Unbelievably delicious.

I was trying to use ingredients I had, substituted non-fat milk and it was fine. LOVE THE FLAVOR! Used chocolate covered peanut brittle and it is decadent. Definitely strained as the custard had clumps, I pushed them through and it was good and smooth. My husband and boys ate the whole batch in one sitting.

This has become my base for all Ice Creams that I make. It made a fantastic butter pecan by using salted roasted pecans instead of the brittle. It also made a great Strawberry Rhubarb and my next attempt is too make a mint chocolate chip by adding fresh mint to the cream. I use salted butter and omit the 1/4 tsp salt. I also do not strain the browned butter. I love the little brown bits in the ice cream.

I've made this twice already and think it's one of the best ice cream recipes I've seen in a while. Very easy to make and freezes beautifully. The flavor is very similar to butterscotch.

YES!YES!YES! think "when harry met sally" ( you know the scene) that's how good this is. for over the top decadence i added a chocolate ganache on top of each serving presented in a champagne glas.
