What an annoying mess. I had to throw about 8 peppers away because the skin was so difficult to remove and the peppers tore. Wish I read the tip about using oil first.

Just so you know, it's much easier to peel the chiles if you rub a film of vegetable oil over them first. They will blacken quicker and not overcook the chiles, leaving them firm enough to make Chiles Rellenos. Without the oil, you'll struggle to get every bit of skin off, leaving the chile bitter.

Your way is simple and quick. I use a grill and often get them too charred. The wrap on the dish is clever--very good. I ate about half the peppers before the meal was finished. GLT
