I did not make the parfait portion, just the shortcake. The shortcake portion of this is basically a scone. It is very, very sweet and the orange zest really overpowers the almond taste. If I made this recipe again, I would really cut down on the orange zest and the sugar, particularly in the almond mixture for the glaze. I was unable to find almond paste so I did make my own. The homemade almond paste was very good, with a strong almond flavor, so that does not seem to be the reason that the almond flavor was overpowered.
