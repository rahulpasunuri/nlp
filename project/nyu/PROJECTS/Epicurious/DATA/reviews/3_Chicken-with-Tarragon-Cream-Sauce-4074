I've made a varation of this dish for years. My version has 1/2 of an onion and I use sour cream instead of the whipping cream plus a little salt and pepper to taste. I think the sour cream add a little complexity that is missing with the whipping cream.

I haven't made this, but it looks very similar to another dish on here called "Baked Tarragon Chicken Thompson" which is beyond compare. If you're thinking of making this, my recommendation would be to compare it with the (5 ingredient!) other -- it's outstanding.

This is an excellent recipe. We beefed up the amount of Tarragon a bit, but you probably wouldn't need to. Our guest at dinner thought this was one of the best chicken dishes he had ever had. A definite keeper!

ok, but fairly blah. I love tarragon, but can think of lots of more interesting ways to use it.

I stumbled across this recipe when searching for a use for tarragon. I had some in the herb garden that was starting to look a bit leggy. The sprigs I used were about 8 inches long. Prepared as written and Wow! The chicken was moist. Tarrgaon infused the chicken just right. Served with Ina Gartens Basmati rice recipe, which was perfect for sopping up the sauce.

This has become the old standby recipe in our house - it never fails! I have experimented with it, and have found that stuffing the chicken with a halved onion and garlic clove adds good flavor. Also, instead of water, I use chicken broth and some white wine for basting. Works great with capon too!

I thought this dish was OK but certainly not spectacular. I couldn't get the cream to thicken after boiling (and boiling) so made a paste of flour and butter and whisked it in. It was then nicely thickened but as my husband said - it was missing something, somewhat bland. Next time I will try to make the sauce with some sauteed shallots which I think will add a nice flavor.

For a week night, didn't want to mess with a whole chicken, so just used boneless, skinless chicken breast and sauteed in olive oil with some extra tarragon. Was great!

This dish was absolutely delicious, and a snap to make. Fresh tarragon wasn't available, so I substituted dried, and it was fine. I'll definitely make it again soon.

This recipe is easy to make and impresses everyone who tries it. The rich flavor of the tarragon cream sauce tastes as "gourmet" as it can get.

My husband raved about it. The butter made the chicken's skin brown beautifully, and the sauce was really tasty and not hard to prepare, either.

Excellent dish for introducing children to the incomparable flavor of tarragon. Can't hook kids early enough on good food.
