I put this topping on a pizza which I cooked in the oven. It tasted great but it was a little watery and made the cheese slide off. I squeezed the water out before I put it on the pizza but it was still too liquidy. I didn't mix the cheese with the tomatoes. I just put the cheese on top like any pizza. I might tweak my technique next time but we liked it quite well anyway.

I left out the balsamic vinegar and green onions, and added more chopped tomatoes. The flavor was fantastic and the pizza crust came out crisp.

good way to use up summer tomatoes and basil. used boobli crust and doubled toppings ingredients. husband and daughter both said (without being asked)it was really good, and my husband doesn't like pizza. definitely make this. I rarely give anything 4 forks, let alone a pizza, but this recipe gets it by popular acclaim.

I loved the idea of this, but I felt there was way too much oil and vinegar and the scallions were overpowering. That said, pizza is all about making it to your liking. I used extra garlic and fresh mozzarella and will make again with some alterations to the tomato mixture.

Make sure your grill isn't too hot, because the crusts will burn in no time.

This is a great recipe. Very easy. I didn't have any pizza dough on hand, so i used a large flour tortilla instead. I cooked the tortilla on a skillet until it was brown, then put in a little of the tomatoe mixture. Very tasty!

This was very good. However, 4 minutes per side was too long. I only needed to grill it about 2 minutes per side. I guess it just depends on how thick your dough is so definitely keep an eye on it.

We added spinach and mushrooms that my husband saute lightly in garlic/oil. Oh my! This recipe reminds us of the wonderful pizza we get at Tacconelli's in Philly. The best pizza you'll ever have.

The whole family likes this one. We also pre-grill the crust now & it works great.

Great recipe! We like topping the pizza just before serving with baby greens drizzled with balsamic vinegar, it is a wonderful fresh flavor.

Instead of oiling the grill, I brushed the dough with basil flavored oil. Definitely brown one side and then flip it over to brown the other side. I found it's easier to handle if you cut the dough into manageable size pieces - like individual pizzas. Fresh mozz is the only way to go. My extremely finicky family loved this.

Thanks everyone for the excellent tips - it's one of the big advantages of this site and I'm grateful.

My family and I love grilled pizza also. One of the ways we beat the soggy curst is to put my pizza stone on the grill and heat for about 45 minutes. With doing that you can use fresh dough or pre-made. It not only crisps up the bottom, but makes the top brown because you have extra heat build up.

I am a huge fan of grilled pizzas. For best results I recommend pre-heating the grill very hot and then turning it down to medium-low when you put the dough on the grates. I usually cook it for 90 seconds on the first side and 2 minutes on the second side. Sometimes I need to put it under the broiler to melt the cheese a bit more. For those of you that are a bit unsure of the process, the dough won't fall through the grates!

There is a similar pizza recipe also on Epicurious (GRILLED PIZZA MARGHERITA) that I have tried with major success. The key to crispy crust is to use less moist ingredients, i.e., if you are using tomatos, blot them dry before adding to crust. Also, what I have found to work is to grill both sides of the crust first to desired doneness. While doing this heat your oven to 450. When the crusts are done bring them in, add your toppings and stick in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese. This way the crust remains crispy. One last suggestion: use fresh mots rather then shredded once - you will love it!

I had no problem with the pizza being soggy but felt that the green onions overpowered the flavor of the pizza to the point where you could taste nothing but the green onions. I would suggest using at least half of the amount that it calls for.

I agree with the other reviewer regarding the "soggyness" factor. It was very fun, however, to grill a pizza. I would love this recipe even more with fresh dough. I prefer a crispy crust with the topping put on last minute. You would then not have melted cheese though. The freshness of the tomatoes is better than the cheese anyway!! Enjoy.

I really liked the flavors (you can't really go wrong with that combination). The one word of caution is not to put all the liquid from the oil and vinegar on the pizza - it's a little too much and leads to some sogginess.
