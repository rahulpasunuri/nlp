The recipe looks very good and healthy. I was unable to find the place where mustard oil is mentioned,which is what I was liiking for. Was this because MO is an unusual ingredient and therefore mustard seed was used? In any case it should at least be mentioned. I love your rcipes.

I love this recipe- it's great, hearty winter soup. I've made it several times over the past few years because I love the complexity that the spices gives this otherwise simple soup. It's surprisingly filling for a vegetarian dish, and totally satisfying...AMAZING scooped up on crusty french bread or on naan.

This is one of my favorite soups. I've made it a number of times, both with and without the tomato/mustard seed topping. I like it either way. I also recommend keeping it a bit chunky, not completely pureed.

We really liked this soup, even more the second day. I served it with the mustard oil and tomato/chive topping. We both agreed that it really didn't add that much. We preferred the soup the second day without it.

Yummy soup - healhty and not complicated! I did not have whole coriander or cumin seeds, only the powdered spices - but they worked just fine. This is an easy soup to "tweak" to suit your tastes.

I thought this soup was fantastic...but you simply must make both of the toppings, without them it would have been just so-so. The only change I made was to use yellow split peas since I couldn't find the red lentils; they have a very similar flavor and cook the same. The combination of the soup, tangy/crunchy mustard oil and the cool tomatoes & chives was divine...very pretty too.

Was a totally delicious soup. I pureed half the batch and left the other half chunky. I also added a whole dried smoky chipotle pepper. I served this with Baba ganouh (eggplant dish) and pitas. Everyone loved it. Even the ones who are skeptical about vegitarian dishes. One of them even ate the leftovers the next day. A compliment to the chef.

I make this fairly often for dinner. I serve it with Naan (an Indian bread)which makes a nice Lent Friday supper. I was surprised when the kids liked it. I do use green lentils because I can't find red, which does nothing for its appearance but the taste is fine. We like it but it's more of an everyday dish - nothing really special.

Our gourmet club of 8 people agreed we would not make this soup again. It was taste unfriendly and not appealing to the eye.

Great soup, We served this on New Years Eve and everyone just loved it.

Lovely soup that tastes even better the next day. Great on a cold winter day. With a pita sandwich stuffed with greens and cheese or cold cuts, this makes a complete and satisfying meal.
