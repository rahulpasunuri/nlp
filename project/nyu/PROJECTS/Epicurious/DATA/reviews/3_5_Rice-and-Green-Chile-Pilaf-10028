Great side dish. I used a can of tomatoes and chilies because that is what I already had and it turned out great. I tripled the recipe as well, which worked fine.

I have been making this rice for years, and I love it. It is so easy and is a great substitute for spanish rice, but also goes well with most meats.

I double or triple this recipe depending on how many I'm feeding that night. It goes great with fajitas! This is definitely a keeper.

I used home grown chiles, roasted. This should have been good but tasted rather metalic. I agree that cumin would add to the flavor. As for volume, I made half again the recipe to feed three of us and had another serving left over which we sacrificed to the garbage god.

I've made this recipe several times. Always comes out great. It's so easy that it allows for more attention to the main dish. I've substituted jalapenos for a portion of the green chilies, giving it a real kick. It was good, but a little spicy for the weak of heart.

Nice change to the traditional Spanish Rice. I served it with pan fried snapper with chipotle butter from this web-site. I might add some red & yellow diced peppers next time and see how that works.

delicious flavours which combined superbly with grilled pork and sage sausages.

This is such an easy recipe to make! I added in bell pepper and a little cumin (based on other reviews) which helped add some flavoring. Next time, I would like to add additional spices just to give it a little extra zest!

Love it! I made this dish twice in one weekend. The second time I added chunks of chicken breast to make it an entree instead of a side dish. The whole family loves it. Surprisingly spicy too.

This rice dish was a great compliment to the Grilled Garlic Lime Pork Tenderloin and I served it with a Grilled Portabello and Red Pepper with Rosemary Dressing on Mixed Baby Greens. My entire meal received rave reviews!!!! I would make it all again!
