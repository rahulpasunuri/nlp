Made this with "flax eggs" (1 tbs ground flax+3 tbs water/egg) and 2% greek yogurt--also used blood orange zest instead of lemon. I also skimped a bit on the sugar and oil. Next time, I may cut the sugar to 3/4 cup (or 1/2 for breakfast). Delicious! Will serve with a blood orange icing. The best part is that I was able to throw it together before heading to work in the morning. This will be a staple!

Nice big fabulously good unpretentious everyday cake. Dress it up as you please. Cakes are not my favourite thing to cook, but I have made this cake several times now and it's definitely a keeper. My favourite way to serve is with thin lemon icing drizzled over the top and sides (just mix icing sugar and lemon juice), and plonked on the table with a large pot of tea and my best teacups. Fuels much friendly chatting all afternoon ;-)

Surprisingly delicious. I thought it was going to have a gummy texture but it baked up with a nice crumb, despite using plain old yogurt rather than Greek. Tastes just like a lemon bundt cake my mom used to make. Would be excellent with berries or lemon curd if you wanted to fancy it up.

Lovely easy cake. I used melted butter and it turned out lovely. Method .... Rub sugar lemon ... Add ugs and yogurt whisk. Stream in butter, vanilla salt, throw in flour and BP... Whisk just till combined... One bowl.. 5 min. Beautiful cake. SO SO SO easy. Could use less butter but why bother. :)

Super delicious! I made a healthy change, using butter instead of oil, 1/2 c. melted. Made my own yogurt so used that. Had some leftover freshly picked blackberries and put them at the bottom of the pan before adding the batter. This will be a staple quick cake recipe from now on because it is so versatile.

Great recipe! Everyone in my family loves it, from my 4-year-old to my husband. I used the zest from three lemons, and 2% Greek yogurt since that's what I had on hand. Just before popping it into the oven, I squeezed out some lemon juice across the top and sprinkled a bit of demerara sugar. The results were lovely. Mine was done at 40 minutes. I think a little less oil next time would lighten it up a bit; it has a really nice crumb but was a tiny bit heavy. But still wonderfully delicious, lemony without being tart, sweet enough without being too much. Terrific.

Made this using blueberry Greek yogurt and added in some fresh blueberries. Delicious! Will also try lemon Greek yogurt as well. I did use cake flour as that was all I had on hand. Very easy and no mixer to mess!

Very salty, but Will try again with less salt. Crumb was nice.

This was very easy to make and I loved the fact that it had no butter. It was delicious and would be very tasty with the up coming berry season and whipped cream.

So easy and so good. Tried lemon extract instead of vanilla, but liked the vanilla better. You can use 2% or full fat yogurt. Have tried them both.Used the zest of two large lemons. Lovely in the summer with berries. Baked abt 45 minutes,Great results for so little time and effort.

I just had to make this. I thought it might be a good alternative to a pound cake. Well, I cannot even believe how good this is. I'm not actually sure how much lemon zest I put in there, but I used a whole lemon and the flavor was perfect. It is astonishing that there is no butter in this recipe (especially because it is French!). You will not miss it. This is sooooo good!

Excellent recipe! Made with 2% greek yogurt as that is all I could find. Also, I added a little more lemon zest and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice as well. Next time I may try it with a lemon glaze.

Very good--as others have mentioned, I would add more lemon zest next time. I made mine with nonfat greek yogurt rather than full fat. Other than that, made it exactly as written. I think next time I might try orange zest instead of lemon, and maybe some chopped walnuts.

So easy and yummy! I used egg substitute and nonfat greek yogurt since that's what was in the fridge. Sprinkled raw sugar on top before baking. Everyone loved it. Would add more lemon zest or even lemon extract next time.

This was an exceptionally fresh and moist cake with the bonus of being so easy to make. Last night I paired it with fresh local strawberries and whipped cream. Today it's just as good all by itself as a snack. I can see this becoming my go to recipe when I want a quick dessert.

Sometimes, when the person writing the recipe raves, I am convinced...and then I make the recipe and am disappointed. Not this time! A winner, for sure. The salt may seem like too much but it actually seems to bake out into the crust and creates this perfect contrast. So easy, so good.

Super easy to throw together, makes the house smell great, and impresses my mother in law. This cake is so yummy, I have actually made it twice already with another batch planned for Mothers Day this weekend! I think we'll make a fresh berry ice cream to go with it this summer, fresh whipped cream, cuppa joe...forget about it. I add a little extra lemon just cause I love lemon. Enjoy!

I love this cake! I've made it twice and can't stop eating it. A couple minor tweaks - per other reviews, I cut salt to 1/2 tsp. and I definitely would recommend adding more lemon zest. The second time, I used the zest of two oranges instead of lemons and that was great too.

So disappointed. 1/2 C oil (Canola) resulted in an oily taste. Nice crumb though.

Simple and delicious. I used honey Greek yogurt and gluten free flour. I'm trying it again today with a tiny bit of lime zest as well as the lemon.

Great loaf cake and good base to play around with. First made it as written but added blackberries. Then made a second one with 2 mashed bananas in lieu of 1/4 cup of the yogurt, omitted the lemon and added walnuts. Also turned out great!
