I'm not sure what happened with this biscuit. It's rated so high, but when I made it, it was bland and didn't hold together all that well. The main issue was that it just didn't have enough flavor. My Christmas guests enjoyed it more when they topped it with the cranberry side.

I used a rolling pin - much easier...these were a big hit with my freinds last night.

Perfect. Followed recipe to the letter and these biscuits came out light and fluffy with a nice crumb and golden crust.
