Only cheese cake I've ever made, and it consistently turns out so well, so I doubt I'll try another. I usually mix 1 cup of sour cream with 1/3 cup of sugar and a bit of vanilla for a frosting to hold berries in place. Then set the kids on to placing the berries on top - firecrackers exploding in the sky are a common theme. Would like to find out how to make a sour cream/chocolate sauce for a topping to be topped with raspberries.

A few tipes on this fabulous recipe, which I've been making since it first appeared in Gourmet. It was a huge hit this past 4th of July, after a glorious meal of pulled pork. 1) I always use "light" (lower-fat) cream cheese and sour cream. 2) I've left out the sour cream when I forgot to buy it to no terribly ill effect. 3) We prefer a graham cracker crust, just substituting them for the chocolate wafers. 4) Since I seem to be a ditz when it comes to decorating, I have figured out a way to use toothpicks to create the star outline. It's easier with raspberries, and I prefer the flavor, but small or halved strawberries can work too.

This was a hit at the picnic! It was all it should be: Creamy and memorable. Well worth the effort.

great cheese cake. It was a really creamy texture, which is fine, but I prefer more of a solid and sweeter cheese cake. However I made it for my family's Memorial day BBQ and every one loved it.

This dessert won a 4th of July potluck at work, though to be honest, there wasn't much competition. Filling was a little too creamy for my taste - prefer a heartier cheese filling, but presentation was great.

I made this for July 4th ten years ago and have made it at least once a year since. Everyone loves it - my family, my friends and my work colleagues. Occasionally, I make a simple raspberry sauce (raspberries, lemon juice, and sugar) for people to drizzle over their piece of the cake. If you follow the instructions, this is easy to make - and fun too. I always use blueberries and raspberries and the cake looks as good or better than the cover picture of the Gourmet magazine that I originally found it in.

GREAT!! My only change is I put strawberries and blueberries on top of the cake.

After reading all of the GREAT reviews, I just had to make this for my family's July4 BBQ!!! Since it sounded so amazingly good, and my family is large (and loves to eat!) I made 2. I used an Oreo crust for one, graham cracker crust for the other (only 4 TBS butter for OREO, the full stick for graham) I also topped the cheesecake with a sour cream topping (2 c. sour cream, 1/4 c. sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla) before decorating with fruit. Couldn't find good raspberries, so used strawberries. Also did a blueberry star on one, surrounded with cut strawberries, and a strawberry star one the other, with a blueberry border and sprinkled blueberries around the star. They were beautiful and the most DELICIOUS cheesecake anyone had ever had! I took a picture, is there any way I can post it?

I made this for July 4th but did not find it anything special. I thought it was too much effort for the end result.

I have to say I thought this was just okay. I didn't really like the texture, thought it tasted a bit bland, and the crust was soft - not soggy, but not crisp. The white chocolate cheesecake on this site is wonderful, and uses the same crust but bakes it about 10 minutes before filling, so it's harder. I think I'll try this again, but use a water bath next time which should improve the creaminess, as well as baking the crust first. My cake also split terribly on the top, which was covered by the topping, but the water bath might help with that, too. Also, I'll make sure my zest is very fine; I always use zest the same way as I did in making this, but this time the texture of it really stood out, and I didn't like that. By the way, I brought it to a party and everyone loved it -- it was just picky me that didn't because I know I can do better.

Made this for a picky eater...he loved it. Used strawberries instead of other berries and heated some strawberry jam and spiced rum together to make glaze of side sauce, poured glaze over warm....yum!

I've been making this recipe since 1993, it is PERFECT. I don't even think of trying a new recipe for cheesecake.

Yummy! I substituted neufchatel for half the cream cheese and the finished cake was even lighter...the only thing I didn't like was the top crust (could've been my oven) so I sliced it off. Instead of fresh fruit, I used a mixed berry-amaretto compote poured over the top. This one got rave reviews. t

Just made this wonderfully creamy cheesecake with a few changes. I added 1Tbl Limoncello (a lemon liquor from Italy) to the batter. I had some fresh cherries so I pitted them, cut them in half and soaked them in some more Limoncello for about 1/2 hour. I usually go for the heavier cheesecakes, but this was wonderful!!!!

This was the first time I've ever made a cheesecake. It was hard to choose from all the scrumptious-looking recipes on Epicurious, but I picked a winner! This cheesecake was really easy to make. I liked the citrus flavors, although I didn't taste them every bite -- very subtle, and the zest didn't affect the filling's creamy texture, as I was afraid it might. There weren't any good berries that day, so we had this plain, but oh my -- I can just imagine how good it is with raspberries!!

I have made this cheesecake annually since the recipe came out in the July 93 issue. It is the perfect July 4th tradition. It is lighlt sweet, and not too heavy. I've made it for other occasions with diffent fruit toppings. Enjoy!

This was a great cheesecake. Very creamy. The orange and lemon peel was flavorful. For the topping I melted 1/3 cup of seedless raspberry jam and brushed on the top. Then I placed raspberries in the middle and blueberries around the raspberries. Then I brushed the berries with the jam. It gave it a glossy look. Everyone thought it was so beautiful.

I made these in individual springform pans. The fresh fruit made for a beautiful presentation. Will make this again

I made this for a 4th of July party, and it was a big hit. Received lots of compliments on this one! The citrus zest gave a great flavor to the cheesecake. I topped it with the cherry and blueberry pie fillings as another reviewer suggested. I placed a large star-shaped cookie cutter on top and filled it with the blueberry pie filling and then placed the cherry filling around that. It looked great and tasted even better!

One of the best cheesecake recipes I have ever used. The flavors of orange and lemon were perfect and light and the texture of the cake was out of this world. I made this for our July 4th BBQ and it was a hit.

I made this cheesecake for a Teacher Appreciation lunch at my daughter's school. It was a knockout (in looks and taste). The only thing I would say is that the cheesecake was a little bland. Next time, I think I will try adding the raspberry swirl from the Raspberry Parfair recipe. I also cooked it in a water bath. Super creamy texture.

I will never buy a cheesecake again! This was the absolute best one I have ever had.

Awesome cheesecake recipe! The cheesecake was great and the chocolate wafer bottom was to die for. The citrus in the cake is just enough of an accent to make this cheesecake special. It would be great as a plain cheesecake even without the fruit decoration on top. Make sure you do put it in the baking dish as instructed because some of the butter in the wafer bottom does leak out. One time I forgot - what a mess!

Far and away the best cheesecake recipe I've used. I've done it both as described and with varriations and it is always spectacular. You can get away with low-fat cream cheese (but not no fat) without any reduction in quality.

I made this recipe for my community's Fourth of July bake-off contest. However, for some reason, I did not cook for the full hour and 10 minutes. Needless to say, it was not fully set in the center. But it still won a prize for 2nd place! Was trully delicious! I am making it again for Thanksgiving.

I made this cheesecake when it first came out in 1993 and then lost the recipe. I have been looking for it ever since! Absolutely the most mouthwatering cheesecake ever! I used Chocolate Teddy Grahams for the crust (couldn't find wafers) and have made it just as the recipe is written, but omitted the berries and instead decorated the top and sides with nastursiums (spelling? flowers from our garden). AND once I made it with crushed Oreos folded into the cream cheese mixture. Sinful!

Excellent! Used chocolate grahams as we could not find chocolate wafers. Cake is moist, light and delicious. Good with no topping or any topping!

I made this receipe for a 4th of July cookout and everyone loved it. Even the most finicky eaters had a piece. I used chocolate graham crackers (couln't find wafers) and on top used cherry and blueberry pie filling.

I took this to a family reunion and it was gone before the other desserts were even touched. I forgot to put in the sour cream and the cake was still very creamy. The raspberries at my grocery store were moldy so I used cherry pie filling instead. And for the crust I used Oreos with 3 tablespoons of butter.

Great recipe, used a little more zest than recommended and graham cracker crust. Even following the detailed baking instructions, the cake split on top, but it's all covered up with the fruit!

I've been asked to bring this cake on so many occasions, I'm starting to wonder if it's me or the cheesecake they want to see! The citrus flavors along with the chocolate crust are fabulous. Everyone LOVES it!

I made this for some friends this weekend and it was an enourmous hit. Since it is January and the berries aren't in season, I topped it with the ganache topping from the epicurious recipe for the Almond Joy cheesecake. It looked beautiful and tasted amazing. I will definitely make this one again!

I hate those who change the recipe then blast it, but wanted to give a warning on this one. DON'T use fat-free cream cheese. It is awful. I can usually make the substitution and it still turns out, but this recipe doesn't work at all. So, if you make it, use the real stuff.

I have used this recipe faithfully since it first appeared in Gourmet. The fruit is a wonderful touch (especially in July) but this cheesecake can stand alone with ease just as well in December.

I have made this cheesecake almost every year since it has been on the cover in 1993. It is delicious---Even better it is so festive! I put it on a red pedestal plate with little flags around it. So Fun!

This is a traditional 4th of July dessert for our holiday family reunion at the beach. Because I will be VERY pregnant this 4th, I can't go this year. I was thrilled to find this recipe so my husband and I can have our own 4th of July celebration.

I have made this cheesecake twice and each time it turned out great. Actually it is very simple to put together but looks great with fresh berries on top.
