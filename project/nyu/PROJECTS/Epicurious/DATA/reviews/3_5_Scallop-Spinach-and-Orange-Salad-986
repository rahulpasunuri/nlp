I didn't have oranges, so I used canned mandarin oranges (sweetened with Splenda to cut the carbs) and used the juice with just a tbsp or so of OJ. I had tangerine infused balsamic vinegar and blood orange olive oil (Florida Olive Oil company) which I used. i cut the butter a little, used a plain white onion, and pan sauteed the scallops as others suggested. it was amazing! I also used walnuts instead of almonds since that's what I had

This is on the go-to list. Don't bother with the schmancy circles of scallops unless you like futzing around. Just dry the scallops off and then saute til browned. If you don't slice them up they won't overcook. I add crisp sauted prosciutto to the salad (and skip the almonds) - adds salt and crunch. Perfect light dinner.

A rare 4 forks! As usual, I had to tweak this, but not much: I pan seared the scallops whole - easier to control than broiling - in olive oil and a bit of butter. Sauted the onion with a little fresh ginger (didn't have shallots on hand), reduced all of the sauce, added just a dab more of butter and then used it to wilt the spinach. Added sauted, crisp (puleeze not crispy!)prosciutto for a little texture and salt and some avocado just because. Delicous and healthy too.

This is a great recipe with a few modifications (hence the 3 forks).I use much less dressing than called for. I don't use the butter. I simply stir fry the scallops. Finally, I dress the salad, including the scallops, almonds, orange, with the reduced dressing to wilt the spinach.

This recipe was easy and delicious, the seasoning for the scallops was perfect, but I didn't feel like the topping sauce actually added much to the salad, the dressing was rich enough. I would also strain out the shallots after they flavored the dressing because eating one straight was too strong. Over all it was yummy and I'd make it again

Good main dish salad. The reduced salad dressing drizzle was really good.

Loved the dressing! I added a tablespoon of fresh minced basil for more zest, and it was great. I added it while the sauce was reducing to bring out the basil. I also cut the butter down by more than half. This time I added goat cheese, but I won't do this again. I felt the melty goat cheese made the sauce too fatty and creamy due to the alread existing butter. I might try feta next time. I also used pine nuts and it still tasted great. I probably will also reduce all of the dressing next time, not setting aside the 1/4 cup. The reduction makes a difference.

My guests enjoyed this very much. I made the scallops as written and they looked like they were going to be too dry as I began to broil them. I was glad for the previous reviews as I threw them into a pan with butter and olive oil--much better. I also reduced all the dressing (it was delicious) and added goat cheese.

This is a dish that definitely needs adjusting. I unfortunately didn't read the reviews before cooking. Big mistake. My scallops must have been too big b/c 3 minutes of broiling wasn't nearly enough, left them in oven for extra 5 minutes and still seemed raw. Also the round overlapping design didn't work out for me, maybe them were just too thick. Too expensive to justify trying again, but had I read to saute the scallops b/f attempting to make, I might be singing another tune today.

Fast, easy, light, and absolutely scrumptous. Pan seared the scallops,added goat cheese, and reduced all of the dressing. Next time I might add crispy fried shallots.

Delicious! I pan seared the scallops in butter with a little olive oil and it turned out fabulous. Next time I will add avocado I think.

Try it with blood oranges instead & add some goat cheese. Really a beautiful presentation.

This was a fabulous start to our Christmas dinner--it presented well and was easy to make. Fresh-squeezed orange juice makes all the difference.

This was a big hit as the salad course for Christmas dinner - it was delicious and everyone loved it! The only problem I had was getting the sauce to reduce (but maybe I did something wrong).

This salad makes an excellent presentation. If you are looking to impress this is it! My husband was like "Wow! what's the occasion?" I would agree with one of the others that you do not need the full half cup on spinach beforehand. I will next time reduce it and use only that for the dressing. Also, I used 1/2 shrimp/scallop and added feta like another reviewer. Be sure to mix it well.

I don't get it. I consider myself a good cook yet thought this recipe was OK at best. Given the price of scallops and the somewhat bland result I wouldn't make this one again. I must point out that I appear to be in the minority so best of luck if you choose to proceed :)

I love this website. With recipes like this, anyone can look like a great cook. I served this for an informal get together as the main course (doubled the recipe, served 5) with a great loaf of bread. It was a big hit. Even my two-year-old liked it. The only change I'll make next time is to cut down on the dressing that first goes on the spinach leaves. To each his own, but my husband and I agreed that probably a 1/4 cup would have been enough for our tastes. We followed others suggestions to cut the butter in half and it was perfectly rich for us. I liked the mild flavor of the big scallops. Think I'll try the goat cheese addition next time.

What a great recipe to 'play' with! I find the large sea scallops aren't as flavorful as e.g. tiny bay scallops, so I substituted large shrimp, that I sauteed rather than broiled. The dressing combo of oj & balsamic vinegar is great, and it's so easy to peel and dice up a fresh orange which really makes a wonderful difference - skip the canned mandarins. I also added feta cheese as recommended below and it kicked it up a tasty notch! The basting reduction is a must to finish the seafood with - will definitely make again and again.

Excellent salad. I wrapped the scallops in bacon and broiled them, basting with dressing reduction the last few minutes.

excellent. i made a few minor changes. i added crumbled goat cheese which really blended in nicely with the warm dressing. also used walnuts which i candied quickly by rolling them in just-melted sugar in lieu of the sliced almonds called for. finally perhaps as a result of the modifications i made, i did find the scallops were somewhat lost amongst all the other ingredients. the flesh was very soft and the flavor very mild, maybe too much so juxtaposed everything else. next time i may consider using a heartier flesh or an alternative cooking technique (maybe grilling the scallops will impart more meaty, more smokey elements to the scallops) so it can stand up to al the other tasty components of this salad.

Great salad. Used mandarine oranges instead of regular and lightly fried almonds (no oil or butter) instead of roasting. Sprinkle with Blue Cheese for an added taste.

I liked this salad very much.In fact it works well as a light meal served with toasted french bread and a good x virgin olive oil for dippin'. I used half the butter and canned mandarin oranges as suggested. I think next time I might add a little crumbled bacon.

A very nice salad. You could probably get away with a little less butter. Next time I make it, I think I'll add some small slices of brie.

Awesome!!!! Best warm spinach salad I ever made...served this prior to Mahogany duck and it was superb. Used pre-washed baby spinach which comes in the bag to reduce labor...used only 8 large sea scallops sliced into thirds and assembled the salad once everyone sat down...it dissapeared immedialty...HIghly recommend!!!!

INCREDIBLE - the BEST salad ever! I made this for Christmas Eve and it was wonderfully delicious and I would put it on my list of the best salads I have ever had. I used baby spinach, the sea scallops I just threw in the pan and sauted in butter (didn't do the extra stuff) and was generous with the pepper and paprika on them. Also, instead of doing all the work with the oranges, I just used canned Mandarin orange segments and Tropicana orange juice to make the dressing. It came out beautifully. Once the spinach was washed and ready to go this salad took maybe 15 minutes.
