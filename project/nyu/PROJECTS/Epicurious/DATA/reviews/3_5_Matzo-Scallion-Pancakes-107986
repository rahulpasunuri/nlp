I needed only a 1/5 of what this recipe makes(enough for two people), and had no problem with changing the measurements. I made one big pancake and compared it to a flour based Korean pancake and couldn't decide which was better. Nice, easy recipe, and quite tasty. Definitely add more scallions!

In general (there is some debate about this), canola oil is not Kosher for Passover, so if you are making them for Passover and want to keep the food Kosher for Passover, you may not want to use canola oil.

This was a Sedar hit!! I took the others advice and added 3x the scallions and a shredded onion. I reheated them just before dinner and they were good but much better 'fresh'. I will make them again!

After reading all of the reviews, I tried these for Passover seder last evening. They were a hit. I agree they need more scallions. I used twice the amount,and then after they were sauteed, I put them in the cuisinart with some fresh chives- and then added to the mixture. I used canola oil instead of olive oil, and they were very good. Since someone suggested perhaps a sauce to serve them with, I combined fresh chives with sour cream and served on the side. I will be making this dish again next year!Additionally, I found that these only made about 19 pancakes, I didn't make them as small. If you make them bigger, I would suggest doubling the recipe. enjoy!

Very nice. I agree it needs twice or even three times as many scallions.

Very easy to make but I would agree with the other reviewers and would recommend doubling the amount of scallions. It just didn't compare with real scallion pancakes, but my guests gobbled them up quickly.

I substituted 10 egg whites for the 5 whole eggs - grapeseed oil in place of the olive oil and nearly doubled the amount of scallion. Like the reviewers before me, I can't imagine making this with olive oil. The smell alone would drive me nuts. It was a big hit and requested for the coming year.

Tried something new this year....and will continue to make these! Everyone loved them! Would love to have some sort of "dipping sauce". Another great way to dip on Passover!

A Seder tradition in our home. We make them every year and the guests just gobble them up.

Have been making these for many years. I usually add more scallions just our preference along with a few teaspoons of grated onions. I fry them in vegetable or canola oil and they reheat beautifully. They make about 15 pancakes. Always add salt and fresh ground black pepper. Delicious!

Definitely worth making again. I doubled the amount of scallions and used canola oil (can't imagine frying them in olive oil) and was very pleased with the result: a nice savory pancake to be used as a side dish for meat dishes.

Made this for seder this year, and it was such a big hit that my husband requested them again this weekend. I used more scallions than the recipe calls for, and I played with the sizing a little - smaller and larger than 3 inches works just fine.

Delicious! I am not much for fried foods either, not just because they are unhealthy but also because I hate getting splattered with hot oil, but this was an excellent twist on my grandmother's plain matzo pancakes and my fiance loved them. Yummy!

Two forks is being charitable at best. This was edible, but pretty boring. Maybe it was something about the texture. I'd rather have plain latkes any day.

I tried the other cooks' recommendations, and made this with twice the amount of scallions, salt and pepper and it was excellent.

Delicious! The recipe made 20 substantial pancakes. Although I am not a fan of fried foods, these cakes were light and not oily. They reheated well in the oven and were a tremendous hit.

Too oily to get 4 forks. Needs more of the onions. I wounder if the oil temp. was too low. Re heating works good.

Now this was fun! These are "chremslach" with scallions mixed in. I think I would add more scallions next time to ramp up the onion-y flavor. I agree with the other reviewer -- this recipe did not make 30 more like 15! Also, I didn't try to make in advance and reheat. I would be interested in other reviewers experience with this.

I just made these today for my seder tonight, and they are delicious! (I had to eat a few, just to "test") Next time, I would add more scallions, maybe some chives, and double the salt. I fried them in canola oil, not olive oil. Also, this recipe did not make 30 pancakes -- more like 20!

Although the recipe was easy to prepare, the predominant taste was matzo meal. I feel that the recipe has to have more 'punch' to really make it tasty.
