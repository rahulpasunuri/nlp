Tried this with 1 tsp rather than 1 TBS of salt and was surprised to find that it really did need more salt. Will try 2 tsp next time. Also, I think it could benefit from a touch more sweetness, may try adding sweet red peppers or pea pods (or both!) next time. I used Trader Joe's light coconut milk, so maybe using full fat would help with some of that, too. Still, a keeper. Makes the kitchen smell wonderful!

I've been making this dish since 1997 when it appeared in the April issue of Gourmet. I love it for several reasons, not the least of which is that it's a fairly quick dish to assemble and every time I have served it to guests I've been asked to hand over the recipe. It may not be a true Sambal as others have argued, but this is a recipe worth trying and saving! I like to serve Shrimp Sambal over jasmine rice and serve with a cucumber raita.

This is a great dish whether or not it is a true sambal. When I make this I leave the salt out entirely and it is still delicious. Without the salt this becomes a low sodium dish. I have small children and even they love it. It is also a great make ahead dish that reheats well.

I followed the recipe exactly and love this! Not for people who don't like spice, but it is delicious. I was worried it would taste too much like curry but my mom, who doesn't always like curry, loved this. Also, to whomever said this is not true sambal, there are some modifications but this is very close to Sambal Balado without the tomato.

After salivating over this recipe for months, I finally made it with fish because I can't have shrimp. I was hoping for a piquant sort of sauce like those I've encountered while on vacation in the Caribbean. Instead of a vibrant melange of flavors, however, this recipe yields a mild-mannered muddle of curry that's too heavy on the onion. Not bad served over rice for a quick weeknight dinner, but nothing to get excited about either.

This was fantastic. I made it according to recipe except that instead of coconut milk (i have to eschew that because of the fat), i used 1c low-fat milk plus 1t coconut flavoring. All six of us agree that it is a definite make again...and again...and again....

Delicious, delicious, delicious!!!! I even skipped the ginger as an ingredient because I did'nt have it. I was fabulous served with jasmine rice and freshly cut cucumbers, tomatoes, and yellow bell peppers. Yum!

Yum. Thanks to previous reviewers for the warning about the salt. I used only one teaspoon and it was delicious. I used peanuts instead of the other nuts (probably about 9 small ones). Served it with roasted baby bok choy and a bottle of vouvray. Raves.

As soon as my blood pressure comes back to earth, I will make this recipe with 1 tsp of salt instead of 1 Tbsp. Holy sodium, Batman! I had to put extra coconut milk and lime juice in to cut the salt. A sliced up potato will soak up some, too. Anyway, it's really good whether it's real or not.

This is also fantastic when poured over chicken breasts and baked. I cut the salt almost in half. The best variation on this recipe is with cubes of pork loin, sauteed in the sambal sauce for c. 40 min. Pork takes on the flavor better than ckn or shrimp.

This is not a real sambal recipe, it is more like mild curry sauce. I suggest to remove ginger, candlenut, cumin and turmeric. Add in more onion and tomato paste. Try to use tamarind juice instate of limejuice. Sambal should be in red color, not golden color. Coconut ? Should I called cream of sambal.

I followed the recipe, and although the dish is quite nice by itself, it tasted more like curry than sambal. Have I done anything wrong?

I'm poor, so I didn't use shrimp. I used chicken instead. I also substituted coconut extract into low-fat milk for the coconut milk. The result was still spectacular! I added a bit of corn starch at the end to thicken it, but the flavors of the lime, ginger, garlic, turmeric, and coconut were magnificent. Turns a beautiful shade of yellow-gold at the end.

We throughly enjoyed this dish, but it was much too salty! I recommend 1tsp of salt instead of 1tbsp. Also, I did not have the nuts called for in the recipe handy, so substituted unsalted peanuts, which tasted great. I served it over brown basmati rice. I definitely recommend this recipe, albeit easier on the salt!
