My family enjoyed this fixed just as the recipe reads. It's a great switch for those that don't like mayo. I'm going to try adding cilantro next time too!

this goes well with fish , I substituted 1/2 cup greek yogurt and a tsp of honey for the buttermilk and added 1/2 tsp of ground cumin, salt and pepper...to kick it up a bit. .cilantro would be nice too. So many variations possible!

Sorry, I thought this salad was bland and soupy. I added extra mayonnaise (I know, it defeats the purpose of lightening it) and added a number of different seasoning salts to try and give it some flavor. The potato to corn ratio seemed off, too. It should have more corn or less potatoes. I'll keep searching for a unique potato salad recipe.

Graet alternative to standard potato saled!

3 and a half forks. I added a splash of extra vinegar, but I like mine tangy. Other than that, followed the recipe and it was marvelous. Everyone raved about it.

A simple yet interesting salad. I made it for the first time today to bring to a gathering and received many compliments. It was refreshing to have a lighter take on potato salad. I followed the proportions of the recipe and was quite pleased. I also added a fair amount of chopped cilantro...yummy!

I am an old fashion lots of egg, mayo and celery potato salad person. This sounds a little bland but the buttermilk and vinegar give it just enough zip to make it a great salad. Besides it tasting great it is also snap to make, I'll never go back to my old salad. I added some purple potato and chives for color as well as a little extra mayo. I tried using Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn but by the time it was defrosted and I squeezed the excess water out it wasn't worth it..if fresh is avaliable use that. I took it to a party and everyone raved about it.

Made this to accompany our 4th of July cookout. Used tri-color fingerling potatoes and fresh corn from the famers market, which added a nice sweetness. The dish needed a hefty dose of kosher salt and a big handful of fresh parsley for more color, otherwise great recipe as written. Will likely make again.

I just finished making this for our cookout today and it is great! I made a few modifications, but stayed pretty true to the recipe. I used tiny red potatoes, and more corn and scallions than called for and that worked out well. I also added about two tablespoons of creme fraiche to the dressing to make it a litle creamier and richer. Added a nice handful of chopped flat leaf parsley and sea salt and pepper. Really a unique salad very tasty, yet still light.

Simple and perfect with fresh summer corn and itty bitty red potatoes. I mixed in chopped fresh parsley and garnished with thin sliced crispy radishes. YUM!

This was a creamy, yummy potato salad. Found some really fresh sweet corn and beautiful baby red potatoes. This needed a bit of kosher salt to bring out the taste. My husband and I love this salad. Thank you!

so good. I did need to cook the potatoes about 10 min and used frozen corn sauted for about 10

I intended to use up some buttermilk with this recipe which I did. I thought it boring. Firstly, I always cook my potatoes with the skins on and then peel and slice when making potato salad. I thought this was a given. I added some chopped red pepper which at least gave it some color. Boring but yes easy.

This dish is delicious! Very creamy without lots of mayonnaise. I cooked the corn a little bit longer, for about 8 minutes, as suggested by another reviewer. I will definitely make this again, especially during barbecue season. I have now found another use for leftover buttermilk.

I have made this recipe more than 10 times over the past couple of years and it always receives rave reviews!! All of the flavors blend well, and it's relatively low fat too.

Yum, yum. Quick, easy and fresh. I'll make this again. RH

Excellent & Quick! Doesn't sound like it would be that tasty, but it is. And with using low-fat buttermilk, this potato salad comes in a lot less fattening than the traditional mayonnaise-laden potato salads. I did add one more tablespoon of mayonnaise though.

This was wonderful! I agreed with a previous poster and "toasted" the corn longer than 3 minutes. I've made it twice this week already! Company and spouse loved it!

I loved the speed of preparation. After making the same old potato salad receipe for many years this was a very welcome addition to my repetoire. My dinner guests loved it and requested the recipe - this is a keeper

Quite good... especially considering how quick and easy it is. Great accompaniment for barbecues. I added about 2 more tbsp. of mayo for richness. Next time, I would also "toast" the corn a couple of minutes longer. It's kind of like comfort food in a salad.

My husband loves this. A bit bland for me, but I am a spicy food lover.

I prepared this salad the day I first saw it in Gourmet. I had lost the recipe and finally found it under the keywords "Buttermilk Dressing". I think that you should add this wonderful potato salad to the "Potato Salad" category. Thank goodness for Epicurious!
