We doubled the sauce and made a pound of thin spaghetti noodles. No need to cool the noodles, just drain well and toss in sauce. On the plate we adorned with halved cherry tomatoes, slivered carrots and red peppers, and some shredded cabbage. We subbed red onions. Coriander is cilantro, right? That was a good and important fresh taste. I also quickly sautéed some sliced chicken breast in garlic and ginger til brown, then threw in a little soy sauce til just cooked through. Great combo! "Refreshing"

This is the second time I'm making it this week -- and it's only Thursday! My husband loved them enough to ask for them right away. Light, great summer meal. I used chili oil in place of the red pepper the first time but am going the crushed pepper route tonight. Also added sliced red pepper for color.

Just Delicious. I added some red bell pepper and sunflower seeds. Perfect dish on a hot summer day!

Love this dish. I use chili oil instead of pepper flakes and it is not at all bland

This is a really wonderful salad. I've never written a review here before, but I was inspired to by this recipe. I only had light sesame oil, and used cider vinegar instead of white-wine or rice. I omitted the sugar and the salt, and used soba noodles. Fantastic! Really flavorful - I don't understand the reviews that say it is bland. All I can think is that they might have been expecting the peanut butter noodles. This is much lighter and in my opinion more refreshing.

Fantastic! I added sliced red bell pepper, shredded carrots, and cooked chicken and shrimp. Also used Sriracha for some extra heat. Love this recipe!

This was easy to make and a big hit. I added some julienned red pepper and crushed peanuts.

I made this to go with the sesame crusted chicken recipe. Upped the red pepper flakes and took a reviewer's suggestion to let all the flavors infuse in the refrigerator. It's a lighter alternative to the more traditional cold noodele recipes with tahini or peanut butter so if you are expecting that, you may be disappointed. I made it with Udon noodles. I would make it again but I think I might try some other recipes first to see if I can find one that is more like the cold sesame noodles I used to get when I lived in NYC!!

I am so glad to have found a cold sesame noodle recipe to love. The recipes with peanut butter or tahini just seem to overpower the dish. This was perfect! I added some grated carrot and used soba noodles. I served it with a lime marinated flank steak. Wonderful summer meal! I will definitely be making this on a regular basis. So easy and delicious.

Excellent and light, boyfriend said, "that was exceptional," so I win. You can play a little fast and loose with the pepper flakes - I also think perhaps making the sauce in advance and allowing the pepper flakes to infuse into it for a few hours may give a more well-rounded flavor. This is one of my favorite dishes to order, but now I like mine better. Yay!

I really like the refreshing quality of this dish. It is very crisp, without a cloying mouthfeel that sometimes happens with cold sesame noodles with peanut butter or similar creamy ingredients.

Nice, SIMPLE, summer lunch. Used soba noodles instead of capellini and added sriracha chili sauce for extra flavor (& heat).

Completely bland. What a disappointing recipe.

I didn't really like this. I thought it was bland. Maybe if you added tahini paste like one cook suggested it would be better. Next time, I will try a differnet sesame noodle recipe in the hopes that it will be better.

Perfect for summer eating. I'll use more chili next time or let it infuse into the sesame oil as one reviewer suggested. Also an easy thing to add protein, like maybe grilled beef.

Very easy & delicious -- simple to make variations with whatever veggies you have around. Best made, in my opinion, with rice stick noodles. A great dish to double and keep in the fridge to eat throughout the week. If you have the time, let the chili pepper flakes infuse into the sesame oil for awhile before using.

The first time I made the dish, I made it as is and thought that it was delicious. The second time, I added a teaspoon of tahini to the dressing before I added it to the noodles and it gave the dish a wonderful nutty flavor. It would probably work with peanut butter too.

I mixed this with Cashew Sesame noodle - add some quickly blanced snow peas, blanched slivered red peppers, put some nut in dressing, chili sauce instead of crushed pepper - Great reviews. We all loved it - felt it could sprinboard, i.e., celery instead or sliced water chestnuts to diversify. All the vegies stays crunchy.

Excellent. I doubled the recipe and added chopped red and yellow peppers and some extra toasted sesame seeds.

I thought this recipe's flavors were really well- balanced and the results were better than some of the other Asian noodle dishes I've tried in the past. A few changes I made- I doubled the recipe but kept the sesame oil at 2 TBPS nd thought that was definitely adequate. I used linguine, added 2 glove of minced garlic to the sauce and doubled the hot pepper flakes. I served this with salmon teriaki and thought it they complemented eachother well.

I made this for myself and had leftovers for several days. enjoyed it just as much. I added more red pepper to spice it up. Next time I will add other veggies!

Add hot pepper flakes to your taste, (the more the merrier) I never have a single noodle left.

This wasn't a bad dish - just a little bland.
