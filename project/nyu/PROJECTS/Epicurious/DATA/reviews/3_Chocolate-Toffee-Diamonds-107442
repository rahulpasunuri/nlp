This was really nothing special. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. For those whose chocolate won't melt completely on the hot crust, a quick method (that produces fewer dirty dishes) is: after you spread the chocolate on the hot crust, return the whole pan in the hot oven for less than a minute. Then spreading with a spatula will be a breeze.

I like the idea of these cookies, I just didn't especially love the way they tasted. Maybe I would have liked them better with less sugar in the shortbread and milk chocolate on top, but overall I just am not impressed enough to try again.

I didn't need to use the double boiler or special spatula. I just used a regular sauce pan and spatula. It was fab!

I'm surprised by the negative reviews. I loved these cookies, and they went quickly at our church open house. I cut them a little too big, but they still looked nice and tasted great. I thought they kept well, too. I've melted chocolate both ways--in double boiler, and on top of the base afterward, and I think the first way is much less aggravating.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The cookies taste okay, but nothing special, and the appearance is really nothing to write home about. Maybe I just don't know how to cut them properly, but I must say, I am embarrassed to send these to my family and friends. I'm going to send 'em anyhow, because I can't see eating them all up myself, but I would certainly not repeat this again.

This was easy to make and tasty (the toffee taste really comes out after baking)! It was also very pretty when cut in the diamond shape. Made a nice addition to my cookie gift tin! Followed the directions exactly.

Toffee is made from cream and brown sugar, which this recipe contains. That's where the toffee flavor comes from - the brown sugar that is cooked as the cookie bakes. It's not precisely the same as toffee candy, but produces a similar flavor.

Easy enough to make. doesnt present well. And doesnt last more than a day or so, without the flavor and consistency changing.

I thought these were yummy. Very fancy looking. The edges came out with a texture like shortbread but the middle ones were softer. I would definately make it again but may try baking the whole thing longer.

Very easy to make...I was wondering where the toffe was in this recipe myself, so I topped the cookie with walnuts and chopped up pieces of toffee bars.

I used milk chocolate chips and the little suckers WOULD NOT melt from the heat of the cookie base... finally had to scrape them back off and melt them in the microwave with margarine! Worth the hassle tho! Used the salted peanuts suggested by another reviewer... definitely YUM!

This recipe was a major disappointment. Where's the toffee? I made these squares to bring to a Christmas party, but felt that they weren't good enough to serve to my friends. Hello Dollies would have been a better choice.

Very good. Make sure you cut them a room temp. Better next day!!!!!!!!!! A keeper.

These have always been my mother's favorite cookies -- they're tender and yummy. Skip the double boiler and just sprinkle the chocolate on the hot cookies, then spread when melted. We always used peanuts, not walnuts, for a salty-sweet thing.

You can't go wrong with chocolate, butter, sugar, and nuts, but where's the toffee in this recipe? This is simply a giant toll house cookie turned inside out, but what happens with those same ingredients transforms it into a lovely new kind of cookie. I just made these and, while waiting for the pan to cool before passing final judgment, was wondering how this rated an appearance on Epicurious instead of a bag of Nestle's morsels. Now I know. Very nice!

I also used chocolate chips rather than chopping bittersweet chocolate. Absolutely delicious! Remarkably quick and easy to make.

Very easy to prepare, and very delicious! These are my new favorite Christmas cookie, and I will be making them again and again! The only change I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts (I hate walnuts.) and to avoid chopping chocolate, I used Ghiradelli double chocolate chips. Yum!
