Delightful nutty taste. Easy to make. Would work for brunch/breakfast.

These were okay - not offensive tasting, but not super good. I made them for a pot-luck dinner and they did not travel well. I would wait to put the dusting of sugar onto them until the last moment, as it absorbs into these moist mini-muffins. They seemed almost like they were made with whole-wheat flour - so healthy tasting rather than decadent. Hardly anyone touched them. They might be good as part of a brunch spread, but overall a waste of good blackberries.

I made these for a dinner party and they were delicious. I didn't have almonds so I used pecans.

Made this last night for a dinner party - served warm with whipped cream - and I think they'd go great with ice cream too! I made the dough ahead of time and refrigerated and the only thing I found was that they needed to bake slightly longer - maybe 17-18 minutes. Maybe because the dough was still cold. Either way, they were a hit!

These were excellent and very simple. The browned butter really makes it. I didn't have quite enough sliced raw almonds so replaced about 1/3 cup with roasted, salted and it still worked beautifully.

I made this with blueberries instead of blackberries and they were delicious!

I didn't whip the egg whites. Yummy and very sweet.

Are you supposed too whip the 5 egg whites?
