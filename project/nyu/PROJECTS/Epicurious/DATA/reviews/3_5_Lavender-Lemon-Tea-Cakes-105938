I made this for holiday gifts for work, it smells very nice. I used fresh lavender instead of lavender flowers, and it turned out great. Very nice and different tea cake.

I found the lavender flavor to be a bit strong. I reduced the amount to 1 Tbsp. in the bread. I then mixed the other Tbsp with some sugar and sprinkled it on top to display this unique ingredient more prominently, while keeping the taste balanced with the lemon.

I'm only giving this 3 forks because it took so long. But it was really tasty and a huge hit. I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and subbed lemon-flavor soy yogurt for the buttermilk because I'm lactose intolerant. This makes it a bit healthier and you couldn't tell the difference. Will make this again for special occasions.

I agree that by itself this tea cake is a bit dry and heavy. The secret to making this delicious is to serve it with lemon curd! With a bit of lemon curd spread on a slice of this tea cake, it is delicious!

The loaves are good, but become absolutely delicious when topped with a tasty lemon curd. They themselves are not very sweet which, in my opinion, makes them a perfect match for the curd.

I have no idea what I did wrong, but the loaves were VERY dense and heavy! If we decide to add onto the patio I'll have a use for the loaves, otherwise they need to be thrown away.

Pay attention to the butter/butter milk in recipie, add 1/2 cup butter which is not in ingredient list. Bread was awesome and has been requested several times since the first time I made it two weeks ago. Great with soups! NOT a desert bread that's why it's not overly sweet!! Fantastic!

The cake smelled heavenly when it was baking in the oven. However, it wasn't sweet enough and I had to make a glaze for it. It looked very pretty with the glaze on top. I also sprinkled some lavender flowers onto the glaze before the glaze hardened. Everyone raved about the cake. Will definitely make it again.

These cakes did smell and look beautiful but my family just could not get over the feeling like we were eating a bath product. I would not make it again and if you use lavender candles or soaps you may have this "conflict" also.

This is a really lovely cake. I brought it to work. Alhough my office mates were hesitant to try it because it gave off such a lovely fragrance, they really liked it after tasting it. I used 3/4 cup of unsalted butter and very large lemons. To serve it, I sprinkled powdered sugar on top to make it sweeter; it would be great with sweetened whipped cream on the side. Making it again would be a pleasure.

Missing a main ingredient BUTTER. I used 3/4 cup with good results and powdered buttermilk. The aroma throughout the house is heavenly. Friends are at first reluctant to EAT lavender, but after they taste it they are pleasantly surprised. I am adding this (with the addition of butter) to my other lavender recipes.

The ingredient list doesn't list butter but the recipe calls for it. I used a half cup with good results. The smell while baking is wonderful!
