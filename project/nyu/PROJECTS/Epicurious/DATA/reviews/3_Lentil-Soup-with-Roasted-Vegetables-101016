I roasted and added additional tomatoes, carrots, celery and zucchini and substituted half the water for beef broth. The soup is so flavorful, hearty and delicious! It's a keeper!

This is one of my favorite Fall Recipes. I add chili powder (roasted & mixed by my husband) and ginger powder to the cumin, and I let all those flavors roast in the oven with the veggies (don't forget S&P). I've added MANY more than 4 cloves of garlic and I've mixed up the veggies a lot - just depends on what I've got in the fridge or what looks good at the market.

This was really great, I added a good pinch of salt and pepper to the veggies before roasting and let them get nice and golden brown so the final soup has a more concentrated flavour.

I combined this recipe with the curried lentil soup recipe based on previous comments about taste. The addition of the curry and other spices plus vegetable broth called for in the other recipe makes this delicious. I also added roasted sweet potato and pureed it when I did the eggplant.

I love this recipe and make it often in the winter. Don't do the vegetable garnish or the yogurt.

I love roasted vegetables and thought they were an incredible base for this soup. I roast veges all the time with dinner, so this did not seem like a time-consuming process to me. Thought this was a pretty quick recipe...especially for soup and mine came out very hearty...not thin or soupy at all. Did season it with salt and pepper. Thought it tasted "meaty" with the lentils soaking up the roasted flavors and it is a very healthy, lo- cal, and filling soup. Loved it! And made it per the recipe...except used low-fat rather than non-fat yogurt and only 1/2 T swirled on the top was enough for me.

This recipe is rather bland. I love cumin so that helped... but I'm sure there is a better recipe out there!

Absolutely horrible! And I LOVE lentil soup. It may have been the eggplant. Whatever it was, it tasted lousy. My guests were good friends and I had a couple of cans of Progresso so I saved face.

Flavorless. The roasted vegetables added nothing. It was more interesting to make than the average soup, though...

This was my first go at making lentil soup, and I really liked the results. With all the cumin, it reminded me of chili. Next time I will add more roasted peppers and tomatoes since they were my favorite part. Also, this needed lots of salt and pepper.

Mysteriously bland. It could be my fault. I thought the roasted vegetables would be delicious, but all I had to show for them was a burned hand.

I wasn't very impressed with this soup. It was bland and watery.

Great receipe! I used green lentils instead of brown ... just happened to have them on hand. Will be making this one again!

VEry good. I grilled the vegetables (too hot to turn the oven on) and included some yellow summer squash, because it was available. I also added a can of cannelini beans and a handful of swiss chard. NIce complexity and richness.

I love this soup. The roasted vegetables, although time consuming make it spectacular! Without them, as my friend (who also loves this soup) says, "lentil soup usually tastes like dirt".

My first go at a lentil soup. Seemed really watery and I didn't add more than what was called for. Definitely should've added more veggies as they were the best part.

As I was near serving this soup I tasted it and hoped it would improve by adding the plain yogurt and roasted vegetables. Oh did it ever! Roasted vegetables are wonderful- I would use even more next time - and the lentil soup was the perfect background for them.

I wasn't impressed. It was a time consuming recipe that wasn't any better than other lentil soups I've had.

Both my husband and I thought this was excellent. It took a shade longer to cook than the recipe called for. Nice flavoring and was wonderful reheated.
