I love sweet potato fries and was looking for a creative side to go with the salmon burgers I was making. I did not use garlic but I added some red pepper flakes to give tham a little kick. I agree with the other reviewers about the temperature, 400 is sufficient. This was a healthy yet fun recipe that I will be making again... the kiddies loved it!

So delicious! Cooked it on 400 for 30 minutes. Was an awesome recipe.

Thanks to all who noted the shorter roasting time in the convection mode. At 400 degrees these cooked to delicious finish in 18 minutes and we enjoyed them immensely. Next time i'll try the spices from another recipe...chili, cumin, paprika for a change but the size (other recipe suggests matchstick...too much work) and baking time makes this the answer to delicious and healthy way to sweet potatoes in hot weather.

500 degrees for 22 minutes burnt 20 percent of fries to a crisp. We're not talking caramelized yumminess,we're talking fire alarm shrieking carbon tasting burnt. If I had cooked them for the suggested 30 minutes, they'd all be like this. I love sweet potato fries, even crispy ones, but I wouldn't make them like this again.

500 degrees? For 30 minutes??? That's crazy! My husband tried doing this tonight; I came home to a house filled with smoke and a bowl of blackened sweet potato "fries" for dinner. Next time I'll ask him to do it my way--@ 400 (with convection) for about 15 minutes.

East to make and very versatile. Here is another sweet potato recipe that you will love http://imunchie.com/yummy/munchies/sensational-sweet-potato-fries

Rating: 3
Tasted good and very easy to make, although I had a few issues with the texture. I think setting the oven at 500 degrees was the problem...the fries almost burned on one side, even though I turned them after 15 minutes. I would recommend setting the oven a little lower and turning the fries often so they don't stay on one side. They were soft on the inside but still tasted really good!

also...i baked for about 35 mins at 400 convection roast.

would have liked them crispier, but they were good and easy. Used my baking stone cookie sheet and convection at 400 as recommended by previous reviewers. Also used veggie oil as I have read about olive oil turning into trans fat over 350. Sprinkled with no salt herbal salt substitute and dipped in homemade chipotle mayo. Hubby gave it a 10. Next time will try the herbal mixture.

Great recipe! I have no problem with my oven at 500 degrees; but every oven is different, so you might want to watch it closely if this is the first time you've fired it up that high. They seemed to crisp up after a few minutes out of the oven. I skipped the garlic and parsley because I made a garlic aioli for dipping:)

Rating: 3
We made this recipe to the T. We love this dish. Having said that - the high heat of the oven set the broiler off and one side of the fries burned. While our company was polite and said that it was better that way -- we knew differently. Even so, a little charred on one side, they were still pretty good. So shame on us and our oven -- and we need to watch the oven more closely. Having said all of that that -- we will make this again and no doubt it will be great!!! Everyone should try this recipe.

As others have said, 500 degrees is too high. I tried 425 for 15 minutes, turning every 5 minutes. Then broiled them thinking they would crispen up a bit. I suppose they did, but not enough. That said, these are delicious.

Rating: 0
I guess everyone's oven is different. I took the suggestion of many of the cooks here and started with 425 degrees.... it wasn't hot enough.I increased to 500 and had a much better result. I turned them after 10 minutes of roasting, then followed through with that process every 5 minutes thereafter. They were nicely brown, a little crispy and delicious! Big hit for a healthy dinner.

500 degrees is WAY TOO HIGH!! I'd say cook at 425 for 30 min. I just added thyme and they were tasty, but burnt around the edges...

I should have read the reviews first, I know better, but I was hurrying. I heated the oven to 500 as directed, threw the fries in and when I went to turn them about 20 minutes later (I had a baby to feed) they were CHARRED black. Not just overdone, but little ash piles. Sweet potato fries are fairly basic but never seem to crisp up so I thought I would try this high-temp recipe. I guess I shoulda known better. I have to go turn off the fire alarm now.

Really tasty. These are more like steak fries - soft, not especially crisp. But they were great. I'm still on the search for great crispy shoestring sweet potato fries (suggestions?) but I suppose I'll have to fry them. The baked are healthier and still delicious.

We loved 'em. AND I completely forgot to add the herbs at the end. Just salt, pepper and garlic. Accompanied some andouille and beef burgers for a nice summer meal on the deck. Next time I'll wow 'em with the herbs...

I did this before seeing a recipe, at 400 F. for just over 10 minutes but because I didn't turn them at all they burned completely on the one side. They were definitely cooked through (quite soft) so I have no idea how 500 F. for 30 min could possibly work! I did mix cinnamon, chili powder and ginger in with some oil, tossed to coat. Will still make them again but lower temperature and less time than this recipe states for sure!

Tossed the fries with olive oil & Lawry's Seasoned Salt. Baked in a convection oven at 400 for 30 minutes, turning every 10 mins. They disappeared. I would make these again. Cut the yams to a uniform "medium" wedge size. Very good.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and lowered the temp to 450 and put the spices on first. I also tossed them in a small of olive oil first. It was OK. The fries were not crispy at all. Next time I am just going to put a whole sweet potato in the oven, it will be easier.

I prepared the sweet potatoes the Cooks Illustrated way, which is an oiled pan, 500 degrees, 15min per side. That being said, the garlic and thyme were awesome compliments, and I loved the savory flavor profile for the sweet potato as opposed to the candy sweet recipes you usually find.

I love sweet potato fries. A few things I've learned from making them: Parboil them first for a couple of minutes, toss in a bit of oil and spice of choice (curry is yummy), and cook at 425. They will never get crispy like regular fries. There is too much water content. When done dip them in this yummy sauce: Garlic Curry Aioli: 1/4 cup light mayo or miracle whip 2 small (or 1 large) garlic clove, mashed to a paste with salt, or use garlic powder Juice from 1/2 lemon Dash of black pepper 1 tsp curry power, or more to taste 1 dash cayenne pepper Sea salt to taste Directions: If using fresh garlic, mash garlic into a fine paste with the side of a knife on a cutting board, using salt as an abrasive. Mix all ingredients together, serve with fries.

Rating: 3
These are delicious! Make sure you spread them out on the tray so they roast, not steam. My only (minor) issue was that the raw garlic was a bit strong on some bites. I think I should make it extra extra fine next time.

Rating: 1
Was also disappointed with this recipe. I have a fabulous, new convection oven and 500 was WAY too high. Also, I would use less oil and turn them at least once during cooking. I used salt, pepper, cayenne and cumin and the flavor on the ones that didn't turn black was great! Will try again, cut larger and maybe at 400 for 15 min.

One fork for a badly written recipe. Four forks if you do it this way! 500 degrees for 30 minutes is crazy. Try using the minimum of oil (for crispyness) and set the oven at 400 convection or 425 standard. 15 minutes should be more than enough to produce a crispy ovenfry. Check fries every 5 minutes or less until you find the temperature and time that works for you. Yams are delicious as oven fries so it is worth it!

I absolutely agree that the heat is too high. I set my oven for 400 degrees and turned them every 20 minutes and STILL ended up with quite crisp potato slivers! Perhaps the higher temp cuts down the time, but was not willing to take the risk, given my limited cooking skills. I followed the directions precisely, except for turning them. The potatoes were soft (it was difficult to turn them without smushing some) with crisp corners only, but the flavors were fantastic and I ate a whole cup of them! That said, they were DELICIOUS. Will make this again; may try to grill them as an alternative to see what happens.

Rating: 2
The temperature is absolutely too high. Despite reviews, I wanted to try it to see what the effect was. Not good. Skinnier edges burnt to a crisp within 8 minutes. I did really like the parsley and garlic, so did my boyfriend. We'll try a different method of cooking the potatoes and then add the garlic parsley combo.

Rating: 4
We make these at least once a week, sometimes with parsley and cilantro or with just parsley. Instead of following the cooking method here, I use a different one that allows them to get crispy. Bake, covered with foil, for 15 minutes at 450, then uncover, turn fries with a spatula, and bake 15 minutes more. Turn fries again, bake 15 minutes more, or until crispy on all sides. They're perfectly tender inside and they don't become inedibly blackened.

500 degrees? My oven only goes to 450. Luckily it burns hot so I went ahead and set it at 450. Mmm, black yam fries. Sigh. If I try this again, it will be at 400 degrees. I'm not sure I will though. Yams are discouraging.

I've had a lot of Sweet Potato Fries, and have never known them to be as crispy as a white potato version. But, here's what I did: I heated my baking stone in the oven, set at convetion 450 , for 15 minutes, and after tossing the fries in olive oil, spread them on a dark baking sheet. I sprinkled the spuds with sea salt and lots of white pepper, which gave a subtle sweet taste without sugar. Placed the sheet pan on top of the stone and baked for 25 minutes. Yum!

The sweet potatoes are good this way but they never get crispy, just soft. Also parsley and garlic does not compliment the sweetness as well as I would have thought. Will make them again but substitute other flavors. My boyfriend enjoyed these more than I did but was disappointed that they weren't crispy.

This were delicious. I did use the oven at 500 and just cut the cooking time. I thought it worked fine.

I honestly wasn't excited about this recipe when I saw it, but I was desperate for a sweet potato fries recipe and this seemed like the best option. I am so glad I made these!

These fries are great! I didn't have any problems with burning or with the texture. I tried them with rosemary as suggested in another review and liked them even better. I also tried the egg wash (to make them firm),but I didn't find that it was worth the extra steps and they are just fine as is.

Used Costco premade fries, approximately 1/4" across. After 20 minutes, the fries were crispy, and some were burnt, and they managed to set off our smoke detector after being removed from the oven. In spite of that, though, the unburnt ones were quite tasty. I followed the suggestions to add the herbs and garlic to the olive oil, the unburnt fries were very flavourful.

In a rush, I made these without the seasonings, just olive oil and salt, and they were still addictive. Also, there is no need to be precise in cutting - I made rough cut 1/4" to 1/2" strips and wedges with attractive results. Overall, a delicious, quick dish.

Fantastic! Definitely give these a go. Take the advise from Brooklyn and California with the breadcrumb / herb mixture. The added crispiness from the crumbs completes these no-guilt fries.

If you want them crispy, try this.

I followed Toronto's advice about rinsing the potatoes three times, soaking, and all that. They were NOT crispy, but they were tasty. I'll play around with this a bit to see if I can master the crispy part.

Rating: 2
These were pretty good. Followed a reviewer's suggestion to soak the potatoes in water, which I imagine helped. The fries were still on the softer side, but a fairly good texture. 1 1/2 lb. sweet potatoes makes a tiny amount of fries, so I'd increase the # of potatoes. I'll try the recipe again, perhaps infusing the oil with the herbs and some garlic powder before baking, then sprinkling on extra garlic/herbs at the end. Think that might increase the flavor.

Rating: 3
To get crispier fries, cut them a little less than 1/2", rinse them 3 times in cold water, then soak then in cold water for 30 minutes. Pat dry and continue with rest of recipe. To avoid burning, I cover pan with parchment paper and reduced heat to 400 for 40-45 min, turning once. Sometimes I turn on broiler for last 5 minutes and crisp up the tops. Yum!

Okay...I made my own variation of these because I was trying to replicate a dish I got at a restaurant.

These were outstanding! It's such an unusal way to serve vegetables. I think that if you know ahead of time that the strips are not crunchy, you avoid the disappointment and misconception by the use of "fries" in the title of the recipe.

I'm going to make them again tomorrow night for another dinner party.

Tastes good, but the recipe needs fixing. I tried baking at 500F for a while, then finishing it up at Broil. The ones in the middle were soft and broke apart, while the ones at the edges of the pan were black. *If* I were to try this recipe again, I would try to get the baking/broiling times right. Also, sprinkling on the herbs at the end didn't work well; they didn't stick to the potatoes for some reason.

I make this dish quite often with a couple of modifications. First of all - 1 clove of garlic is for wimps! I also find that rosemary is the best herb to compliment sweet potatoes. I also use garlic pepper. I mix them all up in a bowl with the olive oil, herbs and garlic and then bake them. Before I serve them, I put them back in the original bowl and swish them around to get the last bits of garlic and herbs. Yum!

This was a great success at our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner yesterday. In addition to great flavor, it was easy to prepare. I partially pre-cooked the potatoes in the microwave to shorten oven-time.
