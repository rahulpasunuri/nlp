Really good, and i cheated on the dough using trader joes. i added tomatoes and cooked them and them the prosciutto on the pizza for a few mins after the cheese melted. also added some crushed red peppers for a little kick. so good!

Very good - I made this in a pinch with Pillsbury pizza dough. Next time I would use better dough or make my own. Also, roughly chop the proscuitto so it doesn't all come off the pizza with the first bite. Overall, a good light dinner.

Great pizza! If brushing the crust with olive oil before baking, use max 2 tbsp or it gets too oily. I agree to toss the arugula in olive oil before tossing it on - instead of pouring olive oil on top with the prosciutto aleady there. Especially if you have good prosciutto, this is delicious.

I also have been making this pizza for sometime. My recipe is from Wolfgang Puck. With my recipe you brush crust with olive oil then top with Fontina and Mozzarella chesse bake until browned. After you remove from oven top with Prosciuto and Arugula tossed lightly with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Then grate fresh Parmesan cheese on top. It is really great!!

I have made this pizza numerous times at various gatherings and it has always received rave reviews. Everyone always wants the recipe. The only thing different I do I is toss the arugua with a few drops of olive oil before adding it on the pizza.
