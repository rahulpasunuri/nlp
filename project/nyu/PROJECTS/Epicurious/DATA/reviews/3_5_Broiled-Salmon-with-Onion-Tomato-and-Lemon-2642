I thought this was a little more work than necessary? The flavors didn't really penetrate the fish and I think I'd prefer a higher veggie / fish ratio. It turned out fine, but there are probably better cooking methods while using the same ingredients. And I agree with all the other reviews - needs a much longer cooking time. Almost 2x.

This is a very simple recipe. Make sure to really close off the tin foil before putting in the broiler - otherwise the oil/butter smokes very quickly due to the proximity (5") to the heat source. My salmon was still frozen and it was cooked after 30 mins.

Really good and simple to prepare. Like others said, it takes a lot more time to broil than called for in the recipe. We had a thick fillet and it took about 30 minutes to broil to perfection. I liked that you can prepare this easily then put it to the side while making other side dishes, then throw it in the broiler when you're ready.

This is really good...BUT YOU DO HAVE TO BROIL FOR AT LEAST 20 MIN. I then opened the foil and broiled for a couplt of min. longer. Do make the lemon sauce.

My husband who claims not to like salmon say this recipe is a winner. I always use wild salmon - I think the taste is much better than farm.

Yum! I didn't have any onions on hand so I used scallions. Turned out great.

Fast, easy, and tasty! Just throw a slab of salmon in a baking dish, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, top with tomato, onion, and lemon slices, salt/pepper and lemon juice... broil until done. It did take longer than the time specified in the recipe, but cuts of meat vary so much that I always watch them closely.

This recipe was easy and great. I used canned diced tomatoes that were "Italian style" and had basil, garlic and oregano already added. Next time I would use more of them and their juice. I served this with cous cous and added the juices from the cooked salmon and a little more melted margarine to it. I would definitely make this again!

well, my bad for printing recipe and not checking reviews. turned out great, but needed at least 25 min, to cook, and still was undercooked in center, which was fine to reheat leftovers the next day.

Fabulously easy and good ingredients, but horribly disappointing in cooking time, as other reviewers have noted (but too late for me!) With MUCH more time in the oven, a fine dish, but I'm guessing it would take 25 or more minutes to fully cook.

Like many of the other reviewers, i found that this did not cook in the time it said, I baked/broiled for 25 minutes and then had to microwave it a bit longer cause we couldn't wait any longer. The parsley garlic lemon flavor was delicious, might make that again as a sauce but the whole combination was gross and I ended up just eating rice with the sauce mixed in. Very very disappointing. Ours tasted a bit fishy too but i believe that was the fault of the fish, not the fault of the recipe.

Needs 20 minutes under the broiler, otherwise it's perfect!

This recipe is so easy and yummy. It took about 20 minutes to cook rather than the 10 minutes listed. I make rice on the side and drizzle it with the juices trapped in the foil wrap. I've made this recipe over and over and have never been disappointed! This one is an absolute keeper!

SOAK FISH IN MILK FOR AT LEAST 1 HOUR, OVERNIGHT IS GREAT. LESS "FISHY" TASTE. I USED 1/2 BUTTER AND 1/2 MARGARINE, LESS FAT. I ALSO SPRINKLED A LITTLE DILL WEED OVER FISH. INSTEAD OF BROILING, BAKED AT 425 DEG. FOR 12 MIN.

Needs more time under the broiler the listed, however a great recipe that I will be making again and again

The salmon took more than the 10 minutes to cook. The taste was extremely "fishy"

This dish was really good. I did cook fish longer (almost 20 minutes) than stated in the recipe. Definatly make this again!

You can't fault this recipe for being so quick and easy, but I guess I was expecting something outrageously memorable. Don't get me wrong?it's good and I will probably make it again when I have salmon on sale. Also, it took me about 20 minutes to cook.

I like the recipe, since its healty, easy and tasty! However, I have tried it twice and both times it took over 20 minutes for the fish to cook. I'm not sure if its the thinkness of the salmon I've been getting or my broiler.

My husband and I have salmon nearly once a week. We just tried this recipe the other day and thought it was great. I am sure we will use this recipe often. Quick, easy and delicious, what more could you ask for!

Wow, this dish was really good. It did take longer for the fish to get done (15-16 minutes) than stated in the recipe, which could be due to the thickness of the salmon filets I used. But this is a remarkably simple dish to prepare and the clean-up afterwards is a snap, making it a good choice for week-night meals. I cut the quantities for the butter mixture in half, which was plenty. Also, I opened up the foil packet for the last 2-3 mintues to let the top broil and get kind of crispy and browned. I think the next time I make this that I would use thinly sliced shallots in place of the onions for a milder taste. This recipe is definitley a keeper.

Very easy and delicious recipe. I made this Christmas Eve on the grill (despite the cold!). Without the luxury of summer tomatoes, I used canned tomatoes. It tasted as great as it looked. I will absolutely make this again. As usual, I spared no expense with the garlic and butter!!!

I saw this recipe in a friends old Bon Appetit and went straight to the website to get the recipe. It was delicious. My 3 year old loved it. I also cut back on the butter which didn't compromise any taste. We have salmon once a week and this was a great new recipe.

Judging from others' comments, either I or my broiler did something very wrong. After 12 minutes the parsley (I simply placed sprigs on top of the fish rather than chopping it) was fresh as a daisy- no sign of wilt, and the salmon looked as if it had just come from the fishmonger. I eventually opened up the foil and it cooked. HUH??

I cut the fat WAY back by using mostly white wine in the sauce instead of all that butter. It was delicious, easy to make, easy to clean up!

This is an unbelievably easy recipe that turns out so great! I had an extremely large side of salmon so I sliced lemon, onion & tomatoe very thin using more than the 4 slices called for but kept the other ingredients at the above portions, cooking longer, approx 20-30 minutes and the fish turned out excellent and super moist! This is going into my recipe file as a keeper.

Very easy, colorful, moist and tasty. Highly recommended.

My husband raved about this dish. And I liked its ease of preparation and clean-up, too. I made it in individual foil packets and served it in a dish with a deep lip so the sauce could be used on the rice I served with it.

Excellent and easy. You can cut back on some butter to reduce fat and not suffer taste. Great way to eat salmon!!!!
