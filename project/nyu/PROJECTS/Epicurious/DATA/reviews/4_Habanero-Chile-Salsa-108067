I put 6 habeneros and 4 long cayennes in this one. I can't get tomatillos so I used seeded roma tomatoes. Excellent!

Excellent. Used eight (8) habanero's instead of one (1). Next time may add one (1) or two (2)roma tomatoes for a slightly differet twist.

I decided to whip this recipe up as an extra for a superbowl potluck, and it was the hit of the party. Like other reviewers, I like a little texture so I added the chopped cilantro after the mixture was processed as well as 1/2 a diced sweet onion; and an apple, peeled, cored, and diced. I also upped the habaneros to 4. Curiously, it seemed hotter after I first made it than it did the next day.

Used 2 whole red savinas (2x hot as habaneros) and the spiciness was perfect. Honestly I prefer more texture in my salsa but I guess it's a matter of preference. I would add onions and cilantro at the end, raw and diced. The roasted veggies added wonderful dimension to the salsa.

SORRY, I live in Mexico and my habaneros are prolific. I am going to make this today based on all of the reviews with more KEY lime juice and the ULTIMATE Fleuer de Sal or Colima Volcano Salt (extreme coarse grain for everone else.....sorry). Everyone looks at my plant and just freaks out. I know that this recipe will be to die for. Have used the same one with my serranos.

Extreme in flavour and heat! I actually read the recipe wrong, I read 11 1/2 inch habaneros where it actually said 1 1 1/2 inch habanero. I will definately make the same "mistake" again! I brought it to a pot luck party and it went down hot and fast. Everyone loved it! So, I highly recommend that you too use 11 habaneros instead of just 1. It sounds crazy but wow it is the best salsa I have ever had.

This has a great flavor! It has become a regular item in my fridge, and my guests always love it, my Mexican family even loves it. I do add a couple of extra garlic cloves when I make it and sometimes some extra cilantro.

I forgot to add the onion and used three habaneros. This is an excellent salsa - even if you do forget to add the onion.

so many people said that they loved this salsa, theres no way i cant make it again. i changed one thing though...i added four habaneros instead of one...if you do this, WARN people before they take a huge bite.

We loved this salsa so much we are going to use it in our gift baskets at Christmas. We have also found that extra roasting time as well as upping the garlic, salt and habanero amount was a real plus.

I took this salsa to a dinner with my Mexican family, which is the true test of a salsa, and everyone loved it! I did alter it slightly though, I doubled the lime juice, added extra salt, and increased the garlic to 6 cloves. I got compliments on the salsa all night long!

I have made this four times in the last couple of weeks. This salsa is wonderful! Only changes I made was to triple the garlic, double the cilantro, and throw in a couple of canned chipotles for the heck of it. This really does the trick!

Habaneros grow like weeds here, so I need good recipes! This is really excellent, esp. the flavor from broiling the vegetables. Tomatilloes are a little spendy, so I substituted half tomatoes, and it tasted great. I may use this stuff as marinade next time I grill.

This was an absolute hit at my White elephant party last week. I'm Mexican, and everyone at my party was Mexican too, so we're very used to super hot salsas, this one was perfect. I didn't change a thing from the recipe. I served it as a condiment to chicken in green sauce tamales and pork posole. This salsa got rave reviews from even the most picky salsa tasters. 1 Habanerom provided just the right amount of heat to give this salsa amazing flavor while not overpowering the other ingredients.
