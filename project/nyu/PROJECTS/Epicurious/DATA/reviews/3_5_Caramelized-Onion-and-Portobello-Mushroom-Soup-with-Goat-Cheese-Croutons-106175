I added the balsamic vinegar (2 tablespoons) to my onions while they were caramelizing and that was a mistake. It took forever to get good caramelized flavor. Would still add the vinegar, but with the broth and wine.

Very good....quite easy to make, great aroma filling the house as this is being made.....great soup. and the caramelized onion and mushrooms are a nice topping to a steak... yummy.

tastes exactly like french onion soup. I didn't have the brandy so i used scotch which was fine. also added the balsamic which was fantastic. can't wait to try to gruyere on the bread.

LOVED this soup, and the croutons! Made it with brandy instead of Cognac because I heard when you cook with it, it isn't much different. It was surprisingly rich too. I plan on making this for guests too, it's a good "show off" dish. Only be prepared for it to take a while to cook, it's not a fast dish, but worth the wait!

Fabulous soup! Absolutely delicious and easy to make. I added about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to the onions and used home-made chicken stock. I didn't do the goats' cheese croutons, but will probably add some home-made croutons and grated gruyere next time, just like traditional onion soup.

delicious but i had to substitute 1/2 c cabernet instead of the white wine and used garlic powder. yumm! tastes just like a vegetarian onion soup without the heavy gratin on top!

A perfect soup! I used beef broth instead of vegetable and added the suggested balsamic vinegar (2T). Wonderfully delicious!

I'm just tasting the soup now and it's great and perfect for a cold Dec. night. I made my own vegetable stock using mushroom, onions and carrots. I cooked the onions for about an hour until they reached the right shade of carmelization. I'm serving for dinner tonight and I think it'll be great! Why hasn't anyone tried this with a swiss cheese crouton?

Made this for dinner tonight and my husband I both thought it was delicious. I used beef broth instead of vegetable. When I cook I always taste as I go along. In other words, the onions took much longer than the 20 minutes it said in the recipe until they tasted caramelized. And DO let it simmer for a good 45 minutes or longer. The broth got so much better from start to finish. Can't wait for tomorrow's leftovers since many said it improved the second day. This is a keeper.

I've made this recipe twice now...once with brandy and once with cream sherry. Rave reviews for both and this recipe is in my top 3 for soups. Dont be shy with the portobello. Bread, wine and good soup...life.

This was very good. I used 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 veg broth for a richer flavour, and it helped. The flavour still wasn't where I wanted it so I added about 1.5 tbsp balsamic vinager and that did that trick!! Definitely what the recipe needed for an extra boost of flavour. Next time I'll use more onion, less mushroom.

Easy to prepare and very tasty. I decided to try this with what I had on hand, chicken stock instead of vegetable, gruyere instead of goat cheese and crimini mushrooms instead of portobello. It was a bit too salty, so I would use low sodium next time and will try with the veggie stock and portobellos.

This is a good recipe, and is a much appreciated vegetarian-friendly version of french onion soup. It is not exactly like the original, but it is close enough to kill my cravings. Reducing the broth and slowly carmelizing the onions really makes a difference in the flavor, but it takes a long time to do. In my experience, it is very necessary to take the time to do this soup properly instead of rushing through it. The "quicker" ways of making this soup yield a bland and watery soup. Also, I liked having gruyere croutons better than goat cheese for this soup.

All my guests loved this soup! The only thing I changed was to use regular and crimini mushrooms instead of portobellos as they are a pain to clean. Everyone has asked me for the recipe!

this one of my favorite soup recipes and never ceases to win raves. The only thing I do different is to serve it like a traditional French Onion soup in a smaller crock covered with melted gruyere cheese over the top. The mix of the 2 cheeses fantastic. I can not imagine deviating from the basic receipe the flavors are so very well matched.

Three out of four people at our dinner table couldn't even finish this soup. I used 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 vegetable broth which I expected to make this soup better than the original recipe. This was definitely not the case. Next time I have a craving for these flavors I will make a traditional french onion soup. Very disappointing.

loved it- great complex flavor, agree that even better the next day! croutons good too.

Lovely soup recipe. I only had chicken broth on hand and it worked just fine. Be careful when adding the thyme as it can overpower the soup. I also tried this recipe with white mushrooms, it was okay but not as good as with the portabellas. Make sure you simmer it for a while and let the flavours develop.

Rating: 3
I used this recipe as a guideline, and enjoyed the end product immensely. In place of the chicken stock, I used a good quality, store-bought (all natural) beef stock. I used Cabernet Sauvignon in place of the white wine, and dark rum in place of the brandy. Since I don't care for portabellas, I used fresh Shiitake and Crimini mushrooms (yes, I know the Crimini are baby Portabellas!). I brushed rustic bread slices with olive oil and garlic, and spread the goat cheese on them after toasting.The combination of all of the flavors was rich and hearty, and the goat cheese was great with the soup. This was a great twist on French Onion soup. I will keep my variation in rotation for future rainy days.

This recipe turned out really well. I did a combination of chicken broth and veggie broth. I also did both goat cheese croutons and emmantal crutons. Both were quite good. The soup also froze well.

Rating: 4
I made it, we ate and, I froze the leftovers, thawing it and reheating almost 2 weeks later. It froze beautifully. I made it again for New Year's eve, this time using the cognac to flambe the mushroom, garlic and onion mixture. I didn't think the flavor could get more intense, but it did, and it was wonderful! It was also incredibly rich, so plan on serving it in small amounts. Any way you play with it goat cheese is a good, tangy bite in a very sweet soup.

I may have to try this one again until I get it right. Reducing veg stock down is a good idea for a better flavor for us dedicated vegetarians out there. I prefer Gruyere croutons instead of goat cheese.

Lovely soup, made last night for Christmas Eve celebration--all bowls came back empty. I used all beef broth, Baby Bellas (thanks Brookfield IL), white pepper along with black, and a touch of Worcestershire as it began to cook down. Wisconsin, you are so right to emphasize patience when caramelizing the onions. Do take the time. Thanks to ALL of you cooks who take the time to pass on your experiences--you are a fine lot! Merry Christmas.

I have made it twice, and only made slight adjustments - I use half veggie/half beef stock for a bit more flavor and I saute the mushrooms in batches to really crisp them, then carmelize the onions so that the carmelization on the bottom of the pan doesn't burn when cooking the mushrooms second. Once done carmelizing, I deglaze with the cognac and follow as indicated. Freezes well so I always make the full amount and freeze single servings for future use.

Rating: 4
I also added a liitle red wine along with the white, used Vidalia onions, button and Baby Bellas and let it cook down for over an hour. Delicous!! I could snack on the "croutons" all day and they definately made the dish!! I will definatly make this again!!

Rating: 4
I have made this soup many times with excellent results. I use a homemade chicken stock rather than the veg stock. Spend the time to caramalize the onions...it makes the dish. Portobellos are great with it but I also would like Shitakes. If you reduce your stock enough, the soup won't be watery or bland. Concentrating the flavors here is the key to a fabulous soup. The goat cheese croutons add a needed crunch and that tang of the goat cheese with this earthy soup is wonderful.

Rating: 3
First pass was "watery" but then vegatable stock is water. Had better luck 2 different ways. First, use beef stock (vegeterians, who cares?) and add just a touch of thickener (cornstarch or flour in cold water). If the vegetarian stuff is all that important, start with 4 quarts of veg stock and reduce it two the prescribed 8 cups. Take your time with the onions and this can be an excellent soup.

I made this soup exactly by the recipe and it was ghastly. I was having a very informal dinner party for a group of eight and trying to accommodate a vegetarian and two people on the Atkins diet (no bread for them so we floated cheese and microwaved). Some bowls came back looking as if nothing had been eaten. While no one said anything, that was a pretty good clue that no one liked it. We filled up on salad and bread. The soup tasted watery and had very little flavor. I think I'll go back to my tried and true recipe that never fails me.

The onions take way longer to carmelize than the recipe says - probably about double the time. When it came time to put the mushrooms in, we half-heartedly deglazed the pot with a few tablespoons of the white wine, reserving the liquid with the onions. There was a lot of onion stuck to the pot, and I was concerned that once the mushrooms were sauteed, that it would burn and spoil the flavor. We used homemade vegetable stock instead of store-bought and opted for brandy. It's a good soup -- an interesting take on French onion -- though I'd say not so different taste-wise in the final analysis. The portobellos really give it more texture than they do discernable flavor. The goat cheese, however, made for an interesting difference from the usual swiss cheese, and accentuated what mushroom flavor there was. I'd make this again, but with 3/4 lb. of mushrooms (maybe criminis, because I think they lend better to broths than portobellos, which don't give up as much of their flavor when sauteed), and 2 lbs. of onions. It was definitely a good soup, though, rich in flavor with a wonderful aroma.

The soup was a bit bland; any ideas how to add more flavor? I used sherry instead of white wine.

I found this to be very flavorful and easy to make, we have made it many times. In refernce to the previous review, it always seems to take longer than listed to caramelize my onions, but I think low and slow brings out the best flavor anyway. The goat cheese (which I love) was OK with this, but we prefer to use Gruyere or Swiss. As my 2 year old says "Mmmmmmm, dat's reaaaalllly good"

Mixed in a few white mushrooms and shitakes and was not disappointed. Also used Maui sweet onions so the taste was a little sweeter than I expected, but nevertheless very good. Doubled the garlic, but I do that with everything. This is a soup I will make again.

This is a great, flavorful soup. However, I did have a problem with the onions - they didn't caramelize in the time noted. I also had to take them out of the pan since the bottom was beginning to scorch. I was using a large Le Creuset dutch oven. Any suggestions. I will definitely make this again - but would like to make sure the onions become caramelized and I am not sure how to do this?

I have recently started to venture into the world of cooking, after deciding, against my family's better judgment, to go veg. My family is packed with great cooks and, until now, I have been shunned from the kitchen because of my lack of interest. I started with soup, which I find will go over well with just about anyone. This soup was one of my first tries. It was very easy, and my family loved it! They were very proud of me, and gobbled up every bit. I have to say I enjoyed it a lot as well. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. I have learned, though, that I really have been paying attention all these years. I was able to make little changes here and there where I saw fit. I used a little less cognac than called for (for my taste), and I used fresh vegetable broth instead of canned. I find the flavor of canned to be a little overwhelming sometimes, but when in a pinch I'm sure it would be great. I like the idea of substituting the wine for a little sherry next time. All and all a great experience for my taste buds, and myself. I would definitely make this again. Delicious!

this soup is fantastic without the bread and cheese. But if you're looking for the ultimate wow! soup check out the porcini mushroom and barley soup.

My boyfriend and I are big mushroom fans, so we really liked this soup. I had to improvise and use marsala instead of white wine and chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, but it still came out fine. Next time I make it I think I will cut back on the onions a little. Also I left the croutons as toast to dip and eat on the side so they wouldn't have a chance to get soggy. Delicious!

Loved this soup! I made it for a dinner party. I used Marsala wine and doubled the garlic. As I couldn't find big Portobellos, I used baby bellas. Making it the day before is mandatory, as the flavors blend and make the soup much richer. This is meant to be a brothy soup, and should be appreciated as such.

Excellent -- perhaps even superior -- variation on French Onion Soup. I used rum rather than brandy and substituted red wine for white with great results (red wine has more depth (and health benefits) than white). As others have mentioned, the broth is a bit thin. A nice solution is to purée 1/3 of the soup at the end of the cooking process, which will thicken the broth and deepen the flavor without losing the chunkier textures which are essential to the character of the soup. Also, I would suggest sautéing the baguette slices in garlic and olive oil until browned rather than merely toasting them.

my husband liked this a whole lot better than i. the flavor of the mushrooms and brandy was pretty good but i thought the body was a bit "thin" and would have been better with some potatoes or cream to round it out a little. but i have to say i really was put off by the appearance. the gills of the portobellos made the broth look fairly "inky" and the onions floating in it just didn't help. it just wasn't very appealing overall.

This made a lot of soup and while my husband and I liked it, it seemed to be missing something. We decided to puree the soup (hand blender) and add a couple of tablespoons of light cream to smooth it out. This made an excellent cream of mushroom soup.

Easy to make, richly flavored, and incredibly tasty soup even without the croutons. It's so flavorful that it's good (and much lower in calories and fat)without the cheese croutons, though a good toasted slice of bread is great. A few extra sprigs of thyme don't hurt either.

Great soup. I used sweet yellow Vidalia onions, and had to substitute shiitaki and cremini mushrooms for the portabello the first time. Both were good, but the portabello are a much better choice, since they add a very earthy depth to the flavor of the soup. I floated a slice of provolone cheese atop the soup, and served the crostini on the side--but they're also great served on top. This one goes into the recipe box for a cold evening...yummy.
