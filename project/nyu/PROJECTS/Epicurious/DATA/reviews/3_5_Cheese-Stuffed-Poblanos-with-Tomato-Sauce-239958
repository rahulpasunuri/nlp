Have to agree with others that 1 1/2 hours is not a "quick and easy" recipe. Roasting and stuffing the poblanos takes a bit of time and practice. Sauce was good but a bit to thin for our taste.

haven't tried but this is my fave from a Mexican restaurant where I used to work; their recipe had a hint of cinnamon in the tomato sauce. That was just the best.

A little tougher than quick and easy and a little greasy but very good.. I don't think the tomato sauce needs any changes.

I think epicurious.com made an error when they put this in the "quick & easy" category. However, the end result was pretty good. Completely agree with the cook from Huntington Beach about the sauce. Also, I think I need practice with dipping chilles into egg and then flouring: It's a bit tricky if you've never done it before.

My husband is the Chiles Rellenos connoisseur and he said I did good with this recipe and that I can make it any time. I simmered the sauce for a lot longer than directed because it was so runny. I would only use 1 tablespoon of oil next time because you could see the oil in the sauce. I cut the cheese into strips as suggested and that worked great. Coating the chiles would be a lot easier if the batter was put in a flatter container. The bowl just didn't work with large poblanos. I served this with a Tex Mex Rice recipe.

Whoops! I meant serrano chiles when I referred to the tomato sauce, not poblanos. Simply blend half an onion, some tomatoes, a garlic clove or two, and serrano chile to taste with some oregano and salt. If you have it, add some cilantro. Heat 1-2 T of vegetable oil in a pot, add the sauce, then simmer, stirring occasionally until reduced to desired thickness.

This is a great traditional Mexican recipe for Chiles Rellenos- I love how simple yet delicious this is. My husband and I have been making these together since we first started dating. I usually just throw together a basic tomato sauce with poblano chiles for a nice kick instead of the more labor intensive version here. I have also stuffed the chiles with sauteed corn, mushrooms and garlic, and even zucchini when it's in season, with the cheese- delicious!

the outcome was delicious! used home-grown poblanos and tomatoes - the sauce was flavorful and the chiles had a kick. the recipe is a bit labor intensive but worth it. next time i would not let the chiles rest so long - they were flimsy and a bit difficult to maneuver through the egg and into the oil.

Fantastic!!!! One of the best Chiles Rellenos recipes I have ever had. Can't wait to try it again and from the other reviews, try it with different stuffings.

It's easier to cut the cheese in thin strip instead of shredded the cheese. Also tastes great with mashed potatoes and cheese inserted together. Have not tried this recipe, but similar to my own.

This is a fine master recipe, from which a number of wonderful varieties can be made. Try stuffing the poblanos with a meat mixture.
