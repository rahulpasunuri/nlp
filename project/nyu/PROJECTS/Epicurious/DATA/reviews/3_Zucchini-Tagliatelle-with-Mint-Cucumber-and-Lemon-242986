Muy Bueno! Like the previous reviewer, I added some apple - don't know if it made a difference or not. My sweetie scarfed it up! The whole recipe - especially with the zucchini "noodles" - was a nice change of pace for a salad.

Thi srecipe was good but lacking something. I added thin apple slices to it to add sweetness and a bit of crunch and it made it much better! I could not find pistachio oil, so used olive instead.

We loved this. We grew an Italian zucchini with very thin skin plus cukes and a nice yellow onion from Dixondale called "Candy" so it seemed like a recipe to order. Earlier this year a friend with a tree gave me tons of lemons and I used the recipe from this site to preserve them and have been using that in all recipes calling for lemon peel and this was FANTASTIC. For people without mandolins I recommend they shave the zucchinis with a veggie peeler. Peel off the skin and then peel strips turning a little each time to make the "tagliatelle". I live in a rural area and did not have pistachio oil but subbed olive oil and did not feel the loss at all. Even though we grow spearmint, my husband is not crazy about "too much" so I cut it in half and he was happy. I will make this again and again during zuke, cuke & onion season!

I don't have a mandoline or V-slicer, so the zucchini slices were not paper thin....which I think is necessary to truly enjoy the delicate balance of flavors. As it was, I had to cut thin slices using a knife -- which weren't thin enough, given that the zucchini is raw. I won't make this again without the proper equipment.
