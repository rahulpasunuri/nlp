I followed others' suggestions changing amounts of some items as follows: only 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup cider veinegar, 1 scant tbsp thyme, and 1/2 tsp cayenne. It was pretty good, but not spectacular.

I agree, too much cider vinegar. I cut it down to 2/3 C. I also added minced ginger (to taste) , and substituted 1/2 of the tomato sauce with low sodium V8. That seemed to round out the flovor better.

Well I decided to try this as something new along with the fact I was just scrounging around the kitchen for things. When I placed the "cider" in I thought too much, but to challenge that tast I cut 1.5 jalapenos. So you get that sweet taste then a quick shot of hot. Along with that I have decided to soak the chicken before hand in the sauce to allow more flavour in the chicken. Also I scrapped the use of the oven and went to the bbq since it was such a nice day outside. Take care, Hugh

I switched dijonnaise for the dijon mustard because I thought I had the mustard and didn't. Then later I made with the mustard. WHoa! Sub the dijonnaise every time! It is so much better, trust me!

This was probably one of the best barbecue sauces I have ever tasted! It would be great also with chicken wings and a little more spice, like some tabasco sauce or even hotter sauce added to the recipe. I would definatly recommend this for anyone to make. And it's easy!!!!

I originally was interested in this recipe, because the ingredients sounded like they would make a good sauce. I was a bit hesitant when I read some of the negative reviews on the taste of the sauce. I decided to make it anyway last night. I think that the problem with this recipe is the measurements. One whole cup of ANY KIND of vinegar would kill a sauce! I cut the amount to 1/3 cup. Also, 1/2 cup of brown sugar is PLENTY to sweeten the sauce. I was also conservative with the cayenne. With these changes, my chicken was delicious and my husband loved it! Try it my way!! You'll like it!

the sauce was okay. My husband did not like bbq sauce.

This a great recipe to serve for a dinner party. It is also fast and easy. I just came from a dinner party where it was served. There weren't any left overs.

I don't understand why this is a four-fork recipe. The chicken was much too tangy (almost sour), and I expected the sauce to be thicker, sort of like the barbecue sauces you buy at the store. It wasn't horrible, but there are probably better recipes out there. Personally, I think slapping on some K.C. Masterpiece would have made for better barbecued chicken, but apparently that's just me!

This was an easy recipe to make, and it took less time. This is something my child can help with. This was enjoyed by everyone who ate it. I would love to make this again in the future.

This sauce was delicious a great balance of sweet and spicy. The next day the chicken was delicious cold. The quantity of sauce this recipe makes is much too much for 2 chickens. It would probably be enough for at least 4!

THis is a fun dish for the family barbeque. The sauce is flexible in that it can be used with pork also. The dish is improved even further by cooking over applewood and charcoal. As written, this recipe is very pleasing and you just can't get enough.
