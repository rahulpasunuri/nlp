This recipe was pretty tasty with some minor changes. I doubled the recipe, and as others have noted, the recipe itself does not say the amount of quinoa to use, but it's a 1:2 ratio. I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth and carmalized the onions separately in evoo (note that I salt my onions a bit while doing this.) I also added some red pepper flakes on my own serving - this added a lot! I will definitely be making again!

I cooked the onions very slowly for an hour to carmelize before adding them to the quinoa, tossed in a handful of slivered toasted almonds, and it was not only delicious, the recipe was requested by one of my guests who then served it for her guests!

delicious with extra cheese!

The recipe does not specify how much quinoa to use. (Usually two parts water to one part quinoa, but could be less if it were rinsed or soaked.)

Read so much about Quinoa not have any flavor so I cooked it in chicken broth and added garlic and parsley salt generously. Added mushrooms and used red and yellow onions, and it was great. I will defintely make this again. Added the parmesan and parsely immedialely after combinining vegetables and covered. Came out wonderfully. Definitely will make this again.

looks unique and good, " whatever looks good eat it, and everything looks good to me." however, it has alot ofcalories and 10g of fat! but oh well, it still is good.

it is definitely a bit bland. I have fried first onions, then added the quinoa and of course chicken stock. I have also added a handful of dried porcini mushrooms and their liquid, and as final step some grated parmesan. This way it turned out nice!!

Quinoa is a good alternative to rice and pasta, and this is a good first recipe to try. Make sure you soak the quinoa first.

This was weird. I didn't like how the onions took over the Quinoa and I didn't really like the parsley flavor. Bottom line: eh.

I omitted the Parm, parsley and pepper and added some chunks of chorizo to the onions while they cooked. The spicy sausage gave lots of flavor and wonderful color to the dish. Gotta love a recipe that only has three ingredients and takes 15 minutes!

I really enjoyed this...I also used chicken broth and added salt at the end, along with a chopped tomato for color. I did not use the parmesan since I used the quinoa as a bed for some scallops which had a vermouth, caper & artichoke sauce, and I thought it might clash. With chicken or something else the parmesan would have been good. This is definitely a "side dish" and needs something with a stronger flavor to accompany it, but it sure beats plain old steamed rice!

I'm giving this a high-ish rating so people don't pass it by, and read the good suggestions by others. This was my introduction to quinoa, and I think it's a good basic approach--when you take into account others' suggestions. That said, I added chicken broth, celery and, later, some fresh diced tomatoes. Like a risotto this could serve as the basis of endless variations. The nutty flavor is wonderful and it's going to become a staple for us. Thanks.

I would not make this exact dish as written. Boring... while it need not be. Now, add a chiffonade of swiss chard and some hot pepper flakes sauteed in the olive oil and you have something. Plus it makes it so much better for you!

very very small amount of mild chicken broth will take care of the 'bland' problem, a tiny bit of salt as the cook from Greece said would also help

I agree with some of the other reviewers. This is very bland as written. I added chopped mushrooms, chopped tomatoes and chopped garlic when sauateeing the onions. Omitted the cheese. Next time I will add more garlic and more salt and pepper. It was very pretty on the plate. The new USDA guidelines make this a keeper.

Once, on a whim, I added some spinach that I needed to use up, and I have never gone back to the original recipe. I thinly slice fresh spinach leaves (a cup or two), add it to the onions when they're already pretty much done and let it wilt. I am vegetarian, so I make a meal out of this. It's delicious and very healthy, except that the original proportions all seem way off to me and so I eyeball them instead. And I add some salt at the end, otherwise I find the dish bland.

Pretty good, though slightly bland. I made one-fourth of the recipe without any problems.

Simple, wonderful side dish. Great way to use quinoa.

Simple, healthy, and my finicky daughter loves it. The perfect week-night quick dinner.
