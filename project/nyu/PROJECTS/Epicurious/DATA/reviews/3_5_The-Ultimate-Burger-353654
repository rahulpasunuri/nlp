Awesome meat for these burgers. The butcher thought I was crazy when I asked them to ground the steak. Easy recipe and probably the best burger you can make. It will surprise you!

Great classic hamburger! Very rewarding making it yourself.. Everyone that had one has now started doing their burgers this way.

I've ground my own hamburger for years and had pretty much decided that brisket was the best cut to use, but after using skirt steak I'll have to change my mind. Well done!

Had my butcher grind flap steak (they thought I was crazy) so I couldn't salt, but it still was great. Served with homemade ketchup on fresh ciabatta rolls.

Made the Ultimate Burger tonight and loved it! Followed the recipe exactly with skirt steak except made thinner patties. After refrigerating six hours, I rinsed the salted steak pieces very well, dried and finely chopped them in my food processor. No salt, but seasoned the patties with freshly ground black pepper. Texture was perfect. Used red-hot cast iron skillet with a little canola oil on a gas stove. Lovely crust. Outstanding flavor! From now on, nothing but a delicious Ultimate Burger will do for me...

I made these burgers for dinner and they were delicious and very juicy. We all loved them and I definately would make them again. I made them just like described. YUM

Pretty ordinary burger. There is nothing in this recipe that takes it over the top. Not the ultimate burger.

I think you should not be able to write a review unless you have made the item exactly as stated. Don't go changing the recipe and throwing out your two cents and don't write before you make. Read my profile; I ALWAYS make it according to the recipe first, then change it the next time if I want. I want to taste it the way it was meant to be. I made these as instructed and they were great! I also made the mustard, which was good, but it needs more heat! I think the "Ultimate" in this is not saying it's got the ultimate toppings, spices, etc.; rather, they mean the burger itself is the ultimate. Do what you want with everything else, but this is a mighty fine burger. I don't know that I'll ever go back to chuck!

I usually make my own burgers from short ribs ,as an Argentinian I'm very familiar with skirt steaks.I prefer using the food processor to a machine, much easier to clean. this burgers are delish.The salting is a good idea

While I agree that the skirt steak does add flavor and juiciness, I find using a combination of 1.75 lbs of SIRLOIN FLAP and .75 lbs of SHORT RIBS adds a better flavor/texture profile.The SHORT RIBS add a density not found in using skirt steak alone. Truth be told, they are both truly the "ultimate burger"...

I always make burgers like this, but as this is a lean cut, I avoid dry burgers by adding 1 tsp of beef tallow for every pound of meat. Also, to really kick it up a notch, try adding a smidge of beef marrow to the mix.

I modified the recipe a bit and it came out utterly fantastic! I used only 1 tsp of salt and upped the pepper to 1/2 tsp. As well, I didn't cook the burgers before serving. This is most definitely a keeper.

OK, Here is my two cents. I am a great big fan of Hubert Keller and eat at the Burger Bar regularly. I also watch his cooking show Secrets of a Chef. On every show he recommends Not salting the burger until just before cooking because it gives the burger a funny texture. I can tell you from experience that he is absolutely correct. Don't overwork the meat and don't salt until just before cooking.

The meat and bread comment is ridiculous. The meat makes all the difference and I think that is the point of this recipe. This article very specifically calls for 2 things that makes it great 1, the choice of meat, and 2, grind it yourself. You control quality and in a burger, that's very important.

I must disagree - a one-ingredient recipe is a refreshing change on here. I only recently mastered the 2-ingredient boiling salted water! http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Salted-Water-for-Boiling-105591

Come on guys, I agree with meat and bread comment; if you're going to advertise as the "Ultimate Burger" I'm going to need a little more than a meat grinder and some pepper to be a believer.

Sellks from ks, it is pretty clear to me that 1 1/2 means "one and one-half". This recipe is first rate. The burger derives its flavor from one ingredient (beef) that is properly prepared, rather than from a lot of fillers and additives. Response to Cook from behind you: If you had READ the instructions you would have seen that it calls for 1 ½ tsp of salt for 2 ½ pounds of meat  not a great amount. You are instructed to first cut the meat into cubes, to add the salt to the cubes of meat and then to rinse the meat under cold water and pat dry before grinding. Rinsing before grinding removes most of the salt. When you use good ingredients and prepare them properly you do not need to enhance the flavor of your burger by adding a bunch of extra ingredients on top (like lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, and a special sauce) or by adding fillers and flavor enhancers mixed in with the ground meat. Once you have the right ingredients and the right technique (this recipe gives you both) you can add what you want, but these things will enhance the good natural flavors of good products, rather than compensate for poor quality and poor technique. Reviewers please read before complaining!

Ingredients: Meat and bread - Instructions: Cook if you are bold... hang on to yer hat... add salt! Can I write for Gourmet also? If you are gonna have a recipe called The ULTIMATE Burger you better back it up with something. This recipe is ridiculously basic, which is fine, but don't expect me to let you take a steak sandwich and advertise it as the greatest burger on the planet without me calling shenanigans.
