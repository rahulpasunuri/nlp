My apples collapsed, but the flavors were terrific.

I love this recipe. I use fresh grated ginger instead of ground, and I've skipped the lemon without missing it. They're excellent cold as well as warm, so I make more than I need and eat them the next day as a snack. I've used different kinds of apples, and so far they've all been great.

Excellent. Quick and easy with great flavor. I also substituted cinnamon for the ginger. Will definitely make them again

This was simply delicious. I used fresh ginger instead of powder, and tried it both with walnuts and almonds. I also used honey insrtead of sugar. My family loved it, and guests loved it too. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious! Admittedly, I used cinnamon rather than ground ginger, but the taste was out of this world! One problem: cooking time. Microwaves can destroy things if you cook them too long, as I realized here... I halved the recipe. In an oven, that wouldn't mean halving the cooking time... Here, though... So my apple was a little leathery and the raisins clumped together the first time I tried it. But if you make sure not to overcook, it is really a great recipe!

This was a delicious recipe. I tried adding a stick of cinnamon to each apple and it gave it a nice little "kick" to the flavor and it looked great.
