made this last year for our new-year's dinner and it was a great hit, used veal tenderloin instead so did not have to carve around the bone, did take a bit of time stuff and tie but well woth the effort, it is just amazing, doing it again this yeat!!!.

Yuck!....everything was going great, and the stuffing looked and tasted fantastic, until I added the cream and breadcrumbs: then it turned into a gloppy mess and tasted incredibly bland.

Everyone loved this recipe. I substituted cremini mushrooms for the button, which gave this dish a wonderful nutty flavor.
