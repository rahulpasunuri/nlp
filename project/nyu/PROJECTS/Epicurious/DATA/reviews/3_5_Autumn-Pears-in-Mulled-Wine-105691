doubled the recipe, and the reduction took FOREVER. didn't know what pickling spices were and couldn't find them at grocery store so had to consult the food dictionary and mulled wine recipes here to figure out which mix of spices to add. only had allspice , cinnamon, ginger, pinch of coriander) added 2 tablespoons of brandy/cognac during reduction for enhancement. for better presentation when serving, added a cookie in the shape of a leave, and bought creme anglais -- put a thin layer of this in the bottom of the individual shallow bowls and put the pear on top with two tablespoons of the mulled wine. the greatest thing about this recipe was the look of it, the taste, and the fact that you can make it ahead. served this at room temperature to enhance flavor.

This dessert was just okay-nothing special. My husband agreed. We are looking for special recipes for the Thanksgiving holiday- this didn't make the cut.

INCREDIBLE!!! My friends were very impressed. I didn't have time to chill it, so we ate it at room temperature, and it was fine. However, I didn't use a big enough pot. It spilled out and splattered, and the red wine is very hard to get out of stuff. I used a $4.50 bottle of Merlot, and it was great - I don't see why an expensive bottle would be any better. This is a great dish to "wow" people - and it's easy!

Very easy to make and the final product is beautiful. The presentation is an A+. One suggestion is to strain the mulled spices or use a tea ball to contain the mulled spices while simmering. ENJOY
