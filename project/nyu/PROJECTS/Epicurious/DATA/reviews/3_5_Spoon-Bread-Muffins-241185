Like the texture and that that there is no sugar. Taste best hot.

I actually really love these - they are so light, and they are nice and salty, which I love. I agree with the below reviewers that they don't taste like cornbread, but more like a very light bread. Fantastic!

wow, these are the oddest muffins I've ever made. they're not terrible, but they're not great. very strange texture, not like custard or muffin, kind of rubbery. they definitely have corn flavor and do taste good with butter and honey (but then again, so would my shoes). if you're craving a delicate corn muffin with good crumb, this isn't it. I do think these will make fantastic cornbread stuffing though.

Wow...I didn't like these muffins too much. Just okay, not great and I love cornmeal. I think there are better recipes out there, but just my opinion

I loved these muffins because they were so moist and easy to assemble. And I found that they were just as good warmed up the next day for breakfast. The only caution I would add is that you should moniter the time carefully. My muffins took only 15 minutes to bake.
