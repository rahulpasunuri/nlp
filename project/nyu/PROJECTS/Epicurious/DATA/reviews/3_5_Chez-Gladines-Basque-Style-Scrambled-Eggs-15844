Definitely a keeper. We substitute some very thinly sliced, on the diagonal, Italian sausage for the ham. We also make a double batch and utilize multi-colored peppers, yellows, golds etc.

I liked it, but it was a little too sweet. I think it must have been all those onions plus the sugar.. the next time, I'd reduce the sugar.

This is a very good recipe. I, however, would add a creamy white cheese, such as Havarti or mild Brick along with some crispy fried, crumbled bacon. As a side, english muffins or southern style biscuits. mmmmmmmm good.
