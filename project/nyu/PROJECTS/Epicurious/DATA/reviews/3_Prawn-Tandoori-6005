As other reviewers have said, the amount of ginger seems completely out of proportion and overwhelms the flavor to the point that it actually spoils the meal. Excessive ginger aside, the sauce has a cool, fresh taste to it, but could probably use some sweetness. Not really a keeper.

Surprisingly bland and tasteless, with an offputting pasty texture to the sauce. I was dissapointed.

Way too much ginger, for my taste. Try about a teaspoon. Everything else seemed good.

I would increase the red pepper flakes to 1/3 to 1/2 teaspoon. Marinate for one hour at room temperature and cook under the broiler till pink, turning once. Bring the remaining marinate to a boil and serve over rice.
