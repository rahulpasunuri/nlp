Followed the recipe, using both thyme and rosemary. substituting anchovy paste for whole anchovies so the texture would be right. Served on French bread toasts with a smear of goat cheese. everyone loved it.

Followed recipe, but used both thyme and rosemary. Delicious. If you use the ingredients as specified, it won't be too sweet, but rather, well balanced. Guests loved it.

Too sweet, perhaps reduce figs. The anchovy fillets seemed to overwhelm. I won't make again, but if I did would put in 1/2 fillet of anchovy, taste before adding more. I used fresh thyme and regular Maille dijon as did not have whole grain mustard. Had to toss as no one would eat.
