Relatively easy and quick, but has the great flavors of India, is healthy and delicious! Both my husband and I LOVED this. It is a keeper. I didn't have curry leaves, so omitted them. Also, corn is currently out of season, so substituted about 1-1.5 cups of frozen corn for the 3 ears. Turned out great.

So good! The family loved it. Bursting with flavor, this dish brings veggies to life. Definately going to make again!

I was looking for a vegetarian recipe to take advantage of in-season green beans and came across this one that had corn too. I can't tolerate spicy heat, so I omitted the cayenne pepper and chili. I really wanted to use the fresh curry leaves, but it would have required a special trip to the Indian market, so I didn't use them but will definitely use them next time. I do think 3/4 C of coconut is too much. I reduced the amount to 1/2 and I think that was still too much. I recommend 1/4-1/3 C. I added 1 t. of sesame oil, but it wasn't enough to add flavor. I might try adding chick peas next time for some added protein. I served it over brown basmati rice, I really enjoyed this and will make it again.

So good. i added shrimp to make it more of a full meal, but it honestly wasnt necessary, even for meat eaters like us. just really fresh veggies make it great. you will need some water in the last phase of cooking for sure  probably about 1/4 cup.
