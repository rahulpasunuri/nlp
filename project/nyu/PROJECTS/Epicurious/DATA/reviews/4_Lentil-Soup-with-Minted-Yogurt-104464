Delicious!! My vegetarian daughter loved it. I threw some sausage and bacon in a pan and served it to he dad and he raved about it. He grumbled about what the heck were "lentils" but ate two servings.

Per the other suggestions, I put 3 Tablespoons of curry and about 1 cup of tomato puree. It really added a lot of flavor.

wow! great recipe. Greek yogurt really makes the flavor pop!

I didn't have fresh herbs for the topping, so I stirred dried herbs into the soup at the end of cooking. It was wonderfully balanced with the curry.

Ever since I came back from a 2-month trip to Nepal, I've been trying to find a recipe similar to the dal bhat (lentil soup with rice) I ate every day there. And this is it! Although they don't add carrots to the dal in Nepal, I do like them in this recipe. I did halve the amount of lentils and more than doubled the amount of curry. I think I may be the only person who did not care for the minted yogurt. I used greek yogurt, and that might have been my mistake. Next time I will use regular yogurt. Make this recipe, cook up some basmati rice, pour the dal (lentil soup) over the rice, add some sriracha sauce, and you're set! Super healthy and super delcious.

Excellent tasting and easy to make. I followed the advice of other reviews and upped the curry powder to 2 Tbs. I also added about 1/2 can of tomato paste since I find a little tomato adds a nice touch to most any curry. I don't see how this recipe serves 10 - the pot is almost 1/2 gone with only 2 of us eating it last night as a main course.

I love lentil soup and this is one of the best! Recipe is great on its own, or can be used as a basis for your own ideas. I also pureed about half of the soup, which gave it a nice texture. The yogurt topping is essential!

once cooked I blended the entire thing and made a great puree! very healthy and the yogurt was great.I deglaced the pan with a little of white wine before adding the stock. I will do this one again.

I make this at least a couple times per month during the fall / winter. The herbed yogurt sauce (Bulgarian yogurt is the best in my opinion) makes it & I add lots of fresh herbs (whatever is on hand) and a good amount of S&P. I prefer it with more carrots, garlic and curry & add celery. Freezes well.

as the husband I have to give this 5 forks. Absolutely fantastic. A spritz of lemon was a major addition

i made this soup for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. the yogurt is what gets this 4 forks instead of 3, although my vegan buddies didn't use the yogurt and still loved the soup. use greek yogurt. i added more curry and garlic, as suggested by previous posters. both the soup and the yogurt freeze beautifully for later consumption.

I make this soup all the time. Definitely experiment with the amounts of carrots and curry. I usually use Jamaican Curry and lots of it - it's a little spicier, smokier, and saltier! The yogurt makes it great! Yum!

My family was just so-so with this recipe. Not my favorite way to have lentils, even with the wonderful yogurt. Served this to guests also who seemed neutral and the soup but enthusiastic about the yogurt! I did do extra garlic and curry as suggested. Kids wouldn't get near it.

Excellent. Spicier than expected (I used lots of hot curry powder, so I guess I should have expected it to be hot). A bit much for a hot night in July, but hearty and delicious - I'll make it again in the Fall or Winter. I made the adjustments as advised by others - extra garlic, extra curry, and threw in some spinach (which I highly recommend).

Rating: 3
This is quite good, although I, too, used double the curry called for, double the garlic, and half the onions, as others have suggested here. I then blended about a third of the soup to give it an overall thicker texture. Good cold-weather soup.

I made this soup with veggie broth, I doubled the curry amount and added more garlic. The soup that night was just ok. The day after, it was just delicious. I would recommend to make that soup at least a day ahead

Made this last night with homemade curry powder and a few changes - delicious! I almost doubled the curry, finely diced the carrot, added a few extra cloves of garlic, used small black lentils, added some chili flakes and a pound of sauteed/drained baby spinach (had to use it up). Great results. I did use all 9 cups of broth, didn't puree as some have and seasoned with salt and pepper as it cooked - I don't like seasoning at the end only as I think that it sits on top of the flavors instead of penetrating into the dish. Also added a clove of garlic to the yogurt topping. Great meal with crusty bread and a tomato/cuke salad.

Great soup with a few changes. I made my own curry powder and increased it to almost double the amount called for in original recipe. Used tiny black lentils and added 1lb. of sauteed/drained baby spinach (needed to use it up) as well as some sliced sausage to appease my meat-loving husband. Increased garlic in soup by a few cloves and added one clove to the yogurt mix. Also used all 9 cups of broth and seasoned with salt and pepper as it cooked - I think waiting till the end leaves the seasoning on the top of the flavors and doesn't really allow it to become part of the dish. Really great cold night meal with crusty bread and a tomato/cuke salad.

As a lover of lentil soup, I enjoyed this very much. The astonishing thing about it was that my entire lentil soup-hating family enjoyed it, too! Guess this one will become the house recipe! Changes I made: added a couple of ribs of chopped celery, used less oil and sweated the veggies, used a combo of du Puy and regular brown lentils because that's what I had on hand, used 8 c. of chicken broth and 2 c. of broth from a beef pot roast, and added about 3/4 c. leftover chopped beef from the roast.

I added more garlic, curry powder, and garam masala. Spciy and filling. This recipe is very versitile and you could add any leftover vegetables that you might have in your fridge.

This has become a staple of mine when I want something easy that has a little "wow" factor. The herbed yogurt provides wonderful balance for the curry. Like another reviewer, I used 2 c. of lentils, and would also recommend high-quality curry powder. Freezes well and my 3 year old loves it!

Rating: 4
Very good. I recommend using red lentils and only about 2 cups unless you want mud instead of soup. Another tip: more garlic and less onion! The yogurt sauce is good (even w/o the basil), and we also like this soup with crunchy sauteed onions and/or spicy cilantro sauce.

This is the second time I've made this soup. It is so uncomplicated yet so delicious. I freeze portions to have for a quick and tastey meal. I agree with the others on adding more curry.

This has now become one of my cold weather staple dishes. The cool yogurt sauce is wonderful with the spicy soup. As some of the other reviewers had advised, I added more curry.

This soup is very good, however I would make some of the changes suggested by others. Add celery, more curry (5-6 tsp), more garlic, salt, pepper, tabasco sauce, and more broth. I would also give it a blend with an immersion blender to make the texture more creamy. The yogurt is especially good, and the soup and yogurt are very nice together.

Why do almost all lentil recipes fail to say what kind of lentils are required? It does make a lot of difference whether you use, for instance, red or green ones. But apart from that (with the green lentils I used) a very tasty soup. I suggest adding some celery.

Terrific! I only used one medium onion and about 7 cups of chicken broth; I also added artichokes. The consistency is wonderfully thick and flavorful. The yogurt sauce is a perfect accompaniment, and I'll use it with other dishes!

I made this as a side dish rather than a soup and it was fab with the yoghurt topping.

Delicious! Love the spicy zip of the curry. Mixed in extra garlic and hot curry powder for even more of a kick. I also only used 8 cups of broth for a thicker consistency. The yogurt sauce is a perfect complement. This was just the right recipe for a cold, cold night!

This soup was a winner, but i have to admit I made lots of changes. I halved the amount of lentils I used, it would have been an overwhelming amount otherwise. I added several extra kinds of veggies: Celery, pebers, extra onions, lots of extra garlic. I also added significant amount extra of curry. Even with half the amount of lentils I ended up using 8+ cups of broth because the lentils soak up so much liquid. I aim for a completely vegan diet so instead of using yogurt I blended half a pound of silken tofu with juice from one and a half lemons and a spoonfull of rice vinegar. Then I added salt and the fresh herbs. Make sure to boil the lentils long enough 1 hour 15 minutes is absolute minimum boiling time, I think my soup got closer to being on the stove for 2 hours.

The fresh herbs really made the difference in this dish. I followed the reviewers' advice and only used 8 cups of broth, plus some crushed red pepper. I would prefer less onion and more of some other vegetable, though I'm not sure what would be best.

Good, easy soup for a cold winter's day. Yogurt mixture makes it. Only used 7-8 cups of chicken broth for a thicker, heartier soup. Red pepper flakes for a bit of zip. To Felicity from New York: boiling lentils separately for 10 minutes and discarding that water before adding them to the vegetable/broth mix should help with your problem!

This is one of my household's absolute favorite soups. Fabulously easy and delicious. I prefer a bit more carrot and a bit less onion than suggested, but this is a gem.

I found this lentil soup to be very uninteresting on its own -- it definitely requires the yogurt sauce which is delicious and could be used as an accompaniment for a wide variety of dishes. I'll be making the sauce again, but not the soup.

Great recipe. The yogurt is a must. Used low fat. Probably would taste different with regular yogurt. Liked the tart taste. Followed the other reviewers advice and added red pepper, small amount of grand marsela and tobasco while cooking. Would have been bland without it. Used 8 cups of chicken broth and cooked longer and uncovered soup to make it thicker. Made a great dinner with bread dipped in olive oil, garlic and pepper for Christmas eve. Don't forget a good bottle of wine.

The yogurt mixture made this soup a 4. I used vegetable broth i/o chicken broth. The taste and crunch of the fresh herbs in the yogurt with the soup were great additions. Enjoy!

I made this in a crock pot. Lentils are great for long slow cooking because they keep their shape (unlike split peas). I used 8 cups of broth and never needed to add more moitsure. The browing step was also completely skipped. The yogurt is absolutely essential and really makes the dish.

This soup was easy and very tasty. I soaked the lentils for an hour and I also cooked them with a dried hot pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of garam masla.
