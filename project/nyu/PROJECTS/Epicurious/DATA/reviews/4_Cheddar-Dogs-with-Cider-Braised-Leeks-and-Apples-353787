Really liked this but felt it needed some tweeking. Added extra caraway and put the apples in later so they still had some life left in them. (The first time I made them, they disappeared into mush). The leeks really disappear flavor-wise so I'll either add onions or substitute next time to get the onion flavour. Satisfying and yummy meal.

Quite good - interesting combination of flavors.

Made this as part of a hot-dog bar which was part of the choices at a party we held. Everyone loved this. I thought I had allspice in my well-stocked pantry; turned out that was a no-go, so I just grated in a bit of fresh nutmeg. Will definitely make again. Have some leftovers and like the suggestion of serving with pork medallions--conjures up a cool fall evening menu.

Enjoyed this very much. Used Strongbow ciderand a little bourbon to braise the leeks and apple. We don't eat hot dogd so I used the cheese and leeks/apples to top medallions of pork tenderloin that I grilled on the BBQ alongside a grilled potato salad. If I could give this 3.5 forks I would. This is also something you could make in the winter months as well.

These were fabulous! Way to kick up something so bland and traditional. Loved them!

We made a number of these "international" dogs the month this issue came out. This was by far everyone's favorite. Making it again tonight - can't wait.

Meant to make this exactly as written, but at the last second realized we didn't have allspice. I added a bit of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg and then thought it might end up too sweet so added a dash of spicy curry. Sliced the apples thin like the reviewer from Scranton suggested and used Strongbow for our hard cider. Does that count? Anyway flavor was great served with bratwurst! Will make again for sure.

We made it exactly as it appeared... it was fantastic. The next time, I would slice the apples thin... the dice made them a little difficult to eat.

Definitely my new guilty pleasure, really jazzes up a dog. These would be great to serve at a BBQ sure to impress those expecting typical hot dogs.

Delicious. Followed recipe exactly and couldn't be happier. Would be great served alongside chicken too.
