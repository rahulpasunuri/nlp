Great salad for entertaining. Looks beautiful. Was happy that I could prepare most of it ahead of time.

Made this salad, adding roasted pears from the "bitter greens with roasted pears" salad recipe. Fabulous! Beautiful, aromatic and delicious. The fresh herbs are pricey in March but worth it.

Wow. Great salad to bring to a party. Sprinkled shelled edamame over red onion. Picked tarragon and basil from garden right before making dressing.Will make again.

Incredibly good salad...something you would be served in a top restaurant. The dressing was the perfect compliment to the salad...so light yet bursting with flavor. Fresh is imperative to success though...organic mixed greens with Italian sweet red onions and fresh herbs. I used the basil, but substituted fresh chives and italian parsley for the tarragon. You could easily substitute the herbs to your preference and not adversely affect the outcome. Don't roast the asparagus though, the freshness it retains when cooked as directed is an integral part of the salad's character. It tastes like Summer bursting in your mouth! I will definitely turn to this salad and dressing frequently from now on.

I used Pineapple and mango spears instead of orange. Used about 3 cups of greens. Loved the dressing.

Beautiful presentation of a healthy and delicious salad! My husband is still raving about the dressing, and we'll definitely make this one for a crowd again! Roast the asparagus, if you have extra time.

I made it for 17 people. My oranges were so dry and I was short on time. I purchased fresh jarred grapefruit. Everyone raved. The dressing is very light and delicious. I whirred it in the blender and got a frothy result. Yum!

We thought this combination of flavors was as lovely as it sounded. This was for my Easter brunch, so I made the dressing and prepped oranges and asparagus the day before, as suggested - I think the time to let the dressing flavors marry was key, because it definitely tasted even better when served than when I made it. The tarragon and basil really came through. My only wish is for a bigger platter to fit all those greens...! (Still got raves on the presentation.)

A cousin made this dish for our Easter celebration, she told me she got it from this site. I not only found the recipe with one click but your entire website. I have made this three times in the past 2 months for different reasons. Those I've shared it with love it also!!!

Delicious! This is a keeper. Couple of changes, many from previous reviewers - thanks! Broil the aspargus (trim, light coat of olive oil, on baking sheet, sprinkle with kosher salt, 10 minutes...so yummy!). Oranges...you've got to be kidding, open a can of mandarin and save yourself alot of time! I soaked the onions in the dressing (just placed them on when serving. Add some honey roasted Almonds last and you are going to get RAVE reviews. Enjoy

I made this for Easter last year to rave reviews. The buddies who always come over for holidays have already put in requests for "that salad". Even my picky grandgirl liked it!

I used this recipe as my building block. The asparagus, red onion, orange and lettuce greens peaked my interest. I then added toasted pistachios, smoked mozzerella cheese, smoked ham and tomatoes. I think I will leave out the ham next time, switch to another type of cheese, but the asparagus, onion and orange together were just super.

The combination of the asparagus, oranges, and baby greens & basil was excellent! I tweaked the dressing entirely, however, and did a basic mixture of olive oil, walnut oil & red wine vinegar & added chopped toasted walnuts & a pinch of sea salt.

This is a salad I look forward to every summer. It's just a great way to begin the season of fresh produce and all of the available herbs. The tarragon is a lovely addition to it but other herbs would do nicely too. Enjoy!

My husband picked out this recipe. We both loved and and have served to guest a few times. We always get asked to make it again! The tarragon is really a wonderful taste with the orange.

I just love this salad. It is very refreshing, colourful and delicious. I did not use the Tarragon in the dressing, but it didn't matter. I will use this dressing now for a lot of my green salads. Thank you Epicurious you have done it again

Very nice recipe. A nice contrast of flavors, the tarragon with the oranges. We enjoyed this very much!

Fabulous presentation, crisp, fresh taste. The tarragon dressing is out of this world and makes the salad. Wonderful summer fare!

The salad was a hit with my dinner guests. Next time, I'll doctor the dressing. It needs some work.

I didn't care for the dressing. It was rather "harsh" -- even after I cut down on the mayonaisse ! I made a balsamic vinegarette to go with it instead. Overall, the salad was not a huge hit.

Very good, and we aren't big lovers of tarragon!

This salad makes a wonderful presentation on the table. I would have never expected the flavors to go so well with each other. A huge hit with my inlaws.

I got lots of raves on the presentation of this salad, but I could only fit maybe four cups of torn lettuce in the center of my biggest platter and that became awkward for serving. The dressing was too tart and thick.

This is my most requested salad recipe for family gatherings. The combination of the asparagus and orange segments proves to be a refreshing combination.
