These were delicious! I made the mistake of making them too large to fry easily, and I think it would have been much easier if I had made them a bit smaller. Also, I only drained by ricotta for about and hour and a half and they turned out great anyways. Really yummy!

I made this recipe without the smoked mozzarella. I prepared it two different ways, one with the fritters rolled in parmesan and one with them rolled in breadcrumbs. I preferred the breadcrumbs...they were just a little too cheesy with the parm coating. Also, I added chives to the ricotta one of the times I made them, and I liked that much better. They're okay, but not the greatest.

I made this yesterday and I have to say it was worth all the work. I have a few tips I'll note here for my and your future reference. First, don't succumb to the temptation to make these any bigger than walnut-sized. If you start making them too big, they don't stay together. Keep them small and you should get about 24. I got 20 from this recipe and I think mine were a little oversized. Also, the recipe doesn't say this but you have to work really fast. If the dough warms up in your hands, it will deform in the egg and flour steps and you'll have a mess. I even refrigerated the dough for about 10 minutes partway through to help it stay cool. After you take them out of the 'frige, you have a chance to re-roll and get them rounder. When frying them, make sure they brown on the bottom before you try to turn them. They are kind of like potstickers that way - if you turn too soon the bottom sticks to the pan and you lose the coating. Be careful to keep the coating intact as much as possible when turning too, but even if they break they still taste good. They were yummy - crunchy on the outside and smoky/cheesy on the inside. Enjoy!
