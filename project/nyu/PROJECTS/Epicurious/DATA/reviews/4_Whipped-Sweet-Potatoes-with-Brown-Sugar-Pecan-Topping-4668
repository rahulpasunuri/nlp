Love this recipe! I recommend roasting 2-2 1/2 lbs of yams at 400 degrees for about an hour. Let them cool slightly and then remove the skin and then whip them with a 1/2 stick (4 Tbsp) of butter and omit the sugar. You won't need the extra sugar in the potatoes if you roast them in the oven -- they will be PLENTY sweet without it. I follow the rest of the recipe to the letter except I use the other half of the stick of butter in the topping (4 Tbsp). It's really more like a dessert than a side dish! SO delicious!!

If you like your sweet potatoes *sweet*, this is a great recipe. Streusel topping is a sweet, crunchy bark. One change, forced by pantry but would do again: used Honey Bunches of Oats instead of plain cornflakes. Also - what the egg adds to the whipped potatoes escapes me. Did not seem necessary.

Love This Recipe!!! - have been doing it for years - with a few changes... no sugar in the potatoes mix, also no pumpkin spices - I find sweet pot. great enough on their own, all these years I had no corn flakes, so I did only the nut/sugar mix - this year I added them and was disappointed... once reheated they were chewy and unappealing.. will go back to nut/sugar mix only. I had people tell me these were the Best Sweet Potatoes They Ever Had! Ah - also - I bake my potatoes whole - keep their sweetness and there's no skinning, only peeling once cooled.

An absolute hit at Thanksgiving dinner. I used 1 1/2 cups of pecans, 1/2 cup of cereal, and less sugar mixed in with the sweet potatoes. Everyone loved the nuts! I know this recipe will become an annual favourite.

Doubled this recipe, and had half of it left over..but not because it wasn't delicious..My cousin said "I'm never one to want to eat sweet potatoes, but I really like this!" I did the cornflakes , and used Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus spice instead of Pumpkin pie spice..much much better..I didn't drizzle any melted butter on the top of the topping..and it was fine..(I forgot in the final rush to get the T-Day spread on the table..

We enjoyed this! I did add some to the recipe based on personal palatableness; *added finely chopped apple *cut down on butter 1/3 *added 1tsp orange zest *added half cup fine chop cranberries. *topping, added mini marshmallows, they browned so nice giving the dish a savory unveiling. My better half could not believe how yummy this was ... :)))

Well I'm usually not one to beat a dead horse but this recipe was by far one of the best things I have EVER served at my table. I had 13 people for dinner...9 of whom HATED sweet potatoes going into dinner...all of whom are now huge fans! It was easy to prepare. Because I doubled the amount of potatoes I did cut back on the amount of butter and sugar a little bit...but otherwise followed all the ingredients etc. and was extremely happy with the results.

I made this as directed - terrible. As a fan of yams roasted, whipped and candied, I could not believe how awful this turned out. The topping only made it worse. Made in an effort to encourage our son to eat yams - backfired big time. Deleted and would have given zero forks if possible.

When I first made this recipe five years ago it was voted a must-have standard for every Thanksgiving dinner. I love that it is enjoyed by babies (prepared without nuts) and toddlers as well as gorwn-ups. I use a food processor to combine the sweet potatoes, butter, eggs, sugar, and spices... makes for a nice and smooth consistancy. One year I was only able to cook the dish at 350°F due to shared oven space and while it didn't puff up as nicely, everyone still raved.

I love this recipe. The first time I made it I followed it to the "t" and I loved all but the topping. I feel you can do without the cornflakes. Now that I've made it a couple of times, I've made some substitutions, I cut the butter pretty much in half, on both sides, I use brown sugar IN the potato mixture, and only use 3TBS, and instead of using the pumpkin pie spice, I go with 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp clove. For the topping I omit the cornflakes, cut the butter in half and the sugar in half...you'd be amazed at how similar this healthier version tastes.

Rating: 4
Autumn is upon us! This is an excellent stand alone dessert OR side dish. I did not have time to roast or mash the potatoes. I just cut them in cubes and boiled them with the skins on for fiber/nutrition. Then I put them in a casserole dish and mixed with two tablespoons of raw sugar and the same amt of apple pie spice. Dotted the whole thing with 1/2 stick of butter and dash of salt. Followed the topping recipe as written except I added the remaining 1/2 stick of butter. Baked in the oven for 15 mins. Came out perfectly. Really did not need that much sugar in the sweet potatoes/butter as called for.

I'm not a cook and I found this recipe to be really easy. We used it in place of our traditional candied yams. It was much less work and took less time, and we all thought it was delicious. No more slaving over the hot stove to make candied yams. This is our new family turkey side dish. And I did it! Try it, you'll like it.

I have made this a few times, although can be time consuming with the boiling and beating, its worth it. A scrumptious winter dish that can be served with a meal, or a sweet dish at a tea party. I sometimes add a variety of nuts,i adjust the spice mix and always add cardamon in the spice.

This recipe is great but proportions are a little off. Roast 4 potatoes instead of 2 for the amount of other ingredients - roasting gives a greater depth of flavor. There is no point in adding the egg unless you whip the white separately and fold it in just before putting in the oven. For the topping cube cold butter and combine all ingredients and store in freezer. Top at very end of heating process and broil on low, make sure rack is in the middle of oven and not too close to broiler. This keeps it from becoming oily and helps crisp it. The amount of topping is double of what you need.

I thought, and the rest of my family thought this was EXCELLENT. I love things really sweet, but not necessarily for dinner---so I substituted a tablespoon of maple syrup for the sugar in the sweet potatos and halved the sugar in the topping and thought it was wonderful. Definitely a new member of our Thanksgiving table. We had 20 for dinner, including children and it suited everyone.

This recipe was waaaay better than I expected! I knew from the amount of sweetness going into it that it would be more of a dessert dish and I was right. I pretty much stuck exactly to the recipe and would do the same again. I used 5 sweet potatoes (or yams? I can never tell the difference but they're orange). It's pretty much like sweet potato pie. Yum! This would be excellent with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe was good, but not outstanding. I used yellow sweet potatoes and walnuts instead of pecans. I also used a little less sugar and butter. I didn't have corn flakes on hand for the topping, so those were not part of the dish. Nonetheless, a nice, hearty potato dish (and not overly sweet) that I will probably make again

I had read this recipe yesterday and wasn't able to get back to it before cooking tonight so I just tried to remember what I could. I used 4 baked sweet potatoes because that's what I had left over from Thanksgiving. I used 4 Tablespoons of butter in the mixture and just sprinkled ground cloves, cinnamon and ginger until it tasted good. Because it baked in a rather deep, small pan I only used 2 tablespoons of butter and a sprinkling of brown sugar and pecans on top. It was delicious but very sweet. The kids had it for dessert!

I will absolutely make this recipe for every Thanksgiving for the rest of my life. It was delicious, and my guests couldn't get enough of it. I didn't have enough time to cook the sweet potatoes, add the pecan topping and cook again, so I did it all at one time and they came out beautiful.

We've been making this recipe (with a few alterations from our experiences) since 1997. Every year I suggest a new side dish, and I'm met with a shocked look and 'WHAT? None of OUR SWEET POTATOES'? No exaggeration here. Really is that good. However, I do not use the Corn Flakes, and cut the sugar by half. You won't miss either. Take the extra time to roast your Yams or Sweet Potatoes, it really enriches the dish. Also, I use a shallower, and wider dish (double batch works in a lasagna pan). After baking I broil the top for an extra minute or two to get that crispness everyone fights over. We NEVER have enough left of this item! Happy Holidays!

Absolutely scrumptious! These went very quickly. I would definitely double the recipe next time- this doesn't make a lot. Also, I would reduce the butter in the topping since it bordered on greasy.

This was one of the best (yet easiest) sweet potato dishes I've ever made. I cut back the butter to 1/2 stick for the potatoes and 1/2 stick for the topping. It was so fluffy and smooth that it reminded me of a souffle. Everyone loved it. Definitely a "keeper".

Although i am just beginning to cook, I loved this dish. advice for those who found it dry: I didn't cook it for nearly the 25 minutes suggested, more like 15 at 450, not 425. and i used granola, not corn flakes. soooo delicious.

This has potential, but needs a lot of work. The potatoes are too dry...perhaps some cream and/or more butter. The topping was tasty, but it was too thick and didn't crisp well. This might be better in a larger baking dish to thin out the topping. Very disappointing.

Made this for Thanksgiving, and it was barely touched. It wasn't sweet enough for the marshmallowy-sweet yam fans, and was too sweet for the purists. I threw away 3/4 of the pan. FYI, I crushed the cornflakes prior to measuring 1 1/2 cups, and I thought the topping tasted too much of corn.

Easy and delicious for Thanksgiving. I baked the potatoes and made the puree a day ahead, prepared the topping ingredients then too and combined them just before baking. The topping has a great crunch and a rich, caramelized taste. Unless you want dessert rather than a vegetable side dish, though, reduce the sugar substantially in the puree(I used none) and cut down on the butter in the puree as well-you won't miss them and the dish will go better with other foods, won't be so overwhelmingly rich and sweet.

I combined this recipe with an idea from another. To really boost the flavor of the yams, try baking them whole until completely soft (1 1/2 hours or so). Then peel and mash - not puree - and leave them slightly lumpy. Add the butter and other ingredients. I didn't have cornflakes so substituted some Harvest Grain cereal in the topping. Baking the potatoes makes a significant difference in the flavor.

I'm in total agreement with other comments. Use half the amout of sugar and the quantity of topping was just right when I doubled the recipe (not the topping) and baked in a 9x12 pan.

Doubled the amount of potatoes, but kept the amount of butter and sugar the same - although I used brown sugar, not white and a little less spice. Also added 1/4 c. half and half (for creaminess and to make up for the decreased butter). Used way less topping than the recipe called for (we don't like overly sweet dishes). Was a big crowd pleaser. I baked it for 40 minutes in a 350 oven using a 9 x 13 dish.

However, my family and friends are just the opposite and this will be made for this years Christmas. Thank goodness for the internet!!!

OH my goodness!!! This recipe is ab fab!! I just made a few modifications. I baked the potatoes at 400F for 1 hour rather than boiling them. Make sure the potatoes are cooked all the way through otherwise you'll end up with lumps. Instead of cornflakes for the topping I used 1 cup oats and I put on mini marshmallows. I also put in 1 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. However the amount of the amount of the topping is quite a bit so next time I'm going to cut the amount in half.

The topping has a crunchy-yet-chewy toffee-like consistency. It's wonderful. My guests renamed it to "Sweet Potato Brulee". If you follow the recipe exactly, you will have a high topping-to-potato ratio. This means you can leave it as-is for a really sweet treat, or be able to add another potato or two and still have enough topping to cover the extra potatoes underneath. Obviously, it will be less sweet, but some people prefer it that way.

Very good side dish. I made it for two Thanksgiving parties. The first time I refrigerated the potatoes overnite and the second time I didn't. Much creamier when not refrigerated.

My family finally loved these sweet potatoes. I made everything in advance...put the topping on before reheating. It was very easy!

I've made this recipe for Thanksgiving several years now. Very good. Since I host both sides of the family at the same time (avoids eating a big meal twice), I've had to triple it and it still comes out great. To save time, and also avoid too much moisture in the potatoes, I bake the sweet potatoes, then peel them while still warm. Very easy!

I made this for Thanksgiving 2003 as an alternative to the sweet potato/marshmellow concoction my mother used to make and my kids loved. This recipe was the biggest hit of Thanksgiving! My somewhat sophisticated adult diners all gobbled it up, and my family fought over the leftovers. Yes it's sweet and rich, so what? I used two cans of drained sweet potatoes and two eggs, by the way; kept everything else the same. This dish will have a permanent place at my Thanksgiving table!

Great recipe! Everyone loved it. I substituted 2 tbsps of sugar in the potatoes instead of 6 and thought it was perfectly sweet without being overwhelming. Will definitely make this again!

Although extrememly high in butter, this recipe was amazing. I made it for a dinner serving 100 people and got rave reviews. My one complaint was that there was too much topping per sweet potato. Instead of using uncooked sweet potatoes, I used cooking sweet potatoes in light syrup. This was much easier when serving 100 people. Amazing!! Too rich and high in fat for everyday fair, but for a special occation this is fantastic.

I have made this recipe a few times. I cut the sugar in half for both sugars and the butter. Much better and less sweet. I also baked the sweet potatoes beforehand, which also made the dish taste sweeter without the added sugars. Also, make sure you crunch up the cornflakes really well. Enjoy.

I've made this recipe a couple of times now. I've already had people SWEAR it was the best they ever had, and a neighbor wants me to make it for every event she has planned this year! I'm now known as the neighbor with the great sweet potato recipe, and I think that I'll only have to make it a couple more times to get my boyfriend to propose! He says it's the best sweet potato dish he's ever had. As for the sugar content...the sweeter the better!

Very easy. I only used half the amount of butter for the topping, and it still tasted great. A good basic recipe to keep on hand.

If this wasn't your favorite, try this: Pre-heat the oven to 350. Take a pound of sweet potatoes (yams), peel and boil them, toss them in the garbage, open up a tub of Ben & Jerry's (I like Phish Food), and tell your family to order themselves a pizza.

If you like that recipe, try this one: Sweet Potato Casserole 6 fresh yams 1/2 t. salt 3 eggs 1 C. sugar 5/8 C. evaporated milk 1-1/2 t. vanilla 1/2 stick butter melted Prepare yams like the recipe on the site. Mash them. Add all ingredients and whip til fluffy. TOPPING: 1/2 stick butter melted 1 C. light brown sugar 1/2 C. flour 1 C. chopped pecans 1-1/2 t. cinnamon 1-1/2 t. vanilla Mix. Sprinkle on top of sweet potato mixture. Bake at 350 deg. for 45 minutes. Just like a pie without the crust. The vanilla really does something special to it.

This recipe is close to the one I have used for over 35 yrs. If this one sounds good to you, but is lacking something, try this - Filling: 3 large sweet potatoes/yams, baked with skins on, not boiled, until tender 3/4 stick of unsalted butter, softened 2 large eggs, slightly beaten start with - 1 Tbls of brown sugar, do a taste test, if it is not sweet enough add a little bit more brn sugar, (maybe a teaspoon full), or to taste, beating well after each addition of brown sugar 1 tsp each, (or to taste) of the following: (we like ours a bit more spicey) ground cinnamon ground nutmeg ground cloves a pinch of salt 1 small can of evaporated milk, (I like Carnation), I usually do not use the whole can, but it does depend on the amount of potatoes you have. This mixture should be soupy but slightly thick. Topping: 1-3/4 cups of corn flakes I start with 1/4 cup (packed) brown sugar about 1 cup of chopped pecans about 1 cup of unsalted butter, melted depending on who's coming to dinner, I sometimes add about 1/2 cup or so, of raisins then follow the baking instructions

This is a great dish! The only thing I did differently, was to gradually add the sugar to the sweet potatoes to taste (I believe I did use less than the 6 Tbsp). I also used less butter for the topping. I would definately be careful if you double, triple, etc. the recipe...no way would I multiply the sugar and butter....just do it to taste.

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful recipe. I made it for a Thanksgiving party and everyone loved it. The topping is a definate must, I'd even like to sprinkle it onto some ice cream. The only thing I wasn't sure of was if I should crush the cornflakes and then measure out the amount I needed or measure out the amount I needed and then crush. I crushed first and it was great.

Much to my surprise, my family did not care for this. My husband kiddingly said that next time it might be better served with sprinkles on top (which my kids found hilarious). I had to agree, it was much too sweet for the roasted chicken that it was served alongside.

I have made this four Thanksgivings running - my husband's family loves it so much, I no longer have a choice. I do make a couple of changes (of course!) I bake the sweet potatoes instead of boiling, which makes them sweeter and yummier to me. I then cut the sugar in half and use brown sugar. (usually I make a double recipe, so I use 6 T brown sugar in the actual potato part.) Don't skimp on the topping!!! (Weird coming from me, since I hate pecans, so I wind up trying to get mine from the bottom of the dish!) Try it - you'll like it!

She is correct it is delicious and of course I am making it for Thanksgiving!

very good. lots of compliments. the only change i made to this recipe was to use a pastry cutter to mash the sweet potatoes (i prefer textured vs. pureed) thanks to the cook that mentioned to crush the cornflakes finely - i think this makes a big difference. a couple of my guests mentioned that they normally do not eat sweet potatoes but enjoyed the flavor of this dish. a great addition to the thanksgiving table. i served this twice, both times the dish was emptied!

This is my favorite sweet potato recipe. DO NOT listen to those who recommend leaving out the cornflakes. They don't know what they are talking about and it will ruin the recipe.

I made this dish last year for a Civil War dinner; it spilled over the side and had a slight smokey flavor. I heard people raving about the sweet potatoes, before I'd had a bite, and frankly I thought I'd ruined the dish.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and one of my guests said she'd have been thrilled to take a spoon straight to the casserole.

I loved it and would absolutely make it again.

No wonder people who don't like sweet potatoes rave about this dish. It tastes like more like pumpkin pie filling. Since I like the taste of sweet potatoes, I won't be making this again unless I put it in a pie shell. I cut the sugar in half and still found it a little too sweet.

There is a lot to be said in taking note of reviewers suggestions; they have been absolutely right for most of the recipies on this site. This recipe is not exception. Not everyone loves sweet potatoes, but it was liked by non lovers of the vegetable and loved greatly by the fans of the root! I made it in advance and it was perfect. Do not leave out the pumpkin spice, it was almost a desert! However, I almost knocked it out of my diabetic mom's hands! It was sweet and deadly and wonderful! Two thumbs up!

A great compliment to a holiday meal. There is enough butter and sugar to hold off any critics of sweet potatoes. It also added a unique flavor to a turkey dinner. I used canned potatoes was able to avoid many of the steps and only cooked it for 30 minutes. It turned out just great.

These ARE sensational sweet potatoes! Everyone loved them and thought the topping was delicious. I made them ahead of time in the morning, and I even made the topping about an hour before. I wound up putting the topping on it at first and then putting them in the oven, so I covered it for a while so the topping wouldn't burn. I also followed another reviewers advice and made half with this topping and half with marshmallows (for the kids, one, who has a nut allergy). I think this will be my standard sweet potato recipe from now on.

Made this last Thanksgiving and was a big hit, even with those who aren't real fond of sweet potatoes!

This dish had some good qualities as well as some flaws: It had a good flavor, and the topping was exciting with the crunchiness (I used Special K, some organic, crunchy cereal, and some granola), but the yams did seem to pale in comparison to the topping. I almost wish the yams had been cubed, and drizzled with a carmelized sauce, then had a topping, to retain the texture of the yam. It did resemble a pie, but left you wondering why it had no crust :} It was good with ice cream, actually ;}

I have made this recipe several of times,both for family and for dinner parties.It has always been a huge success!!I have even had a few people say they do not care for sweet potatoes,but once they tasted these they were amazed.They even had seconds.The only adjustment I made was being very generous in the ingredients for the topping.(I love the topping so much that I like it a little more of it on the top.)This is a sure pleaser!!!

I had to triple this recipe for a large group, so the amount of butter was phenomenol. I halved the butter and added an equal amount of unsweetened applesauce. You couldn't taste the apples and they were delicious with a little less fat. I would make them again the same way.

I made this recipe for Christmas - it was a big hit! Most of my guests were not fond of sweet potatoes but took second helpings. I would definitely make it again but next time with less topping.

I only used the topping from this recipe and used it with a different sweet potato recipe. I wasn't too impressed with the topping - it was mediocre at best at dinner - soggy and mushy on the leftovers the next day.

Very good recipe. I substituted pumpkin pie spice with mace, cinnamon, nutmeg, and I left out the salt.

Delicious! I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and got rave reviews from whole family. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I substituted with 1/2 ground cloves and 1/2 ground ginger. I also used walnuts instead of pecans.

I make this dish for the holiday season ever since I discovered it two years ago. Everyone likes it, even the picky eaters- the kids love the topping! It has become a tradition in my family, and I have referred several people to Epicurious to retrieve this recipe!

Excellent dish. A lot of butter however...my Wife was impressed with the taste, then I told her how much butter was in it. It still tastes great, but probably not good for the calorie counters...

This recipe will convert anyone who doesn't like sweet potato casseroles. My Mom first tried the recipe, and I've been making it ever since with rave reviews and requests for the recipe everytime I make it. Only downside is that there never seems to be enough to go around.

Made this recipe to accompany fruit stuffed pork roast. It was the perfect accompanyment. The rich crusty topping really makes this dish.
