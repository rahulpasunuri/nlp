Delicious! Crispy on the bottom from the butter, and the tea adds such a wonderful flavor. I used a loose leaf lychee tea, and it turned out great.

Being English myself, I know a good scone when I find one. This is it! These are SO good - really moist, with a nice crust. An idea to obtain more tea flavor: instead of half-and-half, use half whipping cream and half strongly brewed tea! The question is, why would you only make 4 of these? Double! Triple!

These were so easy and yummy. I wish I had doubled the recipe! I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and substituted raisins for the currants. I also used whole milk instead of the half & half. Basically, I wanted to use what I had on hand and it worked out great.

Nice and simple scones, with just the right amount of sweetness. I used half cornmeal which added a nice crunch to the scones. Would have liked slightly more tea flavor somehow...

I made 18 recipes to give as gifts for Christmas to my friends. I bought some beautiful panettoni loaf papers and moulded the scones in to them. They were wrapped in parchment paper and tied with ribbon. Each and every one of them was both beautiful and received excellent reviews from my friends - which is a testament to how easy they are to make, I think! You won't be disappointed.

Fabulous scone! I usually omit the currants, but this recipe works well with any additions. I made some with chocolate chips and vanilla added for the kids and the result was wonderful! So flaky!

Great! I wouldn't change a thing.

Very quick, easy and delicious. A little crispy outside and wonderfully moist inside, it makes the perfect amount for two people or to give as a small gift. I used raisins instead of currants and it was terrific. My first attempt at scones and I'd happily make them again.

These are so terrific. I've made them with dried cranberries and currants and they turn out great every time.

I had been buying my breakfast scones at local cafes here in New Orleans. Never again! This recipe is terrific, very easy, and produces a scone far better than those made locally.

VERY easy to make. Fast and satisfying. I guess I was expecting the tea to sort of plump up the currants, but there wasn't enough tea for that. They turned out just great anyway. My husband, who "doesn't like scones" enjoyed them too.

I have made these scones with both all-purpose flour and oat flour and both were fantastic. They dough never came out firm enough to slice into wedges, but I made drop scones and the same baking time was fine. They are also good without any fruit at all and with winter spices added.

This is a wonderful scone recipe. The scones have a nice texture, not too dry with just the right level of sweetness. I opted to replace the currants with dried apricots. Any dried fruit of choice would work fine.

Best scones I've ever made. I substituted dried cranberries for the currants and liked them much better.

Good recipe. Next time I will probably ease up on the currants but I will definitely be using this recipe at my upcoming tea party.

This is a delicious scone! My friends and I love it. I also added a pinch of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla extract for extra flavor.

I have tried many scone recipes and by far this is my favorite. The texture is perfect and they keep very well. This will be the recipe I make over and over again.

I've tried many scone recipes in search of the perfect scone, and this is it. The finished product is nicely crusty outside, light and flaky, not too dry inside. And the tea imparts a subtle flavor note through the currants. Don't know if I'll ever make another scone recipe again!

Very easy to make with items easily on hand. Dough was pasty but end result was delicious. Overall comment: Delicious and Easy
