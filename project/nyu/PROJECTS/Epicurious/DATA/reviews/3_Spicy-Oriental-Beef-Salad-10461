Oh and I shredded the lettuce, I thought it was a nicer mouth texture that way.

This is one of my staple salads. It is quick, easy to make and a hit with my husband!

It would probabley taste better on the leaves. I tried it with some whole wheat pasta and it was just ok.

It was pretty good. I'd probably suggest keeping the dressing separate, as I had a complaint about a "strange bite -- probably the Worcestershire." The coriander added an interesting flavor, but lettuce leaves that hold up well to be used as wraps a la fajitas are difficult to find.

This was really nice! I added a few more veg, because I didn't feel like a meat salad. I added half a red and half a green bell peppers and a handful of sugar snap peas! I'm looking forward to having the leftovers tossed in a leafy salad.

Why do you ppl even bother with these recipes? Just make regular spaghetti or a burger. Cumin is nothing like cayenne. They are totally unrelated. Its a salad, not a pasta sauce.

Clarification - increased "dressing" by 1/3. Leave meat in pan, drain if necessary. Add dressing and stir. Add noodles and heat. I prefer this served hot.

We love this dish. The flavors balance wonderfully - very yin/yang - typical of Thai or Vietnamese cuisine. Worcestershire is an interesting substitute for fish sauce which would normally be used. I increase the sauce by 1/3, use a combo of Worcest. and fish sauces, skip the salt and increase the cayanne to 1 tea (may be too much heat for some). I also add 2 (1.76 oz) bunches of soaked bean thread noodles to the meat near the end of cooking. The noodles will absorb the additional liquid in the pan. Finally, the choice of lettuce is important. Use a soft sweet lettuce such as Boston or butter. As the reviewer from Seattle said, the meat should be rolled in the leaves.

I added shitake mushrooms to the beef. It was also helped by some bottled dipping sauces.

Ground beef should never touch lettuce except on a very juicy burger or very spicy taco. This recipe was horrid.

Made this last night for dinner, and could only manage to eat 1/2 of it; a peanut butter sandwich was a much better choice! The flavors in this salad are too strong & compete with each other. Ground beef was not a great option for this; perhaps chicken could work, but I'm not planning to try this one again.

Definitely serves 3-4 as the meat dish of your main course! YUMMY. Served just with the lettuce - no rice or noodles and it was very good that way.

Some of you fellow reviewers miss the point of the dish...the lettuce leaves are used to scoop up the beef mixture which is then eaten as a "roll-up". So....serving over rice or noodles is unnecessary. Remember, adding brightly colored vegetables such as red bell peppers will make the meat look more appetizing. Good suggestions!!

Traditionally this dish is served with steamed sweet rice,(Sticky rice). It is very good when served that way.

I discovered at the last moment that I didn't have cayenne, so I substituted cumin. It was good, but before I'd make this again I'd have to decide what to serve it over (someone suggested pasta), because it wasn't a very appealing dish to look at, and it needed something to round it out--just ground beef doesn't do it...

As a salad a mound of chopped beef is unappetizing. I doubled the dressing and put it over pasta and it was quite good, light and different.

Very simple to make, and the end result is great! The dish is very fragrant, even before adding the scallions and cilantro, but the addition of cilantro really makes the dish. I wouldn't change anything, and it went very well over steamed rice.

Very easy and delicious. The flavors blend excellently, even for people who aren't crazy about cilantro.
