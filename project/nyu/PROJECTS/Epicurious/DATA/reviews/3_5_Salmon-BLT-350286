Quick & easy to make, and very delicious, too. Ok, so it wasn't a "healthy" version since I used brioche buns and regular mayo but thought it was a nice alternative to use the salmon.

Freshcope,hopefully you will see this review of your review as I realize a bit of time has passed since your last comment. A recipe is just a set of instructions that show how to make something. A recipe can be any set of instructions from the simplest dish to the most complicated; from simple syrup to a sandwich to spiced tea to Estouffade of Duckling,Braised Beef a la Mode Parisienne or Beef Wellington. If you feel that the recipes from Self or any other area are beneath you then I would suggest that you refrain from looking in those areas. Recipes don't have to be followed at all, a lot of people use them for ideas for a new dish of their own. Recipes from ages back were less detailed and served as a reminder of the ingredients and proportions for someone who already knew how to prepare the dish. Recipes today are usually more detailed no matter what the dish is because the recipe is a set of instructions that include the name of the dish, time it takes to prepare, necessary ingredients and their quantities,ordered list of preparation steps,type of equipment needed,and number of servings so that someone new to cooking (unskilled in your terms) will be able to prepare the dish on their own.Other cooks or chef's might use a recipe as written, change it to suit their needs or just as a guide. In food service a recipe is needed for consistency of preparation and cost control. As far as the uneducated that you refer to you must be speaking of yourself or maybe not, as even uneducated people have better manners than you. Bashing the author of a recipe is not necessary.

Freshcope, why are you so angry about this recipe and why do you feel the need to direct your anger at me? I read the comments to see if the recipe creates a good end product and also to see if anyone has taken the recipe and added some twist of their own. I don't understand why being mad at me proves anything.

I agree with sweet tea. I think this is a great idea for a sandwich and using fat free mayo is just a suggestion to cut down on calories. If she had used this recipe with turkey bacon would you be satisfied? And who makes up the rules for what is a recipe and what is not? All of the criticisms on this recipe don't seem to be about the taste of the end product at all. Isn't the taste of food the most important part?

who cares if it's low fat mayo or bacon or whatever? does that really matter? the point of the recipe really is the taste, and to me it came out delicious. and who cares if it's "just a sandwich"? i don't like having to make huge dinners every night, it's nice to make a simple and delicious sandwich. i really love this recipe, it combines two of my favorites: bacon and salmon!

i agree with freshcope, though i might have put it a bit less harshly. also, using fat-free mayo and four slices of bacon is like ordering a double cheeseburger with diet coke. it's ridiculous.

Fat-free mayo and 4 slices of bacon?

I thought of Cayenne pepper too, but I crave spice in something as simple as a sandwich so I added a dash of Chili powder to the mayo... this is my new favorite lunch!

I loved it as well. But instead of a pinch of cayenne in the mayo, I added a bit of wasabi paste,l which worked well.
