Yum. I also opted out of the tomato paste in the sauce, subbing some rice vinegar to brighten it up. I added baked tofu for some protein, and I also made a dipping sauce from lime juice, fish sauce, rice vinegar, and sugar.

Wow - what great flavor! This was my first try at spring rolls and I will be trying these again as well as making new twists on my own. I hope people read the comments. The paper towels are a disaster. Thank you to the reviewers who recommended parchment paper. You saved my spring rolls. I tried two w/ paper towels and I was so frustrated about how the stuck. I was on the verge of tears!

Delicious...however, I made one change the second time. I added some fresh squeezed lime juice to the peanut sauce - that (in my opinion) gave it that little zip and sparkle that I thought was missing.

Love the rolls and the sauce (minus the tomato paste). I use the sauce for lots of other things- over a cold veggie-noodle-almond salad is great. Any guesses on how long it would last in the fridge? I'd like to make a big batch and use it for a while.

I combined this recipe with Papaya Spring Rolls and used the sauce recipe + suggestions from Spicy Peanut Sauce. I love the bean thread noodles, ground peanuts and cabbage additions + the mango (not papaya) and herbs from the other recipe. Together, my spring rolls were fantastic this time around! For me, this is time consuming but worth it! Oh and used the common suggestions on the sauce such as the garlic chili sauce instead of the tomato paste and I used spinach instead of lettuce.

Light, refreshing, delicious, and beautiful to look at. Great anytime of year, in my opinion. I had no problems with my rice paper rounds tearing. Per another reviewer, I soaked them for only 15 sec. Using parchment paper instead of paper towels was another helpful tip because the rounds stuck to the paper towels. For the sauce, I left out the tomato paste (personal preference) and I also made the sauce "Street/Canada" recommended. Both were good but I would suggest going lighter on the amount of sauce per roll (no matter which sauce you make)so they don't overpower the delicate taste of the other ingredients.

Made this the other night. I found the dipping sauce a little heavy. Here is an alternative sauce that I learned in a cooking course in Cambodia. 2 cloves of garlic, 1 shallot, bit of sweet chili pepper, bit of chopped cilantro stems. Chop finely. Then fry the ingredients with tablespoon brown sugar, 1/4 cup of water. Bring to boil, simmer. Let cool. Add juice of one or two limes to taste.

Wow!!! I must confess that my rolls were fairly unattractive & I clearly need to practice my rolling technique, but the taste far exceeded my expectations! My 12yo son that avoids healthy food thought these were great too. All my subs were due to using what I had in the house & included chili oil for rpflakes, angel hair rice noodles for bean thread & green cabbage for Napa. Parchment paper for paper towels cuz I cant help thinking paper towels would stick to rice rounds. We will undoubtedly have these again & I may make the peanut sauce alone to go with some of my thai dishes. Major thumbs up!

I've made these several times with my 2.5 year old - we both love it! She enjoys soaking the rice paper and assembling the veggies on the roll (and nibbling noodles along the way). We've varied the ingredients by season and what's in the fridge and it always turns out yummy. I usually double the sauce recipe and we use it for dipping, another kid-pleaser.

These are awesome as written, and with my various experimentations...mango, pineapple, shrimp, etc. While the sauce is good inside the rolls, I would point out that it is nearly identical to the spicy peanut sauce recipe also on this site, which I have used as a dipping sauce for these instead, as well (doubling the red pepper and adding 1/4 cup cilantro at the end.) I would also add that if you get disturbed mid-recipe and need to quit, pouring the sauce over the remaining noodles with a little pineapple and some cooked shrimp, as well as the mint and basil thrown in is delicious.

I made this as a lettuce wrap for a super-quick supper. Delicious and so healthy. I used rice stick noodles, covered in boiling water for 5 minutes and they were fantastic. I'm glad there's enough left over to make more!

I love this recipe in the summer when it's too hot to cook. It's a little tricky working with the rice paper wrappers, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy. I use luke- warm water (about 100 degrees) and let the wrapper soak until just pliable (about 10-20 seconds). I also use parchment paper instead of paper towels.

I made these by the recipe and I couldn't be more pleased! Thomas, capsaicin is a very stable compound. Cooking chiles or their parts only intensifies the flavor of the rest of the flavors in the chile. It does nothing to the heat level. Sorry.

Brilliant! Used carrots, Daikon radish,red bell pepper, scallion, all the herbs, and some avocado. Make this!

I've made this twice as written with no deviations.It is a fine dish. The first time, I did make a mistake -- I did not add the hot pepper flakes to the sauce while it was cooking.I forgot it and added it after it was done cooking.Not cooking the hot pepper flakes increases the heat considerably. I personally loved it, but it was too much for my girlfriend. The second time I made it right, it was much milder and personally I liked it the other way. As far as calling it labor intensive..... that is a relative term and really depends on your experience in the kitchen and knifing skills. I didn't find it that time or labor intensive, and I chop everything with just my knife and skill. The one thing I will say I disagree with in the recipe is it tells you to put the rice paper on a paper towel. No -- the paper towel just sticks to it.I put the rice paper on parchment paper and assemble the roll on it and it works great.

delicious as a light dinner, lunch or appetizer. i didn't follow the recipe exactly...made my own peanut sauce(of relatively the same ingredients) and used the vegetables i had on hand instead of the noodles and cabbage (carrot, jicama, green beans and scallion). I also added some chicken i sliced thinly and poached in chicken broth for added protein. The herbs, however, are the real star...such a delicious and fresh flavor combination with the vegetables and peanut sauce!! i think you could use ANY fresh crunchy vegetable, whether the roll stays true to it's vietnamese roots or not!! this is truly a dish you can indulge in and not feel guilty about later!!

this recipe was really delicious- I added some shrimp to it as well and used the peanut sauce as a dipping sauce. yummy! after a little difficulty wrapping the first few, i got the hang of it and they turned out very nice. i stored the prepared rolls layered with parchment paper for a few hours before my guests came and cut them right before i served them.

This was super good! A little labor intensive but deffinately worth it. I used the peanut sauce as a dipping sauce and added shrimp. I would not advise wrapping rolls in wet paper towel as it all stuck to the rolls and I had to peel it off.

Don't let the prep intimidate you...these are fabulous! As suggested, use mandoline to slice/shred/chop two nights before you plan to serve and store in plastic baggies. Roll the night before and keep in airtight container or large plastic bag with layers of damp paper towels. Slice about 30 minutes before serving. I've kept them in the frig for as long as 3 days. At that time, the wrappers do get a little gummy, but they are still delicious. I found the easiest way to roll as follows: lay out one soaked wrapper, place a piece of red leaf lettuce on top, smear with peanut sauce, and then layer ingredients, the lettuce leaf will keep the vegetable pieces (esp. carrots) from poking out and piercing the wrapper. Works every time and no need to use two, which does overwhelm the flavors.

This was my first summer roll and I'm going to need some practice with the rice paper (sticky), but this was THE recipe. The peanut sauce was easy and turned out great. Larrys eyes got real wide and he was spooning more and more on (I used as a dip rather than putting inside the roll)...very cute. I also doubled the peanut butter in the sauce, and added shrimp to the roll. I was making a curry at the same time and when I grabbed the noodles to toss with vinegar and pepper, I accidently got yellow curry ALL OVER THEM, but this turned out to be a very flavorful and unplanned touch. Oh, and ketchup instead of tomato paste (we're poor).

This was an excellent light lunch on a hot summer day. I left out the mint and basil, but I'll add them when I make this again for a party. This would be an excellent appetizer for a summer party, especially if the crowd includes any vegetarians. I like the idea of tossing the carrots and lettuce in the sauce instead of spreading it. Seeing the brown sauce within the rice paper wasn't very pretty.

I've never been a huge fan of summer rolls, but the rave reviews made me decide to give this recipe a try. Loved the peanut sauce! I think one of the keys to the success of the rolls is the herb combo -- there's something magical in the mint, basil, cilantro mix. I will be experimenting with different ingredients (I added some marinated tofu and avocado to make them more of a main course and mango because it's in season here -- yum!). A mandolin is a must for this recipe as the prep is a bear. I left the peanut sauce on the side for dipping and found that the rolls actually improved overnight.

The peanut sauce is absolutely awesome just as is. I used it as a dipping sauce for halibut. I haven't tried the rolls yet but will tomorrow night.

This is a go to recipe for me now. Make it easy on yourself: double the peanut sauce and toss the cabbage, clantro, mint and basil in it (spreading is crazy - did it the first time... never again). Seems daunting but once you get the hang of rolling and tucking you'll whip right through them. I serve them slightly chilled (anything I can do ahead I do) with Mea Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce or extra peanut sauce. Also I should note that I've made it so often I've taken to adding shredded coconut to the peanut sauce (a happy accident of sorts - luckily it's very forgiving). Make it.

Peanut sauce is excellent - do not use store-bought. Rolls were not as difficult to work with as I expected. I had guests help and it was a lot of fun. Great crunchy, fresh flavors!

Easy and healthy! Skip the peanut sauce and buy an already prepared sweet chili sauce if you wish to save time. You can also substitute whatever you wish for the rolls- I have made them with celophane noodles, chicken, canned bamboo shoots, and carrots, but also made a quick snack with whatever veggies where around and just treated the rice paper as any other sandwich wrapper. Highly recommend as a quick, healthy snack.

I used this recipe for the peanut sauce only and paired it with chicken skewers. It is a great recipe but I doubled the peanut butter and nearly doubled the water to thin out the sauce. I recommend at leasst doubling this regardless of what you use it for. This is a great peanut sauce recipe.

This a great, healthy appetizer. You don't need to adhere to the recipe. Use whatever vegetables and fresh herbs that you have on hand, with the appropriate amount of cellophane noodles as your base. I serve them with soy or terriyaki sauce for dipping. Working with rice-paper wrappers takes a bit of practice, but once you've got the knack, it's not difficult at all. They can be assembled early in the day and wrapped well for serving later.

These are terrific and I make them often. The only thing I do differently is to keep the peanut sauce out for dipping instead of adding it when I roll them up. You can make them farther in advance this way, too.

Flavor-wise, these were great. I made them as stated, but I can imagine that they lend themselves to all kinds of great combinations. And, I loved that sauce, and imagine, like others stated, that it would make a great sauce for noodles. That said, the construction of these rolls is tedious. You should have everything prepped and ready to go. I'll definitely keep this in my repertoire, but I won't look forward to the work!

I needed a peanut sauce for chicken, and with about 1/3 cup peanut butter, some fresh ginger and no hoisin sauce, it was superb with cooked chicken over angel hair pasta. I could have added a bit of chicken broth to make it saucier. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Love these! I quadruple the peanut sauce recipe so that I'll have extra for dipping. It is also fun to vary the filling, adding a few halved shrimp or other types of vegetables. To roll without tearing (or needing two wrappers), don't soften the rice paper completely before starting. Soak it just long enough for it to become flexible; it will continue to soften as you work with it.

Impressive!! I made this recipe as written the first time then the second time I changed it up a little. I used coconut milk instead of water in the sauce. For the filling I used shredded chicken, carrots, bean sprouts, lettuce, basil & cilantro, rolled up part way and stuck a butterflied shrimp in there so that you could really see the shrimp thru the paper. Time consuming, yes but well worth the work. If all your ingredients are prepped and ready then the rolling goes pretty fast. I have made these the night before and they were still fine. If you leave them around too long the paper falls apart. I found the key to rolling success was only soak 1 wrapper at a time and not for more than 30 seconds. Also good with plum sauce.

These were great! I did was so suprised at how good they were, the filling all worked out well, and I love that the sauce was inside the roll, it is so much easier than having your guests have to dip, it can get really messy otherwise. I was having trouble with the rolls staying together, so i just used another sheet over my ripped rolls, and I do not think it had any effect whatsoever towards the flavors. My guests ate all of these so I do not think it made a difference. The sauce was awesome as well...

Rating: 3
do not use 2 wrappers! it completely overwhelms the filling. here's the secret to using 1 wrapper successfully: soak and squeeze out a paper towel and spread it on a plate. fill a pie pan or similar type of bowl with very hot water (i usually keep a kettle of hot water nearby to refresh occasionally) . dip the wrapper in the water for about 10 seconds. it should be slightly softened but still hard. the wrapper rapidly softens as you pile on the ingredients and will achieve perfect pliability by the time you are ready to roll! ripped wrappers are due to oversoaking the delicate rice paper.

Rating: 4
A friend and I love these...healthy pregnancy food! You can double the wrappers (and it's easier to roll if you do) but it tastes better with just one...two wrappers diminishes the flavors and dramatic presentation a bit. Try it with two to get the hang of it, then try switching to one. For the "can you make ahead" question: If you do not chop the herbs with a knife (tear or use whole leaf), they are okay the next day. If you cut mint with a knife, the mint will blacken. I had a stack leftover the next day, and my family didn't taste a difference. The only difference I noted: the wrappers are a little chewier. And yes, make at least 4 times the sauce. It's great on other things and keeps well.

These were great. I had to fiddle with the sauce since we keep a rather meagre pantry, but even with soy instead of hoisin and ketchup (shame, shame) instead of tomato paste, it worked beautifully. For filling variations, I've found that matchstick-size raw zucchini works really well, as does marinating the carrots in a splash each of rice vinegar, fish sauce, and water.

Gotta add my two cents to this too. We made this dish adding some leftovers in the fridge, regular cabbage, green onions, shredded chix breast. It was great on a HOT summer day. Very easy, no real cooking involved and we just nibbled on them all evening. Perfect little dish that allows for some experimentation

I wanted the flavors of the dish without all the work. So, I stir fried some tiger shrimp and let them chill. I made the peanut sauce. I used chunky peanut butter, because it's what I had. It worked fine. Also, if your peanut butter already contains sugar, you might want to add sugar to the sauce to taste. Third, I shaved the carrots, so they were thin, but not grated (this was for the sake of texture), and chopped the cabbage and herbs. (I omitted the lettuce and noodles.) Then, I mixed the shrimp and veggies and herbs with the sauce and served it over rice. You get all the flavors w/ half the work. (Although, if you were serving it to others the coolness factor of making the spring rolls will be worth the extra time.)

Great fresh taste! Make a few practice rolls before company shows up; it's worth wasting a few rice paper rounds to get the hang of it. The peanut sauce was fine, but its cooking time defeats the point of this quick, light dish--you'd do just as well to buy it. I skipped the cabbage, too and was quite happy with the result.

You have to love a recipe that works exactly as printed! Loved them, quite a hit. Low cal; certainly a better option than fried or baked pastry appetizers and great for vegans.

These were a real hit! You will absolutely need extra wrappers until you get the hang of it.

I also served a store-bought Thai sweet & sour spicy dipping sauce on the side.

Don't get the wide cellophane noodles - they're too slimy. I also used spring roll wraps, these could be the same as rice paper rounds. If they are, I found using 2-3 for one roll holds up better than only 1 sheet. Don't soak longer than 20 - 30 seconds, these sheets continue to get soft as you work with them.

Wow, these turned out just like the ones at my favorite Vietnamese restaurant! The peanut sauce was just right. I would double the recipe next time so there will be more for dipping. Test your rice paper before filling. Mine only had to be dipped briefly in water. Soaking for 30 seconds made it too soft to work with. The start to finish time given for this recipe was one hour. Amazingly enough, that is precisely how long it took, hand chopping and all.

I couldn't find rice paper wrappers so I used spring roll wrappers. They were only so-so; I think to eat them uncooked like this, rice paper is better.

Don't leave out the mint, cilantro and basil if you can help it, but any two of the three will still be very good!
