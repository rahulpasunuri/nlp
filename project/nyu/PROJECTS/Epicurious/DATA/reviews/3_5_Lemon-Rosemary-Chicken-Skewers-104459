great chicken marinade and very flavourful. Made the sauce with mayo and added plain yogurt which my family loved.

My family loves this recipe. My very picky 8 year old says this is his favorite chicken. I have simplified the recipe by eliminating the skewers, cutting the chicken into larger pieces and grilling it. The sauce with mayonnaise is wonderful but to save on calories, I skip the mayonnaise - the sauce is good on its own.

I marinated my skewers for about 18 hours, then grilled them. They were delicious and a HUGE hit at the party (first dish gone). I will definitely make these again. If you marinate them long enough, you don't need the sauce. I agree that the sauce recipe makes too much.

The whole family enjoyed this, including picky husband, teenager and 5 year old. Easy and tasty.

This has an impressive presentation but I found that the strips came too thin...the flavor was bland and overall it should have been much better. The mayo sauce was tasty...but makes way too much sauce. It's also very time consuming to thread skewers. I won't make this again.

They were good if a little bland. A little fiddly to make also. They did look very festive though because of the tomatoes and they were finished to the last one at a party I had.

Yummy! These are delish as-is, but if you're looking to change it up, switch out the rosemary for tarragon. See the Tarragon-Lime Chicken recipe on this site for ideas on amounts, but use skewers and mix the boiled-down marinade with mayo for a dip. My husband likes the tarragon-mayo dip enough that we make it separately from the chicken now, for use on sandwiches. Yum!

These skewers were not only easy to make, but full of flavor and presented very nice for our catered event. Definately a keeper!

Yummy appy! I did NOT boil down the marinade (I'm not sure how long salmonella takes to degrade...), I just made a dip with low fat mayo, low fat sour cream, lemon, rosemary, garlic etc. The chicken itself is awesome - we did ours on our grill.

I've made this twice now and always get asked for the recipe. Good flavor and very nice presentation. I always assemble and marinate the day before. I did reserve some marinade before hand to make the sauce. I've done it both ways and think it's fine either way.

I used some frozen tenders I found in the bottom of the freezer.Works OK. Reserve some marinade before marinating the chicken to use for the sauce (boiling reserved protein infused-chickeny marinade?..yuk) Meat must be grilled in my opinion as baking kinda makes them pale. We brushed sauce on some of the tenders and they disappeared inna flash. only 3 forks 'cuz of the used marinade issue.

I made these for a party, and they were absolutely delicious! I simply thawed frozen chicken tenders and marinated them for a few hours. I was afraid frozen chicken might not work well, but the skewers were really juicy and tender and the sauce delicate and tangy. Great springtime fare!

Awesome party food. Everyone gobbled these, adults and kids alike. Do not skip the sauce, and definitely try and marinate overnight.

I couldn't believe how simple and delicious this was. I followed the advice and grilled the chicken. That was actually faster and easier than baking. Otherwise, followed the recipe, and loved it. As did my guests. A definate keeper!

These were incredible. We made them for dinner using three boneless breasts (cut into strips and skewered), and half the ingredients for the marinade/sauce. Served with chard and brown rice. Mmmmmm.

I made these for a big cocktail party, and was very happy with the results. I marinated them overnight, so I didn't have much to do the day of the party. They looked pretty and festive, everyone liked them, and they didn't require plates or silverware. A hit!

Made this for a party and got very good responses on it. I actually used pre-cubed chicken that was packaged for shish kabobs so I had to cook it a little longer but it worked very well. Took the meat of the leftover skewers for chicken salad the next day

Love this as a fancy alternative to chicken wings.I suggest separate marinade to add to mayo even though it's cooked to be safe.

I halfed the amt of lemon juice and marinated it overnight and the chicken was too lemony for my taste. The dipping sauce compensated for the sourness though. Next time I won't marinate it for so long.

Rating: 2
I marinated the chicken for a lot longer than the recipe stated and it came out pretty tender but the flavors werent quite there. I would reccomend marinating over night and I also used limes instead of the lemons which gave it more of a tang.

I got this recipie about two years ago and have made it at least a dozen times, I've even done it with whole chicken thighs and once in residence at university. It is definately lemony but is the perfect summer finger food.

Rating: 4
This was AWSOME! I wouldn't change anything! It's OK of you let the marinade go longer, change the proportions for the dipping sauce, or add/substitute different herbs for the rosemary. It's a great dish to prepare for dinner or a party, can be served at room temperature or warm. Great summer or winter dish. Definitely a keeper!

I cut the recipe in half. I didn't have quite enough lemons to make 1/2 cup and I still found it way too lemony.

Rating: 4
I made a few alterations but this was VERY GOOD. Instead of making skewers, I made them into kebobs and omitted the cherry tomatos. In addition, I was out of mayo so I used sour cream and WOW, just the kick it needed. Made the sauce with 1/2 marinade and 1/2 sour cream. Either way you make it, I highly recommend this.

This recipe came out really well - the combination of the chicken with the sauce was great. Be sure to thinly slice the chicken breasts, otherwise you'll end up having to cook the chicken longer than 8 minutes. Overall, very flavorful.

This recipe was quick and easy and made with fresh whole ingredients. My guest couldn't stop raving about it. I served it with a nice Chardonnay, and it was extraordinary. I also served two version of the sauce, one with the light mayonaise and one without.

I made this with both chicken and shrimp. As good as it is with chicken, I think it's better with shrimp! Definitely serve with the sauce on the side for people to dip into - they can forego it if they want, but I find it adds immeasurably to the final result.

I have made this dish fifty times, if I have made it once. It is 100% fool-proof. I catered a wedding and had these as an appetizer. The guests loved them. If you are having a party, the recipe is cheap to make and the result is much more elegant and less messy than wings.

chicken was marinated for 8 hours. grilled on the bbq. was very moist and flavorfull. when making the mayo sauce added honey to taste. gave it a hint of sweentness. excellent.

Made this with chicken cutlets and grilled in a grill pan. Really delicious. I cut down the marinade by about 1/4 and it was still more than enough.

I made this dish for friends, and we all loved it! However, I did a few alterations. I used whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and grilled them. I put a heaping tablespoon of the mayo sauce on each breast, and topped it with some sliced cherry tomatoes. Would def. make again! Delish!

Delicious. We had it last night and want to have it again tonight! I cooked the chicken on a charcoal grill and didn't use the skewers at all, just dipped the meat into the mayo mix and ate them up and wanted more.

I recently made this for a cocktail party- I would recommend the chicken be cubed- easier for guests to eat if they are standing. WE also grilled this in advance and served it at room temp. It was great and looked really good that way. Very pretty dish!

Rating: 3
Very moist & tender. The marinade was simple, healthful, although not low in fat, and very "mediterranean-like". I used 2 cherry tomatoes at the end of each skewer. The tomatoes added the much-needed color to the chicken as well as a "tomatoey pow" which pairs well with mediterranean foods. I did experiment a little. Not with the recipe ingredients, however, but with cooking techniques. I baked half of the skewers in the oven and the other half on the grill. Both tasted great! However, the grilled chicken looked more appealing with the grill-marks, and therefore added to the whole experience of the meal. I served this dish as a meal for my husband and I to taste-test before a cocktail pary we are planning. I served the chicken skewers over lemon couscous. Delish. Will definitely use this recipe for my cocktail party-GRILLED. Oh, didn't bother with the sauce because several of my other food items for my upcoming party are mayo based. I don't think it really needs it anyway.

I made this recipe for a dinner party, minus the skewers. It was supposed to be an alternative selection for non-salmon eaters, but it ended up being the star of the main course. I prepared pounded, boneless, skinless breasts, marinated them overnight, and cooked them in the oven as recommended. Although they didn't look as good as they might have had I grilled them, I cannot remember ever receiving so many compliments on chicken. It was moist and flavorful, even though I didn't bother making the dipping sauce. I will save this one to use again!

Nice and flavorful. I marinated overnight and used 1/2 the recipe and 2.5 lbs. of chicken. Next time I will use the BBQ!

Rating: 4
I made this as a main course using whole cutlets and broiled the chicken for about 3 min. on each side (after baking) because it wasn't getting brown in the oven. I served it over bhasmati (jasmine) rice and it was unbelievable.

I took some liberties with this recipe. I cubed some rather thick chicken cutlets, picked up some more vegetables (onions, peppers, zuchini), and made them into kebabs. I made a little extra marinade and let the vegetables soak overnight in it as well. The result was incredibly flavorful and tender lemon-rosemary chicken kababs. I passed on adding the mayo and making the sauce, and I don't think I missed a thing...

I made this for a buffet and it was a hit. Excellent to be served hot or at room temperature. I cooked the skewers in batches to serve at different times. Great buffet choice!

I made this recipe for just two people, so i had to seriously reduce everything. And, I didn't put the chicken on skewers; I just baked the strips in a pan. In the end, I thought it had too much lemon juice, and because I made so little, there was not enough of the marinade to make both the sauce and cover the chicken in the reserved marinade, so I opted to just make the sauce. The chicken was marvelously moist and tender. I thought it was just a nice change from our usual chicken, but my little sister absolutely loved it! I'd make it again, if only to get it right!

My sisters and I prepared the whole buffet menu for Christmas 2001. Everything was a hit, but the chicken was voted the best. Even the kids ate them! They were so moist and flavorful. In the summer I might even try them on the grill.

This was a real winner! I don't think you can ruin this recipe as I was in a great hurry when I made it and added the mayo to the marinade...and it was still wonderful. I know I'll make it again and try to do it right next time.

I'm not rating this since I didn't do anything but use the marinade, but that part was fantastic. Then I grilled the skewers with veggies and sausage and served with hot sauce for those so inclined. Very good marinade.

We grilled these instead of baked them and didn't make the sauce. They were very good but I think the sauce would have added the extra flavor it needed. We also added extra tomatoes...I'll try this again with the sauce next time!

I made this Friday night for an outdoor concert and everyone loved it. The chicken was surprisingly tender--I probably marinated it at room temp a little longer than an hour (probably dangerous but we all survived) and cooked them a little less since they steeped in foil for an hour or so before we ate them. Good stuff!

Excellent flavor and relatively easy to prepare. I cut the chicken into larger strips and increased the cooking time appropriately, since I was using the dish as an alternative/addition to beef on a dinner buffet. Very well received and definitely an attractive dish on the table. Nobody seemed to be very interested in the mayo sauce, though. Not sure I would bother with that the next time.
