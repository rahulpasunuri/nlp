I love this spread. I make it every year for the Christmas holiday season. (Which the colors work perfectly for!) My guests always ask for the recipe!

Yikes! An unappealing color and unexceptional flavor. There's gotta be better sweet spreads than this one.

Made this for an office thing. Everyone raved. Followed recipe exactly except I used lemon thyme from my garden and it was just the right note. Only criticism is the odd color, but using the right serving pieces helped it have a more appealing presentation.

I modified this a bit to utlize what I had on hand. Instead of the sour cherries, I used a bag of Tropicana's dried tropical fruit. I simmered the fruit in melon liquor (smelled wonderful). I enjoyed the demo run and hope my guests will too.

I loved this spread. It always helps when I read other reviews so I can make some changes to a recipe. I put the cherries in the blender to chop them into small pieces so the cheese would spread easily. I left the thyme leaves out. Instead of adding hot peppers to the spread I put Carrs cracked pepper water biscuits out. My guests loved it. I used the left over on bagels. I will make it again.

Wonderful recipe and always a hit with my guests. I usually add a couple of teaspoons of minced jalapeños for some subtle spice - it's a great combination of flavors.

This was delicious! Everyone loved it on their bagels in the morning. Would also be good on a turkey sandwich w/purple onion, maybe some blue cheese on french bread?! YUM!

They loved this at work! I prepared it exactly as the recipe indicated with the addition of three chopped, seeded jalapenos which gave a nice heat following the sweet taste of cherries. Will make again and again.

Our party guests really enjoyed this spread. The tart-yet-sweet flavor was a nice complement to the other savory spreads and dips on our buffet table. After our first attempt, we reduced the dried cherries to 1/2 cup for a more "spreadable" spread.

I made this for my father's 50th birthday party and it was a big hit. I left out the pepper and thyme and increased the lime juice by quite a bit. I can't wait to make it again.

A worthwhile recipe. The flavors meld together nicely. For best results, consider deleting the thyme and pepper entirely and sharply limiting the salt.
