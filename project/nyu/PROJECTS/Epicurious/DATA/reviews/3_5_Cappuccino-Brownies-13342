Absolutely fabulous recipe. I've made it many times over the past 10 years. It won reserve champion at the county fair.

I have made this recipe on a regular basis for a catering company I worked for. I find it a little rich, but it is one of their most popular desserts and because they are rich, a little goes a long way. They are especially good for large groups... I noticed below that some one had problems with these. The brownies can fool you, don't overcook them thinking the recipe is wrong and they aren't cooked yet. Take them out when the directions say, they will seem soft but will firm up as they cool. Good luck with these!

I have been making these brownies since the recipe was first published in 1991, and everytime I have made them have gotten rave reviews. It is by far the best brownie recipe ever! These are not hard to make-just a little time-consuming. But they are definitely worth it! **Just make sure to cut the brownies into small pieces--this is one RICH desert!!**

My husband & I had high expectations for this recipe, but it failed miserably! The brownies took much longer to bake than indicated and then they dry and brick-hard. The cream cheese layer and glaze were uninspiring. Definitely going in the circular file! Sorry to those of you who like the brownies :(

These are rich and fantastic. I prefer a glaze made with 2 oz. unsweetened chocolate melted with 2 T. butter. These are best served cold.

This one is worth the effort. It's not really very difficult, it just takes a bit of time to let each layer cool before you can put the next one on top.

I don't mean to gush but this recipe is fabulous and making these brownies is easier than it sounds. Every time I've served them, there has never been so much as one crumb left!

Admittedly more time consuming than my usual one-bowl brownies, but these are very good! I made exactly as written, using Lindt excellence bittersweet (the only thing available at the local store--I usually use Scharffenberger to bake with). I definitely don't think that they're too rich! I'm not a big chocolate fan, but the addition of the espresso and cinnamon is wonderful, and the cream cheese is a perfect match. (I might try making this in a round pan and cut it into thin slices like a torte, for a slightly "dressed up" version.)

The brownie layer was delicious, but the frosting and glaze were overkill (and I'm a girl who *likes* overkill when it comes to her desserts). I'd make the brownie recipe again and omit the other layers.

I've made this frequently since published in 1991, most recently as the groom's cake at my son's wedding. As usual, they were a big hit! It is my standard for brownies.

I made these brownies when they were published in 1991 then lost the recipe. Am delighted to find it again because these are absolutely the best brownies I've ever eaten. I took them to an office party and people were fighting over them. Well worth the effort.

Like a previous reviewer, I had problems with the butter for the glaze seperating out on top of the glaze. It looked very unappealing, so I dusted the top with cocoa. Despite this minor problem, the brownies were a huge hit! I served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and lightly-sugared strawberries on the side to counter the richness of the brownies. I will definately make these again, however I will leave the butter out of the glaze.

This is my absolute favorite brownie recipe and probably one of my all-time favorite desserts. They take a little more time than your run-of-the-mill brownies, but they have a rich chocolate, cinnamon, and cream cheese taste that rivals even the most extravagant of tortes. Definitely use good quality chocolate for the recipe; I prefer Callebaut.

I have made these brownies several times and they are to die for! I have used instant coffee when I can't find instant espresso powder and they come out great. Perfect for all those holiday parties!

Very, very rich, "death by chocolate." I used only 2/3rds of the sugar listed and it was still too much. This recipe definitely gilds the lily.

I had a small fortune wrapped up in these brownies and wouldn't have minded if the taste lived up to the anticipation. They are good, but waay to rich. (I didn't think there was anything "too rich" for me!)

I'm not from Alberta (see previous review!)but still wasn't very impressed with this recipe. They are OK, but in my opinion not good enough to justify all the work, and I make a lot of brownies. On the other hand, the baked pasta and salad recipes that go with this dessert in that issue of Gourmet magazine are to die for. Both are in this web-site.

Everyone at my office loved these and asked for the recipe. They are not too difficult to make, and they are actually BETTER on the second day. I didn't have an electric mixer and made the cream cheese frosting by hand and it was fine. Overall, AMAZING!

I've been making these since the recipe came out in 1991 - I never fail to get requests. The key to keeping the layers separate is to chill completely after the cream cheese layer is spread. I sometimes omit some of this, as I like that layer to be a bit thinner - do it to taste. I then do the ganache layer at a later time, and then chill again completely before cutting with a very sharp knife. These keep for up to a week in the fridge, and freeze very well.

wow. i hate to say it but i was really disappointed. i am sure that these brownies taste good. i mean have enough chocolate, sugar and fat to something and it is hard to taste bad, right? but really i made these for a friend's party and they were a mess. the cream cheese frosting never really hardens and when you slice them with all the glaze on top the presentation is AWFUL. i was too embarrassed to take them -- i ate 1 brownie and threw them all out. i hate to be negative but the basic recipe was probably OK but really you should just get a "cheesecake brownie" recipe and just add the coffee idea into that. did i miss something?

These brownies are wicked! They were easy to make, while the brownies were in the oven I cleaned up and then made both the frosting and the glaze ready to finish off the brownies. They taste like something you would get at a nice cafe or bakery. I liked the way the cream cheese layer and the glaze layer weren't too thick - just the right amount so that these brownies weren't too filling (at least not for me!). I'll be making these babies again that's for sure.

This brownie recipe is "the" brownie recipe for adults! I made them and brought them to my office and they were a huge hit. Even people who professed not to be big chocolate fans found them over the top delicious. They are extremely rich so cu them small. Also, I took little creative license and added a caramel layer between the brownie layer and the cream cheese layer. Was I guilding the lily? Absoulutely! Did it work? Absoulutely! I let the caramel get a little darker than usual so that it had a slightly bitter edge which was perfect with the sweet cream cheese and the chocolate glaze. The only complaint I had was that upon refrigerating the brownies, the butter from the chocolate glaze rose to the top and congealed which caused a slightly cloudy looking top. It didn't affect the flavor or anyone's desire to eat them. Next time I'll use a glaze made with cream instead of butter. I've found they work better. I will make these again and again. I've already promised them to my office for christmas.

These are delicious brownies! I don't drink coffee or even eat things with coffee, but these are wonderful. I used Medaglia D'oro Instant Espresso Coffee - it worked really well & is easy to find in grocery stores. The different textures of the brownie make it even more delicious - I'll definately make these again! I

These are wickedly delicious. Even though the 3 part recipe seems daunting (at least it did to me), it is not too difficult to make and is well worth the effort. The mocha flavour is a great alternative to the traditional chocolate. The "brownie" part is rich, moist and dense, not caky like other brownie recipes I've tried. The slightly tangy/tarty cream cheese topping, helped to cut the sweetness of the brownie. I couldn't find instant espresso powder so I used regular instant coffee. It worked very well. These are best served cold because the cream cheese topping tends to soften when left at room temp. I will definitely make these again. They were a hit!!

Have not made the brownies yet, but had to note that I find it pretty curious that out of all the reviews the only three cooks who did not like them all hail from Alberta?! What's up with that?

These brownies were delicious! I really didn't think they were that much work, you just need to allow time to chill between the layers. I also made the first two layers one day and added the glaze the next. I did find they were hard to cut cleanly, because of the soft cream cheese layer even after being thoroughly chilled, my squares definitely were not as pretty as the ones shown in the September 2001 magazine. But the taste more than made up for it! The bitter chocolate, coffee and cinnamon are a great combination. I used Valrhona Noir Amer chocolate, which is their highest cocoa content chocolate (71%), you definitely want a bittersweet chocolate. A wonderful adult brownie!

Excellent and special! I double the cream cheese frosting and chocolate glaze recipes for a better taste. Freezes well. I also substitute General Foods International Coffee (Italian Cappuccino flavor) for the expresso powder. Bittersweet chocolate is too expensive. You can make it yourself by using 1 part unsweetened chocolate and 3 parts semisweet chocolate. I also melt chocolate in the microwave - much quicker!

These are well worth the trouble and always a crowd favorite. I usually make the first two steps, let it chill overnight, and then finish with the glaze the following morning. These definetly need to be cut into small portions as they are so rich.

This has become a stand-by - it always receives ravew reviews. Yes, it's more expensive, but it's great for special occasions and I think it's worth buying quality ingredients.

While the Brownies were of pretty good quality, I must say that they were quite expensive, and very time consuming, considering that the taste results were, in my opinion only average.
