One of my favorite recipes. I've made this multiple times and it always turns out great.

Love these! Have made them twice in two weeks. Based on other reviews and understanding Cevice, it is very important to undercook the shrimp before marinating (heavy boiling water for no more than 3 minutes with 15-20 count shrimp. The first time we ate them as apps. The second time we served as a first course plated over thinly sliced avacado. Both were fantastic.

The flavors to this dish are bright and refreshing. My guests and family loved it. I halved the recipe and still had some extra. I served it in bite size tortilla cups as an hors d'oeuvre. Will probably make again this weekend

My sister in law made this for a preconcert dinner. What a treat! It is so refreshing, especially on a warm evening.

Great recipe - i made thsi over teh weekend and halved the recipe. Also took me 30 minutes rather than 15 to reduce the sauce. yummy with tortillas

Rating: 4
Outstanding and very easy. I agree any fresh OJ will work. My reduction took closer to 30 minutes, but aside from that I followed the recipe as written and it was a major success as a starter. I made the recipe for a 6 person dinner party so had some leftover; it lost some of the crunch but was still luscious for lunch the next day.

This was extremely successful at a big family dinner. I loved it and pretty much followed the recipe faithfully. I guess I'll have to find substitutes for blood oranges next summer because was so refreshing, it seems perfect for summer.

I found this dish good but not great. My wife enjoyed it more. What I find interesting is that this really seems more of a summer dish in that it is a cold shrimp dish, yet blood oranges are a winter product in the States. Also, the blood oranges were a mess to work with. I will make this again, in the summer, for a picnic, using fresh-squeezed OJ.

The only problem with this dish, is that no one will ever forget it. It is so delicious, I've made it over and over. Everyone loves it!!!

I just found this recipe and already I've made it twice. It's delicious refreshing summer fare. I used lemons, oranges and a splash of pomegranate juice. I used the frozen seafood mix from Trader Joe's, calamari, shrimp and scallops. Fabulous!

I get rave reviews every time I make this, and other than the blood oranges (which can be ommited without the recipe suffering), it's not very much work. This is a real stunner of an appetizer!

This is a winter recipe, as blood oranges are available in January/February. Don't bother looking for them any other time of year. This recipe took too much work for the effort; it is good but not worth the time.

Despite much searching, I could not find blood oranges anywhere, so I used a mix of regular oranges and honey tangerines. Also, I used small salad shrimp, rather than chopping up large shrimp. Otherwise, I followed recipe exactly and it came out great. Beautiful to look at, and very fresh and bright tasting. I served this with pita chips and it was a big hit at the party. Will definitely do this again!

Great recipe. Couldn't find blood oranges so added a splash of cranberry juice for color. I substituted lime juice for some of the lemon. Also used siracha sauce. Everyone loved it and will definitely make it again.

I really liked this recipe. I used a blood orange, two tangerines, and a grapefruit for the blood orange juice because that what I had in the fridge and it was still great. Would add a little more crushed red pepper next time.

This is one of my favorite new appetizer dishes. I have yet to find somebody who doesn't like it. Blood Orange juice is best. I amped up the red chili by piping a line of Chinese Sriracha on the rim of the plate.

This was the hit of the seafood extravaganza we attended last night. I was short on orange juice, so used one ruby red grapefruit and six clementines to come up to three cups, and the flavor was complex and bright.

I agree with everyone, this recipe is excellent - made it 4 times. But I also think that using blood orange juice is much better than regular. If you must use regular try adding some pomegranate molasses - will help the flavor a lot. Regular juice is too bland. And always use fresh.

This dish was amazing. I was not able to get blood oranges at the time I made it, but fresh squeezed orange juice worked just fine. I entered it as a side dish in my company's chili cook-off and took first place! Great recipe!

I loved this dish but my guests were just so-so with it. I do not think the blood oranges give it enough of a different taste or color to warrant the trips I had to make to find them. I will make this again but probably not for a dinner party.

Fantastic! I am a big fan of ceviche and this is a great twist with the blood oranges. A huge hit with all of our friends.

Excellent, very easy to prepare and quick! Makes a great presentation in martini glasses. I couldn't find blood orange juice so I used fresh oranges, squeezed them myself and it was fine.

This seems very healthy and flavorful. I've made it three times, and always get requests for the recipe. The chopping takes a little while, but it is so nice to have a yummy appetizer that can be prepared in advance.

Delicious and very easy to make. I bought cooked shrimp so only had chopping and mixing to do. The marinade practically makes itself. I am surprised to see this in January, it should be in an August issue. This will be a great addition to a summer party served with chips salsa style.
