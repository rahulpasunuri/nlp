these were ok. I've cooked it twice but not sure I'll make them again.

We had these last night and thought they were really good. We will definitely have these again.

Skipped on the topping and bread as well and instead on a bed of greens with a mild cauliflower puree. The tamarind glaze is fantastic!

The burgers and glaze were superb, but I thought the buns, lettuce, tomato and onion drowned out the burgers and glaze. My solution: Serve them without those accompaniments, and top them each with a slice of fresh, ripe mango, instead. Great combination!

Delicious. The tamarind sauce made the difference for me. I did end up fiddling with it a bit - adding a bit more honey, some brown sugar, and a bit of ground cayenne.

Pretty delicious, but still a turkey burger.

i went heavy on the ginger and added some sriracha to the burger mix and these were awesome! i am a personal chef and this is one of the most requested recipes from all of my clients- i serve it with maple baked beans, spicy sweet potato salad and refreshing thai salad style cucumbers- we love these!

The turkey recipe is great. Usually my husband grills but he wasn't home so I tackled it myself. Used my thermometer and the patties were moist, flavorable, and delicious. I went light on the ginger because it just seemed odd to me but it was barely detectable. The onions, mayo, and jalapeno made it for me. The tamarind glaze....it was ok. Next time I think I'd like to try some kind of spread instead (not sure the burger even needs it) if anyone has any suggestions.

A huge fave- have made it several times.

Did not like this burger - the tamarind glaze was acidic and did not work well.

Usually not a turkey burger fan, but this is a keeper.

This is the best turkey burger ever! Very moist and flavorful. A good substitute for the tamarind is half steak sauce and half worcestershire (both have tamarind as an ingredient). This is definitely worth the effort!

The ginger and scallion made these burgers fabulous. The idea of the tamarind sauce was better than the execution....the flavor never seemed quite right. Would definitely make the burgers again.

This was a suprisingly great dish, the effect of the glaze completely unexpected. My wife doesn't eat red meat, and was delighted.
