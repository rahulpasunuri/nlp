Just ok; was surprised it wasn't better. Wouldn't make it again. I usually like to make my reviews funny, but that's how uninspiring this dish was. No room for comedy. ;-)

This was very tastey and very easy to make!

Not only was the presentation lacking since the end result was a strange brownish-gray color, but the flavor was not that exciting. It was good enough for a quick week night pasta dish but I would never serve it for guests. I probably won't make this again.

I am all for sour foods, but this dish was so sour and bitter me and my boyfriend couldn't eat more than a few bites. There are too many sour ingredients and nothing to offset it.

This is a pantry staple in my house. Everything but the sour cream is usually on hand. It gets thumbs up everytime from the peanut gallery.

I cooked some garlic (1-2 cloves) in olive oil, omitted the sour cream, and used sweet sherry the second time I made it. Less fat, but still all of the flavor. The garlic is a must.

Not bad with a few variations: - Add/saute onion and fresh garlic, then add artichoke hearts (in water...marinated are usually too tart). - Add about 2 tbs. pesto sauce to the mix, too. - I used slivered almonds (toasting in an oven on 350 for 10 minutes works the best--toasts more evenly and less work). Walnuts can be too strong...pecans might work, too. - I used a decent left-over red wine...like it's flavor better with artichoke...more body. - Prefer bow-tie pasta or penne, etc. for this type of "mixed" dish...easier to mix, handle, eat, etc. Other than all that, it was fine!

Toasting the walnuts really makes this recipe stand out. It gives a wonderful nutty flavor and aroma. I used frozen artichoke hearts which worked very well.

I didn't have sundried tomatoes, so used a dollop of store-bought sundried tomato pesto, so things might have tasted better if I had actually followed the recipe. As it was, everything was luke-warm and drab.

its quick and ease and its a hit every time

Bleh. The artichoke marinade gave this a strange vinegar taste, and I found the dish too oily from the sun-dried tomatoes. To top it off, the sauce turned gray for some reason so we had gray pasta with sun-dried tomatoes. There are too many good pasta dishes out there to attempt this one again.

Yummy and different - not your everyday pasta dish but very easy & quick to make. Walnuts aren't essential though

My husband and I agreed, that this is a good dish we both would enjoy again. I added sauteed shrimp, and I didn't have white wine on hand so I used sherry. Yummy and easy!! PS: we both felt the walnuts were not essential

this dish was very easy to make, but overall flavor was so so. I wouldn't make it again, because there are sooooooo many other quick dishes to try!!! If I did make it again, I wouldn't use as many walnuts as the recipe called for.

Very easy and with ingredients that can be bought way in advance.
