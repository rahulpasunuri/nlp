I love chocolate, mocha, and almonds, but this just didn't do it for me. The recipe requires lots of effort and dirty bowls for a so-so result. It's WAY too intensely sweet.

macaroon [mak-uh-ROON] A small cookie classically made of almond paste or ground almonds (or both) mixed with sugar and egg whites. Almond macaroons can be chewy, crunchy or a combined texture with the outside crisp and the inside chewy. There is also a coconut macaroon, which substitutes coconut for the almonds. Macaroons can be flavored with various ingredients such as chocolate, maraschino cherries or orange peel.

Wonderful....but if it is called a macaroon tart..then where is the coconut?

Beautiful presentation. Incredibly rich. The only problem with this, is cutting it. Use a sharp knife and rinse between slices with hot water. Everyone was crazy about it.

This is a very rich Tarte, very smooth texture, which match perfectly with the almond crust, I also accompanied this dessert with passion fruit sauce to get mix of flavors, one of the favorites at home.
