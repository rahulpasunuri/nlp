I have to agree with the prior comment that this seems like an outdated approach. I have broiled lobster before by splitting it down the middle pouring in minced garlic and melted butter. It was delicious.

Frankly, there is not much point in broiling a "closed shell" lobster. The meat needs to be exposed to seasonings or basting, simple or complex. I suggest plunging lobster in boiling court bouillon (white wine or beer, water, herbs du jour, salt), remove from heat and let steep for 5-8 minutes per pound. Remove, split open tail and finish, with glaze/suace/rub under the broiler or on the grill. Sounds like a very dated approach...

IT WAS GRATE.
