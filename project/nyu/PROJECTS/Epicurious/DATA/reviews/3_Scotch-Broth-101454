What the heck kind of recipe is this? I have had Scotch Broth that my mother made, and it was delicious. This recipe is an insult to food lovers! It should be removed!!

Super easy recipe and a great way to use up a leftover leg of lamb. I added a can of condensed beef broth to add a bit of oomph to the soup base. One question: the color of the finished product is a bit yellow, a little off-putting. Is that due to the 5 carrots? Any recommendations for how to get it a darker, richer, brown?

My husband and I love this recipe! I am a "scotch broth" lover...and this is a VERY good recipe. Whenever we have a leg of lamb, the next day...I am making scotch broth...it's a great way to use the bone with so much meat left on it....it's terrific!!

If the contributor hates Scotch Broth, why foist a recipe off on us?! First of all, you need turnips (not a lot) and you need broth, not water to make it rich.

We love Scotch Broth and I've made it for years, but using either beef or chicken broth instead of just plain water. I use a couple of meaty lamb shanks in lieu of the cracked bone and they do the job very well.
