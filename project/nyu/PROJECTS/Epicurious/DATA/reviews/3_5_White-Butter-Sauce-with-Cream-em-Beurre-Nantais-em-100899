This is a really nice sauce. I was a little intimidated by so much acid, but the sauce rounds out nicely. I didn't have shallots so I used 1/2 tablespoon of minced sweet onion. I also thought it needed a little something, so I added about 3 tbsp. of grated parmesan cheese. Tossed with with hot noodles and it was a huge hit.

Really good. Served it with fresh grilled perch. I want to try it with steak too. Need something but I can figure out what.

I thought I would have problems with all the butter and the sauce not staying together, but it was perfect! I put it over asparagus wrapped in crepes. It was a crowd pleaser.
