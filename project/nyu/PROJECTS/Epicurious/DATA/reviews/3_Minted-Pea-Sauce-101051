mUch better and easier: cook and puree the peas and add mint jelly to taste.

quite a disappointment after the rave reviews below. i regret stripping my poor mint plants bare for a sauce that came out tasting like mushy peas. where did the mint flavor go? admittedly, i did a simpler roast lamb breast- not the recipe that this sauce is designed to go with. still, i'd advise those wanting discernable mint flavor to look elsewhere.

This is a delicious accompaniment to the rack of lamb.a

Delicious and easy to make. One of those recipes you can "dress up" or "go casual". Good friends made this with the rack of lamb for us when the recipe was first published. It was so incredibly delicious, we still talk about it years later. I used it on rack of lamb last month for a relative's big birthday. Then last week, we found it just as delicious and less expensive on filet mignon; I used leftover mint pea sauce on pasta the next night.
