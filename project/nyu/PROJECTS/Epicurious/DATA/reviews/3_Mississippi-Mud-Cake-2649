I did need to bake a bit longer than called for as well, but didn't find it dry at all, only after a day or two, but we're all still eating it! There is so much frosting and marshmallows that it doesn't really matter, plus it's really tasty. I put the marshmallows on earlier so that they got sort of carmely like smores which we thought was really nice. You really need pans with high sides. I didn't use high sided pans and lost some of the marshmallows, but will make again and my guests loved it and asked for the recipe!

This cake looks good but needs work. The cake came out incredibly dry and needed to bake for twice as long as the recipe called for. The marshmallows and pecans are a good addition to a chocolate cake, and the frosting recipe is nice. Despite the dryness, this cake was a big hit when I brought it to a party (which I almost didn't do because I felt it was too dry). Next time I will make this with my favorite, extra-moist devil's food cake recipe.

This cake is nothing special. The only thing I can recommend for it is that it was a fun cooking project for my daughter and me. Anything that combines chocolate and marshmallows and nuts has to end up fun. But the taste is simply okay. I ate it; my family ate it. And we gave away the rest to other people. The cake was very dry and crumbly. It didn't taste very chocolately. The marshmallows weren't gooey, because they are cooled before the cake is served. So, they ended up being stringy and clumpy. Pretty much the only part of the cake I enjoyed was the frosting, but it's too sweet to even make a dessert out of only eating the frosting. In all, because it presents as a lumpy, marshmallowy, nutty chocolate cake, it looked like a cake that a child would make. And since one did, and then gave it to her grandfather for his birthday, it ended up being appropriate.

This is delicious! My cake turns out great every time. I have made this 4-5 times. I bake it in a jelly roll pan. I use a whole bag of mini marshmallows over the cake and it is the perfect amount. I follow the recipe almost exactly except I do not refrigerate the frosting. I let it cool slightly to room temp. or slightly warmer and just pour it over the warm cake, more like a glaze. I have had good luck with this recipe and rave reviews every time I make it. It is great for a big crowd.

This cake tasted good but it smelled horrible baking. My family liked it, but I thought it was too rich.

the cake was dense and dry (i may have overcooked)it had a very nice appearance but it wasn't "spectacular".....i made it more for my own personal curiousity. the guests liked the cake, they ate about half of it. but i will not make again.

This is my all time favourite birthday cake recipe and have made it to huge success every time my family has a special occasion. I prefer it without the marshmallows - and if you can't find corn syrup, Lyle's golden syrup is a good substitute. I would also use more pecans than the recipe suggests, both on top of the cake and in the middle layer.

The flavor was very good but I found the cake to be a bit too dry and too much chocolate. I made it again, using cake flour and cocoa powder. Also, I made the frosting with 2 sticks butter, 1/2 cup cocoa - box 10X sugar, 1/2 c whipping cream, teaspoon of vanilla, added the nuts (totasted) and spread it over the marshmallows while the cake was still hot. I baked it in an oblong pan. It was then a big hit with my tasting crowd. Baked cake 300 degrees 35-40 min.
