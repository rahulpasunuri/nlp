This recipe was a disappointmnet for me considering the reviews. I took the advice of others and used rum, brown sugar and marinated the meat but like another reviewer, I found the sauce too salty even though I used sodium reduced soya sauce. With so much soya sauce everything is the same color. What I enjoy most about a stirfry is seeing all the differrent colors of the veggies and this was not even appetizing to look at.

Great recipe. I substitute the Scotch for Rum, sugar for Brown Sugar, added Shitake Mushroons and didn't put the red pepper flakes.

Something different from the traditional stir-fry recipes. No need for the Scotch but extra red pepper flakes would pump up the flavor. I think I will try marinating the beef in a little of the sauce (minus the cornstarch) next time.

The flavor was delicious, however, I left out the scotch. My family doesn't like the flavor.

Wow, salty or what! I used a low-sodium beef broth and added no extra salt, but it was WAY too salty to be pleasant. I will try it again using only 1 Tbls of Soya Sauce, I think. Thanks for the tip to cut down the amount of Penne. I used 2/3 of a pound and the ratio of beef, pepper and penne was just right

Great recipe but I agree with another reviewer that the pasta makes it really heavy, though I enjoyed eating the penne with the sauce and steak....maybe cut down on the amount of pasta?

great recipe! Lots of creative possibilities here! Had no Scotch, so used vermouth. Mixed in sun-dried tomatoes and freshly grated horseradish at the end.

This was an awesome and tasty dish. (Was even better the next day for lunch) I used normal rum instead of the scotch and added 1 TBS of brown sugar to the corn starch mixture. Next time I make it I will increase the amount of beef needed to 1 and 1/2 pounds total. Also, make sur eyou don't add the entire one pound of penne. Add it gradually. I used just shy of the full one pound box. Will make again! My son was licking his plate.

Love, love, love this recipe! I followed another reader's advice and used brown sugar, 10 scallions, and rum rather than the scotch. We also used about 2X the ginger and garlic and it came out great. I like strong, spicy flavour so try it like it is before you double the ginger and the garlic! It turned out great

I used more ginger & garlic than called for & still found this dish somewhat bland. I think the problem is too much sauce. Next time I'll try using less broth so the flavors will be more concentrated.

This was great! Next time I will try it on rice as opposed to the penne to keep it in the asian food realm. The penne was good as it captured the sauce really well but made the dish heavier than it needed to be. Leftovers heated well in the microwave.

This recipe is easy to make and very flavorful. We've made this recipe several times, always with great results. We served it to lunch guests recently and made one minor change: substitute one of the red bell peppers with an orange bell pepper - it adds a little extra color and visual appeal. Most recently, we served it with sunomono (cucumber salad) with a few slivers of both colored peppers in the salad - the ingredients of the salad (sesame oil, rice vinegar, sugar, cukes) were complementary to the main dish. Also, I've made this dish with regular Penne pasta and with Penne rigate (the penne with ridges) and would suggest the latter.

When I read the reviews of this I was concerned but tried it anyway making the following changes: I used 1T of Brown Sugar, and instead of Scotch, I used 2T Myers Dark Rum, 4 Cloves Garlic, and 10 scallions, and forgot the Red Pepper altogether the flavor of the fresh ginger gave it just the right bite. I am a Personal Chef and my customer just loved it! Make it this way and you will have a 4 fork rating!

this dish was extremly flavoursome, it went down well with friends who joined me in eating it, but i had some complaints abot there being too much pepper flakes in it. next time i think i wil leave out the hot pepper and use a dash of tabasco sauce, other than that a fine meal in itself.

The red peppers did not sit well with my family. The pasta took on a brownish color that was not very appetizing. The flavor was good, however. You have to love red peppers for this one.

This was an excellent dish that combines several tastes to create a yummy meal. good as left-overs too. If you have a sensative palate, leave out the red pepper flakes.

Delicious, spicey and tasty, however first time I made this, I used the penne and it just doesn't suit the flavour of the beef, so I substituted asian noodles it was really good.
