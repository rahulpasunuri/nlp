For a perfect crust, butter the tart pan as directed, then cover with a disk of wax or parchment paper. Then, spray lightly with baker's pan spray with flour (I used Baker's Joy) and your crust will pop right out, even without the help of a knife.

Eh. I can see why this hasn't been rated many times! The crust was okay; much prefer a traditional macaroon anyway. The filling was okay as well, but not interesting, even with the addition of the rum. This is one of the few dessert recipes I've used on this site that I haven't been impressed with. If you have coconut, just make macaroons!

I omitted the raspberry sauce, as it just doesn't seem to go with the coconut flavouring. The results were nevertheless mouth-watering and everyone loved it. The only complaint is that the crust stuck to the plate like crazy, but that can be avoided by buttering the dish. Next time I plan on making bars.

I totally agree with another reviewer about waiting for the dark chocolate mixture to cool to the same consistency as the white before putting them in the crust - I had to chill it for at least half an hour! Very, very worth making. That crust is a little salty.

I made this recipe for a dinner party. This very rich dessert was a big hit eventhough everyone was stuffed. I added two rows of fresh raspberries around the perimeter and piped a bit of fresh whipped cream. I will make this again and use the crust for a summer key lime tart recipe.

Each time I make this, people ask me for the recipe! Some modifications I make: double the coconut for the macaroon shell, omit the liquor for the filling. I've made this with chocolate chips (semi-sweet) and bakers chocolate (semi-sweet). Refrig. until completely chilled.

A very sweet and rich dessert. A little heavy on the dark chocolate, it's best served a little cooler than room temp. The raspberry sauce could be a little thicker for my taste.

I have made this tart numerous times since the recipe first appeared in Gourmet and it always receives rave reviews, particularly at the holidays. Although it is not stated in the recipe, drawing a knife in paralell lines through the filling while still warm creates a beautiful marbelized pattern on top

This is a beautiful pie. But one word of warning. The dark chocolate portion needs to cool down and thicken for a significant period of time. I followed the directions exactly the first time I made this dessert, and the dark chocolate ran all over the white. It's also VERY rich, so a tiny slice with some fresh raspberries is plenty.
