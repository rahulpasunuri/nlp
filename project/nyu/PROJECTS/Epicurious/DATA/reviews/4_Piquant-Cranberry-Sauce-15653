An interesting twist on a traditional sauce - I cut the sugar in half so it had more of a savory taste.

Best cranberry sauce ever. I do add just slightly more mustard, otherwise the recipe is perfect. Great on sandwiches the next day as well. This is our new Thanksgving staple.

This is fantastic. I have made it every year since '98. One exception is that I make it with rosemary. I like the fresh taste of rosemary. I may one day try it with sage.

Fantastic sauce. This was a hit with adults and even a few of the kids. It's on my permanent list!

Loved the simplicity of this recipe and it's just different enough from other cranberry sauce standards to be a standout. It's my new favorite.

This was a surprise hit. The thyme is a vibrant presence, the mustard a more subtle one. Definitely a keeper.

I have been making this cranberry sauce every year since 1998...it wouldn't be Thanksgiving without it!

This is my 7th year making this cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving! I think I will double the recipe for leftover sandwiches this year as there is never an ounce left. Hint: Garnish with fresh thyme to add a flair to your presentation.

Of the trio of sauces I took along to a friend's Thanksgiving feast, this was the biggest hit. Wonderful mix of flavours (used about 1/4 c less sugar, we like the wang of cranberries). I had to make a second batch - the first disappeared in a series of taste tests before Thanksgiving Day.

This is the third year I will be making this sauce. So quick to make and delicious! Happy Thanksgiving!

Absolutely wonderful cranberry sauce. I have made it twice, and it has knocked our usual family cranberry sauce right off the list permanently. Use fresh thyme--well worth it.

This was quick and delicious - definitely more interesting than the normal cranberry sauce, and fantastic on turkey sandwiches.

Easy, quick, elegant, delicious. I've been making this for six years, but I forgot to bring the recipe with me while travelling. Hooray for epicurious.com!

I had never made cranberry sauce before and one Thanksgiving I was asked to bring it and had no idea what to do. I tried this one and it was a huge hit! Moreover, it continues to be a hit year after year when I bring it to various dinner gatherings.

This will be the 3rd year in a row that I'm making this cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving. I love that it's not sweet, so many cranberry sauces ruin the tartness by adding too much sugar. Absolutely divine.

Made this last Thanksgiving and am planning to do it again! I've never liked cranberry salad--too sweet, glorified jell-o. But this recipe has such a nice flavor and goes better with food. It's very easy to make--plus it's fun to watch the cranberries pop!

Great recipe. Close to the traditional sauce but not quite as sweet. Everyone enjoyed it.

This stuff is GREAT! My friends and family request it specifically. If I'd had any idea how easy it was to make cranberry sauce this good from scratch, I would never have bought the canned stuff when the fresh berries were available.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and am looking forward to making it again this year. Home-made cranberry sauce is always delicious, but I thought this recipe was especially nice. Tastes great the next day, too!

Extremely easy and delicious. Just enough different from the usual cranberry sauces to attract high praise from my guests.
