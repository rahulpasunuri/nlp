Made this with vanilla bean ice cream for a fancy and pretty creamsicle. It was a hit with big time foodies. I used more clementines and doubled recipe. Rose glee is super yummy.

The gelee makes this dessert very festive. Neat idea. As for the texture of the sorbet, I suggest that you include a tablespoon or so of vodka or grain alcohol in the sorbet recipe; the alcohol prevents the sorbet from freezing so solidly and creates a smoother texture. I use this trick for all my sorbet recipes.

Nice refreshing taste of summer in the middle of winter and a great way to use up all those extra clementines. Agree with with previous reviewers that it takes a lot more than 7 clementines and the texture isn't that great coming out of the freezer, but I just let is sit out until it softens up a bit and it's just wonderful.

I chose this recipe because I adore clementines, but was dissapointed. The flavor was nice, but the texture was terrible. It was dry and crumbly coming out of the ice cream maker. Then, after it "hardened" in the freezer, I could not scoop it out and had to scrape it off the chunk with a spoon. If I were to make it again, I would take it out 15-30 minutes early and run it in the food processor for a while. On the other hand, I would probably just try a different recipe. I may have done something wrong, but it was a simple recipe...

Christmas dinner, between courses....raised my Mother-in-law's eyebrows; "Ice cream in the middle of dinner". But she tried it... loved it... and took home the leftovers! It reminded her of Lemon Ice she used to get in Brooklyn. I am trying the recipe with lemons to see if it gets the same reaction!

Yum! I only made the sorbet, which was very quick and absolutely delicious. I found that I needed twice the number of clementines, though, and that it didn't need that much extra sugar. I suppose that depends on the sweetness of your fruit. Next time I might experiment with omitting the sugar entirely or cutting it down to just a tablespoon or two.

I tried just the gelee as an intermezzo course and served it in small liquer glasses with demitasse spoons My guests thought it was the greatest.

This dessert was easy to make and spectacular to eat. I served this after a very heavy winter dinner party and it was a very large success. Each couple asked for the recipe. It is light and very refreshing. I am making it again tonight!
