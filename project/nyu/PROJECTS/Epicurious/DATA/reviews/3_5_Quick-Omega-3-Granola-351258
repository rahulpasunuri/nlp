Fabulous granola, and my go-to recipe for granola. I add extra walnuts and sub brown sugar Splenda for all the brown sugar to cut sugar quantity. I make this weekly!

This is the best granola I have ever tasted. I add almonds, dried cherries and dried cranberries. I also sprinkle with cinnamon before the first bake. Also, I bake at 325 instead of 350 and watch it so it doesn't burn.

Fabulous granola.....and I've been baking my own for nearly 20 years. This is my very favorite. Watch it carefully, especially if you use pans with black exterior! The end product is much darker than the pasty grocery store brands. Give this one a chance....

This recipe is incredible. I work with some folks who are health nuts, and not only were the health nuts asking for this recipe after I borought it to work, but most everyone was. It is warm tasting from the oven time, and just sweet enough. Perfect

I love this recipe. I grate a large piece of fresh ginger into the recipe. I eat it every morning with yogurt and whatever fruit I have around.

This granola was absolutely fantastic - crispy and sweet! Thanks to those of you who warned about the time. I baked for 7, 7 and then 8 after adding the honey and it was perfect. This would be great for a hostess gift or as part of a homey brunch.

This burned to a crisp. I had gone downstairs to fold a load of laundry, and keeping one eye on the clock, came back up with minutes to spare. Still, it was too late and I ended up bitterly scraping the mess into the trash. A waste of perfectly good ingredients. Still, I think that the recipe has potential so I will try again, hovering over the oven so that I can adjust cooking time and make note of it.

Very tasty. I compiled the nutrition info for this dish using data from SparkPeople.com. Except for substituting peanut oil for walnut oil (because I had some in the cupboard), I made it just as the recipe describes. http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tUuYTiyk_Z8LqWFQYaWGAyw&output=html

This is a great recipe! I cooked it for the full time and it was toasted to perfection. Next time I will try it with almonds and dried blueberries.

This called to be cooked way too long. After the 1st 15 minutes, mine was starting to be a bit crispy so I reduced the next cooking time to 10 minutes. By then it was unedible. Had to throw it out. Next time I'll cook it for 7 and 7.

Really good. Replaced flaxseed with Chia seeds and put about 1/8th of a cup of dark brown sugar.

oh forgot to add -I baked for less time.

why aren't there any nutritional values for this recipe?

I can't imagine why A cook from VT didn't like it? Hubby and I loved it. I did put less sugar -only 1/3 cup. I'll make it again.

I haven't made this yet, but I plan to. I just wanted to comment that the post by A Cook from Vermont (01/04/10) was too funny and left me laughing for a while. What a visual!

I'd rather eat a 3 meat pizza or greasy hamburger. I made it as written, tasted it, put it outside and even the wild animals wouldn't eat it.

i really like this recipe. i make it often. i use raisins instead of dates, less sugar/honey (like others noted), and add cinnamon. cinnamon takes it to a whole new level!!!

This is good but has too much sugar in it. I make a similar granola and you can use 1/2 c brown sugar and use natural apple sauce in place of the honey. Also if you sub flax seeds you are not getting the nutrients from the flax as your body cannot breakdown flax seeds. They must be ground in order to derive any benefits. I make something similar to this and use it as a topping for apple or peach crisp. Just chop up the fruit - add a little cinnamon to the fruit and a small measure of brown sugar. Then put the granola on top. Put foil over it - bake at 375 around 45 - 55 min. Take off foil and let get crisp for 10 min. Top with some greek yogurt and its great!

I agree this is the best granola I've tasted. After making it a couple of times I had an especially flavorful batch, darker in color, but very delicious....that's when I discovered the intense flavor of "roasted" walnut oil...yum. Since that happy mistake I've made it both ways, deciding that I prefer it made with at least half the oil being the roasted variety! Otherwise I make the recipe exactly as written. We like it equally well over yogurt and fruit or with just milk. This is a wonderful, dependable recipe and I get crazy if I don't have some on hand in the fridge!

This is the best granola I have ever tasted. I am sure the egg whites are what makes the difference. I used flax the first time and plan to make it with unsweetened coconut today. I am not worried, I know it will be very good no matter what is used instead of the flax.

I've made this recipe twice and have found that using sweeter dates and less sugar/honey is the way to go. It's so so delicious.

I had quick cooking oats and not old fashioned oats - so I just left out one of the 15 mins/stirs and it was fine. Delicious!!

Amazing! Best granola I've ever tired. I used ground Salba instead of flax. I did have to adjust the baking time, as it browns easily. I served it over balsamic strawberries and yoghut.

This granola is incredible - probably the best granola recipe I've ever come across, and I've made a LOT of granola! Used veggie oil instead of the walnut oil and flaxseeds instead of the flax meal, and it turned out great. Will use walnut oil next time -- I can imagine it will only make it better.

I made it today and it was the best Granola I've ever had! I'm going to make this from now on instead of buying it.

I thought this was very quick and tasty. Mine was also starting to get a little burned so I turned it down to 325 and opened the oven door a bit, part-way through. Flax meal looses health benefits with the addition of heat, however, so next time I may just toss flax meal at the end, or mix it with whatever yogurt/milk I am eating the granola with.

Excellent. I did reduce the sugar and honey a bit. I baked this in a convection oven at 300 degrees. Seemed to work fine.

I followed the directions and it was very burnt. I think the ingredients are wonderful and I will try a different variation of the recipe next time.

This has been the only cereal our household has eaten since the recipe was published. We can't get enough of the chewy dates in the cereal. I did cut the sugar down to 1/2c and didn't miss it.

This is a really good granola recipe, although I reduced the cooking time. I also used dried cranberries and added very finely grated fresh ginger during the egg white whipping stage. I also used 1/2 c. sugar as I don't like really sweet granola. I will use this as my standard granola recipe.

I really like this granola recipe. I added a hefty splash of vanilla, which was a great addition. In cutting the recipe in half, I found that I also needed to reduce the baking time slightly. But it was really tasty, and I'm loving it swirled into yogurt or vanilla ice cream, or doused in milk!

Loved this granola. I've made alot of granola over the years and this one is near perfect. Didn't have dates so used raisins...everything else as the recipe says.

This granola is nearly perfect - crunchy, earthy and sweet. I prepared it according to the directions exactly. Cooking time was perfect. The grocery store was all out of flax meal so I bought the organic flax seed and ground it in my food processor. We eat the granola for breakfast and snacks with fresh berries and Fage Greek Yogurt. PS - remember that flax seeds must be crushed open before digestion in order to obtain all that Omega-3 goodness.

I followed the directions exactly as printed and didn't substitute anything in this recipe and we just didn't like it. I thought it was over cooked. I've used the ingredients listed for this recipe and combined it with an old granola recipe from this website and we love the NEW improved granola.
