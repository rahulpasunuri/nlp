This was good and I'd make it again without all the simmering. I did simmer it for 1.5 hours, but I don't know what that accomplished except to cook everything to a pulp. The sauce doesn't reduce because it's covered so I'm not sure what the point of simmering it so long.

Very good! We didn't wait 1.5 hrs for the sauce to simmer, but it was wonderful nevertheless!

simple and elegant quick meal. had only regular capers, it saved some time. when the pasta was done, i stopped the sauce. who has 1.5 hrs to wait? there would have been only 1 tbs of tomatoes left. tasty.
