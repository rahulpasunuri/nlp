Great, easy to make. I have also made a variation, substituted almonds for pine nuts, orange juice for the grappa, sectioned oranges for the figs, and omitted the raisins. Still moist and delicious. Highly recommend, and it's a bonus that it's gluten free.

Made this for a ladies dinner and it was great! Not too sweet. Everyone loved it. Used white wine instead of Grappa.

Very Impressive. I used Agavero in place of the grappa. Salted toasted pine nuts and fig ice cream were a dreamy accompaniment.

Simple, unusual and delicious! Great flavors and texture. Didn't change a thing and won't in the future as it was perfect! Grappa is a bit pricey but more reason to make this cake over and over again! Enjoy.

This has become quite possibly my favorite cake-- quick, easy, unusual. I usually serve it with figs cooked in a red wine or grappa reduction; sometimes I stuff the figs with walnuts or pine nuts.

I am always looking for gluten-free desserts, and this was excellent in that it didn't try to replicate a floury taste at all, but used polenta to good effect. I substituted freshly ground cardamom for the fennel, and brandy for the grappa, and it was delicious! Highly recommended

This is a special treat. The book club girls were impressed. I was too cheap to buy a whole bottle of grappa for the recipe, so I used cognac instead, since it comes in tiny bottles.

Grappa is hard to come by so I used white wine instead. I left out the raisins and was glad I did because the cake was very sweet. In place of figs, I used dates. And the only polenta I could find was instant, so I went into the Latin food section and bought coarse cornmeal. It's a great alternative to the typical cornbread. I liked the pine nut twist - it's different

Ironically, it was a box of figs that led me to this recipe. When the time came to add them, I tasted them and found them to be not so yummy. I decided to leave out the figs and substitue 1/3 c. golden raisins instead. The result was very tasty. A dish both comforting and refreshing (because of the fennel seeds), and reasonably healthy as well. The presentation wasn't too glamorous so I sprinkled some powdered sugar on top. In the future I'd consider baking in individual ramequins for more style. I'd consider reducing the sugar a bit, depending on the other ingredients (the rasins made it very sweet).

This was different; my husband thought it was like Christmas pudding. Good flavors. I used sherry instead of grappa and chopped almonds for the pine nuts. Dense and moist cake.

I liked this alot, my husband didnt like it- go figure. I used rum as I didnt have grappa and think that worked out ok. I will make it again, but for my book group as I think the cake would work for a brunch.
