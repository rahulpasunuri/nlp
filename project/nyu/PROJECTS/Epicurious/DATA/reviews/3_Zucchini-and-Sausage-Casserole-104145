The zucchini needed to be salt & sit in the colander for 30 min. Squeeze as much liquid out as possible. I did everything in the recipe but use half & half (maybe heavy cream next time), used Italian mixed cheese. Didn't use the butter with the breadcrumb. It turned out real watery. Bake for another 45 min. & up the heat to 400 to 425. Finally, the casserole firmed up. Not bad after that. But I might half the recipe next time. Just the two of us & we are not big eaters.

Followed the main recipe except substituting hot Italian turkey sausage and added 4 diced jalapeños. For the topping used 3/4 cup cheddar cheese and 3/4 cup grated parmesena and substituted panko bread crumbs for the regular and cooked it 15 minutes longer than suggested. Next time will eliminate the butter in the topping and use milk instead of heavy cream. That said we thought it was very yummy. The bread crumbs browned nicely and gave it a nice look. Did not think it looked ugly like other reviewers.

I read all the reviews and agree with another reviewer that, if you swap out ingredients, you made something else, and shouldn't blame this recipe. That being said, I followed the directions (using smoked almonds in place of pecans) and had no issues. In fact, my entire family of 6 loved it and had seconds. It looked appetizing and tasted great. Any experienced home chef would find this easy.

I have to go with the others in saying that this is esthetically awful. It's too rich for my taste, but my husband really liked it. However, I won't make it again.

I used chorizo from the farmers' market and squash from my own garden. I think the milk was not necessary, or perhaps I should have salted and drained the squash because the end result was a bit liquid. I put in cooked red lentils instead of pecans, and used olive oil instead of butter in the topping, and panko instead of fresh bread crumbs. Put in a bit of tomato paste and a taste of white wine as well. It was very good. I think regular sausage would have been way too greasy and salty.

Turned out great for me. Thought 5 eggs was a lot but followed it almost exactly. Minus the pecans and used only 3 tbs of butter.

I love dishes that I can make in bulk and freeze in individual/2 serving dishes for easy, last minute dinners. This qualifies. Almost didn't add the pecans in either the mixture or in the topping, glad I did both, really made a difference. Used 1/2 shredded cheddar, 1/2 shredded fresh mozz, bc that's what I had on hand and was so creamy, despite using Half&Half instead of cream. YUMMMMMMM

Use Vidalia onions and Jimmy Dean Sausage (no grease). My favorite part of Thanksgiving!!

Great winter dish. It's one of the few recipes that I go back to. Use the largest breadcrumbs you can find, and don't skimp on the suasage.

I think that this dish would be wonderful as a SIDEdish. It does not have enough depth for a main course. I would happily make it again as a side...best paired with pork or chicken.

This is not my favorite recipe, but my daughter loves it so I have made it several times. It freezes beautifully and makes quite a good lunch heated in the microwave, That said, please remember this is a southern dish. If you substitute turkey sausage, italian sausage, or God forbid ground beef for the sausage or pine nuts, for peacans, etc., or change the ingredient quantities, you might be reviewing YOUR recipe, but you're not reviewing this one. Please don't.

Wow. I modified this recipe for my lactose boyfriend. NOT good without all the cheese and cream. I had to stop eating it after a few bites. Some recipes just don't work without the dairy.

After reading the reviews, I thought this is crazy - what's not to like about sausage, cheese and bread! And throw in a veggie to make it nutritious. Well, let me say that I actually made it, it actually looked unappetizing, we actually ate it and, surprisingly, we actually ate it again and again. It was weird, kind of like we were drawn to disgusting-looking food. After a few days I had to throw it out as it was just too gross to look at anymore. My husband and I nicknamed it "gruel" as in "Heat up the gruel in the microwave." Also, I must add that you need all those crunchy pecans, because without them, it would be a casserole of mush.

This is a fantastic recipie, and one that can be made in bulk and frozen. I have subsituted milk for the cream, and use no salt as the sausage takes care of that for you. IT can be served as a main dish or as a side. Bravo!

My family loved this dish. It is rich -- but for ten people it is not too rich as a side! The person who said it was salty added too much salt as it does not call for a specific amount. The other negative person used different amounts of the ingredients and changed the nuts, making it a different recipe. I would do this every Thanksgiving.

Maybe o.k. as a side dish, but it is ugly and too rich for a main dish. I used pine nuts on top, and omitted the pecans. Also used less onions and four eggs instead of five. Used panko in place of bread crumbs.

I thought this recipe was a waste of good pecans. I didn't have any sausage, so I used ground round, and ground pork, and added the sausage spices. I also used low carb bread crumbs. Maybe I didn't have enough grease in it because it ended up tasting pretty much like a meat loaf! My husband said it's great with ketchup on it, and I have to aggree. I couldn't taste any pecans. Actually, the recipe reminds me of an old vegetarian one from Fraces Moore Lappe's "Diet for a Small Planet". The recipe is called 'Walnut-Cheddar Loaf' and combines cooked brown rice, cheddar cheese, walnuts, onions, and eggs. It too, ends up tasting just like meat loaf. I think Natalie Dupree's recipe combines a good vegetarian recipe with a good fleischige. On the plus side: I was able to use up a lot of my zucchini and am thinking of other ways to use grated zucchs. In the future, I'll try something without the meat, and maybe another with meat but no nuts and a hard grating cheese.

Excellent recipe. My husband who is terrified of the very mention of zucchini said this was a make over after the first couple bites.

I made this dish looking for something that would stick to my ribs and give me a bunch of nutrition while pregnant with triplets. I find it pretty tasty, but agree wholeheartedly with the first reviewer who described it as aesthetically nightmarish. That is putting it mildly! I also found it very labor-intensive with all the cheese grating, nut chopping, and bread-crumb making. It did serve its purpose for me though. I might make it for a Thanksgiving potluck dish and try to make it look a little more appetizing next time. Maybe twice as much breadcrumb topping so that it's completely covered on top (I only wound up with it being about 50% covered following the recipe.)

I didn't really know what to expect with this, but I had the ingredients around and wanted to use them up, and I was intrigued by the vastly mixed reviews. I liked this and thought it worked well, but I probably won't make it again, because it is so unhealthy and because I could never serve it entertaining - it is aesthically nightmare-ish. But as far as the taste and satisfaction level, it was good. Based on other reviews, I left the nuts out of the mixture and just sprinkled them on top. That said, I thought it could use more! I love pecans. I only used 1/2 a large (red) onion. For my sausage, I used chicken-sundried tomato, and it was salty, but otherwise worked. I used only 4 eggs, because 5 just seemed way too many, and only about 3/4 cup breadcrumbs (1/2 in, and 1/4 on top). I didn't use any butter in the topping. One last comment, this filled a 2 quart AND a 1 quart baking dish with this - it would have been overflowing otherwise, even with what I left out. So I put one in the freezer.

This was awful! I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner... the only green on our table ended up being the olives after we all trashed this! It was too onion-y, sausage-y (surprisingly, the nuts didn't bother me), and just kind of "weird" tasting.

Rating: 1
This was just awful! I don't know if 2 onions was too much (my husband says it was) or if it was the sausage (of which I reserved less than the recommended 3 tbsp of fat--still too much), but it went in the trash. I thought this was going to be a great meal, and it smelled wonderful while it was cooking, but it was inedible. Even my husband, the human garbage disposal, couldn't stomach it.

Brought this to my Christmas potluck at work and everyone wants the recipe. Great rich recipe. I did cut down on the pecans and didn't add the nuts to the topping. Excellent with the hot sauce. This recipe made more than I expected (a good thing) and required more cooking time than recipe calls for.

I can't be the only one who was enticed by the looks of this recipe but then had a bit of trouble choking down ALL THOSE FREAKIN' PECANS! Way too many nuts going on here. The only way I'd make this again would be if I used about 1/3 the nuts and added some noodles to it.

Very rich indeed, and I only used 1/2 the butter required for the topping. Best as a sidedish, or if served as a main dish I'd say serve it with a very fresh salad, like roma tomato and red onion.

Yo - San Pedro, CA: This recipe has butter, sausage and cheese - what other nutritional information do you need? Yeah, it's bad for you but it tastes good. Not everything can be made with tofu.

This was okay the first day, but left over was much better. I used zucchini and sweet Italian sausage but no hot sauce, and it was spicy enough. I also used calico cheese instead of sharp cheddar -- the latter sounded bizarre. I ran out of pecans so used pine nuts on the top, and that was actually the best part! This would be two forks for first day, three for second day. Also it is very high in fat so I wouldn't make it very often!

I'm in the "really Like" crowd. In fact I'm making it again and going to try to freeze it. This is my husband's most favorite zucchini recipe...so far...in our quest to use up all the garden zucchini before it takes over our house. I used hot Italian and sweet Italian sausage and added extra sage...my market didn't have sage sausage. Yummy!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving last year, then again for Christmas and a third time a mid-January dinner party. It's wonderful, and we found it could replace stuffing, without anyone complaining or feeling cheated. It will be on the menu again this year, definitely.
