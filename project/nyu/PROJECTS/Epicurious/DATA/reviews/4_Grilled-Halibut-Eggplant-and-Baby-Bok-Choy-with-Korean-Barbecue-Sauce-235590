Have made this several times - terrific and easy. Try with coconut rice (2C jasmine rice, 1C coconut cream (not milk), 1.5T sugar 1t salt...a great pairing. Subbed broccoli one time for bok choy and broiled (no grill) - just as good. A definite must try for a simple preparation for fish and veggies.

Really good and easy with non-exotic ingredients. I followed the exact recipe except I broiled the fish and veggies. My very picky 7 year-old announced that I can make this all the time!

What a great recipe!!!! Cooking for two, I halved the fish and vegetable portions, but made the full sauce recipe per other reviews. Turned out to be the perfect amount. Halibut wasn't available at our market and the other large filets didn't look all that exciting so I went with tilapia. Had to dial down the grilling time, but the tilapia was excellent and took the sauce very well. This one is a keeper.

This is our new favorite grilled Halibut recipe! We used a zucchini instead of bok choy and a tsp of chili sauce instead of the serrano and served with a salad and rice!! Excellent, excellent, excellent!

I use this sauce with grilled Sea Bass. It is wonderful.Careful though to serve just a little sauce under the piece of fish. Too much would overwhelm the flavour of the fish. I serve it with Jewelled Rice available on this site. Rave reviews. Wish Sea Bass was not so expensive!!

I can only give it 3 as the only part of the recipe I followed was the Korean bar b que sauce. It was amazing good

Good and easy impress-your-guests recipe for a summer dinner party. I omitted the bok choy because I was using bok choy in a salad, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Yum!

This was a great recipe. The sauce is a wonderful sweet-spicy blend. We served the fish with rice noodles to soak up the sauce. We'll make this one again.

I made this recipe for 2 and halved the veggies and fish but kept the sauce as is. Many reviews said that they didnt care for the eggplant but I thought it was great. I bought Chinese eggplant at a local Asian market. Yum. The bok choy had a great texture from being cooked on the grill. Definitely a keeper.

This is overall good, but not impressive. I made this for two people, and I'm glad I didn't cut the sauce in half -- I agree with the previous reviewers that the sauce is just enough for two. Our dinner was only good and not great because the end result is nothing special. Halibut was $20 a pound today and, while it was a good meal, I wish we had tried another recipe.

I tried this for the first time tonight and was really pleased. I found it easy to make and really delicious. I don't care for the texture of the Japanese eggplant so will substitute that in future. I skimped on the bok choy and went with what I had on hand. My husband and I agreed, you need at least one per person it's so good. This is definitely a meal that can have some wow factor if you have people over but is aloso one you could possibly whip up after work impromptu as well.

Wonderful recipe, the spice had just the right balance of spice and sweet. The eggplant wasn't the best but I used portobello mushrooms instead of the bok choy and they were perfect.

Rating: 2
I was excited to try this based on reviews and it just sounded good. Only good part was the halibut. The eggplant was borderline and the bok choy was awful. Will not waste my time again with this one....even for the fish.

Wonderfully delicious and flexibly resilient! I did a "recessionary" version of this recipe- substituting Whiting fillets (for more expensive halibut), European eggplant for Jap. eggplant and the common celery for the bok choy. Everything was surprisingly wonderful- though the eggplant substitution requires longer cooking and much smaller pieces. Superb rating from my S.O.!

Very quick and easy. I broiled the eggplant and halibut; substituted mixed stir-fry vegies for the baby bok choy. I cooked the mixed vegies in the wok, finished with the sauce. Healthy and good!

Delicious! We were only 2 people and I doubled the sauce...not much left over. Pan roasted the halibut, served with ginger- jalapeno fried rice and a colorful veg medley that included bok choy. Will definitely make again.

I thought this dish was great! I sauteed the fish, but other than that I followed the recipe. The serranos gave it a great flavor

I had very mixed reactions to this dish. Since it is too cold for grilling out, I sauteed the fish and stir fried the bok choy (I didn't have any eggplant and don't care for it much anyway). The sauce was quite good on the bok choy, but overall, I felt the sauce was too sweet. I do plan to make it again, but cutting the sugar down by a tablespoon or so.

I prepared this in the oven and turned out well, did use zucchini instead of eggplant though. Reduced much longer than suggested to a glaze thickness.

Only made the fish (salmon) and baked it in the oven with a lot of sauce in the pan. Very yummy, could be spicier though. Served it with the Super Slaw on this site.

We used salmon because we couldn't find any fresh halibut at our market. It worked surprisingly well. Although we had slight problems with our barbecue sauce (it reduced to a sticky sauce that wouldn't spread), we were able to solve that by diluting it with a dash of water. The green onions were a perfect finishing touch.

Fab flavor combo! I didn't use the serrano seeds; two whole small chilis provided just the right heat for us (plus a bit more brown sugar than was asked for to balance out the vinegar). Although the halibut turned out truly spectacular in the texture department, the delicate flavor of the fish was a bit overshadowed -- might use cheap chicken next time instead. Not a big fan of eggplant, we used bok choy only and served it all over rice (also thought bok choy could have used a slight blanching beforehand to keep it moist over bbq heat). I will make double the sauce next time to keep for anytime we want an Asian kick.

Great recipe! We used scallops instead. This meal was only for two of us and we made the sauce as suggested, for four people;the ratio was perfect. We also substituted baby zucchini's for the Japanese eggplants, which worked well.

have made this a few times and always find it very nice. This last time, I forgot the sauce was on the stove and it reduced to almost a syrupy consistancy - the flavours intensified a ton and made the dish even better. Made vegetables in wok. As they were finishing, cleared spot in bottom of wok for fish and brushed with sauce. Yummy! Served veg & fish on one platter and drizzled remaining "syrup" over everything.

This was a real hit and so easy, great for entertaining, you can make the sauce early and just throw the fish and veggies on the grill, followed the recipe as written, but I tripled the sauce as I was serving 8; the sauce is the hit - everyone loved it (use low sodium soy) Served with jasmine rice with basil, cashews and papaya - will definitely add to my files.

We love this sauce and put it on all different kinds of fish and veggies for the grill. It's a no miss kind of a thing.

Rating: 3
We thought the sauce was wonderful - very similar to the sauce that accompanies steamed chinese dumplings - but could be a great accompaniment to any type of grilled fish or meat. I personally liked the vegetables better grilled than steamed so that worked well for me. All in all, one of the better fish dishes I've ever prepared.

The sauce is really wonderful. To save time, I mixed all the liquid ingredients and added a teaspoon of chile-garlic sauce (and deleted the step of sauteeing the garlic and the pepper); you should add more for an extra kick, but it was perfect for my husband and I who opt for 1 on spice level at restaurants. I basted everything liberally with the sauce and unfortunately the 1/4 cup recommended to set aside to drizzle wasn't enough for the finished dish for just the two of us. Next time I'll double (and perhaps triple) the sauce recipe because it would be great on just about anything. Terrific flavor.

The BBQ sauce is excellent and made for a special halibut preparation. I prefer baby bok choy sauteed or steamed rather that grilled and the eggplant was just okay. The vegetables took longer than 10 minutes on a medium grill and the basting did not do much to enhance the flavor.

I used low sodium soy sauce instead of regular soy sauce, as per my personal preference for less salty things. I could only find a jalepeno pepper, so used that instead of seranno. I thought the spice level was fine though. We all very much enjoyed the entire dish- it was a full meal. I would use less bok choy next time - it was the only thing left over.

My family and I liked the halibut and the sauce. Actually, I couldn't find baby bok choy or Japanese eggplant so I just grilled regular eggplant, tomatoes, and zucchini. It was all pretty yummy! I would definitely make this again using different veggies to grill.
