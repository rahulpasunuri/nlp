We really liked this. The only change I made was to reduce the clam broth as others recommended.

We made this with the changes suggested by Anne from Alpharetta. It was a very nice take on pasta with clams, an easy, healthy and tasty weeknight dinner but nothing to rave about. May or may not make again.

I agree with the other reviewers- a great dish but I did add the wine and it was fabulous. The red pepper flakes gave it a great kick. A perfect recipe for all those littlenecks we dig up around here this time of year!

A very nice dish for those who are counting calories - even with the pasta, this is a tasteful, sensible dinner. As some here suggested, I concentrated the clam reserve before proceeding with the dish, and thought the result was flavorful. As an extra touch, I added some roasted red pepper in addition to the tomatos - yum.

This receipe is good as is, but with a couple of additions was great. First, substitute 1 Tbs butter, 1/4 C white wine and 2 cloves minced garlic for the water. After the clams (mussels are good too) open, remove clams and boil liquid down until reduced by 1/2. Add another 1 Tbs butter, remaining 1 garlic clove and 1/8 Cup cream along with the other ingredients. Wonderful as a main or even a side along fillet.

This is a wonderful light fresh recipe! I also soaked the clams in cold water to release their sand.

This was good. Nice and fresh tasting. I would not say it is my all time favorite, but it is worth making again.

This is the absolute tastiest linguine with clams I have ever tried. I no longer have to order it in restaurants. I will try cooking down the liquid next time like another reviewer suggested becuase there was a lot of liquid.

I doctored this recipe quite a bit: first, I soaked the clams in cold water so that they released sand (which they released quite a lot of). Next, I found that the liquid left after steaming the clams was a lot more than what I started with so I boiled it down to concentrate the clam flavor. Then, I added a little butter to the clam juice and sauteed the tomatoes, basil, garlic etc. briefly. It was absolutely delicious this way; I made it for a family birthday dinner and it was very well-received, even by my non-pasta fan husband.

This was a delicious recipe and light and low fat too! I also used a little bit of tomato sauce to coat the pasta, and the clams were absolutely wonderful!

Tasty dish. The fresh clams have it all over canned clams or bottled clam juice. When I make this again, I will use a little tomato sauce to thicken the sauce and coat the pasta.
