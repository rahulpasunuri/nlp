This was absolutely delicious! I had some small red grapes that I needed to use up so I decided to make this recipe. It's going to become a regular. The onions got carmelized in the sauce, so it was great, very tasty. I would recommend making more sauce, next time I will double it as I like to have enough for the pasta I plate the chicken on. And it was not too sweet. I don't like overly sweet things, but this had a good balance. Maybe it had to do with the kind of grapes I used. Oh and I used dried terragon, it worked great.

This was good; I wasn't able to find muscat grapes so used regular red grapes. In the end I found it a bit too much work for how it turned out. It was also a little too sweet for me - I prefer savory chicken dishes - but my husband thought it was good and ate it all up. The only reason I'd make this again, though, is if I happened to have all the ingredients on hand. The chicken recipe I like best on this site is the chicken with yellow tomatoes and balasmic vinegar.

I used muscadine grapes, not muscat. See review below.

Muscat grapes are far better cooked than fresh. The leathery skins make a slightly bitter contrasting balance to the sweetness inside. In following with many traditional French recipes, I used the muscats with French tarragon (not regular tarragon) and added equal amounts of homemade chicken stock and creme. Next time I will make it with rabbit. The dish came out great.

Like many of the other reviewers, I was unable to find muscat grapes. I did, however, find a bottle of relatively inexpensive muscatel wine (from Trader Joe's). So I used red seedless grapes and substituted the muscatel wine for the dry fruity wine in the recipe. I've made this so many times now... and always to rave reviews.

This dish was amazing and so easy to prepare! Only real work was de-seeding the muscat grapes. If you can get real muscat grapes, it'll make all the difference!

This was a delicious meal. It was plenty of food for two, and even though I wasn't able to find the exact grapes, just your typical red grapes from the market worked perfectly. I love sauteed chicken, and this had excellent flavor.

Even though I haven't made this recipe, I think I like it because it's all but identical to another one that found on this website--Chicken Cutlets Veronique (Look it up if you don't believe me). I've never made the Veronique with Muscat grapes, but it's fine with seedless green table grapes or a mixture of green and red. Hmmm. . .isn't anyone checking on recipe originality?

I loved this meal!! I even used green grapes, because that was what I had, and it turned out to be wonderful! Very quick and easy. It was like a meal from a restaurant!

Quick and very good. My husband loved it, I liked it. I used green muscat grapes, and I got some of the musky flavor the magazine describes, but I am curious to make it with red muscats if I can find them.

Quite good, and certainly quick and easy. A lovely weekday supper. I would like to say I found the Muscat grapes but, alas, I had to make do with some plain Italian red grapes. Nevertheless, a tasty Fall meal with some sauteed spinach and braised potatoes.

Quick and easy to prepare -- a good weeknight dish with a good combination of flavors. I was unable to find the muscat grapes, unforunately -- red seedless worked well for me.
