I adjusted this recipe a bit and found it to be a much more silky product!! I thinly sliced the onion and cooked it in 2 Tab. butter until VERY SOFT (12to 15 min.) then I added this to each layer, about 2 teas. for each layer. Proceed as per directions.

Too much celery root. Next time use half the celery root and you will have a great recipe.

This was made for our Easter Dinner and enjoyed by all adults and some children. Did not use the nutmeg, made a paste out of the garlic and added it to the cream/broth mixture. The potatoes should be the last thing sliced or sliced prior to each layer to prevent browning.

Made this without the cheese for a side dish. Couldn't find celery root so I substituted a mixture of porcini and plain white mushrooms. Absolutely delicious and my dinner partner raved. Can't wait to try it with celery root when I can find it!

Hooray for Toronto! We loved this dish. Yeah, the celery root is a bit on the heavy side, but we loved it anyway. Cincinatti, don't fault the recipe when you didn't follow directions! When you shredded the celery root, you created more liquid rather than the sliced root absorbing the stock as it cooked.

I must protest against the other reviewers' low ratings! I've made this dish for the Xmas crowd ever since it came out, and it's always had rave reviews. My only change was to add less celery root: maybe one third celery root to two thirds potato because of the strong taste of it. Still, we think it's great!

I made this recipe for the first time for a dinner party and it tasted very good. However, I chose to shred the celery root, instead of slice and combined the onions, cheese and garlic together before layering. It makes a very large amount, so I would use fewer potatoes and celery root. Also, the liquid added was too much - it resulted in a lot of liquid in the finished casserole, so I probably cut that in half to achieve a creamer texture. The taste was very good, particularly if seasoned well.

Made this dish as a main course. It would be much better as a side dish.I felt it was a lot of effort for the results I got. It was OK...

I used half quantities for two of us, and a low fat cream substitute. A really tasty dish for vegetarians, ideal for a cold winter day
