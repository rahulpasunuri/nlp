To the cook in England - There really is not another veg that is comparable to the artichoke. I guess that's because the 'choke is actually a thistle. A VERY easy way to do this is to cut the 'choke in half, top to bottom. Here: 1. Use scissors to cut the sharp tips from choke. Rub cuts with half a lemon to prevent discoloration. 2. Cut choke in half from tip to stem. Rub entire cut area with lemon. 3. Using a paring knife, cut out the choke (fuzzy part)where it meets the solid flesh. Push the knife in deeply and cut with a shallow "U" shape. This should get most of it. You can scrape remaining fuzz with knife tip. Rub with more lemon. 4. Wrap in parchment before foil, as foil will discolor choke. 5. When cooked the leaves will come off very easily and whats left is the center (heart) and it is very soft and easy to chop. I hope this helped!

I love mint but I've never cooked or eaten artichokes before so I am a bit daunted at scooping out 'chokes', removing 'leaves', chopping 'hearts' etc! Is this easy and can the taste be compared with any other vegetable? or do I just go for it and hope we like them?

Interesting flavor. Not for those who don't like mint at all. I happen to love mint. It went well with the artichokes and was a nice change to the melted butter I normally use. The after taste was nice. I gave it two forks only because most of my guests and family are not mint fans.
