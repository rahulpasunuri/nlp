Oh, and one more thing: For the salsa, I broiled the onion, garlic cloves (unpeeled) and jalapeno rather than pan-char them; I used a 28 oz. can of tomatillos and did not broil them. I put everything but the avocado in the food processor, preferring to finely chop the avocado and leave little chunks of it mixed into the salsa.

Truly, truly wonderful. I have to admit, I was skeptical of all the additions (especially of cheese) to the dough, and I half expected the arduous process to yield a lot of undercooked, gritty goop. But the whole recipe came out beautifully -- and pretty easily with the help of two friends to roll the tamales. I followed the tamale recipe to the letter but, for the salsa, threw in an extra half an avocado and handful of cilantro; I also replaced the serranos with a single jalapeno, which made the salsa more than hot enough for my heat-loving palate. (Once I'd added the avocados, it was perfect.) Oh, and my steaming method: I filled a bamboo steamer and a collapsible metal steamer with the tamales and stacked the metal one on top of the bamboo one's lid inside a stock pot. (Together the steamers came to the very top of the pot.) After an hour of steaming the tamales still needed some more cooking; at an hour and twenty minutes they were perfect. I could eat these constantly. Next time, I may make a double batch and freeze them.

I have used this recipe for years. It usually takes longer to steam than instructed... maybe by about 15 minutes. Other than that, it works perfectly. It receives rave reviews wherever I take them!

The tamales were good but the salsa is superb. I now make the salsa when I need an impressive, different salsa.

I have never been so frustrated as I am with this recipe. I cannot get them to firm up, even after steaming for well over an hour (i.e., 1 hr. 40 mins). I made this recipe twice: the first time with "tamale masa mix." They didn't firm up. OK, maybe I should have purchased the "tortilla masa." I tried that. They didn't firm up. I tried the towel, top and bottom. No luck. I tried low steam, high steam, medium steam, packing them into the pan, putting in only a few. Nothing worked - they were goupy, sloppy and very inappetizing. Now, having spent 8 hours total and quite a few bucks, I have nothing to show for my work. What am I doing wrong? Why is everyone else getting a good result?

So fantastic. Yes, a lot of work, but a great joy on a rainy day. This recipe has become my favorite for dinner parties. It's fun and delicious, just watch the spice. I also make the tomatillo salsa and use it on everything!

I was looking for a new tamale recipe and loved the idea of green chile tamale, not unlike the green corn tamales I grew up with in southern Arizona. However, I found the result disappointing - the addition of cheese in the tamale dough makes the tamale less delicate. I will go back to my tried and true Diana Kennedy recipe, but I may alter to incorporate the ground corn [fresh or frozen] as I like the additional fresh corn taste. The tomatillo-avocado salsa was nice, but again, I may alter for my taste and give it more heat.

Loved this. Ran poblanos through processor. Ran out of husks before I ran out of filling so I made the remainder with parchment paper. I miss tomatillos, which you cannot get here, so I used a different salsa altogether.

I made it as someone said above by mixing everything together first and then just plopping the stuff into the corn husks. It was an extraordinary amount of work as it was, but so fabulous that it would be worth making again with help.

This recipe was delicious. I used sharp cheddar and monterey jack cheeses which was yummy and I found fresh made masa at a local latin market which made it easier. Mine were also perfectly done in one hour of steaming but I also placed a moist towel on top of the tamales.

I added chicken to mine. I also mixed everything together then rolled it into the husks. This way there's no big mess.

These are the best tamales ever! Even people who don't usually like tamales adore these. I've been making them for years, always with fabulous results. I serve them with guacamole instead of the salsa.

Time consuming, but not terribly so. Went over well with everyone. Great flavor although next time I'll probably kick the heat up a little. Love the tip for using a tortilla press rather than pressing out the dough for ech tamale.

This was my first time making tamales too, and they turned out wonderfully. I didn't make the salsa part of the recipe, and instead just bought some salsa to put on top. I'm sure the home-made salsa would have been a nice touch, but this way was a lot quicker and cheaper. I will definitely make these again--although not for a while because now I have a bunch in the freezer!

This was my first time really making tamales, and though it was definitely a project, the results were delicious! The cheese and corn mixed with the masa make it fairly filling, and the salsa compliments the tamales perfectly. This recipe is a little on the spicy side, so if you have a tender tongue, go easy on the chilies. But wow... I'm definitely making this again.

Friends, I found a great way to wrap tamales in Diana Kennedy's "Mexican Kitchen". Drape a tortilla press with cut plastic baggies, press out a corn "tortilla", spoon in the tamale filling, use the plastic to lift up the edges and roll the tamales, then viola! pass it onto the corn husk! worked well for this great recipe, made without the cheese.

A lot of work for these tamales!They were very good, especially the salsa. I think some photos or diagrams of the process would have been helpful. Tips on steaming so many at a time would have also helped. The recipe could have been much more helpful. I will make them again but not for a while!

I had never made tamale's and this was a good first recipe. I made it for an iron chef party with corn as the ingredient. I actually halfed it for an appetizer, which made 12 small tamale's. I found the salsa too hot for me, but others may like it. I fashioned my own steamer with a metal colander in a large pot. It was slightly tilted but worked great. I used wet cornhusks to wrap the colander with leaves tucked in the sides and folded over the top. They steamed perfectly in 1 hour. I will reheat them tonight- hopefully they will be enjoyed by everyone.

So-So there is a much better recipe on this site from a restaurant in LA

These are the tamales I've been looking for! Sweet and savory in one corn husk. I used fresh corn cut off the cob and blanched, it's so easy to do and really makes this recipe richer. One ear yields a little less than a cup of corn. Buy some chips too, the amount of salsa is way more than you'll need for the tamales, but delicious enough to not stay around for much longer.

I made these for Christmas dinner...they took longer than I expected, but they turned out really great. A little difficult on figuring out how to roll the tamales...I "cheated" and ran over to a couple of bookstores and looked at some tamale books so I'd have some visual aids, but there seem to be a million different ways to do it. I ended up just sort of making up my own way and they turned out just fine. I added some shredded turkey to the filling--the only thing I'd change is to add more spice to the filling to give them some more kick. The tomatillo-avocado salsa is really easy and tasty, and I'll probably make that more frequently.

These were a huge amount of work, but worth every second. They're wonderful! I used the very helpful drawings and instructions in Rick Bayless's Mexican cookbook to assemble and tie the tamales, and had no problem using the strips of corn husks. His instructions for improvising a steamer large enough to hold all the tamales are also very helpful, as well as his advice to put leftover soaked husks under and on top of the assembled tamales in the steamer.

This was a delicious recipe. I altered the filling by boiling a small pork loin and shredding it into some enchilada sauce with the cheese and poblano chiles. I skipped the corn in the filling and made my own sauce with a large can of tomatoes, blended,and a couple teaspoons each of cumin, paprika, chili powder, one sautee'd onion and black pepper and square of dark chocolate. Yummy and easy to fix.

I have made this recipe several times, it requires a little bit of time and preparation but the results are worth it. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys trying new flavors.

These were incredible tamales. They are most certainly not easy to make, but I found them to be most delicious. The salsa is great too. We served these with sour cream as well. Great Recipe!

As a basic tamale recipe, it's fine. You can make smaller, mini-tamales(1 in. x 2 in.)that cook a lot faster- about 12 min. Asian bamboo steamer baskets work great for cooking these. You can stack the baskets and not the tamales.

For the first time tamale maker, but what I consider a confident cook, this recipe was not detailed enough. It calls for 1 hour of steaming, yet close to 2 hours later, my tamales were still glossy and gummy. After surfing the web to find more recipes, I found one that suggested placing a dish towel on top of the stacked tamales under the lid to absorb excess moisture. Once I did this, they firmed up and became spongy and cooked within 15 minutes. Very frustrating to find I wasn't done cooking until almost 3 1/2 hours after starting the recipe. They are definitely not something you can make after work with even two hours to spare...They were delicious once cooked, though. I'd make them again, but on a weekend with lots of time to kill!

Great recipe! I had never made tamales before and thought they would be more difficult. They do take a long time to make however, so I would highly suggest that you (at least) triple the tamale part of the recipe and freeze the rest. I even made some of the salsa without the avovado and froze it. When I was ready to use it, I simply thawed it in the microwave, then processed it with fresh avocado.

These were wonderful and catorigized as,"a keeper"! I used fresh sweet yellow corn I cut from the cob and omited the sugar because the corn was nicely sweet. I only used 1 serrano chilie in the salsa as the poblanos I bought seemed hotter than most. The salsa is very versatile and refreshing!Fun recipe as a side with other southwest foods and grilled meats. The recipe makes alot and would be fun for a casual dinner party. Great the next day with a pork based green chilie enchilada sauce.
