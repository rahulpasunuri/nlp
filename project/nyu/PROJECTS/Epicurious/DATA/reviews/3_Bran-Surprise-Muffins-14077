No need for TWO cups of sugar and no need for liners! I adjusted this recipe according to suggestions by one reviewer (from the Carribean, 8/21/03) and used a lot less sugar (1/2 cup brown & 1/2 cup white) and used a mix of all purp & whole wheat flour. I crushed the cereal before measuring. I added a tsp. of baking powder since others commented on the lack of rise, but I don't think that did much since they were still somewhat short! I baked using the convection feature on my oven (at 375) and they were beautifully golden in half the time and they popped EASILY out of the pan since I used cooking spray. Anyway, they were perfectly delicious and the cream cheese filling added a nice touch - worth the extra step! Now, if I can oly figure out how to make them gluten free...

I made these with plain bran cereal and used sweetened dried cranberries instead of raisins. I also added grated orange peel. A little sweet as written; but my daughter liked them that way. Next time I will try the reduced sugar/honey combo other reviewers suggested.

I halved the recipe; used 1 cup all purpose and 1/4 cup wheat flour. 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar. Added chopped dried apricots (instead of raisins). Came out pretty well. Baked at 375 for 25 minutes. Fast, easy, popped right out of muffin tins (greased with butter). A little chewy on the bottoms. Served warm with strawberry rhubarb jam. Will make these again.

It's easy, tasty but the cream is unnecessary...didn't add a lot. next time i won't use it.

I took the suggestion of 1/2 c of sugar & honey each but added about 1 cup more flour, used an organic whole grain cereal (Optimum Zen) & reduced the oven temp to 375. The type of sugar I use is Rapadura, which is as natural as you can get, so I'm sure that made a huge difference in the flavor & sweetness. I'm not a muffin person but these are very good. If you don't like how they come out, you did something wrong.

I have made this recipe many times and it is always a hit. More often than not, I omit the cream cheese filling and add 2 cups of blueberries. I also make them with fresh cranberries. Delicious.

This recipe has got a bad rap and with a couple of simple adjustments is the best bran muffin in my repetoire. Instead of 2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup honey is more than enough sweetness and 1 and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and one cup white instead of all white. I bake them at 375 instead of 4 and I normally get 18/20 muffins because I often bake them without the filling. Fill the tins almost full because it is true, these muffins don't rise a lot but they are moist and delicious and I have never had somebody tell me that they don't like them and I have made them for years. Whew, long sentence. Just spray your tin with cooking spray and they will pop out, no need to use paper cups. Hope this helps.

I just made these muffins yesterday and made a ton of changes but received great reviews. I picked this recipe because I was looking for something more dense than just a cakey muffin. Yes, they are alittle difficult to release from the pans...but well worth the effort. As for the sweetness of the recipe..If you like sweet you will love this. I was looking for a bran recipe to add fresh blueberries to, so I added about 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries. I cut back the sugar to 1 3/4 cup. Replaced 1 cup white flour with whole wheat flour and added about 1/2 cup oats. I did do the suprise middle on half and my husband who hates cream cheese still loved them. I did not have any problems with them rising as some others have suggested. To my suprise I loved the raisin bran! I would love to try this recipe again with fresh raspberries.

My fiance LOVES this recipe and requested me (many times) to make them again for him. I pulled up the recipe from the site, and I couldn't believe the bad reviews. These muffins are no fail and everyone that eats them can't eat enough. If you make them exactly as the recipe calls for, you'll have a winner every time.

Discustingly sweet, it gagged me. Didn't rise & made a mess. Couldn't taste anything but sugar. What a waste of Raisin Bran, and my time!

Epicure? Using raisin bran cereral? This quickie is a over sweet mess with no justification to be here.

NOT so great. The filling was weird, they hardly rose at all in the oven. They were a BIG disappointment.

yummy! I substituted dried cranberry bits for the raisins, really good!

These had a great flavor but made a mess in my oven. Then I tried putting them in a loaf pan and burned the top and the bottom still wasn't done. I found they just didn't raise right.

I tried this out at an assisted living facility where I work and everyone loved it... I did make a slight mistake in putting in more nutmeg than was called for, but it turned out better!

Loved this recipe, but a lot of the muffin was lost with the muffin paper. Next time, I will make it without them and spray the muffin tin.

I wouldn't change anything at all...it's wonderful just the way it is!

I was disappointed with this recipe. They tasted good right out of the oven...but then lose their moisture over a couple of days. My children LOVE raisin bran cereal and did not care for these.

I make these regularly for my husband and boys, who love them right out of the oven, or as a quick carry-out morning snack. I love the fact that I can make them fresh, a few at a time -- in fact, they seem to raise more once the batter's been in the refrigerator a few days! Works with low-fat cream cheese; sprayed muffin tins with Pam and they come out fine.

Moist, delicious, and best of all my 4 year old loved it! Said it looked like chocolate and vanilla! It was quick also. Will definitely make again.

The muffins were quite delicious. They are however not an esthetically beautiful presentation...they simply look like a bran muffin from the outside.

wonderful muffins. Since my family isn't crazy about raisins I used plain bran flake cereal and added chopped walnuts instead of raisins. A real keeper.

These muffins were awesome! The best bran muffins I have ever made by far! I cut the recipe in half and it worked out perfectly. They are very moist and tasty with a nice crusty top. Mine didn't rise much but that may have been the intention. Don't forget to grease the top of your muffin tin!
