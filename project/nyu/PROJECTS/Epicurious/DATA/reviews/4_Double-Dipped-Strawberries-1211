Quick, easy and reliable recipe. We picked up Betty Crocker cookie icing and drizzled it over the chocolate dipped strawberries. The icing comes in several pastel colors and white. It was fast and looked great for a spring platter. We used both good quality milk and white chocolate for the base chocolate and the icing provided nice contrast.

I had the same problem as Los Angeles with the chocolate chips melting, but not becoming liquid enough to dip the strawberries in. I melted the chips in the double boiler as instructed with the vegetable shortening. Not wanting to throw out the lump of chocolate (or worse eat it) I added some low fat milk in small quantities until the mixture became smooth and liquid. After that, they turned out great. Maybe some chocolate chips have less oil than others?

I made these without the sprinkles, since I didn't have them in the pantry. So as not to get my whole hand in the "chocolate pot" when dipping, I used a soup ladle to retrieve the melted chocolate and then dipped the strawberry into that. Also I let the dipped strawberries dry upside down (stem down) in mini muffin tins, and then put them in the refrigerator. This way, one side wasn't flattened.

This was an easy treat at the end of dinner. My husband was pleasantly surprised, and I had to restrain myself from continually licking the bowl.

Excellent. I used jumbo long-stem strawberries. The amount of chocolate is plenty for a box of 16 jumbo strawberries.

A success. However, i did not include the sprinkles. For shortening, i used Spectrum Vegetable Shortening which has 0 trans fat.To keep them cold for my party, i created a ice box to go below the tray of berries. This was an effective way of keeping them cold as they begin to melt within ten minutes if not kept cool.

Alright "fucial from Mechanicsburg, PA" the thought of stuffing the strawberries before dipping them has me salivating! I love the simplicity of this recipe and now I must go buy a couple baskets of fresh strawberries and mascarpone cheese today and try them stuffed.

So good and so easy! Fun to make with kids. The chocolate set within 1/2 hour. Drizzle with white chocolate for a prettier look.

This was fantastic and easy! I should have made twice as many, they were way more popular than the other dessert at my party.

I just made these for a brunch and they didn't last long. Very easy, and I liked the fact that the chocolate didn't get too hard - just firm enough, but soft enough to bite into. I'll make these again.

Excellent recipe that looks very impressive but is remarkably simple. Versatile too - perfect for a bridal shower or my daughter's preschool party. I think the shortening really sets the chocolate nicely and gives that pretty sheen. Just be sure to set aside some extra for the cook to devour later because once you put these out there will be none left :)

OK, "cook from Los Angeles", where in the recipe does it say to melt the chocolate in the microwave? Please rate the recipes only if you follow them. And if you want to make stuff in the microwave, try the food channel. This is Epicurious! Anyway, these are great. Here's an idea I'm going to try - core the strawberries removing the stems and hollowing out some. Fill the strawberries with a sweet mixture of mascarpone cheese (you can use any you like). Then dip them as called for in the recipe. Make a thin chocolate using white chocolate and drizzle over. Awe your guests!

Great recipe. Use shortening to make it shine. DO NOT use whipping cream. That will form a ganache. That is not what you want. Personal Pastry Chef President Rider University

I guess I must be a complete idiot because I found it impossible to melt the chocolate as directed. And even if it had melted, it would have been too thick to "drip off" the strawberries. Don't try melting your chocolate in the microwave either.....unless you really know what you're doing. What a bleeping disaster! The only way I can see this working is to make a granache. I might try that, but I certainly wouldn't waste another ounce of good chocolate on this recipe. If I could give this recipe less than one fork I would.

This is a terrific recipe -- BUT make sure to use very high quality chocolate and don't expect them to last very long. I wouldn't keep them overnight!

I don't know why, but people are always so impressed when I bring these to gatherings- it is so easy! I hate the thought of using shortening though, I use whipping cream instead- I got the idea from the South Beach Diet cookbook!

Always a hit at buffets or parties. They come out beautiful and they are so little work! I usually skip the second 'dipping' but they don't lose anything in presentation or taste!

I love chocolate dipped strawberries and it's pretty hard to screw this recipe up. I made a few variations though. ALong with the semi sweet chocolate I made white chocolate in the same fashion. Some strawberries were chocolate, some white chocolate, some chocolate drizzled with white and some white drizzled with semi sweet. It came out delcious and beautiful. Will most definitely make again.

I paired this with the Fresh Fruit with Creamy Gran Marnier Sauce (on this site) for a party buffet. Easy, elegant, delicious! There certainly were no worries about the strawberries breaking down, that plate was EMPTY when I left the party. It also was quite lovely for individual servings with a couple of strawberries nestled on the cream in a small ramekin. To the Cook on 4/16/01, don't "dip" the strawberries in the sprinkles (or whatever topping you are using), "sprinkle" the sprinkles, and then only on one side. That way, you can control the amount of coating the strawberries get and they don't come out so thick.

Wow! These turned out fantastic!! I microwaved the chocolate to melt it and felt that it went on the strawberries kind of thick. I went with it and used a variety of toppings for the "double dip" part. I used chopped pistachios and walnuts as to the other reviewers suggestions as well as chocolate sprinkles, and mulit-colored sprinkles, and I even left some plain. There were beyond easy to make, great presentation and wonderful taste.

I made this for my kids birthday party and it was a huge hit! I also dipped large marshmallows and bananas, I used a few different types of sprinkles. They looked very prffessional, and they were so tasty and easy! The Mom's loved it!

Fabulous AND impressive looking. I used one dozen JUMBO berries with the stems, and I took the advice of the reviewer who drizzled white chocolate over them instead of the jimmies. Made them for a tennis party and my friends could not believe that they were homemade. Gorgeous. However, they don't hold up that well overnight so enjoy them soon after you make them.

To make it even easier I melted baking chocolate in the microwave(following directions on package). For a special occasion (in my case a Halloween party), I melted a separate small batch of white baking chocolate and colored it with contrasting food coloring gel (I used orange), then drizzled it over the dipped strawberries using a baggie or decorating baq with very small hole cut out of corner. I even wrote "Happy Halloween" on the plate.

Excellent, and very easy! I dipped 4 lbs. of strawberries in 30 minutes. Try to make these the same day you are going to serve them, though; they start breaking down by the next day.

Very good! I made half the batch with the sprinkles and other half with just plain chocolate (but drizzled white chocolate on them as per another reader's suggestion). I think I liked the second way better (w/o the sprinkles). The sprinkles may have made the choc. coating too thick-too difficult to get to the strawberry!

I made these for Easter Dinner and my guests loved them they asked where I got the recipe and when I told them they asked me for the web address and so I gave it to all my guest. I am hooked on your website.

This is one of my favourite desserts. I like to use dipping chocolate in the microwave and make half a batch with semisweet and the other with white. Melt a bit of each chocolate in separate small freezer bags, snip off the tiniest bit of the bag off a corner and drizzle the dipped strawberries with the alternate colour. Makes for a beautiful presentation and always impresses guests! Only you'll know how easy it was to make!

I just made this again and this time I microwaved the chocolate mixture and it worked excellent. Instead of dipping them in sprinkles, I dipped them and ground pistachio nuts-O BOY really good. You could dips them in any ground nuts, but the pistachios were just plain terrific!
