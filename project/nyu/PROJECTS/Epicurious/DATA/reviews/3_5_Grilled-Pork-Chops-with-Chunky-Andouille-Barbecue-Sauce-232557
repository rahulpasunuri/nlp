After working on our garden all day, grilling outdoors just seemed like a great idea. So I hit the store quick to gather a few things I needed to make this and never looked back. It was an awesome recipe that hit the spot with the family and I will definitely be making it again.

Easy enough to make for a weeknight, grilling the pork while I made the sauce. I used an Andoille that wasn't spicy enough for my tastes so I'll have to crank that up next time. Fiancee thought the balsamic smell during cooking would overpower it but it mellows out nicely. A little fresh parsley on the final result adds nice color to an overall brown dish.

The Andouille sauce makes this recipe. It was amazing! I served this recipe to 8 guests, every pork chop was eaten and every drop of sauce was consumed. Rave reviews. I marinated the chops in minced onion, spices and a bit of apple cider vinegar for a couple of hours before grilling. This made the chops very tender. Be careful not to over cook the pork. This recipe is a keeper.

I've made this recipe twice now. Once with a spicier Andouille, and once with a typical Andouille from the average grocery store that was pretty bland. When I used great sausage, the recipe was exceptional. Don't go for sausage without the kick, or the recipe doesn't have much going for it.

very easy and very tasty, what a great combo. i served it with an easy cole slaw and corn bread and it was a nice dinner. we just moved to NC and having only been in our new house two weeks so this easy, tasty meal made me look good:-), but it was a cinch.

The key to this dish is the andouille sausage. I can usually find it at Costco and love the taste. The sauce has a nice kick to it. Great meal for a weeknight with corn on the cob.

Husband and brother-in-law both loved this dish. I made it with spicy pork chorizo sausage b/c I couldn't find andouille here. Very easy to prepare and it smells great too. I'd like to give it 3.5 forks!

My kids love it. It is easy to make, even after a full workday....I added smoked sausages (can't find Andouille in Jamaica) and bacon to "yum" it up a bit. Everyone asks for this recipe and it is my pleasure to send it to them from the website.

Agree with the reviewer from Winston-Salem. Sauce was just ok. Even with the andouille, didn't have much depth. But it was a quick and easy sauce if that's what you need.

Absolutely fantastic, the meat was tender and the flavors were bursting.

I don't understand the rave reviews - this was just ok - nothing I'd ever make again.

This recipe was really wonderful and incredibly easy to make. My two year old twins at every bite and my husband loved it too. This will be made many times in the future!

This recipe rocks! Use andouille sausage-it is the key to the flavor of the sauce. We have a weekly Wednesday dinner party, and everyone declared this a keeper, and requested it again soon. Very easy to make with great flavor combos between the pork and sausage.

Very good and very easy. I think this sauce would be even better on grilled chicken. Watch the chops. 9 minutes/side was to long and I overcooked them a bit.

Excellent. I used chorizo instead of andouille sausage, only 2 tbsp. of vinegar, lg. can of whole tomatoes(chopped up) instead of sauce, just reduced it down before adding spices. Next time will make for company, as my family loved it.

This dish is really delicious!! The sauce really perks up regular pork chops. Made just as instructed for a dinner party and everyone loved it!

I have made it twice so far, once for my husband and once for guests. I am the type of person that enjoys slaving for hours when guests are coming for dinner but don't have time during the week to do so. It is delicious and so easy to make that it is a perfect week night entertaining meal when served with corn bread and coleslaw. I used Aidells chirzo and corn sausage as andouille is too spicy for our taste. The package of sausage comes with 5 links - this first time I used 3 the second I used 2, I liked the consistancy of the sauce using 3 links better.

Great alternative to boring pork chops. I used some homemade tomato sauce and real New Orleans andouille, and was very happy with the reult. You can use thin cut pork chops too, but don't over cook them.

This recipe looks and tastes as good as the picture. I had plenty of sauce left over. We served it with coleslaw as well. Yum.

Very good, easy mid week dish. Good quality pork chops and andouille are key. Served with purchased coleslaw and fresh green beans and pepper salad. Topped off with a desert of balsamic peaches over vanilla ice cream with ginger snaps. Quick midweek dinner with a flair of elegance. Will use left over sauce on chicken or eggs.

I thought this was a really great recipe. The barbeque sauce was amazing. It's such a nice mix of flavors. I would love to cook this again!!

Not being a sausage fan I wasn't sure how I'd like this but it's great. The barbeque sauce is easy to prepare and the flavors work well together.
