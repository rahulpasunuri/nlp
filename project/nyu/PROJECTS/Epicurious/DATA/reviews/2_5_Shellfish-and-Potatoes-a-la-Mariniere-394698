@Nickaalt9, You ask "who would think to make delicate seafood with white wine and potatoes" that would be Alain Ducasse, one of the greatest French chefs EVER...everyone please go ahead and make this dish, it's really really good and the ingredients compliment each other nicely.

I am looking forward to trying this recipe. As for those who disparage shellfish paired with potatoes, have they never had a traditional New England clam bake?

I have not tried this recipe yet, and in all probability I shall, but to the reviewer who asserted that it was not possible to make a shellfish dish with potatoes that had flavor I recommend the following: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/ Cast-Iron-Roasted-Clams-107008

I completely agree, who would think to make delicate seafood with white vine and potatoes... If you make two separate dishes maybe it will work, but not together... Potatoes starch when cooked arrases any flavors even salt... and you tried to combine with white vine...

We are big fans of shellfish so when I saw this it sounded intriguing especially in combination with potatoes. I made it last night for dinner. I followed the recipe exactly as I usually do when first making a recipe. What a disappointment! It was very bland. I can't even think what could have helped make it acceptable. I would not make it again.
