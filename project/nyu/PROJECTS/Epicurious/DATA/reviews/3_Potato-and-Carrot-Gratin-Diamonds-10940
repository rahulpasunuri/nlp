Made this for Rosh Hashanah dinner and it was a hit! It was gorgeous and the texture was rich and custardy. I added a 1/2" piece of ginger to the carrot mixture and a little fresh grated parmesan to the milk/egg mixture. All the guests (including my veggie-hating husband) raved about it.

I made this dish for a dinner party with two visiting friends from Paris and it was great. I would lessen the amount of carrots as it was a bit too sweet for the potatoes. Add some cheese for a bit of "kick".

This dish turned out as lovely as shown in the photograph. The carrots add beautiful color, but contributed an overly sweet taste. I was not expecting that and was disappointed that they over-powered the taste of the potatos. Moral of the story? Just add a wee little grated carrot to your favorite potato gratin dish for something different.
