This was yummy and very easy. Might be able to do it with slightly less butter.

This is an OK recipe. Cornmeal coating is great on trout but it's much better if you add lots of spices like cayenne, chili powder and thyme.

My family loved it and it is a great recipe for someone looking for gluten free fried fish. I did add a bit of garlic to the spinach and a lemon thyme seasoning to the corn meal.

This dish is excellent. Light and healthy with good flavor. I had trouble keeping the fish from sticking to the pan but probably didn't use enough butter (I didn't use a non-stick pan).

I made this with fresh, local fillets and this recipe really let the quality of the fish come through. I used a fine cornmeal, which created a nice crust. Will make again!

This wasn't good. It was extraordinary. I made some modifications to the recipe, but it probably would have been excellent as is. Still, if you're interested, here's what I did: Used red trout (that's all the market had today); omitted pepper, which I believe is inimical to the flavor of fish; added a bit of smoked paprika and a few spare grindings of nutmeg to the cornmeal; used a combo of butter and oil for the fish (and therefore didn't bother wiping out the pan); flipped the fish over so that the top too would become crunchy, and after a minute turned off the heat so that the fish would finish cooking without getting dry; for visual effect I sprinkled the pine nuts over the fish and the bits of spinach that stuck out from underneath it. It looked gorgeous. The flavors were rich and beautifully balanced, with nothing in excess. Our guests, one of whom is a superlative cook in her own right, said she'd be thrilled to have this in a restaurant.

This is an excellent easy recipe that actually gets my husband to eat and enjoy fish.

I love simple fish dishes, and this is simple and delicious. Nothing fancy, just yummy.

I revisited this recipe three years later. This time I loved it. I used flour to dust the trout before sauteing. I wilted the spinach in extra virgin olive oil to get flavor without overcoming the trout with garlic. Dark well-roasted pine nuts added just enough extra flavor.

I prepared the recipe for one person, cutting the spinach to one third . I substituted panko for the cornmeal. Basically it is a bit bland - I think because trout sautes better in oil. In the future, I would use olive oil or even just vegetable oil to fry the fish. The spinach was very good and the pine nuts do add texture. It is just that butter leaves the fish too fatty and dull.

Some have said this is bland, but I think it lets the mellow flavor of trout really shine. Combo of spinach and pine nuts nice. Like others, sauteed some garlic in the oil prior to adding spinach. Did them in separate skillets. Used half butter, half olive oil for the fish- and use whole trout. Served with new potatoes with parsley and butter - nice meal.

I actually wasn't all that impressed with this recipe. I think next time I'll do as another cook suggested and use panko or rice flour instead. I also added garlic to the cornmeal crust and used pink peppercorns. But the crunchiness of the cornmeal was not quite agreeable. However, the spinach and pine nuts (to which I added a couple of crushed garlic cloves, thinly sliced shallots, and squeezed out a few tablespoons of lemon juice to brighten the flavor a bit - was quite good.

This was really good! And I loved the texture from the cornmeal! I used steel-head trout and it was good. To toast the pine nuts, I put them in a shallow pan in 350 oven for about 10 minutes. It didn't take 50 minutes start to finish, it was much quicker! I would make it again!

I did indeed enjoy this idea in a pinch for somting to make with trout. For the spinach/ heating pan phase - i added cloves of garlic then discarded them after flavoring the oil also added some chopped fresh basil - i recommned trying fresh basil with most spinach saute. For the pine nuts (be sure to nbake them a tad) and trout i also used some tumeric and garlic. Final plate includes some craisins for color and breaks the taste up. If you dont have pine buts at home maybe try with what you have ie alomds or walnuts would probably be just as good if not better pending your tastes -

This recipe wins on simplicity alone. I put together a really great dinner in no time flat with this. So glad to have this one in the recipe box.

Very good. Corn meal adds nice crunch and texture. Added garlic, a few pepper flakes, a little lemon juice to the spinach for a little zip. There was no butter to drizzle as mentioned in the recipe. We will add something else to the fish/corn meal next time for a little more flavor. We will make again.

I found this one while looking for a recipe for the wild Walleye they had at the market this week. It worked very well. I used a box of frozen spinach combined with some fresh I had in the fridge and added several cloves of minced garlic to the olive oil for flavor. I used two skillets to speed up the prep and keep the spinach hot while I sauteed the fish. The fish absorbed all of the butter, so none left to drizzle, but the flavor was there.

Easy to prepare, extremely flavorful and a pleaser in looks and taste. Pine nuts add a great counterpoint to the fish and the spinach. Don't over salt the spinach as it shrinks fast and can become salty, also it pay to let the fish cook a bit longer

Easy and very good. Suggest a flavored oil for the spinach as well. Lemon a must. Recipe works well with salmon too.

Enjoyed the suggestion of sauteing the spinach with sesame oil and garlic. The cornmeal coating did indeed get crunchy. Salt and pepper are all that is needed to turn the dish from bland to subtly yummy.

Nice, light dish. We took a reviewer's suggestion and sauteed the spinach in sesame oil flavored with garlic. The sesame flavor blended well with the flavor of the spinach.

I haven't made this yet, but will make it tomorrow and rate it. Based ont eh reviews so far, I recommend sauteeing the spinach in sesame or walnut oil rather than regular oil for flavor adn maybe adding a bit of salt or soy sauce.

I made this dish using steelhead trout, a fish more akin to salmon than trout. It came out fine, and passed the "teenage boy test" in my family! I think I will add sliced garlic to the spinach next time, to give it a bit more "zing".

My husband thought this recipe was rather bland, I liked it. It was simple and uses a fish that we don't eat often.

I made this for a nice dinner for two and found it rather bland. The cornmeal didn't get particularly crunchy and had no taste and the spinach also had little taste. I made herbed rice on the side which made it a little nicer.

This was quite wonderful exactly as is... well, we'd have liked more spinach for the 4 of us. The flavor combination and the crunch of the cornmeal and the nuts were great. This is definitely a "make again" dish.
