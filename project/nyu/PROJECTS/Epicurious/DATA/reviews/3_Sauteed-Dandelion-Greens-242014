delicious! i squeezed a bit of lemon juice on at the end to brighten it a bit. also i only blanched the greens for about a minute and that seemed enough. this was my first time having dandelion greens and they were a big hit.

'twas alright. It's a "how to use dandelions" recipe, nothing more. I think the pepper flakes were a bit too hot, might be better with something more fresh and saucy. My husband didn't eat any and it lasted a while. Besides being bitter, the dandelions make you pee too. So I would only suggest this if you are eating it for the health benefits...

A splash of Balsamic vinegar went a loooong way to counteract the bitterness of the greens.

Wow - simple and delicious. So happy to find a recipe w/out bacon. Yum.

I am a dandelion devotee and especially when I am run down my body pines for these magical greens. Yes the stalks can be chewy. This recipe is a great basic guide. I usually start the recipe with lots of onion (sliced top to bottom not rounds). And let some of it nicely fry through. The other trick is to separate the stalks from leaves. Stalks can be broken to about 1" pieces and ensure to use only those that still pop and not too fibrous. Add stalks first (before the leaves) and stir it all in and add a little tamarind water, bring to boil then gently simmer about 10 minutes to tenderize stalks. Then add the leaves and continue with recipe. I often let everything cook tenderly for about 20 minutes and then uncover and let the oil kinda fry up the onions and greens (you may have to add some extra oil at the end). A little curry powder and turmeric (even lemon juice) can also do wonders if you are in the mood. Again on the stalks-- Yes the stalks are inherently chewy. We will just have to live with it in exchange for the miraculous goodness this wonder-green gives us. Thankful for dandelions.

I followed the recipe and the greens became an unrecognizable salty mush. I preferred it when boiled for 3-5 minutes w/ less salt and sauteed for 1-2 minutes. It had a subtle bitterness I enjoyed with a little more resemblance to dandelion greens.

This was my first taste of dandelions, and I was happily surprised since they are quite bitter raw. Quick and easy, it was a perfect side-dish to the linguine with red clam sauce.

One of the worst recipes I have ever made, incredibly bitter, and the spiciness did not go well with the bitterness.

I had never had dandelion greens before but this was delicious! Although I topped with a little of sesame oil for some extra flavour.

I used to prepare dandelion greens sauteed with garlic and pepper flakes. The blanching improves the recipe considerably.

This is simple and delicious, HOWEVER I tried a shortcut that didn't really work. I dislike blanching vegetables for nutritional reasons and avoid it, normally with no adverse reactions. In this case however, even though the dandelion greens looked cooked (and wonderful) after just a few minutes of sauteeing according to this recipe without any blanching at all, they really weren't. The stalks were chewy and crunchy to a fault (no problem with bitterness though). Next time, I still won't blanch them, but will braise them for maybe 10 minutes in the liquid that accumulates from the sauteeing, with a little water added. They need cooking.

Not a very good recipe to cover up the bitterness of the dandelion greens. If you enjoy the bitterness, this would be good but I didn

I received some dandelion greens in my last organic share batch. I wasn't sure what to do with them, but this recipe turned out to be a winner. Might use a little less salt the next time, though. Nice flavors for an unusual green.

Can't get enough of this stuff. Like spinach, you need lots raw to serve many cooked. Buy more than recipe calls for.

Very good, easy recipe. We used it last night & added the greens to a pasta dish with fettuccine and mushrooms, with tasty results.

Gorgeous and Addictive!

I haven't tried this one yet, but I will. I just wanted to make the comment that the 'bitterer' the green is, the more nutritional value it has.

I've made something similar to this over the last couple of years using various spring greens. Any green will do, and it's a great way to use tender spring turnip greens and beet greens, which people often discard rather than cook. Kale also works in this fashion. Other changes I like: try ramps in lieu of the garlic, and add a couple pinches of nutmeg.

I was unfamiliar with dandelion greens before this recipe and didn't realize quite how bitter they are! They were a very nice complement to the delicate black cod, but overall they are too bitter for me.
