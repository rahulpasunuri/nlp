I am the author of the recipe, so forgive me for giving this four forks. The onions were in the orignal recipe, but the test kitchen left them out when rewriting. I add them to the gravy and puree them into the gravy with a hand blender or in batches in a regular blender. I prefer a smooth gravy, hence the pureeing. Also, I wonder if the "pan" recipe salted the bird for too long, or inadvertently used too much salt? Isn't it odd how people get such different results? Finally, the thickness of a heritage turkey's skin DOES have an effect on the salting! I use an organic or supermarket "all-natural" bird for this recipe.

WOW! Despite the one review that panned this recipe, I tried it anyway and I'm sure glad I did. Moist, rich, smoky flavor in every bite. Every year I cook a large Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone told me this was by far the best turkey I have ever served. Highly recommended!

This is a great recipe! I used it last year in a family turkey competition and this recipe crushed the three other turkeys competing. The smoky flavor was evident in every bite, the salting method yielded a juicy bird, and the drippings from the turkey made an incredible gravy. Delicious!

This recipe yields a very tasty turkey that's sure to impress your family and friends. I made it for the first time in 2008 and it was a hit! I'm making it again this year with some twists that should make it even better. The gravy is almost unnecessary as the overnight salting, glaze and spices pack the bird with more than enough flavor. Try it with steamed potatoes using the pan juices and fresh parsley for an extra special accompaniment to the turkey.

This was delicious - not too salty at all. We did notice the onion addition was left out of the instructions - I also added them toward the end of the gravy cooking.

My three forks is an average. The first time I made this with a heritage turkey and was disappointed by how little of the smokey salt flavoring seeped into the bird. I just remade the recipe with a large roasting chicken and had much, much better results. It makes me wonder if the skin density difference between the two types of fowl makes a difference.

This was not the best turkey ever. It was OK!

This recipe was excellent - the turkey mosit and juicy - no salty taste just flavor, flavor, flavor. As for the gravy, we added the onions at the end just for the last couple of minutes of cooking.

I,too, tried this recipe and it was the first time I used a salted turkey recipe. However, I rinsed it well to remove all the salt before roasting it. At the same time, I was hesitant to roast it in an uncovered pan, so I did put it in an oven bag. I was very pleased with the results-- and so was my family. The turkey was moist and flavorful. My only problem was with the gravy recipe. The recipe never tells you what to do with the onions once you have carmelized them! I added them to the gravy at the end and it was fantastic.

This recipe went against everything I had learned about cooking turkey in regards to salt. BUT, it was from Bon Appetit so I decided to trust the recipe.I followed it exactly, and ended up with the saltiest, and driest turkey I have ever cooked. The drippings were inedible for gravy, as they weree MUCH to salty. I had to throw out my gravy and start all over again with broth minus any drippings. I baked a 14lb. turkey, and the only parts that were not too salty was the deepest part of the meat. So, from a 14lb bird, about 3 lbs. of it was edible, and flavorful. WHAT WERE YOUR TEST KITCHENS THINKING??? I WONDER IF YOU HAVE TEST KITCHENS! SO, in closing, thank you for making our families Thanskgiving memerable, for all the wrong reasons.

In the gravy part of the recipe, you're asked to saute onions and then set them aside, and they are never mentioned again. Should I assume they are added at the end with the turkey parts? Thanks for your help!
