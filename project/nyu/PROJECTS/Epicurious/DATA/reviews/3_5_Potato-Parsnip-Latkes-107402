I didn't have enough potatoes so added a sweet potato, too. Prob not enough parsnips either but hey. I def didn't have enough batter to make 16. I made 9. They tasted OK but the Garden Vegetables Latkes in here is a better recipe, I think. Maybe it's the carrots...

A few friends got together to do a "Chopped Cookoff" party and one of the ingredients was parsnips... Something that totally grossed me out, until I made these potato parsnip latkes. The only thing I changed up a bit, was I pan fried them in a little vegetable oil instead of baking in the oven. Pan fried until they were golden brown on both sides, then moved them to a paper towel to cool. They were absolutely yummy and I'm sure the reason my dish WON the cook off competition.

We loved these! I followed the recipe exactly (yes, it took longer to cook than the recipe states) and they turned out looking just like the photo. I served them with shredded Brussels sprouts with ginger and cranberries. They were really great leftover too. These are now officially in our regular in our rotation.

Very good! Made an excellent accompaniment to the recipe for Shredded Collard Greens and Pickled Apples on this site. A couple quick notes: * Yes, you'll need more than 1.5 minutes per side to cook the latkes. More like 3.5. Plan accordingly. * I subbed a finely chopped scallion for the fresh chives, as I had one on hand -- yum! * Quick tip: if your arm feels like it's going to fall off while you're grating the parsnips, try just using a vegetable peeler to shave lots of narrow strips. Then use your chef's knife or mezzaluna to chop them fine. The resulting coarse texture is inauthentic, but it gets the thumb's up from me. * If you've never made latkes before, you can absolutely make them ahead of your main course and keep them warm in the oven while you prepare the rest of your meal. They stay crisp! Cross my heart! :)

Excellent recipe, but definitely not like your grandma's latkes. Our family typically grated about half of the potato with the extra fine side of the grater, giving the latkes more of a pancake texture and less of a hash brown consistency that these latkes turned out to have. But for what these are, they are excellent. Word of caution -- if you let the batter sit for an hour or two, you will probably need to add a little more flour, as a lot of liquid will drain off of them.

This is one of the best latke recipes. Simple and flavorful with addition of parsnips. Some of the pickiest eaters (kids) even ask for more!
