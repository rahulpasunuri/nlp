I'm not sure why this got such good reviews. Even with the best quality ingredients (fresh caught salmon, fresh home grown herbs and tomatoes), my husband and I were still not impressed. I added extra herbs since some reviews said it was bland. This helped, but I think we just did not like the combination of flavors. The olives were overpowering--and we both love olives, but perhaps not with salmon...? Also the tomatoes seemed soggy and the skins started to wilt and peel in the pan. I think roasting them would be a better option than sauteing. Overall, we did not enjoy this meal and I will not make it again.

this is my first ever epicurious review, and this dish certainly earned it. I've made this recipe as-is about a half-dozen times and each time it's better than the last. it's a bit of a pain to put together and is time consuming, but well worth the effort.

I added white wine at the end of cooking the salmon. It made a glaze and kept it from browning too much. It turned out wonderfully and I would definitely make it again.

This was a hit with the family! I deviated from the recipe with a couple of little things. I took some other recommendations and used all fresh herbs, doubling what the recipe called for. Instead of purchasing salmon fillets, I used an entire wild caught salmon and cut my own fillets. I deglazed the pan in between fillets with vodka, and then added freshly squeezed lemon juice to the onions, olives and tomatoes at the end. Everyone loved the flavors in this recipe and I can see it easily becoming a family favorite!

This was an A+ from my family. I sauteed some spinach on the side and added as a layer between the orzo and the salmon, because I wanted a green. It didn't need it tho' -- the olive tomato melange more than sufficed.

I made this for my husband, and it was great. I doubled pretty much all the herbs after the complaints about too little flavor. Once I did that, it was great! I think the freshness of the herbs is a big part of whether or not this works.

Delicious and loved by all, vegetarian and meat-lovers alike!

Made exactly as written plus a few extra olives because I love them. Turned out incredible, really incredible. A definite hit and something I'll make over and over.

I had high expectations for this dish, but it was a big disappointment. The salmon was excellent, moist and evenly cooked - everything else was a big snooze. The orzo was bland; with all that rosemary you'd think some flavor would come through, but it didn't. And the tomatoe/olive mix would have been much better had it been uncooked - prepared at least and hour ahead of serving and chilled; prepared as written you couldn't tast the basil at all. If you want delicious salmon use the 3 sentences that tell you how to prepare it and scrap the rest of the recipe.

Delicious ! Not an olive fan so left them out. Also marinaded the tomatos like the earlier suggestion from TH39. Will def make this again

I made this dish exactly as it was written in the recipe. It came out decent. But I was disappointed that I could not taste much of the herbs. Even though I put tons of basil, the olives overpowered the basil and parsley. I will probably try to make this again without the olives. I put 2 tbs of rosemary and I barely tasted it in the orzo. Not sure why.

Made this recipe pretty much as written - everyone absolutely loved it! The rosemary is such a nice flavor to compliment the salmon, and it's so healthful. I will definitely make it again, and not change a thing!

The rosemary orzo was excellent. I used salmon steaks. I did the artichokes rather than the olives. Served with a spinach side and a light red. The fresh herbs are the key.

This recipe was a big hit-definitely a keeper. Followed the recipe except I did marinate the tomatoes similar to a previous reviewer. The salmon was complimented by the tomatoes, herbs & olives. I'd use any small pasta or rice with this dish. Even better, the leftovers were just as good when reheated the next day, not something I've found with fish very often.

C'mon people--a rating based on a recipe that bears no resemblance to the original really isn't very helpful. I'm all for creativity, but crab-stuffed salmon pinwheels??

Bland to the point of tasteless.

As an experienced cook I always follow the recipe the first time. After this experience I will not be making this again. Where did the flavor go? The ingredients list looked good but a lot of flavor got lost in the process. Just a rather bland dish with no apparent redeeming qualities,

We really enjoyed this. My companion doesn't care for olives so I substituted using quartered artichoke hearts as suggested by another reviewer. The fish market had crab stuffed salmon pinwheels and they were quite delightful. I added a bit of white wine to the tomato mixture. I had a cucumber salad with lemon tarragon vinegar with dill as a side. The flavors were perfect!

I made this last night..it was fantastic! to jazz up the tomatoes i marinated them in olive oil with a splash of balsamic vinegar, garlic, basil, and rosemary prior to cooking. I also did not have kalamata olives so used petite artichoke hearts......YUM.
