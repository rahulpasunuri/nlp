Liked the dish, minus the preserved lemon. Me and my guests thought it tasted like Pine Sol! But, we just picked out the little lemon pieces. Although I have had preserved lemon in restaurants (and liked it), I have never cooked with it. Perhaps the jar i bought just wasn't the best recipe! I am going to try to purchase or make preserved lemon, and see if that was the issue with this dish. Also, I just roasted the squash with EVOO, S&P then tossed it in before serving.

This is a really unusual dish. The preserved lemon adds a very tangy, strong flavor. I was startled when I tasted it -- I made it for the 1st time for a dinner party where I had guests coming some of whom were pregnant, some who kept kosher and some who were vegetarian -- it was good for that purpose.

Response to Essie who wanted advice on "how to handle the squash". Buy it already cubed in one pound bags (fresh) at Trader Joes. Even my local grocery has it plastic tubs. Cuts prep time I half.

Is this recipe ok for a main meal for a vegetarian? Also, how do you think it would taste with quinoa instead of couscous (I need it to be gluten free.) Thanks!

Had all ingredients on hand, made only one slight change- added cayenne pepper to squash before roasting, which added a great little kick. As many have said, do not substitute the preserved lemon- it really makes the dish. Yes, labor intensive, but 75 minutes from start to table was well worth it. My partner, not a great fan of squash or parsley, loved it. It was so filling and satisfying we had it for dinner on its own.

this is really delicious. added some cubed chicken for the carnivore hubby and ate it as a main dish. preserved lemons REALLY worth it. mark bittman has a quick easy version of lemons on nytimes.com.

Wow, this is so good. The combination of flavors were wonderful. I used Israeli couscous and homemade preserved lemon (recipe from this site). The preserved lemon has such a unique taste -- don't omit it. This makes a lot, more than 6 side servings, but the left over is just as good. This is definitely a keeper.

To: A Cook from NY. Go with a dry measuring cup not by weight. To add to the confusion, regular couscous is different from Israeli couscous. Israeli couscous is larger and round, not the pebbly looking couscous most of us are familiar with :)

I am confused. I have a question to those who have made this recipe. 1 3/4 cups of couscous is about 8 ozs. Do you use 1 3/4 cups or 1 lb (which would be 3 1/2 cups)? I am assuming that one goes with the cup measure not the weight measure. Am I right?

Delicious! We couldn't find preserved lemons nearby, so we used the zest of one lemon and half a lemon's juice. Other than that, we followed the recipe. It took longer than 15 minutes for my squash to caramelize, but it was worth the wait. I was skeptical about this recipe--it sounds like all the other couscous/bulgar/rice salads out there, but it was really good. I'm sure it will be better with preserved lemon, but its fine without in a pinch.

Delicious, virtuous, gorgeous. Brought to a potluck. Made a few substitutions: 1 small butternut squash (12 oz after peeling and seeding), 2 small sweet potatoes (1/4 inch diced, then steamed just until tender), ~3/4 C craisins instead of raisins, a mix of pine nuts and pistachios, and about 4 oz each of coarsely ribboned arugula and baby spinach instead of parsley.

Sweet, sour, nutty... a really great combination of subtle yet complex flavors and textures. I love that it was simple and healthy. I made a couple of variations: slivered almonds instead of pine nuts and half the amount of raisins (not a huge fan) and it was perfect. I forgot about the cinnamon stick and adding the ground cinnamon at the end and it was still delicious. I'm definitely making this again.

this was delicious!i used toasted slivered almonds instead, and I left out the raisins because I did not have any, and it was still very good. Deep complex flavors of sweet and salty and roasted. Yum!

A terrific party dish, especially if you can find Israeli couscous and have good-quality preserved lemon. My guests went crazy for this. The make-ahead directions work out great. But be warned: the proportions in the recipe are kind of screwy, so you need to assemble to taste. If not lemony enough for you, add some of the preserved lemon brine. Toasted slivered almonds OK as an affordable substitute for pine nuts. Yield is VERY high, way more than 6 servings!

My husband said this was the best couscous he's ever had and he is a gourmet cook himself ( and doesn't hand out compliments easily). I pretty much followed the recipe ( unusual for me) except I did use whole wheat couscous ( from the Kosher section of the grocery). This is a wonderful combination of flavors.

Rating: 4
Fabulous dish for company, easy to make, and very attractive to look at. I used 3/4 cup of shallots instead, because I was using a lot of onions for another dish. I didn't have a cinnamon stick and it tasted just fine. I don't see the point of boiling a big pot of water and draining the couscous. I just boiled 4 1/2 cups of chicken broth, added the couscous, and let it simmer until done, then added everything else. I don't know what a preserved lemon is, but I just grated enough peel and saved the juice.

There are so many different flavors in this dish and they all complement themselves so well. It's a great meal to make on the weekend (the recipe actually makes a ton), then save the leftovers to bring in to work for lunch. It keeps and reheats very well.

Excellent salad. I made this exactly, including the preserved lemons which I believe make it special. (The lemons are easy to make, just just need to think a few weeks ahead.) It is very easy and does not take 3 hours. High flavor profile, low fat, can be prepared in advance, inexpensive and will send any Vegetarian into tail spins.

I am a carnivore, but vegan recipes can be wonderful. Many are labor intensive, but this one is easy. Made this exactly as written. I even had the preserved lemons which are perfect in this preparation. This is the kind of recipe you put your fork into and don't stop eating until it's all gone. A definte keeper!

Yum! I made a few modifications to this recipe. I used cashews instead of pine nuts (highly recommended) and instead of a preserved lemon I added the juice of one Clementine along with some of its zest(mostly because I didn't have a lemon in the house). I also added the raisins and cashews directly to the onions in the saute pan to plump up the raisins and make the cashews a bit softer. The recipe is more or less fool proof (hence four forks) and provides an interesting and healthy deviation from my usual couscous faire.

Used regular lemon juice, cranberries and almonds instead of raisins. Pretty simple and easy dish--perfect for an autumn side dish or as an entree for veggie folks!

I thought the couscous was a little overcooked at 10 minutes - I would undercook them for more of an al dente bite. Also thought the preserved lemon peal was too much. Made my own preserved lemons for this and next time would probably just sub some lemon zest and juice instead.

This was interesting. I was looking forward to use the preserved lemon--something different. The dish was good, but it didn't wow me for the time and effort involved.

YUM!! I didn't have preserved lemon so I sliced a lemon very thin and sauteed it with kosher salt and sugar until translucent - then let it cool - diced the lemon and used everything in the pan -- I substituted a mix of yellow raisins, dried cranberries, blueberries and cherries and used pistachios instead of pine nuts -- oh and I also topped off the couscous with some lemon zest. YUM! Beautiful and delicious.

WOW..this is awesome..I followed the recipe. when i found I only had a 1/2 cup parsley so i added 1/2 cilantro to complete the measurement. I threw the raisins in with the coucous like 1 min before draining to plump them a little.. we couldn't stop eating it. every bite had a new layer of taste

We love this dish. I make my own preserved lemons, and if I can't find butternut squash I'll substitute sweet potatoes -- diced and boiled until just cooked, still firm.

I already did a review (very positive, have shared with many who also love this) but would like to add for those with questions, be sure NOT to overcook the squash. It keeps quite well and is very good days later, however the pinenuts aren't as crunchy. So if you are going to hold it over, add them just before serving. For leftovers, save some pinenuts to add at later servings.

Made this for a middle eastern potluck family dinner. I used less couscous and more of the rest of the ingredients. I roasted the cubed squash, and added a mixture of cranberries and golden raisins which looked great and tasted wonderful. Everyone LOVED it. It is very flavorful with the additions.

I was looking for a recipe to use up the jar of preserved lemons lurking in the back of the fridge- this ended up being a nice weekday meal. I subbed dried cranberries and the colours were very pretty. If you like these kinds of salads, I can recommend Moosewood's series of cookbooks.

Awesome! Yes, of course it's best as written (preserved lemons, etc.), but the taste-labor ratio is better with the quick version: a few squirts of real lemon juice from one of those fake plastic lemons will give the lovely (and necessary) flavor, and either the cinn stick or the ground cinn but no need for both. Any advice on how to manage the squash?

I made this almost exactly as written as a way to use the preserved lemons I made before Christmas.Most wonderful! I agree that it is a sophisticated dish, so everyone might not like it as well as we did. I did add more cinnamon & more preserved lemon juice. It made enough for 8 generously. I plan to make it again this weekend as an accompaniment for lamb shanks prepared "tagine style."

Excellent. A bit of work for an after work dinner but if prepared in stages I'm sure it would be a snap. Served with lamb chops to rave reviews.

This is a great, healthy dish. I would eliminate the lemon juice (the lemon peel adds plenty of citrus), and cut the parsley in half.

This was a fabulous dish with a moroccan style lamb and curried lentils. I did add a second entire box of Israeli couscous without doubling the other ingredients and it made enough for 7 people with ample leftovers and had plenty of spice. My guests raved about it.

Great recipe with great flavor. You can make your own preserved lemons. Its not difficult. Layer with non iodized salt. Many recipes are out there for how to do it. I use a recipe from my Mediteranean cookbook. I do slice my lemons though.

I was so excited to find a recipe for the preserved Meyer lemons I made last week. Good thing we loved this side dish because it looks like we will be eating these leftovers for a while as the recipe probably serves AT LEAST eight and I made only 2/3 of the recipe! This was a nice accompaniment for lamb chops with cumin, cardamom and lime (recipe also on this site). I don't usually like to comment on a recipe if I haven't prepared it exactly like it is in print first; however, I think the variety of nut used does not dramatically affect the overall flavor of the recipe. That being said, I, for once, didn't have any pine nuts so I used pistachios (a fave in this house and regionally appropriate).

I made this last night to rave reviews. I used regular couscous--I could not find the Israeli couscous or anything comparable. And, I didn't have a preserved lemon, so I didn't use any citrus at all. Nevertheless, this was a delicious side dish, particularly for the fall. My guests thought the squash was some kind of fruit--the roasting carmelized the sugar in the squash and made it so good! I'd definitely do this one again.

Made this last night with Moroccan Grilled Chicken and they went really well together. Had a hard time finding preserved lemon - ended up buying "pickled lemon," from Thailand. Is this the same thing? The pickled lemon is yummy, regardless, though I would use two instead of just one next time - they were pretty small. I do agree that it was labor intensive, but worth it.

I'm giving this two forks because I was the only person who at this dish and thought it was great. My husband wasn't thrilled; my guests ate a little, then pushed it around thier plates. (I suspect, however, that it was a little too exotic for their palates.) I used acini di pepe. My husband's big complaint was not about the flavors, but about the texture. He stated that the "couscous" was too big, thus overwhelming the other ingredients. Honestly, I immediately saw his point. Next time, I'm going to make it with regular couscous. I think we'll both be happy, then. Word of warning. You may want to reconsider this dish if you're unsure of your guest's tolerance for "different" food. (And that is a direct quote!)

This is delicious. One person said this was the best "one of those salads" (meaning, basically, a pasta.ric.grain salad) she had ever had. I don't know what happened to that first reviewer from BC--maybe she did something wrong. This salad is fabulous. If you make it for a party, double or triple the recipe--people go back for fourths and fifths!

I was going to cook dinner and impress my boyfreind. What a mistake going with this recipe. The lemon made it harsh, and it wasn't very good. He said there was something wrong with it, but it didn't know what it was. I don't know what it was either, but I wouldn't waste my time peeling, chopping, and roasting the squash, let alone preparing the couscous again.

Absolutely fabulous. My favourite kind of comfort food. And the leftovers (not many, I must admit) are delicious warmed up in the microwave. Used even more squash than the recipe calls for--a whole 2.5 lb squash, cut into half-inch dice. Fairly labour intensive, but definitely worth it. As mentioned by others, the preserved lemons really make it.

This is a delicious, sophisticated and colorful side dish that takes a bit of time to make, but is worth it. It's a dish that goes especially well with roast or sauteed chicken and broiled or baked fish. I've made it three times now and each time I've received numerous compliments from our dinner guests. The preserved lemon put me off making this dish, as I could not find it ready made. So, I made it myself using an easy recipe for "Seven Day Preserved Lemon" from epicurious.com. The preserved lemon is also delicious w/sauteed fish or veal and we even use it for Bloody Marys! A little of it goes a long way, as it is quite salty. The Israeli couscous is available (here in California) at Wild Oats, Whole Foods and other upscale grocery stores.

GREAT recipe. Labor intensive at first - have a friend cut the squash. Key lime juice was an OK substitute for preserved lemon, but Jeff Smith's recipe in "Immigrant Ancestors" is too easy NOT to make. Use the Pea sie Israeli couscous - much better than the BB size. Once I added a box of fr. peas right at the end of cooking cooscous - colorful and yet another taste surprise. I made the recipe for 6 - good to have the recipe for 50. Great vegetarian choice.
