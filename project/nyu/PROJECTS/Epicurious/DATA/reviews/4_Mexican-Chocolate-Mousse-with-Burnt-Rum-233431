a fan favorite and annual request for Christmas. It takes a long time to dissolve the chocolate. I still haven't figured out the best way to ignite (last year I accidentally stirred in the rum before lighting it and not enough burned off-mousse had to be taken away from young nieces)

I haven't made this but just wanted to point out that if "Mexican chocolate" means something like Ibarra chocolate (or even Nestle's Abuelita), then it comes with a LOT of granulated sugar. That means you won't get nearly the same result if you use an equal amount of regular dark chocolate. Basira from 3/26/2001, this is probably why you ended up with an oily film. Depending on which website you look at for nutrition info, Ibarra is 72% sugar by weight. Ie Ibarra chocolate is just under three quarters sugar by weight. If you are using dark chocolate as a substitute, you would need to add sugar to compensate. For this recipe which calls for 18.6 oz Mexican chocolate, this works out to about 7.7 oz of 72% chocolate and 10.9 oz sugar (or just over 1.5 cups sugar). The other thing "Mexican chocolate" has is cinnamon, but I don't know how much.

This is a fun food to make and delicious. Although I prepared well, read all the notes and thought it would be acceptable to use Ghirardelli chocolate I think it was the chocolate that caused a strange oil surface after the flambe. I tried to drain it all but there was always more. The result is that flavor is fine and it is a little runny. I added a little cinnamon to help it become Mexican and that went well. Wondering if any of you more experienced, seasoned cooks know why oil developed. Next time I will use the Mexican chocolate.

Big hit at supper club. Make sure to blend all that rum & let the mixture cool completely, so the whip cream can do its job. Had a hard time finding Mexican chocolate, so went with 60% cacao Spanish chocolate, which was fine. Added Mexican vanilla to the whip cream-very good!

I made this following the directions to a T and thought it was very good. Surprisingly easy, and the flaming rum was a fun factor. Next time, I may try another liquor just for comparison. One note - I visualized the Ibarra chocolate as coming in a bar shape, so passed it by in MANY a store before I realized it comes in a hexagonal cardboard box.

oh and have a really long spoon, those flames really jump up. make sure the chocolate is cooled before mixing with the whip cream or it will get runny. Make sure the bowl and whip cream are chilled before mixing, this helps it whip better. Heavy whipping cream holds better and stiffer than regular. make sure the whipping cream is whipped enough before adding. dont overmix when folding them together, this will deflate it. Its ok if it has streaks, its kinda pretty that way, no one will know it was by accident.

I absolutely loved this recipe, It is pretty rich and the rum is pretty intense (not a kids dessert), so it really needs the whip cream (don't sweeten) on top and cookies for balance. The cookies are a perfect accent, Its not nearly as good without them. Its a simple and easy recipe, I made it for Christmas last year and everyone asked for the recipe.

Pretty good. Just not a huge fan of the Mexican Chocolate flavor. Easy dish to make and there is a flame!

I didn't expect the fire I got from the rum. Watch out. I made it into a mousse pie using ground choco waffers as my shell. A bit too rummy, but maybe I just didn't let enough rum burn off?

Good, fun to make. I just slipped on an "Ove Glove" and stirred with my metal tongs. May try with regular chocolate and bourbon next time. Didn't have time to make the cookies, but will definitely try them soon.

This dessert was outstanding! I made it for a party of 13 and had plenty. It came together very quickly the night before, I put it in a large bowl and served from that to conserve fridge space. Next time I would cut the rum down to 1/2 cup. I liked the flavor, however it was a bit overpowering after 4 or 5 spoon- fuls. I have been eating the leftovers by dipping the cinnamon almond cookies into the bowl and snacking on that. The cookies definitely add the extra touch you need to complete this recipe.

Made this mousse last weekend after reading the reviews. Used Ibarra chocolate and followed the recipe exactly. OMG, it is delicious. Turned out spectacularly! Makes alot though and I ate more than my share! Did also torch a wooden spoon but, small price to pay! I stirred the flaming rum for about a minute before it went out and it was still pretty alcohol-y tasting, but good. My family LOVED it. My work loved it. Don't pass on this distinctive, easy, elegant recipe. Oh, never got to the cookies. Weren't needed!!

Like all the other reviews, this is an incredibly easy and incredibly delectable dessert. I served it at a Mexican food theme party and it was a hit! I had quite the flames blazing, too. After reading reviews, I will have to try the saucepan next time.

YUM. This was so good and a nice change from regular chocolate mousse. I halved the recipe and it made four generous servings (my kind of serving!). I took a cue from other reviewers and made this in a skillet rather than a saucepan. I had no trouble with the rum doing it this way. I think it worked out exactly like it should - it flamed for a bit and as I continued to stir but gradually subsided and I was left with a just slightly caramelized rum flavor. Perfect! I did not have the long fireplace matches so I used a wooden match held in kitchen tongs which worked out just as well.

Just made this for a Mexican potluck tonight. It was great, but very rich. Read all the previous reviews and tried a couple of things. First, I added the rum in small doses, lit it and mixed it in, so didn't have quite the bonfire and this did not appear to affect the flavor. Second, I used a silicone spoon (actually called a spoonula..part spoon, part spatula) because it won't burn. Worked fine but the silicone is somewhat discolored now. For lighting the rum, I used one of those little butane torches (we use for lighting campfires at the beach). It had a long enough reach and stayed lit for me. I used Ibarra Mexican chocolate, which is wonderful. Had a little trouble finding it (in So. Cal...go figure). Had to transport it to the potluck, so used glass coffee mugs rather than a footed glass, so easiear to pack up and move. The cookies were OK, but I might try snickerdoodles next time. That was my experience. Everyone loved the dessert. The rum flavor is very evident, so if that is not your thing, you might try using less. Thanks to all who made comments previously; they were very helpful.

This mousse was very good but mine was a little strong on the rum flavor. I was prepared and lit the rum which flamed for about a half second and went out before I could even stir. I am not sure it burned off enough of the alcohol taste. However, my guests thought it was wonderful so that's what counts.

A Cook from MI on 02/13/07 Delicious!!! Made it for a dinner party. Doubled the recipe and made it into a trifle layering it with the whipped cream, and ending with the whipped cream. For garnish toasted sliced almonds and grated unsweetened chocolate. With some of the cookies, I put it around the inside of the bowl,on an angle, standing on end. Put the trifle on a larger glass plate and put the rest of the cookies around it. Also, since some of our company had soy allergies, I used 3-10oz. bags of semi-sweet chocolate without the soy lecithin and almost 2-4oz. bars of unsweetened chocolate with approx. 3 drops of cinnamon oil. Would have loved to taste it with Mexican chocolate. If it tasted soooo delicious this way I know it would with the Mexican chocolate!! Will definitely make this again....and with Mexican chocolate!!!!

So simple and yet so delicious! The combination of the Mexican chocolate and light rum makes for a scrumptious dessert, even without the cookies. I simply served with berries on the side. All were licking the glasses. Sweet, but not too much so. Highly recommend this mousse! I made per the recipe.

This was a hit with my future in-laws at a pre-holiday dinner. My first time hosting them. I think they licked the martini glasses...

This was wonderful! My mom and I made it for Christmas Eve dinner last year because we wanted to try something new for the holidays. We served it in martini glasses and it was very elegant. A small amount goes a long way which is really nice if you're feeding a lot of people. In fact, we are big eaters but I thought the serving size was actually too big -- and I never feel that was about dessert! The only tricky part was stirring the concoction while it was flaming. I used a very long heavy-duty (I thought)plastic spoon and I felt like my arm would catch on fire and the spoon actually melted around the edges!!! A wooden spoon would burn and a metal spoon would damage a non-stick pan, so what is one to do? Any ideas?

I made this for the first time this weekend and thanks to the reader reviews, was prepared for the flames, or so I thought. Still ended up with flames that reached the cabinets and setting off the smoke detectors in my house (both of them) so not sure what can be done to make that not happen next time ... any suggestions?

Have now made this 3 times, usually halving the recipe. But now I melt the chocolate in a skillet (I use a 6 or maybe 8 inch cast iron one). Seems to work just fine - and SO much easier to light the rum . . . .

Rating: 3
Delicious. I served it over brownies with a bit of kalua (I couldn't find cinnamon cookies so it had to do). My guests were delighted all the same. I would recommend going a bit light on the rum as well, it does play very strongly in the taste of the mousse. Additionally, as with all others, be careful of the flame, its fun but it definitely gets going.

I don't make desserts usually but had a "formal" Valentines dinner and decided to make this one after reading all the reviews...This is an AMAZING dessert! I used Ibbara chocolate and added a bit of cinnamon. The burnt rum makes this really unique and delicious...I would agree with the other reviewers on the flame concern. After lighting this on fire there was a HUGE flame...so much so that it burnt the wooden spoon I was using...so, be careful! It's worth making even with the danger factor! Oh, and do serve with the cinnamon cookies...a great combo.

Very good and the Mexican chocolate had great flavor. Next time I think I would halve the amount of rum called for, but that's only because I realized that I don't love the taste of rum. The almond cookies are excellent and easy - almost like little biscotti and just as good with coffee as with the mousse.

I made 2/3 the recipe to serve eight people and that worked well, except that I needed much more than 1/3 cup milk to melt the Mexican chocolate. At higher altitudes liquids evaporate more quickly, so I used more milk--perhaps 3/4 cup--and it turned out beautifully, though it took a very long time for the sugar in the Mexican chocolate to dissolve. I also highly recommend the cinnamon almond cookies to serve with this.

Delicious, supper easy, and the guests loved it! I halved the recipe and got 6 good-sized potions out of it. Served it in small antique liquor glasses.

Ridiculously easy and eye-crossingly good! Multiple food-gasms from this one. My only addition was about a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. And the fire added a layer of danger that just amped up the enjoyment!

Oh yeah, and I second previous poster re need to be careful lighting this. I wondered if it could be cooked in a flat skillet instead of deeper saucepan (but perhaps this would alter chocolate cooking?). Sure would be safer/easier to flame. I had no long matches so struck a short one to a 6 inch wooden skewer. When I was trying to relight THAT the mixture burst into flames. Fortunately I DIDN'T singe my hair or anything else. Fireplace match definitely required here. . .

I made this for a small dinner party last week and it was a big hit. I had a box of Mexican chocolate I brought back from Oaxaca that I'd been meaning to use. Halved the recipe and it worked perfectly.

This is very very good--my guests LOVED it. Note to the clumsy (like me): beware when you light the rum. I made a beautiful fireball that rose above the pan, danced in front of my eyes, then singed my hair. Other than that minor detail, the mousse is very very good. We are making it again for XMas Eve Dinner--with flame retardant clothing, natch.

I think I didn't burn the rum off completely enough and it had a strong alcohol taste that was a bit too much for me. I'd advise that people really let the rum burn off - don't stir too quickly. Otherwise - the Mexican chocolate flavor was divine!

To the question about Mexican chocolate, it is basically bitter sweet chocolate with sugar and cinnamon added in. It is more grainy than regular chocolate. Add a little of each to the recipe till you find an amount you like.

This is an amazing chocolate mousse. I am a pastry chef in Portland, and this mousse sells out constantly. I make it just as the recipie suggests (which is very unusual for me), along with the cinnamon-almond cookies. These cookes are also fabulous. I always have to make twice as many for the staff to nibble on when I'm not looking. I highly reccommend this recipe to all. It is simply and will blow your mind.
