I brushed the pound cake layers with a Marsala simple syrup and instead of making the frosting listed, I made Ganache. Delicious and easier!

The recipe needs changes for us to make it again but worth another try. The icing was too runny-cut down on liquid-and there was way too much. Needs more cherries. Would also recommend cutting the brown edges off the pound cake.

Take your time when making this recipe. It is delicious and worth the effort. Many happy folks at our party!

I used dried cherries in place of the currants. I would not leave any of the ingredients out, if I had a choice. While it could be made without the cherries, it won't be as fabulous. I took it to a New Year's party and got raves.
