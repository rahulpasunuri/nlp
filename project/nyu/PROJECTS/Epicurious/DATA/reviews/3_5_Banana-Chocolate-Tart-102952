I've made some amazingly decadent desserts and everyone seems to love this one the best. It's beyond easy peasy to make and incredibly tasty. I've been making it on a regular basis for 10 years. The key to making the crust buttery and easy to cut with the chocolate melted is to melt the butter so it's literally a liquid. I then mash the graham crackers, butter, sugar and salt in a large plastic bag. The melted butter gives the entire pie a completely different texture and over all of creamier (but not over whelming taste) that's easy to cut through. A good friend is a chef who trained at Johnson & Wales Culinary School - this is his favorite dessert.

Real graet and simple recipe. I used a healthy crust 1 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, 2 TBSP of milk and 1/2 cup of olive oil directly mixed in a pie pan. The recipe become easier, healthier and better ! Great tart ...

Simple, and good. The kids love this. It's like a banana-fudge sundae. I followed the recipe exactly except for the rum, with good results, but I think it would be even better if I were to sprinkle some toasted nuts on top at the last second. That would make it even more like a banana-fudge sundae.

We really didn't like this and ended up throwing most of it out. That said, I may have done it in by making it in advance and refrigerating it. The bananas were brown (of course), but I also think that the crust and chocolate were adversely affected, given others' descriptions of a delicious warm crust. So, if you're going to do this, it's probably best to serve it immediately.

This is an exquisite dish that really tickles your tastebuds. The warm, moist crust combined with the bananas (we tossed ours in hazelnut liquor instead of preserves) makes this dish like no other dessert imaginable. A sure attraction to cooks everywhere!

This recipe proves that something so simple can be so delicious and look absolutely elegant at the same time! I plan to repeat this one many times over.

I made a few changes. I used 2 tbl. less butter in the crust and incressed the crumbs. I also used splenda in the crust. I put fresh strawberry on the outer ridge of the crust then bananas then a strawberry rose(I made it out of a strawberry) in the middle. I used my homemade strawberry mint jam instead of the apricot to coat the fruit. VERRY YUMMY! Kids loved it.

You can still use the rum even if you have diners that can't imbibe. Take twice the amount called for in the recipe, heat in a saucepan over high heat and reduce it by half. Chill it well (as you're whipping it into heavy cream) and proceed. The alcohol burns off and the flavor actually becomes a bit more intense.

My whole family loved this recipe. I didn't add rum as I had children in the family who are fond of desserts. We thought it was still delicious. I would like thoughts of other cooks as well, i.e. if they think omitting rum makes a difference?

I made this last night for some dinner guest. I loved it and I hope they did too.

What a breeze. Definitely use chocolate graham crackers to give the tart a little more rich. Be careful not to put too much rum into the whipped cream - I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect, but too much will overpower the flavor of the bananas. I HATE baking and will definitely make this again!

This was so easy and outstanding, but I made a few changes. For the crust I used 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs with 2 Tbsp sugar and 4 Tbsp canola oil. Then I sprayed the top with butter flavored cooking spray and got a good result. Next, after adding the chocolate chips to the crust, I returned it to the oven for about 45 seconds and it was easy to spread. Lastly, I tossed the bananas with 1/4 cup orange marmalade and 2 Tbsp rum. Skipped the cream. This is faster than making banana bread and is a great alternative for using up overripe bananas!!

Delicious and easy to make. I had trouble spreading the chocolate, even WITH a metal spoon dipped in hot water. The tart was even better the next day. A definate repeater!

Unbelievably good. I used chocolate graham crackers for the crumbs. I, too, think it would be great with strawberries or raspberries.

I love chocolate and made a big mistake in halfing again the amount of chocolate chips called for... my teeth still hurt it was so sweet. A good recipe and I imagine it would be excellent with other fruits as well (i.e. strawberries).

My husband and I nearly ate the whole thing between us and it was so easy to prepare. I didn't have any trouble spreading the chocolate, but it was really soft before I tried.

What a snap to make. It was perfect as a last minute throw together dessert. The crust was a little crumbly, but delicious. Next time I would use a metal spoon dipped in very hot water to spread the chocolate so it doesn't tear up the crust.
