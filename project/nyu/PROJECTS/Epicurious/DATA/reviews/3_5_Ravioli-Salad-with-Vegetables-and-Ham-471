The second time I made this I substituted 1 tsp. dried oregano and 1/2 tsp. dried basil for the rosemary and liked it much better. I also added some marinated artichoke hearts and used roasted red peppers. A great way to use leftover ham in the summer!

A great recipe for parties -- I am always asked to bring this! I doubled the recipe this time that I made it, but seemingly didn't have enough dressing which left the pasta (here, tortellini) a little dry. I did do the vinegar increase/oil decrease adjustment, but maybe that wasn't so hot an idea. I also may toss with half, and then toss with other half of dressing right before serving.

Very good! Sub ham for chicken and added chopped roasted almonds for a nice added crunch, did not have sugar handy so I used maple syrup. It was a hit!

Yummy delicious! Made it for hubby and ate it myself - we almost fought for the last serving. Will be making it again soon

To the reviewer from Albuquerque, NM : the fact that the author of this recipe is from Artesia, NM is irrelevant.

This recipe was a great way to use left over baked ham. However I highly recommend that you use small-sized ravioli instead of the larger sized...it makes for a better "bite sized" meal.

Tasted great! Modifications: 1. I used both tortellini and spinach-cheese filled ravioli 2. Added palm hearts--but I don't think that either of those was really a major change. Husband and I both loved it. . .might add more vinegar though next time.

This salad is delicious -- far better than deli pasta salad, and so easy. I substituted 3-cheese tortellini for the ravioli, and used a 10 oz. jar of marinated mushrooms (we love mushrooms). Also used 1/2 the oil called for and upped the vinegar slightly -- there still was plenty of marinade. This will be a summer staple (and was awfully good in January, too).

Why on EARTH would Epicurious go to Artesia, NM for a recipe? (I'm from there so I have a right to hate it.) I'm surprised this dish doesn't call for cream of celery soup.

Awesome! I made this for work and it is selling like crazy! Although, I substituted pepperoni for the ham, roasted red peppers, and fresh mushrooms instead of marinated. This is very versatile.

i also have made this salad. I went over very well at a 50th birthday party. Very easy to make. I also found dill marinated mushrooms at my local store, this add a nice touch to the salad compared to the first time I made it.

Loved this salad. Have doubled & tripled also. Have added artichoke hearts instead of mushrooms.

Really great for pot-luck. I used smoked turkey breast instead of ham and the smoked flavor of the meat added a nice complement to the ravioli.
