I first saw the picture of this dish in Gourmet's Annual Compendium (I think for 1999), and it looked so impressive, but difficult! I made it this weekend and it was surprisingly simple. The next time I make it, I'll make twice as many because they disappeared! Also, I prepared all of the "ingredients" the night before, and rolled them several hours in advance of my dinner party so when guests arrived, I simply had to slice and serve. I didn't make the sauce and I think it would have been too much and overpowered the sweetness of the crab. I used the Romanoff black and red caviar ($5.00 jar) that our local Publix grocery store in Florida carries and it was perfect. The colors are beautiful, the dish was tasty, and it was impressive.
