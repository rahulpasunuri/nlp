wow just read peoples reviews. Chop the anchovies real fine or puree them. there an important ingredient and not over powering at all. Don't tell finicky eaters what's in the dish. They will like it . also adjust the ingredients by taste after you follow the recipe. I remember now I did that

Yummy , will make again. Served it with two other salads , good bread,good cheese and good wine. Healthy and delicious. But, I didn't have Sherry vinegar so I used lemon- it worked. Next I'll use the vinegar and see which I like best

If you like anchovies, and I do, this is a high end mixture of flavours. Served with a strong meat and some salads it's a perfect combo.

This was simply not good. Blah. Blech. Not at all interesting, and not an integrated blend of flavors. And I like just about everything!
