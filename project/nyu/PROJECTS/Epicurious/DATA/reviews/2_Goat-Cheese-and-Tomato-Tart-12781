Made these as mini tarts for a party and they disappeared....Very strong flavor when made as a quiche, I like it better with more crust to filling. I used a refrigerated pie crust for the quiche and it was great. Also, I didn't saute the tomatoes, I oven dried them instead (olive oil, salt and pepper). The flavor was fabulous.

This tart is very bland. I doubled the herbs and added salt and pepper to the custard, and my family still felt it was not very flavorful.
