These were a LOT of work but quite tasty. I have a set of mini tart tins and I used those instead of a mini-muffin pan. This required rolling out the dough. This dough goes soft super fast and I could barely keep it refrigerated enough but it was worth it as it didn't stick to the tart pans. I found the lemon kind of overwhelmed the blueberry a bit more than I would have liked. I was making these for my daughter's school's teacher appreciation day and the school has a no nut policy so I swapped out oatmeal for the toasted almonds in the crumble. Somehow, I wound up with MUCH less filling than I needed. Even doubling the filling didn't give me enough to use up all the dough. Maybe because I was rolling the dough out, it was thinner than they expect or maybe the tartlets hold more filling than a mini-muffin. I was going to drizzle white chocolate over the top or use chopped white chocolate chips in the crumble but since these were an early morning dish, I wound up not doing it...there's always next time as I'd probably do this again despite all the work. Thanks to everyone who warned me about the proportion of dough needed for crumble being too high. Even with halving it, I wound up with excess crumble! Good thing it's tasty - I'll make dessert with it later this week!

Yes, it's labor intensive, but the work is worth it if you're giving them as a gifts. I've made these to give to co-workers at Christmas-time twice now, and both times they were very well-received. Like other reviewers, I only found it necessary to set aside 3/4 cup of the dough for the topping. Also added another tsp of lemon juice this time, which I think was an improvement.

Made this in a bar form in an 8x8 pan. I used 2 cups fresh blueberries since it is the season now and I love blueberries! Added 1 tsp of corn starch to the filling as well to help it set. I would increase that to 2 tsp next time. As for the base crust, I blind baked it for 15 minutes and let it cool before putting on the filling and the crumble topping. The crust was delicious, just sweet enough as a contrast to the wonderful lemony blueberry filling. The almonds are an extra nice touch.

I haven't tried making these yet but plan to do so for a bridal luncheon. "Intransfer from Seattle" how much cream cheese did you add to the batter. I figure a little cream cheese can only make a good thing better! Did you adjust any other ingredients to compensate for the cheese?

I made this a few years ago as the mini-muffins, and it was good but far too labor intensive. This time I decided to do it as a bar cookie, doubling the recipe to make a 9x13 inch pan. I really liked it, though next time I will use the full recipe amount of dough for the crumble top rather than the smaller amount used by some reviewers. I ended up with a really thick bottom and just barely enough crumble. I cut them in really small pieces - around 1x2 inches, for a great bite or two. Got rave reviews at work today, so all is well. :)

Since discovering this recipe, I've made it 4 times in the last month. A fantastic table addition for brunch. I add cream cheese to make it a bit more rich.

Very good, but labor intensive. I made a second batch as a bar cookie and it was great. Do everything the same, but in a square pan and cut when cooled.

Made this for coworkers at Christmas. Everyone very, very pleased, including myself. Followed recipe exactly. Will make again.

These are delicious! I agree with the other comments concerning the amount of reserved topping. I think that 1 1/3 cups of the dough should be used for the base and the remainder used for the top with the almonds added. I think the amount of almonds could be reduced. I had to use part of the topping (with the almonds added) for the base and that worked fine. One of these days I will learn my leasson and read the reviews before I make a dish!

This is a great recipe. I would be careful with how much of the blueberry stuff you add in. If you add too much, it will squish out. Overall, great recipe.

Great recipe. It was a big hit. Next time I'll have to hide a few for myself. I agree that too much dough is allocated for the topping. I tried it with a filling of fresh cherry preserves mixed with dried cherries. I also used a couple more teaspoons of sugar because I used sour cherries.

These were really popular. I had no trouble with the recipe or getting the cookies out of the tins. In fact, I made them without a food processor, just used the same technique I use for making pie crust. I doubled he recipe as it only makes 24 and found out that way to much dough is allocated for the topping. Not a big deal, just allocate about half what the recipe calls for. Also, using a dark pan makes them cook much, much more quickly, watch out. Really cute, and even better a day or so later, properly stored. Less crumbly, but the flavors meld better. I will definitely make next year.

They're still cooling so I haven't tasted them yet; I imagine they will be good! However, as others have said, the recipe is not correct as printed. I would hazard a guess that the original recipe in Gourmet is ok. I have seen errors such as this before on here. Anyway, I measured accurately the amount to put in the little pans (after I had already made adjustments, as advised), and I had leftover dough and topping, probably enough to make 8 more. Now if I can just get them out of the pans!

These were delicious. I took the advice of previous reviewers and used only 3/4 cup of dough for topping. In the future, I would also reduce almonds to 1/2 cup. The only almonds I had on hand were slivered so I just chopped them before using. They were fine. They came out of the pans pretty well. The bottoms broke off of a few, but very easy to "glue" together.

They are delicious and easy, a big hit with family and coworkers both. They're also quite cute. What someone else said - "Do not undercook, as they're too tender to get out of pans." for sure. I used a silicone muffin pan, generously buttered per the instructions, and I think a metal non stick might have been better. The bottoms were a tad too squishy for my taste. I would reduce the amount of dough set aside for the tops as I had leftovers on that. Overall, delicious, and will be making again soon per my husband's request!

I made this recipe with only one change, I used a non-stick spray in place of the butter for coating the pan. I also used a wooden muffin shaper to press the dough into the pan. I had no problem with the dough sticking as long as I dipped the shaper into flour between each mini muffin. I also had no left over topping as others reported and my crumblers came out trouble free. I am thinking that my non-stick pan is the reason(it's a Pampered Chef). My crumblers were a little dark - probably the dark pan. I'll just adjust the time in the future.

A big hit w/my dessert-savvy crowd...but here are the tricks I used: use only 3/4 cup of dough with the almonds; lots of butter in the tins beforehand; press the bottom dough up the sides so that an indentation is created to hold the preserves/berries...and let the topping meet the bottom to enclose the filling so the cookies don't break in half coming out (but if they do -- just gently pull out the bottom and attach it back to top...they'll stay together and look fine. Do not undercook, as they're too tender to get out of pans.

Everyone loved these--I had to make a second batch just a few days later! I actually didn't have a problem with the recipe--I had enough dough for the top part and some extra from the top.

I liked the taste of the tartness of the lemon zest with the blueberries. I also enjoyed the crust. I agree with several people though, the tester did not allocate the recipe correctly. There was not enough dough to cover the muffin tins adequatly. I recommend doubling the crust part to cover the bottom of the muffin tin. In addition, I would also recomend refriderating the dough for 1/2 an hour, then rolling it into thin sheets. This is so the dough will not stick and you can more properly put them into the muffin tins. I did like the interaction of the flavors.

I am surprised at all the positive reviews on this one. I thought these cookies were barely mediocre and not at all worth the effort to make them. I even threw the recipe away after I made them. It's probably just a matter of preference, but for my tastes, these cookies just don't cut it. I always try to make several different cookies to accommodate many different tastes (I had 18 varieties on my cookie tray this year), but this one was by far the least favorite. There are too many delicious recipes out there to bother with this one.

I used a silicon mini muffin tray and these were the best cookies I ever made.

I agree with the other reviewers in part. Since I had read the reviews before, I only saved about 1/2 cup of the dough for the topping, it ended up about right. If you still add 1 cup of almonds, it does end up somewhat crumbly. My dough came together fine in the food processor. I would just say that these are fussy little cookies to make, the dough sticks to your hands while you try to put it into the pans, and it takes a little bit of time. I think they are worth it though, they taste crumbly, and buttery and just good overall. Everyone loved 'em.

I used raspberry jam and dried cranberries for the filling. It was still delicious and went nicely with the almond topping. If you use a lot of butter when greasing the tins you can get away with using regular mini muffin tins. Heed reviewer's advice about the top vs bottom dough proportions. Gourmet made a mistake on that one.

Again, like, all the reviewers, there was WAY too much topping for the cookies, I think 3/4 cup would be plenty. I substituted 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries for the dried blueberries since I didn't have any and couldn't afford any... Also, did anybody have problems with these damn things sticking to the tins ? I buttered them good but it was still a struggle to get them out. I wonder if using a silicon non-stick mold would of been of an advantage... Although the redeeming feature for these cookies is that you could really mangle them good and pat them back into an attractive shape. So all and all, these things are attractive and delicious. And easy to make since I was able to make the dough with a hand mixer.

Recipe testing failure! Way too much allocated for topping, not enough for tartlet bases. Only got 36 out of a DOUBLE recipe. Good news is you can use the extra streusel for the Apricot Orange Bars in the same issue -- you'll have enough for a double recipe of that! Tasty but too much potschky for too little result.

Like the other reviewers, I did not have enough dough for the bottom of the cupcakes and had to use some of the topping. The topping was never really crumbly and I had to put clumps of topping on each cupcake. The end result was great in spite of a poorly written recipe. I brought to a brunch and several people asked for the recipe. I used Stonewall Kitchen Wild Maine Blueberry Preserves for the filling and it was delicious!

The proportion of dough for the tops is way too high. If like me, you didn't read these reviews until you wound up with too much almond dough and not enough for the cookie bottoms, just use some of the almond dough on the bottom as well - it comes out the same. This dough also did not work well in my food processor - it wouldn't come together until I put it in the stand mixer for a minute. Delicious in the end though.

The end-product is good but the actual recipe is very poorly-written and makes me wonder if the recipe tester and the editorial department at Gourmet even talk to eachother. The recipe doesn't allocate NEARLY enough dough for the cookie bottoms and way too much for the tops, and I can tell the filling bubbling over is going to make getting these out of the cups really difficult. The dough is delicious and they seem like they'll be great, but nobody wants to have to figure out the proper proportions and production as they go during busy holiday baking. Totally mediocre standards in recipe writing from such an esteemed source.

Does anyone know if this recipe will work as a loaf crumble cake, instead of muffins?

Everyone loves this recipe! The cookies are great, but I agree with the first commentor than I had to adjust the dough proportion the second round. You need more bottom dough and less top almond filled dough.

I just made these for the second time. They're great and easy too! The only thing is I use less than 1 1/3 cups for the topping and definitely more for the muffin part of the cookie. It's fantastic!

I made these and took them into work as a treat for my co-workers. They must have been delicious because I didn't get ANY! Everyone like them though and begged for the recipe. I'm making them again-this time I'll keep a few out for myself.
