Enjoyed this preperation of butternut squash, peppers and rice immensely. Great way to get my teenager to gobble up veggies. Easy to whip up and a nice balance of sweet squash and savory rice.

Yuck. Made exactly as directed, except for the seeds at the end. Turned into a greasy mess. A waste of red pepper and butternut squash. I think that butternut is totally unsuited to this kind of preparation. While the onions and pepper retained some of their flavor, the butternut was completely flavorless.

This time of year, I'm always feeling overwhelmed with butternut squash from my garden and CSA  and I can only make soup once or twice without getting tired of it. This recipe was an excellent solution, and it had more flavor (and was much less work) that typical butternut squash risotto recipes.

Made the recipe exactly as written, it was amazing. Even my children, who can't stand squash loved it. Will definitely will be making this again!

Fine as a side to more interesting fare, or to have on hand if you need to serve picky kids (it's soft, doesn't have any strong flavors, mildly colored, and contains veggies, so as kid food goes, this is probably a 3 star recipe). Flavors are very nice and blend well, but it's a bit bland and starchy.

Next time will make double batch. Also, seems like the recipe has a bit too much olive oil. But everybody loved it - will definitely make it again. Yum yum!

I didn't have a butternut squash, so I used an extra bell pepper and a pear instead and this turned out great! (Also used broth instead of water.)

Made this because we had both a red pepper and butternut squash that needed to be used. Used vegetable broth in place of water as suggested by other reviewers, as well as added some cumin and cayenne. Did not have pepitas and our squash was pretty small so no seeds to toast there either...found some apricot kernels from Trader Joe's in the pantry and toasted those to use on top!! They're very tasty. This dish is quite yummy but definitely needs to be served with something green.

Delicious! I just followed the additional recommendations to sub chicken broth and add chili powder & cumin. I had 8 people over and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. Even my husband who despises squash of any kind. I'm making it tonight to use the rest of my squash. Enjoy!

Simple and tasty. The only thing I changed was to sub veggie broth for the water. May be a bit on the mild side for some, but it complements a spicy dish well. (I served it with sliced italian Tofurkey sausages, which gave the whole thing some kick.)

This was super easy and tasty. Even my husband liked it and he is a strict meat eater. I added some chili powder and cumin as well as some shelled edmame I had in the freezer. I didn't have any pepitas so I used spanish peanuts.

Easy and delicious. I substituted one of the cups of water w/some homemade chicken stock I had on hand and it was great.

I made this with the Spanish white beans and spinach, as recommended. My kids, who usually hate ANY squash, loved it and said they definitely want this for dinner again.

Loved it. I didn't have pumpkin seeds so I substituted sliced almonds and it was wonderful.

Left something to be desired in terms of flavor. We won't be making this again without some major changes.

I tried this together with the Spanish white beans and Spinach dish for my step-daughter who has recently become vegetarian. Together they make a good solid meal that doesn't seem too much like it's cheating the meat-eaters. Don't skip the pepitas; they absolutely MAKE it!
