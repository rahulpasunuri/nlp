I learned of the from an ex girlfriend, whose family would work as a team to put it together, and instead of veal used venison. From what I remember, they used tenderloin cutlets that they'd pound flat and marinate in wine with garlic and crushed sage. they then place a slice of proscuitto on it, a chunk of mozzarella, roll it up, and lightly sear the outside in a little olive oil, add the wine from marinating, then put in an oven on low heat. I may be off on a few things but it was tasty. Tonight I'm trying this with Buffalo.

I thought this recipe was disgusting. I followed the directions as written, and found the final product to be greasy and over-powering. The garlic was much too strong, the sage was unappetizing when the leaves are left whole, and the flavours don't come together well. I won't make this again, but if anybody still plans to try, be careful with the garlic and chop or chiffanade the sage before adding. You don't need 1/2 cup of oil either.

just so simple and tasty.... my only complaint would be that it was a bit oily, but i think i probably need to blame my inexperience in frying things.....

I first made this recipe about 4.5 years ago for a guy who's now my boyfriend....really. The only thing I STRONGLY recommend is to LEAVE OUT THE SALT. The Prosciutto itself has plenty, if not too much salt. Also, do watch it on the sage leaves. If you use too many, it's too much. I usually chiffonade the leaves, and add a tiny pile in between the meats. but really, you don't have to do that. I just usually keep it to 2 leaves per piece, not 3. Also, you don't necessarily need the toothpicks, if you're really careful... Enjoy!

I used chicken and was a bit diappointed that it dried out somewhat. Be careful with the salting---it is good advice from other cooks. When I returned the chicken to the pan, I covered it for a bit and it helped the sauce brown a bit. I topped with Parsley.

Used this as the starting point recipe for our annual New Year's Eve Progressive Dinner (8 couples). Substituted chicken breasts for $$ reasons(my daughter suggested thighs would be better when she sampled leftovers!)Took some of the suggestions from other reviews and used combo of butter and olive oil for the sauté step, added a small "stick" of Fontina cheese between the garlic/sage layer and prosciutto before rolling into bundle and securing with toothpicks. After sautéing and degalzing with white wine I added some tomato paste and then butter to make a more substantial sauce. Warmed chicken in low oven just before serving and napped with the heated sauce just prior to serving. Not quite four forks yet, but certainly on it's way!!

I made this without adding any salt and only used one piece of paper-thin prosciutto per veal slice - and found it salty enough. I also chopped my fresh sage and mixed it with the garlic. I found the reduction sauce didn't add much, other than that I drank half a bottle of white wine I wouldn't have otherwise. I will make it again when I have fresh sage to spare. My only regret is that I made it not long after my fiance had scrubbed the entire kitchen... he suggests I buy a splatter screen before I try this again.

Puts the "Salt" in Saltimbocca. Followed the recipe exactly...entirely too salty. Don't salt the meat, don't salt the garlic. In fact, the garlic totally overpowers the dish - couldn't taste the sage at all. Will make again with modifications.

This dish is delicious...My husband was SO impressed! It is all about the ingrediants....adding the garlic is a great touch. AND---- I must confess, I used thinly pounded chicken instead of veal!

This is the best saltimbocca ever. It's the garlic that makes the difference. I did make one change - I added finely chopped fresh sage to the garlic and a bit of olive oil to make a paste. this made it very easy to spread on the cutlets before topping with the prosciutto. Didn't need to use toothpicks. Served with gnocchi baked with parmesan and a salad. Wonderful.

Some versions of this dish do not use garlic, but it adds a nice flavor note. I like a combination of olive oil and butter for the saute, or swirl in a Tbl or 2 of butter with the wine (I used white vermouth, which is my standard cooking wine)to add body to the deglazing. A slice of provolone just before serving makes it more hearty--depends on the rest of the menu. Definitely better with fresh rather than dried sage, if you can get it.

I live in Rome, Italy and order Saltimbocca frequently at restaurants. Trust me, this recipe is as good as it gets. Will make it again, and again, and again....

I made this recipe for a monthly lady's dinner group, using chicken breasts, cut in half and pounded thin, instead of veal, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty much exactly. Everyone in the bunch loved it! Packed with flavor, and pretty simple to prepare - and most of the prep work can be done ahead of time. I served it with a blue cheese puff (a kind of modified Yorkshire pudding), a watercress, Belgian endive, and apple salad, and steamed broccoli with lemon. When everyone asked for recipes, I knew the menu was a success!

This was a very good recipe; I added cheese which made it even better.

I make this recipe and add fontina cheese. We used to get this in a restaurant in Westwood, CA, in a restaurant called Mario's. It was wonderful.

very good recipe and I have been making this dish for the better part of 25 years. I like to serve mine on a bed of barely steamed escarole dressed with garlic, olive oil and lemon

This is good, but I would recommend less garlic and perhaps chopping the sage as the whole leaves were a little... cumbersome. I also added Swiss cheese on top which was nice. This recipe is very good overall, just needs a little personalizing for individual tastes!

This really is a dish that will literally "jump into your mouth". That's what Saltimbocca means! I urge you to try it with boneless chicken breasts also. Just place in a plaastic bag, & pound thin {makes rolling easier}. Add stick of Swiss or Mozzarella, a few rosemary & roll-up. Dredge in flour - seasoned salt & pepper. Brown slightly, in 1 tab each butter & olive oil. Turn heat to low, add wine, cover simmer 30 min. Serve with Besmahti rice.

Very good! I tucked-under the ends of the veal slices, eliminating the need for toothpicks and making for a nicer presentation. Also, I added a little sweet Vermouth to the wine when deglazing.

Looked impressive, but it was too salty and the sage leaves were probably a thing of an acquired taste. No thanks.

I like this recipe allot for its simplicity and classic flavors but I like to gussy it up a little by topping the veal with small slices of Fontina cheese after the first turn and bordering it underneath with some fresh sauteed spinach or a tangy port wine Demi-Glace.

Definitely a keeper! I agree with everyone in that the cooking goes very quickly, and you need to keep an eye out for overcooking the veal. I finished the sauce off with a tablespoon each of butter and fresh lemon juice, and it was incredible. Served with a side of perciatelli pasta (hollow spaghetti) tossed with fresh chopped basil and sage, and a caesar salad. Yummy!

Have wrapped this around mozzarella cheese and also substituted pork cutlets for the veal for a twist. Both are delicious. For a zing, sprinkle the rolletes with lemon juice and garnish with fresh parsley. Simply to die for!

excellent, with fresh sage from the garden served with new potatoes and mint broad beans and grilled yellow peppers. I agree with last comment cook very fast.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!! I think that the problem with the last review was that the veal was over cooked - be careful or it will be too tough. But I highly recommend this dish.

I had to get veal cutlets for scallopini. I guess it really made a difference. The flavor with the sge was wonderful but the meat was very tough. I was disappointed

Let's suffice it to say that I made this the night my boss came over for dinner and the next day I had a raise. The recipe is just that good.

Saltimbocca is one of the most heavenly dishes ever devised. I have made this recipe many times to rave reviews. Variations on a theme would be: use boneless chicken breasts instead of veal; rosemary instead of sage. When I ordered this at a restaurant in Rome, Italy, it was rolled around a thin stick of cheese, such as Jarlsberg Swiss, Gruyere or mozzarella. Delisiouso! If the amount of garlic seems too much, eliminate and add 1 minced clove to the oil when sauteing. If prosciutto (ham) is not available, substitute country ham or honey ham.
