Really enjoyed this recipe! Easy to make and flavorful. I too doubled the recipe and had enough to feed four plus leftovers. Substituted the heavy cream with light cream and fat-free half and half for a lower calorie meal. I agree with other people about being patient with allowing the mixture to reduce (I let it reduce a little more than one third). Will definitely make this one again!

It's a favorite pasta dish in my household. I use fennel seeds.

I"ve made this dish twice in the paste month. Used spicy turkey sausage from the farmers market. The spice adds a lot to the dish.

Easy, delicious and a big hit with my family. My boys had thirds and even fourths.

Surprisingly good! I would definitely make it again. I didn't have a fennel bulb and was unsure how much to add of the dried. I added only about a teaspoon but it was delicious!

This is my family's favorite dish that I make. We have 4 kids ages 9-18 and they all want this for their birthday dinner. I triple the sauce recipe and add baby peas. A huge hit.

I also quadrupled this recepie and it was wonderful. The 45 minutes doesn't count in the chopping time required for the veggies. I chose to steam the sausage in a steamer over a pot of water. This lessened the fat, but we still loved the taste!!

This is a great easy meal. My husband loves it. I quadrupal it and it comes out fine. We then eat the leftovers which heat up and taste just as good as when it is fresh. The only reason I don't give this recipe 4 starts is because it serves 2 which is silly.

We could not eat this. The only changes I made was using half hot sausage, and other half not hot. We honestly ended up with salad for dinner as this had a very funky, unpleasant taste, and was also very unattractive.

Have the patience to take the time for reduction of both the wine/chicken broth and, later, the cream and you'll be rewarded with dense, delicious flavors. As a time saver when cooking for company, I cooked the sausage part and the vegetables up to adding the cream early in the day, refrigerated all and finished with the cream (and reheat all) as the pasta cooked later that evening.

I was attracted to all the ingredients in this recipe but thought the outcome was just mediocre.

I depend on the opinions here, so I'd better add yet another! This was very, very good. Primarily because the sauce did not overwhelm the pasta.

I love this dish! The fennel, when cooked, takes on a much more delicate flavor than when raw and compliments the spiciness of the sausage to perfection. For those reluctant to use heavy cream, try fat-free half and half as a compromise. The result is slightly less perfect but adequate if you're not expecting company!

Thanks to one of the other reviews I also substituted fennel seeds as I did not have a bulb. I also added mushrooms and extra garlic. Even my picky husband enjoyed the recipe. It's in the keeper file!

Easy to assemble and very tasty recipe. My local supermarket was out of fennel so I increased the red pepper and threw in a couple tablespoons of fennel seeds. Dispite my spur of the moment changes the dish came out yummy. A definate keeper!

The marriage of flavors in this recipe is wonderful. You barely notice flavors that are usually strong. I made another batch the next day and froze it for future enjoyment. I feel that is the second best out of 138 recipes I have save so far. (Sunset's "Italian Cooking" Primavera is best, so far of the 138.)

This was deliciuos. A good hearty meal. I quadroupled the recipe and fed 6 with enough left over for another meal. Its a good change of pace from the ordinary tomatoe pasta dishes. The fennel gave it a unique aroma. I might add a little more sausage next time. A definite repeater.

This is a 3+ forks dish. Lots of flavor, great texture, and easy to make.
