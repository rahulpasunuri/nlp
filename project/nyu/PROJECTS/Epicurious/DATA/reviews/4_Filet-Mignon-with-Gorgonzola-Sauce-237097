Gorgonzola and chipotle, who would thought? they go great together. made it per instructions and it was easy and delicious. used bison steaks and it was great. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. I up the garlic. Next time, I will up the chipotle too.

We love this recipe! We use it to make "Gorgonzola Beef" which is any leftover steak cut into thin strips and added to the sauce. We serve the "Gorgonzola Beef" over pasta with a sprinkle of chopped parsley for color.

Very nice and easy. I used half/half instead of whipping cream (less fat) and it was still really rich and yummy.

Wow, this was ridiculously tasty. I typically prefer a lighter sauce for fillets because it seems a shame to hide the flavor of the meat. But I'll definitely make an exception for this one. I really could have just eaten it with a spoon! The only change I made was using Portabellas instead of Shiitakes. And next time I'll probably add a little more chipotle. Delicious!

I loved this recipe. I cooked it exactly as recipe called. I had so much left over that I used it the next night over linguine with broccoli and chicken. I love multi use recipes. this is a definite staple. a real crowd pleaser.

My husband and I felt like we went to a gourmet steakhouse tonight! This recipe is perfect. Very rich, so its definitely a once in a while treat. He said it was the best steak sauce I've made. I served it with roasted potato, onion and brussel sprouts... potatos and onions are a must! Really added to the crsamy sauce.

This recipe is amazing. I love the creamy gorgonzola sauce and I used the leftover sauce to toss with some penne pasta. I would make it exactly how the recipe states, maybe just use different mushrooms, depending what I have, portabellas always work great.

Fantastic! I loved the recipe as is and served with a brown rice medley and steamed broccoli. Don't skip or substitute the chipotle chiles - they add just the right type of heat and flavor. Truly company-worthy meal for my meat- eating guests. Ended up with leftover sauce & steaks; and because I love mushrooms I added more sauted shitake mushrooms, chopped vidalia onion, a little fresh minced garlic, "smashed" dried rosemary leaves and a dash of worchestershire sauce. The additions added another dimension to the sauce without changing it too much. Absolutely delicious!

This was the first dish I ever cooked for my husband, and it's one he requests again and again. We grill our steaks, but otherwise make the recipe exactly. I usually make the sauce ahead of everything else and then bring it back up to temperature to serve. I served this for Easter dinner to rave reviews.

Super easy and extremely tasty. Used sliced criminis and still came out nice and mushroom-y. For anyone else who doesn't care for spicy (like us) try this: rinse off the adobo sauce and the seeds (make sure you get the seeds!) then mince. The nice smoky flavor of the pepper comes through without any of the hot stuff. Will make again for sure!

this is a wonderful sauce, I used atop New York strip steaks, and accompanied with roasted winter vegetables, paired with a hearty Cab :)

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I used chipotle chili powder because I could not find canned chipotles in our grocery store. It added just the right amount of zip. The sauce was easy to make and stayed warm on the stove while my brussel sprouts and carrots were roasting. This is an expensive meal but really worth it. You would pay so much more for something like this in a restaurant.

This is a special occasion recipe. I used New York strips instead of filets, a matter of taste and price. My guests scooped up every last bit of the sauce. Served with Parsley Leaf Potatoes and Brussels sprouts drizzled with aged balsamic.

This is a fabulous recipe that doesn't need the whipping cream to be rich. "Restaurant Qualty" is what my husband labels food I cook that he really, really likes and this one earns the title. I made this recipe with what I had on hand since I live 5 miles from a grocer. I used dried shitakes and 2% milk which boiled down nicely, and with the gorgonzola was thick and creamy and very rich. I used Emeril's Essence and ancho chili powder as a rub for the filets and served this with charred brussel sprouts which love gorgonzola cheese. Due to the chipotle, it might pack too much bite for finicky company but in my household, it's definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy (and extremely rich -- heart attack on a plate!). Definitely worthy of company. My only issue is that I made the sauce ahead of time and a lot of the oil separated out, but did not come back together again entirely when reheated. If I had known that, I would have made the sauce concurrently with the steaks.

Tried it again tonight...only just made the sauce and served it over fresh fettecini....OMG!

Ok, we followed the recipe exactly, cooking our filets over an open fire served with pan roasted vegetables and incredible red wine. All served at a lovely table set along side a mountain river....priceless! The back-kick of the chipotles such a complement to the gorganzola and mushrooms. I am seriously waiting for Chantrelles to appear to try in place of the shitakes. Cannot forget to mention the ease of this recipe!

Amazing! Received rave reviews from all of my guests. I made the sauce as-is except omitted the garlic and used white mushrooms instead of shiitake, and then served with grilled t-bone steaks. Yum!! Just tad spicy and very rich.

This sauce was delicious. I used crimini mushrooms and it turned out fabulously. I will definitely make this sauce again. It was great on steak and I even sopped the rest of it with some caramalized onion bread. The adobo sauce gives the recipe a perfect little kick to spice the sauce up.

This was a hit with my wife the first time I made it. I left out the chipolte for her sensitive taste buds. I serve it with a side of fresh thinly sliced roasted beets or crisp steamed asparagus with lemon vinagrette. It marries well with a full bodied Merlot, Cab or Chianti. This is the first thing I cook when the kids are away for the night to the relatives. I am starting to become predictable. I have made this over a dozen times and will make it again and again.

A nice recipe. Left out the chipotles and it still complimented the filet mignon nicely. For me, the simplicity and ease of the recipe makes it very worth while to prepare.

This recipe is amazing. It was the first thing I ever cooked for my husband when we were dating, and he is still requesting it. The sauce is very rich and has a nice kick. I recommend simple roasted veggies along side. I have done both grilled and broiled steaks to equal success.

This sauce is excellent. I chose to grill the tenderloins, but I'm am sure the sauce guarantees a satisfying result regardless of the preparation of the steaks.

I had shiitake mushrooms that I needed to use. Since my husband wanted to have steak last night I looked for a recipe for steak and shiitake mushrooms and found this wonderful recipe. I made the sauce and my husband grilled strip steaks outdoors. We loved the sauce. It is absolutely out of this world! We had steamed broccoli as a side dish with our steak, and the sauce was fantastic with it as well as with the steak. I will definitely make this again. It is an easy recipe that packs a great flavor punch.

How can you go wrong with gorgonzola sauce and filet mignon? All the men in my house loved it and the neighbor kid who joined us for dinner was thrilled to eat such a delicious meal.

Rating: 4
I did the typical - didn't have quite what I needed, so I made adjustments along the way. First, couldn't find canned chipolte chiles, so I subbed with fresh jalapeno's. Because I didn't want it too hot, all seeds were removed and I minced from the fattest part of the pepper. Next I only bought a cup of whipping cream. I added 1/2 cup of 2% milk for the rest, which added about 10 minutes of thickening time to the sauce as the milk had to evaporate off. Last, grocery store didn't have Filet Mignon, so I subbed Rib-eyes instead. Hindsight 20/20, I should have wrapped the steaks in bacon ... next time. I went a little over on the gargonzola giving it great punch! I'll do this one again; looking forward to grilling the steaks next time.

this sauce is so good, but ... it really won't hold for up to two hours without getting overly thick and gooey. I've made it and served immediately and it is infinitely better than making ahead.

I made this for my father-in-law, who can be somewhat picky. Everyone enjoyed it. I did the recipe as is, chipole an all. It had a little bite when tasting the sauce, but with the beef and veggies it was blow mind. I also took the advice from another review and seasoned the steaks with a store bought rub and garlic sauce from the day before. Already in my recipe collection.

MMM...delicious. My husband and I both enjoy cooking, and we cooked this together for our 4 year anniversary. We made mashed potatoes to go on the side, and we put just a little chopped chipotle and gorgonzola in them. It was wonderful. Also, we had a merlot with it, and it seemed to balance the meal really well.

OMG This is soooo good! I made this to go over sirloin steaks and petit filets tonight, and I can't believe how good it is. I have never liked the blue-cheese-on-steak thing before, but this was terrific!

The gorgonzola sauce is very heavy, be forewarned. While I liked it, I would have preferred much more spice (perhaps it's because I used picked jalapeños instead?) without the extra spice, the cheese flavor is overwhelming!

That sauce is to die for! Served it over grilled NY strips. Was even better on the baked potatoes. I'd make it as a potato topping as a meal on it's own, maybe putting extra chunks of gorgonzola on the potato after the sauce. yum.

A very good dish that has a variety of flavors expressed. It starts off with the great taste of the gorgonzola and then ends with the spice of the chipotle chile. A outstanding dish that is simple to make.

This was heavenly. I made it for a dinner party, doubled the sauce and did it in advance (more than 2 hrs.) which I gently reheated as the filets were cooking. Everyone LOVED it, and I've been enjoying a little bit of the leftover sauce on scrambled eggs this week. What a luxurious mid-week breakfast!

Made this recipe in a cooking class I taught recently and it was so fantastic, I will be cooking this for 30 ppl for a holiday party. Use Fat free half and half to cut out some fat if you feel it's necessary..serve with fresh homemade pasta!!

The quality of the dish depends on the quality of the meat. Our filets weren't very good, but the sauce was heavenly, divine, superlative. I can hardly wait to try it on prime steaks grilled over charcoal and will also use the sauce for a pasta and chicken dish. Half of the sauce for two steaks is a perfect amount.

I have made this recipe several times, and every time I make it, it's a huge hit. My husband loves mushrooms, and the rich, creamy, gorgonzola sauce is perfectly balanced by the earthy flavor of the chiles. So easy and so delicious!

INCREDIBLE!!! This was so easy and totally YUMMY!! Since I used what I had on hand, I substituted regular mushrooms for the shiitake and used blue cheese rather than gorgonzola (cut back to 3/4 cup since it is stronger). The chiptle gives it just a little kick that is such a great surprise! I think the sauce isn't enough for 8 steaks though.... but we like a lot of sauce. I made the same amount of sauce called for but only served 4 steaks and we used all of the sauce. This sauce would be awesome with just about any meat!

Fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly-- very easy and quick. For eight generous servings, I would double the recipe. The sauce was also good on the grilled asparagus and baked potato served with the steak. It was excellent on an omelette the next day. It would even be good with just a crusty bread! One of my guests plans to make the sauce next week for her own guests. The combination of flavors is wonderful.

I've made this dish a few times now, and it is truly one of my all-time favorites. Made exactly according to the recipe, it is fantastic. However, I will also make a double recipe of the sauce using a mixture of both cream and half-and-half, (because the sauce CAN get a bit thick) and then pop any sauce that doesn't get eaten the first night right into the freezer. I can gently reheat the sauce on a weeknight when I don't have much time to cook and serve it on scallopini over pasta. Still great. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who likes complex flavor and spice.

Rating: 4
Really delicious. I cooked them for 5 minutes per side on medium-high heat in a cast iron skillet, and it came out rare, 10 minutes in a 375F oven made them perfectly medium-rare. The sauce is really great, but very robust. Just put a little on the filet mignon, you don't want it to overwhelm the beef.

Maybe a little too rich and spicy for a good filet mignon, but the leftover sauce goes great on grilled chicken!!!

This was absolutely amazing. I agree with the others that the sauce is very versatile. You could use it on grilled pork chops or chicken. I think it would be too heavy for fish. Made it exaclty as written, wonderful.

Really delicious but the person who wrote this recipe goes into detail about the sauce, and just assumes you already know how to cook filet mignon (which I didn't). It doesn't even say what kind of heat to cook the steak at. Apparently you are supposed to cook it on high heat -- I didn't know that and I cooked it on medium heat so it took longer and I ended up having to cut it open to see if it was done, etc, etc.

The sauce is delicious. I went with a sweeter Gorgonzola, baby portabellas, and thickened the cream a little longer than the recipe suggested. There wasn't any sauce leftover! It's creamy, earthy with a little spicy kick at the end from the chipotle. We seared the filet and then cooked it in the oven for a few minutes for a buttery result.

I made this for my husband and I and we both liked it alot. Based on 1 review I made a full recipe of the sauce for the 2 of us and it was way too much. I thought the sauce was very heavy and it would be better with milk or cream/milk combo. Don't scrimp on the chilies. That's what makes the sauce special.

I really liked the flavors but, found the sauce to be a little too creamy for a filet. I'll definitely make this again but I'll use only 1 cup of cream and add another teaspoon of chipotle chiles. The sauce smells so wonderful and the mixture of the mushrooms, gorgonzola and chipotle is fantastic against a simple salt & pepper steak!

Rating: 3
This was delicious. I used a Danish blue cheese, and portobellos instead of shiitakes (sometimes you have to use what you have on hand),and used 2 tablespoons of the chiles. It was zippy and smooth. This would be good on a chicken and pasta; a little heavy for the steak, but a real treat.

This recipe was delicious. I made it with chicken breasts. As I did not have fresh mushrooms, I used dried porcini that had been soaked. Instead of the cream, I used cream fraiche--about 1/2 cup. I thickened the sauce, and then added the cheese. Divine!

WOW. Excellent! Sauce would work on most anything. My husand thought the sauce was spicy, but he loved it! I made the full amount of sauce, but only two large filets. I will save the remaining sauce for a later dish...maybe pork tenderloin. Served with potato gratin with gruyere and creme fraiche (from this site, i think) and asparagus with parmesan butter (also this website). ALL GREAT. Main dish easy enough for weeknight but great enough for the most discerning guests.
