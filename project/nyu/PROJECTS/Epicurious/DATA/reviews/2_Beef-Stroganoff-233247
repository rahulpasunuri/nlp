My husband and I love this. Be sure to use a good quality beef cut like sirloin or better. Don't over cook the meat, I undercooked it a bit so that when I added it back in it came out to a perfect medium with pink center. I used about 1/2 the cream, but needed much more butter. Don't forget to season and use parsley. We serve over egg noodles or rice. We like it much better than the stuff with sour cream. If you think anyting from Marie Calendar's is good food, then this is not for you.

This is why I love that this site has reviews. While I know that this recipe bears no resemblence to any stroganoff I have ever eaten or prepared, a novice cook might try it and quit cooking forever.

I was looking for a recipe on beef stroganoff when I happened to see this one. I have not made this and do not intend to. Just wanted to comment on the cook from New Orleans reply. I'm still laughing, you made my day.

BLAH! No good. I would never think that something this bland should even be called beef strog'! Im going to post my version that was inspired from workin at Marie Callenders. Way better, and delicious!

I made a few changes to this recipe. 1-Crumble recipe into ball and toss into recycling bin. 2-pick any beef stroganof recipe beside this. 3-wonder how this got by the food editors

This is a bland recipe which I made by mistake, thinking this was the simple stroganoff recipe from Gourmet I remembered being great. It wasn't. Anyway, search for "stroganov" and you'll get the Gourmet Oct 2001 recipe which is an excellent way to use tenderloin.

Not great. It was just blah. The other stroganoff recipe on Epicurious is a favorite of mine, though.

This was pretty awful, prepared as written. Next time I feel compelled to make beef stroganoff, I think I'll use Mamakat's recipe. While many seem eager to cast aspersions regarding whether she's allowed to cook what she wants, or share her ideas with the rest of us, it sure seems that she is the only one who has an edible recipe without complaining of breaking the bank.

Definitely not creamy enough - tasty, but you can't call it stroganoff. And with due respect to Mamakat2: I'm sure your recipe is yummy and there are many gourmet recipes with simple ingredients. The problem with your recipe is that serious cooks do NOT use canned soup. Simple ingredient means something pure and basic, not simple because it comes out of a can. Canned stock is OK in a pinch but not the blended/cream style canned soups. They're fake -- not allowed, full stop.

This has nothing to do with real Beef Stroganoff. It should at least contain either mustard or paprika and sour cream. Using heavy cream and no spices results in a very bland dish. Don't waste your time.

I totally believe the canned food I give my dog is more flavorful than this horrible recipe. First off, it needs sour cream. Just because this calls for 'creme freche' or however it's spelled doesn't mean this is going to be fancy or delicious. It's just expensive and bland. And who would want to ruin a wonderful cut of beef like this by basically putting it into a casserole??? Grill the tenderloin, don't waste it in this terrible recipe.

Ok, so I modified this a bit. First off, I didn't use parsley. Looking back, that was probably a good choice considering it would have interfered with the fine flavor of the meat and mushrooms. I also added white wine to the juice left from cooking the meat and added that to the sauce. I suppose if you're really set on making traditional stoganoff then you should look for another recipe, but I was just looking for something that tastes good and the combination of these flavors was wonderful. Plus, I used like two packs of mushrooms (like 6 cups really).

Please do not fight over a recipe. If you really want a better Beef Stroganoff, check out Bon Appétit, September 1999. Most importantly, our palate are different, so slight adjustment on the ingredients may be neccessary. Bon Appetit!

I think the "cook from Indianapolis" (original name by the way ) needs to pull the stick out of their you know what and realize as most "serious cooks" already do that sometimes the best recipes come from the most simplest ingredients.

I think the reviewer: mamakat2 from Roseville Ca on 01/17/06, is on the wrong website. S/he is probably looking for Country living or possibly 101 things to do with a can of soup...NOT for serious cooks.

I'm surprised this made it into the magazine. It had little taste and even the beef wasn't tasty. A stroganoff without sour cream is a mistake. This is a disater.

I didn't make this recipe either but I have a wonderful EASY stroganoff recipes. You take 2 lbs of stew meat 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup 2 cans of french onion soup 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt Cook this mixture in a crock pot preferably, cook all day until meat is shredded. Last 30 minutes stir a 16oz. of sour cream and a package of the wide egg noodles. Cook until noodles are done.You can also add a package of fresh sliced mushrooms at this step as well. Easy and very good.

I did not make this recipe because the reviews were so bad, but where can I read more reviews by thestoolsampler? I am still laughing!

Yuk is right. I spent half of my disposable income this month to buy the beef for this,and it was completely ruined by this recipe. I have never tasted something so bland that even beef tenderloin couldn't spruce it up! Despite my large expenditure, I couldn't even bring myself to eat the leftovers...

Wow! this is not the best stroganoff I have made, but its not THAT bad. We liked it enough to make again, and without any of the suggested lemon juice on hand I'll try adding a dash of Lea&Perrins. Its quick, subtle, but warming on a cold night.
