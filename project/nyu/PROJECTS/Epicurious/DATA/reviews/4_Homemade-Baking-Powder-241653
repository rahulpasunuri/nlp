I'm afraid I don't get it. I used this for both the biscuit recipe and the cornmeal cake, and neither one rose worth a damn. When it happened with the biscuits, I was disappointed, but for some reason, biscuits have never worked for me. But when the cake came out with a caved-in middle, I knew the problem couldn't be me. For whatever reason, this homemade version of a pantry staple just didn't work for me. I'm not going to hold it against the biscuits, which were tasty in spite of not having risen very much, but neither am I going to bother with this homemade baking powder again, either.

Worked like a charm--can't really do any better than that, right? Right...?

works great. We're a DIY baking powder house now. For ease... the ratio is 2 parts cream of tartar (tartaric acid) 1 part baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)

At last, a baking powder without the 'metallic' taste. This will be included in the gift baskets this Christmas season. The bakers in the family will love this!

Fantastic, I make Nigella Lawson' s pancake powder mix and previously it had tasted really 'tinny' and metallic. With this baking powder the pancakes were divine. The quantity is not too large, good for a few weeks baking in a family.

This is a great recipe. It works well in all of my recipes that call for baking powder and I don't need to worry about aluminum in my baked goods anymore. I've already made the recipe twice.
