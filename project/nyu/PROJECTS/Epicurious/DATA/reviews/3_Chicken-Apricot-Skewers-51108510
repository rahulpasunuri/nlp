Wow was this hot and delicious. I followed it exactly but added the jalapeno seeds for the added chicken and used mango instead of apricots. I would recommend using a firmer mango as one that is too ripe is difficult to work with. Super messy to put together but soooo worth it!

Tasty fusion. A big hit. Make when apricots are in season or substitute something fresh and juicy. We made with skinless chicken thighs and enjoyed the dipping sauce. Yummm.

I made this for a dinner party and as an earlier reviewer mentioned, the marinade is a bit delicate. If I make it again, I would amp up the flavors with hotter peppers, a bit more garlic and perhaps additional peanut butter.

Although the sauce was quite good on the chicken, it had too delicate a flavour for me as a marinade. Neither the lime, the peanut, the jalapeno, the cilantro, or the coconut really infused the chicken. I, too, made with peach halves as apricots were already finished for the season. Good, not great.

This did *not* work for us. I thought the flavor combo sounded weird, but everyone raved about it so I gave it a shot. I used chicken thighs and didn't skewer them, and didn't use apricots either, but I don't think either of those changes much affected the results. We just didn't like it. The flavor of the marinade/sauce was not good. We ended up peeling off the skin (which had all of the marinade and was mostly charred anyway) and dipping the meat in bbq sauce. A total bummer.

This is a fantastic recipe. I used mango instead of apricot.

I made this recipe for a dinner party over the Labor Day weekend. I made a couple of substitutions. When I was at the grocery store, apricots weren't available so I used peaches (cut into a large dice), and I also used regular plain yogurt. Both substitutions worked well for the recipe.

Delicious. Really. Would definitely make again. Everyone loved it. I made it with chicken breasts, almost exactly as written. I halved the amount of jalepeno and substituted quartered peaches for the apricots, since apricots were not available. I only marinated the chicken for 3 hours and it was fine because the extra sauce that it's served with gives it plenty of flavor. I didn't oil the grill and had no problems with either the chicken or the peaches sticking. One change for next time to save effort - I'd just use whole chicken thighs and half grilled peaches. Not as pretty but just as yummy.

I loved this recipe, the presentation is exceptional. I do agree the marinate is messy, but the flavor is so worth it!

I served these to a group of 12 at our pool party. I followed the recipe exactly, except for doubling it, and using nectarines. It looked just like the picture, and was delicious. The marinate was a bit messy, but worth it. I marinated the chicken overnight and the flavor was super.

Dont forget to oil the grill!

I made this recipe last night, and after some tweaking of the marinade/sauce it was pretty good. I made the marinade to the recipe, except I only added one garlic clove and 1/2 the amount of jalapeno since we are not big fans of those, and found it just.....meh!! It definitely lacked a "wow factor." I started playing around with the ingredients - after every addition I tasted and then played some more. By the end of it, I had added almost another 1/4 cup of lime juice, a lot more cilantro, a little more brown sugar, and quite a bit more salt - which is weird since we aren't big salt eaters. I don't know exact measurements for everything since it was a work in progress until it tasted balanced. Unfortunately, I used a low-end coconut milk and there was a horrible sulfur smell - it faded, but may have tainted my perception of the marinade, so make sure you use a good quality canned coconut milk. My end result looked exactly like the picture and tasted great. My apricots were very ripe and I agree with the other reviewer that said they were almost jammy. I spritzed them well with oil before putting them on the grill and had no problem with them sticking and I basted a couple of times while they were cooking, stopping in time to make sure the marinade was cooked before taking them off. I would definitely make this again maybe trying really ripe peaches next time, and a better quality coconut milk. I only gave it 3 forks because of the amount of tweaking needed, but of course, everyone's tastes are different.

Wasn't thrilled by this recipe the peanut butter made it taste strange. I wouldn't make this again.

I have not made this recipe tho I do intend to, but I have to comment on elliotj from Annapolis's review. It's almost impossible to get good, ripe apricots here on the east coast. You have to let them ripen on the tree. I grew up in California and the apricots there are WONDERFUL! The recipe sounds delicious, just try it with some other fruit as others have suggested.

Similar to a previous review, I left boneless chicken thighs whole. Delicious sliced over brown rice. The apricots need to be quite ripe....mangoes, peaches and plums would all be just as tasty if the market apricots are rock hard.

This was phenomenal! We ended up using chicken breasts - let them marinate for six hours. The apricots we got were perfectly ripe and quite large, so we quartered them instead of halving them. We brushed the apricots with marinade had no problems with sticking. Served it with brown rice and broccoli - to a family ages 4 to 68 and everyone ate well!

Really good. But forget the skewers and apricots. Just make the marinade, pound some chicken breasts so they're flattened a bit, and cook until they're done. So yummy.

Sauce was delicious and the tartness of the apricots was a nice contrast to the other mix of flavors. One note - the marinade caused the chicken to stick to the grill so I would be sure to oil the grill next time. Served with lemongrass/ginger rice and brocolini - perfect!

We loved this! Instead of grilling directly on grates, I placed the skewers on tin foil in the BBQ. No mess to clean up. I suspect the apricots would have stuck and been a disaster otherwise. Only half the sauce recipe is required.

Very good, lots of flavor! I used colorado peaches (less) instead and chicken thighs. You could half the sauce, i used natural PB so added a liittle brown sugar and a few dashes of hot sauce and whole jalapeño, no seeds.

This was just ok. Didn't care for the apricots grilled. If you are going for an asian flair why not take it all the way. PS. Way to many apricots for the amount of chicken used.

I tried this recipe and had great success! My apricots were probably more ripe than the previous reviewer, and I used as many as I wanted, and perhaps not as many as the recipe called for. The apricots become almost jammy after grilling, and you can spread them on the chicken as you munch. The marinade is DELICIOUS  I wanted to eat it all by itself! I used chicken thighs and didnt have boneless, so just did them all in one piece. I marinated for about 2.5 hours which was enough, but now I will try the overnight option. I used ½ jalapeno and it wasnt very spicy, so I may add a bit more the next time, but it was still tasty despite no real sense of spice. I would highly recommend this recipe, apricots or not!

I suspect this recipe was secretly pushed by the Society of Apricot Producers (SAP), a shadowy organization that seeks world domination. I belive this because, if many people try this recipe, world apricot futures will soar. Consider for a moment that the recipe says that for every one inch cube of chicken you should use half an apricot. The result is that when you take a kebab off the grill and put it on your plate you wind up with a huge mound of apricots and a small side of chicken. If you really, really like apricots, that may be a good thing. But if you are like me and have never eaten a fresh apricot, you soon learn they are very tart. They might taste better if grilled with something sweet. But chicken coated with yogurt and peanut butter ain't it. On the plus side, the marinade was OK. Not great but certainly worth a try. I did cut way back on the Jalapeno pepper which was a mistake. I try to avoid food that burns a hole in my mouth but I was way too cautious this time. In the end, however, as I tossed several pounds of grilled apricots into the garbage, I muttered one word, "SAP."
