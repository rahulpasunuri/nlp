We've made this recipe about five times now, and it's turned out great each time. The only thing I did differently was use two 3-cup souffle dishes instead of one 6-cup since that's all we have. I'm making it again this weekend...

I think "Pierre" is a phoney.

Au contraire "Pierre", this recipe produced a beautiful and delicious chocolate souffle. I definately will make it again.

I have made this twice and both times it turned out perfectly! The first time, I used an egg substitute instead of yolks, omitted the cream of tartar, and it was great! The second time I followed the recipe and it was a bit more moist. Ghiradelli semi-sweet choc. chips are best.
