I like this recipe a lot. I use about half the coriander and cardamom though and also use purple potatoes to make the dish prettier.

I loved this recipe. I love it with the fingerling potatoes and also added some more of the purple idaho for color. The cardamon was a little heavy and cut that way back.

Even while preparing this dish, it occurred to me that cardamom and coriander seemed to be strange choices (especially in these quantities) to spice root vegetables. In retrospect, I was right. Not enjoyable. My ladyfriend and I were really disappointed and wished we had chosen to prepare these with just olive oil, salt, and pepper.

My sister made these on Christmas Day and they added a fabulous twist to a traditional turkey dinner. Absolutely delicious!

Thewe were very easy to make and attractive on the plate. Wouldn't make again with the NY strip roast though - would make mashed potatoes.
