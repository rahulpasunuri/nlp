This is completely meh. Not incredibly spicy, not incredibly citrusy, not incredibly anything. Just ho-hum. There are better recipes out there.

This recipe looked like it might be spicy based on the ingredients so I cut down the chili powder and cumin by half. It gave it just a little kick of spice. Overall I would have liked the marinade to have more flavor rather than just heat.

I'm a big fan of kebabs in the summertime and I thought these were really fantastic. Very simple and light tasting. Grilling the squash gives it a great flavor.

Great summer kabob recipe! Light, fresh, with just a hint of spice. I added red pepper, but otherwise made as directed. The chicken was delicious and tender.

Wonderful, healthy recipe. I cut the chicken in strips instead and grilled without skewers. As a bonus, the leftovers were great for lunch, wrapped in a tortilla with a smear of spicy black bean dip and bit of low-fat sour cream. Will make this again and again!

Only made the chicken, but it was great. Nice flavor and very tender after marinating a couple hours. Will make the full recipe soon.

This was a delicious meal for a casual dinner party. I followed the recipe exactly for the marinades and made small changes to the other elements. I used tofu instead of chicken, added eggplant and mushrooms to the kebabs, and broiled them since I don't have a grill. I served a baguette and goat cheese on the side. Guests said it was the best meal they'd eaten in a long time.
