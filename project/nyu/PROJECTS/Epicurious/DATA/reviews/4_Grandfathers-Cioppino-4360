Great cioppino! Made exactly as called for with the exception of using leeks instead of onions, as I had them on hand, and a frozen seafood mix from Costco with scallops, shrimp, mussels and calamari. Was perfect for a Sunday night family meal. Definitely will make for company but using all fresh seafood. This will be a go to dish.

Have subscribed to Bon Appetit for 20 years and hands-down this is the best recipe from it I have ever made. Incredible depth, easy to do, even our kids loved it. Serves more than 6 unless by you mean "six hungry football players".

We rocked "Grandad's Cioppino" by substituting a chopped fennel bulb for the celery and adding calamari, prawns, clams and NZ greenlip mussels. I love additions of the cinnamon and Allspice. Check out our pic on March 7, 2011 on Facebook: Cycling Chef

I've made this several times now, and I would never use another cioppino recipe! Follow the recipe as is, and it turns out perfect every time. It needs a liberal amount of salt, as all cioppinos do. I halved the recipe last time and used about 1 1/2 tsp (maybe more). Instead of mixing in the crab meat I like to lump it on each bowl when it's served, otherwise it seems to get lost in the stew.

Excellent--hearty--serves more than 6!!

It was easy and delicious. I added 1/2tsp fennel seeds, resplaced celery with leeks and substituted white wine for red. I did not have clam juice, so added anchovies. Added shrimp, scallops and salmon and my husband loved it.

I followed recipe to a "t" because I had never made Cioppino. Glad I went against my instincts and even added spices that I usually omit (like oregano) - the depth of flavor was AMAZING. My husband believes that this recipe is better than any he has had in a restaurant. This is a keeper!

used tilapia fish instead of sea bass, and scallops instead of shrimp.

This was wonderful. Everyone loved it. Used two 28-oz cans--one diced, one crushed, plus some puree. The addition of allspice and cinnamon really contributed to the full flavor. Used shrimp, squid, and cod for the fish.

We followed the recipe for the most part. I added a bit of chopped red bell pepper. I also added a sliced carrot. Our fish choices were a little more economical. We used leftover lobster (the not-so-economical part), shrimp, bay scallops, fresh chopped clams instead of canned, cod instead of seabass, mussels instead of whole clams, and sliced calamari. I think the moral of the story is... you can use just about anything. The backbone of this recipe is fantastic!

A great basic recipe, which I've messed with a bunch. I substitute 2 leeks for one of the onions. I saute the onions first, then the leek, celery, and etc. The tomatoes ... easier to just use two large (28 oz) cans, one chopped, one smooth. I use fresh herbs when they are around, about 3x the amount for dried. And I like to go heavier on the allspice and cinnamon. Make it a day in advance, without the seafood. Enjoy!

Cioppino is an American dish, San Franciscan to be exact. It was originally a toss-it-all-in-a-pot-and-heat-it-up kind of meal. The only problem I see with this recipe is the wine needs to be boiled with the garlic and herbs to reduce by 1/3 and the parsley needs to be tripled :).........whole fennel is usually a must, but seeds will suffice :)

I was swayed by all the fantastic reviews to make this cioppino and was quite disappointed. I think I used a couple too many onions (what is a "large" onion?) but I think the bigger problem was the red wine -- it gave the cioppino a dirty taste. I would try another recipe with fresh herbs and white wine in the future.

I made this dish for the first time. Everyone loved it and went back for more. Would like to try it again but take Dee from San Diegos suggestion and make the marinara a day in advance. It seemed to lack a little punch that cooling and reheating would provide. Recipe is enough for eight and maybe more. A definate keeper. Add whatever fish or shellfish you like and it will still be great.

This recipe if perfect. i have had a lot of great cioppinos (being originally from Vancouver, BC, home of great seafood), and this one, while relatively quick and easy, stands the test. (good food in England is generally impossible to come by at a reasonable price, so this is a fantastic find for us!) i used what there was available in the store-no fresh clams, but canned instead, prawns and monkfish. the monkfish was a PERFECT addition to this dish, as it holds it lovely texture very well and tastes wonderful (also called anglerfish, known as "poor man's lobster). fantastic! thank you, Epicurious.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe as-is but would definately stick to a very small pinch of allspice and cinnamon. Makes a lot more then I had expected and would safely feed six very hungry people with just some bread. Expensive of course but I did not feel like I wasted my money at all. How I love Epicurious. Keep it free!!!

I followed this recipe exactly EXCEPT, I used butter to saute the vegetables instead of olive oil, and I simmered the sauce longer then the 30 minutes AND I added to fish bullion to the sauce. It WAS good, but it was not, stand on your head awesome, as some Cioppio's I have had in my humble opinion. At our restaurants, we start our cioppino with a day old Marina Sauce. I think, that is the secret. After a day, the herbs have blended and seasoned the sauce. Then, we add the fish/fish stock and the shell fish. Also, I would cut down a bit on the onion for this recipe. Just a personal opinion. Otherwise it's certainly worthy of a re-make. I just think personally, I would make the sauce 1 day ahead of time if possible.

This cioppino recipe has become something we're "known" for--everyone loves it, and although I think the crab meat is integral to the recipe, we switch and swap the other seafood based on what looks great at the fish market. Such a wonderful meal paired with a green salad and crusty sourdough bread. Doesn't get better than this...

Easy recipe. Made it for company and was a hit. My husband said this is the best cioppio he has tasted. I made one switch to the recipe. Scallops for crab. This recipe is a keeper

Very tasty indeed. Make cioppino often and the joy of it is what is at the market and in the garden. Have used every variety of seafood and it's always the best ever. Do suggest using a whole cleaned crab, cracked well and halibut. Have added fennel and it's now a staple ingredient, a splash of pernod is good too. Balsamic vinegar and pepper flakes, maybe extra garlic... that's the beauty of a great dish takes well to various changes. Always serve with the best crusty bread you can find and lots of napkins. Yummy.

It was my first time making cioppino. Our guests loved it. It was very tasty. I used more fresh clams to replace the canned clams, used halibut instead of sea bass and added scallops. It was very delicious! This is a keeper!

A simply excellent cioppino recipe! I am on the west coast and this recipe is a little cost prohibitive with the crab so I instead used 1lb baby scallops. I also used half as many canned clams and threw in 8 oz. of chopped of squid with the shrimp and fish. Finally, I would note that I was very conservative with the pinch of cinamon and allspice. It was super tasty and made four adults very full and happy!

Made this for company and everyone loved it. The market didn't have any clams or mussels so I doubled up on the fish and shrimp. I also didn't have any white wine handy so I substitute it with red wine. Next time I'll be sure to add the clams, I'm sure it will be more tasty.

I agree! This was a wonderful recipe. It had a lot of flavor. I skipped the fish and used all shell fish instead. It was excellent served with a nice, crusty bread!

Superb! Made it for New Year's dinner, and all my guests begged we make it a tradition. One former seafood chef said it was the best Cioppino he'd ever had. I steamed mussels and clams separately, refrigerating them until the end. I saved the liquor from steaming, strained it, and added it to the base. With a loaf of garlic bread and a walnut/pear/gorgonzola salad, this meal was heaven on earth.

Absolutely wonderful dish! Will make it again and again. I added mussels, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This is a great recipe! I added muscles and dungeness crab legs. I also added some saffron which I thought tasted great, but would probably not appeal to traditionalists. Let the suace cook (i.e. reduce) for the full 30 minutes to really concentrate the flavors, and then loosen the sauce back up with the white wine, water and seafood. My, oh my, -we ate it two nights in a row!

My quantities of fish, shrimp, crab and clams were quite different than the receipe, but it turned out great. Raves from even the most accomplished cooks.

Best Cioppino that I have ever made. I have made this two times once for my family and once for friends. Everyone loved it. I changed the fish around a little, however, the crab and shrimp are a must keep. I used red snapper instead of sea bass and one time used half of the cherrystone clams and added mussles. This recipe will become a permanent fixture in my cookbook.

This is as good (or better) as the cioppino we get in San Francisco! I picked the meat from a whole dungeness crab, and it was the perfect amount. Excellent autumn dish with french bread and a nice Sangiovese. I definitely will make this again (and again).

Excellent for entertaining. When making again, I would use less crabmeat and substitute more shellfish (shrimp or mussels). Otherwise, this recipie is a keeper! Serve in Giant Bowls with fresh sourdough bread. As close to Scomas as you can get.

We made this for 12 people New Years Eve. The recipe doubled with excellent results. We added a bit of cayenne and went light on the allspice and cinnamon. We also used halibut instead of sea bass and went light on the crab meat and added mussels. I would definately make it again.

First try at cioppino and my husband raved. Saved the leftover sauce to serve with pasta as one cook suggested. Great one-dish meal for company with good french bread.

This cioppino was so good, we plan to always have the soup-base - without the shellfish and fish -- in the freezer and ready to go. Instead of the clam juice, I added a seafood broth I had made from 10 dungenous crab shells. It was an incredibly rich-tasting soup, amazingly so given how low it is in fat. I'm making it again tonight!

2 cups of water? why dilute the wonderfully rich stew? i added one cup of water and 1 small can of tomato juice. i also used a bit more red wine, more red pepper, halibut, canned baby clams, and come chopped fresh basil and more parsley at the end. serve over pasta! yummy!

I've made this recipe several times and I (we) enjoy it more each time. No one ever leaves without requesting this recipe!! we really do not have access to fresh crabmeat like they do in San Francisco, however we do have plenty of fresh mussels. I subsitiute the mussels for the crab. I also use white wine in addition to what the recipe calls for. Lots and lots of wine.

Rating: 2
This would be a lot better if the allspice and cinnamon are left OUT. It's OK, but really nothing special. I've had ciopino all over San Francisco / Bay area, and fisherman's stew on the east coast from Spanish & other Italian recipes. This does not quite compare.

I made this dish for my ladies book club a few days ago. I bought the fish at a speciality market, added fresh clams, mussels, shrimp, crab and red snapper. It wasn't that time consuming to prepare and was met with rave reviews. I had some base left over, so I added some more shrimp and crab and served it the next night! Think it was even better! A wonderful dish. I will definatly make this again!

Thought it was great. I browned the onions etc for awhile, thinking it would give the dish deeper flavor. Added mussels (which I should have added next to last, since clams take much longer to cook than mussels). Also added cracked crab. Excellent!

I added mussels and a lobster claw for looks, left out the onions and garlic because my True Love won't eat even trace amounts -- even without those elements, this is an outstanding version of a classic.
