I loved this recipe, also substituted cognac. I added peas which made me feel better about eating this deliciously rich dish!

I think if I made this dish again, I would not add so much gorgonzola...the dish was good, but so strong. It would also be good with less cream and more milk, to lessen the thickness, all three cheeses give it enough thickness I don't think it needs quite so much cream. Still, I'm full and satisfied!

It may not have the best name, but the taste is very yummy.

Great dish! I make this using bowtie (farafelle) pasta and it's an easy dish that tastes like you put much more time into it. Also excellent with grilled chicken added. Definitely not for waistline watchers though.

Lovely and simple. Made with fat-free half and half. With the cheese you don't need the heavy cream; although am sure it'd be decadent with! Added roasted chicken. I normally never give four forks, but this deserves more than three forks even if I'd not say it is "beyond compare."

This pasta was excellent. I also used cognac instead of the brandy and substitued the gorgonzola with Gruyere (thanks to another reviewer). I also added grilled chicken, sun dried tomatoes and some chopped artichokes. My guests loved it and I will be making this again. (For those still wondering, it's 1/4 cup of brandy.

Absolutely delicious. A lovely variation on "comfort food". I used Cognac instead of brandy and fiorentine pasta (holds the sauce better) instead of multi-colored rotini. I topped it with some buttered panko. Easy enough for a weeknight, but would also be great for company. This one is going into the rotation!

Wonderful! I followed the recipe as written except for substituting evaporated skim milk for the heavy cream--the dish is still creamy and delicious, but you save quite a bit of fat.

How much brandy???

I don't often give four forks, but this sauce really WOWed me! I haven't had pasta this good since I was in Milan a year or so ago. I substituted boursin for the goat cheese and gruerye for the gorgonzola. I also used congac, and feel that flaming it makes the dish. In general, I'm not a big pasta fan, but this is definately a keeper!

We loved this dish. Is it good for you? Probably not. But if you're going to serve and eat something this rich, it ought to be terrific, and this recipe delivers.

Served this as a side dish to the Salmon with Arugula & Tomato Sauce and was very pleased. So were my guests. This is a recipe you can fool around with a bit. I totally omitted the brandy, and added lots of extra garlic as well as fresh basil, oregano, etc. Also used 4 cheeses: goat, romano, parmesan & gorgonzola. Unlike a previous reviewer, I think the rich and strong cheeses are what really make this special. They also make this "heart attack on a plate" however, so I can only make this so often! Definitely a gourmet comfort food.

We both appreciated how quickly this dish was to prepare. We also added some grilled shrimp and roasted red bell peppers. With garlic bread and a salad, we had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day. Very tasty.

This is an easy but impressive dish with a distinctive flavor. It has been a hit each time I have made it. I come back to this both for entertaining and just for feeding my family.

I found that this a great tasting and easy recipe to make. All the ingredents as easy to find in my area. Went well with a salad and some crusty garlic bread for a simple meal with a rich taste. The only problem is the high fat content.

I thought this was excellent; creamy and flavorful, except that the Gorgonzola was a bit overpowering. I think when I make it again I will use less of that or perhaps try another cheese of similar texture, with a milder flavor.
