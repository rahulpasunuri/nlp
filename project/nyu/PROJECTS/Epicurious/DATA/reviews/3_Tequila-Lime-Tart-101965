I read that there would be too much filling so I used a regular frozen pie crust and it was the perfect amount. This is a great recipe and I can't wait to make it again.

I really expected to like this dessert - but I didn't. I think it was mostly a texture problem for me with the egg whites making it kind of grainy (the texture reminded me of ricotta cheese) and the lime flavor was not intense enough for my tastes either. I guess I was expectly my key lime pie in a tart with tequilla, I shouldn't have had such high expectations.

Looks like Geronimo gave out the identical recipe to Gourmet the exact same month. Who edits those magazines??

I have made this recipe a number of times...so frequently that I actually had to tell people that they had to choose a new dessert for a while! It's probably the #1 most requested dessert I make! Somebody once commented that it's like a margarita in a crust!!!

This is a great dessert! Simple and refreshing! When entertaining, adding a small lime wedge around is a fun extra finishing touch. Enjoy.

I used bottled Key Lime juice which made the taste a little strong definitely reccomend sticking with fresh lime juice. I cheated and used a store bought graham cracker crust so will try again with the right crust. Definitely a keeper though.

To the Cook in New Haven, CT: to avoid the crust puffing up and distorting, you can use pie weights (I know Williams-Sonoma carries them)and cook the crust most of the way, then afterwards [take out the pie weights]add the filling and bake it just long enough until it is set.

I don't usually try dessert recipes since I live in Santa Fe and there is generally a need for high altitude adjustments,this however sounded to tempting. It was easy and delicious. A wonderful summer time treat.

Very tasty. Cooking time is important as stated in other reviews -- just cook enough to puff and set. Top with small, piped decorations of swiss meringue and lightly toast to make it extra sassy.

The cooking time is too long on this recipe. When I make a full size Key Lime Pie, it is baked at 325 degrees for only 15 minutes, just enough to set and sterilize the eggs. The results will be much better, lighter and tastier.

I didn't find this to be a very successful recipe. The problem was not the taste, for it tasted fine, although I wouldn't say I went into raptures over it. The problem was that it turned into a big mess. The filling puffed up as it baked, which made the edges look really sloppy and even spill over the sides of the pan. When the tart cooled, the filling sank, but then it developed deep cracks in the middle, all the way down to the crust. To make matters worse, when we tried to remove the bottom of the tart pan (I've got a non-stick pan with a removable bottom, by the way), the tart wouldn't budge! So my husband had to use a spatula to get it off, and ended up breaking the tart in half, and, well, I think you can imagine what it looked like. Still, I pieced the whole thing together, covered it with whipped cream to hide the cracks, and served it up at a buffet-style dinner. No one even so much as touched it. I ended up eating the whole thing myself! (With a spoon, because cutting it into pieces was hopeless by that point!) Beware with this recipe. If you decide to make it, grease the tart pan, even though it doesn't say you need to.

A note on tequilas: Use white non-aged tequilas for cooking or you will get a strong aftertaste. Here in Mexico Sauza hornitos or Herradura blanco are wonderful for cooking.

Was very good. The pie went so quickly I had to make another just to try it myself, and that one also had no left overs.

We compared this to two key lime pie recipes we tried recently and it wasn't as good as either. Maybe substituting egg beaters, fat free condensed milk and peanuts didn't help.
