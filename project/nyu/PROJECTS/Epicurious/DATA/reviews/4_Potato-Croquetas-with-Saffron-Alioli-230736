Just about any fried potato bite can be addictively tasty, but these herby poufs are elegant & sublime. Two items you must have for this recipe are the ricer (no amount of smashing, beating, blending or assaulting can produce its fluffy results) and tarragon (dried is fine!). A smoked paprika alioli is nice too.

These were good, although a big bland - the sauce is delicious. They are a lot of work to make and I'm not sure they are worth it. My guests did like them

These came out well, but were not outstanding. They were a bit of a pain to make. If I did it again, I would add a little cheese to the inner potato filling so that it would melt and make the inside more interesting. Even some parmesan on the inside would be good. The aioli really helped. I would also be sure when frying to get them brown before taking them out so you have a good crisp outside to contrast with the inside. Given the amount of effort, I would consider another appetizer.

Panko bread crumbs are highly suggested, and fresh tarragon is key. A potato ricer isn't a necessity, but the texture is worth it. A "hands down, winning, crowd pleaser" when paired with the Saffron Alioli, although many guests will DEVOUR the croquettas by themselves. And, also exceedingly easy: You can make them ahead, throw in the deep fryer and serve as passed hors d'oeuvres with tooth picks (and dipping sauce).

I have to figure out how to write this review without using lots of swear words. Holy Jeebus was that amazing. I went with a couple of suggestions: used panko breadcrumbs and used paprika (smoked hot, in my case) for the sauce. I used a ricer rather than mashing, and while I can't say if mashing would have given the same texture, the ricing made for the absolute perfect texture to the potatoes. They were delicately soft and delicious inside, nice and crunchy outside, and for a first attempt at deep frying anything, I couldn't have asked for better. I used a deep-fry thermometer and a dutch oven, if that helps anyone. I will definitely make again, though I might up the chives and lessen the tarragon ever so slightly.

This recipe is magnificent! The potato balls melt in your mouth and are quite flavorful. I also made the saffron alioli and it has become a sauce that I use regularly.

There are many reasons why I love this recipe. The first is that it is fun to make. I thought it was a fun, and unique, experience rolling the potatoes in your hands to make balls. I can imagine this step being really fun with children; however, the rest of it would need heavy adult supervision. Secondly, they smelt delicious the entire time through and tasted great. I plan on making a simple mashed potato dish with all the herbs. The only problem is that the oil that you need is expensive and Im not sure if you absolutely need to have the more expensive oil to fry your potatoes, and there is a lot of left over oil. Furthermore it does take a while to make. I was making this for a potluck, and found that the steps took a lot of time to get through. What I suggest when you make it is, forget the dipping sauce, its good but it includes a lot of mayonnaise and the flavor of the potatoes are good enough. Furthermore, prepare your oil while you are waiting for them to chill in the fridge. I was in a hurry, put mine in the freezer, made the dipping sauce, then turned on the oil and it took a long time to heat up, so in the end the freezer didnt speed anything up, the oil just slowed me down. However, if I can confirm that I can use cheaper oil, or even reuse oil, I would make this several times a month. I thought they were delicious and there are so many possibilities you can do, such as stuffing them. They are fun appetizers and all my friends enjoyed them. I will definitely make these again!

These were amazing. I made them for a party of 50 and they were a big hit!

Good stuff. I added some hot peppers to the mix and it was a nice extra touch.

I made these on Thanksgiving as an appetizer to tide guests over before the big dinner. Everyone - kids and adults - dove in and devoured them in no time. The alioli provided just the right kick, and a contrasting texture to the crispness of the croquetas. I plan to make them again over the weekend for the next wave of family members to enjoy.

This recipe is amazing--the flavor of the croquetas with the sauce is wonderful. I served it with salmorejo, manchego cheese and membrillo (quince paste), tortilla, and sangria, and we were all in heaven.

Made these for a New Years Eve party - to great compliments. Simple ingredients and preparation with satisfying results. Alioli was a delicious accompaniment.

These were so delicious that I have made them twice. Great success both times. The saffron alioli is what makes this dish so special. This is a keeper.

These are really great! My siblings and I are preparing a joint dinner for our father's 75th birthday, and I was assigned the starch. After testing a few other recipes, this one was the winner to go along with a beef tenderloin with a mushroom stuffing. It's pretty easy, although forming the croquettes in a larger quantity (I'm quadrupling the recipe) can be time consuming. I tested the recipe on my husband and myself for dinner, and we both loved it. 3-4 generous tablespoon sized croquettes are a good portion to be a part of the main meal. I used peanut oil rather than olive oil, and it's totally fine. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Yes, it's basically deep fried, seasoned mashed potatoes, as another reviewer commented, and I just used my potato masher, rather than a potato ricer. You can warm the butter by microwaving it on High for 10 seconds. As far as the Saffron Aioli is concerned, I don't think it's necessary, particularly if it's part of the main course, rather than as an appetizer. The croquettes are great on their own. I did add a few dashes of hot sauce to the aioli, because I felt it needed a little bit of a "kick". The "big event" is tomorrow night, so I'll add a review after the feedback from others!

Made this appetizer for a cocktail party and they were quickly devoured. Did not have a potato ricer - a hand mixer works just as well.

The perfect hors d'oeuvres: cheap, easy and delicious! It's the perfect starter for anyone from a meat-and-potatoes Midwesterner to an experienced New York connoisseur. And the recipe is completely forgiving if you alter the seasonings. It's basically deep-fried mashed potatoes; how could you possibly go wrong?

This is a keeper! You wouldn't believe how fast these disappeared.I've made them twice. The 2nd time was easier & I added a beef filling similar to the puertorican "papas rellenas". I also used Panko according to a previous review. Now, that I've found Panko, I will keep this in my pantry at all times.

I loved this dish! I decided to stuff some of the croquetas with cooked red pepper and onion. For the meat-eaters, I stuffed them with the red pepper, onion, and linguica. The saffron alioli was fabulous. I will definitely make this again. The alioli I'm going to try with a nice piece of salmon and some asparagus.

This was fantastic. I tried a batch with regular bread crumbs and with Panko. The lesson: use Panko! Regular breadcrumbs were soft while the Panko were crisp and crunch and nicely textured. For the Alioli I did not use Saffron. Instead I added a half tsp of cumin. It was excellent.
