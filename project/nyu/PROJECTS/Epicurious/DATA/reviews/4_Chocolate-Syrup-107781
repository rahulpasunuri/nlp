I agree this syrup is simple and delicious . Perfect for ice cream, not sweet but semi sweet. It is my new go to syrup, no need to use store bought anymore!

This syrup is rich and delicious. It is actually thicker than a syrup, but dissolves easily in beverages. Store bought syrup in a squeeze bottle cannot touch this recipe.

Delicious! I made this for hot chocolate, and it is absolutely perfect. I'm fairly picky about my hot chocolate -I like the one starbucks serves- and don't like it to be too sweet. This one works EXACTLY as I would have hoped!!! Honestly, I was debating over stopping for a hot chocolate at starbucks on my way to work today. I ended up having a few extra minutes so I decided to try to make my own instead (and save myself $4). SUCCESS!!! All of the ingredients are in my kitchen already, also! YUM. I will be trying this with other ingredients for sure (espresso for a mocha, a little cinnamon for a mexican hot chocolate, etc etc)!!! YUM

Quick and easy. Plus no high fructose corn syrup. I had to make a 2nd batch since we quickly ate up the first.

Nice bittersweet chocolate sauce! I made it in about 5 minutes. I was looking for a non-dairy easy to make chocolate sauce and I'd definitely make this again. Used half sugar and half splenda and it came out great!

A great recipe for basic chocolate syrup. Not too sweet, so it pairs well with already sweet desserts (I used it to garnish/decorate a cheesecake). Has a lovely sheen, but doesn't refrigerate terribly well - not a huge problem since the recipe makes a reasonably small quantity.

Why did I ever bother to buy chocolate syrup? Very easy and good. The second time we used 1/2 water and 1/2 coffee and infused the syrup with fresh mint from the garden. Very good; tasted like a minty mocha coffee drink. Next time we'll try using all coffee.

I agree with the other reviewers--easy and delicious. No need to buy chocolate syrup again. Plus, this is a low-cal, no-fat treat that can really help pull someone through a diet (with a little fruit or frozen yogurt)!
