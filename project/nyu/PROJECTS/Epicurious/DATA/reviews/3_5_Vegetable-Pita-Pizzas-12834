I really enjoyed this and it tasted exactly how I expected to taste (which is to say, vegetables + pizza = delicious). However, a few notes: I used three pita loaves (instead of two) and also cut down on the bell pepper (one medium instead of two small) and zucchini (1/2 c. instead of 3/4 c.). I had exactly the right amount of vegetables to pile high on my pitas so my thinking is that the recipe as written would leave you with quite a surplus of vegetables. I used Gruyere/Parmesan instead of mozzarella/Parmesan because I wanted to use what I had in the fridge. This was fine. I used substantially less olive oil and cheese than the recipe called for just because I like to try and make things healthier. This came out fine, although I'm sure my husband would have preferred more cheese! If I were making this for guests, I would use more cheese, but if you like vegetables and are health-conscious, you can definitely skimp on the cheese and still have a very tasty meal. THIS IS GREAT TO REHEAT FOR BREAKFAST. The pitas crisped up again when broiled and I think it tasted even better than the night before. We will definitely make this again.

Great weekday meal. I've made these several times. Fresh basil's great, but when I don't have any I use dried. I also add some red pepper flakes. I didn't use onion, but if I did, I'd use a lot less than an entire small red onion.

A great appetizer cut into wedges or a light summer meal with a glass of wine.

I was looking for something easy which would use some of my husband's garden veggies. This was perfect. The pita crust has a nice crunch. I am going to try it with crumbled cooked bacon next time; I bet that would be a nice complement. Will make often, with varying veggies, depending on what's poppin' up in the yard at the time...

So easy! Can add practically anything. Definately taste that the pita is wheat. Definately do NOT omit the fresh tomato on top.

Made it for a "girls-only dinner" and there was plenty for 3 people, plus leftovers for 2 more pizzas. I used Greek flat bread pita instead of "pita loaf" (since I wasn't sure what that is) and substituted dried basil for fresh but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. Yum. I'll definitely make this again when I'm in a pizza kind of mood instead of ordering out.

Very tasty! Add a little red pepper flakes to add some zip!
