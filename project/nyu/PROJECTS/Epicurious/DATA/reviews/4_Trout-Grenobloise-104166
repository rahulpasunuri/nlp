So Good! So easy! It was my first time to cook trout. Loved it.

Use Ghee (clarified butter). It makes all the difference in sauting fish. Any other fish fillet would work with this recipe.

I made this recipe with MahiMahi and my family loved it! And it was sooo quick and easy. I skipped the flour.

Excellent! I added a minced shallot to the browned butter sauce. This one is a keeper!

So simple and absolutely delicious. I didn't have any lemons on hand, so I substituted white wine vinegar for the lemon juice. I can't wait to make it again!

This recipe gets 4 forks because it is very tasty and it is so very simple and quick to make. I did add the lemon zest and wine, but I think next time I'll pull back on the zest a little. I really enjoyed how this turned out, but want to let some of the other flavors come through more.

Great recipe for trout. Easy and delicious. Based on other reviews I made extra sauce, but did not need it in the end. Will make this again when I can get fresh trout.

I followed this recipe exactly, and perhaps our lemon was juicier than most? We both found the sauce (of which there was plenty for two trout) was too sour, from too much lemon. I would definitely make this again, but would substitute equal parts of the juice of half a lemon and white wine for the juice of an entire lemon.

I don't know how to butterfly a trout; I removed the backbone in order to lay the trout out flat, so the ribs remained and made this a lot of work to eat. I will try it again but leave fish whole. I also added some lemon zest and Chardonnay as other reviewers suggested and the sauce ended up rather overpowering -- I think next time I'll try the sauce as written. It was still yummy and warrants another attempt.

This one is definitely one for the recipe box! Mmmm . . . good. I added thyme and dill to the fish before coating with flour. Try it . . . you'll like it! cheers

This was very good, but, like another reviewer, I added some lemon zest with the juice. Also, I sauted some mushrooms in the oil after removing the fish. I then added a splash of white wine at the end and let in boil for about 1 minute. Otherwise there was definitely not enough sauce.

I made this dish last night--and it was wonderful. Easy to prepare, cooking time was perfect, and lemon sauce was a good. I added lemon zest as well as the lemon juice; this gave a very nice lemon flavor. The capers were a nice touch too.

I have made this recipe 2 times and each time my family loved it....even my children who won't usually eat trout. This is by far the best trout recipe that I have ever made!

Our family found this dish excellent. We have made it for dinner several times already and remains one of our favorite dishes. Definitly a quick, simple and tasty meal. Only 2 things I did differently: the first was that instead of using trout, I used tolapia. The other is that you need to add more butter, because there is not enough sauce.

Mmmmm Good! Subtle, yet full of flavour that did not overpower the fish. I used the recipe exactly, adding seasoning salt to the dredging flour instead of regular salt. So simple. I made extra sauce to put on the asparagus accompanying it.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. Can't wait for trout season to start again. As soon as we go out and catch the fresh trout, this is the recipe my husband and I will use over and over again.

I meant to review this a long time ago. I've made this at least a half dozen times and it's always been perfect, it's my favorite trout recipe. I skip the capers and usually add some slivered almonds to the sauce. I also flavor the flour some with some assorted dried herbs.

good. but remember to rinse out the capers or it gets too salty

Surprisingly easy and delicious! Although not in anyway complex in terms of favor, I enjoyed the simplicity of this unassuming dish.

It was very easy to fix and we really enjoyed the flavor it add to the trout.

Good, standard recipe. It made very little sauce, though; it all evaporated in the pan too quickly. I also would increase the capers.

Fantastique! Incroyable! Served with sauted spinach, how eating should be. Simple, savory and scrumptious. The second time i jazzed up a simple chicken breast.

Simple and delectable! My five year old ate every last bit; my husband told me that if it was served in a restaurant they would charge a fortune for it. A sure winner! I served with Rasa, a mild white fish as the store had no trout.

Excellent and easy! My husband showed up with fresh Steelhead Trout (from his bi-annual grocery shopping excursion) and I had it on the table in 15 minutes!

I used the grenobloise technique with monkfish fillets. My guests loved it. Really good recipe -- the tangy lemon and salty capers cut the flavors of the rich butter and fish. Yum.

A great recipe for fresh fish. Pan-fried trout is always a favorite, and this quick sauce adds the perfect finishing touch.

This dish is SO very easy and SO SO very delicious! It is now a favorite in my family! My husband and I never ever had capers before and we are now big fans of this special little "herb".

Very easy, very tasty. A big hit with both my dining companions (one with a pickier appetite than the other). I made it with steamed gold potatoes with butter and parseley. I subbed lake whitefish for trout and added dill. Very good!

Quick,Easy,and Very Good. I embellished upon the original recipe with great results. The fish was salt & peppered and then sprinkled with Paul Prudhomme's "Seafood Magic" seasoning blend prior to dusting the fish with flour. I also doubled the amount of capers. The "encores" are pouring in! ~BL~
