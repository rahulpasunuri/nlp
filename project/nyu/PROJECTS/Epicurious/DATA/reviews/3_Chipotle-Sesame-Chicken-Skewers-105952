I made this as a main course for dinner using chicken tenders. The sauce is fantastic - the lime and the chipotle give it a good zing. The only change I made was to add about a tsp. of the adobo sauce in addition to the 2 tsp of chipotle.

I did this for a pool party and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Since it's always a challenge to use a whole can of chipotle, I also made chipotle salsa using an epicurious.com recipe. More raves. Am getting ready to make the chicken again for a friend's birthday.

I have made this three years in a row and regulars at our holiday party find it wonderful and ask for it. It is easy to make !

It's delicious b/c of the zing. So good!

Have to agree with the cook from Lake Elsinore. I grilled the chicken expecting something with a "burnt on" flavor but it turned out like chicken grilled wth ketchup. Would not recommend this recipe.

Perhaps Chef P doesn't OWN a dictionary (hence hasn't heard about the idea of alternate spellings). ;)

When it came down to it-it just tasted like ketchup covered chicken. Yuck!

Actually, it's more a debate than a debacle. The Merriam-Webster dictionary (the spelling resource used in academic and journalistic circles) lists both spellings as acceptable. I think "chile" comes from Spanish, and "chili" is the English variation taken from the Spanish. Does any of this remind you of the a??l-retentive chef on Saturday Night Live?

Chef P, I haven't made this either. However, this is just a comment on the use of the word "purest." This "chili-chile" debacle seems to have you confused on your vowel usage. If you are going to lord it over the rest of us, at least have the common courtesy to spell correctly. We would never use "jurk" or "pampas ass", would we?!

I AGREE - Chef P, Get a Life and stop posting the same comments everywhere... some people are here to read about real comments and not your rantings...

I served these at a cocktail party. I was sick and in bed all night, but when I came out wish everyone farewell ALL of these skewers were gone. So I am assuming they were pretty good because I have picky friends. Also prepared these in the morning, covered them and just popped in the oven and garnished when my guests arrived.

I wasn't going to respond to "Chef P" before trying this dish, but after reading his outraged posting on two different recipes I have to say this: Rants are fine, but make sure you practice what you preach. There's not much point getting worked up about regional variations of foreign words -- i.e., whether it's chile or chili -- if you can't spell or punctuate English properly. Please, let's not be purists unless we know it's not "lets" and "purest." Thanks.

I haven't made this recipe yet, it looks pretty good though. This is a comment on the use of the word "chili" and "chilies". I am a chef born and raised in the Southwest. It is CHILE or CHILES. Chili is the tex-mex dish made with chili powder and beef, sometimes beans (although not if you are a chili purest). I don't mean to get off on a rant here, but if you are going to write recipes for Mexican and Southwestern dishes at least have the common courtesy to spell the ingredients correctly. I know that this is sometimes accepted, but that is by people who frankly do not know any better. We would never write fwa graw, or bree, so lets not bastardize the Mexican and Southwestern cuisine ingredients. Thanks, Chef P

I cannot understand how the test kitchen got 120 pieces of chicken out of this. This maybe made half that amount. I used 2 chipotles in adobo and added a splash of tequila to the sauce to round out the flavour, and after sprinkling the chicken with a tablespoon or so of mexican dry spice rub, I marinated the cubes instead of brushing the sauce on before cooking. I also baked them for 4-5 minutes in a 400 oven instead of broiling them. They were very moist, tender, and perfectly seasoned. The taste of the sauce was quite good, though, and instead of having dipping sauce, I would just increase the amount of chicken next time by at least half, but I think that it could be doubled with fine results.
