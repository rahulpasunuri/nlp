I've been making this recipe for years. I add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a 1/4 teaspoon cayenne after I add the caramel. I use kosher salt at the end. They are a huge hit. The recipe is a little fussy in that if I add the amount of cream called for the truffles are very soft, almost too soft. But then if you use too little you run the risk of them being too firm.

These are excellent! I've followed others' advice on doubling the caramel. The dipping process was a little bit messy, and the result was uneven sizes and shapes of truffles. Will try to pour the ganache in candy molds, roll them with hands, arrange them on a rack, and drizzle the chocolate instead of dipping them. Couldn't wait to make another batch.

This is the second time I made this recipe and I decided to increase the caramel to chocolate in the truffle filling. It didn't work, the chocolate and caramel never really hardened. I made extra chocolate turtles with it instead, there was no way to make balls. Oh well. Next time I'm gong back to the original recipe, it's yummy.

These are fantastic! I've made them twice. The first time, I followed the recipe almost exactly (I looked up instructions for tempering the coating chocolate-- not sure why that's not included in the recipe), and they turned out beautifully. Just melt-in-your-mouth wonderful. Even though they were excellent, I was a little disappointed that I could barely taste the caramel. So on the second time around, I followed some commenters' suggestions and doubled the caramel (and added a splash of bourbon to it). The caramel flavor was certainly stronger, but I felt the additional caramel made the ganache a bit too firm for my taste. It didn't have quite the same melt-in-your-mouth quality as the original recipe. I suggest following the recipe as is.

Definitely for someone who LOVES dark chocolate....i.e. my hubby. I am NOT sure who is posting that the chocolate that the truffles are being dipped in is SUPPOSED to be "tempered" but that is NOT the case here. The truffles are being stored in the refrigerator, therefore there is NO need to "temper" the dipping chocolate. I would recommend people don't advise others to do anything differently in regards to the chocolate for dipping. Will do again for hubby as I am NOT a dark chocolate fan.

If you use cotton or heavy rubber gloves when handling the ganache, it won't melt on you :)

Made these for Valentines Day to rave reviews and making them again for a party. I am no candy expert, and was nervous about stirring the hard carmel with the cream, but it did in fact, melt beautifully with a bit of patience. I used semi-sweet chocolate for the filling, and Lindt dark chocolate with a touch of sea salt for the coating. I only got about 24 the first time so I will try to make them a little smaller this time. If you love the combination of salt and caramel...these are for you!

This is a good recipe that just needs a few extra tweaks to get it perfect: 1) Double the caramel. 1) Add in a couple drops of lemon juice to the caramel mixture. When the caramel is to the desire color, remove from heat. Whisk in the cream in small additions (it will bubble and steam) until the mixture has cooled and settled. No need to put it back on the heat after this. 3) If you prefer a saltier caramel, add more salt - the amounts in this recipe are very subtle. 4) When shaping the ganache, try to avoid touching it as much as you can - I used two spoons to do the majority of the shaping because the moment you touch it, it starts to melt. You've just got to develop a good system! 5) No need to chill overnight, a few hours to harden up is fine. BUT, when you're ready to dip, only remove them from the fridge a few at a time. 6) Let your tempered chocolate cool just a bit before dipping. I gathered most of the chocolate with a spatula into a corner of the bowl, then dipped with a fork - that way the chocolate is deep enough to coat but you don't have to temper a ton of it. Also tried hand rolling, but found it too messy. 7) Be creative! The best part of this recipe is that it's such a good base. Add more/less salt; I drizzled some in white chocolate to give a different look. They look beautiful in a box when put all together.

I doubled the sugar and water as per suggested. I wanted a less chocolately filling even so, but that's okay, it was delicious and everyone went crazy for them. It is a challenge to keep everything cold, I did have to keep throwing truffles in the freezer to firm them up as I worked.

Rating: 2
Guess I should have read the other reviews first, as my caramel just didn't turn out great when done per recipe (I actually threw out one batch and had to do a second which I did leave alone pretty much as others have suggested). Also, even after about 30 hours in the fridge, I still needed to practically ice my hands to be able to roll them without getting a huge melted mess. So, two forks for great flavor, but bad directions and too soft centers.

Rating: 3
Excellent truffle center. I followed others' advice and doubled the sugar & water for the caramel, and let it boil unstirred until dark amber. Delicious! I looked up how to temper chocolate online, though -- this recipe was not very clear. I also had trouble with the cocoa powder preventing the tempered chocolate from sticking; next time, I will just skip the powdering process. With dark/bittersweet chocolate used for both the core and coating, I think these had plenty of dark chocolate flavor, anyway!

Rating: 4
Follow the recipe for the caramel and these will turn out perfectly. The caramel will be runny - not like a thick one you put on ice cream. It's supposed to be this way so when you mix it with the chocoate it makes a perfect texture for a truffle that literally melts in your mouth. Don't panic when the caramel turns to crystal when you add the cream to it. This is the reason you cook it over low heat until it melts and mixes with the cream. Sometimes I just roll the truffles in the cocoa powder and skip the last rolling in chocolate for a more rustic look. They are good either way you make them. If you want a chewier caramel truffle then use twice sugar/water called for but don't change the amount of cream.

Made these exactly per recipe for a upcoming cookie exchange but it did not make 32. Only reason I am giving it 3 stars is that I used a tablespoon measure and only got 19 truffles. I had to make another batch of the truffle mix to make at least 2 dozen to take. I ended up with 3 dozen to take with 4 left over for my husband to taste. So I think that the recommended amount it makes should be readjusted.

I made these for Valentine's Day - to the reviewer below: mine are headed TO Florida to my fiance. Maybe our packages crossed in the air, right? Anyway, I am primarily a baker; I've never made candy, but these turned out very well. I doubled the caramel, but didn't cook it enough the first time around (it was liquid thin when combined with the cream), so I dumped it and tried again, this time letting it get quite dark and just about ready to burn/smoke, as another reviewer suggested. It blended much better that time. I used 60% cacao for the filling and the shell. The caramel flavor is subtle, but they are still delicious. I tempered the chocolate without a thermometer (didn't quite fit the bowl properly) and am proud to say they came out shiny and snappy. I did have issues dipping because I let the filling warm up too much before dipping (unless your work area is very cool, I'd take a half-batch out at a time) and didn't have enough chocolate in the bowl towards the end (another reviewer suggested using less - I needed the full amount - you can always save the rest for later usage). These are 4-fork worthy if used with quality ingredients.

Rating: 4
This was my first time making both caramel and any type of truffle. These turned out to be delicious!! They are so rich and chocolatey, with the perfect amount of salt to satisfy all my cravings. I used Scharffen Berger bittersweet chocolate, which was a great choice. As many reviewers suggested, I doubled the caramel, which was perfect. I really didn't temper the chocolate correctly, so the coating was not as crisp and uniformly shiny as I would like it, but still really good. Just sent some to my boo across the country for Valentine's Day... hopefully they survive the trip!

im confused! mine is definitely NOT rolling into a nice looking ball. Using a tablespoon to measure and using the recipe, doubling the sugar + water w a few drops of lemon per earlier reviews, I only got 15! what am i missing here... they are really soft and don't stay in ball shape even though i left the filling to chill in refrigerator to firm overnight. Would love to get this right. HELP!

These turned out so beautifully! I followed the recipe but did cheat on the caramel - I used Trader Joe's fleur de sel caramel sauce (yum) rather than making it from scratch, and these were super easy as a result. Also used TJ's chocolate chips for the chocolate and people absolutely raved about them. Whodda thunk?

Rating: 4
These were wonderful! I too doubled the sugar and water for a little more caramel flavor. I seasoned with lavender sea salt and used about 1/2 the chocolate specified for dipping. I had to make a 2nd batch and should have made a 3rd because I had to ration them out on Christmas Day.

Rating: 3
I doubled the caramel like others suggested (and added a tbls of bourbon). They taste delightful but are too gooey - they didn't hold their shape. Especially when coated in hot chocolate. Soooo....they don't exactly look like truffles, even though they taste good. Maybe freezing the caramel before dipping in chocolate would have helped.

Rating: 4
These are delicious! I ended up with half the number of truffles, however, because I made them a little too large. You do not need 12 oz chocolate for the dipping process. 8 oz would do. I used Scharffen Berger semi-sweet chocolate. Yum.

I made these as part of a big dessert spread at a friend's engagement party. They were the first thing gone. I incorporated most of the suggestions made previously: 1) increased caramel (sugar + water, not whipping cream) for the ganache, 2) added a few drops of lemon juice to the sugar + water for the caramel, and 3) didn't stir the boiling sugar at all. Everything went smoothly. For the chocolate coating, I did palm coat them rather than dip. I liked the resulting crisp, thin coating of chocolate on the outside. I definitely didn't need all of the dipping chocolate called for. My only complaint/confusion, is that I didn't get nearly the number of truffles the recipe claims. I used a shy tablespoon of ganache in each, yet only got about 30. Hmm. I'm not too experienced with candy, so I was really happy with how deliciously these turned out. They will definitely be a go-to special treat.

Rating: 4
These chocolates are mind blowing. I have made this recipe several times and it has never disappointed. I used twice the sugar and water as per the other comments. Consider experimenting with different types of chocolate, but do make sure to use the same chocolate on the inside as you do for the coating - the flavor is much more pleasant that way. My favorite is using Callebaut milk, although Callebaut dark also yields delicious results. Yum!!!

NYT has a version of this printed in 1881! [ http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages /pdf/magazine/20100214-caramels- recipe.pdf ] I have not made the recipe as described yet. Got derailed to a very simple version: very dark caramel [suggar in the rough melt without water] with bitter chocolate [stirred in the caramel off heat - when still liquid but not bubbling]. The result is a hell of a crunch, demanding to be poured in ribbons. Over crusted almonds it makes an intriguing brittle. Just a thought...

These truffles are amazingly easy and delicious. Using 2-3 drops of lemon juice in the sugar-water mixture as recommended was a huge help, and we were able to stir occasionally. For the chocolate caramel Ghirardelli bittersweet chips mixed with Green & Black's 72% dark baking chocolate with extra cocoa butter for easy melting worked etremely well. Because of the extra bitterness, we decided not to roll the filling balls in cocoa, which we thought would make the truffles a little too dark. We found a very simple tempering process. This made the truffles look shiny and professional. We found that twelve oz. of dipping chocolate was more than enough. We also uses a double- teaspoon size for the filling balls, instead of a tablespoon, which seemed pretty large. Great recipe!

Rating: 4
I love this recipe. I've brought it to parties and everyone else loved these delicious truffles. I suggest you don't roll them into perfect balls. A rough shape creates intrigue and sends the message the truffles are hand made. A tip for lazy people - you don't have to hand- dip the truffle in chocolate. I simply roll the truffle balls in cocoa and serve. The only negative is that if you keep them around a few days you may want to redust with cocoa to make them look pretty again.

My family goes crazy for these and they make wonderful gifts. I use Ghiradelli bittersweet and semisweet chocolate chips. Sometimes I add a dash of cayenne and cinnamon prior to adding the caramel for a little kick. Kosher salt is fine in place of Fleur de Sel.

After the sugar & water turned into something that looked like coral...I did it again and it really didn't turn amber but I got nervous so and I added the cream and the salt at the same time (idiot) and then added to chocolate- still good turned out tasty but I wanted to do it right So....I followed the advice to let the sugar melt with the water and 3 drops lemon juice over low heat- took about 5 min. Then I turned the heat up and it took about 8 min to get it amber- I did brush down the sides w water because I was paranoid. Added the caramel to the choc and then the salt- so good. Haven't dipped them yet but I figured the hard part it over!

Delicious, but certainly tricky. I followed earlier advice and didn't touch the boiling sugar/water mix at all. Ever. You have to just watch it boil away until it turns amber. I am not sure how they achieved success following the directions in the recipe, because all I got was crystallized sugar chunks following their advice. You also have to boil for much longer than 4-6 minutes. Second comment is on the chocolate dip. Is it just me, or is 12oz of chocolate in a medium double boiler 1/2 of what you really need to 'submerge' the caramel balls? I used a small double boiler and it barely submerged the first few. Getting the chocolate the right temperature is also devilish. I am sure 115 F is perfect if I could have maintained it for more than 2 minutes. Once the chocolate cooled, the truffles came out looking like roughly hewn chunks. There has got to be a better way to maintain a consistent temperature for the dipping. The truffles are lovely, though. Lots of great ideas on variations in the other comments.

Agree with the need for doubling caramel (forgot to re-read reviews for tips!) But as is they are rich and chocolatey! I used Scharfenberger chocolate as the quality is really good! Since I ruined the "wet" caramel by over-stiring and washing down the sides, I made a "dry" caramel second time around. So, same amount of sugar, no water, but still DON'T OVER STIR!!! Continued with recipe as directed. I microwaved all my chocolate. Temper by melting half the chocolate (30 sec. intervals, stirring in between) then after all melted, add other half and stir til completely melted. 10 sec intervals if needed to melt more. I also used toothpicks, which worked better than forks to dip, and lift out truffles. FYI, this was my first time making candy that worked!! So, if you are thinking its too hard, try it!! I'm glad I did:)

This is my go-to truffle recipe! We made these for our wedding favours and people are still talking about them. I didn't mind that they didn't taste very much like caramel as I found I enjoyed the consistency of this truffle far better than others, and was using this as a base recipe to add other flavours. This year, we are giving them as Christmas gifts and tried doubling the caramel as suggested and wow, they are just that much better! Now I can make the regular recipe for adding marzipan, balsamic vinegar, or nuts etc. and double the caramel for a real caramelly treat. As for people who are complaining about the mess...yes, they are messy, but who cares, it's chocolate! I figure baking is messy, so, enjoy it. I'll also over emphasize the NOT stirring part, because although it is tempting to stir the sugar and water while it's caramelizing, DON'T DO IT! I had to teach my husband that as he got in there and stirred and ruined the first batch.

I love this recipe and have made it a few times. I also had trouble with the caramel crystallizing initially, but I followed the recommendation below to add a little lemon juice and then let the sugar mixture boil without touching it, and that has worked well. I double the sugar for the caramel and also the saIt. To save time, I skip the laborious step of rolling the chilled ganache into balls and coating them with cocoa. I just pour the warm ganache into trays of silicone heart-shaped candy molds and refrigerate them overnight, then pop the hardened truffles out of the molds and dip them into the melted chocolate the next day. Not only is it easier than rolling the ganache into balls, it looks much better. The extra melted chocolate is perfect for chocolate-covered strawberries ( or any other fruit you have on hand).

outstanding! my husband and I have made this recipe multiple times to choruses of oohs and aahs. we always DOUBLE the caramel and the fleur du sel (we've also used run of the mill coarse sea salt, works well too), but we like salt a lot. definitely double the caramel, though, and make sure you let it get to the point of smoking slightly before pouring in the cream (makes for wonderful depth of flavor)!

Rating: 3
to lex5489--add all the caramel to the chocolate and stir gently to blend and that's it! For myself, I've just made the filling and it definitely needed more caramel flavor. So I right away started another batch of caramel with just as much sugar but when it was time I only added 1/3C of cream, much better. Very dark and much more intense flavor.

These worked out, and I've never dipped before. I don't understand why the recipe has you dip the truffles in the cocoa powder first, because this causes a little - but not major - issue with the dipping chocolate adhering. I made the truffles a little less than 1/2 inch in diameter using a small melon baller. They turned out small and cute, for serving at a party. This way I got about 100. It was fairly labor intensive. The chocolate, once melted, retained a decent enough temperature that it seemed to set nicely. I don't know if it was at 115 but my strategy was to just let it melt and leave it atop the double boiler, occasionally adding batches to my dipping bowl. If the chocolate felt hot or even very warm I'd let it cool a little, and all went fine.

these are very rich and the combination salt and chocolate is fabulous. However I did increase the caramel by 50% and still did not taste it. although time consuming, they are fairly easy to make, make sure you use good quality chocolate.I gave these as gifts to some of my "moms" that work for me for mothers day. I split the batch in 1/3s and rolled 1/3 in coconut, another in chopped almonds and the rest I topped with salt. Very good. Just want more caramel taste

My 2nd review on this recipe - still 4 forks - but wanted to mention my caramel "issue" in case anyone else has it. For some reason, my syrup always crystallizes before it starts to brown...and I end up making the caramel 3x before getting it right. Ugh! Consulted with a friend (trained pastry chef) and the recommendation: don't move or swirl pan, don't brush down sides. Just add 2-3 drops of lemon juice to your sugar and water, start it on low until all the sugar is COMPLETELY dissolved (you can stir during this part), and then crank up the heat to start the boiling process - DON'T TOUCH again until you're ready to add the cream. Walk away! And it takes a lot longer than 4-6 minutes in my kitchen. Perfection! I used the same amt of chocolate total - but used 12 oz for the filling (increased the caramel by another 50%) and netted 40 truffles. Last 8oz chocolate to HAND COAT truffles (uses so much less chocolate than dipping and makes a much thinner shell - still had some left over), and skipped the cocoa powder coating. They were the shining star again this year - perfect with red wine and scotch!

Delicous. I doubled the salt in the ganache because I love salty things. I also found that the ganache was pretty hard when refridgerated, and feel that if I made this again, I'd make and add more caramel to it. I also added chopped raisins (1 full snack size box) that I'd steeped in whisky, Amaretto and Grand Marnier to the ganache, and was surprised that with this addition of wet material, that ganache was still harder than I'd prefer. I'd refrigerated the ganache to firm it up but found that I had to let it warm up a bit before it was pliable enough to roll. I found the caramel flavor to still be notable, even through all the dark chocolate, but would prefer it to be a little stronger. I also skipped all the coco powder as the bittersweeet chocolate is pretty potent as is. The overall flavor was fantastic, but as I said, I'd add more caramel to make it a little softer.

Rating: 4
I made these as an offering for a hoity-toity holiday party and they got raves. Even the people who found the salt unexpected ended up finding themselves going back for more. And I've got to tell you, these come out FABulously if you use fat-free half and half instead of the cream. Maybe they're even better using cream, but these were so good using ff 1/2&1/2 that I'm not sure the world could survive them being even better. If you decide to use ff 1/2&1/2, don't be worried when the caramel mixture is soupy instead of any kind of solid. (Is it solidish when you actually follow the recipe? I don't know.) Just stir stir stir (slowly to avoid incorporating air) and eventually the chocolate and the soup will meld into what will become a velvety inner truffle. Without a doubt these truffles received more raves than anything I have ever made.

A fantastic and forgiving recipe. I accidentally used 1 c of cream instead of 2/3 c, which left me with a gellid (but tasty) mess after refridgeration. I threw it back in the double boiler, added about a half cup more chocolate and another pinch of salt, and stirred until everything was smooth. After an hour in the freezer, it had set up nicely, and the taste was still to-die-for. I cooked the sugar until it was very dark as recommended by other reviewers (and almost panicked when I thought the whole batch was going to taste burnt!), and even after the extra added chocolate the caramel flavor was still evident. My coworks were impressed!

These taste like store-bought; high-end chocolate boutique store. I haven't met anyone who doesn't LOVE these. Today I was trying for a chocolate truffle with salt, smoke and heat, so I added chipotle puree (1.5 tbs as it's potent) to this caramel mixture after the cream went in and got incorporated. After chilling, I simply rolled them in balls slightly larger than a peanut M&M - were afraid they'd be too strong. Finally a dusting of cocoa...wow. Wonder how a cinnamon dust would've fared?

I made this christmas '05 along with other confections and sent as gifts to the fam and friends. They were and are a huge hit, I've used fleur de sel and smoked fleur de sel and they just go go go. I found that after eating one they are so intrigueing with the hint of salt and long mouth feel of the caramel and of course the chocolate that people can't help but eat 2 and 3 at a time. Most certainly is a mainstay in my repertoire.

Ooooh yum. I made these for a holiday party we were having and sent each guest out the door with them. Not one made it all the way to the elevator. Lots of compliments and requests for the recipe. Yes, hold your nerve with the caramel as dark amber is definitely the deal. Also it took me 2x to make the caramel correctly - first time came out as soup! Next time, maybe short the cream a bit and make sure to add it all at one time - stir stir stir. Once you mix it with the chocolate, it will be fine. I didn't dust with cocoa and used a F&W tip to ganache coat by hand. Just put a bit of the warm choc in your palm, add a truffle and give them a turn. Very little dripping and nice coat...only needed about 1/2 the coating chocolate though. SO wonderful!

A fabulous truffle recipe! Try using a small melon baller to scoop your chocolate. They may not be perfectly round- but close enough and you do avoid the mess of melted chocolate as you're trying to roll them.

I was quite pleased with the recipe, though I agree that the caramel flavor is so faint I didn't mention it to my gift recipients.

But that was fine...

My guests raved about these. I, however, thought they could have been better. This is partly my fault: I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips for the chocolate. They were a bit too sweet for me. Next time I will splurge on a whole chunk of bittersweet chocolate. The salt was a fabulous addition to finish these although I made some with colorful non-pareils for the kids. Big hit with them too!

Made these again this weekend, and I have to say that they are beyond compare. I have brought the left overs into work, and we have had several "When Sally Met Harry" scenes from grateful recipients!

I didn't dip them yet but wanted to get a review in for those contemplating this for V-Day. We taste tested after they were dusted in cocoa and chilled. They are great before the final dip.

The smoothness of the caramel in this truffle puts it over the top.

I have never made truffles before, but took a chance and whippped these up for a dinner party. They were a HUGE hit. I also tried some variety in the toppings - some with fleur de sel (sea salt for the uninitiated), some with black pepper (interesting zing), and some with cayenne (Wahoo! the hot + the sweet of the chocolate was very yummy). I liked the cayenne version best, but my guests thought the salt/chocolate combo was the best. Takes some planning - space it out over a few days - but WELL WORTH IT!!!
