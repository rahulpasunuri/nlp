The burgers definitely were difficult to maneuver on the grill, they kind of fell apart. They were excellent anyway. Next time, I might try a few unflavored bread crumbs to try to keep them together.

After reading all the reviews, I should have known better than to attempt these burgers. I tried the egg tip, I tried the aluminum foil tip... they still fell apart. Although they did have a good taste, it is not worth all the mess!

These burgers were soooo good! They fell appart, but we didn't care. I think it was my fault for turning them too many times. I will make this again and again. ( I just won't get drunk and mess them up again).

The secret to getting the burgers to hold together is to add one raw egg to the ground beef, mashed kidney beans, spices, and so on. Try this and you shold be able to prepare them on the grill without any problems.

Blah Blah Blah....I did the tinfoil thing and still had sloppy joes in the end. The taste wasn't anything exciting either. Ah well.... on to the next recipe.

True to form the burgers didn't hold together well. However, only one really lost it. Maybe adding some unseasoned bread crumbs might alleviate the problem. The crumbling didn't take away from the phenomenal taste. According to my husband, our household's only meat eater, they were the best tasting burgers ever. I reduced the horseradish slightly to accommodate his wimpy palate, but otherwise no changes were made.

I love the flavor of these burgers and I've made them three times, but each time they fall apart while cooking on the grill. So, next time I'll take Julie's advice and bake them.

Delicious! I baked them in the oven to avoid making a big mess on the grill. This was a huge hit with my family and seems like a good way to cut a little fat out of burgers without ruining the texture.

My family will like this better the next time when I lower the amount of garlic and barbeque sauce. The onions are great.

These burgers were tasty, maybe a little more pepper and salt. They fell apart, I think I'll put a little BBQ sauce in the burgers and save the rest for the outside, this may help in that department.

Loved the taste but made a mess of my grill. Any suggestions on binding the ingredients so that the burgers don't fall apart?

My husband was very leary of the beans, but ended up loving the flavor of these burgers! I did have trouble getting these to stick together - perhaps the beef (Laura's Lean) was too lean??

I made this last weekend for a group of hungry boys. There were no leftovers and I plan on making these burgers again this weekend. They are especially good with ground turkey.

It was really good. Not too spicy, but just spicy enough. My family really enjoyed it too. They were talking about days after I made it!
