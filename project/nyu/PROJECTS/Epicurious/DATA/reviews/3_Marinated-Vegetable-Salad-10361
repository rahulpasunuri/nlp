Served this at Easter. I thought it was just okay. My guests seemed to enjoy it though. After steaming I immediately put the veggies in an ice bath- it stopped them from cooking and preserved the color.

It was okay - I'll make it again but include a few of my favorite veggies like beets, potatoes, & green beans. Also, I dumped all the veggies into a bowl to dress and marinate - unfortunately, the broccoli continued to steam because of the trapped heat - next time I'll use a cookie sheet so the veggies are in a single layer.

Tastes delicious. The only problem I had was that the broccoli faded from bright green (after being steamed) to a less desirable color after being in the refrigerator overnight. I used 2 teaspoons dijon mustard since the recipe did not specify.

What is the 2 Dijon-style mustard? Teaspoons or Tablespoons?

I've made this twice for 2 family gatherings and each time there's not much left. In place of pearl onions, I used a red onion, thinly sliced which I added along with the peppers. I added all colors available for the bell peppers, used the smallest baby carrots. It made such a beautiful and colorful addition to the table. Next time I would like to add either sunflower seeds or slivered/sliced almonds.

This is a wonderful dish that makes a colorful side and gets lots of vegetables in those who don't care much for them! It is easy to prepare and a joy to serve.

Wow! This dish was so simple, but so delicious. I wouldn't change a single thing. Veggies came out perfectly cooked, not soggy at all. I'm thinking of making this again as part of our Easter dinner.
