This lightly spiced broth is exquisite. What a great thing to do when you want some healthy chunky veggies in a broth but you don't want boring. This is a keeper.

I receive a weekly box of vegetables from a local farm so I am often on the lookout for a recipe that uses a lot of vegetables. This one fit the bill! And it was very tasty! A couple of suggestions-- 1) to the person who submitted the recipe: perhaps you could give it a more "sexy" name, like "Vegetable Macedoine" and 2) to cooks: I would suggest making half the suggested quantity unless you have a REALLY big pot and a large family. Note that this dish makes a lovely gravy and it is good over polenta as well as couscous.
