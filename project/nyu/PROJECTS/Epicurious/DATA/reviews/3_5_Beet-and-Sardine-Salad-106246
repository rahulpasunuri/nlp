Delicious! I made a few changes, however. I love fresh beets (both raw and roasted), but am not a fan of pickled beets. I grated raw beets and added a bit of EVOO and white balsamic. I also used a ratio of about 2:1 of yogurt to sour cream to make it healthier. Used sardines in water for the same reason. Next time I would try this with herring. Used dried dill only because I didn't have fresh. Ate this on crisp bread crackers--yum!

Really tasty! Skipped the vegetable oil, added some red wine vinegar and lemon juice to the yogurt sauce (which I made more of a dressing), used dried dill, and served the whole thing over mixed greens. Delish!

I didnt try the recipe but I just wanted to point out that it is not weird at all. It just sounds russian (beet + sardine + dill). It sounds good to me.

Definitely weird, but I'll make it again b/c of the health value. I ultimately liked the flavor combo, but it needed a dash of red wine vinegar to bring it to life. It's incredibly easy to make when the mood strikes, (provided you have pickled beets and sardines in the pantry.) One note... this one won't win any beauty contests. It's a big pink/white mess once it's mixed. Next time, I'll skip the sour cream and try vinegar or lemon juice, both for the aesthetics and taste.

btw, i didnt bother with the oil and salt tossing of the beets, they are pickled after all, and with sardines, its plenty salty. i didnt miss the omission, nor the calories! super easy! also, dried dill is fine!! yay for 5 minute powerhouse!

So easy and such a cool and unusual combination of very different tastes and textures. I gave it 4 forks for the ease. I made some minor alterations to the recipe... In order to enhance nutritional value, I normally try to sneak extra veggies into just about everything I make. In this case, I tossed some sliced radishes with the beets, which added a nice crunch, and I served the whole thing on top of arugula tossed with sliced cucumbers and a lemony vinaigrette.

For those who LIKE sardines and beets - in addition to being a unique and tasty combination - this salad is a nutritional powerhouse. Both beets and sardines (packed in sardine oil, olive oil, or water - not vegetable oil) are wonderfully nutritious - and inexpensive! Enjoy.

Pretty simple concept here, folks: if you LIKE sardines, give it a go (it's delicious). If you DON'T this recipe will not change your mind and why are you making it?

I was very nervous about prepairing a dish with Sardines, but i was told i needed to expand my tastes. So i made this salad and i gagged. I couldnt stand the fish, i think i will stick to more normal combinations!

Thanks to the "Cook in Washington D.C." This recipe would sound disgusting to many people I know, but I happen to have made it and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a culture on a plate, and it's quite lovely. If you don't like the sound of it, simply don't make it. No problem. End of story. I love it!

Don't be a bigot... this recipe may not be to your taste (or mine, to be honest), but it is a perfectly lovely, traditional dish for a number of countries. If it doesn't appeal to you, don't make it. But you don't have to be childish about it.

I added some diced lutefisk, some headcheese, and a dash of 10-30 motor oil to offset the tartness of the beets. Life will never be the same
