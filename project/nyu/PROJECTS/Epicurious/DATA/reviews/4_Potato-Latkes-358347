This was a very disappointing recipe .After 40 yeears of using my Moms I thought it was time for a change.The potatoes were gummy from using oil in the recipe and flour and matzo meal were just too much. Back to my Moms!!!

Why is the oven pre-heated at 400 degrees when the latkes are pan fried?

My version of this was really different so I can't rate it, but this was hands down the best (base) latke recipe I've ever used. I used about 1.9lbs of potatoes, only 1 large onion because that's all I had, 1/2 cup olive oil instead of the 3/4 of corn oil, 1 tsp. of salt, and 1 cup of matzo meal instead of 2 since I reduced everything else. I also fried the latkes in olive oil. These latkes were very thick--there was not very much water in the batter. My ingredients made about 25 thick latkes.
