Used this as filler on a Cocktail Buffet...used grape tomatos and balsamic vinegarette and the bibb lettuce. It was a hit!

Used this as a light appetizer before Christmas Day dinner. Couldn't find bibb lettuce or endive, so used small romaine lettuce heads. Also added the fresh mozzarella. Delicious!

This is an excellent, refreshing appetizer! I used endive leaves instead bibb lettuce though and it was a very attractive little snack. I added diced mozzarella to the mixture as well.

I made this with penne pasta as an addition, and it was just great. Quick meal, and great for a picnic.
