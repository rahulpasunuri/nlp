I love this soup! It is easy and I have most all the ingredients in my pantry. I dont' have access to galangal so substituted fresh grated ginger. It is fabulous! I also sauteed the veg first and it gave it a nice earthy flavour. Mind you, when I made it the first time I made it per the instructions in the recipe. Both versions are a good soup.

I made twice size and it last for the one lunch. How good it is. I substitute cherry to vine tomatoes. And I cooked it only with straw mushrooms. It worth this 90 min. Cannot wait to make it (and eat it!) again!

I really loved this but I tweaked it a little... I added dried shiitakes and steaped them in the vegetable stock to rehydrate them and add more mushroom flavor to the vegetable stock... if you are a mushroom lover... this is definitely for you.
