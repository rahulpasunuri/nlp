I first saw this recipe, or a variant of it, in the Miami Herald years ago, and I think I have lost the recipe, which is why I am looking it up at Epicurious.com today. This is an excellent recipe if you make the following improvements: add a lot of finely chopped parsley (I think the amount was 1/2 cup -- do it in your mini food-processor), and two or four cloves of garlic, finely minced, to the ricotta mixture. It turns out a lovely green color. Also, add some ground beef and onion, which if you are married to my husband you will already have a supply of in your freezer in cup-sized portions, to the tomato sauce. SO: cook the spaghetti; place some in a bowl or on a plate; ladle on heated tomato sauce, with or without Italian sausage or ground beef w/ onions; add a couple of dollops of the tangy ricotta stuff on top. Very tasty.

I love this recipe... it has become a regular at our house, with spaghetti or lasagne noodles, and homemade sauce. Sometimes i add italian sausage. Quick, easy, very good when short on time.

I would definetly AGREE with WEST VIRGINIA. This is just a spaghetti dinner with ricotta cheese, not something I would serve my children anyway.

I wasn't impressed by this recipe. Just regular spaghetti is better,

I couldn't help but notice the amount of ricotta called for. It seems to me that one cup is 8 ounces, no matter the content, and one cup of ricotta can't be one pound (16 ounces) as written. No, I didn't make this spaghetti lasagne, but it's the only time I've made a comment without making the dish first. I think in the present instance it's permissible.

Wow, West Virginia, how snarky can you get! I clicked on this recipe because I am desperately searching for something my VERY picky 2 year ols will eat. He hates lasagne, but likes spaghetti... this looks like a good way to have both (with obviously some tweaking). Chill out!

I'd agree with most of the reviewers that this recipe is just so-so, but it is an easy weeknight dinner. With long work days, I am always looking for things that I can whip together during the week that don't take too long, but that don't make me resort to frozen dinners or anything like that. Coupled with a salad, this fits the bill. I don't know about other reviewers on this site, but as much as I like to cook and eat, I can't make a three course gourmet meal every night of the week!

Hey, nice responses to WV! A suggestion for this recipe: My secret ingredient for spaghetti sauce, whether homemade or store bought, is to add some good ol'fashioned butter The flavor is greatly enhanced, but not overly rich. My family now loves my spaghetti sauce! Woohoo!

Oh dear West VA, please lighten up!!! The recipe was billed as mom's little helpers for heaven's sake! There are a lot of kids out there who would eat this, but not lasagne and moms do need something easy for a mid-week meal. Give me a break and like I always say, "Food Police need to Stop the Brutatlity!"

Just a note about the last review and a general comment about this recipe that I won't try. I absolutely hate lasgna made with uncooked pasta, I can always tell. The pasta has a transparent tough texture. Further, this "I hate all the work of....", well why would you be at this site if you didn't really like to cook. There are plenty of quick meals for when you don't feel like much preparation or don't have time to spend cooking. However, I resent it when people try to take a classic recipe and make it "easier".

I didn't make this recipe yet so I cannot rate it. But, when I make lasagne I do not boil the noodles before using them. I make sure the sauce is very hot, layer the lasagne in the usual fashion using uncooked noodles and top off the dish with a layer of hot spaghetti sauce and cheese. I cover it and bake for an hour and then let it set up for awhile (if we're not too hungry). The noodles cook in the hot sauce in the oven in about the same period of time and it is more firm when it is done and not as "soupy". My family loves this recipe and you can use whatever kind of sauce, meats, etc. that your family likes. One important factor is having enough sauce to cover all the noodles so they soften as they cook. If the edges are left without any sauce they get hard. I find this recipe faster, easier and I like the results A LOT.

Bottom line -- the ricotta topping just doesn't add that much to your basic spaghetti and sauce. It absolutely needs zipping up (which I did) but even so, it just sits on top of a perfectly good meal and mopes.

Excellent, and stores well for future meals. Would be nice I think to add a little more to it, such as ground beef etc...but then I guess you lose the delightful simplicity.

Better than I thought. Had a basketball party and some how over estimated the amount of ricotta cheese needed. So I was looking for recipes to use up the cheese. Quick and tasty. I will amke again.

Excellent got-no-time dish. I made my own tomato sauce with shredded eggplant and zuchini, which gave the dish nice texture and depth. Would definitely make it again.

I rated it on it's content because I have not yet tried the recipe. My husband is not a fan of ricotta cheese, he will eat it but loves "real" cheese if you know what I mean. Great idea for those who love ricotta cheese. Its just the kind of recipe I like quick and easy. :o) A dish I make when I don't feel like taking the time to make a LASAGNE dish the traditional way is to use small to medium shell pasta, Prego sauce(very flavorful and I don't have to add extra spices to it) Mozorrella cheese, large can of sliced mushrooms, 1 roll of bob evans mild sausage. While noodle are cooking I brown my sausage breaking it up into small pieces and when fully cooked drain the grease. I add the mushrooms and simmer for about 5 min. When pasta is cooked, drain water then pour back into pot. Pour pasta sauce over shells and stir to mix pasta and the sauce. In a 13x9 baking dish spoon a thin layer of sauce so the shells won't burn or stick to the bottom of the dish. Then spoon a layer of shells then put a layer of Sausage /mushroom mixture, then a layer of cheese. I keep layering until ingrediants are gone ending with it topped with cheese. Cover with foil. Bake in a 375 degree oven for 20 min. to melt the cheese. Remove from oven and let stand for 5 min. then serve. The real quick way is to combine all ingrediants after they are cooked, stir well to mix and put in a 13x9 baking dish, top with cheese and bake. Tastes the same....less work.

Gave it an extra fork since it was certainly easy to make. However, it was lacking "uumph" and as a not-so-creative cook, I couldn't tell you what other spices it needed. Made this for guests and they were kind, but none of us really liked it much.

Very good--even my very-carniverous husband enjoyed it. We like our food spicy, and I added basil, oregano and garlic. Also, I used all of a 26.5 oz jar of sauce to 1 lb of spagettini, and we thought it could be saucier. Easy to make, and will be a work-night staple!
