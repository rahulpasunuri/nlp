As always, I never have exactly what is needed for recipes, so I used red delicious, roasted almonds, figs, and honey. The varying textures and cool sweetness is perfect for a summer afternoon.

This was tasty, but not exceptional. While all the ingredients in the recipe are good, I thought the combination made for a weird feel in the mouth- sounds odd- maybe I needed to let it sit longer to make it more unified.

Love this stuff! It gets even tastier as it sits. I microwave the lemon juice and apple jelly together in the bowl for about 15 seconds, which makes them easier to blend.

Wow, I wasn't expecting this dish to be so tasty. My husband and I eat this as a snack, but it would be the perfect item for a barbeque or picnic.
