great, easy recipe! I added about 1/8-1/4 cup chambord to the raspberry jam at the end (to thin it out) and that gave it a wonderful extra 'something'

I am a good cook but no baker so I love a dessert recipe that is delicious and easy. Now making this for the second time with raspberries and blueberries. everyone loved it. Did not have graham wafers, so I used my old standby crumb crust. mix together 1 1/2 c flour, 1 tsp salt, 2T. sugar.Then mix together 1/2 c veg. oil 2 T. milk, stir into flour mixture and press into tart pan. bake 350 for 30 min. excellent. Some people like to have chocolate in all their desserts. Just put a layer of melted chocolate on the bottom of the crust before the other fillings. works like a charm. I heated and strained the raspberry jam which made it easier to pour over the berries. Yummy

well, I have'nt made this recipe yet; neither have I made any cheesecakes before. However, I must say to all the folks who thought it was a watered-down cheesecake recipe, I believe it is true...yet, it is a good one for folks who like to watch the amount of fat they take in. One Q I do have is: has anyone tried it with white chocolate? I am wondering if it will hold better and give a richer taste...(yes, it may sacrifice the fresh taste...)Guess, I can try it and let you know.

This was delicious and incredibly easy to make. It's a great choice for entertaining, as you can assemble most of it (i.e., crust and filling) the day before. I substituted chocolate graham crackers for honey grahams and don't know that I'd make it any other way...and I will most certainly make this again.

I didn't burn my second crust attempt! The overall taste was delicious, but I agree with other reviewers that crust bakes up too firm to go with the soft filling. I think it has to do with the brown sugar turning to caramel and then cooling, since my crust (while delicious) had a very crunchy-chewy texture that reminded me of candy. Next time I make this (and there will be a next time), I think I will do a crust with no extra sugar (crackers are sweet enough as it is!).

Rating: 3
my crust just came out of the oven, and I think I over baked it a tiny bit (my timer is broken, oops), but the filling tastes amazing, so hopefully the crust doesn't matter too much. Can't wait for tonight when I get to eat it fully assembled!

Made the recipe exactly as stated with one exception. I did not have raspberry jam so I made my own sauce with a couple handfuls of berries, a spoon of water, two spoonfuls of sugar and a squeeze of lemon. I cooked it for a bit to dissolve the sugar and then strained to remove the seeds. This was drizzled over the tart and turned out lovely.

Rating: 3
Light and tasteful! Not an unbelievable favorite, but still a keeper recipe. I used fresh picked blackberries and mixed with a small amount seedless blackberry jam. It was seasonal, fresh and delicious. Plus it looked pretty. Definetly use a 9inch tart pan. Anything bigger would result in too thin a filling layer. I also used 8 oz. of cream cheese and 1 cup of the thickest sour cream I could find. A very nice late August outdoor evening dessert -Or any time fresh berries are around!

I served this to family and friends tonight...EVERYONE loved it! I made a couple of changes...I also used 8 oz cream cheese, the taste and texture were perfect. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the crust mixture. Also for the topping I used 1 pt. of fresh raspberries,about 1/3 cup of sugar, a couple tsp of fresh lemon juice and 2 Tbl of Grand Marnier.I let this sit at room temp for about 30 minutes and served a spoonful on top of the individual slices (with a mint sprig for presentation) It was incredible...so fresh and light...perfect for a summer dessert. We loved the raspberries but I see potential for other berries and am anxious to explore!

Rating: 3
Agree with other reviewers that this recipe is simple and quick, and produces beautiful and delicious results. My only comment would be that the crust comes out very hard and brittle, which makes it hard to chew, and difficult to cut the tart into slices. Would perhaps substitute a different crust -- a traditional tart shell might be more tender, or maybe a different type of crumb crust.

This is always a crowd pleaser. So easy and delicious. Don't waste your time with the jam. I've made it with raspberries and blueberries together - looks and tastes great. I usually use reduced fat cinnamon graham crackers and add a little brown sugar. Also use reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream. Still creamy and delicious.

Delicious. Had only dark brown sugar, but it came out well. Also used 8 ounces cream cheese, turned out fine.

OUTstanding! Took dessert to friends' home and everyone there enjoyed its appearance (I stood all the raspberries point-up) and taste. Made it as written, but microwaved the jam, then brushed less than listed on top. My hubby thought it could use more fill (will use full 8-oz cream cheese next time) but I did use reduced-fat sour cream with no problem. I did prep only to cream cheese filling, then chilled overnight and into the afternoon. Was well-set when the berries went on. Definitely will try with chocolate variations in the future!

This was really easy to make and extremely delicious. I made a few adjustments, using 8 oz. of neufchatel cheese in place of the cream cheese, and opting for non-fat sour cream. I did use the jam because I had some on hand, but used a combination of fresh raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, and sliced strawberries. It was perfect.

I made this for a dinner party, and it was a big hit. Like others, I used 8 oz. cream cheese instead of 6, and low-fat sour cream. I used frozen whole raspberries instead of fresh (I put them on the tart frozen about an hour before serving and returned tart to fridge). I also skipped the raspberry jam, and it wasn't missed. Lastly, I made it in a 13 3/4 by 4 1/4 inch rectangular tart pan. Will definitely make it again!

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe! I followed some of the other suggestions by adding 8 oz. of cream cheese, extra lemon juice and vanilla. I also bought some good quality grahman crakers, which made the crust especially delicious. Everyone loved it, plus it is VERY easy to make.

Great easy recipe with the following modifications. I used a ready made crust to save time. Instead of lemon juice I used Grand Mariner for a richer flavor. I added 1/2 cup or so of chocolate chips and melted them on the bottom of the crust in the oven, cooled the shell then added the sour cream mixture and chilled the pie. I added the berries and topped with fresh whipped cream. Yummy!

So many reviews for such a simple dessert! It was good and simple but nothing spectacular like so many others on this site. I used a chocolate cookie crust recipe (not from this site - 4.5 oz choc. wafer cookies, 1.5 oz choc. chips or semisweet choc melted, 1 1/2 T sugar & 3 1/2 T unsalted butter). For a round 9" pan I used 8 oz. of cream cheesd and then doubled the amount of filling for a larger rectangular tart. Like many others skipped the jam for a fresher taste.

Oh, and P.S. - I did not use the raspberry jam (as many other cooks said they didn't) and I definitely do not think it detracted from the recipe. If you have good fruit - that's all you need.

Definitely a great summer tart! Very tasty - but also very light. I took some other cooks' recommendations and I used the 8oz pacakge of cream cheese. Further, it was 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it didn't seem to lessen the great taste. Also, I used a whole lemon's juice, and I loved the extra lemon flavor. I didn't have any trouble with the crumbling crust or anything. Overall, a quick & great recipe - that the guests will think you took hours to prepare.

I made this recipe pretty much by the recipe except that I added the juice of a whole lemon, I thought it needed a lot more lemon flavor. I used blueberries and tossed them with a bit of lemon juice and sugar before adding to the tart. The overall effect was very tasty. I found that it didn't hold together well once cut, but was beautiful before. I'm sure all my lemon juice did not help that situation. However, I served it to friends who didn't mind that it was a bit sloppy since it was so tasty. I'm wondering if longer chilling would help. I loved that it was super easy to make and turned out so well.

Good flavor. I doubled the amount of lemon juice (I used the juice of 1 whole lemon) that the recipe called for. The 2 t. was just not enough lemon flavor for me. The crust was a bit too crumbly and did not stick together well, but overall, I thought the flavor was very good and it was very easy to prepare.

I made this for a dinner party last week and everyone loved it! I omitted the raspberry jam because I was afraid it would make it too sweet. I did not think it was missed. The sweetness of the crust with the slightly tart lemon flavor of the filling was a perfect combination. I will definitely make this again and again.

Amazingly fast recipe - like many others, I used 8 oz cream cheese and also increased the lemon juice by a teaspoonful (we like our tarts tart!). Tucked in a few fresh mint leaves here and there too. My guests devoured it - not a crumb left! This dessert had the flavor and appeal of cheesecake, but is much lighter and fresher tasting.

I thought the filling was a bit skimpy & made 1/2 again as much to add to it. Also next time I will make my own raspberry sauce to drizzle; I thought the jam was, well, too jammy tasting. The recipe is a keeper and was delicious w/ strawberries.

This is my third time making it and the third time that people have oohed and aahed. It really is sublime for such a simple recipe. I used sliced strawberries this time because that was the best looking berry at the market. I also used graham cracker crumbs in a box (1 3/4 cup) Also, definitely chill this dessert right up until it is served because it does tend to get mushy (although it still is eaten up quickly) This will be a regular in my house. Next time I may try different fruits like kiwi and peaches. Yumm

I have made this tart several times and it always gets raves and requests for the recipe. It presents well especially when you can get large berries and has a nice light texture. I will try it with other seasonal berries and hope for the same results. This is one is a family favorite. P.S. Do allow the tart to chill sufficiently otherwise the tart will be too soft.

This is a wonderful, fresh, easy and very pretty dessert! Vary the berries,use what's in season or use blueberries, raspberries and strawberries,and make a design..

Not crazy about this one, though some of my family members enjoyed it. The whole time I was eating it I couldn't stop thinking that it was an inferior attempt at cheesecake. I also thought it was the filling that overwhelmed the raspberry flavor, not the other way around, as some reviewers commented. Won't redo.

this is one of the best desserts I have ever made...I'vc been in a hurry several times and it still comes out wonderful. I added blueberries to make a red, white, and blue fourth of July effect and it was great. I'm thinking about adding another fruit say kiwi during my next go around...

This was a wonderful dessert for a summer evening dinner party! All were impressed at the lovely presentation; this tart looks like it requires much effort to put together but, in reality, comes together so easily. I used regular cream cheese (not lowfat or nonfat) and lowfat sour cream; I substituted lime for the lemon with no problems. The key here is to have the freshest berries you can find not only for great taste but also for presentation. I found the drizzling of jam over the fresh fruit to be tiresome and didn't feel it added much value -- will skip this step next time. Everyone raved about this one; I will definitely make this again and again!

i have made this tart countless times now since it was published and each time i get RAVE reviews. never fails to impress. i definitely use the entire block of cream cheese and just throw in a little extra sour cream. i also arrange the raspberries in concentric circles and finish off with some blueberries in the middle for color. makes a big difference in appearance.

Rating: 2
Funny how different people rate this. I agree with an earlier reader, the raspberries overwhelmed the filling. I used chocolate wafer cookie crumbs instead of the graham crackers, which was good, and increased the cream cheese to 8 oz.. There didn't seem to be any reason to use less than the full standard brick. I would not make this again with rasberries, though I might try the filling again with something much lighter, possibly peaches or mango. Overall, a disappointment.

This dessert really impressed and tasted great with very little effort. I used an 8 oz package of Philadelphia Cream Cheese (not the soft or light kind), but I did use light sour cream and it turned out great!

Take care when removing tart pan from oven, so that the removable bottom doesn't pop out before you're ready.

This is very easy and very good!! It's a little runny, but it tastes so good, it doesn't matter. The only thing is: the recipe calls for "8 whole graham crackers". Well, is it the graham cracker that comes in squares or rectangles?? The rectangles are "4" quarters, and the squares are half that size .. I bought the kind that comes in squares and I only had enough to fill the bottom of a 9" tart pan. I couldn't make it up the side.. Next time, I'll try 8 rectangles (or 16 squares) .. It would have been easier if it would have specified "1/2 a cup of graham cracker crumbs" ..

Review #2: I made this for the second successful time and I will share my learnings: 1. you can use any fruit - this time I used a combination of blueberries, raspberries and strawberries 2. don't use low fat sour cream or cream cheese -it's too runny 3. Whisk jam (any kind) first, then add the fruit to it, mix together and let everything sit together for awhile, rather than drizzling the jam over the fruit. It's more even and consistent this way. 4. A Springform pan works well.

To the cook from Atlanta - I understand your trauma. When I made this, it was my first time with the removeable-bottom tart pan. I ruined the appearance of my tart with my clumsiness. I kept hitting the bottom and jarring the tart. It is good, though. Maybe I'll try the springform next time. Good luck!

everything was off to a fabulous start... it was easy to make, looked gorgeous (although my jam drizzle didn't drizzle well, a few seconds in the microwave might have helped), we were off to an outdoor concert, when SPLAT tragedy struck... my springform pan released and dumped the whole thing on the ground (upside down of course). to say I was traumatized is putting it mildly.
