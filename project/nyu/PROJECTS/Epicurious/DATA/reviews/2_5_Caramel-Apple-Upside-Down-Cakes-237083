I didn't have any problems with the caramel, and didn't use a heavy-bottom pan like one reviewer suggested. I like this cake, as does my family.

I strongly disagree with the previous reviewers who think this is a bad recipe. It is really a wonderful recipe and the difficulty they had with the caramel was, I suspect, that they cooked too long, too hot. Baking in individual ramekins makes for a good presentation but too big for most people to eat all. I will definitely make again and I will also try making it in a bundt pan.

I made this twice and both times the caramel was terrible. It was so hard I could not eat it. The cake had little flavor. I added more apples but still the entire dish had very little flavor. The worst part was the caramel. It was a disaster.

I really hate to be to sound whiney, but Uh(!) this was terrible! The caramel tasted like anything but caramel- in fact, it was horribly bitter!- and the cake was just mediocre. The whole process required a large effort and enormous clean-up! Not worth it;in fact, it was a complete waste of time and products!

First off, make sure you use a heavy bottomed pan for the carmel -- it won't work otherwise. As to the dessert,there was nothing that tasted like caramel apple. I made it without testing it first for dinner and after a few bites, no one finished it. It was sweet and the cake part was underwhelming. I kept looking back at the recipe to see if I missed something. It looked beautiful, but it just didn't taste good. Way below average.

I was so glad to see the comments posted. Tried this cake last night. Unlike others, I thought the taste and texture of the cake was fine. The caramel, however, was a nightmare. Stuck miserably to the baking dish. Clean up was a challenge. Won't try again until I learn a better way to work with the caramel

If you had a "no fork" option that would have been my choice. While the caramel and apples were good , the cake was flavorless and dry. I had no problems with the caramel as I've made in many times before. But this recipe wasn't worth the clean-up caramel requires. I think this is the first time I've ever had to throw away a dessert.

Very disappointing. I love to bake and this was not at all worth baking to me. The cake was dry and bland, and the texture kind of weird. Lots of ice cream and caramel sauce from the refrigerator still made a decent dessert, but I would not make this again.

Really disappointing. Cake was doughey and caramel burned with these directions. Not good.

This cake was a big disappointment. The picture looked so good on the cover of Bon Appetite that I had to try it. The caramel was too hard to get just right, as others have commented. The cake was dry and lacked flavor. My family asked if I could just make my regular upside-down cake recipe from the old Betty Crocker cookbook next time! I will stick with the brown sugar and butter method from now on.

We tried this recipe last night and I have to admit, this was the first time I have ever been disappointed with a recipe from Bon Appetit. The cake was bland and finely grained and almost all of the caramel remained in the dishes. Another vote for the vanilla ice cream being the best part of the recipe.

I had different results from most of the other reviewers. I sliced the apples a little thinner, since slices of 1/8 of the apple seemed too thick from the start. As for the caramel, it's not supposed to be a sauce. Without fat, caramel is quite sticky, and hardens quickly. If you put a little bit more than the recommended amount in each ramekin, you will end up with a lovely caramel coating that covers the sides of each cake. Also, since the caramel was so sticky, we figured that we'd have to plate the cakes as soon as they were out of the oven. This strategy works well, as long as you don't wait too long for it to cool at any point (including before consumption). If I make it again, I will probably add some cinnamon or other apple pie-like spice to the apples when sauteeing. The caramel flavor was great, but a little overwhelming... this is quite a rich dessert. I agree that the cake wasn't quite the best texture, but overall, it was a fun treat to make and enjoy.

This was a complete disaster -- I echo the comments about not being able to get it out of the dishes and also that the cake was not at all pleasing -- it was dry and much finer grained than what appeared on the cover of the magazine. After these disappointing results I reviewed the recipe and I'm sure I followed both the ingredients and the method correctly. I would not recommend this!

I thought this was great! I made it at 5 pm on a Saturday night when I was expecting guests at 6 pm. I made it in a square glass dish rather than separate ramekin dishes. I'll definitely make it again and have shared the recipe with my guests, too.

I used bottled caramel sauce. I baked it in a square pan, not individual ramekins. The cake came out with a cheesecake-like texture.

this was not good. the caramel took closer to 30 minutes to get to amber, and that was on the second try, since on my first try the teflon from my pan got too hot & came off in the caramel. I think they should have said to butter the ramekins also, because mine wouldn't come out... the apple pieces are too big, andd the cake is not that good either. just a poorly written recipe and a waste of time & money. I'm surprised, because I use Bon Appetit recipes all the time and I'm always pleased with the results!

Another carmel disaster here! Tried it twice, two different pans, two different temps, rock candy both times. Just not enough water! Resorted to the old butter and brown sugar method. And smothered them in ice cream. Not a favorite.

for those having trouble with the caramel, be sure to let the sugar dissolve completely, heating over a low flame. when fully dissolved you can turn the heat up without any problems. resist the urge to stir; swirling the pan is all that's needed here.

Thank goodness I read the reviews! I was making this right before company came over, so I used the brown sugar/butter method. It was delicious, but I think I will add some cinnamon and nutmeg next time. The cake has a very fine texture. I briefly boiled the butter and brown sugar together before dividing into the cups. The cakes released beautifully and were delicious served with vanilla bean ice cream.

They were delicious. Caramel making is challenging like the others say. I've never fail to make caramel before, and now I know what is like. It became crystalized, but I went ahead and used it. There was sugar caked at the bottom after flipping over the cake when they were done. They still tasted very good, and my husband and son loved them. (I made into 8 serving.)

Amazing when done right but this is definitely not for people who haven't done some sugar work before. Couple of things to help with the caramel are to use the smallest heaviest saucepan you have and then make sure to use a pastry brush. If you use anything other than these, it can very quickly go from a sugar glaze to a crystalized mess. Also, stop when it is a golden brown because the caramel can go from light amber to burnt and bitter in a few seconds. We do candy on a regular basis and it took us three tries to get it right but when it finally comes out right, it is amazing. Tastes like creme brulee topping. The apples were a bit too big for our tastes, next time we'll cut into 12. We fixed this for a dinner party and attendees raved and raved about it.

I had this cake at Fino on January 19th (Paula Deen's 60th birthday) and it was fabulous! We have enjoyed the desserts for many years at both Asti and Fino. ;)

My husband selected this recipe for his birthday party.The recipe was a disaster! I made it as a single cake, as the individual cups would be too much for one person. I used an 8 cup flan mold. When I unmolded it, all of the caramel stayed in the dish and was a gluey mess. The cake was dry, and the only redeeming feature about this dish was the vanilla ice cream.

This is hard for me to rate. The end result was delicious, but the road to get there was tortuous and slow. The caramel was a disaster. Maybe it's because I live at 7,000 feet, but the syrup was boiling one minute, and the next it had crystalized into a rock-hard mess. I tried unsuccessfully to salvage it. Started over with a Joy of Cooking caramel sauce, which worked fine (more water). The cakes were delicious, but too much for one person - next time I'll try (as some of the reviewers below)to make it as one whole dessert. But really tasty, and my sweetie and I loved the texture of the cakes. One more note - I used regular, not cake flour (and substituted two tablespoons of corn starch for two tablespoons of the flour, per Mark Bittman), and 1% milk.

Thank you for the helpful responses to the caramel challenged cook--me! I agree with "eathappy" that it was somewhat bitter and the reader from Lake Tahoe was quite right in suggesting a brown sugar/butter topping; I will try that next time! It would seem just as tasty with alot less struggle.

To the caramel-challenged cook -- I completely agree, and quite frankly, I don't think the caramel is necessary. I used the small cups and instead of the caramel just put a paste of brown sugar and melted butter on the bottom, the way my mother used to make upside down cakes. Then I put in the sauteed apples (A little brandy and some cinnamon in the sauteeing didn't hurt) and poured on the cake batter. I think this would work fine as one large cake as well. You need to keep an eye on them while they're cooking -- I live at high altitude and they still finished pretty quickly. I think the suggestion of 400 is a little high, but 350, the usual temp for a cake, worked well.

Try baking at 400*

I tried this recipe as one cake rather than the individual cakes. The caramel procedure was a complete disaster: the sugar would not carmelize for the longest time--took much longer than the 8 minutes stated in the recipe--and when it DID turn amber it was a hard solid mess. I was wondering if a candy thermometer would have helped or if my sugar was somehow not right. Any ideas? I even tried a second batch of the caramel and it was a failure; came out like grainy sludge.

I saw this recipe in the current issue and it sounds great. One thing I am wondering about, I'd like to make it as a single cake instead of individual ones...any suggestions on how to adapt the recipe?
