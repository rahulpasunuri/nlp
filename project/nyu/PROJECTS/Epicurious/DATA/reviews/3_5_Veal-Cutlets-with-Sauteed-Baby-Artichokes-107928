Outstanding! Simple to prepare, looks and tastes beautiful. Next time I make it I'll be sure to invite friends over. It's too good not to share.

I have never cooked artichokes in my life. I made the artichoke part of this recipe without the veal. I saw some artichokes at the store and decided to see what I could do with them. I was cooking for some friends and having pasta. So I wanted to find something that would complement pasta. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Well, it was such a success that I had to print out the recipe for them to take home! The husband couldn't stop eating it. It has a little kick but not too much for us. I can't imagine what the person who reviewed this as "bland and boring" did to the recipe. It was so not bland and boring. Really delicious and easy too. The directions for prepping the artichokes are quite good. I never realized there would be so much of the artichokes thrown away during the prep.

This an excellant and easy dish. I used pounded out veal rib chops.I also increased the red pepper to my taste and added some chicken stock to make a sauce finished with a little butter.A tri color salad my special dressing. PERFECT

Make this recipe!! It is delicious and very light. Made this last night for my boyfriend, a chef who is not afraid to critisize, and we both loved it. I probably used more garlic than listed, and I actually boiled the artichokes w/ some cloves of garlic, peppercorns, and a bayleaf for flavor. And I cooked the veal first, added it to the pan with the mixture, and tossed for a minute while I added some vegetable stock to keep it moist.

I used chicken cutlet instead of veal, and added mushrooms. A simple meal, satisifying and very attractive on the plate.

I used frozen artichokes, and added sliced mushrooms to the sautee step. Delicious and pretty quick.

Loved it, it's a very quick and simple week night dish with pasta.The flavours blend well, but as usual the key is using fresh ingredients.

Completely bland and boring.

Excellent flavor and not difficult to make. I added a little dry white wine in with the veal to decarmelize the pan. I will definitely make this again. The artichokes would be great as a side for chicken or pork as well.

This recipe was really delicious. I had a bag of frozen artichoke hearts from Trader Joes so I used them instead of fresh and prepared them with lemon juice and we were very happy with the results. A very nice dish.

I don't eat veal so I substituted pork tenderloin pounded thin. Next time I make this I will allow the meat to cook a little in the sauce so it will absorb or coat with more flavor. The artichokes and sauce are delicious and could be served on their own.
