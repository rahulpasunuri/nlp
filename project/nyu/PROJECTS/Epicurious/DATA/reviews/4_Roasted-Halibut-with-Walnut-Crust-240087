Didn't have halibut but made this recipe with cod fillets and it worked really well. I ground the toasted walnuts in a spice grinder, added lemon zest to the crust and used olive oil instead of butter to brush on the fish before crusting. I used the broiler for about 30 seconds after roasting and the crispy result was excellent. It's just Halibut season now so I might try it as intended .

Put the ingredients for the topping in the food processor but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as it said. Next time, I will mix some lemon into the topping and bake for about 4-5 min then flip and add topping to the other side and bake. Broiling for a minute really made the crust delicious. It was a great dish and very easy.

This was SO good, and very easy. A friend had just brought me fresh caught halibut and this was something new for me. The only thing different I did was add about one teaspoon of a country dijon to the melted butter, very nice! I served with a lemon rice pilaf.

I used this recipe as inspiration but changed a few things. I didn't toast the walnuts and used regular instead of panko breadcrumbs (it's all I had.) Since I was only making two, 6 oz. fillets of halibut, I made the topping out of 1/4 cup of walnuts, 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, a handful of chopped parsley, no basil or chives. I skipped the butter. Baked at 450 for 8 minutes as advised, then tented the fish with foil for another 4 minutes. Came out perfect. Served with roasted asparagus drizzled with balsamic vinegar and shredded Parmesan, and roasted potatoes. Really good.

This recipe was perfect! Everything I want from a simple delicious meal! I did make a change as I was out of walnuts, and instead added crushed almonds. Really tasty! Thanks!

Wonderful flavor - quick and easy - good for weekday family meal and impressive for company. Have made this several times, once using dukkah seasoning in place of walnuts which was very good. This is definitely a keeper.

it is ridiculous how easy and delicious this is - colorful, fragrant and light. i only made a slight change in that i diced a bit of shallot into the butter as i melted it, only because i'm crazy about shallots and happen to have them on hand. make sure to have lemon wedges at the table for liberal squeezing, because the acidity really pushes this over the edge...

Made this last night for some regular dinner guests and we all were wowed by the bright flavour. The delicate halibut was accentuated and not overpowered. What a wonderful way to make the fish the star!! Excellent recipe that is on our "keeper" list.

I followed this recipe almost exact and it was absolutely perfect!! The flavor was great and I did broil it for a minute at the end to crip up the breading. I served this with pasta with cream sauce and green beans which complimented the fish. It was a great meal, the kids also loved it. Would make again for sure!

I did not have halibut or walnuts, but used cod fillets and hazelnuts instead. Other than that, I made the recipe as recommended and it was very good. I put melted lemon butter at the table and family members drizzled it over the fish. All family members liked it and said they'd eat it again. Next time, I will try it with halibut. It was a very handy recipe since I had all the herbs on hand and panko is a staple in my pantry.

5/2010. My market's halibut looked terrible so I made this with skinless chicken breasts and it was delicious.

Rating: 4
Lovely recipe. Very easy to make and turned out beautifully. Timing varies of course depending on thickness of fish, 2 generous sized pieces of halibut, over an 1" thick so adjusted accordingly - 12 minutes were perfect, 10 minutes per inch of fish is the best guide. Will definitely make again. Served it with a celeriac, butternut squash, potato mash - great compliment of flavors.

Good recipe. I was expecting a bit more flavour. I made the lemon butter (actually lime butter with an obvious modification) recipe last minute to add a punch. I would make it again with the lemon butter sauce.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I had more herbs and used regular bread crumbs rather than Panko. I threw the herbs, toasted walnuts and bread crumbs into the food processer. I used EVOO spray instead of butter. It was a simple, easy, and delicious main dish. My husband and 3 teens devoured it.

Oh my goodness, I've used this website for years but had to create an account to review this exceptional recipe! I used un-toasted walnuts, dried herbs, and mahi mahi in place of halibut and it still turned out AMAZING. Can only imagine making it according to the recipe would produce something even more delicious. I had to cook it for longer than the 8 minutes suggested in the recipe. Liked it for the unusual but very savory taste. And for the ease! Will likely become a household regular. It went great with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed green beans.

Rating: 4
This was really good. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using regular breadcrumbs instead of panko. Also, I had a really thick slab of halibut (about 2" thick) and it had to sit in the oven for a lot longer than 8 minutes. It was very quick and easy to make--a great weeknight fish dinner idea. I'll definitely be making it again soon.

Rating: 3
I liked this recipe a lot, but it has to be absolutely mind-blowing for me to give a recipe 4 forks. I used mustard instead of butter for health reasons, but I think that the mustard somewhat overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the halibut, so next time I'll probably just go with a little bit of butter. That's why I think it's a good idea to make the recipe the way it's written the first time, and make modifications the next time. I might also cut back on the breadcrumbs next time, as I thought that they overwhelmed the walnuts. Overall, this is a nice weeknight dinner.

Rating: 4
Excellent and easy! Due to dietary restrictions, I omitted the salt and butter entirely. I drizzled the halibut with a little olive oil and also added just a touch of olive oil to the walnut crust. The results were outstanding. The whole family loves this healthy version of the recipe!

Halibut and sea bass are my favorites. This is an exceptional recipe for halibut. Not only would I make it again, I have. And it's always received extremely well each time I do it. The herb and walnut topping smells SOOO good.

I was seriously disappointed with this recipe, especially after reading all of the glorious reviews. Halibut is my favorite fish, but this recipe did it no justice. It would have been just as good w/o the walnut crust, with less work.

This was okay, but not great. I don't know what all the fuss is about on this one. I followed the recipe exactly with one exception; I used tilapia instead of halibut which was very fresh but this recipe is definitely not deserving of 4 forks. I'm basing my opinion on the topping/coating which was just okay. I don't think it would have tasted any better had I used halibut.

Rating: 4
Terrific recipe especially for walnut lovers. I didn't have enough chives, so used chopped green onions. Didn't have fresh basil, so substituted dried basil. I'm sure it would have been even better with all fresh herbs. Cooked it exactly as the recipe recommended. Will try the topping with other fishes.

Absolutely amazing! I used pistachios instead of walnuts and did not have chives. So delicious and very easy. Would serve to anyone.

This was very good! Easy, flavorful and worthy of halibut, one of my favorite fishes. I had filberts so used them, and like others suggested I used Dijon mustard and butter on the fish (whisked them together). Baking time was perfect and I did broil for one minute to get the top crust a bit toasty. Good way to use up nuts leftover from another recipe.

We made this last night, and it was great! I didn't have parsley...so I subbed minced scallion tops instead. Also, we were out of butter, so I used olive oil mixed with honey. Delish! Served it with lentils (sauteed portabellas and shallots) and roasted corn.

Having just returned from Alaska's Kenai with 45 pounds of Halibut fillets I caught (my arms are still sore) I couldn't wait to prepare some. This was the first recipe I chose to use. I made it exactly as the recipe indicated, no deviations. I'm giving it 4 forks mainly due to how easy it was to do. Lots of bang for buck here and makes a very elegant presentation. I paired it with a toasted parmesan orzo, a crisp Sauvignon Blanc, and some sourdough rolls. Add in a first course of clam chowder or lobster bisque and you have a dinner fit for Christmas Eve. I suspect I will make this again and again. Seems very versatile to be modified or used with other kinds of fish as others pointed out.

This was wonderful - great flavour, texture and SO easy! Having read previous reviews, I decided to cut fat by using mustard on my fish and on my spouse's, but I used butter on my childrens' fish - great to have a recipe so easily adapted to different tastes and needs within the same group. The only other thing I did a little differently was to coat both sides of the fish, instead of just putting the mixture on top. Granted, it was a bit messy and some (though not much) was lost in the transfer from baking sheet to plate, but the crust was too good to waste on one side only. Of course, the bottom "crust" isn't quite as crispy as the top, but the walnuts ensure that some crunch is still present. I would make this for guests any time.

This recipe is great and really fun to play with! I like to make it with salmon and bake it for about 5 minutes (depending on filet thickness) and then broil for about 2 minutes. This works best if the filets have uniform thickness, so the broiling is even. It guarantees results that are delicious! Also...if you're going to broil it, you don't need to toast the nuts.

Rating: 4
I made this for my family when I was home. It even converted my non-fish-eating brother and his friend to each eat (and enjoy) a full filet. I used crushed macadamia nuts instead of walnuts, and the result was perfect. Also, don't skimp on the lemon! Great recipe!

Fantastic! I made this and was shocked at how something so simple could be so delicious! I would have liked the crust a little crunchier, maybe pop it under the broiler for the last few minutes?

It was just ok. I had to use Grouper so maybe that was the difference. I used butter as written but it would have added more flavor using dijon mustard.

This is a wonderful fish recipe. I used a 2" thick piece of fish that took 20 minutes to cook. I used the mustard smear instead of butter as a previewer suggested. This was a great enhancement. I did not stay away from the butter entirely though. I drizzled a bit of melted butter on top of the panko mixture. I also added some parmesan cheese to the panko mixture. If you liked this recipe, there is a great salmon recipe with Asian flavoring that uses a similar panko crust in "Barefoot Contessa at Home" called "Eli's Asian Salmon." I highly recommend both recipes!

This was the most delicious dish. I used haddock instead of halibut and had to cook it a little longer but it was still juicy and tasty. The buttery panko/walnut/herb topping was amazing and we ate it by the forkful. Next time I would try it with olive oil and pecans as one other cook recommended.

Wow, this is a great way to jazz up fish! I was inspired by the recipe and used what I had on hand: tilapia fillets, regular breadcrumbs and a mix of roasted cashews and pecans. As one reviewed said, the topping is so good and fragrant on its own (and with other stuff if you have left- overs... over polenta pieces or pasta). Mustard works well instead of butter. The winning factor for me is how tender and juicy the fish is!! Delicious. It looks very good and is suitable for a nice meal with guests. And to reply to the NY cook wondering why people make reviews without sticking to the recipe: unless you're doing pastry, a recipe can be modified and adapted, let's be creative! Some people follow it exactly, which is fine, others don't... and their ideas can inspire us as well. I think reviewing a recipe without trying it at all is the only thing that we should avoid.

This was easy and delish! OK...I did substitute toasted almond meal which I had on hand and used salmon plus didn't have chives so I added a touch of "lemon- garlic garni" seasoning. This topping would work well on any fish I would think.

Rating: 4
Very good! I found that we could coat both sides with the panko-herb mixture, and it worked just fine. We also marinated the fish in a couple tablespoons of vermouth to remove the fishy smell before coating it with salt, butter and the panko mixture. Broiling the last minute or two was an excellent suggestion to crispen up the walnuts. And, contrary to the views of the cook from New York, I have found that the suggestions of reviewers have made great Epicurious recipies even better!

This is a quick and delicious recipe. Halibut can be bland, but this mixture brings it to life. I followed the prior advise and coated w/dijon mustard instead of butter, baked for 8 min and broiled for 1. I will make this a go-to weeknight entree.

HOW can cooks write their review for this recipe, when they are changing the recipe and writing the review for their OWN version? I never understand this. Make it AS IS, they want the review for THIS recipe, NOT your own version. I made it exactly as recipe stated and it was excellent. If you don't like it when you make it as is, that should be your review, then change it for yourself the next time if you decide to make it. Makes no sense to me.

This was a great fish recipe. I'm always looking for recipes for fish because we eat it about three times a week. This was delicious. My husband, without prompting, said it was good. I did use olive oil instead of butter, and drizzled a little of the oil on top of the breading just before placing in the oven. I used cod this time, but this topping would be good on other types of fish. I'll try the halibut the next time I can get some fresh fish. We like basil, so that didn't put us off. I can see this as a pesto sauce without the panko. If you like basil, parsley and chives, give this a try the next time you have fish.

Delicious and simple. This recipe's a keeper. The walnut herb crust is the perfect contrast to the delicate halibut. The recipe is fairly large though, and the serving size is very generous. I used two eight-ounce fillets, which was enough to serve four people, and I halved all the ingredients for the topping. I also used olive oil instead of butter to adhere the topping; a little more heart-healthy and I was able to use a little less than one tablespoon per fillet to shave a few calories.

Very yummy, especially if you are not a fish lover. I used dried herbs and fresh basil,added a bit of garlic powder and 1/4 c parmesan cheese. I also cut the recipe in thirds.
