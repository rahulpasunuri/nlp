Okay, this recipe contains one of my biggest pet peeves about Epicurious. Marinate in a 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish? For heavens sake, why? Is there something sacred about that size? About glass? You arent even going to cook the lamb in the bloody thing; why on earth does it matter what kind of pan you use?

Fantastic. Served with lentil couscous salad from 9/1995 gourmet.

Drink a Cab or Bordeaux with this dish. Pinot is not the right wine! This dish was lovely. My (teenage) son made this for me for Mother's Day. He followed the recipe as written, and it was wonderful.

This was fantastic! I usually have success with well-reviewed epicurious recipes, but this stood out. I too used boneless leg of lamb on the butcher's recommendation, like some other reviewers did. I doubled the marinade and left the lamb to marinade overnight, which I think makes a huge difference. I happened to grind the cumin seeds fresh (bec I had run out of ground cumin) which also seemed to enhance the flavour really well. I used the broiler (since it's freezing!) and it worked out - I broiled the skewers about 9-10 minutes, turning once and they were perfectly brown outside, pink inside. Served with broiled grape tomatoes, yoghurt with dill, and some pilaf. Great meal.

I was eager to try new seasonings with lamb but found this combination way too cinnamonny. While it was okay, I prefer the greek combo of oregano, pepper and garlic.

Simple and delcious. Just what I was looking for, a lamb dish that was simple and tasty, but not too overwhelming with excessive flavors. Even the children like it.

It is important to get good quality lamb that isn't too tough, but the spice combination is simple and delicious. I too have sometimes substituted allspice for the cinnamon and it is equally good.

This was terrific! Simple but incredible flavors. I would advise marinating all day, though. Served it with grilled squash & red onion skewers, grilled Japanese eggplant, and a long grain and wild rice combo. A good Pinot Noir completed the feast!

This is a great, easy recipe for lamb. The flavor was v. middle-eastern--I love cinammon on meat. You may also use all-spice as a substitue. I added a little bit of corriander to the marinade and like the review before me, skipped the skewers! Enjoy!

This recipe is easy to make and the combination of flavors is excellent. I make this quite often and don't even bother to use the skewers anymore. I tried marinating overnite once and it wasn't as good. The spice flavor over-powered the taste of the lamb. Rice is excellent as a side dish along with a veggies that's not too strong in flavor.

With just two of us a leg of lamb is a bit much. I used this recipie with lamb chops and it was fabulous! The cinnamon and cumin combination is great. Loved this.

This is such an easy, yet tasty recipe. We grilled it over Jack Daniels woodchips and it turned out very nice. This is one of the best lamb dishes I've eaten.

I doubled the spices and felt that was the right amount. Skewered alternately with sweet onions and we liked it a lot.

A very nice change from my usual garlc/rosemary seasonings. I followed the recipe proportions closely and next time I think I will use more spice. (In this case, my spices were grocery store bought and so lacked in pungency compared to fresher/better ones.) It might add a little depth of flavor to add some mild chili powder too.
