These were very good with just a couple of adjustments. The meat mixture made enough for at least eight large rolls, with a little left over. Seven rolls and I wouldn't have been able to close the sides of the rolls. I left out the white sugar as I was sure it would make the dish too sweet. The cooking liquid is very soupy at the end, but I'm not a fan of cornstarch, so I covered the cabbage rolls and kept them warm in the oven while I reduced the liquid for 30 minutes. Excellent!

I used this recipe as a guide and tweaked to my preference. Also I "made" tomato sauce out of various boxed tomato soup flavors offered at the store and that worked perfectly for the flavor profile I was going for. All the core flavors are here for your experimentation - Adjust (or not) and Enjoy!

I fondly remember my Grandmother's stuffed cabbage but never had the smarts to ask her for her recipe. After looking at about a dozen recipes, this one seemed the closest to what I remember. I did make some changes: I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and left out the white sugar entirely. I also left out the cinnamon. I added 1/2 cup raisins to the stuffing and 3/4 cup of raisins to the sauce. And to push the sour flavor up, I added the juice of 4 lemons and used cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. Next time I think I may use ground lamb instead of ground beef.

I found this recipe way to sweet, and I even reduced the amount of sugar in half. We could only eat the rolls which were ok, but nothing special.

This was a great dish, absolutely not what I had expected, as the sweet flavor was much more present in this than any other stuffed cabbage I have had. But it was great, no alterations needed.

This was delicious and not the least bit weird, as other reviewers have said. Based on prior reviews and my own preferences, I did make a few changes: 1 lb ground turkey + 1/2 lb ground pork (NOT KOSHER!)for less fat and more flavor; brown rice for white (cooked for 30 min); no white sugar; zested the citrus, removed the pith and then chopped into small pieces; because it was available, used Savoy cabbage for the rolls and regular for the sauce.

Without the orange peel, it was excellent. Seemed like a lot of work but it made plenty of food. Tastes better the next day.

Maybe this is one of those type foods you had to grow up with to enjoy. Had a large organic cabbage from my FarmBox program and didnt know what to do with it. Tried this recipe and it was blah. The only flavor was the sweet and sour from the vinegar and sugar. Everything else was just bland.

Chopmeat is a New York term for hamburger meat.

I read the reviews about how the rice didn't cook all the way through, so I cooked the rice before mixing it with the rest of the stuffing. The rice cooked quickly while I was prepping the cabbage leaves. I simmered the stuffed cabbage for about an hour and it was delicious and the rice tender. I also don't know what chopmeat is, but I made these with mild pork sausage and they were delish! Will make it again next time I get cabbage from the CSA.

Oh yes, yes, let me rush RIGHT out and find Meyer lemons and fire roasted tomatoes so that i can get this recipe right. Never mind that my grandmother's recipe that she gave me more than 30 years ago is almost identical to this one -- after all, what is cooking if not impressing the world with irrelevant "tweaks"? Delicious just as is -- cinnamon more or less depending on your taste -- our original recipe called for sauerkraut to line the cooking pot.

After reading other reviews, I eliminated the white sugar altogether, and used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. Also used canned crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and cider vinegar instead of white. After rolling the mixture in cabbage leaves, I froze in individual servings with sauce (no extra cabbage in sauce) so that I could reheat for lunches at work. Worked great!

Am I the ONLY human in the entire world that doesn't know what 'chopmeat' is?? I googled it and am brought right back here. Wikipedeia says it can be pork, but that doesn't sound very Kosher! HELP!!!

I decided to bake the recipe at 350 degrees for about 1-hour (until bubbling), and it turned out great. We re-warmed it the second day and it was even better. Next time I'll make it the day before, refrigerate the rolls and the sauce separatel, return to room temperature and then bake. Yum!

This recipe is amazing and I've made it more than 5 times. Freezes well. The only thing I do differently is reduce the sugar by half. It's still sweet even by doing that.

For those of you cooking for a diabetic here is a versatile recipe that is easily adaptable. I used ground turkey & instant brown rice for the stuffing. I substituted splenda for sugar and Meyer lemons made the sauce absolutely scrumptious. I added fire roasted tomatoes to give the sauce more texture. Next time I would add more spicing to the stuffing. Great Recipe!

Just wanted to add that I did have to tweak the recipe a liitle. I used the juice of one lemon and left out the peel/ I didn't add orange juice at all. I used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and pureed it in the blender. I cooked it about forty minutes longer than the recipe called for and I found that the rice was fully cooked. I agree with Feldercreative that the sauce was a little watery so after the cooking was done, I removed the rolls and thickened the sauce a bit with a little cornstarch mixed with cold water. Next time I think I will halve the amount of cinnamon.

I was looking for the perfect stuffed cabbage recipe and am so glad that I found this one. It requires a number of basic ingredients and it is a bit of a fuss, but the results are quite remarkable. The filling and sauce are delicious and the flavor is authentic Old World. I definitely suggest you try this recipe if you like stuffed cabbage.

I did not like this recipe at all, it was too sweet and the cinnamon was too obvious. Next time, will reduce amt. of each sugar by HALF, leave out the cinnamon, and will cook the rice first, it did not cook well in the pot.

I made this recipe for the first course of a dinner party and it was a huge success! The only changes I made were that I cut up the citrus fruits into smaller pieces and I used crushed tomatoes instead of canned sauce. This way you can make your own sauce and season to your liking. I suggest making it the night before to cut the acidity.

The stuffing mix is what I have used, however, I lost the recipe for how my mom made it.... using tomatoe soup, diced canned tomatoes & saurkraut. Has anyone used these ingredients?

All in all this was great, but we had to make some changes!! Luckily we only made half this recipe the 1st night, and the 2nd half the next night becuase the rice was completely uncooked the 1st time we made this!! Instead of simmering in a pot on the stovetop, we baked it the 2nd night in the oven in a covered casserole dish. Worked perfectly, and all the rice was cooked! If you want to simmer it, use cooked rice instead. Other modifications - used ground turkey meat instead of beef, zested fruit rinds instead of keeping whole chunks, cut sugar down to 1/4 (actually used purevia in its place), and cut water down to 1 cup. Not sure you need the white sugar at all, or use even less brown/white sugar. Was just a bit too sweet. We also used Splenda brown. Last thing - we also put the sauce in the blender the 2nd night instead of serving it with whole pieced of fruit in it - liked it a lot better! Lots of work, but this dish really was amazing with the slight tweaks. Great flavors!!!

Recipe was good, I also omitted the white sugar as I am not into sweet and savory combos too much. My mother used to make a spanish version of this, she left out the citrus and cinnamon adding instead poblanos and or green bell pepper and cumin and serving it with spanish rice. It was amazing!

this recipe was wonderful with a few moderations. I completely omitted the white sugar and used the half cup of brown sugar i also omitted the orange and instead of putting whole peices of lemon in, i squeezed the juice of 1 lemon. it was delicious and i would definitely make it again

You MUST keep in the citrus and cinnamon! That's what made this recipe sing!!! I used lime instead of lemon and we kept the peel in and it tasted delicious -- it really set the recipe apart. I too cut down on sugar. The sauce seemed a bit watery -- did anyone else experience this? I ended up with 8 large rolls. Will definitely use this sauce for other things too!

This was pretty good. I really liked the citrus-y taste from the orange and lemon, though 1/2 inch pieces like the recipe called for left too small bits of peel that sometimes you could accidentally bite into. Next time I'll leave them sliced big and remove them before serving. Also I followed other reviewers advice and cut back on the sweetness. I added only about 1 tbsp of brown sugar, and no white sugar. Though I know people who like this sweet, and may prefer it with all the sugars, I'm not one of them. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It wasn't quite like my Bubbie used to make (though, dare I say, maybe a little better?), but even the picky husband liked it.

Love this recipe, I modified it by taking out the white sugar in the sauce and just use the brown sugar.

This is a very good recipe for stuffed cabbage. Rather than use so much sugar, I replaced it with a couple of tablespoons of dark corn syrup. Delicious!

Leave out the orange,lemon, cinnamon both brown and white sugars for the sauce. And I did use apple cider vinegar instead. It was delicious and the over all flavour did retain a sweet savourly taste. I used 2 lbs of meat and made 10 good size cabbage bundles. Also, I had the sauce cooking a little with the chopped cabbage before combining. Use a very large pot or split between 2. I gave it 3.5 forks due to the modifications.

I agree with others who think that the sauce is much much too sweet. I can't imagine that this is the correct amount of sugar and not a typo. The sauce was awful. The stuffed cabbage themselves had a good flavor and I would make them again, but the sauce...never!

I made this with ground lamb, cooked rice (didn't want to take a chance or cook for that long) and omitted the white sugar all together but kept about half of the brown sugar. Then cut water to half a cup. Put in the oven for 1 hour. Oh yes an threw in a couple of diced green chilli's. Very tasty. Cant imagine what it would have tasted like with all that sugar...

This was awful. I cut back the white and brown sugar by half and it was still WAAY too sweet. Unless you like really sweet dinner food, I would recommend finding a different recipe. I have found a number of sweet and sour - type recipes online that only take 1 or 2 tablesspoons of sugar.

This is really good, and I made it for the second time tonight. I cut back the sugar this time, however, as it was a little sweet for our taste. I successfully substituted large chard leaves for the cabbage and mixed wild rice for the white rice, both of which I had on hand. With chard the dish doesn't need to cook nearly as long and you don't need to soften the leaves by boiling first as they are quite tender.

I reduced the sugar as other reviewers suggested and still found it quite sweet. However, the unusual tang of this sauce really made the meal.

I fell in love with stuffed cabbage while living in Ukraine for a couple of years, but was never confident enough to make them myself. As a diehard 2nd Avenue Deli fan (even though it is no longer on 2nd Avenue!), I thought this was the ideal recipe for me to try. Thanks very much for the advice to cut the white sugar in half - the sauce is quite sweet with 1/2 the sugar and I wouldn't want it any sweeter. These are delicious. At first, I thought the lemon and orange was strange, but I went with it and am so glad I did. These are perfect EXCEPT, I found the inside very dry when I cut into them. An easy solution is to have some of the sauce nearby in a gravy boat. A little pour over the cut cabbage roll and everything is perfect. I will definitely make these again and again.

Made this for a client and doubled the recipe so we could enjoy it. Probably close to the best stuffed cabbage I've had. Client and family are happy and will definitely make again, probably next weekend! Cut the white sugar down to half.

I was searching for something close to my grandmom's recipe for stuffed cabbage when I came across this treasure. After reading the ingredients, I determined that this recipe only had meat, rice, and cabbage in common with my grandmom's recipe. I tried it anyway, and I am thrilled that I did! Thanks to john morrison..I cooked my rice first. I kept everything else the same. Don't change a thing otherwise...this is comfort food. It's not supposed to be good for you. Dont cut back on the sugar. Try it this way first, i think you'll agree that it's perfect as is. Sorry Grandmom,but I really enjoyed this.

No need to fuss with parboiling the cabbage. If you freeze your head of cabbage a day or so before prep and let thaw... the leaves will be soft and pliable. Makes this dish waaaaaaay easier.
