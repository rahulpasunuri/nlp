Striking presentation with the dark green against bright white feta with sizzly shrimp. I thought the aniseed was a little too crunchy when I added it to the tzatziki, so I skipped it on the shrimp. Used nice big guys and would do the same next time. My only complaint iseven with the tzatzikiI would have liked the spinach to be dressed in some way. We ended up drizzling with a little olive oil at the table. I served with a side salad of quinoa, avocado, and tomato, and then some kind of lemon-garlic vinaigrette that I just made up.

The tzatziki was very good - I will definitely make again. The shrimp was just okay - a little bland.

This was excellent! The spinach, shrimp and tzatziki complemented each other wonderfully! I didn't have a grill available, so I broiled the skewers for about 2 minutes per side and they turned out great!

Fast, easy and delicious. Instead of barbequing the shrimp I tossed them with dill, olive oil, salt and pepper and roasted at 400 degrees for 8 minutes. The tzatziki came together in just a couple of minutes and the whole dish was a fantastic and light weeknight meal. Threw in some kalamata olives for an extra punch of flavor. My husband loved it! I also doubled the tzatziki recipe and used it for chicken sandwiches the next day. yum!

I only made the tzatziki from this recipe, but it was pretty good. I used red onion instead of shallots, and five spice powder instead of the aniseed. It's not traditional or how it is served in a Greek restaurant but still very good! If I made it again, I would chop the cucumbers smaller.

DELICIOUS. I can't imagine anyone not liking this if they are a fan of the ingredients. And it's healthy!

Disapointing.

This is a great, easy to make salad, and it's tasty! I didn't buy the aniseed due to price, however, the tzatziki was definitely missing something. I will make this again and spend the extra cash for the special spice.

I loved this take on tzatziki with the addition of aniseed. I made a huge tub of it that I've been using on veggie wraps for lunches. The salad was refreshing and delicious. A perfect summer dinner.

I loved this dish! A great meal to serve when you are hungry but don't want a huge meal. The tzatxiki sauce tasted so fresh. This is a perfect summer dish.

Used big, fresh gulf-coast shrimp...sweet and delectable on the grill. The salad doesn't work; it needs crunch and more flavor, maybe some walnuts would suffice. The tzatziki concoction turned out o.k., but I only used plain low-fat yogurt instead of the the thicker Greek yogurt. We served this with homemade grilled basil flatbread (from a recipe on this site) and it made all the difference. The flatbread I'll definitely make again.

Really really good - just make sure you buy some pita bread to go along with it. We were missing it! Also, use some rosemary on the shrimp to make them a little more livly.

LOVE! Served with couscous and kalamata olives.

Rather than sprinkle the feta over the salad I mixed it right into the tzatziki to create a dip for the shrimp. Since I took it to a party I omitted the spinach base and just served this dish as an appetizer. The shallots are much tastier than just garlic and onion, and give it a great crunch.

Easy and delicious. No shallots at the market(!), used traditional garlic in the tzatziki, otherwise stuck to the recipe. Can't imagine leaving out he aniseed and feta, the flavors worked really well together. Served with some grilled eggplant, it was a great summer meal.

I decided to run the sauce through the food processor and it made all the difference. Nice, thick sauce that really stuck to the shrimp.

Yum. Doubled the recipe and had the leftovers with roasted red peppers in wraps for lunch. Nice for summer.

I love this recipe. So quick and easy. The Whole Foods near us sells pre- cleaned, skewered shrimp for $1.99 per 5 shrimp skewer. It took a total of 15 minutes for me to get this dinner on the table and it was delicious! It's a wonderful light supper for a warm summer night. I left out the aniseed but otherwise followed to the letter.

Two things: first, I'm a huge fan of tzatziki and I will always and forever use exclusively garlic--I tried the shallots as the recipe suggested, but the flavor just wasn't the same. Second, the aniseed really does make a difference, adding a wonderful dimension to the dish. I thought that using both feta AND tzatziki was a little bit of overkill, so we left the feta out, which is fine because I don't think it would have worked that well with the shrimp anyway. We grilled the shrimp and added a bit of Greek oregano, which in addition to being yummy complemented the aniseed. For folks who are interested in a good wine pairing, we served this with the Semillon that our wine club sent us this month, and even though it's far from my favorite type of wine, the herbal and grassy notes really did taste delicious with this food. I would TOTALLY make this again.

Ick! The tzatziki is basically a raita, which I've had with Indian cuisine as a condiment to cut the heat of spicy food. I just don't get topping grilled shrimp with this stuff! And sprinkling feta on shrimp! Yuk! The grilled shrimp was great, but why ruin it with feta and yogurt! I just don't get this combination.

I lived in Greece for a few months, and that tzatziki is as good as any I had while I was there! Doesn't need the aniseed--I made it without, and it was delicious. I tossed the shrimp in dill, garlic, and olive oil and roasted them. Great with couscous.

Refreshing, relatively healthy summer Sunday supper. Relatively because, come on... LOWFAT Greek yogurt? Oh H311 no! I'll skip a dessert now & then, but I'm going for the deluxe version if I'm gonna eat Greek yogurt! I skipped the aniseed, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I almost skipped the feta on my own serving, cuz I'm generally not in love with it, but I'm glad I decided to go for it. I had a hunch that the tzatziki would be a hit, so I doubled the batch. Good plan, cuz the beau & I both loved it. We'll be pita-ing it up over the next day or so. This recipe has been added to the rotation!

I made this for a light summer supper, and it was great. I skipped the aniseed, but I do think it may have needed it because it needed a kick of spice/flavor. It was delicious, and was a big hit. I roasted the shrimp at a high temp (450 degrees) instead of grilling.

Very simple to make and quite good. We didn't have any aniseed and I don't think the dish missed it. I added a bit of honey to the tzatziki and served it with garlic bread. Would definitely make it again for a quick and easy meal.

Fantastic! I made it on a grill pan without skewers and skipped the dill b/c my dinner guest doesn't like it, but it was still fantastic! Accompanied it with Smashed Potatoes...
