I made this for Christams dinner this year, but because i couldn't find a goose in time i made it with 2 ducks. i'm so glad i did, it took 1/2 the time and i'm sure it was just as amazing. I would certainly make it the next family dinner i have.

I blanched the goose and allowed it to dry overnight because I wanted really crisp skin. Followed the recipe as-is but also brushed the goose with the cider glaze from the cider-brined turkey recipe (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cider-Brined-and-Glazed-Turkey-233148) It came out delicious! Apples were a good complement to the goose and also to the ham I served on Christmas.

What a winner! This recipe created a succulent, flavorful bird with not much work. No basting for me, and still the goose was golden brown. My local markets didn't have a 13 lb goose, so I used a 10 lb bird and cut the cooking time. The very thick Gala apple slices caramelize beautifully while maintaining their shape, and their flavor perfectly complemented the roasted garlicky goose. (My local markets were out of Calvados, so I mixed 3 TBSP whiskey with 1 TBSP sparkling apple cider.) I served alongside whole yams roasted in a bit of goose fat and large sprigs of rosemary. Everyone raved about the meal. BTW, the James Beard method used by the other cook doesn't allow for the garlic slivers to permeate the taste of the roasted goose. In the recipe's cooking method, the fat renders very nicely, better to my mind than the James Beard method. This recipe will be a new family tradition.

I cooked the goose more like Beard's method; at 400o for an hour to render the fat before pricking the bird to let the fat out. Then dropping the temp to 375 for the rest of the cooking. I tucked garlic, fresh rosemary, thyme, and sage into the cavity for the last 45 mins or so. The apples in this recipe made a lovely tasty applesauce, but certainly weren't what I expected. Not at all "carmelized." I generally make carmelized apples on the stove top with the skin on, and serve them as a dessert course. I'll do that next time. So, generally, this recipe was a fail for me.

Does this recipe work well with wild egyptian geese? I'd like to give it a try on the one that sits on the parapit wall next to my bedroom window and wakes me up in the morning.

After all the great reviews, I was expecting more. The goose was okay, but seemed to be missing something. Maybe it was just my bird. The apples totally fell apart, though they did have good flavor. Made me sad it didn't turn out better...

We've been making this for the last 4 years. It's actually a very easy dinner, great when paired with potatoes roasted in goose fat. It makes Christmas dinner very special, and different than Thanksgiving.

I don't give out 4 forks often, but this recipe was such a hit at the open house Christmas party I attended. The apples were scrumptuous, and the goose was delicious. I did scald it the day before cooking it (per instructions in the Joy of Cooking), and the cooking time for my goose was less than here. But otherwise, this recipe is simple and perfect.

I had 20 guests coming and decided to make this for Christmas. We had a ham, pork roast, and turkey breast in case it wasn't any good - none of us ever had goose before. Well, after the eating was over, there was no goose left at all and there was plenty of the other meats. Everyone loved it so much that I have been told that this is now our new tradition. The apples were such a perfect complement that it seems that they were created specifically to be eaten with goose!!! The only thing I did differently, I brined the goose ahead of time, so I did not flip or baste it - just cooked it breast side up. Absolutely lovely.

I got a 13 pound goose but it came out way too overdone. I would flip the goose at the 2 hour mark next time. The apples are delicious and my guests raved about them.

Great recipe, except my Mother made it at times w/prunes & apples. She was from Silesia [former East Germany] & goose is a standard Christmas recipe in most of Germany, especially the Eastern part. Loved it!

I made this for Christmas and we loved it. I couldn't find a goose that big where I live, so I had to scale everything down, but it worked great. I will probably make more apples next time just because I really enjoyed them with the goose. I used apple cider instead of the Calvados, and there are no complaints here. My husband and 20-month-old son couldn't get enough of it.

I made slits for the garlic, then immersed the goose in boiling water for a minute and dried it and refrigerated it for a day before cooking it. The skin was crispy and the meat flavorful. I wonder whether I needed to boil it to make the skin so yummy. Has anyone done both?

This is a great recipe for those of us who are beginners to roasting geese. Ours turned out a lovely dark brown and the meat was fully cooked but juicy - not a bit greasy! The apples were a perfect match. We couldn't find calvados so we just used brandy and it worked fine. Served the goose and apples with wild rice and green beans.

Great goose and the apples make the dish. Check temp early as mine cooked in less time.

This was my first encounter with goose -- turned out great. I used granny smith apples, and it was a divine tart-sweet accompaniment.

This was my first goose. I followed the recipe exactly. So delicious, so easy, so crisp. The apples would make a fabulous dessert. If you've never made a goose, don't wait any longer!!!

I made this for Christmas dinner as per the recipe. The time spent preparing the goose with thin slices of garlic was well rewarded as the bird came out of the oven truly succulent without being at all greasy. Everyone raved about it !

I actually didn't made the apples for this dish, just the goose. It was great! I was worried all the garlic would be too heavy, but it wasn't. The skin was nice and crisp -- I think cutting the slashes and then keeping them open with the garlic was key. I added the time wrong, so I didn't end up turning the goose over so it looked a little funny but tasted great. A great and very easy goose recipe.

Christmas Goose!!! It was Great, the first time cooking a goose. We used three times the garlic. I had leftover apple from a brined pork recipe. I added it to the baking apples. It had onion, raisin and cream. It was a wonderful addition.

I'm making this dish for Christmas for the second time. The first time I made it I got rave reviews from all...and our friends are foodies! No Calvados was available so I used apple cider, I also added to the sliced apples, small "lady" apples, and fresh figs (out of season in December and wicked hard to come by). It was a great combination! I highly recommend the figs if you can find them!

The first time I used a chicken and the apples with butter and no calvados were great. The second time, my husband grilled a goose and the apples wrapped in foil with goosefat and no calvados were even better. Both birds were excellent. The red cabbage recipe with the original recipe is excellent without the chestnuts and perfect with the apples.

This was the first time a cooked a goose and I made this recipe for Christmas dinner. It was wonderful, my guests raved and raved. The goose was outstanding and the apples added just the right touch. I saw in other goose preparations, in order to have very crisp skin, that the goose should be braised for 1 minute and then chilled uncovered for 2 days. I did this, I also used the pan drippings for gravy after pouring off all the fat. I flavored it with about a 1/4 cup of Calvados, it was delicious.

I used a combination of recipes for the goose and I was pleased with the result.The apples were a 3-4.They went great with the goose and I found with the use of a little extra lemon I could prepare the dish several hours ahead and combine just before cooking.

Very straight forward. The flavor combination was wonderful. The apples melt in your mouth. We'll probably make the apples again without the goose!
