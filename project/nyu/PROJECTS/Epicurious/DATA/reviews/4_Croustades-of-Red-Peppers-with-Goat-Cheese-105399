This was a hit! I used small pear tomatoes and didn't peel or seed them, and it was delicious. I used a whole wheat french bread, sliced into individual portions to make it more of an appetizer for a group.

Excellent flavor- even without the cheese.

I made this appetizer for an impromtu gathering of gormets... top rating...The contrast of the sweet red pepper to the goat cheese gave it the uniqueness

Easy and delicious. I have made it as written, or with roasted red peppers in the jar and left over carmelized onions from the grilled sausage sandwiches on this site (which were awesome) to save time. Don't miss out on this one.

I thought this was a great recipe and relatively easy to prepare. Everyone at my dinner party really enjoyed them.

Great alternative to bruschetta but 4 peppers is way to many. Cut recipe in 1/2 or you'll be freezing 1/2. Follow others suggestions to chop rather than slice as well. It was a great appetizer to Roasted Red Pepper Soup. You can grill the peppers on the BBQ rather than broiler too.

I agree... chop the peppers! I was the lucky eater who had the pepper indelicately streaming down my chin... in spite of that, the dish was delightful. Pretty too.

This seemed too simple...I was tempted to tweak it a bit. But I fixed it as written except that I used some feta cheese I had on hand as the topper. And I coarsely chopped the onions and peppers so things wouldn't dangle when one took a bite. It was awesome. A perfect combination of flavors. I look forward to fixing it with soup or a salad to make a complete meal.

Very easy to make and absolutely delicious. I love that you can prepare it one day ahead. One pepper per person is rather a lot, though.
