Grotesque!!! Use the Steak Diane recipe from "Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home" It's not hard!

Are you freaking KIDDING? Make the real thing or make something else; calling this amalgam "Steak Diane" is false advertising and insulting. Epicurious, you have fallen to a new low.

Black bean soup in Steak Diane?! Who in the WORLD thought up this atrocious addition. For shame.

I was looking for a variation of the recipe, but this should be called something else. If you liked this recipe, that's great. However, no Steak Diane recipe should have beans of any kind involved in it. It might taste fine but it is not Steak Diane. I would never make this recipe, based on the inclusion of beans. I've been cooking this dish for 40 years and have cooked this dish tableside in the finest of restaurants. Do yourself a favor and look for another Steak Diane recipe.

This dish was great. I substituted canned, black bean with liquid and a bit of beef stock for the bean soup. While I understand that some people may not like the texture or starch from the beans, I thought it was nicely smooth. And since black beans are always in my pantry, this ingredient was very convenient. I also substituted for the Madeira (which I only have from time to time) with 1/2 red wine and 1/2 brandy. Also, since I always have cilantro, I substituted cilantro for the Italian parsley. I agree that the mustard and Worcestershire sauce together were a bit bitter, thus I diluted the sauce a bit with the other ingredients to weaken those flavors a tad. However, if you like mustard and vinegar, you may want to keep those proportions as is. After I combined all of ingredients in the pan, I pureed again with my electric hand blender/mixer which further smoothed the sauce. I served this dish with some fresh, assorted mushroom sauteed with butter, shallots and a touch of white wine.

You can't be serious. Canned black beans in a Steak Diane recipe? Leave them out and the recipe is excellent. Call it something else if you want to present it. While the ingredients of a classic Steak Diane will always be a subject of discussion, even controversy, no 1950s date-night orderers of this dish EVER encountered puréed beans on their plates!!!

A delicious and easy-week night favorite at our house.

Easy and delicious. Made this on a thursday to raves from both kids and adults. Note, I followed this recipe exactly, but I'll bet you could substitute for the Maderia without any problem.

It looked good, but wasn't. Save your time and skip this one!!

I thought this sounded delicious, but imho the sauce had a bitter unpleasant taste. To me the worcestershire and mustard together may have been too much.

Excellent! It was simple to prepare, required very little prep. I omited the Madeira due to preference.
