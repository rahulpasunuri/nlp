This gets 3.5 but I'm erring on the positive side. This is the (nearly) classic Irish stew. It's simple, tastes terrific and the trick is to let the thing cook slowly.

Okay, so I changed a lot, but it was delicious. Don't be trapped in the recipe! Lamb stew meat, three potatoes, three carrots, fresh thyme & rosemary, large red onion, garlic, one beer, chicken broth, & a boat load of chopped kale. Simmered in the oven for five hours, then did a little seasoning at the end. Really, really, delicious (and healthy)!

Love this recipe. I normally replace the water with broth. Family love it especially on the 2nd day.

I have been using this recipe since 07 and totally love it. I guess it will be my own family recipe one day. I replace water with either vegetable broth or chicken broth and also cooked in on a pressure cooker. The stew is tastier the next day.

This is a perfect recipe for stew. But the thing is, there is NO right or wrong way to make an "Irish Stew". Everybody has their own recipe, different veg, meat, etc. Just use the veg and meat you prefer and you will like it all the more.

I was quite pleased with the results of this recipe. I did however,as a result of many of the reviews I read, change a few things. I bought boneless lamb (I am a bit of a lazy cook) and I used beef stock instead of water. I would definitely make ths again.

Interesting. Many of the changes to this recipe turned an almost Irish Stew into an American Stew. Why make changes to the ingredients? If it aint just lamb, potato, onion, salt and pepper, it aint Irish Stew.

This was really good. But I made it alot easier by using boneless meat, and substituting water with beef broth. It is very flavorful and I received many compliments.

I pretty much followed the recipe as written with the following exceptions: cut back on the amount of potatoes, didn't use leeks, added a green pepper and some mushrooms. I also didn't puree the vegetables but will probably do that next time. I had reserved some of the fat from browning the lamb and made a roux to thicken the sauce. My sweetie loved it! I was tempted to put some Guinness in it but read on another site that it would make the stew bitter. He enjoyed his Guinness on the side. I can't wait to have a bowl tomorrow night after it's had a chance to meld the flavors.

I'm the same person who wrote the review below. Forgot to mention, I also added 5 chopped and seeded tomatoes.

This is the second time I've made this dish. You do NOT need to hassle with the bones. I got boneless lamb shoulder. Saved tons of time and potential loss of fingers. Recipie is just as good this way. Also altered a few things: Fried bacon and used bacon fat in addition to lamb fat. Crumbled bacon and put in stew. Floured lamb for browning. Added fresh garlic with frying onions and carrots. Used more stout than water. Used dryed thyme. Also smashed about 10 cloves which brings out a nice flavor. Made with garlic/irish cheddar mashed potatoes. Boil potatoes in chicken stock with mashing. Gives a killer flavor.

I used a lamb shoulder and it was quite time-consuming to separate meat, fat, and bones. For the effort and taste difference, I prefer the beef stew on this site which was outstanding. Using lamb stew meat would make a big difference in terms of time. I omitted the potatoes and served over mashed potatoes.

A comment on all of the recipes shown for Irish Stew. Having lived there, I can tell you that none of them would be served in Ireland as Irish stew. Irish stew is: Lamb, peeled potatoes, onions, water, salt, pepper, and absolutely NOTHING else.

Lamb is not my favorite thing, but this stew is delicious, worth the trouble of the trimming of five pounds of lamb chops. Probably the bones add a lot of the richness to the finished product. Served over mashed potatoes--excellent.

I hadn't made this recipe in a couple of years but decided it was just the thing for my book group meeting. I picked the book "The Banished Children of Eve" by Peter Quinn for our March selection, as it had to do with the Irish immigrants in this country during the Civil War. I then decided to do an Irish dinner theme and knew this Irish Stew recipe would be perfect. Yes, it does require a considerable amount of prep time but is well worth the effort. I did find that the fat rendering took more that five minutes. I used my largest LeCrueset roasting pan and did the fat on low for about 20 minutes. Not only do you get enough fat to brown all the meat, but wonderful brown bits in the pan as well. I'm serving Irish cheeses to start, the stew with Irish soda bread and Irish butter, and will finish off the meal with an Irish whiskey cake - a recipe from Downey's here in Philadelphia. Of course, there will be plenty of Irish coffees as well!!!! This recipe is not for the faint hearted, but once you go to the trouble this will be your all time favoite! Enjoy!!

We make this stew every year for St. Patrick's day. It is VERY time consuming and not for the feint-of-heart, but it is SO worth it. Everyone loves it so much that there can be NO discussion of changing the menu. We keep the potatoes out and serve it over mashed. YUM.

The following is an excellent recipe. BALLYMALOE IRISH STEW Ingredients:  2 pounds shoulder lamb chops, about 1-inch thick  Salt  Freshly ground black pepper  2 tablespoons vegetable oil  1/2 cup Guinness beer or any dark beer  1 pound new potatoes  1 pound baby carrots, peeled  1 pint pearl onions, peeled  4 cups lamb stock  2 tablespoons dark roux  2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley leaves Preparation instructions: Season the lamb chops with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven, over medium heat, add the oil. When the oil is hot, but not smoking add the chops. Sear for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove the chops from the pan and set aside. Add the beer and continue to cook for 1 minute, scraping any brown particles off the bottom of the pan. Add the lamb back to the pan. In a mixing bowl, toss the vegetables with salt and pepper. Add the vegetables to the pan. Cover with the stock. Bring the liquid to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to medium low. Simmer for about 2 hours or until the lamb falls off the bone. Stir in the roux and continue to cook for 10 minutes. Stir in the parsley and spoon into serving bowls. Yield: 4 servings

Made this for St. Patrick's day. I agree with the one comment that separating the bones and fat can be fairly time-consuming and difficult. The end result is excellent though. Tasty and filling. I added beer in place of one of the cups of water.

I thought this dish was a bit bland. I would also use stew meat --instead of cutting meat from bones. I thought this made the dish more difficult without making it better. Also too much meat --and I would use either very very small whole potatoes or else chopped potatoes, because potatoes if too big tend to get in the way of the other ingredients when dishing out for a crowd. The flavors in this dish were improved the second day -- I would not make this dish again without variation.

Although the end product was good, I was highly frustrated by the process of removing the meat and fat from the bone. If you're going to do this, I suggest simply buying 2 or three pounds of lamb stew meat and 1 or 2 pounds of lamb shoulder with the bone in. Once the bones have stewed, you may easily remove the meat. Otherwise, you're apt to slice off an appendage in your efforts to get any amount of meat off the bone. I agree you should add some Stout or Ale instead of water -- otherwise the stew can be a bit bland

This was absolutely delicious, and I certainly would not hesitate to make it again, as it was a big hit. I agree with another reviewer who said that it took a lot of time, which it certainly does, but it's worth it!

My husband made this for a March dinner party...it was a huge hit...wonderful flavors. Served it with Irish Wheat Bread and Chocolate Whiskey Souffle Tarts from this site.

I made this dish for St. Patty's Day and everyone absolutely loved it. Although it was a lot of work, I would definitely make it again. Instead of the two cups water, I used half water, half Murphy's Irish Stout, and made it the day before service to give the flavors a chance to meld. Delish! Served it with salad and bread and butter, and it was enough for 8 or more.

I used the above recipe at our (Thanksgiving, Nationality party dish)office party. So being of Irish Blood back ground and First time cook, It was perfect, I was complemented on the flavors. The office wanted me to cook it again. Thank you very much.. Timothy P. Gilson
