This should be 1 fork for possibly the worst cookie I've ever made. It was dry, crumbly and baked up even drier. Possibly it would have been better with sweetened coconut but I used unsweetened as the receipe suggested. This did not make my save for next year list.

pretty easy to make except for separating the yolk from the egg white. i used green sanding sugar to be a tad more festive. good if you want to make something different

These. Are. Awesome! If you like coconut (many people don't), you'll love these. The good news: it's very simple to mix the dough for this; you don't even need a mixer. The warning: forming the pyramids takes quite a while. Maybe I'm a slow learner, but it was time-consuming (though not overly difficult) to get those pyramid shapes. I did not have any rose extract, and I don't know how much that would add to this. Everyone raved about them and they were gobbled up in one day.
