Nothing that's going to blow your mind, but it was a nice change of pace, and a better accompaniment to the Filipino London Broil also on this site than plain rice would have been. One thing I felt was that the method was overly complex, so next time, I'll just cook my rice as usual (simmered 20 minutes on the stove) and just pour the vinegar mixture over. I've eaten rice almost daily for over 20 years, and don't see a noticeable difference between regular rice preparation and this odd rinse-soak-simmer-boil-rest method.

I've never tried rice prepared this way before and love it - it gives rice a little bite - I will definitely make this again. Made with the Filipino London Broil & Mango Salsa.

I loved this recipie. I took another reviewer's suggestions and served it with the Filipino Style Flank Steak (also very good). Yummy! My family loved it.

Flavor was fine but way too sticky at these proportions, Id half the vinegar mixture next time.

Like sushi rice, only not as good. I will stick to the tried and true recipes found on the rice vinegar label and/or sushi rice container. waaaaaaaay better.

I concur with the other reviewers - it's a great recipe. I too made it with the Filipino Style Flank Steak as suggested, also delicious. Has anyone doubled the recipe? I'm curious how doubling would affect cook times. There was only enough rice for my and husband and I (we were very hungry at the time) and I'd like to make for company.

This has an outstanding sweet, sour, salt balance. I do not recommend reducing the sugar. I served this with Filipino Style London Broil (excellent) and they complimented each other perfectly.

I never thought I would be rating rice at four forks, but this rice is worthy. The vinegar and sugar give it an intriguing flavor. I serve this with Ginger Flank Steak with Sake-glazed Vegetables (recipe also from this web site).

Good rice for sushi; however I made it with the Scallops w/Ginger Sauce as suggested by another review. An excellent combination. I also used only 1/2 the sugar and it was perfect.

This was a delicious and refreshing way to prepare rice. I only used 1/2 tbsp of sugar, and it was still excellent. I served it along with grilled chicken, and my husband raved about it. Will definately make again!

This dish is delicious and I have made it numerous times, a personal favorite. I usually cook only for myself, so I cut the proportions from one cup of rice to between 1/4 and 1/2 cup, but I use the same amount of the vinegar solution. I also add about a teaspoon of salt to the boiling water of the rice, and usually forget to cook it on high heat for the last minute, and I can't tell the difference.
