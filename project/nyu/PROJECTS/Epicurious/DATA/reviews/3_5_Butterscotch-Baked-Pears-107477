Exceptional. I made this a cold winter night and was delighted. Dietary restrictions necessitated that I omit the Scotch, but I added a few glurgs of heavy cream instead and whisked smooth. Delicious.

I don't understand. I've tried this twice now, and both times my sauces seizes up once I put the pears in, and becomes a congealed ugly mess. Either I'm not understanding these instructions, or they're not written very well. If anyone has any advice, please tell.

So good. This would be part of a wonderful winter brunch, or could be served with pound cake and/or whipped cream as a dessert.

I brought these pears to some friends' house the other night, and they were very good. I will be making them again for our formal family Christmas dinner. They are very, very simple to make and are a lovely presentation. I did take the suggestion of a few reviewers to double the sauce, and I'm glad I did because it was very tasty. Although I served the pears as a side dish to dinner, these (particularly with the extra sauce) could be served as a desert and would compliment ice cream, a slice of pound cake, or a little ricotta cheese nicely. I did not have a problem with the sauce hardening, as some reviewers claimed to have had. Most likely they had the heat up too high, they didn't stir enough, or they waited too long to serve the dish, so the sugars crystalized. But, again, I thought this was a lovely, simple dish and I would recommend it to others.

I was really looking forward to this recipe, given my love for butterscotch and the positive reviews. However, I was a bit let down. The flavours were nice enough, but it was all just sweet without any depth of flavour. Also, my sauce did separate, as it did for another reviewer. This dish really does need to be served right after being finished (I let mine sit a little and the sauce hardened right up).

Recipe was the hit of a recent brunch club gathering. Rave reviews! Easy to make the first time. Pears were perfect consistency -- not too mushy, not too firm. Would be a great holiday dish as well. Will definitely make again!

Perfect the first time! The second time I doubled the sauce - I used half to bake the pears, and reduced the other half in a saucepan with the Scotch and vanilla, so that it was ready to spoon over the pears. For Christmas dinner, I served a half pear with a small slice of warm chocolate raspberry pudding cake and a spoonful of vanilla ice cream. What a Christmas dessert! I never had so many rave reviews.

This was so easy and so delicious! It's a perfect fall dessert... and perfectly fine without the scotch.

I don't know what happened. The pears were good, but the sauce didn't turn out. Do you whisk the brown sugar in over heat? I couldn't get it to dissolve completely so it congealed after baking and hardened instead of being a syrup. What was my error? Suggestions?

Thirty minutes was too long--next time I'll check at 25 minutes. Otherwise we really enjoyed these pears.

oh my gosh. so good and SO easy. after dinner my husband asked for a pear creme brulee, and after telling him that takes a day to prepare, i found this recipe and served. again, SO easy and SO quick. especially great when there are so many pears and i love to cook/bake what's in season.

So easy to make and so delicious!!! I used honey instead of brown sugar. Be sure to make more of this butterscotch sauce for most likely you will be asked to make a second batch :)

Made these for mother's day dinner & my mom asked when I was going to make them again before dessert was done! My pears were quite ripe, so I cooked them a bit longer and they turned out great. Served them with a bit of Haagen-Daz Dulce de Leche ice cream. Mmmmmm.

Unbelievably good for such minimal effort. Was able to prep them after dinner while we served coffee. Will make these again for sure.

This simple preparation effort yields a wonderfully impressive dish. Served with vanilla ice cream, it has a very bananas foster type taste (always a bonus in my book). To double our pleasure, I made a second batch of the sauce on the stove top while the pears were baking. I added a little heavy cream to smooth out the sauce, sliced the baked pears and spooned both over the ice cream....very tasty.

I've made this several times for company. Everyone loves these pears, even those who tend to prefer fattier desserts! Simple and tasty; I will keep making this.

An extremely simple dish that produces wonderful results. Delicious served over vanilla ice cream.

I never knew butterscotch could be so easy to make and turn out so deliciously! Atop the baked pears and vanilla ice cream, this sauce was a dream. I will definitely be trying this sauce with other things soon...apple-stuffed french toast perhaps...yum!

Wow! Made this for New Years Eve. We are gifted with Harry and David pears every Christmas. What a wonderful combination of flavors. I will make this again!

I brought this dish to a brunch over the holidays and was a bit embarassed when this simple pear dish got all the raves from the other guests while the hostess had prepared many wonderful dishes herself. It is an especially nice dessert to serve when you aren't sure if your guests may be lactose intolerant, allergic to wheat, etc. Very simple to make and simply wonderful!

The butterscotch sauce is heaven in a bowl! Next time, I'll skip the pears (althought they were very good with the sauce; I used Harry & David pears we received as a Christmas gift)and just make a triple or even quadruple batch of the butterscotch sauce (a single recipe doesn't make very much) and serve it over french toast or waffles. Yummy!

great, fast and easy. Ice cream is great with the pears and sauce. So much faster than pears pouched in wine.

Delicious and easy! I used fewer pears so that each serving would have plenty of sauce -- great over ice cream. Make sure your pears are ripe, as they won't soften much in this quick baking time.
