I added cilantro instead of parsley like the others reviewers suggested. I also added some diced avocado for texture. It was great. I put this over crab cakes and it was a hit. I will be making this again with many other fish dishes.

This was super good! The salsa added a nice compliment to the fresh Ahi. I ended up pan-searing the fish in a bit of olive oil and had to make two subsitutions in the salsa, but i'm guessing it would be good the original way as well. I added an avacado and subsituted a red onion for the green onion. tastey! i'd make it again for sure, and the salsa is amazing on its own.

I loved the fact that this is low calorie. The salsa needs more zing, however. More chilis would be a good start. Perhaps some additional flavoring like fish sauce would help.

One of my top fish dishes ever! The salsa was bursting with fresh flavors and really complemented the tuna. I made it for someone in cooking school and he was impressed!

Tried this tonight because I was looking for a low calorie dish and my husband had caught yellow fin tuna. It was great. Didn't have corn and didn't miss it, added chiffonade of basil as herb instead of parsley and used picked jalapenos (didn't have fresh and the garden hadn't produced any yet). The salsa would go great w/ chicken or pork too. Marinated the tuna in lime juice for 10 min and seared in a non stick skillet spayed w/ olive oil. A keeper.

I used cilantro instead of parsley as other reviewers suggested, and pan seared the tuna steaks in a little sesame oil. The salsa makes it colourful and adds a bit of zing.

Yum. This salsa would be excellent over halibut as well or just served with chips. Next time I may add a bit of cilantro to the dish for a little more zest but I also loved it exactly how it is.

This mango-corn salsa was great! I made the salsa with salmon instead of tuna and it was delicious. This we will be making often.

Good summer dinner. We had it with Israeli cous cous with garlic. I only put in a small amount of green onions, a half a cup seemed over powering. I added a small piece of cuccumber instead. I used half parsley and half cilantro. I think cilantro was key. I also used a canned mexican poblano salsa because I didn't have jalapenos. I think any type of salsa would help bring the flavors together. I just grilled the fish and didn't bother with the pepper.

Loved this, but made a lot of changes. I seared Ahi in a pan, replaced the parsley with cilantro (a mistake that turned out great), and used 1 serrano chilli in place of the jalapeno. I'd make this again, for sure!

I've made this several times in several different ways. The best part has always been the salsa, but I use cilantro instead of parsley for a little kick. The fish is just OK - the salsa makes it.

A great dish for a hot summer night! The grilled fish and the cool spicy sweet salsa are a great contrast. Have used with different types of fish and with Pork tenderloin chops.

Believe it or not it needed salt.

Never made it as in recipe. I've used the mango salsa on chicken, salmon and swordfish--delicious.

I wish I hadn't followed the recipe so precisely. I broiled it in the oven and did not turn the tuna over. While the fillets looked very done, in fact the bottom side was not even warm. Plus I thought the cracked pepper overpowered all of the more subtle flavors in the salsa.

Very good. I don't agree with the idea that this dish is too strong. I guess it's a matter of taste - for us it was just right! I added a little chicken broth (sorry...) so the fish wouldn't be so dry (I could only get thin fillets at my supermarket), and broiled the salsa along with the fish. It was wonderful-try it!

This recipe is one of my favorites, have made it numerous times. Very light, extremely flavorful. Great for summer.

I served this at a dinner party and it was enjoyed by all. Very simple to prepare. Using fresh Ahi tuna steaks made all the difference and allowed me to cook it medium rare. The dish is very colorful and makes for nice presentation. A delicious white Burgundy was a perfect choice. I will definitely make it again.

Alright This recipe was great, and i would recommend it to anyone who has access to FRESH fish- not Frozen Fresh (that in itself makes a huge difference) I also roasted the corn and peppers before chopping and that gave the salsa a fun flavor. Try It !!!

Simply not very good. Easy to make but very strong.
