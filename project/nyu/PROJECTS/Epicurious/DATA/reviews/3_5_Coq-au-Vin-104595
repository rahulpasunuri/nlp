This dish took me some time to make but it was well worth the effort every time (I made it several times and it was always a big success)! It is even better if you make it with rooster as the traditional recipe calls for, but it's hard to find rooster in the DC area.

Pretty good, but could have been better. I will try it again and use more wine (we felt there wasn't enough sauce) I will also add garlic and probably try brandy instead of the port.

Have used this recipe for years now. When the rains come to the Northwest in the Fall and the Chanterelles fruit, I use them instead of the mushrooms called for in the recipe. It definitely gives it a different taste, more earthy. But, still a big winner with regular mushrooms.

I made this and modified it by combining it with Alton Brown's rec on food network. Also used brandy instead of port (flamed it in chicken prep) and added Herbes de Provence. Used a Cali Syrah for the wine. The sauce was very rich and awsome. However the chicken itself was bland and dull.

Like others this was a great success. Guests were asking for more gravy to soak up with their bread at the end. I made several suggested changes. Added garlic, pepper corns to marinade and used skinless chicken pieces. I added a few breasts for those who don't like dark meat and left them a bit bigger so they would not dry out. I also add a few drops of gravy browning to tone down the purple and it looked like a deep rich sauce. I also served with garlic infused olive oil mashed potatos and they went perfectly. Great dish.

This recipe was fantastic! My favorite thing about making this dish is nothing has to be precise for it to turn out fabulous... I didn't measure anything, and I used Portobello mushrooms and a sweet onion in place of the pearl onions, and it still turned out great! Served over mashed Yukon Gold potatoes, with green beans on the side, and a CA Pinot Noir.

My family says that this is one of the best chicken dinners ever (but not better than my roasted chicken). I know cheaters are not appreciated...but the busy mom had to..followed the recipe exactly with the following exceptions: was only able to marinate in a french pinot noir w/trimmings for 7 hours. Did not have cognac on hand, so used 1 cup cooking marsala wine and 1/2 cup grand marnier. I also added 10 whole peeled cloves of garlic. Served with olive oil potatoes. The well traveled 45 year old, 13 year old, 9 year old and even 4 year old loved it. the perfect bite was big chunk of chicken thigh on a slab of french bread that had been dunked in the sauce with a clove of garlic on it. Will definitely make this one again

This was a delicious dish. We experienced a some problems when preparing it, but worked around with it and the result was fabulous! First of all there was not enough liquid to cook the chicken in ans we only used 4 chicken legs rather than the 6 that the recipe called for. To fix this we cut the legs up and put enough chicken stock in to cover the meat. We also kept all of the vegetables (carrots and celery) and served them with the onions and mushrooms.

Rating: 4
Lots of work & time consuming to prepare, but worth it. Using extra bacon & reducing the sauce a bit more turns this dish into a religious experience.

Rating: 4
After making this the first time, I increased the red wine, added garlic and shallots. Instead of all Port, I used half Port and half cognac, and wild mushrooms. Dont skimp on the wine you drink with this dish. The right one will cut the fat without removing the silkiness of the sauce. I cant remember what my husband chose. Thats his department. We werent bothered by the purplish color, but if you are, turn the lights down and light the candles. A loaf of warm, crusty French bread and this is a delicious, sexy dish.

Classic coq au vin is soaked overnight, and yes it turns a bit purple, but becomes a rich brown after being sauted and simmered (when cooked correctly). The chicken was so tender and delicious, the sauce flavorful, the vegetables wonderful. I would definitely use this recipe again and again.

It tasted good, but the chicken was PURPLE! We had to throw it all away because nobody could bring themselve to eat purple chicken.

I'm really torn on this one. I've braised allot of things including chicken and liked them all until I got into this. It was very tasty for sure but the dark chicken was visually unappealing to me. Chicken is not a robust meat and the wine sauce drowns out the flavor, especially since it's a red wine. I've also prepared allot of french cuisine and have always known the french to bring out the natural flavors in the main ingredient but here that philosophy was not evident. Many other reviewers loved this, it just wasn't for me.

Rating: 4
I've made this twice now - both times it came out delicious. The 1st I used a Bordeaux, the 2nd used a Chianti which I wont use again only because the flavor was too strong. One bottle isnt enough either. Also, I skinned the chicken to reduce the fat. And to reduce the total amount of time in the kitchen, I started the chicken in the wine then did the sauteing. Definately a winner for a delicious winter meal.

Rating: 2
My husband liked this dish, thankfully. Since I didn't really enjoy it, I feel it is a bit too labor intensive to repeat. I used skinless chicken and I did require more wine than suggested for the marinade.

I finished preparing this dish last night and had it for dinner with my boyfriend... it was fantastic. I'm looking forward to leftovers, and to making this for my family one day. I served it with the garlicky mashed potato recipe as suggested and also quickly sauteed some french green beans in olive oil. We felt as if we had just had a satisfying Thanksgiving dinner and needed a nap afterward. Here are my alterations: -- I used two bottles of 2001 Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon. I think the recipe must have a typo, there is no way only one bottle of wine would be enough to cover the chicken as directed. -- I used one ounce of dried porcini mushrooms (not a big fan of mushrooms). I boiled them for 10 min. to rehydrate and reserved 1.5 cups of the porcini-flavored water for later. -- When it was time to add the Port, I used 3/4 cup of Cognac instead, and also added the 1.5 cups of porcini water. -- I substituted corn starch for flour (wheat allergy) for thickening agent to no ill effect. -- Although the chicken skin browned beatifully, we didn't care to eat any of it. The meat was falling off the bone with so little effort, I think next time I will go ahead and remove all of the bones and skin right before dishing out.

I know people hate it when a "reviewer" hasn't made a recipe, but I just wanted to respond to a few complaints here and give a few tips for those who are going to try this dish... If you use Pinot Noir for the wine, you won't get purple chicken. And if the sweetness of port is too much, try a brandy. Hope that helps...

great recipe. make sure to have enough wine on hand!

This dish came out blah and visually unappealing, and was not especially easy to make. I had to add more liquid to cover the chicken, and the reduction didn't work right to make the sauce less plentiful and more concentrated. I could see ways to doctor it, but the dish was not promising enough that I would invest more time and experimenting in it.

My favorite coq au vin recipe. I used more bacon and less port (b/c I didn't have enough on hand), and it was still great.

Rating: 0
I just have to reply to the cook from Florida. What color did you think it would be, considering that you marinated it in RED wine? Coq au vin is all about hearty, real flavors...it's about so much more than the color of the chicken! What is unappetizing about chicken that is purple from marinating in a good, solid French Burgundy?

Rating: 4
Great recipe! My guests loved it. The sauce makes the meal! Like other reviewers said, this really isn't a complicated recipe, and there don't have to be a lot of dishes. I used skinless chicken, which cut back on fat, used baby carrots which I added to meal with mushrooms and onions, used less port but added stock, included garlic, peppercorns and bay leaves in my marinade, and further cut back on cleaning by marinating in plastic bag. Turned out really well, and I had lots of time to work on dessert and appetizers.

Rating: 2
I have to say it's too much effort for the return. Maybe I did something wrong, but I can't figure out what it could be. The chicken ended up looking pretty unappealing (purple)...the flavor was okay but nothing spectacular...I was sorry to have spent all that money and time to serve this to guests. IF I ever attempted this again, I'd certainly use white wine (Coq au Riesling).

Rating: 4
I have made this dish many times and it was always delicous. I never measure, just do to taste. Once I subbed marsala for port and had to sub frozen creamed pearl onions for fresh, which my boyfriend REALLY loved! I usually add garlic and a bit more bacon. Everyone I've made this for raves.

Here it is September and my thoughts are drifting to comfort food -- and this recipe is one of the best. The Port adds an indispensable layer of flavor, but go easy with it. (And, perhaps it's heretical, but I always throw in a few red pepper flakes and the barest hint of cinnamon.) Make it a few days in advance -- it gets only better and better, and you'll be happy to have it ready to serve to good friends on a cold night.

My only complaint about this dish is the port -- it makes it too sweet. If I make it again, I'll put half the amount of port or none at all.

Almost a chicken version of Boeuf Bourguignon. Has a robust flavour and a tantalizing aroma that fills the house. Made some changes: I spiced up the marinade/sauce with 1 Tbsp peppercorns, 5 cloves minced garlic, a 6" sprig of fresh rosemary, sea salt, and I only marinated the chicken for 4 hours which was fine. Instead of increasing wine to cover chicken, I added beef broth which helped to tone down the purplish colour from the red wine - even then the chicken was not an attractive colour even after browning. I increased the amounts of pearl onions and mushrooms, added 4 Tbsp demi-glace for a deeper/richer flavour, omitted the Port (I simply cannot abide its metallic taste), and added 1/2 cup cognac instead. Sauce took a long time to reduce before I thickened with butter/flour. Fairly time consuming and dirties a lot of dishes, but well worth the extra effort involved. This is a hearty, man-pleasing dish that is also company friendly and can be made in advance.

Tried a variation of this recipe (after watch Emeril of course) and forgot to add the fresh thyme, bayleaf, and bacon. Also, instead of using pearl onions, I used chopped onions(better especially when you have picky children) and about 4-5 cloves of garlic. Man, let me tell you, my family ATE IT UP! It was SO great. I would recommend combining this coq au vin recipe with the traditional French one found on Epicurious as well. Don't forget, add lots of mushrooms. They really enhance the flavor of this dish.

I made this dish approximately a year ago and have not made it since. To me, the sauce was dark and rich but not particularly interesting. Also the dish wasn't much on presentation. To those thinking of trying the dish, it was not a bad dish, but it is a lot of work if you do not love chicken in wine sauce.

Rating: 2
The chicken was very tender, but thought it was too sweet, probably due to the port that I used. I only used one bottle of wine, and when I took the chicken and vegetables out, there wasn't much left of the sauce (probably why it was more sweet after I added the port) - next time (if there is - takes a long time!) I would use more wine in the beginning to balance the port.

Rating: 4
Wonderful stuff. I remember an interesting variation on this recipe by one of my French friends in India. In what would seem crazy or blasphemous to an authentic French chef, she first reduced a bottle of WHITE wine by heating it in a saucepan with parsley, rosemary, and thyme, and then marinated the chicken in this wine, and added on a half bottle of burgundy for good effect. She then covered this in foil and let it sit outside for close to ten hours. I don't know if this was what chefs ever did in France, but one things certain - it was the best coq au vin I have ever tasted. Funny how I have never come across the half-wine concept anywhere. You really should try it, though. Its quite something.

A+ all around. I doubled the recipe for a friends family who was having many house-guests. I prepared the day before. Soaking the chicken is a must or the wine doesn't really soak in. I used 2 1/2 bottles of wine, skimmed the top and let it sit on the stove forever. The chicken was so tender and delicious - falling off the bone. I served it over egg noodles and people were talking about it for days. The flavors are rich and there's not much effort unless you count browning meat effort. I'm making it again for Christmas dinner. If you love chicken and you love red wine, you can't go wrong with this dish.

This dish was very tasty, and not difficult to make. My guests gobbled it up. Only two minor complaints. First, and most importantly, the recipe doesn't say the number of servings. I assumed four, and added two more legs/thighs because I had five, but then I panicked when I removed the chicken from simmering; it had shrunk up so much that it just didn't look like enough food. I had some extra boneless thighs on hand that I quickly baked and then added to the mix in the last ten minutes. The marinated chicken was, of course, much better but the added meat wasn't bad and at least I had enough food! Also, the onions seemed undercooked (I followed the cooking times in the recipe exactly, except that the sauteeing was a bit less than 10 minutes because the mushrooms were done before that; perhaps I needed to sautee at a lower temp?) Overall, a terrific recipe.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! Like other reviewers I also had to use two bottles of wine to cover the chicken, in doing so I increased the carrots, onion and celery accordingly. Before reducing the sauce I made sure to pour off the second bottle of wine. Otherwise I'd be reducing forever! The results were unbelievable, I can't wait to make it again.

Rating: 4
This was great....but a pain cleaning all those pots. I ended up using a bottle and a half of wine (cabernet and sangiovese) and a can of chicken broth. I also used about 7 slices of bacon. I also reduced before thickening the sauce and then refrigerating so I could skim the fat. Used 6 thighs and 6 drumsticks. Oh, I also had some roasted garlic that I tossed in at the end and I don't think anyone was harmed by it.

Rating: 4
Loved this dish, but followed alot of the suggestions from the other reviews. Needed only 2 extra cups of wine rather than a whole additional bottle. Used extra mushrooms. Used a fat separator to drain off fat. Reduced before thickening. Added white meat chicken but everyone agreed the dark meat was better. Served with mashed redskin potatos with skins on & wax & green string beans tossed in butter. It was awesome. I don't know what happened to the people who weren't happy with this, but they must have done something wrong.

Rating: 2
It's probably just me, but I found this too labor intensive to prepare again. Though it was good, I don't think marinating the chicken was particularly necessary. Also, it's not a pretty dish to serve to guests...maybe that's my fault, but I felt that the meat tended to fall off the bone and the skin didn't brown enough all over and kept falling off...not appetizing to look at. Perhaps this just requires practice, but since my husband wasn't in love with it, I won't take the three day prep route again. Maybe I can try skinless cuts of meat? I'm not sure. The sauce did turn out nice and rich and VERY dark...not pretty like in the pics. Anyone have any advice?

Very delicious. The meat of the chicken was falling off of the bone. Like another reviewer, I also used two bottles of wine. Made this for our wine group, following earlier suggestions: added coarse salt and peppercorns to marinade, thickened the sauce at the end (after adding the port and reducing). All good ideas and the result could not have been better. Thanks to all the reviewers for making a good recipe even better!

This recipe was great -- not as time-consuming as some and not as greasy as a lot of coq au vin recipes. I did have to use 2 bottles of wine to cover the chicken completely, and, of course, you should not use cheap jug wine if you want this dish to taste right. I also added 2 turkish bay leaves to the recipe.

I've been making Julia Child's version for years. Sorry I have to say hers is a wee bit better although this one is very close. Try adding some garlic and tomatoes to the simmering step. And when straining before thickening the sauce run it through a fat separator....no kitchen should be without one, it does not rob this fine dish of any flavors. I like this all wine version, it truly creates a far better sauce then mixing in any broth. I will never add broth to my fluids again, sorry Julia! All in all this is a very good recipe.

Pay no mind to the naysayers--this is a terrific recipe; serve at a dinner party and your guests will call you a superstar. Hearty, rich and intensely flavorful, with certain minor modifications: add coarse salt & peppercorns to the marinade; add a dash of coarse salt at each step of the cooking process; and finally, follow the reduction advice laid out by the IN contributor: add port only and then reduce for 15 minutes or so, then add the thickener (beurre manie: 2 tbsps butter & 3 tbsps flour), let it heat through and serve. I also served with rosemary-raosted new potatoes, but would encourage others to serve with mashed potatoes (anything that soaks up this fantastic sauce).

Just wonderful. Made for 6 finnicky Frenchmen and got warm compliments. Leftovers were even better than first time.

This is a great dinner party dish. I used thighs and leg parts as opposed to whole, and increased the number of pieces of chicken. It is time consuming, but the results are well worth it! The sauce is even better the next day, after it has had time to cool, thicken, and become richer. Remember to trim the oil off the top. My guests absolutely loved it, and I had none left over (to my disappointment).

I expected more flavor from this dish, so I was a little disappointed. This recipe uses all wine, and no stock, yet the end result lacked flavor. I liked soaking the chicken over night, and I even sauted my chicken in the same pot to make use of the browned bits on the bottom of the pan, but I think next time I would also saute new vegetables to impart more flavor. I also think a dose of herbs, salt and pepper would be in order. Won't make this one again as written.

I had really high expectations of this dish, which probably didn't help my appreciation of it. For the amount of time and work that went into it, it didn't have the complex flavor that I would have expected. The chicken was incredibly tender and quite good, but it just didn't wow me for how long it took to make.

I followed the recipe to the letter and found the taste to be bland and not rich and dark as in other coq au vin recipies I've used in the past. For the time spent in preparing the dish I found it to be a disappointing meal. Tried in vain to bring the flavor UP, salting, peppering, more butter, etc. Nothing worked. I will not use this recipe again.

Rating: 4
Very good recipe, but I changed a couple of things. I made a beurre manie (paste) of 2T. soft butter and 3 T. flour. After straining out the chicken and vegetables, I returned the marinade, along with the port, to the pan and boiled vigorously to reduce to 3 cups. Then I gradually incorporated the flour/butter mixture, whisking all the while. This resulted in a super sauce, and is more in keeping with the usual method of sauce making (it's quite odd to add the thikening agent, and THEN reduce).

Great recipe for coq a vin. I reduced the cooking time significantly by using a pressure cooker- I braised the chicken and wine marinade in the pressure cooker and reduced the sauce the traditional way. The sauce is great over mashed potatoes.

This was OK, but not as wonderful as I expected after reading the other reviews. I used Cabernet Savagnion and had to add extra to cover the chicken. The sauce just never thickened enough at the end. Plus I felt it needed more salt or zip so I added some aromat and white pepper, which helped. All in all, alot of effort for a so so dish.

Rating: 3
This one wowed them! A couple of hints: bite the bullet and use a decent "drinking" cabernet in the recipe. Hard to pour an $18-20 bottle of wine over some chicken - but taste is worth it! I would add more onions and mushrooms next time. Also added 1/2 can of chicken broth to marinade, cooked down a bit more after chicken was done and added a bit more flour to thicken. I served this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes (also from epicurios)- great combo! This one is a keeper!

Served with green beans with roasted onions, mashed pots and the perfect flan from this sight. Try this one.

Great, simple dish...apart from skinning the pearl onions, which was a little fiddly. I also added breasts for those who didn't leg/thigh meat, and they were just as tasty as the darker meat. Used just one bottle of wine and ended up with a rich, velvety sauce...very flavourful. Served the dish with rosemary potatoes. Definitely a keeper.

This was a wonderful entree for a winter evening. I added skinless chicken breasts which for those of us prefering white meat and it wasn't a problem. Parsley new potatoes and steamed green beans made this dish an excellent dinner party recipe. The red wine plus port was incredible.
