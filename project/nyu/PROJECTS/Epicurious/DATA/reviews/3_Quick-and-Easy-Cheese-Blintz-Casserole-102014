I used this recipe and it came out super!! But, after reading a lot of the comments on this page first, I added a little more sugar to the cheese filling, lemon zest, and fresh blue berries for taste and color. It came out very very nice, tasty and colorful. I thought of using canned pie cheeries next time in the filling. For those who like cheese cake, may remind you more of it and looks great!

What a waste! After taking a taste no one wanted to eat it. Most of it went into the garbage. Totally lacking in flavor or any hint of what blintzes taste like.

Very easy to make, and it does separate into layers. However, I found taste too bland, next time I would add a little more sugar and lemon rind in addition to lemon juice.. The top is very pale, so I served the squres upside down,, The underside is a nice crusty brown.

Since I wasn't able to find farmer's cheese, this was just a TAD more work than "quick and easy" implies -- draining and straining cottage cheese! Next time I'd just drain the stuff in a strainer and omit squeezing out liquid as another review suggested. Still the result was tasty, and a nice change from the standard boring souffle made with frozen blintzes. I did use frozen blueberries.

This was just ok. Not even close to the real thing. Too doughy, and the filling wasn't great either. I had hoped it would be better than using frozen blintzes, but this wasn't worth the time and effort. I'll try something else next time.

I like this recipe a lot. It is simple to make and comes out good each time. Much better than the frozen option, though not as good as home-made blintzes.

Don't serve it room temperature whatever you do. Also beware of over cooking. I did both and it was dry and medicore. Hot out of the oven it looked great, but I tried to use it on a buffet. I plan to try it again and serve it piping hot to see if it is better.

Success! I figured out how to do this recipie without the curd style farmers cheese, using a hint from another blintz recipie. I got low fat cottage cheese, put it in a clean dishtowel (or tightly woven dishcloth), and squeezed lots of moisture out of it - reduced it almost by 1/2. I also let it sit uncoved in the refrigerator overnight to dry out a little more. I used two 16 oz tubs of the cottage cheese to yield as much as was needed for the recipie. I added a little extra lemon and sugar, and it worked great.

Absolutely delicious. Very easy to make. Everyone loves it every time I make it. to the other cook in Boston, I buy the farmer's cheese at either the Butcherie (kosher grocery in brookline) or at the Shaw's in the Brighton Mills shopping center on western Ave)

To the other cook from Boston: did you use farmer cheese? Where did you find it?

Like other reviewers, I couldn't find curd-style farmer's cheese, but I bought some packages of mozzarella cheese curds from Burger King (they use them for poutines). It worked out fine, and the asiago cheese gave it a great flavour. The top collapsed on it, but no one knew the difference; some guests asked for the recipe.

My cousin made it for brunch and forced me to eat it! It tasted weird. It was salty and sweet at the same time. Blintzes are supposed to be sweet and dessert-like. This was no such thing! Not recommended.

I made this one for Easter brunch, and everyone loved it. I had a slightly larger pan, and so I made one and half times the batter. I put a tbsp extra of sugar in the cheese mixture to sweeten it just a bit more, and I put a cup and a half of frozen blueberries that had been tossed with some flour, cinnamon and sugar on the cheese mixture before putting the top layer of batter on. This one is a keeper and so easy to make.

this is unbelievably easy and super yummy. It saved my butt when I had an hour to get a dinner party together. I have no freakin' idea what curd-style farmer's cheese is so I went with the previously suggested cream cheese and cottage cheese combo and it came out fine. Served with raspberry applesauce and sour cream.

Delicious! I could not figure out what farmer style curd cheese. I went to 3 grocery stores and asked and people looked at me like I had 3 heads! So I took a guess and picked "pressed cottage cheese" because it was the only thing that came in 8 oz packages. A friend of mine who makes blintzes suggest that I add in a package of light cream cheese and substitute the lemon juice for orange juice. I also put the filling in the food processor. It turned out fantastic. I served it with sour cream and blue berries. Next time, I will put blueberries inside as suggested by someone else. I will definately make this again. Everyone at my brunch loved "the cheese souffle"!

It was very tasty, but I added cinnamon to the filling. I thought the bottom layer was a little thick so I may change the allotments next time. I'll definitely make it again.

This was delicious. I had several people rave about it at my buffet. This is not a dessert, it is best when served during brunch or a light meal. The taste really is like blintzes. I used a combination of farmer's cheese, ricotta cheese, and cottage cheese. Fabulous!!!!

BETTER THAN CONVENTIONAL BLINTZ RECIPE WHICH IS TYPICALLY FRIED OR SAUTEED WITH BUTTER OR OIL. MY FAMILY, FRIENDS & OFFICE STAFF LOVED THE DISH. I MODIFIED THE RECIPE SOMWHAT BY ADDING BLUEBERRIES AFTER I SPREAD THE CHEESE FILLING BUT PRIOR TO ADDING ADDITIONAL BATTER.

Haven't tried this recipe yet but i do have a recipe using yikes- frozen blinzes. The recipe calls for layering the frozen blinz with sour/egg mixture pour over the layers and baked.

I couldn't find curd style farmer's cheese so I grated regular farmer's cheese. That may have affected the result. I brought it to a potluck and no one liked it.

We made a double batch of this for a Temple affair, and it was definitely a great hit. The Temple Educator made one casserole, and I (Pres.) made the other. I got a little creative by adding grated lemon peel to the cheese mixture, since that's how my wife makes blintzes.

A great way to make blintzes. I thought the cheese filling was too much, maybe cut it in half next time. Definetly top it with the cinnamon and sugar, otherwise I think it would be very bland. Keep in mind blintzes is not a substitute for cheesecake, it's a dairy meal.

This was easy and tasted OK, But I like cheesecake better, so I will not make this again.

This was fast and easy to make. The only change I made was to substitute "Dry"Cottage cheese for the Farmers cheese. I just put it into the food processor for a few seconds, to make it a little creamier. I usually make my own Blintzes, but this is alot easier,and tastes almost as good.

This was a big hit in my family. I normally make my own blintzes, which is very time consuming. This took no time and everyone liked it as much, if not better. Top it with corn flake crumbs and cinnamon and sugar for added sweetness.
