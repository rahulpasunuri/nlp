haven't tried it yet - but gave 4 forks not to ruin the rating. How many days in advance could I boil the eggs and not peel them - thanks

Takes time and patients, but a must try! I added paprika before the chives and it made the eggs that much better.

I saw my grocery story carried quail eggs, and I was intrigued so I bought some. They really do taste just like chicken eggs, only they're much tinier and kind of cute! I made a mistake in this recipe and added 1 tablespoon instead of a teaspoon of mayo (opps!), but it still turned out all right. Good recipe overall!

I could only find canned quail eggs, but that said, they were wonderful, they flew off the plate. Easy to make, especially with pre-cooked canned quail eggs.
