This is an excellent, quick recipe, with no special trips to the store needed. I've made it for years, but decided to post after reading several of the really negative reviews. I usually use lime juice instead of lemon--the difference is noticable in the chicken, but not the onions. And I marinate at least an hour on each side. The posters who've said the onions make the dish are right on--the gin's botanicals are a light force on the chicken, but are really special with the onions. Tequila works too, but that's a different dish (try Chili's for tequila-lime chicken!). The temps noted in the original recipe are a bit low, but I've long known that onions won't carmelize on medium heat. I also think a little browning on the chicken helps release some of the flavors of the marinade.

I didn't have any gin so I used tequila instead and it was really good! We all enjoyed it very much.

This recipe seemed to call out for an asparagus side dish, but I made asparagus last time I entertained. For my vegetable I opted instead for a caesar salad, which I felt worked very well. Add roasted red-skin potatoes and two bottles of chardonnay and our meal was complete. I doubled the recipe with no problems. The only liberty I took was in omitting the onions which was in favor of my own and my dinner guests' preference. I got my chicken breasts from the meat counter at my local supermarket. They were enormous and stayed tender and juicy with the marinade. This recipe is a keeper.

I have been making this dish for years and it is always great. I serve it over fettucine and the kids gobble it up. Try it with chicken tenderloins for a great texture.

I made this several nights ago and this just went from a two fork to three mainly because 1) the ingredients are simple and always on hand (the Beefeaters we keep for my mother's martinis) 2) the onions made the chicken and 3) we just had the best 10 minute desperation dinner with the leftovers. Lacking time to make the dinner I had planned, I sauteed 1 red bell pepper then added 2 cloves chopped garlic, chopped fresh cilantro, the leftover sliced chicken and onions. Squeezed two limes over the whole thing and served with warmed flour tortillas, shredded cheese, salsa and sour cream: wallah...chicken fajitas! Probably some of the best fajitas I've made in awhile and with much less work than usual. I'll keep this one just for the leftover value.

The gin makes the chicken breasts more moist -- cooking low-fat can be such a dry experience, but this comes out juicy. I like to marinate all day or even overnight.

Subtle flavors. The oregano flavor was much more noticeable in the onions than on the chicken. I didn't have lemon so I used fresh lime juice. I also didn't have veg. oil and replaced it with olive oil. I let it marinate for two and a half hours. The flavor of the onions was nicer than just being carmelized.

Not great. I followed the recipe exactly and I wasn't particularly thrilled with the flavor. I marinated the chicken for 1 hour and I didn't percieve much flavor difference in the chicken breasts. There are other quick chicken breast recipes out there that are much tastier.

This dish is good but definately not a WOW kind of dish. I expected to taste the marinade in the chicken and the onions but it didn't really taste like anything other than seasoned grilled chicken with carmelized onions. (yes I used top of the line gin, I used Bombay Blue Sapphire) As other reviewers have said, the onions are delicious however, they are carmelized onions which are always delicious in my opinion. The marinade being added to them does not impart any different flavor. I will save my gin for martini's.

Marinated chicken for three hours in fridge in plastic ziplock bag. Cooked onions for about 15 minutes and followed the recipe with everything else. Served with pan-browned brussels sprouts from this site. Soooo goood!!!

I was initially skeptical of this recipe, using such a simple marinade. Where were all the delicious spices and savory yummies? In the end, the chicken turned out to be flavorful and delicious. (I marinated it for just over an hour, not the 20 minutes the recipe called for, and cooked it in a grill pan instead of over the open coals.) The big surprise, and in my opinion the star of the show, was the onions. They were mind-blowingly good with a wonderful tang. I used the regular onions, not vidalias and not the blue kind. For desert we had lemon meringue pie, which was a wonderful fit. Enjoy!

Simple and easy. I marinaded several hours using Tanqueray 10, whose botanicals add a nice touch - pretty good for drinking too. One problem, it took forever to cook the onions.

Ordinary as hell. I cut back on the oil but the onions were still greasy. Perhaps if the chicken breasts were flattened the marinade flavor would have penitrated the muscle; I marinated them for over an hour and could barely taste anything but rubber chicken. Oh well.

This is a great grilled chicken recipe! I marinated for an hour and the chicken was tender and the gin imparted a wonderful flavor.

Followed this recipe as per instructions and ingredients and it was very plain and lacked flavour. It needs garlic or some other herb/spice to liven it up, Would'nt waste my time and energy making this again.

My family loved this dish. Aside from doubling the recipe, I made it "as is." One note, it takes quite a bit longer to brown the onions than the three minutes listed.

Delicious! Try it also on Salmon Steaks and adjust the cooking time accordingly.

I also added some crushed juniper berries to the marinade to boost the flavour of the gin. Apart from that I substituted basil for the oregano as I don't really like the latter. The result: surprisingly delicious.

I hate gin. This recipe was surprisingly delicious and the aroma wonderful. I'll make it again!

I did not have gin so I substituted Lemon Vodka. The Chicken turned out great, but the onions tasted like saurkraut. I must have bought the breast of a very large Chicken so it required more than 7 minutes a side to cook. I served it with steamed Brussle Sprouts and rice.

As usual - use good alcohol. Preferably Bombay Saphire or Tanqueray. If all you have in the house is Gordon's or Beefeater - don't waste your chicken. I also added minced shallots directly to the marinade and husband loved it. Only complaint was he had one less martini in the bottle.

Excellent in every way. We ended up not grilling since it was starting to rain, but it was excellent all the same. I deglazed the pan with a little water and added this to the boiling onion mixture. It was truly delicious. Of course my kids wouldn't eat the onions, but what do they know?

This is a wonderfully easy recipe and very tasty...the chicken was tender and moist...did not do the sliced onions, though , as I did stuffed vidalia onions (recipe in Cooking Light. Also served sauteed asparagus and sugar snap peas....Great dinner

Next time I'll forget the onions. I'm an onion addict but didn't think they added much. The chicken breasts turned out really well. We have a Weber gas grill and cooked them for 7 min. on HH, turned and grilled another 3 min. on MM.

This was a really nice dish - just enough flavor and really easy. I marinated 24 hours and it came out really tender.

This dish was o.k. Certainly easy and made from things on hand. Not bad for a quick week night grill.

I thought this was OK, not great, but the four other people who ate it really liked it, so I would make it again. The chicken needed more time than the recipe says, but it was easy to make and cook.

What a delicious and easy addition to the favorites list! I used fresh oregano instead of dried and served with capers as another reviewer suggested (a nice touch), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I was tempted to add garlic but I'm glad I didn't. There was great depth of flavor without it.

Very tasty! Added some garlic and grated ginger to marinade. Used leftovers to make a salad the next day using mesclun mix, red pepper, radishes and red onion. Sliced up grilled chicken and used reduced marinade as a dressing. Yummy!
