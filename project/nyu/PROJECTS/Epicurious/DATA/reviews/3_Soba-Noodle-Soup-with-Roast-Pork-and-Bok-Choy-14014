This recipe was pretty bland - I tried adding more flavor when I reheated the leftovers, but it was still missing something. I may try tweaking it or may just opt to make this other (similar) recipe instead (I made it recently and it has MUCH more flavor - it's delicious!) http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Pork-Noodle-Soup-with-Cinnamon-and-Anise-240942

We were really disappointed with this. Like other reviewers, I agree that the broth was dull. But I didn't think that anything else in this recipe was able to make it an interesting dish. The pork was OK, but not enough to make up for the rest of the dish. I won't make again.

Absolutely perfect for cold winter day. Star anise wonderful, but I found the broth a bit too subtle and might try adding a dab of miso to bowl or sauteeing the ginger and a bit of minced scallion and garlic and simmer broth a little. Scatter cilantro &/or scallion rings on top.

Very delicious combination of flavors. Next time I might use less star anise. Didn't care for the appearance of the soba noodles in the soup and will use udon in the future. I used the Thai chicken stock (also on thissite) for the broth.

Have made this very easy and simple dish a couple of times. I like it because you can add pretty much anything you like to the soup. I add bean sprouts and a lime wedge to serve. The pork is delicious on its own. The broth is not quite seasoned enough for me, so I add a little extra soy sauce to it for the steeping phase. Delicious!

I give this recipe 4 stars because it is exceptionally easy to prepare and the flavors are fantastic. I added shitake mushrooms and red pepper and used rice noodles instead of soba. Just before serving I topped each bowl with fresh cilantro and bean sprouts. Very good.

This is a great soup - very light, yet flavorful. My only complaint is that the pork is good if brushed with the hoisin combination and then roasted, though I think it's better if the marinade is allowed to sit for several hours/overnight. I would also add, don't use a low-sodium soy sauce. I did that the first time I made it, and the broth came out a little too weak. Adding another T of regular sauce boosted the flavor right up to "superb" though.

Great flavor, ingredients, and its far less greasy than the noodle soups I've had in Chinatown.

I love this recipe. We use the hoisin marinade for chicken pork and beef. The whole thing (soup) is delish with lots of fresh thai basil, cilantro bean sprouts and thai chili's served on the side.

This is a great recipe to follow a Pork Loin Dinner. Simple. Just slice the left-over pork loin and let it sit overnight with this recipe's sauce.

Nice soup with a delicate flavor. If I make the dish again I might try a different vegetable, maybe rice noodles....

A wonderfully flavorful soup with very little prep involved. The roast pork loin is great served on its own - I also use the hoisin marinade for chicken wings.
