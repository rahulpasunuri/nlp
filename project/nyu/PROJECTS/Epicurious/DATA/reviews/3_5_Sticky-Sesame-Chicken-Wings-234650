Made this on "wing night" along with 3 other sauces (two bottled + a homemade jerk sauce). I tossed these wings with the sauce after baking, then put them back in the oven for a short time to let caramelize. This turned out well enough, but next time I will definitely add the sauce to the wings before baking (as the recipe intends), to get the sauce really nice and sticky.

This recipe is light in flavor. I took the juices from the pan, added more Hoisin & some Sriracha sauce and simmered it down to use as a dipping sauce. I also broiled the chicken in the last 5 minutes. Next time I'll try grilling on electric grill to get a crispier texture.

Tasty, easy, and definitely sticky. Double or triple the sauce and marinate overnight. The salt is unnecessary.

I made this for a party at a friends house and as it sat out on the buffet it lost the stickiness that makes it so good and turned chewy and cold. Its very good when served hot at home

based on other reviews, I made a few adjustments, but I'm a big fan of hoisin, so knew I would like them. Served as the 2nd choice with classic Frank's sauce buffalo wings. I used slightly more hoisin sauce and added black pepper paste (1-2 T) and 5-spice (1 t). For last 15 min of baking, dipped wings in more sauce and rolled in sesame seeds.

I love these and I make them all the time, but I can only give the recipe two stars because it requires so many changes to make the recipe good. These wings have to be marinated overnight in advance, and you have to baste the wings multiple times during cooking. Bake for 10 minutes, then brush with sauce and turn. Bake for 10 minutes more, then brush with sauce and turn again. Keep going like this for about an hour. In addition to the above, as mentioned by others, the sauce needs some doctoring. When I make it, I at least double the honey to make them sticky, and I also use 3-4 cloves of garlic and add about 1/3 cup of sriracha to the sauce. When you do all of this, then you end up with really outstanding sticky sesame wings. However, given that so much has to change, I have to ding the recipe by two forks.

Like many other reviewers have stated, this is so bland, and it didn't stick to the wings at all. Total waste of time and ingredients.

Rating: 2
These wings weren't very flavorful. I did did several extra things to try to enhance the flavor since many of the reviews also stated these were meh. -marinated for 24 + hours. I added white wine and subbed pineapple juice for honey - reduced the marinade to a syrup and basted the wings while in the oven. Added honey and more hoisin -broiled for the last 5 minutes Even with all the extra steps, they were only ok if they were well basted.

Loved them. Easy, tasty. No problem with flavor. Marinated for about 4 to 6 hours before grilling. Will definitely make over and over.

I was so excited to make this recipe along with the simple fried rice recipe on this website. The chicken was juicy, but there was little to no flavor from the sauce. I should have marinated the chicken as some suggested and added more honey or something to make them more sticky. I don't think I'll make this again.

These were fantastic, easy and flavorful, we gobbled them up! I did marinate the wings overnight and made an extra batch of sauce to cover them with before cooking. They were flavorful and full of sticky-sweet goodness! For those who mentioned that they stick to the foil, I sprayed my foil with Pam and they came right up. This one is definitely working into my rotation!

We did these on the grill for tailgating and they were a smash hit. Grilling allows for the fat to drain away. yummy

I thought this was quite good. I opted to use 2 chicken breasts, and marinated them overnight (as others suggested) in a bag. I also doubled the sauce and upped the cayenne for lots of kick. I baked them in the oven, covered with foil for 35 min at 425F as another poster suggested. Then I made a quick stirfry, sliced the chicken after it was cooked, and added the remaining sauce back with the veggies, and heated up till it was edible. Forgot to toast the sesame seeds, but still, it was REALLY good. Not mind-blowing, but good. I'll make it again.

Rating: 4
I've just been re-reading these reviews. Some of the criticism may owe to the fact that the chicken had not been marinated long enough. If you marinate for only one hour, they will not taste right. Make sure to marinate for at least 8 hours to make sure that the flavor comes out. I also double the sauce size to make sure that the wings are extra flavorful. If you follow these steps, you will love this recipe!

Rating: 4
Delicious, easy and quick. A winner for all types of crowds. The cayenne nicely cuts the sweetness of the hoisin and honey but use two pinches rather than one, and maybe up to a 1/2 tsp. if you want them spicy. Winner, winner chicken dinner! Fresh green onion and sesame are a must.

Delicious recipe. I used drumsticks instead of wings. My boyfriend and I loved them. The chicken was juicy and sticky. I recommend lining your pans though. The chicken was perfectly cooked, but some of the sauce burned on one of my pans and I had to throw it out because I couldn't scrub it off.

I used chicken breasts instead of chicken wings and it turned out great! I loved it, my family wasn't as impressed, but I will definately make it again for myself! The chicken was very moist but not quite as much flavor throughout as I would like, so next time I'm going to marinate the chicken in the sauce overnight.

Rating: 1
As with many, we found these bland. We got nice plump drumettes from the meat market. After following the recipe and about to turn the wings, there was so much liquid and fat, I decided to drain a bit of it first. For the final leg of cooking, because there wasn't as much liquid, some of them stuck to the foil. These browned more then the others, but neither had much flavour. My feeling is that all of the good stuff we put on the wings ended up in the pan. We will pass on these in future.

Not sure why this has received so many negative reviews-this dish is outstanding! I made it for the first time for a party and the dish almost didn't make it to the guests-I just kept on snacking and snacking. My guests also agreed-the dish was the hit of the party. It is a tad sweet but otherwise, very full of flavor in my opinion. Definitely a crowd-pleaser!

I don't understand why people like this recipe. It was totally bland, not enough sauce, and did not get crispy and sticky. I tried increasing the honey and the hot pepper. I also put it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up, but it was still tastless.

These were good but not outstanding. Maybe a touch oily and lacking in full flavours. Next time I would put less sesame oil and more soy - and/or more honey. I marinated them for an hour first in a ziploc with half the sauce,s&p, baked for 15 mins, turned, drizzled the rest of the sauce, baked 15 mins, turned and baked a final 10 mins on lower heat.

The best wing recipe ever came from Gourmet Magazine in its 1976 bicentennial issue. It's worth looking up. It's called "Spicy Wings."

This is what our kids ADORE!!!!! Akin to those alleged "bourbon chicken" samples we all get in the mall-food-court - this has the right mix of savory and sweet and it's not so salty that you end up with mall food court heartburn.I upped the garlic cloves by a couple. It should be renamed - Favorite Mall Chicken But Better. Would work nicely on a charcoal grill but in the oven, will be just what the ref ordered for SuperBowl munching. Be sure to have plenty o'WetNaps handy. I used thighs and if using anything but wingettes, cook it longer - a little crunchy burn on that sweetness wouldn't hurt.

Rating: 2
I was really surprised at the lack of flavor these wings had after so many good reviews. We made the wings exactly as the recipe called for and it was pretty bland. A squeeze of lime juice helped the flavor a bit but next time I would either a) add some citrus juice and maybe orange rind, add ginger, and salt and pepper the wings before coating with the sauce or, more likely, b) find another recipe. Also we had to put under the broiler for 2-3 minutes per side to crisp up after cooking.

I like this recipe. BF loves it. (A little too sweet for me). I doubled the sauce (I prefer a light glaze but this was a treat for the BF so...) Baked s&p'ed wings for 15min. Flipped wings. Baked another 10min. Coated in sauce. Baked 10min. Coated in remainder of sauce. Baked 10-15min more with the oven jacked up 25 degrees to set the sauce. A little salty, but that may have come from doubling the sauce. Served with egg drop soup (Gourmet Feb 02) and a leftover sesame noodle-improv. Easy & tasty.

I made this for my boyfriend and his roommate and they LOVED it! I made a few modifications, I added sweet chili sauce and ginger.

I've made this recipe 3 times now, and they get better each time. I brown them a bit in a skillet before tossing them in the sauce. I also add extra chili oil and honey for the perfect sweet/spicy blend. Halfway through the baking, I turn and re-baste them and they come out with perfectly flavored, crisp skin. I'll try the ginger addition next time.

I have not used Epicurious before, but with times so tight, I thought I would give it a try. I love sesame chicken but take-out can be expensive. My husband said"This is better than our favorite resturant! Please make it again real soon." I have a feeling we will be fighting over leftovers. A little to salty so I will cut back next time but I will make it again soon. thank-you!

Marinade usually means leave it in a marinade for a while and I was wondering why the recipe didn't suggest you do this. I tried the bake it for 35min, then take it out and toss it in the sauce and then put it back in technique as some suggested to get crispy skin. The surface skin tasted good but the meat was bland. I think next time I'll try to marinade it overnight in the sauce, then baste it with the sauce while it cooks. To get crispy skin, fire up the broiler mode for 3 min or so and the skin will crip up nicely. At least it's better tasting than the honey soy glaze wings on this site.

this turned out great after a few modifications: 1. added ginger and sriracha sauce to the marinade/sauce. 2. season the chicken with salt and pepper. 3. bake the chicken for 25 minutes, toss it in the marinade, bake for another five minutes, baste, and bake for another three minutes. i think next time i will modify this just a little bit more -- i will take out the final step of baking for three minutes. the sauce dried up a little bit, so next time i will make basting the final step, so that the chicken will have a thicker, sticky sauce. also, i'll probably make more marinade next time, maybe 30% - 50% more.

Rating: 4
Oh, and I actually made the sauce right in the shallow pan I was going to cook them in, didn't marinade at all, just dumped in the wings, tossed them around and baked at 425 for 30 or so mins, turning once. It really gave the sauce time to thicken and get sticky.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I added ginger and extra garlic and a couple spoonfuls of hot chili paste to the marinade. I baked the wings at 425 for 20 minutes before tossing in the marinade, baked for another five minutes, basted them and went another couple of minutes. Topped with the toasted sesame seeds. My family really liked them, and they were perfect for the superbowl.

This was excellent. Having read through the reviews, I made a few alterations as well. I put fresh ginger into the marinade as well as some freshly ground white pepper. I baked the wings for 20 minutes and then tossed it in the marinade and put them back in the oven and basted them once. They turned out really well. I'd definitely make these again!

After noting the modifications of the previous reviewers, the wings were awesome! In summary, here's what I changed: - Sauteed the wings briefly - Put them in a high oven (425) for 25 min - added more honey, garlic, ginger and a mild red chili sauce to the marinade - rolled the wings around the sauce and returned to the oven and finished cooking ** The honey did burn a little so I turned the oven way down, to 325 , so that they finished cooking. Admittedly, the red chili paste and the extra honey made the dish.

Rating: 2
These turned out ok- the skin was a little heavy and the flavor was a little lacking, despite the great marinade/sauce. After 20 minutes in the oven, the wings weren't really browning, so I increased the temp. to 450 and that helped them brown and get sticky. You could also probably broil them at the end for the same effect. As for upping the flavor, I'd add some chili flakes, chili garlic sauce, extra salt, and maybe some balsamic or red wine winegar. I might also add some ketchup or black bean sauce. Will review again with experiment results.

These wings were the most popular dish on the buffet table at a potluck. I used a couple of the suggestions, and added a good amount of fresh ginger when pasting the garlic.

These were pretty good. For those who complained about them being crispy, Asian style wings like this usually are not crispy. It's not meant to be like honey barbeque wings. That said, they went over well for my dinner party but I will most likely tweak the recipe if I make them again. Maybe some ginger will make them better.

We literally just finished eating these wings and I'm so thrilled b/ they came out fantastic. As advised by another two users (by the way...Thx), I fried the wings just a bit first and added about 3 tablespoons of mixture while frying and then I roasted in oven (adding remaining mixture to wings) for about 25min, turning then over every once in a while. I also doubled the honey & added red crushed pepper, they came out so tasty and sticky, my husband and father in law loved them. I can't wait to try then again...

I made these with the original recipe and found them to be, as another reviewer so aptly put it, "flabby". So the second time around I followed their advice, high-heat cooked them first to get that nice crispy skin, and then tossed them in the sauce. I then returned them to the high heat oven and cooked them for an additional 10 minutes to get a really nice glaze. Result - absolutely wonderful wings! I also used chipotle chile powder (1/2 tsp) and doubled the honey. So, as the recipe is written, no I would not make these again. As suggested here, definately on the list. Enjoy!

Rating: 1
I followed the recipe exactly but I should have trusted my instincts. The chicken was greasy and flabby and sauce had no flavor. I will make this recipe again, but I will use my usual wing technique. I will cook the wings at a high heat until the the fat has rendered and the skin is crispy. Then I will toss them in the sauce that has been kicked up with more heat and more sweet. And then toss with the sesame and scallions. Perhaps I'll simmer the sauce before hand just to get rid of any raw garlic taste. I made them with Rachael Ray's Hot and Cold Sesame Noodles which were really delish. If the wings were good it would have been a perfect dinner.

Rather than chicken, I made this recipe with thick pork chops and it was fantastic! I quickly seared the chops over high heat, then transferred to a baking dish. I doubled the sauce ingredients and added 1 tbsp. onion powder, then heated to simmering before pouring over the chops. Baked uncovered at 350 to internal temp of 145 degrees on an instant read thermometer, garnished with green onions and sesame seeds. Truly delicious...chops were tender and very juicy and the sauce was great over steamed rice. Quick and easy, but, oh, so very yummy!

I took the advice of others and decided to spice this recipe up a bit -- but I ended up adding just a lil too much cayenne. Overall, this is a quick and easy recipe. I made it with chicken thighs. I added some chili garlic sauce. The chicken is surprisingly very flavorful even though I didn't marinate it. That in and of itself makes this recipe worth it. Experiment with it and enjoy! And yes, it's not sticky but to make it sticky, add honey at the end and then top with sesame seeds.

Unlike the lukewarm review of others on this list, my family loved this recipe! Based on the comment that the sauce didn't stick, I made sure to pat my chicken very dry before putting the sauce on, which worked quite well.

I found it very quick and easy to make and the end result was extremely yummy. I will definitely be making these again!

This smelled delicious while it was in the oven, but that aroma didn't translate into big flavor. Also, during cooking, the sauce wasn't sticking very well to the wings, so when I turned them over halfway through cooking, I made sure that I swirled each one in the reduced and thickened sauce pooled on the bottom of the pan.

Sticky they are - although they didn't stick around very long! I forgot to add the cayenne (oops) and they were still great. The pepper would have made them awesome. I started to panic about a lack of browning 20 minutes into the cook time, but in the last 7 minutes they came together. Even non-stick foil could have used some spray for easier release so be sure to use foil or you may be tossing your sheet pan!
