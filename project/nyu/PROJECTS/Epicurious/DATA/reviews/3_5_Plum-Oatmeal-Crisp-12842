Loved this. Used a little over a lb. of nectarines, as there were lots and needed to use them. The walnuts gave the topping a delightful crunch. Would work for any fruit. More ginger next time, since I didn't detect it at all in the topping.

Sour! needed far more sugar. In general this was adequate, but not terribly exciting.

When I first pulled it out of the oven I wasn't sure if it had actually turned crisp, but after a few minutes it was clear that it had a nice crispness to it. By the way, I put it over a base of mashed sweet potatoes instead of plums. This is worth making at least once. I think I like it best as a breakfast item.

Made this with 9 plums and meusli for the topping. Absolutely delicious, and easy to prepare. Will certainly become a favorite!

I made this last night. I doubled the fruit amount as suggested and used peaches and apricots since that is what I had around. I also substituted granola for the oatmeal which gave it a nice texture. Great dessert, easy to make, and not overly sweet.

Loved the topping, so crispy! Any fruit can be substituted in this recipe!

Based on the reviews before I tripled the plum quantity, using almost two pounds. It turned out wonderfully with just the right balance of fruit and crisp. I will definitely be making this again.

As a vegan, I substitute the eggs and butter for their dairy-free counterparts (Ener-G egg replacer and Earth balance margarine) and this dish still turns out divine! Double the recipe, or at the very least, the fruit. Also, I've mixed and matched different fruits depending on the season: plums, or peaches and blueberries in the summer; apples and cranberries in the fall/winter. Everyone raves about this dessert!

Perhaps they used HUGE plums. 3 plums seems very little, compared to the size of peaches in such a recipe. I can't wait to try it!

There's something wrong with the proportions of this recipe. It makes at least twice as much topping as you need. I might try it again, doubling the amount of plums, but keeping the topping recipe unchanged.

This was a great crisp. I substituted peaches and blackberries for the plums. I was worried that the ginger would not be appropriate, but the ginger just added a nice flavor and was not overwhelming. My family enjoyed it too. Best of all it was a snap to put together.
