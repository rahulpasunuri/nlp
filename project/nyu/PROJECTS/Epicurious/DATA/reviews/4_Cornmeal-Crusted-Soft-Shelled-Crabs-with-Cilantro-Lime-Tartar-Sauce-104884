No need to deep fry...just pan fry and they are perfect. Don;t change anything else...

We love SSC many different ways, but this recipe is far and away the best. Not too much work, but great taste, especially the tartar sauce. If there is a better SSC recipe out there, please let me know.

Yumm! This turned out so well! Everything soft-shelled crab should be.

This is the best soft-shell crab recipe I have ever made! Be sure to get really fresh, still alive crabs. Also did clams and oysters with equally delicious results (frying temp. should be a little lower for clams and oysters). Could not find the self- rising flour - Cook's note version was just fine. The only variation I did was in the tartar sauce - sweet relish instead of dill pickles and vadalia onion instead of red onion.

the coating was excellent. I made it with giant prawns and left the shell on the tail intact. We didn't even bother spitting out the shells. Next time I'm going to leave all the prawn shells because they were so nice and crispy.

Have tried many approaches to SSC but this one is a winner. The breading is not heavy and the cornmeal crust is crunchy. Take care that the oil is the right temp. Don't buy dead crabs.

I was so disappointed in this recipe, especially after reading all of the fabulous reviews. I am a soft shell crab lover, and have made them several times. I feel like this recipe did not do them justice!! The cornmeal breading really took away from the flavor of the crab, and I didn't care for the tartar sauce either. What a shame!

I'd never made soft-shell crab before, some friends got them and asked me if I knew what to do with them. Found this recipe, and it is excellent. Definitely have the market clean the crabs for you. Also, no need to use so much oil, I used almost a couple of pints. The cilantro-lime tartar sauce is excellent. Be sure to use extra lime juice in that recipe if you use store-bought mayo.

I tried this recipe in the spring when it was in Gourmet. It was wonderful! Today I watched Michael cook it on Epicurious TV. I think this method would be great for frying jumbo shrimp as well! Can't wait to try it! Yum! the tartar sauce is wonderful!

added southwestern seasonings to the cornmeal, best seller of the night

Very good. Don't think you need to deep fry,pan saute in olive oil would probably have worked just as well. Cayenne gives it a nice touch. Didn't make sauce, good just as it is.

When softshells are in season, I search for recipies....search no more- this is excellent! The cilantro lime tartar sauce is wonderful with other seafood and fish dishes as well. Print this one - it's a keeper!

This recipe is quite simple and excellent! I recommend having your fish market clean the crabs for you when you buy them....It's a little 'ew' and they mvoe alot! In addition to the tartar sauce, I made a herb and garlic butter 'dip' as well. It's just sooooooooo good! As a matter of fact, I'm making them again tonight for a group of friends. Can't wait! MMmmmmmMmmMMMmm!
