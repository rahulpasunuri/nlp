I made this last night, pretty much as written, except I used breadcrumbs that were not sourdough (whatever fresh bread crumbs I had in the freezer). I thought it was great. My husband thought it was good, but I could tell he wasn't completely sold. He said it needed more cheese or liquid or something. Lol - I told him it had plenty of cheese already. I guess he thought it should be saucier? Anyway, we reheated it tonight (in an oven), and it was much better. He raved and raved about it. I think it definitely improves as it sits, as long as you reheat it properly. It's definitely going into the regular rotation. By the way, I liked the cumin seeds. They are definitely noticeable. If you like cumin, add them. If you don't, don't! :)

I'm disappointed to see that most reviewers choice to omit the cumin seeds. I thought they were delicious and made this dish not your average mac and cheese. I really suggest trying it. Would definitely make again.

Made this recipe and got rave reviews, I left off the cumin seeds on top but other than that followed it. I want to make this again.

I'm going to buck the trend here and say this this was just so-so. It was a ton of work and because it came out a little dry, it ended up less like mac n cheese and more like a casserole. I wanted to be wowed but wasn't.

Excellent, but very heavy.

Fabulous! Used an aged Gouda, and Fontina in place of the Edam. Will try the cheddar addition for sure. Rainbow Chard gave it nice color. Halved the recipe, cooked in a 8x8 glass dish for about 25 minutes

I have mad this recipe three times now. I think it is quite delicious and I recommend making it just as described. Making the breadcrumbs as the recipe says is wonderfully tasty! I didn't do it the second time I made it because I was out of bread, so I used panko instead. It was still good but not as.

So I have now made this dozens of times, at first as the recipe calls and it is amazing. But I thought I would share my tips in making this recipe healthier, but still yummy. I use whole wheat pasta, spelt flour (instead of white), olive oil (rather an butter). I usually don't do the crust because of lack of time - but also because I find it microwaves much better the next day without it. Also makes it a little healthier.

Delicious! Big hit with my boyfriend who had requested mac n cheese for his birthday dinner. I did everything according to the recipe with the following changes: - left out the optional cumin seeds - used a bunch of kinds of cheeses (and didn't matter which kind went in which later). Used aged gouda and gruyere and some cheese the woman at the cheese store said was good :) tasted perfect I even made the sourdough breadcrumbs from scratch! It was easy with a food processor. Next time I might toast the sourdough bread for like 3 minutes to dry it out before turning it into bread crumbs. Relly delicious! Highly recommended.

Wow, this is a fabulous Mac N Cheese recipe! I made only a couple of very small changes - used Cheddar, Edam, and Gruyere cheses, and I think you need more than the 1/2 c. the recipe reserves for sprinkling on top at the end. I omitted the cumin seeds too. It was amazing and everyone loved it! It's my go-to mac n cheese recipe now.

YUMMY! My family ate this up! We made it with a lot more garlic - about 6 cloves and couldn't get Edam cheese so substituted some goat cheese and sharp cheddar. Also substituted multi-grain penne pasta for elbows and brocoli for chard. Follow the bread crumb topping as described if you can - it is awesome!

Made a half batch tonight as a test run for a Thanksgiving side. As suggested by other reviewers, I added some sharp cheddar to the mix, and slightly increased amounts of the other cheeses too. I sprinkled cumin seeds on only half the pan, as Mr H wasn't giving them a slobbering thumbs-up as it was about to go in the oven. And I used half panko, half sourdough crumbs. AWESOMMMMMEEE... Mr H's eyes were rolling back in his head in cheesed-up ecstacy. This recipe has annual holiday tradition potential for sure (and only so infrequently lest we become spherical). I'll prolly skip the cumin seeds altogether going forward, though.

All these reviews were outstanding, love this web site. Definitely a four forker. (if that's a word)

This tasted great, but was way too greasy. I didn't use the green stuff, so maybe that would make a difference, esp. if there were a layer of the greens on the bottom. I think I would make the bechamel next time with cornflour instead of the butter/flour mixture and do the onions and garlic with a tiny amt of fat. I will also use skim milk. It was nice, and good cold, too, but for me, not the "ultimate."

Rating: 4
This is the texture I've been looking for! Made this ALMOST exactly as written...used broccoli because I love broccoli in my mac and cheese...and...I'm always surprised when m&c recipies don't include just a tablespoon of whole grain mustard...it adds so much, so I added that. It was excellent!

Rating: 4
ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!! Used smoked gouda and emanthaler, added a couple of mushrooms and a jalepeno to the saute because I wanted to use them up. Increased the cumin seeds because I like the flavor and added some paprika for color!! A definite keeper.

Rating: 4
Delicious recipe! I made a few changes though...Kept the same amount of cheese but used gouda, fontina and sharp cheddar. I pretty much tripled the garlic, used kale instead of chard (cause that's what I had on hand) and added cooked bacon crumbs over the layer of kale. Instead of sourdough b.c's I mixed panko with whole wheat bread that I cut into cubes. I drizzled this with the butter, added pepper and sharp cheddar cheese, then sprinkled this mixture over noodles. Yumma!!

I have been searching for the ultimate mac and cheese recipe, and I think I found it! I made this recipe with a few modifications, however: 1. I used 2 1/2 C gruyere, 2 C gouda, and 1 C cheddar. 2. I used 16 oz of pasta instead of 14. 3. I didn't include any greens. I split the recipe into two 9-inch square pans and a single pan baked in 35 minutes. I can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow!

My mother used to make this mac and cheese on Friday nights (Catholic). She always put a thick topping of bread crumbs, and would dot the top with tomatoes that would come out like roasted tomatoes. I searched and made this, used 2 cups of bread crumbs, and used Fontina and old cheddar cheese. It was a hit...went into our famous recipe binder as a keeper.

Rating: 4
YUM! This was the first time I made from-scratch mac 'n' cheese, and it was awesome. I used a combo of Edam, Gouda and sharp cheddar. I was glad I threw in the cheddar - the boyfriend complimented the balance of flavors, and I think w/o the cheddar it would have been a little too bland for me. I will say it took a good 2 1/2 hours including prep work, so be smart and grate your cheese ahead of time. Super good recipe.

Rating: 0
Absolutely delicious but, I'm not going to rate this recipe because I made quite a few changes. I replaced the gouda with Gruyere and the edam with emmanthaler and added a few splashes of beer (raspberry ale) to mellow the sharpness of the cheese. I also added about a 1/4 cup chopped salami to the chard. Otherwise recipe was followed as published.

I am not sure what all the great ratings are about, this is not one of the best recipes I've had. The cumin seeds were a great addition, but overall I found the recipe lacking in flavor. The cheese called for in the recipe is delicious, yet it just melted away to next to nothing. The Mac & Cheese was also a bit dry with the amount of bread crumbs that it called for. Honestly, I'd rather doctor up some Annie's than spend the time (1.5 hours or so) making this lackluster dish. Good, but not great. I'd look for another recipe before I would make it again. Does anyone else feel like epicurious is getting diluted? When I first found it (years and years ago and hardcopy bon apetit before that), I felt like you could make anything on it and have great success. Now, I feel like you have to pay close attention to the ratings, and even then you can go astray. I was really happy to find the "best of epicurious", but was rather disappointed with this recipe. Hopefully it was just a fluke.

This was the best macaroni and cheese I've ever made (and I've been cooking for 50 years)! I didn't have Edam cheese, so I switched to Gruyere, and I used panko breadcrumbs as that was what was on hand, and I also sliced the center ribs of the Swiss chard thinly and cooked them in the water first for two minutes before I added the leaves of chard, as I wanted to retain the most nutrients (and not waste), but these were minor adjustments and did not really detract from the wonderful taste of this dish.I did change the water for the pasta, though, as the ribs left the water red, and I didn't want that color in the pasta. I didn't add the cumin, either. My husband and I have been eating this for days, as it made a lot, but we're not complaining. Thanks for an excellent recipe.

I really like this recipe & is a hit with my kids. I don't keep the required cheese in the house, so I've used old cheddar instead. The first time I made it with the chard and the 2nd with callards (that is what was in the fridge) and I liked both options. The nice thing about this recipe is that the greens take on the flavor of the dish, which is key to feeding preschoolers (and husbands!). The second time I made it with the crust (didn't have time the first time) and it was excellent. Will double this next time as super yummy. Used whole wheat pasta and tasted just fine. Lots left over for dinner the next night :)

This was fairly easy and delicious. I altered the recipe since I didn't have all the ingredients. I used cheddar cheese and queso blanco. I also added shallot (per other recommendations here), and I added another 1/8 teaspoon or so of cayenne pepper to give it more kick. I also didn't have breadcrumbs, so I sprinkled crushed caesar salad croutons on top.

Rating: 4
This is a really simple and very good recipe, although I I didn't follow it to a T. I had some leftover cheese from a recent picnic that I wanted to use up: havarti, sharp cheddar, and edam cheese. So I used them up in this recipe, substituted chard with kale, and it turned out fantastic! The chard rally cut the typical richness of mac-n-cheese, so it actually felt like I was eating something 'healthy." :) I would definitely recommend and will for sure make this again.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! Made it over the weekend on a cold New England winter night. Next time I think I'll add in some tangier cheese or a shallot as this was a teenie bit bland for my tastes, but overall a great and relatively simple dish to prepare.

I would like to give this recipe 3 1/2 forks if possible. I made this with a combination of red wax gouda, 1 1/2 cup gruyere, and 1/2 cup 3yr white cheddar and then 1 large shallot (I discovered I was out of onions!). I will definitely make it again (my husband loves cheese), though I think I'll be sure to add the correct amount of onion and perhaps switch out the gouda (nice, but I find it boring personally) for something else. The chard was a nice addition. I noticed someone else said they added a small amount of bacon, and I imagine that was heavenly - I'll try that, too. I would do the cheese prep work ahead of time, as it did take quite a while to grate all that cheese (esp if you have limited work space)! I found the balance of sauce to pasta quite good. Nice dish.

My sis and I made this dish to accompany our Thanksgiving feast. It was delicious and the ultimate comfort food. We couldn't find cumin seed but didn't miss it. We made this the night before and simply reheated on 250 for 20 minutes prior to serving.

Holy smokes. Amazing. Used rice pasta and whole milk, but otherwise followed the recipe. So good.

Very good - I made a few modifications. I lightened it up by using a little under 5 oz of gouda cheese and about 4- oz of gruyere cheese. I also used skim milk, as opposed to 2%. Instead of chard, I made a mixture of porcini and crimini mushrooms. It was great! Everyone loved it. I'd try putting a little truffle oil in the bread crumb topping next time.

Rating: 4
This is an awesome mac and cheese - very classy. I added fried mushrooms to the sauce which worked well. I agree with other reviewers that it needs more sauce (but not necessarily more cheese), so I will probably add more milk and flour next time.

this is the best mac and cheese! I use laccinato kale in place of chard.

Made this for a dinner party last night and everyone loved it! I'd definitely make it again. I couldn't find swiss chard so substituted a head of bokchoy (keeping the stems like others suggested). I also couldn't find sour dough bread so used a french baguette, and then had no idea how to make homemade bread crumbs, so decided to toast the bread and cut it into 1/4 inch pieces - worked well! I substituted wholewheat penne for the macaroni, and added some smoked Gouda in addition to the regular Gouda. I included the cumin seeds on top and definitely think it adds a nice touch. I was using a convection oven and found it was ready after only 30 minutes. Yum!

I agree... leave the chard, take the canoles. Otherwise, an excellent dish!

Really, how can you go wrong with homemade macaroni and cheese? It was delicious. But the addition of the Swiss chard seems like a waste of good Swiss chard unless you're trying to sneak some greens into your family without them balking. For me, the chard just gets lost in all the pasta cheesiness of this dish. If you want to reduce the fat, this recipe really doesn't need this much butter and cheese to make it good.

DELICIOUS!!! made it just as is and everyone loved it! The Swiss chard is a nice surprise, the cheese mix is wonderful and the crunchy topping is the perfect finishing touch. Pretty easy to make too!

I had to improvise at bit with what I had in the pantry... I used aged Gouda and Gruyère and omitted the nutmeg. For the topping I used panko and instead of melted butter I used a truffle infused olive oil. Kids and adults enjoyed!

My family and I loved the recipe. It was really great. I accidentally added a 1/2 tsp. of cayenne instead of a 1/4 so do that if you like your food a little spicier. I also used orange cheddar instead of Edam. We used the Swiss Chard stems to to add crunchieness. We also didn't finely grate the gouda but we coarsly grate it.

Rating: 4
Though this is rather involved for mac and cheese, the end result is certainly worth the effort! I did not discard the chard stems, and thought that it added nice substance to the dish. I think you could substitute any full flavored cheeses based on your budget - but the gouda and edam are really delicious.

Rating: 1
I used the cheeses I had on hand, which was Gruyere, Fontina, and mozzarella. I was not impressed, which was disappointing considering how good the other reviews were. Myabe my replacement cheeses were the problem? However, i will use the same bread topping on my other mac and cheese recipe.

Yummy! Healthier mac and cheese that the kids loved. We'll definitely be saving this recipe.

So good! I used gouda, havarti, and some regular monterey jack to keep the cheese cost down. For the topping, I used whole wheat bread and added bacon bits (I cooked 4 slices). I thought that 1.5 pounds of chard was a bit much; I bought two bunches but one would have been enough. Also didn't use cumin, but added some extra cayenne instead.

My niece made this delicious Mac and Cheese for Christmas dinner and it was fabulous!!!! It was unfortunate that I had the flu and did not have any appetite to eat. I was a little apprehensive when I first found out that the recipe included Swiss chard, but to my surprise the marriage was there. Dawn also added White Wisconsin Cheddar and it turned out soooo creamy and wished there was more that I could take home. Great job Dawn!!!! I will be making this dish once again.

This was so delicious! Definitely glad I spent the extra money and time tracking down the aged gouda and edam. The cheese made it pricey but the results were so satisfying that I look forward to making this again and again. Cumin seeds added a nice extra something...

This was really very good! I wasn't sure that I wanted to take the time to do the chard part, as I have never had anything else mixed in with mac and cheese, but it was a really nice addition and made it more sophisticated. Same with the bread crumb topping - absolutely worth the couple extra minutes to do it. My husband deemed it "restaurant-quality mac and cheese" and I will certainly make it again...and again.

I couldn't find Edam so used Emmentaler instead. I also used rainbow chard as I had some I wanted to use up. This was my first time making homemade mac and cheese but it was fantastic. The consistency was great, the flavors were wonderful (although the cayenne was a tad too spicy for my husband) and the chard was a nice addition.

This is a very good dish. The texture was just right, nice and creamy. We have a bumper crop of rainbow swiss chard right now, and this is a great way to use it. I used Emmenthal and Gruyere for the cheeses, and no cumin. I will certainly make this again.

Best macaroni I have ever had! I made it exactly as recipe stated. Highly recommend using smoked gouda, instead of regular, which other reviewers said they did. The smokiness pairs beautifully with the cumin seeds and chard. I thought consistency of sauce was perfect (not too slimy not too thin) as was the pasta to sauce ratio.

Rating: 4
Definitely my mac and cheese recipe from now on. The flavor in this is so good. I will increase the cheese sauce to macaroni ratio (my box was a little bigger than recommended) next time because you definitely want more rather than less when it tastes this good. I'll also use more chard next time - it tastes lovely so why not have enough for every bite?! A great way to make a healthy mac and cheese too because it uses actual cheese!

Made it for a pot luck lunch at work, every one wanted the recipe. It is rich and certainly not your regular Mac and Cheese. When I sauteed the onion I added red pepper flakes, to give it an added "bite", and I increased the Swiss Chard volume. It is a keeper for pot luck situation sine it is a comfort food, and a non meat dish which is appreciated at such gatherings. (It helps to grate the cheese a few days in advance, will cut down the prep time)

Great way to make mac n cheese more healthy. I like a creamier dish, so when I found the bechamel to be on the thick side, I added more milk until I got the consistency I wanted. I also don't bake for the full time, more like 25 minutes (plus it gets to the table faster.) Any good melting cheeses will work; I particularly liked a combination of Gruyere, Emmentaler, and white cheddar. Another good substitute is spinach for chard.

Rating: 4
We made this with kale from our garden instead of chard, and because Trader Joes didn't have any Edam I made this with a combonation of Gouda, Fontina, and Gruyere. I loved how the kale got all salty and delicious from the cheese. When I poured this into the baking dish I thought it would be too saucy, but it soaked up a lot. When I make this again I'll make slightly more sauce. This is one of my favorite mac n' cheese recipes.

I made this for a fried chicken dinner party, and it received great reviews. However, I thought it was a tad too dry. Making more bechamel might help make it creamier. Loved the swiss chard and the sourdough breadcrumbs!

I made this with rainbow chard instead of Swiss chard and panko crumbs instead of sourdough. It was pretty good both with and without the shard, but the shard gave it a distinctive flavor. I did not enjoy shredding all that cheese by hand.
