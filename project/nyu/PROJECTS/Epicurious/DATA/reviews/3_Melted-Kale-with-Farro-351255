I added some red chili flakes, steamed chopped kale, and pomegranate seeds. Gives it a nice kick, and some color.

This is a good basic recipe, but it is completely bland. Even with 2 extra garlic cloves it still was bland, and looked unappetizing. Very easy to turn it into a a four fork dish by adding flavor after it is cooked as described. To the recipe as described, I sauted 4 crushed cloves of garlic in olive oil. I added 12 oz. of crushed or diced tomatoes and returned the completed dish to the pot. I then added 3/4 cup of crumbled chevre goat cheese, more salt and pepper and some truffle salt. Now it deserves four forks. If I had shitake or porcini mushrooms, it wouldve been even better!

A little jalapeno added really helped this recipe . I did like the texture of the puree.

Like others who've reviewed, I made this in effort to use the beautiful bunch of kale in our CSA box. The recipe did not disappoint. What a creative way to eat your greens! There were plenty of leftovers; so for dinner the next night, I added cumin, oregano, lemon juice and fresh cilantro and served alongside fajitas.

This recipe deserves better than 2.5 forks. It's really quite good--we've made it half a dozen times and enjoy it a great deal. The only change we make is that we don't "melt" the kale. Rather than blending it to mush, we simply chop it. It makes a much nicer presentation. Yummy!

I realize I shouldn't review a recipe when I've made changes, but... I used pearled barley rather than farro. I used homemade corn broth for the vegetable stock. The result was really, really bland. I tried more and more salt (in a small sample) until it got too salty, that didn't help either. It didn't completely suck, but was a waste of my lovely corn stock, which I should have saved for corn-crab chowder as was my original intent.

I really liked this dish. I used vegetable stock from the store so it was salty enough and Israeli couscous rather than Farro. I also boiled the couscous in vegetable stock rather than water.

i love farro, i love kale, and i even love dan barber, but we thought this dish lacked something. it was bland. maybe it was because we used homemade vegetable broth that was not salted, although we did salt the dish itself. if i were to make this again, i might try, e.g., adding a ton of garlic.

It was okay. I ended up stirring some feta in at the end to give it some more flavour. My husband and I ate it happily but I was very glad I didn't company over as it would have been a rather embarrassing green mess to serve to anyone!

Great taste, but less than appetizing appearance. Served with grilled salmon and it really made for a nice meal.
