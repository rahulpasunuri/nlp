I followed recipe closely except that I forgot the vanilla, used all the zest from one lemon and used a 8 1/4 inch spring form pan not a tart pan. I trimmed the pie crust before baking so that it was only 1 inch (or less) high at the rim. It was delicious: a little bit tart and not too sweet!! Served 4 of us with two ample slices left over. I also served it with a blackberry coulis also not too sweet. YUM. will do this again and maybe try strawbs or raspbs.

This was my first tart and it was a knockout. Kiwi is so beautiful as the main event with this dish. My tart dish was slightly bigger than the crust but it made for a thin crust that was well liked. I will definitely make this again and will share with others. I can't wait to experiment with other sliced fruits.

Ease of preparation is what makes this a winner. I made it just like the recipe, except used lime zest instead of lemon, and everyone agreed the lime made it special. Works better with the kiwi, I think. There are fancier, more flavorful tarts out there, but this is a nice, light, fuss-free dessert. I do think it tastes better after an afternoon of chilling.

I used this recipe for a Passover dessert last year. I substituted the pie crust for a matzah cracker that had been soaked. I lined the pie plate with a couple of the crackers, baked it for a bit and when it cooled, filled the torte. It was delicious!

No baking required, which makes it fast and easy, but nothing very exciting about the recipe

I have made this a couple of times with a graham cracker crust and it is really nice and refreshing. Not to mention very easy to put together.

I love this, but the proportions seem wrong to me -- I use 24 oz of cream cheese and one of the extra-large redi-made pie crusts, or 16 oz with a normal one.

I made this as a Passover dessert. I used matzah as the crust and topped it with both kiwis and bananas. It was delicious! A huge hit!

The other cook was right about the kiwi, its taste disappears into the filling. It would be great with berries. Very simple to make, nice presentation.

I make something called fruit pizza. You use a very large pizza sized sugar cookie, cover it with cream cheese mixed with a little honey, and then top with fruit you like, that does not brown. You may then glaze with apricot jam. Very fun for children to make!

One of my summer staples (when I was living further south, where mangoes didn't cost more than my mortgage) is a version of this tart using mangoes, kiwis, and the tart shell from the "LEMON-CURD STRAWBERRY TART" recipe. I think a shortbread-style crust is a better match to the cream cheese base than a standard pie crust. I also add an apricot jam glaze for a bit of shine.

This is an easy and fun dessert to make. I've made it with blackberries instead of the kiwi as well as rasberries. It makes a nice presentation and take along for get togethers.

This recipe was just ok. I love cream cheese filling and I love kiwi - however put together they just seem to take away from each other, instead of complement each other. We ended up picking the kiwis off and eating them and then just eating the rest of the tart.

This met all of my criteria - easy, pretty, yummy and somewhat healthy. I was leary (sp) of using a premade crust but only out of guilt not taste. The filling was fabulous and refreshing. I used 4 kiwis to really cover it. Also just sprayed a tart pan instead of a spring release pan and it was just fine.
