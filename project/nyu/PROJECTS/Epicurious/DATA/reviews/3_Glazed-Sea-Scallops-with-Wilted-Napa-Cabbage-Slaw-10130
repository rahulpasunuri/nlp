No one really cared for the slaw but everyone agreed the scallops had good flavor.

A really lovely, easy recipe! I do not have access to Napa cabbage & so substituted baby bok choy and shiitake mushrooms - delicious! Also added garlic for a bit of a kick and added spicy garlic chilli paste. Will make this one over and over again.

I made the glazed scallops for a dinner with my parents. I am glad to report that we liked the end result; however, the dish served first underwent some doctoring. Like kamccoy from Yuba City, I used rice vinegar instead of wine vinegar - it's just a personal preference. I found that the glaze sans the sesame oil was a little sweeter than with the oil. Also, the glaze broke down rather than reducing, so I added some water, corn starch, and butter to make a sauce to drizzle over the scallops. My parents and I liked this version well enough. Oh, we did without the slaw, too.

The dish I made was more like a 2.5, but I think that was my error. It was really wet - maybe my cabbage was too fresh? Also, the separation when making the glaze made me think there's just way too much oil in the dressing. I don't think you need that much oil. Next time I'm definitely doing the rice wine vinegar - can't really understand why you'd use white wine vinegar in it. Oh, and add some toasted sesame seeds over the whole thing - if you have them, it would be great!

This was easy and quick! I substituted rice vinegar, and I added a julienned bell pepper as well as fresh coriander - fabulous!

This was so-o good. I love scallops and have been looking for light ways to use them in the summer. Napa cabbage is perfect. I made this recipe as written the first time. Thought the vinegar was a little strong, so the next time I substituted seasoned rice vinegar for part of the wine vinegar and liked it better. 3.5 forks!

I have made this several times, and I think that the slaw is excellent. Chinese guests asked for second and third helpings.

I'm giving this a mixed review. Didn't like the Napa cabbage, but loved the asian sauce. I made it a second time without the cabbage and it was wonderful.

I was really looking forward to this dish because all of the reviews were so great. I thought that the dish had very little flavor, and was really a big disappointment.

This was suprisingly easy to make and quick, too. I doubled the sauce ingredients and also added a about 1 tsp more sugar than what was called for to give it a more sweeter taste. Added spinach to the cabbage/carrot mix. Served with sesame stir-fried asparagus. Very good!

I loved the combination of flavors and textures. Just be sure that you take time to brown the scallops until you get a crispy crust.

This is full of flavor and worth your time. When you deglaze the pan with the sauce, don't get discouraged. It is probably going to break (ie.separate:oil and soy sauce). It won't look too good but it taste great on the scallops.

It was a little hard at first but after some practice I found it as easy as making bernaise sauce.
