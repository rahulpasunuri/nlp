I really liked this for these reasons: It tastes very good {as long as you add plenty of salt or it will be bland}, It's very healthy, its very economical, it is suitable to serve my guests who don't eat meat. I could eat this as a lite meal, but my husband prefers this used as a side dish only, he likes soup or something along with it. This tastes a lot like 3 bean salad if you've ever had that, because of the oil and vinegar and the peas. This recipe makes a lot, you might want to halve it unless you want to be eating it for several days. Tip: keep the parsley separate and only add some each time your about to serve this or the parsley will get soggy. I've had this in the fridge for about 4 days now and its holding up well.

Used organic dried black eyed peas and balsamic vinegar instead of red wine - sauteed the onions, bell pepper, and garlic and then added the peas into the skillet. Also wilted in 1 bag organic spinach and served with chicken. Wonderful, healthy, and easy meal!

Excellent for new years meal!! Peas cooked much longer to be tender (1 hour). Tried this with with balsamic vinegar and cilantro. Also added a peeled, seeded, diced roma tomatoe.

This is a fresh, interesting, delish way to use a wonderful ingredient healthily. I think more folks would convert to peas if they knew how good this is. Perfect for parties also.

An excellant side dish for any season. We felt this dish was a good side with an asian inspired salmon main course. Will definitely be having this one again

This tastes great, perfect for New Year's Day gatherings (it's lucky to eat Black Eyed Peas on New Year's). I used balsamic vinegar. Next time I might half the recipe, this makes a LOT!
