Added fresh corn and carrots with the leeks. Delish!

Great as it is, but improved by using low sodium chicken stock (in place of clam juice), 1 pint of 1/2 & 1/2, adding 1 cup of diced, red, yellow & green peppers 1/2 inch size, and thickened with two heaping tablespoons of corn starch. improved eye appeal and consistancy.

I made a "kosher style" version of this recipe, meaning I substituted turkey bacon for pork bacon and fish stock for clam juice. It was DELICIOUS. Turkey bacon doesn't crisp up as well as regular bacon, so I recommend cutting it into smaller pieces in order to avoid a "leathery" texture. I used multi-colored fingerlings and substituted 1/4 cup of dry white wine for 1/4 cup of the water, as recommended by prior reviewers. An easy and delicious recipe.

We loved this recipe--As always slightly amended, with use of whole pint of heavy cream, and 1/2 tsp Cajun hot spice mix I had made and left in the thyme jar which was a great mistake--it blended in. I cut the potatoes thinner and used smaller pieces of cod, shortening cooking time for these, cod was cooked just right.

Good flavor, but there was too much fish and not any vegetables. (potatoes are starch not vegetable) Next time I would use 20 ounces of fish and add 6 carrots!

Wow, we loved this rustic chowder. I used my frozen shrimp broth made from shrimp shells instead of clam juice. Instead of whipping cream I had on hand fat-free sour cream and 1% milk and that worked very well, plus it lighted the recipe. Then I had sliced mushrooms I needed to use so I added them also. The saffron with the shrimp base made this very special. And VERY easy.

Although this is a chowder it really does have the consistency more of a broth. The flavor is delicious. I need to pay more attention to the cooking time for the cod as it was a bit overcooked. I used small yellow yukon potatoes instead of fingerling potatoes. I'll have to try substituting water with white wine next time. *** 3 1/2 stars ! ***

We spied an incredibly thick filet of cod and purchased it, not sure what to do. This recipe sure changed that! We crisped the bacon really well and used an excellent quality ocean clam juice. We also doubled the thyme and saffron threads. Multi- coloured fingerling potatoes cut into big chunks, with the skin on, really made this fabulous. The colour is beautiful and the taste of this chowder is out of this world. Be careful not to overcook the cod. It continues cooking in the hot soup once you get it to the table.

This is an excellent chowder, easy and quick to prepare. I didn't have clam juice and replaced it with fish stock. Will surely do again, and try it with another white fish.

Terific and unique way to serve'fresh' cod!!

Great recipe. Not every dish has to be spicey. The French know this. Many of their dishes have a subtle flavor, not overpowering with hot spices. Try this one. Wine makes a good substitute for all or part of the liquid. If you do like spice, add it, but leave out the saffron. Saffron is meant for a hint of flavor, not to be an overpowering spice.

I'm in a tiny minority, but I found this dish bland and uninteresting. It's certainly not unpleasant, but I wouldn't bother making it again.

I made this recipe pretty much as is, and it was delicious. I did follow the suggestion of several others and used wine in place of water, however I did add some water, too. I used applewood smoked bacon, thick-sliced, and the flavors were subtle, yet complex and satisfying! Highly recommended for a winter evening.

Wonderful. The whole pieces of cod really make the dish

This soup is very good. The flavor is very delicate, and is best when not overly hot. I used the golden Dutch potatoes which turned out fine. After all the fish was gone, there was still more potatoes and leeks in the pot, so I added some chicken stock and pureed it to make a bowl of potato and leek soup for the next day's lunch.

Fairly straightforward preparation. Rich flavor without overpowering mild flavor of the cod. If fingerlings are unavailable small Yukon Gold potatoes make acceptable substitute.

I've made this dish twice for guests now and everyone loves it. The only substitution I make is using white wine instead of water. It's so very simple and wonderful.

I had bought the fresh cod on the way home from work and then selected this recipe from Epicurious. Even with the substitutions I had to make -- no potatoes on hand, but did have a can of whole small white potatoes, no leeks but had an onion, no clam juice but did have fish bouillon -- the dish still came out very tasty and got a thumbs up from my husband and my teenaged son. Adding the wine was an excellent suggestion, and the heavy cream and saffron made the dish so tasty. A good quick choice for a chilly evening.

As other cooks have said, this recipe is delicious & very easy. Thank you to "A Cook from Basking Ridge, NJ" for suggesting the use of wine rather than water - it made a BIG difference in the depth of flavor! I'm a low-carb eater, so I substituted diced mushrooms for the potato & was not disappointed. Be sure to use heavy cream however - I tried to cut back on cals & used half & half, which made the chowder thinner than it should have been. A thicker texture would have made this soup sublime, so I'll be sure to use it next time, as the recipe states.

This very, very easy to make and DELICIOUS! I substituted white wine for the water which added more depth to the chowder. Wonderful winter dish!

This recipe was fabulous. My family loved it and I shared with neighbors they loved it as well. Not a thing to change about it.

I thought this was very good and my husband absolutely loved it. However I think it needs a little tweaking. Some celery might help, I felt it needed something with a little crunch. Also I think a splash of white wine might give it more depth.

I loved this recipe and it was so easy. I made no changes except I used pollack instead of cod. I will certainly be making it again during the holidays!

Very yummy and enjoyed by the whole family. Easy to prepare and clean up too.

Lovely change from usual chowders. For the writer who wondered about saffron - the saffron must be fresh, and tightly sealed to maintain flavour. It is the main seasoning for paella and is the cause of the yellow colouring. The flavour is slightly iodine-flavoured - like deep-sea sole - perhaps an aquired taste - but i will do this one again.

"Delicious!" my husband said - twice - both while eating and after. We used evaporated milk instead of cream (healthier)and regular yellow potatoes as we couldn't find fingerlings here. Nevertheless, simple and very tasty, a nice homey meal. We served it with a crusty baguette and soaked up all the tasty broth.

This is an excellent chowder, different from the typical seafood chowders I have made. And it was relatively easy to prepare. I will definitely have it again.

My husband and I loved this recipe. You have to like saffron to appreciate this one, but we felt that this recipe was very elegant and tasted quite classy and did not involve much work. I'd definitely serve this for company and my husband asked me to make it again just for us.

Made this last night and it's pretty easy to put together but neither my husband nor I were that impressed. Have to admit it's the first time I've used saffron and after paying the price I couldn't figure out what it added. Am I missing something? Also think you could skip the bacon and wilt the leeks in some olive oil. I would call it just okay.
