I could eat an entire batch of these cookies by myself- they are that good. They are a lot of work, but SO worth it. I can pass up most sweets, but these are my downfall.

these are the most requested holiday cookie! despite the long prep time-2 days- there would be a riot if I omitted them from the rotation! these are a favorite in cookie gift boxes, so like another baker, I make the recipe 3 times- once for each color. This simplifies the coloring proces, and yields plenty for the many boxes and family/social holiday events

This recipe surprised me. It didn't seem like there was enough dough to make the italian cookies that I love from New York bakeries. The layers are thicker than I expected and the cookies are delicious, just like the ones I love. Next time, though, I will double the recipe for thicker layers. I will also separate the batter and add the food coloring before folding in the egg whites because the colored layers did not rise as much as the plain layer. I topped the chocolate with chocolate sprinkles before it cooled and cut the cookies into rectangles, just like the ones from the bakery. Thanks for the recipe. My family loves the cookies!

This is one of my all-time favorite treats! The raspberry, almond and chocolate combination is classic and fabulous. Admittedly, these were a little difficult to make the first time (I had some trouble transporting the layers without them breaking), but it went perfectly the second time, and they were delicious and worth every minute both times. Followed the recipe exactly, and wouldn't change a thing. Can't wait (and I'm sure my family can't wait either) to make these again for the holidays!

I had never even tried these when I read a discussion on a gourmet board about how difficult they were to find in Chicago. That and a crush on someone who said he loved these were all the inspiration I needed to try them. Made them twice, pretty much following the recipe exactly. First time i did NOT weigh the 3 batter sections and my layers were uneven. That was corrected the second time. Used parchment paper to line the pans and that worked well. First time I followed someone's suggestion to bake longer and they were a little dry, second time I went a bit longer than the recipe but not as long as other reviewer suggested, sorry I don't remember exactly. First time I used canned marzipan, second time I used canned almond paste (solo) and think the second version was sweeter but also much moister if a teensy bit more difficult to work with. First time I used seedless raspberry jam, second time just used regular jam and again, the second batch was much moister and more flavorful. DEFINITELY needed more than 5 drops of food color; all I had was "neon" but the green and pink turned out great and didn't look neon at all. To ship, I cut only into slices, not individual pieces and they arrived in perfect condition.

To make these even more delicious, roll out a thin layer of marzipan and put it over the top layer of baked dough - then cover with the melted chocolate. Let the chocolate cool/harden, flip it over, put another thin layer of marzipan over the top, and cover with the rest of the melted chocolate. Mmmmmm...

I think I discovered my favorite cookie! I did beat the egg-whites and made the batter separately for each layer (someone in another review said they it was difficult to separate). The single layers where extremely cake-y and I do think the beating of the whites added to their fluffiness. I might be wrong since I never tried it without beating. I added less jam than called for, just enough to cover the layer (heated the jam for easy spreading). Well worth the effort!

I just got finished making these and while they're beautiful looking they are only mediocre in flavor. They are certainly not worth making again considering the expense,time,and effort that has to go into them. I think I'll have to pass this one up next year at Christmas.

I have been making these cookies for so many years I've lost count. This year I made a mistake. I always double the recipe and this time when I was adding the flour I started to double it twice! I caught myself after adding 6 cups (two too many) Once that far into this process I figured I'd add one extra egg white and hope for the best. I cut them today and they were fine, a little denser maybe and slightly less moist, but by no means a disaster. Thank goodness! I just wanted to share in case it might help someone else. Happy holidays!

These are my all time favorite cookies and although time consuming to make they weren't terribly hard. I used non stick parchment paper to bake which worked great and the layers plopped right out without a problem. I let each layer cool in the pan for about 10 mins before turning out to a cooling rack. I also let each layer cook for about 12-14mins..7-10 is not enough. I did have a hard time spreading the thin layers evenly in the pan so I'll have to work on that next time. I added extra food coloring to the layers since I found the color too light. The one problem I had was even after chilling with a weight over night the layers still slid apart. Anyone have any ideas for preventing that? Overall a great cookie and an impressive dessert to show off! Will definitely make these again!

These taste even better than the ones from the local Italian bakery. They are somewhat labor intensive but really good. Also freeze well so can be made weeks ahead of serving. These are one of the annual Christmas cookies I make.

Turned out very very good, although I didn't think it would until after it was done. (It looked a little brittle after being baked but it was really fine.) I might make the three doughs separately next time since it was difficult to separate into three parts after it was mixed.

I have a very old recipe for these cookies that is the same as this one. Just follow the directions, be sure to use the right size pans, use high quality chocolate and jam--and you will have one amazing treat. Rainbow cookies are in all of the Italian pastry shops in Brooklyn, NY and the homemade ones really impress people.

Offset spatula. You've got to have one to spread these layers thinly enough. Really essential for this recipe.

After the second try, these are the best I've ever made. I used the almond paste, whipped and folded in the egg whites, this made just enough batter for the three layers. The first time there wasn't enough batter and I over oooked. The waxed paper made such a mess the first tme I tried to spread the dough, I just made sure to grease the pan really well, and cook one layer at a time. I began with the green layer, it came right out of the pan when inverted on a cooling rack, and then baked, cooled and assembled into another pan lined with wax paper. The slightly warm cake made it easy to spread the jelly. I assembled into a baking pan, weighted it with a cutting board and cast iron pans, frosted the top, refrigerated, flipped, frosted again. Wondeful recipe. It just takes tme :)

I was obsessed with these cookies when my husband and I lived in New York, but it never occured to me that I could make these until a parent at my son's school submitted this cookie recipe to our community cookbook, which I was editing. I have been making them for four or five years now,and I subsitute almond filling (Solo brand) for almond paste when I can find it...it eliminates the difficulty of incorporating the paste into the batter, and the cookies are slightly more cake-like,with a moist and tender crumb, which is how I remember them. I also use premium dark chocolate, and melt some butter in with the chocolate to make cutting the bars easier. The only other variation I make to this recipe is to cut them into bars -- much easier. Being a purist, I have resisted varying the dye-jobs to suit the season. However, with the Packers in the play-offs, and a football party coming up, I am planning on making them in green and gold. Everyone loves these cookies -- I am happy to bring a taste of New York to California.

They tasted great but some things for next time: 1. Figure out a way to spread the batter thinner all the way across pan 2. Cut when the chocolate wasn't completely hardened 3. Best thing I did (by accident) was, after putting chocolate on the bottom too as one reviewer suggested) -- when I cut it I flipped it over and the bottom became the top and was perfectly flat and smooth. 4. I'll do them in Red, White, and Blue for the 4th of July

This recipe is more time consuming that difficult. I did NOT separate the eggs since so many reviewers said to skip this step. I used the non stick aluminum foil and baked the first pink layer for 10 minutes. When I flipped it over on to a cooling rack, half of the middle stuck to the foil! It was a gooey mess. I baked the other two sheets for 15 minutes and was pleased. Fortunately I had enough marzipan left over to make 1/3 more and recreate the pink layer. I would suggest using the almond paste and not marzipan. The almond flavor could be more intense, even though I used almond extract. Perhaps by adding the whipped egg whites, the batter is lighter and cooks faster? Or else it's our high altitude in Denver. I used the apricot spread between the layers. I also lined the cookie sheet with melted chocolate before I began assembling to create a bottom layer of chocolate. I found that the melted chocolate set up so quickly. I used the hot knife as suggested, but the chocolate cracked. I ended up using my hair dryer to rewarm the top layer of chocolate and it cut easily, except the bottom layer fell off. I don't eat sugar so I can't give an opinion on taste but they sure look great! (I did cheat and ate a mini bite and they are delicious)

My favorite of all Christmas cookies - they are time consuming, and the batter is a pain to spread, but they are decadently good. Mom preferred apricot jam (though raspberry is good too :-) to which she would add a bit of either brandy, cognac or rum (depending on what was in the liquor cabinet) after she heated the preserves. Do try it!

I've been making this recipe for years, and it's a favorite in my christmas gift boxes. I couldn't stop if I wanted to- by popular demand! The first time was a mess- with all the dividing and coloring. Now, I triple the recipe by making the batter three times- one recipe for each of the colors. They freeze well, so they can be made in advance of an event, or you can defrost them quickly when your pressed for time but want a nice dessert

I too grew uo in an Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY. Rainbow cookies were my all-time favorite! Not all rainbow cookies are the same though. The best were at a bakery on Court St. called Caputo's. Years later after I moved to NC, I called Caputo's to order rainbow cookies for my wedding and found out that Caputo's orders the cookies from another bakery. After searching far and wide, I tried the rainbow cookies from Mike's Pastry in Boston. They are just like the ones from Caputo's! After paying about $35 for 2 pounds from Mike's, my husband suggested that I try and find a recipe - which lead me to this recipe. I found the reviews very helpful. I used egg beaters in mine which worked just fine. The 13 x 9 pans worked great. I used raspberry jam on one layer and apricot on the other. I softened them with my hand mixer to make them easier to spread. I made the layers and refrigerated them with the weight for a little over three hours, then I spread chocolate on the top. I used milk chocolate. I let it sit for about an hour until hardened, and then flipped it over onto another pan. I cut it into seven 9-inch bars and then coated all sides with chocolate. They then sat for another hour. I froze some bars, put some in the fridge, and cut one into rectangle cookies and ate them! They were wonderful! They are still not exactly like Caputo's or Mike's. Their's have a top and bottom layer of almond paste, but I am not sure what else it is mixed with. I would love to find out. Anyone know? By adding these extra layers to this recipe, the cookies were be PERFECT! This recipe, although time consuming, is not difficult and not very messy. It was an enjoyable experience and well worth the effort.

I have been looking for a recipe for these cookies for years. Ramona Lee's Pastry Shop in Franklin Square make wonderful cookies but they have changes owners and the cookies aren't as good. This recipe is as good as the old cookies! I used raspberry jam and apricot jam and doubled the chocolate ingredients to coat both top and bottom. I also made swirled lines on the bars like the bakery. I feel like I have found true treasure! This recipe is an absolute keeper. Tahnk you!

Fantastic! I made these for a friend who loves the rainbow cookies from Mike's Pastries in Boston's North End, and even tasting them side-by-side mine were certainly respectable, and possibly even better than theirs. I think I got better at making this over time as I learned to make thinner cookies--it's almost impossible to make the layers too thin. We both would have preferred to have chocolate on top and bottom, so next time I'll double the chocolate and make a layer on the bottom before I start. I had some trouble getting the jam on evenly, and although I used an icing spatula to smooth it down I still used more than was called for. Whether or not this was a bad thing was unclear: my friend claims that less jam would be better, while I liked the moisture and fruity flavor...

Excellent! My husband likes these without chocolate better, I might try half with powdered sugar sprinkled on top next time.

Loved it! These are my husband's favorite cookies, and he has been missing them since we moved from NYC. Just a couple of observations. I doubled the recipe as someone suggested and used a half sheet, but I wouldn't recommend doing this. It took a little too long to bake (about 13 minutes) so that the center was done, and this resulted in the edges being a little overdone. Also, I used parchment, which worked fine without greasing, and let it cool on a rack on the parchment. The problem is that the pieces are so large, that I had one crack in several places while lifting it and placing it on the other ones. My 2 1/2 year old daughter thought it was great - she picked up the broken pieces and ate them. If I had had another person around, it might have worked, but baking the smaller version would have been better. By the way, I just reassembled the pieces and placed the baking sheet on and weighed it down, and after pouring the chocolate on, you couldn't even tell that it had fallen apart, so don't worry if it does happen. I used .8lbs bulk Ghirardelli chocolate I got at Trader Joe's and it was perfect for the half sheet. Why use chocolate chips when you are baking such a great dessert? I cut back on the preserves because some reviewers thought it was too much. I used a jar of Bonne Maman apricot preserves (13 oz which I warmed and pressed through a sieve), and it was not enough. I think that maybe the comment about too much jam applies to the raspberry, but I would definitely use more of the apricot than I did next time - about 50% more would be good. I agree with the reviewer who said to cut them when the chocolate is set, but not hard, otherwise the chocolate will crack. This is a great recipe that is actually very forgiving. It does take a lot of bowls, but is not especially difficult and will make you look like a pro. Would definitely make again and again and again.....

These cookies are absolutely fantastic. Just like the bakery ones I remember as a kid. I took the advice of other bakers and didn't separate the eggs with perfect results.

My orignal recipe calls for apricot jam & strawberry jam. (I don't like either) so I use seedless raspberry. I refrigerate mine overnight as a minimum, and have refrigerated them 3 days before adding the chocolate. The longer they sit, the better they taste. I use dark chocolate (my family's preferance) and they NEVER last! I made these for my ex-boyfriend's mom (when we were together) and she swore that I must have Italian blood. (A great compliment coming from her.) My aunt didn't believe that I didn't buy them! My mom said they were better than bakery bought. I don't use wax paper, I use parchment, have never had a problem with the batter. I also sprinkle rainbow non-pareils on the top. Yum yum yum....

I made these cookies for a "Best Cookie Battle" Christmas party, and they took second place! I thought that 12 rows crosswise seemed like a lot, but the recipe is correct: any fewer and the cookies come out too large. I would suggest using a scale to divide the dough, since it is thick and taking it in and out of a measuring cup is like to make a big mess. I think I will try apricot or cherry jam for the next batch; I like the raspberry but it does cover up the almond flavor somewhat.

Rating: 4
Well worth the effort. I used 8x10 pans and did not try to remove the layers and put on a cooling rack. I left them in the pans until I was ready to assemble and used the wax paper to flip the layers on top of each other. A few cracks, but I can't imagine trying to lift it without the wax paper. I only refrigerated for about 1 hour and then cut the chilled cake into four long strips. I attempted to frost the top and sides with chocolate, but the chocolate didn't stick well to the sides of the bars (too crumbly). Next time I would only do the tops, as most of the chocolate on the sides fell off after I cut them anyway. Also, I made little swirls in the chocolate with a fork - which looked nice. Finally, I cut the cookies into small rectangles, not diamonds. This was much easier!

Ok, so I made two batches of these, one following this recipe and one from a friend. I think the second batch was better (friend's recipe) so here's my advice: no need to separate the eggs. this only adds another step to an already laborious process. It makes no difference. Also, the second batch i did not refridgerate at all. When i followed this recipe, and out them in the fridge before icing, they turned into ROCKS. but, without refridgerating they were nice and soft. no need to use fancy jelly, the regular smuckers seedless spreads really well and is much easier to work with. also, when cutting, dip the knife in warm water and then wipe with a towel. it will slice right through. all in all these are wonderful, but these few changes made it a lot easier. make sure, when spreading the dough, that the edges are as even as the middle. finally, these cookies get better with age! i would strongly suggest making them three days before you want to serve them!!

These are the most wonderful cookies. I put them in tins and give them away as gifts every year for Christmas and they are well received. After making these so many times I have found that apricot is much better then raspberry and if u heat it up and push it through a strainer there won't be any lumps in your jam. Also pulling them out of the oven when just the edges are brown is a must otherwise they are not as moist and delicious. One last thing is putting them in the fridge to speed up the chocolate hardening is a bad idea. As soon as it sets, if you cut them the knife will go right through the soft chocolate. I'm making 4 batches this Sunday for Christmas and we are all looking forward to them.

What a disaster. 10 minutes is nowhere near long enough for these cookies to bake. I tried inverting the first pan, and it was so raw it flowed through the grates of my cooling rack. I have an oven thermometer. I don't believe it could be that off. Of course, once that layer was ruined - my cookies were pretty much shot, and after SO MUCH WORK and MONEY! Very irritated.

These cookies are an all-time favorite for my family, and as I've been making about 5 batches a year fro the past 3 years I've found that this recipe is extraordinarily forgiving... no matter what little thing I do differently, they always come out perfectly. This batter isn't as fragile as I would have thought... I've even left some sitting on the counter while other layers baked & had no problems. We've tried apricot and raspberry preserves, but definitely prefer raspberry. I agree with the reviewer who said no to bother separating the eggs. This seemed to save me a lot of time and an extra bowl & made no noticeable difference in the end result. In reponse to another reviewer - yes, my wax paper smokes too, but I've found that if I cut less of it so that it barely extends past the edge of my pan then I have less of a "smoking problem." These cookies also do amazingly well in the freezer and family members have reported being able to store batches in the fridge for a week or more with no problem (of course, they don't usually last long enough to need storage). One last note - One batch is never enough. I'm yet to have anyone taste these cookies and not fall in love with them.

Love it! Love it! Love it!, these cookies are better than any you would get from a Bakery. I make them all year round and there is never enough, even with doubling the recipe.

Memories...it brought back every good Italian bakery memory I've ever had...I can see the string hanging & smell the goodies baking. Everyone demanded this recipe, even those who don't bake. I did have some trouble figuring out how wide an area to spread the dough...it would not have covered a 9 X 13 area. I spread each color into approx. 8 x 10 and 1/4 thick rectangle. After baking, spreading w/ jam, and stacking I trimmed them evenly and cut into 7 long strips (1 1/4" x 12") I coated the 'bars' with melted chocolate on all 4 sides with the help of a cooling rack & refrigerated till hardened. I stored bars in wax paper till ready for use...then I cut into 1/2 slices. Finished cookie was approx. 1/2 x 1-1/4 x 1 inch, about 85 cookies. They were just the right size and the recipe made plenty...but still not enough! Everyone devoured them. It was a lot easier than the recipe sounded! Anyone can make these, even a novice baker.

Delicious! For my second attempt, I saved time by not separating the eggs. (No difference in final product). As long as the eggs are at room temp, they will whip up thick and light (ribbon stage) with the sugar and almond paste if you leave the mixer on high for at least 8 minutes. Also, doubling the recipe was the perfect amount to fill 3 half-sheet pans. Let the cakes cool for a little while before flipping them out. They will break if they are too hot.

I cheated and made just two layers, green and white. Instead of the 13x9" pans, I used jelly roll pans, and the proportions worked out perfectly. I agree with the reviewer from AL, the raspberry might be overpowering, but I think it's a matter of taste. I am not wild about raspberries, so next time I will make it with apricot. To cut them, I found that a chopping blade worked best. All in all, easier than I thought it would be. Did anyone else have a problem with the waxed paper smoking in the oven?

This is the second time I made this recipe and will now be a New Year's tradition! My children and I just LOVE these and could easily eat the entire batch! They are very time consuming to make but are worth it! I recommend breaking up the steps in stages (mix marzipan and sugar one day, bake next day and assemble layers with jam, spread chocolate and cut day after and sample!)Using an angled or offset spatula is essential for spreading batter into pans and spreading the chocolate. I make the center layer pale yellow instead of white because it looks great with the other pastels. Also assembling layers on cookie sheet allows for easier cutting. This time I cut some into rectangular pieces as bakeries do which looks very colorful on a platter. I look forward to making it again next year!

This couldn't be better!! I doubled the recipe and still wanted to keep them all for myself!! Everyone I gave these to for the holiday went crazy! Next time I might cut down on the jam just a little. I found that the layers slid around too much. I also had a little bit of trouble cutting them but found if you flip them over so the chocolate was on the bottom it helped get through them a bit easier. I will be making these for years to come!! Even my husband, who doesn't like almond that much, thought these were great. So much moister than any I've ever bought. Worth all the effort! Yum

These cookies were incredible. I grew up on Long Island and these were a staple at just about every family function. These were by far the best I've ever had (sorry Aunt Fannie). I was so thrilled to be able to make them for my children. I also wanted to put chocolate on both sides just like the bakeries. Cutting through the chocolate was a little tricky but with a little trial and error I found that my chef's knife dipped in hot water, then wiped dry did the trick. The key is to use gentle pressure and a sawing motion. These are a little involved but definitely worth all the effort!

This is a great recipe with a little work involved. I suggest making a double batch. Like the bakeries, I wanted to add chocolate to both sides, so after you melt chocolate on one side stick it in the freezer for about 30mins then flip over and add melted chocolate to the other side. My non-chocolate eating boyfriend got a batch with no chocolate at all and for the first time enjoyed a Rainbow cookie to his liking. I make these for Christmas, weeks in advance and freeze until the morning they are needed. The family goes crazy for them.

These were my favorite cookies as a child in New York, but when I found this recipe, it had been at least twenty years since I tasted one. I followed the recipe precisely, and the finished product is PERFECT. You wouldn't know these from the ones they make in those wonderful, old world Brooklyn bakeries. I've made them three more times since then, and I have a few comments about modifying the recipe: 1. It works very well with slightly less chocolate. I ran out of chocolate and only used 4 oz last time, and it was fine. This is a nice way to cut out some calories if you're inclined. 2. I tried making it without food coloring for a more "adult" looking treat, and this changes the texture in a subtle but negative way. 3. For added authenticity, get some rainbow sprinkles for the top! 4. Despite the suggestion to use seedless jam, the seeds are very subtle, and I had a hard time noticing the difference either way. Whichever you have in the house will work just fine.

I love almond and I really enjoyed the almond taste of these cookies. Even someone who doesn't like marzipan liked these cookies. They are labor intensive but I didn't find any of the steps too difficult. I was a bit intimidated when faced with three lots of dough, but I stuck with it and had no problems. I think I used to much jam (the raspberry flavor was rather strong) and I'll try the raspberry & apricot the next time. I find you end up with a lot of waste if you cut on the diagonal, and you need a large sharp knife to not end up with a mess.

I have made these cookies three times and even though they are really time consuming they are completely worth it. Here are a few tips that I have learned. It is really easy to melt the chocolate chips in the microwave. Put them in a pyrex measuring glass and microwave 1-2 minutes. Pull it out in between to make sure you aren't overcooking them. Also, I like the apricot and raspberry jam layers better than raspberry alone. I use about 8oz of chocolate chips and include frosting the sides and rake the top for a pretty effect. Lastly, almond paste has a stronger almond flavor than marzipan so I would recommend the paste. I also add another teaspoon of almond extract. To intensify the almond flavor. That's my tips enjoy!!

I had a hard time w/the marzipan (I think it was old cause it was really hard) but once I got done processing it, it was smooth sailing. I enjoyed making this. I used starwberry jam (the only one I could find seedless) It came out really yummy. I especially like the chocolate on top. I added an extra ounce of non-sweeteded chocolate for a little bitter bite. I practically have to hide them from the family. I just hope they last until Christmas!

I think the recipie requires a lot of work mostly after the baking. I find the hardest part to be getting the thin layers out of the pan after baking without them breaking. I made them for a party and everyone was impressed they are delicious and gorgeous to look at even if it is a lot of work. Try using apricot jam on one layer and raspberry jam on the second layer it works.

This recipe was so easy to make and so great!Everyone I make it for can't believe they are homemade they look so professional. I will continue to make them over and over

Wow! These are the cookies to make if you want to impress. People didn't want to believe I made them at home. I, like an earlier reviewer, spread chocolate on the top and bottom. I did the bottom first and raked it with a fork to create a nice texture. Let it chill till firm in the freezer and them flip and do the top and sides. Just fantastic cookies better than Veniero's and as good as Bruno's in Brooklyn!!!

I'd give these cookies a 5 if I could! These were my sister and my favorite cookies growing up in NY. I had a family affair in my home, and the NY relations were very impressed that they tasted as good as or better than the real thing! They were very easy to prepare, but were time consuming. These were beautiful and made me very proud.

I use apricot jam instead of raspberry. It's a fabulous recipe--one that gets raves every time I make it. They look fabulous on a tray of assorted cookies. I could eat the entire batch by myself! They freeze well.

I feel I am an expert on rainbow cookies-my favorite! These were time consuming to make-2 days. I kept them in the fridge w/a cutting board on top of them overnight. I also added yellow food coloring to the plain dough. The only problem was melting the chocolate-it didn't. I had to add hot water to melt it. Above all & after 2 days of prep, these were beyond delish!

EXCELLENT!!!!! Yes, they are work, but my colleagues loved them so much, one wants to pay me to make them for an after-bar mitzvah (sp?) event!! They are beautiful, and taste even better.

These are more like petits fours than cookies. They improved with age and became more evenly moist. I glazed them with a white chocolate ganache and garnished with a pink buttercream rosebud w/green leaf. They were beautiful! People stood around plate & ooohed.

I have made these from a previous recipe - different procedure, but same ingredients except apricot jam and 8oz. almond paste. So, I used 8oz, almond paste and 3tsp of almond extract and callebeut chocolate. My layers also split. On the first day, the tasteof the raspberry jam was overpowering, and there was very little almond taste. However, the next day they were great. And yes, heat the knife before cutting

This is a keeper. Well worth the extra dishes. I didn't have raspberry jam so I used strawberry, I am sure any flavor would be fine.

I've been wanting to make these since I saw the recipe--I had remembered the bakery version from my childhood;they came out just as I remembered -- or even better!! I did have a little trouble when turning them out of the pan (the layer seemed to break up) and found it easier to use the wax paper to just lift out and then turn over onto rack (as another reader suggested also). I also found that the layers stuck to the rack if not removed (onto a clean wax paper) very soon after cooling. I only had one 13x9 All Clad baking pan, so I just allowed it to cool between baking each layer, and that worked out fine! They are delicious and look lovely(my husband was very impressed) and not really any more work than most other cookies!

I made these for a cookie exchange and everyone loved them. They are beautiful!! Very fancy. Definitely a Christmas cookie. I used milk chocolate chips.

Incredible! A very impressive looking dessert which was surprisingly easy to make (wouldn't have guessed it from reading the recipe). Grease the wax paper well and you won't have problems with breakage. When cutting, dip your knife into hot water and wipe dry (every few slices) or the chocolate tends to crack.

This cookie wasn't as much work as I thought it would be. My only misshap was when I tried turn one cake layer onto the rack to cool; a small piece stuck to the bottom of the pan. For the other two layers, instead of trying to flip the cakes onto the racks, I lifted them up by the wax paper edges and set them onto the rack--this worked much better. I was wondering why the recipe says to wait an hour for the chocolate to set up when you spread it on the cookies. The chocolate became firm almost as soon as you spread them over the cookies.

I had worked in an Italian bakery for years and this was my favorite cookie that they made. I found the layers to be quite thin the first time I made them, so I doubled the batter and made it in the same pan to get a more cake-like cookie. Like previous reviewers, you must add additional food coloring. In addition, I also put chocolate glaze on the bottom and top, first I glazed the bottom, put the cookies in the freezer until it was set, and then coated the top with the chocolate. They came out great.

This recipe requires a decent amount of labor and time and a whole lot of dishes, but these are well worth it! Coming from an all Italian family, I have tried many versions of these cookies, but this recipe is by far the best ever. My entire family was very impressed. As someone else suggested, I used more food coloring (about 10 drops) and the colors came out great--very vibrant! I even colored the plain dough with yellow food coloring to give it more color. I can't wait to make them again!

I made these cookies for something new last Christmas, and they were gobbled up so quickly that I found myself wishing I'd made a double batch. Now my family keeps requesting these wonderful rainbow cookies, and though they are a lot of work and make a ton of dishes, I love them so much myself that I can't complain one bit!

I have been searching for a recipe that would come close to the cookies my grandmother used to make when I was a child. These are better!!! Thanks so much, will make these again and again!!!

My entire, very fussy extended family was in raptures over these. They were just like the bakery ones -- just better. 2 hints though: definitely do not try to turn the cooked layers out of the pan until they have cooled a bit (be very careful if using a deep pan); and the 5 drops of coloring will make a pastel color. Next time, I will use more food coloring to make the lurid bakery colors we love so much! I also did not use 12 oz. of jam, only about 9.

I am so happy to have found this recipe on your website. I had taken it from another magazine a few years ago and subsequently lost it. These cookies are soooo delicious, more like little cakes than cookies. I'll send this recipe on to my sister-in-law, who left New York 5 years ago. She and her family love these! I also know them as Venetians and have baked them at Easter as well as Christmas. Definitely try them!!!

My family went wild over this recipe, although they almost did not have the opportunity to eat the cookies. My first attempt at the recipe was a disaster! I found that loosening the baked cookies while still hot was not effective. On my second try, I let the tray sit for 2-3 minutes then the trays came out beautifully. This is a must do recipe for every Christmas holiday now! My husband even said they were better than Veneiro's in Manhattan!

Thank you so so much for this recipe...these cookies are my son's absolute favorite and unitl now we could only buy them at the bakery in New York...we dont live there anymore! I made them for his 7th birthday and he brought them to school to share for snacktime...what a hit! Thanks

These cookies were absolutely luscious!!! I found the recipe and knew immediately that I would love them because they contain almond paste. They really added to the beauty of my cookie gifts this Christmas! They are so festive with the different colored layers! I used Solo almond paste instead of the marzipan paste. I adjusted the oven temp to 325 F. I never bake cookies at 350 F- that's just too high of a temp. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the tee. Much caution must be taken when assembling the layers so they don't break or crack. I was lucky with mine. I actually made 2 batches. They can be cut in diamonds or small squares are nice too. This will definitely be a part of my Xmas cookie collection every year!! Try these- they are alittle extra work, but most definitely worth every minute of the effort! Happy Baking!
