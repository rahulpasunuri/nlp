The recipe was too salty.

As written, this recipe is way too salty, and I love salt so it must be bad. Also, it looks a little like cat food when molded on the plate. Requires excessive amounts of chopping. I believe there are a number of mistakes here. I can only assume it should read "discard the dark green portions of the leeks" as every other recipe using leeks instructs.

I did not make this recipe myself, but ate it on Thanksgiving at a friend's home. I was eating my 1st 'vegetarian' Thanksgiving meal. I didn't want to be rude, so didn't want to question the ingredients ahead of time, just decided to go ahead & try everything that was served. I am not a vegetarian myself, so this was a new experience for me. I found this salad to be one of the best salads I have ever tasted. I thoroughly enjoyed it & do intend to fix it myself sometime during the Holiday Season.
