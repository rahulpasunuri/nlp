Perhaps the most elegant, professional ice cream I've ever concocted! It gets firm enough to serve without any further freezing, and the texture is divine. I used ricotta from a nearby farm. My boyfriend proclaimed it "worthy of any restaurant in the world." Now I'm considering adding it to tomorrow night's dinner party menu, despite the Indian theme...

This gelato had a subtle grainy texture - do you think my sieve wasn't fine enough or was it the low-fat ricotta that I used? Or was that how it was for everyone? It sort of turned my husband off even though I thought it had a nice flavor.

I followed the recipe but reduced the sugar by half and added Splenda, and I put the warm mixture through the blender rather than straining it. This tastes so rich & creamy -- comparable to ice cream made with heavy cream & eggs!

Very Good. It was easy and elegant.

An excellent summer dessert.I made the gelato but instead of the blackberry sauce , I made a simple peach sauce with peach jelly,orange liquor, and a light squeeze of lemon juice. I spooned this onto a plate , placed the gelato on top , drizzled a raspberry sauce ( made in much the same fashion as the peach sauce ) , and added fresh peach chunks,a few raspberries and blackberries. This was a crowd pleaser.
