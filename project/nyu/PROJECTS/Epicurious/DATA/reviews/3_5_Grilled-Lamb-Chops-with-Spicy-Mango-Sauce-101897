I managed to mess this up. I used a red onion, and made the sauce ahead. It tasted really good when I made it, but the red onion flavor got yucky after I chilled the sauce for an hour. So don't do that! I'll make it again w/o the onion and double the cayenne. I think chipotle might work well too.

Doubled the recipe & used 1/2 fresh serrano chili pepper and a 1/4 tsp of "Jump Up & Kiss Me" hot sauce in place of the cayenne pepper. It was fantastic with good heat and complex flavors.

Love it! I did make on change. Instead of cayenne, I used chili paste - almost a teaspoons worth. That was a bit much, so I poured a little milk to mellow it out and it was yummy! I have a lot of left over sauce. Any suggestions for what else I could put it on?

We made this and it was beautiful, really worked well together. We like this a little spicer but we'll know for next time.

very good, we thought the sauce was great (although agree it's not spicy) easy and will make again

I messed with the sauce a little after tasting it and deciding it wouldn't work. I threw some orange juice in it and half a grapefruit, which muddled the flavours a bit more but made it more of a tropical chutney, I'll mess with the recipie again and figure a way to make it work more, but It did work great as a dipping sauce for the lamb in the end!

The mango sauce was good (although if you like it "hot", the recipe as it is, is not hot). However, I would not serve it over lamb again. I thought the flavours competed rather than complemented.

I'm always looking for recipes with mango, especially sauces. The sauce was fast, easy & delicious. I tried it with some changes, enough to make a whole new recipe, probably, but here they are: 1) leave about 1/4 to 1/3 of the mango in chunks & add to the sauce after pureeing; add a little minced habenero chili or hot sauce to the mango puree; use brown sugar or honey instead of white sugar; prepare a day in advance & let sit in the fridge (the flavors blend well & my leftover sauce tasted better). Finnaly I served it with chicken marinated in lime juice & grilled with red, green, & jalepeno peppers & red onion & served over rice. Garnish with avacado chunks & cilantro. It was good!

What a delicious way to use mangos which are so abundant in the stores right now. This was a delicious and refreshing way to prepare lamb. my family loves lamb and I am always lookig for new ways to serve it. I will definately make this again and hope others will too. Enjoy!

This is a great, easy dish. The sauce is colorful and presents well. I have added some lime or lemon yogurt at times when I want a creamier consistency. We also found this sauce great on grilled fish (ahi and prawns).

Thought this recipe was great! The sauce was delicious. Would definitely make it again. I had leftover sauce which I think I'll try with swordfish.

I thought it was great. We eat a lot of lamb as we raise our own. I will surely use this recipe again.
