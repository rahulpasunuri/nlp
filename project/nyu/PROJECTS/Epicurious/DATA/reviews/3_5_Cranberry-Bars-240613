I doubled this recipe and added a little orange zest. The dough spread perfectly and was a good bottom for the amount of cranberry. i chose not to strain them and actually preferred that way. i do not like super-sweet, so these are perfect for my family and I! I am testing with children today at school and will see what they think. I also cut into bite size mini bars so easy to eat in one mouthful. Delicious recipe!

Based on reviews I made half of the crust mix and put in a 8x12 pan. The crust was fine but the topping??? You might as well top it with canned cranberries. This recipe needs a facelift. Try adding orange rind or walnuts; dress it up!

I agree I thought the crust was a bit too thick, but these were so super easy that I will make them again. We served "cranberries two ways" as a dessert -- served these with cranberry sorbet, which was a fun way to have them.

This recipe makes a fabulous holiday treat for Thanksgiving or Christmas. I had to add 2T cold water to the dough to make it stick together and did not butter the paper in the pan--I used parchment instead of aluminum foil. Would dust with powdered sugar just before serving; otherwise it sinks in and can't be seen

Weighing the tasty end product against the relative ease with which these are made, this recipe is an AllStar...even if the bars are a B+ kind of thing. If serving as a dessert made ahead of time, might consider a corn syrup/powder sugar "frosting" to run across top in a thin line, as confectioners sugar disappears into the cranjelly after an hour or two.

Easy, tasty, nice little treats. Two comments: the recipe does yield too much dough for a 9 x 9 pan  unless you want a super thick crust. And I dont think the cranberries need to be strained at all.

This recipe was easy. But I think the shortbread could have been richer. The cranberry topping didn't come out the way I expected. It's essentially like cranberry sauce on a shortbread. I may try it again with a few variations.

This is one of our favorites. It would be too easy to eat the whole thing all at once...and I didn't even put the powdered sugar on it!

I had some leftover fresh cranberries so made these as an extra something on the dessert offerings for Thanksgiving. They were pretty good...I like the tartnessmyself. I added some orange zest to the cranberries as well. Nothing really special but a nice little bar nonetheless.

I do not review often. These deserved it though. They had the perfect sweet/tart smooth/crisp thing going on. They certainly do not need to be strained... gonberries is what makes them so delicious!ng on. You certainly do not need to strain the berries. The slight bitterness of cr5

I baked them in 7x11" glass pan and worked great. Wonderful flavor throughout! Very easy to make and loved the sweet of the crust with the tartness of the cranberries. A terrific "something different" to the Thanksgiving Day desserts.

Made with Purity.Organic Stevens Variety Cranberries from WI. I did not need to strain (but I like the tartness). I'm not a baker and they're easy and delicious!

This recipe was great, very easy to make and clean up. They did need to cook longer than the recipe stated, and the crust was too thick for a 9x9 pan. Still, they were tasty. They freeze well, too.

the "shortbread" crust was yummy tho in my oven took 25min at 350 and another 5-10 at 400. I used fresh local cranberries--we're from MA-- and decided to strain them as the skin and tiny seeds were bitter. I saved some cranberries that did not burst for the top. I served w/ ice cream and was very delicious-- everyone wanted seconds, but as bars on their own I think they're only fair to good as the cranberries need more substance on top of the very good "crust"--w/o straining the cranberries would have had bitter skins and been not very enjoyable.
