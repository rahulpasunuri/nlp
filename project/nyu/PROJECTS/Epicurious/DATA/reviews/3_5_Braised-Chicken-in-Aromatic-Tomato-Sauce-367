This was very good and easy. I doubled the spices (as I always do) and added red wine and balsamic vinegar at the end, and added no sugar or tomato paste. I am glad I did because it was quite sweet. I couldn't help but add 1 clove of garlic. I can imagine this would be delightful on a cold winter night! It is a keeper recipe.

Ease of preparation and ingredients readily found in most pantries combine in a dish that is remarkably delicious. My children devoured it as well. Really satisfying on a cold night. This one goes into my repertoire!

Love this recipe b/c the ingredients are easily available in your pantry. If you're out of wine, it's no big deal. I made it without it and it still came out delicious. It's even better as left overs after the flavors have had a chance to marinate. I ate mine over rice and quite like it. I wonder what it would be like over orzo...

Too sweet, my husband said he felt like he was eating potpourri. I enjoy more savory meals, I don't like "sweet" stuff in my dinner. Sorry, but I won't be making this one again.

Delicious! Now a permanent part of our family recipes!! I made this for a weeknight dinner party. While easy enough to do it the night-of, I prepared it the night before. I separated the chicken from the sauce and refrigerated them separately overnight. I put the chicken back into the sauce and reheated it all together the night of the party. Like all sauces and stews, the flavor is always better the second day. Served it over thick spaghetti. This recipe was a big hit! Other items on the menu that night (all available in epicurious): Grilled Rib-Eye Steaks with Mediterranean Rub (I used tri-tip), Spiced Carrots, and Apple Ginger Pie with Cider-Bourbon Sauce. We had a nice green salad and green beans, too.

Delicious. Other than the new world tomatoes it reads like the contents of the spice rack of a medievael lord. I will make it again, many times.

I loved the cinnamon flavors in this recipe. Very delicious for a healthy recipe.

I agree with others that the sauce was excellent but it overpowered the chicken. I used 1 T good red wine and 1 T aged balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, and I served on basamati brown rice (sturdy stuff) without cheese, as others had recommended. As noted by others, I would make the sauce again but use for beef (would come out like salisbury steak) or perhaps pasta alone.

I love this dish; I love the aromas! I will cook it again and again. Plus it's so adaptible - the sauce is good over vegetables, rice or pasta. Yum!

I have been making this dish for several years and it is a hit every time. I always use boneless skinless chicken breasts and lately I've been adding extra tomato paste to thicken up the sauce more. Recently discovered that it's really good over a box of Near East brand brown rice pilaf! Makes great leftovers too.

I thought this was delicious and easy to make. I used whole chicken breasts, and served it with seasonal vegetables instead of the pasta. The leftover sauce, minus the chicken, was used the next night with some added chopped fresh chilli and mixed with tagliatelle.

This was a good dish and an easy one to whip up after work as I usually have all the ingredients in my house. The flavors, in my opinion, don't go with pasta or cheese, so I served it on rice. It will make good leftovers.

Great! I made as written, except that I added less water and did not add the allspice. Very flavourful and chicken remained quite moist. Served with spaghetti tossed with a bit of parmesan.

added red wine after the spices and before the tomatoes... other than that, no changes. really liked it!

This smells great but tastes better! The prep took longer than I'd imagined but the finished product was worth the wait.

This style of tomato sauce tends to be a little runnier and oiler than most people are used to, but it tastes great. If you are used to it thicker or more stew-like, add some regular tomato sauce as well. But if you follow the recipe exactly, it still tastes great! And was very easy.

I didn't know what to expect from this dish. I couldn't quite imagine the combination of spices. But, since it got such good reviews and I had all the spices on hand, I gave is a try! And it was good! We drank an American Pinot Noir (Fleur de Carneros from the Napa Valley) with it and it was very nice. I used skinless, boneless chicken breast and they were way too dry. Will definately spring for a whole free-range chicken. The sauce is not a bright red marinara-type sauce, but a brownish, slightly spicy sauce. It is very rich and I have a feeling it is one of those dishes that will taste better the next day. One thing r.e. the recipe; It doesn't say to fish the whole spices out but I did anyway right before adding the tomato paste and vinegar. I had to use whole cloves b/c I had no ground and I didn't want anyone accidentally chomping down on one.

Wonderful. I made this for a potluck-certainly a crowd pleaser.

This recipe had many wonderful flavors all of which tasted marvelous. We took the suggestion of a previous comment and cut back on the liquids by about 1/2 and substituted water for chicken broth and added a bit of red wine. The base was more thick and stew-like, which we loved.

Leftovers dont always get eaten but these did! I found this recipe on the Krinos Foods website also. I made it with 1/2 cup of water and served it with rice which soaks up the liquid nicely as would orzo. We really liked the combination of spices. Very good, I will make it again.

I had a wonderful chicken dish in a Mediterranean restaurant called Kapamas. I haven't been able to find a recipe for Kapamas Chicken, but this sounds like it might be close. Do any of you know if this is a version of Kapamas? Thanks!!

My husband and I love this dish. I use red wine instead of red wine vinegar and season w/about 1.5 t salt, 3/4 t pepper and 1-2T cider vinegar at the end.

Simply fantastic. Unique combination of spices and red onion make this a dish with depth. Will make this a meatless dish next time. The sauce stood so well by itself that the chicken was a distraction. Try this recipe. If you have fresh tomatoes from the garden peel and chop them and use them in place of the canned. Pick a pasta that will cradle the sauce and don't be afraid to use Parmesan cheese if you can't find kefalotyri. Enjoy!

Outstanding!! The flavors in this dish blended beautifully. We're snowed in, so I used the only canned tomatoes I had in the house - Muir Glen Fire Roasted Tomatoes. They added a wonderful dimension to the dish. I'll never use anything else. Also, make sure to use a spaghetti noodle with some weight to it. Thin or very thin can't stand up to the sauce.

I'd give this 3.5 forks - very delicious with a savory blend of spices, and quite easy. We didn't use the cheese as suggested and honestly would recommend you taste the dish before you do - it really was so nice by itself. We cut down on the olive oil - didn't need quite that much. Bet it will be even better as day-later leftovers!!!

Didn't care for the spices combined with the tomato flavor. Maybe better with pork? Will not make this one again.

Pretty good for the level of work required. I think it might do better with red wine in the sauce (as opposed to red wine vinegar??). Not sure, just needs a little boost. Excellent with rice to soak up the sauce.

I didnot have a whole chicken, neither cinnamon sticks, neither whole allspice, neither tomato paste. So, I used chicken breasts, ground allspice, ground cinnamon, skiped tomato paste and used red wine instead of vinegar. I loved it. Excelent!!! Very easy to cook.

Combined with Garlicky Greek Salad and Pizza with Pesto and Smoked Salmon. A wonderful meal.

My husband and I made this for dinner tonight and we both think it is excellent. The flavors go so well together- it is very much like the sauce that accompanies the spanish meatball tapas at our favorite mediteranean restaurant. Next time we are going a little further with the spanish flavors and are going to add green spanish olives in the sauce. We served it over brown rice with braised brussels sprouts on the side. And it was very easy to make- minimal effort for maximum satisfaction!

My family really enjoyed this and I found it simple to make. Unfortunately I misread the recipe and did have whole allspice on hand - I used about 1/2 teaspoon of ground allspice instead. My young children raved (they are very picky)and my husband enjoyed. We will definately keep this recipe on hand.

GREAT! This recipe is just super and I know we'll make it often! Like another reviewer, I made it with boned skinless chicken, but this sauce is so terrific, I intend to use it as a regular tomato sauce for lots of other dishes! I also served it with rice and will probably serve the leftovers with pasta, can't wait!!! I did use the whole spices when they were called for and then just pulled them out when serving the dish.

This is a delicious blend of ingredients. If you're expecting a traditional Italian flavor you won't get it here. This reminded me of a delicious recipe in our famous Greek Town here in Chicago.

This dish has been a favorite in our house for several years. It's even more flavorful the next day. We skin the chicken before browning, and have found that substituting ground spices works great. We have it with perciatelli per the recipe, but skip the cheese.

Excellent, easy to make in my limited (galley) kitchen. It's a nice change from the usual tomatoe sauce. Special enough for company as well. I also find that the left overs freeze very well.

This dish was really bad. Those spices and tomato just don't go together, even though it sounded good on paper.
