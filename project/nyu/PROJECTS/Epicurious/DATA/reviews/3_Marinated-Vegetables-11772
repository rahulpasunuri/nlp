Because of my dislike for bell peppers I substituded a red poblano and a Hungarian Yellow. I also added one cut up zucchini squash. This was not a typical dish I would choose to prepare, but had the ingredients and the recipe was pretty healthy. Had a good taste and was able to use with a number of meals during the week.

As someone who has made MANY veg recipes..raw, marinated, etc...this was a BIG disapointment. don't waste your fresh veggies or time on this one. Really trust me.. I come from a long line of veggie experts....Skip this one!!!! Don't say I didn't warn you!

I expected something different; this was OK but seemed to miss something - I would suggest adding a splash of red wine vinegar for some zing.

This is a hwole new way of making vegetables but I would substitute vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. It is also good teh second day over rice.

I've made this dish numerous times, using a variety of available veggies. It's always a hit. I a personal chef and my low carb clients love this. It's great to have veggies ready to serve in the fridge. But try these quickly grilled for even more tastiness.

I was looking for a recipe for marinated mushrooms for my martinis and found this. I just used mushrooms though, about 1/2 cup more of vinegar more garlic, a dried hot cayenne, 1/4 of sugar, and of course my favorite ingredient, Mrs. Dash Seasoning Blend. I made and refrigerated a half of a flat of mushrooms. It's been 3 weeks and everyone likes them. Use either as an appitizer or for cocktails. They're great, and will need to make more shortly. I have the full recipe if you want it, e-mail bleumoon@centurytel.net

I made some substitutions in the herbs, omitting the coriander and pepper flakes and using fresh thyme, oregano and rosemary. I also used this marinade for mushrooms only and simmered them for about 7 minutes. It was excellent and I would make this again - very easy and seemingly lower in fat due to the broth. Most other recipes used at least 1 to 2 cups of oil!

This was an excellent accompanying dish to SHRIMP AND CRAB CANNELLONI. Easy to prepare, colorful, and enjoyed by all!
