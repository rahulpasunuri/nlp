Nice easy recipe. I will make it again. i used 5 baby octopus and 6 squid.

This was good, but I found it a lot of trouble to make. Dealing with the octopi was fun, but time-consuming, and I was disappointed by how little was left after they'd cooked. Still, the results were tasty and everyone liked it, so I might make it again if I got the urge for messing with octopus.

Absolutely perfect. I made it with baby octopus from Whole Foods, which I cut up and boiled in water with bay leaf, a dash of vinegar and a wine cork for one hour. The octopus was perfectly tender (the cork is an old Italian trick to tenderize octopus and it works) and the dressing perfectly balanced. A total winner.

This is a great spring salad. I boiled the octopus for 45 min. with some garlic, onion, and bay leaf. I also realized that I was missing a lemon and used a blood orange instead. I'd definitely make this again.
