The balance of flavors within this dip couldn't have been more perfect. It was fresh, vibrant and oh-so addicting!

This dip as written is not worth the effort. First, it just tasted of lemon juice. I saved it by adding more chickpeas, 1 tsp. cumin, a few tbsp olive oil and roasted garlic that I happened to have on hand. Delicious!

I made this exactly per the recipe, except I did not take the skins off the chick peas. It turned out nice and smooth any way. My one suggestion would be to puree the ingredients first without the cilantro, then add the cilatro towards the end. If you put the cilantro in at the beginning and puree it, the cilantro gets ground up so small that the dip takes on a greenish color. It was delicious!

I used canned garbonzo beans, and I added fresh mint. It was delish!!! The next day even better.

We love hummus and this was a wonderful variation. Very fresh and light. Not sure I would skin the chick peas next time-it was a fairly time consuming step that didn't seem to impact the overall dish.

This was a real winner at my last dinner party. A great alternative to Hummus, and a great summer appetizer.

This was a great alternative to normal hummus. I cooked the cannced chickpeas again in a pressure cooker then blanch them in the sink with ice cubes and cold water. The skins roll right off. Then, I put them in the freezer prior to mashing in the cuisinart. This makes the dip really creamy.

Did not think this was that great of recipe..was bland in flavor. I added roasted garlic and some sea salt to add additional flavor. I would not make again.

No skinning of chickpeas, a little extra yogurt to make it creamier - which worked well, and a dash of cumin and cayenne for kick...tasty!

If you feel you must skin the chick peas, try rolling them in a moist cotton kitchen towel without crushing them. I can't see any reason to go to all the trouble for this particular recipe.

This is the most easy and amazing dip and I always have these ingredients on hand. I have served this at several different parties and everyone asked for the recipe!

This is basically Mediterranean hummus without the tahini (sesame paste). I've found home-made hummus to be a little grainy if I don't cook the garbanzos (chickpeas) first. Still delicious, but only three forks for uncooked beans which make a grainy, gravelly dip.

This is a reasonably tasty alternative to hummus. I used canned chick peas, and did not skin them. I'm not sure why you'd skin the chick peas if you were just putting them in the food processor anyway, and my hummus recipe does not call for skinning them. It still comes out perfectly creamy.

Don't bother skinning the chickpeas. I also omitted the water and used more garlic. The active time for making the dip is more like 3 minutes, not 30!

Easy and awful. A total failure.

This is so easy. The hardest part is taking the skins off the chick peas. I will definitely make this again. How can you go wrong with delicious and easy?

I thought this was pretty good for a healthy dip. I liked it. However, it was a little salty for me. Next time I will "salt to taste" instead of adding the full amount that the recipe calls for.

i doubled the recipe and skinning all those babies was a pain but the end result was good. in the future i will stick with a traditional hummus recipe. everyone's buds are different though, worth trying for sure.

I did not skin each chickpea, and I don't think it affected the final product. I agree that it doesn't need extra garlic (and I add extra garlic to everything). A lighter, tangier alternative to hummus.

This one takes way more time to make than it does to eat. Skinning each individual chick pea was pretty labour intensive but worth. For a low fat snack, I would definitely make it again.

i love to serve this in the summer withdifferent types of veggie sticks. red and green bell peppers tast excellent dipped in this.

Do NOT accidentally mistake vanilla yogurt for plain yogurt! It will not substitute well. After I threw out the first batch, the second (plain yogurt) round was fine.

For a lowfat dip, this goes great with pita crackle bread (specialty supermarket). I've made this several times for gatherings where many are calorie conscious and it goes over well. I have found that extra garlic detracts from the flavor of the dip, so use exactly what the recipe states.

Love the taste of hummus? THis comes close. I cut back on the cilantro and used sour cream instead of yogurt. It made it richer.

I had doubled this for a large family gathering. I'm sorry, it may be low in fat, but it was also low in taste. Doubling the recipe, I added 6-7 garlic, more yogurt, sour cream, a little bit of olive oil, salt and pepper. Then....it was presentable and delicious and I will most definately do this again!

This dip was really easy to prepare and I loved the flavor - plus the fact that it's low-fat!
