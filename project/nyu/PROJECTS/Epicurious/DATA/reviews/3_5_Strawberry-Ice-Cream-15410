I have a batch of this in my ice cream maker as I write this. Sneaking a spoonful here and there, I have to agree with a previous reviewer that this is too sweet. I typically like sweet things, which is why I decided to listen to those who said it was fine. But in the end, I taste more sugar than strawberry. Moreover, I can really taste the lemon. I used the amount of lemon juice called for and had a fresh lemon. I don't know if anyone else experienced this problem. Also, this makes a lot more than a quart.I think I'm going to shop around for another strawberry ice cream recipe.

Like another reviewer's, mine turned out icy. I might try again and cook the fruit next time to reduce the water content. The flavor was delicious but texture very disappointing.

I only used 1 cup of sugar total due to other reviewers stating it was too sweet. I don't feel it was quite enough. Next time I'll use the full amount. My strawberries were fresh and pretty sweet by themselves so it just depends on your taste. Otherwise I thought this recipe is good. I will use it again. The recipe doesn't read right or incomplete toward the end. What I did, is I mixed the egg yolks with the cream before it got hot and cooked it all together then strained it. It worked well, the texture was perfect.

This was great! I used less than a cup of sugar in total - 1/2 cup in the custard and 1/2 cup in the strawberries. Also, only used 1 c cream and 2 cups milk, because that was all I had. It was very sweet and very creamy - I would use even less sugar next time. I will make this again!

Hmmm...this tasted wonderful when soft and fresh out of the ice cream maker, but after a night in the freezer it became icy and the texture was off. I think it has to do with the high water content of the strawberries...maybe wild or smaller local strawberries would be better.

Excellent! Easy to make and a hit with dinner guests young and old. Very creamy, not icy as described by some of the other reviews.

My husband's favorite ice cream is Strawberry, and he said this was the best he ever had. Better even than homemade ice cream stands. The just-picked, sweet strawberries probably made it even better.

This is the best strawberry ice cream I've ever had. I only mashed the strawberrys with a potato masher to keep the berries a little chunky. My mixture never quite "coated" the spoon after 15 minutes of cooking but the results turned out great.

Much too sweet! 1 1/2 cups of sugar makes this ice cream insipidly cotton-candy sweet. The fresh flavor of the cream is completely overpowered. However, the texture is perfect. Most of the other strawberry ice cream recipes I've seen call for just 1/2 cup of sugar. I'm going to cut the amount of sugar back to this amount the next time I make it.

Made this ice cream for friends while trying out an ancient ice cream maker from my grandmother's cellar. Since I'd never made ice cream before, I didn't expect great results. This was delicious! We only had bagged ice cubes, not crushed, but the texture was still creamy. Everyone enjoyed seconds. Easy and terrific.

this is the ultimate strawberry ice cream recipe, as far as i'm concerned. macerating the berries with sugar and lemon really brings out the flavor. YUM.

No complaints here...made this for a July 4 celebration, and it was divine. I overcooked the custard a bit and it separated. In an effort to save it, I let it cool a bit then whipped it up with an immersion blender (the industrial kind from Williams & Sonoma). It came together perfectly.

Forget about fancy recipes, this is the real deal.The directions are confusing unless you know how to make custard. When tiny bubbles form around the edge of the saucepan, slowly add about 1/2 c. of the hot liquid into the beaten eggs and mix well. Now slowly pour the egg mixture into the saucepan containing the hot liquid, whisking as you go. After the custard coated a spoon, I strained it and proceeded with the recipe. To chill it, I put it in my deep freezer, which was nearly empty at the time.

Perfect in its simplicity. I didn't have a lemon handy, and I didn't miss it. Also, the recipe yielded two quarts for me, instead of one. It was a huge hit and I've made it twice in the last month with the garden's fresh strawberry yield.

Made last night and churned today for a BBQ. EXCELLENT. Doubled recipe. Used 3c cream, 3c milk and just 1 egg & 2 egg yolks (less custard-like). Used 2lbs strawberries (could use more) and pureed 1/3 and added diced of rest. Let strawberries sit w/ sugar and Eureka lemon (the best). Added a dash of salt. Perfect right out of the maker - no need to freeze. Making again next month for my daughter's second birthday... Can't wait!!

This fresh ice cream was definately a treat but I found the instructions to be labour intensive. I have made ice cream before so I knew where to make the short cuts, but for a person who is new at the art, this could be a challenge. Definately helps to have a ice cream maker!

Impossible to rate this recipe or say whether I'd make it again. The first 3 ingredients are listed in the directions. What about the last 4??
