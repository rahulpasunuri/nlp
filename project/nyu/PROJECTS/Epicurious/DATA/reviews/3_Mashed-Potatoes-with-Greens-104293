Once in a while, I run into a recipe for something that I have been making without a recipe for ages. This is one of them. Seems so humble, yet this is a great "comfort-carbs dish". I make something similar to this, only I add garlic to my mashed potatoes. I often give my collards flavor by adding a few bits of fried bacon or salt pork, and some sauteed onion or shallot. Much faster than boiling the ham hock. Here's a tip: for older greens that seem a bit bitter, add a pinch or two of sugar to neutralize.
