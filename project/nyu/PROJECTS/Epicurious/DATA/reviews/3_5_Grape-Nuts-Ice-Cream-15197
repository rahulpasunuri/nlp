Oh yeah! This is as good as the homemade Grape-Nuts ice cream at Butterfield's in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine, which is the best I've tasted. The vanilla ice cream mellows the pronounced grain flavor of the cereal, and the Grape-Nuts makes an amazing crunch in the freshly made ice cream. I don't bother with the double-boiler method--I heat the cream in the microwave, whisk the eggs/sugar constantly as I pour it in, then put it in a heavy saucepan over medium-low heat and whisk constantly till it reaches 170 degrees, then pass it through a fine strainer.
