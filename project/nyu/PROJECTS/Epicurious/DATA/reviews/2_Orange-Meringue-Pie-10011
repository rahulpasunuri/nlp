I increased the egg yolks to 6 (although I think 5 would have done the job) and decreased the OJ to 2C and the lemon juice to 1T. I added 1/8t of orange extract in case the juice wasn't enough for flavor, but I think I would have been just fine without it. No watery problems and we LOVED the pie.

Mine turned out watery too.

Very delicious flavor, but I found it to be watery the next day. I will try one more time and use a little more cornstarch than called for.

Great pie! It's a little time consuming but worth it. A few suggestions: 1. I'd use butter instead of shortening in the crust. 2. This makes a HUGE pie. I ended up baking the extra crust and putting the excess filling into custard cups to make a couple of mini pies.
