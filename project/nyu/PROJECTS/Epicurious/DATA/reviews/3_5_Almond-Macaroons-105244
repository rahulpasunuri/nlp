This is a great low carb cookie. I substituted Splenda for the sugar equally. It was delicious.

These were very easy, but don't make anything like 30 cookies (how could they with those ingredients?). And I thought they were just so-so: I'm looking for a chewy macaroon that's also somehow a little fluffy.

Incredibly quick and easy, yet chewy, sweet, and delicious.
