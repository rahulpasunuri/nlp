This is a great recipe, what i did was instead of white wine vineger, I used raspberry vineger . It gave it slight fruity taste that is perfect for late spring and early summer...

The salad was pretty good, a good way to use up leftover cucumbers and best of all, easy and quick to prepare.

Loved the flavors but next time will slice the veggies a bit thicker.

This is simple but tasty salad, My daughter really enjoyed it, even though she doesn't like vegetables all that much. I substituted rice vinegar for white wine vinegar.

Refreshing, colourful and easy to make--but I prefer using fewer cucumbers and more carrots.
