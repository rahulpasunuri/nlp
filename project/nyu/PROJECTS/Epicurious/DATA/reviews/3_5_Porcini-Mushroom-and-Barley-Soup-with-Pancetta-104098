This soup was very tasty but something was missing.... Italian spices? Tomatoes? I added the juice of 1/2 lemon for brightness and used spinach because I had no kale, but this is not a "wow" recipe. If you are used to the taste of dried porcini as part of the soup, there are better recipes out there.

Not 4 forks but really really good and hearty. I wanted to make it with what was already in my kitchen so I used bacon and spinach instead of pancetta and chard. No matter, it was great that way & I'd do the same again. My hubby commented that it tasted "really beefy" with the mushrooms in spite of the fact that water & chicken broth were the majority of the broth. And yes the other reviewers are right, you'll need to add more water or stock.

I had high hopes for this soup but it didn't quite do it for me. On top of the porcini, I added some mixed dried mushrooms as well as fresh crimini. I still felt as if something was missing. Will be looking for a different barley soup.

excellent. i added 3/4 lb of diced fresh mushrooms. i substitued kielbasa and dill for the greens and pancetta. consistency was perfect, taste is divine. oh the beef consomme was onion soup flavored which i think gave added taste.

really delicious. i made some substitutions. i used low fat kielbasa instead of the pancetta. i added 3/4 of a lb of fresh mushrooms to the dried. i omitted the greens but added dill as a side condiment. i served with pirogi and natural applesauce and savory artisan crackers. a perfect fall dinner.

Excellent. Followed the recipe exactly with great results, but I agree with the previous cooks that more water/broth may be needed to achieve a "soupy' texture. Will include this in my collection for sure!

Three and a half. Outstanding. One word to the wise, though: don't overdo it on the pancetta or the salt will overpower all else. Spinach works fine, though not as sweet.

Easy, flavorful, filling soup. Add biscuits and you have a meal. I adapted the recipe a bit. I left out the celery because I simply don't like it. I used asparagus cut into 3/4-1" pieces that I sauteed seperately until just beginning to brown. I added the asparagus about 10 minutes before the soup was done. I didn't use any sliced greens because I didn't want to bother with that. It took more than 40 minutes of simmering to get nice plump barley. Shaved, not grated Romano is a must! Next time I'm going to double the recipe because I didn't have any leftovers.

Simple recipe and very flavorful with the porcinis. The liquid was soaked up by the barley so you need to add additional liquid if you're having it the next day.

I followed the recipe exactly up until I was about to serve, but I found that I needed more broth. No problem; I added another can of stock and it was just fine. The flavor was uncommon and delicious! I had a party with lots of kids and I didn't exepect them to eat this, but they all did and some asked for more, but alas, it was all gone.

Made this for a casual dinner party and while everyone complimented it, it didn't get rave reactions. The porcini flavor was nice, but somehow it just didn't 'wow' me.

This recipe was so good, I fixed it twice in one week! The combination is wonderful, and like most soups the flavors get better after reheating. I brushed the porcini the first time but still had grit at the bottom of the pot, so I quick-rinsed them in a strainer the second time (right before adding to the pot) and didn't have grit at all.

Looking for the ultimate wow~ soup this is it with a few alterations. I subbed in 1 portobello mushroom for the porcinis (these are pricey) and simmered it with the veggies, I put in only 1 cup beef and 1 cup chicken broth, 2 cups of water, 1/2 cup white wine, an equal portion of pot barley (better for you) and it is fantastic.The ultimate good for your soul recipe.

this recipe is very easy to follow. i use low salt broth to offeset the saltiness of the pancetta. other kinds of mushrooms can be substituted and i omit the chard. my family loves it.

This is an excellent recipe -- I've made it twice now. It stands up well to improvisation (e.g. I didn't have celery or carrots the first time, so I used Chinese leaf celery and no carrots -- plus I had no pancetta so I used bacon -- and it was still delicious). My only gripe is that it is a bit salty (at least if you use bacon), so I'd use low-salt broth the next time around. BTW, occasionally you can buy dried porcini mushrooms in bulk at large-scale stores like Costco, making this recipe considerably cheaper...

A good winter, "stick to the ribs" kind of soup. I enjoyed the different textures of the barley, pancetta, and chard. Was pretty salty, if I did it again I would definitely make sure I had low-salt broths. It can definitely be a complete meal w/ a salad and some french bread. A side note: I had the same problem with the grit in the bottom from the mushrooms and also I noticed that the chard is pretty dirty when bought.

This is a delicious hearty winter soup. As it was my first time using porcini mushrooms,I appreciated the tip about brushing them.

Delicious and easy - I'm a novice and it still tasted great and came together without me getting frustrated! Two notes - it's not cheap. Special ingredients I didn't have cost me around $19. Also, where it says to brush grit from porchini mushrooms - do it! I couldn't see anything so I didn't worry about it, but I sure tasted the grit in the soup. It was tasty anyway!

I would definitely make this recipe again. I loved the rich flavor of this soup. The Porcini mushrooms made this recipe! I made this recipe for company and 5 people asked me for the recipe.
