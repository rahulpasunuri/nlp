Yummy! I had fun making and shaping the dough. Tasted like the Japanese gyoza. A friend recommended adding a bit of vinegar to the mixture.

Ditched the ginger and used extra fatty pork chops (finely chopped) instead of ground pork. All in all, a good recipe, however, I did have a bit of trouble getting enough dough. Small problem though, just make more.

Great receipe. Used won-ton rounds found at the local market. Substituted pork for chicken (less fat). Lightened the ginger, halfed the soy sauce, added garlic. Sauted the meat, scallions, ginger thoroughly first. wrapped in won ton, fried the combinaton then boiled.

Great recipe.. I also added minced garlic, some finely chopped yellow onion, and a pinch of 5 spice powder. I also added a tsp of 5 spice powder and some salt to the flour before making the dough. Scrumptious

Yum. Added garlic and cut back on ginger, but also added goodies like sliced water chestnuts for a bit of crunch and some chicken stock and rice vinegar so they'd be especially juicy. For some kick in the sauce add a good squirt of sriracha (hot chili sauce)- available at asian markets.

This is fabulous! I agree with the comment about less ginger. Next time, I am going to substitute the ginger I take away with garlic to add another flavor.

FABULOUS Here are some changes to improve this great recipe: reduce ginger, add garlic and cilantro to filling, add some chinese chili oil or some red pepper flakes to filling, and try cooking them using a pressure cooker. Easy and delicious once you get the hang of it!

I substituted chopped frozen cooked shrimp. Defrosted them in cold water, added green onion, cilantro, ground up fresh ginger and garlic. The recipe called for too much ginger in my opinion, but this may have been because I used shrimp and not ground meat. Still, watch out. The wrapper preparation can be simplified. I agree, homemade dough is worth the hassle. But if you are awful with dough like I am, just make the dough and leave it in a lump in the bowl. Break off pieces one at a time and roll into individual wrapper sheets (no need to get the shape perfect, but make sure the edges are thin). Put some filling in and pinch the sides. Repeat until the big dough ball is all gone and you've got a bunch of dumplings. MUCH less complicated and just as effective as the recipe instructions. I recommend pressure cooking the dumplings on the stove. This results in wrinkly, thin, delicious wrappers, even if you are clumsy like me and made them thick. Pressure cooker is fabulous. I steamed some in my rice cooker (plug in type) but the wrappers did not turn out as well. I did not try boiling as pressure cooking is easier and is delicious.

Absolutely delicious!! My hubby won't shut up about this one and he's a picky eater!! I had to cut the recipe down to 1/3 because I was only serving two people. It worked out just as perfectly and I added 1-2 tsp minced garlic. A must-try recipe.

I added garlic and pepper to the pork mixture. Instead of boiling them, I steamed them. They were really good. I will make them again when I have the time.

Great recipe for dumpblings. I think that there is something unique to making the dough yourself. It does add quite a bit more work to the process though. I would have liked to have seen a nice sauce included with the recipe

Great recipe. I also added the garlic and peppers, as well as used the store bought dumpling dough rather than rolling my own. Since my wife and I do not eat pork, we substituted with ground chicken instead. Excellent.

Delicious! If you use the store-bought wrappers, these are super easy as others have commented. Easy to experiment with too. I like the addition of black pepper and Japanese pepper (sansho) and a little garlic.

I've frozen dumplings after assembling them before, but not after cooking them. They turn out well this way and can be cooked from frozen.

does anyone know if these can be cooked and then frozen, or will they will they end up gummy and nasty when thawed?

the meat smelled great marinating but the taste was blah. too much effort for very little gain.i'll stick to take-out.

Fantastic! Made it even easier by buying the pre-made wonton skins. So added shredded carrots to the filling to add some flavor along with some chinese 5-spice powder.

This recipe was great! I made the following changes to make it even easier. First, I purchased premade wonton wrappers. Second, when assembling the dumplings, I lined the baking sheet with damp paper towels, this made a big difference in them holding their shape. Lastly, I froze 31 of the 47 which the batch made for later. To freeze, place the assembled dumplings on a baking sheeted lined with was paper; the dumplings should not touch. Place the sheet in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes. When they are frozen, just peel them off the wax paper and toss in a marked freezer bag. Just steam and serve when you want some. I will add garlic and salt & pepper to the pork mixture and possible let it marinade for longer too.

Wow!! These are excellent!! I added some garlic in the pork mixture and let me tell you. These are great. I also made some eggdrop soup with this meal and added some angelhair pasta in it. This is one dish I will be sure to make again
