Have made this twice, once with tenderloin and once with ribeyes. Not as great as it sounds. Better to marinate the steak with Thomas Sauce than using this.

This recipe was a big success. The peppers were perfect.

This is a great steak recipe when you want to serve something really special. The pepper is sauce is wonderful. The dish has good presentation and not too time consumer. Excellent with hash browns and a good cab!

The recipe was not bad but I was in no way plussed by the taste of the dish. See for yourself, you may like beef more than I. The dish merits 2.6 forks.

This was a hit! Easy to make but elegant. I have made it with and without the peppers and both ways are great. I have also done the steaks whole, with just the marinade.

The steak was excellent. I used less anchovie than called for (4 fillets). What really made this meal however was the carmelized onions and roasted garlic that I served on top of the steak. It was divine!

Great recipe for a dinner party. The combination of roasted peppers and steak enhances the flavor of both tremendously. Will try with a simple arugula salad next time. Definitely a winner.

I used this marinade with a roast, and substituted white wine and two tbs of olive oil for the olive oil. It was AMAZING! I rotisserized this and will make it again and again!

Great, easy recipe, very interesting flavor which was not overpowered by the anchovies. I marinated the steaks overnight and also did the the peppers a day ahead so this was very easy for entertaining. I served the steaks unsliced. Besides the peppers I served 'An Even Greated Caesar Salad' BA 2/96 and 'Hot & Smoky Beans' BA 7/99, and for desert 'Peach-Amaretto Sundaes' BA 8/99 - wonderful menu.

What a delightful surprise and contributions the anchovies made. A caesar salad is the perfect accompaniment. Beaujolais was good, but champagne helps celebrate the intense favors.
