Very yummy.............liked the addition of spinach and olives to my usual bean salad. Used canned beans and adjusted for 2 servings

It looks like everyone put a spin on this recipe...which is great! I omitted the spinach & treated the beans, olive oil as a base to mix with spinach, arugula, or spring baby greens for lunch. I agree that I didn't care for the mozzarella, but loved the marinated feta idea which really worked great! An amazing base to mix with many great greens, will never get tired of this!

My husband I LOVED this salad. I added blanched green beans (thank you Giada)...flavor was EXCELLENT. Will be enjoying again and again!

I was short on time and used a can of rinsed/drained cannelini beans. The beans and fresh mozzarella made this satisfying and easy as a main course. We added a handful of toasted, chopped pecans just before serving. Yum.

I found this to be an unusual combination of flavors, but I liked it. I substituted canned cannolini (sp?) beans.

This was a very good, simple recipe. I left out the mozarella and added garlic with the onions. Will make again.

I had been craving white bean/protein anything & saw this recipe-had a can of cannelini beans that I rinsed, used the red onion in the frig(raw), my own oven-dried plum tomatoes that are jarred in olive oil, chopped fresh basil(had no spinach)and used rice vinegar(for the sweetness) in the vinaigrette. I was in protein heaven and ate the whole thing myself. More of a salad but so danged good.

Also used it as a summer main dish dinner. Very nice.

It's totally ridiculous to boil the beans for 45 minutes when quick-soaking. This is the way to do it: boil them vigorously for 2 minutes and turn of the heat. Put a lid on it and let stand for 1 hour. Then cook them for 40 to 60 minutes, depending on the age of the beans.

Since I'm vegan I omitted the chees and added roasted garlic cloves. A beautiful and delicious salad! Photo at PicksOverPeas dot com.

I used this recipe more as a base and played off of it. The spinach was omitted entirely, shifting the focus instead to the beans themselves. I also added some lentils to compliment the navy bean. White onion instead of yellow, added garlic to it while cooking. I also threw in some chicken broiled in lemon/lime juices with rosemary. The recipe was changed pretty drastically, but I still credit this as the inspiration. And it was a hit.

This was excellent. I left out the onions to appease one guest and it was still a hit! I made it in the morning and added the spinach just before serving. I only used about 1 cup of the spinach and it was fine. I served it with the Wild Mushroom Bread Pudding on this site and the Lemon/Oregano roast turkey.

This was really good. I added capers and it really had good flavor.

I made this salad, and the flavors were good, but the texture got so yucky after the dressing had been on it for a bit; the spinach got soggy and the beans started to break down and get mushy. I even reduced the amount called for in the recipe! So, I would advise to only use a *little* dressing (it doesn't need much) and put it on *right before* serving. Like another reviewer, I also used the Cook's Illustrated dressing with lemon, olive oil, carlic, capers and thyme. I added olives and feta, too. It's a pretty salad, but you need to be careful with it.

I served this at a party and it was a huge hit. The dressing was so easy to make - so, don't skip it! Although, you will not need the full cup. I recommend that you add it to taste. I used a red onion (it is what I had on hand) and baby pearl fresh mozzarella in place of the plain moz, which was a novel touch.

Delicious and very popular with everyone at a recent party I took it to. I used half feta cheese and half fresh mozzarella, which made a great combo.

I am always looking for a light summer no- cook entrees and I think this could be one. I halved the recipe using canned cannelini beans and baby spinach. I used a Mediterranean dressing from Cook's Illustrated (lemon, olive oil, garlic, capers and thyme) The dressing was fabulous with the other flavors. For an entree the proportions are wrong and the next time I will double the spinach and halve the beans. Great recipe!

This was very good! Took to a gathering and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Used 3 cans Cannellini beans and 1 bag baby spinach. Next time I will add fresh tomatoes!

I made this for an Easter dinner with friends, and enjoyed it. I prepared it early that morning and let the salad (minus spinach) marinate in the dressing, then when I was ready to serve, I tossed it with spinach. It was a little dressing-heavy, so next time I won't marinate the salad in all the dressing. Otherwise, it was superb.

this is a great recipe!! i used a bottled dressing as well, newmans light sun dried tomato vinaigrette ( plus 3-4 tbl of balsamic vinegar for a little more punch) and added avocados as well. i chopped up the spinach to make it easier to eat. i will definitely make this again!

I will definitely make this recipe again with the following alterations. My changes yielded plenty of salad for a pot lunch luncheon and some to take home. I substituted 2-19 ounce cans cannellini beans, 1 6 ounce bag baby spinach from Trader Joe's (3 cups), Mediterranean Feta from TJs instead of mozzarella, and Bernstein's Red Zinfandel w/Shallot and Basil instead of the Italian Vinaigrette.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe as I usually do for any new recipe---it was great, everyone loved it. To save time, I used 3 cans of cannellini beans the next time and it was still just as tasty and wonderful. It makes for a great pot luck dish, especially for an outdoor summer party!

My husband loved this salad; I thought it was fine. It's easy and uses ingredients that I have on-hand, which guarantees that I'll make it again.

I used canned beans, red onion - uncooked thanks to the reviews, and fresh oregano in the vinaigrette. I added juice of a whole lemon and thought that really made the flavor pop. Next time I want to try the dried beans and mix everything except the spinach the day before to give the flavors time to meld. This would be good with a piece of grilled chicken on top for an entrée salad or as part of a buffet as a side dish. I would add very small cherry tomatoes halved in addition to the sun-dried for a better presentation for entertaining.

Great salad. I used the feta as a substitute. The first time I made it I thought the garlic was too sharp raw in the dressing. So, I cooked the garlic with the onions and hit hte nail on the head. I did increased the garlic when I cooked it with the onions. Great the next day as well!

I loved this salad and so did my guests. I added feta and next time I will use it again but omit the mozzerella. I used a bottled Italian dressing (Garlic Expressions). It was as good as left-overs as it was initially.

I didn't think that this salad went over so well at Easter Dinner, however I have had multiple requests for the recipe! I loved it and so did others.

Really yummy and quick for an easy weeknight dinner. And so healthy, especially if you left out the cheese. I used feta instead of mozzarella, because that's what I had on hand. Next time I might not use both olives and sun-dried tomatoes - both have rather strong flavors, so really only one is needed.

I altered this quite a bit, using the recipe as a guide - capers instead of olives, arugula instead of spinach, lemon and olive oil instead of vinegrette. I also added grated romano. Delicious!

Excellent. I prepared the vinaigrette per the recipe and ended up with a bit too much. Used dried beans, and I think it made a big difference. You could use canned, but they will not be as firm. Don't skimp on the olives or sun dried tomatoes.

Wow! Very good. I also cheated on the beans and used canned Cannelinis. I chose Newman's Own Balsamic Vinagrette for the dressing and it went very well with the other flavors. Easy and filling meal. Goes great with a baguette.

Great summer salad dish! Especially when I don't feel like cooking. Very filling. I cheated on the beans, too. Used canned cannellini's. And, like another reviewer I didn't cook the onions...I agree, they're better raw. After reading the review from the "other" cook from Tampa, I decided to use a balsamic vinegar and virgin olive oil dressing similar to the one prepared by Michael and Barbara the other day on Epicurious. And, speaking of curious...if food is too awful for human consumption, why do people give it to their dogs? Do dogs actually eat that stuff? I know if we won't eat it, the cat won't go near it. Thanks, I'm through now.

I found this to be an EXCELLENT dish for a summer get-together. In addition to the listed ingedients, I added a minced roasted jalapeno, which gave it that little "extra something". For a leftover dish, I tossed in grilled chicken breasts.....YUMM YUMM!! Enjoy!

We each had one serving, the rest went to the dog. I think it was the italian vinegarette we didnt like.

if you use inferior ingrediants you get inferior results. that is probably the most important rule in any thing you will ever cook.

Yum! This was excellent. I used canned Great Northern beans (four cans) instead of Navy, and it turned out really tasty. I made it about four times for dinner parties and everyone wants the recipe. I don't cook the onions, I like them raw.

I couldn't find any canned or dried navy beans so I used white Great Northern. I cooked them as per instructions but they seemd overdone and kind of mushy. To save time I also used Paul Newman's Italian Vinaigrette dressing. The sun dried tomatoes at Safeway were not in oil and the mozzarella was the normal packaged kind. Anyway, my son hated this recipe and I wasn't crazy about the final result either. It just didn't work for me. After the first servings the rest ended up in the garbage.

This is a great healthy recipe. The textures and flavors come together very well. I also use a 1/3 cup bottled Italian vinaigrette to cut prep time.

This was a nice salad. I made it for an italian potluck, everyone loved it. There were no leftovers. I omitted the beans as I forgot to get the at the store, but it was great anyways.

Served this today as a side salad with sandwiches. We really loved it. My husband, who does not like beans said it is his new favorite. Absolutely delicious. I am going to make it next Saturday again for company. You could use a stronger cheese like feta however there are lots of strong flavors to compete and we thought the mozarella was fine. Can't wait to taste the left overs tomorrow for lunch.
