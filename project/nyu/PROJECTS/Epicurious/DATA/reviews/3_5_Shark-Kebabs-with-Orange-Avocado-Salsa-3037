A disclaimer: so I modified the recipe a bit. I used salmon, pan-seared instead of broiled, seasoned w/salt & pepper. I added corn & green onions instead of serrano pepper & red onion, since that was what I had. The corn really adds to it. Forgot the garlic & didn't miss it. Served over quinoa. Fresh-tasting & fantastic!

This receipe is very original and very tasty with a lot of different interesting tastes. I didn't have a grill so just cooked the fish in a pan (without the skewers) and it worked very well too! The fish was very moist and tender...!

Loved this recipe! Even the kids liked the shark. Followed sashi2's advice and added sea salt to the recipe and grilled. Wonderful.

We love this recipe. Have made it twice now and my kids and husband eat it up. We grill it and use a different avocado salsa recipe (the oranges are great in the marinade but too much for us in the salsa.)

This recipe was excellent. My husband loved it so much he ate way too much. Salsa was great by itself and I will definitely make this again for guests in the future. I think it would be equally good with halibut or another fish.

Do not overdo the shark & it will be very juicy and tender. Time it as the receipy says. The salsa is excelent. It can even be served separetly or with any fish. Don't forget to salt the fish, the receipy doesn't mention it.

We didn't make the salsa, only the shark with the marinade. With all the chili powder, I'm surprised that anyone could call this marinade bland. I thought it was very flavorful, and I plan on trying it again with a different fish. My husband and I didn't care for the texture of shark so we're going to use whole fillets of something more delicate like tilapia. This would also work great for salmon or tuna. It was also a creative way to use ingredients at hand for the marinade. Very nice recipe.

This recipe was delicious, as always when i cook i was a little heavy handed with most of the ingredients, obviously if you did not like this one, you made it wrong.

Marinade was very bland and shark came out chewy; would not waste shark or any other fish on this marinade again.

My husband gave this dish 4 forks, and he doesn't give ANYTHING 4 forks! Best of all, it was so easy to make! I stuck with the original salsa recipe with the olive oil and lemon juice, but I might try the balsamic next time - that sounds great.

My husband and I live on the Gulf coast.. We cooked the shark we caught this afternoon.. WOW...GREAT!!!!I didn't change a thing... but added a little olive oil and balsalmic vinager to the salsa.. tossed them on the grill..and pigged out!!! we enjoyed it very much. I think next time I'll try mandarin oranges After a long day of fishing it was very easy to make.. We still have more shark left over to try your other great recipes..(we use this site constantly.) Thanks "Y'all"

I forgot to put the chili in the salsa, but without it all was eaten. We served the shark with fresh corn tortillas, some shredded red cabbage and the salsa. It was delicious.
