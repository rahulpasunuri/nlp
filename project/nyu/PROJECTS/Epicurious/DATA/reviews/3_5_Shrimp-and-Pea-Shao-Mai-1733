Overall, these were delicious! The filling was simple yet complex in flavor. We didn't use a processor but hand chopped everything and came up with a chunkier filling. We didn't have a steamer so we improvised and made gyoza by boiling the dumplings then pan-searing them. They turned out great and were the hit of our debut catering endeavor! The sauce was awesome and everyone used it on almost everything. Very versatile sauce. However, we did add freshly squeezed orange juice to complement the sesame oil. This dish is a party must-have!

A flavorful and authentic-tasting recipe. Easy to make in larger quantities and freeze since it steams best after freezing as opposed to merely chilling. I have also made this by substituting scallops for the shrimp. My family loved these.
