The dressing described here is so heavy on the soy sauce! Urgh! I ended up using just half and draining off most of it. I added the juice of one grapefruit to the dressing and that really improved it and made it taste more like the restaurant version.

I have had this salad at Slanted Door and it is very tasty. I made it tonight and it turned out really well, it is an interesting combination of flavors. I squeezed the water of of the cabbage and jicama before using, otherwise it might turn out soggy. I skipped the carrots (not a fan). I only used 1 grapefruit and it seemed like that was enough. I think the mint leaves were overpowered - maybe I didn't use enough. I would think that the quality of the soy sauce is very important. Very yummy - this can be served to guests!

Okay, I logged on to find something similar to the FABULOUS salad I had at the Slanted Door a few weeks back and here it was! I can't believe my luck! This salad is absolutely delicious and refreshing. A great dish for summer. I had them with fresh spring rolls at the restaurant and it was a great combination. I love rice wine vinegar and try to keep our sodium down so I'll probably add a little more vinegar and cut the soy sauce down a bit. Can't wait to try it!

I thought this was just ok -- i added some extra virgin sesame oil to help give it a little more flavor. The mint and the candied nuts make this. I will try it again -- perhaps with a little more hot pepper and lime juice.

Delicious -- though the jicama could probably be left out if you don't have it, since it's very mild and I barely noticed it. Dressing was simple and tart. We tried topping it with a sprinkle of blue cheese instead of the nuts -- very nice.

soo easy and delicious. i couldn't find jicama at the store, and as someone said it didn't stand out anyway, i skipped it and cut carrots into matchsticks instead. i also substituted fresh california navels for the grapefruit. a friend gave them to me from her tree, and they were a little tart - perfect, as they did not have the bitterness of grapefruit. the dressing is the best - the ginger is a fabulous flavor in there. my boyfriend professed not liking ginger prior to eating this dish, but he couldn't stop eating it. i served it with the chicken claypot (also on this site), subbing shrimp for the chicken. it was a delicious and memorable combo.

This is so yummy and a great way to take advantage of delicious grapefruit in the winter time. It's very quick and easy and makes great leftovers. If I had some sort of food processor to julienne the jicama I'd rather do that than shred it because the jicama didn't stand out in the dish.
