The goat-cheese crostini were excellent, but I found the vinagrette to be much too hot. I had to dilute it with lemon juice and add sugar until I could get it to a level that wouldn't give my Great-Aunt an ulcer! It's a good idea, but I feel the salad would be much more enjoyable with a lighter, more citrus-based vinagrette.
