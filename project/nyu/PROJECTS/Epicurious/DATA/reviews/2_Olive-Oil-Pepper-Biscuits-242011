I used a combination of 1/2 cup cake flour and 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (King Arthur), and the dough held together just fine; but it leached olive oil all over! I used a cutting board to roll them out, since the counter got way too oily, but that was fine, since my cutting board was getting dry anyway. These are very labor intensive, but they are absolutely delicious when done. Very addictive! I only rated 3 forks because of the time involved in making them, but they were easy enough, and seriously good when done.

Dough would not hold together, even after resting an hour. I looked up other recipes online and found most included egg. I added half an egg to my dough and I was able to proceed with the recipe. The results were good.
