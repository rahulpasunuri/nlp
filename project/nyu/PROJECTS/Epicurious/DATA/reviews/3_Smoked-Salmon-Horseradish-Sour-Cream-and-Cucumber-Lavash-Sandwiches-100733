I found the sandwiches to be too drippy from the sour cream. I will make them again, but use cream cheese instead.

I love the ingredients and the use of so many healthy vegis, but the combination was way too "peppery" for my taste. Saltiness wasn't a problem, even though I didn't rinse the capers. Maybe the horseradish made it a little strong? I think I'll go back to my smoke salmon, potato latke, sour cream, and watercress combo.

I think you're right... since the recipe doesn't even call for salt. My boyfriend doesn't like cucumbers and for him I substituted scallions (he's an onion freak). :)

I think the previous reviewer may have used capiers packed in salt. I increased the horseradish and loved it.

The recipe calls for way too much capers. Capers and salt (from the salmon) was all I could taste. I won't waste my time on this again.
