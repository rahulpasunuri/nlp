This recipe was absolutely delicious and amazing and was relatively simple. Great for a dinner party, because so much can be done in advance. All you have to do is pull it out of the fridge and top it with the granita and pomegranate arils. I actually would skip the syrup next time. I think the granita is so flavorful and makes such a generous amount that you don't really need the syrup. I seeded the pomegranate before my party, too, and just stored the arils in the fridge to make assembly even faster. This is a winner of a recipe and I will definitely make it again.

This recipe turned out amazing and exactly how I was imagining it in the whole month before I actually made it for Thanksgiving. The pomegranate and white chocolate are a great pairing; they really balance each other out but are both very decadent.

The mousse and the granita/syrup provide the most mouthwatering contrast of flavors. I'll be making this again for a Christmas party. The granita makes much more than you'll need for the 6 servings and I had leftover syrup, too. I think you can also use just the syrup or the granita and get the same great taste sensation.

The white chocolate and pomegranate complement each other really well. I couldn't find pomegranate juice so just drizzled pomegranate molasses (available at Middle Eastern grocers) over the mousse. I tried to freeze the molasses, but I guess there is too much sugar in it to freeze. I will probably try to thin it out a bit next time with water or another juice to make the granita. I estimated on the proportions for the cream and creme fraiche (no measuring cups here) and the mousse remained like a thick pudding. I don't think this mousse was meant to be light and fluffy, though, since it contains no egg whites. The creme fraiche probably cuts the cloying sweetness which some find unappealing in other white mousse recipes. I might add more of the whipped cream next time to make it a little lighter, though. White with red--beautiful for the holidays!
