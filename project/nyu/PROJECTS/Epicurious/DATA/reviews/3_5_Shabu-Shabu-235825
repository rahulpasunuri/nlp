I've had this in a restaurant and loved it, but was quite disappointed as this recipe was quite bland. I do want to make again as I believe it is a fun dish and can be delicious. Will try with chicken broth next time. Also not happy with the sauces. Will keep checking online for other options.

@spindriftscd, the sauces are in a separate little container. You swish the meats and veggies in the broth, and then you dip them in the sauce. I like to layer the swished bits over rice donburi-style and then top with ponzu before eating.

How do you eat this soup with the sauces?

okay "A Cook from Grand Rapids, MI" - you added ginger, used veg stock and crab instead of tofu? You made a different recipe, so why rate this one? I'm sure your recipe was good, but has nothing to do with this. :)

Great recipe but for me it is easier to go to Little Tokyo here in Los Angeles and have someone else prepare it and serve me.

This was a real treat, but I did make some changes. I did use vegetable broth (with a chunk of ginger root in the pot) instead of water, and baby bok choy instead of cabbage, and since we're not big fans of tofu, and I had a couple of crab legs in the freezer, I shelled them and used that meat. But the big change I made is that when we were all well into our meal, I added more broth to the pot, brought it to a boil, and added Soba noodles which I then served up in bowls with the broth. That part was great.

Tasty, easy, fun and healthy. I used a mixture of chicken broth and water. And I added some glass noodles because I love glass noodles.

Very good and very fun for company. However, I would cook in some sort of stock instead of the water next time as it could use a bit more flavor.

This is a quick and fun way to enjoy dinner with family and friends. My suggestion is to substitute the water with chicken or beef stock/broth. Any combination of meats,poultry,seafood and vegetables can work. Bon Appetit
