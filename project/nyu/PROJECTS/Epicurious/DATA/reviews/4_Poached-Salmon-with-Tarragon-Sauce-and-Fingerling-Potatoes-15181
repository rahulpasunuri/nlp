Was a bit hesitant about the sauce after reading some of the reviews but it turned out perfect. Everyone at the dinner party raved about the sauce and the salmon was cooked just right. This is a keeper.

I have made this recipe about 10 times over the years. Great for Sunday brunch or a cool summer meal.

This was a real hit. Couldn't find fingerling potatoes, so I used blue and red new potatoes instead, which added a nice colour to the dish. I halved the mayo portion, double the tarragon and used a few tablespoons of seasoned rice vinegar (the only one I could find...). This recipe is a keeper!

The sauce was too sweet and if I were to make this again, I would omit the rice wine vinegar or prepare a classic tarragon sauce.

This is a favorite summer recipe for guests. My husband hates tarragon so I have made it substituting basil, dill, cilantro for the tarragon and they all work. The best thing about it is all you have to do when the guests arrive is steam the potatoes and everyone loves it.

The sauce is delicious! I always use Hellman's Lite mayo. Everyone asks for the recipe once they taste it. Fabulous as the dressing for chicken salad also.

We followed this dish exactly (except omitting the blender part) and it came out delicious and refreshing. The sauce definitely made the recipe.

Fixed this for Easter for those who couldn't/wouldn't eat ham. It was a BIG hit. I did not have tarragon and was afraid some of the younger ones might not like it anyway, so I increased the parsley by a lot. At first it was runny but after being made for a while it thickened up. Also used the sauce for dressing on green salad and will do that a lot more - fabulous. BTW, I did use Helmans.

It's a basic poached salmon recipe...and I liked the sweetness of the fingerling potatoes to complement the richness of the salmon. My only complaint was the mayonnaise. It was a bit heavy and I'm wondering if creme fraiche may have been a better substitute. I'm going to try this next time.

FANTASTIC! The salmon came out perfectly - my first time poaching. The entire family - kids 5, 7, and 9 as well as husband loved the sauce. I only had dried tarragon and chives on hand and it was still fabulous. Used edamame instead of snap peas. Definitely a hit!

This is a great basic, fairly simple recipe. When I first tried the sauce (without the salmon), I was dubious, but it and the salmon complemented each other extremely well (the salmon tones down the sauce) and I will definitely make it again!

Made it 3 times in 2 weeks. Great as an appetizer in smaller portions. Make ahead and very good. Easy for the novice as well

My husband and I didn't care for the sauce (although the rest of the meal was great). To us, it tasted a little too much like tartar sauce. Texture was a little weird too (although our food processor wouldn't get it to a completely smooth consistency--that may not be the recipe's fault).

Two suggestions on this dish: First, try freshly grilled tuna rather than poached salmon. The salmon is pretty rich and has a fatty mouth-feel, which along with the mayonnaise sauce is too much moist richness for my taste. I felt overwhelmed. Ordinarily I don't like grilled tuna because it's too plain and usually sort of dry (unless you eat it rare inside). This sauce makes a good herby, rich counterpoint for the grilled tuna. Second: I tried this with both Best Foods mayonnaise (Hellman's in the Midwest and on the East Coast) and then again with a canola-based mayonnaise from Safeway. The Best mayonnaise seemed like it was whipped and airy, which might be nice on a sandwich, but when used in the sauce, made the sauce really runny -- actually pretty watery -- and without any body. This was even after I followed other suggestions to use less rice vinegar. The canola-based mayonnaise made a sauce with a clingy body, which I liked a lot better. It also didn't seem overly salty, as the sauce made with the Best Foods mayo.

The sauce and the presentation make this recipe a keeper. I've made it many times times and agree that using Hellman's Light Mayonnaise doesn't compromise the flavor. Also, I used to poach the salmon, but now find it easier to bake it, drizzeled with wine or lemon juice for 15 minutes at 400-425. We also prefer red skinned potatoes to the fingerling ones. Be sure to buy fish at a reputable fish market, and use fresh sugar snap peas - I tried the frozen ones once and was disappointed. If you still have the July 1998 issue of Gourmet, there is a great picture of this dish.

I made this last night.....WOW!! Couldn't have been easier! Everyone loved it! I've made other poached salmon recipes.....but, this is the best!

I've made this a couple of times. It's exceedingly easy. I would highly suggest making the mayonnaise yourself. You'll be running the cuisinart for the sauce anyhow. And if possible go out of your way to find sockeye or chinook.

I am in the process of making this for a New Year's Eve dinner party and I made the suace last night, to the letter. When I tried it this morning it was overwhelmingly ONION! I am going to throw more tarragon in today, I will report back tomorrow...

Absolutely loved the sauce, though I agree with many other posters that a bit less rice vinegar is the perfect amount (about 1/4 cup, scant). Also, if you have access to the Ojai Cooks' brand of products, their Lemonaise makes a great substitution for regular mayo. The mustard grains add a subtle burst of flavor along with the citrusy tang of the lemon. A wonderful complement to the poached salmon!

Absolutely delicious. Served it for a buffet luncheon and everyone raved!!! The sauce goes well with asparagus, cold filet mignon......

Delicious & easy. A mother's day treat for my new mother-in-law. First taste of the sauce made me add a smidge of sugar, but it probably would have been fine without it once the flavors had a chance to meld. Beautiful presentation. Used a combo of fresh & dry tarragon.

Absolutely delicious!! Served this to a brunch garden party of about 50 women. Everyone loved it!!! Beautiful presentation.

Delicious and easy recipe-- the most time-consuming step was waiting for the wine and water to boil. Since the sauce was a bit runny at first but thickened the next day, I might reduce the vinegar if using the sauce immediately, but not if preparing it for next-day serving. I also didn't see the point of slicing the potatoes lengthwise rather than crosswise. Perfect for guests as well as for leftovers: elegant, easy, and truly accommodating. What more could you want?

What a great recipe! Fast, easy, delicious, attractive, inexpensive, and, if you use Hellman's Light Mayonnaise as I did, healthful. This sauce is vivid green and contrasts beautifully with the pale poached salmon. It would be a wonderful dip for crudites, too.

This is a great recipe for the dinner party that you want to be able to enjoy with your guests and not be involved with preparations in the kitchen. The presentation is wonderful and the culinary results are simply delicious. I served the recipe with a light orange slice, radish slice and oil cured black olive salad. Along side the salmon I placed a few steamed but firm asparagus spears. The sauce on the dish worked with this vegetable. Finished the meal with a dessert from the 2003 February Gourmet, Kumquat tart.

This is the best recipe I have found in the couple of years I have been on this website! So fantastic for a brunch. I did not change a thing. I even made the sauce with potatos for a picnic - great idea for a different potato salad. Everyone raved!!!

I decided to make this dish after reading everyone's excellent reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. I loved the fact that I could prepare just about everything the day before. The tartness of the sauce was a very good balance against the richness of the salmon. I would reduce the quantity of fish next time, as it was quite filling.

The sauce is incredible. I haven't tinkered with it at all, despite having made it now about 5 times! Instead of poaching, I grill the salmon, though. Adds a nice flavour, especially with wood chips on the coals. Fantastic recipe!

This is a great dish for entertaining - especially during the summer. It's easy, and the sauce is incredible. Plus, you can make it ahead of time and then enjoy the company of your friends (who will think you're a gourmet cook after they taste the sauce!) It's wonderful!

This elegant dish was so easy to prepare! I never knew that it was so easy to poach fish! I made this for my Mother to serve at a luncheon for 'her lady friends'. It was a huge success! I used small red bliss potates insted of fingerling. I steamed a few as per the recipe, but found that boiling the slices was much quicker. I made potato salad with the left over tarragon sauce the next day. I can't wait to make this again!

This is easy enough to make on a weeknight, but spectacular in presentation. My husband (who doesn't impress easily) was wowed by this. And I agree, you could *drink* the sauce! I made it exactly as the recipe described and it was fabulous, just wonderful. A real showstopper for a dinner party!

I've made this twice now, both times for dinner parties and my guests have loved it. The tarragon sauce is TO DIE FOR! The first time I made the sauce, I used regular mayonnaise, the second time I realized too late that I was out of regular mayonnaise and had to use fat free. The flavor wasn't compromised a bit, so this dish can be low-fat as well! Enjoy!

I agree with the other reviews. A very elegant dish that can make an impression at a dinner party. Variations on the presentation make it even better. The sauce is so rich that a medallian of salmon is probably adequate for light eaters.

Rating: 4
The sauce is as yummy as everyone says -- it even works with dried tarragon (I used 1/3 the quantity of fresh). Also, a slightly thicker piece of salmon took longer than 8 minutes, and the potatoes should be salted-and-peppered before being arranged on the plate. But this recipe is delicious, don't hesitate to make it!

Delicious. Presentation is elegant. For a dinner party, I poach the salmon early in the day or the night before and then store in the refrigerator. I do the same with the sauce. Bring to cool room temp before serving. Make the potatoes right before you're ready to serve. I have used both fresh and frozen sugar snap peas. Now I just use frozen, they taste and look as good as fresh, but are a lot less trouble. If you want a "can't go wrong, but looks like I worked all day on it" salmon recipe, this is it.

A friend made this for me last summer, so I searched for the recipe and made it last night. It was as good as I remembered. I halved the recipe and still had plenty of sauce. Making the sauce the night before gave the flavors plenty of time to mix well. Easy and delicious!

I added an onion, some peppercorns, mustard seeds, and sugar to my poaching liquid, chilled the salmon overnight, and served it with steamed asparagus and baby red bliss potatoes tossed with a lemon shallot butter. A delicious and elegant recipe for a dinner party!
