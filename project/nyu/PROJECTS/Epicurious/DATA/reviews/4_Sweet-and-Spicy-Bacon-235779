I lined a sheet pan with foil and used a rack. I dislike cayenne so I skipped it, and didn't miss the heat at all. I wish I could have absorbed more of the grease, but I didn't want to risk removing any of the coating. Letting the bacon rest on paper towels soaked up some of the fat from the bottom, fortunately. I used this for BLTs, and they turned out fabulous. Next time I might try the cayenne, or find a different way to add heat. It's a dangerous recipe, though, and now that I've made it, I'll probably start making up reasons why we need another batch.

Served this for a gala breakfast, and it was delicious. However, use the best THICK cut bacon you can; the dish improves with the body and heft of the bacon.

my husband, the bacon-lover (he has bacon floss), raved about this recipe. i used dark brown sugar and the molasses created a light glaze on the bacon w/ a perfect crunch. i found the pepper to be great - not really spicy, but just right.

Never again will I put just plain old bacon on a club sandwich. This provided some fantastic flavor.

A tad more cayenne is good. Best to drain on a wire rack over paper towels. Crisper and no sticking.

Increased the cayanne pepper a little more but great side to the pancakes and waffles

This is a huge crowd pleaser....additional tips: when draining on paper towels, lift around the edges often because the caramelized sugar will cause the bacon to stick and the paper is difficult to peel off later when the bacon has cooled completely. always crisper if served right after baking, but this recipe can also be made prior to day of serving and after cooling, stored in a zip lock bag and refrigerated or frozen. when ready to serve, bring to room temp and put on foil lined cookie sheet , tented with another piece of foil left open on the sides and reheated in 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.
