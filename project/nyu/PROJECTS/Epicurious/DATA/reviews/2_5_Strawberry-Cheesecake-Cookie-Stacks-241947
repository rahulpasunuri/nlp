My group tried this recipe for our cheesecake week at school, it turned our really well. We made a few adjustments such as using fresh strawberries, and instead of vegatable spray on the cookies we used Baker's Joy. Some of the cookies fell apart and the recipe was dificult to follow at points but all ended well and it was well accepted by our consumers.

My family really liked it, but I wasn't swept away. The "cheesecake" element was interesting. My husband said it was the best part, but I liked the phyllo part the best.

The filling was a tad lemony; might try less juice next time. Phyllo is not easy to work with, the end result was just"ok".
