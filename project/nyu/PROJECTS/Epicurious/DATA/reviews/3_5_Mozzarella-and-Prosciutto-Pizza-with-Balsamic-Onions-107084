This pizza was delicious. I used pre-made dough but the same toppings as asked - check out my blog - http://randomactsoffood.blogspot.com/2011/03/mozzarella-and-proscuitto-pizza-with.html

Though we have our own tried and true dough recipe, this pizza preparation bowled over our guests at the New Year's Eve cabin. For 8 people we made 4 different pizzas with this being the last served, the pizza de resistance if you will. The other pizzas were *not* too shabby, yet when this arrived on the table to semi-satiated palates, it knocked everybody out of the ballpark.

This is hands down the best home made pizza recipe my husband and I have ever come across. I highly recommend it. The dough is perfect!

This Pizza was amazing....we used a dough that we got from a local pizza place. This recipe goes a lot faster with two people working on it! The prep does take some time especially when someone with minimal chopping skills (as myself) is working on it! We roasted the red pepper directly on the stove, we have metal burners, and we also added a shallot to the onions...We also didn't have a big enough pizza pan, so I kind of rolled the dough into a more rectangular shape, and we put two rectangle pans together with aluminum foil inbetween, and we stuck it on the lowest shelf in the oven, cause it would have been difficult to take the pans in and out, as we do not have a stone or a paddle! I gave a piece to our roommate, and I saw her starting to pick off the onions...she didn't even know what they were, so I made her stop and eat it how it was cooked...She loved it too!I will definitely make this again!!

This was delicious! We used our normal bread machine pizza dough and baked the same way as always: partially bake the crust at 450 on a stone on the center rack until a few golden spots appear; then add toppings. For toppings, I did a few modifications: rather than use fresh thyme, I added 1 tsp dried thyme to the onions shortly before the end of their cooking time. I dramatically reduced the oil with the garlic to 4 Tbsp, which was plenty. Also, I used about 3 Tbsp sliced roasted red pepper plus about 1/4 cup sun dried tomatoes instead of all roasted red pepper. I thought it would be too sweet since the onions are slightly sweet and I thought the combo was great. After partially baking the crust, I added the toppings as listed. Just before the cheese was completely melted I added the prosciutto at the last minute just to heat through. Yum!

Tastewise it was delicious! The crust was incredible! Truly the best. And the toppings worked well. (I omitted the proscuitto and red pepper but included the mushrooms).However, I feel you need the proper equipment to make it work. I used a large wooden board for the paddle and a baking sheet. However, the pizza would not slide off the board onto the hot pan and it bunched up and stuck to the hot pan! I would only make this again with a proper paddle and baking stone.

I didn't add the prociuto to the pizza that I made, but otherwise I followed the directions exactly. I thought this was an easy pizza to make (using jarred roasted peppers) and the result was delicious! I especially liked the balsamic onions, which I have made in the past, paired with scallops (a Greenbriar specialty). My favorite part about this pizza is the dough, though! It is so easy to work with and remains soft once it has been baked.

I liked the flavor combo of the toppings, but the prep was an awful lot of work, and the "cooking class'" techniques were disastrous. I gave up on kneading in the bowl, very awkward. Using a baking sheet for a pizza paddle was impossible--everything stuck and stretched. I made 2, and at 500 degrees, the lower one burned before the time was up. I'll go back to the New Basics Cookbook crust I've been using (or storebought).

This dough is very easy to make, although I might try cutting down on the salt a little. I made this for my wife and she really enjoyed it!

One of our favorite pizza recipes. I make it without the bell pepper since my husband doesn't care for them. I toss on some sun dried tomatoes. Yum!

This pizza was great, i added a chopped habenero pepper for a little extra zing, and used a store bought pizza crust. I will definetely make this again.

This was greasy and not very good. The crust was nice but the toppings just didn't work for me.

Fantastic! I have made it two different ways: 1) Using the recipe for the dough 2) Used a store-bought pizza crust (Boboli) when I was lazy! Either way.....GREAT!
