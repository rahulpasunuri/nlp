Magificient! I do grated orange rind and orange pulp around the holidays in my Tiramisu. This one has mine beat. My family loves it!

I made this for my Dad's 80th Birthday and made it for 40 people, it is relatively straightforward but it is made much more difficult if you are making large quantities. The smell of the caramelized pineapple in the kitchen was absolutely wonderful. It was a great success however as I am making it again today I will be using Earl Gray Tea as I think that the Bergamot flavour will cut the sweetness of the pineapple and will add a small amount of lemon zest and increase the quantity of pineapple by 50%. Overall though it is a nice twist on a classic

I struggled about if this deserved 3 or 4 stars--I decided on 3 only because this recipe is, admittedly, a lot of work. Nothing is too difficult, but after all the steps, it adds up to around 2 hours (or at least for slow cooks like myself). The results are delicious however. I use very little coffee (maybe a tablespoon) and increased the tea, which gives it a gentler, unique flavor. I will also use more pineapple next time, as I love the flavor. I will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe! I did not use the tea however, just the coffee. Next time I will add alot more chocolate shavings on top.

Other than having some pineapple for a solid bite, I didn't find this tiramisu very unique and certainly not worth the bother. I did expect more from this recipe. A unique flavor perhaps?? But it almost seemed like I was eating a bakery birthday cake or wedding cake with a lot of cream (albeit without the buttercream frosting). Steeping the coffee with the tea added virtually nothing nuanced to the dish.

next time I will caramelize slices or strips of pineapple to make it more decorative

I made this for the birthday party of a dear friend, and everyone loved it! The pineapple added another dimension to an already yummy dessert, and the caramelized pineapple added a bit of crunch to the texture. Start this recipe two days before you plan to serve it, it is worth the time.
