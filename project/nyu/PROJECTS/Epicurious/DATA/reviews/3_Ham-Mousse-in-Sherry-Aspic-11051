My mother made something similar to this, especially when she had friends over for luncheon or for an early dinner. I kind of remember our fridge being taken up by various aspic molds in various stages of preparation-its a 2 day process to be sure! I didnt keep a single one of her many jello molds and so I used a bundt pan, which worked fine but wasnt nearly as impressive. To the cook in New Zealand, if you are having trouble with the cream setting up try this-chill your beaters and bowl in the freezer, also add some cream of tartar (like 1/4 tsp). Beat until stiff peaks form.

I was amazed that there were no other reviews but when I saw the aspic making process I realised why. I decided to just make the ham mousse and it was quick and simple. The mixture looked a little bland so I added approx 3tbsp chopped parley to the mixture. The cream disintegrated when I mixed it in, even though I had cooled the mixture well, but I think that is because of the type of cream in NZ (might try egg whites next time). The mousse turned out fine anyway. Good way to use up Christmas ham.
