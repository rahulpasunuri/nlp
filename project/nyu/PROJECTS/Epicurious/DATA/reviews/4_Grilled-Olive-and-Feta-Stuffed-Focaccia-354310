What a great recipe. Presents nicely. The sweet and salty tastes with the rosemary are really great.

This is a really great recipe. I omit the raisins on personal preference, but other than that, I make it as is. We have a pan for the grill (meant to cook fish on, because it sometimes falls apart) that we ended up cooking the bread on.

Easy & delicious. I used whole wheat pizza dough from the supermarket & it handled very well. Loved the way the flavors played together!

After 6 minutes I had pretty well burned this with my grill set to medium-high. Next time I will have the grill on low and check it every few minutes. For the dough I thawed a Rhodes whole wheat frozen loaf, which was quite good. Also, since I am on a budget, I used black olives instead of Kalamata, dried Rosemary, which I crushed in the palm of my hand before adding, and I used Kosher salt instead of the flaked sea salt. It was very yummy! I thought I would hate the raisins in it, but they didn't add as much flavor as I thought they would, and the texture was right on. I am looking forward to trying it again, watching the grill closer next time.

This was SOOOOOOOO good. Simple, easy and yet an amazing amalgamation of flavors. Will definitely make again!

I could not find frozen whole wheat pizza dough so I used a thick, cooked whole wheat pizza crust that I carefully sliced horizontally. I also added rotisserie chicken to each sandwich and then cooked them on a stove-top cast iron grill pan. They turned out to be very good and rated an A+ from those who partook. This was a very fast way to make the sandwiches, so I would definitely make them again like this.
