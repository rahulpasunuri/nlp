i changed this recipe a little based on reviewers' comments, and taste. i replaced the parsley with mint and cut the dill down a little. i only used 4 scallions as 6 seemed way too much. and i used only a splash of buttermilk (a quart would have made this way too watery). the result was good, light, fresh, what i was looking for.its now chilling in the fridge

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used half as much buttermilk, eliminated the parsley and used Greek yogurt. It turned out to be a really nice, refreshing soup with a great balance of sweet cucumber, tangy lemon and smooth creaminess. Perfect for a hot summer's day lunch. It would be difficult to eat this as a dinner, however...it's much too light.

This is a phenomenal recipe. I think the buttermilk is what really makes it unique. OH, it is SO good. I went light on the parsley and would even be tempted to leave it out altogether. I definitely went heavy on the dill, and I added a nice quantity of fresh mint from my garden as well. It was just . . . fabulous. Oh, and I used strained (Greek) yogurt too; I would highly recommend that.

great on a hot day! This recipe is so easy but loaded with flavor.

Made this without the parsley--increased the amount of dill to a generous 1/4 cup. Used dairy products I had on hand, so used non-fat yoghurt, skipped the buttermilk and substituted 3 Tbsp sour cream and 3 Tbsp heavy cream. Used red onion instead of scallions. Very refreshing and delicious. I guess I changed the recipe so much it's not like the original, but basically I don't think you can go too wrong blending cukes with dairy products, dill, onions of some sort, salt and pepper. Small shrimp on top are delicious too.

I was raised on cold cucumber soup, we had it all summer. There are many variations to this soup. There is one other thing you must have with this soup, that is a good crusty loaf of RYE bread w/ sweet butter. I'm having a big bowl of it today. 90 out here today. I can smell it now, bye YUM-YUM

Very easy to make and great flavor right away. Can't wait to try it tomorrow. For two people halved the recipe and have plenty of leftovers.

I would give this recipe four forks for ease, especially on a hot summer day, but it's not my favorite. As someone noted, the buttermilk flavor is a little overpowering. I halved everything like someone said and that was more than enough for four people. I think my search for the ultimate chilled cucumber soup recipe will continue.

A little bland for my tatse but very refreshing in the summer heat! My fiance loves it. My brother hated it and said he would rather just eat a cucumber. Definitely worth making for folks with the palate to appreciate it. Enjoy!

I would cautiously make this again. What happened was: I pureed the cucumber in two batches in my blender. After the first bath, I happened to taste the results, and it was horribly bitter. I hadn't yet added all of the parsley, scallions, and dill. In the second batch, I did all all ingredients and it was delicious. But why the bitterness? Did I just have a bad cucumber in the batch? Or was the complete list of ingredients necessary to mask the normal bitterness of the cukes? I was making it for a party so I didn't dare mix the two batches. Just served smaller portions. If anyone has any insight, please let me know. Thanks.

I had a bumper crop of cucumbers this year .I made the soup for my husband and he was not a big fan, however he is a meat and potatoes guy. I shared some(alot)with my neighbor, she is from Finland, and when she opened the container to taste it she sat there and ate all of it. It's just not for everyone.

Easy to prepare. Great for a hot summer day. Flavors got better with time, it's flavor peaked about 3 - 4 days after it was made.

Please, do yourself a favor and try the original recipe - as printed in the last two editions of the New York Times Cookbook. Much superior - uses water cress, cream (instead of buttermilk), plain yougurt, chicken stock, and small qty of potatoes. Sound like a variation on Vichyssoise -yup, and,it is truly a great summer soup. I add a bit of chopped fresh dill(dried won't do).

Where does the 1/2 cup of parsley fit in?

I am a caterer and tried this recipe for one of my clients. Althought I added more sour cream and a little less buttermilk, it received rave reviews and now we serve it quite often.

I made this recipe with half the amount of buttermilk called for and it turned out deliciously. I would happily make it again on a hot summer day. I also used English cucumbers as they have considerably less seeds to be removed.

I, nor my family liked this recipie for this soup. One comment was, "It was served pretty." I would make the soup again with some major adjustments, such as, more hot pepper and a lump of crab or large shrimp.

Where did I go wrong? I followed the recipe but all I could taste was buttermilk. I made this for our dinner club and it was a big disappointment.

See my review from 04/06/99 - the Walnut Creek cook. The review is the same. What I cannot understand is why I gave it only a 3 fork review then.

We really liked this soup--especially since it is low fat. We both thought it needed just a little something extra so added some dried mint (didn't have fresh). It perked it up just right.

I made exactly according to recipe and it was luscious. I made well ahead for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. One tip, choose larger cucumbers. Smaller ones had very little flesh left once deseeded

thanks to the reviews I halfed the recipe and had plenty for 4 of us. I also used the sour cream instead of yogurt. It was delicious.

Wonderful flavors and very easy to make - although I had enough to eat for a week. I plan to make it for a friend's dinner party soon.

I loved this recipe (yes, even though it definitely required pureeing in two batches.) Since I like thick soup I cut out the yogurt and just used two cups of buttermilk (another time I just used two cups of yogurt, but the buttermilk was more tart). I also used a whole bunch of dill since I love dill. Great, light summer soup!

Whoever invented this recipe must have a giant industrial blender. The cucumber by itself completely filled my 11-cup food processor bowl; I had to do it in two batches. If I hadn't strained it, there would have been more than half a gallon of soup. I forgot to get the fresh dill, so I used two teaspoons of dried (in lieu of two tablespoons of fresh), and it was a little too dilly for my taste. I'd try it again, but I'd cut back on the dill.

This is a delightful cold soup for a hot summer day. We serve it with hot red potatoes, and use sour cream instead of yogurt. We use the potatoes as dippers and it is delicious.!! nancy

Have a very large bowl ready to accept this delightful experience. Garnish each serving with one of the ingredients - thin slice of cucumber, sprig of parsley, sliver of scallion. A taste is a tease and a bowl consumed is a natural delight.
