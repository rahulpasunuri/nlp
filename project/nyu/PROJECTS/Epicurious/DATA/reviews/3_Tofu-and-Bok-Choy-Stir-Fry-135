oops. i changed more than i said. had no water chestnuts. or cornstarch. toasted sesame oil is always better i think, and we doubled that too. almost doubled i mean

my first review. this turned out so well i have to. my ethnic sensibilities need development in the kitchen. but this seems real. doubled garlic and used half a regular onion. we use mrs braggs, it's milder, so needed 4 times as much, maybe. used dried rd bell pepper, and asian hot pepper sauce, just a half tspoon. oh, and subbed sherry with apple cider vinegar

I really enjoyed this dish. As recommended i doubled the soy sauce and seasame oil. Also added extra garlic and ginger. I also added the tofu w/ the ginger and garlic at the beginning, along w/ some soy sauce, so the tofu has more time to soak up the flavors and get crispy. I had no rice on hand so made w/ broad rice noodles. Delicious!

I, like others, was nervous after reading the reviews saying it was awful. But I was very, very impressed. I guess I can understand why some might think it bland due to its subtlety and understated deliciousness (this recipe is NOT for you if you're looking for standard Chinese buffet fare, certainly.....) but I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow! I did, admittedly, double up on the soy sauce and sesame oil (but not the corn starch) and I will definitely make this again and again.

Hi - I liked this, albeit a tad bland. I used 5-spice seasoned tofu, which added a nice kick, and put the greens in last. Customizable for sure - have fun with it!

This recipe turned out great! I used some leftover white wine, and added some mushrooms. It was the best stir fry I've eaten in a long time.

oops, my review of this was meant for a different recipe: Stir-fried Tofu and Shiitake Mushrooms in Black Bean Sauce. I have not made this dish yet.

Wow. This dish is magnificent. It's even better than any Ma Po tofu I've had in a restaurant (and I order it wherever I find it). I wish I could give it five forks. My only reservation (and it may simply be that the leeks I buy here in NZ are more mature than the ones typically available in the US) was the leeks being a little tough. I'll just peel off a couple extra layers next time. For tofu novices, make sure you get nice, fresh tofu, not the stuff in those foil lined cardboard boxes.

Made with 1 pkg of fresh Shitake mushrooms (Stems removed, Saute till tender then add ginger mixture. Delete water chestnuts and tofu. Any thing but bland, great with seared ahi. If you make it with the tofu, cube and brown with seseme oil and add at the end.

Beyond bland! I wish I had read the reviews before making this dish.

I made it with out the tofu as a side dish, AWESOME

I've made this dish several times as written and love it every time. I don't understand the negative reviews. The flavor is wonderfully complex yet delicate, complementing the tofu and bok choy. It's only bland if you prefer tasting a heavy sauce (and nothing else). To like this dish, you have to actually LIKE tofu and bok choy. For those of you who do, don't be discouraged by the negative reviews.

AWFUL! I wish I could give this negative forks. I have made many stir fry's and this is by far the most tasteless ever. I followed reviewers suggestions to double the sauce ingredients, and still, painfully bland. If you must make this, dry out the tofu and fry it first separately to crisp it up, and add a bit of something sweet (honey?) to the sauce. But really, don't waste your time.

This could be good, but as it is it's pretty bland. If I make it again I'll take the advice of previous reviewers and double the aromatics & sauce ingredients. Marinating the tofu might also have helped.

This was quite tasty. I used a pound of tofu, since that is the size for sale around here, and 4 heads of baby bok choy. I doubled the seasonings and aromatic ingredients and served over steamed rice. The end result far exceeded my expectations for something so simple.

I almost didn't make this recipe because some reviewers found it so bland, but decided to see for myself anyway. I found it absolutely delicious and flavourful as is! Will definitely make this again, and use the recipe as a base for other stir-fry dishes.

Way way way too bland. I will try something similar another time, but will have to do something to rev this dish up.

Here's a trick that I use to cook tofu, which makes it much more flavorful: 1) freeze it still in the package, then thaw in the fridge overnight. When draining the thawed tofu, you'll be able to press more liquid out, and the tofu will become a sponge, soaking up a ton more flavor from the sauce. An alternative is to make a marinade out of the sauce ingredients and soak the [pre-frozen or not] tofu for a few hours. Trust me, it'll be much better!

This was a bit disappointing, though i still think it has potential. Next time, I'll double the amount of soy sauce and sesame oil and add more garlic and ginger - maybe that'll make it less bland. Great ingredients, but still needs a little work.

Very simple, fast, great flavor. A good stand-by. I'll make it again and again. Can easily vary the vegetables, add meat, etc. It's a great basic "asian stir-fry" recipe.

I really like this recipe and make it often. You can modify it by adding fresh vegetables (broccoli, peppers, etc.) and canned Chinese vegetables like bamboo shoots, straw mushrooms, etc. Also, try browning some ground pork or boneless chicken at the beginning, to add texture and protein.

great food, best version i have had.

This dish was bland the way it appears above. I substituted 1 tsp. chunky peanut butter instead of the sesame oil as well as 2 tsp. brown sugar.

I was really disappointed. The end result tasted bland and the bok-choy was very soggy by the end.

This is one of our favorite recipes with Tofu. I like to add a little hot sauce to give it an extra kick. Sometimes we substitute the bok choy for chinese cabbage.

I can eat just about anything but this recipe was truly horrible and I couldn't get past the second bite
