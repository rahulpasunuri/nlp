I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in Bon Appetit in 1996--and still can't get enough of it. I substitute mushroom stock (either homemade or canned) for the chicken stock, and use whatever mushrooms I can find, and it's always delicious.

This is a favorite. Using "mixed" dried mushrooms works fine, and I use oyster mushrooms instead of crimini. Dry out the bread and go easy on the chicken broth until you're sure that the consistency is right. I cook the mushrooms a day ahead and add extra uncooked celery and some chopped sage to the final mixture before I put it in the oven. So good!

I've been making this recipe for Thanksgiving 8 years in a row now and it has ALWAYS been a big hit. Over the years, I have adapted it a bit and added fresh oyster mushrooms and used a dried mushroom medley that includes porcini. It's now a delicious 5-6 mushroom dressing classic.

I make this dish every year for Thanksgiving and always get rave reviews (even from my elementary school age kids). I follow the recipe exactly but make two batches at the same time to ensure we have leftovers. Lots of chopping but it's worth it!

Just made this for the first time yesterday (thanksgiving 2008) and it was fabulous! Could have eaten the whole pan myself! Added extra broth as I knew the dish would be reheated (potluck) and this worked out well. Immediately added it to my family cookbook!

This year I will be sure to double this recipe for Thanksgiving. I have used this recipe for the past 3 years, each time it is completely devoured before any other dish on the table. I highly recommend it - even picky eaters will go for it!

Spectacular! Couldn't get porcini, so I substituted oyster mushrooms. I followed the recipe without modifications (whis is rare for me). I agree that it's important to let all the liquid evaporate before adding the bread - you can always modify the consistency after mixing all the ingredients together. I will be making this again and again!

Excellent recipe. I've made it several times now and recommend that you fully cook the liquid out of the mushrooms or the stuffing will be a little soggy. You can even add a little more bread if you have it to ensure that the juices are absorbed. The mushrooms provide so much flavor that a little extra bread will not dilute the taste.

Given all of the great reviews, I thought this would be a fantastic dish. I love mushrooms and stuffing is a food group to me, but I just didn't like this. It should be called "three mushroom mushrooms" because it seems to be nothing but a mushroom casserole and no dressing. It was a terrible waste of time and a lot of money (those mushrooms are EXPENSIVE!!). Plus, it desperately needed salt. Will stick to my tried and true stuffing recipe in the future.

This will be the third Thanksgiving in a row that I make this dish. Everyone always raves about it! It's great for vegetarians because it has a substantial almost meaty element to it.

Everyone loves this dish! I brought it to a Thanksgiving potluck...one person who didn't like stuffing loved this one...another person who didn't like mushrooms loved it too.

Excellent dressing! This is the second Thanksgiving I made this recipe. One guest said it was the best dressing he ever ate. Quite a compliment since he was a chef for many years. This even went over well with the kids. I doubled the recipe and had the same result as the single recipe. This one is a keeper.

This was a bit dry when prepared according to directions. I would add more chicken stock when mixing the mushroom mixture and bread. I made the mushroom mixture a day ahead and I wonder if that gave it a tendency to be on the dry side (i.e., maybe the mushrooms continued to soak up any moisture in the mixture). Obviously, you have to love mushrooms to serve this.

Very Good. If you absolutely adore mushrooms, this one's for you. If you like mushrooms but don't love them, you might add something else, like sausage. I love mushrooms and would definitely make it again.

Have made this recipe for several years--excellent! One year used challah for bread--very good.

IF YOU LOVE MUSHROOMS, THIS IS THE BEST ONE TO USE IN A SMOKED TURKEY. I HAVE ALSO PUT SOME OF THE DRESSING UNDER THE SKIN ON A OVEN TURKEY. VERY GOOD

The first year I made this dressing, it was a hit. Now, this recipe has taken over an age old recipe my mother used to use for dressing. The whole family just loved it: even the children! We all know how picky children can be. Thanks for a great recipe!!!
