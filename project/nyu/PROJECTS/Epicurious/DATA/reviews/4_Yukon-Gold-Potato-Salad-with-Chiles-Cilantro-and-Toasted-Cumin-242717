A good potato salad. I totally cheated - a bag frozen roasted corn from Trader Joes (I thawed then "dried" it in tne oven for about 10 minutes), 2 small cans chopped roasted green chilies (drained really well), jar of whole roasted red peppers (again, drained really well). I used ground cumin and didn't toast it and used only about 3/4 of the dressing which I used a little more vinegar and a little less oil in. Served it with cheeseburgers and roasted sausages.

This Dish was so easy. But the flavors were so complex. The flavors just layered nicely. I wondered how this would come out, and worried, since I was entertaining and feeding people. I grilled my veggies early in the day. oh , I just noticed I forgot to add the green onions. Well it was still a hit. The next day I cooked the leftovers in a skillet till crisp...those were the best homefries EVER!!

Made this recipe for a huge crowd and it was barely touched. I followed the recipe exactly as written. It seemed kind of dry to me. And although there are a lot of seemingly flavorful ingredients, it didn't really seem all that flavorful. It was okay--the grilled corn, the chiles were good, but the combination wasn't what I was looking for.

Excellent!!! The recipe was terrific and even better the next day.

Found this too sour and did not enjoy this at all- we ended up throwing it away.

I was half way through making this recipe when I realized I only had 1 pound of potatoes, so I cut the oil back to ¼ cup, used 2 ears of corn and left everything else the same. I kept tasting it worried that it might be too spicy but it was so delicious. I added the juice of one lime and some more toasted cumin seed and this is THE best potato salad. All these years I thought my husband didnt like potato salad, but he was sneaking forkfuls out of the fridge!

Light yet filling, and beautifully spiced. I also recommend cutting down the oil - I used only 1/4c. and that made just enough vinaigrette to dress the veggies without oversaturating them.

Fabulous ! Used Anaheim chilis and reduced oil - will reduce even more to about 1/4 cup in future. Prepped all the veggies the night before and kept separate. Next time will just put it all together 24 hours in advance as the flavors really blended with the extra time - as evidenced by the skimpy leftovers. Served it with grilled pork tenderloin, & artichokes.Used an epicurious recipe, "guacamole w/ chipotle and fresh corn" as a starter - great combo. A new keeper!

Terrific recipe for a potato salad that is fresh and different. I doubled the recipe for a large beach bash and had almost none left! This one is a real winner!

This was good. I served it chilled but I like my potato salad warm. I would make the following changes, add more red wine vinegar to make it more tangy (1/2 - 2/3 cups) add less oil to 1/4 cup and perhaps add in a coupe of peppers that had more heat to them like jalapano. My husband love it. I liked that it was different and not mayo based.

Had this last night at a friends, it was very good. I do not usually like potato salad, and I can't wait to make this one.

My mid-western spouse and vegetarian daughter said this was the best potato salad they had eaten. It improved after a night in the refrigerator.

Wow -- this is a winner. It's tasty, healthy, and relatively easy to make. This would be a great dish to make ahead and take to a BBQ or a party, since it can easily sit in the fridge overnight. I left out the cumin seeds (I don't love their flavor), and I also left out the cilantro (I don't like buying a whole bunch of cilantro when a recipe only calls for a small amount...). Otherwise, I made it exactly as written, and it's delicious. I usually don't like leftovers, and I've had this for lunch three days in a row now. It has just a touch of garlic flavor (not too overpowering), and it's not too vinergar-y. Love it!

Made this last night and actually think it should be 3.5 forks. Great flavor -- love those poblanos! Will definitely become a summer staple.

This recipe has great flavor and ranks as one of the best potato dishes Ive ever had. It was made exactly as the recipe instructed. The only thing I will do differently next time is use a little less oil. Highly recommended.

This was the best potato salad I have ever had. And the most unique! I love the cilantro and cumin. We did not use the hot pepper, and I used half the ingredients except for the potatoes. (2 pounds of those.) I also cooked the potatoes in the microwave. After scoring the skin, I put them in a bit of water and microwaved it in 3 minute bits until they were done. Maybe 12 minutes total?
