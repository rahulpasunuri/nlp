Yum Yum Yum. I make this as-is once a week in a big batch and use it on everything from salads to sandwiches. Just make sure to emulsify it really well so it gets nice and creamy by adding the oil slowly while whisking aggressively, or just use the blender if you don't feel like whisking ;)

Great recipe! I add a teaspoon of soy & a teaspoon of Worcestershire.

Excellent and simple. I blend in the blender to combine and add a little brown sugar to bring it into balance. Excellent with spring greens, fruit and pungent cheese.

I haven't made this dressing yet, although I just made one that I have to share with you: 1/3 C balsamic vinegar, 2/3 C olive oil wisked together AND the best part: 1/3 c thinly sliced mint!! Oh, yum. . . .Originally this was a marinade for roasted veggies for a sandwich~~Very good. .Last night I used for a salad dressing. Tonight for shrimp, chard and roasted peppers over pasta. Who knows?? Tomorrow I just might mainline it.

I had made three batches of this salad dressing this morning because my family loves it so much.

Simple and tasty. I will lighten up on the mustard next time.

This is my standard dressing recipe. I like to add just a squeeze of dijon mustard and a teaspoon of goat cheese. I whisk them together for a tangy, creamy dressing that everyone loves!

Ditto on the accolades - my whole family loves this recipe (and that includes a fairly picky 5- yo)! We also like to drizzle this vinaigrette on steamed/stir-fried veggies - like asparagus or green beans - and as an accompaniment to grilled fish/chicken. To make this already easy recipe even easier, just mix all of the ingredients in a plastic, squeeze- type bottle, shake well (before each use) and squirt away.

I needed a quick and easy salad dressing for a spinach, arugula, and tomato salad. I used a meyer lemon fig balsamic vinegar and added some salt and pepper to taste. Then topped the salad with some grated parmigiano reggiano. Turned out perfectly, everyone in the family loved it!!!

This is the best dressing. Easy, quick and better than any grocery store version. Everyone who tastes it asks for the recipe. I wouldn't touch it with honey or anything. It's delish.

Love this recipe. Every time I make it for guests, they want the recipe. Especially good with a goat cheese/apple type salad.

My husband and I love this dressing, and I had to give the recipe to my daughter-in-law last week, she couldn't stop talking about it! The only thing I did differently was add a good squeeze of honey to take the bite of the vinegar off. Most excellent!

Not only did I love it, so did my husband! I highly recommend feta crumbles with this. And some homemade garlic croutons from leftover French bread.

Simple easy recipe. If you had a little bit of honey, it adds a hint of sweetness and also helps to emulsify the dressing and reduce seperation of oil and vinegar.

Just when I had almost given up on trying to make balsamic dressing. Would make many times over.

Awesome recipe!! Use it for salads and marinade!! Especially Artichokes, cook them then slice in half, remove core, marinade in this dressing for about an 1 hour, then put then on the bbq until hot. Excellent appetizer.

After the stellar reviews, I thought this would be great. I love balsamic vinegar dressing, but this is not the recipe I'm looking for. It was good, but far from great. I'm not really sure what it needs.

I have just started to make my own dressing and this one tops them all! It is so fresh. You will NEVER buy bottled again.

Made with balsamic vinegar and olive oil before but the additions make it extra special - even poured over mashed potato!

I found my favorite salad dressing after many months of searching. Only changes were 1 galic clove instead of two and used alittle less than 1/2 cup of olive oil called for. Used mixed greens and fresh basil from my garden for the salad and added dried cranberries, walnuts, gorgonzola cheese on top of the greens. Added the dressing to each bowl and it was excellent. Use good quality balsamic vinegar as well as olive oil for best results. Here in Florida I grow Mexican tarragon in my garden, I believe French is more difficult due to our warm weather. Added a teas of tarragon and it was perfect.

This dressing is easy and delicious! I've made it 4 times in the past 2 weeks! Is best after chilling at least an hour. 4 forks.

So easy. I served with a salad with walnuts, green apples and bleu cheese.

This dressing was easy to make and very flavorful.I didn't even measure- it is simple enough to approximate amounts. Just used one small bowl, a whisk, and two minutes of my day! Will make again and again.

The best balsamic vinegar dressing we have made, with slight modification. We use 1/8th of the oil called for and one garlic clove rather than two. We put the garlic through a garlic press instead of chopping. The dressing complements salads using feta cheese and anchovies.

Another thing you can add to a recipe with balsamic vinegar is a little bit of honey and italian spices. Apples in the salad with parmasan cheese make this delicious!
