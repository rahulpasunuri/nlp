Perfect as is.

Great recipe, everyone loved this at our pre-Christmas dinner. I also made individual servings by using cupcake holders (be sure to use the sturdy ones) resting in muffin tins, which makes it easier for filling, chilling & storing until serving. I added lemon zest to the cheesecake filling to give it a more distinctive twist.

I made this cheesecake in a mini cheesecake pan and served it to 9 friends for lunch. The recipe makes 24 minis. It was fabulous and so was the pomegranate syrup. Everyone asked for the recipe. I froze the ones that were left--every bit as tasty!

Wonderful finish to an otherwise traditional Thanksgiving dinner. I had to do the syrup again as I had let the first batch reduce too long until the sugar became inedible. Next time, I kept closer watch and didn't reduce as much as the recipe said in terms of final quantity (it was more like 1 cup instead of 1/2) but still made the cake exceptional. I just love pomegranate seeds, and they, too, were an important addition. I didn't expect a fully firm cheesecake. This may become our new Thanksgiving dessert of choice!

This was fantastic. Served it for a dessert at thanksgiving and everyone raved about it. Don't worry about finding flash pasteurized pomegranate juice. I used a box juice and added a drop of red food coloring.

My family really enjoyed this cheesecake. In contrast to all the other desserts, pie and whipping cream, apple slices with ice cream, the tangy flavor was great. In fact my 11 year old niece asked if I would email her the recipe so she could make it at home! I can't really comment on the pomegranate sauce because I put it on to simmer while we ate and forgot about it. Needless to say, I had to soak the pan for quite a while... It was good with just the pomegranate seeds and some other berries. Would definitely make again.

When I saw this I knew I had to make it. Using yogurt definitely changes the overall taste! The cheesecake itself isn't very firm, but it's still quite good. However, I did have a problem with the syrup, so when that failed, I just used the method I normally use for pomegranate sauce. I realize it isn't syrup, but it still tastes great and works every time. Here it is: Pomegranate Sauce: Start to finish: 18 min. 1 16oz bottle of Pomegranate Wonderful Juice; 1/4 cup packed brown sugar (I use dark); 1 tbls cornstarch. In a saucepan bring juice to a boil. Reduce heat, boil gently, uncovered, until reduced to 1 cup (10-12min). Stir together brown sugar and cornstarch; add to juice. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 2 min more. Transfer to bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Cool to room temperature. (Store, covered, in refrigerator until serving). To serve, spread evenly over cheesecake and top with pomegranate seeds.

This cheesecake didn't firm up nicely at all. The family thought it was to tart. The sauce didn't come out right either ... a disappointment all around.
