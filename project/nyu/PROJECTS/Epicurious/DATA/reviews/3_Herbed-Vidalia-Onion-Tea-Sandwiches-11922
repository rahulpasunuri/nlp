This recipe has been a very big hit at each party that I served it. It is incredibly easy to make. I'm perplexed by others responses but assume they used a less sweet onion than the vidalia or simply don't like tarragon.

Okay, I'm giving this one a mixed review. Personally, I thought they were NASTY!! I was literally standing over the garbage can, with the plate full of sandwiches in my hand, when my boyfriend urged, "Surely someone will eat them!" I was doubtful -- but agreed to let them live for the first few moments of the party. Well, color me shocked, because they all got eaten! So evidently my guests are REALLY NOT PICKY or they were actually good to some people. In the interest of full disclosure, I think it's the tarragon I didn't like. I'm really sensitive about spices I don't like -- and evidently tarragon's one of them. But if you (and/or your guests) like tarragon, I guess you'll dig 'em!

Delicious! I served this as open-faced sandwiches using rye cocktail bread. Vidalia onions are a must!

This was surprisingly good! The sweet onions and the spread combined really well. Yum!

I too did not have access to Vidalia onion, but the sweet Maui onion that they have here in Maui was beautiful. Two things I would recommend, however. I found that the parsley didn't stick to the outside well, so I put a thin layer of mayonnaise on the outside edges and I found that that helped. Also, I found the flavor a bit bland. I would add extra Tabasco. I think I was too conservative with use of that ingredient. Be generous with the Tabasco!! They display beautifully. The parsley adds such beauty to this recipe.

I prepare this recipe for a tea party and they came out delicious I had to give copy of the recipe to all my guests. I could not find Vidalia onions anywhere so I used red onion sliced paper thin. You can prepare the mixture one day ahead and keep it in the refrigerator. Sandwiches may be prepared 45 minutes before you party starts and cover them with plastic wrap. Enjoy it
