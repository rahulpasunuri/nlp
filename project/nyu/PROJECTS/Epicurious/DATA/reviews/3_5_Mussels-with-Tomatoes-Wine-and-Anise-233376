What's a cook to do when there is no Pernod in the pantry, just added fennel from the garden. Used chopped canned tomatoes instead of using canned sauce as well. My husband added red chili flakes to his portion. Yum!

I think this would benefit from the addition of some red chili flakes, and crushed tomatoes in lieu of tomato sauce- forgive me for doctoring a recipe but I also added 1/2 cup ea of celery and fennel for a little crunch- deeelish

LOVE mussles, but wasn't excited about the sauce. Too bland with no flavor or texture, definately could use more body. Even with crushed tomatoes and not tomatoe sauce wasn't up-to-par. Enjoy, but don't expect much.

Really good. I cut up whole canned tomatoes instead of using sauce, which added some more texture.

Super good. My family loved this dish.

Delicious! We also used homemade tomato sauce and ate it with dark rye bread. Definitely a keeper.

I made this last night as is, although I added a tablespoon of butter to the first two tablespoons of olive oil and used coarse French sea salt. It wasn't bad, but not the best Pernod tomato combo I've had. I'll try it again with tomato paste and more garlic to enrich the flavors. If that doesn't work, I'll probably ditch the recipe.

This was our New Year's Eve dinner. With salad and the crusty bread.....perfect. I too was a little hesitant about so much Anisette, but the flavors were great.

Excellent! I love mussels and this recipe was great. I too made my own tomatoe sauce instead of using canned. You definitely have to have fresh crusty french bread to dip into the sauce.

This was the perfect Christmas Eve dinner. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe, except I did use my own home made tomato sauce. I was a little skeptical about using the full 6 tablespoons of Pernod, but the flavour was not prominent and it balanced perfectly with the other ingredients. I will be making this again. Delicious.

I actually ate these at his restaurant and they were fantastic. I was so happy to see the recipe in last month's Bon Appetit. I've made them twice, and both times they were perfect! The only thing I did differently the second time was added more garlic.
