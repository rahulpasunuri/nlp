Fabulous recipe! Nibbling on the cake bits stuck to the pan, my husband asked if it was angle food since it is so light. The frosting and cranberry glaze offered a nice balance of sweet and tart. I also like the do ahead aspects of this recipe. I made it for Christmas dinner, and was able to make the glaze 2 days ahead, and the cakes 1 day ahead. Nothing left but frosting and assembly the day of.

Delicious...Orange and cranberry flavors were wonderful. Next time I will cut layers in half and alternate with Orange Curd. Didn't have any trouble w/ Cranberry or Frosting setting up. Worthy of any Holiday Table.

The cake was very light and moist, it was actually one of the lightest I've made. Nice orange flavor, but not overwhelming, the cranberry sauce took longer to thicken than stated. Made in three 8x2-inch pans instead of two 9-inch, and can't see how it would fit in two 9-inch pans since all three layers baked up to the top of my pans. Frosting was a problem, didn't thicken enough even after almost an hour in the fridge. Next time I'll add more powdered sugar.

The orange cake and cranberry glaze were a lovely combination, especially if you don't like your cakes too sweet. I had a bit of trouble with the frosting, though, which never got stiff enough despite much chilling. Next time I think I will just do a simple whipping cream frosting, and to save time on the cranberry glaze, use a bit of cornstarch to help it gel up more quickly and stay in between the layers better.

Really beautiful and delicious cake. Time consuming but worth it. Great for a special autumn dinner.

I thought this cake was delicous, i made it with the orange cream cheese frosting and got great reviews. The cake was very light and airy and smelled delicous baking.

Note to Biffhank--Just click on the green words 'Cranberry Glaze' and 'Creamy Brown Sugar Frosting' and you'll find the recipes for these components.

The recipe sounds delicious but Epicurious appears to have deleted the glaze and frosting. Why leave the cake if the other two parts are missing? Please put the recipes back or delete all parts to avoid frustration. Thanks.

I loved this cake however I had a lot of trouble getting the frosting to set up. Was there an error in the amount of powder sugar as the frosting was too thin and had to add a considerable additional amount to make it a spreadable consistency. I would love to get an answer to this question. Thanks.

Although the flavor of the cake was very nice, I was disappointed with the dense, heavy texture (you would think that the six beaten egg whites would produce a lighter cake). The frosting was delicious--very light and creamy and not too sweet. Overall a very good cake.

I have made this recipe several times and it has become a holiday dessert table staple. Though it is a little labor intensive, I have made it up to two days ahead allowing me time to focus on the rest of the meal. One of my friends liked it so much she actually considered modifying it and using it as her wedding cake!

This cake is labor-intensive, but well worth all the work. We have made this a number of times for special occasions, and will continue to do so as it has gotten rave reviews from friends and family.

Made this dessert for my Dinner for Eight group and received rave reviews. Looked beautiful, tasted wonderful and was a spectacular ending. Have added to my recipe collection as a keeper!

It did turn out beautiful, but the flavor wasn't worth all the effort.

this cake is perfect for the holiday season; i made it twice for special occasions last year. it is one of the best i've made from this website. contrary to what others said, i did not find it that much more difficult to make, or terribly time consuming in comparison with your average cake recipe. and the cake was anything but dry. in fact, it remained very moist even the time that i made the cake layers the day before assembling.

I love this cake and everyone that I have made it for agrees. Everyone wants the recipe. The cake is the most sinfully lusicious texture that i have ever had. The frosting is difficult to get to the right consistancy but it is worth every bit of work.

Made this cake for my daughter's birthday this weekend (note: made only the cake - used another frosting and filling). What a disappointment. I found it dry and certainly not worth the considerable effort involved. I followd the instructions to the letter, including the sifting. I could have achieved better results with a cake mix!

A heck-uv-a lot of work but well worth it from the rave reviews I got. Literally took me 4 hours to make! Served it for my Mum's "50th" B-day to a crowd of chocoholics - they preferred this instead! 2 of my Mum's friends have asked for this website so that they can print off their own copy of this recipe! Will definately make this again - but only for really special occasions.

This is delicious! Although the cake takes a bit of time (all that sifting!), the results are worth it! I have a catering business in Tokyo and it's one of my most requested desserts.

I've made this recipe 4 times! It is a beautiful cake. I found that the cranberry sauce needed to be cooked much longer than the recipe said in order for it to reduce enough to not drip through the frosting. Fortunately, it is beautiful even with the drips.

This cake is quite dense and a bit dry, I would not say that it melts in your mouth. I made it twice, and made sure to sift all of the ingredients the second time, which made it a bit better. The tangy cranberries and sweet frosting are very good, it was a crowd pleaser at Thanksgiving and was visually appealing (looked professional)

A beautiful cake, the contrasting tangy cranberry and sweet brown sugar icing perfectly accented the orange flavor of the cake. Definite crowd pleaser. (Note: as I pulled the cakes from the oven, I noticed the bowl of egg whites I'd forgotten! The cake was still delicious and melt-in-your mouth, just denser).

Nice alternative dessert at Holiday meals....for those of us who make pies but would rather eat fresh fruit!

This cake is easy to prepare and fabulous!!! I have made it twice. Diane Mott Davidsons books are also great.
