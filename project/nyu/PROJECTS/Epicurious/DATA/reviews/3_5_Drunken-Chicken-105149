I lived in Shanghai for several years and made this last night for Chinese New Year. It was excellent. Tender, juicy and bursting with flavour. The key is using a good wine because the chicken will taste like the wine you use--bad wine means a bad taste. I used a nice quality sake. The sweetness of the chicken may be a new sensation for some people, but this is very authentic as one of a number of cold starters before a chinese banquet.

this is actually a classic shanghainese dish, and interestingly enough, i've had the dish at Ye Shanghai in HK (it's a good restaurant). it's surprisingly easy - there are various methods. I usually poach the chicken in some broth with aromatic vegetables (ginger and onions are key) and use some of the poaching liquid mixed with the wine (maybe 1:3, depending on how strong we'd like it) and let it sit in the fridge for a day or two, adjusting the marinade a bit as i go. I skip the brining and just add a little salt if it needs it. you can marinate it with some extra ginger and onions as well, which is what i usually do. anyway, it's a fun dish, and even if your palate isn't used to this kind of flavouring, give it a chance. :)

What a wonderful surprise this recipe was! I cooked two different whole chicken recipes for a party and wasn't sure how this one would come out. I needed a cold chicken dish and wow! The flavor and moistness of the chicken was incredible. It was fairly easy to make and everyone just raved about it. Being a cold chicken, it made great leftovers as well. The flavor of the salt, sherry, ginger and sugar soaked into the chicken is fantastic! The only glitch in the recipe was the appearance of the chicken when serving. You need to take the skin off before serving and it needs herbs and trimmings to look as good as it tastes. Try dribbling a little sherry over it, fresh spices (we used marjoram), and I put fermented lemons around it as well. It is also a recipe that needs to be started in the afternoon for an evening party.

To a cook from the Bay area...apparently, some people are having problems with a link from a recipe for Almond Dacquoise with Strawberry Ice Cream. When they click on strawberry ice cream, they end up at the site for Drunken Chicken. Everyone is just having a good time with this error. I myself think the Almond Dacquoise would go much better with Buffalo Chicken Wings.

The flavor was overwhelming..too much of a good thing isn't so good..also, too much time and bother..

Very refreshing change of pace for dessert. Keep the breath mints handy, though!
