Thought this was great, though made a couple small tweaks: added tahini on the bun, omitted mint (just didn't have any) and made the burgers into small sliders.

Yum! I cut the garlic in half (with the hummus I felt it was more than enough) and these were still incredibly flavorful. I added tzatziki sauce as an option for the top. My 9 year old inhaled this!

I also made this with ground turkey and loved it! If you do so, go much lighter on the cinnamon (if at all).

Made with ground turkey. Nice flavor but only used 1/2 mint, otherwise I felt it would have been too minty.

this is great! I mixed the feta in with the lamb, rolled them into balls and grilled them on kabobs, and served them with pita bread, hummus, lettuce, tomato, and grilled onions. yum!

These were the best burger's I have ever had. I don't think I will ever make beef burgers again.

This is a simple recipe that gives burgers a flavor kick. I made this for a Memorial day grill - and received rave reviews! Everyone loved them.

I love lamb and hummus so this was a great combination. Instead of forming burger patties with the mix I made sausage shapes and pushed them on to soaked wooden skewers - they are easy to barbecue, slightly quicker to cook and can be served in pittas, hot dog rolls or baguettes. I increased the paprika a little and added chilli sauce along with the hummus feta and salad (I like a kick to my food!) and they turned out great.

This was just okay. I love lamb and mint, but something was just off about the whole taste of these. I followed the recipe exactly, except for mixing the crumbled feta in with the burgers. Maybe my lamb wasn't the best, or the onion rolls I served it on were an off note, but I wasn't impressed. If I find myself with an extra $8 for some ground lamb sometime, I might try it again, but not anytime soon.

We loved this recipe. It's one of the best burgers I've tried. I followed the ingredients exactly but then grilled the burgers. The only thing I would change is to get hummus from the local greek restaurant next time. The humus I got from the health food store was good but Yanni's has the best humus in the world. I served this with a greek salad that I made from my heirloom tomatos.

I also mixed the feta in with the meat. Instead of hummus we topped the burgers with a mild mango chutney. Served cucumber/tomato with a yogurt sauce on the side. These were fantastic!

Ab Fab! Grilled the burgers and toasted the rolls on the grill. My husband kept exclaiming. Used thinly sliced red onion. Easy but elegant.

Fantastic! Served with a yogurt sauce (yogurt, grated cucumber and lemon juice whisked) and it was a winner. My husband asked me to make this again soon.

This is the best burger recipe! Because feta is not the greatest melting cheese I crumbled and added it straight to the meat mixture; Delicious!

This is a great burger, very satisfying. Easy to make and a great alternative to a standard beef burger. As a Greek it hits all the right notes with me. Use good quality feta (preferrably Greek) from a Mediterranian speciality store if possible. Delicious cooked on the grill.

This was a great meal. I was afraid they would be dry, but they were moist and flavorful.

These were great even though I overcooked them (next time I'll pay closer attention to the timing). I like spice, so I will add a bit more of the cinnamon and cayenne next time. Served with hummus and sliced tomato.

These were great! We followed the recipe exactly and the burgers were delicious.

We've made this with ground chicken and ground turkey and the burgers are wonderful. Mixing some feta in with the meat instead of just using it to top the burgers makes them a lot better too.

Easy and tasty (I used the George Foreman grill - gasp- and made smaller thinner ones) I think chopping the mint very finely made it taste fresh without being overwhelming.

We love lamb and enjoyed this easily made recipe. I think it would also work to grill the burgers when the weather here permits. The mint is a definite compliment so be sure not to leave it out.

We love lamb and this was something new to try on a Monday night. It's delicious!! You don't need so much salt (especially with the hummus) or mint (we didn't want the mint to be overpowering). Very quick and easy and a great dish.

My husband and I made this last night after work and thought they were quite good. Unfortunately, we had trouble finding fresh mint at this time of year so we substituted dry. I'm sure fresh mint would make this recipe stellar but all them same, we found them to be fantastic even without.
