I decided to make chocolate dipped strawberries for two different parties last weekend. And I decided it was time for me to try to temper the chocolate I was using for the fruit. The short story is: 1) It's real nuisance; and 2) it wasn't necessary.

After trying too many different ways to temper chocolate, I finally stumbled onto this method ... and then checked Epicurious. Sheesh. I found that a smaller pot for the chocolate, moved in and out of the larger one, works well ... and is easier to handle than a hot bowl. After the chocolate has melted and you've seeded it and are waiting for it to cool, it helps to reduce the temperature in the larger pot to the low 90's. That way, keeping the chocolate in the smaller pot from overheating is far easier as you move it on and off the larger pot to keep the temp between 88 and 91. Once you get above 91, you have to start all over. Using two thermometers helps, as you want to keep an eye on the warm water as well as the chocolate, and don't want to get water into the chocolate.

Please note: this method of tempering is called seeding. In order for it to work the chocolate you add when cooling to 80F must already be tempered. If you're working with bloomed chocolate in the first place this method might not work.
