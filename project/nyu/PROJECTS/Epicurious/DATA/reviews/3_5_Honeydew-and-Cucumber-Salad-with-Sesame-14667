i love this salad, and add a large handful of cilantro for a really interesting twist. i bring it often to potlucks...also love to pair it with korean BBQ chicken or short ribs.

I added red peppers for a color contrast. Very fresh and flavorful side dish. Nice to serve with a spicy main dish.

I make this recipe frequently and it is always a hit. I add some julianne mangoes and sweet red peppers for color contrast and it works well with the ginger in the dressing. Will keep making it. Delicious!!!

Great salad, I was also unsure of the combination at first, but it turned out great. I served it with Korean-style steaks with spicy cilantro sauce (in epicurious too) and steamed rice. Great way to use honeydews in summertime.

Really good! A little too much on the green side, but tasty...

Very good! I wasn't sure about the combination of ingredients, but I read the reviews and gave it a shot. I'm glad I did. The sesame oil really tied it all together. Absolutely make again. Would be great to take to a party/bbq. It's a 3.5 forker!

Excellent way to use up part of a large honeydew, and a great way to encorporate fruit into the main part of a meal. I thought the salad had a very nice flavor, but I substituted 1 tso Korean hot bean paste for the red pepper, omitted the vegetable oil, and doubled the remaining sauce ingredients for a lighter salad. Very good when served with white rice & a spicy Thai basil beef stirfry w/onions & yellow peppers.

I served this with fried rice and sweet garlic eggplant. It is lovely - subtle and refreshing. Everyone liked it!
