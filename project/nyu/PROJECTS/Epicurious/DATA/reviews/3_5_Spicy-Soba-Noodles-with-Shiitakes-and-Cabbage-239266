good quick dinner recipe. easily adapted to different ingredients and still delicious. used fresh shitakes, purple cabbage, some Kamfen "vegetable noodles" we found at the asian market instead of soba, and sriacha instead of korean paste. it worked well to cook frozen edamame until water began to boil again, then added noodles for 4 minutes - both cooked well without being overcooked.

I would actually give this recipe three and a half forks if i could. The only change i made to the recipe this time was to steep a few pieces of dried shitake in the sauce, to deepen the flavor (which i did because so many reviewers said the flavor was bland). The flavor of the dish was really great and really pronounced. In future, i would make two changes. One, i would use less soba. I agree with the others who have said that the noodle-to-veg ratio is too heavy. But then, i really love my veg. Two, i would cook the edamame separately from the soba. Adding frozen edamame to the boiling water along with the noodles interrupts the proper cooking of the noodles because it brings the water temperature way too far down and it takes too long for the temp to come back up. My soba was not exactly the consistency it's supposed to be. Aside from that, great recipe, super easy, will definitely be in my regular rotation!

I came across this recipe in an old magazine at a clinic a few months ago. I have been dying to try it ever since and finally did tonight. Because of budget issues I switched out the Shiitake mushrooms for the cheaper white ones at the store. It was quick and easy to make, packed full of flavor and just over all awesome imo. This is a new favorite for me and will become a regular in this house. And the best part is, the recipe is easy to vary so you can or take out whatever you like.

Meh. Given how much I love all the ingredients in this dish, I was surprised at how underwhelmed I was while eating it. As someone else mentioned, its a good way to use up these ingredients if you have them on hand, but otherwise its not worth making really.

Did anyone else think there were too many soba noodles??? I will make this again but cut that down to 1/3 of the 9 ounces called for. The shiitakes and cabbage are so flavorful on their own there is no need to drown the vegetables in noodles!

Really good recipe with adaptations from other reviewers! I also omitted the water and used 1/4c soy and remainder sesame oil to make 1/3 cup of liquid for sauce. I subbed siracha for the hot pepper paste (I used 2.5t and that was a bit too spicy for me and the hubby). I also added carrots for color and taste, as well as tofu (which I fried in sesame oil). Super yummy and will definitely make it into our rotation again!

This recipe was very easy, and very tasty. It was my first time to cook or eat soba noodles, and it definitely won't be my last! I will make a few modifications next time, however. I followed the recipe exactly, and was not pleased with the lack of colour of the final product. Next time I'll take a previous reviewer's suggestion and try substituting purple cabbage. I also think the addition of another root vegetable, such as carrots would bring out the subtle sweetness of the dish.

excellent dish. I was out of sesame seeds so added a little toasted sesame oil to the dressing, I used purple cabbage, and added some julienned carrots. It was easy, good and very colorful.

This recipe was very flavorful and I'll definitely use this one again. I too made some modifications. Based on one of the Reviewers, I didn't use the water, but instead used 1/4 cup of vinegar, filling up to 1/3 cup of sesame oil. The Grocery didn't didn't have fresh Napa cabbage, so I used bok choy instead.

This is delicious! I have to say, however, that I didn't follow the recipe to the letter. I used part water and part rice vinegar for the sauce, and instead of soy sauce, I used Tamari, and instead of Korean hot pepper sauce, I used Sriracha. In the vegetable mixture, I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. My husband LOVES it! YAY!

This was really good... I used dried shitake mushrooms and, after soaking them in water, used some of the resulting broth for the sauce.

This recipe, with a few tweaks, was EXCELLENT, and I will definitely be making it again. After reading several reviews about the recipe being bland, I followed some peoples suggestion about adding rice vinegar, and also added some sesame oil. I basically omitted the water altogether and used about 1/4 cup of the vinegar and filled the remainder (to equal 1/3 cup total) with the sesame oil. I found this version of the sauce to be absolutely essential in rounding out the flavors of this dish. I also probably used closer to 3 or 4 tablespoons of ginger, which was great, and added some frozen shrimp, letting them cook in the steam from the veggies and sauce. Altogether, this made for a great combo of flavors!

Delicious! Instead of hot pepper paste i used a brazilian chili sauce and it worked out just as well. The dish is a bit salty so if you have an issue with salt consumption you might want to add more water and less soy sauce or use a low sodium alternative like braggs.

It was very easy to make tasted great. When I made it again I'll use a litte more cabbage though.

I made this for dinner last night - my roommates and I thought it was delicious. We added chicken for some extra protein as well as carrots, and used whole wheat noodles instead of soba. I'm sure it would have been better with soba noodles, but we didn't have any on hand. We made this to use up an excess amount of napa cabbage from our farmshare. It did the trick, but I'm not sure that I would run out and buy cabbage to make it again. It wasn't THAT amazing. It was pretty easy to make, though.

I had a very picky eater over for dinner when I made this and even he cleaned his plate. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, with the exception of using Sriracha sauce in place of the chile paste and using low sodium soy sauce. It still came out great. It definitely took me longer than 30 mins to make, but I just might be a slow prep-er. It was a lot of chopping, but worth it for a delicious and healthy meal. The recipe is a good base, and I could see it working with many other vegetables.

I revised to cook for one with what I had on hand. Asparagus, regular mushroom, I grated the ginger and garlic with the plane and used Thai style chili sauce and regular cabbage. I cooked the mushrooms and asparagus for 4 min. added the cabbage and scallions for 4 min and sauce for 6. I added hot pepper oil to the dish as I ate it, but I like hot stuff. I used up the left over noodle s very nicely

This was very tasty. I made it with some unidentified noodles in my cupboard which I think were somen noodles, not soba noodles--it would have been even better with the stronger taste of the buckwheat. You could even increase the cabbage--a good way to get rid of a giant head of napa cabbage.

Suprisingly good, cabbage worked a lot better than I would have thought. A big hit with the vegetarian we had over last night, since apparently vegetarians don't eat ribs (for shame).

Eh...The mushrooms and edamame were the best part.

This is a very easy and adaptable recipe. If you like it spicy, like we do, then use Sriracha because we never have Korean Chile Paste in the cupboard. Substitute other veggies and even different kinds of noodles. A bit of Rice Wine Vinegar gives the sauce good balance. Umami!

Blah. No real kick to the sauce. Peanuts would be good to add some texture.

This was a very good light meal for the middle of the week. Super simple to make as well. Went with the Chinese chile paste, because that was what I had. I did not find the dish spicy at all, next time will add a little more chile paste.

Prep/cook time was average. I substituted red cabbage just because that's what I had. The result looked like it was from another planet--purple with blobs of green from the edamame--but pretty bland in spite of how much garlic and ginger are in there. If I made this again (big maybe) I would definitely add a couple of tablespoons of rice vinegar to the sauce to give it some acid kick.

Good healthy weeknight recipe. It's not very spicy though, so next time I'll increase the amount of chili paste.

Rating: 0
I've only made the sauce, for other dishes. It helps to use warm water, as the chili paste and brown sugar dissolve better. And reduce the amount of soy sauce if you don't like a really salty taste. There are different kinds of Korean chile paste - some hotter than others. Check to see if the jar has some kind of note about the hotness level.

not worth the work, too salty as well, would reduce the soya sauce to half the amount.

Have made this recipe twice for my family and it's a hit. However, I added some shrimp just to make it a bit more substantial, and because I had some shrimp that needed to be eaten.

This was not spicy and overall, just ok. A lot of work for a little taste. I think I'll find another recipe.
