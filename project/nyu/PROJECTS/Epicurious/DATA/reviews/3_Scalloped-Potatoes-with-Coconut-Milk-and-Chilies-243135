I took the advice of some of the other reviewers into consideration when I made this for Thanksgiving. I kind of "pre-baked" it, and then finished it in a pretty hot oven to get a brown crust. My husband and I loved it, but it was a little spicy for other palates at the table. Oh well.

Was disappointed. 45 minutes is not enough time for these potatoes. Gave it another half hour or so, and even then, none of the flavors married together particularly well. Making the Masala was an adventure however, and I look forward to using it with other dishes.

I sliced my potatoes thinner (thanks other commenters) and had no problems with doneness. I also dotted the top with butter, just because. The result was terrific and tasted very "restaurant-y". The masala was a revelation, and I'm looking forward to using it in other applications. I'm also going to try adding cauliflower next time I make this recipe. One thing: the curry leaves are lovely, but if you can't find them, don't let it stop you. This would still be great without them.

This recipe has great flavors. The coconut milk and spice paste taste so good together. But, 1/4" is far too thick for scalloped potatoes to cook at 350 for 45min. If you cook them as written, it will take about two hours and the potatoes will not brown on top or really absorb the beautiful coconut mixture. Here is what I would change when I make it again, and I definitely will make it again (I am right now). 1. Cut potatoes to 1/8". 2. Heat oven to 450. 3. Make 6 thinner layers. These are small changes that will make a big difference in your results and this should take 45min.

Try this dish with sweet potatoes for even more flavor!

This was a disappointment. I made it as written and found that the potatoes were still raw. I cooked it for another 15-20 mins and still had some undercooked potatoes. The nuked leftovers the next day were much better.

The complicated part of this recipe is making the masala, but if your kitchen is very well-stocked with lots of spices, you'll have no problems whatsoever. This is a very easy dish to make. Might've added a little bit more masala and coconut milk but otherwise, wouldn't change it when making this again.
