Excellent, perfect, no need to worry about another dish. As someone suggested - jpalimpsest -, crushed anise seed and orange zest and more parmesan go perfectly well. Love love love love it. And my neighbors too.

Delicious recipe!! A sure crowd pleaser! I paired this with seared scallops and sugar peas in their shells -- amazing! I also doubled the parmesan and ginger.

A simple and delicious recipe. Served this with a caesar salad for a quick, healthy week night dinner. I made two substitutions only because I didn't have a couple of the ingredients. Substituted beef stock for the chicken stock and cooking sherry/water for the white wine. Kids (11 and 13) loved it.

Awesome,perfect and easy recipe to make for a cold winter evening. I added sauteed spinach to the risotto. I am planning on making this as a side dish for Thanksgiving.

Very good but need to increase fresh ginger. Also added a splash of ginger liquore!

Folks, just remember you don't actually have to stir risotto constantly. Two recent articles from America's Test Kitchen show that you can reduce, or even nearly eliminate, all the stirring as long as you use techniques that agitate the Arborio grains enough for them to release their starch. I've done it their way multiple times and the results is just as creamy and MUCH easier.
