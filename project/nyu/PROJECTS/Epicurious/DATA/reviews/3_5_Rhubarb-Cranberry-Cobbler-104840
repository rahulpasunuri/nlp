I'll try this as soon as I figure out how to "unthaw" frozen rhubarb.

My family doesn't like rhubarb but they loved this! I didn't have cranberries so I used raspberries instead. We had it with vanilla icecream. It was very tasty. I will be making this all summer!

This was very tasty. I made it to take to Sunday dinner at my parent's house, and everyone enjoyed it, even my kids. I did make a few alterations to the recipe, though. First of all, I used dried cranberries and I used orange juice instead of cranberry juice. I also added a bit of lemon zest to both the fruit and topping and it was a nice addition.

I just couldn't bring myself to put cranberries into a summer dish! I know, it's my narrow-mindedness, but to me, they are a quintessial winter fruit! I did this with 9 cups of fresh rhubarb, and was going to omit the concentrate completely, but panicked at the last moment, and used tart red cherry juice concentrate (which I always have in the fridge, as opposed to the cranberry). I think it is a really easy recipe (the chopping rhubarb took the longest, and would obviously be eliminated by the use of frozen). I think the precooking of the fruit made it nice and mellow, and it's just the right amount of sugar as written for me. I'm always in need of recipes to use up my rhubarb, so this is great. I will try it with the cranberries as written in the fall/winter, using the rhubarb that I inevitably fill the freezer with.

Can you stand more tinkering with this recipe? I also made a crumb topping, but Calgary's recipe made far too much. Use 1 cup oats, 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 4-6 Tbsp butter, and spices as you like. Reduce sugar in fruit, as well, but don't omit the ginger; it goes great with rhubarb. I simply sprinkled the topping on the raw fruit and baked it for 45 minutes or an hour -- until browned and bubbly. I'd do the same for a cobbler crust.

The recipe was good, but was way too sweet for my taste. Next time I'd cut the sugar by half (for both the fruit and cobbler components) and grate some lemon peel into the cobbler part. I used fresh rhubarb and no concentrate and it came out grand.

Thank you to the cook from Calgary for the recipe-it's exactly what I wanted!!

For the cook from North Potomac, MD. For the topping I used 1 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups rolled oats, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 cup butter or margarine at room temperature. Mix all ingredients together until crumbly. Enjoy!!!

I have made this DELIGHTFUL cobbler 4 or 5 times now. The only complaint I get is "why didn't you make more in a larger dish ?" I used the FRESH rhubarb and followed the recipe to the "T". It is a little tart but the french vanilla ice cream mellowed the 'tang'. The last time I made a double batch and froze the results in a 9x9 inch baking dish after baking the filling. It will now be ready for a quick addition of topping when "special" guests drop by. Loving this cobbler from Oregon.

This was a great dessert. It sounds like it would be tart, but it isn't. (Though it does have a nice little zing.) I think I might have beat the crust a bit too much, because mine came out cake like, rather then crumbled. I am used to a crumble crust for most cobblers. It still tasted great and didn't keep anyone from cleaning their plate. It took longer then 45 minutes to get the fruit filling to bubble in the first round of baking, if you have an older oven plan on an hour.

My husband does not like cobblers. I made this as a crisp (using oatmeal, sugar, flour and butter as a topping). It was fantastic. I think the cranberry concentrate could be omitted.

To the cook from Montreal: I haven't made this, yet, but I believe that the total cooking time is correct as given. The first cooking period is to give the fruit a chance to stew and thicken. The second is to bake the crust. Ignore the egg sandwich folks - there are many helpful people on this site.

I am almost afraid to ask this question because of the avalanche of scorn I'm sure will descend on my head from the 'egg-sandwich' crowd. However....I'm not an experienced cook and I would like to make this dish. Can anyone tell me if the TOTAL cooking time is 1 hr 15 minutes (the initial 30 mins for the fruit plus an additional 45 minutes after the topping is added) or is the total cooking time 45 minutes (just an extra 15 minutes after the topping goes on) Sorry to be so stupid but 1 hr 15 mins seems like a very long cooking time for a fruit dessert. I'd really appreciate some guidance.

As with frozen blackberries, the rhubarb "takes" the sugar better if it's left frozen. Try this recipe in individual large ramekins, all set on a baking sheet to catch any drips.

This is fun to make and it's fun to watch the little ones take a cranberry and eat it plain.

These reviews were not at all helpful. Everyone was more concerned about being critical of the recipe and glib; no reference to the quality or taste of the dessert was made. If it's sarcasm they're shooting for, this ain't the place!!
