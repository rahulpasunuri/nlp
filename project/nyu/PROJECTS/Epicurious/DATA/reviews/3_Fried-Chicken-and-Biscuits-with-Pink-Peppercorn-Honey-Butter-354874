I made this for company and they loved it. It is now a family favorite. You should really have a thermometer to keep the oil at the right temp. I used hot pepper flakes when I did made mine. I am making it again by special request for my daughter and all of her friends for a party on Saturday night.

Granted it's much more difficult to regulate temperature on a stove top fry method than a deep fryer... I added more seasoning to the buttermilk brine, added more seasoning to the flour mixture, was careful to season the chicken before it was dredged, and still felt it was lacking in flavor. I was hoping this would be the best fried chicken ever - it was moist...and part of it might be my lack of correct kitchen equipment, the coating had more of a tempura texture than a traditional crunchy fried chicken, but I'd rather pick up carry out than go to all the trouble and subsequent clean up this requires.
