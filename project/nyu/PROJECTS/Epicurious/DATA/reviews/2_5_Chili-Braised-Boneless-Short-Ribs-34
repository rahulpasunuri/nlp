I made this bc it was easy and wanted to use some of my many dried chili peppers in the pantry. Like others said, this was surprisingly bland and boring. I tried doctoring it up at end first using Mexican Maggi sauce, then a splash of cider vinegar to give it some life, and amazingly, not only did it not improve it any, it tasted the same-- bland. I sprinkled some fresh cilantro on at end and ate it w/o much satisfaction. Gave a lot of thought as to why this dish went so wrong. My hypothesis is the chilis. I would use guajillo, ancho, or chipotle chilis b/c they have some kick to them. The New Mexico Chili did NOTHING for this dish, they might as well not have been in it. I make stew that tastes better than this. Wish I had made that instead actually! Sorry for the rant, but it is rare I get so disappointed in a recipe. This was one of those times.

My first bite of this I liked. But the more I ate it, the more boring and pre-prepared it tasted. It's super easy, though, and if you like enchilada sauce, you might like it. I had originally wanted to prepare my ribs Asian style, but settled on this because of a shorter marinating time. Next time I'll try what I originally wanted to do. I will be fair, though: This could be a good winter dish served with jazzed up mashed potatoes (garlic mashed? wasabi mashed? or a nice rough mash of skin-on new potatoes with scallions butter and cream).

We were very disappointed with this recipe. Although the ribs were very tender, they didn't have the flavor that we've enjoyed with other recipes. The enchilada sauce did not serve this recipe well.

Maybe my family is easy to please but they LOVED it! Leftovers didn't make it past 11am the next day! I'll have to make this one repeatedly, no doubt. It was super easy and I can appreciate that. A winner in my house.

My experience didn't match those of other reviewers. It tasted like ribs in enchilada sauce. Easy to make though.

This is FABULOUS and EASY!!!! I have made this several times and consider it a standard for hearty eating. Marinate at least overnight - longer is even better. Two ribs/serving will suffice. Try it.

MUCH easier than my version of Arizona chile paste sauce plus roasted garlic/onion//herbs + worcestershire + balsamic + rice wine vinegar. The Hoisin sauce is the trick. Who would have thought something so good could be this easy? Prefer 325 for 3.5 hours myself (tenderness), but that's splitting hairs.
