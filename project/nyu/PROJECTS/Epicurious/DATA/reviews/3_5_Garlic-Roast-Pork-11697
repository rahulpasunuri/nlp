The meat from this dish is both tasty and moist. It's a long time since I've enjoyed roast pork as much as I enjoyed this recipe. As usual, the easy, simple recipes give the best results. It was so, so easy to prepare and loved by all the family. This one stays in my recipe box.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a disappointment. The rub was good and the pork was quite garlic infused, which my family loves, but the gravy--a disaster. My husband made it (that's his holiday job and he's very good at it) and he followed the recipe despite his misgivings about 4 cups of water. He was right--the gravy tasted like dishwater and although we valiantly tried everything we could think of to doctor it (including--gasp!--Gravy Master) we ended up tossing it and served the pork with mustard and some horseradish sauce (which is actually supposed to accompany the roast beef here on this site, but my sister had made a special request for it, so it was on the table). This recipe was easy to prep, so it was no big loss there, but I won't do this one again--especially with twelve people sitting around the table, waiting for their holiday dinner!

This was delicious and very easy to make. Butcher only had pork rib roast available, so I used this instead of the fresh ham. The rub was so good on the finished roast, I could have eaten the whole crust myself. I used chicken broth instead of water for gravy and also periodically added 1/2 cup of chicken broth to pan while pork was roasting to keep onions from burning (everything tends to char to a crisp in the bottom of my pan if I'm not careful). Also, just mashed onions down and didn't strain gravy. Delicious!

I actually used this recipe to rub on a pork loin roast (boneless) it was about 3 lbs, and was in for about 1 hr & 45 min... The gravy was really good, but my husband prefers more savory dishes, so I kicked it up a bit with some more garlic & pepper.

really good, but, I roasted to an internal temp of 155 and it could have been done at 150 and been even better. The gravy is a must.

I love pork and love garlic but did not like this dish very much. Don't know what it is. Others like it though. Not a keeper.

170 degrees yields a gray, stringy roast. Cook to 150, take out of the oven, let rest until internal temp reaches 160. Tons of research has been done on this, I continue to be amazed how many recipes direct cooks to destroy their meat.

I don't make roasts very often but this recipe turned out just great. I made it for the first time for guests and they loved it.

I only gave this recipe a 3 because I did not try the gravy. The pork was wonderful and will definitely fix it again.
