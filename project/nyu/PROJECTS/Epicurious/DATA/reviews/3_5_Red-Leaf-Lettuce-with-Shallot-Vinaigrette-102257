At first I thought this recipe was way too little dressing for a salad that serves 6, but it proved to be just right. Tangy and delicious - how simple! My guests loved it! They thought it had garlic in it, and they all marveled that it was just shallots!

I usually don't go for mustard much but this salad hit the right spot and I found it quite enjoyable.

Yum! This is a delicious and flavorful easy salad dressing to prepare with ingedients that are on hand. I sent my husband to the farmer's market for more shallots so that we could prepare the dressing again this weekend!

I loved the simplicity of the salad and the salad dressing has a nice bite to it! For more mild mannered eaters, I sometimes add a little more oil to soften the edge of the mustard.

I disagree with the previous reviewer...I thought this salad was simple, but quite flavorful. I did add some chopped, fried bacon just because I had it on hand. It was a nice addition, but not necessary. I served this salad along side the orange roughy ala greque (also an epicurious recipe) and it complemented it very well.

This is an 'okay' salad - somewhat on the bland side.
