Sauce was wa-ay too much for the final product. Half would still be plenty. I love beets, but the flavor of the puree was just, "meh". Fun to make, but not worth the time.

Pretty good dish. The cooking times were way off in my experience. Both the pork and the potatoes took much about twice as long to cook as anticipated. Also, the leek and beet puree was very tasty but yielded far far more than needed
