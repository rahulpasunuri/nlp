Great breakfast. I made this by prepping the fruit in the evening, then assembling individual servings in the morning. I combined vanilla and plain yogust to cut some of the sweetness. Like others commented, it did become very runny in a short time.

To speed up the process, I often use whole berry cranberry sauce instead of fresh cranberries and applesauce. With a side of granola served on the side, it's delicious and always a HUGE hit.

Fabulous!!! I actually added the crunch from the baileys pudding parfait recipe to the top of this parfait in themorning before serving and it was spectacular!!!

Instead of a big bowl, I made 7 individual parfaits in tall ice cream sundae glasses. Easier to serve. Mine did not seem watery at all the next morning.

Am so surprised this isn't an all-around hit: here it was one of top one or two favorite new recipes all last year! At brunch, friends were silent when first tasting, then said, Wow, yummy. It's an unusual combination of tart cranberry, sweet fruit and creamy yogurt. I made night before, skipped tangerines (perhaps cause of runniness?) and used homemade applesauce (skins on, no sugar added) and low-fat vanilla yogurt. Made 6 cups, only 133 calories / 1 fat gram per 1/2 cup. Looked stunning in glass bowl!!

Attractive but nothing special, and too watery.

Made this for Christmas morning and it was pretty good, but nothing to die for. I am sure alot of it depends on the flavor of the fruit which was not spectacular. It was really runny and did not hold up for leftovers. I would try something new before making this again.

Mine looked just like the picture and was beautiful on the table, UNTIL someone spooned into it. Was a runny mess, and not at all appetizing on the plate or trifle bowl after being dished out. (Used the cranberry version with super chunky applesauce). My leftovers are going down the disposal. Next Christmas, for a make ahead dish -- I will just use some jazzed up fresh melon/pineapple and not bother with this.

I made this recipe last night to serve 10 kids and 10 adults. I doubled the recipe... and barely had enough. I decided to make individual parfaits and made the kids parfaits 1/2 the size of the adults. Although it took quite awhile to put these little individual servings together, it got great reviews from the kids and very good reviews from the adults. I changed the cranberries to raspberries and mixed them with the chunky applesauce. I used the boxed frozen sweetened raspberries and drained them before mixing with the applesauce. Since I made the cranberry change, I skipped the sugar/water step. I used all the other fruits as well as the vanilla yogurt and the cinnamon as instructed. I topped it with a sliced strawberry and a little piece of kiwi. I assembled it about 8 hours before, and it did get runny like the other reviewers said, but it was contained in everyone's little glass and still looked pretty...it wasn't a soupy mess. It's rare to find recipes that please 10 kids and 10 adults and this one did!! Wow!

Was going to make this for a holiday brunch. Is the serving size of 6 correct?

The dish was beautiful! And tasty. A perfect brunch selection. However, as soon as we sliced into it, we had a runny mess! Any suggestions to reduce the liquid? I would like to prepare this again, but with more success.

This was a very pretty dessert. I would definitely make the following changes. Reduce the cooking time of the fresh cranberries by one half. Otherwise, they get too mushy and not like the photo at all. Second, reduce the applesauce by one half. It makes for a more satisfying taste experience - you see and taste cranberries with the yogurt, and not "cranberry-flavored applesauce."

I've made this twice for guests now and it's a wonderful breakfast dish. I didn't add the cinnamon and I used banana or peach yogurt to add some flavour. Very attractive in the trifle dish!l;

This recipe looked beautiful, but was very runny, lacked flavor except for the overpowering cinnmamon and yogurt flavor. Very disappointing and wasteful, as we threw most of it away.

Beautiful presentation. Guests enjoyed the unusual combination of flavors. Many requests for the recipe afterwards. Leftovers were much enjoyed as well, although not quite as picturesque!

A hit with my entire family! It was easy to prepare, looked great and tasted fabulous. My family loved how light it was. A new holdiay addition.

Excellent flavor and presentation. I used regular applesauce and would do the chunky (as it calls for) next time just to reduce the runniness. I used nonfat yogurt to lighten it up. The cinnamon adds an interesting zip to the yogurt.

Looks beautiful and not too sweet. Recommend not making it too far ahead - i made it the night before and it got very juicy on the bottom.

I served this dish as part of a Christmas Brunch buffet. The recipe comments are right about how great it looks on the table. And it tastes great too! Our family has done the same dishes for Christmas Brunch for 10 years. We now have a new addition to our favorites!
