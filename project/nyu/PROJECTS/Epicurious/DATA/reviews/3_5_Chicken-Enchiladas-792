I felt this was about 3 1/2 folks, really good but not quite exceptional. I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and it worked fine. The key is the enchilada sauce and I followed another reviewer's recommendation and used Trader Joe's sauce, a very good choice. I also chopped up a jalapeno and added it to the green pepper and onion. I only used 24 oz, of sauce, which seemed about right It's not hard, but it does take some time to assemble. Served it with guacamole instead of sour cream and refried beans.

This was a very good recipe. I added diced green chilies and cilantro to the onion mix for a little more flavor. Will definitely make again.

I thought this recipe was ok. Nothing special. Make sure and buy the right enchilada sauce. The one that we got was kinda bitter and we didn't really like it too much. Other than that, the recipe is ok. Hard to screw up.

I make this all of the time - I use a store-bought rotisserie chicken and it is a fairly easy dish. Always gets great reviews.

Rating: 3
Although this recipe is relatively easy to prepare, it is missing what I feel to be traditional Mexican flavors. To that end, I added one diced jalepeno pepper, cumin to tase, and dried cilantro (omitting the basil and oregano). Additionally, I added three tablespoons of chocolate mole to the sauce for added depth. I was quite satisfied with the results of these changes.

I made these last night for my husband who'd been craving enchiladas. They were a big hit! I used chicken thighs because they were on sale, cooked them in a skillet on the stovetop, then used some of the rendered fat in exchange for the vegetable oil used to cook the onions, (I omitted the green pepper). Combining the chicken with the onion mixture before filling the tortillas simplefied things and ensured that it would all be evenly doled out. I whipped together the oft- referred-to Emeril's sauce recipe; very easy and much better than store- bought. I also opted to dip the tortillas in the sauce which many reviewers recommended; messy but worthwhile.

Las Palmas canned sauce is very good. I don't fry my tortillas. I take a stack and wrap them in moistened paper towels then wrap that in a tea towel. I microwave it for a minute or two until soft and pliant. Working quickly, I finish the recipe. It saves time and calories.

I agree with the reviewer who said that this dish hinges upon good enchilada sauce. Here in Seattle we are pretty lacking in Mexican ingredients (especially compared to when I lived in Los Angeles) so I used Las Palmas brand enchilada sauce. It was that or La Victoria. I am going to keep an eye out for good canned Enchilada sauce (or make my own). The result was good but not great. I agree with others that adding a japapeno to the saute would kick it up. Also, I was lazy so made it into a layered casserole instead of rolling up enchiladas. I liked this alot - much faster!

My husband and I love these enchiladas. We like them extra spicy so always use Hot enchilada sauce and add a diced jalapeno or two to the onion and pepper saute. Sour cream is a must to serve with!!!

Everyone loved this! I used canned sauce and mixed 1/2 regular and 1/2 spicy. I also added finely chopped chipotle in adobo to the sauce mixture. I used flour tortilas instead of corn. It was a huge hit, all of my friends want to know when I'm making it again so they can come over!

I made 2 versions of this recipe (6 enchiladas each): One with Trader Joe's Enchilada sauce and one with Trader Joe's Red Mole sauce, cut with 1/2 bottle of TJ regular enchilada sauce. I used an already roasted chicken and a mix of TJ shredded cheese (reg. and low-fat) to make it easier on myself -- it still took a bit of time to prepare, but I felt it was worth it. It was a big hit in my family. I liked the Mole version better, but my husband liked the regular version. I agree that the key is getting a flavorful sauce. I like Trader Joe's brands. I used 1.5 bottles of TJ reg. sauce for reg. dish and 3/4 jar Red Mole plus 1/2 bottle reg TJ enchilada sauce for Mole dish and had MORE than enough sauce for both dishes. I served the dish with sour cream, guacamole, tortilla chips, spanish rice (love NearEast brand -- so EZ), refried beans, and a small salad. It was a feast.

This recipe was very good. Tasted very authentic. I made a few changes however. I added a chipotle in adobe sauce to the enchilada sauce (which I made using Emeril's recipe) I also didn't fry the corn tortillas, but sauteed them in a frying pan with just a few drops of oil. I also seasoned the onions and peppers with cumin and cayenne and added them to the shredded chicken and sauce with about 1/2 cup of cheese. This was a quick, flavourful weekday meal because I bought a roasted chicken from the grocery store. Will definitely make again.

Yes, very good, my first try at enchiladas and I have been asked to make them again. I couldn't find the 11/4 emeril mole sauce (maybe it was removed for copyright reasons), but you can find it easily through Google and worth doing. Heating up the tortillas in the oven didn't soften them enough, so next time will heat through on a non-stick pan, it makes a difference. Don't like green peppers, so used red. Start to out of the oven was 2 hours, not difficult, but not a quick after work job. Also, I always like to make dishes like this the day before so the flavors mend.

Rating: 3
This was a good recipe, made better by taking advice from previous reviews. I made the following changes based on reviews: warm tortillas in 350 oven for 5 minutes (healthier, quicker, less of a mess) and make homemade sauce from the Emeril recipe posted 11/04. I liked the enchiladas, husband and kids not wild about it. But they think of Mexican food as "exotic", just to give you an idea of what I'm up against. While I might not go to the trouble of making this for my way too picky family, I will probably make for potluck type events.

I make this recipe fairly often--it's GOOD! I usually omit the bell peppers and add a little cumin when sauteing the onions. I also add some homemade refried beans to in each tortilla, if we happen to have them around, and usually throw in some jalapenos or salsa for spice. The leftovers are even better than dinner!

Rating: 4
Oh, wow. This was my first attempt at enchiladas, and did I ever pick a winner! I forgot to warm the tortillas, so a couple of them cracked, but once filled and covered with cheese, it didn't matter. I used canned enchilada sauce, one can each hot and mild Old El Paso, and it was great. Probably will be even better with homemade sauce, but I just didn't have the time this go-round. I took the suggestion of those who said to just dip the tortillas in the enchilada sauce, and then poured about another half cup on top before sprinkling with a Mexican four-cheese blend. Passed the rest of the sauce. I also increased the basil and oregano in the onion/pepper mix, since I couldn't imagine 1/2 teaspoon each would be enough for a dish like this, and I'm very glad I did. I made a test batch last night with leftover grilled chicken, since I want to serve it at a Mexican themed party I'm having this weekend. Spouse and I both agreed that it was a hit.

For those who are looking for a "variation" on traditional canned enchilada sauce -- try looking for Mole ("MOL-ay") (I prefer Green) or Pipian (pumpkin seeds) in the hispanic food section. I found it in my standard supermarket, but you may have to try the tiny bodega on the corner. The jar you purchase is 4:1 concentrate that you mix with water or broth. Dont make the whole jar at once, and it takes some stirring to get it to combine, but once you do, its fantastic. Try it as a replacement!!

Ground chicken is a definite time saver. Experiment with different cheese. Another time saver is to bake them flat, in layers, instead of rolled.

Rating: 3
Great and easy recipe. I simplified by combining the onion/bell pepper mixture (after cooking) with the cheese and the chicken. Instead of placing each tortilla in a pan w/oil to heat & soften, I lightly brushed oil onto one side of each tortilla, stacked them oiled side to non-oiled side on a plate and heated them in the micro for 45 seconds or so. Does the job equally as well, but with far less mess, oil and time. Technically I am married, but live a life that closer resembles that of a single mother of three small children, as my husband works long hours as a business owner. I greatly appreciate any shortcuts that don't cut back too much on flavor or health, so I am all for the canned sauce. However, I do need to find a better quality sauce than the one I used this time! :) I made this with the "Mexican White Rice" from this site, also with a couple improvisations so it would suit my tastes better.

Rating: 4
This is a really good recipe. For those who frown on purchased sauce I agree some are not that great but Hatch Red Enchilada sauce is best next to homemade if you can find it. Also we like our enchiladas a little more dry so I cook them covered for approx 20 minutes, uncover and pour some sauce on at the end then top with cheese and bake for another 10-15 minutes, but that's just our taste!

Rating: 3
First - to those who complained - get over it. This recipe was great. I read all the reviews - and agree with most - dipped my enchiladas, used rotisserie chicken from the store and canned sauce (old el paso to be exact) - and used red peppers instead of green ..it was a huge hit. Next time I will make the Emeril's sauce ...I am a diehard chef who loves cooking from scratch - but am also a working mom who doesn't mind a shortcut every once in awhile !!

This proved a relatively easy recipe to make and the end result tasted great. For those who don't have the inclination or the expertise to make their own sauce, purchased sauce served the purpose. For those cooks from Canyon, TX, the word is generally spelled "sauteing" and sarcasm seems terribly out of place here.

Couldn't find big enough corn tortillas so I used flour. Used red, green, and yellow diced peppers. Shredded the chicken from a supermarket rotissere one. There were no left overs. Very good for a family gathering. Next time I'll make my own sauce...canned is quite salty.

This is ok as is but make your own enchilada sauce and you will never buy canned version again! I live in London and Mexican, Tex-Mex, etc is very hard to come by so you have to make your own. There is a recipe listed by an earlier reviewer for the enchilada sauce. Although I started to follow the sauce recipe exactly, the only difference I made is that I had to substitute condensed chicken soup for broth which might have made it a bit more thick (even tho I added required water to make "broth") but it was so delicious! I used shredded beef instead and received tons of compliments. The sauce is the key, so many ways to vary the sauce and the fillings.

Rating: 3
We loved this dish! I used chicken with the bone in and roasted it for about one hour before shredding it. (I find that it shreds better than boneless chicken.) I also used a Mexican blend cheese for more flavor. Be careful when you buy the enchilada sauce (look for mild or hot depending on what you like.)

This became an instant classic at our house. I doubled the cheese on top, deleted the bell pepper, and substituted red pepper flakes for the regular pepper. I also added a 7 oz can of whole green chiles, sliced into strips. I put 3 strips inside of each enchilada. I increased the chicken by 1 cup. For the sauce, I substituted Trader Joe's preservative-free Salsa Verde Sauce (32 oz size), to which I added 3 tablespoons of cumin, and 2 tbsp. of pureed garlic. We serve the enchiladas with avacado slices. I am making a double recipe for my stepdaughter to take up to college next week. Certain to score points! Every time I make it, old and young rave!

I did the recipe above pretty much as is. I used corn tortillas. I substituted in the Emeril's Enchilada Sauce and it was easy to make and worked great. This is my first time cooking enchiladas and I was very impressed with this recipe. My guests thought it was an excellent meal.

I made changes as suggested by previous reviewers and this turned out excellent. This is the first time I ever made enchiladas. I poached the chicken and made Emeril's enchilada sauce which was very, very easy, and used Pepper Jack Cheese instead of regular Jack Cheese. I used large flour tortillas and dipped rather than fried. The only change I would make next time is bake for only about 20-25 minutes. I baked for the full 30 and it could have come out sooner -- excellent though!

Not bad. I took a tip from a turkey enchilada recipe on this site and mixed the chicken, cheese, and onion filling in a bowl and added some sour cream (Naturally Yours Nonfat), then divided the filling among the flour tortillas (I know - corn is more traditional!). Once you get the hang of enchiladas you can vary the filling. My wife thinks it's great that I've learned how to make enchiladas!

I also did not fry the tortillas in oil. I warmed them in a pan and then dipped them in the sauce. I used the Emeril recepie for the sauce and that turned out good. I also added a can a serenno chiles and pepper jack cheese for extra spice. Everything turned out great!

I'm another tortilla dipper. Dip each one in some sauce and I always have leftovers that I pour over. The recipe as written is great and very versitile once you figure out how to make enchiladas.

The recipe for Emeril's Enchilada Sauce, posted in a previous review here, is very good and very simple--I had all the ingredients in my pantry. It yields about 3 1/2 cups, which is plenty for this recipe. I took the suggestion of dipping the tortillas into the sauce instead of into oil, and the enchiladas held together quite well using this method. The dish could have been a little spicier, but then the five-year-old in this house wouldn't have liked it. I think adding some chopped canned jalapenos to the filling, and maybe a little cilantro, using pepper jack cheese instead of regular jack, would have provided just the right amount of fieriness. I'll definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
I think this is a great recipe. I've made it many times and it's easy. I've noticed that a lot of enchilada recipes that I see on the internet use flour tortillas. I find this very odd since I've never in my life had an enchilada at a restaurant made with anything other than a corn tortilla, and I eat at a lot of Mexican restaurants. I'm sure the recipe is delicious made either way though. When using corn tortillas I either quickly fry them as the recipe indicates, or I dip them the corn tortillas in the enchilada sauce... this is needed to soften up the tortillas so they roll up more easily. Flour tortillas are much more pliable, so I definitely would not fry them before making this recipe.

We took many of the suggestions that other reviewers had made and the recipe turned out great. We used flour tortillas instead of corn, and dipped them in the sauce instead of pouring it on.

However, we made so many changes to the original that it seems like I am reviewing a totally new recipe! Thanks to all for the suggestions!!

LOVED IT!! The dish would rate a 4, but I had to make some modifications. First, forget the frying of tortillas. I actually substituted flour tortillas at the suggestion of my husband (who usually does all of our cooking) in order to "absorb more sauce", which I dipped instead of pouring on. Good recommendation! I agree with the reviewer who stated that these are not tacos. Enchiladas are a BAKED dish. Secondly, skip the canned sauce in favor of the Emeril Enchilada Sauce that another reviewer so generously offered. I had never made my own enchilada sauce from scratch and it was fantastic! I added two minced serrano chiles as well to give more heat (it threw a lot of heat, so perhaps next time I will use one only). I added sliced black olives and used low-fat Trader Joes cheddar cheese which worked marvelously. Added the green chiles into the chicken mixture and both my husband and I were thrilled with teh results. A definite repeat dish!

Rating: 3
This was GREAT. I took another reviewers suggestion just to dip the tortillas in the sauce instead of baking it in the whole amount. I also did not fry the tortillas to lower (sort of) the fat. The enchiladas still fell apartment when I took them out but they tasted DELICIOUS!

GREAT with the following changes- saute the onions- I used half green onion - add the spices (I omitted the green pepper). Mix in bowl with cheese, chicken, a can of green chillies and 2 T chopped fresh cilantro. Heat tortillas (both sides)- I used 6, 10" flour - in dry Teflon pan till soft and beginning to color. Spread 1 T sauce on tortilla then fill with chicken mixture. Top each with another T sauce then generously with cheese - I used extra. Bake. Heat sauce seperately then pour over enchiladas before serving and top with sliced green onions. Serve with Sour cream and chopped tomatoes. WOW!!

Possibly the best chicken enchiladas I have ever eaten. I followed all the suggestions made by Lee McWhorter in her/his review plus I added a 4 oz. can of chopped green chilis to homemade enchilada sauce. I also baked them on a large platter instead of a 13 X 9 X 2" pan so there would be more remove between the individual enchiladas and so they would not be quite so saturated in the enchilada sauce. The result was the perfect amount of crunch and made for a much nicer presentation. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I have never seen my boyfriend scarf down a plate of food so quickly!!! This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper!

This recipe turned out excellent enchilladas using some variation. I made my own enchillada sauce courtesy of: Valerie (groovbunie@aol.com) Enchilada Sauce - Emeril Lagasse 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon flour 1/4 cup chili powder (or a little less) 2 cups chicken stock 10 ounces tomato paste 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt In a medium saucepan heat oil, add flour, smoothing and stirring with a wooden spoon. Cook for 1 minute. Add chili powder and cook for 30 seconds. Add stock, tomato paste, oregano, and cumin. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and cook for 15 minutes. The sauce will thicken and smooth out. I also poached the chicken in water with chopped onion, cumin, oregano, basil, cayenne pepper, minced garlic and cilantro. I toasted my corn tortillas at 350F for 5 minutes for flavor and to crunch them up a bit. I then stuffed the tortillas with the chicken mix, pepper sautee, cheese, and a dash of the enchillada sauce and baked as recommended. Muy Bueno!

The over all taste wasn't terrible. The problem was pouring the sauce over the enchiladas and baking. The tortillas become soaked, soft and mushy during baking - it was almost impossible to get them out of the baking dish without them falling apart. I asked a Hispanic friend of mine from El Paso, TX what the problem was as this is his native cuisine. His advice was that the sauce should not be poured over the enchiladas before baking. He said his mother would heat the tortillas on a very hot dry cast iron skillet (turning as they darken slightly) rather than frying them (enchiladas are not "tacos" he said). Then each tortilla should be "dipped" in the sauce just to coat each side. Stuff the enchiladas with the filling as directed and roll up (he said everyone makes their filling a little different so this one is fine - he zips it up a bit with cilantro and a jalapeno). Anyway, bake the enchiladas as directed. Place serving portions on plates and pour the sauce over the enchiladas just before serving. Place extra sauce on the table. I tried this and it was much better. The texture of the tortillas was not mushy they held up very well and tasted great.

This recipe was very tasty and devoured by a crowd at a potluck. I poached the chicken in broth & herbs to help keep it moist.

Although difficult to hold together in such small tortillas, these were tasty! I used some cheddar cheese and added chili powder and fresh cilantro for more pizazz. I don't like sour cream much so I garnished with green onions and cilantro. Also cut the sauce amount so they wouldn't be totally swimming in it. Tasty and you can make it lowfat.
