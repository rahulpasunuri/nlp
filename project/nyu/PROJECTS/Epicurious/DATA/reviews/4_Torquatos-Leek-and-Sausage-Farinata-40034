We live on an island during the summer and cannot get endless ingredients, but try to keep Pargiano Reggiano, stone ground cornmeal, and other basics. We can get very good sausage locally. So, when I typed in sausage and cornmeal, this recipe came up. I made it exactly except that I substituted scallions and one shallot for the leeks. It was very good with a green salad from my own salad green harvest.
