I agree with evi that this is not a torte. I'd call it a coffee cake. It reminds me and my husband of the cakes served in his native Germany during afternoon tea. I ground the hazelnuts with 1/4 cup of the flour to make a fine powder. Prune plums weren't available, so I used regular plums, and it turned out fine. I served it with a side of schlag (whipped cream) at a dinner party last night. My husband loved it and is looking forward to leftovers at breakfast.

This was a nice dessert. I followed the instructions exactly and I liked the result, but it was far from being the best dessert I've ever had. Given the "torte" descriptor, I was expecting something a bit different (tortes have multiple layers, and usually are made with minimal flour). This dessert is really more of a plum CAKE. I would enjoyed it more had the batter yielded a denser (torte-like) base for the plums. That said, I arranged the plum wedges on their sides in a "spooning" position going all around the cake, and the presentation was lovely. The hazelnuts add a nice touch to the batter. It's not a bad dessert, and you can make it look gorgeous, but it's NOT a torte - it's a cake!

This torte is divine. I didn't have enough plums on hand, didn't have vanilla and didn't have allspice and it still tasted sensational. I substituted a half-teaspoon of ginger in lieu of allspice. I also didn't beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy because I was in such a rush to get it in the oven. I just mixed all the wet things in one bowl, dry in another and then mixed them together with the plums using a wooden spoon. I arranged the plums skin side down, not up, and that seemed to fix the problem with excess liquid as the plums cooked down. I also used demerara sugar, and sprinkled extra over the plums after arranging them on the batter. I baked the torte for about 40 to 45 minutes in a 10-inch, non-springform pan and it came out of the oven looking absolutely beautiful. I served it warm with Devon cream and oh my... I would like to try this recipe with different fruits, nuts and spices. Apples, walnuts and cinnamon. Pears, cardamom and pecans. Figs, pine nuts and anise...

One note - yes, you should reduce the baking time. I also tented mine with foil to prevent the top from browning too much as it cooked through.

Wonderfully delicious torte. I could not find hazelnuts so substituted walnuts. I will cut the sugar a little bit next time - it really only needed about 1/2-3/4 cup total. Great as dessert or with coffee, this is really an exceptional recipe. I literally lay awake at night craving it.

I don't want to rate this because everyone else was so happy with it, but just a warning. My oven calibrates perfectly, but 1 hr and 20 minutes was way too much. Dried out the cake and shriveled the plums beyond any hope of juiciness or flavor. Plus the bits of plum in the batter that came in contact with the edges of the pan burned, so the cake smelled horrible cooking. Check after an hour.

Ever since I found the recipe in the magazine, it has been one of my favourites. The combination of tart plums and sweet, buttery cake is incredible! I use almonds instead because thats what I usually have and it turns out great. The presentation is beautiful and it always gets rave reviews.

This is a great recipe - although I found that the taste was a little bran-like. In other words, the torte tasted too much like "health food" or something from the "natural food" store. I suspect that it might be because I used hazelnuts that weren't skinned. Do other users of this receipe use skinned hazelnuts? Otherwise, everything turned out great - consitency, doneness, mostness. My torte was not particularly sweet. Don't know if this was caused by the bran-like effect of the hazelnut skins.

We tried this recipe when we had an overabundance of Italian prunes. It was fabulous! We shared it warm with the next door neighbors and they also gave it high praise. This is such a perfect combination of hazelnuts (or filberts as we call them in Oregon) and the prunes. I baked it the full time and it was just right, a little crunchy on top and the outside, and moist and flavorful inside. I just went back and picked 4 more buckets of prunes to freeze so we will be able to enjoy this all winter.

This is a great basic recipe for a coffee-cake type cake. One trick: put the chopped fruit in a salad spinner to wring out the juices. I've also made other modifications -- added ground walnuts or almonds, used different fruit (dried fruit works well too), sprinkled the top with brown sugar to make a crispy crust. Another idea (great for the Fall) is to just make the batter without the fruit, pour into a baking dish, then add sliced apples that were prepared with sugar and cinnamon on top of the batter, cover with a crumb topping, and bake. Oh -- one note -- I never bake it as long as the recipe asks, it takes me about 1/2 the time.

I made it with pears and cardamon as another reviewer suggested and it turned out great. Will make again with plums since they are in season now.

Delicious, delicious, delicious! I followed the ingredients and directions exactly and it was yummy. I was worried about the amount of hazelnuts, thinking it would be an overbearing flavor, but it was subtle and complementary to the torte. Will make again, often!

I've made this torte regulary since the recipe was first published. When plums are out of season, it works wonderfully with pears. Sub cardemom for the allspice, and just scatter chopped pears on top.

I've been making this one ever since I found the original recipe in the magazine. It's definitely a favorite in our house. The hazelnuts are delicious, and the plums give it a nice tart-sweet flavor. It's very pretty with the plum topping, as well. We serve it with ice cream.

Rich, buttery, not too sweet, and travels well for upscale picnics! To the earlier reviewer: I mix up "torte" (cake) with "tart" (pie) all the time, and I was puzzled by this recipe, too, until I read your review.

To the cook looking for what to do with the flour mixture: the recipe says to beat butter and sugar then add eggs. Then it says to add the vanilla and the flour mixture. Hope this helps you!

Well, I have a bowl of dry ingredients for the crust and no instructions on how to make it a crust. Maybe butter or some other instruction was left out?
