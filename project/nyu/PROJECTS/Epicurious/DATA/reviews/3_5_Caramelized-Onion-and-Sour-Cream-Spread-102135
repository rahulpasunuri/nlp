Eh. Such good ingredients but it was too sweet and no one ate it.

The sugar is indeed used. The recipe reads, "Add onion and next 4 ingredients. &" This means to add onion, red bell pepper, fennel bulb, herbs de Provence, and sugar. It does not say to add onion and the next three ingredients.

I can't believe no one noticed that the sugar is never used!

This dip is faboulous just as written. We served it on kalamata olive bread and couldn't have been more well received by guests.

Quite good! I will use French bread next time.

I'm really not sure what the fuss is about. This is an okay dip (it's really not a spread, too thin for that), but too sweet. Maybe lighter on the fennel, or eliminate it altogether. I agree that maybe some lemon and more garlic would perk it up. I also think that the recipe would be much improved by using cream cheese rather than sour cream...this would make it thicker, and would be a better base for all of the flavors. The blurb at the top of the recipe leads one to believe that what you'll end up with is something zesty (an updated onion dip), but that isn't the case at all. I probably won't be making this again - I prefer the Asian Dip, also on this site, which is fabulous and flavorful, a standby of mine and much faster and easier.

This is a very interesting recipe. The flavors are very complex. My guests really enjoyed this and commented that they had not had a dip this good in at least 10 years. I wasn't sure I liked it at first but like one of the other reviewers - I couldn't stop eating it. I added tabasco as I thought it needed a little more kick. This is also much better completely chilled. I thought it lacked flavor before I put it in the fridge for about an hour. I will make this again.

Wonderful! Definately needed more garlic and lemon.

This was excellent - I made the crisps out of cheese bread and served it already spread on them. I had extra left over in a small bowl and halfway through my party ended up bringing out the rest of the dip so people could just eat it with crackers! Mmmm ...

This is a great spread. I agree it doesn't make much, but it's not all that time consuming (I was busy making my main course and basically left all the ingredients to caramelize in the pan, stirring only very occasionally) and the resulting flavor is worth it. Served with seeded (more fennel!) crackers and plain mini toasts. Delicious.

I loved this dip!! I'm not a big fennel fan, so I wasn't too sure I would like it. But the fennel turned out to be the perfect contrast to the onion and garlic. The only change I will make next time is to not use so much garlic. I used 8 large cloves, which was a little too much. But I will DEFINITELY be making this one again (and again...)!!

Use your imagination and a food processer "folding" in the sour creme at the end and then let mascerate. Found this very quick and easy to prepare and enjoyed by some very discriminating east coast palates.

This is a strange dish. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but I couldn't seem to quit eating it. It's a lot of work for the minimal amount it makes (about a cup).
