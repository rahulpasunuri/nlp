I always add Pinenuts to this stuffing too. It gives it a nice extra bit of flavour, and I get compliments on this stuffing every time! PS I love the Sourdough flavour...and always use try to use fresh cranberries over frozen.

Terrific recipe! Increased onion, celery and carrots to 1 cup, as in previous posts. Used sourdough loaves from Panera Bread (milder than other sourdoughs I've tried). Assembled day before and added a little bit of chicken stock before putting in the oven. Received rave reviews, even from the picky eaters. FYI, pairs well with Spiced Cranberry Sauce with Zinfandel, another Epicurious favorite!

We added a little extra stock to make it more moist, and it was still fairly dry. Absolutely delicious - one of the first things to disappear off the Thanksgiving table.

I almost didn't add this recipe to our regular list of Thanksgiving dressings until I chanced to eat some on the Saturday after the holiday. The key is to make the dressing 2 days in advance of serving. Sitting for 48 hours gives the flavors a chance to meld and mellow and is less of an assault on the palate. I don't like sourdough, so I use a good multigrain.

I've made this recipe many times but agree with Tucson about the sourness. I now substitute chopped dried cranberries for the fresh ones and I add in an extra 1/2 cup of dried apricots as well. I rip the bread (as opposed to dicing it) to give it a bit more of a rustic look. I also upped the vegetables from 3/4 cup to 1 cup.

I think the sourdough made this a bit too tangy. Next time I might try a combination of half sourdough and half a milder bread.

I love cranberries and sourdough bread, but I did not care for this dish. The whole thing just tasted sour/tart, in an unpleasant way. I don't think that it was a bad recipe, but it just didn't work on my palate. I'm glad I tried it prior to making it for my Thanksgiving dinner! I'm planning to try it again with a plain Italian loaf and sweetened dried cranberries to see if that works any better, because I did really like the blend of herbs and veggies.

Came back to EPICURIOUS this year to find this recipe. I made this STUFFING last year for THANKSGIVING and it was modern and delicious!! Sub'd mushrooms for the carrots and chopped the cranberries. It's easy to alter this recipe - adding more liquid/butter for moisture, but i made it as directed and it turned out on the dry side, but still moist - how i like it. I don't like stuffing that's the same texture as mashed potatoes. It's easy to make and works with many kinds of gravy. We had several!

This was delicious and colorful. I was slightly afraid of putting whole cranberries in the prebaked stuffing but they were delicious and not too tart after baking. I doubled the fresh herbs and would do that again too. I would bake this longer or reduce some of the stock though next time, since this came out a bit too moist (I followed the recipe exactly).

i introduced my argentine friends to stuffing with this recipe and they begged for more. when cranberries are out of season or hard to find, i use a mix of apricots and plums. i always add extra veggies too!

Made this stuffing with turkey breast for Christmas dinner. Everyone liked it including the sister who hates everything and my french husband who is a chef and looks down on all things non-european. (so what DO they put in their turkeys?)

I have been using this recipe for four years, with personal variations, to rave reviews. MMMmm!! The cranberries can be a little tart for some so I just leave them out, depending on who's eating.

Really liked this. Added extra celery & onion, plus added some chestnuts. Next time might add walnuts instead (a bit more crunch). Will also try chopping the cranberries a bit.

A very good fresh combination, I'd add more cranberries or other fruits. I'll definitely make this again next year.

This recipe is the best. I've made it three years in a row for Thanksgiving dinner and have always gotten rave reviews from my guests. If I could, I'd have it everday!

This a good base recipe to build on. I made it per recipe. Next time I will add more sage and thyme. I will also add some dried fruits. I like the sourdough flavor.

I served this last year but I made a few revisions: I used dried cranberries (instead of fresh) which I rehydrated in port for a few days, increased the amount of veggies to 1 cup each and also decreased the butter to 1/3 cup. This was a superb stuffing and everyone had seconds. I'll be making it again this year for sure!

Great stuffing recipe and easy to make. I made it on Tuesday but baked it on Thursday for our Thanksgiving dinner and the flavors were great!

YUM! Followed suggestions and reduced stock, but other than that made just a described and it was delicious! Good basic recipe - could make a dozen different ways.

It was ok. Not great. Actually I think it lacked something but I'm not sure what. I'm glad I made another stuffing as an alternative. I won't make this again - it's very boring.

I made this recipe last year and it was *off-the-hook!" My husband and I were practically fighting over who got to eat the left overs. Seriously, this should be your #1 choice for your thanksgiving stuffing, if not a close second.

Another winner! I couldn't find fresh or frozen cranberries at my local market so made the stuffing without them. It was excellent, but I am sure the cranberries would be a good addition. I may also add pecans when I make it again.

This recipe was wonderful! One thing I added was pecans--a delightful surprise!

This was the hit of Christmas dinner; especially among the men. Took earlier suggestion and added almost a cup more stock than called for and it worked just fine. My only other alteration was to add a few more cranberries along with 1/2 cup of cut dried apricots. The juxtoposition of vegtables and fruits was tantilizing!

I made this for my first Thanksgiving dinner along with the Roast Turkey with Pear and Port Gravy. I added some of the Pear Nectar to this recipe and reduced the chicken stock to intensify the flavor...it was fantastic! All of my guests agreed that I MUST make it again next year!

I made a few changes...based upon need. I was out of celery so, I used a can of cream of celery soup instead. I also added a tsp of vanilla extract and a tbsp of honey; as I was stuffing a goose. Thanks

I made this stuffing recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! Excellent recipe. The key is to use very good sourdough bread. Loved it!

I took Rick's advice and went with more chicken broth and it turned out great. I also chopped my cranberries to create more color throughout, plus I personally could not imagine munching into a whole cranberry.

One of the best dressing recipes we've tried. Very simple, and very delicious. The cranberries add a nice visual touch, and are a tart foil to the rest of the meal. We added a sliced leek and made it with vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.

this was my very first time making stuffing, and i'm so glad i looked at this recipe. it's easy and very versatile. i did make quite a few changes, hence i didn't feel qualified to actually rate it. i toasted the bread, used mushrooms instead of carrots, increased the vegetable amounts a 1/4 cup each, added toasted walnuts, added white wine w/ the broth (YUM! at the suggestion of my mom :-) and i confess that i left out the cranberries (i'm not a fan...). the beauty of this recipe is that it's well-written and clear -- a basic method that's very easy to modify to your own tastes. the one thing i might change if making it again, is to reduce the amount of butter by a tbsp or two. i love buttery stuffing, but, it did turn out a bit greasy.

very good if you want something different for your thanksgiving stuffing.

I am not second guessing Charlie Trotter but....start with 4 cups of chicken broth and simmer to reduce it to 2 cups. This adds intensity to an already beautiful holiday comfort food.

This dish got rave reviews from the family at Thanksgiving dinner this year. There wasn't a bit leftover. I'm filing this one away to make again soon!
