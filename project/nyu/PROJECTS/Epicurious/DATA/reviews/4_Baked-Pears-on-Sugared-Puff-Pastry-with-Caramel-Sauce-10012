I didn't think this was anything special. It's a good combination of flavors but nothing that made anyone say "Wow!". The caramel sauce was probably my favorite element; it would be good on ice cream or with other desserts.

This turned out great! I let the pastry rise and used canned pears but it still turned out really tasty. I will make it again for sure!

This was yummy. I too let the pastry rise. Fabu! Had a little trouble getting the pears cooked. Caramel sauce so easy. Fantastic!!!! Easy, fast, will make again for sure.

I loved this! Fairly easy to make and a delicious result. I followed the recipe pretty closely except I also let the pastry puff up rather than covering it with a sheet pan. I might roll it a little thinner next time to make it easier for the fork to get through. My pears took longer to cook than suggested, but they were not as ripe as I would have liked. I served it with vanilla bean ice cream. The caramel sauce was amazing. I didn't have the pear liquor so I used Calvados instead. I will make this again.

I made this for the dessert for our family's Christmas dinner. I let the pastry puff up (as many have recommended). The caramel sauce is the best I've ever had and surprisingly easy to make - I could eat it by the spoonful! I'm making it again tonight to take to dinner at a friend's house. I will add a little whipped cream.

Delicious! I also let the puff pastry puff. Great combo of flavors and not terribly time consuming.

This was amazingly simple, yet a lovely taste and presentation for company. Like others, I set the pears directly on the puff pastry and really enjoyed the flaky border. There wasn't so much pear sauce to speak of, since most of it went into the pastry (or spilled onto the pan), but the caramel sauce still came out fine. Be sure to butter your pan or the foil lining your pan, because I forgot to and my pastries were nearly impossible to pry off the foil.

Even my picky kids liked it. Easy, great tasting and a good use for all my overripe pears. I used more pears than called for and cut them a bit smaller too. Was still great.

This is a great recipe. It is simple and delicious. I made this for a wine tasting at the restaurant I work at. Instead of the puff pastry, I used the ginger-almond wafers recipe that is on this site. It went great with the pears and caramel sauce.

sooo good. left out the poire william but i imagine that would make this great dish a touch better... just used puffed pastry and put the pears right on top and the caramel sauce - well that was the cherry on this dessert - wonderful.

Note to self: Bring saucepan mixture to golden; doesn't need to be darker. Too easy to scorch.

The puff pastry didn't add much to the pear and caramel sauce. Next time I'll just do the pear and sauce, skip the pastry. The sauce was really good.

This was easy and spectacular. Like many other cooks, I just let the puff pastry puff. I have had trouble making caramel sauce in the past using other recipes, but this came out great. This was so good, I made the recipe twice, one for evening for dessert, and then the next day for brunch. I didn't have any Poire William, so I used a bit of dessert wine the first time, and I ommitted the liqueur the second; it's great either way.

To Die For!!! I made this for a party with special friends - and was it ever a hit! I substituted raspberry liquor, and was pleased with the results. The caramel was amazingly delicious. Used the leftover caramel for ice cream. What a way to impress your guests.

I also let the puff pastry puff naturally. I just carefully sat the cooked pear on top. I used a little brandy ice wine to give the dessert an Ontario flare. The thing is, I was making this tonight to practice ... I wanted to make sure I didn't ruin this for a dinner party I will be having. I ate three desserts and threw one away to keep it away from me! The caramel sauce is amazing!!!!!

I did this for a televised cooking class, it was a big hit. Served this to several professional chefs and they just thought that it was a beautiful presentation and wonderful flavors. This inspired for another dessert with apples and crêpes.

I USED THIS RECIPE FOR A COOKING CLASS I WAS TEACHNG AND IT WAS SO EASY AND CREATED SUCH A WOW!! THE CLASS THOUGHT THEY HAD DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN. THE SAUCE IS DIVINE AND IS SO SMOOTH AND TASTY. nO ONE COULD SCREW IT UP.

Wow! Was this delicious. I did not weight down the pastry. I cut back on the butter. In place of heavy cream (didn't have any) I used fat free evaporated milk. And with all my cut-backs it tasted fantastic. Will make it again and again.

WONDERFUL caramel sauce. Put extra out for my dinner guests and everyone poured extra on their fruit. The caramel and pear make a great combo but next time would leave out the puffed pastry. Really didn't add anything to the dish. Next time I will do a phyllo crisp instead of the puffed pastry.

Another hit! I made this for my husband for our anniversary and he loved it! I also did not weigh down the puff pastry. The only addition I made was to add homemade hot fudge sauce and it was great! Will definately make again.

This is a HIT!!! I use half & half instead of the heavy cream, I use peach brandy instead of the pear brandy and I use the puff pastry cups instead of the sheets and I dice the pears instead of leaving them halved. My whole family loves it. I found that if you do not weigh down the pastry it turns out better if you do use the sheets. This is one of those desserts that I get asked for on a regular basis when company comes over.

This was a real hit. However, making the pastry this way leaves it a bit hard to cut with a fork, more like a hockey puck than puff pastry. Next time I think I will not put the pan on top of it while baking, but just let it puff up and be flaky instead. The caramel sauce is out of this world!

I followed the previous reviewers' comments and made pear shapes instead of rectangles. My pastry only took about 12 minutes to cook - any more than that and it would have been way overdone. Also, because of all the sugar, it sets kind of hard when you take the tray out of the oven, so you have to make sure you whip the pastry bases off very quickly before they stick rigidly! As for the thickness, I'd say they come out about quarter of an inch thick, but I wouldn't be inclined to use a pastry case instead - I don't think it would taste as good.

I just have a ? concerning the pastry....if you weight it down, how thick and tender is it when baked? Could you substitute a regular pie crust for the puff pastry?

Prepared these for a small, formal dinner party Christmas eve. They are delicious and make an elegant presentation. As suggested by another reviewer, I cut the puff pastry into a "pear" shape somewhat larger than the fruit itself and also cut out a couple of leaves to attach at the top. Also, I used Amaretto as I had it on hand.

These were a big hit! We substituted the expensive poire William with a sweet fruity dessert wine and it tasted great. Next time we are going to cut the pastry into a more exciting shape than a rectangle.
