Delicious, simple, and a wonderful addition to the menu. My 10yo daughter made this whole recipe herself except slicing the potatoes, and she was so proud! It was beautiful and yummy with our Christmas Day standing rib roast.

This recipe was dry and bland. I baked it covered for the first half of cooking, but there was still not enough liquid to make a creamy gratin. It needs a little butter or chicken stock for flavor. Less thyme would help too.

I could not find creme fraiche so I used 1 cup of sour cream. After reading through the other reviews, I covered the potatoes on the oven for 60 minutes and then left it uncovered in the oven for another 25 minutes. It was cooked perfectly! I would like to try to add gruyere cheese in next time as someone suggested.

I have pasted below the Food Dictionary definition of "gratin" from this very website -- could someone please tell me how this dish qualifies as a "gratin" (no cheese OR bread crumbs in sight) instead of plain old scalloped potatoes? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - gratin; gratinée [GRAH-tn (Fr., gra-TAN), grah- tee-NAY] A gratin is any dish that is topped with cheese or bread crumbs mixed with bits of butter, then heated in the oven or under the broiler until brown and crispy. The terms au gratin or gratinée refer to any dish prepared in such a manner. Special round or oval gratin pans and dishes are ovenproof and shallow, which increases a dish's surface area, thereby insuring a larger crispy portion for each serving. © Copyright Barron's Educational Services, Inc. 1995 based on THE FOOD LOVER'S COMPANION, 2nd edition, by Sharon Tyler Herbst.

This is a classic dish and the proportions seemed accurate to me. I discovered, however, that more time was needed for the potatoes to be cooked through, yet remain firm. Consequently, more liquid was needed as well; I used about one cup of chicken stock. The results were very good. I have made the dish a second time now, but added 6 oz. of lean smoked bacon (diced and the fat rendered in a skillet) and a medium sweet onion (very thinly sliced and cooked until soft in the bacon fat) between the layers and a generous grating of Gruyere cheese on top. It drew rave reviews from guests.

This was easy and delicious. Total cooking time was less than indicated here. We had this on Boxing Day (2008) and EVERYONE loved it.

Consistently delicious; I have made this at least three or four times. Only complaint is that the flavor of the thyme is a bit strong. I'm going to try a new gratin this Christmas.

Let me preface by saying culinary school or not and yes I went, practiced my skills in few fine establishments in Southern California for decades and finally retired. This "Christmas" dinner, this receipt was a disaster and threw the whole thing in the garbage and wouldn't even let the dog have it. The expectation was its rather simple, great! This receipt was not only incorrect in the time (I mean 45 minute to an hour off - you gotta be kidding me), the amounts of ingredients required had to be short (something was amidst there), but the dryness (Death Valley Dry) of the eventual product was absolutely horrible there was no fusion of flavors, there was no acceptable presentation for this, there was nothing. Never again!

I couldn't find creme fraiche, so just used heaving whipping cream. I needed to cook it longer than the recipe indicated (probably about 1 hour 15 minutes total), covered it for the first 45 minutes. It was surprisingly delicious! Definitely a keeper!

I used 2 cups of crème fraîche and covered the potatoes with foil for the first 30 minutes. They were great and will do them again. For the reviewers who mentioned gray potatoes-don't cut them until you are ready to start layering them.

These were a fantastic Christmas Eve dinner side! I ommitted the crème fraîche, and just added more whipping cream, and they still turned out AMAZING!

This was so easy and delicious. I made it with the rest of the menu and it rivaled the roast. Followed the recipe exactly and served it right out of the oven.

The recipe turned out dry potatoes. I think it would be fine with the addition of some butter and milk to the recipe. It also required about 20 more minutes of cooking time for the potatoes to be done and not crunchy. I fixed the leftovers with a little butter and milk and THEY were fantastic, but NOT in the original recipe form.

We all enjoyed this dish at our Christmas Eve dinner. The top did not become too "golden" so we were concerned that is was not done. We kept it in the oven an additional 25 mintues. I must say the potatoes tasted even better at dinner two days later!!

This was very easy to make and good. The family missed the mashed potatoes I usually make so not sure I will make it again for a holiday but definitely for a dinner party. If it seems tasteless, just add a little more salt, pepper and thyme or even some season salt.

Made this dish for Xmas dinner. It was good, but not great. I followed the "do ahead" suggestion and let it sit for 2 hours, then rewarmed. I think it dried out during this time. Would have been better if I timed it to be served right out of the oven.

My family loved this. I dotted the top with about a Tbsp of butter before baking and next time I think I will cover with foil for the first half of the oven time to help the potatoes cook. Delicious.

We thought this dish was tasteless. Definitely will not ever make again!

Next to the roast, this was the best!
