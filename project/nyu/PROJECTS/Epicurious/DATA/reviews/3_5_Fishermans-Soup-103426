Compared to other fishermen stews and bouillabaisses on this site, this is an extremely bland version if prepared as described.

Really good with some homemade shrimp broth. I usually just use frozen white ruffy from Trader Joe's--simple and delicious!

This is a very good recipe. I've made twice now and followed a few of the suggestions posted. I used chicken stock, doubled the garlic and put the whole stem of rosemary in. I've also switched up the seafood as well. Tonight I used cod and shrimp. My husband inhaled it. Easy to make and very impressive. Most certainly a keeper.

I would pay money for this in a restaurant! I doubled the garlic, added a small can of clams,and used different tomatoes. I doubt you need the flour, and next time I will not chop the rosemary, just put the whole stem and leaves in and take it out before eating. It's not hard to make..bon appetite!

This recipe has been a magnificent addition to my repertoire. (I get the Orange Roughy issue, but enough) Personally I have used catfish, scallops, and clams, all of which are more readily available here in TX, more so than orange roughy and sea bass. The results have been wonderful, I shared my first batch with my neighbors, and they were crazy for it. So this is a keeper, and it is easy to make as well.

A cook from Vancouver is correct about orange roughy - and sea bass are under the same threat. An excellent resource for determining what fish are safe and environmentally ethical to eat is www.oceansalive.org.

Fellow seafood lovers -- *please* don't buy or eat orange roughy. These fish are very slow developing, have long lives, low reproductive rates, and their numbers are crashing worldwide due to overfishing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_roughy

We live in the desert, so fish soup is not something that I have eaten/prepared often. Delicious. As with many others, different fish was substituted. We also added 4-5 small dried red chiles to the broth. They added a good zip.

This dish was very quick and easy make. I have never made a seafood soup and consider myself a beginner in the kitchen. I only made a few minor changes to the recipe: 1 -- Substitute 6 cups of water for: 4 cups chicken broth 1 cup tomato juice(from the can that the plum tomatos came from) 1 cup water Next, I added a little safron 2 - 3 threads. It turned out great. Make sure to get a loaf of crusty bread to dip in the soup.

Best fish soup I'v ever made! Never add water, to any dish. I did 3 cuos clam juice, 3 cups chicken stoch and it was perfect.

This is a great stew/soup for a warming up to Spring day. I used a frozen shell fish mix, added tabassco, and used Fumet de Poisson ( fish broth ) that I picked up in France.

Fantastic stew. I have made it twice and everyone loves it. Instead of water used 2 cups clam juice, 2 cups veggie broth and 2 cups water. I use 5 fishes/shellfish. Mussels make an excellent addition. I have also used scallops. Put a good toasted piece of Italian bread in bottom of bowl and ladle stew over bread

I substituted chicken broth for the water. I used shrimp, scallops & sea bass for the fish. I thought it was kind of bland. The broth needed something. I didn't have the depth of flavor I was hoping for.

Very good and hearty - I substituted vegetable broth for water, and that was just right - I think it would have been a little bland otherwise.

This soup was wonderful. I substituted chicken broth for water, and pepper flakes for crushed red pepper. I will make this again and again.

Yum! This soup is wonderful! I did take my fellow cooks suggestions and added the zest of one lemon, and a pinch of saffron.

I'm a professional chef and I used this dish as a pasta dish in my supper club. It gets great reviews and lets me have an outlet for the small amounts of fresh fish that I have left over at the end of the week. I just add some kind of fancy pasta.

The key to this recipe is to make sure all of the liquid from the wine has completely evaporated before adding the water. Use a very heavy, anodized pot, start simmering on low, and forget about it. Well, not completely, come back every 10 minutes to stir. Patience is the key. I guarantee you'll make it again and again patience prevails. My husband likes fresh country bread in the bottom of the bowl with the soup poured on top. Yum!

As a seafood stew fan, I felt this was a winner because it was a different twist from the standard saffron-citrus zest-fennel-tomato seafood concept. I used a can of chopped tomatoes added after the reduction period and about 3 1/2 c. water total, with extra wine. I'd add less red pepper next time--it kind of overwhemed the other flavors. I used monkfish and cod (they were available) along with the shrimp & squid. Next time, I'll add the squid at the last minute instead of with the other fish--the other seafood took longer than indicated to cook through. Would definitely make again-- a great winter dish served with an Italian red!

Seems a shame to try and outdo San Francisco Cioppino with anything less. That rich fisherman's stew is so much better than this small and thin stepchild. However a nice homemade Foccacia drizzled with Livorna olive oil is a nice addition

I also had to make some adjustments. I used catfish, shrimp & scallops, some clam sauce and some anchovies. I used 2 14 1/2 oz cans of diced tomatoes with garlic & basil added. It was very good. The celery and rosemary added added a different flavor to similar dishes. My wife takes it to work for lunch so that's the bottem line.

To be fair, I couldn't resist including my favorite "tweaks" for fish soup: fresh diced fennel in with the onions, a bit of minced anchovy, a tiny bit of lemon zest, and a pinch of saffron. I also had to stray on the fresh seafood; I used rock shrimp, mussels, scallops and snapper. Finally, I used some chicken stock and clam juice in place of some of the water. Granted, you could argue that I changed the whole darn soup, but my dinner guests positively swooned and are still waxing sentimental about it a month later. It was really quite spectacular.
