i like this with a grilled (or seared) tuna steak salad, although after making it a few times, we've cut the amount of oil by half.

When I lived in Sacramento one of my favorites was La Bou; they have an AWESOME Asian Chicken Salad with a soy-sesame vinaigrette. No longer living in CA, I wanted to find a recipe to match theirs. This recipe is so-so. It's kind of bland and doesn't really have the zing of La Bou's dressing. The only thing I did different was Seasoned Rice Vinegar. Others have commented with ideas to make it better so I'll try some of those. Otherwise, it's a good start.

I liked this recipe and would make it again. But there seems to be a small error in the recipe: the prep part of the recipe calls for "salt to taste" while the ingredients list doesn't include salt. If you take out all your ingredients before you cook and just go, you may not see that. The recipe *definitely* benefitted from the salt--it took it from kind of bland to really tasty.

I've made this dressing a few times now, each time trying to find the special ingredient it seems to be missing. Its not bad tasting. Just a little boring. Still haven't found the zing...

As written, this recipe rates an uninteresting score of 1, but with thje following additions I plan to use it often and would upgarde to a 3-1/2: add two teaspoons honey, about a teaspoon of minced fresh ginger, and a slivered scallion. Much more interesting this way - great as a dr4essing on green salad accompanying an Asian meal. We served this with our favorite Thai basil grilled chicken off this website.

This was simple to make. I used it as the dressing on the salad that I served with an Asian red-curry chicken and it made a nice choice.

Outstanding! I have also tried substituting honey instead of sugar (to taste).
