My sister (octobervic) turned me on this receipe and it's so wonderful. Our father use to make this when we were kids, so we have been looking for the recipe for awhile. It's so flavorful and my entire family loves it...especially my husband. Always use a non-stick pot to make it in...never a crockpot.

These are absolutely delicious. You can make them with or without the beans. Either way, the dish is flavorful and the meat practically falls off of the bone. My family often serves this dish at Christmas with Saffron rice.

I cooked this in my crock pot and made the recipe exactly as shown. Found it to be way too sweet with all the brown sugar. I was really embarassed that NO-ONE liked it at all and were feeling embarassed themselves about not wanting it after trying just a taste of it. (We had a pot-luck) The whole pot was left and neither my husband nor myself could it eat either.

I have been looking for this recipe since 1992 when the issue of this magazine "mysteriously" disappeared along with my erstwhile husband who loved this dish. It's a little time-consuming if you want to eliminate much of the fat, but well worth it. I made this instead of chili for a Super Bowl party and it was a big hit, my grown children, now in Dallas prefer it to a bowl of red anyday.
