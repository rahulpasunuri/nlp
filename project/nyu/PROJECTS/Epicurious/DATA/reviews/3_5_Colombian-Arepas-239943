This was my first attempt to make arepas, and it was a success. As per another reviewer's suggestion, I used queso blanco--yum! The arepas were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. I topped them with salsa. The next day I reheated the leftovers and buttered them for a delicious snack. Will definitely make them again and again.

I just noticed I miss two items from my comment above...For the sweet "mandocas" I meant 1/2 inch to an inch thick stick and about 5 inches long... And before you put arepas in the oven you must grill on a flat grill, like pancake grill brush with a little oil for about 4-5 minutes each side then put in the oven.

One thing about arepas that was never mentioned... In order to have the best arepas in the world you must knead the dough and as you knead it wet your hands and add a little water to make it a pliable dough, then form arepas... You don't want it to be sticky... They are great fried, but my favorite is baked at 400' in the bottom rack and watch them balloon... Also another fun and delicious way to use this dough is to add molasses, brown sugar, ripe plantain grated and feta cheese(ideally "queso blanco" grated) then form a half inch to an inch stick and tie and ends then fry, delicious! with white cheese or any kind of cheese you have in hand... And Arepas have origins from Indians in Venezuela and Colombia, so no fighting about that!

I finally made these yesterday and they turned out amazing. The first batch I made. I ate them with strawberry jam. The second batch I stuffed with chicken and a mustard sauce I made. It was so good!

I am Colombian and very surprised to hear from a Venezuelan person that arepas are from Venezuela, wrong, they are from COLOMBIA too, we eat them in a different way but we used to eat arepas before going to school in the morning with eggs and coffee, Colombians still eat that way. The recipe is correct but I don't think you need to put any oil in the dough. Colombians arepas are the best. Venezuelans are good too.

I've made arepas a number of times starting from this recipe using a few different kinds of cheese including mozzerella, cheddar and queso fresco. I often substitute milk for part of the water and typically fry the arepas. For filling pulled pork is traditional and I've also done pulled chicken or chorizo, onions and hot peppers or black beans with cilantro and chipotle. The recipe has a great deal of give to it and is easily customizable. Arepa flour is often labelled 'masarepa' and goya among others makes it and sells it in supermarkets.

My first try at arepas and they were easier than I thought they'd be. I didn't have ricotta salata or mozz around so I grated some feta into it and it worked really well. I served it with a sweet potato, black bean and salsa mix and a bit of sour cream and squeeze of lime. They were delish. I will absolutely make them again. I love the crispy texture that they add to the mix.

Actually historically the arepa can me tranced back to native Indians in La Grab Colombia prediminately in the areas of the Andes that are in Colombia. The arepas can be made and eaten many different ways, not just stuffed. Traditionally it was made to accompany the meal. I love it and have eaten it since I was born. You don't need oil just water, the masa de arepa or arepa flour. Go to any local grocery store and in the Latino isle look for the Goya Masa de Arepa. It's yellow bag and it has made in Colombia on the back. Just follow the instructions and enjoy!

Use Arepa Flour, Corn meal doesn't work. You need beef, chicken, cheese or any other ingredient to stuff the arepas. And.... Arepas are originally Venezuelan.. Thanks

To the reviewer that rated the recipe with one fork...... The mistake was to use corn meal (DO NEVER USE CORN MEAL) It is not the same as arepa flour. Arepa flour can be purchased at many supermarkets now a days, but if you don't find it there try small latin stores.

You are not supposed eat arepas plain, that is why they don't have a whole lot of flavor. The way we make them back home is to just mix the corn flour with salt and water. Then form them into discs and fry just like this recipe. Then when they are golden brown, let the oil drain for a bit, then cut the arepa almost in half and spoon out some of the uncooked dough in the middle. Then you can stuff it with anything. (cheese, pork, beef, and/or shrimp are most popular) The arepa is pretty much the bread that you use to make a sandwich. So stuff it with anything that sounds good to you. It will be good no matter what you put in it.

You can also try instead of frying, kind of roasted in middle heat using a goo skillet, do not forced to flip until cook on one side, once both sides are cook, not burn, you can fill them with almost anything, I like mozzarella cheese and jam,,I put the cheese first, back on the heat,,to let it melt,,anything goes,,Go easy on the salt, some of the stuff you might use for filling might be salty....Good apetite

Very simple and delicious. I used an electric arepa maker that I just purchased. Suprisingly, it was worth the purchase. To the reviewer that didn't follow the recipe and rated it with one fork, give the recipe another try with the correct ingredients and you will surely have better luck. One fork and didn't follow the recipe doesn't make sense

I was going to give them three forks, but then I saw that one reviewer totally ignored the directions and gave the results one fork, as if that was somehow the recipe's fault. So the fourth fork is to offset the other review.

Very easy and delicious. I used cojita cheese as that was what was available at my market and it looked quite similar to crumbled ricotta salata. I sprinkled them with a little salt once they came out of the pan. Also pretty good reheated the next day in the toaster oven. Plan to make for a party.

I used regular cornmeal and the mozzarella option and they turned out terrible. They wouldn't stick together so I added egg. Bad idea!Basically they became flat, flavorless, fried corn muffins. I couldn't taste the cheese at all. Will try authentic arepa flour and the ricotta option....maybe it will be better.

I thought this was a very nice recipe, very easy. although it could use a little more flavor, i was very content with how it turned out

Delicious and oh so easy! I have made this four times now. With a nice green salad on the side, it's a nice supper. On its own, it makes a great party dish.
