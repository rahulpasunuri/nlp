Used small shrimp, cooked, due to allergies. After browning, finished in oven. Served for four adults and two kids (adjusting accordingly) ... one picky and one adventurous. All loved! Time consuming, but really worth it. Will definitely make again for a "special" dinner.

Took the advice of other reviewers and added cayenne, lemon juice/zest, and red pepper; pan friend then finshed in the oven. I added some white cheddar to the stuffing as well. Toped it with a white wine and muchroom pan sauce. It went over well. I'lll be making this one again!

Good dish - crab mixture very subtle even with added cayenne. We served with cream-white wine reduction, which greatly improved dish. Also baked after pan-frying.

Super impressive. Even won rave reviews from my Mom, an excellent cook. Made it for discerning guests, and they raved. I secured the chickens with toothpicks so nothing could escape. Used canned crabmeat. Will become a regular at our house.

good recipe, but def. pound your chicken - that way it's not only easier to fry, you also get more stuffing in every bite. crab stuffing was yummy!

Pound your chicken breasts flat so that it is easier to stuff and pan fry!!!!!!!!!!!

This is actually my sister's recipe that she sent into Bon Appitit several years ago, and they have modified it. It is now my signature dish and absolutely fabulous. The original recipe called for 6oz cream chese and 1/4 teaspoon of dill weed, garlic salt and lemon pepper. She felt that Louis Kemp imitation crab had the most flavor, and it calls for 8oz of imitation crab meat because it adds more flavor than the real thing, believe it or not. When you pan fry it, you must pan fry on all sides, and I use italian style bread crumbs. It is wonderful and full of flavor, and so impressive, even if you are not professional!

I have to disagree w/ the last reviewer--I thought this recipe was simple to make--what a way for an amature to impress people. It is a solid recipe to have in the repitore, not amazing, but a really nice change.

fantastic, but fairly difficult for someone who is an amature.

My husband and I truely enjoyed this recipe. Again, as with the others, I used what I had in the house. I used some finely chopped red pepper,lemon juice and Old Bay seasoning as well as Italian bread crumbs. I also finished in a 350 oven for 10 min. Because of the creamyness of the cream cheese filling I used some left over tomato coulis as a sauce to eat it with. This was a tasty dish. Can't wait to make it again!

Talk about recipes that look good on paper! When I make a recipe for the first time, I try to give it a chance as presented. This was a bland, flavorless dead-end. The suggestions involving adding spice for flavor are on target. As is, it's a bummer.

Love this recipe; especially with the simple canges others suggested here. I finished it off by de glazing the pan with sherry, added butter and sauted mushrooms, than added cream and reduced. My company now asks for this dish every time i invite them over.

I modified this recipe a bit to accomodate what I had in my kitchen. Used bay shrimp instead of crab, fresh tarragon and thyme. Added red bell pepper as other suggested along with tabasco, which gave it a kick. Omitted other spices. Also added about 1 tsp. of fresh lemon juice, fresh cracked pepper and a little salt. Finished in the oven. Very good recipe, easy and fast. Anxious to try it with crab. A keeper!

I'm so glad I read these reviews before making this dish! I followed some of the advice given which no doubt added a lot to the recipe. I also used Boursin instead of cream cheese, and some cayenne to spice it up a little. I didn't have a problem with the filling seeping out, but I didn't overstuff them too much. I like the idea of finishing the chicken off in the oven as it was difficult to get it cooked through without making the crumbs too brown. I gave this dish "three forks" but with some additions and changes to the recipe as it seems the other reviewers did too. I think this needs some kind of a sauce, but I'm not sure what. Does anyone have a suggestion that I could try next time? Some sort of pan sauce maybe? I chose this recipe in order to finish up some crab I had left over from making deviled crab cakes for a dinner party (Williams-Sonoma recipe, absolutely fabulous!) That's why I love this website so much. Just type in some key words and presto, you have a list of recipes at your disposal!

This dish was fabulous! I followed other's advice and spiced it up with a dash of cayenne pepper (instead of Tabasco). I used fresh, crustless sourdough bread and served the remaining slices on the side. I also had to finish it up in the oven, at 350 for about 7 minutes. But, the chicken breasts were huge (my husband and I shared one, it was so big!) I had no problem running out of the butter/olive oil mixture, as one previous review stated. I put the chicken in a hot pan, so maybe that made difference. My husband said it was better than most food at 5 star restaurants! I will make this again, especially with fresh crab (we caught the crab the day before in the Puget Sound, can't get any fresher than that!)

I love crab, but I did not like this one. I followed the recipe and expected great results, but everyone was scraping the filling out, including me. It was not dull, and it was not the way it was cooked, it was like a crab salad tucked in a fried chicken breast, it just did not work. I even made a sauce out of roasted red bell peppers, spices and whole cream, which I thought might be unpopular, on the contrary, everyone dipped the fried chicken into that while pushing the filling to the side. I rarely find a recipe that I really dislike, but here it is.

This was great but I tweaked it a bit! Used panko instead of breadcrumbs, added Tabasco, deleted the lemon-pepper and used fresh lemon and ground pepper,Boursin instead of cream cheese, cut back on the dill and added finely chopped red peppers.

The dish has potential, but, as it is printed, I thought it was a little bland. I should have added a few drops of Tabasco, as one reviewer did. I must disagree with the reviewer who said the breadcrumbs didn't add to the dish. I used some Orlando Ciabatta (threw it in the Cuisinart) as fresh breadcrumbs, and, while they needed a pinch of kosher salt, I thought the texture was lovely. I used a toothpick to close the pocket in the chicken breast, as I was worried that the crab/cream cheese mixture would melt out. I used cholesterol free egg substitute and low-fat Philly Cream Cheese. I browned the breasts on top of the stove in butter/peanut oil (it has a higher smoking point than vegetable oil, so it didn't burn at all), and finished it with 15 minutes in a 425 degree oven. As my S/O can't have a lot of salt, I thought this would be a good dish. Perhaps more lemon, or, again, some of that Tabasco would add some spark? I served it with a nutted pilaf and some carrots, cut into spears (by the way, have you used a "real" carrot lately? they are much more flavorful than those little baby carrots!) and cooked in water. Very pretty presentation.

My family thought this dish was great. I however would omit the breadcrumbs, I don't think they added to the flavor.

I made this last night for my husband and I's 14th wedding anniversary dinner, and they were fabulous!!! I am now trying to convince my husband that this is what I should serve for the 18 people that are coming over for Christmas Eve dinner. Very rich and satisfying--even my 3 kids, ages 7-11 ate them!! I can't wait to try them again!!

This recipe was GREAT! I made it last night. I was hesitant with the mixed reviews that I read. I cooked the chicken in a heavy pan for approx. 10 min. per side and finished it off in a 425 degree oven. This recipe would be great for company! Will make again!

We really liked this dish. It is quite rich, though. I followed others advice and browned the chicken and then finished the cooking off in the oven. I also pounded the chicken out so they were a bit thinner, and in equal width for even cooking. This chicken has been added to my permanent recipe collection.

I've made this twice, using a cast iron pan both times. First time when I turned the breasts over they had already burned, and the butter disappeared while cooking the second side. Undaunted I prepared this dish once more but cooked at a lower setting. Again the breading burned, but not as bad. I added more butter for the second side, then put the pan in the oven at 425' to finish off. Worked great, even got good revies from the restaurant owner to who I served it. In future I would merely brown both sides then transfer to the oven.

I was a little leary of the chicken/crab combination, but it's really quite delicious ... and rich! I used crustless sourdough bread to make the breadcrumbs, and I added a few dashes of Tabasco to the crab mixture, which added a nice but subtle kick. I didn't have any problems cooking the stuffed chicken breasts in a skillet, but I did lower the heat just a tad. As it turned out, it only needed about 8 minutes per side in the skillet. The chicken breasts I used were quite large, and the crab mixture would not have filled four (I only made two), so I would double the crab mixture if I make this with four chicken breast halves. I also made the crab mixture the night before and let it chill covered in the refrigerator. I wasn't sure if the "minced onion" was supposed to be freshly minced onion or minced onion à la spice aisle (dried). I used the dried version, which worked well. Before dinner was over, my partner was already encouraging me to make this dish again. I will!!!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I made a few changes, instead of cooking on a skillet I broiled them in the oven at 350 for a 1/2 hour. I served it with a Wild Rice Pilaf and glazed baby carrots and a white wine sauce...delicious!!!!

Well, the taste testers were not jumping for joy with this one. One didn't think that crab and chicken went together even though he liked the stuffing mixture. I doubled the crab without increasing any of the other ingredients and this worked out fine. Tip for those 'less experienced' cooks, DO NOT use olive oil versus vegetable oil (I was trying to cut back on the fat), it burns and the breading browns too quickly to cook the inside of the chicken. I had to put it in the oven at 375 deg. for about 15-20 minutes extra.

Like the previous reviewer, this is one of my husband's faves too! I've also been making it since '92 and have been known to spend hours leafing through my back copies of Bon Appetit until I could find it. I've made it for dinner parties with a nutted wild rice pilaf and fresh asparagas with lemon butter. Big hit!

I actually have been making this recipe since I got it out of Bon Apetit in '92. It is my husband's all time favorite. I have made a light wine sauce with mushrooms and poured that over the chicken and served it with a simple pilaf and asparagus. I usually add more crab and season bothe the crab/cream cheese mixture and the crumbs with plenty of salt and pepper. Also good with a little Greek seasoning to jazz up the filling.

There's a similar recipe for baked crab stuffed chicken which is MUCH better
