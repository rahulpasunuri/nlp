Made a version of this with what I had on hand: left-over roasted chicken, toasted almonds, chopped apricots simmered in well-seasoned chicken broth, rosemary, lemon zest, topped with scallions, omitted oil entirely. I can't say how the recipe is as written, but it certainly makes a great starting point for a light, delicious and unique summer dinner idea. I look forward to trying it with the chorizo.

I found it to be quite oily/greasy, next time i think i will just use a drizzle of EVOO, and more broth. Or mabey I just had to reduce it down more? Would make it again with a few changes.

Couldn't find chorizo readily available, so I used a spicy Italian sausage instead, also added some peperoncino flakes and a tablespoon of hot dijon mustard. Unique pasta without much work; nice mix of sweet and hot.

Made this for my wife last night, sans the chicken broth (which I had run out of, and hate to use the artificial stuff). A subtle mix of flavors for a light pasta, and good with light italian roasted garlic bread. I would double the amount of chorizo and fresh rosemary, as I like to really taste my fresh herbs...
