Yes, I would make this dish again. It was very good, but I will not make it often. Grating those potatoes is a pain.

I used a derivative of this recipe for a party last week. I grated raw russets into a clean tea towel then twisted the ends very tight, squeezing out all the liquid. I combined the potatoes with only salt, pepper and chives. I then fried/sauted the pancakes in a non-stick skillet using only butter for a few minutes on each side. Drained them on paper towels, then placed on a non-stick cookie sheet and froze them for 2 days, as I wanted to make them ahead of time. On the evening of the party, I took them out of the freezer to defrost for an hour, then warmed/crisped them up in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes. Used as a base for slices of beef tenderloin with a mushroom cream sauce. Worked out perfectly. Remember to make them pretty thin, especially at the edges so that they stay nice and crisp.
