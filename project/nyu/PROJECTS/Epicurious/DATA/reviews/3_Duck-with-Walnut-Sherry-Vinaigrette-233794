Other reviews are right...15 min @ 375 is perfect then 2 min. under Broiler. Added pecans instead of walnuts, and 1 more tsp of sugar with balsamic vinegar. My foodie husband has requested this dish again!

Served the Duck over a salad using the sherry vinaigrette dressing and it was fabulous. But agree that roasting time is too long for medium rare. Would check after 15 minutes and only roast to no more than 125 degrees.

I made just the sauce from this recipe, as I had a whole duck and just roasted it. The sauce was amazing.

Tasted great and less mess than frying the duck breasts on the stove (which is what I usually do). You definitely don't want to overcook the breasts so check them early to see how they're doing. I served them with polenta.

I made this with a whole (5 lb) duck cooked in a deep fat fryer (20 min at 400). The duck was perfect and the sauce was tremendous. I used some of the duck fat I cut off the bird before frying to make the sauce. I used pecans instead of walnuts and a combination of white wine and white balsamic vinegars instead of sherry vinegar. All of these substitutions were out of necessity and they all worked. I will most certainly make this again.

This SHOULD be a delicious dish. I made it exactly as it was written (I thing I seldom do) and served it over wilted field greens. The first problem is that the recommended oven time is too long - I put the breasts into a pre-heated oven and checked them at 20 minutes. By then they were past med-rare. At more than $10 per breast, this was devastating. The vinaigrette is too acidic - I should have used more sugar. Duck really goes well with a sweeter sauce - the vinegar flavor wasn't a good complement to the duck meat. If I was to "fix" this recipe, I would put the breasts in for 15 minutes and broil them a bit longer. As for the sauce, I would use balsamic, and substitute a jelly (currant) for the sugar to get a sweeter, smoother juice. The walnut oil, which is hideously expensive, was completely lost (flavor-wise) in this recipe. And the walnuts themselves were just OK. Frankly I think they are really too rich with duck and this was a case of gilding the lily. This best part about this dish was that it gave me the idea to do duck breats in the oven - I've been cooking them on top of the stove where they make a hideous fat-splattering mess every time.

I loved this recipe - my husband said leave out the walnuts but I don't agree. The duck cost a fortunate but it's perfect for a special occasion.

Easy and excellent. Made with pinion nuts and balsamic vinegar.
