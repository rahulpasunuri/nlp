absolutely delicious!!

Wow! This recipe is amazing. I made the marinade exactly by the recipe and used it on chicken thighs and drumsticks which I marinated for only about 5 hours due to time constraints. My husband grilled on the BBQ and basted with the remaining boiled marinade towards the end of the cooking time. Everybody loved and I will definitely be keeping this recipe.

I wanted to use up some leftover flanken-cut short ribs so I used those instead of pork (omitting the steaming step, of course). They were very tasty, but I think with pork (or as a grilled chicken marinade like some did) it would be just amazing. I would make this again, but I wouldn't use red meat. I'd use pork ribs as the recipe intends.

Made this recipe with spare ribs instead of baby back but that didn't seem to matter. The coconut marinade/sauce was delicious. Everyone enjoyed the ribs.

I LOVE this recipe. Have made them for a number of parties and they are always all gone by the time everyone leaves. The steaming is messy and a pain with the baby back ribs. Next time I may try country style ribs and preboiling or steaming on the grill. That said, these are well worth the effort!

I'm adding a new review because these are so great. This time I didn't make ribs. I used boneless (but WITH skin) chicken breasts. Don't precook, just marinate overnight and grill. FAB!

I am basing my rating on the memory of a meal eaten over a decade ago (recipe is from 1995), but WOW! This is awesome. The marinade is just so good. My husband gnawed and gnawed on the bones and we both wish I had made more. I finally dug this recipe up as I went through old issues of Bon Appetit this week. I am heading to the store tomorrow for ingredients. I hope my memory serves me well.

I cooked in a foil pouch with a few cloves of garlic and 3/4 of a can of light beer at 250 for 2.5 hours before marinating for 24 hours. It was oh so good and pretty fool proof! Even my boyfriend told me I better leave him some left overs :)

These are excellent! Worth tracking down the lemongrass for them.

The flavours of these ribs took me to the islands. Originally from the island of Sri Lanka where lots of dishes are cooked with coconut, I had to try these. Delicious! I like my food spicy so I added 3 serrano peppers to the marinade. Next day left-overs heated in the microwave work well too. Will definitely be making this again.

Fantastic ribs! I double the garlic, ginger and add 50% more lemongrass to make a stronger marinade - but that's the way we like them. I often serve these at large summer gatherings and parties and am always asked for the recipe!

I have made these several times, and they are simply delicious. Made them for a dinner party along with pineapple fried rice, and they were a great hit. I used boneless country style, roasted them instead of steaming, then marinated and broiled as directed, and got great results. I have also baked at 400 to finish instead of broiling and they are equally as good. The sweet/spicy contrast is excellent. Will definately try grilling next summer! Served the sauce after simmering and thought I should have pureed more for a smoother sauce, but my husband liked the texture.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe and I find I can modify it slightly and they are always delicious. I use country style boneless ribs which I boil ahead of time and I do marinate them (sometimes for only 20 minutes) but I then bake them in the oven at 400F with the marinade for 30-45 minutes. The sauce left over is fantastic and the ribs are melt in your mouth.

Another way around messy steaming: I steamed my ribs on the grill. If you have a gas grill, put an aluminum pan of water on the grates and the ribs on the pull-down rack above. For charcoal, just lay them on aluminum foil beside the pan. This was MUCH easier to clean up!

Wonderful change from typical BBQ ribs. A winner with every guest that has tried: sweet, rich and savoury. Highly recommended.

Rating: 3
I'd give it a 3.5 if that was possible. The marinade is a wonderful combination of flavors. The only thing I did was add some lime juice at the very end because I thought it was just a tad sweet (husband doesn't like sweety foods). Lime was the perfect touch. Easy to make. This marinade would be good on chicken, pork, fish, any number of food items. I served with jasmine rice and put some of cooked marinade over my rice - delicious!

We followed this recipe to the letter - and are big fans of both Honolulu and Thai food - but this one didn't turn us on. Gloppy marinade and not really the best combination of flavors.

Does anyone know, is this a kid-friendly recipe?

Have made these ribs often for large parties and they are always a hit! Tip for marinating is to use heavy gallon zip lock bags - put ribs in and pour marinade over them. We are also former Honolulu residents and big fans of Keo's for many years!

As was said, it looks terrible while it is marinating. It will not look apetizing, but look beyond it- it is GOOD. Very rich, so pair it with something very light and simple. I used plain brown basmati rice. Be careful not to overcook.

Rating: 4
As an update to my review below... I have marinated chicken skewers in this, and they also turned out divine. However, the shrimp did not work with this sauce at all. They did not absorb the flavor, even marinating for 24 hours. Came out very bland. I will stick to meat with this recipe in the future, find something else for seafood. I have been recommending this recipe to everyone, and everyone who has tried it has raved.

Rating: 4
For something different than the usual BBQ sauce style ribs give this recipe a try. To be honest the marinade doesn't really look that apetizing (green in color) however the taste of these ribs is out of this world. Give it a try.

Wow! I was suspicious of the "best ribs I've ever had" comments, but after trying the recipe - I agree! I substituted basil for the coriander and it was perfect. Otherwise followed the recipe as is. The ribs were extremely tender and the souce extremely tasty. I will try the marinade with pork chops and chicken as well, as others suggested.

Oh, YUM! Just, YUM! These are so fabulous!! I only made 2 substitutions. Instead of the brown sugar, I used splenda and 1/2 t molasses, and instead of baby back, I used country style. I marinated the ribs raw for 24 hours, and baked them in the oven for 50, broiled for 10. My husband licked the plate, and we both believe these to be the absolute best ribs either of us has ever had. This is most definitely a keeper! I'm telling everyone about this recipe. Absolutely loved it.

For something different than your regular BBQ sauce give this recipe a try. I was skeptical all the up until the ribs hit my mouth and I can honestly say these might be the best ribs I'v ever had.

These ribs are very yummy and easy to make, they are a refreshing change from the usual BBQ ribs.

This was a very nice change from your regular BBQ ribs. I received lots of compliments on this dish. It was a little time consuming having to make double the recipe, steaming, and processing the marinade but everyone seemed to enjoy it in the end, so that's truly all that matters!

This was a hit. I love that most of the work is done ahead. Since I am the only cook in the family, and would like to enjoy my own parties, I would like to know what others think of precooking, and freezing in the marinade? Ya think?

Rating: 3
this was a great recipe, lots of compliments. I had also wrapped my ribs in foil and baked them for 2 hrs at 250, marinated overnight and grilled the next day. the hint of spicy and sweet of coconut was a fun change up from bbq sauce and i'll be making this one again.

This marinade was delicious with boneless porkchops. I let them sit in the sauce for about 6 hours and then broiled them. They tasted great served with steamed rice and Spicy Thai Peanut Slaw. I added red pepper flakes to the marinade and also simmered it down to make a nice sauce for the rice.

WOW! We loved these ribs, and moved them right onto our list of entertainment recipes. Added three chopped serranos, and increased the ginger to three tablespoons. The flavors are so well balanced! Served with rice made with half pineapple juice, then mixed in pinapple tidbits.

These ribs were fabulous! I added two jalapenos as well and we both loved the flavor and the extra kick!

Just made this for a South Pacific party and it was a big hit. I baked the ribs with a rub of salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder, wrapped each rack tightly in foil and baked slow, 225 degrees for about 2 hours. Then cut the ribs apart and marinated. To the marinade I added 2 serrano peppers and 2 jalapeno peppers (with seeds), gave it just a little kick. Next time I will add a little fish sauce to the marinade to give it a little more depth. But, generally a very good recipe that it great PARTY food.

The dish turned out fabulously! My guests loved them. Instead of steaming the ribs, I took the advice of my butcher and baked them (a doubled recipe- 3 big racks cut in half) in two bottles of Red Stripe for 3 hours uncovered in a 250 degree oven, then cut them up and marinated them overnight. I also added 2 jalapenos, but will use 3 or 4 next time. A testament to this dish is that I will make it for my in-laws, who are great cooks and rib experts. Served the ribs with coconut jasmine rice and sauteed green beans, carrots, and red peppers.

Without a doubt the best ribs I have ever had. I forwarded this recipe to four friends, all of whom said the same thing after they made them. I added two jalapenos for spice.

I just made these for a party along with my standard szechwan ribs. I added one serrano pepper, which barely gave it any fire. Next time, I will add two...as we like the sweet/spicy combo. Really a nice recipe though.

This is my favorite rib recipe - I made it several times last summer and I'm making it for a party this weekend. Highly recommend it if you want something a little different than BBQ sauce on your ribs.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!!

This is a winning recipe. We entered a rib cook-off after testing and tweeking it a bit and won first place! The tricks are to blend the marinade ingredents a lot, remove all the chunkies from the meat before grilling and use a china cap or cheesecloth to seperate the sauce after reheating. With these extra efforts you can't go wrong.

I need only one word to describe this dish... "disappointing." No... "yuck." No... "weird." (Okay, three words.) The only reason I gave this dish one fork is because it didn't end up in the trash. Yes, we ate them, but I just kept thinking, "What very strange flavors." ("strange"... that's another word) I will not make this recipe again, but I will substitute shrimp for the ribs. Now THAT will be a great dish -- and not a great waste of money!

These ribs had a great taste but I found myself wanting some zing. Next time I will mince some hot peppers or add a tsp of garlic-chile oil. Lime would also help.

Rating: 4
I cannot believe how unbelievably delicious this was! I didn't follow the proportions exactly, using the entire can of coconut milk and increasing only some of the other ingredients' accordingly -- ;eaving me with a satisfying finish, but the conclusion that for a regular recipe, those that don't love cilantro should scale back to maybe 1/3 of a cup (but don't eliminate it). You couldn't even taste the coconut after it was grilled, but that's okay -- the medley of wonderful flavors was superb.

I made these for my Memorial Day BBQ... AMAZING!! Not one rib left, and many recipe requests. I added a few cloves of garlic to the water when I steamed the ribs... I think it added to the meat's flavor. Also, my store was out of lemongrass, so I too used lemon peel. I didn't serve the excess marinade as I left the ribs in the marinade right until grilling. By steaming first you don't have to cook the ribs long, just long enough to sizzle and brown. With a sweet marinade the sugars usually burn, not with this one. A real winner if you want something different from the usual Q.

This was so easy...The asian markets sell lemon grass already chopped, so I was not sure how much to use. Love ginger, but my husband thought it was a bit much...Over all very different and delicious

The flavour of the coconut marinade was not robust enough for the ribs or it was just not a good mix in my opinion.

I loved these ribs! We eat ribs often andnthis is one of the best recipes! My husband the rib cook in our household but we get tired of the same old recipes. This was great! I used lemon peel instead of lemongrass. I marinated the ribs raw and used my Weber to indirectly BBQ them for 1 and 1/2 hrs. I should have basted the ribs in the last fifteen minutes. It would have been better. I will definitely try this again. I saved some of the marinade for other meats.

We had a "Hawaiian Luau" potluck at work to celebrate the February birthdays, and this was a tremendous hit! Instead of steaming the ribs, I parboiled the ribs in beer, then marinated the ribs for 2 days. I also did not have any shallots, so I didn't include them, and added extra garlic and ginger instead. I also didn't have any lemongrass and used lemon peel from 2 lemons (I doubled the recipe). Since I don't have a food processor, I also used a blender, which also worked just fine, and after boiling the marinade, strained it. Lots of good suggestions from previous reviewers! This was most excellent!

I loved this receipe !!! I was pressed for time so I marinated the ribs raw for 1 hour, placed the ribs in a roaster, reserving the remaining marinate and then baked them @ 400º for 1½ hours. I boiled the marinate (I could not find lemongrass @ our local store so I used ½ tsp grated lemon peel) and then for the last 20 minutes added the marinate to the ribs. Delicious !!!

Absolutely...one of the best pork sauces I've ever tasted. This is not only delicious with ribs, but I use the marinade for pork loin or pork chops, and always get rave reviews. VERY easy and fast to make, especially since most of the prep is ahead of time.

These ribs are EXACTLY what you are looking for! How many times have you had ribs, and the big question is; what barbecue sauce am I going to use tonight? Well here you go. Compleatly different and totaly delicious! And a must for this dish, basmati rice salad with currants and nuts. Plus four great friends and lots of beer!

The sauce was fantastic and I would definitely make it again. I did find however, that because the meat was cooked before the sauce was put on it, it really didn't penetrate, so serving the sauce on it was necessary otherwise the ribs wouldn't have much flavour.

THE BEST!! I have been making ribs for 15 years and this got to be in the top three of all time.

This recipe lacks punch. I prepared it using country-style ribs, microwaved first and finished in a smoker. They were tender and juicy. Some may feel the sauce is subtle but to us it was a sweety pan Asian paste lacking edge or interest.

Rating: 3
Definately the most tender ribs I have ever eaten. I took a previous reviewers suggestion to cook the ribs in the microwave first instead of steaming them and it worked perfectly. My children loved the sauce too, but since they are texturally challenged I strained the sauce before reducing it. A keeper!

Rating: 3
These ribs had an incredible taste. The only thing I would do different next time is cut the marinade in half as most of it went down the sink. My husband is not a "cilantro lover" but I found that everything blended in so beautifully that you did not recognize it was there.

Definite hit! I made this for a Labor Day BBQ and it was easy to make and everyone loved it. The sauce was key. I wasn't able to use lemongrass so I substituted it with lemon juice and rind. These ribs are great if you're in the mood for something unique and flavorful.

WOW. If you do anything in your life, make this recipe! I have seen people have fist fights over these ribs. Note: - I microwave the ribs in a large ceramic bowl filled with water for about 35-40 minutes on high or so until they're just about done. Let cool then marinate as directed. This gets rid of fat, any evil bacteria and makes them a snap to cook when the grill gets going. - You can subsitute lemon peel for the lemon grass. - I ran out of brown sugar, white worked just fine. Enjoy!

Excellent marinade. Whenever I make this dish, I make double of the marinade to use in other dishes... like stirfries, rice and noodle dishes. Sometimes I bake the ribs in the oven for 45 minutes instead of grilling, disregarding the steaming process. I have also used this quite successfully with chicken thighs. YUM!

Rating: 4
I substituted kaffir lime leaves for the lemon grass and added a Tbsp of key lime juice, and then I skewered kabobs and sate strips instead of ribs. My wife and I found the flavor to be robust and distinctive- outstanding and definately now part of our regular summer repertoire. Great with a dipping sauce, over rice, with noodles, or even as a pita sandwich!

Really good ribs! I'm with the other reviewers on this one -- these things are fine. After boiling the marinade for a minute or so, I strained mine, which ended up being a very velvety sauce! I used light coconut milk, which worked lovely. Absolutely delicious.
