Delicious! I added one jalapeño (with seeds) chopped to the salsa for some heat. So good and easy!

This was excellent! My hubby doesn't like fennel but there were NO complaints. I used it on the pork chops for them and my cod filet for me. Was great!

Great recipe. I added the onions to the skillet shortly before the fennel was done to give them a slight caramelization. Also, the market was sold out of pomegranates so I reduced some POM juice and drizzled it over everything. It worked great.

I loved the "salsa" this made although the grocery store I went to didn't have pomegranates in stock, so I simply omitted it. I also omitted all the salt- from the rub on the meat & from the salsa- and it was great! I'd make the salsa again for sure, maybe adding some citrus- lemon, lime or orange juice.

Made the dish as is, the dish came out tasted and looked great! The only thing we would add is it took longer for us to have the pork well cooked! will definitely make it again!

Stand by favorite for guests. Great flavor and beautiful dish. Like others, I sear/roast a pork tenderloin because it is faster for serving larger groups. I serve with a curried quinoa that is has dried cranberries and roasted butternut squash.

This dish both looked and tasted great, though I think if I make it again I'll roast the pork in the oven rather than pan fry - it was the most time- consuming and distracting part of making the dish as I had to keep babysitting the pork to make sure it wasn't over or undercooked. I served with rice and a side salad, and my picky husband was very happy. The pomegranate and fennel were great together, and I made the salsa about 4 hours ahead of time so the flavors could meld.

Am writing primarily about salsa. **SALSA IS FAR,FAR BETTER MADE ONE DAY AHEAD. *I paired with pork loin, rubbed with moroccan spice (cinnamon, chili peppers,smoked paprika, etc) roasted in oven. SUPERB! Hot and Cool flavors - very refreshing *An older pom, slightly shriveled exterior, will surrender seeds easily in out-of-water peel and has no negative impact on final product. *Salsa pairs nicely with a spicy wine - white (Gewurz) or red (Lemberger).

Really delicious and easy! I've never prepared pork chops before, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I will definitely make it again.

We loved this recipe. The salsa was delicious but next time I am going to try it with sweet onion in the salsa, cooked with the fennel. The pork chops I used were pretty think (from Cumbrae's in Toronto - deelish!) so i seared them first then lowered the heat, covered them and let them cook through.

I really liked this recipe. I made a few changes the second time, hope it helps. Instead of pork chops I used pork roast, I used a dry rub of chillies and rosemary sea salt. I added a jalapeno pepper (a must). I served it with black rice and roasted asparagus. My date was very impressed.

This was amazing. I followed the recipe pretty closely, although I used olive oil instead of vegetable. Because the oil and the skillet got really hot, I ended up flipping the pork chops after 3 minutes because they were already golden. I was worried about the pork chops getting too dry so after I flipped over the meat, I turned down the flame and put a cover on the skillet to keep in the moisture. I ended up leaving it on that side for about 6 minutes. Then I put them on a plate to "rest." Unfortunately, my guests arrived much later then expected but when I reheated the pork chops in the microwave, they were still juicy and delicious. Another reason that they may have cooked so fast was because they were on the thinner and smaller side. I had *no idea* how this was going to turn out because I had never cooked with fresh fennel before but the dish turned out wonderful. The mixture of cilantro and fennel bulb tasted GREAT. Everyone could not stop raving.

I followed the recipe exactly. A pretty and pleasant dish, made interesting by the pomegranate seeds. The salsa could use some pepping up -- not to make it hot, just to give it a little more flavor. (The fennel is not very assertive.) Thanks to a previous reviewer for the tip on seeding the pomegranate underwater -- it still doesn't go fast, but at least I didn't get pink juice all over the place. I'll definitely make this again, maybe do a little experimenting with it.

I used dbl thick cut chops and did a dry rub & used a chipolte in adobo in the rub. Way to hot my fault. It totally overppowered the salsa. The salsa is great I know it sounds weird but I think I'll put it on my oatmeal tomorrow am for a change of taste.

I really wanted to make this, but pomegranates are out of season, so I went with the chopped mango suggestion and it was delicious!! I also added some softened dried cranberries and barbequed the pork chops with a rub. My husband loved it so much he said he didn't care if I ever made it with the pomegrantes, but I wil,l as soon as I see them at the market! A recipe must!!

I made it with onions instead of fennel and chicken instead of pork (okay- it's not really the same recipe if you do that, but it shows you that you can mess with it if you want to.) For those who might not know this trick- try filling your sink or a large bowl with water, cut off one end of the pomegranate and then submerge the pomegranate in the water and rip it apart with your hands. The seeds will sink to the bottom, and the pithy part should rise to the top (most of it) making it easy to separate.

This was really tasty. The presentation was beautiful. The fennel and pomegranate went together wonderfully. It would make a wonderful holiday dinner. The colors are so festive. Like others, we had lots of salsa left over.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. It was very good but there was a lot of salsa. We will have the leftover as a side dish it was so good. While fun to eat, the pomegranate is very messy to prepare!

I actually used parsley instead of cilantro and it turned out beautifully! Even my picky 14 year old son loved it! The next day I cut up the cold leftover pork, and mixed it in with the remaining salsa - the flavors tasted even better the next day!

The salsa was really spectacular. A perfect compliment of flavors and it's beautiful, textural and an elegant nod to the season. I did deviate from the recipe by substituting minced yellow onion in the place of scallions and adding 1/4 chopped mint. My guests (even the picky one who thinks that processed cheese slices are fine dining) raved that it was the best part of the dinner party - which included blinis and caviar, so that's really saying something.

really liked this..didn't have scallions so I used shallots and the salsa is a nice change..will make this again

Fennel flavour was overpowered by the cilantro, both of which I like, just not together. Other recipes opn this site much better.

Great recipe. Served it after a pasta starter (with asparagus). Used dried cherries instead of Pomegranate, to general acclaim!

This was good, but not outstanding. The pork took much longer to cook than called for, and I ended up finishing it in the oven (of course my chops were pretty thick). The salsa was great. Next time I may grill the chops, which would also be less messy in the kitchen. Good for a relatively quick meal.

This recipe was just plain icky. I had to "save" it with all kinds of last minute tricks (lemon juice, etc.) and it still was barely presentable. The fennel and pomegranite just didn't go together at all.

Fabulous recipe...the salsa is amazing and has such an interesting crunchy texture. Don't be shy, pile it right on top of the pork chop!

Yummy! I made lamb chops instead of pork. I put them under the broiler for 6-7 minutes per side. I didn't have cilantro on hand so I used flat leaf parsley instead - still delicious. I also didn't use a whole cup of pomegranate seeds..2/3 -3/4 cup was perfect (for 3 servings). It looks gorgeous too - very appealing. A Keeper!

This recipe is great! It didn't take long at all and everyone I've made it for has raved. One note for those concerned about presentation- don't chop the fennel until right before it goes in the pan, otherwise it will turn brown.

This recipe is great. A tip for the pomegranete: After halfing it, remove the seeds with your fingers while keeping the fruit submerged in a bowl of water. That way, there's no splatter. The seeds just float to the bottom, and when you're finished you can strain them out.

When my friend gave me my first pomegranate, I was stumped. Thanks to epicurious, I used a cup of its seeds in this recipe and the rest in a small batch of the Avacado and Pear Guacamole (also terrific), and now I'm hooked. The fennel salsa was savory and the pomegranate added color and crunch (though my husband thought TOO much so - he asked if we could use half the seeds next time). The combination with pork chops was beautiful, interesting and delicious.

I fixed this recipe when it was first published and it was a big hit. When I saw pomegranates in the store today, I instantly thought of the dish and decided to prepare it this weekend. If all goes well, I will triple the recipe and prepare it for our office potluck at the beginning of October.

The salsa is wonderful. There were no pomegranates in the market the day I made this, so I substituted kiwi and passionfruit.

My local grocery didn't have pomegranates, so I substituted two ripe mangoes. It was delicious.

This dish is all about the salsa-- its texture livens up any simply prepared meat(I've also had it with sauteed salmon) and keeps for a long time. I did add a bit extra vinegar than was called for, which gave it a nice extra tang.

Attracted to this dish because of on hand pomegrante. The pork chops were good, typical of pan fried. The salsa was unique, but somehow unsatisfying. Would make again if I had excess pomegrantes.
