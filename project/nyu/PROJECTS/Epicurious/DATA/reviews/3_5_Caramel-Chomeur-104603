Each time I've made this, people have thrown themselves at the dish for seconds. It's gooey and super-sweet and a great cold-weather dessert.

Just so you know, this dessert is actually called Pouding Chômeur, and it's a french canadian staple. It was created during the Great Depression by québecois and other french canadian housewives to make a cheap, delicious dessert. You can also add some maple syrup to the brown sugar mixture to give it a different note. If the cake is not working for you, I suggest just using your favorite white cake/pound cake recipe. Keep in mind that this recipe is supposed to be the essence of simplicity and thriftiness. Bon appétit !

Very good, not difficult to make, and uses ingredients readily avaialble in the house. Made it many times and everyone always enjoys it.

Not sure why there were so many people getting pancakes! This one definitely gets better with practice though, and I have more success when I make a double recipe. Have served this for 2 French food days and an International Bake sale, looking it up now for another. Everyone loved it, but smaller servings are suggestable since it is very dense.

One of the best non-chocolate desserts I have ever made. A family favorite that I make over and over again for large groups of people. Anyone who says that it tastes like a pancake (or other unusual description) either didn't make it correctly or does not like caramel desserts. (I work a few blocks from the restaurant from which this recipe was taken and the found there is excellent.) Make sure you serve it hot with vanilla ice cream.

Guests begged for seconds, although this was a rich dessert. Passed recipe to 3 people. I'd rate this as "comfort food."

I also made this dessert to top off a meal of coq au vin. My husband and I quite enjoyed it with the vanilla ice cream, and I was surprised that the other reveiwers thought it tasted like pancakes. Sorry the other reviewers did not fare so well, perhaps they did not make it correctly.

This tastes too much like a pancake. If you look at the ingredients they are very much the same to the makings of a pancake.

I'd give this zero forks if possible--it was terrible! I love caramel and gooey, sweet things, and thought this would be great, but it ended up tasting like bad box-mix pancakes with imitation maple syrup. This was all the stranger because 1) there was nothing maple in this, and 2) there were no imitation or less-than-perfect ingredients used. DO NOT waste your time on this one.

I grew up with this dish, we French Canadians call it Pouding au Chaumeur( poor man's pudding, because a 'chaumeur' is out of work) I have many friends who also enjoy the dish when I mix shredded coconut into the batter or put it into the sauce! It is a very sweet dish, so a little goes a long way, especially on a cold winter's night! Enjoy

I made this dessert to go with a meal of coq a vin on a very cold night, and it made for a comfort meal that was unforgettable!

My expectations weren't very high, as this recipe was so incredibly easy. It wasn't very pretty, either. That said, my husband and I killed the leftovers in such short order! It is rich (and REQUIRES the vanilla ice cream) and sooo good warm. For an absolutely quick-fix dessert, this is the best!!

This unique cake was absolutely wonderful! My picky husband couldn't get enough of it. It is best served right out of the oven when the caramel is gooey, otherwise it becomes a thick consistency, but still tastes good. Vanilla ice cream is the perfect accompaniment.

The real thing is called "pudding chômeur" and the caramel sauce is made with 2 cups brown sugar, 2 cups water, 1 tablespoon flour. Boil the sauce and pour over the cake. cook 40 minutes at 375o.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. Looked good and was easy to make, but was extremely bland and tasteless. Too sweet and the brown sugar somehow never melted. I had people over for dinner ... the left-overs in their dessert plates said it all. Maybe someone else will have better luck with it.
