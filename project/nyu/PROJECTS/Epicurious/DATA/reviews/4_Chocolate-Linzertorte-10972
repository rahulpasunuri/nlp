I've made this a couple times and it is pretty idiot proof. Toasting/skinning the hazelnuts is definitely the hardest part. I didn't bother to skin them the second time and while it had a noticeable effect on the texture of the crust, it wasn't a disaster. I've also used jams with seeds in them, didn't bother me or my guests at all.

SOOO great!!! I loved it and so did my guests. I would have to say that anyone expecting a very chocolate crust would be disappointed. The chocolate is very subtle -- and though it adds to the taste, it isn't a chocolate taste, per se. I used a 120z jar of Smuckers seedless red rasberry jam and it worked great. I already have requests to make it again for Christmas.

I cut this recipe by 1/3 to fit into a smaller tart pan and it was an instant hit with my husband. The only 'adjustment' made to this recipe was to omit the lemon zest being that the combination of chocolate and lemons does not appeal to me. I should think that apricot jam should work well with this too and will definitely try it the next time.

Simply delicious. Perfect made one to three days ahead. The crust has a buttery, sablé like texture. Well worth the effort of hunting down the seedless raspberry jam. Served it with Haagen Däazs vanilla ice cream.

This combination of chocolate, hazelnuts and raspberry is impossibly divine. The recipe itself is idiot-proof, I made it for a dinner party (without having made it before hand) and it turned out wonderful. Because I was in a rush, I wasn't able to remove most of the skins off the hazelnut, but it didn't matter as the crust was still sublime. In addition, the tart is picture-perfect. I wouldn't change anything at all about the recipe. My only suggestion would be to be careful about selecting the least sweet raspberry jam you can find in the grocery (I added some lemon juice to mine to undercut the sweetness). Home-made jam, needless to say, is probably the best option.

Delicious and easy to make. The perfect finish for the best Christmas dinner I ever made. The main course was Roasted Rack of Venison and Shallots with Dried-Cranberry Gravy, also on this site. Actually, I substituted fillet of beef because it was too late to order venison.

This is a Christmas tradition in our home now. I've made this every year since 1993 and love it as do every member of my family

This has been a hit since the first time I made it in December 1993. I have made it with and without the chocolate, used apricots, black raspberies,or cherries. Anyway I try its just great. It taste better the second and third day.
