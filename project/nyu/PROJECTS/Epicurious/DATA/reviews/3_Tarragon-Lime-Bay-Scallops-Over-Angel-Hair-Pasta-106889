Very BLAND! I feel as though I've just wasted the beautiful scallops I'd bought. I'd used Whole wheat pasta, and increased the tarragon & lime juice. Also, I'd sauteed scallops in fresh garlic (2 cloves) and STILL this was SO bland. Husband said this was awful as well. Too many great scallop recipes out there to mess w/altering this again. :(

I had bay scallops and tarragon to work with but this recipe didn't sound all that exciting to me, so reading the reviews, I decided to take A Cook from New York's advice, adding garlic, red onion, chopped tomatoes and a splash of red wine. It's so delicious made that way that it's become one of my favourite dishes.

Total disaster, not for the novice cook. Perhaps if I used a hardier pasta it would not have come out tasting like glue. Truly disappointing in flavor & texture. Not worth the money or the time invested, absolutely will never make again.

Like others who have reviewed this recipe, I altered this recipe to my own tastes and instincts: I sauted julienned carrots, onions, garlic, and tarragon..and set that aside. Then I sauted the bay scallops until just done. Then I added the carrots, tarragon, and garlic...along with some diced tomatoes back with the scallops and gave it a good amount of fresh ground pepper. Long about then, the pasta was done. Mixed it all together, then sprinkled some feta on top. Now that made it a four-fork dinner. Will make again...for guests.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to follow the suggestions of "A Cook from Glastonbuty, CT" and was very glad I did. The addition of the fennel, carrots and red onion made a big difference, thank you! I also turned the heat off and put a lid on the pan after adding the scallops to the mix. They turned out perfect just using the residual heat and weren't the least bit tough. Will make this again!

Blecch. I spent a quite a bit of money on fresh lovely bay scallops to have this recipe happen to them. Neither my children nor my husband finished. Everyone asked me to never make this again. They all picked out their scallops and left everything else. Then we made a salad. I made the recipe as directed. I don't think it's even worth experimenting with.

This is a very tasty recipe. It is important to add the reserved 1/4 c of cooking water to the pasta as instructed though. I didn't and it was a bit dry. I added some feta cheese at the end which my husband and I liked. The flavor of the lime juice with the tarragon was superb!

Pretty good. I like the tangy lime with the butter. I don't think I put enough tarragon in mine, but I was using dried instead of fresh.

Agree with other reviewers that this is an unexciting resipe as written. Spice it up with cayenne, garlic, etc. and it's not bad. Overall, there are better recipes for bay scallops - and don't even dare waste the larger sea scallops on it!

Made this with only 3 tbs butter to keep fat content down. Also added dried cilantro and a small bit of red pepper to the tarragon to givethe dish a little more flavor. Tasted great! A simple, quick way to enjoy bay scallops.

This recipe is one fork if you follow the original directions. 4 forks if you follow these directions: Sauteed red onions until translucent. Add finely chopped, fresh garlic. Add chopped tomatoes. A splash of red wine. Salt & Pepper. Lime juice. Sear/mix scallops until opaque. Add tarragon. In another bowl toss scallop mixture and pasta together. Add more tarragon as a garnish.

Bland and aweful, sounded easy but lacked taste and, when made as directed, my guys said NEVER do it again.

I made this recipe last night and was really suprised how average it was. Other reviewers love it, and it sounds appealing enough, but I found the combination really unexciting. There are much better ways to make scallops- and angel hair pasta.

This recipe was so delicious and so easy. Very refreshing. I used dried tarragon and put some on the scallops before cooking them and added a little more to the pasta while it was reheating. The lime combined with the tarragon is a wonderful taste. Served fresh lime on the table for my husband who wanted extra lime but this is certainly a recipe I'll make again and again. Didn't want all the butter so used half the butter and replaced the rest with olive oil. Also used whole wheat pasta because it's healthier! YUM!

I made this for my boyfriend tonight who is a very picky eater, but loves scallops. The scallops I bought were very fresh and high quality, which I think makes a huge difference in the outcome of the recipe. Personally, I liked it better with a little more lime juice, but my boyfriend liked it as is. I will definitley make this again, as well as make it for company.

My husband is picky about seafood, so I simply used chicken, added a shallot and a little garlic, and had to use 2 tsp dried tarragon in place of the fresh, but the dish has a lovely, rich flavor, and every bite was eaten on the first night. Quick, easy, and good, though with all that butter, certainly not for every night!

My wife and I both thought it was great. With a bag of frozen scallops it makes a quick and delicious weekday meal.

I didn't like this at all. Something about the lime and tarragon didn't go well with the scallops and it all tasted kind of fishy and sour.

After reading reviews to this recipe - I modified the recipe to create this more seasoned and colorful recipe. My Husband loved it! 1. Chop 1/2 red onion, julienne 3 carrots and julienne 1 stick of fresh fennel (anise)- saute with a tablespoon or two of oil about 3 minutes until tender but not soft. remove from pan 2. Cooked scallops as directed but in 1/2 oil & 1/2 butter for healthier eating. 3. Return vegtables to pan with scallops added lime juice (I doubled the amount to about 6 tablespoons), 2 teaspoons tarragon, 2 teaspoons savory, 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper and 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt. cook to quick boil and serve 4. Served pasta w/ scallops on individual platters and season lightly w/ grated asagio cheese.

Tasteless and rather boring. Not very interesting to look at. I added a bit of garlic and still thought it was dull.

Although this a quick & easy to prepare, there is something missing.

The tarragon in this dish is perfect with the scallops- compliments without being too heavy a taste for the scallops to shine through. But it lacked in color, and needed something more-I am not sure what. Vey easy though, and good, just not as delicious as I had hoped.

This meets all the criteria - easy, quick and really delicious. It was excellent for four, I use dry sea scallops, halved, they worked beutifully. Served steamed broccolini on the side and warm crusty bread.MMMMMMMMmmmmmmm

This dish was perfect for the lovely scallops my husband brought home unexpectedly. It is light in texture, and the flavors compliment the mild taste of the scallops. I sauteed a few bunches of spinach in (gasp!) more butter and garnished around the edge of the pasta bowl with it to make it a one-dish meal. Husband loved it, our 3-year old was indifferent.

It was absolutely delicious. I made it twice in one week. Once for my husband and I and another for friends.

This recipe was simple and delicious. Wouldn't change a thing. My husband, who is not particularly into scallops, even thought it was good. I'm making this recipe for guests this weekend who are looking for scallop recipes.

I was so excited to make this dish when I saw it, but, unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations. I can't figure out if I did something wrong, though I could swear I followed the recipe to the letter. Thank goodness I tried it out on myself because I ended up throwing it out.
