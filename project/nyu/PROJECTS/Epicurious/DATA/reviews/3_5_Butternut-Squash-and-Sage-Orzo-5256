As written it is 3 stars but I made edits to the recipe to make it 4. I roasted the squash with olive oil, balsamic, salt and pepper and tossed in at the end. I cooked the sage with the onions and used less broth. For the cheese I used crumbled goat cheese and it was delicious.

A fantastic recipe! For a vegetarian entree this is a very good one. I liked it with a little more sage and a little more parmesan - but these are matters of personal taste.

I's sorry...but I am going to be "odd man out" This dish was one step from the garbage, as far as we are concerned. The squash (once cooked) had no taste...cooking 1 cup of orzo in 3-1/2 cups broth is such a waste... I was smart enough to save the broth, because the sauce was dry at the end, so I had to add some back into the dish...the sage tasted too harsh; it should have been added during the cooking of the onions and garlic. I had tried another recipe for Butternut Squash and Sage from Cooks Illustrated that was phenomenal compared to this. You can keep this one....I'll pass

This is amazingly easy and tasty dish - even kids like it! Very healthy and colorful on the table, so great to bring to parties. Don't change the recipe, it's perfect as it is!

Easy! I added some chopped, toasted pistachios, which was a great addition.

We made this dish and added two chopped apples right after the onions were added. We also substituted butternut squash with butterCUP squash. Also, we didn't drain the orzo after it cooked. This was amazing. Top it off with a little extra shredded Parmesan and it is as good-looking as it is tasty.

This is very good, but could use a bit of modification. As other reviewers noted, it's a little dry... I think this is because of the squash itself soaking up mixture, so that's likely unfixable. I also thought it was a little mushy however, so added some toasted, chopped hazelnuts. Really nice.

I wanted to love it but I didn't even like it. I expected it to be creamy but it was very dry and had too much squash and very little sage.

The flavor combination of butternut squash and sage is SO delicious and addictive - I had no idea (but I do love fresh sage - actually hate the dried stuff). Just want others who might have dietary restrictions to know that this dish is still fantastic with modifications - my DH can't eat onions and garlic and we stay away from butter, so I roasted the squash in EVOO at 400 for about 35 minutes, cooked the orzo in the chicken broth and wine, and put in a bunch of fresh chives from my garden with the fresh sage, then tossed the squash in with the rest. Since other reviewers said this was good without the cheese and since we were having this as a side dish with meat I made it without the cheese. (Plan to also try it with, as an entree.) This would be an excellent Thanksgiving side dish for a change.

This was AMAZING! I followed the directions exactly and it was a perfect accompanciment to a mustard and molasses marinated pork tenderloin (Bon Appetit July 2005 Readers Recipe). The only thing that I would change would be to add more sage. This is a definite keeper!

This was a big hit with us. I made it as a main course and added chopped up canadian bacon which gave it a nice smoky flavor. I used dried sage and added some ground nutmeg. I'm sure fresh is better but the dried tasted good too!

I am admittedly not a huge fan of orzo, but this dish was pretty mediocre. Should have made risotto instead.

This smelled marvelous, and was a hit at my dinner party. I used vegetable stock as there were several vegetarians. Don't skip the fresh sage.

The texture of the orzo is creamy and the fresh sage adds great flavor. The first time I made the dish, I did not drain teh liquid from the orzo and the dish was much creamier that when I did, so I will be careful to retain the flavor of the broth the next time I prepare the dish

This was a huge hit!!

This was wonderful and not hard to make. I didn't use the white wine used broth instead. Made it like directions but added grated nutmeg to taste with the parmesan and fresh sage. Was very creamy and wonderful flavor...a keeper. Fresh sage and parmesan are key ingredients.

Rating: 4
I served with the classic osso buco recipe found on this site - absolutely delicious pairing. The orzo recipe (which I doubled easily for a dinner party) was undemanding to prepare, and every one of my guests lined up for seconds. I will definitely make this one over and over. Don't omit the good parmesan and the fresh sage - so vital.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! I will definitely make this dinner again because it was a nice light meal that had a lot of flavor. Good for summer or winter.

I thought this was fabulous. I didn't have the white wine, but followed the rest of the recipe to a "T". The orzo came out creamy but al dente, and the combination of the flavors was perfectly savory. I slightly undercooked the squash so it wouldn't mush when mixed together. I was worried the parmesan might be too much but it complimented it perfectly. This was served as a side dish to garlic lemon sauteed shrimp with a tossed salad and was perfectly paired with both.

I came across this recipe in the Bon Appetit Cookbook then re-located it here on-line. This recipe was delicious as is and very easy to make. The outcome was colorful, bountiful, and a wonderful "feel good" side dish (or vegetarian entree with vegetable stock instead of chicken).

Rating: 4
Delicious melding of texture and taste! I made a few substitutions that were more for the "stock" pantry than the "specialty" shopping I might ordinarily do.... Instead of orzo I prepared two cups of hot tri-color couscous which I always keep in my pantry, using 3 cups of the chicken broth. Instead of the fresh sage I used 1 Tablespoon rubbed sage. It was delicious as I made it, using a package of cubed butternut squash from Trader Joe's. I paired it with homemade Chicken Cordon Bleu (using procuitto) and steamed veggies. I will definitely make this one again.

This was good, but didn't wow me. I made it for guests and they really liked it. I think I will look for another squash recipe.

3-1/2 forks, actually. OMG, this was so delicious that, just like dcbabe in LA, I kept going back for leftovers after supper was done!:-D I did change matters slightly--i used brown rice in place of orzo for the whole-grain healthfulness, and i added a splash of H & H for little creaminess. I'm going to try it next with pearl barley, which would be a more neutral flavor (like the orzo). I also doubled the amount of sage (mine seemed a bit bland) and didn't think the parmesan added signficantly, having tried it both ways, several times, lol.

Since my daughter became a vegetarian, I'm constantly looking for something she'll actually eat, since, strangely enough, she's picky about vegetables. This was a hit for her and even for those of us who still eat meat, even though I messed up a bit.. sauteed the sage with the squash, used ditalini instead of orzo and locatelli romano instead of parmesan.. still delicious! Definitely a make it again, Mom!

Terrific! I wouldn't change a thing - the flavors were perfectly balanced. I will make this again and again. Highly recommended!

Not bad - parmesean definitely gives it more flavor. Nice change of pace to eat orzo warm/hot (vs. in a salad).

Rating: 3
I've been making this dish for several years. It's almost addictive. The only significant change i made to the recipe is that i don't add the parmesean. After making it the first time, i found it (the cheese) overpowered the subtle flavors of the squash and sage.

Rating: 3
Excellent combination of flavors. I love sage, so I would not hesitate to double the amount. Like the previous cook, my squash was not tender in 10 minutes, but I am fairly sure it was the right size. Consider a small dice, and I think you'd be fine. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Really, really good. My squash wasn't cut small enough so it took longer to cook than it should have. Had a similar dish at a wine tasting, with crispy sage and crispy serrano ham. I think next time I'll add both.

p.s. i don't use orzo. i cook farfalline in plain water -- no chicken broth.

Rating: 3
the first time i made this recipe, i made it as printed. i found i did not like the parmesean; it was too overpowering for the subtle flavor of the squash. the second time, i simply omitted the parmesean and fell in love! it's simple, yet compelling flavor is addictive. i have found myself standing in the kitchen after dinner eating the leftovers out of the pot with a spoon! i do not saute the squash until the pan is dry. i make sure that there is a little liquid left with which to coat the pasta. fresh sage is a must, too. yum!

I have made this several times for us and for company. It is a nice accompaniment to pork - it is creamy like a risotto, but simpler to prepare.

Served for a Valentine's Dinner party - as the side dish to Filet Mignon with creamy digon-caper sauce and roasted asparagus. It was a wonderful side dish with complex but pleasingly comforting flavors. Don't miss the fresh sage - I used dried sage and it didn't have quite the oomph that it needed.

Rating: 3
Very good! I found that cooking the squash ahead helped with last minute cooking. Seasoning each component is important for the perfect end result. I also drained at least 1 cup of homemade chicken stock down the drain from the orzo. :(

Rating: 4
Easy and great! It was a hit. Cooked the Orzo in home-made chicken broth. Didn't change anything. I think sauteed mushrooms in place of squash would be great too. Next time, I'll cut back on the chicken broth for the orzo as I drained away about 1/2 cup +.

This was so simple to prepare and the results were wonderful! I look forward to making this again.

It took longer, but I baked the cubed squash until nicely carmelized and skipped the "simmering for ten minutes" step. This gave the recipe a nice level a sweetness.

This dish could be a wonderful Thanksgiving side dish. Also a good vegetarian dish. Complex flavors but easy to make. Great combination!

I also am a private chef, and this is one of my most requested side dishes in the fall/winter! I usually serve it with a pork dish (today it was grilled pork tenderloin) and always have raves. I find it an interesting blend of sweet and savory. Based on earlier reviews I was careful to check the seasoning all the way along the first time I made it. I found that if each component was adequately seasoned the dish was rich and flavorful in the end!

On its own it may be bland...but with the Pork Chops with Dried cherry sauce it is amazing! Try it I guarantee you will love it!

Rating: 2
This was too bland. It needed more garlic, butter, sage, something! The cubed squash took much longer to cook than expected, so the orzo got soggy. Results were OK, but not worth the trouble.

I have made this dish for everyone from hip young colleagues to my Grandmother and everyone loves it including me! When I need a quick, but impressive light meal, I serve this one with a salad side (butter leaf and romaine with thinly sliced ripe pears, shaved asiago and toasted pecans). When I need a major hearty meal, I've served this one with a meat and salad side (Like grilled flank steak marinated in soy-honey-lime and cracked red pepper, with a grilled tomatoes and zucchini salad). Thanks a bazillion for sharing this easy recipe Epicurious!

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes! It is especially good with herb-encrusted roast pork tenderloin, or tenderloin with cranberry chutney. I always make a little extra so that I can have more of this yummy recipe the following day.
