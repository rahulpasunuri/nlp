Not bad, definitely a lot of work, but in the end it all came out fine. If boys eating every last bit is a good indicator, then its a good way to cook game birds.

Since pheasant isn't available in my area and I'm sick of cooking chicken, I tried this recipe with Cornish hens. The birds were so tender that they practically fell apart while we ate them. This was a big hit for the fall weather we're getting now! I paired this recipe with some brown rice, and for dessert, I made caramelized apples to spoon over bowls of vanilla ice cream.

Did this a second time with pheasant, and it's a big winner. Significanlty better than with chicken. Roasting the onions with the braise for a while really softens the onions up and makes a great difference.

Cooked for only myself, so just used 1/2 a chicken instead of a whole pheasant, and subsituted thyme for the tarragon. Really enjoyed the end result. Only issue is that the pearl onions take much longer to cook than the apples. Next time, I'll roast them in the oven 20 mins while still braising the bird to get them going before adding apples.

I love pheasant and cook it a lot. This recipe was way too much work and in the end I couldn't tell it pheasant. Flavor was only fair and overpowered the pheasant. It could just as well have been chicken.

It was lots of work, but very good and worth the time. Great mild flavors, but they compliment the pheasant and kept it moist, which is hard to do. The next night we shredded the meat off the bones and simmered in the sauce and pour over a bowl of California short grain white rice, (Tamanishiki brand is best). I would have liked to double the pearl onion portions as the side. It pairs well with a 2000 Cline Zin too...
