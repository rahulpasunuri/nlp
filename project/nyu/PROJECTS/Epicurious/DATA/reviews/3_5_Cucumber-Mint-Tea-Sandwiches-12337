These were a big hit at a recent bridal shower tea. I followed another reviewers suggestion of lightly buttering the bread first. I doubled the recipe and tripled the amount of mint. Yummy!

When making tea sandwiches, the trick is to butter the bread first with a fine layer of butter, then spread with the filling. The butter keeps the fillings from leaching into the bread and making it soggy. I learned this trick from a "high tea" class back in the 90's. This cucumber/mint sandwich is so simple, elegant, and very tasty. I've used it for years!

Okay, but to me not great. I wonder if it would have been tastier with just cream cheese and mint, not half cream cheese half butter - the tanginess of the cream cheese probably would have made for a better contrast to the mint and cucumber. And I used tons of fresh mint from my garden! The butter did not add anything at all in my opinion, and made them rather bland.

A big hit, and surprisingly easy to make. They're so light and refreshing. They don't keep though. By the 9 hour mark they were getting soggy. There shouldn't be leftovers though, it's just that I got a little bread happy and made way too may sandwiches.

So fun, just like a tea room. I recently made these for a Baptism reception and they were a hit with all ages and genders. The mint was a surprise to people, but they loved it. Wouldn't change a thing and will make them again and again.

Lovely recipe, a bit different than other cucumber sandwiches. They have been a big hit with tea parties, though I suggest making a bigger batch, as the recipe for 12 sandwiches only made 8 standard tea sandwiches for me (with bread, crusts removed and quartered).

I have made this several times for book clubs and office parties and they're always a hit. Very refreshing and the mint is always a pleasant surprise to people.

Used Pepperidge Farms Thin sliced bread with the crusts cut off and quartered ( a tip I learned from a tea room). What a pretty presentation when piled up on a tray.

We have made these for numerous baby showers and teas. People of all ages enjoy this wonderful treat.

I made these along with the Smoked Almond & Chicken Tea Sandwiches. This one was just "ok" for me. I typically love minty things but have never tried it in a sandwich. I thought it was bland and a bit bitter. I may try it again sometime, but probably with white bread and more mint? we'll see.

Celery seed is also quite good to replace the mint, though you don't need quite as much of it.

great cucumber sandwiches, I also substituted Dill for the mint, turned out great

My mom made this for a mother daughter tea at her church and we just loved it, had to fight my sister for the last noe! I'm making it for a bridal shower I'm throwing for my girlfriend. I plan to use cookie cutters to make cute shapes. I would not substitute anything for the mint, it really is delicious the way it is and doesn't need any changes. Must use fresh mint, much better flavor and texture. Very refreshing.

I made this for a tea party and I had trouble not eating all the mini sandwiches before the guests arrove! I was not the only one who enjoyed them though, they were gone in no time! I do suggest using thin slices of cucumber.

This tea sandwich, along with the minted radish one also from epicurious, were easy to prepare and everyone loved them.

Good and fairly simple.

Well, I can't in good concious rate this since I used fresh Basil instead of Mint. That said, it was very good and satisified the craving I had for cucumbers and cream cheese. I actually downed all three sandwiches it makes in ONE sitting. Good thing I'm eating for two :)

Very Good! It was a little bland in comparison with some of the other sandwiches I served. But it got good reviews and i'm passing the recipe on.

Very tasty sandwiches. I toasted my wheat bread and allowed it to cool to give the bread some more texture. The mint is very refreshing and the spread is very nice. :) Great addition to a tea party.

These are very good! I used rye party bread cut into circles. I also used dill instead of mint. I left them open-face with 2 slices of cucumber. Rave reviews!

Nice combination of flavors--a nice, light finger sandwich to accompany a cup of hot tea.

Made these for a baby shower along with three other types of tea sandwiches from this website--these were yummy and perfect for a summer luncheon

These were a hit at a 4th of July BBQ. I used dill instead of mint because I also made the minted radish tea sandwiches. Next time I might make both "cucumber mint" and "cucumber dill," to make things easier and still have variety.

Hate those reviews that say "I made this but substituted chicken for beef and water for cream and it was great," but I DID substitute dill for the mint and it WAS wonderful. I'm sure mint would have been just as good, but I served these with minted radish tea sandwiches (also on this site) and the combo was super!

This was a super recipe. We made it with a summery chicken recipe and they were the perfect edition! There were no leftovers!

Mmmm! Made these for a mother/daughter tea party. The girls are 4 years old - and even they LOVED it! The best sandwich at the party by far...

Made these sandwiches for mother/daughter book club. They were gobbled up instantly. I agree: fresh mint is a must. And, they're best when nicely chilled.

Delicious and easy to prepare. I served these with three other types of tea sandwiches (all from epicurious), along with a vegetable crudite. This was all we needed for our busy luncheon, where it was too crowded to gather around a table.

Made for a bridal shower, so very easy to make. They were gobbled up quickly. I recommend using fresh mint.

Light and fresh tasting. The fresh mint really makes this tea sandwich. Made as part of an assortment for a baby shower. Would definately make again.

Instead of using fresh mint (which I couldn't find in the supermarket near me) I used dried mint according to the recipe, and peppermint extract to taste. I found it to be very refreshing and a nice palate cleanser before meals. Next time, I'm going to try it with Rye Bread.

I made these sandwiches for a baby shower. They were fantastic. The butter/cream cheese mixture coats the bread so it doesn't get soggy from the cucumber moisture. I used an eletric knife to trim the crusts and cut the sandwiches and it gave them a very professional look.

I should have doubled the recipe for this. Everybody loved it. These are very refreshing and a good compliment to the more savory sandwiches without being sweet.

The mint was O.K., but I found that using Marie's Sour Cream & Dill Dressing was fabulous! That seemed to be the consensus after making 200 for a political fund raiser.

These sandwiches were gobbled up at a recent tea party. I doubled the recipe and had enough for about 13 or 14 guests.
