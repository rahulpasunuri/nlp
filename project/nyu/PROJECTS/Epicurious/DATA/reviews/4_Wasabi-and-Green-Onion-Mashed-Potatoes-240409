This is the recipe you are looking for if you want Wasabi Mashed Potatoes! I made half the recipe and used fresh wasabi paste from an upscale sushi market. Delicious in every way! Guests ate every last spoonful. If I had to do it again, I might substitute something less rich than whipping cream to see if it works as well. But definitely a keeper!

Very good but definitely needed more wasabi and onions than the recipe called for. Would make again.

Delicious! made it for a dinner party and got rave reviews. I used russet potatoes and wasabi powder that I made into paste. The wasabi flavor was too subtle so I added another tablespoon to some sour cream and added it. I also used half and half instead of whipping cream, it was plenty rich!

I really liked this recipe. I made two minor changes, however. First, I used soy milk instead of cream. Second, I roasted a medium sized garlic bulb, and added it to the milk and wasabi mixture.

Simply sublime! These potatoes have found their way onto many tables of my friends and family members. They are worth the extra work. I've seen picky toddlers devour a bowl in no time at all. Those intimidated by wasabi are usually concerned that they will overwhelm the potatoes, but I believe the combination of the wasabi and the green onions bring a lovely warm heat to the potatoes without killing off your taste buds.

this recipe came out delicious!! i paired this with miso marinated ahi tuna steaks (i had left over miso marinade from the baked black cod recipe) as well as Lee Wan Ching's Chinese Broccoli with Ginger Sauce. everything came out exceptionally well, was fairly easy & delicious in the wasabi potatoes i used wasabi (the kind you find at sushi restaurants). i like to really taste the wasabi in the mash so depending on your palette you may want to start out with less. i'd say i used about 2.5 tbs. i also substituted the whipping cream for about 3 heaping tbs. of sour cream & 1/4 cup of milk. i also whipped the potatoes with a hand blender instead of a using a masher. they came out silky smooth. i ommitted the sesame oil since it was on my fish but i also added fresh ground pepper & salt yum !! writing this review makes me want to remake last nights dinner my husband licked his plate clean and said that this would have been a $30 entree if we ate out at a restaurant

I was anxious to try and 4-fork recipe, my kids like food with a zip but we all agreed, this wasn't for us. It actually didn't even settle well in our stomach

this was a great recipe. i doubled the wasabi paste, which i think gave this the right amount of wasabi flavor; the 2 tablespoons was just not enough.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I used only 11/2tablespoons of wasabi. Held the poatoes for about 3/4 of an hour while guests ate apps and then salad, and then microwaved them to bring them back to temp. Don't be tempted to reduce the sesame oil. It imparts a great earthy flavour that can't be duplicated. Served with sweet chili glazed salmon and coriander and grilled asparagus. Heated the leftover potatoes the next day in the microwave and they were still good. A definite repeat that would marry well with beef, too.

This was a lovely recipe. I chose this recipe to serve along side grilled asian marinated tuna. It was a lovely compliment. After reading the reviews I did cut way down on the sesame oil. I also believe that some wasabi paste are stronger than others. So I started out with 1 tbsp and slowly added a bit more to my liking. The dinner turned out fabulous, and this recipe is now in my keeper file.

Tried using the wasabi powder method with unfavorable results. It didn't seem to mix well. Next time I won't make it unless I have the paste.

I recomend more wasabi or the sesame oil overpowers the flavor of the wasabi which still tastes great, but I wouldn't consider them just 'wasabi mashed potatoes', maybe 'asian mashed potatoes'.

I served these potatoes as a side dish with a couple steaks and they were a hit. I didn't alter the recipe at all.

Goes great with seared tuna. I'd go lighter on the seseme oil next time. I thought it tasted better when substituting half the whipping cream for sour cream to give it a little more tanginess.

Excellent ! Made with wasabi cream (in a tube) green onions and the mashed peas as suggested by someone else. This really was delicious. I made a green tea crusted chicken with baby bok choyonthe side garnishedwith a cremini & orange swirl- be hard pressed to find this in a restaurant for the cost of $25./2people including a fab gewurztraminer! Add own soft jazz, a few candles & wow! No tax either- the tips taken in romance!

Our daughter served these while we were visiting and they were very tasty and such a great change from the usual.

Delicious and very creamy. I would bump up the wasabi next time, but thought this was delicious, especially when paired with maple-soy glazed salmon and edamame.

This recipe was delicious. I served it with chicken but I think it would have been amazing w/ steak. I followed the recipe to a "t". If I were to make any changes, I may have used a little less wasabi as the taste is very strong.

This was great with the pan seared tuna. I used the powdered wasabi. I will make this again with any fish dish
