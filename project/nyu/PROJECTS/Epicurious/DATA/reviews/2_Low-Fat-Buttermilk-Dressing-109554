Ok this "dressing" is misleading. Unless buttermilk custard dressing is your thing, then I would say this is more of a buttermilk base. It works to thicken the sauce for The Buffalo Burger with Spicy Red Pepper Sauce" As a an actual dressing it is pretty repellent.

This goes excellent on the buffalo burgers that was linked to this recipe. After reading the reviews, I did cut the amount of lemon to only 1/2 tablespoon and added fresh snipped chives and rosemary to make up from the lost flavor from the lemon. Good but needs a bit more vamping to bring out the best in it.

I found the dressing smooth enough, but too lemony. I may have cooked it too long because it was much thicker than I expected. If I were seriously dieting, I would probably make this again. I detest commercially made low calorie dressing. In that context it was good. Better than commercial low calorie dressing.

Not good. The texture was off-putting and the taste was bland. It ruined a perfectly good potato salad. It was less than so-so.
