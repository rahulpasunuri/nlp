This is a marvelous potluck/party salad. Always gets raves.

Have made this recipe 4 times in the last 2 weeks! I must say that I marinate the feta with the olives, za'tar and lemon juice, marinating it for at least 8 hours. Then add this completely to the fresh ingredients.Everyone asks for the recipe.(I also included thinny sliced red onions.) I really don't like to change recipes before trying them as written but it was a matter of practibility.

The za'atar isn't underlined but if you click on it you get the recipe that was originally in the magazine. This recipe for za'atar is so good! It's better than the jumbo package I've bought before and easy to make too. I doubled the recipe as suggested and put it on pita brushed with olive oil and warmed in the oven yum. Ground sumac is available online from ethnicgrocer.com.

Wow, this recipe is really fussy for something that should be supremely simple. Here is a recipe I always make: cut tomatoes and cucumber into large, but bite size pieces. Slice some red onion and toss all veggies together. Dash on seasoned rice vinegar, olive oil, and salt and pepper. toss everything together with some crumbled feta. just eyeball amounts.

I agree with everyone else - this is a great salad. I wanted to prepare a middle eastern dinner for my book group and this went perfectly with the Iranian stew I served as the main course. I had no problem finding the za'atar - however I was surprised that I had to buy such a large quantity at one time. Everyone wanted the recipe so I shared the spice with them. I also used a high quality bulgarian feta which gave a real zip to the salad. I will definitely make this one again!

This recipe was good, but it made a huge salad. . . scale it WAY down if you only have a couple of people because the pita toasts are really soggy as leftovers. I'll probably try it again, but I certainly won't make this much.

We enjoyed this salad very much. Served with the 1st course Lemon - Garbanzo Soup and a lamb entree. A great combination; Will definitely make again when in the mood for middle eastern cuisine.

This was a delicious and substantial summer salad. I paired it with a chick pea salad and baba ghanoush. It would have perfect for a hot summer night except it was only 60 degrees in Seattle! I didn't marinate the olives, just used some brine cured ones and made a salad dressing of olive oil, lemon juice, and oregano. Couldn't find sumac anywhere and so I substituted cumin, tasted wonderful to me.

Great recipe! I was in a rush so I cheated and used some fabulous marinated olives form a local greek/middle eastern grocery. I think this would also work well with any flavorful marinated olives. Perfect for a hot summer day!

Just what I was looking for to complete a saturdaylunch. Everybody loved it and best of all even my lebanese friends complimented me. i also had the chickpea salad with parsley, lemon and sundried tomatoes, humus, baba ganousj and fried kibi. spectacular.
