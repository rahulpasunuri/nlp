I've made this dozens of times. Perfect dinner when my kids want pasta but I want salad. Make it when the market has great tomatoes and bunches of basil. Maybe a bit less garlic is the only thing I'd change.

Excellent fresh flavor with basil. Added grilled chicken pieces into the mix. Very tasty. Nice light meal.

Did anyone have trouble with the mozzarella turning stringy? Maybe it's because I used the shrink-wrapped mozz instead of the kind sitting in water?

Fabulous with garden-fresh heirloom tomatos. I added hot red pepper and red onions.

We have enjoyed this several times this summer. I usually grill a few veggies such as asparagus, peppers and sweet onions and toss these in at the end. I think this is better without the mozza mixed in and just allow people to add fresh parmesan or mozza to taste.

I've been making a variation of this dish for years with great results. I add about 1/2 cup of sliced green onions, a few tablespoons of capers and a little extra balsalmic. Also, I use all basil and mix it in with the tomato mixture in the beginning for more flavor.

We enjoyed this but next time I would add less garlic

I made this last night and although it was light and fresh, I thought it was a bit bland. It seemed to taste better the day after I prepared it -- maybe it's best to serve cold the next day? Overall, not something I'm ready to make again. My expectations were higher given everyone's reviews previously . . .

To lower the fat I made it without the cheese, still excellent.

This came out wonderful, and it was quite easy. I added toasted pine nuts and raw fava beans. A great summer dish!

This dish was easy. The Kalamata olives gave a nice bite to the soft flavors of the tomatoes and fusilli.

Excellent! I made early in day and let marinate for hours. I will put some capers in next time. Lots of extra garlic is needed.

I thought the flavor of this dish was wonderful. I doubled the whole recipe and then doubled the amount of olives yet again. I particularly liked the different tastes and textures of the mixed herbs. This was a hit at a company potluck.

I am making tonight, but how much of the chopped herbs?? 3/4 tbsp seems too little, and 3/4 cup seems a lot for 2 servings? Comment... altho I will just chop til it feels enough

I added more garlic (like money, you can never have too much!) and I used mint and parsley to balance it bite. I served it with a Pino Noir, which is a light enough red to complement the flavour. Excellent!

Fast, easy, and delicious. What more could you want out of a recipe? Definitely a keeper.

Have prepared this dish many times - it always turns out great. I'm making it tonight with some Nicoise olives, pasta, and fresh mozzarella that I brought back with me from a wonderful Italian shop on Arthur Ave. in the Bronx. I always add some mint, basil and oregano together with peppers and tomatoes fresh from my garden!!!

I've been making this since it first appeared in Gourmet - the perfect summer dinner!

My boyfriend made this with me. Neither of us are expert chefs, but we are brave. This was not only safe and easy (!), but it was so incredibly tasty. We, too, substituted the kalamata olives for regular black olives, and used gemelli pasta. I will probably make this a regular recipe to "un-cook" again very soon!

I have been craving this dish ever since I made it. I added some bocconcini and some freshly grated Grana Padano parmesan to it just before serving - fantastic!!!!! Would be great with some fresh Italian bread.

Its an easy to put together recipe. It works well with a spicy mean dish

This is a real keeper. It is easy and delicious. My idea of the perfect recipe. I will definitely make it again. My husband insists that that be soon. I was out of olives so I omitted them. This says it is 2 servings. We found that we had dinner and then lunch the next day for the 2 of us. We don't have small appetites, this just makes more than we could eat.

Tastes great and is very easy. Great for the summer. I did substitute regular black olives once and it turn out fine. I just cut them into fourth length-wise.

This recipe is a true mind relaxer after a long hard day at the office - take time to breathe it in as you chop. Roast the pepper and peel it, it brings out the pepper's taste. Peel and de-seed the tomatoes too, it will make the sauce less watery. Get creative with the herb mix, but always include basil and mint. I make this dish once a week now - it's one of my standards!

the perfect pasta dish! Easy to make and very tasty.

This is a delicious sauce. It could be served without the pasta as a chopped salad.
