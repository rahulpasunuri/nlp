I was looking for a potato salad recipe that had two key elements: roasted potatoes and no mayo. This recipe came up in my search. We tried it last night and it was soooo good!!! My kids asked for third helpings! They couldn't get enough! And I couldn't resist having the leftovers (which wasn't much) for breakfast. I added some chopped garlic to the potatoes during the last 20 minutes of roasting time and I did half red wine vin and half balsamic vin. It was perfect. We will be making this dish often!

As potatoes go, this is one of my favorite dishes. It's a great side dish with many types of recipes. The zing of the vinegar (which I used a bit more of) made it just a little more special then plain roasted potatoes. I also added a little garlic.

I have made this recipe a number of times. It is easy to make, can be changed to suit tastes and is a good "potato" salad for those who don't like Mayonnaise or those who are worried about having a potato salad that could be left out of the fridge a bit too long.

It was ok, but didn't notice much difference from plain roasted potatoes!

I liked the recipe is simple and easy to make, but I wish the next time to add a little bit of garlic in the vinaigrette.

Variations: I know I've changed it some, but I really like the changes and have made this weekly for 3 potlucks. Roasted bell peppers on top for color and crumbled fresh goat cheese or other feta type really adds to the salad. I've also roasted the potatoes with sage AND rosemary for a variation. For the dressing, I use only 2 1/2 TBS of balsamic, keep the oil count the same, use chives instead of shallots, and if I have a bulb of roasted garlic laying around I add that to the dressing, too.

This was simple and delicious. I will definitely make it again and again.

My wife and I brought this dish to a cookout. Less than a week later, we had some of the same people over to our house. When I asked my wife what we should make for a side, she told me that if we made anything in place of the potato salad, our guests would leave. Easy and good - don't skimp on the sage and get it crisp.

The vinegar seemed to overwhelm this dish. Even my 18-year-old son, who is always hungry, wouldn't finish his serving. It just couldn't stack up against a simple Marcella Hazan recipe I have been using for roasted new potatoes for years. To wit: cut potatoes into wedges or chunks, boil until barely tender, toss with oil, sprinkle with kosher salt and rosemary, and roast in hot oven until crisp. Heaven.

made this for a 4th of july picnic, and it disappeared. i was afraid the amount of sage might overwhelm the dish, but it was just right. a nice alternative to the mayo-based potato salad.

Good and easy. Potatoes were very flavorful even without vinaigrette - just salt and pepper and sage. Shallots in vinaigrette are very tasty. Could cut back on oil and add more vinegar to dressing and it would still be good.

This is a good dish, but I think it loses flavor if not served warm.

I absolutely love this salad recipe and have made it for many occassions. I love the fact that it contains no mayo, thus no worry on those warm summer days. This recipe is an abolute winner.

This is a fantastic and simple dish! I added a bit more shallots to the vinagrette, as everyone I was cooking for loves their garlicky taste. The roasted sage is wonderful.

I was concerned that the amount of sage would dominate the flavor of this dish, however the roasting process produced a beautiful nutty flavor. This salad was delicious and easy to make.
