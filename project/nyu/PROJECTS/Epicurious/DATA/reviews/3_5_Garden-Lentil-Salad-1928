I made this twice in one week with variations to the second go based on what onions and such I had on hand. Quick and easily to make with whatever you have on hand.

I played around with the recipe a little and just LOVED it! It was an easy, fast summer dinner ...I chopped fresh scallions instead of red onion (which uncooked is a little strong for me). Skipped the yellow pepper. I went a little skimpy on the feta, but it was all just wonderful. Served it with a salad with fresh corn, apples, grated carrots & a caeser style dressing, baba ganoush and toast. Food heaven!

Hearty, crunchy, flavorful salad. I left out the feta and it tasted great. I did not rinse beans after boiling in salted water, and I think the extra salt added to the flavor.

This was great and so easy to make. I didn't cook the pepper, I used less oil, and I left out the radishes, feta and eggs and it was still good.

The first time I made this salad, it was for a birthday bash for my mother, in which I decided to offer 6 different salads as the buffet luncheon. We had about 40 women, all ages, and this salad was the absolute favorite. Healthy, very "South Beach" with good carbs and tastes better made a day ahead. Since then, I have made numerous times, and it is always the first to go.

I was skeptical about capers and olives together, but it was great! i left out the eggs, but followed the rest using black lentils.

so, this recipe is great as is, but here are some changes i made that i think makes it exceptional. first i substitute cilantro for parsley (i hate parsley) i omit the olives and the eggs, and add 1 ear of corn straight off the cob (it doesn't need to be cooked) i also chop up a jalapeno pepper and add that. this recipe is better the next day after the flavors have a chance to really come out. my friends and family all love it. my pregnant friend says this is the only thing that keeps her regular (sorry to go there, but it's true) this is a great introductory to lentils if you're not used to using them. also, trader joe's has some pretty good pre cooked lentils in their refrigerated section, good when time is an issue.

Did not like. Made exact to recipe. Onion was much too strong for the dish and lentils were very mushy.

This is one of my favorite recipes on epicurious - quick, delicious and lasts for more than a week in the fridge without turning to mush. Perfect as a bring-from-home lunch. The one change I make is only using about half of the dressing.

Really quite yummy. I made this exactly according to the recipe and the combination of flavors was just about right. The only thing I did differently was to withold some of the dressing which turned out to be a good decision; about 2/3 of the dressing was plenty for the salad.

colourful and delicious...i used less oil and salted the lentils after cooking.

Delicious and a snap to make -- 20 minutes start to finish. I pack it for lunch at work -- a nutritious and tasty alternative to boring sandwiches.

Delicious salad. I left out the eggs as I don't like cold egg. I added a bit too much lemon juice which slightly marred the mild and creamy taste, but on the whole it was very nice, especially with the cherry tomatoes and radishes and fresh parsley.

This is a terrific salad; the olives, feta and egg are such a great flavor combination! Used half a large beef-steak tomato, slightly less red onion and radish, 1 1/2 C. lentils and MUCH LESS olive oil (maybe 4 Tbs.). Also used mixed Greek olives. Don't salt the lentils until AFTER they've cooked; that makes them tough. Served this for dinner, slightly warm. Would serve 4 small eaters as an entree salad.

This is one of the most refreshing and delicious salads I've ever made. I left out the feta cheese and used different olives, and I'm sure there are many variations that would be just as good.

very tasty- great for picnics. can be lightened easily by reducing oil or using a different dressing. Many requests for the recipe.

This was excellent, although it takes some lengthy preparation. I subatituted red wine vinegar for the lemon jce. from necessity and also added chopped roasted garlic, salt, and chili-garlic mustard to the sauce; and torn up baby spinach to the salad. I used twice as many tomatoes, olives, and radishes and half as much diet feta cheese. I also added a cup of cooked rice. I later thought that adding pine nuts would have been good, too.
