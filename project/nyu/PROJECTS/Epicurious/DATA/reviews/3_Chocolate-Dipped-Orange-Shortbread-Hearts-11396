Tasty but greasy and very crisp. They spread a lot while in the oven, so that they looked more like blobs than hearts.

I think these cookies are very boring and lack any real appeal. I would not make them again, but I would suggest to anyone trying the recipe to use way more orange juice. I think that they would be better with more of an orange flavor, or any flavor.

I loved these and so did everyone else who had them. I will definately make them again. I spread the melted chocolate onto the cookies with the back of a teaspoon though. That made it easier and less messy.

I haven't made this yet, so I am not rating it. Some people had a problem with the chocolate melting. The recipe does not call for the chocolate to be tempered and if it is not properly tempered real chocolate will melt at a low temperature or it will bloom (a white top will eventually form on the chocolate). Tempering is a bit complicated and probably not necessary for this recipe,especially if you are eating the cookies right away. On reviewer suggested using chocolate coating and that would hardend and stay hardened, but definitely lacks that great chocolate taste.

I used this recipe for Valentine cookie bouquets. I tripled the recipe and it worked really well. I was asked for the recipe by more than one person. I would definately make it again.

I used a small paint brush for the chocolate. I also, brushed on edible gold paint to give it a more festive look. I sent them to school for a valentine's party, parents and teachers requested the recipe.

Storing the dipped cookies in an air-tight container for a day or more before serving really helped the orange and chocolate scents to mature. I made these over the holidays and it was a hit with my nephews. You may want to cut down the amount of sugar used on the type of chocolate you use.

Fabulous -- looking and tasting! What a delightful treat to give my friends on Valentine's Day last year. I'll be making them this year, too. When I came to the chocolate part, I didn't even try dipping them. Instead, I took a basting brush and painted one half of a front while they sat. Very easy, and it made an interesting, streaked appearance. How can anyone let one melt? They didn't last that long in anyone's hands! Yum.

I had great hopes for this, but my attempt fell flat. The dough was exactly as the last reviewer said, too fragile and a bit salty. the cookies cut out ok, but "melted" and spread all over the cookie sheet while in the oven. They had no shape left at the end, and were a horrible greasy consistency. As other people have loved this recipe I can only think that I must've done something wrong (should I not have used parchement paper with these)? But out of the dozen new cookie recipes I've tried this holiday season (literally...all new this year, and I've been baking like mad to get the cookie plates out to people early), this is the only one that failed on me. Too bad, I really liked the idea.

i just finished making these, and while i think it's a pretty good recipe, there are some things that i think need to be adjusted to really make them stand-out. the main thing is -- the amount of salt in the dough seems to be too much. i can clearly taste the salt when i bite into the cookie. the chocolate tempers it, but it's still a much saltier taste than i think a cookie should have. i would reduce it to 1/4 or 1/2 tsp. also, when i tried to roll out the chilled dough, it completely fell apart. i had to wait for it to warm up again and roll it back together. it probably needs only about 15 minutes' chilling in the fridge. also, i rolled out the dough more thinly than the recipe called for, and they kept their shape, and the balance of cookie to chocolate was still good. (i made stars and circles, baked for 8-9 min). perhaps scoring, but not cutting, the dough, baking it and breaking it apart afterwards would keep the shape nicely (tho you'd have to make rectangles/squares). finally, and this isn't necessary, but the results are yummy -- i dipped the cookies in both white and dark chocolate. i got the idea from my favorite cookie ever, a diamond-shaped shortbread dipped in white and black chocolate they make at one of my favorite cafes here in boston. it was fun to overlap the chocolate to create cool patterns (i dipped in white first, then black). in regards to chocolate melting easily: if you use the chocolate chips that are sold specifically for candy melting, they harden completely at room temperature -- no refrigeration needed. i couldn't find any that was bittersweet, though, and their quality i think is a bit questionable. all in all, this is a great recipe to start from and do your own thing! :-)

Just made these last night as a Valentine's day treat. The recipe was super simple and the cookie dough came out with a nice consistency. Dipping the cookies wasn't that hard but it's true the chocolate melts on one's fingers -- you just have to hold them by the un-dipped half. My boyfriend doesn't normally like the citrus/chocolate combo, though, and he dug these. Yum! I would double the recipe and make 2 batches next time.

These cookies were quite good, but the chocolate dipping was pretty difficult to keep clean and elegant. Most of my cookies ended up looking pretty sloppy (like an earlier reviewer, only about half of my cookies held their shape), and the chocolate melted on my guests' fingers during eating. Perhaps a better quality chocolate would have helped this? I also was cooking these in large quantity, which could have led to some of the inconsistency in shape-holding. Messiness and aesthetics aside, though, the cookies tasted good.

This was a great tasting cookie especially if you like chocolate. I made these for Christmas and used a star cookie cutter instead of a heart. I also streaked white chocolate on them at the end and they looked great.

I made these cookies for a Christmas cookie exchange a couple years ago. They were fabulous! Although there was extra work involved, for a special occasion they were worth it. Our cookie exchange group always tries to outdo one another with both the recipe and the packaging and I came off very well that year!

Cookies taste great but the dough didn't hold the heart shape during baking.
