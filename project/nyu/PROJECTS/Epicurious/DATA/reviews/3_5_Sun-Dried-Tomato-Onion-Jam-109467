I found this recipe too sweet and, as one reviewer suggested, would cut the sugar in half and double the vinegar if I make it again.

This jam is absolutely delicious. We have eaten it with chicken, pork, lamb, by itself on a crostini, and in a panini with prosciutto and goat cheese. Don't change a thing in this recipe, you'll love it!

sooo tasty! will definitely cut the sugar a little next time. served it atop the chile corn custard squares (recipe also on this site) with a gazpacho on the side. would have gladly eaten the entire batch that night.

To update from my last review: I made this again, but this time halved the suger, doubled the vinegar, and used 1 cup chopped fresh tomato instead of 1/4 cup apricots. It was wonderful, and requested by several people at the picnic I brought it to. Really good, true tomato flavor, and not too sweet this time.

This was good, however the apricots really made it quite sweet and obscured the flavor of the tomatoes. Without the apricots, this would have gotten 4 forks from me. Next time I will omit them.

Delicious! Great sweet/sour tang. I served it with pan-sauteed ostrich filets, and garnished with goat cheese and pink peppercorns. Yum...

Personally, I think tomato jam tastes great with all cheeses, but it does go especially well with goat cheese, either fresh or aged. The sweetness balances the sharp tang.

Great as an appetiser on crostini.

If you had served this with a cheese, which cheese would it be? A chevre? Good cream cheese?

Brought to a foodie gathering...It was intended to serve with pork roast. It was "tasted" upon my arrival and was soon part of the appetizer part of the evening! RAVE reviews

Really delicious and easy to make. I served it over salmon, but I think it would be even better with pork.

This is delicious, warm with crackers or just about anything, but I did cut down on the sugar.

Looking for something to go with leftover pork roast I tried this relish. Absolutely delicious. Sweet, tart, spicy. It will go well on sandwiches, if there is any left tomorrow.
