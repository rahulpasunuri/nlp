This cornbread was good but nothing to write home about. I'll probably move on to a different recipe next time.

My go-to recipe...I always use 1/2 cup sugar...I'm moving and packed my loaf pan so I used an 8x8 so only 25 or so min

This was quick and easy to make and came out really well. Made it to use in the Herb & Bacon Cornbread stuffing (this site) but also had some leftover just to eat and it was wonderful.

This recipe made delicious cornbread--very moist and not too dense. My family devoured it. I used fine cornmeal as well, but as I was short on time, I did not let it sit for more than 20 minutes. I think the recipe's use of buttermilk is what really makes the cornbread so moist, and what separates this recipe from the average cornbread recipe. I will definitely be using this recipe from now on!

Fantastic cornbread recipe... I used fine cornmeal, 3/4 cup of all purpose flour, 1/4 cup corn flour and let it rest in the pan as some reviewers suggested. The result was a fine- grained cake-like texture, extremely moist.

I made 4 loaves of this cornbread from a community event, and people loved this and kept coming back for more. For some loaves I used 2% lowfat buttermilk, and for others regular fat buttermilk. The lowfat buttermilk was less viscous, and seemed to create a lighter batter, which rose slightly more than the loaves made with regular buttermilk. Both versions were delicious.

I made this to use in a stuffing and it was wonderful. Moist, dense and delicious. I, too, let it rest in the baking pan. It was difficult not to eat it all before making the stuffing!

I use this recipe for the Cornbread Stuffing with Fresh and Dried Fruit recipe on Epicurious. The second time I used it I left out the sugar as the cornbread was too sweet in the stuffing we thought. It is an easy and good cornbread, dense with nice moisture and flavor. Making it in advance and wrapping in foil works great and may even improve the flavor and consistency. I made it in an Emile Henry ceramic loaf pan. The stuffing, by the way, is fantastic!

Made this twice in an 8x8 pan (approx. 25 minutes cooking time): The first time I made it exactly according to the recipe (with half the sugar). The bread came out dense and savory. The flavor was okay, but messing with the batter after letting it rest deflated the baking powder's leavening. The second time, I used the full amount of sugar and scraped the batter directly into the pan before letting it rest. This loaf came out perfect: fluffy, not crumbly but not fully cakey, and the sweetness was just the right undertone and not overwhelming. This is now my favorite cornbread recipe. Make sure to scrape the batter into the pan before letting it rest and you'll have a magical loaf of cornbread!

My family liked this cornbread very much. I only put 1 tsp. sugar in it. It was not heavy or greasy and remained tasty 2 days after baking.

Glad you all liked it. I didn't. A mix would have been better. Perhaps it was my cornmeal.

Loved this recipe! Much better than my old Joy of Cooking recipe. Made as instructed with prob 15" of "soaking" time. Was afraid that the suggested 8x8 pan size would make the finished cornbread height too shallow while the prescribed loaf pan size, too high. So, I altered the 8x8 pan size by adding a foil-lined segment (filled with dry, uncooked rice--or beans) at one end of the pan to make a 8x6 sized pan--hope that description makes sense--got the idea from "blind baking", as in a pie crust. Baked 22-23 mins. Just the perfect 2" height! RAVE reviews: tender, cake-like, perfect amt of sweetness. This is a keeper!

This recipe turned out fluffy, buttery (of course) and delicious! At the advice of a previous reviewer, we poured the cornbread into the pan before letting rest for 30 minutes. It turned out light and fluffy using this method. The pan we used was 8x8 instead of a loaf pan, and so cook time was cut in half to 20 minutes. The bread has a great buttermilk flavor and was perfect with a bit of honey paired with sauteed collared greens and black eyed peas!

Very tasty. Definitely try this one. We have eaten it right from the pan, and I have also used in dressing/stuffing recipes. I would like to omit the sugar but as a compromise in our family I add only half the sugar. Eight-inch square pan works great.

Great cornbread recipe. Appropriately named, for it`s very buttery, moist and delicious! I cut the sugar in half because we don`t like our cornbread too sweet and I always add a dash or 2 of cayenne to give it a little kick.

This is superb cornbread. I served this for a big group with slow-cooked chili -- not a crumb or a drop left. Keep this and make it often!

Definitely decent cornbread. It was more dense and subtle than fluffy and sweet. I would bake it maybe 5 minutes less, and eat it with chili or something equally hearty.

Rating: 2
Great flavor, but it came out too dense. Seems like the fix is obvious enough: Let something with baking powder sit for half an hour, then move it, then bake it? Instead, turn the batter into the dish as soon as you mix it. I'm sure it would have been fluffier.

Haha, I love when people say DO NOT MAKE! for whatever reason on recipe reviews when 99% of the other reviewers had great success. Something went wrong! Try again! Seriously though, this is delicious. Bon Appetit has not let me down yet.

In spite of the amzing amount of butter not recommended for our health, this is really delicious. For a lighter version which is just about as good, try "Delicious Corn Bread" from "Moosewood Cookbook", which has practically the same ingredients except it has honey for the sugar and only 3 Tbs. of butter. Even though my toothpick came clean, or so it seemed, it was not fully baked and I had to return it to the oven after I had sliced it once. Again, Moosewood's calls for an 8-in aquare pan, which I will try for this next time. I highly recommend this bread!

really good....i substituted some yogurt for the extra egg yolk and some of the butter. i made buttermilk by adding a little lemon juice to 2% milk and shaking it up. i also increased the sugar a bit. turned out great, i like the fact that it calls for a loaf pan.

This recipe won the cornbread contest at our neighborhood halloween party in GA. I followed the recipe exactly. I am a northern transplant and like a little more sweet in my cornbread, but my southern friends loved it. I wouldn't change the recipe, but maybe will serve it next time with a honey butter for sweet-tooths like me.

I thought this was great, it worked out perfectly and I loved that it was a loaf. Will definitely make again.

I made this for my housing co-op cleanup day, and it was amazing how many people - at least 30 - came up to me and commented on how delicious the cornbread was. I used regular grind cornmeal, as I couldn't find stoneground in my Safeway, and it was fine. I added 1/2 cup of fresh chopped chives from my garden, and they were delicious. It was rich and very buttery tasting. It was stale by the end of the afternoon, however, so this is something I will plan to serve almost straight out of the oven.

Baked this Monday to go with black bean soup. Used the Red Mill medium grind comrmeal, and it turned out very well in the loaf pan, which is why I wanted to give it a try. Had only made cornbread in an 8 x 8 glass pan. Today we finished it, and it tasted as fresh as when made. Terrific texture when sliced.

Very easy. I cooked it in a cast iron cornbread skillet which made serving size portions. Ona few I topped with hot peppers.

I put exceptional because I was on a bout of bad cornbread recipes. The last one, my husband took a bite and asked if he had to swallow it. This was so good and simple and came out exactly how I wanted. The only thing I changed was the sugar to 1/2 c. because I like a sweeter cornbread. And I let the bread rest in the baking pan so I could get the dishes out of the way. I have made this twice in the last two weeks!

Great recipe. Decadent feeling. I subbed plain greek yoghurt for half the butter and it was still light and buttery. I also subbed half greek yoghurt and half non fat milk for the buttermilk and ditto, buttery, almost greasy (but not too oily). You'd never guess it was lightened.

Amazing, best cornbread I've had -anywhere! It was delicious, and I followed it faithfully. So soft and yummy, not heavy at all. Will make again and again.

This is delicious and very easy!!! I followed the recipe exactly as written (except I used a 8x8 glass pan) and was very pleased with the results. I didn't find the bread too sweet nor did I think it was dry - just buttery and delicious. The bread went perfectly with the "full of beans chili" (also on this site) and was perfect way to chase away the cold weather and the bad news!

After reading the other reviews, I decided to make this for a post Trick or Treating chili party. Everyone loved the cornbread - even the children. I found it easy to assemble. Because of time constraints, it was left to rest for only 10 minutes. The results were fine. I would recommend for a basic no-frills cornbread.

I followed the directions exactly and ended up with a slightly dry bread... it wasn't buttery at all. I also didn't think it was sweet enough... next time I will double the sugar and possibly add more butter. It is a decent base recipe that could use a bit more work.

I've been looking for a long time for the "perfect" cornbread and for us this one is it. It is so moist and not too sweet. Delicious. I usually make in an 8 x 8 glass pan.

It doesn't get much easer than this cornbread. The result is just what it says, buttery and delicious. Don't skip the 30 minute absorption time. It allows the batter to produce a final crumb that is fluffy and soft instead of dense and gritty. I added fresh raw corn sliced off of two ears. Yum!

Recipe is improved by halving the amount of sugar making it suitable for both sweet toppings (eg jam) and savoury dishes. I made it with ordinary flour and New Zealand buttermilk and it didnt need to rest. Delicious eaten straightaway. Toast after second day.

Excellent cornbread recipe. I doubled this for cornbread dressing, and it's almost too good not to eat on it's own!
