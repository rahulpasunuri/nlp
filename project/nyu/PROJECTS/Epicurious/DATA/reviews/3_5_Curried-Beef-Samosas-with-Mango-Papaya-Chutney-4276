I would like to make these samosas tomorrow evening. Can anyone tell me how long to bake them if using phyllo pastry? Thanks!

I would try to tweak it more. I did use garam masala, added peas, potato cubes, crushed red pepper & a dash of chili oil, salt & sugar, but it still needs "something." As it is dry, it does need the chutney to "go with." I used egg roll wrappers. They turned out nice & crispy/crunchy.

We loved this!! The taste was very good and the recipe had multiple uses. We used eggroll wrappers b/c they made bigger samosas (less work making them), added frozen peas and made pastry shells (for icecream) with the leftover eggroll wrappers.

Make sure you use a good, complex garam masala as your curry powder and these will not be bland. I did not use the mango-papaya chutney but a fresh mint-and-cilantro chutney instead -- a lighter, fresher accompaniment to the beef, IMHO.

My sister-in-law from India uses taco size tortillas when she is too busy to make dough for samosas. Slice them in half, roll into a cone (seal edge with flour/water paste) then fill and flatten the top edges together (seal again with flour/water paste) - works great!

Nice one! Did cheat and used puff pastry. The ground beef still tasted a bit bland after adding just the curry, so added kurkuma (tumeric?) and ground koriander as well. Also I simmered the chutney for twice the amount of time.

What about using pie crust instead of won ton papers?

This recipe turned out perfect! I served it as the main dish on a bed of rice noodles with some kim chee.

Found this recipe to be easy to make and very good as a main dish. I served it with cucumber salad and curried rice. My guests were very impressed.

As an Indian who grew up eating beef samosas very similar to these (except my mom eventually started cheating and used puff pastry), I would advise SF not to make blanket statements about other cultures. Many Indians (and Bengalis and Pakistanis) are not Hindu and thus eat lots of beef. (for the person who asked, with the puff pastry, you bake the samosas instead of frying)

This was a simple recipe that everyone loved. There were none left! The wonton skins were a convenient shortcut and the chutney added a nice balance to the savoriness of the curry.

When you substitute the puff pastry for the wonton wrappers, do you fry it as well or bake it?

I love this recipe with the additions suggested by the other readers (orange juice and currents). I make it for a main course dish, and instead of wonton wrappers, I use Pepperidge Farms Puff Pastry sheets, and make it larger. The chutney is so wonderful and spicy, I also make it to go on chicken.

I found this dish to be very satisying with more of a West Indies slant than an East Indian take. I also added currants and a few dried cranberries as well to add some punch.

I think this is a stupid recipe in that most Indians would never eat beef. I've actualy been to Beetlenut and it is a very strange resturaunt. Everything there says, "And guesse what, no cheese".

Excellent recipe, and went over very well with the party crowd. Will be making it again next weekend. I added currants and more curry and sauteed the beef with some orange juice concentrate to plump up the flavour of the samosas themselves (if you aren't dipping them, they could be a little bland!) Finished samosas freeze well -- just reheat in a 350 degree oven for 15 mins or so. Enjoy!
