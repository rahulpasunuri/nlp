My husband and I both loved this recipe. He rated it 10 out of 10. This was my first experience using fresh fennel. I used a cast iron stove top grill pan. After 2 minutes on each side the tuna steaks were not done enough, and my kitchen was getting pretty smoky, so I stuck the grill pan in my already 375 preheated oven and roasted them for approx. 5 more minutes. That made my husband's steak (approx 1 in. thick) medium and my slightly thinner one (approx. 3/4 in. thick) medium well which is exactly how we wanted them. The rub of peppercorns and fennel seeds was very flavorful but not overpowering. I prepared the recipe exactly as is. The only change I would make next time: I would probably omit the lemon juice or cut it in half. I thought it wasnt needed. The sauteed fennel bulb was delicious in it's natural state and I thought the lemon altered it unnecessarily. It would be great to make on the outdoor grill too. I sliced my left over tuna steak and it will go on a salad for tomorrow's lunch. My husband had no leftovers!

This was a quick and delicious tuna dish. I used a counter top grill for the fish, and substituted roasted red pepper for the fresh. It had a lovely lemony taste.

The fish was great - I really liked the spice coating and would use it again without the vegetables. I wasn't wild about the appearance of it - had hoped it would be more attractive on the plate. Obviously, looks aren't a deal breaker, I'd still make it, but probably not for a dinner party.

I loved this tuna dish! It was very light and the fennel taste was wonderful with the fish. I would definitely make it again. I served it with a salad, risotto and fresh grated parmesan cheese - it made a perfect meal.

Not bad - quite different from how we usually eat tuna. I liked it and would make it again.

I replaced the fennel seed with sesame and preferred it. Served with a gorgonzola risotto it was splendid

This was a quick and easy dish to make. The use of red peppers gave colour. I actually marinated the tuna in red wine, together with some garlic, fennel fronds and stalks and crushed pepper corns and fennel seeds. This tenderised the tuna thus it was succulent to eat.
