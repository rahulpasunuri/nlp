I made this for my husband and I - good but nothing special. I used low sodium chicken broth and lite sour cream. Too thick.

Delicious and it would have been great even without the sour cream. I think next tme I will serve the cream as a generous dollop on top so that it will be a low cal recipe. My garden club raved.

This was so easy to make and such a refreshing delicious starter for a summer meal. Even for a picnic. I cut the recipe in half and used vegetable broth instead of chicken so I could share it with my vegetarian friends.

I made this soup with fire roasted red bell peppers instead of the yellow peppers. Really, really excellent. Fire roasting brings out a superb flavor you wouldn't get otherwise. I tasted it while still hot and it works well that way as well as chilled. This will be a favorite to serve guests from now on!

This is a 4 for ease of preparation, can be made in advance and never ceases to impress. I have played with adding different fresh herbs and that works well. I also have done two batches using different color peppers - makes a beautiful presentation.

Wonderful recipe. I took the previous reviewer's suggestion and used creme fraiche. Made it for four persons by cutting everything to 1/3. (That's 4 or 5 peppers.)

This is a wonderfully refreshing first course. Be sure to make the day before you plan to serve, as the flavors really blend overnight. I used some red peppers (per the previous reviewer's suggestion) separately and then swirled in with the yellow peppers for color. Very impressive and tasty. One caveat - sour cream is TOO THICK for this chilled soup....I think creme fraiche would be much better.

I have made this a number of times and everybody loves it!!. I sometimes make it with red and yellow peppers (separately) and swirl the two together when I serve it. It's very impressive.
