Incredible -- a smash hit at my dinner party for 18. Not a morsel left.

I loved this salad. I thought it looked gorgeous on the plate - the dressing is deep purple/red with the oranges and the cheese...I thought it was absolutely perfect as-is.

I made it just as printed and it looked a little too white, so I added some pomegranite seeds and it made the world of difference. I also salted the fennel the second time I made it and it was even better. I love this recipe

I added 1 tbsp red wine vinegar to the dressing. Very tasty but a bit dull to look at on the plate.
