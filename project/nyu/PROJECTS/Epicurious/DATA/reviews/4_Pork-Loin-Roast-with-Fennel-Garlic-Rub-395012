I love the combo of fennel and pork so I thought I'd give this a try. Made exactly as written except I used a boneless roast and I lowered the cooking temperature like some other reviewers. The pork was excellent and it smelled amazing.

This was delicious! Used a boneless loin roast, about 2 lbs. and cooked it at 325. Only I used the Pinot Noir instead of the white wine. I thought it would go better with the pork. :) Will make it again.

I figured I was taking a risk by making a dish that had so few ratings, but I think it was worth a shot. The pork was tender and moist, however the rub was a bit overpowering. When mixed with bites of roasted brussel sprouts and garlic mashed potatoes the pork was great, but like I said it was too much on its own. I did make a few changes to the recipe - I put in 1.5 cups of wine and 1.5 cups of water because my family typically likes extra sauce; I also thickened the sauce with flour and added milk to it while over the stove to make it more of a gravy. Both changes worked well. I'm not sure I'd make this again because there are other, better recipes on this site, but it was worth a try - especially if you love fennel and garlic.

Made this over the weekend, I got a 5# roast, the flavors were fabulous. I did get without the bone. I also put into a 325 degree oven. I feel pork should be cooked slower. It took approx 2 hours the sauce on the side was a nice touch. I will defintely make this again.

This is delicious. We made it with a much smaller roast (1 1/2 pound boneless center cut) and just kept it in the oven for less time. Tested with meat thermometer and took it out at 140, after 40 minutes or so. We put the garlic fennel rub on about 5 hours before roasting, and I think that helped a LOT -- the flavors were wonderful. We had it with regular mashed potatoes and green beans tossed with a little dark sesame oil, a little asian chili paste and toasted sesame seeds - nice combo with the pork. This recipe is definitely a keeper - very easy and turns out great.
