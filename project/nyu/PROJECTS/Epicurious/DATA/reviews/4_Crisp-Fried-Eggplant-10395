This was wonderful. I made a few modifications. I salted the eggplant first to eliminate some of its moisture. I also used Panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs. Lastly, I used a deep fryer set to 325 degrees and fried the eggplant for about 3 minutes per side. The key to this recipe is the lemon! Squeezing the lemon onto the warm eggplant makes it taste DELICIOUS!

Really good, agree with other reviewers that the crunch and texture were great. A little disappointed that the eggplant didn't have more flavor-- definitely sprinkle salt and lemon at the end while they are still hot from the pan. Will make again, maybe with a dip next time.

Great way to fry eggplant! I like cornmeal in mine, so I used all cornmeal in place of the bread crumbs. Next time I'll use half cornmeal, half flour.

Very good way to enjoy eggplant, even for those who don't care for eggplant. It's like eating chips! These even stay crispy the next couple days if you warm them up in a toaster oven or a warm oven instead of microwaving.

I used a hearty wheat bread for the crumbs, and added just a teaspoon of cajun seasoning for flavor. They were so good even my 3 year old neighbor loved them!

What a genius technique! The use of cpornstarch produces such an incredible crisp crust. The only tweaking I did was to double the recipe, salt/drain/dry the eggplant ahead & season my breadcrumbs. This will be the only way I'll fry eggplant from now on.

Used Italian seasoned panko instead of the bread crumbs, and then oven fried the slices at 425 degrees. Made a chipotle mayo dipping sauce. They were fabulous ! The cornstarch is the key to extra-crispiness.

Awesome Receipe, even my kids loved this. I made a couple of changes out of necessity. I was out of bread crumbs, so I made fresh cracker crumbs with Ritz Crackers. I also like a little zing to my food, so I added 1 tsp of Mrs Dash (Southwest Chipolte style) seasoning to the crackers. I also added a dash of Frank's Red Hot to the beaten egg and skipped the salt. I served this with some fresh Holendase sauce and they were scrumptous.

So good! I have always had problems with breading, until this recipe. The breading stayed on and was crisp, and absorbed very little oil. We had these in sandwiches with goat cheese -- absolutely delicious.

hunting4veggie, Is it possible that you did not allow the eggplant to sit long enough with the salt on it. I salt them and place a layer of paper towels over the slices. On top of which, I place a baking sheet and something to weigh it down. I am not sure if you know, but the point of the salt is to allow the liquid in the eggplant to drain. The liquid is the main source of any bitterness. I hope this helps. Maybe you will give it one more try?

It is a rather simple recipe but to make it worth a million, serve it with some home made Hollandaise sauce. It compliments the taste. Also try having it with some freshly cooked garlic rice.

We made this with a Rosa Bianca Eggplant (Italian Heirloom) from a local farmstand. The recipe was very good. I'd never fried veggies with the corn starch step before. It made it very crispy. I'd like to try this same recipe with zucchini.

Absolutely perfect when made according to directions. Thank you.

Easy and excellent! I also agree with the rate from Harrington Park NJ that I have never made eggplant that tastes like shoe leather. I can't imagine what you did incorrectly. Also, I did not salt it to remove the bitterness. I found fresh garden eggplant does not taste bitter. I would only do this step if I bought store eggplant.

I have never made eggplant that tastes like shoe leather. Perhaps rather than your critique of your recipe, you need to find out a basic method of cooking eggplant, as it is not the easiet vegetable to make. However, it's usual problem is that it is too greasy unless cooked properly, because it is like a sponge...... This recipe is delicious. I have made it a number of times. Also try the eggplant recipe with fresh mint, honey and sesame seeds. I make them both, everybody needs variety in their lives!

That IS SO NOT FAIR; I TRIED TO BE FAIR AND JUST BY NOT RATING THIS RECIPE AND IT AUTOMATICALLY GAVE FOUR FORKS. No, I would NOT make this recipe again. Plus, I am giving it ONE fork: and it hardly deserves even one fork

I have always had a problem with eggplant. Last time (before I tried this recipe) it turned out like a leather shoe. I followed one person's adviceand sprinkled salt on the eggplant to get rid of the supposed bitter taste. No one said how much salt to sprinkle on - so I generously coated the eggplant. I washed and dried it and proceded as the recipe said. It was so gross and bitter (salty - salt is bitter) that I spit out the first mouthful. Plus it tasted like fish (?) which is bizarre because I never cook fish or meat (or almost never-the last time I cooked any kind of meat wasn't in my appartment anyway). In a free country I would give this one fork, but the salt was kind of my fault, so to be fair I'll not rate it.

Have made this twice. Used progresso dried seasoned bread crumbs and it came out fine. We love it plain and w/ marinara sauce. It's great comfort food.

To get rid of eggplant's bitter taste, sprinkle both sides of each slice with salt and let sit for 20 minutes until you see moisture beading on the slices. This is the stuff that gives it its bitter taste. Then rinse the eggplant well and dry it, and proceed with the recipe. I've not made this particular recipe but the grape jelly suggestion made me feel I needed to perform a community service and post this (no offense to granny).

Rating: 4
This makes a deliciously crisp coating. But eggplant has a bit of a bitter taste naturally. This sounds awful, but my mother-in-law has always served fried eggplant with a bit of grape jelly. We tried this recipe with just the salt and lemon, and then with a dap of jelly. It was much better with the jelly. You don't actually taste the jelly but it takes away the bitter taste of the eggplant. I suspect that it would work with any jelly.

I used zucchini in place of the eggplant, as we had so much of it from our garden. It was delicious. The cornstrach really does make a difference getting the breading to adhere.

This is by far the best fried eggplant ever! So crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside! It fries up beautifuly without any of the breading falling off. I'm making it today and freezing it for Christmas Eve. I serve it as an appy with my delicious marinara sauce on the side. Try to use the small Italian eggplants. Less seeds and less bitter. It's hard not to eat them as there coming out of the pan

I've been making fried eggplant forever; and my mother-in-law made it forever and ever. We've always made it with cracker meal, and that's what I used this time. The big difference is the corn starch! It makes the egg "stick" so much better. A great improvement in an old and good recipe!

This recipe is great. Very crispy and light. I used home-grown Japanese eggplant cut length-wise. No need to salt and let sit. Also used Panko (japanese breadcrumbs).

This recipe was okay, but I've always preferred my mother's recipie for frying eggplant. The cornstarch is unnecessary. Just whisk an egg or two with some salt, and combine breadcrumbs with salt, pepper, and a generous dash of nutmeg. The nutmeg, I think, is essential in removing any bitterness and just seems to enhance the flavor of the eggplant. I'm not sure if this is a Southern touch or not, as I have seen some people (in the South) use sugar instead of nutmeg. Also, I use olive oil for the frying part, which is a tad healthier.

My family enjoyed this tremendously. I used panko bread crumbs and they worked just fine. Next time, I will be sure to cut the eggplant a full 1/4 inch or even a little thicker as my thinner pieces were a little mushy on the inside and felt more like an excuse to eat fried bread crumbs and less like eggplant!

Rating: 4
FANTASTIC!!! We are not all huge fans of Eggplant, but this will win over anyone and it did. We loved it. I prepped the eggplant about 1 hour in advance and it turned out perfect & crispy. I used fresh breadcrumbs and would not use Progresso with this recipe. I love Progresso breadcrumbs, but I think they'd overpower in this recipe. Just a tip :)

With a name like mine you would think I would know everything there was to do to with eggplant but this is by far the best fried eggplant I have ever made!!!!

I can't wait for the next holiday to make this for our entire family!!

Let me add my voice to the chorus of those who said this is the BEST FRIED EGGPLANT IN THE KNOWN UNIVERSE!!! Fast, ultra-easy, and so great that my seven-year-old granddaughter was on her third slice before she even asked what it was. I sprinkled on some freshly-grated Parm, and with the lemon wedges to squeeze, it was the ultimate happy-hour snack.

This dish is wonderful. I didn't have fresh bread crumbs. I used Progresso Italian bread crumbs and added some parmasen cheese. It was wonderful - the best dish on the table. I did draw the water out of the eggplant before I coated it - I was surprised that wasn't a part of this recipe (maybe it's not necessary). I'll definitely make it again.

As so many others have said, this recipe is truly excellent! I only have one picky eater in my brood. He didn't realize what it was, so I waited until he scarfed down the second bite and was eagerly going for the third before I gently broke the news to him. He very sheepishly replied that maybe he'd be willing to try my Eggplant Parmesan next time if it tasted as good as this stuff. :) The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars, despite the fact that it tastes fab and is simple enough for a 12-year-old to handle, is that it's very messy and time-consuming. Not a company dish, for sure, but a wonderful 'side' for a family dinner!

I made this recipe last weekend and it was absolutely delicious! Very crispy outside with a nice creamy inside. The cornstarch is definitely the key ingredient here. If you use flour, it will separate while cooking. I fried it in grapeseed oil. If you have never used this oil, give it a try. It is wonderful. It can be heated at a high temperature without smoking and DOES NOT impart any flavor to what you are cooking, if this is what you want. Make sure it is hot before cooking the eggplant. Not greasy or oily tasting at all. This is the only way I'll ever make fried eggplant again!!

I will never use any other fried eggplant recipe..not ever!! This has got to be the best...Ive loved eggplant since forever...when I was a girl..my mother used to fry it...and even though it was good..it was always soggy and greasy..these were crispy non-greasy rounds..loved it...I made a quick marinara using some canned crused tomatoes..bit of tomato paste...brown sugar.. and some other seasonings...and layered it with some mozzerella...terrific is all I can say....im going to make some more on Friday...but this time im just going to eat it as is..right out of the fryer...delish!

One word: DELICIOUS! After frying them, I laid them on some tomato pasta sauce, sprinkled with chopped basil and laid provolone cheese on top.

Oh this was my very first time making eggplant, I wanted to try something new, so I came here. This recipe was so easy to make, and absolutely delicious!

This is the best fried eggplant dish we've ever had, and so simple! The cornstarch must be the secret. I didn't have to presalt the eggplant or anything. I'll try sprinkling a little Parmigiana Reggiana on the slices when they're cooked next time. And the bread crumbs -- how about made from leftover herb breads? The variations are endless. Lots of experimentation to be enjoyed with such an excellent basic! I'm going to try this method for fried underripe or green tomatoes as well.

I think the cornstarch is an important factor in retaining the crispness of the eggplant - good idea! As I generally do with eggplant, I salted the slices, weighted them down to disperse some of the liquid, and then after half an hour, rinsed them in water and squeezed them dry in a kitchen towel. This may be unnecessary, but I think it helps to eliminate the bitterness. I also now peel all of my eggplants for the same reason. The lemon adds just the right touch. This was an excellent side dish.

I normally dredge the eggplant in breadcrumbs,coat in egg, then in breadcrumbs again. I found that by dredging in cornstach, egg, then breadcrumbs stops the eggplant from absorbing too much oil and creates a creamy texture to the eggplant. The coating process seems to be less messy than the way I originally coated the eggplant. Thank you for a great recipe!
