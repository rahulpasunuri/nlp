This is a great pie! It was my first time making pie from scratch. I used the attached all-butter pastry dough recipe. I've now made it twice in the last few weeks. Delicious.

This was a beautiful, delicious pie. This one will stay in my recipe collection!

The first time I made this, plums were not in season and I used an equal amount of pears, very tasty. Made it with plums this past weekend and it was superb. Great both ways, and gets compliments with either fruit.

I didn't find any blackberries at the farmers market, so I made it with raspberries instead. I poured off a lot of the liquid that leached out of the berries and baked it with a lattice top instead of the streusel. It was gorgeous and delicious!

My husband says this is the best pie he's ever eaten. It really was phenomenal. Very tangy and beautiful color. The streusel topping was delicious, too. Love it!!!

I can't really rate this recipe because I "borrowed" from it. When my husband came home from the grocery store with a store bought refrigerated deep dish pie crust (don't ask...) I found this recipe and used it as as template of sorts. I omitted the plums, used 4 cups of fresh assorted berries and, utilizing the rest of the recipe ingredients, ended up with a fabulous deep dish berry pie. On a whim I invited the neighbors over for dessert and it was a huge hit. The streusel topping put it over the top! I may make my own crust next time and/or add the plums, but in a pinch this will be my new go-to pie recipe.

This might be the best pie I have ever made! Each individual component is great on its own and they are amazing together. I am going to try the crust and topping with my favorite cherry filling. Try this pie!

Great pie! Made it with the plums and balckberries from my garden. I would cook at 350 next time because the top browned a little quickly.
