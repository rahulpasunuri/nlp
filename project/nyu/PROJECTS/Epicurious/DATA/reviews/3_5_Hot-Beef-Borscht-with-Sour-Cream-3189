Most amazing borscht ever and I've tried many recipes! Here's what I did to cut down on the prep time: instead of the whole short rib part I used 2 tetra packs of organic beef broth, left over roast beef which I cut into small slivers, a dash of Tabasco, 1 clove, and the bay leaf. I doubled the red wine vinegar, added a cup of water, and used the remaining water from the pan that the beets cooked in. I used the full 10 beets, 3 carrots, and a stalk of celery, no cabbage as I was out of that, lots of pepper, no salt as broth has lots.

We really loved this recipe. Changes made were added much more vinegar, used about 6 beets (as recommeded by others), left out potato. I cooked the short ribs in the pressure cooker and only took about 20 minutes then transfered everything to my large dutch oven. so, so good for a chilly winter's evening!

This soup is delicious...but...I gave it 3 forks because it is SOOOOO time intensive. I made this a multi-day project. I guess it would be a great winter storm project. I did find out that you can roast beets in a slow cooker and I actually cooked the beef and broth the same way (I have a timer on the plug I use for my slow cooker). Also the time that it took for the potatoes to cook through at the end was much longer than listed even though I diced them very small.

Superb! Enjoyed by Russians and non-Russians alike. This borscht tastes authentic, and is at least as good as my grandma's version, if not better. We followed the recipe almost to a T; the only thing we didn't add was the additional canned broth, since upon adding the beets and diced potatoes we seemed to have enough liquid.(Does anyone know why we it says to add broth to the stock?) I'd definitely recommend making the stock the night before so you don't have to wait hours and hours for it to chill. Overall, the entire process wasn't too difficult, and definitely worth a try.

This soup was GREAT!!! It did take a really long time to make, what with roasting the beets, and making the stock... I love beets, and used 4 very large beets instead of the 10 small. I also halfed the cabbage, because I don't care much for cabbage. Served with sour cream, and a nice crusty bread. Used stew beef instead of short ribs, and beef broth instead of water for the stock. Served 10 VERY hungry people, it made ALOT of soup, for how much we normally eat, I think we could easily have fed 12-15

I simmered the stock in a covered dutch oven at 250 degree oven for 2 and 1/2 hours. If you do this, reduce the amount of water you add to around 10 cups. I also used fewer beets - about three large ones. We really liked the flavor!

I made this soup for my dad's 80th birthday - borscht is one of his favorite foods and he loved this! I made it using the recipe for Zinfandel Beef stock instead of what is in the recipe. I think having the broth made of wine and roasted bones gave a really nice depth. I used all, if not more then the required beets and it was still plenty soupy. I highly recommend it! Most flavorful version of borscht I have ever had!

This is hands down the best borscht I've ever made and/or eaten. My grandmother used to make borscht, and she would grate the beets and boil them forever with cabbage, beef bones, and some beef scraps. This is a much more refined and more flavorful variety. I've made many of the borscht recipes on this site (the meaty Ukrainian borscht is probably my second-favorite after this) but none of them is as good as this. The clean taste of the roasted beets with the rich beef stock is just divine. Forget everything that people tell you about this not being authentic. It's much, much better than the boiled-to-death soup my forebears made in Russia.

This was my first attempt at borscht. I wish it were a bit beefier and a bit less beety. I think this recipe really neglects flavor. Rather than add a lot of salt at the end, salt each ingredient as you cook it. I also added a lot more vinegar than was called for to give it more flavor. I think the dice of the beets is a bit too big and I would probably half the amount of beets and grate them. This definitely tastes better the 2nd day

Followed the recipe exactly, except halved the meat only because it's all I had. It turned out really great! So hearty and the broth was amazing.

I don't get all the comments about the amount of beets called for---after reading them I used 6, and it was fine, but I don't think 10 would have been too many. One suggests 1/2 of a small beet? Cabbage soup, anyone?

This takes a lot of time to make, but isn't too bad if you're home watching football all day anyway. I made some adjustments: half the beets (would only use 2 beets next time), cut out the celery, added copious amounts of garlic, and sprinkled in dill at the end. I'll probably use less meat next time to make the soup a little lighter.

Excellent borscht! Very similar to that which I had in Odessa. I did take other reviewers advice and left out the celery and used only three beets.

Rating: 3
I don't know much about this being historically correct, but I do know it's delicious! I went ahead using a lot less beets than the recipe called for, following previous reviewers' suggestions. Turned out a lovely red soup with lots, but not overpowering beet flavor. I love it!

Rating: 1
This was an awful lot of effort for a lackluster result. PLEASE listen to the other reviewers and use half the beets called for. Even that will probably be too much. Borscht to me should be a clear red broth with shredded beets and sour cream. All the other ingredients made this particular version gloppy and not particularly good.

This soup is delicious. I am not an expert on borscht but I have eaten it before and this is more meaty than ones I have eaten in restaurants. It is quite a lot of work but an excellent result. I did not roast the beets even though I think it would have been a good idea to I just did not have time. It worked well anyway

I was born and raised in Russia, so I know what's not right about the recipe and I agree with Diane's comments. Put tomatoes after carrots and beets (1 - 1,5 cut them in 7 - 8 pieces). We never use so many beets, even half of a small beet is enough. The author wants to keep the red color by using many beets, but adding a little of rice vinegar will do it, just add it with beet. My husband loves borsch the way I make it and I hope my comments will help you. One more thing - borsch becomes tastier after a day or two.

My Goodness this was delicious! I made it for my daughter's International School Food Festival. Followed the directions exactly and served it up hot. Everyone loved it! It was completely gone after 30 minutes. The concensus was "I never knew borscht could taste this good". The Russians loved it; the Ukranians loved it; the Americans loved it; and the Indians loved it. I will definitely be making it again, and next time I'll have more for myself.

This is a Ukranian borsch, rather than a Polish or Russian one, so that explains the difference in expectations and therefore ratings. Mine came out unbelievably great. I used beef stock from Trader Joe's instead of water when making the stock, to make it richer. I also put in beets and beet tops from the beginning to get two kinds of beet flavor, one long-cooked, and one bright and fresh. I cooked the whole thing in a 6-quart crock pot so the short ribs would come out tender. It takes two days to have short ribs that are just right, but the stock with vegetables in it will over-caramelize in that time. What I did was drain the stock after the first day, refrigerate it and degrease it, and put the vegetables and short ribs back in the pot with hot water for the second day of cooking. This gave me very tender short ribs, but no over-caramelized taste to the stock. I also added an entire head of peeled garlic to simmer in the stock. After the shortribs were tender, I removed them, drained the stock, and discarded the stock vegetables. For the borsch assembly, I used beet tops and red kale instead of cabbage for flavor, added sliced mushrooms, and used 3 russet potatoes. I only used 8 medium-small beets, about 1.5 pounds. I think part of the confusion with this recipe is that the beets are specified by number rather than pounds. 1-1.5 pounds seem about right. I used lemon juice to taste instead of red wine vinegar, and garnished with dill and parsley instead of the sour cream. The borsch took two days, but it was mostly crockpot time, and it turned out incredibly delicious. My husband couldn't stop complimenting me on it.

I came home from Poland with a small bottle of buffalo grass vodka and I wanted to make authentic Polish borscht to go with it. This recipe seemed to be close (except for the celery, which I left out, because they don't have it in Poland). It came out okay, but so suffused with beets that the other veggies in it looked and tasted like beets, too. If I make this again, I'll cut back on the number of beets!

Great soup and beautiful! Quick and easy dish. Don't substitute canned beets for roasted beets. It's worth the extra time. Made if for dinner party and rec'd rave reviews.

Incredible healthy low fat meal! Served it to guests who HATE beets and they all loved it. Warning, it makes alot and doesn't freeze well so have lots of friends over to enjoy this hearty stew. We celebrated Russia with a dark Rye bread and this wonderful recipe.

Rating: 3
A great dish well worth the effort. I tend to add a little more red wine vinegar to my bowl at the end. I like this recipe so much it's been a standard in my recipe file since it's publication. Nice cold weather meal. :)

I grew up in a Ukrainian-American enclave in Philadelphia, with my mother as the local queen of borscht. This recipe is the closest thing to mama's borscht I've ever made. Anyone can make a borscht that can be masked with sour cream, few can stand alone, such as this wonderful recipe! Some things to add: much more garlic, otherwise it's not Ukrainian add some wild mushrooms chop some beet tops super fine and use them in palce of / in addition to the cabbage

overall ,not bad my wifes is better much better indeed which...goes without saying but not a bad effort all in all.

I thought that it was good except wasn't as tasty as I would think. The cook that gave it a poor review did not make the same recipe. She used the wrong meat, didn't use fresh beets so didn't make the recipe. Her review should not count

Rating: 2
I was unable to find fresh beets and substituted two pounds of stew beef and made the beef stock using canned beef broth instead of water, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I love hearty soup, but found this one to be more like a stew. If I make it again, I will cut down on the veggies and/or increase the stock.

My husband, who is from Russia, has been asking me to make borscht for years. What a debut when I made this recipe! He loves it and says this borscht is the BEST he has ever tasted--even better than mom's! And, yes, it is even better after a day or two.

Rating: 4
Since my husband is first generation Russian, I really wanted to find a recipe that would be as good as Mama made. This is the one. I have tried many and none can compare to this. My husband requests this dish often. It is always better the second day. And even better when you squeeze a clove of fresh garlic in your bowl at the table. A true staple in our home! Mama would be happy!

I was curious but skeptical when I asked my husband to make this for me. This was a hearty, comforting meal for a cold winter night. I can't wait to have it again!
