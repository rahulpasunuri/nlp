This is a very simple, but good recipe. I don't understand why other people had problems with the liquids. My rice cooked up perfectly. I've also made this and added a tablespoon of canned adobo sauce, which was great -- if you like a little heat.

This was good with some small modifications made because I had bought a boxed version of Spanish rice that had no seasoning packet. As my wife was getting upset, I found this recipe and got to work quickly (thank you, Epicurious!). Didn't have green peppers, but did have an orange and red one, so I used those. Didn't have tomato sauce, but did have diced organic tomatoes. Used the whole can, liquid included. Used only one onion; two seemed excessive. Cooked the veggies for about five minutes in a large non-stick skillet, then tossed in everything else and cooked for 20 minutes, completely covered, and it came out perfect--no excess liquid. Maybe the fact that the rice was Basmati had something to do with that. This made a LOT, and we liked it. Bye, bye, box mix!

am making this right now. Only one cup of rice??? I added more. I had so many onions (2) cut up, and more onions than rice. I think it's a typo.

I don't care, yeah yeah I didn't follow the directions exactly. With the suggestions of the reviewers I cut the water to 8 oz and it was absolutely perfect. The bell pepper, celery, cumin, tomato sauce - all excellent suggestions - hence the 4 forks. YUM!

I'm with Belgelee--too much liquid, so my rice was quite mushy. I also feel like it could have done with a bit more spice or even flavour. I've tasted tons better, and think that this recipe is not worth tweaking--look for a better one!

Waay too much liquid and I even cooked it with 1/2 cup less than the recipe. Result: goopey rice.

sounds great! For a healthier version, cook some brown rice instead of the white rice

I've tried a lot of different recipes for Spanish rice, but this is by far the best I've made. I used a combination of red and green peppers, but did not otherwise deviate from the recipe. On this particular occasion I served it with black bean burritos, but it would be a great side for any Tex/Mex/Cajun entree.

I added diced chicken breast, and this was delicious! I also doubled the cumin and used a long grain brown rice mix. Yum!

I do not like green bell peppers so I used the sweeter red ones. The tomato sauce I used is a Goya mexican style one and is delicious. This really turned out well. I am not above using a boxed Goya rice mix but this is so much better and not as much sodium. And it's super easy.

very easy and delicious. and a much better alternative to the boxed versions. followed recipe to the letter, but subbed yellow pepper for green. would add some cayenne next time for heat (it was a little on the sweet side). overall, quite good and would definitely add to my recipe canon!

I've made this many times. I make it exactly per the recipe with the following modifcations and it turns out pretty good for a spanish rice: use brown rice (healthier), 2 tsp cumin instead of 1, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and 3 cups low sodium V8 instead of the tomato sauce and water.

Great and tasty recipe and yet so easy!

This was my first attempt at Spanish rice and I'd say it was tasty, but a bit oily. I only used one onion, and omitted the green pepper, added more salt and pepper, and definitely use the cumin as the more flavor the better! I used a 14.5 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes with their juice, instead of the tomato sauce, which added a nice texture that the dish needed. Be careful not to overcook as it can easily turn to a really mushy mess if you aren't watching.

This recipe was just okay. I added a jalapeno and some cumin but thought overall it was disappointing.

My mother-in-law was saying that she never could have school lunch because of $$$. What she always wanted was Spanish Rice. Sooooooooo I zoomed to epicurious and found the perfect recipe in this one and it made her very happy. I basically did the same thing but made it in the microwave instead. Saute veggies in a Corningware French casserole on stove. Add rice and coat well. Add liquids and bring to a simmer. Cover and put in the microwave for 20 minutes. My microwave is old/slow so It might not take that long. Remove and set on counter. Fluff. Then cover with a tea towel. I used Hunts spagetti sauce. This freezes well especially if you bag it and use it for a quick side for dinner. How many times have I made this this week? Three! Feel free to add flavor. Cumin is essential as it adds that mystery. Also they sell frozen diced red and green peppers. Perfect.

Much better if you substitute the green pepper with anaheim chilis! Definately add the cummin.

Full flavor-for a change use red and yellow peppers and risotto for a creamy finish!

This recipe was just okay. It's not all that flavorful, and for all the work, I probably wouldn't make it again.

Finally a spanish rice recipe I was able to make right! I made some changes though. I only used 1/2 of a sweet onion and 1 bell pepper, I omitted the celery. I used a half tablespoon of both chili powder and oregano based on reviews and other recipes since several reviewers here felt this recipe was bland. I also used 1 and a half tablespoons of fresh ground cumin seed - only because I didn't have ground cumin on hand but that may have made a huge difference. We loved this!!! It a very flavorful side dish that you can really play around with to suit your tastes.

Not horrible, but not delicious either. I had been expecting something a bit more flavorful and it just kind of came off like white rice and had stuff in it, rather than a real mexican dish. Overall it was a little bland, but quick and simple to make. I added some diced tomato to add some more substance and subbed out the celery. If you're looking for a real mexican flavored dish, find another.

A good recipe, however, my mom (Spanish, Finnish and Irish) did make something similar. She would first saute a YELLOW pepper,onion and 1/2 tsp. each black pepper, rosemary, oregano, parsley, garlic powder, sea salt and cayenne powder to taste - until onions and peppers are slightly tender. Set them aside. Saute long grain rice in olive oil for approximately 7 minutes. Stick 2 medium sized tomatoes in a blender until well blended. Add one cup of water to tomatoes and add to rice. Bring to a boil. Reduce and simmer until rice is done. Add peppers and onions. - This is really great as a side dish and even better with shrimp.

This was delicious, although I made the following changes: sauteed about half an onion, finely chopped with the rice in olive oil; added the garlic, half a red bell pepper, thinly sliced and about 1/2 c. diced ham steak. After adding the water and tomato sauce, I put in 1/2 tsp each cumin, oregano and chili powder and cooked as per the recipe. To serve, sprinkled a little shredded Mexican cheese over each helping and just let the heat from the rice melt the cheese. Very tasty!

I would say this recipe is heavy on veggies lite on the rice, next time I'll double the rice to 2 cups and of course add extra liquid. you HAVE to use Cumin, and more like 1-2 TBL.

Basic, OK..a bit bland.

oh, and yes, you definitely want to cut back on the oil if you use the chorizo. 1/4 cup is way too much.

Ok, so I changed it too. Added 3 small links of spanish chorizo, chopped, and a diced & seeded jalapeno to the initial saute. Used one poblano pepper and one red bell pepper instead of green bells. I think the poblanos lend a more authentic flavor than plain old bell peppers, and the red adds a better contrast & blend of color. Used some dried celery flakes for the flavor, since I dont keep it in the house, and we're not that fond of it. Skipped the saffron suggestion, but definitely agree with the cumin being a necessity. With the chorizo, this is a meal in itself, and even better when it's leftovers. Yum!

We made this recipe for our daughter's high school graduation open house and it was a hit! We received lots of comments on how delicious the rice was! I added one 16 oz. canned of tomates and cut back the water to 1 cup. If you want to add some extra zip, use canned tomatoes with jalepenos!

This is a great simple recipe that is very close to the authentic traditional arroz mexicano. It's definitely a crowd pleaser when you're preparing a simple Mexican dinner.

This was simple and delicious. I made this at the last minute for my husband and I, so I halved it. Wonderful!

Easy, very good. We didn't have a small can of tomato sauce, so (I'll admit, my husband made this) he used some jarred brushetta mix - tomatoes, garlic and oil. This made it a bit oily but tasted great.

I made this to stuff in Green Peppers. I heaped the teaspoon of cumin because I was adding ground beef in the end. It was not too hot in fact not hot at all but spicy in a flavorful way and very, very delicious. I stuffed 3 lg. peppers and have enough for two more. This will become a staple for me. OH, also substituted brown rice so I had to cook 1 hr 15 mins.

My husband is the pickiest eater on Earth, so I left out the peppers and celery when making this, convinced it wouldn't taste quite right. However, it was still delicious even with the omissions and best of all, my husband loved it!!

To spice it up I added green chilies and I DID add the cumin. I sauteed the garlic, green chilies and all veggies first, then sauteed the rice in that and then added the water. I also topped it off with a little cilantro and cheese.

I followed the recipe including the optional cumin (I agree a must) till the end when I added cut up raw shrimp and it was delicious.

I agree with the previous reviewer, and took the advice. Don't you wish people would stick with the original recipe for a true review? I know, I didn't stick to it, either. First, I substituted brown Basmati rice, which more that doubled the cooking time, so it's a good thing I started this dish early. Also, the cumin IS an ABSOLUTE must, so don't leave it out. And if you have any saffron strands handy, throw those in too. I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I substituted a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, drained the juice and used that as part of my two cups of water. I also added the rice right after the onions and peppers, and attempted to fry it. But because of the shear volume of ingredients, not a whole lot of frying happened, just softening, so use your largest frying pan that you have a lid for. Would I make it again? Yes, it's very good, and worth the effort.

This recipe needs Saffron and Cumin is a must. Also, It works best if you saute the rice in the Olive oil golden brown before you add the other ingredients.
