This was OK if you added enough spice. For some reason, the sauce came out very bitter. It mellowed a bit once I added the paneer and peas; maybe my onion was bitter? Anyway, I used a small amount of tomatoes and lots of diced tomatoes.

Terrific recipe, but the taste of the tomatoes was quite sharp and overwhelming. I made three changes to this recipe: add more peas (1 lb fozen sweet peas), add about a 1/2 cup cilantro and add coconut milk to taste (I usually add about 14 oz -- better and healthier than cream). It really knocks down the sharpness of the tomatoes and brings out the spices and fresh ginger. Yum! One of my favorite dishes and has been a hit with family and friends.

I am rating this with 4 forks based on the changes I made to the recipe, which made it delightful. *Double all the spices, garlic and ginger. *Add yellow and brown mustard seeds, and salt. **Add potatoes and more peas! *Use slightly less tomatoes and water. I made this recipe because I had harvested peas, potatoes, onions, garlic, and cilantro from my garden. The fresh peas and potatoes are the best!

One of my favorite curry recipes to date. I have always doubled the spices in curry recipes (because there is no way spices in America are as fresh and fragrant as those in India) and have yet to come out with a bland curry. We made this for an Indian friend while we were living in France and he said it was like going home. As for paneer, I started making my own while in France (mainly using the recipe on here called "Fresh Indian Cheese") because it wasn't available in our little city and now I still make it because it is remarkably easy and so much less expensive than buying it.

Just made this for supper tonight. Definitely agree with the previous comments that the tomato is a bit much. Cut that down a bit and adjust the spices according to your taste and it makes a pretty good muttar paneer. If you want a thick sauce use the crushed or pureed tomatoes, but I'd try it with just a can of chopped tomatoes and not add extra water. One trick I've found for decreasing the strength of tomatoes in a sauce is to add some baking soda in so that it cuts the acidity. Did that with this dish and added some plain yogurt too. Another little note that this makes a large amount. I only cook for 2 so I'd cut this at least in half next time to make a nice meal along with some naan or roti and a chana masala too!

i haven't made this recipe, but I can tell you that paneer is pretty easy to make from scratch and you should def. substitute tomato paste and stock for stewed tomatoes. Sagg panner is supposed to be an almost creamy dish. Also add more fresh chili or dried chili's for heat. I have noticed that Indian dishes use a lot of onion. So a biggie will not be a problem.

Inedible! Honestly, it didn't even taste like food. Shame, I've beating my head against Indian food for a while looking for a good dish to make myself. Seems the restaurants have the lockdown on flavor.

I ADORE this dish. The only change I make is to double the garam masala, and then it is simply pure heaven.

I followed this exactly and it was the blandest curry I have yet to have. Completely overwhelmed by the tomatoes - I would definitely halve the amount - and lacking in any depth whatsoever.

I followed the recipe nearly verbatim; I browned the paneer in ghee but didn't add more for the veggies (and I added a bell pepper). This is really good, but I think the tomato is too dominant, and I would definitely consider adding plain yogurt or coconut milk next time to soften the tomato a bit and help to meld the flavors.

I was pleasantly surprised how delicious this was with tofu in lieu of paneer, olive oil in lieu of ghee and sans the pepper, didn't have one on hand. I used a lot more cilantro and a whole head of garlic. The boys all ate it and the husband was extremely complimentary.

Havent made this yet but i noticed some people posting about how expensive paneer was. If you wanted to make it, the recipe is very simple. Basically scalding milk and adding an acid then straining the curds from the whey. Or, as my friend who is from India does when she's state side use ricotta cheese instead.

Really tasty dish. I skipped the paneer and used black eyed peas instead, and used canola oil instead of the clarified butter. I simmered it uncovered for an additional 10 minutes to thicken it further, and served it over toasted nan from the store. Came out excellent. It has a nice clean, well-balanced heat and a ton of flavor.

I have made this a couple times, and love it, with a few additions, I add a can of coconut milk at the same time as the can of tomatoes. This seems to fill out the flavors a bit. I also add some broccoli, squash, and mushrooms early on (whatever I have on hand) -- sautee them with the onion. This adds a little bulk and turns it into a "one pot meal."

This is a delicious vegetarian curry recipe. There are a lot of flavors and it is pretty easy to make. I usually use less paneer (1/2 to 2/3 of a pound or so), and don't miss it. I also use olive oil instead of ghee. I prefer to serve this with naan instead of rice, so I let it simmer a little bit longer to thicken the sauce up. This has a nice bite to it, but isn't too spicy. Will become part of our regular rotation of meatless meals.

Had whole milk languishing in the fridge, so made the paneer which was surprisingly easy. While I'll probably buy the paneer or use tofu next time, this recipe is a definite keeper. Added 1t salt at same time as tomatoes.

This recipe is good but definitely needs salt! I'd add 1-2 teaspoons next time. Our local Indian makes this a bit creamier so I'd also try to add 1/4 cup of half and half. Great though, we ate it two nights in a row!

Good, quick recipe. I substituted tofu for paneer because the paneer was 3x the price of tofu. I omitted the chili, which next time would make sure to include to bump up the spice.

Made this last night. Actually stuck to the recipe and it was great! The flavor was very similar to the local Indian restuarant with just a little heat. More time consuming than I initially thought it would be. Very filling. Good vegetarian meal.

used tofu instead of paneer and veg oil instead of ghee. also realized I didn't have turmeric, substituted curry powder. This was delish! Big success... served with cucumber/carrot salad (just a little vinegar and salt to dress it) was the perfect thing to compliment the heat of the dish.

I made this with shrimp and added New Mexican red chile, which made it too hot for some. I would make it exactly according to recipe next time, and would use tofu (though shrimp was delicious). Also, I served it with quinoa instead of rice. Consider, if quinoa is available. It, unlike rice, has complete protein and cooks in less time.

delicious. part of a vegan dinner, so substituted firm tofu for the paneer (and no ghee). served with coconut red lentil curry with zucchini/spinach. the garam masala in this dish was a nice complement to the coconut/curry flavors of the other. definitely a keeper.
