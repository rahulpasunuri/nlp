I made this recipe for a Jamaican themed dinner club. The appetizer was delicious and completely eaten up with praises. I doubled the recipe and baked half and fried the other half. We sampled some of each and everyone agreed that there was no significant difference in flavour from the baked versus the deep fried dumplings, so if you want a lightened up version, bake at 400 for 3 mins per side. I also made the following modifications to rave reviews: added, garlic, ginger and used curry paste instead of curry powder and I served with a mango chutney dipping sauce. Yum, I will make these again. :)

This was a good appetiser. Like some other reviewers, I added garlic, allspice and ground cloves as the filling needed some more flavour. I served with a sauce of pureed mangos, lime juice, coriander and red pepper. Really nice.

These were very flavorful and delicious. Followed the recipe except I added a whole cup of diced onions and I used panko breadcrumbs, Italian style which is all I had on hand. I tasted the meat mixture before adding the hot sauce and it had a great medium spicy curry taste. I used Jamaican Curry Hot Sauce to taste and liking to spice it up. With the wonton wrappers I had water did not work well with sealing so I switched to egg white for sealer and it worked perfectly. I do agree these would go great with a sweet red chili sauce, or a variety of dipping sauces. Also this recipe is easily modified, you could do ground turkey or chicken, or for a vegetarian one substitute potatoes instead of meat. Great for parties, as a appetizer or snack.

I mix 2 parts mango chutney with 1 part apricot jam for a quick and delicious dip to cut the heat a bit. I've made these many times now, and always get rave reviews. Time-consuming, but worth it.

these are so tasty, and so easy to make! great for parties or picnics; tasty even cold. I dare you to eat just one! I used bison instead of beef, just because it was what I had on hand. will definitely make these again.

I left out the onions and added about 1 tsp of garlic powder, and this is my new favorite recipe! The dumplings turned out delicious and so addictive. My boyfriend and I have made them several times since, trying different variations. Tip: they taste best when fried on a griddle with just a little olive oil

I made a double batch of these and made a nice little spicy sweet dipping sauce to go along with them. I will be making these again with some round dumpling skins I picked up from my local Asian grocer, and a bit more of a kick. These kept well in a paper bag for a few days, and did well when reheating in the toaster oven. I would definitely not recommend the microwave reheat on these. As a side note, a good dipping sauce is a sweet thai chili sauce that can be picked up from most Asian markets. I like simplicity, and these really were quick, easy, simple and tasty. I wish 3 and a half stars were an option.

Easy and impressive for guests. I made these with the addition of garlic, ginger, cloves, cayenne and fennel for more kick. I too made a dipping sauce of apricot jam, plum sauce and chili-garlic sauce for more heat. Great presentation and lots of flavour with a nice crunch. These brown very quickly, be attentive! I pre-made these and then reheated them in the oven for when the guests arrived to serve hot with cocktails. YUM!!

We have made this for the last 3 parties we have had and it is a hit! We have to double the recipe because they go so fast!

I made this as a Christmas dinner appetizer. They were a hit! Very Addictive. I served them with a store bought sweet thai chili sauce. After tasting the beef, I felt it needed more spice. I added some allspice, fresh garlic, oregano, cumin, and a little more salt. I used Matouks brand as the pepper sauce.

I made this with a girlfriend for a potluck, they were fun to make and really simple, too! We added Jamaican pepper sauce to the beef. A dip would have been nice, we didn't think that far in advance, but next time for sure.

More like 3 1/2 forks, but that's not an option. My husband and I both LOVED these. I made the recipe as written, used "Busha Browne's Pukka Hot Pepper Sauce" (it's Jamaican) purchased at the local co-op, and served with Rice with Fennel and Golden Raisins (also on this site - perhaps a strange combo but the sweetness of the rice was a great pairing to the spicy dumplings!!). I also mixed some plum sauce and apricot jam (both items I had hanging around the fridge) and served it as a dipping sauce. SO GOOD. I'm acutally considering making a second batch as we speak...

Easy to do. That day I couldn't fin wonton wrappers so I used egg roll wrappers and cut them down to size, Guests liked them but it needed a dipping sauce. Something fruit based, I think, to cut the heat.

With so few ingredients and easy prep (actually, filling 30 wontons took less than 10 minutes, you get the hang of it pretty fast), this is a lot of fun to make. And my husband and I did eat them for dinner-- more than half at once! They were addictive. I omitted the scallion and bread crumbs (mostly because I forgot to put them in), but they were still dynamite. I'd cook this again in a second.

I made these for a picnic I went to this weekend, and they flew out of the tray! I was not sure how a fried appetizer would travel, but everyone said they were great! I have to admit, I ate about six myself! Folding dumplings is very easy! It would be nice if a dipping sauce idea was included. I used my leftover chimmichurri dressing and that was a pretty good combo. YUM, will make again!

Ok, I made this with a go to filling that I use in many different ways. A Thai chicken filling. I cook 1 lb. of ground chicken with a little chopped onion, and add 1 c. panko crumbs. when it's almost cooked I add 3 TBS. Thai sweet chili sauce, and about 1/3 c. chopped scallions and cilantro. then fill and fry dumplings as directed. serve with the thai chili sauce as a dip.

My son made these - they were gone as soon as they came out of the pan. A good recipe - could use a tad more salt,and heat can be adjusted up or down as desired. A good appetizer.

This was very quick to make & really tasty considering the short ingredient list. I wouldn't call it a dinner item either, but fantastic for a potluck or snacks. The filling can be made ahead & refrigerated for a day or 2. My husband ate them as fast as I made them.

Are you kidding. Rolling 30 dumplings is a quick and easy dinner? I think this is in the wrong category. I would consider this an appetizer, not dinner and not quick and easy.
