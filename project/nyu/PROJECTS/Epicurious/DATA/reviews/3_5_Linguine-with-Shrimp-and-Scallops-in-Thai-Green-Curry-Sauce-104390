Lovely recipe. I made this with some Green curry paste added to the chile and white scallions to add extra kick. Also doubled the green paste with the broth. For those who have problems with the broth/sauce being too thin, reduce it more than the 5 minutes it says. Keep boiling until it reduces down into a thickish sauce. After you mix the linguine in, it should be thick enough to coat the pasta and no more, no puddles left over. Enjoyed this a lot, will make agin.

Sooooo good! I didn't add scallops because my boyfriend doesn't care for them, so I probably should have added twice the amount of shrimp or another meat/fish choice. It was a little soupy without the extra protein source. Don't overcook pasta....I used rice noodles found in an Asian market.

I made this recipe last night for company following the recipe exactly (although doubling quantities to make for 8 ppl). It was delicious and a big hit! I did all the prep work (chopping, etc) during the day, also sauteed chilis and scallions in advance. An hour before guests arrived I cooked the scallops and shrimp--and then warmed them in the sauce at the end. This made it easier to do while entertaining. One suggestion, add more red chilis. This is not a hot/spicy dish so you need to adjust if you'd like more spice.

Delicious. Made according to recipe, but added fresh basil and fresh, minced ginger. Wow. Gonna make it again, and will thicken the sauce a bit next time, just before tossing with the linguine. The whole family loved it!

Rating: 4
Wow this was so delicious and full of flavor! I did omit the scallops to save money, but otherwise followed the recipe. One suggestion: I put together my coconut base first so those ingredients were all mixed and ready to go into the pan when needed. In doing so, I was able to give my curry paste a quick 1-2 minute saute on its own before adding it to the mixture, which helps to deepen the curry flavors.

I didn't love this recipe. I admit, I didn't have cilantro or a fresh red chile (I subbed in chili flakes instead) but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Maybe those things make all the difference, but without them, I don't recommend this dish.

This was very good, but not great. I added snow peas, doubled the curry paste, increased the shallots and added some red pepper flakes. It's definitely easy and I'd make it again with these changes. Otherwise it would be really bland.

First I have to admit I did make a few alterations on this recipe. I started with sauted veggies, carrots snap peas and red peppers. A great addition to up the veggie value if this meal and tasted good too. I did also add minced garlic and Ginger plus some lemon grass too, also great. I had never used green curry paste before but I ended up doubling the amount as it wasn't quite as punchy flavored but did bring a nice heat. I had no red peopled so used a Serrano with half the seeds and was still good and spicy but if you have a decent tolerance for spicy food was not over the top hot. I also used light coconut milk but I think the full fat stuff would add more body to the flavor but was still tasty if you want the low fat version. If I was serving company I would splurge on the calories. Would defenitly make again.

Brilliant recipe but the wine suggestion is a little off. I would much rather go with the style of an Alsace Riesling than a new Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. I paired it with a 2003 Estate Rüdesheim, a dry Riesling from Georg Breuer in Rheingau. A fantastic wine to go with a fantastic dish!

Very tasty and easy to make. I unfortunately didn't have the Thai green curry past and had to use curry, but other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out yummy! I will definitely make it again.

Everyone remarked what a great change it was from heavy cream sauces. It was reheated three times and still tasted great!

Don't be afraid of reducing/adjusting the amount of heat because the flavor is still very good. Normally, I would have made this "full heat," but my fiance is on a restricted diet, and so I reduced the curry paste and omitted the chile. We really liked the flavor of the sauce, and I look forward to trying this again with the called-for amount of spice. As recommended by others, I used less (about 1/4 tsp) sugar, and that was plenty. Next time I'll add minced fresh ginger.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe for a fresh take on a pasta dish! I added a bit more seasonings to increase the flavor and balance the spice - marinated the shrimp and scallops in salt, pepper and minced garlic, used more lime in the sauce and more cilantro. I also substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth and don't think I lost any depth of flavor. I made a side of Asian inspired sautéed spinach (using sesame oil, soy sauce, fish sauce, lemon and garlic)to round out the meal.

Rating: 0
So Amazing! Very tasty. I also used 1.5 Tablespoons to 1 can (398ml) Coccount milk. Perfect! The sauce was nice and light. I added more lime through the process, adds alittle more zing. I will for sure make this meal again!

Excellent change from typical Italian flavors. I increased the curry paste by 1.5 t as I was missing the hot chilies. I decreased the coconut milk by 1/2 and increased the chix stock. Very delicious.

I needed to reduce for two people. I love spicy food and for reduction 1 teaspoon of the green curry is plenty. I put in two and it was over powering. I also opted for light coconut milk to save a few calories and that worked fine. lastly my husband had pasta and I ate mine over brown rice. also delicious. great recipe adjust the spice for your taste

Rating: 3
Interesting flavors. First off, my husband and I are not big into heavier white sauces for pasta dishes. That being said, we both found this pretty tasty and a welcome change from the typical spicy pasta dish. Some alterations to the recipe: 1) instead of red pepper I used 2 jalapenos, minced without seeds & a generous sprinkle of red pepper flakes into the oil 2) omitted the sugar because we are not fans when sweetness overpowers the underlying flavors 3) added sugar snap peas & baby corn for veggies 4) added 2-3 small cloves of garlic. I will definitely make this again. I might try using less coconut milk & a little more stock to have a slightly lighter/thinner sauce....just a preference.

This is one of the tastiest Thai recipes I've ever made. It's relatively easy, not terribly expensive, and tastes delicious the next dy (if you have any leftovers!).I didn't have a hot red chile, so substituted red chile flakes - about a tsp. Worked perfectly.

We really enjoyed this, just made too much for two people. The only change I made was that I used a serrano pepper instead of a red chile, which wasn't available. Next time I would make it a bit spicier by using more peppers AND invite some friends to share this delicious dish.

This was pretty good. I used a serrano pepper in place of the red chili pepper (grocery store didn't have the chili pepper)and it turned out just mildly spicy. I'll definately make again using the chili pepper next time for a little more heat.

If you like noodle bowl dishes at thai restaurants, then this is sure to be a hit. We thought it was too spicy after the first bite, but quickly got used to the heat. However, my youngest found it way too spicy for him. I added snowpeas and will do it again along with perhaps some other asian style veggies. I may try it next time with light coconut milk to reduce the fat/calories and to provide a less sticky sauce.

Rating: 3
We enjoyed this very much. Used only scallops, added snow peas, used lots of lime juice and served with coconut rice instead of pasta. I cut back on sugar based on other reviews, and skipped the chile this time--the lime and coconut sauce was yummy, but the chile would add a fun kick too. I topped with fresh cilantro, toasted coconut, and the scallions. A keeper, easy to play with.

Rating: 3
A good week-night recipe, although I don't think I would ever make it "for company" unless one was confident in the tolerance for spice. I used 0.5 of a red chile and the dish was quite hot, although we loved it. Quick, easy and with frozen shellfish can be whipped together quickly.

Rating: 0
Very good and fairly quick dish. I added minced garlic to the initial saute, and water chestnuts and straw mushrooms to the finished product. Contrary to what others have said, I did not find it very spicy; add more chiles and/or season with Sriracha to turn up the heat.

This is really good. Some were complaining of too much sweetness. I wouldn't put 1/2 a can of coconut milk in as I don't like that taste too strong and it's fabulous. Maybe that's why I didn't find it too sweet. I don't remove the chilies either. Throw some garlic in. Try it. I like hot and spicy food and this falls into that category for those of you who don't like too much heat.

This recipe was great but the process was a bit cumbersome. Next time I wouldn't bother taking out the chili/scallions mixture, I'll just leave it in the skillet. Also, I cooked the scallops and shrimp together - no need to cook them separately. I cut back on the fish sauce to just 1 tbsp but added an extra 1/2 tbsp of green chili paste. Spicy is good!

Not too bad. Had to scale down the amount of green curry so that I wouldn't set my husband on fire, also omitted the red chile. Used one teaspoon green curry which was perfect for me, but alas, still too hot for my husband. Also made it with all shrimp.

Spicy! Yum. I followed this recipe to the letter and absolutley loved it. I did not think anything was overpowering. The spice was nice and hot without being over-spicy. But, you must love a spicy food to enjoy it. Otherwise, tone down the spices. Although I do feel that the scallops and shrimp could have used more flavor. Maybe marinate them in something that would blend well with the flavors of the dish. Mmmmmm!!

I liked the recipe but it was sooo hot- spicy hot. I guess I did not realize that Thai food is that hot. I would like to try it again but with less of the green curry paste which I believe is the ingredient that made it so spicy. I used exactly the amounts and types of ingredients listed in the recipe. If you like hot food, you will love this recipe.

I just made this tonight for my father and after two bites he exclaimed "this is great!" With the exception of decreasing the green curry slightly and using a jalapeno instead of a red pepper, I followed the directions to the letter. I was stunned by how well it turned out and thought the lime juice and cilantro to be indispensible. In my opinion, this dish just wouldn't be as good without those two ingredients. Agree with other reviewers who thought this would work well with chicken. Excellent recipe; definitely a keeper!

We are normally serious white sauce people.....This light sauce is so flavorful and nice...It will satisfy even the goopy sauce fanatic because of the flavor. Don't hold back on the chopped cilantro!. It adds critical color and flavor.

To start with I did not add the cilantro, but between the steps of cooking the scallops and shrimp I sauteed 1 red bell pepper, and approx 3/4 lb snow peas. I then put those in a bowl and added another TBSP of oil and cooked the shrimp. when I put in the sauce to cook, I added 8 oz of fresh pinapple. finished the cooking of the sauce to recipie and instead of using linguine noodles, I used thai rice sticks. It turned out wonderful. I know for next time it was mild this way and could add more hot pepper or more curry sauce to increase the heat

I've made this recipe more times than any other on this site, but with a few revisions: 4 chiles (I use jalapenos), 6-8 scallions, double fish sauce, double brown sugar, double or triple curry paste, triple the lime juice, triple the chicken broth. Instead of linguine I use a pound of wide rice noodles which have been started in boiling water, then removed from heat and left to sit in the hot water about 11-13 minutes. (STIR NOODLES A LOT while soaking to keep them from clumping). Then add the noodles to the sauce, top with the cilantro and green parts of scallions and let the sauce soak into the noodles a little bit. Excellent.

I left out the scallops and added 1 red pepper, 1/4 lb snow peas, and 1/2 lb lightly blanched green beans at the end of the recipe, when the shrimp are added to the sauce. Very tasty and surprisingly easy! Almost as good as my favorite local Thai restaurant (and a lot less expensive).

Although I used chicken breasts rather than seafood, I made the sauce as written and found it really lacked depth of flavour, spiciness and interest. I had to add some minced lemon grass, grated ginger, a couple of cloves of minced garlic, additional lime juice and zest, another Tbsp of green curry and coriander seeds. After all those changes, it was much better but still nothing special. I much prefer the recipe Thai-Style Chicken in Coconut Sauce (from this site) which I have used for shrimp and scallops as well as chicken, and always to rave reviews. Re the comments about colour: I used green curry paste and really can't say the colour was especially attractive, I don't think any more than red curry would be. The garnish/topping of sauteed chile and scallions was a lovely addition and I will use that again. What attracted me to this recipe was the seeming quickness/ease of preparation, but without several time consuming changes the taste just wasn't there, so I will not be making this again.

Great recipe that can be made more easily by mixing the sauce ingredients together in advance then just saute the shrimp and scallops together with a bit of fresh chopped ginger, add the sauce mix, simmer till thickened and throw in a handful of chopped coriander and garnish with fresh chopped scallions.

Just made this dish this weekend and thought it was superb. Made a few additions that I think added to the flavor and complexity of it; I included a three inch stalk of fresh lemon grass, sliced into one inch pieces, and a tablespoon of fresh ginger as well. You need to remove the lemongrass before serving as it is on the tough side. I also served it over rice noodles but everyone thought they would enjoy it even more over rice. Make sure not to get any of the cilantro stalks in your chopped cilantro,and to chop it and the scallion tops on the fine side,as too much texture in the garnish is distracting from the whole dish. Definately would make this again!

I stuck to this recipe exactly, and would make it again with the following changes. First I would use Jasmine Rice instead of Linguine. The pasta tends to steal some of the fantastic flavor. Second, when cooking the prawns and scallops, I will sauté them in lemon and garlic to give them their own flavor. At the end, I felt the sauce was missing something, and I think by cooking the seafood in a bit of lemon, that flavor will add a bit of tang back into the otherwise delicious sauce. My local spice vendor suggests adding lime leaves to the sauce; I may try this as well.

This was delicious - a "keeper". That was the consensus of the three people who consumed it including my 13 year old grandson. I made a few changes (doesn't everybody). I also had red thai curry paste on hand but no green. It worked fine. I simplified the procedure by sauting the scallions and pepper and then sauteing the scallops in the pepper mixture. I didn't have shrimp on hand but had 3/4 lb codfish (which with the scallops was going to become chowder). So I cut it into pieces and sauted it as well. I then added the sauce and scallops and let the whole thing cook together for about 5 minutes. The scallops remained in their pieces (quartered) the cod pretty well joined itself with the sauce. I removed the scallops and cod and added the pasta, just heating it well and then added the scallops and cod again. It was good.

Will definately do again, but in the winter time. I found it to hot to eat during the hot summer months

Wonderful dish; my apprehensive friends loved it. I read the prior reviews, and added stir-fried carrots, broccoli, and snow peas. I also heeded the cornstarch advice and kept a tablespoon of it mixed with 1 T. cold water on hand to add as the sauce came to a boil (for those who might not know how to add cornstarch to thicken up a thin sauce). Although I liked the linguine, I would also try serving on top of Thai jasmine rice. I served this with a chilled Gewertztraminer, which was a perfect complement to the sweet and spicy flavor of this dish.

My husband and I loved this dish! I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the scallops (no fresh ones available). I served this with basmati rice and red curry mussels. Delicious! This is definately something I will make again and again. More Thai recipes please!

Excellent - The only thing I did different was I thickened it just a bit with a little cornstarch mixture and I also served it over jasmine rice. We served it at a gourmet dinner party and it was the hit of the party. Highly recommend you try this receipe!!

Fabulous. Reduced the oil slightly and used "lite" coconut milk - still indulgent. Couldn't find thai red chilies at Whole Foods so used a serrano and was pleased with the result. Thought the linguine noodles were fun!

This was really yummy! I served it over traditional Thai noodles rather than linguini. I can't wait to serve it again.

My guests raved about the recipe - very complex, spicy flavor. I served it with linguine - which went well with the sauce. I don't think rice would be the best choice. It took three supermakets - but I finally found the green curry paste.

this dish was really good. I agree with previous reviewers that it will definitely benifit from a little more cilantro. I would disagree, however with the previous review that it would be better over rice. I think the linguine was perfect. This is a great dish with heavy thai influence.

I agree about subb'ing the linguini - That's just not Thai! I added pure honey instead of the sugar and a coupla dried kaffir Lime leaves too! Also using Ghee 'bolsters' the flavours.

I loved this recipe. Instead of Water or Chicken Broth, I used a really good green tea. I also added a small knuckle of ginger and more cilantro. Would be great over rice. I think it would also be good with Chicken.

This was so so good! I actually instead of using the 1 1/2 tbsp of oil I used 1 tbsp and 1/2 tbsp of hot oil instead for a little more spice. The spice was just perfect, not too much but with a little after thought. I also through in vegies that I had sauted in oil as well (carrots, broccoli and snow peas) Much prettier and better with the veggies. Saute them fist alone and them throw them in as you bring it all toghether. I also just mixed it all up instead of trying to portion out individually, I think that worked a lot better and the presentation was still great!

One serving of this recipe has enough sodium to more than match a full days recommendations. Flavor from herbs and spices, not salty prepared sauces are more appropriate.

Fabulous! Doubled the brown sugar, squeezed 1/2 lime (more than 1 tblsp.), and added much more cilantro. Make only the servings that you wish to serve immediately (doesn't reheat well) and be prepared for it to be spicy (in a good way). Very tasty; we're adding it to our list of favorites. We've noticed that Thai Kitchen's batches of green curry are not always the same. One batch was surprisingly hot at its normal dosage.

I liked this dish enough...thought it was easy to make and tasty. But there is something keeping me from giving it three forks. I think when I make this again, I will make the green curry and seafood and serve it over rice or just serve it in a bowl with some bread instead. I think the linguine took away something from the sauce. I used Thai Kitchen green curry paste and coconut milk.

This dish was excellent. I added garlic and ginger once as recommended, and liked the dish even better. To the NYC cook, I don't think that for some reviewers it's a matter of getting "hung up" on name-brands. It's just common sense that some brands of foods will be of a better quality than others; if some reviewers want to recommend brands they've tried and liked, great. I love reading these reviews... in some cases, I'd be lost without them. Thanks, guys.

I made several adjustments to this dish, but it was still excellent (a "make again" as my husband would say). I used chicken breast instead of shrimp & scallops--delicious still. Put it over basamati rice instead of pasta--also delicious. Used basil instead of cilantro--delicious again. However, one tablespoon of Thai Kitchen Green Curry was VERY spicy. I might bring this down to 1/2 Tablespoon next time. We skipped the pepper and scallion topping because the recipe was already so spicy. One note: if you add cooked rice into the recipe at the end, it absorbs lots of the extra liquid, making for a perfect consistency.

This has saved us from ordering from our local Thai place for the last two months. Simple and great. Don't get so hung up on brand of curry paste. Just adjust to taste with ginger, red pepper etc.. Have tried several different brands and types: red, panang etc., and all are delicious.

Wonderful! I used the Thai Kitchen brand of curry paste and fish sauce as recommended, and I really believe that the quality of these two ingredients is key to this dish turning out well. I added two cloves of garlic and a little ginger to the scallion and pepper mixture for extra flavor. I also cut back on the scallops a little (those suckers cost a fortune!) and used a Jamaican red pepper, because I couldn't find the long one called for. Our mouths were on fire, but we like it that way. A keeper for sure. (BTW, I made the sauce a bit ahead of time, and was pleased to see that it thickened a little as it sat).

Know your ingredients! I think the spiciness of this dish definitely depends on your brand of curry paste, or if you make your own paste. You should add the curry paste according to your liking. I would definitely make this dish again.

I liked this dish a lot. We used Thai Kitchen brand Curry Paste and 1 tablespoon was just about right. I made the sauce, the topping (adding a little garlic and ginger) and sauted the shrimp (adding shitake and red bell pepper) a little ahead of time. Then made the pasta and threw everything together at the last minute. My only gripe is that the sauce didn't take on that nice "green curry" color.

I found this dish to be too spicy and the sauce was too runny. Won't make this one again.

I made this last night for my family and they loved it. It's so fast and simple to make and delicious. I used two pounds of shrimp instead of the scallops and it turned out great. It's a keeper.

I found it too spicy even when I added only 1/2 of what the recipe recommended. I agree, add the shiitake mushrooms and snow peas for more veggies and color. Otherwise, great dish!

Apparently this dish depends on the brand of curry paste. I used Thai Kitchen brand in a jar. One Tbsp was enough to kill.(we both love spicy food)Next time I'll use 1/2 tbsp. To save cost I would serve it over tofu or chicken. I also served it with Thai jasmine rice. Delicious!

BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. This dish tasted OK but I was disappointed, it wasn't spicy at all! I used KAME brand of green curry paste, do they come in different degrees of hotness? I followed the recipe exactly, so I don't know why it wasn't spicy, I also used serrano chiles for the topping. I probably won't make it again, since I thought it was a pain to make and expensive ingredients to boot!

Served this dish to experienced and novice curry eaters. It was a hit with all. I made it exactly as the recipe directed except I used light coconut milk with no apparent taste compromise. Loved it!

Outstanding!! The only adjustment I made was the addition of more curry paste. I will definitely be making this again!

This was really eazy to make. EZ peel shrimp take the REAL work out of this recipe. I would advise that the cook taste the sauce first before adding the extra chili at the end, my green curry paste was hot enough.

I made this twice with just large shrimp and some added vegetables--shiitake mushroom caps, a sweet red pepper, and snow peas and bean sprouts at the very end. The meaty shiitake mushrooms (and possibly the al dente bean sprouts) are a must add. Also, I skipped the noodles and served it over Thai jasmine rice. It was fabulous and so easy!

This was FABULOUS! I used about a tablespoon of green curry paste (I used Taste of Thailand - it comes in a sealed packet not a jar). I followed directions and sauted the seafood with the white part of the scallions, then threw sprinkled the green parts on as a garnish before serving. Actually, I ate this as a soup! The sauce was a bit thin to put on linguine, I thought. I served it for a friend and we were both licking the bowl and have been craving it ever since!

This dish has wonderful flavor and just enough spice to keep the fork going back for more! It was easy to make and very satisfying.

Very good and easy to make. I took the suggestions of previous reviewers and added garlic and ginger to the scallion saute. In addition, I used double the fish sauce, 1 1/2 times the curry paste, and 1 tsp of crushed garlic to the sauce. I garnished with fresh basil as well as the cilantro. Great with a Sauvignon Blanc wine.

Instead of the individual curry ingredients (coconut milk, curry paste, fish sauce) I cheated and used a Thai Green Curry sauce from Trader Joe's, which worked quite well but needed some salt at the end. I followed someone else's review and added shitake mushrooms and snow peas. Definitely spicy, but tasty and very easy.

I thought this was was quite delicious and not at all difficult. For those who thought it too bland, try using more fish sauce or add salt. Garlic and/or ginger are also nice additions. The quality of Asian ingredients used makes a big difference in intensity of flavors.

I don't know what brand of Thai green curry paste you folks are using, but one tablespoon of mine makes this dish lift off into the stratosphere! I suggest tasting before serving, as always.

I might modify it to include some green vegetables and eliminate the pasta, although we really enjoyed this dish very much.

Delicious. I used bay scallops and tiger prawns and cooked them together rather than separately. I also added some sliced mushrooms just because I had them. My husband and I both loved it.

I agree with others who found this, as is, too bland. More curry paste and fish sauce would help. Also, we add 1-2 cloves of garlic with the curry paste, etc. At the very end, we add 1/4 cup each of fresh basil leaves and coriander leaves, sliced. This makes it very authentic.

I also added shitake mushrooms, a red bell pepper, and bamboo shoots and it was delicious. I always saute shrimp and scallops in a little white wine and add Red Pepper. Gives it a little kick. Wonderful flavor and aroma.

Not bad, although I'd skip the scallops to cut down on cost. Also, I'd recommend adding a bit more of the curry paste to make it spicier. It's a great recipe to make for company-- fast and easy. Even my pickiest friends liked it!

I bought all those special asian sauces and was terribly disappointed with the outcome. Perhaps I didnt add enough, but this dish was bland! I added mushrooms which helped, but overall, with all those exotic sauces I expected way more. My Mom and husband were equally less than thrilled.

This was great! And easy to make too. My family really loved it.
