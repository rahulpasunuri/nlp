I am not rating this because I made the mistake of using a true stewing hen from a farm. A stewing hen is an egg layer that is no longer producing eggs. I couldn't even cut the meat of the breast it was so tough!!!! My fault; however, I did find the sauce to be very salty even though I really didn't season. Will try again with one of my pastured roasting chickens.

I made this dish many years ago and thought I would give it another go. It again was quite good. I was rushed and did not let it sit the required 8 hours but it was still a hit. I tried something different this time when thickening the sauce. I removed the chicken and reduced then added the paste and continued to cook then I took my immersion blender to the whole thing to get the giblets, ham and bacon very fine. Very tasty.

I like Julia Childs' recipe better (Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol.l). It is easier and doesn't produce as much fat, which has to be removed. I have never had to thicken Julia's recipe.

the two forks don't mean this is a bad recipe, but it means that it needs a bit of improvisation to make it exquisite. My first and big problem is the choice of a hearty wine as opposed to the Pinot as mentioned previously. Also to all us poor North Americans with our genetically engineered foods. I lived in Paris for a bit and everything I cooked tasted so much better. Nothing like waking up in the morning, going down the street to the market, and picking out the fresh meets, cheeses, and veggies that are going to be tonight's dinner.

If you made this recipe in Europe - you would not have 1 1/2 cups of fat.

Great flavor but... Did all of the reviewers keep ALL of the fat? Between the chicken and the bacon, I must have dumped a full 1 1/2 cups of fat out. There is no mention of this in the recipe. It also says to let stand at least 8 hours but you cook the mushrooms while the chicken cooks? Why not do the mushrooms just before you are ready to serve? The ingedients are good but the recipe is very poorly written

Excellent! I think the brandy really richens the flavors. I omitted the giblets and ham - didn't miss 'em. I also added whole shallots to the mushroom mixture (1st saute mushrooms and remove to a dish, then saute shallots and add to mushrooms mixture) which adds an important flavor component - coq au vin in France always has onions. Lastly, I am surprised that the recipe calls for a hearty red wine instead of a Pinot Noir. The type of wine you use will completely alter the flavor and COLOR of your dish. Coq au Vin is a Burgundian dish, and therefore is usually made with Pinot Noir. Pinot is generally lighter-bodied, less oaked, more acidic and has less tannins than most any other red wine, which makes it ideal for cooking and hey, guess what? Your chicken won't turn a ghastly dark purple... just a hint of color will show up in the meat. And of course, a Pinot Noir pairs beautifully with the meal. Serve with boiled new potatoes lightly tossed in olive oil and parsely. Like being in Dijon on a winter day.

This is a really great recipe and not as hard as one might think. The only problem isn't with the recipe but with the chickens you get in the US; they just can't stand up to good old fashioned stewing without falling apart. Madeline Kamman suggested adding a little (ironically enough) unsweetened cocoa powder to the mix. She said it accurately mimics the flavor of the chicken blood which is traditionally used in the stew. I don't know if that's true but it is tasty.

Mr. Healy, you must be joking. "Nuttier" taste? You, sir, are truly twisted. Wonder what your Valentine thought of your meal...

Haven't made this recipe yet (tomorrow is Valentine's Day and I plan on doing coq au vin. I am responding to the reviewer who lamented the lack of a decent chicken in American supermarkets. My answer: squirrel. It's the ONE meat I've ever had that truly tastes like chicken (dark meat) but has a richer, nuttier taste without any gameyness. Winter squirrels are the best because they develop more fat. They can be tough unless they are braised, but a simple wet. long cooking technique produced FABULOUS results. Trust me, "squirrels is good eatin'." I made a fabulous "squirrel jalousie" once- a fancy Frencg dish usually reserved for chicken. If you can't find squirrel in your supermarket (most can't) do what I do- invest in a birdfeeder and a pellet gun. They are not easy to skin and dress out, but their meat is worth the effort!

Great dish. Too much trouble to get a special chicken. I used one from Costco with extra chicken thighs. Make sure to take the time to flour the chicken and brown it properly. I cooked the chicken for about an hour, then took it out of the pot (so it wouldn't overcook.) I then reduced the stock on a fairly high heat until it was half the original amount. Also (to my taste) I doubled the amount of garlic. I think that following these steps makes all the difference in the finished recipe.

Great recipe! I have made Coq au Vin before, but always found it bland. This was great. I made a few changes tho. I added some prunes, which gave it some more richness and I did not let it stand at all because I did not have the time. It was fine. Can't wait to try it the next day!

I found stewing the old bird in it's own innards a little disconcerting, however the end did justify the means. Used an unusually robust Chilean Cab, and added boiler onions to the 'garnish.'

Haven't made this...yet, however, one comment to those who mention other recipes being better: For Pete's sake, do SHARE the recipe, or tell us where to find it! Thanks

There is nothing wrong with this recipe. The problem is that it is very hard to find a good quality chicken in the U.S. - unless you live in a big city with a large immigrant population. You need a chicken that is farm raised and walks around in the sunshine. You will never get great flavor out of a mass produced chicken.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but my family disliked it. I did use the liver and gizzards.

I've made this recipe many times and it is always a hit with my guest. Whats great about it is that you can make it a couple of hours ahead of time then just heat before serving.

Even though it was delicious, mine turned out a very bright purple. It was a very festive purple though! I guess burgundy wine was not the choice to use!

This is a favorite of mine, but I've never made it before now...will definately do so again. I did get a bit squeemish and left out the gizzards, but I didn't notice it lacking in flavor as a result.

Ihad always wondered why Coq au Vin was considered one of the great classic dishes; having tried a number of recipes for it from various cookbooks, I never found it more than so-so. Ah! At last, now I know! This recipe could make me love the French! (no offense intended). So, SO good!

very good. like so many recipes that call for only parts. a real C.A. V. uses a whole bird as far as it being a rooster, forgrt it. A large store bought is plenty good. I still like my recipe best. got it from a 5 table Restaurant that was in Carmel CA 40 years ago. If any one wants it e-mail me.

OK, I "chickened out" and didn't use the giblets, but BOY OH BOY did this tickle the taste buds. My recomendations: use a free-range rooster, DON'T use the ribs unless you know what you're doing (my guests and I chomped down bone slivers on more than one occasion...), and for Petes sake, use a hearty, flavorful wine! To accompany this dish I baked thinly sliced new potatoes in heavy cream, then topped and broiled them at the last minute with gruyere cheese. After eating this you won't be hungry for weeks; I promise. --t

I cooked it in a pressure cooker and omitted the flour to cut out the Carbs. The aroma in the appartment was incredible but the chicken really did need the time to sit after it had finished cooking. It was much better the next day.

Coq au vin is a wonderful blend of flavors, that compliment each other. The sauce is the key. It must be light in texture and consistency. The blend of bacon and ham bring out the sweetnest and make the dish balance with the liquor.

This recipe was simply magnificent; if I may be somewhat critical, there were no pearl onions, but that did not prove to be a problem at all. For the rue, I used a mix of wheat flour and all-purpose flour to give it a darker color, as well as a more distinct taste. It was not a recipe where I had to stand over the range and constantly watch over it; I was able to get work done while it was cooking. An easy recipe that will please any palate!

Absolutely the best Coq au Vin I have ever sampled. I can't wait to impress more guests with it. For those who miss the pearl onions, just do 2 dozen along with the mushrooms at the same time. Terrific recipe. Merci beaucoup.

Worst version of coq-au-vin I've ever tried. Where are the pearl onions? What's with the minced giblets? How about "browned" chicken stock? James beard is turning over in his grave on this one. Too much pork!

Absolutely THE BEST.....! My husband is French and rated this recipe as TOTALLY authentic..other guests at the same dinner ALL requested the recipe. Follow the recipe as directed....the dish marinates itself when prepared the day before...Flambed with cognac and a FULL bottle of St. Emilion creates magic... Hmmmmn....!

i used this recipe as the basis for duck in wine sauce. i made several changes, however, to give the dish more texture. first, i (like others) marinated the birds in wine, herbs, garlic (and ginger) overnight. i browned the duck pieces in bacon fat and then sauteed several veggies: carrots, onion, ginger, shallots, and garlic in the duck drippings. i added ducks, veggies, and wine to the pot and simmered for 1.5 hours. after that, i strained, reduced and thickend the sauce. results: delicious!!! serve with the sauteed mushrooms as a side or add them to the sauce.

Fantastic & easy! Used a bottle of Peller Estates Cabernet and it was luscious! The only suggestion I would make is to brown the fowl in a non-stick skillet instead of the stockpot (skin sticks easily). Then transfer it all to stockpot (including drippings). We had no leftovers!!

I made this recipe for my family using two large chickens. I marinated the chicken pieces in a 1/2 bottle of cabernet and 2 cloves of garlic with the bouquet garni for one day in the fridge. I cooked the chicken exactly as per instructions, adding the rest of the wine. I served it with fresh baked French bread, boiled potatoes and grren bean salad Being a lover of Coq au vin, i found this recipe absolutely fabulous, and would make it again..and again! ciao!

For a slight change of pace: Braise the fowl in marsala and 1 cup of vermouth or sherry. Use button mushrooms and tiny boiling onions. Add seedless grapes for the last minute of cooking. Serve with a Petit Sirah -- I recommend any vintage from Concannon. My favorite is 1977. Bon apetit!

I used the recipe with a pair of pheasant I bagged last Nov., with a slight modification. I marinated the cut-up birds over night in the wine, garlic and bouguet garni, then and dried and dusted with flour before browning, then added the reserved marinade and proceeded with the recipe. I served it with a Wild Rice pilaf, an Italian Hubcap and the same Cabernet Sauvignon used in the marinade-Excellent! (My next trial will be with cottontail rabbit?)
