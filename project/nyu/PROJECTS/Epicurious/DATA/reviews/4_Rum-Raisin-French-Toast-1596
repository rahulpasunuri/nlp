I first tried this recipe when it came out in the April 1990 issue and it was outstanding. I am not even a rum raisin ice cream fan. Can't wait to make it for my husband! I was very happy to find it easily again at epicurious.com

This was pretty good, but I would strongly recommend good quality, (bakery) thick-sliced raisin bread for best results. I just used store-bought sunmaid raisin bread, which was fine, but for company I would go the extra mile for great bread as a base. Good flavor and easy to make.

This was a hit when I first served it several years ago at our annual December 26 brunch, and we have enjoyed it many times since. I used Hagen Daz rum raisin.
