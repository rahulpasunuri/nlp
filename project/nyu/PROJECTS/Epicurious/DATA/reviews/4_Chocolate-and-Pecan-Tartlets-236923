I made these as a donation with the Chaine des Rotisseurs to the Empty Bowls lunch for the Vail Valley Salvation Army. They were there alongside desserts from big-named restaurants and everyone loved these. I didn't form the dough like in the recipe. That just was slow and didn't work well. So I divided the balls and put them in the cups just as in the recipe. Then I took each one and flattened into a disk either in my hands or on the pastry board. Then I put them in the cups and formed the rim. Those were much prettier. Had to bake nearly 10 minutes longer, though, to get the crust to the right color. We're at 8,000 ft. ASL, but that shouldn't affect it. Oh well. Be careful not to overfill the cups. The spills aren't pretty, but they sure are yummy. When they cooled and hardened......WOW! Lovely toffee good for vanilla ice cream topping. Can't wait to make these again.

Yes Linda45 you may omit the chocolate chips and they would be just like Pecan Tassies. Still totally delicious.

I have made these twice now and everyone loves them. They are just the right size for a little bite after Thanksgiving dinner. They are not overly sweet and the crust has a little zing from the cream cheese. The crust is easy to work with, my 10 year old can make them beautifully. I am wondering if these will freeze well

Easy and hard to mess up. The only downside is that it is time consuming. But worth it! I made them for the second time yesterday and didn't remember the part about refrigerating for 3 hours. I didn't have time to do that, and put the dough in the tins immediately. It worked fine, in fact might have been easier to work with.

I rarely make anything more complicated than cookies, so these were a mild challenge, but more than worth it. They came out beautifully, with lightly browned crust and everything. Delicious.

Very good recipe. Easy to make and a great mix of textures and flavors. Big hit at a dinner party I brought them to. I will make again.

I've made these several times and everyone always raves about them. I use raw sugar instead of brown sugar. The crystals are slightly bigger, which adds to the texture.
