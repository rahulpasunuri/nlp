Very easy, delicious and impressive appetizer. We served it with roasted beets and a balsamic reduction. (And a sauv blanc.) Our dinner guests raved. Will happily make this again.

We had this for our dinner group and it tasted fabulous. It was totally different than any other salad, but so good!

This is a 4 fork dish. It was my first souffle but the recipe was easy to follow and aside from them falling a bit, they were outstanding.

I had a problem with my egg whites, so my souffles were not as puffy as I would have liked, but the flavor was wonderful and very impressive for guests!

Very easy to make - served with a warm lentil, bacon and walnut salad on the side rather than the suggested. Next time I will wipe around the edges of the ramekins making a little edge between the souffle and the dish as this apparently makes them rise much neater. Delicious with the strong goats cheese all creamy at the bottom!

This dish was both easy to make (even for first time souffle-ers) and delicious! The goat cheese dollop (at the bottom) and the herbs added a great deal of interest. We were worried at first because the base seemed so thick, but it turned out splendidly!

This is delicious and easier to make than I feared. The grocery store was out of chives so I substituted a couple of small leeks (blanched first) instead. It worked really well. I served it with mixed greens and a couple of slices of good smoked salmon for a light and delicious dinner.

I made this for a bridal shower first course and everyone loved it! I did add more goat cheese, and next time will probably double the amount used - keeping in mind that I am a goat cheese freak! loved it - very easy!

Delicious! Made six small souffles with this recipe. Only had about half the amount of goat cheese I needed, so did three with that and three with bleu cheese. (Didn't try the vinaigrette.) Extra souffles reheated well in the microwave for the next day's lunch (not puffy, but still tasty).

The souffles were very good.... flavorful and pretty! However, I would NOT serve it with the raspberry vinaigrette. This vinaigrette is too tangy... any other light dressing will do!

Fantastic! Very original and so tasty!

Very good souffle recipe. Herbs and cheese go so good together. I did use a bit less goat cheese than what the recipe calls for.

Unbelievable, I have never attempted a souffle before, only tasted dessert souffles up until now! I loved this recipe. Substituted dried herbs for fresh (grocery store hadn't received shipment) also, no chives! Easy, easy, easy. I, like many others, halved the recipe. I also substituted a different salad. Arugala with dressing made from olive oil, lemon, pistatios, and a little balsamic. Put in small cuisinart. Poured on top of arugala, topped with pistacios and parmesan cheese. Great salad. Yummy summer night dish.

This was excellent and not too difficult. In a test run, I thought there was a little too much cheese at the bottom of the cups, so I placed a bit of sliced pear at the bottom of each cup to balance the cheese.

These souffles were so good (i love goat cheese!). Not hard to make at all, i made three 1.5 cup souffles instead of six 3/4 cup ones. served with the Roasted Garlic Soup from this site (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=100669) and a bag of spring mix. yumyum!

My first souffle! And so easy to produce. I halved the recipe for two one-cup servings and didn't use anywhere near the goat cheese called for. I only had on hand about a third of a log and when I make this next time will probably use about a half of a log. Didn't have whole milk, so used light cream cut with 1% milk. Turned out perfect anyway and the husband loved it.

Made this as primary dish for New Year's 02/03. Was nervous as I had never made a souffle in my life, but they came out beautifully. Used only baby spinach instead of mixed greens and made a blackcurrent vinigrette instead of raspberry.

Delicious and easy to make. I had never made a souffle before, and was surprised at how well these turned out. Will make again!

I too was thrilled with this recipe, and prepared it earlier in the day, up to the part when you beat the egg whites. It worked perfectly. Don't hesitate to try these. They're great.

Fabulous. Made it for a dinner party. Even the non-vegetarian's enjoyed it and asked for the recipe. From across the table, my fiance gave me the "thumbs up" and wants me to make it again. Delicious!

Like others, I halved the recipe & made two large servings. I skipped the suggested mixed greens & raspberry vinaigrette; instead I served it with mixed greens and a different dressing. So easy and very good. I think you could reduce the amount of goat cheese in the bottom of the ramekin and still have good results.

Did this for a dinner party of 14! You can make it up to the egg whites and do those just before you're ready to put it in the oven. My guests went crazy for it! I hate having a lot of things to prepare when guests are there, but this was so easy! Try it, you'll love it.

This was delicious, esp. the melted goat cheese on the bottom. I, too, halved the recipe and cooked it in two 1-cup ramekins. This makes a very nice warm weather meal.

I halved the souffle recipe for two 1-cup ramikins. Worked great! It was beautiful and delicious!
