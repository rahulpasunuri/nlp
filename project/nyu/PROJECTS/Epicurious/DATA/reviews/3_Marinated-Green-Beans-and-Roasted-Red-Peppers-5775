Light and easy and very tasty. I used yellow, orange and green pepper halves I had sitting in the fridge and it turned out great. My boyfriend ate almost the entire bowl.

This was a simple and delicious green bean salad. The roasted red bell peppers added enough interest to make the dish a repeater in my book. I cut WAY back on the olive oil, though. I used maybe a couple of tablespoons, and it was perfect for our tastes.

I marinated this for 6 hours and it didn't taste that impressive. It tasted wonderful the next day, however. Marinate overnight for good flavour. My oil-vinegar proportions were also 50-50, and it was still a little on the oily side. Great easy make-ahead dish.

Make at least 4 hrs in advance for better flavor, toss often while chilling. I use equal parts olive oil to red wine vinegar (unless you really like the taste of olive oil). I recommend that you taste 1 hr in advance before serving in case you want to add more vinegar, salt or pepper. A tasty side dish to ham, doesn't work as well with turkey.

Very blah. Wouldn't make it again. Better recipes for green bean salads elsewhere.

Too much garlic! Use less next time I make it.

MADE IT REALLY EASY BY USING TRADER JOE'S FROZEN GRILLED RED/YELLOW PEPPERS! FLAVOR WAS GREAT, MY GUESTS AND HUSBAND REALLY ENJOYED IT!

A simple, colorful and fresh side dish (especially on a blue and white platter). Everyone raved what a great idea plus you can make it the day before and it doesn't take up space in the oven. I added basil and thyme to the marinade. I will definitely make it again.
