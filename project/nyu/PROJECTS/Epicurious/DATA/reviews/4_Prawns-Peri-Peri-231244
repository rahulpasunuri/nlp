Excellent dish. I agree, there's too much butter, so I reduced the butter considerably, with no loss of the "wow" factor. I also made half the peri-peri sauce, since the recipe only calls for 2 tablespoons - I store the rest in the fridge for future use. Served this with some grilled corn on the cob, buttered, then sprinkled with chili, paprika, salt, and parmesan (some recipes call for queso blanco), with lime drizzled on last. Heaven...

This recipe is tasty but that may be more due to the fact that it's hard to screw up prawns then the recipe itself. There is way too much butter and Peri peri sauce called for. The recipe seems to ask you to use all the peri peri sauce, doing this will give you more of a prawn soup. I'd recommend using half the peri peri sauce and half the butter called for (at most), you will still lots of sauce left over to sop up with bread.

Superb! Quick, easy, and tasty!!! Followed the recipe and it was a hit with the whole family. Served with French green beans and brown rice.

This was excellent and easy to make. I served it as a pasta dish by adding mushrooms and chopped asparagus. In order to have more sauce, I simply added some of the water from the cooked angel hair. It was a huge hit.

Lovely lovely lovely. I tried it twice, once with the peri peri sauce from here and once more with a sauce that I bought from Nandos. Though both were good, I definitely vouch for the original recipe given here. Yeah, and I used a little less of the oil.

served this as an appetizer at a dinner party, and my guests raved - in fact, two of them followed me with forks into the kitchen when I was about to serve the next course, and ate the remaining prawns right out of the frying pan on the stove! I definitely would make this again - and have given this recipe to several friends who have also had similar success! this one is a keeper as far as I'm concerned!

The Peri Peri sauce is excellent with prawns as well as mushrooms. A must keep in the fridge at all times. I tried using sesame seed oil instead of olive oil as it is much cheaper in my country. The sauce actually developed at better flavour!

There should be less oil in this recipe but other than that its really good. Its easy and fast to make.

The broiled prawns are, of course, magnificant but this sauce, while decent, lacks certain key Mozambiqueno ingredients like coconut milk. I prefer my home version combining halapenos and red jalapenos and including cilantro and lime juice.

I tried the recipe, but only had dried chilis available. I think the sauce would be much better w/ them fresh. My guest still loved it, and I will try it again.

This dish is amazingly simple but the taste says otherwise. My family loved it to the last piece. To think that I used the peri-peri sauce few minutes after I made it, how much more after 2 weeks of aging? I'm definitely cooking this again.

Quick, easy, and delicious! The lemon, chilis, and garlic compliment each other very nicely. I enjoyed this dish so much I even poured a little of the extra peri-peri sauce over some rice and enjoyed it the next day! I'll definitely be making this dish again soon!
