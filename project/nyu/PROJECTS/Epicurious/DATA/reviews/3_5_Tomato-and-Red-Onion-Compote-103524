I have made this compote to go over the chicken with paprika, cinnamon and oregano at lease twenty times now and continue to get amazing reviews from guests every time. it is a great variation on grilled chicken and salsa with a unique flavor that always has guests asking about its ingredients. It also could not be simpler!! The only change I make to it is to add a tiny splash of good balsamic vinegar to the compote while bringing it up to heat. I am making it today!

Simply delicious, good fresh flavours.

Good but not great; basic and not worth making again.

Fresh tomatoes are terrible here now, so I used canned in the compote and let it simmer a little longer, turned out great. By itself it would be rather boring, but with the Grilled Chicken with oregano, cinnamon and paprika it is perfect.

I really enjoyed this recipe but I think I will use fresh basil the next time. A small amount of balsamic vinegar is also a possibility.

This recipe really shows that simple foods are often the best foods. My husband and I were really impressed with the flavour. The trick is to NOT OVERCOOK the mixture. I put everything into the skillet after I took the chicken off the barbeque - then, straight to the table. Excellent!

Great with the Grilled Chicken with Oregano,Cinnamon and Paprika recipe! I added a little kosher salt before serving.

We had this with thin sliced roast beef and thought it was great. Quick, easy. But I think the key is the ingredients; fresh, real tomatoes just came on the market in northern Ontario. Winter ones just wouldn't do the same job. I added a splash of balsamic vinegar and a bit of fresh chopped basil...delicious!

What is all the hoopla about. I made this for dinner tonight and it was YUK!! - and that's being kind. As other reviewers mentioned, this is an easy recipe to make, so there isn't much to screw up. That being said, I know I didn't make a mess of things - it is just not much of a good thing. We had it over chicken, with rice, and we will be throwing the rest of it, along with the recipe, away.

This is a new family favorite. We have served as a hot dish, cold, and at room temp. You just can't go wrong with this as a side dish.

Very easy to make! I served it over rice with the Grilled Chicken with Oregano, Cinnamon and Paprika. It would be a good vegetable dish on its own.
