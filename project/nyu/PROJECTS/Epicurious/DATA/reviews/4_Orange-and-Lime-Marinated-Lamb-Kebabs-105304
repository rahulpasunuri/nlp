Excellent kebab recipe- we used deboned shoulder instead (home-raised!) and it was delcious. I couldn't find pasillas so used anaheims but still delicious.

A pleasant change to the palate for a lamb lover. Great summer recipe.

Excellent! Served this at our Gourmet Club and it was a huge hit, even better than the more expensive beef tenderloin kebabs. Key is to marinade at least overnight. The meat was so tender and great flavor. This is a four fork recipe and it will become a regular for us.

This is one of my favorite recipes, this makes the lamb so tender and so tasty. I have served this over and over again when entertaining, and have gotten raves reviews from everyone. This is definitely a recipe where the lamb shouldn't be overcooked.

I used chicken instead of lamb and it was fantastic! The poblanos were a perfect touch.

This marinade is killer. I left out the chilies in adobo and it was fantastic!

I have made this dish many times. The lamb kebabs(medium rare) are outstanding. I have also marinated flank steak and chicken in the marinade. Both good. Sometimes I don't have fresh oregano(used dried), I never measure exact amounts, usually double chipotles and garlic, and simply add cut up lime shells to marinade(instead of grating). Must let sit at least overnight. Always delicious.

These lamb kebabs were a huge hit at a recent dinner party. I've made them twice--the second time omitted the poblano chilies as I prefer the kebabs with just lamb and onion. This will definitely be a staple in my recipe box.

These lamb kebabs are extremely yummy. The marinade gives the lamb a wonderful taste. It's even good cold!

Looking at the ingredient list I was positive that this entree would be spectacular. It wasn't. I'm going to make this agian and marinade it twice as long and I'll probably double some of the spices. And finally, I'm going to be a jerk to whomever is commanding the BBQ to insure that they don't over cook them this time!!

this is our favorite lamb marinade so far! subbed lemon juice, orange-peach juice, dried oregano and baby bell peppers because that is what we had on hand...was wonderful-will follow the ingredients next time.

This marinade is great on pork, chicken and tofu too!

Excellent marinade. My children even enjoyed this dish. I've used lamb sirloins and cut them into chunks. I can't wait to try the other recipes from Bruce Aidells. The burgers and the steak are also great in this article!

The marinate with the lamb was a great tasted great. Was afraid the poblano peppers would be to hot for my family so I used red and green peppers potabellas and purple onion with the lamb. Will make again.
