This was very good and an interesting combination of flavors you might not guess would go well together, i.e. capers and mint -- but they do! I used about 2 cups of fresh cherry tomatoes cut in half plus a very small amount of water instead of canned tomatoes and it worked quite well. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The onions were semi-caramelized which was great!

I don't like capers in hot food. I like them in salads. For me it was a waste of courgettes. Not my thing.

this elevated the zucchini (I only used 2) and was really simple. I'm sure I'll make it man7yy tines.

Yum but I substituted olive paste instead of capers - a sprinkling of Parmeson added favour as well

Excellent! Would make it even if I weren't up to my ears in zucchini. Took advice of Montreal reviewer and browned zucchini. As Houston reviewer so rightly commented, it's the mint that makes this dish special. The multi-layered flavours are exciting, even with bland old zucchini. Also great the next day as cold salad!

As other reviewers recommended, I reduced the mint and added parsley. The flavors are richer when the zucchini is browned a little and the tomatoes are added afterwards. Nice side dish.

Leave out the mint?! The mint gives the dish a fresh from the garden taste and contrasts well with the capers. A scrumptious way to eat zucchini.

I have already made this dish twice, and omitted the mint each time, as suggested by a reviewer. I really liked it, all the flavors blend very well together, and I will surely make it again!

I liked this zucchini dish, but it doesn't really strike me as anything that special or out of the ordinary. It actually tasted better the next day after it had a chance for the flavors to blend.

The mint was a bit overpowering so next time we'll leave it out (or cut it way back). The other ingredients were a tasty treat.
