The skin was very good and crunchy. We had to cook the fish a few minutes longer than specified. I used prepared Boar's Head creamed horseradish,saving a lot of time. I did not have the greens so I served it over salad - next time I would do spinach (salad ok, but wilted some). Only had samll red beets, not baby ones. I pressure cooked them for 15 minutes whole and then proceeded. Interesting and new way to cook fish. Would make again.

Nice recipe for char. I was intrigued by the beets - one of the most under-appreciated veggies on earth. Also, does anybody else think that the serving in the photograph looks really huge! Must be a small plate. As a main course or entree, I'd say a six ounce fillet is on the large side. As a fish course, 4 oz. is plenty!
