Slight modification: chopped watermelon into small cubes, reduced feta to 1/2 cup, added juice of half a lime, and fresh Moroccan mint. Served as a verrine with a small spoon as an hors-d'oeuvre. Perfect on a hot summer day. Burst of fresh flavors. Was a big hit. So easy to prepare, will do it again.

A big hit for the 4th of July! everyone loved this salad, I put black pepper and omitted red pepper flakes but will try that next time. Great recipe!

The peppercorn mix I use includes allspice, and that makes this even better. (I did not use the red pepper flakes.)

This was an interesting and tasty way to serve watermelon. I made it both with an without the mint, and think it adds a nice touch. I also added a bit of lime juice as suggested by another reviewer.

I had all the ingredients in the fridge and I couldn't wait to mix them...so I just ate my first bowl of this dish for breakfast - and it was great! I used low-fat crumbly feta, a lot of black pepper, watermelon, a tiny dash of lime juice and fresh mint. It was a beautiful bowl of white, green and pink with tiny black flecks and it tasted like summer. I also tried a few bites with creamy feta (not as good as crumbly) and with a sweet balsamic reduction drizzle (not necessary and a bit distracting from the other refreshing flavors). Be sparing with the lime - just a little is enough. I'm usually a salt lover, but this did not need any salt. This dish would be absolutely perfect for a BBQ.

I made this for guests last night, and like many other reviewers I used fresh mint instead of red pepper flakes. I agree with what someone else said; if you have finicky eaters this may not go over, but for those who enjoy trying new things, it's a winner. It was a new combination for all the people at my table, and everyone loved it.

Susan is a fantastic chef. She catered my wedding and last two birthday parties. This salad is superb, but what seems to be missing is lime juice. She squeezes lime juice over the watermelon, and that gives it a very unique flavor. And no need to skip the black pepper. It works.

Very nice. I added some black olives as the feta wasn´t salty enough for me.

This is delicious and so easy! I skipped the red pepper flakes and added chopped mint. Used a mild French feta that was not too salty. Served alongside ground lamb kebabs. Perfect contrast to have the cool and fresh watermelon with the hot and spicy lamb kebabs. My older son who likes feta loved the salad as did all the adults. This is definitely a keeper.

This was a great hit with young and older folks. I nixed the pepper and only used the mint.

Made this with a quarter watermelon, 4 oz. feta (the dry kind worked well, as another reader suggested), 2 sprigs of mint, and some ground black pepper. It was fantastic!

A delicious combo. Better with dry/crumbly feta than creamy. Based on other reviewers' suggestion, I use fresh mint instead of red-pepper flakes, and it's a hit with everyone in our family.

Innnnteresting... followed advice and added mint. That might have been our favorite part, followed by the pepper. Then the feta. Really, such a simple dish that's certainly different. Good. And I may make it again. But I would not serve it to people who were at all finicky.
