I really like this recipe, but I did change a couple of things--substituting balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Makes a huge difference.

Gosh this is dreadful. By the time you finish tweaking it, it will be a whole other recipe. There are other, better potato salads out there.

This recipe was ok. My 2 cents worth would be to add 1/2 cup mayo, 1 green pepper, dash of cayenne pepper, 1 vidalia onion and 2 tbsp of dijon mustard. Mix and eat. Delicious. Serve warm

I ad such high hopes for this recipe because the combination of the ingredients looked so delicious. I have no doubt that this recipe could be good, but it need a lot more of a lot of different things. I tried a variety of additions, but nothing made it better. As it stands, this recipe is very dull and flavorless.

A great potato salad receipe. Instead of cider vinegar I used Balsamic vinger (I just like the taste better.) I served this on Christmas Eve during a small get together. The dish got a great response. Because it should be served at room temparature, I could prepare it early and worry about more complicated dishes.
