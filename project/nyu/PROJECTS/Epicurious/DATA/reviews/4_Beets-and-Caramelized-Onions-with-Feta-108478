Excellent. I used home-roasted golden beets because I had some on hand and served it over baby leaf lettuces. The dinner included Roast Chicken with Mustard Vinaigrette (epi), and a Trader Joe's basil-ciabatta-flatbread that I topped with sauteed mushrooms and garlic, then heated up in the oven.

Very good. I used canned beets and forgot the pine nuts. Pretty tasty though. Maybe it would have been a little better if the beets were warmed through a little. Nice flavours and colours though.

I'm a novice and this was a super easy recipe. I used canned beets (whole were hard to find but found them on the third try) and served the dish at room temperature. I mixed in the nuts instead and I mixed in the feta at the very end with only a couple stirs so that it wouldn't pick up the beet color too much. Love this dish and I wasn't a big beet fan until now. Actually made it a second time a week later.

I'm giving this four forks because my husband and I have hated (hated!) beets in the past but we liked this. Plus it was very easy to make. We got beets with our CSA share and felt obligated to use them. I chose this recipe because it had a 4-fork rating and used ingredients I already had in the kitchen. We used goat cheese instead of feta. Since I was using fresh beets, I roasted mine (four medium/small beets) first. We ate it all up in one sitting.

We received beets in our CSA and I had no idea what to do with them. This was pretty good, I think we just aren't a big beet family. I would make it again if the CSA sends us more beets. I roasted the beets, as suggested by abcooks4u and served it with goat cheese rather than feta. We ate it as a salad over the beet greens (which I sauted for a couple minutes with the onions).

YUMMY...used fresh beets, golden and red. Served over a bed of arugula and spotted the beets with goat cheese rather than feta. I have beets for the week and that makes me happy!

Very good! I roasted my fresh beets: pre-heat the oven to 350, putting a little olive oil on them and a little salt, wrap them in aluminum foil and bake for at least an hour until they are soft (poke them with a fork). Take them out, let them cool, and then you can peel off their skins easily. I used about 4 small beets (I will weigh them next time! :) I left the pine nuts whole and didn't toast them since I could only find 'roasted' pine nuts in the store. The whole thing is fabulous. I agree to serve it warm.

Everyone in my family was sort of upset when we got beets in our CSA box--no one wanted to cook them or eat them. I made this recipe with a few adjustments, roasting the fresh beets in olive oil and garlic beforehand. I didn't include the dressing because it was more of a saute (no mustard) and I left the toasted pine nuts whole. But it was FANTASTIC. I didn't like beets before but now I would venture to say that I would even buy fresh beets from the store so I could make this again. The blend of sweet, roasted beets with the other flavors of the dish was utterly perfect. I sincerely believe that this is the best possible way to eat beets. My friends and family absolutely LOVED it. Everyone wanted seconds; we didn't even have enough to go around.

Making this again for the second weekend in a row; seems perfect with lamb for the Easter meal. I can't tell if it should be warm, chilled, or room temp, so I'm going with room temp again, same as last week. Outstanding. (And I just might try it with goat cheese one of these days...)

We get bimonthly produce boxes, and beets have come in the last three (and my beet hating friend gives us hers), so we've been looking for more creative ways to use them. This was easy and delicious, a really great mix of sweet and salty/bitter. Also great cold for lunch the next day. I peeled, sliced, and boiled my beets and added them warm to the onions and dressing. This probably won't convert any die hard beet-haters, but may convince some on the fencers that they like them after all.

Fantastic dish!!! I was never a beet lover, much less even liked the root. However, when I tried this recipe, I fell in love with it. It is truly addictive. I have turned it on to many of my non-beet lover friends and they now rave about it. I never regret it if the party doesn't eat a large portion, because that just leaves more for me!! Bon Appetit!

Excellent. Used fresh roast beets and a very mild feta-like cheese (manouri), otherwise followed the recipe to a T with good results.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! I tried it on impulse, having all the ingreedients on hand. The one comment I would make is that I used fresh beets, prepared (boiled, peeled and quartered) and it turned out MARVELOUSLY. I just barely undercooked the beets, which turned out to lend them a still-crunchy quality, to compliment the softness of the carmelized onions. All in all, this is an amazing, useful and easy-to-use recipe, bravo!

This was Fabulous. I did this with roast beef and it went very well. I used the fresh beets and roast them- very easy. The caramelized onions are easy as well and the combinations are great. I found the dish tasted even better the next day when the dressing had a chance to truely soak into the beets. A make ahead dish for sure.

I have made this recipe SEVERAL times with both fresh beets and canned. Yes the fresh is better but it you are pressed for time the canned works well too. Delicious, easy and a crowd pleaser. I agree don't chop the pignoli's (pine nuts) and I like a little more sauce so I added more vinegar and mustard. Use a GOOD mustard of course. YUM Even if my poo is red! :)

We are slowly trying to produce more of our own food. Since we live in Wisconsin, this means eating vegetables that can keep over the winter. That includes beets. My mom served store bought canned beets when I was a kid. I hated them. YUCK. So it was not easy to make this recipe and there was no way I was going to use store bought canned beets. My first alteration to this recipe was to roast fresh beets. To roast them, I cut off the greens, scrubbed them, dryed then, coated them with olive oil and put them cut side down in an oven proof skillet. Set the oven to 375F. Since I was roasting the beets, I decided to roast the onions too. To get nice caramelization, I used Vidalia onions. Peel off the skin, cut them in half, coat with olive oil, spinkle with salt and white pepper, put them cutside down in the same skillet as the beets. Put in the oven for about 90 minutes - the top of the onions were just starting to brown. When the veggies are done, take them out of the pan and let them cool a bit. Deglaze the pan with balsamic vinegar. Reduce for a while. Add the dijon mustard and salt and pepper to taste. Peel the beets. Cut the beets and onions up. Coat with the sauce, feta and toasted pine nuts. The results...that distinctive beet taste is still there. My wife loved them. I experienced cognitive dissonance. I think they tasted good, but I kept having flashbacks to childhood. Next time, I think I will peel the beets before I roast them and I will saute the beet greens and add them to the mix.

Very delicious. I recommend not stirring feta in, but sprinkling over the top. It turns pink if stirred from the beets! I also use either homegrown beets or farmer's market, rather than canned.

Our son made this dish as the 'side' for Thanksgiving dinner yesterday, and already I am gathering the ingredients so that I can make this again, and again and again!

A Warning. This is going to be an indelicate review, but I write it because I wish someone had warned me ahead of time. First, it's a very nice recipe. I roasted fresh beets, as recommended, and liked the dish quite a lot. It wasn't miles better than the fresh beet salad with onions at my local Whole Foods, but it was good. Now, many people have claimed that non-beet lovers devour this dish. Not in my family. Nooooo ... it took serious bribery to get my husband and children to try even a bite, and a single bite was all they would take. So, for my family, the power of this dish to convert non- beet believers was quite limited. What did that mean? It meant that I got to eat three servings of beets a day for a couple of days. This is where the story gets indelicate. No one told me that eating truckloads of beets can alter the, um, appearance of, um, well, the things that go on in the W.C. So I am here to warn you. If, like me, you wind up eating several pounds of beets, do not be surprised if you pee purple ... and do other things I cannot bring myself to say. Other than that, enjoy the beets!

Great recipe, but you have to use good cheese. Unfortunately, we are currently residing in Vancouver, BC, where it is insanely difficult to get decent cheese without paying very high prices (spoiled Americans!). The $6 feta that we purchased - the only one the store had - was horrible. We did use fresh beets, as many others have; they were yummy, at least. (As an aside, the NY Times had a great article about beets - apparently, roasting them is the best way to get the excellent nutrients from them). Will try again - with feta brought over the border!

Wow! Like some previous reviewers, I used fresh beets (that was the whole point -- got some from the CSA and didn't know what to do with them) roasted at 400 for ~1 hour. I also turned out not to have any mustard in the house (what???), so I coarsely ground some mustard seed, mixed that into the dressing, and then let it sit for a while while I finished the prep. The beet-roasting and mustard-grinding made this take waaaay more than 45 minutes, but it was worth every second. The sweet, earthy flavor of the beets was nicely punctuated with the zing of the mustard and vinegar, and the feta and pine nuts lent a clean and luxurious swing. The boyfriend is so adamantly anti-beet that he refused to try them, but all the other non- beet-eaters at the table sampled and then went back for more, including my beet-phobic father and my sister's veggie- phobic boyfriend. There was plenty else to eat -- they weren't just being polite.

I had an abundance of beets in the garden, some very large. I was looking for something "different " to make with the beets and the reviews for this recipe looked favorable. I made the recipe basically as directed, however, I felt that the onions should be truly "caramelized". Since I, like many other reviewers prefer the roasted beet method over the canned beets and for obvious reasons (I had a ton), I cut the top from each beet, scrubbed throughly & wrapped individually in foil. I roasted them for 1-1 1/2 hours on 400 degrees, until tender. Wearing gloves, I peeled while still warm under running water @ the sink. I also cubed my beets into bite size pieces. While the beets were roasting in the oven, I sliced the onions (I used red) thin cross- wise placed them on a foil-lined jellyroll pan sprayed lightly with cooking spray. I then brushed them with a mixture of equal parts (1-2 T each) Balsamic Vinegar, Honey & Olive Oil (stir together & then brush onto onions). Roast until tender and caramelized. You won't regret it. I do tend to prefer my beets with a little sweetness & tart that the honey & vinegar provided with not being overly sweet or tangy. When serving, if you don't want your feta completely "pinkish/ purple", I agree with previous reviewers for appearance sake to sprinkle atop beets after mixing the remainder of the ingredients together. Overall, a very nice recipe that I will be making again.

I first made this dish about a year ago with canned beets and loved it. During a recent trip to the grocery store, I scored some pre-packaged, steamed and peeled baby beets (www.melissas.com), and tried this recipe again. It was delicious. I ate so much that there aren't any leftovers for tomorrow. I will never go back to the canned stuff.

Rating: 4
Love it! Even friends who don't like beets love this. I wouldn't use canned beets. Rather I wash fresh ones, boil them unpeeled the day before I want the salad. When they're cool I rinse them under cold water and the peel rolls off. I used a special dijon mustard from We Olive in Paso Robles that contains lemon and it added a wonderful subtlety. Lacking that mustard, I'm sure fresh lemon zest would do it. Be sure and toast the pine nuts, otherwise they disappear and they're expensive.

Great way to serve beets. Made this twice. First time was exactly according to recipe and it turned out terrific. Second time, I subbed balsamic vinegar for the cider vinegar, and slivered almonds for the pine nuts. It did not go over as well the second time. I would not make these changes again. The husband says he also thinks I used more feta the first time.

unbelievable. cook the onions lovingly with some salt and pepper. this is my staple beet recipe, now. it's also great with chevre instead of feta. fresh, steamed beets are absolutely worth the effort. if you're serving it to others, sprinkle the cheese on at the end for a nice contrast between the red and white.

This is one of the best beet concoctions I have ever had! I made it with about half the oil and it was delicious... in fact I am gobbling the leftovers as I type so all the others in the house sniffing around the leftovers will not get it! I made it with roasted beets, but I think canned (non pickled) ones would be superb as well. Easy, fast, pretty, healthy, textural, lots of flavor... I am making it again tomorrow and all the neighbors are getting some too! I have LOTS of beets!!!!

The first time I tried this I made a half recipe, since I was eating alone. I figured I would have some leftovers for lunch the next day. I ended up eating the whole thing and putting away the rest of the meal for the next day's lunch! Delicious and addicting! I have made this dish several times and like it best eaten warm. I also used fresh beets, but like the previous idea of roasting them. I will have to try that next time.

I can't rave enough about this recipe. It is a perfect blend of flavors. The only change I made was using fresh beets instead of jarred. I chose a sweet variety of onion (comparable to vidalia) and it carmelized beautifully. Try toasting the pine nuts in the oil just after you remove the onions. I liked this dish best at room temperature, but it was delicious cold as a "leftover" as well.

Awesome side dish!!! Instead of cider vinegar, canned beets, and feta, we used white balsamic vinegar, fresh beets, and goat cheese. While the taste with goat cheese was fabulous, we can see how feta would be better based upon presentation. After mixing the goat cheese, it created a pink and pastey coating that did not look real nice. Next time, if we only have goat cheese, we will just sprinkle it on top for presentation sake. Also, note that when using fresh beets it takes a considerable time to cook. This is a keeper!

Since I LOVE beets, I took the added step of buying fresh (gold and red) and roasting them the night before. I prepped all the ingredients before and assembled it while the roast was resting (I served it with beef tenderloin).
