As a Englishman living in the US I must tell you that this recipe is for bread and butter pudding and not bread pudding, there is a significant difference.

this is a really nice bread pudding recipe. i just can't figure out why it comes up in a search for bread pudding made with stevia instead of sugar. why is it search-tagged for stevia? for myself, i'd make this recipe any time, it looks great. but the person for whom i am caregiver can't have sugar and would prefer not to eat at ALL but MIGHT be tempted to eat if the menu includes things like sugar free bread pudding. so this mis-tagged recipe wasted precious time and energy. not that you're the only one that does this; i must have looked at a couple dozen bread pudding recipes with "stevia" in the search terms and no stevia in sight in the recipes, just sugar. why??

If you want to simplify this recipe (not that it needs it!), skip the raisin soaking and use an artisan bread with dried fruit baked in. I used a fresh loaf of cranberry pistachio, skipped the toasting and buttering, and got a great dish full of what tastes like fancy french toast!

Great simple recipe, perfect for customizing with whatever you have around the house. I added dried cranberries and pecans plus three extra eggs. I cut back on the sugar because I find it's too sweet with the whole cup of sugar. Great for a quick dessert, everybody loves it!

This was my first time making bread pudding and I loved the simplicity of this recipe. I went ahead and added some dark chocolate chips to it and it turned out delicious! I am looking forward to making it again and to keep experimenting with different additions. Such a great easy recipe to salvage old bread and make a treat!

Soak your raisins in bourbon, drink the rest!

This recipe is basic and delicious. You can add what ever you desire. To this basic recipe, I added 2 extra eggs, used half and half, added dried apricots, almond extract and vanilla as well. I toasted the bread for extra texture. Happy Holidays.

This was my first ever bread pudding recipe and I loved it. I have made this now using several variations because I rarely have raisins around. It is really good with cut up apples and chopped walnuts.

I made this and it came out wonderfully. You can easily substitute apples for the raisins or use both. Also you don't need cinnamon as the other ingredients add flavor and sweeten the pudding. If you'd like you can try the following: I pre-soaked the raisins in a coffee tasting cooking wine (sorry I love to cook but don't have the terminology). Every time you bite into the pudding the raisins release their own flavor-- delicious. I also chose not to toast the bread in the oven-- why? Because I used all the bread, the crumbs and the sides, so in every bite you get a soft chewy piece and little harder piece. Lastly I suggest pouring the egg mixture onto the bread and letting it soak a bit just so that the bread really sponges up the mix. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.

I made this recipe with Italian loaf instead. The recipe is ok a bit too sweet. Next time I'll use 3/4 cup of sugar instead and I felt there was not enough egg mixture to cover the pudding. All in all it is an average recipe and a good basis to build upon by adding fruits, nuts whatever you'd like.

I'm giving this three forks because it was good, but nothing special. It is a standard bread pudding recipe. I used about 1/3 a loaf of homemade bread, I first added only 1/3 of the custard, but his barely covred the bread so I made another 1/3 and cooked it. It worked well. I also omitted the butter and toasting part.

Loved the recipe, and after making it a few times I have modified the ingredients. The best version ever was this: *Slices of chocolate pannetone instead of bread (but have also made it with bread and it was great) *dried currants as well as raisins. I used about 1/3 cup *2/3 cup sugar instead of a whole cup *5 eggs instead of 3 *1/2 tsp almond extract in addition to the vanilla *about 1/2 tsp ground cardamom in addition to the cinnamon.

I make this puddding all the time. I collect the ends from the whole grain loaves I buy every week and freeze them. When I collect enough I make a batch or two. Great warm with Vanilla ice cream!

Very easy and, according to my husband, very good. I used 1 cup cream and 1 cup milk. Rich enough but not too rich.

Savory, simple bread pudding. I, however, have always considered bread pudding a salvage procedure of sorts and did not want to use a whole fresh loaf. This recipe turned out well with all the spare bagels, hard fresh bread, and bread butts that I have collected in my freezer for a few months. I was skeptical at first, but don't skimp on the vanilla!

I have made this many times to the delight of all who have eaten it (even when I used skim milk). I do not butter the bread though. I just make sure that the bread I use is good and stale (and use bakery quality bread at that). I then soften the butter and add it to the custard. Real vanilla bean (scraped) instead of extract. A fabulous non traditional alteration is to use cherries instead of raisins (good frozen ones thawed and strained). The flavor combination of the vanilla and the cherries, and the textural intrest... unbelievable!

I'm not sure if I'm missing something (every other reviewer seems to've loved it) but I can't say I'd make this again - it was just...blah. The only reason I'd eat it is because of the creme anglaise I made to go with it.

It's hard to believe this was so easy. I had an extra loaf of bread in the house, so I made this. It was a huge hit. Skipped the raisins and added a bit of extra vanilla.

Ever since we started making this recipe, it has been a favorite request at any party or gathering we attend or throw.

I used eggnog instead of milk & vanilla (I had some Silk Nog on hand), and substituted an apple for the raisins. Splendid.

I just finished the recipe. It is delicious. I used regular raisins instead of golden and diluted evaporated milk instead of whole milk. Creamy, rich -- really tasty.

Amazing flavor and texture, and so easy! I used 2% milk and only 1 tablespoon of vanilla because 2 seemed like a lot and baked it in a 2.5 quart glass dish. Next time, I may cut down on the raisins, though, perhaps 1/4 cup less than called for. But even with a rather large amount of raisins, this is a fantastic dessert.

This is a very easy recipe to make, but I use Brioche dough instead of white bread, and I replace the vanilla extract with coffee flavored vodka
