These were good, I'm trying to turn my boyfriend onto brussels sprouts but as he pointed out "I'm not sure if I like they or if they just take good with so much cream on them." You need about half the cream required here, I ended up dumping a lot of it out.

This is the best ever and easy brussel sprout recipe. It is my go-to recipe whenever I serve this vegetable. Not too heavy, great blend of flavors. I have made it with whole sprouts and ones cut in half- it is worth it to cut them in half. I also toast my pine nuts in the toaster oven so they are toasting while I do the rest of the recipe. If I don't have shallots, I use either spring onions or regular onions finely chopped. Super delicious!

Well, my expectations were already high with all of the reviews of "they don't taste like brussel sprouts" but even with the cream, butter and pine nuts they still tasted like brussel sprouts. My personal opinion is that brussel sprouts can only taste good cooked in duck fat and I would not make this recipe again, even though it's creative.

What a beautiful introduction to brussels sprouts! Of course, I'm just excited that I learned to say "brussels" rather than "brussel". See, I'm learning every day. Amazing recipe. Out of 14 diners, 12 were having this fabulous greens for the first time. A big hit. Who knew? I had to settle for dried marjoram due to availability, but let that simmer in with the stock to ensure it was soft and released its flavor. Also - ran out of pine nuts last week, and forgot to get them at the store. Prepared the dish with chopped hazelnuts instead, but of course, forgot to add them in. Didn't miss it. Maybe it was fate. We couldn't get the kids (ages 3-10) to scarf these down, but the adults did - even the finicky ones! Highly recommended!

All I can say is WOW!! I actually stumbled upon this recipe, as I only wanted to boil my brussels sprouts. However, I just happened to have all of the unused ingredients sitting around from a previous recipe. This was fantastic and I'm so glad I decided on this. This is an instant family favorite.

I have made this dish twice. My husband loves it. The second time around, I made a few changes that improved it: cut the cooking time by half (sprouts weren't overcooked this time), added garlic and thyme, cut the chicken broth in half, and offered finely grated parm to the kids. I will definitely make again and will keep trying different herbs and additions.

Wow! This was fabulous. I served them with the rabbit ragu from this site. It was incredible. I didn't have whipping cream, so I used coffee creamer. The brussel sprouts were fresh, but this would be an awesome comfort food recipe. I will definately make these again!

I made this ahead but not as discribed. I made the pine nuts and shallots ahead. Then an hour before serving, I made the sprouts just until tender. Before I plated I added the 1/2 & 1/2 with the nuts and shallots. It was great... will no again.

Great recipe. I agree it is versatile and "dumbs down well." I didn't have any shallots or fresh marjoram on hand so I used red onion and dried marjoram. Also skipped the cream because I did not have any, but next time I will make a point to include it because I know it will make it outstanding.

I did not saute the brussels sprouts first. Just cooked them in the broth. Sauteed the pine nuts and some onion, in half tablespoon of butter. Omitted marjoram and added greek yogurt just before serving instead of the cream. A great dish. Might try some garlic also next time.

I make this recipe "vegan" style - with vegan butter, soymilk and vegetable broth replacements. It tastes awesome and I am sure preparing it this way cuts down on much of the fat and calories in the original preparation. Also, I do not use the 3rd tablespoon of butter and shallots (as a personal preference).

We have made this recipe 2x, and would have made it again but the sprouts had bugs. It is SOOO good. We had no shallots or pine nuts the first time so I used walnuts and garlic and it was fantastic. I also added some dried dill. We had a 12 year old to dinner and she loved it too! Highly recommended.

Rating: 3
I tried to see if I could produce a suitable lo-cal version without being too fancy about it. It is definitely possible to use 3 tsp instead of 3 Tbsp; I also tried 2% milk, which gives it a very, very light but tasty sauce. It would be delicious without sauce altogether, but I'm something of a sauce lover. I also tried it with chicken fat, since I had some. Probably the same calorie load as regular butter, but I can report that it is a tasty alternative.

I have always detested Brussel Sprouts, perhaps because of the way most people cook them and their bitter taste. This recipe made me a fan! I halved it, all except for the pine nuts, and it was wonderful with simple grilled chicken and couscous. Definitely a keeper!

This turned out pretty good even at a half portion and is quite easy to make. Also a cashews are a tasty substitute

I followed the recipe exactly and it was good but not great. If you make this, it's very important to get sprouts that are approximately the same size so that they cook evenly--otherwise some will be mush and others will be crunchy. And important to get the small, tender ones that aren't so bitter. This doesn't really work very well to make ahead and reheat as the sprouts lose color and texture--and it's pretty fussy for a side dish. I'd suggest serving it with something simple like roast beef. I made it to take to a Thanksgiving potluck and reheat (because my hostess asked for brussels sprouts) and was sort of disappointed.

Doubled reciepe, but used only 1/3 c. pine nuts. Everyone at our Thanksgiving meal loved them.

Good, easy recipe. I made the following substitutions based on what I had in the kitchen: thyme for marjoram, half-and-half for cream, half onion and a garlic clove for shallots, and almonds for pine nuts. Nice flavor, light cream sauce, and the nuts are essential! Would make again as intended with marjoram. My foodie mom really enjoyed this recipe as did I. Husband thinks he likes epicurious "sprouts with wild mushrooms" better although cooking the sprouts in broth in this recipe really cut the bitter flavor of the sprouts which he liked. Would be tasty to somehow merge the two recipes.

I eat brussel sprouts alot and these are very good. The cream, nuts and marjoram lend a really nice flavor and neutralize some of the inherent bitterness. I used 2% milk instead of heavy cream and added a few pinches of cayenne to kick it up. I don't use any salt in my cooking but this dish didn't seem to miss it. Also, I didn't simmer covered for a full 7 minutes because I didn't want mush (thanks for the hint prior posters). Definitely a nice change of pace. I don't think any brussel sprout recipe could be beyond compare for me.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and there were raves! My son, who never met a brussel sprout he liked, said he had turned a corner, and liked these. Because we had 16 for dinner, I made one batch with b. sprouts and one with carrots. Used pine nuts on the sprouts and slivered almonds on the carrots. Used half and half, which was fine.

Never in a million years did I think I would like brussels, but this recipe has made me see the light. I make these quite often with a couple of modifacations -- I use a light version of cream that is available in Australia (thickend with gelatin, not fat) and have great results. I don't usually have shallots on hand, but I find an onion does the trick just fine.

This is easily my favorite brussels sprouts dish! Using this recipe, I have gotten so many people to eat brussels sprouts who normally hate them. I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe. In fact, I've changed things a couple times because I didn't have the right ingredients, enough time, etc., and I can tell you this: It is important to halve the sprouts, and both the shallots and the pine nuts add a lot to the recipe. Enjoy!

I used a bit of cooking spray to coat the pan for the shallots and the sprouts, because I don't care for butter. It cooked up just fine without it. It's a good way to omit some of the fat, too.

My family loves Brussels Sprouts, but in spite of everyone's worry that I was making a mistake in deviating from the usual steamed with butter recipe, I decided to try something new with them this year. Everyone agreed they were wonderful and requested the recipe be used again. The only problem I had was they were way underdone (the brown-rice vegetarians in the crowd didn't agree, btw..they said crispy was always better). Next time, I would steam the sprouts separately, then add them to the delicious sauce for a few mintues to finish up. Absolutely terrific sauce that I want to try on other vegetables (cauliflower and brocoli? carrots and parsnips?).
