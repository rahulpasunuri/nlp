I served this over spice cake, with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream.... My guests gave it RAVE reviews!!

I used pears, and it turned out AMAZING. I served it on top of the Spiced Waffles the recipe is supposed to go with, and everyone who ate it was amazed.

Do you all think this could be used as an Apple Pie filling, maybe even if I omit the cream as suggested in review #1?

I used this as a filling in the epicurious recipe for caramelized banana purses. I omitted the cream, used half light brown sugar and half white sugar, and added cinnamon and toasted walnuts and pistachios. My guests loved it.

Excellent! This recipe received rave reviews - I've made it a number of times. The only "suggestion" came from my 14 year old son - he wanted more of the "gooey stuff". Flavor is excellent! Easy to prepare & makes plenty!

Try this over Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream - apples slightly warm, ice cream frozen well. It's rather like an upside down apple pie a la mode! Quite tasty.
