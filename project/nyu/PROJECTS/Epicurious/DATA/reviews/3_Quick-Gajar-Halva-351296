I don't really feel that it's fair for me to give this recipe a rating as I deviated a lot from it. To make it healthier, I used skim milk. I don't know what I was expecting to happen overall, but it was a little bit of an odd texture. I liked it, and the raisins were really nice pockets of sweetness, but I don't think I would serve this as a dessert unaccompanied. Maybe over a crumble-type crust or ice cream?

This is a good start. I substituted condensed milk for some of the cream and sugar and I cooked it much longer at a very low temperature so it simmered, gently rolling. My Indian BF says ignore the suggestion to serve with yogurt. It makes no sense and is not traditional. Instead, he recommends slivered almonds.

I dont understand why would you want to serve this with yogurt? yikes! in India, this is a winter-time dish prepared on a real low flame, in large quantities and simmers for a long time while all liquids evaporates. khoya(form of condensed milk) is also added. And we top it off with roasted nuts like almonds, cashews and pistachios! My mom would make it with just the right amt of sugar :) no more, no less. Oh, I miss those days!

Very tasty (if you like cardamome). It would be a nice treat in a lunchbox.

I used fat-free evaporated milk instead of the cream and cut the sugar in half...much lighter and still delicious (and still very sweet!).
