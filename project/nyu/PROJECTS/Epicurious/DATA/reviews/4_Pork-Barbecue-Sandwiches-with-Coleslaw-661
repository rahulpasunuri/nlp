Yes, it's a lot of work but more than worth it for dinner parties and picnics. I use the crock pot to cook the pork a day ahead so there's more time on party day for other food prep.

This is an outstanding recipe. I have made this dozens of times over the last 10 years, always on the Weber. The sauce, rub and mop are important components of the final flavor. I frequently receive requests to make this dish from friends and everyone hovers around the bowl sneaking tastes while I pull the pork. The only problem is that it requires a significant time commitment to monitor the grill. Plan on a full afternoon to make this recipe, no toss in the oven and take a quick look every two hours with this one.

I made this recipe when it was published in 1995. I'm excited to find it on- line as it was outstanding when I lived in NJ. Now that I'm in a barbecue area I'm psyched to make it again. Be sure to do the coleslaw also. First time I used the oven and I'm debating about the slow cooker.

This was my first time making barbecue and it was absolutely delicious. I used a 4lb pork shoulder, omitted the mop, and into the crock pot for 8 hours. It fell apart when I got the forks out to shred it. My husband and I both disliked the barbecue sauce and wound up using some we had bought from our favorite barbecue place instead. Our 7 year old gobbled it right up (sans sauce- said it smelled like feet)! It tasted even better the next day at work for lunch. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

This is by far the best bbq I have ever served. Instead of using the grill, I put the rub on the pork and place it in a crock pot for about 12 hours. Once it's cooked I shred the pork and make up the bbq sauce, return the pork to the crock pot add the sauce and servel. So easy and delish! (Omit the mop when using the crock pot.)

The first time I made this, I found it fatty but with good flavors. The second time I made it, I trimmed some of the fat off and let the rub sit on it overnight. I slow cooked it at 275 for 6 hours and mopped it the last couple of hours. Sadly, there were no leftovers.

Well, I must not like bbq much. I smoked 30 pounds of pork butt today on the gas grill with hickory chips, followed the recipe for the rub and mop but still...this is greasy stuff. I will definitely go with a less fatty piece of meat next time and skip the mop which ran off anyway.

This one is a definite keeper for me and if I could give it another half fork, I would. I too made it in a slow cooker (although I'd love to try the Webber version soon) for 12 hours with about half the mop.The shoulder I used had quite a lot of fat on it and I should have trimmed some off before slow cooking 'cause it melted off and almost overflowed my pot!!! The only other suggestion I would make is to reduce the amount of vinegar in the bbq sauce to about a cup or even 3/4 as we found it too vinegary.I served it in a bowl on the side so people could add as much or as little as they wanted. And for sure make the coleslaw!!! The crunchiness matches the tender pork in bun perfectly.

I made this with a pork loin, and it was probably one of the best, least dry pork loins I have ever had. I rubbed the prok loin with the dry rub, let it sit for about a half an hour and then put it on the grill. I put it in a disposable pan with some mopping sauce in the bottoma nd continued to mop it for about 4 hours. Simple and delish!

I made this for a party- used about 12 pounds of meat, 14 people and not one little bitty piece of meat was left. I cooked the meat in the oven at 300 for 6 hours, covered. I started out basting with the mop sauce but got tired of doing this so just added the mop to the pan. When the meat was done I shredded the meat & put it in a crock pot, strained the juices into a bowl & then put the juices in the freezer. When the fat was solidified I removed it & added the de-fatted juices to the crock pot. Served with homemeade fresh rolls with the BBQ sauce in a salad dressing (Good Seasons) bottle. Can you say finger licking good. I also made the coleslaw-was OK. Used 2 bags each of shredded white & red coleslaw & added shredded carrots- makes ALOT of slaw. Maybe some shredded onions would have added some more flavor. All in all it was a very easy, delicious meal.

Used the technique from the person in Arlington, VA: 250 degrees in oven for 6 hrs (though 7 might have worked a little better because when I probed it after letting it sit for 10min, some parts were still 170F and the parts easier to pull apart were 190F). Added 1 tsp of liquid smoke to the mop sauce (only had to make 1/2 the mop sauce and didn't finish it all). When I tried some after pulling it apart, I thought it was too peppery, but then remembered that the BBQ sauce didn't have any pepper or salt in the ingredients, so I figured it had to be mixed. Tasted great after mixing and the stuff refridgerates well for making sandwiches later during the week (microwave the meat for 45sec and toast the buns). Definitely scrape off the orange fat that shows up when you put it in the fridge. Even when you microwave it after dooing this, it oozes quite a bit of fat...

Used this for a 20+ person party. Rave reviews, many asked for the recipe. The hardest part was shredding the pork, that did take time. This is definitely a plan ahead dish with all the smoking & shredding. I did use the bagged slaw which saved cabbage chopping time.

I made this recipe using 2 whole pork shoulders (with shank)...about 15 lbs total. I removed the skin but left a bit of the fat under the skin for flavor while roasting. I slow cooked them in the oven after applying the rub (which I let sit for about 24 hrs). During cooking I marinaded the roasts with the mop. After cooking I pulled the pork apart as per the directions but I waited to put the barbecue sauce on until the dy of the party. I really like this recipe. I even froze some of the meat after I pullled it apart. When I defrosted it, I prepared it by sauteeing some onions in olive oil, adding the meat to heat and then some of the barbecue sauce. It was delicious this way. The stuff I didn't freeze I prepared on buns like the recipe directed. I also made the coleslaw but left out the barbecue sauce. This is a great party recipe.

YUM. I did this in the crock pot...gasp. Cooked it for 14 hours. Needed it for lunch so started it the night before. It was awesome. Just used the rub and the sauce. The sauce is great.

The barbecue sauce is very good. Make sure you simmer it for at least 1/2 hour to achieve the right consistency. Living in an apartment, we cannot own a smoker or grill so I put the pork in a 250 degree oven uncovered for six hours. I used the mop sauce but added a little bit of liquid hickory smoke. It turned out great! Our guests had rave reviews! Great recipe.

The pork was tender, juicy, & very tasty. I have used this recipe on both a roast & on baby back ribs. My husband couldn't get enough! I will definitely make again

UNBELEIVABLE!!! I would make this over and over. We used a big dutch oven and cooked it for 12 hours in the oven. We made 20 lbs and it still turned out so tender and just fell apart. The sauce was a hit! It is the best sauce I have tasted, and will make it for other item s as well.

These sandwiches were fabulous!! We had a party of about 35 people, so we tripled the recipe and since we don't have a smoker we slow cooked it in the oven for about 11 or so hours at 225, and it turned out so tender and wonderful...everyone raved. And everyone loved the coleslaw too!

I just submitted the review below, then realized what the problem might have been. I had just bought a new bottle of paprika, not my usual brand. I tasted it just now and it is hot rather than "sweet". That was probably at least part of the problem!

As a crockpot novice I'm sincerely thanking all the crockpot user suggestions. This pork came out soooo good my husband doesn't think grilling is necessary. I used the rub and let the country style ribs refridgerate overnight. I made half the mop and put half of that at the start and the rest a half hour before the cooking was done. I also added 1 very large onion cut in eighths placed under the pork. I think the barbecue sauce sounds good, but cheated and used a commercial sauce. The shredded meat and chopped cooked onions were delicious with the barbecue sauce and the coleslaw.

Made this just as described and the crowd went wild! I loved the coleslaw so much I make it all the time with other foods as well... but the pork was supurb. Lots of work at the BBQ but in our opinion, worth it.

Made this for a crowd on labor day with the following changes: Used slabs of pork ribs with the rub and then put them is a slow (250 degree) oven for 5 hours. Skipped the mop. Then used the sauce, as printed, to finish the ribs on the grill. Everyone raved. Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar in the sauce sligtly as the sauce was a bit suite for my taste. Might also add a bit of lemon juice and/or cayenne for a bit more bite. Found the slaw to be so so at best.

I have made this recipe on the Weber, in a crockpot, and in the oven, down at the beach in North Carolina (not all rental houses allow open BBQ's for some bizarre fire-fearing reason). Anyway, my relatives think this is the Nirvana of BBQ. Don't worry too much about the rub ingredients: the key too this pork is LONG and SLOW cooking. If you haven't started it by 10 a.m., don't bother. This recipe is fool proof and well worth the effort, especially for a crowd. Awesome!

Crockpot? Please! If you can't smoke it, at least cook it with dry heat in a 225 degree oven for 8 hours or so. A crockpot is the worst type of compromise for anything. BLECHHHH!

This recipe has become a standard at our home. Because I like to make it in the winter as well, I often use my oven rather than the grill. Just set the oven temp to 245 degrees, insert a meat thermometer and let it cook for a good part of the day.

Another Pompus Texan? No one here would argue that their crock pot method is best, but not everyone has a Backwoods Smoker (www.backwoods-smoker.com) sitting on their back porch. The crock pot is a satisfying substitute for the real deal (smoking). No matter how you slice it, pork rules!!!!!

Great Dish. Perfect at home or to bring to a picnic. I've made it several times and have reduced the pepper and salt a bit, rubbed it the day before and cooked it in the oven at 320 well covered for about 3 hours.

Wow! eventhough there are so many comments on the recipe I wanted to add my own praise. This is a no fail, easy, time efficient crowd pleasing dish. I did make this in the crock pot only because december in Utah is cold and snowy and not the time to BBQ. I put the rub on and let it sit over night, placed in pot with half the mop and cooked for 10 hours. The meat was so tender I had to spoon it out. Served on baguettes and let people put on as much ar little sause as they wanted. This surely bacame one of my favorite entertaining foods!

This is very good. I also used a crockpot and used boneless pork shoulder strips. I put the rub on and chilled it for 4 hours, then "browned" them on the barbecue before putting them in the crockpot. Drained the meat after and chilled the sauce so the grease could easily be removed. Then put everything back in the crockpot to warm & serve. Great with onion rolls and a slice of swiss cheese!

I make this in the crock pot. I don't use the mop, just the rub and sauce. It's FANTASTIC! I do the same with a whole chicken and it makes the most moist chicken I have ever tasted. This is going to be a staple dish in our house!

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday. On Saturday, I cooked the pork in the crockpot and refrigerated it. I also made the BBQ sauce on Saturday. On Sunday, I pulled the pork and reheated the sauce and poured it over the meat. I put it all back in the crockpot and kept it on low. People could make their sandwiches whenever they were ready. Both the meat and the sauce are really, really good. This is a keeper.

I prepared this dish in the oven and it was easy and delicious. I baked it in a covered pan at 350 degrees for about 3 hours. I used the rub as stated in the recipe however, I added some orange juice(1/4 cup) and a little brown sugar to the mopping sauce. In all I only used about 1/3 of the mopping sauce. After removing the meat from the pan and shredding it, I defatted the pan juices and poured them back over the meat. My friends and family loved it. The ability to prepare it before your guests arrive is a big plus.

Absolutely wonderful. The best barbecue sauce I've ever tasted! I prepared the pork in the crock pot, applying the rub the night before. I skipped the mop. I used 1 tsp of the cayenne, which gave the sauce a nice kick.

This is by far one of the best barbeque sauces, but you can save alot of effort if you cook your pork in a slow cooker. I did use the same rub, but merely added 2 teaspoons of liquid smoke and enough water to cover the bottom of the slow cooker. No watching....no extra heat in the kitchen on a hot day, and no need for extra basting with a the wet mop.

Excellent. I made this for 25 people at a party and everyone loved it. I did the rub 36 hours in advance, then cooked it in the oven at 250 for 11 hours. It was so tender, it just fell apart. I did the rub and mop "as is". It was perfect. After cooking, I just pulled the pork apart and mixed in purchased BBQ sauce. It was a big hit. I served it with the Hot and Smoky Baked Beans (also on this website)

We made this recipe for our Memorial Day BBQ and what a hit!! It was the first time using our smoker and it was a great recipe to start with. I am not always a fan of BBQ since it tends to be very vinegary. The BBQ sauce was perfect since it uses more brown sugar than most recipes. I compared this to the "Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwhich" (Bon Appetit July 1999) recipe and decided to go with this one since it would be sweeter.

This recipe is tops! I made it last year for a family party, and it was such a hit that I'm making it today for my son's 1st birthday picnic.

This recipe is fabulous, even though it takes TIME! Get your arm ready to crack those peppercorns! We have taken these sandwiches to 3 tailgating events, and have had bystanders offer to pay for a sandwich. The aroma is unforgetable. To make life easy, we use a smoker instead of a Weber - either way is delicious!

This is a good introduction for a backyard cook to a classic southern barbecue form. The overall recipe and technique is very good, though I hope users will expiriment once they are comfortable with the basics presented here. Two suggestions: 1: be sure to use natural hardwood charcoal (not the typical supermarket kind that contains coal and other adulterants that will ruin the taste of this dish); 2: be sure to use the cheapest white bread or buns you can find. This is fun food, not gourmet food! Keep 'em smokin'! Yer pal, RubDMC
