Fish is disgusting. Water is no place to live.

We enjoyed the recipe immensly but instead of using the this dish as a cold dish we used it hot and just changed a few things around. The potatoes and fish were cooked as the recipe stated and the vegetables were cooked according to the recipe while the fish and potatoes were kept warm. Instead of the dressing given we used Zesty Italian and added wedges of tomatoes, black olives and feta. It was a hit and will be cooked again.
