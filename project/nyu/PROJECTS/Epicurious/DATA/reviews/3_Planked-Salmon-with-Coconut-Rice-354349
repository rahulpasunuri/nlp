Overall a good recipe. Seems to be missing a good sweet:salty ratio. The rice was sweet and fragrant, but so was the fish. I think maybe I would use this rice with a miso-glazed cod to get the balance. The dish was really easy to prepare in a casserole dish and foil.

Didn't work for me...not enough flavor and the marinade dripped onto the pan after being drizzled because it wasn't thick enough. I like the oldest planked salmon recipe on this site more...I just stick it under the broiler for a few minutes and there's more flavor.

I think next time I'd double the marinade and cook half down as a sauce because even though we marinated the fish longer than 10 minutes it was sort of bland. Love the cedar plank, used the grill instead of oven so enjoyed the smoke. The rice is bland also, we only had light coconut milk but I don't think that was the problem. I'd add some garlic and ginger to the marinade also, maybe a bit of crushed red pepper. It was ok but not great.

This turned out really nice! I didn't bother with the plank, so I baked the salmon in a shallow glass dish. It turned out great this way, because there was a lot of delicious marinade in the dish to drizzle over the fish before serving. I do agree with previous reviewers that the coconut rice was a bit bland, but no worries. I added a little more salt, pepper, and about a tablespoon of ground cardamom. Wonderful! The flavors of the salmon, marinade, and rice complemented each other so well! I also served sauteed baby zucchini on the side, and it was a great way to complete the meal. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is fantastic and easy! The marinade for the salmon has just the right amount of sweet & savory. I actually made the salmon part of this recipe twice in the past few weeks because I enjoyed it so much. The rice was really good... just a little bit bland. I may need to enhance that a bit next time I make it.

3.5 stars. Definitely a keeper recipe for a mid-week meal - skip the plank and otherwise cook as directed. The rice flavor is not becoming on its own but complements the salmon with marinade very well (used brown basmati for health - have never introduced white rice to my kids). I will include this in my regular salmon recipe rotation.

As an American student, studying abroad and living on both a budget and varying access to specialty foods, I found this to be an extremely rewarding dish. Following other reviews, I couldn't get cedar planks, but a baking dish still yielded a great salmon, with far less time involved. I did also substitute orange blossom honey for maple syrup because I had it on hand and don't like maple syrup so much, with fantastic results. Pleasantly surprised by not only how easy the coconut rice was, but how well it complemented the marinade flavor.

I forgot to buy the plank, so I baked this in the marinade, at 375, in a glass baking dish. It was so perfectly poached and flavorful, and the marinade thickened to a perfect sauce for spooning over the finished fish. Also, the leftovers worked nicely flaked over a mesclun salad with some wasabi vinaigrette. For the rice, my family likes it with a handful of raisins tossed in, and a tiny pinch of cardamom.

If you soak the plank as instructed, it should not smoke.
