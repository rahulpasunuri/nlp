I used 1 stick of butter and 1/4 cup of oil. I also only baked the cake for 30 minutes. This cake was very moist and light but I found it to be a bit salty. I would make it again though.

As many other reviewers note, this cake is somewhat dry and does not need 50 minutes in the oven. More like 30 to 40 at most. Also not sure what they think you are going to do with 3 cups of toasted almonds. Try about one cup, maybe 1 1/2 tops. Added cardamom to the spice mix. The frosting rocks.

I am an American who has lived in Bavaria Germany for over 30 years. This means every Christmas I get the real Lebkuchen, but this cake blew my German husband away and since then this is the only thing he wants at Christmas as does the rest of my family. thanks

The first time I made this cake the frosting was to-die-for, and the orange basting sauce was great, but I found the cake to be dry and needing more spice. I was desperate for a show stopper dessert to take to a German theme dinner party, so my husband said "Can't you just increase the spices and add an egg or something?" I did add extra yolk, and also modified the technique a bit: cream the butter with a mixer until light and fluffy before adding other ingredients. Then cream the sugar with the butter until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time (I added an extra yolk) beating well after each. Then continue with the recipe, adding more of the spices. The white chocolate frosting is expensive so you may want to experiment with an unfrosted cake the first time. This is now my special occasion cake. The flavors, particularly the frosting, are great!

So many issues with this cake. I cooked it for 30 minutes, following the advice of other reviewers, and even then it was too dry, although the basic flavor was good. There was way too much frosting, and I thought it had a horrible taste -- I might consider trying it with dark chocolate. There wasn't enough of the honey syrup, and the minced peel was too chunky -- if I make it again, I will grate the peel right off the orange, rather following the directions in the recipe. What a disappointment.

I finally got around to making this after years of holding on to the recipe and drooling over the photo. The only change that I made was to bake the cake in a round 9" pan instead of a square one. I didn't bake the cake for 50 minutes (starting checking at 30 and pulled when middle finally seemed to be done), but it still came out very dry. There was way too much frosting for this cake. I think that half the amount of frosting would have been enough. The flavors were very good -- it would have been great if the cake was moist and if I didn't drown it in frosting. I don't know if I would ever try this again... so many cakes, so little time.

I made this cake for Christmas this year for my family of lebkuchen lovers. We decided to make the frosting with dark chocolate (about 70% cocoa) and to omit the currants. I think either dark or white chocolate could be delicious, depending on personal preferences. I also spread the glaze over any part of the cake that touched frosting, which gave the whole thing another dimension of flavor. It was delicious and everyone loved it!

This cake is so wonderful! We also changed to dark chocolate frosting...it was the best frosting recipe I've ever used. The cake is moist and flavorful. We only needed to bake it for 30 minutes.

I made this at Christmas for the family, which includes a somewhat picky eater. I left out the currants (not a big fan of dried fruit in baked goods) and made the icing with 60% dark chocolate instead of white (again, not a big fan of white choc.). The cake was a huge hit, even with the picky eater. There was so much icing left over that everyone spread it on the other baked goods we had, so I would reduce it by 1/3 next time. The cake was very moist and the spices and chocolate complemented each other very nicely. My brothers-in-law loved it so much they wanted it for breakfast the next day!

My friend Harriet made this cake for a German themed dinner last night. She is an exceptional baker and this cake showed off those skills dramtically. We can't decide whether we like the moist, spicy, currant studded cake or the SINFUL white chocolate frosting more!! She did note that she cooked the cake for far less than the time called for.

I was thrilled to find the recipe online for this cake. Similar to another poster, I made this cake when the magazine first ran the recipe...it was such a hit that I had it made for my wedding the following December. Okay, so maybe the wedding wasn't as successful as the cake....but the cake is a KEEPER!!! ;-) Enjoy!

This is a great cake. We like dark chocolate with gingerbread flavours. I'm thinking of doing something with marzipan and dark chocolate for next time.

I made this recipe when it was first published. My family still talks about that incredible cake I made for Christmas one year. I haven't made it since as I didn't keep the issue it was in.Am trying to decide what to do for Christmas Eve this year and am absolutely delighted to find this recipe here. Give it a try...it's delicious!

This is a great holiday cake. I made this cake a few years ago for a party; people devoured it! I intend to make it again this year for my office holiday party. Good luck!
