Not knowing what to make with the organic eggplant and okra (not normal purchases of mine), I tried this stew and found it delicious! I served it over quinoa and both my husband and I enjoyed this meatless and healthy main dish.

2.5...mega blah...added tons of cumin, coriander, salt and pepper and still it was bland. But for a dish with okra, the sliminess was rather minimal. It's not bad, it's just that epi has better recipes. ;-)

This is an exceptional and unusual blend of flavors. It makes up a hearty and satisfying side or main (with rice or couscous) either cold or warm. Flavors definitely 'mature' and deepen on the second day. Highly recommended!

I used frozen peas instead of okra, and at least tripled the spices... used lots of red pepper and some cumin to give it some kick. It definitely was better on the second day, but overall, it was rather forgettable. A good basis for a stew, but definitely something that needs family-by-famiy tweaking for taste.

I made this dish as I was looking for a new way to cook okra. I substituted fresh okra for the frozen, mini Japanese eggplants, and, as I couldn't find zucchini at the market, I chopped up some fresh pumpkin. Didn't add the parsley, as not a fan. Turned out quite nice -- tangy but sweet with the pumpkin & apple. Like others, the veggies didn't need the full 40 minutes to soften -- I think I had them on for ~25 minutes. Will definitely make again in the future.

This has now become one of our standard vegetable side dishes! Love the sweetness the apple adds, and using a combination of one green and one yellow bell pepper added even more complexity. I cut both zucchini and japanese eggplant into rounds so they would hold together nicely, cutting the underdone pieces in half only near the end of cooking. I had to leave out the okra, but 3 generations of our all-American extended family enjoyed seconds of this last night at dinner, even my small-appetite mother. Didn't miss any seasonings -- salt, pepper, lemon and parsley are more than adequate for this. Served it with rice and grilled chicken.

I am always looking for good vegetable recipes. I followed the recipe exactly. After I finished, it was completely bland -- a ratatouille but not as good. I added some cumin and let it sit for a day. It was good as a side dish to tonight's dinner. But the apple doesn't make up for the fact that the dish really doesn't have any herbs, spices or interesting flavors.

If you like ratatouille, you'll love gouvej. The okra and apple make it milder and sweeter than regular ratatouille. (Play "guess the secret ingredient." NO ONE will guess it's an apple. And it's a good way to sneak okra into folks' diets.) It's great with grilled lamb or chicken--make it ahead and serve it reheated or at room temperature.

This stew was just OK. It lacked a bit in flavor; perhaps a bit of spice would have made it more interesting. My husband made a face on the first bite, so this is NOT a repeat.

this was very good, but much more like ratatouille than stew. it would be good with pasta as well. i would definitely make this again, good vegetables and flavor.

This was very good and had more flavor than I expected. I will make it again when I am in the mood for a healthy vegetarian meal.

Well, I am an amateur cook at best, but I was able to make this recipe taste wonderful on the first try. Had the skeptical friend asking if he could take an extra serving home with him! I substituted cucumber for the zucchini because they are fairly similiar in shape and color and I am apparently fairly illiterate. Yummy!

My daughter and grandson are vegeterians. I made this for them to eat but all of us loved it. Had to give the recipe to everyone.

I'm following the South Beach Diet and am always on the lookout recipes that fit the plan. I made this exactly as written. It is fabulous, hot or cold. Great flavor, great texture. A perfect dish: filling without guilt. Will definitely make again.

It was good, and healthy. Could be taken in a variety of directions, most readily as a side dish. It's a lot like ratatouille. I would add more garlic and a little more olive oil at the end. I cut the black pepper in half but would add some back next time.

Excellent. I followed this recipe basically as is, except towards the end when I added two minor ingredients, fried tofu and a small amount of grated cheese -- artistic liberty. I added these ingredients for two reasons, as a source of protein and to counter the acidity from the tomatoes and lemon. The added protein allowed me to service it as a main dish. I have to say I loved this stew and will definitely make it again.

Claire, on behalf of those of us who look at the cooking "glass" as half full instead of those who think otherwise, I apologise for the aggressive rudeness of some on this website. I happen to be Slovak - American, cooked your recipe to specification, and it was wonderful! PS - I'm also a chef by trade (23 years). Keep up the good work!

I made this last night and all including 11&18 yr olds loved it. The vegetables take longer to saute than you would think, prob 30 min. Served over coucous & orzo mixed with homemade hummus, pita bread and a green salad. We will do this often.

These are supposed to be reviews, not guesses. I really don't care if someone "thinks" it will be good; I read the reviews to learn the opinions of people who actually prepared the recipes.

I havent made this recipe yet, but I read the ingredients, and I think it will make an excellent vegetarian dish

Although I have not made this recipe, I notice it is missing spices other than garlic and salt. I add cumin to my vegetable stew and it is excellent.

I am looking forward to trying this stew but wonder if 40 minutes is the correct time to soften the vegetables...it seems alittle long.

It is a delicious version of a Ratatouille.
