We call this "Blizzard Chili" because we made it for the 1st time in Feb 2011 during the blizzard. I swapped out the potatoes and used great northern beans instead (couldn't get to the store that day) and we loved it. Easy and tasty - I usually serve it with cornbread and have the usual add ons like cheese, sour cream and chopped green onions.

This is an excellent way to use up all of the carrots and potatoes I receive in my produce box throughout the winter! I have made this twice in two months and have frozen it in one-cup servings for easy weeknight dinners. It's super flavorful and easy to prepare. I especially love it with heirloom beans.

This chili recipe is way better than my old chili recipe. The red bell pepper and chili sauce really give it extra flavor. We did omit the pototoes the 2nd time we made it because they don't seem to add much to the overall flavor, and just made it heavier. We'll keep making this recipe.

Fantastic! For the liquid, I used 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 red wine that was open anyway. It added a richness to the chili that was unexpected and delicious. Highly recommend serving with fresh avocado, creme fraiche or sour cream, fresh tomatoes, and salsa. Yum!

Yes the potatoes and carrots sounded strange and my family when it was done commented on that. But I reminded them that it was two-bean chili with vegetables. Everyone loved it! So, this will be my new chili recipe as winter moves in. Plus, so easy to make.

Forgot to mention that we thought the potatoes and carrots sounded a bit odd, however, after having eaten it, I'll never make chili without them again. A very nice addition and twist!

This chili was great other than one main thing. The chili sauce was too dominant. Instead of enhancing the chili, it overpowered it a bit too much. I've reduced the amt. to 1/4 C. on my recipe for next time. Also I added 2 jalapenos without any seeds or pith. It was just the right heat. Not too hot and not too mild. Other than the chili sauce, the chili was quite good. I will most definitely make this again. I'll have to write another review then. DO try this recipe. It is nice and hearty. Be sure to make cornbread in an iron skillet to go with it. Perfect combo!

Great and easy. I am sure the recipe is excellent as is. However, I did add some sliced sun dried tomatos. I used Ground Elk instead of beef (Elk is extreemily low in fat and high in protien - Elk meat is easy to burn,so use a little olive oil when browning). I like my chili a little more soupy and so added one 12 ounce dark beer.

What the heck is chili sauce?

Very easy and hearty meal. I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it! I used ground turkey instead of beef and added 1 can of corn and 1 can of black beans to the dish. The only thing that I would change for next time would be to add more potatoes. Other than that it is sure to be a staple in our house this winter.

I made this vegetarien. I cut out the meat, and I subtituted beef broth with vegetable broth. I also tossed in 1/2 cup of fresh cilantro, 1/4 cup of fresh basil, 1 tsp of hot pepper flakes. I added an extra potato, I threw in a cup of frozen corn and I added 3 bell peppers. Half a bottle of spaghetti sauce to thicken things up. The whole family loved this-- even though they are all meat eaters. VERY satisfying, it had a nice bite to it.

I made this chili without the potatoes and carrots. It turned out well and I will make this again.

Very tasty and great for cooking for a group of people. I skipped the potatoes and used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 turkey sausage meat instead of the beef and the flavor was great. My boyfriend's not a fan of substituting turkey for beef and he never knew the difference. I think this could easily be completely vegetarian and would still taste great.

I thought it had great flavour. Would make it again for sure.

I've been making this recipe for football parties for two years and it is always a hit. I usually substitute ground turkey and chicken broth instead of the beef, and sometimes leave out the potatoes. Always gets raves!

I made a double batch using Italian style turkey sausage. I added my own "measure" of cumin, chili powder, and red pepper flakes as well as 2 packets of chili seasoning mix. Won first place in our Halloween chili cook off out of 15 entries. Rated as outstanding!!

We made this with ground turkey and chicken broth in stead of beef. It was great served over brown rice and also leftover without the rice but with cornbread on the side.

I thought this was a great chili recipe. The addition of the vegetables was great, which made for a very hearty dish. We served it over rice, but would also be good over a baked potato or on nachos. I also drained the beef after browning it, which wasn't mentioned, but was a necessity for me. Enjoy!

This turned out to be exactly the chili we needed for our housewarming party. Great flavor, lots of textures, and it held up well with reheating.

Well received by family and friends. Added extra chili powder. Added 1 habanero pepper which I happened to have on hand. Added 1 diced red pepper. Quite good.

This was quite good although I made a couple of adjustments. I added Hot Itallian Sausage along with the beef as well as using some blackbeans since I couldnt find Pinto Beans. Otherwise it was quite tasty.

Very tasty. I used ground venison instead of ground beef. I also added a small amt. of bacon, cut very fine when sauteing the onion and garlic. Used 2 cans of kidney beans, didn't have the pinto beans. The family loved it.. went for seconds, big compliment since the kids don't like to eat red meat.

For a single party, I made this recipe as shown as well as a vegan version, so all my guests could enjoy. I received enormous praise and many insisted on doggy bags! My friends have demanded that I make it again.

i made this chili on a whim for new years weekend. it sat on the stove all weekend long on simmer and we just took a bowl when we felt like it. this is a wonderful cold weather dish to just have around to take the chill off of 7 degree day in the poconos. just put in the fridge over night and have it for breakfast the next morning.
