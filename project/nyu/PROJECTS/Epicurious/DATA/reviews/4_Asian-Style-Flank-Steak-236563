Yum...and so easy. Followed the recipe exactly, except I marinated for a full day so I could just throw it under the broiler after work. Will definitely make again.

This was great! I used cocktail sauce instead of ketchup for a spicy kick. The sauce was a great addition, so juicy.

This recipe turned out great. I added the soy sauce to taste as the marinade seemed like it might end up too salty: I only used about half the soy sauce called for in the recipe (different brands of soy sauce have varying levels of saltiness, and I was taught that marinades shouldn't be too salty to eat on their own). Following the broiler instructions, the steak turned out perfectly medium rare and tender. The flavor was wonderful without adding the sauce on top. The texture of the meat is good for serving hot or cold. I originally served it warm alongside mango slaw and plan on slicing the leftovers thin and using them in sandwiches.

Good recipe. The family all liked it. I think in the future, I might add some brown sugar as I'd like the steak to be a bit sweeter.

Something about this was too sweet for me, but on the plus side, it was very easy to make and satisfied eight hungry guests.

This has become my go to meal for guests...it is very flavorful without being too much. It also travels well, so it is great for bringing a meal to a friend.

Easy, moist, delicious. Everyone in my family loved it. I might throw a splash of vinegar in the marinade next time - my husband added steak sauce to his and the vinegary taste really brought out the brightness of the ginger.

Very nice flavor and super easy. Mine came out salty because I usually grill flank steak plain or make carne asada, which doesn't use a salty marinade, so I habitually salt and pepper it before grilling. It didn't occur to me that shoyu is plenty salty and anything marinated in it doesn't need another salting. Something to keep in mind if you are used to other marinades.

This is so easy and is really good. Makes the steak very tender and is a good sauce to pour over the steak and rice. a good change from traditional marinades.

Grilled this and thought it was yummy. I didn't have dry sherry so used sweet and still liked it a lot.

This is very good...I added some red pepper flakes to give it a bite. I also think a little brown sugar would be a nice addition as well. Also I think a flank steak needs to marinate for more than 2 hours..other wise it can be a bit tough.

Simple, quick and flavorful recipe. I marinated it for about 2 1/2 hours and grilled it for about 8-10 minutes total for medium rare.

This is a family favorite. I have made it dozens of times for family and guests and it always gets rave reviews. I usually do not serve with excess marinade and it is still wonderful.

this is now my stand-by marinade for flank steak. When I don't have sherry on hand, I use red wine and either way it's good.

This was a big hit at our 4th of July BBQ...The marinade/sauce is comprised of a rather interesting group of ingredients, but they really blend well together...Thank heavens for flank steak. It's always a hit and sooo easy!

A success through-and-through. I served it Peking Duck-style (wrapped up in Chinese pancakes with crunchy vegetables and hoisin sauce).

Have loved this for years, came out the first so much better then I imagined. My son loves the sauce for dipping the steak.

muddy taste. waste of a flank steak.

Not terrible, but not terribly good either. I definitely wouldn't make it again.

Delicious..and so simple. Great way to have that flank steak turned into something else. If you love garlic and ginger, feel free to increase them, then you get more of those little pieces

Very, very good and it couldn't be simpler. I added a little brown sugar to round out the marinade. The sauce at first seems a little strong, but used sparingly it really complements the meat after cooking. Got raves with my family.

Quick, easy and quite tasty. Mixed the thinly sliced meat with the sauce and served over rice.

I couldn't believe how good this turned out to be! When the sause is cooked, you might find it a little strong. I sprinkled a little sugar into the mix (about a tsp or 2) and it was perfect! Pour it over the steak and whipped potatoes. Don't try to substitute Sesame oil for some other kind.

This has been one of my favorites for years and everyone always raves about it. It couldn't be mor simple and is great grilled, broiled or done on the stovetop. Don't hesitate to try this. It's great with horseradish mashed potatoes and stir fried green beans with garlic and ginger.

I didn't know what to do with this after preparing it. No one came to the table. Maybe more sherry, or a louder dinner bell...

This was simple to prepare and very tasty. The leftovers were pretty good the next day, too. I will definitely make this again.

Didn't know what to accompany this, so I served it like fajitas, with julienned lettuce, green onions and carrots and rolled up in a tortilla spread with a touch of plum sauce!

I made this last night and it turned out great. The marinade is delicious; the flavors all compliment each other well. I added extra garlic and ginger, which I would definitely do again. Also, next time I will try it with a briskit to really soak up the delicious sauce.

Delicious! VERY flavorful & we could practically cut it with a fork. Only change I made was to marinate in the refrig for about 6 hrs, and brought to room temp before I cooked. Easy & delicious. Will make again..

Made this for my new boyfriend..and he said.."Wow, so I guess you CAN cook, huh?" Delish!

This was sooo good!!! I didn't have any Sherry on hand so I used red cooking wine, and a little more garlic then it called for... Absolute perfection. The leftovers were fabulous too!

Quick, easy, and delicious. I marinated the steak 4 - 5 hours instead of the recommeded 2 hours. I prepared the steak on the grill to a perfect medium rare and the results were very tasty.

The kids loved it, the husband loved it, everybody was happy. I needed more of it they ate so much, and they usually do not like steak.

Terrific ! I doubled to serve 8, and cooked on the grill to medium rare. . . everyone had thirds! Excellent choice for a marinade that doesn't need to sit overnight.

Very nice! I think this would be perfect company fare because everything can be done before and then popped under the broiler or grill. I used a skirt steak because it was what I had. This is definately a keeper.

This was delicious! I have tried lots of different versions of marinated flank steak but this was the best so far. Very flavorful and moist beyond belief. Served it with veggie fried rice from the grocery store carry-out and steamed snow peas. Delish!!!!!
