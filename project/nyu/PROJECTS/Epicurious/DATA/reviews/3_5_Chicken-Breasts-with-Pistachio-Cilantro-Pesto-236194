This made a lovely pesto. I used it on salmon filets and it went very well. Will try it with chicken and possibly on some pasta soon. A great new pesto to add to my repetoir.

I added more garlic. And, I had the butcher debone my chicken breasts BUT save all the skin. You can then prepare it according to directions and then allow them to cool down a bit, and then slice them to make smaller portion sizes for a party. Really delicious.

I really liked this pesto and it was a great way to use up a whole lot of cilantro in the garden. I used it on scallops and then served it over linguine. It was a hit. I am looking forward to trying it with a roast chicken.

A delicious change of pace for roast chicken breast on the bone. I had dry-roasted pistachios and cilantro on hand, and this fit the bill for dinner beautifully. Plenty of the pesto left over - could have easily gotten away with half the required amount.

I made this for the wife as a change of pace...and it is now her favorite dish. Certainly worth trying.

very tasty and easy. if, like me. you are unable to get raw pistachios. you need to remove husks befor toasting. even then toast checking every 2 ninutes. it took only 5 or so minutes even easier to burn than other nuts. otherwise quite easy to make and very delicious. will make again. also will make pesto for fish or pasta try it. it' great

A good dish but not four stars worthy. Very simple dish to make on a weeknight, though.

Excellent! I liked the cruchiness of the pesto sauce. Pesto also great on rice.

This was SO good! I was a bit short on the cilantro, but it still turned out fantastic. I absolutely plan to make it again. Make sure you have a meat thermometer, because I used large breasts, and I had to double the cook time to get them to 170 degrees.
