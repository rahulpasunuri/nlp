Eh, this recipe was ok. Nothing really jumps out at you. It was on the dry side and lacks flavor. I will make it again with more feta and use heavy cream. Considering that it was relatively quick to prepare, a few changes here and there could make it a go-to-dish on weeknights.

I loved this! And it was great leftover, too. Next time I'm going to use frozen chopped spinach and I might lighten it up with low-fat feta and cream. My only advice is to make sure to mix the eggs thoroughly into the custard. My fiancé said his second piece was a little eggy, though the first piece was fine (note that he ate two pieces :)

This is a very tasty recipe. I followed the suggestions from other readers, I skipped boiling the potatoes and it turned out just great, after baking for one hour. I used frozen spinach, which speeded up the preparation. I also did not bother with the paper: I simply put half the potatoes on the bottom of the buttered dish, added the spinach mixture, and then spread the other half of the potatoes on the spinach mixture and then added the rest of the custard. I used goat feta, which made it less salty and nice and creamy. It is quite a filling dish, and we ate it as our main dish with a salad. I will certainly make this again.

it was okay and relatively simple to make. definitely an upgrade/change of pace from other potatoes. i substituted heavy cream and used gorgonzola along with the feta for more creaminess and flavor, but will use more cream next time. i think it would benefit from mixing the cheeses in with the potatoes, and not just on top, as the bottom layer turned out kind of bland, like the others said. also, i think the last flipping/broiling steps are unnecessary--i just pulled it out ten minutes before, sprinkled some extra cheese on top, and put it back in the oven to finish, then scooped it out with a spatula to plate--fell apart a little, but i think it's more of a family dinner than something to impress.

Even with the addition of sauteed onion, garlic and a shallot to the spinach & feta portion, this was still pretty blah.

I really liked this dish, as a light version of a richer gratin. I used fat free half and half, and skipped cooking the potatoes and using the processer as suggested - I would cook it a bit longer next time to get the potatoes done more. I think all the reviewers are right, it is a mild, non-creamy gratin, but for me it worked fine.

I added some herbs like parsley, basil and dill and cayenne and it came out okay but still rather bland. Perhaps goat's cheese feta will give it some extra flavour.

I was looking for a light supper idea with ingredients on hand. I found it to be rather labour intensive for a wknight meal. I skipped boiling the potatoes as the other rater did too. I added dill, parsley and mint to the custard mixture (in keeping with the Mediterranean theme) Might have tried Zatar (Middle Eastern thyme-sesame-sumac mix). The dish would have been bland without any herbs. IF this dish is made again, I would use frozen spinach to cut down the time and forget about doing the wax paper thing - just serve it out of the casserole dish with the spinach on top. Tasty dish but I usually reserve this much labour for company! Maybe make this into a brunch type of dish??

Good but not outstanding recipe. I used Yukon gold potatoes, and baked the casserole for aprox. 1 hour (I skipped boiling the sliced potatoes). I also added 1 clove of chopped garlic & 1 sliced green onion to the custard. Do not add extra salt to the potato layer (which I did, unfortunately) because the feta custard has more than enough. Make sure to check your teeth in the mirror after you've had this dish because I sat through dinner with small flecks of spinach in my teeth that nobody told me about...not what you want as the hostess.

This has definitely become one of my all time favorite, wow your guests, foods. Prepare it all the way until it's time to put it under the broiler, cook and refrigerate until it's time to bring it close to room temp and then it's under the broiler. It's a great side dish for lamb and has become an Easter staple.

I made this for Easter to go along with Honey Baked Ham, Asparagus and Chive Biscuits. It was a huge hit! The Feta makes it not as rich as if you were to add another kind of cheese. Definitely a keeper.

this was simple enough in that we would normally have all the ingredients on hand and not at all complicated to put together. however, we just didn't find it terribly interesting, either. there is nothing at all wrong with the recipe--just that there are many others that we find to be more appealing.

Wonderful dish! Can be prepared for any occasion.

I cut the recipe in half the first time and it still worked well. Second time I made it at a vacation cabin without a food processor. I finely chopped the spinach and used crumbled feta. Still worked well and was a huge hit.

The whole thing was taking too long so I just cooked it right side up for about an hour and it came out like a quiche -- not runny at all and tasting more like eggs than anything else. I guess the upside down part is key. Take my advice and don't take the same short-cut I did.

This dish has very subtle flavors and because no one flavor dominates, you can really taste each ingredient. I think I may add onion next time I make it. I used 1/2 cup fat free half and half (and one cup regular)and used white potatoes; each of these substitutions worked very well. I flipped the cooled dish onto a cookie sheet; worked very well. Overall, a good, attractive dish that goes with both formal and informal meals.

I have made this recipe numerous times. What a hit. It is great with a Filet Mignon with a Port Sauce, and Red Onion Confit
