I used 1 full can of lite coconut milk, and a mix of whole milk and 2% milk. I thought it was thickening up enough to set well in the fridge at 40 minutes, but if anything it was runnier after chilling for a few hours. I had to take it out of the fridge and add xanthan gum and tapioca starch. (Note: I like my rice pudding THICK, not runny like some people seem to prefer.) In the future I would definitely add an egg!

this is hands down the best coconut rice pudding outside my mother's indian kheer. i used 1 cup of full-fat coconut milk and the remaining 2 1/2 cups - 2% milk. i followed the rest of the recipe as written. the mixture thickened in 30 mins at which point i added sliced almonds & raisins. my boyfriend told me it was the best dessert he has had hands down.

I was really worried at first because it was so thin, and it took WAY longer than 40 min to thicken up. I used 2% milk instead of whole because that's all I had, and added 1 Tbsp butter to help thicken it. Can I just say WOW! This is the BEST rice pudding I've ever tasted. I bit of a pain to make, but SO worth it!!

I advise staying close to the recipe - no need to add egg - I used 1 half coconut milk and 1 half milk for the liquid, I used vanilla bean paste and added 4 cardamam pods as well - also reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup it was still plenty sweet. A very easy quick and tasty dessert.

I followed the advice to microwave the pudding, and I used the whole can of coconut milk, adding skim milk to make volume. I used cooked brown rice, added an extra egg yolk, a teaspoon of coconut extract, and 1/4 cup toasted coconut after it was cooked. Topped it with mini chocolate chips and more toasted coconut flakes. Yummy!!

I did what reviewer below did: can of coconut milk and the rest of the liquid with soy milk. It's very tasty. Took less than 40 minutes for me. Such a good way to use up leftover rice from the Spanish or Chinese delivery.

Amazing and simple! I substituted the rice with Kashi 7 grain pilaf and added 2 tablesponns of flax seed. I used 2 cups of coconut milk and 1 cup of soy milk. I also added a handful of golden raisins at the end of cooking. I garnished with chopped walnuts instead of flaked coconut. Perfect sweetness and texture. Yum!!!

We've made this several times now, it's addictive! I follow the recipe to a tee and it's perfect: not too sweet, the coconut is not overpowering, and the texture is perfectly creamy.

Mmmm...yum! Comfort food at it's best! I, too, followed other reviewers advice and used a whole can of coconut milk & regular milk to make the 3 c. of liquid. I also added a couple dashes of allspice, shredded unsweetened coconut flakes, and one egg yolk for extra creaminess and pudding-like consistency. Delish!

I loved this. Following the advice of some of the previous reviewers, I used the entire can of coconut milk and reduced the other milk so that the total fluid input was still 3-1/2 cups. I also opted to use half and half instead of whole milk, because that is what I happened to have on hand. I don't think the recipe itself specified jasmine rice, but that makes a big difference. I also found that despite the recipe instructions to serve warm, I much preferred this after it had chilled overnight. I guess I'm just a pudding-is-supposed-to-be-cold kind of person.

I love rice pudding, but not this one. It came out very bland, and I thought the overly creamy texture was unappealing. Added extra sugar and coconut extract, but still didn't like it much. Will not make again, and will not recommend.

Not enough coconut flavor, simply increasing the amount of coconut milk just did not do it. I found the best way is to use coconut extract. Add about 1 -2 tsp. or more depending on your taste preference. Really boosts the coconut flavor.

This rice pudding was easy to make, but on the bland side (yes, even for a rice pudding.) I think the recipe is a good base for me to add to to work out a rice pudding recipe that I can stick with.

Wonderful - used all of the coconut milk and used heavy cream instead of milk - the first time I made I added raisins and coconut this time I added dried chopped cherries - got rave reviews.

Excellent! Wasn't too crazy about stirring the rice for so long but the end result was worth it. I threw in a handful of rasins to add some texture, very good!

I put all the ingredients together using a can of lite Coconut Milk and enough milk to make 2 1/2 cups. As I am not into standing and stirring for 40 minutes, I decided to put it in a 2-qt baking dish and I microwaved it (uncovered) for about 15 minutes and it was great. I stirred it every 5 minutes but next time, I will cut down the milk so it won't take so long. I also added one egg yolk for extra creaminess. This is a keeper and is quickly and easily made.

When I made this recipe I tweaked it a little. I used a whole can of coconut milk (about 1 1/4 cups) I didn't want to "waste" the rest of the can. I measured out the rest of the whole milk so that the total liquid amount was still 3 1/2 cups. Other than that I followed the recipe as stated. The rice pudding turned out fabulous - I think it's even better cold. Definitely would make this again and reccomend it to others.

Great recipe - but I agree with others that more coconut milk is best for a good coconut taste. I used the entire can of coconut milk which was 2 1/3 cups, then used ~1 1/3 cups of milk (whole). I used cooked jasmine rice and only stirred occasionally while I was cooking dinner. It thickened up nicely and is a very nice comfort food.

this recipe totally ocks my world. i did modiy it a bit. i used an entire can of coconut milk, and only about 1/2 a cup of whole milk, an d pre-cooked jasmine rice. i also added some finely shredded coconut (about 2 tbsp), and used at least 1/2 a cup of sugar, if not more. the end result after 40 minutes was a perfect creamy sweet delight. i turned around for a minute and my roommates had eaten it all, thats how good it is.

Great recipe, added only about 1/2 tbs butter to it, since I only had 2% milk. Thickened nicely and was a great hit with the whole family. I am not a fan of "normal" rice pudding, but this really does it.

This is a wonderful treat. I used 2 cups of 1% milk and 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk and I also used sushi rice. The consistancy was terrific, not too runny, not too thick and the sushi rice gave it a wonderful smooth texture. Garnish with toasted coconut and serve with fresh pineapple and mango and enjoy. Holds up well in the fridge.

Much easier w/ pre-cooked rice (about 2 1/2 cups). Added large can of regular coconut milk (no milk) and just added everything (sugar, vanilla, salt). Got nice and creamy fairly quickly. Much stronger flavor than regular rice pudding.

I lightened this considerably (because of the ingredients I had on hand) and STILL it was divine. Replaced the whole milk with a 50/50 mix of 2% milk and plain soy milk, used light coconut milk instead of regular, added an egg as a binding agent, used jasmine rice and added 1/2 tsp. ginger and a handful of dried cranberries and golden raisins. Delicious.

Yummy ! The reason many experienced difficulties with getting it creamy or thick is due to rice. Most cooks typically use long grain rice, being asian ( we take our rice seriously, and I don't mean that horrid dry rice they serve in most chinese restaurants), I use Kokuho Rose Premium rice (found in most asian grocers, it's more like sushi rice) it will yield a moist and creamy texture that is most delicious.

This is a great recipe if you need a rice pudding quickly (relatively speaking). I used cooked jasmine rice and added some orange zest. I only had 1% milk on hand, so I added 1 tbsp of cornstarch dissolved in 1 tbsp of hot water, just to make sure it thickened enough at the end.

I don't know what I was thinking...maybe that it would be tasty? I was very disappointed, doubly so because I have been so happy with the other recipes from this site. It took much longer to thicken than I expected but additional cooking helped. The flavor was the problem...there was something "odd" about it. Perhaps it was the coconut milk, I don't know. I followed the recipe closely, adding some raisins and addidtional toasted coconut toward the end. The result was so awful that I tossed the entire pot down the sink. I realize this is a traditional southern dessert...guess I haven't made a complete culinary transition to the south even though I've been here 20 years! Sorry...but this recipe just didn't make it for me at all.

Delicious!! Used two cups milk and a full can of coconut milk as suggested. Also used 2 cups of freshly cooked rice and added raisins. So yummy cold out of the frig.

Well, I can't really rate the recipe as is, because after reading other reviews I made some changes. I used 2 cups of (Silk) vanilla soy milk (so it would be non-dairy), and 1 1/2 cups of the lite coconut milk. I also used 2 1/2 cups of cooked rice. I also stirred in about 1/2-2/3 cup of lightly toasted, very finely grated coconut(if you don't have finely grated, you can put some in the food processor). I still added the vanilla, even though I used vanilla soy milk, and it still had a wonderful coconut flavor. I think adding the coconut did the trick. I also added about 2/3 cup of raisins during the last 10 minutes of cooking. It was wonderfully creamy, and very tasty. I've made it twice. The second time I used brown rice, for a little added nutrition, and it was equally as good, with no real difference in taste.

I also upped the amount of coconut milk (used Thai Kitchen "Lite" coconut milk) and lowered the whole milk... and found this recipe to be FABULOUS! Sometimes it is the simple things in life that are the best food for the soul!!!

In agreement with directly below me; rice is technically a thickening agent itself, so just cooking just a little longer should get you the consistency you're used to with puddings. I thought the flavor was nice; subtle and nutty and would personally not use the vanilla next time and serve with fruit on the side. (You're not getting the same coconut impact you're used to with say, coconut candy.) People do seem to be missing the eggs here, but this is a nice alternative to any of your usual rice puddings. The magazine context for this recipe was utility using leftover rice, and you should think of it as that, just a simple rice pudding.

Loved this. If it seems a little runny at 40 minutes, just keep cooking for a while longer. It thickens pretty quickly at this point. I upped the amount of coconut milk and used Thai Kitchen Lite coconut milk.

I really did not like this recipe. The cooked rice just did not make the end product creamy. When you cook rice in milk as in other recipies it is really creamy. I put in about 1 cup of coconut milk and still did not think there was enough of a coconut flavor.

Sorry, but I have to give this one 2 forks. I love rice pudding, but I just think there are better recipes out there...I loved the idea of using coconut milk (I, too, upped the amount of coconut milk and reduced the amount of whole milk) and the flavor was great (added a touch of cinnamon on top, too), but the final puding was just a bit too runny for me, even after chilling. Since I live in the tropics, I'd try FRESH coconut milk if I made it again. Bottom line: good flavor, poor consistency.

This is wonderful. If you like rice pudding, don't miss it. As suggested in a previous review, I upped the quantity of coconut milk using 1-1/2 cups and 2 cups whole milk. Don't be afraid of the 40 minute cook time. I kept it on the back of the stove while I was making the rest of our dinner-stirring it every now and then. It finished same time as our main meal so I turned off the heat and left it to cool until after we were finished eating. It was the perfect texture and temperature.

I have to agree with the cook who said the coconut flavor didn't come through much, but this is still a great recipe! I used 1% milk instead of whole and lite coconut milk instead of regular. If the length of stirring time seems daunting, just make this while you're doing something else, like prepping vegetables. The last twenty minutes is when it all comes together.

Is that right? ...1 1/2 cups of already cooked rice and 3 1/2 cups of liquids?

My guests loved this recipe and it was so easy to make. I didn't have whole milk, so I used 2 1/4 cups 2% and 3/4 cup fat free 1/2 & 1/2. It turned out great. Every time we have Chinese and I don't know what to do with all that left over white rice, I will now make this dish.

i love rice pudding, and this turned out just like the kozy shack im used to... which doesnt have coconut! if you want coconut flavoring, i would suggest adding more coconut milk and less whole milk, bc as it stands, the coconut flavor will not come through. all in all, its a great rice pudding recipe.
