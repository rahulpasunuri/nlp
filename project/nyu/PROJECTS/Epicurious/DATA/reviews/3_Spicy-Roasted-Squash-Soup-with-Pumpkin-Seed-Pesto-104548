This is a beautiful, subtly spiced soup. A couple of changes suited my tastes: I did not use the bread, but rather drizzled a couple of teaspoons of homemade argula/basil pesto in a swirl over the top when serving. Over that, I drizzled a teaspoon of soaked saffron. Color was great, smells were heavenly and my guests simply cooed.

Do not bother. I made the mistake of making this for Thanksgiving. Followed to the letter and it was bland--completely flavorless. One of my guests, an expert cook, tried to doctor it up but in the end it was a wan start to the annual feast.

This was an interesting recipe. I was a bit hesitant to make it based on other reviewers comments. I agree with others that the pumpkin-seed pesto really makes this dish. I used raw pumpkin seeds and maybe didn't cook them long enough. I didn't like the texture the seeds had. It's like you had to chew them and chew them forever. The soup on it's own was only OK to me. Really depended on the pesto. I didn't like the look of the pesto mixzed directly into the soup. Looked like a weird brownish baby-food that way. This would have scored higher for me if it weren't for the pumpkin seed texture issue.

Only did pesto- added a nice flavor to a typical squash soup.

This soup with the pesto crouton was a wonderful addition to Thanksgiving and I would recommend it for the holiday because it isn't sweet. My mother had asked me to make a butternut squash soup for the holiday and I was reluctant because I thought it would be too cloying with the heavy dinner. But this dish, with the bit of heat and spice, was the perfect antidote.

I found this a very easy soup and liked the idea it had no milk. I didn't use any water but used chicken stock. I used about 6 cups most I added while puree was going. I used an average size squash, a small serranno pepper and 1.5 tsp of cumin. I also added 1 TBS of chopped sweet onion to the puree. The soup turned out great. I will make the pesto after halloween as I have no pumpkin seeds!

I really enjoyed this soup. I like cumin but didn't find it to be terribly overpowering anyway. I didn't make the toast as I was making this soup mostly to freeze. I also added a yam that I needed to use up. I agree with the other reviewer that this soup doesn't really come into its own until you add the pesto. I put it all in at once and froze it that way. Its a very nice lunch. I'd certainly make it again.

The cumin overpowered the taste of the soup. I served it at Thanksgiving dinner and of the 22 people served only 3 liked it.

Wow! Did I screw up! I read 1-two lb. butternut squash, so when I used a 4+ pounder, I doubled the hot stuff and the cumin. Then, as i thinned it, I knew something was wrong- only used 4-5 cups of broth. Then I let is set ovenight- Yikes! 5 Alarm Soup! This was served at Thanksgiving, and, as, hot as it was, most people at it- even some of the kids. Couldn't find pumpkin seeds, so I used walnuts- everyone loved it- kept dipping the toasts in the hot lava soup. Next day I added three more lbs of squash and thinnned it a little more- still very hot (i loved it)- served it to other guests- very spicey- but very, very good- don't forget the pesto toasts!!

I thought this was great...but I modified a bit. I recommend leaving the cumin out and adding a little garlic and ginger. I also thought the textur was a little too watery, but all in all, I really liked the soup (at least my version)

The sweet butternut and cumin was indeed odd together, despite the pesto. Unfortunately, not a big hit in our household.

This soup was okay - sort of blah, with just cumin as the main spice, and I wasn't sure I liked the sweetness of the squash with the spicy earthiness of the cumin - UNTIL, I just dumped that pumpkin seed pesto right into the soup! now, that was excellent. the pesto really filled in the gaps of the taste spectrum, so that it ended up being really flavorful and exotic - plus, the pesto gave the soup a nice texture. I served this with Norwegian Mountain Loaf from Nigella Lawson's book "How to Be a Domestic Goddess" - great autumn meal!

I served this soup as a starter for a New Year's Eve crab dinner. Friends who had made squash soup liked the spunk of the jalepeno and thought it was flavorful twist on a soup they had made before. I wouldn't recommend serving soup without the toasts as other chef suggested. Toasts were kind of labor intensive, definitely make them ahead of time; but they were worth the efforts--provided a nutty texture to soup ...other items on menu that night were collard greens, ham & leek empanadas and crab.

I thought this recipe was delicious--just the right amount of heat (from the Jalepenos) to add warmth during the cold winter months. My guests raved about the soup and each one asked for the recipe. And the pesto recipe I will keep on file as it will go well with many other dishes. I will definitely make this soup again (and again, and again!).

I really thought this soup was wonderful. I made it for a friend's dinnner party and it was a huge hit! I did add my own bit of decadence and added about one cup of heavy cream to the recipie. It didn't need it but I wanted something rich. I plan to make this for my Thanksgiving dinner!

Made this dish c/New Years Eve dinner. It was a huge hit. Definitely worth the effort. The soup is very creamy, without the calories of heavy cream. Don't serve it without the Pesto toasts. The soup is wonderfull by itself but, outstanding with the pesto. This just compliments the dish, inhances the flavors & makes an impressive presentation. Got rave reviews even 2 days later c/leftovers @ work !!
