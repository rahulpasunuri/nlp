I made the punch with some of the modifications. I used apple cider and the cranberry zinger tea along with lemon lime soda instead of the club soda. It was not a big hit but it may have been the crowd more than the punch. I thought it was very tasty.

I made this punch for a 5 year old birthday picnic. It was a big hit by the adults and children... my nephew even said "Mama, I think I like this better than soda." -- a ringing endorsement in my book. Following the other reviewers notes, I used Cranberry-Apple Zinger instead of green tea. I floated frozen lemon and lime slices on top for visual appeal.

I made this punch for my parents 50th wedding anniversary party. I read all of the comments posted and I will tell you about the adaptations I made! First, I made ice cubes (instead of a ring) made out of the white concord grape juice. Before freezing I added a single seedless red grape. Because I have a large freezer I started making the ice cubes well in advance and, when the cubes were frozen solid, I placed them into zip-top plastic bags so I had plenty to add to the punch throughout the party. Instead of sugar or sugar syrup and club soda I used sugar-free lemon/lime and gingerale soda (just enough to add a "fizz"). I also used edible but pretty flowers to float on top ('though no one actually ate any of them!) It made a beautiful presentation, it gave us a great non-alcoholic beverage for those who desired it, and the children liked it enough to pass on the readily available soda option! It was the only beverage I drank through the party and I received a lot of compliments. Everyone thought it was much more difficult to prepare!

I made this for a baby shower, and it was perfect. Easy, not too sweet, light, citrus-y. It might be difficult for a very large group, but for a shower it was great.

I made this for a baby shower this weekend and everyone really enjoyed it. I took advice from other comments and modified to use 1/2 cup of lemon juice and I also used the Cranberry-Apple Zinger tea (4 bags) along with 2 bags of Green tea. I also added slices of lemon and lime and it added to the presentation

Wonderful! Received many compliments during pre-prom pary celebration. Tea, lemon and grape juice produce elegant flavor. Reduced lemon juice to 1/2 cup.

Try Celestial Seasonings Cranberry-Apple Zinger instead of green tea.You don't even have to seep the teabags. The night before, put the water and tea bags (I use 5-6 for an average pitcher)in the refrigerator and it will brew in there. I have done this for years for iced tea. The cranberry zinger makes a beautiful red color, and adds an autumn flavor. ANd it has no caffeine.You can substitute apple cider for the grape juice.Float lemon ,and lime slices on top. The color intesifies as the tea seepss in the refrig so you can seep it longer than overnight.

This went over really well at a recent baby shower and I am going to use it again at a Holiday Party. I added a liter of Sprite and cut down on the Club soda and also did not use as much suger in my syrup. Also, floated very thinly sliced lemons and limes as a decorative effect.

This was not a bad punch, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I didn't think it was baby shower punch. Definitely a wedding punch. Made 1/2 the mixture as a test run for guests. It disappeared quickly. Green tea was refreshing...made my own sugar syrup, and the amount of sugar it required was ADHD scary. Good recipe, though.

This was a hit. I floated edible flowers on top and put flowers and lemon slices in the ice ring in anticipation of a blah color - it was pretty but the punch didn't need it (the color was a pleasant yellow/green color) I like this punch b/c with the decaf tea and low sugar content it doesn't give you the jitters and is a hit with everyone.

This punch waa big hit with my guests. Light, refreshing and a little "different."

It is a nice refreshing punch. Perfect for an afternoon party. Made it for the first time 8 years ago for a wedding shower and it has been a favorite for special occasions ever since. The color is a bit odd and I have flowers to make it look more attractive.

Fine, but not fabulous. The green tea made some people shy away. I expected it to be a bigger hit.

I made this for my daughter's bridal shower. Wonderful, crisp, tart but sweet. Try it without the soda for a surprisingly tasteful margarita mix.

Maybe I wouldmake it if I eliminated the tea. Maybe I will try that and subtitute something else

We made this for a wedding reception and it was great! Refreshing and different. It was time consuming because we needed such a large quantity but well worth it.

Made it for a wedding reception my mother held in her home - absolutely delish! Am going to find out how to make it like I do iced tea and have it on hand all the time from now on...

Made it for a party and it was a huge success. Have been making it ever since. Here's a twist: My daughter made it for her 24th birthday party using champagne instead of club soda!

I would make this punch again simply because I made it for a party and everyone scarfed it up. I wasn't as wild about it as I thought I would be, but everyone else was. It is a rather nice combo of flavors. The color was not the best, though. You might want to use a drop or two of green food color -- it's kind of a brownish-green as is. Green tea is a "hot" item right now, so it would probably be a hit with the health crowd.

I am not a fan of grape juice nor do I really love any of the ingredients, but if I even liked it as much as I did, it must be pretty good.
