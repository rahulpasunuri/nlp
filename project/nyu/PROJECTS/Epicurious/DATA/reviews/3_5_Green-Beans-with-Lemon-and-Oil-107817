Super easy and universally beloved! I've used run-of-the mill green beans from the grocery store and fresh from the farmer's market and both are delicious.

Really good way to prepare green beans. I served them at room temp but I think they would be good chilled with a light, summery dish too.

This is my default preparation for green beans now. The zest and tang of the dressing raise green beans to another level.

Ho hum. Maybe it's because my haricot verts were the frozen kind?

This was fantastic! Fresh, bright with lots of flavor. Even my husband loves it and he doesn't go for cold or plain. Served it with roasted chicken. The next day used with salad greens, chicken for a wonderful salad. Had that until it was all gone. Making it for dinner tonight with filet mignon and baked potatoes. EASY and tasty!

Made this dish using a clementine. Was easy, fast and fabulous. My 16 year old son asked for a second helping!

A very simple side dish that complements and doesn't compete with an elaborate main dish. I served the beans at room temperature along with Couquilles St. Jacques and it was perfect.

This was so easy and tasted so good. I couldn't get the harticot verts, so used regular green beans. All our dinner guests loved these upscale beans, which would go well with just about anything.
