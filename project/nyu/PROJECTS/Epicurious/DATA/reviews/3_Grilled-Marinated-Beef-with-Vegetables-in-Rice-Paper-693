I am vietnamese and my family makes this dish rountinely on weekend family get togethers. This dish if done with the authentic recipe is wonderful. However, when I looked at the ingredients in this recipe I know it is not authentic. First, the marinate for the meat does not include soy sauce. FYI, vietnamese cooking seldom uses soy sauce in the ingredients. Second, the dipping sauce is completely wrong. It lacks water, sugar, garlic and chili. The sauce should taste salty, yet tart and a little bit spicy as well. The ingredient for the sauce is a good start, however very incomplete.
