These cookies came out very well even after the following changes: rather than buttermilk, i used sour creme. Rather than 7 tbs of butter, i used 3 and a couple of splashes of milk to make up for the liquid ingredient. No corn syrup in the frosting. The frosting was very very sweet, so next time i may take the sugar out of the cookie or reduce it because it is right on the level of too much sweetness. Great tasting cookies all else considered.

After reading the reviews and trying the recipe, it seems to me that if you've had and liked real NY black and whites you will like these cookies. I made medium sized (3 inch) cookies and the recipe made 2 dozen, making the icing not too much work. Start with the icing on the thick side and then thin it gradually until it's easy to spread.

These cookies were just OK. The bases were bland and chewy, and the frosting didn't elevate them much. I would not make them again.

Very tasty, I especially like the lemon hint in the frosting. These took a long time because of the icing and the TINY size of the cookies called for as written. That made icing them annoying. Next time I will just make them bigger, and maybe leave the corn syrup out of the icing. I find it slows down drying time.

Could also be called "OCD cookies" because you need it to do them right. Threw out my first batch of dough and added more flour to the 2nd, chilled and piped the dough onto the sheets for more uniformity. Applying the icing was a pain but they turned out super cute and yummy.

I made these for my friends last night and they loved them! I didn't have any cocoa powder on hand so I split up the frosting in two parts and dyed them different colors; they were adorable and delicious! I also added a little more lemon juice to the frosting and it gave it a nice kick. I want to get a brush so I can artfully paint the frosting on next time. Ying Yang cookies would be really cool :)

This is exactly how i remember these cookies from new york! they only made 2 1/2 dozen though so i would double the recipie. Super easy to make acctually and frost too,

This was quicker than I expected. Piped out the cookie batter and it worked well. Used parchment paper and skipped the butter on the sheets. The icings turned out pretty tasty - I had Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and it made the chocolate side very black. There is a pancake-y taste as another reviewer mentioned, but it was still pretty good. Got about 50 silver dollar size.

Outstanding, and exactly miniature versions of what I remember them to be. I followed the recipe but piped the dough from a bag and tamped down any peaks that stood proud, and we used plain cocoa powder as I couldn't find Dutch process in time. My gf frosted them beautifully for me and we had lots of icing left over.

Rating: 3
These are an awful lot of work, but they exactly like the cookies I ate as a kid in NYC. The frosting is an exact replica. Be sure to use Dutch Process chocolate. It gives the deep color and rich flavor needed for a true black & white. Also, I thinned the frosting to the point where it spread very easily. In fact, I held the cookes vertically and let gravity help carry the frosting down.

Rating: 0
The icing was a bit messy to deal with and it didn't spread very well. It was a bit sweet. I really liked the cookie on its own without the icing. An alternative could be to dip it in melted dark chocolate. I think it is better to smooth the cookie dough before you bake it because the underside is bumpy.

These cookies were okay but I don't think I would make them again. I only got about 44 from the recipe and I didn't catch the part in the directions about frosting the flat side, so I did it wrong. I think the white icing is too sweet.

Black-and-whites are one of my favorite cookies, and these were a really great version of them! They were perfect miniature B&W's, fairly easy to make, and satisfied my craving (living somewhere you can't find them). The cookies are perfect as written (I got 56 out of it). The only minor adjustments I made to the icing were to cut the lemon juice to 1 tsp, and to use clear vanilla to keep the pure white color. Frosted them while listening to a book on CD. To anyone who has not had a black-and-white before: do not omit the lemon juice altogether! It's a key ingredient if you want them to taste authentic!

I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted sour cream. WOW, they were fabulous. They were gone before I could get them frosted. I will definately be making these again for our cookie exchange. I suppose I will have to fling a hoho in the street to keep my family occupied while I ice them.

Next time I will use the pastry bag to pipe out per other reviews, however using an cookie scooper, I got a consistnt round shape by flattening slightly with the bottom of a glass. Remember to ice the bottoms too, where it is flattest.

wonderful! they were easy and sooo good. an authentic black and white! a single batch does not yeild many cookies so i reccomend doubling or tripling the recipie for parties. i followed the other reviwer's advice about the icing, so i omitted the lemon juice and they were perfect! i got rave reveiws days after i served them at thanksgiving. a must make for cookie lovers like me!

Loved this recipe. Due to all the concerns in the reviews about the too-lemony vanilla icing, I cut the lemon juice down to 1T and found that to be perfect. No need to divide the frosting; just do the vanilla first them mix in the cocoa powder to the leftovers. I frosted these generously and had ample frosting left over for the chocolate sides. I loved these cookies - moist and delicious - but I think next time I make them I will experiment with using salted butter. A definite keeper of a recipe that will help with the craving of an old NYC favorite.

as someone who doesn't bake cookies very often, i was a bit nervous in attempting this recipe. however, it turned out to be much easier than i anticipated and quite enjoyable to frost. the texture of the cookie came out perfectly-- light and pillow-y, as it should be. my only complaint is the addition of lemon juice to the icing, which gives a noticeably bitter and medicinal flavor to the white icing. if you were to omit it, and perhaps substitute milk for the water to make the icing richer, you'd definitely have a great, authentic black and white cookie. i used a small cookie scoop for this recipe, which yielded 12-18 cookies. i also added food coloring to create hot pink and black cookies-- very cute.

I just made these cookies for the first time and they were a total hit! Even my friends from New York thought they were pretty authentic. The only thing I didn't like about the recipe is that I had way too much icing left over that I had to throw away.

I thought the cookies themselves were fantastic. Light and fluffy and pillowy, they kind of reminded me of Madelines (which I absolutely love!) I followed the cookie recipe exactly except cut it in half, but when I saw it came it to be a pretty small quantity I wish I hadn't done so. As for the frosting... I have to agree with other reviews that it was mediocre. The chocolate frosting came out tasty but the white frosting was too lemony and sour and didn't taste good at all. Also I think I added a bit too much water and it became runny. LASTLY, I didn't realized until the end that I was supposed to ice the FLAT side of the cookie! (Mind you, I've never had real NY black and whites before). I iced the rounded side (i.e. the top) and was frustrated when all the icing started running down the sides. All in all, delicious cookies, but I would hunt around for a different icing recipe if I were to make them again.

These black and whites were better than the ones I buy at the store! Followed the recipe except for the dutch powder(didn't have any so I used regular cocoa powder) and they came out perfectly. I usually bake about 6 different cookies to give away as presents for my kids' teachers but I am considering baking these only with different colors. Don't over cook and definitely soften the butter.

I liked the way these looked but I really did not like the icings. The cookies themselves tasted very good the first day, but three days later they were not so great. The buttermilk does add a nice tang. I don't think they are worth the effort. I would make the big ones instead if I were to make them.

I read the other reviews and decided to give the recipe a try. The cookies turned out better than what I had eaten when I lived in NY! They were not perfectly round but were close enough; the icing I kept thick but spreadable (I used the pastry bag tip).

Rating: 4
I looked at many of the negative comments and was worried this recipe would not come out like the ones I grew up eating. I was pleasantly surprised - they were great. I used parchment paper instead of greasing, used 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract instead of lemon juice (might use a little less next time), did 4 minutes on the lower third and 3-4 on the upper third. When i pulled them out of the oven i turned them over immediately to prevent further cooking while cooling. I kept the vanilla icing on the thicker side which formed a great edge for adding the chocolate frosting. I need to work on getting them round...

Because of how many I needed, I made two batches, each yielding about 42- 44 cookies. The first time I used spoons, the second time I snipped the corner off a freezer bag, which was much faster and easier. If you plant the corner of the bag in the cookie, you get a pretty uniform shape, mine were about the diameter of a large marshmallow, smaller would yield more. Be careful not to brown the bottom, that will make it harder to hide with the white icing. If your icing is too transparent, add some powdered sugar, a tsp. at a time. I added five half teaspoons of water after the initial 2T, to the white, and about the same to the chocolate and the consistency was just right. The offset spatula makes the straight line very easy. If your cookies are spreading too much, the butter may have been too thin, let it come to room temp before mixing. I couldn't even detect the lemon juice in the chocolate, and feel it's necessary in the white, but strain it to be sure there's no pulp. I will definitely make them again for a special occasion.

Absolutely delicious! Tastes like the bakery. Though the icing takes some time, it is totally worth it. Yum!

I was born and raised in Manhattan, as were my mother and father and grandparents. I didn't even finish making these. The cookies spread unevenly as they were baking, so that they were very round in the middle, almost semi-spheres, and then around the edges they spread to paper thin crisp edges. The icing was a fine consistency, but the vanilla icing was cream-colored and the chocolate icing was medium brown. Brown and cream doesn't have the same pizazz as black and white. The vanilla should be bright white, and the brown a deep, shiny black. The cookies also didn't taste exactly right, and they were a little too spongy. You would be better off using bland, store-bought sugar cookies and finding another recipe for the white and black icing.

My husband thought these were the "best black & whites" he ever ate. The cookie had a great texture, but as other cook reviews mentioned didn't yield 5 dozen -- I was very careful when spooing out, and managed to get about 32 cookies. When making the vanilla icing, I also though the lemon juice was a mistake, flavor- wise, so I added a few more drops of vanilla, which I felt improved the flavor. I would not omit the lemon, as I think it would taste overly sugary without it. I also used regular cocoa powder for the chocolate icing, since I didn't have dutch- process, but icing came out fine.

I am a professional chef and was very pleased with the outcome of this recipe. As a displaced New Yorker, it was a pleasure to find a recipe for the Black & White Cookies I so dearly loved. It was a little time consuming but well worth the effort. Like other readers, I use a pastry bag and plain tip to pipe out the dough to make even-sized cookies. I added 1/8 tsp. lemon oil instead of the fresh lemon juice. It gave just a hint of lemon to the cookie and was not an overpowering flavor. I prepared this recipe three times and sold four dozen batches at a Bake Sale. Wonderful Recipe.

We just made this for a christmas cookie exchange party and (while fairly time-consuming) they turned out PERFECTLY!!! they are perfect little tiny cookies (just like the picture) and they didn't really give us much trouble at all. We did not use lemon juice in the icing, and we used some margarine along with the unsalted butter (we ran short), and we got about 5 dozen cookies per batch (though, we had to make them really small to get this many). Also, we used a mechanical pastry bag from williams- sonoma to shape the cookies and it worked great! Icing the cookies did take a while, but as we are pretty meticulous people, they look beautiful (and taste delicious)! We will definitely make these again!

These cookies were delicious. I agree with the others - no lemon. I added a little glitter sugar for the white side since it's just before Christmas. Also, to make the cookie perfectly round, take a round cutter and cut the cookie AFTER it is baked.

If I can make these ANYBODY can!!! I've failed at making cookies in the past. This was easy! Not sure what the other reviewer's had done wrong, but I followed the instructions and ended up with cookies that look just like the photo. (I had to alter two things...I had no buttermilk, so I replaced it with 1/3 cup of milk and 1 tbsp of white vinegar(tip from internet) and I also had no corn syrup, so I replaced that with maple syrup) I cooked these just before Xmas, so I added a pinch of nutmeg. 100% would make these again, and will do so for years to come.

These cookies are delicious and fun to make. I agree it is hard to get them to look exactly like the photo, but they still look amazing with a little patience.The icing is a little tricky, I had to add a little more water to the chocolate icing after I had iced about half of them because it was drying out. I didn't have an offset spatula but used a butter knife instead and it worked just fine. I love these cookies and will continue to make them again and again!

As a native New Yorker, I found these to be a perfect miniature replica of the black and white cookies I remember. They are supposed to be a bit round on the bottom, so the mounding is not a mistake. At the behest of other reviewers, I did reduce the lemon juice by half, but I think I could have gone for the whole amount, and will next time around. I found the icing perfect - it even dried to that glossy finish I remember. To those who suggest fondant instead, I'm guessing you may have added too much water to the icing. If you go slow with the water, you'll hit the right, authentic thickness - fondant would be way too heavy. Only complaint is the yield - I squeaked out 2 dozen using a rounded teaspoon, and the same using a pastry bag the next time. Pastry bag is a good idea (i.e. ziploc with the corner cut off)- it gives a more consistent shape. Also, for those having problems with the look of these, if you start the icing by pulling the small offset spatula down the middle of the cookie, you'll get a pretty good straight line.

Rating: 2
I agree with the cook from DC--use a pastry bag to pipe these, as the dough is too thin to get a uniform shape by scooping. The white icing showed through, and I second Sheryl's suggestion to use fondant to get a thicker covering. I might try these again, but probably not anytime soon.

I have made these for the past two Xmases and I am an absolute fool for these cookies! But I would agree with previous reviewers who said that the lemon in the glaze has no business being there. I couldn't really get my cookies to look like the ones in the photos, but they still tasted great. I have to wonder how small the folks at Gourmet made those original cookies, because you have to be using some great pharmaceuticals to get 4 doz. out of one batch! I quadrupled the recipe and ended up with about 7 dozen 2 1/2"(-ish) cookies -- not tiny by any stretch I guess, but more manageable than the manhole covers they sell at delis. One secret, though: use a pastry bag or ziploc bag (with a corner snipped off) to pipe the dough on to the cookie sheet -- it makes life easier and the cookies a little more uniform.

This is an easy recipe, but I agree there seems to be no way to make it look like it does in the photo (and I'm a professional chef.) I chilled the dough to prevent over-spreading before I baked them, but it was still mounded in the end. I also found the yield to be off and I was using a measured teaspoon dough scoop.

After making 2 batches, I believe it's practically impossible to get the cookies to look like they do on the cover. That said, they are still charming and mouthwatering with a slightly puffier bottom. The recipe itself is easy and the end result light, fluffy, and delicious. It doesnt need as much lemon juice as it recommends. Easy and fantastic!
