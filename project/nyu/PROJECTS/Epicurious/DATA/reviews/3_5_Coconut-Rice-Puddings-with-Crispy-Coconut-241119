I've held on to this recipe for exactly 5 years, waiting to pair it with the right Asian-themed meal. I halved the recipe and like others, skipped the topping since there seemed to be enough sweetness in the pudding. I did add the lime zest as a finish. This was really good and really, really easy.

I am going to keep searching for a dessert to serve after an Indian dinner. Although one of my guest said it was better than any dessert he had ever had at an Indian restaurant, I still think there got to be something better out there.

Easy enough to make, but thought the results were disappointing. I did not make the topping, but the pudding itself didn't seem to have much flavor. I wouldn't make it again.

I had only one can of light coconut milk, so used 2 of the regular and had only the sweetened shredded coconut, so I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. I used regular extra long-grain rice. I didn't make the topping as didn't want the extra calories, so I poured all of the pudding into an 8" by 8" pan and sprinkled with a little raw sugar and cinnamon, then placed it under the broiler for a few minutes. Yum! Easily serves 9 or 10.

Too sweet, as other reviewers have mentioned -- had to thin out with more coconut milk. I also found it to be a little unidimensional in taste, with little complexity. I added cinnamon and cardamom for a little more kick. If I had ground ginger around I would probably add some of that too. On the plus side, if you omit the topping, this is ridiculously easy.

I made this recipe and my husband and I loved it! I then realized that this was vegan friendly and took it to work to feed the vegans, for a change. They gave it the overwhelming stamp of approval. This is a perfect example of comfort food-vegan or otherwise! The richness of the coconut milk makes upfor the lack of dairy. Also a great option for those who are lactose intolerant.

Big thumbs up. This pudding was soothing, tasty and exceptionally creamy. It was even better warm. I used arborio rice. For the liquid, I added one can of regular coconut milk and 24 oz. of regular milk because that's what I had on hand, but there was still a nice coconut flavor. Although I absolutely love vanilla, I almost liked it more without it (I used a Mexican vanilla extract). The pudding was a tad sweet on the sweet side, especially the next day as it set up, but adding a little milk balanced it with no problems. I did make the crispy coconut, which was great, but again perhaps a tiny bit too sweet. However, I also enjoyed it at breakfast sprinkled over yogurt with sliced bananas and homemade blackberry marmalade. Very easy to prepare ahead of time for guests. I will try it next time served with mango, grilled pineapple or carmellized bananas on top. A keeper!

This pudding was great--one of the best I've ever made. I made it just as specified, using the arborio rice, and added fresh blueberries once it had finished cooking and cooled a bit. I didn't make the crispy coconut. Would make this again in a heartbeat!

This was good, but lacked a bit of "zing" for me. I did not make the crispy coconut topping, so perhaps that's why, but I'd still like the pudding to have been tastier.

Really was a delicious dessert. I agree, though, that it was a tad bit sweet. I served grilled pinapple with it and the tanginess cut the sweetness as well as making for a stunning presentation. I also put a few pinapple leaves on the side of each dish -- beautiful! Also, I couldn't find light cococut milk, so I used the "water" from inside a fresh cococut and that seemed to work well. Will definitely be making this again.

Excellent recipe. I used only regular coconut milk and whole milk. Added lime zest at the end. My only comment would be that it was a little too sweet. The crispy coconut makes it a keeper.

Didn't make the crispy coconut. Ate with sprinkiling of cinnamon. Thought it might be good with sliced mango on the side, or some other fruit.

It was delicious. It was eaten up by the first day. Also took some to work and people were asking for the recipe.

This was so-so. My husband liked it but I thought the texture was weird. Also, the coconut flavor wasn't that dreamy exotic taste. It was more like bland coconut goo.

Really delicious and easy. Big hit at a dinner party. Also, looks pretty in a glass dish.
