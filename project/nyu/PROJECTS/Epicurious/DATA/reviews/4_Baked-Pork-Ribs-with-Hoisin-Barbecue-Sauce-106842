Wow. This is a definite keeper. Didn't use the five spice powder but otherwise followed everything exactly. To accompany it I made "Dang Cold Asian Noodle Salad" from Guy Fieri at the Food Network and it was a real hit. People couldn't get enough of both dishes...

Yum! I made this according to the recipe, except that I didn't have onion powder and instead of adding chili-garlic sauce I used Hoisin sauce that I had garlic in it. They were even better the next day after heating them in a pan on the stove top and letting the sauce thicken.

I have WONDERFUL results when I oven-bake my ribs in a foil packet with some liquid - beer, apple juice, water - at about 250 for 1.5 hours, then grill for 15-20 minutes to char a bit. Always tender, rave reviews.

Low fuss and economical dish to make for a casual party since all the active prep is done the night before. I used spare ribs (that is all the store had) and they turned out wonderful. I followed the recipe except baked at 400F for 30 min, then at 300F for 1.5 hours in a covered foil lined pan. Ribs came out moist, falling off the bone, and nicely spiced. Keeper at our house, thank you for the recipe.

i made this last night -- too cold to bbq, so i baked them instead. i used country-style pork ribs; falling off the bone, when i pulled it from the oven (yum)! a bit spicy for the kids, may tone down the chili sauce next time.

I made preparations in both styles and by far the consensus was the grilled ribs were the way to go. Highly recommend.

This is a great recipe when you don't want to grill outdoors. I've made it with beef and pork ribs, used the 5-spice/hoisin and used my own rub/ sauce. Doesn't matter; the end results are still great. This proves you don't have to boil ribs before cooking.

i made this recipe as part of my lunar new year dinner. i was very pleased with how well it turned out. i was a little worried about the five spice given all the negative comments in the reviews but it was perfectly fine. i just used some random five spice blend from the asian market, sriracha for the chili sauce, Lee Kum Kee brand hoisin, and all the other listed ingredients. The dish turned out reminicient of my Cantonese Grandmother's ribs, but not exactly like them. I'd roast them longer uncovered next time to get a nice roasted crust.

Made the ribs pretty much by the recipe. Since I was forewarned about a sticky mess I lined the pan with parchment and covered it with it too. I laid a cookie cooling rack over the top to weight it down. I cooked at 2 hours @ 300 degrees. Uncovered for another half hour. Still allot of liquid and the drums were beating for dinner I decided to thicken the sauce on top of the stove with a bit of cornstarch. Worked beautifully. I used a homemade 5-spice powder that I store in the freezer. Adds a mystery to the recipe. Kept the left over sauce for another time to perk up some other mystery meat. A nice addition on the side was some sour cream laced with horsradish. It calms down the spice and adds something to the dish. I bet this sauce would be good with chicken or pork too.

Great! Used my Le Creusset casserole; man, I love that thing; everything in it comes out beautifully done--no crockpot can compare (but couldn't be without my crockpots either). Made with country style meaty pork ribs; skipped five spice powder; added more ginger and used oven baked garlic I had on hand from another meal. Delish, economical and easy.

These ribs were awesome, and my 9 year old boy loved them. I only spiced them with salt, pepper and onion powder and they were just fine. Would definitely make these again.

These ribs were easy to prepare and delicious. Not all 5 spice mixtures are created equally. I used the President's Choice variety which comes in its own grinder. Think I'll use the marinade with a pork loin roast next time.

Our barbecue is out of commission, so I was looking for an oven recipe for ribs. The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was the bottled chili sauce, so I used 1/2 cup of regular barbecue sauce instead. The result was great (my husband cleaned his plate) and this was a very easy dish to make. However, next time I would either invest in a non- stick roasting pan or line the pan with foil. No amount of chiseling would remove the baked-on mess; I had to throw away my Pyrex baking dish.

I thought these ribs should have gone for a while longer in the oven - they were still a little tough at 1 hr. For a picture (and my own sauce recipe) see http://scottsfoodblog.com/2008/02/10/orange-ginger-chinese-shortribs/

Agree with Cook from Mountain View: 1 TB. minced garlic + 1 extra TB. minced ginger. I, also, increased chili-garlic sauce to 2 TB. and used, only, 1/2 tsp. Five-Spice. Problem with Five-Spice brands is all are, proportionately, different ~ I used Spice Islands. Baked, covered, at 300 for one hour, uncovered and baked 45-50 mins. at 350 - were, perfectly, tender and not "falling off the bone" as that's too cooked for me! This recipe will be repeated, often.

If you don't like five-spice powder, try mixing 2T each cinnamon and black pepper, add 1T each ground cloves and ground corriander. Omit the onion powder. Rub it into the meat and refrigerate overnight. Cook it in the rest of the sauce. I bake at 250 degrees for 2 hours. Much more tender.

I've made these many times now and they are always a hit. I use sriracha for chili sauce because it has such great flavor. I have made this on occassion without marinating overnight - a few hours in the fridge works just fine.

My husband and I loved these; he proclaimed them the best ribs we've ever made. So easy to make. I am not a big fan of Five Spice Powder, but these ribs may turn me into a believer.

I must say that I was doubtful when I saw the ingredients. But this is such an EEEEasy way to do ribs and really quite good. I'm actually looking forward to making it again.

Just not what I expected. I'll try it again but my first reaction was that, while nice and tender, this dish is well below average. Other than the five spice, which was a bit over powering it seemed to lack flavor. Maybe if I added some heat to it and thickened the sauce a bit before baking the ribs.

This is one of my two or three favorite recipes to make. I do make a couple changes - I use boneless pork ribs, and instead of using a full cup of hoisin sauce, I use 1/2 hoisin sauce and 1/2 soy sauce to cut the carbs, as my fiancee is diabetic. I also made this recipe for my parents and grandmother, and it got rave reviews.

Although I'm usually a purist and don't modify recipes, at least not the first time I make them, I did use this recipe in combination with a ribs and sauerkraut recipe which called for a bottled barbecue sauce. I drained the sauerkraut, put the five-spice rubbed rubs (yes, I used the five-spice and thought it was just fine) on the kraut, and marinated the ribs overnight, turning once, and then baking according to the directions. I've made this twice, with rave reviews!

This is great! I agree forget the five spice, and I used onion salt instead of powder. Found an hour to be the correct amount of time for cooking.

I have made this recipe for pork several times using country style ribs and chops. Excellent . Except cooking time need to be shortened . The stated times are too long . The first time I made it the ribs were very overdone.

Rating: 4
It was four forks with a major modification -- no five spice. Like the reviewer below, I omitted it the second time I made this (not worth reviewing when made with the five spice). The five spice is totally overwhelming and not complimentary. Hoisin sauce (or a thai bbq sauce) and good quality ribs are enough to make a finger lickin' meal with this method. Some may sniff at oven baked ribs, but they are really good! Perfect for those who 1) don't want to or 2) can't bbq outside (like me today because it is raining . . . yes, it does rain in Southern California).

I skipped the 5 spice altogether and they were great. We served them at our wine club and everyone loved them. They're the best ribs we've eaten - not to mention very easy,

Not bad, but not great, I love five spice (use with pork chops frequently) but thought it was overwhelming in this dish. Next time I would reduce the amount in rub by half. I liked the combo of other ingredients, tho I did increase the chili garlic sauce for more heat.

Wow, did I ever mess this up! I started with the wine a little early, and when it was time to do the ribs, I reasoned, "Well, if they're good at half an hour, they'll be REALLY tender after a couple of hours." Once the smoke cleared, it was obvious that they were charred mostly beyond consumption. We managed to pick around the black parts, and that was really tasty! The baked potatoes were not bad, but next time I'll roast them.

Holy crap, this was hot! Good (and different) flavor, but the next time I think I'll cut the chili sauce in half. My lips are still burning from eating it an hour ago. Doesn't taste like the chinese Char Siu sauce, in case you think it does.

This is my favorite ribs receipe. I BBQ them, and they turn out awesome every time! At our tailgate parties, my friends alternate between requesting these or the cherry coke receipe, but these are sooo much faster to prepare!

To the cook from Haddonfield, haven't tried this yet. Of course you can use sambal, or anything else at all that YOU please!

Fabulous!! My husband and I loved this dish. We BBQ the ribs instead of baking in the oven and it turned out wonderfully. I also used boneless pork ribs instead of the baby back ribs. Again it turned out great. The flavors contrasted together to make a somewhat mild fruity flavor with a hint of spice. I will try to use this sauce with other meats such as chicken.

Very good; the marinade flavor really penetrated the meat. I used Heinz chili sauce.

Being a fan of Chinese 5 Spice I was interested to try this variation. Lovely piquant change. I put all the engredients in a plastic bag, suctioned out the air and left it to marinade. This makes sure all the meat has equal contact with the marinade. Very good with lamb flaps too.
