I didnt have any problems with this recipe. I've made it several times for dinner parties and on a date and have gotten rave reviews. I marinate the chicken for a few hours before BBQing and I wait until the charcoal is completely white before I through the chicken on. I constantly glaze it while it's cooking and it comes out great. I tend to use boneless/skinless chicken thighs, though, so I dont know if that makes a difference, but it always comes out juicy and tender. I added a little more tabasco sauce than is called for and it gives a great kick.

As others... not the best, but very good and very easy. I added 4 cloves of chopped Garlic and onion, but I didn't saute' them first, next time I will!!! And too, it didn't have the apple flavor I was expecting, so next time I'll probably use the whole concentrate (11.5oz). The Tabasco added a 'nice kick' but maybe just a slight 'tweak' for your own taste. I could have used just a little more 'BAM'! Overall, very good and again very, very easy. Good Eats ya'll...

I loved the effect of the thyme in the barbeque sauce. I couldn't find a 6 oz can of apple juice concentrate so I had to use a 12 oz and double the sauce. I didn't mind since it was so good. I marinated the chicken overnight. After I started cooking the chicken, I brought the sauce to a boil for 5 minutes and cooked it on medium until it was time to glaze the chicken. I thought the sauce could use some more thickening, so I would recommend starting the sauce reduction before starting the chicken. As previous reviewers mentioned, use indirect heat on the chicken after it's been glazed.

I agree that chicken tastes good though it's not the best. However, it's easy to do which makes it a winner. I've added sauteed crushed garlic and finely diced onion to the recipe. and used an oven instead of grill. the onion turned out caramelized and tasted wonderful. It was finger licking and everybody loved it. the rest of the sauce was mopped up too!

Would like to try this recipe but live in NYC, does anyone have recommendations on making this in a home rotiserrie machine?

I ended up blackening the chicken (unintentionally), so it's a good thing that it had skin. After pulling the skin off, the flavor of the chicken was very good.

Made this for a dinner party - we doubled the recipe to marinate it overnight and then served it with Apple Ginger Chutney (recipe from epicurious). It was very good, everyone that tried it really enjoyed it. I would definitely make it again.

Definitely marinate the chicken pieces beforehand, then reduce the glaze in a saucepan until nice and thick. I used a package of five chicken breast halves, as nobody in this family cares much for dark meat, and doubled the ingredient amounts for the glaze, and it worked perfectly. The leftover chicken, sliced, made great wrap sandwiches, with cheddar cheese and shredded romaine lettuce.

I made this recipe for guests at a barbeque. The recipe was simple- quick, and tasty!! The chicken was tender and moist- not dry like some chicken recipe's for the barbeque. I wouldn't rave about this recipe (it wasn't the best chicken ever) - but I would definately make it again considering how easy it was to prepare!!

To the cook from NYC. Try the review from Sally in CA, and place your chicken in the oven to finish.

Good recipe. Would definitely make again. Should definitely marinate and baste frequently to fully enjoy the recipe. Not as much apple flavoring as I had anticipated but still very good.

Yum! Used a grill pan instead of the grill due to the fact that I live in a Manhattan apartment and grilling outside is out of the question. This chicken turned out pretty well, although I still have problems gauging exactly how long to cook and how high in order to get the perfect crispy outside and fully cooked inside. I welcome any suggestions as to this issue...I cooked the chicken about 9 minutes on each side and then basted for about 5 minutes more on medium and it got a little burnt on the outside, but succulent in the middle

I have made this twice, two weekends in a row, and it is wonderful. I served it at an informal BBQ and it was a real hit! Easy and a nice switch to the normal BBQ routine. Highly recommended for this summer!

One of my favorite bbq recipes and a spring/summer staple recipe. Marinate the chicken overnight for best flavor. Rub with a little canola oil and season with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. Combine breasts in ziploc baggies with the marinade. I use 4 bone-in breasts; easily doubles for 8 or more. Be sure to strain the leftover marinade and boil for 5 minutes, then continue cooking to thicken a bit. Wonderful served on the side to pour over the chicken. As the glaze has a lot of sugar and burns easily, I bbq'd the chicken until golden and crispy outside then finished in the oven to make sure it was cooked through. Always a hit with my guests.

excellent glaze, used it on pork loin skewers. added a twist. marinated the skewers in hard cider (the kind you buy in the beer section of the grocery store). the smaller size of the skewers allowed the meat to cook before the glaze burned. excellent.

This is a great glaze w/ many uses . I used it on both chicken ( w/ marinating ) & country style pork ribs . Both were wonderful ! It will burn though , so use indirect heat after browning , & apply the glaze then . The pork got perfectly tender & the glaze just carmalized from the slow cooking . Try it !

It's even better with pork (chops, tenderloin, etc.).

We parboiled the chicken a little instead of marinating it and had less grill time and no burning. Served with a wild rice blend & salad & a "Nebraska chardonnay", Sorray, from James Arthur Vineyard in Raymond, NE.Would go another 1/2 fork , also!!P.S: Used skinless,boneless breasts, too.

This is a very nice glaze. I tasted it before applying it to the chicken and I thought it had too much thyme in it but once it's brushed on the chicken, it's terrific. I did not marinade the chicken first and it was fine.

i marinated beforehand and the fruit juices/sugar made the whole thing blacken/char much too much...came out very unattractive and i had to cut much of the burnt skin off. (charring is good, but this was ridiculous!) flavor was good, but not anything to get excited over.
