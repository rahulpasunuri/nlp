I don't know what I did wrong-I'm sure I used all the right stuff measured correctly. They flattened out completely and did not stay together as a cookie. I'll go back to oatmeal cookie recipe on the back of the oatmeal carton and throw in fruits and nuts. Definately will not make again.

This is a great simple recipe. I love that it has so few ingredients so they can be whipped up when you get the urge. I did think there was too much butter - I added more oats after the first batch. Next time I'll reduce the butter by half. I think it would also be good with chopped up green and red candied cherries.

I consider myself a cook, not a baker- but sheesh they're just cookies. Still only the second time in 5 years I've made them. They were FANTASTIC. I went down to 1/2 cup sugar as suggested, and just eyeballed the add-ins until the consistency looked right. I used raisins, chopped pecans, craisins and a few semi-sweet chocolate chips. I like chewy cookies so left them more in a ball shape. Delish.

Ok, just made these a second time, using a full 1 1/2 cups of fruit, and they didn't come out nearly as well as the first batch, when I only had 1 cup. Too much fruit. They're falling apart.

Rating: 4
I just made these with 1 cup of cranberries instead of the fruit variety listed. Not because I didn't want to use those other fruits, I just didn't have them. They came out perfectly! I love and will make again!

I was looking for a recipe to sneak a bunch of prunes into for my toddler, and this was it! Super easy, I cut the sugar WAY down (to about a 1/3 cup) and used whole wheat flour. Also added cinnamon. Absolutely delicious, my little guy is signing for "more" as I write this!

Great one bowl cookie recipe. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup as recommended and used sour cherries, coconut and pecans. Could probably have used a tad more sugar but it was still very good.

Rating: 4
Very good! I used sour cherries, apricots, and walnuts and the walnuts really cut the sweetness. I didn't do any other modifications. Cook for 10 minutes makes them perfectly chewy.

Used this recipe to try to make some cookies I buy at Elephant's Deli here in Portland. Only used 1/3 C brown sugar and then with the chopped apricots I added 1 pack of chopped macadamia nuts and 1/2 C Ghiradelli classic white chips. It is a great combo in cookies! They turned out great.

Made recipe without reading reviews, using the dried fruit I had at home (raisins, orange-flavored cranberries, pineapple bits). Next time I'd cut the sugar and add cinnamon as other reviewers suggested.

Rating: 3
I am pleased with this recipe, but I'd agree it is on the sweet side. I didn't change the amount of sugar in the recipe but i replaced all of the butter with apple sauce, used only wheat flour, added the recommended tsp of cinnamon and only used raisins. I think next time I make it I'll definitely start with a double batch and I'll cut back on the brown sugar. It's a good recipe, but it's not the amazing oatmeal cookie I was looking for.

Rating: 3
While the recipe was a fabulous idea it really really does need that teaspoon of cinnamon and it was definitely super sweet even with the lowered amount of sugar I used based on recommendations. The dates and sultanas I used were sweet enough. I didn't have any dried cherries but just substituted with more dates. Also I think me and epicurious have two different definitions of 'rounded tablespoon' and 'large cookie', because I managed 15 large cookies. Whoops!

Rating: 4
After reading reviews, I cut back to 1/2 cup sugar and added the cinnamon that so many had suggested. I also used 100% whole wheat pastry flour and added about 1/4 cup of applesauce. For fruit, I used golden raisins, dried cranberries, diced Medjool dates and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. They were exceptional - not overly sweet. An oatmeal cookie for grown-ups.

Rating: 4
Big hit as a Thanksgiving dessert extra! Instead of the dried fruit as listed, I put 3/4 c white chocolate chips and 3/4 c dried cranberries into the batter. Really delicious; guests were asking to bring them home. Wish I had made a double batch!

Rating: 4
These cookies were excellent! Will definitely make again. Like many, I doubled this recipe but used half butter and half plain yogurt instead of all of the butter and used 1 c brown sugar instead of 1.5. I also used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose. Then I substituted some of the dried fruits for chocolate chips. This was a big success!

Rating: 4
Very tasty. Made a double recipe, subbing mashed avocado and Smart Beat for half the butter, and it worked very well. (Will try a larger proportion of avocado next time, to see if it works). Used raisins and Craisins for the dried fruit, which cut down on the chopping, and added a teaspoon of Penzey's Apple Pie Spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, mace and cloves). Very chewy and good, and the kitchen is fragrant. Took a little bit more time to bake than it says, but that's probably because I made them large.

I'm munching on these cookies as I sit here writing this review. Used dried cranberries and chocolate chips for this recipe- What is an oatmeal cookie without chocolate??? Next time, I'm gonna double the recipe because they're almost gone.

Rating: 3
I thought these were very good and worth making again. I made similar changes to other reviewers; whole spelt flour instead of white flour, added 1 tsp cinnamon, subbed toasted walnuts for the prunes. I would definitely recommend doubling the recipe. I should have read it more closely, because I will be lucky if the few cookies this recipe made last 24 hours in my house. Also bake for the full 10 min!

My 11 y.o. and I made these today. The overall flavor was good, and in our oven, 11 minutes made for a nice chewy but cooked through cookie. A few smaller cookies got a little dark at the edges, but I kinda like that. For the fruit I used a bag of dried "Berries and Cherries", and that worked well. A little sweet--will use less sugar next time. I might try with whole wheat flour too.

I loved these cookies! I needed a healthy portable food for hiking and quick snacks and these were great. I did make some changes: I substituted 1/4 c smart balance/butter 50/50 mix and 1/4 cup yogurt instead of an entire stick of butter. I also used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose. I used 1/3 c dark choc chips, 1/3c dried cherries, 1/3c chopped almonds, 1/2 c dried cranberries. The recipe made more like 20 large cookies...not 30. Next time I make them I will probably cut back on the sugar a bit...they didn't need as much as called for. The cookies did need about 11-12 minutes to cook for me. Will definitely make again!

These cookies were a huge hit, even with people who claim not to like oatmeal cookies! I omitted the dried apricots and prunes, instead used 1 1/2 cups shredded coconut. The cookies turned out nice and chewy; flavors of cranberry and coconut mingled wonderfully.

I made a slight modification to "extras" in these cookies. I didn't use the prunes but added some white chocolate chunks. My kids and husband gobbled them up!

These cookies are delicious! Thought that you could reduce the sugar a bit, but all in all pretty damn good! Also used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose, and came out delish. Great recipe because you can continually mix and match what you put in.

These cookies were great. I too made some slight adjustments to the recipe--included some cinnamon and nutmeg--and because I didn't have all the listed dried fruits, I used a half cup of toasted and chopped almonds, half a cup of chocolate chips, and half a cup of Trader Joes dried fruit mix--cranberries, blueberries, raisins, currants, and cherries. INSANELY GOOD combo. I highly recommend it. The chocolate chips come as a decadent surprise.

Rating: 3
I used what I had, light brown sugar, all purpose flour, and a dried seven fruit blend (apricots, cherries, cranberries, currents,diced pineapple, blueberries and raspberries). Added chopped almonds and cinnamon and nutmeg. Lovely dough and a great finished product. Will put this in my cookie rotation and next time I will incorporate whole wheat flour.

These were a huge hit with the kids. I used dried apricots, golden raisins, and almond slivers in place of the dried fruit listed. The almonds gave them a nice nutty flavor. I will be making these again, no doubt.

I used half whole-wheat flour half all-purpose, cinnamon instead of vanilla extract (I was out), and then for the mix-ins I used 1/2 cup chopped almonds, 1/2 cup cherry-flavored craisons, 1/2 cup mini-chocolate chips... and they were fabulous! Every time I open the cookie jar, a gorgeous smell envelopes the room, and the taste is perfect. Big hit with my house-guests!

Rating: 3
These were really good. Like many other reviewers, I used whole-wheat flour, and added wheat germ and about 1T pumpkin pie spice (since I was too lazy to do each individually). For fruit, I used 1 cup dried apples, 1/2 cup dried cranberries and put in a handful of toasted walnuts. My three year old declared them 'delicious,' as do I.

Rating: 4
These cookies are great, I used the same modifications that everyone is agreeing on: 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, substituted whole wheat flour. In addition, I sprinkled some rock salt after taking the cookies out of the oven, trying to replicate these cookies that I found in Washington D.C. "Kayak Cookies" or "Salty Oats". Putting the salt on before baking doesn't have the same visual effect as afterwards.

I already had one of this little jewels and I´m so happy to have them baked¡¡ Wonderfull, chewy and tender.

A great start. Reduce the sugar and add dried apples to compensate resulting in more moist cookies. Cinnamon and nutmeg for sure make these irresistible.

Rating: 3
These were great and the best part about them is that you can still feel semi-virtuous while eating a cookie - due to the oatmeal and dried fruit. I used dried cherries and apricots but next time I think I will throw in some chopped walnuts and maybe even a little shredded coconut. I will make these again for sure.

Rating: 4
This was great! I used spices and whole wheat flour as recommended by other reviewers. I used 1 1/2 cups mixed dried fruit and nuts, including walnuts, raisins, apricots and cranberries. I chopped it all up pretty small, but next time will leave bigger chunks. Very chewy, just like I like.

Rating: 0
As a fan of this recipe, I decided to adapted it to try out some new ingredients. I substituted white whole wheat flour and Splenda brown sugar blend. While the consistency of the cookie was the same as with the original ingredients, the taste doesn't come close. But if, like me, you need to cut back on sugar and add more fiber to your diet, they are definitely okay.

Rating: 4
Super easy recipe, and turned out wonderfully. I just used 1.5 cups of cranberries, instead of the mixture, and I didn't bother with the flattening. In fact, I liked the cookies better when they were especially tall before baking.

Rating: 3
I made these the other night and followed other reviewers advice about spices and flour, using whole wheat flour, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and nutmeg. They were very good, although I actually like my oatmeal cookies a little crisper. Still, the mix of fruit (dried cranberries, raisins, apricots) was terrific and I think next time I might chop up a little crystalized ginger, too. Definitely worth another try.

With a few modifications this has become my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe. I use egg replacer instead of egg and Smart Balance in place of butter to make them vegan. I use a combination of dried cherries (3/4 cup), golden raisins (3/4 cup), and a 1/2 cup of pecans or walnuts (chopped and toasted). As suggested by other reviewers, I also add a dash of cinnamon. Everyone loves these cookies--no one ever suspects that they're vegan. They're chewy and satisfying.

Rating: 4
I love this healthy cookie! I haven't tried the modifications yet...but it's a hit with everybody who tries one. I did put my mixture into a bar pan and they turned out fabulous! It makes a wonderful "power bar" to take on the go.

I wanted to make these somewhat healthier so as with previous reviews, I used whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of cloves. Also added in some sweetened coconut. My 10-year-old loved it, the ultimate test!

My husband thought these were the best cookies I've ever made! I used most of the suggested revisions: Added spices (cinnamon, ginger, allspice, ground cloves, nutmeg), 1/4 c. wheat germ, 3/4 c. chopped walnuts, and unbleached flour. I also used a bag of Sun Maid chopped fruit bits for all of the dried fruit in the recipe, which may have been a little light--I think the bag was about 1 1/4 cups dried fruit. My yield was 24 cookies, so I baked them for a full 10 minutes. I used parchment and allowed them to cool on the paper, without any problems with the cookies being fragile. The heavenly description was right!

Love the taste of these, but they don't look appealing. They brown far to much (despite reduced cooking time), spread - make a thin, fragile cookie. Again, the taste is great - I'll keep working with this one.

The best oatmeal cookie! Moist and chewy. Modifications to recipe: whole-wheat flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 c. chopped walnuts. I made the cookies rather large so the recipe yield was 24 instead of 30. I would double the recipe next time.

I made these cookies for a catered event and they were a huge success. They looked store bought! I would do whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, add 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I used dried cherries and currants.

Yummm. These cookies were the best, especially if you like soft oatmeal cookies. I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon, 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. What a treat!

comfort food cookies. I doubled the recipe and added two smushed bananas, which made the cookies very moist. Next time, I'll use the bananas, but maybe cut out a bit of the butter. I also added cinnanmon and fresh ground nutmeg. Very homey. I'm sending them to my mom for her birthday.

Good, but they need more dimension... Added 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, 3/4 cup semisweet choc chips, the 1+ tsp cinnamon suggested, and 1/4 cup wheatgerm. I'm no healthfood nut, but these were chewy, complex and delicious.

HOLY TOLEDO, ARE THESE GOOD!!! I made these with dried cranberries, dates, and chopped pecans, and added the cinnamon that everyone recommended, plus ginger, cloves, and ground allspice. Transcendental: much greater than the sum of its parts. The ULTIMATE oatmeal cookies.

A great way to use up a bag of mixed dried fruit. These cookies turned out soft and moist. Definitely agree with the other reviewers - cinnamon is a must.

We REALLY liked these cookies - they were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I did add cinnamon and also some chopped nuts (pecans). Next time I will try it with whole wheat - this cookie could carry it off nicely!

Cinnamon is vital, as pointed out before. Makes a terrific cookie. The second batch was made with rather less sugar and a dot of applesauce as suggested by the same reviewer, and that was even better. Thanks to Whomever in Jamul, CA!

These are very good, with a great chewy consistency and (if you add the cinnamon suggested by another reviewer) a very nice flavor. I'll double the recipe next time--30 cookies are not enough!

URGENT!!! This recipe needs 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to complete the flavor, otherwise, the cookies, while they look good, are bland. The first time I made these, I stuck to the recipe. The second time, I used stone ground wheat flour, added the cinnamon, baked them for 8 minutes, then took them out, made an indention in the middle of each cookie, filled it with apple sauce and baked for 2 minutes more. Yum!! Like nutragrain bars, but way better for you and the kids.

Very nice oatmeal cookies. The combination of fruit makes an good taste experience. Will definitely make again.
