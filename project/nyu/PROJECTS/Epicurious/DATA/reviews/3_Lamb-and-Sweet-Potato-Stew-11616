As per suggestions, I doubled the recipe and also sauteed two or three shallots in oil, then added garlic (three cloves) for a minute, then browned the lamb in with the shallots and garlic. I substituted beef broth for water, added more wine, and put in three medium sliced carrots as well. Also added some chopped up rosemary. Left it all to stew for about 45 minutes. My husband loved it and requested it again in the same week! We tried this with beef as well, but the lamb was much better and more tender.

Very tasty with some help...I took others suggestions and used more garlic (3 cloves) and beef stock (1/2 cup wine and 3/4 cup stock). I also went low & long...simmered on lowest heat for 1.5 hours. I thought it needed more colour, so I sauteed a bit of parsley (1/4 cup chopped) and mint (3 tbsp chopped) in a bit of butter and added that to the stew for the last 1/2 hour of cooking time. The mint complemented the lamb and the sweetness of the potato quite nicely.

I am rating this recipe a 3 because it needed some tweaking to give it some zip. I read the reviews and followed most of the suggestions. The dish turned out a 4 with all the tweaks! Here are my changes. I used 3 cloves garlic and 2 shallots chopped. I substituted the water and wine called for in the recipe with 1 cup red wine and 1/2 cup strong beef broth. I added 1 tbsp fresh rosemary chopped and lastly I added 1/2 cup baby carrots sliced. When following the recipe I did so up to adding the wine and broth. I then simmered the meat in the wine and broth, covered, on low for 30minutes. I then added the veggies and simmered low, covered, for another 30minutes. The end result was fabulous. My husband thought it was fantastic with the combination of flavor and the lamb was very tender and delish.

I made the recipe first as written. I liked the combination of flavors but 30 minutes is not nearly enough cooking time to soften lamb shoulder. You have to cook it low and slow. The lamb was tough. I might make it again but in a crock pot.

I have made this so many times I've lost count! What I do different: Use 1½ c of a gutsy red like Merlot or Shiraz and 2 T of concentrated stock instead of water. I also use double or more of the garlic and sweet potato called for. Use a whole cinnamon stick not powder! I always at least treble this recipe. Oftentimes bake this in the oven in a massive covered LeCreuset iron casserole instead of doing it on the stovetop (350°F/160°C 1-1½ hours.) If you keep frozen diced lamb in the freezer, this dish is a snip to prepare for unexpected guests.

Hubby and I loved this; could only find bone-in arm blade chops at the store, so I trimmed meat myself. Also, used non-alcoholic red wine (liquor store closed on Sunday) and substituted beef broth for water, as suggested by previous reviewers. Added some rosemary, too. Delicious!!

I doctored this a bit by adding orange juice to the stew broth..I also used ground cinnamon..5 hot marinated garlic cloves and tarragon..just a pinch!! I started by adding cinnamon to the flour mixture and then added more to the stew..I didn't find it at all bland and maybe those who did can try this..very hearty

I did find this quite bland, but then went heavy on the ground black pepper and threw in some brown sugar, mmmm, kinda sweet and spicy.

This is a great winter recipe when you're looking for a stew that's different from the standard beef and vegetables. I doubled this recipe and used beef stock instead of water. My husband and father-in-law loved it!

My husband says "It was bland and unappetizing." When I told him the recipe was going inthe trash he said "good." Though the recipe is easy, it isn't worth making. I can't think of anything to add to make it more palatable.

I've made this stew many times and my guests always ask for the recipe. It's quick, easy, and great comfort food. I add extra wine and use vegetable stock instead of water. Make enough for leftovers!
