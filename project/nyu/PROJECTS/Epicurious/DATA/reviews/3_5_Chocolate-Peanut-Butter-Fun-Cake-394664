This cake was fantastic! I have made it twice since I saw the recipe in the magazine. It was a hit at both events. The cake is so moist and the frosting is just so good. I will be making this one again and again.

This cake was really fun to make. It was really quick and easy to slap the batter together and get the cake into the oven. The frosting took a little while longer, but was really fun to make. Everybody loved the cake, which I made for my son's 15th birthday.

I made this for my wine club last night -- the theme was 'party wines' and this was a perfect fit! I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips (but more like a cup) in the batter and it had a deep chocolate flavor. I was a little intimidated by the frosting technique but it was great and everyone asked for the recipe. Definitely a do-again!

The chocolate cake lacks flavor. I used Valrhona 61% chocolate and cocoa powder, but it was wasted on this cake! It looks pretty, and I may try the frosting and topping on another chocolate cake, (even a mix would be better than this) but this cake recipe is a definite NO. And what's the point of a vegan cake with eggs and butter in the frosting???

Although I've been a fan and avid user of this site since it's inception, I have never ever felt compelled to rate a recipe. This cake, however, is a different matter. I made it as a "boyfriend birthday" experiment to see what it tasted like. At this point, who cares about him. So yummy. So easy. So going-into-the recipe-file to make again. One trouble spot was getting it out of the square pan. When I remake it next week for the BF, I'll simply put it in one layer of a round cake pan dusted with cocoa powder. Yummish!
