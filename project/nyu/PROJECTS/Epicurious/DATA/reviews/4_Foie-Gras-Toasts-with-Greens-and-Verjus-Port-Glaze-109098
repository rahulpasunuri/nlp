This is a great recipe and is an easy intro to serving fois gras. I have used canned fois gras with great success. It is no problem letting the fois gras sit on the toasts for up to 1 hour. I used EVO instead of the walnut oil

This was awesome! I used mache lettuce rather than the combination in the recipe and used fresh meyer lemon juice as I was unable to find white verjus. I garnished the dish with pomegranate seeds which added a nice tart-ness and made for a really nice presentation!

Wonderful. I tried to find micro greens and use them just to top the toasts, but couldn't find so used baby lettuces and that worked ok. I didn't use all the greens as I wanted this for a pick up appetizer.

Absolutley delish...I used organic sping greens and followed the rest as written. A complete hit and easy.

This was the first time I made this, and it turned out great. I substited a spring mix for the radiccio etc(too bitter) and used those small loaves of pumpernickle found in the deli department for the toasts. The Port sauce really added great flavor the the foie gras.
