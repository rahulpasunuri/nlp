Used sherry vinegar and smoked oysters to make sandwiches with whole grain bread. Wonderful flavor. I would slice rounds instead of julienne for sandwiches though in the future.

This dish was a fair bit of work, but worth every minute! The beets lend a tart flavour to the poached oysters and the garnish cools it all. We enjoyed the festive presentation with the red and the green. Even guests who thought they did not like oysters were impressed.
