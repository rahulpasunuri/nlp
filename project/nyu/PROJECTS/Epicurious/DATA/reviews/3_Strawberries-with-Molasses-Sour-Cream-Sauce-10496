Non-typical use of sour cream. Has a light caramel/coffee flavor.

Delicious! Such an unusual combination. The sauce almost tastes like caramel. I'll be using this recipe for many strawberry seasons to come.

This was extremely easy to make and since most of these items are kept on hand, it is a great last minute dessert. It really has a nice combination of sweet and tangy, but in some ways the molasses flavor overpowers the berries. I will probably make this again, but good old fashioned whipped cream is still the best!
