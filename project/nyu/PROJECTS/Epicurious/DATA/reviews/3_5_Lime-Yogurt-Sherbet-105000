Simple, easy, tangy and just right for summer. I used a mix of fresh lime juice and pineapple juice and it was fantastic. Melted nicely in punch as well!

Tangy at first, then tastes creamy. Very refreshing by itself, but is also good with white cake.

Made this for Father's Day- was only OK...very tart and didn't thicken up like one would expect. May be better the next day or with tequilla in a blender. Will try again when the limes in my backyard are rip.

Used 1% milk, otherwise followed the recipe. Excellent. Served with ginger snaps.

I've made these several times, using the custard as a base and adding different fruit juices as a whim. Works well w/ boiled-down raspberries too.

I halved the recipe and skipped the chill-in-fridge step. Instead, I poured them directly into popsicle molds and froze. Yum! Even my toddler liked them.

This was a simple, delicious, cool summer dessert - not too sweet,nice and citrus - I'll definitely make this again - it would be great with lemons or oranges as well!

2o minutes active time, is minimal compared to the overcome! I use a Cuisinart Ice Cream maker machine for the perfect result. I made this in the fall and was very pleased,and now I am making it for a finale to celebration dinner featuring w a Pork Loin Roast stuffed with Prunes & anchovy. The sherbet surprises with its creamy texture (eat your heart out Haagan Daz)followed by the tangy bite of the lime zest....YUMMY!

I'm actually going to rate this "sherbet" since everyone else seems so concerned with how "it's" spelled (really, you people need to get a life). This recipe provides all of the creaminess of really good ice cream with only 1 egg. It has a great lime flavor and is easy to make. For texture, I added the seeds from one pomegrante. Everyone loved it! Served it without the waffle cones, but I'll use them when I make this again next summer.

The fact that "it's" is used in error all across the USA does not make it any less a travesty. This country is losing its literacy in many ways, and they should not be condoned. As for "one-upping," the original post from WA started it all by trying to "correct" what is already correct.

Has anyone made this sherbet/sherbert yet?

Get a life! No matter how sherbert is spelled, you what it refers to, and the difference between it's and its is mistaken throughout the USA. However, you know the intent of the word. How about simply cooking?

I thought this was for rating the recipes. I always read the ratings before trying them. But this one is so off the wall, I can't believe how some many people are so picky about a word! Sherbet or sherbert. Who cares, just rate the recipes!

Has anyone actually MADE this, or is everyone too busy one-upping each other?

Ahhh...no matter how it is spelled, did you like the actual recipe? Or, are you, JB, trying to show folks how much (or how little) you actually know? "Sherbet" and "Sherbert" are interchangeable, so it doesn't matter. I liked the recipe--easy to make. I suspect the sherbert will become quite icy as it sits in the freezer, however. That's probably why the recipe calls for using it on the same day of prep. Lovely, bright flavor.

"Sherbet" is the preferred spelling and closer in pronunciation to the word's origin. My guess is that "sherbert" has found its way into dictionaries because it's such a persistent misspelling that it can't be ignored. Anyway, I'd never use "I've seen it many times" as an argument for anything's verity. For instance, I see "it's" confused with "its" all the time. "It's" = "it is"; "its" is the possessive of "it," just as "his" (not "hi's") is the possessive of "him." By the way, Epicurious.com employees will probably never see these comments. Therefore pointing out a misspelling here is useless.

Actually, I've seen it spelled both ways. Its fairly interchangeable.

I haven't tried this yet, but I thought you should know that you misspelled "sherbet." I'm hoping it tastes as good as it sounds.
