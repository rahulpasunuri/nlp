I like this recipe because it was so quick and easy. However, I didn't have any capers so I substituted a whole can of artichoke hearts (drained) and some orange bell pepper. I also thickened the sauce with a little corn starch and water and served it (with the chicken) over fettucini garnished with a little parmesan.

When I saw the ingredients in this recipe I figured there was no way it couldn't be good. Wrong. It looked nice and fresh in the pan before adding the tomato paste. Afterwards it was just gloppy. We ate it, but tossed the leftovers. I doubt I will try this again, but I will definitely omit the tomato paste and beef up the spices if I do.

Truly simple,delicious and company worthy. Used canned romas BUT poured off the can juice before adding to pan. Only other sub was balsamic and xtra garlic. Mine was not soupy. I also added the artichoke hearts. The sauce is good enough to stand on it's own with pasta Its a keeper!

I tried this as my husband loves capers and it was outstanding. I used canned fire roasted diced tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, dried tarragon and no tomato paste. Quick and delicious!

Loved the meaty taste that this sauce developed - really a surprise and delicious. I used extra garlic and shallots, as I am prone to do in almost all dishes, but followed the recipe as written using fresh tomatoes and herbs from the garden. I would make this for guests, I think it's simple and tastes expensive.

Very tasty, easy and quick. Next time I'll add more garlic & shallots and use balsamic vinegar.

This was very easy. I used 1.5 lbs cut up chicken breast, lightly floured; a 32 oz can of tomato fresh cuts drained,1 small can tomato paste, 3+ T fresh tarragon, 2 large shallots, 4 cloves garlic, the rest pretty much as stated. I had asparagus, so I fried that and added it when it would be done crispy. I added a bit of the shallot and garlic as I was finishing each batch of chicken, then put the bowl in my warming oven. I like the idea of artichoke hearts and kalamata olives.

I made this for my husband and I, it's a good weeknight meal, I doubled the amount of garlic & reduced the amount of capers and added chopped up Kalamata olives, and served it on a bed of creamy polenta my husband really liked it.

I'm giving this recipe 2.5 stars, as is. The dish was nice, basic, but lacked flavor "pop." I followed the recipe to a tee, but were I to make this next time, I would 1. double the tarragon 2. increase the shallots and garlic 3. increase the wine slightly 4. add artichoke hearts or some other flavorful veggie, as suggested in prior reviews. All in all, a decent basic recipe that would benefit from some fiddling.

This was wonderful, although a little labor-intensive for a working girl on a weeknight, maybe a Friday night supper? My boyfriend had a great suggestion..serve this over angelhair pasta! Maybe add a couple of T. of the tomato paste to make it a little thicker. Yummy!

I found this recipe very easy and my family loved it. I substituted fresh basil for the tarragon. Also I used the vinegar in the capers instead of draining them and did not add the tomato paste. Also increased garlic and onions. I served it over fresh whole wheat linquine and topped it with grated asiago. Wonderful!!

Basil! I was trying to use up items from the garden. Added fesh basil instead of the tarragon. I didn't have capers. Sprinkled with parm cheese. Very good- even the kids ate it.

Not sure what all the fuss is about-- the sauce is pretty good, but the chicken picks up very little flavor from it, so the overall effect is quite bland (boring chicken breast with a bit of zing on top). Made a few small changes: used two large boneless breasts; half fresh and half canned tomatoes; oregano and a little fresh thyme instead of tarragon; chardonnay (not exactly dry, but all I had); added a pinch of red pepper flakes (gave it a nice heat); removed breasts when cooked through and reduced the sauce, as many suggested; and served with fettucine. The other flavors definitely outweighed the tomato taste; I'd probably add more tomato and tomato paste, use less vinegar, forget about the chicken altogether, and serve over pasta. Overall, taste was so-so for all the ingredients! Maybe it will be better as leftovers....

Rating: 3
Great recipe! Like many before, I served it over angel hair pasta. Quick and easy because almost everything was already in my pantry, and what wasn't was easy to substitute (yellow onions, canned diced tomatoes). Will definitely make this a staple!

I have now made this recipe several times. Quick and easy and leftovers are very good. I add more shallots or onions and much more garlic. Have used breasts but boneless, skinless thighs are also great. I serve with angel hair pasta and fresh parmesian. Also, I use a large can of diced plum tomatoes.

Rating: 2
I made this exactly as written. It seemed a little bland. Many reviews that love this dish, seem to alter the ingredients. As written, it's missing something. If I could, I would give it a 2 1/2 fork rating. I won't be making this again. I think this is overrated.

Rating: 4
This recipe is so easy, and the results are gourmet! I add one can of artichoke hearts, sliced into quarters. I also use 1/2 cup chopped yellow or white onion instead of the shallots. If I don't want to stop at the store for plum tomatoes, I use a can of diced tomatoes.

Excellent recipe! Enjoyed by the entire family, including two young children who gobbled it up. Also used canned plum tomatoes - very flavourful. It will become a staple.

This was a very easy recipe. My chicken breasts were pretty thick and I didn't brown them long enough on each side so I had to cook additional time in sauce, maybe 15 minutes. The sauce was very tasty. My husband and kids really enjoyed it too!!

Really, really, really good. And I have never been a big fan of tarragon. Make lots and lots of this sauce, then put it on everything... well not everything. There is something in the tarragon-vinegar-wine combination that just comes together beautifully. Oh yes, we skipped the capers and used canned organic plum tomatoes as that was all that was on hand. Delicious, quick and simple. I'll make this over and over

tried this tonight, absolutely fabulous (and shockingly easy). i added red pepper flakes and about 8 kalamata olives. cut the chicken in strips after it was cooked and tossed with sauce and angel hair pasta - absolutely lovely. i agree with the others - definitely remove the chicken while you're reducing the sauce or it will be overcooked. i cooked mine for 7-8 minutes and let the sauce reduce over another 7 or so.

Very quick, easy to make and everyone loved it. I didn't have tomato paste either and was scrounging for something that might substitute. Found some Thai roasted red chili paste in the back of the fridge and added a teaspoon full. This added a little zip to the entire recipe and really enhanced the other flavors.

Excellent and easy! I didn't have tmatoe paste and it tasted great. My children were being high maintenance and I accidentally reduced the sauce to the point where it had no liquid. It was delicious.

This was so yummy! Quick and easy to prepare, truly unique flavor combos - sweetness of tarragon, salty taste of capers - they blended beautifully. My only sub was 1 cup of low-salt chicken broth for the white wine, which I would definitely do again. I used fresh plum tomatoes and they were fabulous, but I think canned would work fine in a pinch. The sauce was thin for sure, but it cooked down nicely in 10 minutes or so. I served it over pasta - my husband and I were licking our plates clean. Enjoy!

I've been making this for several years now, it is great! For a while I dusted teh chicken breasts with flour, but in current low-carb incarnation, I just let the sauce reduce to thicken, and that works great. Lovely and easy...with patience you can thicken almost any sauce without cornstarch or flour.

I made this with vermouth and it had a lovely flavor to it. I also used canned tomatoes and dried herbs as I didn't have fresh. Otherwise, I followed it as written. I served it atop a bed of angel hair pasta with a simple arugula salad. It was pretty simple, tasty and quick.

This was a very tasty recipe, though I modified it also. I browned the chicken breasts and then removed them to a platter. I sauteed 3 chopped shallots, 4 cloves, and added 2 teaspoons of dried tarragon. I added a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes in places of the fresh tomatoes. In addition, I added one can of tomato paste which resulted in a nice thick pasta sauce. I did use 4 tablespoons of capers and one cup of white wine. I simmered the sauce for about 15 minutes then added the chicken breasts and simmered for another ten minutes. Yum!

Rating: 2
I was truly disappointed with how this dish turned out, after reading all the reviews. The sauce smelled wonderful as it was cooking but, for some reason, I didn't feel it went as well with the chicken (chicken turned out good as well). Ended up using sauce on some pasta and that was great!!

Rating: 3
I would give this 3 1/2 if possible. I made this last night and loved it. I used canned tomatoes since ripe tomatoes are not available this time of year. I did remove the chicken from the pan so it would not get over cooked while I reduced the sauce. Great flavors. It is very easy with ingredients that are usually on hand.

Rating: 3
I liked this very much. Next time, though, I'll fry the chicken first until done and then remove it from the pan. I thought it had become a bit dry the last time, due to it being overcooked. Fifteen minutes is really too long for chicken breasts. The tarragon gives a wonderful flavour to the sauce. The capers are also a must.

Yummmmmm! My 9 year old prepared this last night and it was terrific. We used canned tomatoes and balsamic as well - as that's all we had.

My husband has declared this dish his new favorite! I substitued a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I also removed the chicken after it was cooked and simmered the tomato mixture until it thickened. I forgot the tarragon, but it was still great. I served it with lemon risotto (recipe also from this site) with feta. This will become a staple recipe.

This was delicious. When I make it again, I will cut down on the vineger (but not omit it) because the capers make this acid enough. Don't skip the wine, as another reviewer suggested! I used cherry tomatoes. I also added a bouillion cube for more intense seasoning and served with roasted potatoes. This sauce would compliment a fish - like a sea bass. Enjoy.

This was just delicious. My husband doesn't like capers, so omitted them from the recipe. I reduced the sauce, as suggested by other reviewers. To thicken the sauce slightly more, I mixed about 2 teaspoons of flour with a little bit of water and added it to the sauce while it was simmering. My husband came home from work late, so I ended up simmering it on very low heat for about 45 minutes, and it was perfect served with broiled pesto-smothered french bread.

Made a few substitutions because of what I had on hand and still thought it was good: used onion and about 5 Tblsps. of it, used grape tomatoes, and didn't have tomato paste. I think the sweetness of the grape tomatoes is a nice contrast to the capers, which I LOVE! I also removed the chicken from the skillet, made and reduced the sauce and then added the chicken back in for the 10 mins. called for. Terrific! KIMBER

I should have followed the advise in the reviews and reduced the sauce more. I had leftovers and the next day I added some chicken stips and the sauce was a little thicker. Best lefover I've had in a while.

Great recipe! I followed one reviewer's suggestion, and cut the chicken into strips. I dredged them in flour, though, and wouldn't do that again - no yummy brown bit in the pan. Also, I didn't have enough tarragon, so threw in some fresh rosemary. It was quite good. I doubled the recipe and served it over homemade fettucine. Next time I might make extra sauce as everyone was wiping their plates with their bread! Sure sign of a winner.

This was a delicious weeknight dish. I used a whole can of canned tomatoes. Cut the parsley in half (just too much parsley!) and added a lot more garlic - probably about 1 T. Also added a dash of red pepper flakes. I made this for two people, but did not cut the amount of sauce in half. It was great to have a bit of extra sauce with the mashed potatoes. Important change: do not keep the chicken cooking in the sauce for the entire time. It will be seriously overcooked. I browned the chicken (about 7 minutes total) and then set it aside tented in foil. Then I made the sauce, reduced it until it got nice and chunky. Then put the chicken back in for about 30 seconds, just to reheat it. It was perfect! Very flavorful. Would also be good if you cut the chicken in strips and tossed it with pasta.

This is a great weeknight supper. Simple ingredients, only dirties one dish, lots of flavor. I actually used chicken stock instead of white wine, still tasted great. I also let the sauce reduce a bit and that worked well too.

Like other cooks, I reduced the sauce a little at the end. I left the amount of capers as called for in the recipe though, as capers are a big family favorite. I do find that I need to double the recipe when I make it though as people seem to eat more than normal when it is served. Quick, easy, plates nicely -- what could be better!

I may have changed to the total direction of this dish by doing this, but I substituted Herbes de Provence for the tarragon. I'm just not big on tarragon. It was a wonderful outcome. I took the test kitchen's suggestions and cut the capers down to 2 T and rinsed them first. Also used canned tomatoes as suggested. THE SAUCE IS EXCELLENT!! May double next time. Chicken was slightly overcooked so will remove from pan when making sauce next time. Overall, excellent and a great weeknight dinner.

This recipe is very flavorful, I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used 2T of capers and dredged the chicken before cooking, served with pasta. We ate it, it was ok, nobody got all excited. I will make it again since it was an easy weekday meal with items from the cupboard, but it's on our 'once in a blue moon list'. We like all the ingredients (including capers), but I found that I couldn't really taste the tomatoes much, the other ingredients overpowered them. Perhaps next time I will cut back on the vinegar a bit?

This recipe is simple and elegant. It's very easy to prepare and the combination of flavors make for a gourmet presentation. I served it to guests with sides of garlic roasted potatoes and mushrooms in wine sauce. Though I made twice as much as needed, there were no leftovers. You can serve this with confidence. Gail Moe

Nice enough for company, easy and quick enough for a busy night. My 3-1/2 yr old cleaned his plate but my husband thought it lacked zing (though he also finished his portion). I halved the amount of capers as some reviewers recommended, but didn't think that was enough. The parsley, on the other hand, seemed a bit much at 4T and I would halve that next time. Used a 15-oz can of diced tomatoes and liked the saucy results over brown rice. Will make this again.

This was GREAT! I was amazed at how easy it was, it took just 30 minutes start to finish. I dredged the chicken breasts in a little flour before cooking them; they come out more finished that way. Also, I saw the other reviews about the thin sauce, so I raised the heat & simmered it with no lid for a few minutes at the end, and it came out with perfect consistency (the flour probably helped, also). I served it over fresh herb linguine, and it was a great pasta sauce, too. This is nice enough for company, but easy enough for anytime, & we'll have it again!

Definitely a quick and easy meal that I will make again. I made this because I had some left over barbecued chicken that I wanted to do something different with. I cut up the chicken and sauted it for a few minutes to heat it up before adding the rest of the ingredients.

I served it over angel hair pasta.

This was excellent; wonderful flavor. I'm a capers fan, but 2 Tbsp. was plenty in this recipe. I had to substitute a can of diced tomatoes, and that worked out fine. I had an extra can of tomato paste on hand but didn't use it; a little extra time to reduce the sauce was all the thickening it needed. This was great with a side of pasta tossed with a smidge of olive oil and some fresh parsley. We'll definately have this again.

Delicious, and elegant enough for a dinner party. I reduced white wine to 1/2 cup, capers to 2 TBS, used olive oil instead of butter, and served it with mashed potatoes and "Roasted Fennel with Goat Cheese" from this site. Voila. No need to thicken by adding paste, by the way: simply turn up the heat and reduce to desired consistency.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe! I followed the Taster's Notes and modified it a bit with excellent results. I am not a big fan of chicken breasts, so I used thighs and drumsticks (3 each). Because I am lazy, I sauteed them with the skin and bones on, using only 1 T of butter and no oil. At the end of the recipe (when the chicken was cooked), I then removed the skin and bones. I made this ahead of time so I could de-fat it. It tastes even better the next day, and it reheats beautifully. I also followed the Taster's Notes suggestion of reducing the amount of capers -- I used 2 heaping T (instead of 4 T). Just right! Also, I didn't have shallots, so I used chopped yellow onion. And, being a big garlic fan, I doubled the amount of garlic to a generous 2 teaspoons. One more modification that everybody loved -- I used a (10 oz.) can of diced Ro-Tel tomatoes instead of fresh or regular canned. Ro-Tel is a spicy mix of green chilies and tomatoes. It gives the dish a little kick that is oh-so-yummy!!! Although I am sure it would be good with pasta, I couldn't get people to stop eating it straight from the pot!! By the way, I found my large skillet a little too small, so I used a larger pot for the whole thing (I've made this recipe about 5 times and have had repeated requests for the recipe). A real WINNER!!

This is a good, fast and easy to make recipe that had better than expected taste. The sauce was a bit thin and "runny", so next time I'll either cook the sauce longer or use a thickener. I also think this could be a good dish on a bed of linguine.
