I make this recipe every year that I go home to visit my Italian family in New Jersey. It's now a showpiece of the 7 fishes Christmas Eve Feast. Mi familia is very picky, so I was terrified to re- introduce Baccala back into the family again after a 40 year hiatus. My grandfather used to make it, but no one has dared since he died - God rest his soul. I found this recipe a couple of years ago and it was an instant hit. I was once again the golden boy of the family - but that's another story. You have to be really picky about where you buy the Baccala. Ask around and if people don't know what you're talking about - make clams casino. I follow the recipe almost exactly, but I use a little more lemon and regular parsley. I always soak the fish for 3 days. My grandfather said it was good luck. God love the Italians! Mangia! Jim

Great dish for Italian Christmas Eve - as close to my Grandmother's as I've found.

I finally tried this recipe (my first time working with salt cod) and it was really good. BUT, I didn't even look at the picture until just now. It is HYSTERICAL! I'm glad I tried the recipe before checking out the photo! :-) MCW

We have been making our traditional family recipe for baccala every Christmas for 4 generations. It was difficult to get my father to eat a new version last year. This year! He actually called for the recipe! He says it is his new family tradition for baccala. Thank you so much! It's delicious. tradit

Too bad about the photo because this dish is great. Had Baccala salad, an italian Xmas eve tradition, for the first time a few years ago and it was wonderful. Always wondered what they did with those dried salted cod. I couldn't stop eating the baccala salad because after all those heavy holiday treats this one was light and delicious. Try it or buy it! Too good not to, never mind the photo, it doesn't look anything like the finished product.

Can't say that the photo entices me to procure the ingredients and create this. Come now. We have had better photos with our recipes.
