Very nice dish. I used chicken tenders and had no mushrooms or lemon. I made the receipt as directed. Everyone loved it. I had one head of brocalli and pealed the the outer skin off of each spear so everyone would like this veggie, and place the raw spears on top of the dish while simmering and they stimmed perfectly. It was my turn to make lunch for everyone at work. I had the chicken, brocali, snap peas, and onion to work with and the dish ended up to be a crowd pleaser. 10 forks!

This turned out to be fatty and glutenous. Wings are better griled when they render their fat. Otherwise it was very easy to make, but I wont be doing that again in a hurry.
