Very good. I added some halved black grapes to the salad.

HUGE hit - the hub asked if we could have it again. The only thing I did differently: I thought the dressing would overwhelm the salad, so I built the salad (toasted pita, herbs, chicken), and served it with couscous flavored with a little lemon zest and cumin and tossed with toasted pistachios and pine nuts, THEN drizzled the lot of it with the dressing. I think it would make the salad too soupy, otherwise. Serve with some yogurt and hummus on the side and you have a fantastic meal!!

Very nice salad. It's an absolute must to toast the pita in advance. I had some salad left over and had it the next day...my toasted pita had turned a little soggy and it wasn't nearly as good as the day before. I used cilantro and mint and did not use parsley.

Great! Skipped the mint (not a fan) and used more cilantro (definitely a fan) and Italian parsley. Served it for lunch in lettuce cups, delicious.

My husband and I really enjoyed the salad (which we a lot of during the summer months). My tomatoes weren't quite ripe enough and I found the salad to be a little dry. Next time I will make sure that the tomatoes are fresh from the farm and juicy.

This is a good recipe for a hot summer day. I liked it, especially the way the chicken came out: had the left-overs in a pita bread the next day for luncvh, which was good!

You might like this recipe better with the addition of some crumbled feta, kalamata olives and red onions. That's the way my favorite restaurant makes it. I have not made this yet, but will try it tonight.

Previous poster is right: this is basically a recipe for fattoush with chicken. Toasting the pita is a must. We must have over-anticipated this one - we used good ingredients, but the flavors just didn't explode the way we thought they would. It wasn't bad, but I probably won't make it again using this recipe.

My Lebanese grandparents taught me to lightly toast the pita bread before adding it to salad (fattoush). If you add toasted pita just before serving, it will absorb less liquid and remain crispier. On another note, if fresh garlic 'repeats' on you, garlic powder is a milder substitute.

Very yummy!!! Did not use pita, though to keep it low carb.

This is one of my favorite salads, but to give credit where credit is due this is the Lebanese Fatoush salad with chicken! This is definitely not new......

I made this for dinner and a movie night for the family. Everyone really enjoyed it. My husband is not a huge fan of cumin, so he was a little skeptical, but when the whole dish came together all of the flavors melded nicely without any one flavor dominating. I used halved grape tomatoes which provided a fresh flavor and presentation.

Absolutely delicious. Not hard to make, and fairly fast, as you make the salad while you bake the chicken, which has marinaded 24 hours. Because it is February, I did not want to use hothouse tomatoes, so used a can of drained diced tomatoes
