Amazing recipe! I agree with everyone, no need to remove shallots...but might next time to give it a more refined presentation. Will make again, but when I can splurge on the butter. Make sure your BB doesn't get too hot, mine separated. Love love love!

Made this as an appetizer and it was delicious. At first when I tasted the sauce it was quite tangy but paired with the scallops and herbs it was a great combination. Will make this again.

This is wonderful and I will be making it again! Like the others who commented, i too left the shallots, ginger in the beurre blanc it only adds to it. I also let the shallots practically caramelize before finishing the beurre blanc!

Made this as a side dish with almond crusted salmon, wild brown rice and fresh string beans from our garden. Absolutely delicious. Swirling a little brown rice in the BB was awesome. The flavors really complimented each other. Enjoyed with a bottle of French Burgundy.

Made this tonight with my boyfriend, we divided the prep and prepared the dish and it took about 20 min. Served with some steamed rice, and sauteed garden greens (kale, chard, spinach) with garlie. What an amazing dinner!! The gremolata is sensational and don't waste any time or flavor by straining the sauce. Can't wait to make it for friends, an impressive dish all around.

Great recipe. Agree with the reviewer who left the shallots in the sauce. It does not need straining. Would make this more often if it wasn't for the large amount of butter - the butter is really needed in the sauce.

I've made this 4 times now and love it each time. I don't remove the shallots from the beurre blanc I think it gives it more flavor. This is my favorite appetizer for a dinner party.

Absolutely perfect recipe for scallops. The gremolata adds a wonderful dash of lime and cilantro with the garlic "underneath" and very mild (I used elephant garlic for the milder taste). The beurre blanc just perfect and pulls it all together. My husband went nuts and wants me to share this recipe with our sister-in-law, who owns a gourmet restaurant! Definitely making this again, and again!

I made this for my girlfriend one night and she said it was one of the top 3 meals I've ever made for her and I cook for her all the time. The gremolata added just the right amount of flavor. I served it with bacon wrapped asparagus which worked really well with all of the other flavors.

Rating: 4
Wow. This was great. I hardly ever give 4 forks & in truth the way I made it was 3 but I goofed a couple of big goofs and I could tell if I did everything right it easily would have been four. First I realized that my fresh ginger was past it, so had to punt & use the stuff in the tube. It's good but not nearly as pungent so I missed some of the ginger kick. I also made but then FORGOT the gremolata - duh!!! The BB was fabulous!!! TRICK for getting sauce not to break. After reducing, add a scant 1/4 tsp mayo. There is just enough lecithin in the mayo to keep the water and fat soluble components together. I even thinned the sauce with some wine - an invitation for breakage if there ever was one and it did fine. I'll be making this over and over.

absolutely loved this! so tasty. felt like we were at a 4 star restaurant in our own kitchen!

Made it on a weekday (following directions exactly except I didn't strain the beurre blanc). It was absolutely delicious. Only things I would do differently next time -- squeeze all of the liquid out of the scallops and have the pan at a higher heat initially to get better browning. Served it with steamed jasmine rice and grilled asparagus (sprinkled with evoo and sea salt). Light yet rich. Hubs loved it.

If you want to impress friends and family, this is the dish to make. I am still having an issue with a side starch, but the effort and time put into this easy recipe will have everyone talking about the great cook/chef that you are! I have made it twice and both times it came out fantastic. Just the name alone is enough to impress. I am now single and when I have lady friends over that I want to impress, this is my "go-to" entree. Easy to prep, and very easy to put together. And fun to let the lady help with little things like the lime zest, etc. Make sure you get fresh scallops and not the little ones either. Good luck and bon appetite.. !

I guess I am the contrarian here. I thought the scallops were very good (2 and one half forks) but did not merit 3 or 4 forks. Made it exactly as stated. I think the gremolata added a lot of flavor.

Had a bag of nice jumbo frozen scallops and needed a good recipe that would work with a few things in my fridge. Amazingly I had fresh ginger, cilantro and lime. Had to use onion instead of shallot. My husband and I loved the dish regardless. Don't usually use that much butter, but so delicious and quite simple. I had too much liquid in the scallops when pan frying; had to increase the heat. I will grill next time.

This was an outstanding dish even with substitutions of onion & orange. It is particularly delicious with very fresh scallops.

Rating: 2
Okay I only gave this recipe two forks because it was good but I didn't feel that it was exceptional. My boyfriend wasn't too impressed either. I followed it exactly, used good white wine, amazing fresh scallops so I was just really surprised that it wasn't particularly special in the end. I had read reviews about it being too limey, so at first I used only two tablespoons but then decided to add the third after tasting the sauce. If I was going to change anything I would use less ginger, it was too strong for my taste. But even then, I just don't feel that it popped. It needed something, or maybe a couple somethings.

Rating: 3
This is very good. A couple of tips for the beurre blanc, though, which broke the first time we tried it-- if you chop the ginger instead of grating it, it will be less likely to scorch & less overpowering (comes out when you sieve it anyway); you can increase the butter by at least 75% if the sauce is too tart (or just use 2 Tb juice); most importantly, only use as much heat as is needed to melt the butter (i.e., in most cases none at all)! It's excellent & elegant when it works, though we prefer it with lemon instead of lime.

Rating: 0
Too tart! Perhaps cut down on the lime juice. Also should use higher temp than moderate heat for searing scallops. I use moderate heat and instead of the scallops getting seared, a pool of liquid appears. As a result this dish was not very good. Don't know if I would make again.

Ginger completely overpowered the flavor of the scallops. Our family didn't like it. Didn't have time for the gremolata.

My family and I thought this was very good. I followed the sugjestion of others, and cut down on the lime juice, just a bit. Also, I did not strain the mixture, but for guests, I probably would have.

Rating: 4
FanTASTIC! My boyfriend and I pretty novice cooks, and this was totally doable and tasted gourmet. We didn't have shallots, so we used the white part of scallions, and I accidentally put in too much white wine, but still tasted great. I also find grating ginger very tedious, so used an "easy squeeze" refrigerated kind we have. Served with cooked asparagus, which was also really nice with the sauce. Add some vodka tonics with lime and you've got an amazing summer dinner!

Rating: 3
I thought the taste was a little flat and needed some spicing up. I added a minced serano chili to the beurre blanc; after sauteing the scallops I then added some white wine to the pan and added that to the beurre blanc before serving. I served the scallops with orzo to which I mixed in the gremolata with some olove oil.

Another keeper. This recipe is fail-safe, I made it for my husband for Valentine's dinner, light and lively and I've made it several times since. Agree with others, the first couple of times I did strain the beurre blanc but it really isn't essential. You should definitely use fresh ginger though, I don't think you can expect the same results with powdered. Will continue to make it again and again. Serve with some fresh asparagus or if you're lucky and the season is right, some just picked fiddleheads and good french bread - exquisite. Accompanied of course by a nice crisp white - Sauvignon Blanc or perhaps a good Reisling?

Would either go light on the beurre blanc or tweak it a bit. It is very tart. Would most likely cut the lime juice back to 2T. You don't really get any sense of the ginger or shallots this way. Still, tasty, and pretty easy. Would impress company

i've executed a lot of amazing recipes from epicurious, but this one tops them all. it's the first simple dish that i feel rivals nyc fine dining. it's also really fun to plate. the beurre blanc looks far more elegant than the darker reductions. try this recipe. it's surprisingly easy. just make the gremolata while the sauce is reducing. btw, i find that the sauce is enough for 8-10 large sea scallops, not 24.

This is the best scallop recipe on the planet! And get over the butter. Each serving has a small amount, drizzle it. My brother from VA, a passionate love of seafood, came to FL to do some work on my house one weekend. I made it for him the first night. The next night, I asked what he wanted for dinner. He said, "Just make those scallops you made last night..." A very high review indeed!

This is a fantatic dish. Easy to prepare and very impressive. The flavors go together perfectly. I love gremolata, and this version with cilantro is a real winner. After searing the scallops I deglazed the pan with a little white wine and wilted some baby spinach. Served the scallops atop the spinach. Be sure to have crusty for this delightful sauce.

Given all the 4-fork reviews and the fact that I love scallops, I was really disappointed by this recipe. I like the ginger/lime/cilantro flavor, but just couldn't get past the fact that it ended up having way way way too much butter. Next time I'll try to come up w/ a lighter, less beurre-y blanc.

Rating: 4
I gotta agree with Heidi, in that I would cut back on the lime in the Beurre Blanc Sauce,which, by the way, dont let all that butter scare you. You can just drizzle it around your dish, its very light and fresh- tasting. But overall,this dish was fabulous, so elegant, and tasty. I served it with cous cous. Definitely would make again. I loved it.

The beurre blanc was a tad too limey and overpowered the ginger. Next time I would cut the limey a little to get a better balance of flavors. But over all was a good dish. The sweetness of the scallops paired well with the lime, just needs a little tweaking.

I tried this recipe, but used Rose wine instead of white, creating a wonderfully rich pink sauce.

This was so easy and I really loved the ginger lime beurre! The gremolata can be a bit overpowering if used with a heavy hand, especially if one is neutral fan of cilantro. I would probably dust the scallops with flour prior to the saute, to give them a crispy brown look.

Very good, very easy & reasonably quick. Love the kick the cilantro offers. Go lightly on the gremolata, however, as it's easy to overpower the delicate flavor of the scallops.

I don't usually like scallops, but my sister likes them, so I tried this recipe at her house and WOW, it was great. I was actually licking the sauce off the plate. I'll try this dish on my husband next. Hope he likes it, otherwise I will be visiting my sister more often.

Extraordinarily easy and perfectly fantastic! I can not praise this recipe enough!!!! The beurre blanc sauce is to die for! I made the recipe exactly as stated except I substituted a Meyer lemon (which grow in my garden) for the lime peel. I did use lime concentrate which I always have on hand. I served it with stiffly mashed garlic potatoes because I didn't have time to cook rice. I also used previously frozen eastern scallops (the big kind) because we get those at our Costco. This is the best scallop recipe I have ever made and I cook them often when visiting the east coast! Presentation is first class all the way. An absolute five star stunner! Note: If you are new to cooking scallops...you must dry all the moisture out of the scallops before you season and cook them or they will not saute properly.

This was nothing short of AMAZING. I don't usually rate recipes, however this one is so good I felt compelled to say so. It absolutely melts in your mouth. Wonderfully flavorful, quick and easy to make, and a nice presentation as well. I followed the recipe except that at the end, I actully poured the sauce and the gremolata over the scallops while they were still in the pan and stirred just to coat the scallops while the pan was still hot. This recipe has shot straight to the top of my seafood collection, and it will be hard to get me to make scallops any other way for a long time to come. Please try this fabulous recipe!

Very, very good and easy. I strayed from the recipe pretty significantly and it still turned out great (too lazy to run to the store for missing ingredients). I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground ginger at 1/2 the recommended amount. I didn't have white wine so I used white wine vinegar and water (I wouldn't use the vinegar the next time -- either get the wine or just use water). I didn't strain the sauce either -- I don't mind chunks of shallot. Scallops and lots of butter -- how can you go wrong?

To get that nice brown frond on your scallops, do NOT use a non-stick pan. Also, don't move the scallops once they're in the pan. This dish was excellent for something so quick. I wasn't especially impressed with the gremolata and might add a few capers in with the mix. Beurre Blanc is impossible to screw up if you keep the heat low enough.

Rating: 3
Wow! This was great - though I cheated to make it easier for a big self-serve luncheon. Instead of making the gremolata separately, I added the zest and cilantro after straining the sauce, and omitted the garlic. I also substituted onion for the shallots by caramelizing them in a tiny bit of olive oil, THEN adding the rest. All worked well for the purpose of quintupling the recipe's yield and still making it appealing to the eye.

Rating: 3
if you're a dumper like me, even a good one, don't do it for this one. you need to measure to make sure it comes out correctly. i put in too much lime and it was a bit tart but the combo of sauce, scallops and gremolata was a great one that i'll make again.

This is a very good dish with unique flavor. I served it on a bed of caramelized onions and leeks, which was a nice complement. My only suggestion is to make a larger amount of the sauce by either reducing the mixture less or adding more liquid.

HOLY COW!!! Wow. Incredible. I love cilantro so I doubled the gremolata, but went easy on the lime zest. I accidentally strained the ginger/lime juice before adding butter but it didn't seem to matter. This is one of those dishes that required "hands-on" time, a little bit of timing, and should be served immediately, but that little bit of extra effort is indeed worth it.

To the reviewers who commented about cilantro tasting "soapy:" apparently some people are "genetically" predisposed to perceiving the flavor of cilantro as "soapy," and others are not. If you are one of these people, I am guessing that no recipe with cilantro in it is going to be appealing.

This was a fantastic dish. I think it is one of the best buerre blancs I've ever had, and very easy, too. I thought it was wonderfully rich and sweet, with the tang of the lime juice and ginger balancing perfectly.

Be sure to pat the scallops dry and turn the heat up high enough so they carmelize quickly and don't get over-cooked. And definitely, try it!

This recipe was a lot of work, and the ingredients were expensive. Moreover, it was very rich with all that butter. Yuck. I think I added just a little bit too much lime, too. This was disappointing. Demanding girlfriend didn't like it, either. I won't make it again.

Made this last night as a main course. I had scallops and shrimp leftover from another night, so I used both. The buerre blanc is delicious and the aroma intoxicating. I served it over linguini. This is a twice-a-year kind of meal at our house (ver rich) but definitely worth trying.

A definite 4-forker. Raves. Fairly easy to prepare. The different elements really just come together perfectly. It looks beautiful on the plate too. Don't skip the gremolata.

Not only fantastic, but ridiculously easy to prepare.

Very impressive. The lime and ginger flavor was amazing. I thought that the amount of butter would overpower the other flavors or be too heavy but it wasn't at all.

This was great. Visions of the Cayman Islands. Do read all the suggestions that the reviewers have left. This is how we improvised: for the wine, used water, vodka, and chicken buillion (we were already drinking a merlot and didn't want to open a white), used onion for the shallots, only 1/2 stick of the butter, and believe it or not used fresh chopped/minced spinach for the cilantro. Served it on top of angel hair pasta. Used one pound of scallops and this served the two of us. Better than in 4 star restaurant.

My son requested scallops for dinner, even though I am not a fan. Unbelievably I had all the ingredients on hand,(execept the scallops) and was amazed at how well this turned out. I will certainly make this one again.

This recipe should be illegal--addiction is guaranteed. We ran around last night trying to find roommates to share them with, because we felt unworthy hogging them all to ourselves!!! The beurre blanc and gremolata are amazing. Don't forget to preseason the scallops with salt/white pepper, and be sure and season the beurre blanc to mellow out the citrus. A surefire eyebrow-lifter.

This recipie is going in my file at home. Simple and delicious as is (although I didn't have any white wine - and it was Sunday - so I used vermouth in the beurre blanc). Has great color to it as well - perfect for summer.

I'm from Seattle and have recently moved to San Antonio. Tonight I cooked this favorite recipe for 6 of my new Southern Belle friends and one first timer of scallops has been quoted as saying, "Not only have I had scallops, I LOVE scallops!!! Y'all gotta try this!"

Had to substitute onions for shallots and ground ginger for fresh....was still fabulous. Everyone asked for seconds and the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

This is by far one of the best scallop recipies ever. I made it with the Orzo and green onion pilaf on the site and it was a major hit. The flavors in the sauce create a symphony for the taste buds.

This was a fantastic recipe. Followed just as written (and made as main course), except we placed thinly sliced cucumbers under the scallops. It was the best scallop dish thus far. This recipe would be perfect as an appetizer.

I made this at a dinner part last night for family and it was a hit! I loved it and my mom and sister who aren't really fond of scallops came back for more. The flavor is awesome. It's definetly a keeper.

Simple and delicious! Keep in mind that the beurre blanc needs to stay slightly warm until serving time--it will separate if it cools and is reheated. I served this with another recipe on this site, the asparagus with parmesan butter.

Yummers! I made twice the sauce and served it with crunchy french bread - I definitely recommend! If you love cilantro and lime and ginger - oh ya baby - this is for you!

This is great. I am an absolute beginner and if I can make it anyone can. Excellent!

This is a keeper. I'm an experienced cook (chef?) and followed this recipe exactly. It's easy to prepare, is "elegant", and is very, very good. I've served it three times to friends in the last two weeks. I used frozen sea scallops from Costco. I serve it with plain basmati rice and steamed sugar snap peas. Note to cook(s) who said the beurre blanc separated ... the key is to use a very, very, very low heat.

Excellent scallop recipe. It was so easy to make and had the perfect balance of flavors. I love the gremolata, the raw garlic gave a nutty flavor. I used Trader Joe's frozen scallops and they were delicious. Will make this again and again.

Rating: 4
This recipe was not only quick and easy, the flavor was very well balanced. It's so easy to overpower scallops, and the beurre blanc and gremolata perfectly complimented the scallops' flavor. I'm tempted to add the gremolata to the sauce right before serving, but it was nice to have those solid little hits of flavor under the creamy sauce. I will definitely cook this dish for our next dinner guests!

This was so quick to make and delicious. I served as an appetizer on small plates and everyone wished they had more.

While making this dish, I was tasting the beurre blanc and thinking the dish was going to overpowered by lime and otherwise rather dull. I was pleasantly SURPRISED when I sat down and added the gremolata!!!! I doubled the sauce and strained the solids. Served over fresh linguine and thoroughly enjoyed the dish as did the rest of the family. Next time I think I will add the gremolata to the pasta and thoroughly mix before serving with scallops and beurre blanc.

Very Good!!! Hubby bragged it up to his mom - Always a plus!!! I will make this again, probably for his parents!

No wonder there are so many reviews of this dish. I prepared it using small, sweet Nantucket Bay scallops that have been in season recently. I vote for straining the solids from the beurre blanc because it makes the sauce silky smooth. Pressing on the solids as you strain the sauce into a bowl extracts maximum flavor. I used zest and juice from key limes, which gave a nice sweet taste to the sauce. I served the scallops alongside basmati rice, microwaved, into which I stirred sauteed onions (about 1/2 cup onions to one cup uncooked rice) and a generous handful of chopped cilantro. Drank a Graves from Bordeaux that nicely complimented the dish. Fabulous and easy.

Made this for a romantic valentines dinner with my hubby. He was luke warm on the idea of scallops, but made a believer out of him with this one. It is amazing! I highly recommend it, you can't go wrong, and it was fairly simple. I'll be making this again.

I made this for Valentine's Day. It was so YUMMY! I will make it again, next time I'll add the Cilantro gremolata to the sauce right before I serve it. I shortened the cooking time for scallops-Don't over cook your scallops. Take your time with the sauce it and it will turn out perfectly-it's worth it. I made this because of a similar dish we love at Bahama Breeze my boyfriend liked mine better. Try this!!!!

This was delish! I've also made it with Halibut Cheeks, and it was just as tasty. Only thing I would change is less lime juice in the sauce. I love lime, however, the amount called for can overpower the beurre blanc until almost acidic.

This was a great dish, easy but elegant. I left some of the solids from the sauce in and that greatly improved it.

I am a scallop lover and was in heaven when I was able to purchase some day boat scallops. I have made this recipe four times now and still think it is the best! My guests have all asked for the recipe.

Wonderful! It also lends itself towards a beautiful presentation. I made this for a special date night. My only problem was separation of the buerre blanc.

Awesome. I didn't have fresh lime zest, so substituted lemon zest. I did use lime juice concentrate in the beurre blank, however. The lemon and butter made that first bite reminiscent of broiled lobster. I simply served with a large salad for a quick and easy dinner. Nice! I will make this dish many, many more times.

YUM YUM! Big hit, and VERY easy. Also, good on salmon. Served with wasabi mashed potatoes. Great easy meal for entertaining, You aren't stuck in the kitchen all night!

I made this while in Maine and impressed everyone at the table. I was pretty pleased with the results, but not blown away. Instead of sauteing them on stovetop (electric-grrr), I threw the scallops in the broiler for a few minutes and then served them with the gremolata and beurre blanc. I think I increased the garlic. I thikn the recipe could use some tinkering. But still a worthy dish for the effort and when you have fresh seafood available.

This was an exceptional dish. We absolutely loved it and will definately cook it again. Thought the raw garlic might be overpowering but in the gremolata it was perfect. A definate "must try"!

I'm not even a seafood lover, but this was a great dish. I had doubts while I was cooking the scallops, but once everything was put together I was happily suprised at how tasty it was.

This was a great recipe. We found that using a non-stick skillet, that the scallops did not brown the way the picture has you think. It was very good. This is a keeper.

Quick and easy yet with smashing results! I get raves from guests everytime. Variation - try replacing the coriander (that's English for cilantro...) with fresh taragon. I also added fresh taragon in the beurre blanc. I served with rice flavoured with whole cardamom.

Good,but an awful lot of calories for a fairly mild flavored sauce (as are most buerre blank sauces)

This is a truly awesome recipe. I have made it twice now...first just for my wife...then because we loved it so much, made it for a large gathering on Mother's Day. I am making it again tonight for my wife because sea scallops were on special at the store. The combination of flavors are delecate and truly gourmet in every way...plus it is so darn easy to prepare. I will make this again and again.

I really liked this recipe... such an interesting combination of flavors. I wish you could taste the ginger a bit more and the garlic a bit less, however.. I wonder if it would be better not to discard the solids from the buerre blanc.

Absolutely delicious, and so easy! My husband, not usually a scallops fan, raved for days. Two variations to suggest: we made this one time with brandy instead of white wine and it was wonderful; it also worked well with salmon.

Wonderful recipe! Quick, easy, and to die for! sauce goes great with scallops and the gremolata adds a special something. I have a similar recipe for a buerre blanc that you serve with salmon, only using red wine instead.

Sauce and Gremolata are very subtle and enhance the wonderful scallop flavor. Very easy. I made the gremolata ahead and kept in a plastic bag.

Just don't think about how awful this must be for you and enjoy it. This was one of the finest dishes I've made in years and I'd make it for company in an instant. It's easy and tastes like a million bucks. I went heavy on the topping and loved it.

Made this again but skipped the buerre blanc. It was great with the cilantro gremolata alone. Make sure you chop the cilantro, lime, and garlic very fine.

This recipe is excellent. We made it on a Wednesday night, and it felt like we had eaten out at a fancy restraunt on a Saturday night, except in the comfort of our own home. I certainly agree that this is a dish that we would serve at a formal dinner party. A good compliment to this dish is romaine salad with Italian dressing. Very good together.

I was out of ginger, but even so this dish was fabulous, served with roasted asparagus. My husband raved for days. I can't wait to try it with the ginger.

I am always looking for an interesting way to prepare scallops and this recipe was excellent. It was simple to prepare but truly an elegant gourmet dish. A must dish to serve guests.

This is one of those recipes that requires only modest effort but tastes like you have spent a great deal of time to make it. I made the butter sauce just before cocktails started. I took it off the heat and just let it sit until I was ready to spoon it over the scallops and serve -- so besides being easy to make, it also is one that lets you be with your guests until it comes time to saute the scallops.
