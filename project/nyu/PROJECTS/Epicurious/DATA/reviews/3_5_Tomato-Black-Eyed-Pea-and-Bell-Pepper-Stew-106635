My husband and I really liked this. I would skip the vegetable broth because that just waters everything down. I used a can of black-eyed peas and only 1-2 teaspoons of chili powder. It's simple - I wouldn't serve it to guests. But if you need something quick but tasty, this is it!

Finally a black-eyed pea recipe the whole family likes! I subed a can of rotel for one of the cans of tomatoes and used frozen tomatoes picked from our garden last summer for the other.

I read what other reviewers said and made sure to start with delicious homemade stock, based on celery, which added a very nice base flavor. Then I added some chopped cilantro at the end and everyone loved it! I think it is a keeper.

Quite average. I could have made it up myself. Not a keeper.
