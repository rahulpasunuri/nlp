I didn't think this was all that great. Chocolatey, sure. But the texture was off-putting. Very grainy and toothsome, which is strange for a chocolate cake. I've made only 1 other torte (a hazelnut one), but I don't recall it being as gritty as this one. And this cake was described to have a souffle-like texture?!? In retrospect, I guess I should've pureed the nuts very very very finely. I won't be making this torte again.

this did not work out for me, and i am not a novice baker. the chocolate did not grind up as it probably should have in the cuisinart, and i was left with a burned cake with chunks of chocolate unevenly dispersed. i have an oven thermometer and took it out after 40 min. b/c it seemed overdone, and well, it was. i am willing to try it again, though i don't know why you can't just melt the chocolate and mix it into the yolks cooled. my poor cuisinart did NOT like grinding it up.

This was a fairly easy cake to make. I used bittersweet chocolate with good results. The texture of the cake is quite nice; it is not as dense and overwhelming as butter-based tortes. I was not so fond of the suggested coffee ice cream accompaniment. I served it with candied orange rind. I will try it with a drizzle of orange sauce next time. A keeper.

this cake was delicious and the presentation was "impressive" for the amount of work involved (which I thought was not a lot). I will definitely serve it again.

I first made this cake for a friend who can't have wheat, but now I make it just because it's delicious. It's intensely chocolate-y, yet has a light texture, unlike most fourless chocolate cakes where you have the impression you're sitting down to a plate of fudge. Don't worry if the mixture seems dry before you fold in the egg whites.

This is an absolutely fabulous dessert ... served at room temp or out of the refrigerator. I've served it to guests and given the cake to friends as gifts; without fail, I'm asked for the recipe. If you want to impress someone with your culinary skills, this is the dessert for you.

I made this for a dinner party and it worked out very well. I refrigerated the tort out of the oven and the cooling time was only about 1 hour. This had a very moist consistancy. This dish can be made ahead w/ ease.
