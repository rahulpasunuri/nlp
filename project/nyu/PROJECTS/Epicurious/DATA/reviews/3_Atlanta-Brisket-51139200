@pwall921: When the marinating time is done, you'll have somewhere near 4 cups of Coca-Cola marinade. (Not fit to imbibe at this point, so it's called a marinade in an attempt to prevent confusion). The gravy recipe only calls for 2 cups, so you'll discard the rest. I had to re-read it a couple of times to figure this out. As a southern boy who is minding his calories at the moment, this recipe brings mixed emotions, but it's pretty tasty. I'd proudly serve it to other southerners and open-minded northerners. Epicurious, thank you for understanding that many of us cooks still appreciate recipes filled with flavor in spite of the fact that we may be best suited by minimizing our portions or skipping it altogether!

Confused here: 1: Pour Coca-Cola evenly over brisket...turning brisket once or twice in Coca-Cola marinade....Lift brisket from roaster....Line sieve...filter....Pour in Coca-Cola marinade and let drip through.....then...For Gravy: Combine 2 cups filtered Coca-Cola marinade, soup mix, tomato sauce, and ketchup and pour over brisket....roast in oven.....when done.. Discard bay leaves and remaining Coca-Cola marinade...Overlap brisket slices on large platter and smother with pan gravy and onions... If I am discarding the Coca Cola marinade, how am I "smothering it with pan gravy?" Doesn't the pan gravy include the coca cola that was cooking with the brisket?

I made it and it was fabulous. I too try to eat healthy but the coke was for tenderizing the meat and when it was all done, it wasn't sugary at all. Will definitely be doing this again. BTW, how much sugar does BBQ sauce, or any other sauce you might add, have???

I am giving this review 4 forks to balance out the completely unjust ratings by people who didn't even make the recipe. It's at least 3-3.5 forks at any rate and delicious! Why is someone who's interested in a low fat, low sugar dish looking at a brisket recipe in the first place? I'm sure that at least one purpose for the Coke is to tenderize the meat. Without the sugar in the Coke, sugar of some sort would be needed, and many brisket recipes do call for brown sugar. As all true epicureans know, just because the recipe is simple, doesn't mean it can't be good. I doubt we'd have seen those complaints if the recipe had called for bourbon. Next time I make it I may try subbing BBQ sauce for the ketchup. Also, my daughter suggested adding carrots and small potatoes. Was a great comfort dish on a cold winter's day.

In order to review a recipe, you must have made it, surely? I shudder at the sanctimony I read in most of these reviews. As an Atlantan, who has made this recipe, I can tell you it is a delicious version of a Southern classic.

In fairness: in Sicily, where the food is generally fabulous, there is a two liter bottle of Coke next to the wine bottle on every table, and I bought a Coca Cola cookbook in Italian. So I'm trying to get up my courage to try this.... The Sicilians would probably add a few anchovies.

i too shudder every time i see a recipe that contains the yucky "cream of something soup." and epicurious is usually above that. but, this is a fun dish from the south and after living there briefly, i became aware of how Atlantans revere their "co-cola," as they call it. and PLEASE no reviews unless you've made it. write to the editor if you have a complaint.

I too was shocked to read how much sugary coca cola the recipe calls for -- I wonder how much sugar is in the finished dish/what the nutritional facts are? The recipe is "Atlanta Brisquet," so none of us should be too shocked at coke being a main ingredient. I think Jukesgrrl's PIttsburgh brisquet sounds healthier. Heinz makes chili sauce too, I think. Epicurious: many of us want to cook with less sugar, less fat, less salt --

Actually, I give it 0 forks. I gagged when I read the recipe!! I wouldn't even cook this!!

Go to a Mexican market and get the Coke from there as the Mexican Coke uses sugar instead of corn syrup.

Coke and dry onion soup mix from Epicurious? What's next, cream of mushroom soup and cheeze-wiz? If I want that sort of recipe I go to Taste of Home or Sandra Lee. Please Epicurious, don't turn semi-homemade.

This is disgusting. I am shocked to find it in Epicurious's web site.

for a more flavorful dish use a bottle of (Heinz) chili sauce or cocktail sauce instead of tomato sauce and catsup.

This recipe is the same method as how I was taught to cook brisket in my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA. That recipe is simply to brown a seasoned brisket then cover it with one bottle of Heinz ketchup and one can of Iron City beer (note the equally city-centric ingredients), cooking and serving exactly as described here, sans the onion gravy. The sublimely tender Pittsburgh Brisket needs no improvement (unless you are Hungarian, as I am, in which case you can add paprika), although the creamy coleslaw suggested by Ms. Anderson is a great accompaniment. (My Pittsburgh coleslaw is made with Marzetti Slaw Dressing, another Three Rivers favorite for Steelers game day that has no peer on supermarket shelves.) To Ms. Anderson, I award a traditional Pittsburgh compliment, "Very tasty, 'n 'at."
