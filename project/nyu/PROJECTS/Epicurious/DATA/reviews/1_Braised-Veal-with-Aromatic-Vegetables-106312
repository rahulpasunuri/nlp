Relatively simple to make - but it just doesn't make the mark on any level. First of all, it's an ugly dish, bland in colour. Second, when you stew baby carrots for 20 minutes - they disintegrate. Lastly, the directions are not clear how thick to make the stew. Mine wasn't very thick, but I never was very good at thickening anyway. The lemon flavour helps.
