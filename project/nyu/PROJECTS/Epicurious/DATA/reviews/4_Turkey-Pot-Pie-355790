This recipe was extremely good for using up our turkey leftovers. I used McCormick's turkey gravy mix, and our leftover carrots and sweet potatoes from Christmas dinner. The sweet potatoes really added an interesting note to the pie - almost a lingering sweetness. We all loved it. My one piece of feedback is that this pot pie does not have as must crust as others, and would best be served with a side or salad to make a truly filling meal. As such, I had about 2.5 servings to fill up.

I sauteed onion and celery, then added the mushrooms as directed. I put the carrots in a saucepan with about 1 cup of water, and let them simmer uncovered until the water evaporated and the carrots were tender. I added the sauteed vegetables to the carrots, added about 2 cups of diced turkey left overs, dried thyme and parsley (no fresh herbs on hand), then added about 3 cups of homemade cognac giblet gravy (from an earlier Bon Appetit recipe. I thinned the gravy a bit with left over giblet broth from the same recipe. We made 6 small pot pies - baked as directed at 400 for 30 minutes. They were perfect!

Not a good recipe IMHO. Too many assumptions may cause a very runny pot pie filling. Not all gravy is the same and we used the recommended amount but it was too loose. Diced potato could haver helped to thicken this, as well as some heavy cream. I used Trader Joe's puff pastry for the crust instead of pie crust from a box that likely contains hideous trans fats (e.g., PIllsbury) Would make again but only with modifications that make sense.

Great solution to turkey leftovers. Used roasted root vegetables, store bought gravy. Did the double pie, pre cooked the bottom crust and brushed with both with egg whites. Turned out great!

We really liked this. I made biscuits instead of a pie crust for the top and added extra mushrooms since I had them on hand. Using leftover gravy made it so tastey.

This is an excellent turkey pie. I always make 3 or more and freeze the others, without the pie crust when freezing.Well worth the effort!

This was deelish! I stuck to the recipe and felt like my homemade turkey gravy and a bottom and top crust made all the difference. I'd like to try this with homemade pie crust.

Very yummy, kids (12 & 14) loved it. They complained: not enough for seconds and not enough crust. 9 inch inch pie dish fed 1 adult and two teenagers- no leftovers. I used fresh celery (added with mushrooms) and left out the peas.

Excellent recipe, and better the next day! I doubled the mushrooms, and split the carrots into longitudinal quarters, then chopped them into small pieces(like the look better and they have more mouth feel). I used ground dark meat turkey, which I lightly cooked with the mushrooms and carrots, after they were done, then it set aside. I then added the frozen peas to the cooling filling, mixing them in well. I made the gravy using skinned chicken necks, onions, thyme, and a bit of salt, simmered for 20', then whisked in the flour. Once made, I added the filling back to the pan, and simmered for several minutes, adding a bit of flour to thicken as needed. I used a whole wheat crust...definitely brush with egg white. Note: I did not drain the juices from the sauteing; there wasn't that much fat as the turkey was skinned before grinding. Deelicious!

Much easier than this review will make it sound. Basically, the veggies are all about personal taste. Added more veggies: green garlic, celery, zucchini, broccoli. Cooked veggies in different order, starting w/ garlic, broccoli, carrots. Instead of chopped onions, used some pearl onions I discovered in the freezer when digging for peas. Added both to the veggies with the cooked chicken towards the end, just enough to defrost/warm. Used a bisquick dough (full biscuit recipe) for the top; rolled about 1/2" thick, then baked for about 20 minutes. Didn't chill, but would next time so the dough has time to cook through w/out overcooking the veggies. Forgot the cranberry sauce, which was fine, but it would be good. Didn't have any gravy, so made w/ a basic roux recipe, doubled since there were extra veggies (2T butter; 2T flour; 2c chicken or veggie broth). Managed to cook w/ only two pots! Used a big Pyrex (visionware) pot for making the gravy and a large skillet for the veggies. Poured the gravy over the cooked veggies, then put the mix back into the Pyrex, covered w/ the dough, and then into the oven.

I'm not going to rate this because I used the recipe as a guide for making a beef pot pie with leftover pot roast, but wanted to share that method. I strained the braising liquid, chilled overnight, and removed the fat. Then used that in place of the gravy, and reduced. With new veggies and chopped up leftover meat, this was a fantastic way to re-purpose a large roast. I also used a bottom crust; pre-baked the bottom and added the filling. This recipe has enough solid filling elements that if you reduce the liquid enough, it won't spill out all over the place, and you really can just cut it into pieces like a pie (carefully).

I must say I was skeptical when I looked at the ingredients. I was wrong, it was great, really easy and really great!

OMG, the photo does look sinister! How funny! Like those Halloween pics of pumpkins carved into doing horrible things. I am looking forward to trying this recipe tomorrow night, but with a happier expression!

SO SO good! Using chicken instead works wonderful as well. This is a new staple in our household!

Did a trial run by purchasing a bone-in split turkey breast....added a potato to this mix. Also baked it in an All Clad large skillet...and the ready bought pillsbury pie crust worked perfectly, pressing it up the sides of the skillet...Outstanding. Loved it. Now I won't be afraid to risk my coveted Thanksgiving leftovers to this recipe. It is a keeper and I will make it as I did tonight many more times.

Excellent! Made crusts for top & bottom. For gravy,used chicken broth with cornstarch. Great way to use up leftover Thanksgiving food!

haven't tried the recipe yet, but that is the most sinister image of a pot pie I've ever seen. In terms of fine art photography, its pretty great, intentional or not.

Amazing way to use up leftovers. Will definitely make it again. I made it with purple carrots, which turned the whole think a little violet, but didn't affect the taste.

The insides were great but give yourself a break and roll the crust upward around the edge of the pie. It makes it nearly impossible to clean the plate afterward and leaves a nice crusty rim of pie on the underside of the rim that goes to waste. I thought I read it wrong while making it...otherwise tasty.

Excellent...I used a top crust and bottom one as well. Baked it in a deep frying pan since I had a lot more tukey and filling than required. Everyone loved it. Will be sure to make it again when I have leftovers.

I made this turkey pot pie last night and it was absolutely delicious, my family loved it. I did not refrigerate the filling in the pie crust for 30 minutes as the recipe called for, and the meal was completed sooner and still excellent. Cranberry sauce is the added delight.

this is so delicious! we had this for dinner last night (i wanted to use up some leftover turkey from christmas) and everyone loved it- my husband and i wished they'd loved it less so that we would now have leftovers! very easy. i used a store bought frozen crust for the top, made up some gravy with what i had in the house- chicken stock, flour and butter, and added roasted potatoes. yum!!!

Delicious-- I added dill and omitted the mushrooms. I also use a mediterranean crust- 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup butter (melted), 1/2 cup warm water, 1 tsp salt, 3 cups of flour. Place in the food processor and then throw it on a floured surface. Makes a double crust-- it's for empanadas but I always use it for my pot pies!

This is easy and delicious!! A great way to use up leftover veggies and gravy. It was super with this biscuit recipe on top http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,164,146181-240202,00.html I'll be making this again!

So good, my boyfriend quickly asked for seconds and told me I should definitely make this again. Was able to use up turkey and gravy left over from Thanksgiving dinner that I simply defrosted first. I added a generous amount of "leftover" veggies (broccoli), so I found I needed about twice the amount of gravy. Also used a sheet of puff pastry for the topping, for an extra crispy crust.

Followed this one to the letter except I had leftover smoked turkey from Thanksgiving. I was worried that it would be too strong for the recipe but I believe it actually lent something special to it. Easy and delicious. Would make again in a heartbeat.

Definitely would make again! I made individual turkey pot pies using ramekins with puff pastry just on top.

I wish I had turkey leftovers all year along, I'd be making this more often. I used whole wheat flour, and it was delicious!

I got two "OUTSTANDING"s after dinner tonight. Everyone had seconds and/or thirds. It's a keeper.

Awesome. The only change I made was to sautee the onions & mushrooms in white wine. Delicious. I did thicken up the gravy with some flour and it has a very good consistency. Used a Pillsbury rolled pie crust and it is great. The egg glaze looks good.
