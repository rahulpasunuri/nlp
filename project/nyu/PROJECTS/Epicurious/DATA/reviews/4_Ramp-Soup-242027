This soup is delicious and rather delicate considering how pungent ramps are. The only issue is that the recipe probably only makes about 3 generous servings (more if just an app). Like other reviewers, I didn't strain the soup.

What a wonderful soup! I used an immersion blender and blended very well and found that I could skip the part with the sieve. It was nice to save some time after the time-consuming process of cleaning the ramps. This recipe is worth all the effort. Very flavorful! And I didn't even add the butter!

When my family discovered that we had an abundance of wild leeks in the woods on our property, this was one of the first recipes I made. It's so delicate and delicious - and best served the same day for the amazing colour and taste. Every time ramps are in season, this is one of the first things to be made, we dream about it all year round!

Very good soup -- I made exactly as recipe instructs. Would double the recipe next time for 4 people. Also best to use a broth/stock with not a lot of flavor as it can overwhelm the ramps and onion.

Yes, it's a bit of work for soup for only four. However, it's worth it. The taste is excellent. I estimated the amount of cheese, but will definitely measure next time as it seemed to be a touch too much. Other than that, the flavor was excellent. (Should note that I used homemade vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.) It's an excellent way to use the ramps that are popping up now at farmer's markets! I'll definitely make again.

I'm not usually someone who wanders from the recipe too much so my apologies if this is too different from the recipe to review. I was craving a spring onion soup but couldn't seem to find a solid recipe so I used this as a marker. I used what I had on hand-- 1lb of spring onions (instead of ramps) and 1 shallot and 1/4 of a reg white onion (instead of the sweet onions). I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic to this mixture. I actually forgot the white pepper but I didn't miss it (tho will add next time). Used only 3 cups of chicken broth. It was perfect. Agree that I had more pulp from straining than I would have thought or liked but I would remake anyway. Very delicate but with a lot of flavor.

It was indeed a lot of work to clean/prep ramps. I used a submersible blender, which may not have blended as well as a regular blender. It left a lot of the ramp matter in the sieve, and it seemed like a got a very small amount of soup for all of the work! (I made my own broth too) But it is delicious. Next time I may throw in a few potatoes to give it a bit of body, and a spot of cream might not be so bad either.

Tried this recipe with leeks and added 1 medium potato to give the soup more structure. When pureed in a blender it was so smooth it didn't need to be pressed through a sieve. Served with fried wonton wrappers for contrast in texture and crunch. Will definitely serve this again!

There were beautiful ramps at the farmers' market yesterday, so I bought enough to make this soup as well as my pesto stand-by. The soup is lovely, though thinner than I expected. I have about three TBS of pureed solids remaining in my sieve. I am thinking of turning this into a spread for bruschetta. Does anyone have any other ideas? Thanks.

Ramps were not in season, so I substituted with regular leeks and a "bunch" of green onions. I only used half of the butter. The flavor of the soup was so delicate, that I served the parmesan cheese separately, and guests could sprinkle it on their soup as desired. This was so easy and so good that I made it two nights in a row! Definitely a keeper!

Cleaning ramps was a lot of work, but soup was delicious and elegant. Can't wait to make it again.
