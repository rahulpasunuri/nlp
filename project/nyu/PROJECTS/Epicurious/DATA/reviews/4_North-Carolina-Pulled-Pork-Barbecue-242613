Cooked on a Big Green Egg. This is a great recipe. If you are looking for a natural tasting pulled pork that is not over powered by BBQ sauce, this is it. I cooked 15lbs bone-in leaner cut and, at 180 degrees F, it took over 24 hrs. I used the set plate and a drip pan to catch juices. I did not incorporate the cracklings but did put a dry rub on prior to cooking. The rub enhanced the flavour of the juices for basting and I used some of this after pulling the pork. I would recommend also using rice wine vinegar to supplement some of the cider vinegar when you want liquid without making the pork to acidic. I would do this again and user a higher heat (like the recipe said)

So. Good. I could not help eating it while standing over the pot! I made the oven version, with a smaller 4.5 lb. shoulder with no skin, just a thick layer of fat. Other than that, I followed it to the letter. It cooked for about 5.5 hours, with the last 45 minutes uncovered, then sat overnight. I rewarmed it the next day and added in the reserved vinegar after pulling it. I want to eat this every day.

Holy moly this recipe is fantastic! This was my first attempt at slow roasting pork in the oven, and it was a tremendous success! The best part (aside from roasting for hours overnight, and waking up to a house that smelled unbelievable in the morning) was the fact that there wasn't anything that masked the flavour of the pork itself. Very simple ingredients really allow the full flavour to shine through. Preparation was a breeze, and continuous basting kept the meat super moist. Literally fell off of the bone when transferred out of the dutch oven and into the roasting pan to cool. The only downside was seeing my dog nearly have a heart attack when the bone fell off of the meat. :) Perfection.

Awesome Pork. My go-to recipe for American BBQ. Takes a long time, but keep it low & slow - it's worth it.

I halved this recipe with two 2 lb boneless pork butts. I did not want to grill so I put those suckers atop a roasting pan in the oven at 275 for 8 hours! YES all 8 hours...basting with the vinegar sauce every 30 minutes. for awhile, i did not think they were going to get soft enough to pull apart. I was wrong, and they looked fabulous by the end of their roasting. all the fat dripped into the bottom of the pan and I was left with super moist, pull apart pork for sandwiches (I plan to make tacos with this as well) I might marinate them in some sauce next time,.... they still need to be seasoned well for a meal, but the texture of the meat came out perfect.

This is delicious! Great, easy party food. The kids love it as do adults. I cooked it overnight in the oven. Cooked it on 425 degrees for about 1/2 hour then lowered oven temp to 275 (in my oven 275 equates to an actual temperature of about 260/265. I used a large enamel coated cast iron casserole with lid, I added about 1 cup of the vinegar sauce before it went in the oven. When I woke up in the morning I cut the fat off the top and grilled it on cookie sheets in the oven till it crisped up. In the meantime I shredded the pork and added some vinegar sauce to make it tasty. I didn't use all the vinegar sauce. I left most of it to be used as desired by the guests. I refrigerated it all and heated it up when the guests arrived. I served it with the vinegar sauce on the side and the coleslaw the recipe recommends.

We actually make this in our solar oven outside! This is perfection and turns out beautifully every time!

AWESOME!! We make at least once a month in the summer since the recipe came out in June 08- the coleslaw recipes in a must and tastes delicious with it ( I make it with red pepper vs green). Kids and adults love it and is devoured fast. We put the pork on the middle gas grill with the heat off and have the other 2 grills on for indirect heat- simply the best bbq pork ever!

I made this for my kids's high school graduation and it was gone in 15 minutes! I opted to cook it in the oven, used boneless pork shoulder that I got from Costco, added two cans of Campbells tomato soup to it and dumped all of the sauce on the pork when I served it.

delicious - just like the North Carolina Barbecue I grew up with. We make it every year.

We made this for an election night party. It does take forever, but all pulled pork does. It was amazing. Very flavorful and tender. Everyone really liked the coleslaw that went with it. I'll be serving this again.

Seriously this pork recipe took forever to make and we were all sorely disappointed. Not worth the effort.

Don't waste your time... house stinks like vinegar while making this and the taste is boring & bland. Go for the garlicky pork butt recipe instead.

This is seriously the best pulled pork ever. I made this for superbowl for our usual sports enthuasists. Each of them seperately have asked me to make it for the NBA finals. My husband smokes it for 6-8 hours and it just falls off the bone. Be sure to mop in the specified intervals. The coleslaw per recipe is somewhat too vinegary for my taste so I just add more brown sugar and ketchup. Enjoy!

The pork buut that we used did not have skin, only fat. Very flavorful and moist. Only cooked to an internal temp of about 170-180
