Made this for a party last week. Incredible! I made a chocolate crust instead of crust in this recipe and it was a huge success. I made the shells up two weeks in adavance and froze until day of party. Piped the filling and served.Everyone wanted to know which pastry shop made the desserts.

I thought that the dough was easy to make, easy to use and retained its crispy and light texture very well. I didn't find it to be the best tasting tartlet dough that I've ever used, but it gets high marks for being so easy and durable. I made a few minor changes in the custard and it came out beautifully. In the future I would even consider using it as a base for a super rich chocolate cream pie.

Mine were probably too thick too, but they looked good & tasted wonderful. I will definitely make again

The picture in the magazine looked wonderful, but I had a hard time making the tartlet shells--mine turned out very thick. Still tasty, but not as attractive. The filling was easy and good. I cannot find instant espresso powder, so I just used about double the quantity of instant coffee. Might be better with the real ingredient.
