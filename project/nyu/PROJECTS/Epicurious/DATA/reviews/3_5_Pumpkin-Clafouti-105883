Great easy recipe, especially if you use the canned squash. I prefer eating it cold, and for breakfast. Ran out of cream so used all milk and it was fine. Also didn't want to waste vanilla bean, so just added extra extract, plus some spices. I'm not clear why the batter needs to sit for 30 minutes; can anyone illuminate me? Regardless, I'd definitely make this again.

This is another way to use squash; I used hubbard and ended up with a lot more than 2/3 cup used in this recipe. We thought this recipe was good but not great. The nuts somewhat made up for the lack of pie crust but I love pie crust so next time, if I make this again, I will use this to make a pie. I also suggest adding cinnamon and other spices to taste.

I made them in silicone muffin cups and served them to my French boyfriend's parents. I loved the flavors and the crunch of the nuts.

This was so easy and fabulous...big hit with all. I had bought a cheese pumpkin to make pumpkin pie then saw this recipe. It was sooo much better than pumpkin pie...will definitely make this again

I've made this recipe many times and received rave reviews and requests for the recipe. It's a lot tastier than the usual pumpkin pie. Next time I make it, though, I plan to reduce the sugar. It tasted too sweet when I made it last week.

This was delicious. I used 2/3 cup canned pumpkin and walnuts instead of hazelnuts...also added a pinch of ground cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.

I made this Clafouti for Thanksgiving and agree that it is the perfect finish to a hearty meal. I was only able to get a hold of an "Oriental Pumpkin" and can report that no straining was necessary after roasting. Although I attempted to strain it as the recipe dictated, the pumpkin was so dry I didn't need to. Nor did I bother with the second straining after that. My Clafouti was silky smooth with a texture reminiscent of a flan and a delicious pumpkin flavor. I'd recommend to anyone using this recipe to look for the Oriental Pumpkin, it'll greatly reduce your prep time making an already simple recipe an absolute breeze!
