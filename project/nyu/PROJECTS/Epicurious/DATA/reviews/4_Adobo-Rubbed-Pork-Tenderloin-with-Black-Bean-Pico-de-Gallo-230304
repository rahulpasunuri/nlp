I wish I've read the other's review first. The flavor was excellent, so I will definitely make again but with half the salt! It was so salty that I could not eat much. My husband was nice enough to keep eating, but I have to reduce sodium intake!!!!

I was looking for something to do with the fresh cut pork chops I had and applied the rub to 4 Iowa-style thick-cut chops that I then grilled on an iron stove top grill-line griddle. I like others used teaspoon for tablespoon and also added 1 tsp onion powder. Used pinto beans and added corn to the pico de gallo. The adobo rub was a major winner-- unique flavor (I used smoked salt and smoked paprika) and kept the chops juicy. Sour cream would have been a good idea-- I'll add that next time.

Have had it twice now and recently served it to guests. Rave reviews across the board for flavor. I used 3 different types of paprika, including a smokey one. I also roasted the tenderloin whole. Will definitely use this again.

Super flavorful, easy, and healthy. Even my hubby, who loves a dinner dripping with fat & refined carbs, raved about this one.

3 1/2 forks! Very good! As reviewers suggested, I reduced the paprika amount in half. The spice mixture amount was perfect for two whole pork tenderloins, which is what I was using. Great balance of spices. Grilled on a gas grill beautifully. After slicing and flattening the pork tenderloins into medallions, I tossed them in a large ziploc bag along with the spice mixture. This made the seasoning process very quick and efficient. The medallions were completely covered in dry spice and I was concerned that it would be too overpowering in flavour, but I was proven wrong. Delicious! Served the pico de gallo ontop of a few medallions and topped that with a touch of sour cream. I'll absolutely be making this again.

I made this a couple of times as written and thought it was too heavily spiced. This time I grilled the tenderloin for a few minutes on each side, and it made all the difference in the world -- really excellent. I did reduce the paprika by a third, and the rub mixture is way too much for the pork, as everyone has said. I did use baby spinach for the base instead of arugula. Really -- try grilling the pork, and you will be thrilled with the results.

Made this recipe for cinco de mayo dinner, and it was amazing. Since I only had one tenderloin, I followed previous reviewers' suggestions to reduce the rub mixture. I halved it, but still had some leftover. The rub is super tasty, and I think it will go well with just about everything. I saved the leftover rub for another meal. I kept the beans separate from the pico de gallo, and made some lime cilantro rice. I assumed the pork was supposed to go on top of the arugula, but I skipped it.

I am always searching for pork tenderloin recipes, as the cut of meat is healthy and readily available. This one is a winner! The dish has a full variety of color, texture, and taste. The recipe was simple enough for a weeknight dinner, but the results were perfect for guests. I would only suggest that you make a little more then needed, as the leftovers are not to be missed!

This is one of my most favorite tenderloin recipes. for those of you who like a flavorpacked entree with a little kick you should definitley try this one. I usually still have some unused dry ingredients so I put it in a jar and save the excess for the next time. Great dish.

Modified slightly and it was amazingly good. As reviewers have mentioned, translating to tsp is good idea. I also substituted smoked paprika and used lime instead of lemon, as one reviewer mentioned. Instead of adding black beans to the pico de gallo, I kept them separate and added 1 cup roasted corn kernels (available in frozen section of Trader Joe's if you don't have time/inclination to do your own roasting). I used this as the base layer when plating.

A great recipe, especially in summer. I usually substitute lime juice for the lemon juice, and we serve it with the extra lime wedges, corn tortillas, and rice with some cilantro. Good for you and just plain yummy!

We loved this recipe! Instead of putting the beans in with the pico de gallo, I made rice with sautéed onions and garlic, and added the beans to the rice. Then put the pico on top of all. Great!

Loved this recipe. I made it even easier -- for the pico de gallo I simply added salsa (from Costo) to the beans. Delish. anyone know what to do with the arugula?

This was a good recipe, but no 'wow' factor; quite similiar to many other recipes. The Black Bean Pico de Gallo was also good, but no 'wow' factor. Don't think I would make again -- too many other pork tenderloin recipes that are better.

Honestly, this was a bit of a disappointment. Per other rvwrs comments I changed the TB to tsps. I only used 1 lb. tenderloin and had plenty rub left over. I could have even used less. I thought the chili flavor was too strong. The pico de gallo was the best. I didn't have green onions but didn't notice the absence. I quickly sauteed the arugula and put pork on top. Because of the spice I served with a bit shredded low-fat cheddar cheese and smashed guacamole with multigrain chips from "Food Should Taste Good." Delish..

Halved recipe, and I used what I had on hand by substituting fresh for 3/4 can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos, 1/2 of paprika used was smoked paprika, lime juice instead of lemon juice, and trader joe's cubed frozen cilantro for fresh. Picky boyfriend raved saying he wouldn't change a thing and that recipe should be kept on rotation. Lots of flavor packed in a healthy meal.

I made this and served it over quinoa instead of arugula and it is probably my favorite pork dish that I have ever made. The rub is great and the meat was cooked perfectly. I will definitely make again!

yum! made the pico de gallo without the chili powder and served black beans and rice on the side. a big hit.

The meat turned out beautifully, but the main thing I got from this recipe was the rub. Since other reviewers said the amounts listed netted too much, I combined my powders into a snap-lid shaker container so that I could use the leftover amount with other dishes. And am I glad I did! I've avoided adding sugar to ANYTHING over the years, but am starting to change my tune. Didn't have brown sugar, but had packets of "Sugar in the Raw", natural cane Turbinado sugar from Hawaii. Other powders were predominately smoked paprika, black & white pepper, kosher salt, a multi-chili-powder blend, turmeric, ground thyme, onion powder, and garlic salt. Play with the quantities, and then sprinkle over other dishes -- as I have with mashed potatoes, baked salmon, scrambled eggs -- whatever you want. The shaker container now goes right on the table at mealtime.

What can I say that hasn't been said already? This is a wonderful and light way to make pork. The salsa is delicious and makes the dish. I made the following adjustments based on past reviews: Changed the rub measurement from tsbp to tsp and there was still plenty left over. Substituted lime juice for the lemon juice. Eliminated the arugula. Cooked the tenderoin whole (about 20 mins or until meat thermometer read 150 degrees). Used 4 roma tomatoes and 1 can black beans. It was cooked perfectly and the flavors were nice and light. Loved it!

Really easy to make, especially if you use the zip bag method for mixing the rub and coating the pork. Feel free to play with the rub ingredients (I added some garlic powder and thyme and used a mixture of "standard", hot and smoked paprikas). Make sure you're patient and get a good sear on the pieces (I sliced the whole loin into 1/2" slices). It'll finish much quicker in the oven that way. The salsa is great (you don't even miss the oil!) and can be used for a billion things (I prefer lime juice and added some minced garlic)! Really lots of fun to make and eat and re-use. I love arugula but didn't bother with out (grocery out). Served with yellow Spanish rice but the tortilla idea sounds great (as do many other left-over ideas presented previously).

Very tasty. Made as directed although I had to cook it a little longer than advised, maybe 6-8 minutes longer and the middles were still slightly pink. Arugala?

This was such a delicious pork recipe.....the pork turned out nice and moist. I used 3 tbs of paprika and 1tbs of smoked paprika which was perfect, any more paprika would have been too much.

I have made this recipe 3 times now and we have really enjoyed its robust flavor and textures. The only change I made was to substitute corn for the black beans at the request of the majority of my family; personally, I liked the black beans. I have served this to guests and they all asked for the recipe.

This recipe has been one of my most favorite using pork tenderloin. The mix of spices calls for extra but if you save some in jar you can always throw it on something else down the road!

This was delicious, although I agree there is too much paprika. The second time I made it, I used half the amount of paprika (2 tbsp sweet, 1 tbsp hot), added a touch of sugar and ground allspice, then put the spice mix in a zip-lock bag, along with the pork pieces. I found this coated the pieces excellently, and uses all the rub (much less mess!) I then seared the pork in oil to which I had added annato (achiote) seeds, which gave the oil a lovely red "Southwestern" tint. Remove the pork, and quickly saute an onion sliced into rings. Place the onions in a roasting pan, top with the pieces of pork, cover with a foil tent, and roast in oven until done.

Decided to follow recipe as written except I applied the rub to the pork 4 hours before and then cooked over the grill. Can you say OLE!!!

Great with the tenderloin grilled --score the pork to massage more of the rub inside (no problem with the heat in this family). The best part is the pico de gallo, though. Very versatile--keep it in the fridge to add a dollop to grilled sword fish, etc. or add to black beans and brown rice for a tasty, healthy brown-bag lunch. (simplify the recipe with one can of rinsed black beans and one can of drained diced tomatoes.

I must have done something wrong because I thought the flavor of the rub was way too overpowering. I thought it was too heavy on the paprika. I'll try cutting down the amount of paprika next time. The pico de gallo was great. Oh, you are supposed to serve the pork and pico de gallo on top of the arugula (I found this recipe in a magazine).

Delicious, but way to spicy hot. We had to scrape off a lot of the spice mix and tone it down with sweet wine. I'll make it again, but with 1/3 the spices.

Delicious! I made it with lemon juice -- I did my shopping before reading the reviews, and didn't have lime juice -- and it was wonderful.

Since this is a summery recipe and it is now winter, I made the black beans over the stove. In summer, I would definitely recommend grilling the pork tenderloin whole--first searing for grillmarks, then over low heat for 30-45 minutes--that way, you won't burn and lose the spice rub like you do in a pan. The pork was really delicious and tender. Served with Spanish rice and tortillas, and the leftovers make great burritos.

Spicy, easy, tasty and definitely a keper. I agree with the reviewer who suggested that the spices could be cut to one third by substituting "tsp" for "tbs". I made half of the spice mix, used it on over 2# of pork tenderloin, and still had half of the spice mix leftover. Used lime juice rather than lemon as suggested by others, one can of black beans and only three (large) tomatoes. Didn't bother trying to figure out what to do with the arugula.

This dish is very flavorful and easy to make. I used a spicy paprika, Mexican chili powder and chipotle chili powder (instead of the cayenne). Like other reviewers I used lime juice, canned diced tomatoes and some of the spice rub in the pico de gallo. I served the pico de gallo on white rice and it was an excellent combination.

I used pork chops instead of tenderloin. The rub adds fantastic flavor to the pork. Followed the recipe: pan-seared the chops in an over safe skillet (cast iron works well). Finished them in the oven. About the same amount of baking time with a small amount of water added to the skillet prior to placing in oven. This helps tenderize the chops; be sure not to overcook. Slightly tougher than a tenderloin but flavorful just the same. Served the Pico de gallo without the black beans as I did not have any on hand. Still delicious! I use a very similiar rub on chicken: thoroughly rub on chicken breasts covered in a thick layer. Let sit at room temperture for 45 min. Bake in 350 degree oven for 45-60 min. Serve as is or cool and shred to use in your favorite white bean chili recipe.

I made this dish last night and it was an instant hit! I did not cut the tenderloin in portions, I grilled it whole. Served it with cilantro rice, guacamole w/blue chips. My husband and adult son raved about it. This is keeper, I think I'll try the spice rub on chicken too.

This is a fabulous recipe. Easy, quick and very tasty. I will definitely make this again. I saved the extra spice mix. Thought I might try it with chicken one day. I wasn't sure what to do with the arugula either so I skipped it but might saute it up next time.

I am about ready to make this for a client. Substituting lime juice for the lemon, and will put arugula in the grill pan right before I roast the pork in the oven.

This was delicious and super fast to through together. On the salsa, I left out most of the onions and the jalepeno pepper to make it "safe" for our kids. I substituted a diced bell pepper which was nice. Both my 4 and 7 y/o loved it. I too didn't know what to do w/ the arugula, so I mixed it with fresh spinach and lightly braised it, and served the pork atop.

This dish is great because it is tasty and easy. Also I think it is a good one to tinker with. Next time I will try spicing it up a bit on the adobo rub (perhaps substituting the generic chili powder with something more specific like crushed chipolte chili pepper, jalapeno chile pepper or new mexico chile pepper). And I think adding lime juice instead of lemon might be a little more interesting.

This was the easiest way to prepare tenderloin for a group. I did omit the salt - never noticed it. The recipe makes enough for 4 tenderloins so I kept some for future use on chicken. I also served it with mango salsa - also non fat and added a nice fruity flavor....mmmm.

Wow. Easy and so tasty. I changed the spice mix to tsps from tbsps and it was still plenty. I think you could reduce the salt amount by half. I don't generally cook with salt, so that might be why it seemed a bit salty. Not sure where the arugala was supposed to go, so I just munched it while I prepared the dish, and put the leftovers as a bed for the pork. I used one inch porkloins, which took about 20 minutes in the oven, after 10 in the pan. For the pico de gallo, one 15 oz can of black beans with 3 medium tomatoes was the right proportion, unless you are a bean lover. I also put quite a bit more lime - you might find that a way to liven it up, if that's your thing.
