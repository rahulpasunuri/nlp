Good "peasant food," ideal for a weeknight meal or a simple dinner with close friends. I used spaghetti and store-bought bread crumbs. I added the juice from half a lemon and 1/4 tsp.crushed red pepper. It was certainly a very easy recipe and I nearly always have all the ingredients on hand. I will serve without the cheese to my vegan friends. Next time I will use a little less olive oil to brown the breadcrumbs but add a Tbsp. olive oil to the pasta before tossing with the crumbs.

Great flavor for a pasta side dish. I used purchased bread crumbs and it turned out excellent!

With my tweaking, i'd give this dish 4 forks! I did a separate white wine reduction (cheap chardonnay works just fine!), added lemon juice & a bit of olive oil, then tossed the pasta with this sauce, then the capers, garlic & breadcrumbs mixture. Gives a little more substantial flavor.

This recipe has all the potential to be really amazing. I've made it three times with some slight adjustments. I used thick spaghetti for starters. I added one cup of hot pasta water at the end as the mixture can be really thick. I also squeezed half a lemon in as well. Throw in a handful of grated Parmesan and it's amazing. Super creamy and delicious. A great vegetarian alternative. Every person I have made this for gobbles it up with rave reviews. I also made this the other night without capers and added finely chopped anchovies and some vinegar. This is seriously some good stuff.

Just made this for diner. Very yummy and fast if you don't have many ingredients on hand. Added some fresh diced tomatoes on top before serving for some extra zest.

I forgot to mention that I made this with thin spaghetti, which I prefer to heavy pasta.

Very tasty and easy to prepare. If you make a small quantity, it makes a nice light supper.

This was really interesting. I was wary of the ingredients but everyone liked it. I will definitely make again with spaghetti. I didn't like the large pasta I used...would be much better with a thin spaghetti.

Tasty - definitely needs the lemon juice. I used whole wheat spaghetti and halved the recipe including using just two tablespoons of oil, which was enough. Great as a side dish and even as a meatless main.

I did not enjoy this recipe. It was very fast and easy to make, however the taste was heavily dependent on the capers and I felt it was too much of a good thing. Maybe lemon juice evens out the taste?

Quick, easy, and tasty! I've never had capers before and only added half of the what the receipe said - BIG mistake. The capers are wonderful and I regreted not adding all of them. Don't skimp on the capers even if you're unsure. They really add to this dish.

Yummy, quick and easy. My husband loved it too. I cheated on the bread crumbs and used a garlic and herb supermarket brand -- still delicious. As another reviewer suggested, I added lemon juice. Good addition.

I thought this was good, but my honey & room-mates thought it was great. I loved the fact that it was so quick & easy to make. Good with herb grilled chicken. Next time, I'll grill the chicken with herbs & lemon juice, and I'll add lemon juice to the pasta dish also.

I made this dish for some vegetarian friends and we all loved it! It is very flavorfull even though the ingredients are limited. I added fresh lemon juice. Double the recipe if you are using it as a main dish!!

This was ready in a flash. Everyone enjoyed it, including my three-year old. I skipped the capers and prefer it without the parmesan. This recipe is similar to a pasta dish included in one of Deborah Madison's books and included in Gourmet many years ago. It calls for tarragon, basil,and other herbs in addition to the parsley. So if you have those on hand, add them. It makes the dish stand out.

Very tasty and, best of all, very easy to make QUICKLY. A great pasta dish to whip together at the last minute.

Just made this again, and continue to enjoy it. I like increasing the garlic and capers slightly, and find that the flavor is even better. A hint; in the morning, cut off a section of the bread that you plan to serve with the meal, and cut off the crusts. Leave this on your kitchen counter all day, and by dinner time, it's dry enough to grate easily for the pasta.

Tripled the sauce because I used a pound of capellini. Used the juice of 1 1/2 lemons. Didn't bother chopping the capers, just chopped the garlic. Can be made while the pasta cooks. Quick and delicious. When you have ten minutes to make dinner, this is it!

This could have been better if I hadn't halved the sauce when making it for two. I needed more of the capers and garlic. This dish has definite potential. I will try it again.

One of the best pasta dishes I've ever made! @>--}----- @>--}--- @>--}--- @>--}----- Perhaps some fresh, chopped spinach leaves would be good, but it would be difficult to improve on this elegantly simple dish.
