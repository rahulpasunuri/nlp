Have not tried this - but wondering why you can't just use almond milk and be done with? Also note to reviewer: almond paste is very simple and inexpensive to make in the cuisinart, using blanched almonds, sugar syrup, some icing sugar and almond extract. Sorry, don't have exact recipe to hand.

Enjoyed this as a refreshing and unusual end to dinner on a hot day. Unfortunately, my Granita had a grainy finish, perhaps you need a very fine mesh to separate the pulp. I think this would be fantastic with an espresso/chocolate/mocha sauce drizzled on top. Will make this again and use a very fine mesh.

Yum! This is so tasty and refreshing. And so easy to make. I added a little cinnamon at the end, and it almost tastes like a horchata. I think the hardest part was finding almond paste, which luckily I was able to locate at Whole Foods.
