Another variation: use plain, nonfat Greek yogurt (in lieu of mayonnaise) to help breadcrumbs adhere to fish. Adds a subtle tang as well. Omitted butter to keep it low-fat, and used purchased seasoned panko breadcrumbs. Simple & tasty.

Made this even easier by adding Greek Seasoning to the bread crumbs so did not have to process or add anything else. Used on Mong Chong, a white fish, and it was moist and delicious. Served with a vinegrette salad and all the flavors were very well balanced. Will definately do again!

Very quick and easy recipe to make. Only change I made was instead of stuffing I used half Panko bread crumbs, half reg. herbed bread crumbs and some extra fresh parsley. Delicious and satisfying!

I thought this was really good and would definitely make it again. It was fast, easy and I already had all the ingredients in the house--perfect for dinner on a busy day. I threw a clove of garlic in the food processor and used more lemon peel than called for and was pleased with the result.

I used local (Maine) haddock filets, doubled the lemon zest, added 1/2 tsp of sea salt and 2 tablespoons of fresh tarragon. IT WAS FABULOUS! Hubby loves it, mother loves it...a hit!

Very easy to make. Flavor was a bit bland even though I added more spices (rosemary, sage) to the breadcrumbs and pureed garlic to the butter. Texture was good, fish was moist inside and breadcrumb topping was crisp, not at all soggy.

In short, this recipe reminded me of something I would whip together from odds and ends when I didn't have time to shop.

At first I tried this recipe with Cod and didn't care much for it. When I tried it again with flounder and tilapia fillet, it was much better. I also think the choice in stuffing mix makes a difference as well. I usually use Stove-Top herb stuffing mix. I also add one other blend-spice to give it a little bit more flavor. With these modifications, it is a huge hit with my guests.

I am always looking for a good easy fish recipe; this was a decent recipe. I don't know if I would make it again soon, but I will keep it in my file. Right out of the oven was delicious, but the leftovers were soggy. Had a very strong lemon taste, I usually squeeze lemon on my fish but with this recipe it didn't need it.

We thought it was wonderful. I did add tony chacheres seasoning, ground mustard, garlic powder to italian herb bread crumbs for the breading mixture. Was very good.

I have 3 VERY picky eaters at home and every one of them cleaned their plate. Was not too keen on the cod though, prefer other types of fish but will definately try it again. Had no problem with the recipe, fast preparation. Cod was extremely moist.

This is a wonderful fast, tasty, recipie. My family loves it; I have prepared it three times! I now do not use stuffing; instead I toss one slice of bread into the blender with some fresh parsley and lemon peel. I combine this with Italian bread crumbs. This and seasoning with lemon-pepper are the only changes I made, otherwise I follow the recipie. Try this for a great, moist fish dinner!

I had a rockfish fillet, and wanted to do something different. I didn't have stuffing mix... so I used dry bread crumbs, thyme, parsley, a pinch of dill and a pinch of cayenne. This was just great! Crunchy outside, moist inside, and so easy. A definite keeper in the fish file.

This is a great, easy recipe! Like the cook from Vilnius, Lithuania, I substituted a mixture of breadcrumbs and herbs instead for the stuffing mixture. I also used frozen fillets and let them thaw completely, patting them dry before sprinkling with salt and pepper and brushing with butter. My husband and I both thought the fish was delicious. A definite keeper!

it isn't bad. It didn't turn out mushy, but it is a bit to salty for my taste. I would just use vread crumbs and add the spices I want if I was to make it again.

Delicious! I couldn't get stuffing mix so I used a mixture of breadcrumbs, herbs, Dijon mustard, and a little cornmeal for texture. The fish came out a little soggy, but I was pressed for time and didn't let the frozen fillets thaw out enough... It was still wonderful-my husband is still thanking me for dinner 4 hours later! Served it with roasted herbed red-skinned new potatoes and sauteed green beans and carrots.

I really don't know if it is fair of me to actually rate this recipe, being that I didn't even use the stuffing mix...but try this... I soaked 5 Orange Roughy filets in milk - patted dry - coated 2 filets with Italian bread crumbs, lemon zest, parsley, and salt & pepper. I then coated two more filets in black and white sesame seeds with garlic and the 3rd filet was rubbed with Dijon mustard and coated in the breadcrumb mixture. Pan seared all and finished in the oven. Served with lemon steamed broccoli and cauliflower and onion herbed rice. YUM!

This recipe has the potential to be very good with one change to it. Be sure to use the low sodium stuffing mix because I used a Pepperidge Farm One-Step Stuffing Mix and the saltiness of the mix over-powered the taste of the fish. Otherwise, the grated lemon really gave it a good taste.

It was really good - mine wasn't soggy at all. I used dried parsley instead of fresh. It turned out surprisingly well.

Soggy, soggy! Needs tweaking, but has good potential.

This is a very simple and delicious to make. Both my huband and daughter loved, in fact they suggestted that we have it once a month. This is a miracle for a fish dinner! They only add I did was to serve it with fresh lemon quarter for the adults and homemade tartar sauce for the kids. Enjoy!
