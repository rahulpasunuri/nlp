A quick and easy side dish that goes well most main courses but would not over power them.

Sometimes, the old KISS rule, really is just the only way. Simple, quick, delicious, and proof you don't have to be an epicurian artisan on every dish to still have happy faces at the dinner table. Try vegetable broth instead...I think it's a better taste blend.

The glaze was tasteless! Easy enough, quicky enough, but nearly indistingushable from steamed veggies with butter.

Colourful and delicious! We used vegetable broth and the flavour was still great. Simple to prepare, elegant, and got lots of compliments from the guests!

This was a perfect addition to my savory-stuffed roast chicken. The vegetables had a slight chicken flavour but wasn't overpowering. Very quick and easy to prepare.

Found the veggies to be too soft at the suggested cooking times. The glaze could have used more flavor.

This is very flavorful, colorful and quick. An easy "company" side dish.

This is a standby for me. The color is always pretty when plated with meats and potatoes.

this was a great glaze to take plain carrots to a level of royalty. Instead of chicken broth, I used 3/4's of a chicken cube and then added water in place of broth. I find that sometimes broth is not flavorful enough but this method did the trick.

Very easy and always a hit. I've made this several times.

4 minutes perfectly cooked the veggies, but then after sautee they were too droopy. The sauce was very bland, I would add some teriyaki.
