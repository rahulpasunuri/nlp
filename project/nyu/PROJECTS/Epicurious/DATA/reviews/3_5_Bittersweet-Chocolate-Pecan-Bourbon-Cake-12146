I'd give this 3 and 1/2 folks if that were an option. It was a big hit and does not need to be modified very much. As others have said, the cake stands alone, so you can modify the glazes (try caramel) or have it without the chocolate glaze. I'd also recommend adding a few more nuts, but I am a pecan lover. Will make many more times.

This cake served as an excellent birthday cake for a bourbon loving friend of mine. I followed the recipe exactly and had no trouble with it. I found the chocolate glaze to be wonderful but not necessary. This cake really could stand alone. It's rich, moist and has an scrumptiously smooth texture.

To the inexperienced baker: you might have noticed this recipe is not like a usual cake recipe with more flour and less eggs. In fact this cake has many more eggs than a typical cake and almost no flour. It also has a great deal of real chocolate and not cocoa. This type of cake is called a 'flourless' cake despite it having a tablespoon of flour. It comes out more like a cheesecake in texture or truffle filling. It is a thin cake with a thinner glaze (or even just a dusting of cocoa or icing sugar) and you give each person a slice about an inch wide at the outside edge as it is very rich. There is no way to make a layer cake from a recipe like this. For that look for recipes with pictures of layers or even the word layer in the title. The two ingredients that make up most of the cake are the eggs and chocolate. To leave out the chocolate is to surely ruin the recipe. So if you're in the mood for a rich, dense cake with no airy bubbles, do try the recipe again exactly as it says. Flourless cakes really impress guests.

I thought this was fantastic. I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews but I am so glad I made it! I had to use a 10" pan because that's the only size I had, so maybe that's why the cake didn't look so funny. I also added more chocolate because I am an admitted chocoholic. Delicious.

I've made this cake several times for myself and as a gift. Each time it has been delicious and well accepted. I love this quick, easy, yummy cake.

This cake was fabulous! It took more time than I expected to make it but it was well worth it. I will definitely make this again.

I am not an inexperienced baker, but I had alot of trouble with this recipe; the cake did not rise enough to cut two layers let alone three. The cake was damp and heavy. The only modification I made was to omit the chocolate from the cake; is the recipe posted correct?

I have made this a number of times. It is the oddest looking cake before you cover it with the glaze. You might feel like it isn't right but as long as the cake tester is clean you have done well. Sometimes, in Denver (5280 ft.) the deflation is quite dramatic.

This cake is tender and moist, and flavors go well together. I added a little bourbon to the ganache to carry that flavor over. Although I whipped the egg whites on medium speed to allow for expansion in the oven, the cake fell quite a bit after I removed it. So, although the cake was delicious, the presentation suffered.
