Yuk. I had the misfortune of making this twice (I'd forgotten how bad it was the first time--it looks good on paper!). So, I can say from experience that this is not worth the effort. For all the work involved, there is very little flavor. And, the recipe makes so much, you need many bowls to hold the ever-increasing ingredients.

A nice looking but completely lackluster tasting recipe. Followed it exactly - should have taken some detours it appears. Has potential if you feel like coming up with your own sauce/dressing.

First, this recipe serves 12, not 4, but that's a good thing since it got rave reviews and everyone wanted seconds. It's truly a tasty dish, but it is labor intensive _lots of chopping. I would use low-sodium soy sauce and maybe throw in some Thai hot peppers. Also, don't feel limited by the vegetables suggested. Any veggies would work just as well _ broccoli comes to mind.

We weren't wild about the salad. but the dressing - that was really good and would make a good marinade for chicken. It had a nice flavor.

Yes, it make a ton, which is just what I needed for a pot-luck dinner party! It was a big hit and nicely unusual. I did add chopped coriander, a big dose of red pepper flakes, and an extra dollup of dark sesame oil at the end. I'll certainly make it again for "schlep-a-pot" parties, though I'll have my husband help with the chopping!

Serves 4? More like 40! This is a huge salad and also a lot of work. But it's worth it. Add a few drops of hot chili oil (or pepper flakes) for extra kick. Next time, I'll try it with shrimp or shredded chicken.
