This was great, added the mushrooms and garlic like another reviewer had suggested, cut the oil down to 1T oil 1T butter, and left off the moz. cheese and used parm instead. Will make this again and again!

Loved the recipe. We wilted a bag of fresh spinach in the onions just before adding the tomatoes. This added a nice favor. For even more Italian, we topped the finished dish with Romano cheese.

I would defintley make this recipe again - turned out better than I expected. Easy to prepare. Used a number of the suggestions from other reviewers: 2 tbs olive oil and 2 tbs butter instead of 1/4 c butter; approx 4 cloves garlic; red pepper instead; fresh basil instead; 1 cup cheese; 1/4 cup prepared suace. Drained tomatoes VERY well - no issue with dish being too watery. Found tomatoe mixture to be a bit bland after sauteeing - added some italian seasoning to enahnce the overall flavor. Like other New Englanders, the haddock itself was a beautiful piece of fish. The tomatoe mixture was an excellent compliment, did not overtake the fish.

I've made this dish with and without the cheese, also adding mushrooms, red peppers, and fresh tomatoes...each and every time it is wonderful!

I've had luck with this recipe. As a new englander I have access to excellent quality fresh fish - which helps. I like to make the dish lighter - so I reduced the butter to 1/4 stick and substituted the mozzarella with 1/4 cup of grated parmesan. I also substituted fresh tomatoes for the canned - especially when they are in season.

I have made this many times. it is very easy and I don't bother measuring anything when making it. i add a red bell pepper, oregano and garlic when i sauté the onions and don't drain the tomatoes when adding. this requires cooking the sauce down longer but adds more flavor i think. also, i use fresh mozz and server over white rice to soak up the additional sauce.

I have made this twice (am in the middle of making it a third time) and I think it's great. I use cherry tomatoes and cook them down as well as adding garlic. I serve it with cream and cheese pasta which works well. I served this to a friend with an italian wife without telling him about the dish and afterwards he told me it tasted italian... I really cannot recommend this enough, it is very easy and so so nice.

I used half the cheese, Mexican, and drained spicy stewed tomatoes. and wine during the prep and the cooking and with the meal. Seems to work! Next time 1/2 the butter, more basil, more cheese. I served it with spicy Mexican rice for a carb. Nice balance

I laid Cod on top of a bed of crap meat and scallops and I was a BIG hit with the dish:)

I made the changes recommended by the cook from Lake Placid except to use less cheese. It was just okay in my book. I realize that I am in real minority this time, think it needs something.

This has been a HUGE hit! I often serve this when hosting dinner parties and everyone loves eating fish that does not taste like "fish." I actually add Classico Tomato Basil sauce to mine for more thickness and use less tomatoes and onions. I also add a little minced garlic and McCormick's season salt for a little kick. I really enjoy this recipe!

I made this last night for a dinner party after reading the rave reviews here. It was good, but not as outstanding as I expected. I used tilapia instead of haddock, and fresh basil instead of dried. I will make this again because it's quick and easy, but probably not for guests.

Certainly not a Marcella Hazan approved Italian fish entree (mozzarella on fish!!!!), but it was quick, easy and very comforting winter food. Omitted the green bell, substituted fresh basil for the dried and like most others I cut down on the butter and cheese and added a couple of cloves of garlic.

Loved it. I added a rib of celery, oregano, and 3 cloves of minced garlic. Used 2 T of olive oil instead of butter, and low fat Swiss cheese. Served it over pasta. It was a hit!

When I made this I used half the butter mixed with a tablespoon of olive oil to saute' the onion and pepper. Also used 1 cup cheese vs 2. 2 cups I think is too much. Very good tasting and left-overs are good too as the tomatoes add more flavor. I also decided to use 1 Tbsp fresh basil chopped finely instead of dried. Added a nice aroma. Will definitely make again, except this time, for friends.

This recipe is good. The cheese adds an interesting twist. I used olive oil instead of butter, fresh basil (1/4 cup) and fresh tomato (homegrown). It's easy, pretty, and delicious. There is a lot of liquid that comes from the fish and tomatoes, which may be why some thought the sauce too runny. I took care to place the vegetable mixture squarely over the fish, rather than throughout the pan, and it stayed there, making the presentation easy.

the recipe was fine but the second time i made it i added 2 minced cloves of garlic and a dash of oregano it made it taste much better i also used half the cheese

I didn't have any peppers or canned tomatoes so I used prefab spaghetti sauce. Nor did I use 2 cups of grated cheese, which I think is excessive. I just sprinkled some on top until it covered the fish -- probably 3/4 cup. The final result was very tasty and I would definitely make it again!

Had this Christmas Eve, I can't wait to prepare it myself as it was very good. A mild fish which I like.

Wonderful, with a few changes. Cut down on the green pepper (I actually subbed a banana pepper), seed and chop up one fresh tomato - medium size instead of the canned tomatoes, add 1 cup prepared spaghetti sauce and sub the dried basil with a TBSP of pesto. Also trim back on the cheese and the butter.

I made this recipe sans green peppers. Heeding a prior posting, I literally wrung out the tomatoes before chopping and let them drain after. We thought it was delicious and I will make it again.

It smelled great in the oven but the final dish was swimming in a watery mess. I followed the recipe and drained the tomatoes before and after chopping. Disappointing.

Fortunate to live where fresh haddock and other fish are nearly always available, I try fish recipes 2-3 times per week generally. This is my favorite Italian-style fish. Oh, so good!

Nice recipe. I skipped the mozz for lightness but enjoy the fish nonetheless. I steam-reheated the leftovers whose taste had gained fullness ; they were perfect : no dryness. I plan to use the recipe again soon, adding some lemon juice or capers for a little zing.

Made the above last night and it was delicious. I was shortchanged at the store with my haddock so I had to beef it up with fresh salmon. My husband cannot eat tomatoes (reflux) so I used jarred red peppers and valdalia onions with light Cabot Cheddar cheese. Baked covered 25 minutes in my convection oven. Delicious and very rich considering it did not have outrageous ingredients. This morning I took the leftovers and mixed with mayo for a sandwich pita filling. My husband had no problem with the peppers. Enjoy!

This recipe was quick to make and had a nice flavor. The tomatoes complimented the haddock nicely. I thought the recipe was missing the flavor of a little something-I'd squeeze lemon over the fish before adding the sauce next time. Overall, I would make again for a nice fish recipe for a quick weekday meal.

This was a delicious dish. I made some minor modifications. I added in 4 crsushed garlic cloves. I used stewed tomatoes as I didn't have any whole ones. I also added tomato paste to thicken the sauce. I substituted a red pepper for the green. I finished it up with plenty of basil and oregano. I will defintely make this again.

I made this for dinner tonight,and must say this was a very tasty dish. I followed the recipe as called for except added sliced mushrooms to the saute ingredients. I'm on the adkin"s diet so i used all the butter and whole milk shredded cheese. Cooked the recommended time in a 9 x 13 glass casserole dish, and the fish was moist,and really tasty. I put hot sauce on mine,put I put hot sauce on everthing.We will make this many times again.

Could someone explain why the substitutions make this so bad? I would think that cod (related to haddock) would be fine, and I'd like to know what happened with the cod and/or sole that others thought were such a mistake. Thanks

This dish was very easy to make and VERY VERY delicious! In addition to the basil, pepper, and salt....I included a pinch of fresh sage, crushed red pepper, and about 1/4C of pinot grigio. Instead of the 14 oz. can of tomatoes, I used the larger 28 oz. can, which yielded more sauce....which went VERY well with pasta the next day! I definitley recommend this dish!

I used about a 3/4 lb piece of lingcod. Sauteed an onion and a couple of cloves of sliced garlic. Added a can of "italian style" tomatoes WITH the juice, and broke up the tomatoes as the juice evaporated. I did not use bell pepper. I did sprinkle in a little HOT pepper flakes. Baked it for the 20min but it was not quite "there" yet so I put on the cheese and gave it another 10-15 min. Sprinkled fresh chopped Italian parsley over. Just served it with hot San Francisco French bread and a big salad. The tast was reminiscent of cioppino. VERY LOW FAT and HIGH FLAVOR!

Iused fresh basil and fresh tomatoes--simply chopped them with the skins on. Placed fish in an oiled pan and cooked it on the grill. Wonderful!

I agree with the earlier cook who advised against using other fish. My fishmonger had run out of haddock, so I used cod. It wasn't horrid but I wouldn't do that again. Also added capers just because I had 'em and I love 'em.

Other than reducing the cheese in half, this recipe is a keeper. When I opened the oven the aroma was fantastic. The whole family loved this dish. It's worth a try.

I might try this recipe again with haddock, but it is horrid with some other fish, such as Sole, which I used the other night.

Very good quick recipie! To make this even more flavorful, I used canned diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic (i.e. "italian style") and added a clove of garlic which i minced and sauted with the onions and peppers. I also sprinkled some italian bread crumbs and a bit of parmesan on top of the mozzarella.

Very good. Changes are 1 1/2 T. Olive oil in place of butter, 1 T. re-hydrated celery, 1/2 t. garlic pwd., 1 C. mozzarella & sprinkle parsley atop chz. before baking. I also used Microwave to cook the peppers & onions until softened. Proceed with rest of ingredients to make sauce also in Microwave. The rest of course, in oven. Served over a Lemon Pepper Angel Hair pasta with broccoli spears as a side.

I used much less butter (about 1 tsp) and substituted canned tomato sause for canned tomatoes. I also added 3 oz of hot picante sauce and a 4 oz can of mushrooms. It turned out great!
