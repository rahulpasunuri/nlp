We enjoyed this clam chowder, although it did not thicken up as expected. I added an additional slurry of potato starch as I tend to think it lends less starchy flavor to a dish (and it already contains potatoes), but it was still somewhat thin. That said, the potatoes provide a heartiness and creaminess to the soup, so it really wasn't a big deal. I followed the recipe exactly, however I removed the bacon before adding the other ingredients so that it would be a crisp accoutrement rather than soggy bacon. Also used scallions instead of chives since I had them on hand. I would add a splash or two of good sherry next time. Otherwise, a yummy, hearty soup for the cold months that is simple to make, even with fresh clams. I can imagine it would only take 40-45 minutes if using canned or frozen clam meat.

Easily the best clam chowder I've ever had. The bacon and veggies added a fabulous, smokey flavor in the clam juice and blended perfectly with the cream. I did add several snips of fresh chives, handful of fresh parsley and 1/4 cup cooking sherry. I also used fresh clams and made the juice described in the recipe - absolute perfection. Serve with sourdough bread for a perfect meal.
