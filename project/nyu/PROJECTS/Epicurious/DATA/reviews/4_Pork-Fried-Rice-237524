This is so yum and easy to make, too. The hardest part is cutting up the pork. It looks like it's from the chinese restaurant but it's not as greasy. We added snow peas and a little extra pork tenderloin. I can't wait to make this again with more vegetables and brown rice.

I had a pork tenderloin left over from the previous nights dinner, and so I used that to make this dish. OMG Superb. Asian always has a lot of indgredients, but WOW, I'm making this from now to eternity. This beat out the previous nights dinner by a landslide. Use the EXACT ingredients and you'll be happpy.

Excellent! Made without pork and substituted diced veggies, carrots, celery, pea pods, sprouts, peppers and frozen peas. Added minced garlic with the ginger, and decreased veg. oil. Stirred in raw eggs at end to cook. Made rice in chicken broth, Taste was a but too sweet so next time will do 1/2 hoisin and 1/2 oyster sauce and decrease sugar. Could use either the pork, or chicken, beef or shrimp!

I didn't have a wok, so used a large frying pan with good results. I made with brown rice and added fresh pineapple and peas. I agree with the reviews that it probably didn't need 1/3 cup oil, when I try it again I will cut it down.

Great classic flavor combos... Used a long rack of pre-rubbed ribs (250-4hr) instead of fillets and subbed basmati rice for a lighter texture. Some sriracha perked it up nicely. Excellent day-after of course!

I made this last night and my family loved it. I followed the recipe fairly closely with the exception of omitting the malt vinegar and substituting cider vinegar. I added bean sprouts at the end which gave it a nice crunch. The next time I make it, I would use different rice (used Uncle Ben's long grain white). It was a little softer than I would have liked (even undercooked). I'd also add more veggies to make it into a full meal.

Oh and I forgot to mention I have never been able to duplicate the fried rice you get at the local take out.....until now. I don't know what the secret ingredient is but it's definitely in this recipe. This recipe is a keeper

I made this recipe and used bacon instead of the pork strips and oyster sauce instead of the hoisin. It was awesome. I am planning on making it again using the hoisin sauce, but I am still going to use bacon because everything is better with bacon.

Wowza. Really easy and the final product looked like fried rice from the local takeout. I didn't change a thing.

I made this from leftover pork tenderloin. My whole family liked it and asked that it go on the repeat list. I found it easy to make, so I enjoyed making this for my family.

This was good. Changed the recipe a bit. Used 3 cups of rice, 2 eggs, added some leftover vegetables. Added a few cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp chili paste and about 1/2 Tbs of fish sauce. Oh and I only used like 2 Tbs of oil, was plenty. Would make it again!

This is a wonderful and quick dish that gives a fresh spin on leftover pork tenderloin. My husband and I really enjoy this dish!

My husband said that it was the most delicious fried rice that he had ever had. We went to Ben Pao Restaurant in Chicago a few weeks ago, and this recipe surpassed theirs. I made some modifications: used leftover tri-tip roast from Trader Joe's; 1 pint of leftover white rice from Chinese food order several days before; added SOYYAKI SAUCE from Trader Joe's instead of soy sauce; and Archer Farms Thai peanut sauce (Target). Also used toasted sesame oil combined with canola oil to cook the egg and to create the sauce; it did not require 1/3 cup of oil--maybe 3 Tbsp. in a non-stick skillet. A little low salt vegetable broth (Trader Joe's) gave it some additional moisture and a very pretty color. It definitely needed garlic and a little kick--I'm not sure what would work - a little Thai chili sauce, perhaps?? I will be making this again and again.....

This was really fantastic. The only thing I changed was I didn't use the pork fillets. I used leftover chinese barbeque pork from this site. No need to order out anymore!

This turned out to be a great quick and easy supper dish. I have to admit that I was somewhat creative with the ingredients. I had almost everything on hand. But I didn't have fresh ginger (I am sure that I missed it.) and no Hoisin sauce. But overall The dish is very tasty,fast and easy. I used powder ginger plus a little Yoshida's sauce. I also added peas and carrots. I am very happy with the out come. Next time I am going to try some Wasabi paste during the sauce making part of the preparation. I like a little more bite to the food. I also used brown rice.

This recipe is so good that I now plan ahead and make extra pork tenderloin and steamed rice at one meal so that I can make this a day or 2 later. It is best to use rice that has been chilled overnight as others recommended. My kids don't like the scallions, so I just remove their servings before adding them to the wok in the last step. I also add some frozen peas/corn because it makes me feel better about eating it. There was plenty of flavour as the recipe stands but my leftover pork tenderloin was marinated.

This might be one of the best things i've ever made. the recipe is DEFINITELY my new favorite... I won't even take it down from where I taped it up on my cabinets the night I made it! I bought some ribs from my grocery store deli and used those, keeping the sauce that was on them. A true gourmand might think that the flavors were too strong or fought each other... but as for me, I can tell you the only fighting was between me and my husband to see who could eat more first. And all that rice for just 1/3 c. of oil??? I always felt like fried rice would be way greasier. Off to try it with a rotisserie chicken... I'm addicted.

Disclaimer: I did vary from the recipe by adding the uncooked eggs after the rice-frying stage, because I thought I would prefer the dish that way rather than with bits of oil fried egg. I also used mostly bacon fat instead of plain oil. I think the egg thing was bad, the bacon fat was good in terms of adding benefits to the recipe. This recipe came out very bland for me. All good ingredients, to be sure. I was unsure about the vinegar but it came out nicely. If I had stopped after the step adding the sauce, I probably would have been quite happy. I used day-old rice which it seems is generally recommended, to get it a little drier so you don't end up with mush. But, between the egg and the amount of rice in my pan there really wasn't any frying of rice going on. And definitely not enough flavor to cover all of that bulk. This was nothing like any pork-fried rice I've ever ordered, although it came out edible as perhaps a side. This recipe has inspired to me to experiment with just the rice and oil so that I learn what I need to do to get the rice the way I like it--some crunchy/toasted bits, maybe more than some. And I have to figure out how to get more oomph into it.

This recipe is great exactly as written. However, we always add more ginger as a personal preference.

I have been fortunate to eat at Kylie's restaurant in Sydney called Billy Kwong. This is a fantastic recipe and I make it all the time exactly how it is written except I add what ever vegetables that are in the fridge

The flavours in this recipe are perfectly balanced and wonderfully delicious - I wouldn't change a thing. However, I made the egregious error of substituting with brown rice and frankly, it was just a gloppy mess. Stick to the white rice and this will be your go-to fried rice recipe.

This is an excellent, easy, flavorful dish that my picky little one devoured. It would also be good with chicken or shrimp and perhaps additional veggies.

Very good, very clean, not greasy. I used leftover roast pork which had been marinated in a soy sauce/white wine/apricot jam marinade. I added shiitake mushrooms and peas to the beginning of the cooking. Only one thing, I agree that it needed a little more kick, more flavor, so I added some garlic and scallions and pepper.

Terrific recipe with great flavor; no need to order take-out anymore when I saw how quick & easy it is to make.

A good fried rice recipe but a little on the bland side. I added about 4tbsp of minced garlic, 1/4 cup of soy sauce(not light), and about 2tbsp of thai chili sauce which I stir fried into the oniions and the pork. After tweaking the recipe it was very good. I would make this again with my adjustments.

I love Chinese and this is the best fried rice I have ever had. Even my 9 year old daughter who hates rice liked this. my 8 year old and I both had thirds. Fast and easy to make.

My family loved this one, including my 5 year old. I had to make some pantry substitutions (used plum sauce for hoisin and so skipped the sugar, cider vinegar for malt), and added cooked shrimp. Fast and easy dinner.

This is a great recipe. So delicious it really tastes like it came from a Chinese restaurant - only less greasy! A great way to use leftovers too. This is going on my Regulars list.

Yummy; although I thought it was a little sweet so next time I'll start with 1 tspn sugar since the hoisin sauce is also sweet. I used leftover rotisserie chicken, cubed Hillshire smoked sausage for color, one finely minced garlic clove and a bag of frozen mixed veggies (peas/carrots and corn). I didn't have any malt vinegar so I used a little over 1/4 tspn of regular white vinegar and added white ground pepper.

This was delicious and easy. A great use for leftover pork roast. I didn't have malt vinegar but used apple cider vinegar and it was still great.
