I love this recipe. I started using it to replace the breakfast bars my children were taking with them to school. I wanted something more wholesome but they don't eat when they first get up so it needed to be transportable. I have found that you can use almost any kind of whole grain cereal, not just puffed types. And for the fruits and nuts, I use whatever I want to, just being sure to have a cup and a quarter total. I use a large sheet of tin foil, butter it rather than using the spray, and then line the pan with it. As the others mentioned, I press the mixture before baking and also after baking. I let it cool in the pan, then remove it using the foil and turn it out on a cutting board to cut into bars. No mess in the pan, no trouble getting it out, it works very well. Oh, and it only takes me about 10 minutes of prep to make these each Sunday for the entire week.

These were delicious and easy to make. Next time I will definitely add some different dried fruits and nuts to mix it up and will mash them down waaaaay more. They crumbled a bit when cut so I put them in the fridge overnight and this really helped to set them. YUM!

So good and easy! I took another reviewer's advice and replaced the corn syrup w/ half banana and half maple syrup. I found plain puffed wheat cereal all tucked away from the sugary cereals in the grocery store, but I think anything similar would work great. This will be my go-to trail mix bar recipe from now on.

I loved this recipe. I doubled it when I made it. I also changed a few ingredients. I cut the corn syrup in half and used a mashed banana instead. I also mixed up the cereal. I included rolled oats and some Honey Bunches of Oats with the Kashi. *You have to be sure to monitor the burner with the peanut butter mixture. It will burn easily.

These are very good, even better than some of the granola bars i usually by. They are also incredibly easy to make! I substituted rice syrup for corn syrup, and it worked perfectly.

Really satisfying. I brought these to a track practice for Team In Training (Leukemia Society) and they got great reviews. Based on other reviews I added a bit more p.b. and a touch of maple syrup, other than that made as written except used a glass 10 x 6 pan. Baked for a bit longer and reduced temp to 325 half way through. I lightly buttered pan (no spray) and used parchment on my hand to compact it before baking. Upon rmvg from oven I smashed down with spatula..no crumbling problem. The tart cherries make it. One comment "tastes like a PB&J sandwich. WIll make again.

I just saw another reviewer complaining about the crumbliness of these bars - mine held together better than a commercial granola bar, even after several days bouncing around in my backpack. I'm wondering if people aren't mashing them down enough both before and after baking? Also, I've wrapped mine up individually after taking them out of the pan and that might help them stick together better. Just a couple of thoughts.

These were excellent! I made them for a 6-day deer hunt that involved a lot of hiking with heavy backpacks and they worked great as portable breakfasts and lunches! they also kept well for about 10 days (I made 4 batches). I used generic puffed rice cereal (cheaper than Kashi) and a combo of almond and peanut butter. I've substituted all kinds of different dried fruits and nuts - I think the cherries should be the once constant since they have such a great taste. I've also used different kinds of chopped nuts - and they have been great every time. I've subbed agave syrup and added some prickly pear syrup with the honey. You must press them down (with a cooking-spray-coated hand) before putting them in the oven and I mash them down with a spatula as soon as they come out. I only bake them abt 5-7 mins and allow them to cool completely. I had no issues with crumbling and everyone loved them - guess what everyone's getting in their Christmas baskets this year?!

Did a little bit of subbing out of things-- rolled oats instead of Kashi, and apple preserves instead of corn syrup. Still turned out very good, if a little crumbly and sweet I don't know how to fix the crumbly without increasing the sweet, and vice-versa, so I'll probably leave well enough alone on the proportions of syrup:cereal. Will definitely make again, in different variations.

Rating: 3
Oh I also used Agave instead of the honey as I didn't have any on hand but will try it with honey the next time to see how the flavor is.

Loved this recipe... I adjusted it to be gluten/peanut/corn free using puffed rice & puffed millet, Sunbutter & brown rice syrup. It turned out delicious and my 10 year old son thought so as well. Next time I will probably double the fruit & nuts.

I want to make this receipe, sounds great, but hate honey, can anyone tell me what to sub for that ingredient? Thanks!

Pretty good! Keep the proportions of grain to fruit to syrup the same and you should be good to go with any combo. I made mine with Kashi GO LEAN and generic puffed rice, cashews, craisins and dried blueberries and chocolate morsels. I also accidentally did 1/3 cup honey and corn syrup, but wasn't terrible. Just more "candy" than I had planned on, and less healthy.

. I was scared about a potential pan mess after I saw how sticky the syrup got in the saucepan, but once baked and cooled the bars came out very easily.

Excellent! Tasty and lightweight. These were our breakfasts on our 7-day backpack up to Mt Whitney. Of course, when you're out there, almost everything tastes delicious!

I found this recipe just okay, edible, good, but not "oh wow, that's good". I believe it would be better without the puffed cereal, so next time I make this it will just be a variety of nuts and dried fruits. I also used brown rice syrup and almond butter as substitutes. I also added sunflower seeds, dried figs, cashews, a little coconut, etc. The recipe gives the option for a lot of versatility, so put in what you like. The cooking spray worked fine, didn't need parchment paper.

Motivated by a new resolution to eliminate super-processed packaged food from my diet, and also by an addiction to granola bars, I decided to give these a try. They are awesome -- I followed the recipe except for a change from corn to brown rice syrup, and the bars had no problem sticking together, were very filling, and also not too sweet and cookie-like. A good tip is to oil your hands before pressing the bars down -- that way the mixture won't stick to your hands and you can really compactify it effectively.

I love this recipe! I made a number of substitutions: cashew butter instead of peanut, almonds instead of walnuts, brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup, and I added about 1/4 cup chocolate chips. It is SO easy to change and make additions or substitutions to vary it up a bit! Also, I lined my pan with parchment, which worked great. I don't think I would've been able to get them out of the pan otherwise.

Okay, these are the changes I made: maple syrup instead of corn, almond butter instead of peanut, and a combination of dried prunes, golden raisins, blueberries and cranberries instead of the fruit listed. It turned out well--about as good as I expected. I'll probably make them again.

These are great! I added a bit more peanut butter and honey, substituted brown rice syrup for the corn syrup, baked them for 5 minutes instead of 10, and pressed them down again while they were still warm. I used sunflower seeds and peanuts, plus raisins and cherries. They stick together perfectly - and taste AMAZING!

I made these last week after I decided to swear off store-bought snacks for a while. I thought they were really tasty, perfect (for me) for work when I needed a boost. I added a little more pb like an earlier reviewer suggested, and I cooked the pb/syrup mix a little longer, thinking that it might help with the crumble-factor. Worked quite well, also used sunflower seeds instead of walnuts. Thought: what about using an egg with the mix to hold it together better? Just a suggestion for those having trouble--I'm not sure how it would work...

These were great! I substituted maple syrup instead of corn, and used the honey puffed kashi, and had no problems with them sticking together. My kids and husband loved them.

This worked out really well for me and I will definitely make it again. I work early in the morning so I take one or two of these with me so I can sleep a few extra minutes and still get a filling breakfast.

Since I apparently can't read I put in canola oil instead of corn syrup. That being said, I have a really good granola-ish concoction that it the perfect breakfast over yogurt and a lot more tasty than the granola with protein powder I've been making but just as filling. I also used soynuts instead of walnuts.

EXCELLENT!! It's just so delicious.... not too sweet. And knowing that it's a healthy version makes it even more delicious, and guilt-free eating it. Unlike some of the cooks, it holds together perfectly. I just substituted the peanut butter with almond butter, and I didn't change the proportions of any ingredients. For the nuts, instead of walnuts, I used 1/4 cup pumpkins seeds and 1/4 cup roughly chopped raw almonds, as for the dry fruit, I used 1/2 cup chopped pitted dates and 1/4 cup dried cranberries. And for the cereal, I used 2 1/2 cup of puffed Kashi, plus 1/2 cup of graham cereal slightly cracked. It's really yummy!! Perfect. I'll definitely make it again and again.

I made these this weekend. Everyone who tried them loved them. I substituted brown rice syrup for the corn syrup. They were very easy to make and held together very well. Much tastier than the commercial ones we usually get. I look forward to varying the fruits/nuts.

Rating: 1
I was really not impressed at all with these. The recipe made the Kashi taste stale (brand new box), and the flavors were just kind of bland. Plus, as others have found, it didn't stick together, no matter how firmly I pressed it into the pan before baking. I followed the recipe very closely, so I don't think I did anything wrong; it's just not that good.

I made these as a Christmas gift for my trainer at the gym. I used brown rice syrup as recommended by an earlier reviewer, along with almonds instead of walnuts. What a healthy treat! Mine did stick together this time; we'll see what happens next time I give them a try. I do look forward to experimenting with the different combinations of nuts, fruits, grains and chocolate chips.

Wayyy, better than what you purchase in the stores & so easy to make. My only gripe, is that they don't stick together. In light of that, they don't last long in the house. As one reviewer had mentioned, even the crumbs are consumed. I cut the dates (don't like them much) & added dried blueberries, oatmeal, & chopped almonds. I doubled up on the peanut butter and it came out delicious. Will definitely make again. A great snack for breakfast, while on the way to work or just fighting off hunger pains before lunch or dinner.

I liked this recipe because it's sugarfree, but I don't like peanut butter. Can I use almond or hazelnut paste for it? Maybe adding some real chopped nuts would be great too.

These are my new favorite snack. I modified the nuts and dried fruit, using what I had on hand. These are super.

Loved this recipe. I am always on the go with sports and these make a quick snack or meal. Yes, I have tried replacing maple surup for the corn surup. It doesn't stick together the same as with corn surup but it is well worth it for the flavor and the health of it. Also I liked follow the adjustments of the cook for CA, below this. Only change I made was not to use the chocolate chips.

Sorry, but I thought these bars were awful. My children didn't like them either. I ended up throwing them away, something I rarely do.

I really like these bars. I've made them many times. I've added different nuts/flax seeds/ wheat germ, etc. and they were always very tasty. Only one time did I have the problem of them not sticking together. But I think it was because I did not press them together enough. Has anyone tried substituting maple syrup or honey instead of the corn syrup?

My mom made this recipe three times already. Each time changing the recipe as I had suggested: used HONEY puffed Kashi instead of the plain puffed Kashi; 1/4 cups chopped almonds or pecans, toasted; 1/4 cup roasted and salted sunflower seeds; 1/4 cup chopped dried apricots instead of dates; 1/4 cup cranraisins instead of raisins; 1/4 cup dried cherries, cut up to smaller pieces; 1/4 TEASPOON KOSHER SALT; and after mixing the everything together, let mixture cool for about 2 minutes and quickly stir in 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips. Then bake, cool completely, and remove from pan and cut up into 18 pieces. It is delicious the way the recipe is written, but tasted so much better after the modification!

This is excellent, I made them today and they will be a nice snack for either morning or evening. I think I will add more peanut butter but other than that it was great - and quick and easy to make!

I doubled the recipe using Kashi puffed and substituted more raisins and craisins for the dates. The bars were a huge 'hit' with mu husband and teenage son. I am getting ready to make another batch this evening. I can't keep enough of them in the house.

Great, healthy snack, and much tastier than store-bought sports bars. I don't care much for dates and raisins, so I used dried blueberries and extra cherries instead, with great results. The bars did fall apart slightly when I took them out of the pan, but after a day in an airtight bag they seemed to be holding their shape better.

This is better than any store-bought bar I've had. I used peanuts instead of walnuts and doubled the cherries instead of using dates (the cherries are SO good!). I used puffed millet and puffed rice, which worked well.

Good, and even pretty filling, if you give it a minute and drink water with the bar. Next time I will use more walnuts and cherries (the cherry flavor is the best part in my opinion).

I doubled this recipe and used a 9" x 13" pan. It was crumbly and didn't hold together well even though it was very firmly pressed into the pan. It tasted great and disappeared out of the pan, crumbs and all in no time flat. Next time I make it, I think a little more honey and peanut butter would help hold it together. I used chunky peanut butter for extra crunch.

Have made this recipe twice to take on ski trips and everyone loves it. Delicious and they have stayed together quiet well. Will make it again.

These were OK. I added cinnamon to the honey/pb/corn syrup mixture. I'll see what others think before I make them again. They really need to be pressed down firmly in the pan to make them stay together.

Excellent! I used soy butter in place of peanut butter for a "woman's bar" and it is fantastic!

Yum! I used honey puffed wheat and baked the whole thing in a pizza pan. The peanut butter seems to add a bit of extra fat grams, but undoubtedly no more than with store-bought sports bars.

These bars have a great taste and are a perfect snack. We took them skiing for the weekend and they were gone after the first day. I used dried cranberries instead of dates and raisons. Make sure you press the mixture into the pan well before baking because it will help them stay in bar form.

I made these and brought them in to the office. Everyone loved them. They disappeared off my desk in a matter of minutes. I skipped the dates, added dried cranberries and used brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup. Yum.
