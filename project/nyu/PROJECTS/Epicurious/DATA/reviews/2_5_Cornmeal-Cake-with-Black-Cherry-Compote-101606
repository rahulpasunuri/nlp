Baked this cake for my sisters birthday and was embarrassed. I had hoped for something denser - like a pound cake (hadn't read other reviews). The corn and compote flavors together were good, but the cake was disappointing. I'll find a different cake recipe and try it with the compote again.

This cake was terrible - there are not enough stabilizers to support the cake - very eggy and the heavier batter sank during baking. I was not expecting a cornbread-type cake, but I was expecting something a bit nicer than this. Went ahead and ate my strawberries and rhubarb with whipped cream and tossed the cakes.

I was glad to have the cautions of other reviewers, but once I knew what to expect, I thought the cake, with the compote, was just delicious. The texture of the cake was creamy, and the flavor just lightly sweet enough to be complimented by the cherries. With a cherry pitter, the whole dessert was also extremely easy to make.

After reading the previous comments, I almost didn't make this, but I'm glad I did. If you're expecting something with the texture of cornbread or a corn muffin, you'll be disappointed, but if you're a polenta-lover, as I am, you'll like this. I made it in a 9" Bundt pan, and it came out beautifully. I'll be eating the leftovers for breakfast rather than dessert.

Slightly more complex and sweeter version of American (southern) spoonbread. I'm not a big fan of cherries so I used a compote of figs, pears and apples, with a little bit of lavender (also put lavender in batter). This is not a cake for everyone; out of six dinner guests only the two friends from Europe liked the dessert.

My cake didn't turn out either, but the cherry compote was nice over ice cream!

The cornmeal seperated from the mixture during the baking process. I never bothered to try the compote.
