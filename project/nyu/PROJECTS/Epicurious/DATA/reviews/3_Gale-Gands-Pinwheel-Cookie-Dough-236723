I first saw this recipe on Gale Gands show on the Food Channel. Before she rolls the logs in plastic and freezes, she rolls them in sugar which presses into the outside dough and makes a lovely flavoursome crunch once cooked. I make these for gifts A LOT. Whilst they are time consuming, they are always well received and I think the sugar makes a BIG difference. Try playing with the chocolate layer. Process candy canes and add for christmas or add a berry coulis which you strained most of the juice out of. I love these cookies, pity Epicurious missed an important step!

These were a lot of work for a mediocre tasting cookie. They looked great on the plate but were just ok flavor wise.

I was really disappointed with these cookies. They are pretty bland and I'm happy I didn't give them as gifts. I really didn't find them any different than store bought.

I didn't really care for these cookies. They were rather plain for the amount of time/effort they took. I suspect they might be better if you coated them in coarse sugar before slicing, but on their own, they were just okay.

Wonderful flavor, not too sweet. Easy but a bit time-consuming to measure and roll the dough. No need to spend for parchment paper; I used waxed paper and it worked fine. Never froze the logs, just baked them straight, and they took 8 minutes in the oven. Will definitely make again.

haven't baked them yet but the rolling process was tedious for me. I found the dough was pretty hard to roll out after they were cut into slices and refrigerated. The dough would crack while I tried to roll it up into a log as well. Maybe I did something wrong? Make sure you have lots of time to wait around for the dough to refrigerate tho and for the rolling process.

Very simple for a cookie that looks rather fancy and impressive. Cutting up parchment paper models for the two recommended designated sizes helped enormously with measuring out the coordinating pieces. I want to try this with variations on the doughs: ginger lemon, etc. I love the idea of wrapping them up as gifts, but I didn't get there yet: we baked all of them!

These were good, and my kids enjoyed helping. Leave plenty of time for the rolling and construction. Not too sweet- almost like shortbread. Not a show-stopper but good.

I made them for Christmas 2006 for the first time. I loved making them, baked some for us, and gave rolls to friends (frozen, with tag, as suggested). Rolling went fine - end result was attractive - shiny neat little disks with just the right level of sweetness. Took to work where the recipe was requested by those willing to fiddle with the rolling. Will make again.
