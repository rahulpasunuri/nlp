I thought the recipe was excellent. Used 10 oz fresh strawberries and softened the already room-temperature butter for an additional 20 seconds in the microwave. Wonderful served with cheese blintzes.

Yummy. I used a food processor and followed directions exactly. No probems.

This is a great recipe. I had no trouble with clumping- my Magic Bullet mixer had it blended in a few minutes. A regular blender would take longer but if the cook who had trouble let her blender run for the full five minutes called for in the recipe, I don't see why it wouldn't turn out. I like the suggestion of using this on scones- if only I could find a decent scone around here!

I actually tried this recipe and had success. I halved the recipe using 1/2 c of butter and used Splenda instead of sugar. I used 5 oz of fresh strawberries both the butter and strawberry were at room tempature. I've been using this on oatmeal pancakes. This is good.

If you blend the butter first till it's creamy before adding the strawberries, you might be able to avoid clumping.

Did not make this but can see why the previous cook had issues. Wouldn't it just be easier to blend about a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of good strawberry preserves along with the orange zest with the butter? I would think it would be very tasty. I definitely like the idea of the strawberry butter and can just imagine it on some fresh-baked scones...yummy!

This recipe doesn't work, or at least it hasn't for me. I've let the butter come to room temp and thawed the strawberries, BUT the berries are still cold enough to keep the butter in small pieces (rather than coming together). I'll keep waiting, but in my opinion, this one is just not worth the trouble.
