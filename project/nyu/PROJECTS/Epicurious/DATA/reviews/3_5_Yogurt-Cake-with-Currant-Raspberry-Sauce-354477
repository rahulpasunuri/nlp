Wonderful, moist caked that keeps for ever. No problem using Greek yoghourt, just use 2 and make up the difference for the cup measurment with milk. I think the sauce is a bit too much and usually make it with just the icing. 1/3 of the measurement is enough to cover to top lightly and prevents it from become a sugar fest! I like the smokey flavour that good maple syryp gives the icing instead of corn syryp. Completely foolproof - fabulous recipe

This has to be the STRANGEST cake ever. Moist, yes, but so dense it was almost like rubber. What a weird texture. And what I don't get is why so many reviewers want to capture a "commercial mix"????? Anyway, the batter was delicious and I couldn't wait to taste it, but baked it was totally tasteless. And mine sunk as someone else's did. Sauce: good. Icing: boring sweet icing. Cake: don't bother; make something else.

One of the moistest cakes I've ever tasted! A few substitutions: I used nonfat vanilla yogurt (and therefore only used 1.25 cups of sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla), and because I didn't have any currants or raspberries, I used 1.5 cups of cherries and 1.5 cups blueberries (and reduced the sugar to 0.33 cups), which ended up being more than enough drizzle. Using 2 8x8 square pans meant that I needed to have a filling, and deciding that the icing would be too much trouble, I mixed 0.5 block of cream cheese with a few tablespoons of the drizzle. It made a really pretty glue for the two cakes.

this cake was verrrry good! it was moist but not too heavy and the icing was very fun. I however added lemon juice and zest to the batter as well as some zest and juice to the icing to make it taste better as I did not spend time making the rasberyy sauce. My sister made this for an auction and people went crazy for it! Definatly a winner!

This cake is exceptional! For years, I'd been searching for a yellow cake recipe with the moistness of a cake mix, but the good-quality ingredients and fresh taste of a cake from scratch. This cake was the answer. I made the cake recipe exactly as written, except I substituted canola oil for 1/3 of the butter, to add more moistness. The cake came out just perfectly. It even satisfied my husband, who generally only likes boxed-mix or grocery store cakes!! This will now be my go-to yellow cake recipe--so glad I found it!

An easy to make moist, light and delicious cake. What could be better! I made a few adjustments - cut the butter to 1 1/2 sticks, subbed in 1/2 cup of brown sugar with the white sugar, used low-fat vanilla yogurt because that's what I had on hand (and because of that I didn't add any vanilla), and added a bit more yogurt to make up for cutting back the butter. Also, I baked this in a bundt pan (not a fan of sheet cakes) but it baked for the exact same time. The result was a wonderfully delicious cake. I think you could cut more butter too, if trying to be health conscious. I didn't use this sauce recipe, but the Raspberry Sauce recipe from Parade July 2002, and didn't have time to make the icing so I just served the cake warm with vanilla ice cream and the sauce. Rave reviews. Will DEFINITELY make again, perhaps as a two layer cake next time.

This cake was delicious, tangy, and stayed moist and fresh-tasting for four days (after that it was all gone!). I agree with other reviewers that the icing was a bit sweet; next time I will replace it with just a dusting of icing sugar.

This is a very good cake! I followed all the directions exactly, including the beautiful sauce. I'll definitely make it again, but I had two issues. The first is, overall I think my cake fell a bit - slowly - when I took it out of the oven. I suspect that my oven temperature may be running slightly cool - I wonder if that could cause the cake to fall? If anyone has experience with that, I'd appreciate advice. It definitely was not as tall in the end as the picture. However, it tasted really, really good. Secondly, next time I make this I won't try to platter it up and drip the frosting like in the picture in the magazine. Because, I don't have a rectangular platter large enough for this cake so ended up using an appropriately sized cookie sheet. I thought it would be OK because the cake itself would be so beautiful - but the cake wasn't beautiful. The frosting, while totally delicious, was not as pillowy and lovely as the photo - it looks like cream-colored frosting and "settles" on the cake after about half an hour, with a few ripples and wrinkles. I'm an artistic person, usually very good at presentation and cake frosting, but in all honesty this cake looked sort of sad when I tried to imitate the picture. So, next time I'd consider simply icing the cake in a 9x13 pyrex pan and let it be what it is: a really simple, delicious cake; comfort food at its best!

Very dense and lacking in flavor. Sauce was waaay too much trouble for the end result. White frosting needs more color. Used Wyman's frozen raspberries for the sauce and fresh for garnish. Using red food coloring I made a pattern in the white frosting which tickled the tastebuds for raspberry.Might be better to bake in round cake pans, frost the entire cake and fill with raspberry filling. Maybe in 3 layers.

This is going on the go-to cupcake or birthday cake list! So good. The icing is slightly too sweet for me to enjoy the yogurty tang of the cake, but good for other purposes and the cake is so moist with a great crumb, still fabulous on day two and I'm not sure how much longer it's going to be around. A must-bake!!

This cake is a rock star!!! Moist, fluffy, buttery, unreal! I have never even gotten to the icing, sauce part of the program because the cake is sooo good on its own.

I am a baker and this is the cake. I have made it 3 times and have never heard so many "yum, make it again" requests from friends and family. Absolutely a winner.

This cake was very moist and very delicious. And if that wasn't enough, the sauce was truly to die for and re-usable on fresh fruit, ice cream or whatever!

It was okay like 1 fork indicates. I ate it but I won't make it again. The cake was dense and heavy. I like fluffy light cake like you usually get when using a commercial cake mix.

Fabulous! I have made this twice in one week and am sure to make it again soon. The second time I decided it would be prettier in a fluted bundt pan...not a good idea! The consistency doesn't want to be supported in a deep pan.(it is good but dense and pudding like) Maybe cupcakes would work, but I believe the sheet cake pan is it for me next time. Delicious, easy and just as good without sauce or icing!

This cake was to die for--a co-worker made this cake for a shower at work and it was delicious. It was very moist and had a nice buttery flavor. You can definitely eat this without the icing and just the sauce. Very good.

I love love love this cake. Baked it on the longer end -- the timer went wiggy so I don't really know, but I know I baked it over the minimum and the cake still rocked. It's incredibly moist (a lot of yogurt). Other than the weird cooking-time, I followed the directions exactly (yogurt at room temp, etc.)--and doing so takes some time. But worth it. We have no red currants in local markets right now so I used all raspberry for the sauce. The sauce on its own is magic--I'll totally use it for other things...like toothpaste, it's so good. Everyone had 2d helpings. Then, a couple nights later it was still soooo good in the fridge. I think I'm making it again tomorrow.

This cake was easy to make and delicious. It was perfect for a summer dessert with friends. Everyone loved it. The frosting was especially simple to make. Most ingredients were things I already had in the house as well, besides a few.
