This makes a generous amount and I nearly ate it all by myself. I respectfully disagree with the reviewer who said it lacks flavor. I didn't alter the recipe a bit and it was rich and creamy and flavorful. This really does have the mouth feel of risotto.

This recipe is bland and needs something for flavor. Bacon was the highlight and extra cheese.

I added 4 additional cloves of garlic, omitted the bacon, and made 1.5 portion of the recipe. I didn't have low-sodium chicken broth on hand and wished I had. Even with the extra bulgur and water, it was a bit salty for me with the standard broth. Fast, easy, looks a bit like gruel but very tasty. A keeper. I'll definitely make again, maybe with some toasted pine-nuts or sauteed tomatoes.

I used all broth and no water but I would substitute low-sodium chicken broth next time. My husband and I had this as a main course and thought it was terrific! Will definitely make it again.

Didn't expect much, but a very nice marriage of flavors. I substituted more broth for the water, so didn't add salt. Comfort rather than company food. Also: yum.

I made this because I had the ingredients. It is more filling than I expected and a bit too rich to be a main course. It would go well with chicken...

A wonderful, hearty dish that satisfies both the young and refined appetite; A dish to warm the body and raise the spirits in Quebec winter. I substitued grated ricotta (often tricky to find, but well worth it), since the bacon provides enough salty taste.
