I have made this 3 times since Thanksgiving because I just love it. Not being a fan of apples, I gravitate towards recipes that use pears. This was a great fit. The sweetness of the pears with the sharp tartness of the cranberries was perfect. We used vanilla ice cream, really married well with the pears and cranberries. One thing about this recipe that I didn't like - the beginnig of the recipe calls for 3/4 cup sugar. I put it all in the fruit and not in the topping (as it states later). Luckily for me, it turned out fine. So the recipe is forgiving. And it also allows for creativity. I added ginger and additional cinnamon to both the filling and the topping, 1/2 tsp. vanilla to filling and topping and a 1/4 tsp. salt to both as well. Recipe didn't call for salt, but I always add some salt to sweet dishes. Yes, I will make this again, in fact, I can't wait.

I made the crisp and cinnamon ice cream for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. The flavors and textures of everything went together so well (sweet, tart, crisp, crunch, melty, cinnamon, cream...). Yum. I made it exactly as the recipe says and wouldn't change a thing.

I agree with the previous posters, needs a little more sugar to make it a little sweeter (unless you like more tart). I also used Splenda brown sugar along with regular white sugar and no one could tell. (The Splenda brown is great bc it never hardens). Biggest thing to change though is to jack up the heat to 425. It needs the high heat to make the crust crunchy.

This was a great recipe and really easy to make. The cinnamon ice cream was a good match. I will make this again many times im sure.

Very delicious, my new standby recipe for a crisp. I made once as written, and added a bit of extra sugar to the topping and fruit the next time. I prefer it with the extra sugar.

I had a pear crisp at The Little Owl in Chelsea, New York and was amazed how amazing it was. I then looked up a pear crisp recipe and found this one. I found the crisp to be great here as well although I know it must have had a quarter of as much butter. I changed the ice cream to a mascarpone gellato to mimmic the crisp I had at the little owl and to say it was a hit would be an understatement. 4 Forks

Amazing! Love, loved this recipe. Extremely easy to make. What I liked most about it was that it was light, but wonderfully delicious. I'm not an extremely experienced cook, and I'm not sure how you can go wrong with this.

It was too, too, too sweet. Couldn't taste the pears at all.

This is a keeper! I followed the advice of the person who said to use a little more sugar with the fruit, because I too was worried about the cranberries being too tart. If you have the time, and a decent machine absolutely DO make the cinnamon ice cream. I added a couple more cinnamon sticks and the flavor is faboo!

Fool-proof, fast, and wonderful. Made it for Thanksgiving at my mother-in-law's and it was the star dessert. I almost felt guilty for showing up her cakes and pies with something that took almost no time to prepare.

This is a simple and tasty dessert. My grandfather, who rarely likes any kind of dessert, practically demanded I make this again for Christmas. The cinnamon ice cream adds something a little bit more exciting and unexpected than the usual vanilla. I did not make the ice cream but instead bought it from Whole Foods.

I cut the sugar in the toppping b/c I don't like super-sweet desserts and shouldn't have --the cranberries make the filling quite tart...I would definitely make again, just following the recipe as written, maybe even upping the sugar that the pear/cran gets tossed with.

I've made this three times over the Thanksgiving holidays. YUM! My pears were very, very juicy, and so on the second and third times, I used a little cornstarch. Definately helped. And since I used a deeper pan, I need to cook mine a little longer to be sure that the juices thickened. I didn't make the ice cream, in spite of my best intentions, so just added a little cinnamon to fresh whipped cream.

Worked just as well with dulce de leche ice cream spinkled with cinnamon. I couldn't find cinnamon ice cream or gelato.

Fabulous Recipe!! I even had to use unripe pears and it turned out great! The leftovers had trouble staying in the refrigerator! I even made the cinnamon ice cream which is really more of a custard and it was heavenly. A definite must...could use any fruit with it but the cranberries are a great tart flavor with the other fruit.

so good and so easy. Nice alternative to apple pie and very festive for the holidays. This year I will use vanilla ice cream and five spice whipped cream-1/2 cup whipping cream, 1tbsp honey, 1tsp asian 5 spice. Doesn't it sound yummy?! This is sure to be a hit!

We thought this recipe was wonderful. I did stir in 2 tablespoons of corn starch to the pear/berry mixture while it rested and it helped with the abundant juices the pears produced. I also made the cinnamon ice cream, only I halved this recipe (wasn't sure we'd like it) and used ground rather than stick cinnamon (no more than 1 teaspoon, depending on your taste). The ice cream contributed to the wonderful burst of varying flavors in this recipe. Now, I do have a Pyrex dish about the size recommended and it fit very well. Just be careful not to use too big a dish or I would presume this might end up too dry and flat.

I made this as written, except I halved the recipe and used a smaller square dish. We thought it was delicious. The topping would also be good with apples.

This was very simple and delicious! Will definitley make again. The only complaint is the size of the pan the recipe calls for. Who has a pan that size? I used a square pan and the topping ended up being too much. Next time i won't overload it with the topping.

This recipe is delicious--I made it as one of our desserts this Thanksgiving, and it was a favorite! I served it with vanilla ice cream instead of cinnamon, and it was wonderful. Be sure to either use salted butter in the crumb mixture or add a pinch of salt--otherwise it tastes a bit flat. Nevertheless, it was fabulous! A definite addition to our yearly Thanksgiving feast.
