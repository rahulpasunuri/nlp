Unbelievably fantastic! I didn't make nearly enough for my party. Salad spinning the shredded potato was genius idea. I made exactly as directed except I couldn't find sturgeon caviar so used paddlefish caviar which was delicious. Next time think I will add a little smoked salmon too. (And next time will be like, tomorrow.)

Good basic potato pancake recipe - even minus the caviar. Today I made it as an appetizer to serve with chipolte sour cream before a chili dinner. I grate the potatoes in the food processor, which makes the grating larger so you can rinse & spin them in your salad spinner; much cleaner and easier than the towel twisting method.

A great basic potato pancake recipe. Tonight I added grated celeriac  because I had it in the fridge  smoked sea salt and ground pepper to the pancake mixture. I also reduced the amount of oil required to only 1 t of grapeseed oil by cooking the pancakes in a no-stick ceramic pan. Since I didn't have any creme fraiche or caviar in the house I made a topping of ricotta cheese, pink peppercorns and grated sharp cheddar cheese. What a sublime combo and so easy to make.

I always shied away from making my own potato pancakes thinking it was complicated. I was pleasantly surprised. I followed the last reviewers advise and used Russets since that is what I had on hand and just squeezed them real good in kitchen cloth to release all the water. I brought them to a New Years Party last week and served a choice of sour cream, applesauce or carmelized onions on the side for topping. They were the first thing gone from the buffet table.

I love this recipe. I originally used this from my Bon Appetit mag when it came out. It's always a hit at dinner parties. I'll make this recipe over & over. I recommend yukon or yellow potatoes: they're the creamiest.

I have been looking for a potato pancake recipe like my Polish Nana made for years...this one it the tops! Not only is it easy, it's elegant and goes over great every time. The creme fraiche can be substitured with Sour Cream if you can't find it but the caviar and onions just put it right over the top. Great appetizer!!!!

You can substitute Idaho "bakers" for the Yukon Golds: remember to squeeze most of the starch and liquid out of the shredded potatoes(Use a very clean, thin kithen towel to shred the potaoes on to, pull up the corners of the towel and twist firmly). I've made this before as a Kosher food and added Copper River cold smoked salmon, which bumps this dish up to 3 1/2 forks for me. Sooo simple, yet so amazing.
