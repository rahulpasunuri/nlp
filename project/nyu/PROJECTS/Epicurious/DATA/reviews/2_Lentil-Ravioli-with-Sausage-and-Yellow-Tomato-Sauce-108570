This dish is wonderful and so simple yet seems complicated and gourmet. Perfect for entertaining or a week day meal.

After years of reading reviews on this site, I'm finally compelled to write one. This was highly disappointing given the amount of time to prepare. Flavors good, but nothing special. Wouldn't make it again.

To the cook from Toronto, you know putting your 2 cents in here is worse then the other 2 talking about a beverage that goes good with this recipe. If you don't like what they or I have to say maybe you should make this recipe and then leave a comment.

NO Reviews but just running chat. Although I understand the need for clarification on some recipes, they should be directed to another section and Epicurious should start a chat-room for curious cooks. I prefer to use this site as it was intended - REVIEWS from those of us who have taken the time to make the selection!! My apologies for the hypocrisy of this note . . but enough, already.

With the spice in this recipe, I think a nice cold microbrew beer would be great. It is the first thing that came to my mind.
