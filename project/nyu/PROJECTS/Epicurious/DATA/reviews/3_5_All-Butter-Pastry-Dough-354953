What's not to love - it's a simple pastry dough. It comes out perfect every time, and I'll trade butter for the "blue can" of partially hydrogenated oils any day. Like any baking recipe - go by the letter on the recipe and it makes a great, tasty, flaky crust. It may not be as tender as some made w/ shortening, but that's an easy trade off for me... and come on - it's 4 ingredients!

It took me my second time making this to get this perfect. I found that I needed considerably more ice water (added it slowly to not over do it). This may have been because I doubled the recipe? And I cooked it less time then stated. Was easy to make with just my fingers - no fancy mixer required. A lovely crust and very easy.

Although I used a prepared pie crust (Marie Callendar), I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It was good, but the flavor seemed pretty "one note" to me. I feel like it needs additional ingredients to add some layers of flavor.

This recipe takes me back to my grandmother's kitchen. Her pie crusts were the best I have ever had. This is how she made them. What I remember is how fast her hands put the crust together (in less than a minute it was done). One of the reason's her pies were so wonderful is that she did not overwork the dough - the other was the use of all butter.

I've made this crust exactly as written many times. It's the BEST crust I've ever tasted. It's easy to handle, rolls out beautifully and the finished crust is so flakey you can almost peel back the layers. The technique of smearing the dough is French and is called fraisage. As long as you leave plenty of pea size lumps of butter in the flour, it will produce the lightest, flakiest pastry. You must try this!
