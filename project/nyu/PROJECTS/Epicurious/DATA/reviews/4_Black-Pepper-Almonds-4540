I loved these! They were a big hit at my party last night. I probably only used half the pepper mixture(I got scared as I was adding it!)and they were great but they could have used just a bit more:)

I make them every Christmas and although I make four batches, I never seem to have enough!

Ugh!!! One thing about making this recipe is that it's SO hard to NOT eat all of them. The pepper and brown sugar and salt were amazing together. I am definitely making this recipe again in the future.

Pretty darn tasty - basically a candied almond with pepper. A little boring compared with some nuts I have had. Also, very sweet (in a good way). Better as a party nibble than as part of a cheese and olive tray (people commented that they should be over with the dessert). Still, hard to stop eating the little buggers. Used almonds with skin, as thats what I had.

I have made these every Christmas for years and love them (only make them at Christmas because they are too good!) This year was the first time I have ever had greasy almonds. My oven didn't heat well and so it took a really long time to cook. I stirred the top cookie sheet every 5 min and didn't touch the bottom sheet. Sure enough, the grease separated out of the top batch and not the bottom. So don't stir too much.

I followed Todd's tips, and added scant 1/4 tsp chipotle chili powder for added kick and and a subtle smoky flavor.

Excellent. Better the second day. Adding additional almonds would be a good idea --- it's a little soupy while baking but the almonds eventually soak it up.

Rating: 2
I made these following Todd's suggestions, but ended up with lots of sugary coating in the pan and not too much on the nuts. Is this what others experienced or would having the oven temp too low cause this?

Have made several times now, it just gets better every time. Thank god for Epicurious and all you brilliant, intrepid chefs who come before me... according to notes, I use 3 full cups of almonds, skin-on (who cares?), and this last batch I actually used half pecans, half almonds, as well as some cayenne in with the salt and pepper. Mix with dried cranberries, cherries, blueberries (whatever I have on hand) and it's the best bite. I packaged up little baggies of this mix and mailed them out for valentine's day, along with the caramel-chocolate truffles with fleur de sel (also on this site). I have lots of new friends now...

The almonds were fine, but weren't devoured until we mixed them with dried cranberries. That combination was addictive.

I've made these a few times and they're always a hit; however, next time I'm going to try Vancouver cook's suggestions since I've had them come out too sticky sometimes, too. One change/addition I've added that I like: I add powdered ginger to taste. It adds a nice little kick that bridges the spicy-savory/sweet elements well.

This is my new signature recipe, it is THAT good. I make it with regular unblanched almonds and grind the pepper in a spice grinder. People love them, and I have gotten asked for the recipe many times. It is my favorite recipe from epicurious.

These turned out perfectly. I followed the tips of the reviewer from Vancouver and had no trouble with nuts sticking together. The only change I'd make next time would be to add a bit more salt and pepper.

Being a caterer and a nut lover (my family/friends jokingly call me "that nutty cook"!), I have been making a wide variety of specialty nuts for many years - sweet, savoury, spicy and everything in between. This is one of the best spiced almond recipes I have ever made! However, I did make some much needed changes! In reading the recipe, method and reviews prior to making, and based on my past cooking experience, I think there are a couple of problems in this recipe that may account for some of the more negative reviews. I respectfully offer these suggestions/comments for your consideration: 1) Increase the almonds to a generous/rounded 3 cups. As written, the proportion of brown sugar to nuts is too high. The excess sugar coupled with too hot an oven results in too much syrup/glaze that floods the pan, cooks to the hard stage and binds the nuts together like candy (as in brittle as others have reported) rather than coating them individually as I think this recipe intends. By increasing the almonds, the coating should become drier, duller and somewhat granular in texture as it bakes rather than remaining shiny and sticky/gooey. When fully cooled each nut should be separate and have an irregualr but pleasingly crunchy, frosted/sugary appearance. 2) The oven temp is too high, so the coating/glaze becomes hard and brittle-like and the almonds are likely to burn. Turn your oven down to 300-325 degrees and bake for 15-18 min. 3) Gently stir 2-3 times while baking to separate the almonds and redistribute the coating that accumulates in the pan. 4) Both blanched and skin-on almonds will work well. In my experience, the skin helps to retain glazes a bit better although may not be as pleasing to the eye. Trust you find my comments helpful. I just took a batch out of the oven and they are wonderful! From one nutty cook to another: Happy nut making!

I thought this was good, but it didn't turn out like I had hoped. It was really, really sticky and so not good for snacking. It tasted good and was an interesting conbination of flavors, but it was just too sticky.

I was very pleased with how these almonds came out of the oven. I was reading the other reviews as they were baking, and I took a cook's advice in adding just a little bit of cayenne for an extra spicey edge. Many thanks for that tip!

These were just OK. I would try a different recipe next time.

I paired the nuts with champagne at a wine tasting event. It was a huge hit! Now, I am making them for holiday gifts to be given along with a bottle of nice champagne to my husband's employees (along with the recipe)!

Rating: 4
Was a little worried when these came out of the oven looking like bad brittle, but after one taste I knew I could carry it off! I just put the cooled nuts in a plastic baggie and banged the bag on the counter to break up the "brittle"...however, at my cocktail party, guests were looking for the "big pieces" so I guess the brittle effect was not a show-stopper for a lot of folks. I was asked for this recipe numerous times from a non-recipe asking crowd. One point...no one went for these until I passed them around myself...then it was no holds barred! I guess they didn't catch the eye as something unusual...just another nut dish. But the raves belied that thought!

Don't think I'll ever bother with another spiced nut recipe - these are the BEST!! So easy, and absolutely delicious. I used regular almonds with great results, and went heavy on the pepper. These will be a Christmas party tradition at our house from now on. Excellent with a high quality ale!

These nuts are fabulous! The first time we made them, we immediately started on extra batches. The recipe is straight forward and easy (although the blanching/skin removal is time consuming). I have given them as "hostess" gifts at the holidays, yum!

Something went horribly wrong. These turned into a peppery almond brittle disaster after their time in the oven. They were completely ignored by our guests - and I had made a double recipe so now the freezer is full of icky almonds I will never eat.

WOW! I have tried several 'nut recipes', and this is BY FAR the best yet. A wonderful combination of sweet and savory. I added a dash of chipotle powder for added complexity--a nice addition if you have it on hand.

The perfect Champagne partner....they're a holiday and dinner party tradition at our house. To answer the question about blanching almonds -- the skins would make a mess. But you can buy the almonds already blanched.

I love this recipe, but it's not the one I reach for when "quick and easy" is the goal. These have a tendency to get "globby" even when I work as fast as I can. If I do make these nuts I make sure I have several copies of the recipe handy -- they're that good.

Rating: 0
I am sorry to be "that" girl, but: is it really necessary to blanch the almonds? (is it the skins that burn??) and could i do this all in a cast iron pan on medium and then low heat? the recipe sounds REALLY great! (and VERY similar to one that i took the advice of other cooks on and simplified...A LOT.) did anyone else try it all in one pan?

These were a big hit at our cocktail party. People were commenting on them all evening. I would definitely make these again. I did add extra black pepper after they came out of the oven because they didn't seem "peppery" enough, and next time I would definitely double the amount of pepper from the start for more of a bite.

Having just completed another holiday season of making these spicy nuts as gifts, I figured I would add my two cents. These have become a staple at my holiday formal sitdown dinner (great with champagne, as suggested, and not too shabby with martinis!). Last year I didn't make them, and my friends missed them. So now I make them to eat and to give away as parting gifts. I also host a large cookie swap, and these are part of the menu there too! I have made these with pecans, walnuts and cashews. Really terrific all mixed up, as my son enjoys the leftovers! This is definitely a keeper. I've never had that problem this recipe being greasy, as one reviewer suggested. They are perfect every time.

I make losts of these and give small bags as gifts during the holidays and everyone loves them. But be careful not to overcook the almonds - they cook very fast when they are close to being done.

Yum. Easy and delicious. Really special nuts. I didn't have blanched almonds either, and had no problem. Loved them. I think these will become a favorite for hostess gifts, work parties, etc.

Easy, inexpensive, and delicious. I used a 1 lb bag of shelled raw almonds (about 3 cups, not blanched). The coating held just fine (no problem with humidity here in Southern California). As stated in the preface, they are great with a good Champagne.

I rated this recipe in 6/2000. After making pounds and pounds of these almonds in different cities, here's the key -- you definitely don't need blanched almonds, you definitely *do* need a day that's not humid. Humidity makes the coating fall off.

These were delicious.I put too much sugar and ended up with some candy crusts which were a surprise even for spice lovers. I would also try sprinkling the nuts with chili oil(a drizzle would do). Great little dish, also lasts long.

I don't know how that one reviewer came out with greasy almonds. I don't think that can happen with this recipe. I thought these were a very nice treat. I served them at a cocktail party at the bar. They weren't too peppery and the guests loved them. Very simple to make- yea!

Rating: 4
These are my favorite treat to make at Thanksgiving. I have not found them greasy at all, so I think maybe that reviewer made a mistake. I have made them with and without skins on the almonds, and I think they actually came out better with the skins on. I found the coating actually stuck better and they were tastier! Enjoy

Rating: 2
Perhaps I should have made 3 cups, but I followed recipe exactly. They taste ok, but so very greasy. They are now in covered containers with paper towels hoping to remove some of the grease. I have made other nuts that are spicy/sweet without all the grease, so will not remake.

I've made this recipe frequently since it appeared in 1997. They are always a hit with company! You really should, however, use blanched nuts. The coating falls when you use almonds with skins.

Glad to know that the recipe is just as good using regular almonds! Although if it is for a more special occasion, perhaps the blanched variety are more attractive in a nice dish. Not that anyone cares after the first couple of cocktails... I actually liked having extra of the brown sugar mixture; it's like candy! This is almost like broken pieces of a gourmet almond brittle.

Don't bother with blanching the almonds -- the recipe works fine without that step. Also, almond skins are fine -- the recipe still turns out delicious. I agree with a previous reviewer that the brown sugar mixture overwhelms the almonds. I don't mean it overwhelms them with flavor -- there's just too much of it, and it flakes off. Adding more almonds seems like a great idea. Otherwise, fabulous recipe for an absolutely addictive snack! Oh, and I agree that they are GREAT with champagne.

I've made this twice now and my family loves it. Both times it seems I've had too much brown sugar mixture so next time I think I'll just throw in 3 cups of almonds. Might throw in a little Cayenne too for some real punch.

I am not providing rankings because I think i made mistakes. One: couldn't find instructions on how to blanch almonds, so i just did what i could - tried steaming, but had to add to hot water to loosen skins sufficiently. Second: kept waiting for that "golden" color and overbaked the nuts. They are hard, some have black sides, and i still have some sitting out waiting for people to finish eating a week later. No loss, though: think I can chop 'em up and put on salads to finish off. I'll try to do it right next time.

I am not allowed at our traditional Thanksgiving dinner if I don't bring the peppered almonds. They also make great hostess gifts in the holiday season!

I love hot and spicy things, so I used the entire amount of black pepper called for. I treat my staff to a several-course dinner every holiday season, and I put these out several years ago. Now they ask for them every year!

I cut the black pepper in half and only used 1 1/2 teaspoons, which was plenty spicy for my family. The sweetness of the brown sugar and the salty-spice of the salt and pepper mixture create a nice balance. A great snack or appetizer.
