I used a small amount of cayenne instead of the ancho. It was delicious!

Wow, great recipe. I made modifications according to ingredients in pantry and cut the recipe to how much chocolate I wanted. Used 1 can of carnation milk (regular); 1oz of semi sweet chocolate; 1/2 tblsp of unsweetened cocoa powder; 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper but could use less (it does have a nice kick with 1/4 tsp); 1 cinnamon stick; 1/4 tsp- each nutmeg and allspice. sugar same as recipe. I really enjoyed this recipe and will pass it along to friends.

We're big fans of spiced hot chocolate around here (anything chocolate, really), and I have to say that this was wonderful! I didn't have bittersweet chocolate, so I used milk chocolate. To compensate, I added just over half the sugar that the recipe calls for (maybe 1 1/4 tbsp), and an extra 1/4 tbsp of the cocoa powder as well. I was also out of cinnamon sticks, so I sprinkled about 1/8 tsp in before removing the pot from the heat. My mother-in-law said that this was better than the infamously amazing Spicy Maya hot chocolate at our local artizan chocolate shop.
