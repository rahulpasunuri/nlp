Everyone in my book club loved the salad, we had a St.Patty's day menu. I substituted Caraway seeds for Tarragon, as I don't care for it. Quite good. Doubled the dressing and recipe, added a bag of shredded cabbage mix too. Looked beautiful.

This is a very good salad. Of course it depends on the veggies you add but BEETS are a must. I thinned the dressing with a little milk not water. I'm not sure the cheese is needed or maybe it should be shredded.

I don't understand why this got such good reviews, it's farely ordinary. The dressing was bland, and even with a lot of good-quality 'salad bar' ingredients, it was not at all memorable.

I've used this salad a dozen times since St. Patty's.. A colorful and tasty salad.

Wonderful addition to our menu featuring Irish beef and lamb stews along with soda bread and chocolate stout cake.

I don't know if I would make this salad all the time but it was great with my St Patrick's day menu. I have the left overs the next day with smoked salmon. It makes a nice dinner salad.

This is one of my favorites; I think that the dressing is delicious. I put the lettuce, washed and torn, on a large platter and top with the cheese, eggs, etc. and then drizzle the dressing over the top of the whole platter. It makes a better presentation than simply tossing everything together.

I used this as a side salad with an Irish Stew dinner and therefore it serves 6 to 8 persons. It was excellent. I omitted the hard boiled eggs and the cabbage, but otherwise used the remainder and all thought it was great. One asked me for the recipe which is always a compliment. We followed the dinner with the Irish Bread Pudding with Whiskey-Caramel Sauce from Cooking Light and it was also fantastic.

I made this for guests on St. Patrick's Day. An earlier reviewer said that he didn't think this was an authentic Irish salad. Maybe not, but it is a good salad to serve with Irish fare. It also makes a nice presentation. I used fresh tarragon in the dressing, and made it a day ahead of time. It was wonderful. I will make this again, and I won't wait until next March 17th either.

It's a basic salad, not earth-stopping, but a good and healthy supper. I added some more vinegar to the dressing because I thought that it needed an extra kick. We'll definitely make it again.

OH, ya. This rocks when you get creative and add other veggies, arrange in a bulls-eye and add a little more spicy vinegrette. I made this for 12 for a St. P's day party and it was gone, gone, gone. Believe it or not, the part folks liked best were the sliced beats! Go figure!

I have never ever in my life seen or heard of such a salad in Ireland and I have lived here all my life, its a completely made up recipe

We made this for a St. Pattys day party, figuring everyone was bringing meats and soups (we were right)... my salad was gone, and I had many compliments. I added a few other veggies like mushrooms and carrots. The dressing was suprisingly good, I would make it for other salads as well. Great festive salad for those wanting to stay on the lighter side. The Irish Cheddar made it mmm mmmm good!!!

I made this salad as part of a St Patrick's Day dinner and it suited the meal perfectly. I used all the salad bar ingredients suggested and along with the salad dressing it was a big hit. I would make it again.
