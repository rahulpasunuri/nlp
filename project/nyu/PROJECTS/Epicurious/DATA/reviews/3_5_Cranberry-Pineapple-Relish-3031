I really like this relish. I am not a big fan of cranberries, but this dish is the exception. The sweetness of the pineapple cuts the tart acidity of the cranberries and creates a lovely balance to the dish, and the tiny amount of ground cloves adds a warmth to this relish. The only variation I made was substituting pecans for walnuts (personal preference), and I lightly toasted them before adding to the dish. Very, very tasty, and my guests really liked the variation on a Thanksgiving tradition.

I have been making this for several years now and use finely chopped candied ginger instead of the cloves called for in the recipe. I tried another cranberry sauce last year and my family complained loudly - so I will be going back to this one again at Thanksgiving this year!

I absolutely love this dish. I will continue to make it, however, my holiday guests have never been too crazy about it.

I made this recipe in November of 2000 and it was a great hit. I have made it every Thanksgiving since. This year we are going to our friends home and I am bringing it to them! It is delicious and smells wonderful from the cloves.

I made this for my first time cooking Thanksgiving dinner in 2003, and it was an absolute hit! I added some fresh pineapple to the canned juice, as well as a splash of fresh squeezed orange juice and a handful of dried cranberries and everyone complimented it! This will become a staple of every thanksgiving form now on!

I love this recipe - great texture, just the right balance of sweet and tart, and the pineapple is wonderful. The only thing is that this is NOT a relish by any stretch of the imagination. It's definitely a jellied sauce, so if a relish is what you're looking for, the Cranberry Fruit Relish (also on this site, and very good) will probably be closer to the mark.

This is good and easy. Got lots of compliments on it. Even better after it sits for a day!

I took this dish to our Church Thanksgiving dinner. I went against all my rules this year and made 2 new items to take with me. Everyone loved this relish, and it was simple to make, it is going to be a number one on my list for the holidays from now on.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Absolutely a keeper. Probably could be put in a mold for beautiful presentation. Delicious! Would definitely make again.

I have made this dish for about 3 years now. It is an awesome side dish for thanksgiving and other winter dining. The pineapples give this dish a surprising twist, and the walnuts and cloves round out the texture and flavor. You may want to experiment by adding slightly more sugar or substituting the walnuts for pecans....
