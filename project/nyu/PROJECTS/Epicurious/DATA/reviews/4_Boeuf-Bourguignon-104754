I made this for the big family Christmas two years ago. It was a huge hit. Last year I did a lovely and elegant Tomato Bisque but all my family had to say was "Where's the Beef Bourguignon?" So, be careful this may be the only thing you are allowed to make for the next 20 years!

Fabulous-had never made bouef bouguignon before but had always wanted to try it-took some time but otherwise was very easy to execute...followed the recipe as written but didn't blanche the bacon just sauteed it and drained off the grease...an easy dish to make for a dinner party.

Rating: 4
Despite the time consuming elements of the recipe it is worth it! Also, there's room for substitutions.Using parsley stems, whatever Bay leaves I had, and the very decent Shiraz were all fine. The carrots disappear so may not need to be sauteed. Frozen pearl onions were quite acceptable.

I must say that neither my husband nor I were so wowed... we did use a slow cooker and the meat turned out perfectly tender (browned and saut√©ed according the recipe and then all went in the slow cooker with an extra cup of beef broth on the low setting for 9 hours). it was the sauce that didn't do much for us. if I try again I will make more of an effort to find a better wine (although we didn't use a cheap-o wine) and would also skip the broth... it was not necessary on the low setting of the slow cooker to have the extra liquid.

Delicious! Pearl onions were superfluous and undercooked when recipe followed. I would recommend substituting pearl onions entirely for the 2 chopped onions or, if you want the double set of onions, add the pearl onions to the cooking pot about 20 minutes earlier so they are softer and not so bitingly raw tasting. Also, definitely use a drinkable red, not a cheap table wine. I used a Francis Ford Coppola Pinot noir and it was great.

This is a great recipe as is. Towards the last half hour, I added 1 1/2 cups of broth and more tomato paste because i thought maybe the prominent (delicious) wine taste would be underappreciated by the resident 11 year old. I think it was a good compromise because we all loved it.

Made this for Christmas dinner this year, and there wasn't a drop left. I was cornered by two guests hoping for leftovers at the end of the night no less. Roasted the mushrooms and pearl onion to save myself some hassle and was all the happier with this final result.

I cooked this for Christmas Eve dinner. We had family coming in late that night and it was the perfect thing to serve later into the night. I wanted to make it extra special so we bought a leg of lamb instead of beef. It was sweet and delicious! The longer it sits, the better it gets. I used 5lbs of a boneless leg of lamb for 5 people. (We had leftovers, but not many!) I used bacon I had already cooked and suateed it with the carrots and 2 onions. This helped cut down on time but still had all the flavor. When browning the lamb I used bacon fat and canola oil. The canola oil stayed hot at a high temp and the bacon fat gave the lamb a lot of flavor. The only thing I would change is I would not use the cheap table red I had bought for the recip[e. It is worth bying a good wine. I added extra mushrooms and pearl onions because our family loves them. Amazing recipe and not as hard as I thought it would be!

Dear Ruth: This recipe in the Gourmet cookbook tells you to boil the bacon, but never mentions it again. The saute step is missing. Thanks a lot -- this completely screwed me over making Christmas Eve dinner. Hire a damn proofreader.

This was delicious. I added about two cups of beef broth to the wine - I feel like it would have been lacking in a 'gravy quality' if I didn't. I also forgot the pearl onions but it didn't seem to matter much. I served it over boiled Yukon Gold potatoes lightly tossed in olive oil and chopped parsley. A simple dish to prepare but time-consuming. Don't plan on eating it on the same day unless you begin in the early afternoon.

i cooked this for four foodie friends to high acclaim. i cooked 90% of it the night before. i didn't find the preparation too fiddly - there were a couple of different elements but it's easy to do it all calmly and it took me around 45 mins of prep. i changed the following: 1. instead of putting chopped bacon in, i got a good piece of salty gammon, put it in a net bag and added it as i didn't want bits of bacon in the stew. the flavour was important though. 2. i used good quality rump steak 3. i cooked everything the night before and put it on the hob for 4 hours. the next day, i cooked the mushrooms and onions about two hours before serving, put them in a caserole pot with the rest of the stew (took out the herb bunch), added another half a bottle of wine to make sure it didn't dry out and put it on a really low heat in the oven for about another 1.5 hours. it was the perfect stew consistency - rich and thick but not gluggy. the flavours were complex and layered. i served with buttery mash potatoes and leek and red and green cabage sauted in butter. very good sides for this dish. served with several bottles of gutsy red wine - shiraz, cab sav etc. yummmmmm!

Ohlala! Damp, chilly day. Daughter and I decided to surprise my fiance (who just happens to be a frenchman) by making this recipe for dinner. Yes. Following the steps to this IS time-consuming but the end result is well-worth it. This stew has a hearty consistency--perfect for those oncoming cold and damp days. Very filling. The flavor is excellent. One caveat: If you are the type of person who has a slight issue with the digestion of onion, you just may want to cut the amount of onion by half. Note--this is just for those who have issues with onions. Otherwise, a keeper of a recipe! In addition, this is a wonderful dish for entertaining. It can be made ahead and the flavors will just intensify. Also, it allows you the time to spend with your guests. As an aside...you can serve for dessert creme brulee as you can make this dessert ahead as well!

I made this recipe at the beginning of this month for our annual Jeu de Boule Club day for 20 people. It was delicious, everybody liked it. From all the recipes I looked at this was the best. I did use Burgundy wine and I think that the brandy gave it just that little extra. Since I could not find boiling onions or pearl onions I used pickeld pearl onions which I sooked in cold water for a few hours changing the water a few times to get rid of some of the vinegar taste. I made it 2 days ahead.

The flavor was nice but I can't get past the stringy meat. I guess that's typical of chuck, right? (I don't cook a lot of meat.) Doesn't the texture of the meat bother anyone else?

This took quite a while to make, but family loved it. I would leave the meat in bigger pieces next time since it does shrink up quite a bit. If you slow cook it long enough, it'll fall apart nicely.

Made this for company not knowing one of our guests was a Bourguignon connoisseur. I have high praise for this recipe as he said it was the best he'd ever tasted. Cheers! I'm making it again for Christmas! I served this with truffled mashed potatoes, another hit and roasted french beans.

I have made this several times and it's always a crowd-pleaser. I use two-buck Chuck, chuck roast, double the recipe, and add a couple extra pounds of beef. I serve with "Toasted Hazelnut Salad with Dried Cranberries and Hazelnut Vinaigrette" and simple roasted redskin potatoes. I left out the brandy one time and it made a big difference.

This was good, but nothing special. It resembled a beef stew in a wine-flavored sauce more than a true boeuf bourguignon, which should have a more subtle, layered flavor. Followed the recipe exactly.

I served this to my card club. Darn! There were no leftovers. They said it was a 5 star restaurant dish. I followed one of the reviewers advice. I cooked it for 2 hours the day before and put it into the oven for 2 hours before dinner. Simple and incredibly wonderful!

Rating: 4
I doubled this recipe for a dinner party for 15, and it was magnificent, but also quite the undertaking! I followed the basic recipe, using chuck and a cote du rhone, but used only about a 1/2 bottle of wine instead of the 2 bottles indicated by the recipe, bringing the wine about halfway up the beef, and then placed parchment directly atop the beef and vegetables before placing the lid on my dutch oven on my stovetop. I braised it very slowly for about 1.5 hours on the stovetop the first day, watching very carefully to make sure that it maintained a slight simmer, and then cooled and put in the refrigerator overnight, where the beef soaked up even more of the lovely wine and aromatics. The next day, I heated it up to continue the gentle braise for about another hour, adding the prepared onions and mushrooms about 20 minutes before serving. It was quite the journey, and a whole lot of work (have you ever towel-wiped 2 lbs of mushrooms or peeled 2 lbs of pearl onions? ;) ), but so well worth it. I'm absolutely blown away...will make this again and again.

Rating: 4
Delicious, but i take issue with the estimated cooking time - i'd say a lot closer to 2, 2 1/2 hrs active time: all of the chopping, browning, garni-making, onion peeling is work enough for 3 people (my mother and husband had to pitch in)

Rating: 4
The wine sauce is consistently wonderful. The basic recipe is fundamentally timeless. The most difficult part is getting the seasoning exactly right. I've researched through more than a dozen major cookbooks & each has a recipe which is similar, if not identical (including Julia's). There is nothing wrong with that. To me, it suggests that a recipe is so time- tested that it is nearing utter perfection. Plus, the flexibility of the recipe (with substitutions) makes it even more wonderful. Life is good!

another gushing review for this recipe. wonderful for a date or company - you do all the work in the afternoon and let it sit there and smell delicious until everyone is ready to eat. i used portobello that i had on hand and subbed peas for pearl onions. for leftovers i put it over egg noodles, which is also excellent.

Fantastic meal! I made a good first impression using this recepice. I'm first class now! Definately use Crimini mushrooms. Also, a bit nitpicky, but I always use olive oil and never use vegetable oil. Used smoked pepper throughout the cooking process as well:P

SLOW COOKER USE: "Cook from Philadelphia, PA"on 12/06/03 shared that s/he used a slow cooker for this recipe. Have others tired it using this applicance and can you make any further suggestions especially on settings: "high/low", cooking times and type of cooker: modern high tech or simpler earlier vintage? DRYING OUT PROBLEM AND MORE ECONOMICAL CUTS & ONIONS: As I read the reviewers who discussed the "drying out problem and the need to add more liquids - this would definately be solved with the slow cooker. The comments about using a more economical cut of beef also line up very nicely with the slow cooker especially during these challenging economic times. ONIONS:A question about onions... specially as I find that onions, if placed in a slow cooker whilst raw, have an off taste but in my view, seem to meld into a slow cooker dish if sauted a little before adding. SOURCE OF BAYLEAF: Also I have no idea the source of my bay leaves.. .why are California produced bayleaves to be avoided? Cheers, The "grome"tropolitan

This is the best and most flavorful boeuf bourguignon ever! I made it for a special dinner party for friends and the mmmmm's and ohhhhs continued throughout the meal. I used a good Chateauneuf-Du-Pape in the stew and served the same wine alongside. I also used olive oil rather than vegetable oil when browning the beef. I cooked it for one hour on the stove top, cooled and then refrigerated it. The next day I cooked it for 2.5 hours longer in the oven in a covered clay pot. This is now my standby recipe for boeuf bourguignon!

Flavorful and delicious! I didn't have everything on hand that I needed, so made a few substitutions (dried thyme instead of fresh, port and wine instead of brandy, etc), and left out the pearl onions entirely (just didn't have them!). Everyone loved it.

Great recipe! I used lardons instead of bacon, but it's the same idea. One important thing: while I generally adhere to the maxim that one should only cook with wine one would drink, you should absolutely NOT bust your budget on the wine going into the stew. Much better idea to buy a simple burgundy for the stew (mine was a 2006 AOC from Bourgogne for 5 euros) and splurge on a lovely wine to go with dinner. It really does NOT make that much difference after cooking for 4 hours with herbs!

One of the better boeuf bourguignon recipes we've found. It is quite difficult to find pearl/baby/boiling onions in London so we substituted small shallots, but it's not quite the same.

Made this for company this weekend. Great that it could be made a day ahead and re-heated. Added portabello mushrooms when re- heating - I let it cook probably another good solid hour and half in the oven at 325 while we enjoyed apps and wine. Instead of simmering on the stove I braised in the oven for 4 hours at 325.I do that with a lot of soups/stews so you don't have to watch the stove. I used a very large chuck roast cut into probably 3 inch pieces - 5 lbs total. Served with garlic mashed potatoes - yum!

Fantastically deep and rich dish. We served it for Christmas dinner by- passing our traditional foul or roast and it was a great hit. We accompanied it with roasted potatoes rather than boiled which seemed more festive. I used a nice California Pinot Noir, Chateau St. Jean, for the stew and the same to drink and it worked wonderfully.

I have to smile at the extreme ire this lil' recipe provoked in Francois 2's review...ooh la la! As with other national classics (ever talk to a Swiss houswife about 'the' recipe for Roesti..?), I'm sure every French cook is passionate about the fact that their Granny's way is THE way. So someone in the 21st century thought it'd be tasty to add celery and carrots....no need to cast national aspersions, I'd say. We're probably all capable of using our noodles on what kind of flavors will result from this multi-houred simmer and adjust accordingly. I think inspired cooking involves a healthy balance of tradition and flexibility, regardless of nationality. I wonder, by the way, how on earth Simone Beck, Julia Child's co-author on 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking', and quite French, could have dreamt of authorizing the use of carrots in their version? Hmmmmm....

I wrote the previous review and I want to add that despite the fact that I nearly set my house on fire, I'd say this recipe is outstanding! That being said, a warning should be printed on the recipe about the REAL HAZARDS of deglazing with brandy. The flames were licking the ceiling! I am lucky I still have eyebrows!

Rating: 0
WARNING: I didn't read all the reviews so I don't know if others have commented on this, but deglazing with brandy can be dangerous. Flames shot from my pot, reaching the ceiling. Very scary. I suggest deglazing OFF THE HEAT. or just deglazing with red wine and add brandy later with rest of wine. MY HANDS ARE STILL SHAKING! VERY SCARY!

OK, I won't be able to say anything that hasn't been said before - so allow me to comment on what I see as a big wine controversy here. First, whoever said that you should skip a French wine  MON DIEU! This is a classic French dish, so that should be the first place you should look when selecting 2 bottles of wine. Sure, Pinot Noir is all the rage in America, but Id urge you to look to the Rhone region of France because its bursting with excellent values and 2005 is quickly known as being the best of all years. I chose a Cote du Rhone (Domaine La Garrigue) to pour over the meat which cost $10  and it was fabulous. No need to spend any more than that for a wine that youre cooking with  the expensive stuff belongs on the table. Speaking of which, Id recommend a good Rhone for the dish (any 2005 Chateneuf du Pape would be fabulous), but I had a 2003 Clarendon Hills Grenache (Hickenbotham) that I had been dying to try  and it was worth opening up. Sure, its Australian  but Grenache is typically French, and the winemaker was completely inspired by French winemaking practices. Bottom line: a meal like this deserves a good wine at the dinner table, and a good VALUE wine poured into the pot. Bon Appetit.

Hadn't made this in years...forgot how good it is. No brandy, so I used lots of red wine...couldn't hurt, right? the pot kept running out of juice, so I kept adding more wine. Turned out greattender as could be. Great cold weather comfort food

People, you are missing the point of Beef Bourguignon....it is designed for a cheap, table burgundy, not some vintage that's at the top of the sommelier's chart. The same for the meat. Save the good stuff for the Tournedos but use your cheaper cuts here. And please, lay out your ingredients and prep tools ahead of time.

I've made this for years to rave reviews, the last time for a Scout Campout! As to American excess - if we applied similiar reasoning to all our dishes, we'd only have plain ice cream, no chocolate! Beef Stew would just be beef stew, meat loaf would just be meat in a loaf! What kind of world is that? This is very similiar to a recipe my mom made from Robert Carrier, (published in "Great Dishes of the World" in 1963)who lived in France for years, hired an elderly woman native to Burgandy who was a former cordon bleu cook for a "famous marquis." He attributed the beouf burgandy recipe in his book to her. She did use a calf's foot in the recipe though, as did my mom. Me, I just omit it.

Absolutely wonderful. A caution however: this dish is greatly influenced by the wine, so choose carefully. Avoid French wines, which tend to be of inferior quality and overpriced these days. Instead, try a nice American burgundy or Australian Chiraz.

This is insane. As a french, cooking Boeuf Bourguignon often, this is a sacrilege. Vegetable oil ?! Brandy ?! CELERY ?! CAROTTES?! What's wrong with you people ? This is not a "Boeuf aux carottes" or a stew or I don't know what. Boeuf bourguignon is just made by roasting the beef and some lardons, then adding red wine, and then letting the whole cook for two hours. Period. That belief that great cusine requires two zillions ingredients is absurde.

WOW... I have made several versions of Boeuf Borguignon and this was spectacular. I served over buttered egg noodles with a lovely side salad of bibb lettuce, Maytag Blue Cheese, pecans and pears with a mustard vinaigrette. I used the Baby Bellas as another reviewer recommended. I was increasing the recipe 1 1/2 times since I was making for a larger group, so I added Beef Stock (made from Williams Sonoma Beef Demi-glace) which I think enhanced all the flavors. I made it the night before (all but the pearl onions and the mushrooms) in my large Le Crueset dutch oven and let it simmer for many hours. I used a very good bottle of Burgundy wine and I do think using good wine makes a difference. Also nice to drink the same wine you use in the dish if possible. This is going in the permanent file without question. I agree with the comment... you make this dish to show your family that you love them!

This was very very good. I made it as written, apart from using about 1/2 lb less meat.

A great recipe that won't blow the budget.

My Aunt had copied down a recipe for Beef Burgundy from a tv show and was very excited to try it. It was a huge flop, unfortunately, and she called me to see if I had a good recipe. I mailed her this one because I had made it numerous times before and always received raves from my dinner guests. At my last visit to my aunt's, we made this together ( I brought along an additional wine for us to sip as we cooked), and it was terrific as usual. I like to use chuck because this is a wonderful way to use a less expensive cut of meat....it's always very tender and delicious.

I loved this and so did my guests. I will definately make it again. I served it with buttered noodles and green beans, but next time I will use potatoes. I did half of the recipe on Friday (brown and simmer) and I did the onions and mushrooms the next day. I used 4lb meat, top round, and I added a half can of beef broth when I reheated. Because I did half one day and half another day, I didn't think it was too time consuming. In total I cooked for about 3 1/2 hours, which I don't think is too much for dinner for 6. Superb!

I really like this recipe because it is not as greasy as a lot of beef bourguignon recipes. It does require a bottle of good wine, not the jug stuff. We served it in pasta bowls on top of flat noodles and just had good bread and a salad of fresh tomatoes, avocado, and blue cheese with a white balsamic vinaigrette (see recipe for Bacon and Lettuce Salad for the dressing). Top it off with a homemade blueberry pie or other fruit pie.

Made this for a Pinot Noir wine tasting. Very good recipe. Like another reviewer, I added some beef demi glace in the middle of the process, since the sauce tasted a slight bit bitter to me (I believe from the brandy.) When I make it again, I will also wrap the bouquet garni in cheesecloth. (I had to fish everything out separately since my bundle fell apart.) I doubled the recipe and made it in my Le Crueset, starting it on the stove and finishing it in the oven. Served with califlower puree.

I am so happy I ran into this recipe! It's the first snowfall of the season here so everything is a mess and I had most ingredients in my house. We'll give this 3.5 forks. Some improvisations - cognac instead of brandy; no bacon; added juniper berries to the bouquet (which I wrapped in cheese cloth for easy removal); browned on the stovetop then finished in the crock pot for 8 hrs on low. Half the wine in the crock pot and boil the rest on the stovetop to reduce. Delicious! We'll absolutely have it again this winter and I'll make it the same way. Enjoy!

Wow!! So Good!! Even with a pretty large dutch oven I wasn't able to get much of the wine in the pot, and so reduced it into sauce afterwards. It's even better if you can make it a day ahead to mellow out in the fridge overnight. Would SO make this again. Excellent over egg noodles.

I made this over the weekend. Since I was only making if for my husband & me, I halfed the recipe. Yes, it's quite labor intensive but any dish like this is!! It was very good. We are having the leftovers tonight. I have to admit, I have a beef stroganoff recipe that my husband said was better and he would prefer that over this. I thought this was good (so did he) and I'll probably make it again! It does keep you in the kitche all afternoon, though!!

It was very tasty. Thanks for the tips from previous reviews. I was too sleepy to finish cooking it the night before, so I moved it over to the slow cooker (low, 5-6 hrs) and added the onions.

I have to say that this recipe was a lot of work but not a lot of flavor. It was "good" but I expected more for the effort involved. I also served it with egg noodles rather than potatoes. I must admit that the pearl onions were quite good on their own before adding them to the beef mixture! I was quite surprised how they glazed just from the water they cooked in! Give this recipe a try...it just might be a matter of personal taste.

Am embarrassed to say that I overcooked it a little, but my only excuse is that an old friend from out of town called and I forgot to check on it.

Will be added to the family recipe box. And hopefully I'll be paying more attention next time!

This is a favorite - although like many French dishes it requires many steps and pans, it is worth the effort and the make-ahead option is a huge plus. We like to use Baby Bella mushrooms, also a little more tomato paste. Just the thing for a winter dinner party. Enjoy.

This dish is labor-intensive but worth the effort. I made it the night before my New Years Eve party and guests are still raving about it. I doubled the recipe, added a can of beef broth with the wine, increased the tomato paste and garlic, and otherwise followed the recipe. Delicious!

Really wonderful. I followed the recipe to the letter, except for deglazing the pot with brandy (I used a good cognac instead). I cooked the dish on Monday 12/23 and served it Christmas Eve. The flavor was astounding, and the aroma made elicited numerous "Wow, that smells good!". Everyone raved about it. I served the meal with boiled potatoes and green beans, and followed it with a nice crisp green salad. Be sure to use a good bottle of Burgundy or Cotes du Rhone wine. Quite rich, definitely time consuming, but well worth the effort for a spectacular and festive feast.

Delicious! Doubled the recipe family Christmas dinner - didn't want to spend all day in the kitchen so this was PERFECT! Instead of doubling the wine and brandy, I substituted equal amounts of beef broth. I'm happy to say that the result was excellent! Cut boneless chuck roast into 2" pieces, well-trimed, which resulted in tender, juicy beef. Served with home-made fettucini instead of potatoes. Thanks for making my Christmas dinner a success and very enjoyable for the cook!

The last review was a rather shocking one, I must admit. I made this lovely "boeuf" a couple of weeks ago, and I've had another request for it already. I brought some to my neighbors because we couldn't eat it all, and they also raved. As for smelling up the whole mobile park with an awful stench, I can only say that this dish (as do most) depends entirely on the quality of the ingredients. Perhaps the meat or the wine was spoiled.

This got rave reviews with my family! Two thumbs up! Very falvourful and filling! I didn't find that I could taste the alcohol at all, but then again I let it simmer on low heat for 7 hours in total - perhaps thats the trick!

Excellent and thorough recipe. I added 2 cups of meat stock which added moisture and also helped to cut the alcohol flavor.

Maybe this is a blinding flash of the obvious, but I inserted/stuck the pointy part of the clove into the celery and had no problem retrieving the bouquet garni in tact--no cheesecloth required.

My crowd loved this dish (4 forks), while I thought it was 3 forks. I used a bottle of Mondavi Pinot Noir and good brandy. Tasted too winey/liquory no matter how long I cooked it. I added some sugar which helped tone it down. left out the carrots. pearl onions are a must! No stock.

Terrific and hearty. Be sure to use a decent bottle of wine - since you‚Äôre using the whole bottle, it definitely makes a difference! I‚Äôll certainly be using the recommended wine next time. :)

Takes a while, but the aromas that fill the house prime the taste buds. Well worth the wait.

I can't add much that hasn't already been said about this recipe. It is rather labor intensive but the result is more than worth the time. I thought the sauce was a bit thick after 3 1/2 hours of cooking so I added a bit more wine to thin it out. Simply a stellar dish!

Add more wine if needed, no stock! Simply marvelous. Even leftovers will be gone quickly.

I have only looked at this recipe and this looks like it is missing the addition of beef stock. The Julia Child version definately had beef stock added in. Any comments on that?

This was a wonderful recipe! I am a novice cook. I've never made this before, and I didn't even do a practice run to try this recipe. I made it Christmas Eve to serve on Christmas Day. I used Cotes du Rhone and increased the recipe by guessing. I added the onions and carrots the second day. By the time it was served, the beef was literally falling apart it was so tender. Everyone raved about it and I am not a gourmet! It's really not that complicated but definitely make a day ahead for taste alone!

Since last winter, I have served this dish at three different dinner parties. Each time I could tell my guests wanted to lick thier plates clean(if no one was looking). I always start with a simple green salad and finish with a cheese course. Thank you Gourmet!

I do drop off catering, and this dish was the centerpiece for a dinner for 40. I baked everything, except the pearl onions and mushrooms, the day before at 325 degrees, then chilled the mixture and removed the fat. I boiled and peeled the onions, tossed them in with the mushrooms (criminis are wonderful) and then heated it all, with some extra beef stock thrown in for good measure, and served it with buttered poppy seed noodles. The flavors were beyond compare, but I still have trouble making a dish like this look like something other than beef stew. Some snipped chives over the top did the trick. Served it with the dried cranberry toasted pecan salad found on this site, along with stuffed pork tenderloin, and country breads with sweet cream butter. It was a hit!

A friend and I made this for a dinner party for 26 and it was delicious. We should have used cheesecloth for the bouquet garni. I used extra fresh thyme and pinot noir. We served it with roasted red potatoes, grilled asparagus, salad with carmelized pecans, dried cranberries, pears and gorgonzola. We made it two days ahead and had time for a pre-dinner party wine tasting and chose a delicious french pinot noir to go with it. Great fun to find recipes with good review on this website!!!

This meal was fantastic! I served it to 7 other people who all loved it. I did the onions a couple of days before, the rest of the dish the day before and the mushrooms on the day and that helped with spreading the load. I was worried that the wine would reduce to nothing after 4 hours with the lid partially open but this did not happen. The mistake I made was to buy already cut steak from the butcher. The pieces were not uniform and some of the smaller ones disintegrated. Next time I will buy a chunk and chop it up myself. I used a cheesecloth for the bouquet garni and that worked fine. I used 4.5 lbs of meat for 8 people as I hate not having enough and was left with lovely leftovers. I also had appetisers and a soup which may have accounted for lots of leftovers. All in all a delicious delicious and very hearty recipe loved by all my guests.

I prepared this recipe for a dinner for 30 that I was catering. I quadrupled the recipe. Because I was producing in quantiy I braised it in the oven at 325C rather then on the stovetop. I did brown the meat and deglaze beforehand. A comment to those who felt it was labor intensive. It helps alot if you prepare your mise en place before you start cooking. Definitely use cheesecloth for your bouquet garni so you don't have to go fishing for it later. I also used pinot noir in place of the burgundy. It was much more cost effective. A technique that I used to prevent the sauce from reducing too much was to keep it covered for the 1st 2 hours of cooking then remove and continue cooking for the remainder of time. As suggested, cook 1 day in advance to give the flavors the chance to develop. Paired with a side of Goat-cheese scalloped potatoes with chives (also found on this site) and grilled asapragus. A success!

Wow, was this ever labor intensive. I think it was worth the work, but it really kept me in the kitchen all afternoon. My guests loved it and asked for seconds, but my feet sure do hurt! Also, the gravy got too thick, which I totally didn't expect. I had to add some beef broth to loosen it up a bit.

This recipe was wonderful. I made a few modifications. I had a recipe from Patricia well cookbook called Bistro cooking 1989. Great book for french cooking. I made the stew one day ahead. I did not use the bacon. After reheating the day of the dinner, I added the zest and juice from a small orange. Great flavor. I also used 1 tsp of dried thyme. Everyone loved it. I served it with new potatoes and served the remaining sauce on the side and people wanted to use it on their potatoes, because it was so great. Used Wonder flour to to thicken a little.

I do a French Impressionist luncheon once a month for approximately 30 people. I just served this dish for a Cezanne luncheon and everyone loved it. The only thing I did differently was to put the herbs in cheesecloth and tie it up. This way before reheating the next day I just took it out. Served with Parsley Potatoes, homemade yeast rolls, and a pear salad.

Thanks for pulling this recipe together! Some years ago, I had managed to produce similar results by taking certain essential elements of several recipes for "Beef Bourguignon" and combining them. My only suggestion for your recipe is to consider the following. Drain and remove the meat from the sauce when finished cooking. Then remove the bay leaves (and cloves if you can find them.) Put the sauce into a blender and liquify, then return to a storage container to which the meat has been added. Reheat the following day and serve with mashed potatoes and roasted carrots. Delicious!

Very easy, extremely tasty and absolutely wonderful and perfect in every way! The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to wrap the bouquet garni in cheesecloth -- it made it much easier to retrieve later. Besides that, I didn't change a thing and will definitely make it again.

Very good - a keeper. Even better the next day. I froze the leftovers and the other day when I didn't feel like cooking brought it out again and served it over noodles - tasted great.

I made this dish on a very cold winter Sunday. It smelled delicious as it cooked and tasted even better. Even the leftovers were wonderful. I'd make it for company and wait for compliments.
