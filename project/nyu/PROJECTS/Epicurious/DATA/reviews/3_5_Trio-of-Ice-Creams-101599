The ice creams are delicious. The nougat was my favorite, the saffron was my husband's favorite, and the lavender was a little too mild. For more intense color, I'll run the saffron mix through the blender next time. I also couldn't get all three made in the same day because my ice cream cannister was too thawed out after doing the second one.

Worth every bit of the effort.

A bit time-consuming, but it produces a worthwhile, unusual and delicious combination of flavors. The honey-saffron came out the best, although it needed more saffron (pack the threads a little when measuring). The lavender was also wonderful; however, I think it works better as an accompaniment to the other ice creams than on its own. For the nougat, definitely chop the almonds first, since the resulting candy is nearly impossible to chop.

The lavendar was our favorite. If I made it again I would use a very mild honey with the saffron(I used wildflower and it hid the saffron's flavor). Also, I would not make all 3 at the same time again. It took us 2 days because the ice cream makers bowl had to refreeze between ice creams. Also I recommend pre chopping the almonds for the nougat.

These are delicious. The nougat one is especially outstanding. It's great to make them all and serve them together.

The trio is worth the time and effort--each recipe produces a rich ice cream of intense flavor. Only problem is that the instructions for the nougat are insufficient for those not experienced in candy-making (like myself). The honey mixture needs to boil longer, and a syrup-hardening test needs to be made.
