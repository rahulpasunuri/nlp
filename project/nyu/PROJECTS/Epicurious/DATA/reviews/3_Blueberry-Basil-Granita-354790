I made this with grated ice instead of water to freeze & make a slushy. I wasn't sure how the basil, berries and honey would come together, but it is very refreshing. I reduced the berries a little bit on the 2nd batch to bring out more of the basil flavor.

I made this again with blueberries. This time it was very good. Used 2T organic honey, 3T simple sugar and a dash of ginger powder for something different. My son loves this. Great desert for a little boy with severe food allergies.

Pretty good recipe overall. I used raspberries. I should have strained the seeds but it wasn't a show stopper. I used simple syrup from Trader Joe's for a lighter sweetener. Also increased the basil to about 1/2 cup. Great recipe for and alternative to the standard pesto for your summer garden basil. Next time I will use blueberries.

Awesome! I used a lemon because I did not have a lime, and it was delicious. It's so easy and healthy.

What can I say? It tastes like blended up blueberries. I added some pineapple the second time around. This recipe definitely needs some pineapple.
