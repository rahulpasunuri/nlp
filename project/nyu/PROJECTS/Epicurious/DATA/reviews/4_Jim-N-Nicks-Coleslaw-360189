This was very good and not "mayo-y." I don't like mine too sweet, so I cut the sugar back. Like another reviewer, I like some celery seed in mine. To make a small batch: Mix 2.5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar and 1.5 Tbs sugar. Mix into 3.5 cups (packed) pre-packaged coleslaw mix. Let sit for 30 minutes, then drain and pat dry with paper towel. Add 1 Tbsp mayo, celery seed, salt, pepper, optional dash cayenne.

I was skeptical that this would be over mayo-y and not the remarkably crisp & delicious slaw that it is. Got many compliments at the bbq! My new standard slaw.

I made this to serve on/with pulled pork sandwiches and it was delicious! Half of us don't like mayo dressed slaw and half do. Everyone loved it!

I've never made coleslaw before, and I think I'm set with my recipe going forward! This was a big hit! A little sweet, but with some tanginess.

This got rave reviews at my barbeque, and I was almost embarrassed because it's so simple to make. I ran short on apple cider vinegar, and had to use some white vinegar, and it was fine.

I love coleslaw and thought this was one of the best I've had. I was skeptical that the vinegar was drained off, but the cabbage has more than enough tang. I especially like this because it isn't too mayo heavy. I've made this many times and the only thing I do differently is sometimes add a pinch or two of celery seed, which I love in coleslaw. Just a personal preference, the recipe is great as is!

Very delicious and tangy. Exactly what I want when I think of coleslaw.

Nothing special but not bad. Tastes like store bought because of all the sugar, but good for a change/standard flavor.

I was making pulled pork sandwiches for a group of friends and thought I should have some coleslaw to go on them. I usually hate coleslaw and didn't want to get store bought. Made a 1/2 batch and followed the directions exactly. It turned out AMAZING. I had several helpings myself and wished I had made the full size batch. If you normally don't like cole slaw - you will love this one. I used matchstick cut carrots which were perfect.

So simple & delicious. Great sweet-tart balance. Really seems to exceed the sum of its parts.

Made this to go along with pulled pork sandwiches - turned out perfect. I normally don't like coleslaw, but this was delicious. Followed the recipe exactly as directed - I will be making it again.

Great simple recipe, I didn't strain the cabbage, which I should have. However, if you want a slaw thats less creamy, it actually works. This is a basic that you can build upon or leave simple as it is.

Made this today for a Father's Day lunch. Wow! What a delicious coleslaw! I will make this again and again I know as everyone really raved about it. The sweet and sour balance is just right, and I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a very easy recipe that worked exactly as written. I made it for a BBQ and all of it was gone by the end of the evening. Will definitely try it again!

Oh man did this stuff hit the spot. I made it to accompany the pulled pork bbq I had spent all day cooking. Only difference was that I reduced the vinegar to one cup. Also, I let the cabbage soak in the sugar/vinegar mixture instead of immediately draining it (which I did when it was time to add the other ingredients). This was terrific, the only challenge will be to NOT make it everyday! :)

My new favorite coleslaw - and that is saying alot for this southern woman! What a great side for many spring and summer dishes. I reduced the sugar by half and after draining the cabbage, used a paper towel to remove excess vinegar - a key to the slaw not becoming watery. Fresh cracked pepper and a hearty pinch of sea salt finished it off perfectly!

Much too much vinegar.

Fresh, tasty and so easy! Perfect coleslaw in every way. I will keep this recipe for a long time. I added some fresh ground pepper, but other than that I made as written.

This is fabulous coleslaw! I made the Carolina pulled pork over the weekend to bring to an open house and made this coleslaw to go atop of the pork, everyone loved it.

Been on epicurious for years and never felt compelled to write a review until now... this coleslaw is stellar. Super yum. Perfect with pulled pork sandwiches. I was short on time and only marinated for 30 minutes and it still turned out great. Loved that it had very little mayo.

Very yummy. I used celery & white onion instead of carrots & green onions. Went great with my Mexican version of a pulled pork sandwich. Slow cooked pork roast on a corn tortilla with cole slaw on top & Cholula hot sauce. Big hit with husband.

Lovely - I made it with raw sugar & vegan mayo, and it turned out great.

This is a sure fire bet for satisfying tradional cole slaw. I used 1/4 cup honey instead of sugar, used half the vinegar and used fresh chives from my garden instead of green onions and I also used canola based mayo to cut fat and calories and it was still fantastic.

Definetly the best slaw I've had, adding to my fav's!

I made this with pulled chicken sandwiches and it was one of the best coleslaws i have ever made! I love how simple the dressing is, and the fact that i didnt have to go out and buy a bunch of fancy ingredients. I let it sit in the vinegar for 4 hours and i thought the taste was perfect... it would have been too bland the other way.

Actually had this at the restaurant 3 years ago and remember how good it was ( I order coleslaw where ever it is on the menu). I left it more than the hour in the vinegar, next time will follow recipe more closely as it was slightly too vinegary. That said, we finished it off.

Wow! This coleslaw is delicious, light and perfect for a summer dinner. The small amount of mayonnaise still gives the coleslaw a creamy texture and the apple cider vinegar is tart. I used slightly less sugar than specified and mixed green and purple cabbage to make the coleslaw more colorful. I definitely think this is best if you make it and allow it to sit for a while to soak in the flavors. This will become a mainstay in my summer repertoire.

This recipe is from Jim N Nicks Bar-B-Q in Charleston, South Carolina by request of Bon Appétit reader Nicole Comrey. It appears in the popular R.S.V.P./readers favorite restaurant recipes column. I dont know Jim and Nick, but Ill bet they are going to make Bon Appétit fame with their coleslaw. It is perfectionflavorful and juicy with great texture. This should be the standard by which all coleslaws are measured. I served it with pulled pork sandwiches. I was wondering how it would turn out because the vinegar is drained after standing for only an hour. That might be their secret. I followed their do ahead method and waiting 8 hours before adding the mayo, carrot, and green onions. This will be a recipe I turn to over and over again. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/jim-%E2%80%99n-nicks-coleslaw/
