We thought the dish was very tasty and the nutmeg was a great touch, but be warned: 1) it's difficult to make the pasta without a spatzle maker 2) the chives and scallions add necessary flavors (we highly recommend not omitting them) 3) you may want a sous chef

I found another alternative to Quark, pressed cottage cheese. It has the texture of cream cheese but the fresh taste of cottage cheese and its readily available here is Canada. Also I used a food mill with a large grating plate - worked wonders.

To the cook below asking about quark. Quark is a fresh yogurt cheese. You should be abale to find it in specialty shops and high end grocery stores. If for some reason you cannot find it, you can make a quick substitue. Place a paper coffee filter into a small sieve or wire strainer and suspend it over a bowl. Put plain unflavored yogurt into the paper filter. Place in the refrigerator for a day or two. The excess liquid will filter into the bowl leaving a thick yogurt in the filter. The thickened yogurt is quark. It's a great replacement for sour cream too and not nearly as fattening. This is a great recipe for Spaetzle but I prefer the way we made it in Swabia (Germany). Just toss the cooked Spaetzle with lots cubed cheese (any kind you like) and a bit of butter. Top with browned onions and bake until heated through. Kind of like German Mac & Cheese!

My relatives make a mean version of this, but this is definitely the best Kaese-Spaetzle I've had outside of Germany. When making this dish, it's easiest to use a Spaetzle-maker (available at Sur la Table or other kitchen stores) - if you like Spaetzle as much as I do, you'll make it often enough to justify the cost of the appliance ($20-40). One tip - be sure to use the Gruyere - the Spaetzle doesn't taste the same without it.
