Good with flattened boneless breasts, breaded and fried on high heat; removed and then added again for a minute with the sauce after it's been reduced. Much improved by adding about a dozen finely chopped lemon-marinated green olives into sauce. Don't skimp on the fresh lemon juice or this sauce sucks.

Very good. Prepared with boneless breasts which I browned in a pan; let them finish in oven while preparing sauce. Found the sauce to be a bit too tart so added about 1 tbsp of agave nectar (or honey) to sweeten it up just a bit. The sauce was also very oily, so don't think I'll add the extra olive oil next time. Otherwise very good. Kids ate every bite.

This was very good. I didn't have chicken on the bone, so I used cutlets of boneless breasts, sprinkled with cumin and sauteed until brown on both sides. I removed from the sautee pan, added the garlic and juices and zest and returned chicken to the pan. I cooked the chicken in the pan covered for about 5 - 8 minutes. Very tasty.

I also want to add, the prep method for the chicken is not a problem but the cooking time is way under what it should be and I used boneless skinless breasts! I only "browned" them for a few minutes on each side and rather than saute the garlic at the end, I just sprinkled the chopped up garlic on top of the chicken while it roasted. My pan was covered and it still took about 40-45 minutes for the chicken to cook through.Perhaps it was the combination of the two citruses, the peels might have worked better being sprinkled over the chicken/rice/pasta, whatever, after it was cooked but it doesn't work in the liquid, I can tell you that. The premise sound so delicious but if prepared as directed, you will be dissapointed.

Oh dear, this was just AWFUL! I agree with the review just before mine that the sauce tastes like bile, it really did. I poured it out and just used some remaining orange juice, brown sugar and a bit of honey and got a nice result after reducing it. I also burned my hand to boot so this is an all around bust for me.

This was just terrible. I made exactly as instructed and the taste of orange peels and lemon peels where overwhelming to the point where the sauce just tasted like bile.

Let's see -- I added 1 tsp of brown sugar and the red pepper flakes. Chicken took twice as long. All told it was lovely, but a bit fussy. I'd rather just add lemon juice and stock and butter and deglaze . . . .

I'm one of those people who just can't stand cilantro, so I left it out. I was wild about the cumin and citrus combo though! I used skinless, boneless breasts (it was all I had on hand) and I think the cooking time needed to be increased by quite a bit. Besides the chicken and cilantro, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit with my family. For a simple quick dinner, I paired it with plain rice (made with chicken stock) and a spring mix with a balsamic vinagrette that went perfectly alongside the citrus pan sauce.

I agree with those who thought this was waaay too sour but I redeemed it by adding several T of brown sugar and some honey and fresh grated ginger, plus reducing the sauce down even farther so that it was a richer and sweeter sauce. Also added a little red pepper for more heat.

Sorry, just didn't like this one. For me, the cumin just didn't mix with the citrus taste. Won't be making this again.

I made this recipe substituting tangerine infused oil that I was trying to use up. I didn't have the cilantro...I won't forget it next time. It was great but would have been better with cilantro.

Tasty, but not totally thrilling. It took about 25 minutes in the oven, not 15, for the breasts to cook through. I did like using this stove top/oven method, though--I'm going to use it again for quick meals.

I was really surprised at how terrific this meal turned out. The sauce is really good and totally worth the effort. A great weekday meal.

As a college student, I'm always looking for quick but tasty recipes. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, rubbed both sides with cumin, salt, pepper, and a little bit of cayenne. Based on the reviews here, I also added a little soy, maple syrup, and more cayenne to the sauce. Very yummy and easy! Made rice to go with it. I left out orange zest and the cilantro because I didn't have any around.

I needed a quick and easy recipe for chicken breasts that even my pickiest child would eat, and this one was perfect. I made a couple changes, using skinless breasts and frozen orange juice and dried cilantro instead of fresh. I used two breasts but did not cut the sauce in half (I love sauce) and served it with egg noodles. Delicious!

This is an easy recipe for a week night-I always use boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I serve with rice to soak up the wonderful sauce.

Was pretty tasty; the lemon and orange gratings make for great texture, and I made this with a friend. We had great fun. It took about 2 hours or so to make, though that may have just been a reflection of our novice, and not the chicken. Since the chicken only takes about 30 minutes to prepare, and so does the rice and spinach, you could conceivably finish this meal in about 30-45 minutes if you already know what you're doing. (We kept messing up the peas and rice, etc) The only trick to this recipe is knowing how long everything will take to prepare: I'd suggest making the rice and spinach about 10-15 minutes before you do the chicken, as the chicken can be done pretty fast..

This is a simple, fairly quick recipe. The complimentary combination of cumin + citrus surprised me. The cumin is quite strong, which may alienate some tasters.

I used boneless breasts, too, and it still was great. Very easy, very tasty - though I did use more garlic than the recipe called for.

I used boneless, skinless chicken and didn't have any lemon, so used only orange. The sauce was very yummy, though I think next time I'll only bake the chicken, for when I browned it in the pan first, then baked, the outside got a bit tough.

This dish would have been much better had there been much less lemon in it. I am going to try it again, and I think it will be better next time.

I thought this was just so-so. The citrus flavours are very pronounced - almost to the point of being overwhelming. If I make this again I would tone done the sauce with honey and maybe soy sauce... or just skip the lemon juice. The chicken was delicious in its own right... I thought the cumin was yummy and the amounts just right.

This was a huge hit! Took more than 15 minutes in the oven, but still quick and easy. This is also a good recipe to make if you have kids - my 5 year old helped with juicing and zesting.

We made this dish and absolutely loved it. My boyfriend is great at making pan sauces, and this is no exception. As usual, this turned into a sauce war -- seeing who could get the most sauce! :-)

this was an easy quick dish. very flavorful! I actually used some of the fresh garlic, lemon/orange zest & mixed it with the fresh cilantro to make sort of a 'gremolata' to sprinkle on the chicken before serving.

Yum! Super easy. Even without orange zest or skin-on chicken it still tasted great. Found the recipe at 6pm and served it at 7:30 with brussel sprouts and rice. (I did lengthen the oven time as the chicken was still pink after 15 min.)

This is a great recipe. The cumin/orange combo is a delight. My husband ate it, my two-year old ate it, the cat ate it...even my ten-month old squealed for more. Prepared just as written, no changes except for that our chicken was quite thick, so we doubled the time in the oven. Perfect and juicy, looks great on the plate. We'll make this over and over.

A total success! My husband absolutely loves it. I left out the cilantro only because I never use the whole bunch in time to keep it from spoiling.

Personally, I didn't like this dish. Too much cumin. However, my husband and daughter, who are extemely picky, really liked it. I made it with Rice-A-Roni and it was very quick and simple.

Not only is this absolutely delicious it makes a beautiful presentation. I'm not a cilantro fan so I used flat leaf parsley and you certainly don't need a full 1/3cup. This is one of my all time favorite Bon Appetit recipes, even the kids love it. Fabulous!

I made this recipe exactly as written, except that I didn't bother with the cilantro. Yes, it's easy to prepare, and the citrus-cumin flavour was interesting, but there are much better chicken recipes out there, in my opinion. Nothing wrong with this one, but it was just ok - not really good enough for me to try again.

This recipe was a disaster. The sauce is way too tart. I had to add more chicken broth to temper the tartness and a few spoonfuls of honey and it was still pretty nasty.

I'm not the biggest fan of citrus glazes or sauces but my partner likes dishes a l'orange and this recipe got a lot of good reviews so I tried it. Guess what? We both loved it! I pounded the chicken flat, rubbed both sides with a lot of cumin and a little s&p, rolled up the breasts, let them sit in the 'fridge like that for several hours and the dish turned out great. I used the called-for amount of stock and orange juice and put in a bit extra lemon juice and zests. The cumin, citrus and cilantro made a wonderful taste combination. This not-a-fan-of-citrus-sauces will make the dish again.

Made this the first time with chicken following recipe exactly and it was delicious, easy and pretty on the plate. THEN, I made it with fish and put in more zest (maybe 1/3-1/2 again), and, like Cindy, I thought it was inedible BUT my boyfriend thought it was fabulous! He ate my portion. So, I will make this again but be sure to add amounts given; and I do like citrussy flavours. Or could it have been that the fish dish didn't have the chicken pan scrapings to tone down the sauce? I did add a tbsp of butter just before pouring sauce.

Rating: 2
I think the problem here may be the quality of fruit and juice being used. I used fresh squeezed o.j. and thought it was a bit too sweet. Next time I will amp up the lemon flavor, and make sure the mixture of zest and juices are to my liking before I through them in the pan to cook. All in all it has excellent potential and is very easy.

Sounds to me like Cindy from Toronto just doesn't like citrus. That's the only explanation, since this is just chicken, broth, citrus, garlic, cilantro and cumin. What does one expect from a recipe with this title?

This is the absolute worst recipe I have ever made in my life. I shudder at the thought of it.j It was bitter, sour and downright aweful. Cannot say enough bad things about it. I made it just as the recipe said. Run...find another chicken recipe, Shake and Bake is better than this. I threw it all out in the garbage.

We made this recipe written for a week night dinner, and were not as impressed with the pan sauce as other reviewers were - a little too tart for our tastes. We used fresh squeezed orange juice, so perhaps that was the culprit.

Very tasty! Made it two nights ago and my husband loved it. My frying pan isn't oven safe at 425, so I transferred the pieces to a glass baking dish, then poured the pan drippings back into the frying pan for the sauce, and that worked fine. Like most, I had to increase oven time to 30 min because my chicken breasts were very large, but they were still moist. My sauce ended up with a tiny bit too much oil for my taste, so maybe next time I would omit the additional 2 tbsp olive oil added in the sauce. Otherwise, it's a keeper.

Made last night with a fresh filet of halibut instead of chicken. The sauce is just wonderful and thickened nicely after reducing a bit. It would be great with shrimp or scallops.

I am really just rating the sauce. I used boneless pork loin chops as a substitute for the chicken. I seasoned as the recipe stated, then fried in a pan on both sides until done. I wrapped them in foil to rest as I made the sauce and then returned to pan to coat after. Very good. Very delicious.

Very tasty sauce, and very simple. the chicken itself was nothing major, but it was tender and you can't beat the simplicity factor. would add more cumin next time, and i agree the sauce would be even better on marinated or grilled chicken. can't wait to try it with shrimp.

Rating: 3
I give this 3 forks because of the sauce - which was delicious. The chicken was good, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor. I thought the cumin would really give it wow, but it was just okay (even with the great sauce). As for the cooking time, I used a cast iron pan, browned it on the stovetop for 2 minutes longer than asked for and cooked it in the oven for about 5 minutes longer than stated in the recipe. I will make the sauce again - it would be good on fish, shellfish or grilled/marinated chicken.

I liked it...turned out moist and the sauce was a nice touch. Glad I read the comments about cooking time. You should definitely have an thermometer on hand to make sure your chicken is cooked through. Mine took 35 minutes.

This was a very good, weeknight meal! The sauce was so fresh and spring-y tasting. Would certainly use this sauce again on fish and pork, as well. Don't skip the cumin! Very, very good, and is not overpowering at all. Served with rice to soak up all that good sauce! mmmmmm! Only thing--my chicken breasts took MUCH longer than 15 minutes to cook...more like 40 minutes.

This sauce is delicious! After reading the recipe, I thought the cumin would be overwhelming so I used a mix of sweet paprika, smoked paprika, cumin, and chili powder on boneless/skinless chicken breast halves. I browned the chicken in olive oil in my electric frying pan then made the sauce in the same pan, added the chicken back in for about 10 minutes and served with Spanish rice. The sauce is so fresh tasting and tangy and it seems so complex against the spicy chicken. It's also a fun dish for my husband and I to create together. Very good and I will definitely make again!

Fast and easy! I substitued large shrimp cooked in the pan sauce instead of chicken breasts, and included some chopped cilantro in the pan sauce. Love the citrus flavor!
