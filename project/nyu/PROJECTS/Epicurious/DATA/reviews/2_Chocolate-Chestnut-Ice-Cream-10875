I don't have an ice cream maker, so I skipped the custard part and mixed whipped cream with vanilla chestnut puree, then folded in bittersweet chocolate pieces. It came out very nicely, more like a semifreddo the flavors compliment each other and I can't wait to get an ice cream maker so I can do the real deal Holyfield.

Just say no to this one! My homemade marrons glacés were transformed into flavorless little hard bits in this recipe. And the stuff doesn't even melt. A scoop abandoned last night is still sitting on a saucer on the kitchen counter, intact, 12 hours later. I guess this weird effect is because it's kind of a frozen pudding. The mix did have a good flavor before it was frozen, but then, with 6 oz of Scharfenberger chocolate, what wouldn't?
