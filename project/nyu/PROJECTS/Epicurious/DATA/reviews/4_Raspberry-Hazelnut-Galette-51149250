The crust was kind of a mess, hard to keep together, BUT well worth the struggle as this was actually really easy to pull together and delicious. I used blackberry jam since that is what we had, and it was very good. Hazelnuts in the crust provided a very nice texture and flavor.

Has anyone attempted this? My dough was too dry to come together. I added an extra egg yolk which sort of worked, but it was still quite crumbly. Any suggestions on how to moisten the dough without toughening? The flavor was great and my changes possibly made the dough a little less tender than it would have been otherwise.
