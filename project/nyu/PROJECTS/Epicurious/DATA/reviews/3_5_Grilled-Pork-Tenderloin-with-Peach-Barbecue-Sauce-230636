Really yummy take on the pork tenderloin. Not a lot of kick for those that can't take the heat but has wonderful full flavor. Pairs great with the creamed corn recipie that follows and a smoked gouda mac n cheese!

I intially made the sauce with one cup of orange juice and one cup of ketsup. All I ended up with was a mush and I couldn't get more than 1/2 cup sauce. So back into the pan, and I added another cup of orange juice and 3/4 cup mango juice. Plus another 2 tbsp lemon juice.

Very good - thanks to those who advised to puree the sauce. My advice is to TAKE OUT THE CHILE PEPPER before you puree so you can add it to taste. You might even want to shake out the seeds from the dried chile before you start cooking, too. You can always add them later. I also omitted the peppercorns & added ground pepper to taste. Fresh serrano pepper, charred & peeled, would be a good substitute for the arbol, and I'm sure frozen peaches would work well in the sauce. Try to let your peaches ripen on the counter a few days. I had extra peaches & sliced some up on the side; it went REALLY well. Keep those reviews a-coming - they are SO helpful!

After reading other reviews I used 3/4c ketchup and did not strain but blended the sauce. Even though I only used 1/2 of a chipotle (& removed the seeds!) it was still too spicy. Totally my bad. To counter this I used juice from lite canned peaches & added in a few peaches since I had already used all my fresh peaches. That seemed to do the trick. My only issue was that the sauce had more of an orange flavor than peach. Next time I'll try using 3/4 c OJ and see if that works better. My friends devoured the dish and I'll definitely make it again!

wasn't impressed. I even added more peaches but it just tasted like ketchup. I strained the sauce, not sure if more bacon on the pork would have helped. Watch the salt. If you have salt infused tenderloin i'd halve the salt. It does smell and look impressive. ALso, get a good crisp covering of the pork if you grill it, those pieces were much better.

This recipe sounds great in theory - bacon, onions, peaches - nice. It wasn't until the step when I added ketchup, oj, and lemon juice that I noticed something missing. There is nothing to off-set the acidity of those things, and the sauce ends up tasting like tomato orange juice. I added a healthy dose of maple syrup and brown sugar, which I think are necessary for a good BBQ sauce. With those additions and a little extra spice, the sauce turned out well.

I really enjoyed this and so did my family. I had to use canned peaches because the so-called ripe peaches I bought at the store were tasteless and dry. I got a lot of compliments and plan on making this again.

Everyone in the family loved this pork dish. I pureed the sauce rather than strain it, perfect! Definitely worth making again!!

Really tasty. I used thick bonless pork chops under the broiler, following the recipe pretty faithfully except for the chops, using minced garlic instead of garlic powder and I pureed the sauce as suggested by a few reviewers. It came out really well & got raves. I used the left over sauce on chicken, using the same prep and that was great too. Will make again & would serve to company.

Fantastic! This was enjoyed by the whole family from grandparents to kids. I didn't have the Chile de arbol on hand, so I subbed a chipotle pepper. I also added about 1 Tbs of apple cider vinegar. The oranges and peaches came right from the trees into the pot. This will become a regular. I'm thinking it would also be great on chicken!

I made this for the second time last weekend, and it has proved to be a reliable favorite in our house and for our guests. I took another reviewers suggestion this time, and pureed the sauce instead of straining it- it was still absolutely smooth enough, and tasted great. The amount of sauce was also just right. Highly recommended!

I liked this because for me it was a little different and sweet which is what I wanted tonight. I sauced two boneless chicken breasts after a quick 3 min per side saute then into the oven for 6 min, then under the broiler brushed with the sauce for about 2 min per side. Too cold for BBQ tonight. I used 3 cloves of garlic and frozen peaches from grocery. I pureed it. I'm wondering if the flavoring of the bacon (maple-cured or smoked) affects this sauce. My bacon was hicory smoked and the sauce is sweet. Boyfriend loved it, served with mashed potates & veggie. As far as Mandame "Snob", too bad you never tried the Sopranos brand BBQ sauce when it was available - Awesome! But homemade is good. I used just the one Arbol chilie & all the peppercorns. We love hot foods & this sauce has just the right first taste - not too hot, then a plesant tingle grows in your mouth but does not overpower you. I 'll try it on pork next time but liked it with chicken - probably would be better on the BBQ. The new design is great with all the controls right at your fingertips . I never get the pop-ups though because I use Earthlink & they get rid of 'em for me. But from now on - I'll stick to food reviews & not digress.

I served this dish to 7 and it was really tasty. We threw some soaked pecan chips on the charcoal and cooked to 135 degrees and all agreed that it may be the best tenderloin ever.

It is always fun to try a new babeque sauce versus bottled. But won't put this on my "oh my god can't wait to make it again" list. It was very good. I doubled the peppers which gave it a nice heat and did ribs instead of tenderloin. Trying it tonight with the tenderloin.

Excellent dish. The only reason it didn't get four forks is that I'm stingy. It is probably the best grilled pork recipe I've ever made. Everyone in the family enjoyed it. It would be a very nice dish for company as well. I could not find the dried pepper anywhere and used a fresh serrano instead. Otherwise it was the only change I made. The sauce was wonderful!! Highly recommend

Made this dish last night for dinner, it was wonderful. Found ripe peaches and increased to three. Also did not strain but pureed and enjoyed the texture of the sauce. Just had a nibble of the left-overs and thought it was every bit as good as last night if not more so. Gave the pork an opportunity to blend with all the other flavors. This recipe is a definite addition to my recipe box!!

Throw all of the ingredients into a slow cooker, let it simmer most of the day (until the meat is nice and tender). OH! So good!

I used three dried chipotle peppers since that was what I could find. I used 12 oz. of Libbys peaches in light syrup out of a jar because there are no ripe peaches here now and because I wanted to try a little sweetness. I did use 1 tsp of hot sauce to compensate. Hatfield markets just the right size loins in cryovac bags. Make sure you get the ones marked 100% natural as opposed to the other ones they sell with sodium laden addititves. The sauce cooked up thick and rich and the loins browned nicely. My very talented mother in law raved about this dish and the kids loved it too. I will try this with ripe peaches and stick to the script and we'll see.

I used three dried chipotle peppers as that is what I could find. I used Libby's peaches with light syrup from a jar since I felt that was my best option this time of year. I used about 12 oz of them. To compensate, I used 1 teaspoon of hot sauce. The sauce cooked down to a rich consistency that browned well and had just enough sweetness and tang for the three kids eating with us. I got rave reviews from the adults. I found Hatfield markets 100% natural loins (as in no sodium laden additives although they market those too.) I know the purists out there will bal at this review, but I'm telling you this was real good!

I made this for Easter dinner and served it with the bourbon creamed corn. Everyone loved it and returned for seconds. The pork tenderlion I bought had added salt which gave it a little too much season taking away from the unique sauce...next time I will try one without any added salt

Made this for my family and friends - it received rave reviews. Fresh peaches were out of season so used peaches from a jar. The sauce was so good, I chose not to strain it and I believe it added character. Also baked it in a 350 oven since grilling season was also over. Definitely a keeper!

Our whole family really liked the BBQ sauce. I used frozen peaches I had left over from last summer and it worked well. I also made the bourbon creamed corn which was delicious as well.

Sauce wasn't worth the trouble. Adding peach preserves to BBQ sauce sounds better and easier.

This was great, but I made so many changes (because I read the reviews prior to beginning) that it did not resemble the original very much. I started with the base barbecue sauce for the "bourbon molasses drumsticks" (which I love) leaving out the dry mustard and using less molasses than this recipe suggest. Added some orange juice, hot pepper sauce and the diced peaches to my barbecue base. It was a rainy day so I baked the pork, and poured the sauce over for the last five minutes, peaches and all. Served with the corn recipe. Fabulous!!!

Very yummy and I agree that pureeing the sauce with all the ingredients is best. I did take out a couple of the peppers so it would not have too much hear. Really delicious and a nice change for pork!

I figured what the hey, why not try Tucson's EZ recipe. Despite one reviewer's reservation, the original has bottled ketchup so bottled bbq sauce seemed OK. Used raspberry preserves, KC Masterpiece Western Spicy, minced chipotles. Slow apple wood smoked the pork to 150 then towel wrapped it for an hour. Dynamite.

The pork was wonderful and very easy. The sauce turned out well too. I added a little brown sugar to mine. I made it with the corn, which everyone loved.

Great sauce! has a lot of spice so beware. Next time I may reduce the amount of black peppercorns. Relatively simple, can be prepared ahead so great for a dinner party. The Bourbon Creamed Corn is a must!

Yes, the sauce is very good. I was going to call the last poster a food snob, but her own "screen name" said it already . . . To "Madam Cuisinere," there are some decent "bottled sauces" out there, especially some of the artisinal producers.

Made this recipe for small dinner party and received rave reviews. This recipe is NOT difficult to make and the results are awesome! I also pureed and used 4 peaches. So, I did not have to thin the sauce. IF considering bottled BBQ sauce, why are you even on this site?! Will try the cider vinegar recommendation next.

Rating: 4
This is a very good BBQ Sauce. I also made a few mods. Only used 3/4C OJ and added 1/4C Apple Cider Vinegar. Also added one chopped Chiplote pepper. Also put sauce in the frig over night before straining. This would also work great with chicken. The new site looks and works great Epicurious.

A lot of Emeril type work for something so simple. I forget all the cooking. Get some bottled bbq sauce you like and a jar of peach preserves. Mix them half and half with a diced chipotle chile and a tsp of adobo sauce. Makes the same thing in 5 minutes. Red raspberry works great too. Wonderful on salmon.

We also made this by substituting the chile with chipotle and the peach with mango and it was even better.

This was quite good and interesting. Re: the website. While I agree this is not the place to discuss, I offer this observation: The pop-ups, etc., may be annoying, but who do you think pays for this wonderful resource. We don't. Think of all the money we save not buying magazines, etc. Someone has to foot the bill! Guess who? Advertisers!

Delicious, but not easy or quick to prepare. I left a couple ingredients out so that folks that don't like "hot" sauces could enjoy it too. It was wonderful, tasty, tender, and very different from any other pork tenderloin recipe I have and I have many great one. Served with fresh asparagus, and a rice pilaf with a bit of the sauce on it. Scumptioudeliocious. Yummmmmmm

I made this last night and it was wonderful. Did not change a thing. Just have to stay that I agree with the two viewers that I do not like the new Web site. Also, am very tired of the pop-up window advertisements for Orbitz, South Beach Diet, etc. It is totally unwanted and obtrusive.

This was great. I made a few changes that I recommend. First, used a chipotle chili instead of the chili referenced in the recipe. I like the smoky taste of chipotles. Also, instead of straining the sauce, I pureed the whole business. Needed a little thinning, but otherwise was a great way to go. Really retained all the flavors of the ingredients. A little spicy for the 7 year old, though.

Fantastic. Very easy to make, and a crowd-pleaser, even the little kids enjoyed it. The sauce can easily be used with other pork or chicken recipes. I used an extra arbol chile to add more heat.

Rating: 2
Really a 2.5. Made sauce as directed, except used home-canned peaches instead of fresh, and the result was good, but a little flat. It needed more smoke and bite. I am prepared to spend a long time tinkering with this recipe, because I think it has the potential to be sublime -- I think I will try adding a few chipotle chilies, and maybe using apple cider instead of OJ. Oh yeah, I put the sauce on pork chops instead of tenderloin and it was just fine, and more feasible for a weeknight.

Had this at a dinner party, along with the bourban corn, and both were wonderful. The pork was great, and all the flavors work well together. Nothing to complain about on this recipe...but I will complain about the new Epicurious format...ugh!
