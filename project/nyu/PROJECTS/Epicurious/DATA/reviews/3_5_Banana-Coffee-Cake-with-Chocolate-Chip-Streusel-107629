I made it as is, but we found it really sweet. The chocolate almost overwhelmed the cake. Next time I would definitely half the amount of chocolate. I might just half the entire streusel amount. For something different I am thinking of adding some coconut to the streusel mix.

Really delicious. HOWEVER, when you double the recipe and make it in a bundt pan, you need to put the streusel on the BOTTOM of the pan before pouring in the batter. Yes, some of us think we're so smart until we realize how dumb we are.

WAY too sweet!! I love chocolate and have a very sweet tooth, but I would halve the streusel recipe next time. Otherwise, it was yummy and we ate the whole thing.

This cake is fantastic. I followed the recipe for the most part, but I used twice the amount of the bananas. I didn't use cinnamon and I substituted plain 0% Greek yogurt (Fage) for the buttermilk. Next time around, I'll probably use half the white and brown sugar, 4-6ox of chocolate chips. It is delicious. I'd serve warm if you can - let cool for 3-4 hours. I feel like it's more of a dessert and I'm serving it as such with milk.

This was REALLY good cake!! My husband who is a banana bread lover thought it was very yummy also. I doubled the recipe except the streusel. I also accidently used only the half amount of brown sugar than the original recipe calls for. I baked in a removable bottom round pan since I wanted be able to see the streusel on the top of cake. Definitely a keeper!!

I served this as a New Year's Day dessert after dinner and hence was generous with the chips. It was a HUGE hit with the crowd - super moist and the streusel in the middle was fantastic - also I only had 2 large (very ripe) bananas and that was plenty. It's quite easy to prepare - for sure this will be made again!

Like many others I doubled the batter and baked in a bundt pan. Got rave reviews from all who ate it.

deffinanly should be made in a bunt pan. it looks much nicer and has more of a coffee cake appearance. to make this cake non dairy. i used non-dairy semi sweet chocolate chips,Earth Balance butter, and almond milk instead of butter cream. i used pecans instead of walnuts and used about 3/4 the streusel. cake came out awesome and moist ive gotten great reviews. ill be making this again

I made this last night for my family and co-workers and boy I have to control myself from eating it.It tasted so good when its warm. I doubled the recipe (except for the streusel) and baked it on a dark coated springform pan for 1hr 10 mins at 325* and added an extra heaping of cinnammon to the streusel. Yumilicious! 7 year old approved, teenager tested and my hubby loves it!

I successfully attempted this recipe to acclaimed reviews from my family of tasters. I had read other reviews prior, so I made a few modifications: I reduced the choc. chips (1 cup instead of 11/4); I also substituted Spelt flour making this coffee cake gluten free. Also, I added a 2 TBSP of reice flour to the streusel mix. Lastly, I added a splash of pure vanilla extract to the batter mix. Thank you to Jennifer MArtin for the original inspiration and to all the reviewers' commentary and suggestions. mmm, mmm, good indulgence. SachaFernandes.com

I previously reviewed this recipe in 2009, but I needed to comment about the reviewer that said they doubled the batter recipe and put in into a bundt pan. Thank you, disorientasian, for making a good recipe even better. I don't know why I hadn't considered this myself. I will never make it in a square pan again! The cake looks better, tastes better, cuts better and the streusel isn't overpowering the coffee cake. I'm thinking that a loaf pan would also be a better choice than an 8x8 pan. It did take longer to cook and kept in oven with oven turned off while they both cooled together.

The cake came out moist and delicious. I used frozen bananas that I thawed and drained any excess water. I also used the same amount of plain yogurt instead of buttermilk. Next time I would also add a little less brown sugar and maybe some melted butter to the topping, it needed something to bind it together a bit more.

Rating: 3
I tried this recipe with a few alterations. I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of 1/4 teaspoon; you'd be surprised how much salt can do for your baking. If you've ever had something without salt, you know that the flavors are flat. Also, I added a teaspoon of vanilla. I then used half white sugar and half brown sugar in the batter. I didn't have any chocolate or nuts for the streusel, so I just added oats instead. It turned out tender and flavorful and I will definitely use this recipe whenever I have extra bananas.

Rating: 4
Oh my goodness!! Yum! This recipe is definitely sweet, so if you don't like sweet, you'll want to cut down on the streusel some (half?). With that said, I really loved it. Making it again, which I will, I'd cut down on the chocolate a little bit (is that really being written by me?!) but keep the cinnamon/sugar ratio. BTW, I cut wayyyy back on the butter--I used about 3-4 tablespoons applesauce and only 1 TBSP of butter. It still tasted great and I found the streusel more than made up for the butter I took out.

I made radical adjustments to this recipe based on previous reviews (so if you're a recipe purist, you should just go now). - Doubled all the batter ingredients except the sugar. - Made only a single recipe of the streusel, reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp. - Used semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. - Baked in a 350 oven for 1hr 15min in a bundt pan with a removable bottom. The cake rocked it. Oh hell ya! It was quite sweet (but not cloyingly so) and amazingly moist. Using the bundt pan was a nice touch when cut. Very pretty. The only thing I might do differently the next time, and you can bet there will be a next time, would be to up the cinnamon to 2 tsp and add some flour/butter to the streusel to make it more pebble crumby.

Delicious! The cake is so incredibly moist and light, it makes a great snack, even without the streusel. Great suggestion to cut the sugar in the cake. Next time I will double the cake batter -- and use mini chips. The regular ones are a bit overwhelming because they don't completely melt.

Yummy! I doubled the cake batter and did 1.5 times the streusel and put it in a 9x13 pan. I also cut the sugar by 1/4 cup. Very moist cake- the cinnamon is lovely in the streusel. I bake a lot and this one is a keeper.

I have made this a few times, and everyone goes crazy for it! I follow the advise of others and double the cake batter because there is so much streusel, and use a 13x9 dish. I also like to add coarsley chopped strawberries to the banana and buttermilk mixture. They add a nice burst of flavor here and there. I leave out the walnuts since there are a lot of people I know with nut allergies. I will definitely continue to make this recipe!

Took this to a potluck. Everyone asked for the recipe. Great use of RIPE bananas. Took the advice of other reviewers and used yogurt in place of the buttermilk. (did not have it anyway). Added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Did not have chocolate chips, so I placed some milk and dark chocolate candy bars in the food processor. Pulsed a couple of times and it worked great. I think the taste of the bitter-sweet dark chocolate offset the sweetness. I also placed the majority of the strudel mix in the center. Thanks for that suggestion. Moist and delicious.

I doubled the batter( used a 9x13 pan)and used yogurt instead of buttermilk. I omitted both the nuts and brown sugar, opting instead to sprinkle the chocolate chips in the middle and on top. This seemed to cut the sweetness a bit leaving the coffee cake the right amount of sweet and moist.

Rating: 4
A very easy to make cake that tastes a lot more complicated than it is. I had all the ingredients available in my pantry except for the buttermilk (seems like a waste to buy buttermilk when you are only using several tablespoons) - I solved this be adding an extra tablespoon of butter and using the milk (1%) in the fridge. When making next, I will make sure to put more of the streusel mix (especially the choc. chips) in the middle of the batter rather than on top as I found it rather messy to cut into with the chips and walnuts breaking off. Delicious with coffee and will be making this soon for my next dinner party (everyone that tried it at my workplace has asked for the recipe).

A great recipe for using up ripe bananas and buttermilk. Both times I've made it as a dinner dessert and got rave reviews from guests. Following other reviewers' suggestions, I reduced chocolate chips to 1 cup, brown sugar to 1/2 cup, and sugar to 1/2 cup. Even with these changes, it really is a very sweet dessert cake, not a breakfast coffee cake. The second time I made it, I used coarsely chopped semisweet chocolate (leftover from another recipe) for the middle streudel layer, which worked fine.

Awesome, awesome coffeecake! I was making it for my daughter to bring into her first day back at her summer job during college summer break and she wanted something really good. As another reviewer mentioned, I also doubled the recipe (wanted a bigger cake) , using a 13 1/2 x 9 1/2 GLASS baking dish and would recommend a few accomodations for the change in size. I used the exact same ingredients as the recipe (no changes) just doubled them. It took about 60 minutes to bake and I started watching it at 45 minutes but center was not near done yet. I would not double the streusel for the larger cake, as I had over 1 cup left that I didn't even use, and was glad I didn't because there was TONS of streusel in the layers and the first layer of streusel was so much that, that the first layer of batter underneath really didn't rise that much - it looked like the streusel was almost all the way at the bottom (didn't affect look or taste). I would probably put 1/3 streusel on first layer of batter, and then put the last 2/3 of streusel on the top so that the bottom layer of batter has a chance to rise. This cake tasted so delicious - not only was it extremely moist and rich, but through all the streusel, you could taste the banana. As the recipe author wrote, make sure that you used bananas that are extremely ripe - mine were past just brown spots; they were almost completely brown and oh so sweet and aromatic!! I will make this coffee cake again and again; that is how good it is!

I made this recipe exactly as written, with the exception of reducing topping per previous reviews. It was good -- good enough to present to my boyfriend's mother when meeting her for the first time on Mother's Day -- but not good enough to make again for myself. I'd rather a sweet gooey loaf of regular chocolate chip banana bread. However, everyone else loved it, and the recipe "works" -- no alarms and no surprises.

There is nothing wrong with this recipe. Used a glass pan as my metal one was busy. Made no modifications and it turned out perfect. It is decadent and wonderful and a good way to have bananas for breakfast. I even used bananas that weren't ripe enough. Oh, I did the order different since they weren't all that ripe - smooshed them in after the butter.

This is a deliciously moist coffeecake that was very popular. I did make a few modifications after considering the suggestions from previous reviews. First, I reduced the sugar in the batter to 1/2 cup from 3/4 cup. Second, I reduced the chocolate chips to 1 cup from 1 1/4 cups. Third, I baked the cake in a 9 inch cake pan with 2 inch sides. The cake turned out pefect and was big hit.

I doubled the batter and baked for 60 min in a 9x13" pan instead. I substituted 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 c of the butter. Reduced sugar to 1 c. for the doubled recipe. Toasted the nuts before chopping for streusel, omitted chocolate chips and used flake coconut in its place. Other than the top being a bit darker than I had hoped, this is a very wonderful cake - moist, tender crumb, interesting textural changes from the nuts and coconut. Banana flavor is very pronounced but not overpowering to the other flavors. Can't wait to serve this to my friends tonight.

A very good and moist cake. Since several reviewers claim the streusel is too sweet as written, I decreased the brown sugar by half and also used a bit less chocolate chips and cinnamon. The result was a yummy cake that makes a nice afternoon treat with coffee, tea or a big glass of milk. Oh, and the cake tastes EVEN better the day after baking. : )

This was a very tasty cake. Like most other reviewers noted, it is very sweet. It is more of a dessert than a breakfast food. It is not the cake that is too sweet, but rather the streusel topping. Next time I would reduce the brown sugar in the topping by a bit, but not the chocolate chips or the nuts. Clearly the point is total chocolate decadence and you either like that or you don't.

I love this recipe just as written; however, I have developed a banana allergy and a cholesterol problem! I substituted pumpkin for the banana, applesauce instead of butter, and butterscotch chips instead of chocolate. I also used 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour, 3/4 cup all-purpose flour. I think the streusel in the middle makes it too gooey, so next time I would simply use half the amount over all the batter. Anyway, my husband loved it and didn't detect any of the missing ingredients. The brown sugar melts into a crisp caramel "brulee" topping, which I love!

This cake was very good, even with using only 2 bananas and saco buttermilk. However, next time I would use 3/4 - 1 cup of chocolate chips. The chips over powered the cake and made it a little too sweet.

I cut the sugar in batter to compensate for the overwhelming sweet (and additional chocolate chips) in the streusel. It wasn't too sweet, but the batter was rubbery and lacking in taste. Combined with the streusel it was overly rich, and not in a satisfying way, and very unlike a coffee cake.

I agree that this is quite rich, but I think it'll be perfect with coffee tomorrow. That's if I can get it to fully bake in the center, as I just realized 1/2 hour out of the oven that it's not fully baked yet! The outside edge is very yummy. I found it difficult to test the center with my cake tester and not hit a melted chocolate chip every time. It's going back into the oven in a few minutes, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed! :)

We really liked this! I loved the interplay of the chocolate and cinammon. That made it a little unique. I took other reviewers comments and made it in a springform pan, increased the batter by 25% and cut the struesel in half. The thought the porportions were perfect. I subbed yogurt for buttermilk with no problems. Only problem I had was I didn't cook it long enough. If you cook it in a sprinform and increase the batter be prepared to let it cook MCUH longer than stated! I had to cut the gooey middle out so it was like a tube cake. I filled w/ chocolate chips so it didn't look quite so bad. Still tasted great though! I think this recipe would be perfect as dessert for a brunch.

I had only one banana left. It was ripe beyond what anyone in the house would eat, so I decided to take a chance and use it in this recipe. Great choice! Not the usual oily banana bread. I spooned the top layer of batter over the streusel, then used a spatula to smooth it out, just like putting frosting on a layer cake. I used a 10" springform pan and used all of the streusel, half in the middle and half on the top. With lots of surface area to cover, it wasn't too much. I baked this late at night, for about 40 minutes, and left it to cool overnight. We had this for breakfast in the morning. Wonderful!

Wasn't sure if the site would allow me to post a second review, but I see it did; I am the prior NJ poster. I had to come back and give it 4 forks. Days 2 and 3, it's still wonderful, and in my experience, fruit breads (which i never refrigerate), especially banana, begin a rapid decline beginning day 4. In 30+ years of baking, this is one of the best cakes I have ever made--and I bake twice weekly, on average. Moreover, it looks like something from a magazine or good bakery. Prior to finding this, my #1 favorite recipe of all on this site was Banana Coffee Cake Diamond: a chocolate-espresso bundt, very simple, and unbelieveably great. I'd say that they are equally excellent, and those of you who want a plainer snack cake will very much like that recipe. rib, I feel for you, but this format doesn't allow a way that I could help.

I'm very happy to have found this recipe! Not only is it easy and delicious, but made in a 9" springform pan, it has a wonderful presentation. In all fairness, however, I agree that its richness makes it more of a dessert cake than a "coffee" (snack) cake. Next time I am going to sub cocoa for the chips in the middle layer and only use chips on top. After reading reviews, I decreased the streusel by 1/3 while increasing the batter by about 25-30% because I had five over-ripe medium bananas--about 2 cups--to use up. I used half AP flour and half WW pastry flour, and subbed nonfat yoghurt for the buttermilk. One thing I didn't see mentioned: I found that a small inverted spatula was essential for getting the somewhat gooey/sticky batter evenly spread for both layers, but especially over top the middle streusel layer.

My cake came out heavy and almost raw at the bottom. I used the right size pan and the correct ingredients, minus the cinnamon. I used half the streusel, but all of the nuts and that part was perfect. Why do my fruit-based cakes come out raw on the bottom? I would appreciate any expert advise. My pastries, cookies, and meat roasting projects always come out perfect. But cakes are almost always a flop unless I use a box mix. The box mix cakes are so inferior. I'd like to learn the right way to make a banana or apple cake. The Cake Bible is usually a good source for me, but even her banana bread comes out heavy for me!

Love chocolate, tolerate cooked bananas, but this was delicious. As suggested by previous reviewers that the streusel was too sweet, I used 1/2 cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.

I only wish I had listened to other reviewers who suggested reducing amount of streusel. I would cut the streusel to about 1/3. There isn't really enough dough to put it inside, so I'd skip it the next time, and just put it on top.

There is no such thing as too much chocolate! The other comments were correct, it's a lot sweeter than your usual coffee cake, but what an incredible treat. I made it for our group of girlfriends and we all thought the chocolate chip quantity needed no adjustment.

While I liked this recipe alot, to me it was too sweet for coffee cake. Next time I will cut bake on the streusel and the some sugar since using really ripe bananas adds alot of sweetness.(My bananas always end up REALLY RIPE) I did love the cinnamon, banana, chocolate combination.

I added an extra banana when making the recipe and I stirred the streusel mixture right into the batter. I then poured the batter into two loaf pans and baked. This recipe was a big hit as a banana bread!

The coffee cake was delicious but the streusel was really overpowering. I think just using the streusel as a topping would be much better, though I prefer just plain chocolate chips and nuts.

Don't worry about fussing with changes to this recipe. Make it as published and you will love it. This is the best way to use up your ripe bananas and the added bonus is you're popping it in the oven in a matter of minutes.

I experimented with a lot of different suggestions from the reviewers but I found this combination to be perfect. Bake in Bundt pan, use 50% extra batter, add 5 tbsp of sour cream (yes on top of 5 tbsp buttermilk)and use 12 ounces of choc chips instead of the 8oz. I only use brown sugar and I used 1 cup for the batter since I increased the size of the batter. I put the streusel 1/3 and 2/3 down the cake. Whatever extra streusel remains, I melt it with 2 semi sweet squares of chocolate and drizzle on top. This cake is AWESOME, every time. Bananas have to be ripe so leave out in the sun if they don't have brown spots. This recipe is guaranteed killer! Super moist, super flavorful and although its chocolatey its not overwhelming. The extra batter and the sour cream is a must.

I love this, and so had everyone who I have baked it for. Yes, it is sickly sweet - but that's what is so good. If you make it and don't like it, send it to me instead of throwing it out!

I made this recipe over the holidays and had DEMANDS for the recipe! After making it the first time I agree that the recipe is rather sweet as is. I doubled the coffe cake batter recipe but only used 2/3 of it with all of the the topping. I mean it when I say the DEMANDS have not stopped for me to make it again and again.

I made this cake for a brunch with some friends. Everyone tasted it but did not rave about it. In my opinion it was layered with too much sugar, cinnamon and chocolate. Just too sweet, like candy. Even the chocoholics did not care for it. I prefer a coffeecake with cake texture and some flavoring swirled throughout the cake. I have never given a recipe on this site the lowest rating but this did not meet the standards that I am used too. Very disappointed.

Rating: 0
All the previous reviews have such a high rating, I feel bad that I have to give this the thumbs down. This was terrible, way too sweet. And I even cut down on the sugar & only used 2 bananas. Took 3 bites & the all the rest went into the trash.

I just made the recipe this afternoon, it is wonderful. I did however made a few changes. Instead of chocolate chips, I used a chopped up Nestle's Crunch bar, hazelnut instead of walnuts and susbstituted sour cream for the buttermilk, then baked it in a round spring form pan. Very moist, and not too sweet. Will definitely make it again. Great with coffee!!

My family loves this!! I do cut down on the chocolate and use chucks as they don't get quite so melty. It reminds me of the old frozen "Sara Lee" bananna cake(which is not made any more). Great recipe!!

I really liked this cake. Not so crazy about the "streusel" so next time I think I just mix the chocolate chips throughout.

Rating: 3
I wasn't so crazy about this recipe but other people (including my mother and boyfriend) really loved it. Even after cutting down the sugar to 1/2 cup, and using only 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, I found the cake (not the strusel, mind you) far too sweet. As other reviewers recommended, I made only half the amount of strusel, and it was still a very generous amount. It wasn't a great strusel by any means and to give it some texture and eye appeal, I added an extra 1/3 cup of walnuts on top, with a bit of extra brown sugar drizzled with melted butter - turned out gorgeous and actually improved the flavor quite a bit. One thing that confused me was the consistency of the dough. I made it exactly as told and it had a curiously springy, elastic feeling almost as though it was a yeast bread dough. It was really hard to spread evenly but it tasted fine, so don't worry about it. Anyway, an okay recipe, worth making as its light cake texture is a nice change from heavy banana bread. Next time I'll make it in a springform pan for appearance's sake.

This cake was very moist and delicious. It received rave reviews from many family members who keep requesting that I make it again. I also recommend using the mini chocolate chips. I can't wait to have this again!

Killer recipe!! To all of those who said that there was too much streusel and chocolate... NO WAY!! If you are a chocolate lover, you don't want to change it. I made a couple of small modifications and it turned out absolutely delicious. First of all, I added one additional banana. I did not have buttermilk so I added some vanilla yoghurt instead and I also added a little maple extract. This is a great tip for giving your muffins or loaves a great flavour. The cake was very moist. I will definately make this one again.

The house smelled divine while this was cooking! However, I thought the cake was too sweet with all that chocolate and sugar. Next time I will only use one layer in the middle, and perhaps cut the amount of white sugar in the cake mix. I will definitely make some version of this again!!

I didn't think this could be much different than banana bread with some streusel, but it was quite a bit better - much more cake-like in texture. I baked mine in a bundt pan and it worked fine, but caused me to use less streusel (it can really only go in the center that way - it doesn't work well to go in the pan first and you don't want it to go in last because it ends up on the bottom), but it worked out fine because there was plenty of streusel anyway, and with the extras that I had, I just made a second cake!

I've made this cake 4 or 5 times now and it is always a big hit. Tips: omit the buttermilk, use mini chocolate chips and bake in a springform pan. It comes out looking and tasting like a cake straight from a gourmet bakery.

This seemed more like a breakfast cake, or a coffee cake than what I expected it to be. It tasted fine, and I served it on 2 occassions to good reviews, however I didn't love it myself. Also, the strusel seemed to over-brown while baking and I didn't think it was especially attractive. I would consider making it again, for a brunch as rather than as a dessert.

Wonderful! Not too sweet, but perfectly moist. I make this by doubling the cake mix and baking in 2 8-inch springform pans. Very well received. Try it!

I made these as muffins, putting the streusel in the middle. This makes a huge amount of streusel and can imagine as a regular coffee cake it would be too much (as it was for the muffins). Found the cinnamon overwhelming and will cut that in half next time. The batter appeared too dry and I added a couple extra TBL of buttermilk. Will make again with these adjustments. INCIDENTALLY, for any leftover buttermilk, try soaking chicken breasts in it for a few hours (or overnight) before cooking. It makes chicken incredibly moist. Or use it for pancakes, chocolate cakes, muffins, etc.***

This was so rich and delicious! There was a little too much streusel toppping ... I had about 1/4 C left over after generously covering both layers.

Rating: 4
First a thank you to all the previous reviewers. One of the best things about the site is reading the reviews of the recipe BEFORE trying the recipe! I followed the main advice of decreasing the streusel to 50%. Also subbed mac nuts instead of nuts listed becaused I had them on hand. Had my husband bring this to work (I ask you who can diet with THAT in the house:) This was a great combination of flavors and textures looking forward to making this again!

Rating: 3
I agree with other cooks on less cinnamon and chocolate. I did not have an 8x8 pan, I had to use a 9x13, so I did not add a streusel layer in the middle. It still turned out fine, and my family loved it at our Easter brunch. Will definately make again with the changes and invest in an 8x8 pan!

Rating: 3
This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I would make a few adjustments though. I don't think you need as much streusel as they call for. I'd cut it down by maybe a 1/3. When you make this you want to be sure you get enough batter and streusel on the bottom half. I was hesitant because I didn't want to run out of batter and have holes on the top layer. I ended up with a thick top layer and way too much streusel on the top. It tasted fine, I just think it would have been better had I put more streusel in the middle. I made this cake the day before my party. In hindsight I think I would make it up the day of the party, and then pop it in the oven when dinner was being served. I think it would be really great right out of the oven.

I followed this recipe exactly and made it for the "morning after" following a bachelorette party. Don't know if it was because we were an all female group, but no one thought there was too much chocolate. Everyone loved this.

Rating: 2
This was okay. The chocolate dominated the banana flavors and the first layer was so squished under all those layers of streusel, batter, and more streusel, that it didn't rise. In fact, the batter was still raw after 45 minutes and had to bake 15 min longer until done -- by then, the outer "crust" of batter and chips were burnt.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic! The only things that I did different was the addition of vanilla extract and an extra banana. Oh, and if I may comment on one thing. I hate reading reviews where the cook changed the entire recipe, made substitions because they didn't have an item on hand and then is compelled to rate some concoction they whipped up. If you don't like the looks of the recipe, DON'T make it.!

While the cake was nice and moist, I felt that there was way too much chocolate. I will make it again with half as much. I enjoyed the cinnamon/chocolate/banana flavor combination.

I made this with some changes, similar to previous reviewers, and the result was terrific. I added vanilla to the batter, cut the struesel in half,reduced the sugar by 1/3 and substituted light cream for the buttermilk. I also omitted the chocolate chips, not because they did not sound great, but because I did not have any and ran out of time to go to the store. Substituted flaked coconut and liked the result.

Chocolate and bananas are a combination I love so I was pretty sure I woudl like this rescipe. I made it for a gathering and there was nothing left! Everyone loved it! It was wonderflly moist and had just enough banana flavor. Since I did not have buttermilk I used light cream instead with o problems. I would recommend this!!

I forgot to add any buttermilk and expected the results to be less than great, but this cake was a winner. The cake was moist and flavorful-the streusel was very good. I will use mini chips as suggested by another cook, next time.

Rating: 2
Decide how much you like cinnamon before putting a whole tablespoon in the 'streusel.' I put in less than half the recommended cinnamon and my family thought it was distracting. Also I think the mini chips would work better in this recipe than regular-sized chips. This recipe would probably work better if you just fold in some mini chips into the banana cake batter. Faster to assemble, too.

i thought this was very good and all my friends and roomates raved about it. i used nonfat milk instead of buttermilk because i am a cheap college student and don't think it's worth the money for just 3 tbsp. i think next time i will reduce the amount of streusel or maybe like other reviewers double the cake but not the streusel. i also suggest using one more banana with any banana recipe because it always tastes better to me with an extra one thrown in.

Rating: 2
I was a little hesitant about the banana-chocolate combination, but I wound up really liking the streusel. Unfortunately the cake itself was very lackluster... not much banana flavor... not nearly as tastey as an average loaf of banana bread. My family didn't particularly care for this recipe.

Just like other reviewers I doubled the batter recipe and added vanilla, kept the streusel the same and baked in glass 9x13 dish. It turned out great, a few too many chocolate chips, will cut back next time but all in all very tasty and cinnamon was perfect!! I've already been asked for the recipe! Highly recommend!

I've made this 4 times for tea parties, and the cake turned out fabulous each time! I reduced the sugar for the batter to 1/2 cup, and the struesel to 1 cup, otherwise it would've been too sweet. I also substituted the buttermilk with fresh milk. To enhance the flavour, I added a tsp of vanilla and banana essence: PERFECT.

Excellent! Is too much chocolate actually a "problem" for some people? I made this exactly as written but next time would cut back a bit on the streusel topping because it was very sweet, Very moist and delicious and I was not a big banana, chocolate, cinnamon fan...until now! The cake is even better at room temperature (or the next day) so next time I will let it cool off before I dig in! I'm planning on making it again for a women's retreat in late April.

I made this cake with the other reviewers' comments in mind. I used mini chips and reduced the amount of chocolate somewhat. I also have a family member that is allergic to nuts so those were ommitted. The cake was flavorful and moist. My kids loved it and I will definetly make again.

Rating: 3
I made the cake only, _without_ the streusel. The only changes I made to the cake were 1) to use light brown sugar instead of white, and 2) to add some vanilla with the buttermilk and banana (what's a cake without vanilla??). I made this in the 8x8 pan as directed, but instead of a streusel I scattered toffee chips over half the batter and then over the top. When unmolded from the pan, with the edges trimmed, I frosted with a sour cream-chocolate ganache frosting and cut into small squares--it made an excellent snacking cake.

Rating: 2
I only say I'll make this again because my kids told me to! Personally I think the cake itself is incredible! I really don't care for the streusel at all. I was worried that the amount of cinnamon would overwhelm (and I did only make 1/2 the streusel, in response to most of the previous posts), but it doesn't. The problem (for me, at least) was the chocolate and nuts. They just seemed to detract from the whole thing. I'd like to make this with a traditional streusel, or, better yet, make as layers, with a nice cream cheese icing...... Perhaps those who did the bundt pan have the right idea. Use a streusel (minus chocolate and nuts) in the middle, and then drizzle with icing. I'll let the kids re-make as written if they want, but I'll just use the cake part in the future.

Rating: 3
Delicious, rich. Maybe too much cinnamon but dense and flavorful. The chips on top don't stick to the cake, so expect a trail of chocolate bits leading away from the plate. Maybe the mini-chips would work better.

Excellent recipe. I made in a bundt pan with 1.5 batter and 1 struesel. The struesal went in the middle and on top of the cake (which became the bottom) and when inverted I pressed more on the top. The cinnamon/banana/chocolate was awesome. I do think I'll try the cake with a few different struesels/icings as I thought this one was excellent but a less rich topping would be nice. Added some sour cream and extra buttermilk for an extra moist cake - delish!

This recipe was very moiste, but too sweet for my taste with the chocolate, cinnamon/sugar and banana combination. I think it would be good for a brunch (for guests with a sweet-tooth), but my family didn't really care for it. I agree with the idea of cutting back on the chocolate.

Rating: 4
WOW!!! I'd like to leave it at that, but I guess I should tell you what I did. I omitted nuts (a member of my family is allergic); I used 3/4 of the light brown sugar; I used freezer bananas (black); I used a square glass pan; and I used most but not quite all of the streusel. Everybody--ages 11 to 88--loved the result. Texture and taste are both great. I make very few recipes more than once, but this one I've promised to make again soon. I plan to enter it in the cooking contest at work, too.

Rating: 3
The next time I make this (the cake is fantastic--so moist and flavorful), I will only use the chocolate chip mixture in the middle layer, and forego the top layer. So much chocolate really distracts from the delicate flavor of the cake (you really have to like chocolate A LOT). This seems to be a matter of preference, though, as there were many fans who liked it just the way it was.

Made as written, We felt the banana cake portion had merit,but were not that taken with the chocolate/banana combination. Would probably make the cake with a streusel topping but without the chocolate chips if I make this again.

I don't usually give 4 forks, but this was outstanding. The only substitution I made was to add half & half in place of the buttermilk. Followed the advice of the reviewers and doubled the cake batter ( I had a LOT of brown bananas!) and left the streusel recipe alone. This, baked in a 13" x 9" pan, was perfect. Lovely and moist, with EXCEPTIONAL flavour. I'll make this for a company dessert and serve with a scoop of banana ice cream on the side drizzled with chocolate syrup. Of course, the cake (and it IS cake, folks, NOT coffee cake!) stands alone beautifully as well. Thanks to all who reviewed!

Rating: 3
Coffee cakes have never been my favourites, but this on really is great. The sum is certainly greater than the parts. I followed previous advice and made only half the struesel and it was fine. Lovely banana-ey flavour. I think this recipe will replace good old banana bread whenever I have a few brown bananas in the freezer.

The first time I made this, I followed the directions as written and thought it was great. The second time I put in a couple of tablespoons of pure maple syrup. I also had some leftover brickle chips, so I cut the chocolate chips back to 3/4 cup and put in 1/2 cup of the brickle chips. It was very well received. One great thing about this cake is it stays fresh and moist for a long time.

Rating: 4
Don't usually give 4 forks, especially to something as simple as a "chocolate chip coffee cake", but this was outstanding. Save yourself some time and either double the recipe as one cook suggested or use the amount in the recipe and only use half of the streusel. I found the amount of streusel in excess of what was needed. My husband and three boys simply devoured this cake. We will certainly have it again.

I'm addicted to this cake. I've made it 3 times in the past two weeks. I too used a little less chocolate the 2nd and 3rd time.

I made this for a brunch at work, and everybody loved it! I used mini chocolate chips and buttermilk powder. I also omitted the nuts. It turned out great--very moist and chocolatey.

Pretty easy way to use up leftover bananas though now I am stuck with a full quart of buttermilk - LOL! My husband and I both thought it was ok, but I won't make it again.

I didn't find it overly sweet for an adult's taste at all, and I can see how many people would love this recipe "as is".

I made this in a bundt pan using 1 and 1/2 times the batter as suggested by another reviewer.

This looks nice but it's cloyingly sweet -- the so-called "streusel" topping is nothing but sugar, chocolate, and nuts. It's over the top, just too much of everything. Perhaps little kids would like this but it's not for adult tastes.

This is easy and rich and moist--there is an almost identical recipe in the Bed and Breakfast cookbook however it uses sour cream. Once in a while the bananas seem to make it fall. Very good, the cinnamon and chocolate are great. I double and bake in a 9 x 13 pan and cut squares. Works!

This was a chocolate lovers snack cake! I didn't have a metal pan, so I used a glass pan which worked fine.

I loved this recipe, very moist and full flavored. Of course using bananas that are well ripened is a must you will not get as much banana flavor from bananas that are only yellow and not spotted. I actually made these as muffins instead of in a cake pan. I used mini choc chips and cut the pecans into small pieces so they would be in proportion to the small cakes. I did add 1 tsp of vanilla to the recipe as well. I found that even though I used ample amount of the strusel layered inside and on top I ended up with a lot of left over topping that I used to make a second batch. I would cut down on the strusel recipe by 1/3 when making again. The recipe made about 15 muffins.

It was just a little too sweet as is (and this is coming from someone who likes to eat frosting by the spoon).

This cake was fabulous but with my minor changes. I doubled the cake batter recipe and baked in a 9x13. I left the struesel amount the same as given for the smaller pan and found the sweetness perfect. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and left out the nuts. I would have liked them, but not the kids. I was making it for them on once again another snow day. we all loved it and will be making it again. I also found the batter needed a good dose of vanilla.

I made this dish before bed, and brought it in to the office the next day. It was quick to make, and it held up nicely over night. I omitted the nuts and don't think the cake "needed" them. One of my coworkers thought it was too banana-y. I personally love bananas and chocolate together and think this was a nice way to enjoy both.

I wasn't wild about it (I'm not a huge banana bread fan), but my partner, who loves bananas, loved it.

Normally we like this kind of thing -bananas and chocolate are a good combo. Even though I reduced the sugar by half, this was still far too sweet. I won't make it again, there are too many delicous recipes of this sort to cook instead.

It's just glorified banana bread, of which I am not a big fan. I made this for my husband because he likes banana things and I had ripe bananas that needed to be used. My husband did not like this either.

I haven't made this as yet (although I plan to this weekend) - but I wanted to suggest the use of dried buttermilk powder. It's usually available in the grocery, near the evap and condensed milk. When using, you add with the dry ingredients and can use either water or milk for the liquid. This stuff keeps indefinitely in the fridge, and I think it's actually better than the buttermilk available commercially.

I have made this recipe three times already and love it as did my guests. Yes, there are a lot of chocolate chips but the cake is moist and full of flavour. I was never a big banana cake fan before, but I am now (but only with this recipe).

If you do not have buttermilk on hand and/or do not wish to purchase a carton that will be partially wasted, add 1 Tbsp. of vinegar or lemon juice to 1 cup whole milk to create your own buttermilk. It's a great substitution for the Real McCoy.

The cake was delicious, if a bit heavy on the chocolate chips! I omitted the walnuts, and wish I had read the suggestion to substitute yogurt for the buttermilk... I now have an entire containter of buttermilk, and need to figure out what to do with it!

I took one bite and fell in love! Everyone at work is asking for the recipe! I overdid it on the chocolate chips, but it was so delicious. What a good combo -- had no technical difficulties whatsoever, although I substituted yogurt for the hard-to-find buttermilk:-)

I would make this again, cutting the cinnamon and chocolate chips by half...too overwhelming for the size of pan recommended. I had to bake a little longer too...about 8 minutes extra. Although I thought it could be better, my coworkers loved it.

This cake sounds better than it is. Mine looked just like the picture in the magazine but it was a flop of a coffee cake. The chocolate chips didn't melt, the streusel didn't hold together, and the overall effect is one of disparate ingredients that just don't add up.

The first time I made it, it turned out fantastic! It got rave reviews at work. The second time it was not as good (a little drier), but it may have been operator error...

delicious. I didn't have metal baking pan close to that size, so i baked it in a bundt pan. The recipe was not the right amt to properly fill - so looks were just so-so, and it did come apart somewhat but very tasty, nonetheless. For company, I would get the right baking pan so appearance would be as good as taste.

This recipe looked enticing to make and proved to be really good -- it was enjoyed by all the guests -- great for breakfast, brunch or dessert.

I have made this recipe 4 times since it came out and am completely addicted! It's a great combo with the cinnamon, chocolate, and moist banana cake. I add another 1/4 cup of chocolate and serve it warm. It works great baked in ramekins about 20 minutes. The chocolate is oozy and amazing, a really decadent dessert.

A masterful dessert! we baked it in a 9x9 pan for 39 minutes and it was perfect.
