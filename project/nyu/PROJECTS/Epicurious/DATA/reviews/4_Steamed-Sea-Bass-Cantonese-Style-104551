I have more of a question than a review. I made this and the "sauce base" really had almost no liquid in it. Did I boil it too long? The ingredients don't have much liquid volume to begin with and many people said it was "too much oil" so I halved it. Maybe I shouldn't have done that? I like the taste of the sauce but there was very little of it and the dish was dry. Help in figuring out my error would be much appreciated. Thanks

Good but a little too sweet. Next time I'll cut this back to 1 teaspoon of sugar.

Olive oil? I don't think so. More likely safflower or canola oil. Otherwise similar to several recipes I have in other Asian cookbooks

so i made this last nite all excited to use my new bamboo steamer. wow, is that an easy item to use. i made the recipe as outlined except i didn't have any soy (!) which i didn't realize until i had the fish steaming and everything chopped. i made it anyway and it was actually very, very tasty. the fish was delicious with an extremely lite, fresh flavor from the sauce, yum! my husband loved it. we really didn't miss the soy but presumeably it is even better with it!

Being a fisherman, I'm able to do variants of this dish at will. Using a whole fish makes all the difference. In fact, when I'm given the frames (carcasses) of rockfish for use as dungeness crab bait, I'll split and marinate one or two heads with attached collars and then grill or steam them. The head and pectoral parts of these fish are the bomb.

This was really good. My husband said he could it the sauce every night with different fish/meats. I did add the soy when I boiled the other ingredients instead of pouring it over - it worked fine. Plan to make again and again.

pretty good recipe and so quick and easy to make. the only thing i would change is next time i won't put as much olive oil, maybe just 1/8 of a cup.

To the cook from Fairfax, in this dish, the "sauce" is supposed to be thin and is not a think sauce.

This recipe was tasty and very easy. The steaming method worked great with 2 filets using a standard vegetable steamer in a tall pot. The fish turned out moist and the sauce was flavorful. My only complaint was that the soy sauce ran all over the plate- maybe if cooked with the rest of the sauce, it would be thicker. Even my 21-month-old and my husband, who is not a fish fan, liked it.

Yumm and easy. Tho I love the presentation of a whole fish, filets with the sauce - which is really what makes it - could work as well.

Simple. Fast. Delicious. Nuff said.

This is a fabulous recipe. Because I don't have a steamer, I broiled the fish until just done and transfered the fillets to a dish and continued with the soy sauce and sauce. I sprinkled with black sesame seeds and garnished with frayed green scallions. Beautiful presentation and lovely taste.

This is one of my favourite recipes on epicurious. I've made it several times -- it is surprisingly authentic and never fail to impress the guests! I've simplified it, to similarly good results when making the sauce: Put the spring onion, garlic, ginger, cilantro in the blender. Use some of the oil to smoothen the blades if required. Then saute the mixture with shaoxing wine (instead of white wine), a tsp sesame oil and soy sauce. All you have to do just before serving is pour this sauce over the steamed fish! Yummy!

Making this dish again tonight, this time using black cod filets; seems that one sea bass is not enough for two adults or barely. Agree with everyone, cut the oil in half, and cilantro is a lovely addition in moderation. Fabolous dish, serve it with rice and sliced cucumbers marinated in seasoned rice vinegar + drops of sesame oil, marvelous combination.

I've tried many steamed sea bass dishes and this is by far my favorite. It makes me salivate just thinking about it! A dish from Shun Lee without having to pay for the expensive meal, what more can you ask for?

This is a recipe that allows the freshness of the fish to stand out; so if you have ultra fresh fish it will enhance your entre without smothering it in other flavors. Definitely cut the oil in half! I was afraid 'steaming' fish would water down it's flavor - it doesn't. This was delicious! I will add it to my favorites list.

This is a great way to have whole sea bass. My parents made a similar dish when I was growing up, and this dish is even better than that. It's very simple, and the results are wonderful.

Excellent recipe! I first tried this at a Chinese restaurant. Then a friend (of Chinese background) made this for her guests. I think this recipe competes with those wonderful experiences... (would reduce the oil as well)

My family loved the dish. Instead of regular white wine I used a chinese cooking wine. For those who do not like sweet food you can omit the sugar----it still taste great!

Just wahy shouldn't sea bass be steamed??!! It's a great recipe, instead of white wine i used soome kind of chinese cooking wine, hua tiao jiu or something like that..it's alot better than white wine

Although many people would think steaming Sea Bass is great, it dosn't appeal like it should to me. Sea Bass should be fried or baked, not steamed.

I made this recipe with the following changes: Make the sauce in a small saucepan, without the oil and scallions. After the fish has steamed, scatter the scallions PLUS 4 Tbs. roughly chopped cilantro over the fish. Heat the 1/4 c. oil in a small pan (a butter warmer works well)until it is smoking, then add a few drops of toasted sesame oil. Pour the hot oil mixture over the scallion and cilantro-covered fish, which sears in the flavor of the herbs. Then pour the prepared sauce over all and serve. P.S. Re: another reviewer's suggestion of cutting down the oil from 1/4 c. to 4 Tbs., did you mean 4 tsp.? If not, you're not cutting much!

Yummm! You can also poach the fish instead of steaming it and it comes out fantastic. I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and cut back on the oil.

Someone gave me a piece of fresh cought stripped bass. I didn't know how to prepare it so looked up ideas on epicurious. This was easy and delicious. I will surely make this again and look forward to sharing it with friends.

LOVE this recipe though it does have way too much oil, i would use only a few tablespoons of corn or safflower oil. Will definitely make it again.

Although I liked this recipe, it calls for way too much oil. Try peanut oil, and cut it down to about 3-4 Tbs. That's really all you need. Easy to make!

WOW! Before I go on about how delicious this was, let me say that I used filets instead of the whole fish. It was SO easy and this gourmet feast was ready in under 10 minutes. I pan seared the filets in peanut oil and also used peanut oil in the sauce. Pan searing the filets in peanut oil gave them the most beautiful crust and delightful taste. I sprinkled with soy sauce and poured the ginger sauce over top of that (per the recipe). I served steamed broccoli on the side along with the extra sauce. I can honestly say this was some of the BEST sea bass I've ever tasted and I'll be sure to make it for guests next time around. FOUR FORKS from me!

Simple, quick. Has the flavor I wanted to duplicate after trying it at a restaurant. It would be excellent over a fried whole fish.

This was delicious and very quick and easy. I used a whole striped bass and canola oil (2 tbsp) instead of olive oil. It served 2 hungry adults as a main course. I will definitely be making this again - probably with fillets next time because they're easier to serve (although whole fish may have more flavor).

My husband made this and even the kids ate it. The portions are reflective of a side dish - He bought 2 Sea Bass and it just about fed 2 adults and 4 young children. Usually it is served as a side dish rather than as a main course. Also, Chinese do not use olive oil. They use corn or peanut. We used the corn and the result was delicious.

Not only is very good and is a very healthy way to cook fish, you can cook any fish this way,is better without the wine and surgar.
