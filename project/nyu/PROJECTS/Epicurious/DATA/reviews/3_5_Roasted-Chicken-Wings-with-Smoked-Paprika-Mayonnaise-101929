I was looking for a non-sticky wing recipe to serve with our ribs yesterday during SuperBowl. These were tasty, but not something I'd repeat - the marinade never became a glaze, even after I drained the fat from the roasting pan. The mayo dip was boring until I doctored it with ground chipotle, a bit of tomato paste, and a squeeze of lemon.

Great flavor and none of that vinegary heat. So flavorful you don't really need the dip.

This is one of my favorite wing recipes. I've made it many times. I use it in small-dish meals, or as an appetizer. The Spanish paprika is critical!

Skip the mayo dip if you prefer. It masks the delicious flavor of the wings.

This was delicious - made it for my Super Bowl tapas menu - too tired to make the mayo - will do it next time. The longer you marinate the better!!

I added some chipotle in adobo in the marinade, roasted the chicken in the oven with the marinade, and then thickened the sauce with flour on the stovetop to make it a red gravy. Don't bother with the mayonnaise sauce.

Made these as part of a tapas party menu and they were a hit! Double the dipping sauce - you'll need it

I couldn't get wings, so I cut up boneless, skinless chicken and made kebabs on skewers and brushed the mayonnaise on after cooking. Went over very well! Also, I got all three kinds of paprika from latienda.com, and used half medium, half bitter.

I stuck to the recipe and found this preparation tasty and addictive. It is essential that you use the right type of paprika; Hungarian will not do. If you must, a reasonable substitution for the paprika might be powdered chipotle.

This was NOT good. Smoked paprika is interesting, but this is not the recipe you want to use to explore its possibilities. If you want wings, try the Africana or the La Brea Tar Pit wings. If you MUST try this, cut the salt in half, and don't expect to be overwhelmed. You might try barbecueing, rather than baking in the oven, as well.

The unique flavors of the recipe make it a very impressionable meal that children like as well as adults. I make it with chicken strips and serve it as a part of a buffet meal

I've had much better wings. Perhaps I didn't use the right kind of paprika.

Easy to prepare and looks good on the table.
