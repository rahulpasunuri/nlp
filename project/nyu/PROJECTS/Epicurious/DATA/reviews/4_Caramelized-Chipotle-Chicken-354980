Absolutely one of the best recipes for cut-up whole chicken. As with any other recipe, be sure the parts are similar size when cooking all together (e.g., don't separate thighs from the legs). All pieces turned out succulent and juicy. Flavors are excellent and not overly spicy. Use the back bone for stock. Nothing is wasted. I served it with refried beans and a southwest green salad. Yummy!

This was good and spicy. I would prefer to do this on the grill next time or even use it on wings for chipotle wings.

Actually misread the recipe and put way to many chiles in it the first time. Which was still great but to hot. Made it again to spec and was awesome.

This recipe is made up almost entirely of pantry ingredients, which is great for those times when that's especially helpful. I start with the quantities listed minus 1/3 cup of ketchup, and then adjust to taste as it is cooking. I usually use just one cut up chicken, about 4-5 lbs, so there is extra sauce. I've made this several times, usually after I've opened some chipotles for a different recipe, but only needed a tiny amount and have almost an entire can left. So, this isn't really a special dish for me, but great weeknight fare.

I didn't have any ketchup so added tomato paste as I browned onions and then added half can of tomato sauce, maybe that's why it didn't have the ketchupy taste some complained about. Also I got distracted and used the whole jar of chipotles even though only was making half the sauce... yummm.

An outstanding meal for a casual dinner party with good friends, who in this case could not get enough of it. I used mostly adobo sauce from the remainder of a can of chipotles. Served it with a rice pilaf with garlic, black beans, corn, cumin & coriander (my own recipe), and the grilled zucchini and pepper salad - and for dessert, baked pears in maple syrup (both Gourmet). Perfect for fall in New England.

This turned out ok. I think it needs some modifications to be great (e.g., I wasn't so crazy about all the onion bits--should have minced not chopped, because the chicken pieces cook at different rates, some were too tough so I would just do drumsticks or just breasts, etc.) I don't know if it's worth tweaking this one, or starting with some other recipe A side note: I was worried about the heat. It was fine in this proportion. This from someone who likes only a few drops of tabasco on eggs or tapatio in tacos.

I have made this a regular item in my monthly rotation. My husband can't get enough of the sauce. I use thighs and breasts and have been very pleased with the results every time.

Overrated. This recipe is good practice for novice chefs (like me). Save yourself some time and just mix chipotle peppers with a store bought BBQ sauce.

few more things...used my hand blender to make it smooth, added a little cream and cayenne. I tried with a squeeze of lime and it wasn't my thing.

this recipe is fine. it's nothing special, but it's edible. the ketchup base of the sauce really overpowers all of the other great flavors, and that's what makes it average.

I have made this 4 times now. It is everyone's favorite! This past time I used a combination of skinless thighs and breasts that I marinated overnight in plain yogurt, which made it even more tender! It also cut the heat a bit. I always seed the chiles for that same reason. I had liquid smoke on hand, so I added a dash of that, which I will do again.The smells in the kitchen as the sauce cooks is heavenly! I make the sauce the day before, making the next day's meal a snap! This time I served it with potatoes boiled with garlic and salt, then mashed with sour cream, cream cheese and milk. We can always count on this large dish for leftovers for the 4 of us! You should try it!!!

I made this for my 4th of July BBQ and it was a huge hit. I brined the chicken parts (thyme, brown sugar, salt, water) for couple hours then rubbed the sauce all over for few more hours. I baked it half way in the oven then finished it off on a grill. I cooked 4 chickens and there were gone!

We loved the sauce. In fact, my son who loves things spicey said it could have had more peppers in it. I didn't chop the onions, sliced them thin because I used chicken cutlets so having the sliced onions and sauce over the cutlet worked very well. Or maybe I was lazy and didn't want to break out the food processor! I'm saving the sauce leftover in the pan, for BarBQ steak tomorrow!

This was fantastic. This is not your standard BBQ sauce, as some as suggested. It's much more complex than that. The only change would be blitzing it in a food processor before using. The pieces of onion don't work.

This tastes pretty much like chipotle peppers and barbecue sauce. I love chipotle peppers and barbecue sauce, so I thought it was great. Made as directed except sent the sauce for a spin in the processor first. Served with the Poblano, Potato and Corn Gratin from elsewhere on epi. Great fun had by all.

I don't eat meat but my husand loved this recipe. I may have added to many chipotle chilis because it was very very spicy but very yummy too!

I've made this several times using chipotles that a friend of mine preserves and cans which adds another flavor dimension. I've used the sauce on whole chicken and chicken pieces and it is simple and flavorful. I don't understand why taking out the garlic and putting it back in is necessary so I don't do it, just saute the onions and garlic together, plus I make the sauce in a pot rather a pan to minimize splatter.

Delicious! My boyfriend likes very spicy food, so I added habanero and jalepeno chiles with the garlic. It was too hot for me, but he loved it.

Really good. I put a little less brown sugar after reading a review that it was too sweet. I will make this again.

Very nice sauce, good kick! The amount is enough only for 1 chicken and not 2 as the recipe calls for.

Very clever, tasty and simple recipe. My one caveat is that several guests asked me which BBQ sauce I used ! Perhaps I'll reduce the ketchup and add jalapeno to get it less sweet (there is already brown sugar), and spicier.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and the sauce saved a low fat plate from seeming like diet food. We loved the kick of the sauce, but I barely simmered it for fear it would reduce too much. This one goes in my recipe box.

I found this recipe to be the best BBQ I've had since leaving the East coast. Easy to make and fun to see all the flavors come together. My boyfriend thought it was delicious and my co- workers begged for the recipe when I brought in left overs (even better a day old!) Definitely has a kick!

very good. I'm always looking for new ways to do chicken. I have to disagree with reveiwers who say this is just chicken with bbq sauce. the chipotle and cinnamon give it complexity and depth. I followed recipe, except added more adobo, used only leg quarters, and baked on a rack in a baking dish to avoid greasiness.

One of the best chicken recipes I have ever tried. I've made it three times since the magazine arrived at my door. The first time was almost too spicy, so I added chicken stock. The second time I removed all of the seeds from the peppers. Retained the smoky chipotle flavor- but no kick to it at all. third time I remove 2/3 of the seeds and it was nearly perfect. I thought this was great for tailgating.

Great sauce - I have cooked in the oven and also used as a BBQ sauce when grilling. Both wonderful. Have already made 3 times.

The flavor is wonderful. Yes, spicy on the lips but goes down easy, especially with a brown rice side dish. However, next time I'll adjust the temperature downward. Before I knew it, the sauce had burned on the top. Suggest starting at 450 degrees for 10 minutes and reducing to 350 degrees. Also, I sliced the onions rather than chopped and it made a nice contrast on top of the chicken pieces. (I used thighs instead of cut up chicken)

The sauce was very good - basically a barbecue with a little chipotle kick- but the chicken seemed pretty greasy. I think this might be better grilled, so the chicken fat could drain.

This was really good. The flavors were incredible. It was too hot for one of my guests but she took off the sauce and skin and said it was great. The rest of us loved the heat and sweet combo. I will definitely be making this again. Would be great on ribs!

Yummy sauce with a little bit of heat. It was a great use of chipotle peppers I had left over from another recipe. I think I'll puree the sauce next time, though.

This was good, but not any better than other barbecued chicken. Most likely would not go through the trouble of making this sauce again. If I did - I would make sure I chopped the chipotle finely, and not simmer the sauce so long - it became too thick to brush on easily. Also, would line the pan with foil. But most likely would try grilling it outside. And would only use the chicken pieces we prefer, not a whole chicken.

This was very popular with my guests - I think I was a little disappointed. The flavors listed are so robust I wanted more kick - two of my guests are spice-wimpy, so I added a skosh less chipotle in adobo than called for. My druthers would be to kick that aspect up. That said, big hit with the guests, nice with fresh farmer's market corn and roasted potatoes and cauliflower on the side. I can think of more exciting chicken dishes....

Made this for a dinner party. Everyone raved. As mentioned it makes a lot - so great if you have a hungry crowd or teenagers. Sauce was easy to make. I would not puree - I liked chunkiness of the sauce. I too was surprised how good this was just from the oven. Will make again for sure.

Outstanding flavor, easy to prepare. Next time I will grill the chicken on a charcoal grill using indirect heat.

I agree with everyone that this is a terrific recipe. I just wanted to add that I did throw everything into the blender and pureed it (as suggested by Ohio below). I think though, that if you choose to do this you should be sure to put it back in the pan to reduce well, otherwise it's too wet and the chicken skin will not crisp.

I love chipotle peppers but often find in recipes the smokiness can overpower all other ingredients, this was definitely the exception! The sauce was amazing, we spread the extra on our bread with dinner. I only had boneless skinless chicken breasts on hand and they worked out great, I just adjusted the cook time.

This was the first time that I worked with chipotle peppers, as I'm usually shy on heat, but mixed with the sugar, cinnamon and all the other lucky ingredients, it made for a perfect glaze with serious depth. Paired this with the creamy cilantro corn and they were quite the couple - complimenting one another just so. I think this would make for a fine rib glaze as well...yum!

Best BBQ chicken I ever made. The garlic equation is a little off...and when it was all said and done I kept thinking about putting the whole mess in the blender and spinning it into a nice puree. Next time for sure. It made a lot of chicken for eight. We had plenty for the next night and it was great then too.

So I'm halfway through the recipe md thinking "hey! this is a recipe for BBQ sauce!" It's a BBQ sauce I like, but surely there must be a way to add similar flavors to the chicken, and not just the skin. (My husband and daughter won't eat the skin). I think I'll try the brining idea, mabye with a dollop of the sauce in the brining liquid.

I did not think it was possible to make barbequed chicken in the oven and not on a grill--this recipe proved me wrong! It was absolutely delicious and my family loved it. I made 1/2 the recipe, using 2 chicken breasts, a drumstick, and a thigh. Although I prefer white meat, the dark meat was more tasty. I went a bit overboard on the chipotle and it was a little too hot, so next time I'll cut it back a bit--but it gave it a wonderful flavor. Great with very fresh local summer corn and tomatoes.

Rating: 4
Wow this was a fantastic sauce - deep, rich, complex - a keeper. Guests couldn't stop raving. We used bone-in chicken breasts and legs n thighs instead of a whole chicken and brined it for a few hours before tossing with half the sauce. Would be great with just the dark meat, or even boneless breasts - just not baked as long.

Rating: 4
Essentially this is a "barbeque sauce", but the chipotle/adobo lends an unusual depth and complexity that truly renders it spectacular. My only comment is that to get "abou 1/2 cup" of sliced garlic I had to slice up a whole lot more than 8 cloves. More like almost an entire head! -- but wouldn't skip it. Also the recipe feeds a LOT more than 6 people; we had a bunch left over (not a bad thing!) even with my two teenage sons digging in.

Really good, and very easy. Made only a half recipe, although I kept the same number of onions, and used all dark meat. Tastes almost barbequed. Will make again, often.
