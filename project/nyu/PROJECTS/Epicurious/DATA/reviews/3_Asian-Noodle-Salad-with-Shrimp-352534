The dish is okay, just not special. We did not find it too spicy, just too uninteresting.

Cold. Not very good. I was disappointed. I love healthy food, but this was a miss.

This is a great recipe, but I made adjustments to create a bit more complexity. It needed a lift. I grilled the shrimp and then tossed them into the dressing, which I didn't find too spicy, though I notice some comments on this board say otherwise. I added sliced mangos and a few drops of sesame oil to the finished salad, roasted chopped peanuts and scallions. I omitted the mint because I didn't have any. It was pure yumminess!

I was really skeptical while making this dish. The sauce didn't taste right. But once I put it all together the cilantro and mint really completed the taste. It was surprisingly good.

This is perfect for a hot summer night! It's also very easy to make. I added a bit of basil and a few peanuts on top. Next time I make it I'll cut back on the fish sauce a bit.

I added a couple drops of sesame oil to the noodles and sprinkled roasted cashews on top -- delish! You can prep your components early and keep all the parts in the fridge until dinner time. The layering is easy, and visually appealing. When you taste the dressing on its own, it's quite overpowering. But, when lightly drizzled over the salad it really complements the veggies and shrimp.

Overall the flavors were okay...nothing too special. I ended up adding some peanuts and a lot of veggies which only slightly improved the flavor. I also thought this was way too spicy. I hate to give it such a bad rating, but I think it was a waste of ingredients.

This recipe is quick, easy and delicious. That said, I did think it was missing something. I agree that roasted peanuts or sesame seed would be a good addition. I also added just a couple tsp of sesame oil to the dressing. Very good, and the leftovers are equally good. My husband and I will definitely be making this again.

made this per recipe, and it turned out great, except I used basil instead of mint. I actually cut the shrimp in half which was easier to eat, and halved the chili for my taste. I also mixed everything together beofre plating, instead of making each plate individual, and it was easier.Would reccomend to try.

Used 1/2 pkg of rice noodles instead of a whole package. Added 2TBSP Thai Sweet Chili Sauce, 1/2-1 tsp more sugar,and 3 cloves finely minced garlic and for added heat, SRIRACHA Hot Chili Sauce, to dressing. Brushed shrimp with dressing then grilled. After grilling I tossed shrimp with 1/4 c dressing and refridgerated. Used English cucumber,added 1/c Thai Basil, 1/2 c thinly sliced radishes, 1 c bean sprouts. I added toasted peanuts to the salad. Garnished with whole mint and a wedge of lime. It was very hot the day I made this salad and it was a cool refreshing dinner. My husband loved it. Will definitely make again

This was an excellent salad. The only modification I made was to use a standard cucumber as the store was out of Japanese/Persian. Will definitely make again. Next time, I may pull back on the chili garlic sauce (I went a little heavy with it, probably closer to 5T) and add the peanuts as mentioned. For a modification, I may also add some mango (the taste was quite similar to the shrimp mango summer rolls on this site).

This classic Thai dressing is made twice as good if you remember to sprinkle ground roasted peanuts over the finished dish. Make sure to roast them in a pan first so they go golden and nutty. You could also add fresh mung beans (beansprouts) and some chopped spring onion (green onion / scallion) to add a bit more zing.

Yummy & refreshing. Especially good the second day after being in the fridge and soaking up the dressing!

If you find an Asian sauce is too spicy for you, gradually add a few drops of rice vinegar until it's mild enough for your palate.

From what I am looking at now,on the website, the picture matches with the recipe. I am certainly going to try it.

This was a really easy and tasty. The only change I would make is less fish sauce - maybe 2 tablesppons tops. I added an extra teaspoon of sugar to counteract it. I also aprinkled with peanuts at the end. This will be a summer staple, rotating the veggies and protein according to what's available.

This was awful - don't waste your shrimp. I hope that there was an error in the ingredient list for the sauce, maybe it should be sweet chile sauce?? I love lime, but between the lime juice and the fish sauce, this salad was inedible due to the dressing (and I even added agave nectar to try to salvage it).

The photo on the website is for the Thai Green Curry with Seafood but the recipe is for the Asian Noodle Salad with Shrimp. In the magazine the photo matches the recipe. I made this delicious salad and it really does look exactly like the picture. I occasionally use chili-garlic sauce and know how hot it is and what a small amount is usually called for in recipes, so I reduced the amount to 1 teaspoon. I otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was still spicy and just about right for us. The salad is very fresh tasting and unusual-- something you might see in an upscale restaurant.

Thanks for that. I've been staring at the photo, the recipe, the photo, etc. trying to match them.

Small error here, I believe. In the magazine this dish is called THAI GREEN CURRY WITH SEAFOOD. I haven't tried it yet, but it looks good.
