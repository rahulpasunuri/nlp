It wasn't a bad recipe, but I thought it was too grainy. I think I like this but in VERY small amounts. Although it was easy to prepare, all of that peeling just wasn't worth it to me in the end. My fiance really liked it though and thought it would be a nice alternative to mashed potatoes. (I'd rather stick to the potatoes...)

This recipe is so yummy and the aroma is wonderful.

I love jerusalem artichokes and usually make them by blanching them and adding a lemon, oil,garlic dressing with parsley and they are delicous. This recipe destroyed the flavor of the artichoke and was a great disappointment - I feel that this recipe overcooks the artichoke and kills the special taste - I could have used potatoes to make this and the result would have been similar.

This was wonderful! I made it despite the fact that I only had two pounds of jerusalem artichokes and no parmesan. I omitted the butter and added a bit of olive oil instead. I kept all other ingredients and their quantities the same.

I happened to have a bumper crop of Jerusalem Aritichokes, and found this recipe which I made for Thanksgiving. It was wonderful! This one is going in my permanent collection.

This dish was part of a Christmas dinner, and was enjoyed by all. It's easy to make and smells great while it's cooking.
