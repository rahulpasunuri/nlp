Don't soak the raspberries and liquer in a bowl. Use a Ziploc type bag. Made a quick dessert with store- bought pound cake and homemade sweetened whipped cream. The pound cake loved soaking up the Chambord (that's what I used). Delicious, easy, and impressive.

Why is eveybody so harsh! Everybody has their own opinion. This recipe is just wonderful on it's own (especially in the summer when you want something light without the cake or calories). Try it both ways & decide for yourself.

This was simply lovely over homemade peach ice cream. Perfect end to a french country style dinner.

It seems as though several reviewers missed the original recipe that this sub-recipe was part of. It belongs to CHOCOLATE-CARAMEL TART WITH DRUNKEN RASPBERRIES AND VANILLA CREME FRAICHE posted elswhere on this site. Hope this helps!

This was so good over angel food cake w/ fresh whipped cream. An adult version of Strawberry Shortcake with a twist.

Agreed. Why?

And????? Okay so far as it goes, but this seems much less like a 'recipe' than a 'step' toward something much more delectible. After you've got the druken raspberries set aside, break a chocolate cake by hand into 1- to 2-inch pieces. Combine cake pieces with 1/2 cup raspberry liqueur and let soak for 1/2 hour. Beat 1 cup of heavy cream with 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tbs sugar (or Splenda alternative) until thick. Starting with chocolate cake, layer cake, whipped cream, and raspberries alternatly in a parfait dish. Dollop whipped cream and raspberries on top. Now, you've turned drunken raspberries into a dessert.

I agree with Toronto's comment to a point in that on it's own it doesn't make much sense. However, if Toronto had thought to look a little further, s/he would have found that it goes with Chocolate-Caramel Tart with Drunken Raspberries and Vanilla creme fraiche on this site. Why Epicurious didn't include the whole recipe is beyond me. I plan on making this as it looks delicious and will rate it then.
