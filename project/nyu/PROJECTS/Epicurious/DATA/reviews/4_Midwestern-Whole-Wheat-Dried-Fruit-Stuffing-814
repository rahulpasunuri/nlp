I made this for my first Thanksgiving hosted at my house with my in-laws. Now every year I am asked to make the stuffing weather it is at my house or a family members home. I have made it with a mix of wheat and pumpernickel bread to add variation. It is also great with pecans added. Great dish!

I make this every Thanksgiving (since 1994!) and everyone loves it.

This was really good. My husband, who "hates" bread stuffing, said this is the only one he's ever liked.

I have made this the past two Thanksgivings and it is always a favourite with guests. A wonderful recipe!
