Oh boy! The chicken livers transform ordinary meatloaf from ho-hum to yum-yum. Loved everything about this. I did make a sauce from rich veal stock and minced prunes to dribble over but it was fab as written. We're impatient for tomorrow...so we can have meatloaf sandwiches!

1) used ground chicken and pork, as veal was not available,2)it took about 90 minutes to come to 165 F,3)DO cover and put on baking sheet,4)DO NOT plan to serve this the same day you make it. It really needs the overnight time as it WILL crumble even after resting for an hour. 5) the saute thing....not so much. 6)Day after....my meatloaf hating wife admitted she really liked this and my eighteen yearold daughter said it wasn't too bad for a dad dish. High praise in my house.

My son thought this was awesome and even had seconds (a rarity). I chopped the pistachios, as I don't think I would like the whole nut in there. Mixing the bread crumbs with milk made kind of a clumpy mess, so next time I'll just add them separately. Overall, easy to make and very tasty. I love the mustard as a condiment, and I've had two delicious meatloaf sandwiches with mustard for lunches since the main meal. Leftovers are great.

For the cook from Richmond: Glad you liked it, but how can you rate the "flavor" of *this* recipe if you didn't use the livers??? They are the one ingredient that make this so delicious and unique!

Flavor is excellent. Meatloaf is very good, but also very rich. I omitted the livers and used equal amounts of ground beef/pork/veal. Next time, I'll use less pork. Also, when meatloaf is removed from pan, it is not browned because it was covered, so I put it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the top and get a little crust. The juices remaining in the pan could be used as the base for a nice sauce.

I've made this delicious meatloaf regularly for the past year. Great for dinner and for sandwiches.

I made this as indicated and lined the pan with parchment as suggested. It was easy to make but somewhat disappointing. I used a ceramic meatloaf pan, not glass, and cooked it for a little less than an hour, but it was too long. I should have checked it at 45 minuets for internal temp. Will try it again, but at a lower temp.

I'm a fan of meatloaf, and this is probably the best I've ever eaten. It will become a staple in our kitchen. Very tasty!

Like a number of other reviewers here, I have never been a meatloaf fan. I made this with my husband in mind since he loves meatloaf and I like pate so I figured it was a good compromise. My husband, a professional chef, raved about it, eagerly had second helpings and pronounced it better than any other meatloaf he has ever had, including ones he has made himself! I used a mixture of beef/veal/pork, added extra pistachios and lined the glass pyrex with parchment paper first to help with the removal from the pan. It popped right out and held together nicely. It did take longer than the recipe says to cook - about 20 minutes longer to come up to temp. As for me, I certainly enjoyed it more than any other meatloaf I have ever had. I would make it again mostly because my husband loved it and it was easy to make. And that's never a bad combo, right?

This is a wonderfully easy recipe that delivers a lot of flavor! Thanks to the reviewer in Alaska for recommending the drip pan. It saved a lot on cleanup. We served this dinner with sage mashed potatoes and green beans to guests who have traveled in France extensively. They eagerly accepted second helpings of the meatloaf. We liked the prunes and pistachios and will add more when we make this recipe in the future. Definitely a repeater. The wine selector choice of the Louis Latour Pouilly-Fuisse made a great accompaniment.

The chicken livers were a minus, not a plus, for us. The meatloaf also did not hold together all that well. That said, however, it made a really tasty cold sandwich on baguette with mayo and a hearty mustard. I'm actually looking forward to having more leftovers tomorrow.

Excellent recipe! Other reviewers seem to have baked it in metal pans. A glass Pyrex loaf pan is perfect -- and much easier to clean. However, do put the dish on a sheet pan or put a disposable aluminum foil pan under the dish to catch drips, as it will bubble out from the top of the dish and make a mess on the floor of the oven. Do serve cornichons with this. They really set off the rich flavors of the meat and provide a crunchy contrast.

I made this recipe several times last summer, at least once just for leftovers. It made a great addition to a picnic basket - crusty french loaf, grainy mustard. Big hit on a sailboat. As did many others, I substituted turkey for the veal, and baked at a lower temp, 350, instead of 475, used the thermometer to get the right internal temp. I froze one loaf, and it it still tasted fine, but was crumbly. Adding fat, fewer breadcrumbs, and finer grinding on the meats would probably take care of this. I like the line this dish treads between pate and meatloaf. Enjoy it for what it is, not what it is not!

Followed directions exactly. This was a mess to make! The cooking time and temperature was too long and too high. Destroyed my metal loaf pan!Served with cornichons and dijon mustard on toasted french bread. Family members liked it, but I will not be making this again!

This is my second 4 fork review of this recipe - because it really is EXCELLENT! I now own 3 non-stick loaf tins just to make this recipe and found my local supermarket had ground pork & veal together on special. So I have just made 6 to give away to friends as gifts in the next few days. I will cut 2 in half for the singletons which makes 8 fabulous gifts for $48 with double pistachios and prunes, including celophane and ribbon wrapping!

Exceptional is right! I made quite a few recipes from this site and some were good and some were outright not. But, as I nibble on this amazing authentic tasting terrine, I simply cannot believe that it came from my oven and not from the corner store in Montpellier or Arles. I am a huge fan of all kinds of pate and terrines and detest normal American meatloaf which this is not. And that's why I like it. One thing I did differently, I chopped livers instead of blending and used ground turkey instead of veal. This is the best recipe I have tried on Epi so far and cannot wait to have this one baguette tomorrow with cornichons and real Dijon. I bet it's even better when cold and flavors had some time to blend.

Really good. But didn't hold together very well so cutting out pieces was impossible. Everyone got a mound of meatloaf instead of a slice. But the taste was fantastic.

Wow! Great recipe. Was very moist and fabulous flavor - must have been the chicken liver! I toasted the pistachios and bread crumbs as recommended - only change to this recipe and have to say everyone loved it! Can't wait to try cold for sandwiches. Have a hard time understanding how this recipe received less than 4 forks. I agree though - don't tell anyone the ingredients. Your guests will love it!

Rating: 3
this sounded good & I actually made it within a day or two of receiving the magazine. My 15 year old picky eater son loved it - but the best was when my college aged daughter and her roommate came home unexpectedly and called me to ask what in the world was in that meatloaf?! We will definitely prepare again / in fact I just added it to my file

Rating: 4
just must add, after reading some other reviewers' comments, this is a meatloaf recipe NOT a pate recipe! I don't know why you would confuse meatloaf with pate; the addition of a quarter lb of chicken livers just adds a certain richness, it does not turn it into pate.

Rating: 4
This is amazing! I made no alterations, and served it to both kinds of meatloaf people, those that profess to hate it and those that love it, and both groups loved this one! just don't tell picky eaters the exact contents; (I don't know why some people are so squeamish about liver, but you can't taste it, it just makes the meatloaf very moist and delicious.)

Rating: 0
I almost didn't make this because half of the people liked it and the other half strongly disliked it. I read each review and then decided what my alterations would be. First off where I live I can not get ground veal. It simply doesn't exist. So instead I used ground beef and ground pork sausage. I added fresh rosemary along with the thyme. And because most of the reviews stated that it lacked flavor i added 2 teaspoons of herbes de provence. Because this seasoning as a bit of a peppery flavor I left out the pepper that the recipe called for, however did use the salt. Also I hand made my bread (multi grain boulogne loaf) which I think added an even more rustic flavor. The real problem that I had with my recipe is that after baking it would not come out of the glass baking dish like a normal meat loaf. It just sort of flopped all over the place. Perhaps don't make it to dense, use 2 glass loaf pans instead of everything in one. And 55 minutes was not enough time, as it took me almost 2 hours for mine to cook all the way through. It did not taste bad, actually it was good. lot's of different depths. I say make it once and then adjust if need be to your liking.

Well, this was quite odd- neither meatloaf or pate. A bit unpleasant on it's own. Best in a sandwich, I guess.

I didn't know this at the time but I'm not a big fan of chicken livers. That powdery taste left much to be desired. I followed the recipe exactly except I used french bread. My husband thought it was ok. I won't make again.

Yum, yum, yum. I was even happy to eat the leftovers over the next couple of days after I made this. The prunes and pistachios were interesting additions.

I am reviewing this without ranking it as I made it without the liver (my family won't eat liver). As made, this was really, really bland. The only thing that made it edible was the mustard on the side. So, unless you like liver, skip this one.

Maybe I'm just used to a local French restaurant's country pate, but this meatloaf fell way short of being anywhere as tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the prunes which I didn't have on hand. I can't imagine that they would've made enough of a difference for me to like this recipe enough to make it again. I think that I'll stick with my regular meatloaf recipe. And when I want a good French country pate, I'll go to my favorite restaurant.

Wholeheartedly disappointed in this recipe. I followed the instructions exactly and made no alterations in the ingredients. It had zero resemblance to pate, took 1.5 times as long to bake, spilled all over the oven creating a real mess, pureeing the raw chicken livers was pretty unappetizing, and the end result didn't seem to be anything special. It was just meatloaf.

Rating: 4
I have always hated meatloaf, but this recipe sounded so good I just had to try it. I think the chicken livers make all the difference in the world - this was terrific cold the next day, though the pistachios did get soggy. I will try roasting them next time (and there will be a next time!).

I have to start this by admitting I loathe meatloaf. My mom used to make it and all I remember is gray, bland meat. So in 20-plus years of marriage, I've refused to make it. But with the promise that this was somewhat pate- like -- and despite my anti-meatloaf crusade, I'll eat pate anywhere -- I tried it. To say my husband loved it is too mild. He was thrilled, and I have to say it was pretty good. I'm about to make bread for sandwiches and I'll bet it will be even better for having sat overnight. The livers give the meat some depth, btw. As usual, Paul Grimes has another winner here. And if I make this once a week, I've got another 20 years of marriage ahead.

I hated meatloaf when I was a kid. Yet this recipe looked so interesting that we decided to give it a try. The results were marvelous. We substituted ground turkey for ground veal.

Oh this is really goood...! Did as other reviewers suggested and used roasted pistachios and took the foil off at the end for even colouring, and it wasn't dry. Meatloaf isn't as popular here as in Nth America and I've never thought it was anything much worth raving about - but this one is! It doesn't contain minced beef which I think makes all the difference, so the meat is not cheap but so absolutely worth it. Perfect hot, or perfect cold between a bagette with mustard, pickles and a beer. Will be making this again and again and again.

Hey, Fellow Cook from Missoula, Last night I saw frozen ground veal at the Pattee Creek Market. Because I have been wanting to make this and other meatloaf recipes, I made a note to myself. Also, I am sure it is possible to order humanely raised Montana veal at other markets.

I used ground turkey, ground pork, and could not find chicken livers, so didnt use those. Soooooooooooooooooo delicious!!!!

Lovely, lovely meatloaf. Light and flavorful but still all the virtues of comfort food. The mustard makes the dish (oh, and the prunes, the prunes!), and the pickles another reviewer recommends also sounds like an excellent match. I used raw pistachios, but would use roasted/toasted next time. Also might remove the foil for the last 10 minutes of baking to add a little crust.

A wonderful twist on meat loaf. The unusual ingredients melded into a very tasty result. Veal impossible to get here but lean ground beef worked fine. Followed the rest exactly except baked at 450 instead of 475. Maybe next time I'll be brave enough to try the 475 temp.

I made this for friends on Saturday night but did not tell them what was in the meat loaf. They could not stop raving about it. This is definitely a keeper. I would not change a thing.

I made this mostly because I had 3/4s of the ingredients on hand (everything except milk, breadcrumbs, thyme, and pistachios). For the meat I used a 1/2 pound each of ground beef, veal, and pork because that's what I had in the freezer. Substituted almonds for pistachios (they didn't have pistachios at my local market. ?). I had everything good to go when I looked again at the oven temperature and developed serious misgivings about cooking meatloaf at such a high temp. But none of the reviews mentioned the temperature being wrong or too high, so I forged ahead and am so glad I did. Delicious! It wasn't dry, and the prunes add a nice hit of sweet along with all that rich savoriness. The mustard is a must-have accompaniment.

Rating: 4
My husband looked very skeptical when he saw the chicken livers on my prep table, but had to admit that the finished product was EXCELLENT. This is my new favorite meatloaf recipe! (and I haven't even tried it cold yet). I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing. Will definitely be making this again!

I loved the recipe. I used chopped liver and skipped the pistachios, since I was out. The result was a flavorful and moist loaf that was tasty out of the oven but even better cold, with pickles and mustard between slices of bread. Next time, I will add the pistachios for texture, but skip the prunes.

Rating: 3
This was an interesting recipe and my family wanted me to make it - the verdict? A little dry and more spicing necessary. Next time I will add more fat(probably finely chopped bacon),more herbs (thyme & parsley), puree some of the chicken livers, and chop some of them up, and mix the meats together more finely for a more compact texture. I think this recipe has great potential, and I will definitely be experimenting with it more!

Friends raved. An interesting way to bake a meatloaf. I have never seen a recipe where you covered the loaf and baked on such a high temperature. That way the top doesn't form a crust and the parsley adhered to the meat... makes a pretty presentation. Baked in a metal pan, no problem, however, you have to let it sit a little longer than the recommended time as it is fragile when just baked. Actually think I liked the crusty dill meat loaf on this site better
