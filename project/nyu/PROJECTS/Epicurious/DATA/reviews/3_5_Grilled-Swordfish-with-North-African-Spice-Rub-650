My boyfriend is a self-proclaimed caraway "hater" and he *loved* this dish. The caraway flavor really adds depth to this and is balanced nicely by the other spices! I think cumin goes nicely into this mix, but would add a very different flavor profile than caraway. The only change I made was to salt the fish after applying the spice rub. Quick, easy and yummy.

Quick, easy, full of flavor. Easily made it into my rotation of go to weeknight dinners. Like a lot of people, I swapped cummin for the caraway seeds. I also add some lemon zest to the yogurt sauce to punch it up a bit. I then put the steak of a soft bun, topped with the yogurt sauce and some baby arugula for a quick and easy sandwich.

I was looking for something different to do with swordfish, since we eat it a lot. This was VERY good. Simple to prepare and a delicious blending of flavors. I've also done this with marlin, which is easier to get around here. Anyone who likes swordfish should like marlin.

Amazingly flavorful swordfish recipe and very easy. I also substituted cumin for caraway. I will definitely be making this again.

What an interesting combination of spices! I followed the recipe exactly except substituted cumin for the caraway seed. My husband loved this dish. It is a permanent addition to my recipe file. Yum!

Easy to make! When I blended the ingredients for the spice rub and opened the top, the aroma was so strong, my husband smelled it in the next room! Over the fish, it reminded me of an Indian dish. Excellent because it's delicious, easy, and healthy!

This is too good to save for summer grilling. We cook it on a stove-top grill in the winter.

I loved this recipe! As recommended by other chefs, I used cumin powder instead of caraway. The spice rub does not taste good by itself, though on the fish and with the yogurt sauce, it's a wonderful taste. I also added twice the garlic and cayenne to the yogurt sauce - great! This was my first attempt at cooking swordfish and I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

Made this last night and my husband and I thought it was delicious. We had never made swordfish before and were very pleased with the results!

A wonderful dish that can make a non-fish eater tempted - and asking for more! The combination of flavours is interesting, in a good way, and the overall flavour is delicous.

This recipe was really very good. It was nice to find something so different to do with fish ...finally. I followed the recommendation of the others and added the pepper and additional garlic to the sauce which made all the difference. Really a great dish if you are looking to get away from the usual.

What a disappointment. I have been searching for a spicy, tasty fish entree and this is not it. The rub is extremely overpowering. The falvors did not go well together at all. The yogurt sauce was good so maybe I'll make that again (I took a previous person's advice and added some cayenne and more garlic). Overall, I thought it was terrible.

I have made this recipe many times and simply love it. I think the yogurt sauce is great, but my husband prefers the fish without it. This is the recipe that gave me inspiration to prepare swordfish at home.

The Flavor of this dish is excellent and it is not at all difficult to prepare. I did however, discover that the recipe makes so much of the spice rub mixture that putting all of it on the steaks was a bit much and prevented the dish from cooking properly in the alloted time. I plan to serve this again and will double the fish and leave the spice rub as is

I just got back from Morocco and decided to substitute the caraway with cumin ala Moroccan style. The results were great ... try it!

If you triple the garlic, and add some cayenne to the yogurt sauce, this dish becomes transcendent. We will make this again and again and again and again!!!

This recipe just didn't make it with us. We didn't care for the blend of flavors at all. I don't think caraway "married" well with the swordfish.

This tastes fantastic! If you're tired of the same old citrus flavors for fish & want something different, definitely try this! As soon as we ground the spices together in the mortar & pestle, we knew we were in for a real treat. The yogurt sauce, though simple, really rounds out the flavor. This is our new favorite!
