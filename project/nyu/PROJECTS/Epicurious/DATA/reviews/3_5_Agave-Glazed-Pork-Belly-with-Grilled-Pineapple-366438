OMG, this was incredible! We just started it in the morning and it was done well in time for dinner. We didn't even have the glaze (my husband accidentally left it boiling until it burned), and it was still incredible! (it would have been too hot for our kids with the glaze anyway, so it worked out fine) We shredded the meat and had it on fresh tortillas with the pineapple chunks and avocado and the roasted peppers. Heaven! We'll definitely be making this each time we're lucky enough to score a belly from our meat CSA.

This dish turned out amazing. Skipped the two day process and just seared the braised pork belly and pineapple in a skillet to finish the pork off and carmlize the pineapples. Mixed the braised peppers with mashed plantains as the base for the dish. Would have done more poblanos, they were so damn good.

Loved it. Got the pork belly from my local Asian Grocer. Braised all day in the electric roaster & mostly followed the recipe after that. Only thing I did different was use the charred pineapple and peppers to make a salsa for the tacos. Doing it again real soon.

Have you ever tried to find pork belly in Bellingham, WA? I ended up using a "similar" cut. I toned down the habaneros for the kids' sake. I wrapped it in heavy foil and baked it in my roaster. We ate it that night...no over-nighting, no grilling. The meat was tasty and the glaze was very good.

Although the glaze was delicious the pork itself was mediocre. The meat was tasteless and the texture was mushy. Even if this dish only took one hour to cook I would not make it again.

This recipe was so delicious. I braised it the night before then cooked it on the grill. Would make a note to place braising liquids in jar to cool overnight. Skim fat off of top, then strain and boil down. This will help alleviate flare ups on grill. I did not slice meat before grilling. Instead I grill whole slab and brushed with reduced glaze. Then we Shredded meat and made tacos, using corn tortillas, the chopped, grilled pineapple and sprinkled with some chopped cilantro and finely chopped white onion. I will make this again and again. It can also be made in advance for a party. Loved the recipe and the photo of the outdoor kitchen. Am Hoping to do a similar type kitchen at my ranch in Blanco, Texas.

This was really good, although fairly epic time-wise. I had a much bigger piece and ended up cooking it for 9 hours. Agreed that you should chill the sauce and at least skim the fat, which will have separated. Dn't hesitate to serve the sauce itself with the meat alongside the vinegar- it's a little extra decadence that goes over nicely.
