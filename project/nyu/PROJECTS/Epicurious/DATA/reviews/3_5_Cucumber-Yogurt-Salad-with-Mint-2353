Perfect -- except I didn't use the whipping cream. Totally unnecessary!

Has become my standard cucumber-yogurt-mint salad recipe.

Here are things you can do with the flavoring. If you want a milder garlic taste mash minced garlic with a little salt and let it sit for a while, 10 minutes is plenty. If you are using garlic that has a green shoot in the center take that shoot out, it can make the garlic taste bitter. For herbs: certainly, fresh minced mint, cilantro, parsley, chives, etc. are all good. You could lightly toast a little freshly ground cumin and stir it in. Lemon juice would be fine too. A few notes from the recipe author, 15 years later.

This is an excellent dish. If made properly, it is delicious!

I was so disappointed in this. It was rather bland. I love cucumber & mint salads, but this was too bland. We all kept saying it was lacking something. I used an entire clove of garlic, too. I'll move on to find another recipe.

Ditto on decreasing the amount of garlic used, and I love garlic. Maybe it should say one SMALL clove (the one I used was pretty big). I used oregano from my "garden" (i.e., windowsill) which I dried, and that came across pretty strongly as well- might decrease that one a bit, too. Otherwise, easy to make and yummy to eat.

Very nice use of fresh mint.

If you are not a big galic lover use half of what it calls for, because it can be very strong.

This was a banner year for cucumber production in my garden, and because of it, I've experimented with a lot of different salad recipes. This is far and away my favourite. I made it with low-fat yogurt, drained overnight so it was dense and thick and clung voluptuously to the diced cucumbers. I skipped the whipping cream, as it seemed entirely superfluous, and added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice instead. Yummy!!

Excellent recipe. Great anytime. I wonder if anyone has tried it using any other herbs such as cilantro instead of mint.

I used a hothouse cucumber (cutting out the seeded area) and some really thick yogurt from a Lebanese store, and garlic powder. To me this was a tasty and oh so cool salad for a warm day. Pita bread was nice to have handy to sop up the yogurt. Yummm.

This is an awesome recipe. I've made it several times and it is always a big hit. It reminds me of dishes I've had while I was in Greece. It goes great with any type of Mediterranean food. Try it!

Delicious, and even better the next day.
