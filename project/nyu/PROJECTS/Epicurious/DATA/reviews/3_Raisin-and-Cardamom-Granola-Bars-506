-toasted the oats for 30 min. at 350; -used 1.5 cups of chocolate bits, raisins, nuts - I think the chocolate, by melting, helped hold it together; -followed the trick of pressing down firmly all over before and after baking -baked them a touch less than called for ... and my boyfriend loves them! I will say I thought they would be thicker, but they were the perfect chewiness.

too sweet and sticky; bars fell apart

I toast the oats beforehand. Also, use a wet spatula to firmly press the mixture into the pan. I also wait about 10 minutes after baking to let them firm up a bit as it makes it easier to cut them.

PS...I always change them up with raw pumpkins seeds, sunflower seeds, dried cranberries etc. I just keep the 'stuff' I put in at 1 cup in total.

I tried the recipe as is originally. The next time I made it I did 3/4 tsp cinamon and 1/4 tsp cardamom so the flavour was a little more rounded (plus my son liked them better). I also baked mine at 340 for 20 mins and pressed them down again when they came out of the oven. They were better less cooked in my opinion and you don't have to worry about them crumbling! Yum!

These are crumbly if you make them as written. The second time I made them, I buttered my hand, and pressed them after putting them in the pan, and again after coming out of the oven. If you score them while warm (not hot), then pull them apart when cool, voila Granola bars!

Yummola! Great addition to the children's lunchboxes. I added cinnamon, almond meal instead of pecans, milk powder and baked dried apple chunks.

i gave it 4 forks but i did tweak it, so perhaps that isn't indicative of the recipe as written. but i am really loving this granola - great flavor and texture! i took another reviewer's suggestion of cutting the butter in half and adding a tablespoon of peanut butter. i also used muscovado sugar to amp up the brown sugar flavor, added a touch of cinnamon along with the cardamom. probably didn't use the full amount of cardamom though b/c i already had some ground and didn't feel like going through the process of cracking open pods and hauling out the mortar and pestle. i LOVE cardamom so next time i probably will go to the trouble. also didn't have any raisins so i added an extra half cup of nuts [used a combination of walnut, whole almonds and pecans]. oh yeah, i also toasted both the oats and nuts before mixing it all up. there was much talk of it crumbling so i followed another reviewers suggestion of really mashing it down before and after baking. they said to use oiled aluminum foil, a measuring cup does it much easier! anyways, i didn't have any issues with it crumbling, in fact i had trouble getting it out of the pan - didn't line it, next time i will! but once i did get it out i broke it into nice sized chunks. all this to say - really easy, really tasty and really wonderful texture. will happily make again.

I tried a couple of other granola bar recipes before landing on this one, and this was by far the best of the lot. It's simple and reliable and can be adapted to suit different ingredients. I do find that it falls apart some (but not completely) no matter what I do, and I finally tried the cardamom last time and didn't like the flavor so much -- I'm going to stick with cinnamon (and not too much of it) from now on.

this is a great base for a granola bar recipe. the cardamom is great in the recipe. i also mixed it up and used different dried fruits and added some allspice which give the recipe a bit of a kick.

I found this recipe to be good but not great. I will try it again and make a few adjustments. I do love the cardamon flavor though!

WOW!!! This is great for a morning snack on the way to the bus. Super sweet yet not sugary at all. I topped with a little bit of coarse sugar to make it even more delectable.

These were delicious. I followed the pressing method suggested by press down with foil before oven, and when they come out. While they were still hot, I used a 2-inch ring mold to make little nests (don't worry if the granola falls apart, just push it all back together in the ring mold) and they were adorable. Top with a honey roasted peach and some yogurt or ice-cream and it is a beautiful brunch piece or simple dessert. One suggestion I would make though, is to toast the oats before hand for 10 min in a 350 oven if you prefer a crunchy granola bar.

Hmmmmm...just made this again, and pressed the mixture as stated in my previous review, but it completely fell apart this time. I put the crumbles in the freezer, and have used them as a topping for french toast, pancakes and waffles, and I think I may like it more this way than the bars. If your batch crumbles, don't throw it out - it will still be super yummy! Now to try it on ice cream......

This was easy to make and had a great flavor. Before baking I placed a piece of tin foil over the batter and pressed down very hard with my hands. After baking, I put the tin foil over it again, and pressed down once more while the granola was warm. The granola stuck together and I was able to cut it easily. Next time I make it, I will reduce the cardamom by a pinch, and add more pecans.

This was quite tasty and moist; however the bars crumbled when I cut them and continue to crumble when you eat them. I think someone else commented on this as well -- not sure how to fix this problem. I added 1/8 c mini chocolate chips; but they melted after I added the warm ingredients to the mix. Next time, I will try letting the entire mixture cool and then stir in the chips before baking. Also the raisins browned more than I desired and affected the taste. Next time I think I will chop up the raisins before adding (and only use half as much)and make sure that they don't appear on the top or sides of the pan. I used cinnamon instead of cardamom, 1.5 T butter, 5 T applesauce, 1/3 c evaporated cane sugar and molasses (to replace brown sugar), and sunflower seeds instead of pecans.

I used Angela's suggestion with the applesauce and cinnamon. They were a huge success, and yummy! Thanks, Angela!

i adapted this to make a low fat version- replacing the butter with applesauce, used half the sugar and replaced the cardamom with cinnamon . i also used a 50-50 ratio of oats and grape-nuts for an extra crunchy texture- good!!

I wasn't as crazy about this as the other reviewers. I found the cardamom to be overpowering and the texture of the bars to be too crumbly. I ended up using the crumbles as cereal. I won't be making this again. I have a much better granola bar recipe.

This was a great recipe, although I did change it quite a bit. I doubled the recipe, used a 9 X 11 baking pan, added sunflower seeds, used half the amount of butter indicated, and added two Tbsp of peanut butter to the honey mixture. It was very yummy! I usually like to follow a recipe the first time, but this time I just couldn't resist!

I made these granola bars with my son's preschool: and it was a hit. I used cinnamon and sunflower seeds to make it more preschool-friendly.
