This was just blah. I took it to a potluck and no one seemed to like it much. The olive oil taste with the apples was a little odd.

It's good but not outstanding (not quite worth three forks, more like 2 and a half). Would be excellent with quaality bread and cheese. Nice lunch/buffet dish... made with graniy dijon which gave the apples a nice speckle. Would cut down on the lemon juice though, a bit too lemony. Used three different kinds of apples and you can mix and match whatever apples you like.

Good side dish for richer, fall dishes. Provides a sweet, tart, crunchy counterpoint. Very easy to make.

Made it with walnuts, only because that is the onyl nut I like with apples. But it was really really good

This makes a ton of salad! The dressing is a disappointment, you can't taste it at all. It's just to keep the apples from turning brown. Since that's the case, if you don't like tart apples, you won't like this because there's nothing to mellow the flavor. Next time, I'll use a milder apple

Having an apple tree I am always looking for new and different ways to use them. This dish was a wonderfully different salad. I made this for a Bar-B-Que and it was fun to see the different reactions from people. Most thought it was some sort of cole slaw salad until they tasted it and discovered it was apples! It received great reviews from everyone. I substitued roasted Pine Nuts in place of Peanuts.

This was yummy, and seems very versatile...I made it with only green apples (no fujis) and instead of peanuts, candied some pecans and crumbled some gorgonzola...my GOD! YUM! I definitely noodled pretty significantly with the proportions and it still came out great.

I made this for a buffet with 2 year olds and 80 year olds. I added salt and pepper and a little more olive oil. Everyone loved the peanuts, second helpers picked out extra penuts for themselves. I will double the peanuts next time.

This is a wonderfully refreshing salad. I like making this as I usually have all ingredients on hand and it can be made in 20 minutes. Also a very good way to eat apples, which I am not overly fond of. The olive oil was quite a surprise combined with the apples, but it worked well I will definitely be making this one again sooooooo easy

We had a big christmas party and this was a hit! I must've had 10 people ask me for the recipe. It went very well with Baked Ham. It's funny, it sounds like it will taste odd with the olive oil in it but you really can't taste it. The salad is light and not too tart. I thought it tasted great before I added the peanuts, but the peanuts made it really wonderful.

I've made this recipe twice this summer, and it was a hit with family both times. I think the recipe works so well is that olive oil is used instead of the usual mayonnaise base. However I used chinese parsley (cilantro) in place of italian parsley the second time I made it; it has a real *zing* and is intensely fragrant. I might leave out the peanuts next time, or substitute chopped walnuts...

Last Sunday, I made this scrumptious salad with honey glazed ham and garlic Mashed potatoes and it was a hit with my family!!!! My teenage daughter raved so much about it that on Monday afternoon I end up having 10 teenagers at home wanting to sample some! :o)
