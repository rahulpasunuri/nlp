This is a truly fabulous dessert. I have made it since it originally appeared in the 2001 issue. My chocolate friends love this! I present it a little different however. Ben & Jerry's makes the choc. chip and choc. fudge brownie ice cream and Haagen-Dazs makes a good cookies n cream. I slightly soften my ice cream and layer it instead of scoops. This way everyone gets a taste of all three ice creams in their slice. I follow the recipe layering with the chocolate sauce. Freeze and top with remaining ice cream. Freeze again. The top is sealed to edges with the remaining chocolate sauce. Freeze and then I drizzle with the white chocolate.

I bought the best ice cream I could find, and the results were delicious. The crust was very hard and difficult to cut through, so presentation ended up leaving something to be desired, but that did not in any way affect taste. Very rich and chocolatey. Would definitely make it again.

This was very good. I did substitute the chocolate chocolate chip ice cream for plain chocolate chip and eliminated the chocolate sauce heated at before serving. This was impractical to do when taking the pie to someone's house. But it got rave reviews by everyone.

The flavor is as good as the quality of the ice cream you buy. No much credit goes to the recipe. The crust is just ok and it breaks when serving so a bit messy in presentation. Though we are chocolate lovers, this recipe was too much chocolate, way too much.

This is awesome. I usually sub with Godiva's Belgian dark chocolate ice cream--Wow! I also have left off the white choc drizzle--not as pretty but just as tasty. This has always gotten raves. Wear an apron while preparing!

People, Im not joking, this is one of the most delicious recepies I have seen in my 4 years of looking at online recepies. Make it( which might take some time if you are no thet perfect of a cook), and enjoy. I couldnt stop eating this beautiful dessert for a whole month. Really, it is delicious!!!

I prepared this pie for a New Year's Eve Dinner Party and took a fruit plate for those who might prefer fewer calories. EVERYONE ate the pie and loved it. I used five different Ben and Jerry Chocolate flavors. I skipped the white chocolate and offered whipped cream. I also had a raspberry sauce I'd made to go with a different dessert, added that and would recommend some fresh raspberries to top the pie. This is a fail safe dessert.

I made this for my son's 1st birthday, it was great. Easy to make and delicious. I varied the ice cream flavors - chocolate chocolate brownie, and vanilla with chocolate brownie and a raspberry swirl - never got around to the white chocolate on top and it was still stellar. Served with raspberry cheesecake brownies. Oh la la!!

Delicious! Very easy yet impressive dessert. Made for a dinner for 60 and received many compliments. Used oreos for crust, and needed to use pie weights while baking and cooling. Let pies be in refrigerator half hour before cutting and set pie in pan of very warm water so the crust would thaw enough to cut.

Scrumdelicious- a hit at a casual dinner with kids. Presentation is not overly impressive, but flavor more than makes up for it. Would make again in a heartbeat- provided I was going to the gym the next day!!

I made this for a dinner party, and it got huge raves. I did make it again for a birthday party, but instead of the cookie crust I used brownie. It was rich but fabulous. Most importantly very easy.

This was ridiculously easy to make and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. YUM. We used a springform cake pan instead and thank God because otherwise the ice cream would have fallen out for sure. We all loved it! If you use a deep freeze, you don't need to do the whole 2 hours. I did about 1 hour, and it was fine.

Wow! This was pure heaven. A must-try for chocoholics. Try making your own ice creams if you are feeling like Martha Stewart. The chocolate sauce is fantastic.
