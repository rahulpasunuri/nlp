I thought these were very nice and easy to make. I've gotten requests to make them again, so other people liked them, too! They're great for munching on at Thanksgiving. One change I made: I used pecan halves and didn't chop them up. I couldn't figure out why to chop them unless I was going to use them as a topping, which I wasn't.

I prefer an earlier recipe that used a combination of cumin and cayenne...spicier and I like spicier.
