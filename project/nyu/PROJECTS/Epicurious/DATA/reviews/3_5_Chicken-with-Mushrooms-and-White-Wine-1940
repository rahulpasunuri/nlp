Finally, I found a recipe that everyone in my family likes. I don't really like chicken breasts, so, I used chicken thighs. Did not have fresh herbs, so I used dried thyme and "poultry seasoning". Took a little longer to cook, but worth every minute.

Just made this for my wife. I am so getting laid tonight. Super tasty - used onion instead of shallots and dried rather than fresh herbs. Still lovely.

This is a very good and easy recipe to make. I made a few changes because I lacked some of the ingredients. I didn't have boneless chicken breasts, so I added 2 more table spoons of oil since I was going to need to cook them longer. I cooked the chicken 8 minutes a side initially. I used two medium purple onions in place on the shallots and I used low fat chicken broth with sodium. I used dried herbs and I put a generous amount of ground sea salt prior on prior to cooking the chicken. Once I added the chicken back into the pan to simmer, I cooked it about 6 more minutes per side. When it was done the sauce was very thick. This was not bland at all. The chicken broth with sodium probably helped. I'd say the biggest factor is making sure you cook the sauce long enough to reduce it to a very thick sauce. When you do that you intensify the flavors and it will not be bland.

Simple and delicious. I omitted the chicken broth and used Marsala wine in place of the white wine. I also used flattened skinless chicken breasts. Do not skimp on the mushrooms (I used baby bella) as they really add that special earthy flavor to the dish, esp. soaked in those juices. I served this with scalloped potatoes and steamed broccoli, paired with a crisp chardonnay, for a wonderful, homey meal.

Good, easy...but not special.

This was a very quick and light dinner. I sliced the chicken breast and pounded it flat for faster cooking time. I used a sweet onion in place of the shallots (didn't have any) and used sherry in place of the white wine. Really good.

This chicken dish was very easy to prepare and my family loved it. It was tasty and moist. We will be adding this to our favorite family dinners recipe box.

oh, I guess I should say, I used a yellow onion instead of shallots... didn't have them. I don't think it affected much. And by "special" sea salt, I mean I bought it special, but it's not like, fleur de sel or anything...

oh, oh wow. This is good. Really good... I cut fresh thyme and tarragon from my garden, used all cremini mushrooms, special sea salt, and (of all things) a frozen Trader Joe's chicken breast. It was excellent!! If it's bland, try adding more salt. And don't bother with dried herbs...

Used wild chanterelle mushrooms. Left over sauce poured over white rice the next day made a wonderful lunch.

This dish is good, but can be a tiny bit bland if you don't have fresh herbs. Don't skimp on the shallots, and use a good wine. What brought this dish from good to great was putting slices of very sharp swiss cheese on top of the chicken right before serving, allowing it to melt and become bubbly. The flavors meld deliciously and the cheese really compliments it.

So delicious and easy! used fresh herbs.

I added garlic and onions to the mushrooms, and finished the sauce with a touch of cream. While it is easy to make and actually fresh tasting, it was a little boring. I added some fresh nutmeg to the sauce and it still didn't have much life to it. Might make it again with sherry.

Do not skimp on the wine! I used a very cheap wine and it withdrew from the flavor. Next time I will use a marsala.

This one is going into my regular rotation. It's easy as can be. I didn't measure anything, and it came out great. I wish I had made a ton more sauce; you really want as much sauce as you can manage. I threw a couple cloves of garlic in the oil at the beginning, when I was browning the chicken. Oh and I used 3 kinds of mushrooms: white, baby bellas, and crimini. I think that's the key. I also used regular chicken stock and didn't dredge with salt, just pepper and flour.

Really good basic chicken and mushroom dish, but not truly special. Used comments from other reviewers and cut back herbs to 1 tsp dried of each, used 1 lb white mushrooms and 1 lb sliced baby bellas, and 1 cut onion (out of shallots) and lots more wine. Will try different herb combination next time, and something to jazz it up a bit. Was good with mashed potatoes -- the mushrooms on top were delicious.

Rating: 3
I added 4 cloves of minced garlic as I sauteed the mushrooms. I used cooking sherry instead of white wine and added about 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the sauce. I also used boneless/skinless breasts. I think next time I'll try adding some sundried tomatoes packed in oil to the sauce. This was a tasty recipe that can be altered with different herbs. I'll make this again.

Made this dish almot exactly as instructed except used skinless chicken breasts and half the tarragon. Also added a bit of butter to the oil. The shallots and herbs gave it a wonderful flavor - husband raved - and it was very easy! Served with mashed potatoes and a simple salad, will definitely add this one to the regular rotation.

We used a whole chicken cut it in 1/4's. After adding the browned chicken back to the broth/wine/mushroom mixture, we added small new potatoes and finished cooking the dish in a 425 degree oven for 20-25 min. Superb. The chicken kept the crisp outside, the potatoes picked up some of the broth/wine flavor, and the sauce thicken on its own. This is excellent comfort food!

The recipe is so so as is, I added a few things to improve it and it came out great. I added onions and garlic to the mushrooms and a bit of brandy and cream to the sauce. Yes, sherry would have been better than white wine, but I didn't have any on hand. I also used my Dutch oven and put it in the oven after it was all in the pot instead of doing it on the stove top. The way I made it came out great, but if you follow the recipe without any variation, I think it would be very bland.

Realized that I'm not a fan of tarragon. Did not like the sweet/spicy flavor of this fresh herb. Used breasts without skin, turned out juicy and tender. Also used lots of garlic as suggested below and shery instead of white wine. Would most likely do it again without the tarragon. The preparation took longer than I'd anticipated.

Superb! Used a whole young chicken, cut into pieces; a mixture of porcini and white button mushrooms; extra fresh thyme, fresh tarragon, and dried herbes de provence; and a yummy, inexpensive, dry Italian Pinot Grigio. Paired with roast potatoes coated with fresh rosemary, olive oil, garlic, coarse salt. Drank with same wine.

It certainly wasn't terrible. Just boring. The mushrooms were great, but the flavor of the wine and herbs just didn't penetrate the chicken. If I were to make this again, I'd try sherry rather than use the riesling I used. I'd also add some garlic. But whom am I kidding? I won't make it again.

Very delicious! I will definately make this again. I halved the recipe, but otherwise I followed it exactly. Next time I will add some garlic or red bell pepper along with the mushrooms. I served this with roasted carrots. Definately a keeper!

My guests were not impressed, nor was I. I followed the recipe to a "T"... my guests commented on the greyish color of the sauce and heavy tarragon flavor. Perhaps it was the mushrooms...perhaps it was the recipe.

This was an easy and very quick recipe to make. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and only 1 large shallot. I also didn't use the mushrooms because my family doesn't care for them. The chicken was moist and the sauce was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

Last night I had a very choosy eater over for dinner, and thought I'd try this recipe out. To my surprise, he loved it! While he wasn't particularly happy with my sides of mashed potatoes and spinach (he wanted rice and peas), there were no complaints about the chicken. This one is a keeper, and I wouldn't change the recipe at all, except to add some chopped garlic. Everything is better with garlic!

Wonderful! I have made this several times now, and I can come home from work and throw this together in minutes. Anything this delicious that is this simple to make deserves even more than four forks in my book. I even made this with Marsala one evening when I didn't have any white wine on hand, and it makes a very nice variation.

This dish was simple and yummy! I didn't have scallions, so substituted 1/2 onion and 1 tsp garlic paste. My picky children loved it and it was so good I would serve to company. It was an easy recipe with an empty pantry. The chicken was the most tender I've made and I cook alot! I only tried it because my refrigerator and pantry were bare, it calls for staple ingredients and I will definitely make it again! A cook from Northern California

Good recipe. The chicken turned out tender and moist... absolutely perfect. I had a couple of variations, though... I used skinless breasts and a Zinfandel blush instead of a white wine. Also, I only used three shallots, which I found to be quite sufficient... in fact two would have been closer to perfect, IMHO. Additionally, I found this recipe to be a bit too salty... even the low-salt broth I used was too much. I'd suggest slightly diluting the broth, or skipping the first step.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. Definitely use breasts with skin and bone ... it adds to the flavor. I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers to add a little heat. Also, I used half sliced white mushrooms and half sliced gourment blend (oyster, shiitake, lobster) to give a nice blend of mushroom flavors. Very complex flavor and only an hour or so of prep and cook time. Serve with brown rice.

I used turkey thighs instead of the chicken and in all fairness it was only OK. Didn't have the eye appeal and while it was easy and sounded yummy, it just fell short of our expectations. This was not a do over. It just didn't impress us.

Great quick dinner when you don't want to be a slave in the kitchen. Dust the chicken breasts lightly with flour and they will not clump as long as you have the temperature on med-high. Don't think about skipping the flour, because it gives a rich golden color and adds texture to the dish. This is served well with rice, which makes for a filling and wonderfully presented meal.

This recipe is my "old faithful". I've made it many times and my family and friends have never tired of it. I use skinless chicken breasts. Just before serving, I sprinkle a little fresh parmesan on top. I've even sprinkled mozarella cheese on it, then let it melt. Yummy!

I made this with skinless chicken breasts - the flour was quite unnecessary as it turned to nasty clumps of paste despite the nice brown color. The chicken lacked flavor, even though I added a little lemon juice and garlic. The mushrooms, however, were fairly good. My boyfriend, ate this as a sandwich with a slice of cheese between the chicken and the mushrooms and raved about it - I couldn't see why.

I thought this receipe was wonderful. It is quick and easy and elegant enough for a dinner party. I added my own chages by adding a can of artichoke hearts, sliced onions, sauted mushrooms, lemon juice, and lemon peel. I then reduced it as the directions indicate, but also added cornstarch to make the sauce thicker. It's excellent on a bed or white rice.

This was excellent. I had 6 skinless chicken breasts and dried herbs and it was perfectly fine. I added a bit of garlic and doubled the portion of mushrooms as it was suggested. I would do the exact same thing the next time I do this recipe.

We liked this just fine, but I felt like the recipe needed something--maybe some lemon juice or garlic. I'll make it again, but I'm going to experiment with it some; as is, it seems a little bland. It is quite easy to prepare, though, which is always a plus in my book!

I made my first holiday meal for my parents and in-laws with this dish. It was for the night Yom Kippur started and you're really not supposed to have anything to salty, spicy, etc. This dish was so good, I wanted to come home from services for lunch and start eating it again. Unfortunately, I had to wait for Break Fast. But it was when my husband said it reminded him of home that I knew it was a good dish. Plus, it was so easy to make. I served it with a kugel and some fresh veggies. Oh and I used low-sodium chicken broth to keep the salt content low.

Impressive. Went well with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. I used twice the amount of mushrooms and dry sherry instead of wine, vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, threw in a clove of garlic . I never follow directions exactly unless it's for desserts. It was sublime.

Excellent - especially when served with fresh baked bread, use it to mop up the wonderful sauce (just like the magazine recommends)!
