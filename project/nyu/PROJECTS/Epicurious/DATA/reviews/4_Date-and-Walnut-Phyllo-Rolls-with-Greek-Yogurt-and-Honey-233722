Once I figured out how to work with the paper-thin phyllo dough, this was an easy winner, and could be made a couple days ahead with no ill effects. I doubled the orange zest (would probably triple it next time) and sprinkled ground pistachios over the dipping sauce for a bit of color. Served with clementines at the end of a Moroccan-style dinner for Christmas Eve Eve. It was a great finish to Tagine Bil Kok, Moroccan-spiced roasted vegetables and Moroccan chickpea salad, all from this site - rave reviews from all the guests.

I made these for my gourmet club for a Greek theme dessert. Everyone loved them. I'll make them again. The orange slices with the greek yogurt made it very fresh (suggested by one reviewer).

All I can say is "WOW!!!" The only thing I did different was that I sectioned several oranges then drained them and served them topped with the Greek yogurt and honey... that combined with the wonderful date "cigars" is sure to be a company pleaser! Make sure you buy the Greek yogurt... it is definitely worth it!

If you know your way around phyllo dough, this is an easy dessert. I used allspice instead of cardamom, and added a bit more orange zest. The amount of filling called for for each roll seemed excessive. I used less and the rolls were slender and elegant. I served them with marinated orange slices insead of yogurt and it was a great dessert combo.
