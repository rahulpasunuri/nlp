This is a hard one. I really liked it, but nobody else did. Maybe it's because I really like bell peppers. But, I put in half the amount of sour cream, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper. . . Too bad, was not a crowd pleaser.

Terrible! This recipe is a total waste of roasted peppers and garlic. If you must try this recipe, skip the caraway seeds. They completely overpower the entire dip. I made this for a party and it went practically untouched.

This recipe had a rich flavor that everyone liked and was easy to prepare. I used the leftover dip on the next day"s vegetables, delicious. Fennel is very expensive($3.00/bulb) so I used crackers.

I thought I would like this dip, but it was the sour cream--I didn't like it and neither did my guests. If I made this again, I would roast and puree more peppers and completely omit the sour cream and I would serve it with crostinis or crackers--not fennel.

This is a suprisingly tasty dip, we love it. I make it over and over again because it is so simple and sooo good.

I've never read a review quite like that one....buddy, you've got issues! Maybe the wife left 'cause you ate too much garlic.

After I made this, my car wouldn't start, my dog died, my house flooded, the wife left me and I lost my job. Thanks!!!!! I hated that car, the dog was a mean old bastard, I was aching to move anyway, and don't get me started about the wife and job. I've got a nice new kitty, a motorcycle, and I am painting landscapes for tourists...with no wife to nag me! And I owe it all to this lovely dip.

Got mixed reviews at a party I took it to, but I thought it was delicious. I love red peppers so that might be why. We had it with crackers and crudites, but I also used it for dipping quesadillas and french fries. Yum!

I made this dip for Thanksgiving. My husband and I loved it. However, I only got 1 compliment on it at the party. If I made it again, I'd do some shortcuts.

I too used reduced fat sour cream and the results were delicious. I served it as an appetizer with onion bread.

This dip is just great. Different and crowd pleasing. I keep some in the fridge for "after work snack". I also used no fat sour cream with great success. I also skipped the cooking of the seeds and just threw them in due to shortage of time - taste was not compromised.

I used two instead of one pepper, and roasted them over a flame, which produces better flavor than the oven method. Also, roasting the garlic with olive oil enriches its flavor; it's also worth it to roast the spices. Be generous with the cayenne. Lovely with the fennel; also try slices of olive bread.

Great Recipe! Many, many compliments and requests for a copy. Don't bother peeling the red peppers unless you want to, nor grinding the spices...the blender takes care of all that without a loss of taste or texture. Toasting the spices didn't make much difference either. My advice: don't bother. I couldn't find any fennel, so I used Stoned Wheat Thin Crackers-which worked great. Good luck.

This dip was incredible! I made it short-cut style by simply peeling garlic cloves and dicing the peppers, then putting them in a food processor. I also ground the seeds, without cooking them, with a mortar. Also, I served it with stone-ground wheat crackers. EXCELLENT!!
