Simple but elegant without all the hassle and fussy steps of the other recipes. Had it night one with Market fish and tonight with prime roast beef. two thumbs up -leave it to the Irish to know how to cook potatoes.

great. I threw in a couple extra garlic cloves, and next time I might even throw in a few more

These potatoes were really good, creamy and the garlic flavor was evident, it didn't linger or crowd out the other parts fo the meal. I'd make them again, perhaps with redskins.

I thought this was a delicious recipe - subtle garlic flavor, but not overwhelming - as garlic mashed should be. I left the skin on, as I usually do, to save time - plus it is healthier. I also used about half of the cream and none of the cooking liquid, since the potatoes seemed creamy enough without it. This is definitely my new garlic mashed recipe!

Very Good mashed potatoes! Like another reviewer, I forgot to add the cooking liquid, it didn't seem to matter. I used a food mill instead of mashing the potatoes, the texture was perfect. The amount of garlic was just right for our taste.

The intensity of the garlic flavor is perfect - not overpowering but not timid either. I forgot to put 1/4 cup of cooking liquid, which made the texture less creamy, but that suited me just fine. The heavy cream could also be substituted by regular milk. It is just as effective at subduing the garlic bite.

This recipe ROCKS. I was hoping to find a recipe for gmp that didn't call for any garlic powder or salt. I added one more clove for a little umph. Tremendous, a keeper.

Easy and tasty with a subtle garlic flavor. Overboiling the potatoes is the ticket. Everyone had second and third helpings.

This dish is fantastic and easy to make for those times when you feel like indulging yourself. I agree with the previous reviewer; "overboiling" the potatoes means that adding reserve liquid is unnecessary and that mashing is a cinch. It's true that the flavors are not overwhelming, but in its richness and smoothness this dish does have something of a classic French puree. Also, be warned that six cloves of garlic means that this is a recipe for garlic lovers only.

This is a keeper. I used only 1/8 cup salted butter, then added a little garlic butter and ground black pepper. yummo!

This is the BEST garlic mashed potato recipe I've ever seen. It's incredibly easy and almost foolproof. I made it with the halibut with tomato sorrel sauce as recommended and it was delicious. It will be a standard in my house from now on, with or without the halibut.

After more than thirty years of cooking, I didn't think I needed a recipe for mashed potatoes. I knew all the caveats. This recipe, however, cleans the slate! Can't figure out just what was the magic; but, I do think that the addition of milk into the cooking liquid "tenderized" the potatoes. Additionally, I used a Foley food mill instead of my usual ricer. The results were extraordinary- more on the style of a French puree, and much easier than any traditonal approach.

Good basic side dish, but it does need a bit of salt and fresh ground pepper sprinkled on top when served.

This came out great...boiled a bit longer than I was supposed to I think, so they were thin enough without any of the reserve liquid (and easy to mash too). Added a sharp chedder and that was wonderful. Very easy recipe, highly recommended.

My 6 1/2 year old thought this was an "awesome" recipe, my husband liked it too. I thought it was sort of bland, and not garlic enough. It needed a LOT of salt nd pepper, and a bit more butter.

I think the reason of why it turned out deservant of 2 forks only was my fault, I think I added just a bit too much of the liquid leftovers, but it was good b/c we used it with the halibut.

So yummy! This is the best garlic mashed I've come across. Made them several years ago for a dinner and just made them for a large dinner party tonight. Tripled the recipe - cooks up so easy and is very rewarding when guests moan over each forkful!

I've made many versions of mashed potatoes and this was by far the best...it's very easy and absolutely delicious!! This dish was the first to go at the Christmas dinner!

These were good- next time however we will be adding a cheese-a creamy one like goat or cream cheese.

iMake this dish with chopped garlic slowly sauteed in a small amount of olive oil, it add another dimension and great texture to the dish.
