I'm going to be a bit more generous with my rating of this recipe than most other cooks here. This is the classic treatment and the results are fine. We make this in Normandy where we have baskets of eggs and litres of fresh milk every day in warm weather. I did reduce the sugar, and I always use turbinado sugar for custards. As one cook noted, by all means use the poaching milk to make the custard; I've never seen it done any other way. I also used all six egg whites for the meringues; why waste? Also, you may brown the meringues slightly under the broiler, but carefully! We usually substitute a coulis of berries or plums for the caramel, as they are plentiful in the country. A drop of liqueur in the fruit does no harm - trust me! Bon appetit!

This was good-- but too sweet (even my kids thought it was a little sweet). I'm sure there are better recipes out there.

it was okay... i like floating islands where you bake the eggs separately. two notes to future cooks; 1- make the merangues first and use the poaching milk for the custard. it's already hot. 2-custard sauce is less likely to "scramble" in a double boiler, one that isn't actually touching the water. takes longer, but it works.

I made floating islands for a recent dinner party...not this recipe which does seem pretty complicated. Used dry egg whites and followed directions for sweet merangues. Poached in sweetened low fat milk. I've had this in Italy where they float the merangues on Creme Anglaise instead of custard. Delish. No time for Creme Anglaise? Then melt a quart of high-quality vanilla ice cream in refrig. and substitute. Sprinkle with crushed Amoretta cookies and a splash of carmel sauce. This was a huge hit.

I have been wanting to make Iles Flottantes for ages and finally did. This is just not the right recipe. I followed it to the letter and the custard sauce was way too runny and sweet. I would cut the sugar in the custard to 1/3 cup at most. The caramel was great, but how could you go wrong with caramel? I'm going to compare against other Floating Island recipes to find a better one.

Time-consuming but fun to make. Delicate and pretty--and cheap. Would make it again for a nice dinner party.

Thank you for responding to my query. I am familiar with tempering, and the thing is, the eggs didn't scramble when I added the milk, it was later when I was trying to heat the custard and thicken it. I suppose the heat must have been too high, but like I said, I didn't let it boil as the recipe cautioned against it.

To the cook from Peoria, IL: Your eggs scrambled because of 2 reasons; the milk was too hot when you poured it into the eggs and/or you poured the milk too quickly. If you don't already know, the procedure of mixing hot milk into egg yolks is called 'tempering'. What you should be doing is slowly raising the temperature of the eggs by adding in a little (tablespoon or two) of the milk into the eggs and whisking continously! You should do this till you've gone through at least half of the milk and only then should you pour the milk in a thin stream, still whisking continously of course! Even if things go well, it's still a good idea to strain the milk/egg mixture (custard). You wll be rewarded with an extremely smooth custard. You can add a Tbs. of butter for some glossyness.

I had real trouble with this recipe, as I often do with attempting to heat eggs without cooking them. The sauce separated and its appearance was that of scrambled eggs in cloudy liquid. Other than its awful texture, the flavor was delicious, so I think it would have been excellent if done properly. Unfortunately I didn't go any further and haven't had the courage to retry. I'm not sure what happened, I followed the directions and did not let the mixture simmer. Any suggestions?
