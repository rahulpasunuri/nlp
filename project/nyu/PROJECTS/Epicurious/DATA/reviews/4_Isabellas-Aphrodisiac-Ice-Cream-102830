I also used 1 tsp almond extract instead of the butter/nuts step. Unfortunately this imparted a bitter aftertaste. I am so disappointed! Maybe use less extract (1/4 tsp)? or just follow the recipe, although that part is definitely confusing.

I've just completed this ice cream and I must warn you to be careful when using almond extract, I took "A cook"'s advice and used it instead of the almond/butter mixture. ...even though I only added a tsp, I can only taste the almond. No fig, no vanilla bean.

This is a great ice cream recipe. I keep it as a base and change the flavors around. Smooth, rich and easy.

Mine did not come out with much of a fig taste. Perhaps my figs were not ripe enough. Why did I rate it a four? It was still a fantastic ice cream; Rich, creamy, smooth. Very decadent!

By the way, I wouldn't add almond extract to this recipe (Why mess with perfection?). The toasted nuts were such a feature of this recipe I think if would be foolish to leave them out. I thought the typo was clear in the original recipe. She meant "...add vanilla extract and almond" not "...add vanilla and almond extract". Adding butter would give the icrecream a grainy/greasy quality.

Absolutely Fabulous but I had to change a few things. Instead of frying the almonds it tastes better if you dry toast them then let them cool to preserve their crunch. I added an extra 100mls of cream to soften the flavour. I also dropped two tablespoons of sugar and replaced it with one tablespoon of honey (to give it that traditional 'fig and honey' flavour as well as stabilising the icecream mixture). The result of all of that was an incredible soft, light yet flavourful icecream with accents of nuts. Pure Heaven!

To the cook with the question about the almond extract: in the first step in this recipe you are making the extract (when you cook the almonds in butter). The butter is the extract. The almonds are not supposed to go into the ice cream, although you could add them if you wanted. Or you could skip the first step and just buy almond extract, which would probably be stronger in flavor.

I suspect 'almond extract' is really the almonds. It makes sense to add them at that point, probably a typo.

I want to make this BUT it calls for toasting the almonds and then never says what to do with them. In the text, it says add the almond EXTRACT but does not mention it in list of contents-what are the correct directions?? Do you use both nuts and extract and when do you add??

Having never made ice cream and with an abundance of fresh figs we tried this. It is absolutely decadent. Easy and delicious.
