Have to agree with you....can't believe this recipe hasn't been tried and rated. Have never rated a recipe here before but this was exceptional....truly great Spanish cuisine. Used my own recipe for Romesco sauce but the serrano ham around the tuna made the dish. Excellent recipe. Hope others will try and rate.

I can't believe no one has reviewed this. The Romesco Sauce makes a ton but is very good and easy to make. The tuna is rich!! I subbed prosciutto for the serrano. I also subbed jarred roasted red peppers for the piquillo peppers. What a great entree!! The success it so quickly sear the tuna in a HOT skillet.
