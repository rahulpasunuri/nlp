These are super-easy and incredibly delicious, and always get a great reaction when people realize they're eating fruit that has been grilled. This is one of the recipes I featured on my blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

I rated this as highly as I did for the following reasons - It was easy to make, it suited a BBQ theme, it is different and it is light but flavourful. One thing I learned is that more is NOT BETTER, I used regular sized peaches (bought 4-5 days before so they would ripen). When I first tried it I used large peaches and thought that 2 slices of cheese and the small amount of prosciutto would not be enough so I used more - this was a mistake. What worked out best was: 1) DO NOT SALT the peaches, the pecorino cheese I used was very salty thus I only peppered the peaches after spraying them with oil; 2) I criss crossed the cheese slices (about 3/4 " wide by about 2-2.5" long each) on top of the peach half then draped the proscuitto slices (2 pieces about 1/2" wide by 5-6" long) half on and half off the peach half on either side at about 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock; 3) to dress up the presentation I put two Nasturtium leaves and a flower on each plate (these are edible and have a mild peppery flavor); 4) Serve immediately so that the peach is still warm; 5) We served it with an Italian Gewurtztraminer which complimented it nicely. Next time I make this I will take a photo and see if it can be added to the recipe site.

Did these for a dinner party, everyone raved about them. Since it was snowing, I put them under the broiler instead of the grill. I also wrapped the prosciutto around them before broiling so it got crispy. Used a pecorino pepato (black peppercorn) instead of the regular pecorino and it added a great flavor

So simple but great for entertaining. I had trouble separating the peach halves though.

I had this as an appetizer about 3 weeks ago for a dinner party and everyone went wild for it. We had just brought back some aged pecorino from Italy and it was outstanding. We grilled the peaches about 4 minutes on each side on a hot gas grill, nice grill marks and made the cheese just melt. Perfect, loved it.

This is a delicious and simple summer appetizer with a tangy flavor that makes it unique. We loved it!
