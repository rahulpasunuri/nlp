My family did not like the green peppers in this recipe. It was very rich, and the spices need adjusting as per previous reviews. Kibosh the peppers, and its much better

This was ok . Another viewer said to serve on horseradish mashed potatoes --wrong . Serve on noodles or regular mashed potatoes .

I made this and my hungarian grandmother would have been proud! It turned out great. I would adjust the seasonings, like other reviewers have suggested. I also julliened the onions, pepper (ancho chile), etc. to give it a more interesting appearance on the plate.

A delicious winter dish, but I agree with the majority of reviewers that more paprika and less dill is the way to go. Also, don't bother trying light sour cream. It disappears utterly in the substantial sauce. Use regular sour cream. To make it slightly healthier, I cut back on the amount of beef, and that was fine. The sauce is really rich and flavorful, so it's great with egg noodles even without a ton of beef in it.

While this dish probably rate 3 forks I am giving it four because my picky family loved this and said I can make it again any time. It is definitely worth a try, and if your family loves it I think you will rate it a 4 as well. I agree with the others to not be timid with the paprika. Use it liberally.

really fantastic! i used lite sour cream and the consistency was fine. also, definitely use double or triple the amount of paprika called for. even without the sour cream, the sauce is great. such a gorgeous color!!! we had the Canoe Ridge Merlot 2001 with it. awesome!!

Oh... and don't use the tenderloin. Pointless waste of money when pretty much any chopped up half-decent cut of beef works just as well. ;)

My family and I loved this dish. We've made it about four times now and will continue to use the recipe and perfect it. Definately use a little garlic (but, hey, we use garlic in everything!). Use MORE paprika than called for, and throw in as much green pepper and onion as your heart desires. Also, a diced tomato is a superior sub for the paste and adds great colour for presentation when a bit more is placed on top when finished. We find it's better to prepare a day ahead and heat... the sauce thickens just right and the flavours mingle. Good stuff.

This dish more or less resembles Beef Stroganov. I had it with Rolled Potato Dumplings, also on this site. The Beef Paprikas turned out quite well, the dumplings didn't. The next time I'll make some mashed potatoes to go with it.

I don't give four forks frequently. But for what this recipe is - simple and easy, it is VERY flavorful. My husband and I had this for dinner tonight but it is definitely company worthy. I served it with Caramelized Onion and Horseradish Mashed Potatoes from Cooking Light, October 2002. I made a couple of minor adjustments: I halved the recipe and used a whole green pepper, used light sour cream and the butt end of the tenderloin (which was very tender).

We made this dish true to the printed recipe (cut by half for two). We found the dill overpowering and sorely missed the subtle flavor a little garlic may have added. There are other, better paprikas recipes to try.

I didn't have tomatoe paste so I trew in tomatoe slices with the onions and peppers. This recipe to a bout an hour for a novice like me to make, but it was increadibly worth it. The mix of flavors was delicious, everyone raved about how amazing it was. They kept trying to compare the taste to something exotic that they had eaten before. Try this recipe, it's beginner proof and tastes amazing

This is a lovely dish but beef paprikash it ain't ! Sautee a small onion in oil, add as many cuts of beef as you can find,about 2lbs (pieces of blade roast or brisket are the best, NOT expensive tenderloin),sear the meat quickly, add Hungarian paprika to taste, add good beef stock to cover, add a peeled,seeded tomato - bring to a boil, cover and simmer until meat is tender. You may add some sour cream to the individual servings.Serve it with potatoes, tarhonya(egg drops [?])or preferably with nokedli.This is how my Hungarian Grandmother of the blessed memory, made it to universal applause.

Delicious, the sauce is suberb and would also work with cooked chicken. As I was halving I did not worry about the tomato paste, used reg butter and dried dill, it did not seem to affect the taste.
