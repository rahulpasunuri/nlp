I have a huge asparagus bed and am always on the hunt for new ideas on how to use the bounty. I've made a number of risotto recipes with the asparagus, but this one is the all time best and here's why: the puree of asparagus and chicken broth that is added at the end makes this ASPARAGUS risotto, not risotto that has pieces of asparagus thrown in. The fresh, spring flavor of the asparagus permeates the risotto and is unbelievable. This one is my go-to recipe from now on.

Loved this recipe. Fresh asparagus in spring is killer. And Risotto is a great vehicle for it. I actually added a bit of lemon zest to mine, which add another layer of flavor and complexity. You can see the video at http://tiny.cc/l63lg

Ahhh, what a great way to use asparagus! This was sooooo yummy. Yes, it does take the approximate 45 minutes to cook, but the recipe itself isn't difficult -it just takes a bit of attention. The results are well worth it. I cut the recipe in half since I was only making it for the two of us, and I added cooked, diced chicken at the end with the cream and cheese to make it a complete meal. This one's a keeper!

This is an outstanding dish, everyone loved it. It took only 45 mins. and was simple to do. I substituted vegetable broth (Knorr's boullion) for the chicken; left out the whipping cream and and added a bit more cheese. It was very flavorful. I also served with pan-seared scallops and salad. A great meal!

This was my first time making risotto on my own and, let me say, I was very pleased with the turn out. The cream and parmesan cheese finished it off nicely. Don't be alarmed when you add the asparagus puree at the end, it will cook down and be a perfectly green risotto.

I made this for Mother's day- have made and eaten risotto many times. I heated the vegetable broth, which I think helps it stay creamy. My 11 month old grandson ate it with gusto! He let me feed him bites in between- I'd say it's a hit.

This was my first risotto and a huge crowd pleaser-- I got many compliments! I doubled it for a 16 person dinner party, but I have lots left over, so I think I was a little over eager with portion sizes. I used vegetable broth rather than chicken broth (for the vegetarians out there), and it turned out wonderfully. In addition, I probably doubled the rosemary-- it had a great flavor. Also, I skipped the whole pureeing of the asparagus, and instead merely sauteed ~2 inch pieces of the asparagus in a little olive oil, some garlic and rosemary before making the risotto, then added the asparagus pieces back in. It made the risotto more creamy and cheesy and the asparagus very flavorful. I highly recommend this dish!

This is a fantastic recipe. Aromatic while cooking, yet subtle in final results. Next time, I will play with the ingredient ratios, adding more wine, slightly more rosemary, and less broth for a slightly stronger taste. Fresh parmesan is wonderful! A delicious dish.

I was hesitant in making this dish because the recipe doesn't exactly follow "risotto protocol" as I learned it in Tuscany. Nevertheless, I am glad I tried it because it turned out quite nicely. The trick to making a good risotto is using only Carnaroli or Arborio rice and adding the liquids gradually while stirring the risotto, allowing the liquid to absorb before adding more. Also, it's important to remove the risotto from the heat before adding the Parmesan at the end. Great recipe! I will make this again with artichokes next time.

Wow. This is the first time I've reviewed anything on this site but I just had to defend this dish. I'm usually hesitant to make dishes with only a three fork rating (I like to impress) but I'm glad I took a chance on this one. This recipe is absolutely divine. I'm not a fan of asparagus, but this has made an impression. It says it makes 6 servings, but only three people finished off the whole bowl in one sitting. My only critique is that the recipe tells you to cook for very short amounts of time. Risotto is a lengthy cooker and if you want it done right you have to be patient. It will pay off!

Rating: 3
Very good. Flavorful and creamy. I definitely made too much, though. 2 cups of arborio goes a LONG way, especially since this dish is so rich. Will definitely only make 1 cup next time unless I'm serving 6 or more. Also, like one of the others, I ended up with too much liquid. I didn't end up adding all of the puree. And unlike the others, my husband and I really did not enjoy this reheated. It was much better the first night. Another reason not to make too much next time! Overall, though, this is really delicious and a nice side for any type of poultry or fish.

First of all, let me say that I am not very experienced in the kitchen yet, but I just tried this recipe last night and it was amazing! It isn't hard to make and it is very impressive. I made with Halibut and it was a great side dish- I will definately make this again and again!

I made this for dinner guests, and served it with sauteed chicken breasts stuffed with ham and cheese. Although everyone enjoyed it, it was my first time cooking risotto, and I didn't realize how much you have to babysit it! The asparagus is excellent with this, and with both the puree and chopped spears, you get both color and some texture added to risotto. It was very tasty. I would make this again, this time relying more on my own judgement on the amount of liquid to add, as I followed the recipe and ended up with more liquid than I should have at the end (once the puree was added).

FOLKS FOLKS FOLKS - risotto is NOT Rice-a-Roni! Done well, it is exquisite, and this one is just that. For those of you reading this review the whole recipe took 25 minutes. It does not take "THAT LONG" for all of the liquid to absorb, and shouldn't be mushy but creamy. So when you see the rice is absorbing less put less in or stop. The parmesan absorbs some of the liquid too. And - yes - it is green! What color should it be? If you want uncolored risotto, use white asparagus instead. Any good cook will tell you that good food takes time.

Rating: 1
I followed the recipe, the only problem is that when I added the 2 cups of liquid that are pureed with the asparagus it turned into soup, it couldn't possibly absorb in 3 mins. When I cooked it down it turned to mush. I will try this again and NOT add the 2 cups of liquid with the puree.

This is a wonderful winter dish. If you use as a main dish, recipe will only feed 3 average eaters.

Substituted shallots for onions. Rave reviews!

This risotto is absolutely delicious! This was my first attempt at making risotto and was by far the best I have ever had.

Great recipe for Asparagus lovers. This was my first time making risotto, while it took some time and attention, it was rather easy. This dish has a very mild flavor and I would probably try to add mushrooms or saffron like others have tried if I ever make this again. Using vegetable broth is a good idea as well.

Great risotto! I would have given 3 1/2 forks if I could. The puree added great flavor and color. I would recommend adding puree in 2 steps and it does take more then 3 minutes to absorb. This was a wonderful change from my standard wild mushroom risotto.

Rating: 2
Very good recipe - my wife liked this a lot - although I think it works a lot better (and adds a lot more colour) if you soak some saffron (around 5-6 strands) in 1/2 cup of hot water and add it near the end. Also, I always think it is better to make vegetable broth for a vegetable risotto (instead of boiling an old bird). We loved the rosemary touch - it gave it an interesting tweak to the flavour.

I have probably cooked about six or seven times in my life, and I tried this last night to surprise my fiance.

The key to this recipe is TIME. You need to wait until added liquids are absorbed, and BE PATIENT. The puree was interesting and provided the green color.

My suggestions after 20 years of living in Italy: Cook the asparagus in the stock - or even water, until almost over-cooked. Blend it if you like, but otherwise it pulps away to make a creamy consistency when cooking with the rice. The secret of a first class risotto is that the stock must always be boiling as you add it to the rice - so you need to heat it before and during - keep it simmering on the side. You can make the risotto with the stock from the asparagus - the cooking water, or the asparagus flavoured chicken or vegetable stock. Stir it energetically if you haven't blended the asparagus and it pulps to a creamy consistency. When the rice is al dente,not too dry - almost sloppy, add some grated parmesan, a knob of butter,cream if you wish, but you can do without, turn off the heat, stir well, and leave to sit for a minute before serving.

Rating: 2
I made this last night but had a bit of a problem with it. the recipe says to add all of the asparagus puree at the end and it will absorb in three minutes. I don't think so! It is over two cups of liquid and it took at least 8 minutes to fully incorporate itself. If I made it again I think I would slowly start adding the puree in at the same time as the asparagus was added rather than add more broth at that point. It did have good flavor and my kids loved it, so I suppose with some modification I would make it again.

Another response to making risotto ahead of time. I attended a cooking class yesterday and the chef said that once you've added about 2/3 to 3/4 of the liquid, take the rice off heat and stick in the fridge. Bring it out before you serve and use hot liquid to finish the cooking process. A great way to make a day ahead for a dinner party so you don't have to be stirring when you need to do other stuff.

Rating: 0
This is in response to the person who asked about making risotto in advance. I have done that (though I did not freeze it)very successfully. When the cooking is complete, and the risotto is very creamy, I turn it into a casserole, top it with garlic/parmesan bread crumbs and bake it. It is wonderful, just make sure it is not to dry at the point you put it in the oven.

This isn't a review - but I would like to know if anyone has tried making risottos ahead - even to the point of freezing - for serving later. This recipe sounds delicious, and I'd dearly love some hints for making it ahead of time. Thanks for bearing with me.

I'm not going to rate this recipe because I made some pretty significant changes to it. I just wanted to offer my variation if anyone is interested. I rehydrated about an ounce of dried morels, sauteed them with some butter and shallot, and added them at the end of the cooking process. I also added the soaking liquid (strained) to the chicken broth. After plating the risotto, I drizzled it with some black truffle oil. The addition of the mushrooms added a wonderful earthiness to the dish. As far as this recipe goes, it was decent. I've made risotto dozens of times and had concerns about adding 2 full cups of the puree all at once at the end. I chickened out and added only about 2/3 of the total. The rice took a good while to absorb it, but didn't seem to do any harm.

My husband is on a vegetarian low fat diet so I omitted the cream, used olive oil in place of butter,used only 1/2 c. of Parmesean cheese and used low sodium, fat free chicken broth.

My husband raved about it to all and my children loved it as well. It's also great as leftovers. Will definitely make again. Might try fresh parsley though.

First I want to thank Gregg for pointing out that alcohol can safely be used. I happen to be one of htose raised to not use alcohol in my cooking when growing up, but now use it or use a substitute. If you'd like to get a copy of a substitution list just email me.

Regarding cooking with wine. If your religion prohibits you from drinking alcohol you can still cook with wine. Add the wine before you add other liquids The alcohol will burn off rather quickly, leaving the flavor of wine and not the alcohol. Then add the other liquids. I have know differnt people who do not drink alcohol for one reason or another and they have no problems with cooking with wine. And if you really don't want to purchse alcohol at all, just leave it out and increase the liquid by the same amount. The taste will be a bit different, but it shold still be good.

I helped in preparing this risotto at a dinner party the other night and we all LOVED it! Instead of adding all of the broth (you're only supposed to add 1/2 c at a time), we began adding the pureed asparagus mixture and found we didn't need all of the broth (were left w/ about 1 cup that didn't need). I will definately make this again - you just need to know how to improvise and sounds like the cook who added all of the broth didn't do this, therefore was disappointed w/ the outcome. The wine really does add a nice flavor - do not omit it! This is a pretty green dish I might add.

Although, this risotto was not the absolute best I ever had, it was still very good, and I would make it again. You don't have to cook the asparagus before pureeing it as one reviewer questioned. It came out just fine. Simply follow the recipe as is. Yes, the risotto comes out light green. Not a problem for me.

This is to answer the cook from Egypt. You can omitt the wine alltogether in any recipe and replace it with chichen broth,or even water. Besides, when you cook with wine the heat will evaporate all the alcohole and you're left with the flavor only.

To the Egyptian cook. Don't worry about the wine in risotto. Simply omit it. I'm an Italian cook and I'm ready to bet that 90% of the people tasting such a risotto would be aware of such a lack. Wine is used in smaller amounts than indicated, and its function is just to contribute a whiff of aroma - forget about acidity and all that hullabaloo.

I'd like to add my humble two cents to the risotto debate. I am a chef and I trained in Paris and in Lucca(Italy) and I make risotto at least twice a week at home. For a long time, I refused to believe that a proper (texture and flavor) risotto could be made in a pressure cooker, but I was WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! A friend of mine (a highly skilled non-professional) challenged me to a blind taste test: Mushroom risotto made in the traditional manner, in a pressure cooker, and a la Barbara Kafka (microwave). The pressure cooked risotto and the traditionally cooked risottos were IDENTICAL in texture and flavor. The microwave version had decent flavor but lacked the proper texture. Although I still make my risotto in the traditional manner, I no longer scoff at other techniques. So there.

To the Cook with vegetarian adult children - I've had great success making risotto with vegetable broth instead of chicken, but the key is using a good one, so the one in the can that you buy in the supermarket isn't going to cut it. It's just too bitter and salty. Either make your own vegetable stock (you can freeze the leftovers to make other things), or buy one of the vegetable broths from a gourmet or healthy foods store, like Wild Oats or Whole Foods. My favorite is Pacific Foods. The broth comes in a tall, paper container and you can reseal what you don't use and put it back into the fridge. It's a little more expensive, but the flavor is as good as homemade, in my opinion.

To Lynne ( lynneob@earthlink.net ) from Chicago,IL: With regards to making risotto for vegetarians, I've found you can replace chicken broth with any of the following without any problem: vegetable broth, a vegetable boullion cube dissolved in water, or plain water. If you're good with matching herbs to a dish, also try plain water in which you've added a bit of dried herbs and bought to a simmer. With regards to cooking risotto in other methods, such as the microwave or pressure cooker: please note that in a proper risotto the rice is braised. The rice is not boiled, steamed or stewed. The rice should be soft, yet firm, and you should be able to taste the individual grains.

As for the person who wants to make risotto in a pressure cooker....well that isn't risotto...no matter if an Italian cooked it or not. Risotto is meant to be cooked slowly, adding more hot liquid when needed. If I mentioned this way of cooking to MY Italian friends...they would be thinking I am making a rice stew (or whatever) There are some things that arn't meant to be rushed and I think risotto is one of them no matter how convient it is

I have made my own version of this recipe that is significantly more flavorful. The basic concept is the same with the following revisions. I don't use the cream - the puree of asparagus ads creaminess without making the dish too rich. Then, I prefer to stir fry the tips in vigitable oil with a LOT of garlic and salt them well. I serve the risotto, then place the tips over the top. You stir them in as you eat it, and the strength of that flavor really adds interest to the dish. Nothing bland here!

The puree adds nothing, and the color itself gives a poor impression. I added lemon-pepper and a little more fresh rosemary to improve the flavor, but still felt something was lacking.

Good, but not great. It wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped and seems to need something to spice it up and make it more interesting.

Looked good in the photograph, but the asparagus over-powered the risotto, and the green color of the risotto wasn't very appealing.
