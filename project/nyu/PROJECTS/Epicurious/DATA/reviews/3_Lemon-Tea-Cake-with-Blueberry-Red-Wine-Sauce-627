Only made the Red Wine Sauce which I used with a Molten Spiced Chocolate Cabernet Cake. Was a great pairing for the cake. Thought the sauce had good flavor was very simple and quick. Will definitely make again when I need a dessert red wine sauce.

I love this recipe. Big hit at a tea party. None of the negative reviews rang true with the result I got.

I made this cake on the fly, as a last minute dessert for company. Because this was spontaneous baking, I had to do a couple of substitutions, but the recipe still worked well. For the cake: Instead of cake flour I used all purpose flour, less 3 tablespoons; I used plain balkan-style yoghurt instead of sour cream and I omitted the vanilla, as I was out. For the berry sauce, I used a 1 1/4 cups of frozen mixed berries, thickened the sauce by whisking in a couple of tablespoons of flour and then whisked a tablespoon of butter in at the end to enrich it. I would use only a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and skip the nutmeg altogether--the spices as given in the recipe were a little overpowering. I served this with some whip cream and it was a nice, simple dessert. If I made it again I might try adding a simple struesel topping to the cake, and the sauce (made with a good wine) would be excellent over ice cream or, with the appropriate seasonings, over pork.

The key to intensifying the lemon flavor is to zest a *fresh* lemon directly into the batter. A lemon's oil is extrememly flavorful and should not be wasted. This cake is wonderful. I will make it again and again.

so-so; not much lemony flavor to the cake

i modified this recipe for a pork tenderloin. i sauteed shallots, then added the wine and vinegar and simmered, then added the blueberries and boiled for a few minutes, added some sugar. i would reduce the amount of vinegar a bit. it was wonderful with the pork. Grilled fennel goes nicely with the dish.

I seem to have had a better experience then the previous cooks. I have made this twice now and it has been delicous, the cake was moist and flavorful, and the sauce was the perfect accompaniment. Rave reviews from all who partook!

I agree with Joan, this cake was nothing special. The blueberry sauce was very good though. Maybe I will make just the sauce next time and spoon it over Vanilla ice cream.

Without the sauce, this is a dud. However, this sauce was so good, that it compensated for the average cake.
