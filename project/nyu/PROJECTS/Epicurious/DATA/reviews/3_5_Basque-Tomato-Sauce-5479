I haven't made the recipe yet, but i would recommend using diced bacon or preferably prosciutto. Skip using the oil, just render the bacon/prosciutto that way you will get a much better flavor. Once you have enough bacon fat only remove the bacon and save for later, saute the vegies in the bacon fat.
