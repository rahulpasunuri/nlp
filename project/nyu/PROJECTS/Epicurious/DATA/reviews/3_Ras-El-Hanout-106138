Sorry to burst your bubble out there,but even though this is a lovely and tasty blend it is not Ras-El-Hanout,I have been to Marocco and have had the pleasure to see it manufactured and know quite a bit about the real blend,there is much more to it than this paltry immitation. I will not give the recipe here because it huge and I encourage those of you really interested in the real deal to research it for themselves.You will not be dissapointed when you get to try the real stuff,it is uplifting and complex.

This is a very fragrant blend of spices. Very pleasing just to smell but absolutely amazing when used to make Moroccan cous cous, my favorite vegan meal!

Works great as a rub on chicken.

This is really tasty and goes especially well with pork. It keeps indefinitely in a small zip top baggie.

I used this in conjunction with the sweet potato/butternut squash recipe and it was wonderful - i must admit i only approximated the proportions but i worked and everyone loved it.

i looked for ras el hanout at the markets in edmonton. i was always asked if this was for a pregnant woman. got great laughs when i said no, it's for a pork tenderloin!

It's odd to rate just a combination of spices, but this one is spectacular! I used it on a pork tenderloin, but it would be good on any number of other things, including chicken.
