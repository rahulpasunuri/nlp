I made this once the recommended way. Since I don't have the patience to make this more regularly, but love the flavor, I made up a quick version. Preheat to 450. Make the almond filling as described in the recipe, chill. Cook puff pastry rounds (from frozen is ok), for 20 mins. Cut the tops off, fill with almond filling and return to cook 15 mins. Let sit for 5 mins, and eat. Perfect individual size desserts. Same flavor, less time and effort.

This was time-consuming, but mostly because the recipe could be a little vague at times. However, the finished product was delicious, and even though everyone told me how difficult puff pastry was to make, it came out great. I'll definitely make this again.

My first attempt at puff pastry, and what a breeze! Though you need to be around most of the day actual active time is limited. I tented with foil near the end of baking to prevent over-browning. Definitely serve warm, though it was fabulous the next morning cold with coffee. Might make it for brunch next time instead of dessert.

Delicious! Time-consuming, but worth the effort. The only problem I had was that I have made this recipe twice and both times the filling leaked out either before or during baking. Next time I will try and make the filling thicker-- either by adding more flour, or by freezing it before spreading it on the dough.
