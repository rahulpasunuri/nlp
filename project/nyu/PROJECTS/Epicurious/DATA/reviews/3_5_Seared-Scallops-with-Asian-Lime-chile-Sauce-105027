OMG - this was so freaking good! I had a red serrano pepper and 1/2 a jalapeno in the sauce but it still wasn't quite hot enough so I added a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce that I had leftover from another recipe - the adobo pepper gave the sauce a really good smoky spicy flavor that went very well with the seared scallops. I also omitted the water from the sauce, and served it over a bed of rice-vinegar seasoned sushi rice - really good.

Super-easy and delicious! After sauteing the scallops and letting them rest for a moment, I added the juices to the pan along with the sauce and reduced it slightly. The caramelized flavor gave the sauce a great depth of flavor. I served this with Cilantro Coconut Rice (http://bit.ly/cveg9o -- sans jalapeno) and steamed broccolini drizzled with sesame oil. Will definitely make this again for dinner guests!

I'm giving this 4 forks because the sauce is GREAT! I omitted the water b/c I wanted the sauce a tiny bit thicker, and only used 2 scant tsp. of sugar, but otherwise made the sauce exactly. It's very authentically Thai tasting. And I grilled my scallops brushed with peanut oil. Served with coconut jasmine rice and sauteed edamame. Super easy, super fast and really good.

Wow this was REALLY good and extremely easy. Use the sauce sparingly as it is really hot (but so good!). I keep frozen scallops on hand the same way others keep chicken on hand, this will definitely be my stand by for preparing them!

This is my all time favorite scallop recipe. The flavors of the rice vinegar, nam pla and lime juice are perfect together. Make sure you get a great sear on the scallops before you turn them.

This recipe is great tasting fast and easy -I would definitely make it again. I followed recipe for the most part (except for enhancing flavors) subbing orange blossom honey for sugar and two (2) serranos, and blended/cooked. My sauce was chunky after blending/cooking so I strained chilies from sauce *save sauce* and top chunks on scallops. I paired the scallops with Thai peanut rice noodles with lime and added strained sauce to spice up the noodles. You can make this super Thai hot depending on how much sauce you add to noodles. The peanut noodles went really well with the spicy sauce!

I liked this so much I made it 2 nights in a row. However, I would not serve it without the cucumber/radish salad. The spicy scallops with the cool/sweet/cripsy veggies really complement each other well. I also made the rice which went well also. Great meal!

I made this dish and accompanied it with the cucumber radish salad as a first course. I added a little cornstarch to the sauce and boiled it a few minutes, it had the consistency of a store bought sauce but the taste was out of this world. The heat of the scallops with the cool refreshing taste of the cucumber and radish salad was really lovely. It was a huge hit at my dinner party. The suggested wine was perfect too. It was a layering of flavors that you would pay a rediculeous amount of money for at a fancy restaurant, but it was easy and inexpensive to make at home.

Made this with the forbidden rice according to the recipe - and it was delicious and easy. Oh - I used a serrano chile instead of a red chile - it was hot enough for me. Wonderful, easy and refreshingly different - good for company. The sauce is in small quantity for good reason - you only want a thin drizle over the scallops. The heat catches up with you as you eat. I'd offer the remaining sauce on the side for those who have a higher tolerance for hot food.

Wish I'd been as excited about this as I thought I'd be based on reviews. We served it with jasmine rice, and took the seeds out of the chili so that it wouldn't be as hot, but next time I'd definitely leave the seeds - it really needs that heat. Other than the lack of heat it was pretty good. Fast, tasty, healthy, a little out of the ordinary - will definitely make it again.

I thought this was good. I made it with the black rice, so it was quite exotic. The flavors were nice; not the greatest ever, but I'd definitely make again.

I do not like fish sauce so I instead used a T of hoisin and a T of oyster sauce. I thought this sweetened it up a bit too much, so next time I'd use some soy sauce instead. Also, I used a serrano chili and could've doubled it, salty and spicy go well with sweet scallops I think! It was still wonderful and very simple!

I made this for dinner last night and it was delicious. I didnt have fish sauce and substituted with oyster sauce. It was easy and the flavors really comlimented each other. I will defenetly make this again. Its going into my saved recipes!

The chili didn't overpower the scallop, but I had lots of leftover sauce. Maybe use the sauce sparingly. The sauce was good, and low fat compared to my other favorite scallop dishes (beurre blancs). The plate needed a garnish, so I threw a few very small strips of lime zest on top, which worked well visually and tasted good.

Very simple, elegant and easy to prepare dish. Took me only 20 minutes, start to finish, including cooking rice & spinach. The sauce ended up being a little over-spicey - I'd only put in 1/2 the chili, test and then add more as needed.

I'm sorry I have not made the recipe but had to comment that while cooking spray is great for lowering calories, it ruins nonstick pans and is not recommended by any manufacturer.

Fresh, bright,spicy and Asian-licious! I've made this a few times and it's so fast and tasty that it's become a week-night, after-workout favorite. I agree with Manderville,LA, that this is perfect for anyone who appreciates Viet-Thai cuisine. I'm trying to cut down on fat so I skip the oil and use a cooking spray on a hot pan to sear, it works very well! I serve the sauced scallops alone with a big green salad on the side and it's perfect as a light summer dinner. My SO and I eat the whole lb of huge, sweet, glorius sea scallops between the two of us. (I enjoy the extra scallops much more than I would the oil and for the same number of calories, and far less fat... just a hint for those of you who are trying to cut down.)

This recipe was quick, easy and delicious. I used crushed red pepper in place of the fresh pepper and skipped grinding it into a paste - I just mixed the sauce ingredients together and this seemed to work fine. I served it with sauteed zucchini, carrots and onion over rice. I highly recommend it.

Reduced the fish sauce, and didn't bother with the skewers, but otherwise followed he recipe and it was delicious. Just like with any other scallop recipe, the key is cooking time. I served as an appetizer for a chinese dinner party

Excellant dish! Went over very well with my boyfriend and will definitly repeat. Included cilantro in the sauce and blended it for a more even consistency. Deglazed the pan I cooked the scallops in to thicken the sauce and heat it up. Quick and easy.

Fantastic recipe!!! I didn't grind the sauce too thoroughly and it worked out great. My wife was amazed with this dish and how quickly it was prepared. It's a keeper. The flavours of the sauce meld perfectly but you have to like the flavour of fish sauce (which isn't everyone).

For those who don't like the extra fish taste of the fish sauce, here's what you can do: Substitute the 2nd tblspoon of fish sauce with Sake... or substitute completely. You can get small & cheap bottles of Sake from any good market. Keep the leftover in the fridge and use for a myriad of asian style sauces. If you want more concentrated flavor, deglaze your pan with the sauce to burn some alcohol and it should thicken slightly as well. For added thikness, forget about the water or just use sparingly. I like the idea of using sesame oil as well. Spoon sauce and garnish with sliced scallions - just a pinch - and a sprig of cilantro. The skewers are really for presentation only so I think it is optional, unless you are going to grill your scallops instead. Yummy!

Made this for myself, wife and four guests over the weekend. Reduced fish sauce as suggested by another (wife doesn't like "fishy" foods). Since I wanted it to be a main course rather than an app, I served it with short-grained rice (molded in a cylinder in the middle of the plate and garnished with black sesame seeds), ringed the rice with steamed spinach, and then put six seared sea scallops in a ring around/on the spinach and sauced the scallops. I quadrupled the sauce and had leftover so I bought scallops the next day and made it for lunch w/o the spinach. Yummy!

Of course this recipie was a springboard for my own--especially since I didn't have any rice vinegar, on hand. My husband loved it as well, and we definitely will prepare it for company! ps--Lori, nam pla = fish sauce. What I did: Pounded 2 lg. cloves garlic, 1 T minced ginger, 1 serrano chili & 1 T sugar in mortar & pestle. When all was a thick paste, added 1T sugar, 3T fish sauce, & juice from 1 1/2 medium-sized limes, and 1T chopped cilantro leaves. Seared 1 lb. med-large sea scallops in 1T butter + 2T olive oil. 2 minutes per side w/out moving them. Deglazed the pan with half of prepared sauce , boiled to thicken, and poured over scallops. Poured half of remaining (raw) sauce over scallops. Left the rest for the table. Served it all with steamed long-grain rice. Yummerooski.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Although we did not sear our scallops (Gulf scallops are a bit small) for fear of overcooking, the overall effect was still very good. We served it over brown rice with spinach - the sauce went really well with spinach. I will probably reduce the fish sauce by 0.5 T and increase the lime juice a bit next time (I'd use a half lime).

I found this dish to be a wonderful dinner on a very hot evening. I also halved this recipe and it still came out great, so know that you can make it for two if you need to. Very easy to put together, which makes it all the more appealing for summer cooking. I served with steamed rice and sugar snap peas.

This was excellent - very light, bright flavors that were perfect with both scallops and shrimp. I substituted spicy Asian chili sauce for a fresh pepper which was perfect - I will use it the next time, too. I omited the oil called for and brushed the scallops with 2t. toasted sesame oil instead. Served over mixed greens with tomato and red onion this was a perfect, nearly fat-free dish.

I used Nam Pla which I had on hand from another recipe. Maybe this was the downfall of the sauce but I did not find it appetizing.

This recipe creates a delicate and delicious seafood dish over rice. I used the black rice recipe to serve the scallops over and found the taste and flavors do be very rewarding. I would not bother to skewer the scallops next time I make this as you can save time and get the same results by searing the scallops and turning them and removing them from the pan with cooking tongs. I have no idea why the one reviewer found this recipe so distasteful other than the fact that they seemed to use this recipe to create their own recipe. Not sure how they can complain about the published recipe when they did not follow it at all. I guess cooks in DC are the same as our politicians, they don't take directions well, create their own messes and then proceed to blame someone else for their own failures. I would suggest you make this yourself and be your own critic on the recipe. I did use the mortar and pestle for the chile sauce. This is also easier than using and then cleaning a food processor or blender.

This is a great dish for those who love thai or vietnamese dipping sauces. We served the scallops over basmati rice and spooned the sauce over both. It was very easy to make. One recommendation - use a good quality fish sauce or it may overwhelm the flavor. The sauce is delicate enough to let the taste of the scallops come through.

0 forks!!! The worst, most disappointing recipe I've ever used from this web site. The sauce was disgusting -- maybe because I didn't have a mortar and pestle to grind. I just put all sauce ingredients in the blender. Tasted overwhelmingly of fish sauce -- not pleasant. Don't waste your time. I used halibut instead of scallops. Broiled instead of seared.

Wonderful! Substituted shrimp and cod for scallops. Doubled the garlic and the chilis. Cooked it on the grill. Even our non-fish eating son loved it.
