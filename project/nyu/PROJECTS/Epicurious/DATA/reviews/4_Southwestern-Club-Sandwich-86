The spread is tasty! To make a simple sandwich, I just take a whole chicken breast (w/ s&p) and let it fry on a pan with a tablespoon of olive oil. I slice up the breast, dredge it through the mayo mixture, add bread, lettuce, tomatoes, and I'm done! =)

I took a reviewers suggestion and made with chicken breast cutlets marinated in buttermilk. (added gruyere chese to melt on top) and a guacamole to replace the avocado and tomato. Also used turkey bacon and a fresh whole wheat seed bread. The flavors were outstanding! I served it next to a baby greens, cucumbers, shredded carrots, and sprout salad with a sweet balsalmic viniagrette to compliment the spicy in the sandwich. We both loved it!

Great sandwich....souped up mayo was a hit! Used sliced chicken and guacamole instead of turkey and avocado with really great results. This will be a "go to" favorite this summer!

We have a monthly dinner club and we took our group on a picnic. We made this and several other sandwich recipes from Epicurious. This was by far the favorite of everyone.

I have made this sandwich several times for my family. The mixture of the bread spread is wonderful. We have prepared this recipe for several years at least once a month. It is a keeper.

Excellent. The spread itself can make any sandwich shine. The other ingridents are to your choice. I used steamed chicken thigh i/o turkey. Great for summer.

My husband found this recipe, as we are trying to vary are meals at home, while keeping them simple because of our work schedule. We absolutely love the flavor.

This recipe was great! Every year we receive a smoked turkey for Christmas and wonder what to do with it. The mayonaise was superb! I did add the cumin and served it on toasted cracked what bread and my family loved it. The combination was great. I made the sandwich with no meat for my vegetarian daughter and she thought it was fabulous. I will definitely make this sandwich again.

I've made this over and over again since I found the recipe. It just keeps getting better - it's really more than the sum of its parts. I've tried both sourdough and whole-grain bread and preferred the whole-grain. I also reduce the cumin in the mayo by half to keep it from overwhelming the other ingredients. Give this a try on a hot night when you don't want to heat up the house!

This recipe makes a great sandwich. I omitted the cumin from the aoili because all the other ingredients are so fresh and I wanted to keep that sensation. We loved it would definately make it again. I'll try a whole grain bread next time.

Delicious, especially the mayonnaise which could be adapted to many uses. Hearty and filling sandwich.

Delicious sandwich. My avocado wasn't ripe unfortunately, so couldn't use it, but I'll try that next time. The mayo was amazing and can be used on many different sandwiches. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this sandwich.

Have made this many times. Made it for a casual dinner for a family reunion making a couple cups of the mayo. Huge hit! We used the leftover mayo throughout the week for various sandwiches. It is great.

I loved this recipe!! My friends (who are some of the pickiest eaters I know) said it was the best sandwich they'd ever had -- and I agree!

Rave reviews from the family. Already made it a second time. The mayo dressing is very good, I didn't have a jalepeno pepper and it good without it - just used a little more cumin. I used a toasted pane bread from our local italian deli.

I thought this was a good sandwich, but not great. Unfortunately my avocado was not ripe and didn't have the flavor I was looking for. Also, the garlic was a bit much, even though I am a garlic lover. I will try this again and tinker with it a little.

This was the first dish I tried from the show. I have a stable of picky eaters, and every one of them loved it. The only thing I did different was to add olive oil to the toasting of the French bread on the second side

How could you go wrong with bacon and avocado? YUM! The jalepeno mayonnaise is delightful.

I made this recipe using sourdough rolls to make individual sandwiches for a SuperBowl party. Turned out excellent -- people snapped them up quickly! Several people asked for the recipe.

This is a wonderful sandwich. A classic club with a nice zing to it. Its wonderful for summer or winter meals. The jalepenos can add some heat to a cold day!
