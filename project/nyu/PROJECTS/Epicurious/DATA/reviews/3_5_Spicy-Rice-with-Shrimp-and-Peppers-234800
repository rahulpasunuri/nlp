I could not find annatto powder so I used some tumeric for color. I used juice of half lime for the shrimp. Also, no scotch bonnet or habanero so I used two serrano. It was very good once I added enough salt, but I agree with previous review the rice is a little "gloppy". I found the dressing on top to be vital to the dish. Also added a few drops of siracha to my bowl to bring up the heat. (Is it me or are peppers just not hot anymore?) I would make it again, but it wouldn't be top of my list for shrimp/rice dishes.

We love this and make it all the time. It depends on the heat of the chili as to how spicey it turns out. Yummy!

I saved the shrimp shells and added them to the clam juice and let them steep together. Drained them baefore adding to rice. Wow, what a taste treat. We love this dish. J. Nelson Vero Beach, FL

Rice comes out gloppy--too wet. No fire, notwithstanding extra chile. Simply put: wouldn't make it again.

I made this tonight with a few adjustments. Had no clam juice so I made stock out of the shrimp shells that I removed from the shrimp. I used chopped green,yellow and red peppers also. Needed to add more salt and pepper at the end, but the dish turned out great! None of us saw the value in the dressing that I made at the beginning. A keeper!

No rating--haven't made the recipe. The olive oil, vinegar and onions are the dressing. See the last sentence of the recipe.

So when do you add the "Whisk extra-virgin olive oil, 2 teaspoons vinegar, and 2 chopped green onions in small bowl. Season with salt and pepper." portion?

Could I use cooked and peeled, frozen prawns? and if so should I saute them as per the recipe or just add them at the end to heat through?

This is really good rice! I love this site because it lets us review each recipe. Thanks for the comments. I made it with chicken broth and didn't use the powder. I have made it with and without shrimp. It is good both ways. I paired it with the pan seared tilapia recipe on this site.

I am always grateful to read other's reviews before making a dish - thank you all. Thus I am adding my experience. I changed this dish from shrimp to 1 chicken breast and took the suggestion for chicken broth not clam juice and omitted the powder. I used a whole lime for marinating the chicken vs a tablespoon. I increased the green onion to 8 and used a whole green pepper. Others suggested the spice factor was limited so I used a whole habanero and dashes of cayenne and red pepper flakes while cooking. My husband is from AZ and felt it reached his level of desired spice and flavor. Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. I ordered the annatto powder from wholespice.com where I also found other spices I had been looking for. My husband and I loved the recipe and plan to use it for the main course for our Wine and Dine Club. I was a bit confused when it said to serve with "dressing" but then realized that the dressing was the olive oil, vinegar and chopped green onions mentioned in the first sentence. We loved it - there was none left. I will probably try adding more rice next time and adjust the ingredients accordingly.

very good recipes, followed previous reviewer and used chicken stock instead of clam juice. Only one thing I would change, not spicy enough, needed to use more than 1 pepper. Will do that next time.

Left out the annatto powder, used more garlic and had only brown rice in the pantry. My husband loved it! We were 2 for dinner and there was nothing left over! I Will make it for company, doubling the recipe.

I gave this 4 forks but I did not follow it to the book. I used chicken stock instead of clam juice. Removed annatto power but sprinkled paprika at the end. Instead of bell peppers , I replaced with pimentos, used less vinegar in rice, I did not need the dressing and replaced cilantro with shadon beni and used chive instead of green onions...I have been asked to make this again, it will be the third time I do so!

I need to try this recipe again, the first time was not what I wanted to make. I used more than 1T of lime juice so the shimp started turning into cerviche but once they hit the saute pan, the taste was really good. 1/4c olive oil is too much for my skillet so i'd reduce the amount to just coat my pan. I used a pinch of cayenne instead of annatto. Leave the seeds in the habaneros for the hot and spicy effect. As with any recipe, I want to make it a few times to get it just right for me.

Great and very easy. Good enough for company... or just for yourself. Leave out the annatto powder... apparently it's primarily used for it's red coloring. Highly recommended, along with many other recipes from this edition of Bon Appetit.

Another fabulous recipe from this Bon Appetit. This edition was full of great recipes. I added lots of habanero, but this was just easy and very good. Highly recommended.
