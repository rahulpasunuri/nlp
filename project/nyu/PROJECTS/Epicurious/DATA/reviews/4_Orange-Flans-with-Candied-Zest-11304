The longer these sat in my fridge the better they tasted. Also, the caramel completely liquefied after a few days in the fridge. If you want to try this, I recommend pressing plastic wrap firmly on the exposed flan so that the exposed surface doesn't harden. Great tasting make ahead dessert!

Great flan - best one I have tasted. Don't skip any of the garnishes, as they really do enhance the dessert greatly. The only thing I changed in this recipe is that I added 1 tbsp instead of 1 tsp of orange blossom water, and I also added another tsp of orange oil. Delicious dessert!

Doubled the recipe and divided between two cazuelas to bake. Cooking time was only 45 minutes. Absolutely fabulous flan. Silken texture was perfect. (DO NOT skip the sieving!) Candied peels are such a wonderful accent. I still have some weeks later- they dry out and get wonderfully crunchy. Add to toasted almonds for your cocktail snack. Only head scratcher is how to get the caramel deep and dark before it bubbles away into hard-crack stage. Any tips?

Made X 1.5 and divided between two cazuelas that fit snugly into my large roasting pan. Serves 20. Absolutely stunning texture and delicate flavor. Sieving is a must. Yeah, not all of the caramel releases upon turning but there is plenty to enjoy. I garnished with orange supremes macerated a few hours in orange honey and Grand Marnier. The candied strips put the whole dessert over the top.

the custard turned out so silky - delicious, and everyone at our dinner party loved them, however I had the same problem of most of the caramel remaining in the bottom of the ramekins. I added a little pure orange extract (didn't have the orange flower water) when simmering the milk, zest, sugar mixture - and it gave the perfect orangey end result I was looking for.

Made these for a dinner party. Rave reviews - so light, so beautiful, great subtle orange taste, love the zest! Would definitely make again. One problem...when unmolding, most of the caramel stayed in my ramekins. I did surround the ramekins with very hot water and left them in the water for a few minutes but to no avail. A small smount did come out and surround the plate so nobody really knew. I just felt all that great caramel sauce with the Grand Marnier got wasted. Only used the rind from 2 oranges to make the candied zest.

so easy to make and the candied zest was to die for. The zest would be good with cheesecakes as well... The dish was a perfect ending to our sumptuous feast for Cinco de Mayo.

This made a really lovely dessert for my guests. It had a wonderfully subtle orange flavor. The custard was light, as I think a flan should be, and the Grand Marnier syrup was very tasty. I wish the site would provide the original photos from the magazine more often. I wanted to see how the candied zests were used as decoration. I did mine like this (http://www.facebook.com/photo.php? pid=30294956&l=0e33d&id=1114175121), though I would have loved to be able to recreate the zests and flans as shown in this photo I found on the Internet (http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/ 2007/03/27/dining/28pass190.6.jpg)

i skipped the candied zest part -- the flan had more than enough orange flavor and was incredibly creamy and not eggy (in a bad way) at all. i'm very picky about flan, and this one was fabulous!

This wasn't bad, but I had a couple of problems with the recipe. Can anyone tell me how long it took their caramel to get a nice, deep color? I cooked mine forever and it remained pale golden. That didn't hurt the flavor, it just didn't look as nice. My zest was still sticky even after 6 hours of drying (on a dry, windy day), but it tasted fine. I couldn't taste much of an orange flavor in the custard itself, although the zest made up the difference. I'm not sure I'd put the effort into making this again, but I'm glad I tried it.

The zest did not dry like I wuld have liked it to, but the dish was a complete success with all our guests. I will serve it again and again.
