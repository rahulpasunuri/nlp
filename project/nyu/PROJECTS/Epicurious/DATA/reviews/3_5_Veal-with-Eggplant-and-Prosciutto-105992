This was delicious and really not that difficult (although it does sound complicated). Would pair nice with some crusty bread to sop up the jucies or some couscous.

12/2008 - this recipe is very good and has a great presentation. The veal cutlets that I bought were 4 ounces each and I should have pounded them as they did turn out a little tough - not enough to ruin the meal. The mushroom mixture is very generous and could be cut back as it is a BIG mound on top of the eggplant/veal. One half was all I could eat!! I served this with Brown and Wild Rice Medley from Healthy Cooking.

Scrumptious, company good, and restaurant quality, this dish is a winner. I used tenderized veal cutlets instead of scallopini. Brush the eggplant well around the edges and don't roast it too long.

This was very good, easy and it looks good too, but it was not mind-blowing. I'll make it again, but I will be searching for better recipes in the meantime.

I make this recipe with pork tenderloin that I always keep in the freezer. I pound it thin and follow the directions. Cheaper, convenient and wonderful.

This is a great recipe. I cook often and food this recipe fun to prepare, especially with a bottle of vino :). Have no idea what previous reviewer is talking about.

Easy and delicious. Works well with chicken paillard too. No need for all that butter either.

This was outstanding! I made it as written and it was absolutely delicious. This recipe is now in our "worthy for company" repertoire. Next time, I'll reduce the number of pans I use by sauteeing the veal, setting it aside, and then making the sauce in the same pan with the drippings.

With all the great reviews & wonderful ingredients I thought this would be a no brainer. I followed the recipe as written with the only ingredient exception being baby bella mushrooms instead of shiitake. I also pounded the veal & let the shrooms cook alone for a short while to crisp them before adding the scallions, tomatoes, & wine. My result was not memorable. Perhaps the eggplant is the deciding factor. Mine was fresh but seedy (not sure how to correct for this). The meal had some flavor but I wouldn't bother with all the preparation and wonderful ingredients for a mediocre outcome.

Delicious dish but with some helpful tips for insured veal tenderness. I was a bit concerned to try out this recipe for a special meal as a few reviewers commented that the finished veal was somewhat tough. I asked my good friend, a CIA chef, for his wise advice to cooking veal. Veal, like most cuts of fine red meat, can and actually should be served a bit pink in the center and because it can be high in connective tissue, really needs a good pounding. Here's what to do. Pound the veal quite thin between 2 pieces of plastic. You should be able to see some light pass through it when held up to a window/light source. Do NOT overcook, this is the result of tough veal. Flash cook the veal for only 30 seconds on each side. If it's a bit pink on the inside, this is fine as it will continue to cook even more when placed in the oven for the final 5 minutes of baking. I was delighted at the results as I had a very tender and flavorful veal dish. Came out absolutely perfect. Thanks Chef Andrew!

I love all the ingredients in this recipe and when I made it I wasn't disappointed. Follow the directions for sauteing the veal as that is key to a tender dish. A little extra work but the flavor is wonderful. This recipe is a "keeper" in my book.

This recipe was a little time consuming but absolutely worth it. I served it for a dinner party and got RAVE reviews. It really is delicious.

We liked the flavors of this recipe, but had terrible luck with the veal this time. Sometimes when I buy veal, it is tender and wonderful, other times it is very tough. This time it was similar to shoe leather. If anyone has any selection or preparation tips to help me, I'd really appreciate it. Restaurants seem to have more consistantly tender veal -what's the secret?

I was searching for a recipe to use some ingredients I had on hand, eggplant, prosciutto, tomatoes and common mushrooms when I found this recipe. I didn't have veal, shitakes or green onions, so I am not going to insult the original with a fork rating. I made the tomato sauce as written using shallots and garlic instead of green onions, sauteing them first in the butter before adding the tomatoes and substitued white mushrooms. I pounded the chicken breasts down to about 3/8 " and cooked a little longer, adding rosemary toward the end. I layered as directed and used the provolone. It didn't take quite as much butter to saute chicken breasts and I used a little less in the sauce. It was so rich and delicious and I would definitely make it again. Wouldn't hesitate to try the original recipe, either.

friend of ours made this for us. It was fast enough not to make us wait, and slow enough to be able to enjoy an aperitif before dinner....and it was heavenly to taste, all 5 of us agreed!

I have previously used a recipe from a well know Italian chef.This recipe is easier and a lot more flavorful. The whole Italian family agrees.
