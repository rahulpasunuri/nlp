We loved these, and made a few changes to the great basic recipe based on earlier reviews. I substituted store- bought coconut for the fresh; cut the fish sauce in half for both the rolls and the sauce; and made the dipping sauce as is, adding 3 tBSP bottled asian duck sauce, 1 TBSP rice vinegar, and a few shakes of cayenne. We absolutely loved it and will make it again and again. Thanks for the recipe

As others have said, this recipe was dull. The fresh coconut is far too much trouble. I think if I were to try this again, I would reduce the quantity and just use packaged shredded coconut and toast it a bit to bring out the flavor. I also agree about the overly-lime dipping sauce. Half a cup is far too much. I would probably do something along the lines of 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/2 to 1 tablespoon fish sauce, 2 teaspoons of a chile paste (instead of fresh minced -- gives more flavor), and 1/8 cup of lime juice. I would also probably drop or reduce the sugar (maybe use brown sugar?) and add a tablespoon of coconut milk to soften it all a bit. This is all off the top of my head, but the general proportions seem about right. The added saltiness from the soy sauce alone would bump up the flavor exponentially.

Quite bland. I agree with other reviewers that the dipping sauce was basically just lime juice and didn't help a dish that was already pretty bad.

I had been so excited to try this recipe...they looked so tasty! I was really disappointed though! The coconut was a real waste of time as it added nothing to the flavor. The dipping sauce was not much more than lime juice! I would possibly try these again, but omit the coconut and find a new dipping sauce recipe.

This tasted great. I thought the coconut was a lot of work and I didn't taste it at all in the rolls. Besides that they were delicious.

i used a tad less coconut, a little less fish sauce and omitted the chiles in the rolls. I put a bit of chile oil in the dipping sauce. that way we could enjoy the spice but my kids didn't have to suffer it. will make again.

I really liked this recipe, although I thought it was a little bland so I added some salt and chile paste to the mix. Great overall though and I will definitely make again.
