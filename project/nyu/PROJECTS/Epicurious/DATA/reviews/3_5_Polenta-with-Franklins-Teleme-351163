I used this recipe to accompany Cornish hens with sausage stuffing. My guests, whom previously didn't care for polenta, really raved about this dish. I used mascarpone and grated pecorino romano cheese.

its polenta. with cheese. nothing exciting here. I might fry the rest just to see if that is more interesting.

Very easy - very good. Works with all different kinds of cheese - I tried this as written and also w/ gorgonzola, and just straight parmesan and butter. All yummy!

This was soooo good! comfort food at its finest! I had to substitute ready made polenta for the other because I couldn't find it locally. Basically I just chopped up the brick of ready made polenta, put in the marscapone and kept mixing until it all integrated together. Was great, and warmed up well. Next time I'll keep looking for the other type of polenta just in case!

Telemea is a traditional Romanian cheese made out of either cow's or sheep's milk. It is usually salty but soft. The closest thing I have found in the US to traditional Romanian cheese is feta. I have made this recipe over and over again and it slowly replaced all sides to my dishes!
