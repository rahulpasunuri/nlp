I finally found this recipe again! It was printed in Gourmet as "Election Night Supper" and I lost the issue after a move. It is really good for a snowy Saturday evening with a bottle 'o wine, or made the day ahead. Great with the paprika rice, or noodles. Absolute comfort food.

We really liked this. I made a half recipe and had to add a bit more liquid as the pork cooked. Based on reviews here, I didn't use the full amount of flour called for and that worked out well. I'll definitely make this again but with noodles instead of rice.

I've made this both according to the recipe with pork but also with rabbit. Both were excellent. (With the rabbit, I made baking powder dumplings.) I agree with earlier reviewer to use less water upfront and avoid reducing the liquid toward the end.

Truly a wonderful recipe. Tastes even better as a Ragu and served on Pasta.

I forgot one thing. The prep time takes too long. It took me most of the morning and afternoon, counting making the meatballs (which, of course, is my own addition)

I would make this again with changes. I'ts not necessary to boil the liquid down to 3 cups; in fact I wouldn't reduce it at all. I would use less water and more chicken stock, half and half in the mushroom mix. My market didn't have shoulder so I used a conglomeration of different cuts; neck meat, little ribs, the little ends of loin, etc plus I made a mixture of ground turkey and pork meatballs. With all that, it was very tasty.

I have made this a number of times, we've loved it each time! I substituted red bell pepper for the celery because it was what I had, that was a lucky thing because we prefer it that way. The red bell pepper adds a subtle sweetness to the dish which makes it so interesting and delicious. This is a solid winner.

Quite a bit of work but the result was excellent. I added a tablespoon of brandy to the mushrooms after I had stirred in the flour, and I also added dried thyme and some chopped capers. I served it with the paprika rice which is the right accompaniment. The dish in its entirety has German/Austrian influences and made an excellent Christmas dinner.

This was delicious served over broad egg noodles. Comfort food at it's best!

Exquisite! I made it with half cream and half milk, left out 2 cups of the water,and cut a tablespoon of the oil out as well. The flavor and texture were still everything they should have been. I also cooked the carrots along with the other vegetables so that their texture was buttery, and added more lemon juice than was called for. Don't pass this one up!

We loved this dish! I used pork tenderloin instead of pork shoulder -- browning and removing it; then returning it when the cream is added. Because this cut of meat doesn't need to simmer, I cut the chicken broth back to 2 cups and the water back to 1/2 cup and simply simmered the vegetables. I used the previous reviewers suggestion of using baby carrots and a little thyme -- worked wonderfully. My only suggestion is to cut the flour waaaay back, personally next time I will eliminate it altogether (it made it slightly gummy for our taste and I used less than 1/4 cup) and instead concentrate on reducing the cream down to the desired consistency. This is winner!

I've loved this dish ever since it first appeared, and have made it many times. Always a hit, and great for casual company. It's a little bit time-consuming, but worth it - and keeps well if you make ahead or have left-overs, what a bonus when you're busy. I like adding a good squeeze of lemon juice - probably 3 Tbsps - which for me really lifts the flavour and makes this special. When I made it last night, I tried adding a few sprigs of fresh thyme when the pork was cooking, and for once I cheated and used whole baby carrots - both variations worked very well. I'm definitely going to try it with noodles as the other reviewers suggest, but I do like the paprika rice a lot (see "full menu") - this is also one of the best ways of cooking rice I've tried. A keeper!

When this recipe first appeared in Gourmet, I made it for our one of weekly Sunday football dinner parties. I called it "Pork Stew" and served it over buttered egg noodles. To this day, my guests still reminiscence about how great that pork stew was.

An excellent winter dish. Even better the next day. We prefer buttered noodles to the rice.

This verged on 4 forks. Quite tasty. I used a little white wine to deglaze pan after frying the meat. Nice way to use a cheaper cut of meat - had to simmer it a little while longer than stated in recipe to get it tender.

A delicious diosh. I'll make it agin and perhaps try using veal instead of pork.
