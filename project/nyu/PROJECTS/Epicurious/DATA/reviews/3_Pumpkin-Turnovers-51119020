These are very good. I followed the recipe for the filling exactly as described with a sugar pumpkin. I used all the piloncillo but I think next time I will cut it by 1/4 or a 1/2 for my tastes. I used the basic empanada dough on this site instead, since I don't normally bake with shortening. It makes a lot of filling, but it freezes well. They were well received by everyone.

These are SO GOOD! I didn't use fresh pumpkin - used canned pumpkin, and it turned out just fine! I can't wait to make these again for the holidays! Buena receta!

After I mashed the pumpkin, I did not get any liquid, just a relatively dry pumpkin pulp. Since I was unable to simmer any liquid, I skipped that step and heated the pumpkin puree with ground cinnamon, cloves, and the brown sugar. I also added a little ginger. My fiance loved the end result and requested I make them again. I thought they were pretty delicious. I made them with the cafe azul empanada dough on epicurious because I had some left over from a different recipe.
