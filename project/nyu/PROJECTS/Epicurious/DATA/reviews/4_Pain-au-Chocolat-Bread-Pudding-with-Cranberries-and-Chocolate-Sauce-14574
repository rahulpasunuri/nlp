Made this for an Oscar party and it was a huge hit. I left out the cranberries and served it with caramel sauce. I think if I were to do it again, I would not sprinkle the chocolate pieces around but maybe blend them with the milk and cream so the liquid would be chocolate flavored. But still, everyone loved it.

I have made this dessert numerous times and passed the recipe on to a number of happy guests. I did increase the milk and cream component to 1 1/2 cups each and used 2oz more of the chocolate. I used fresh raspberries and served with whipped cream. It was delicious!

This is a fantastic recipe. I went looking for this recipe after having a similar dish at a bakery. I am normally a bread pudding hater, but this recipe is delicious. I only added 1/4 cup extra cream. I also mixed the pudding mixture after it sat for 2 hours. This seemed to help coat all the croissants evenly. As opposed to just pouring the custard over the top.

Terrific recipe. I would love to know if anyone has tried this recipe substituting the cranberries with orange marmalade.

I'm going to write one of *those* reviews, you know, where I say the recipe is amazing... so long as you change it completely. Bear with me. It all started when I overcooked some muffins, the top two-thirds of them were still fantastic so I needed to find something to do with them. Bread Pudding! Of course. Since they were orange-cranberry, those were my search terms and this came up. I also already had a bowl full of orange-cranberry relish. Like it was meant to be. I chopped up 23 day-old muffins (minus the too-dark bottoms) and dried them in the oven for about 30 minutes on a pizza pan with holes in the bottom. Not completely dried, but close enough. Following other reviewer's notes, I increased the custard and it still could have used a little more. My husband commented it was more like really moist cake, not sticky like bread pudding - that was a pro to others in the group though: 5 eggs, 3/4 c sugar (didn't double this because my relish is already sugared), 1-1/2 c milk, 1-1/2 c cream, 2 t vanilla, 1/2 t salt. I increased the chocolate layer to 5 ounces. And since I already had orange-cranberry relish, I used 3/4 relish and cut in another 3/4 c cranberries, chopping them all up in my Cuisinart. It was just right, not too sweet. I assembled the whole thing and let it soak overnight. Served it warm with chocolate sauce (was now out of cream so I used half and half). And a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream. Rave reviews - even from self- professed bread pudding haters. It made a large 9x11 glass casserole, 12 generous servings.

I made this again for the second time with a few modifications. You need to increase the egg mixture by 50% or else it is too dry. I serve mine with a homemade carmel sauce and vanilla gelato. My book club will love this tomorrow night with a glass of wine!

I cook the cranberries before adding them and also add extra cranberries and chocolate. This recipe has been a hit no matter where I take it! I had one person tell me they hate bread pudding but love this dish. I also use a caramel sauce rather than chocolate sauce.

I've made this recipe several times. Everybody adores it. Yes, you will most likely need to make a little extra custard. I make individual puddings in muffin tins and place the tins in a sheet pan of hot water. You only need to let them cool maybe 20 minutes--they're better warm. Invert them on a plate, drizzle 'em with chocolate sauce and/or creme anglaise and you've got yourself a hit!

Fantastic! Made it for a dinner party with couple minor changes. Used 6 large croissants, by the time they had dried in the oven they totalled +- 9 cups cubed. Made more liquid per previous posts by using 1.5 cups whole milk and 1.5 cups heavy cream. And substituted the fresh raspberries for the cranberries. Oh and I didn't feel like more chocolate so used a caramel sauce (from Whole Foods) instead. Served 8 adults and 1 or 2 adventurous kids. Not a bite left over.

One of the best desserts I've ever made, or eaten. I heeded others' advice and made extra custard (ended up using about 1 2/3 recipes). Be sure to measure the croissants - it only took 5 of the kind I bought. I substituted mandarin oranges for cranberries, and added Grand Marnier instead of vanilla; bananas or cherries or pears or pineapple would work nicely as well, or it can stand alone without fruit. I served it with whipped cream. Next time I might add a little more chocolate in the pudding. A super- easy recipe, great for company b/c it's entirely made ahead and cooks while you're eating dinner.

This bread pudding is wonderfully rich but not too sweet. Next time I'd increase the amount of liquid because the top layer was a bit dry, but this is a pretty simple and delicious dessert, not to mention a great way to use fresh cranberries.

So I changed it a bit but it was delicious! I am totally making this again. Made custard (without cranberries) and added some melted homemade marmelade (candied orange zest would work as well). Served with whipped cream instead of chocolate sauce and it was amazing!

Rich and delicious! I made individual bread puddings substituting raspberries for the cranberries. I did add extra egg/cream mixture as suggested in other reviews. I served this with vanilla ice cream and raspberries, not chocolate sauce.

It was rich and delicious. I too omitted the cranberries and since it was Christmas time, I used eggnog instead of cream and milk. Based on other reviews, I added more liquid. I used 2 and 1/2 cups eggnog and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I think it could have used more liquid. It was well liked and I would make again.

Noone else seemed to mention this, but I needed twice the liquid for the amount of croissants. The bottom layer with the custard was delicious, the top tasted like buttery croutons. Used more chocolate in the middle and skipped the sauce. Will try again doubling the custard part.

This is delicious -- the bread pudding is not as moist and "eggy" as I like bread puddings, but the flavor is wonderful, rather ethereal. I did not skimp on any ingredients -- croissants from a French bakery, organic cranberries, and high quality bittersweet chocolate. I would make this again, but I would substitute cherries, pears and candied ginger, or mandarin oranges for the cranberries. I don't usually make that sort of substitution, but I'm not sure why cranberries were used in this recipe, when the above fruits would taste better with chocolate. The bite from the cranberries definitely worked in the dish's favor, but could be gotten from a better source.

I've made this a couple of times before but on the weekend I made up a half quantity of this recipe (my normal changes: replaced the cranberries with raspberries, used 70% cacao lindt chocolate, don't make the chocolate sauce) ... then disaster struck, I ran out of gas for the oven. So I microwaved it! 2 minutes on high, 4 minutes on medium power, then 4 minutes on low power until the custard was cooked. Other than it didn't have a crispy top, the taste was delicious and wasn't too different to the oven version! My guests were silent as they completely cleaned their bowls! This recipe is one of my favourites for dinner parties, no preparation when guests are around.

EXCELLENT. I added more chocolate on the top of the pudding before adding the soaking liquid. Made the sauce with a combo of white and dark chocolate and served with whipped cream flavored with sugar and vanilla. There was none left.. A definite keeper.

I've made this dish many times for special occasions, and it's always a hit. I omit the cranberries (not a favorite), and it's fabulous! I prepare it early in the day and bake while we have dinner.

Another Christmas, another chocolate-croissant bread pudding to make. This is a wonderful dish that gets raves and sticks in people's memories. We've always skipped the cranberries (why mess up chocolate with sour little berries?!) and added a tish more chocolate ("less is more" doesn't work when it comes to chocolate!) As you've probably already guessed, chocolate lovers will love this! The croissants and bread pudding cut the richness of the chocolate and show it off well. YUM!

I simplified the whole process by using choclate croissants-no sauce or berries. So good it's like drugs. Huge hit at Thanksgiving dinner-my Mom took half of it home without even asking. And it's just ridiculously easy! Go for it!

The croissants make this dessert very moist. For a variation..try substituting the cranberries for whole raspberries and use white chocolate to drizzle on single portions..looks beutiful and tastes excellent!

I don't know what everyone was raving about. It was a bunch of soggy croissants with a little bit of chocolate. The other chocolate bread puddings that I have had have been sinfully chocolate. This had a hint of chocolate and it definitely needed the chocolate sauce. I think it needed about 5 times the chocolate sauce to make it taste like anything!!! I am removing it from my recipe file because even if I was desperate for something to make, I would not make this!

I made this recipe with raspberries as it was raspberry season. Totally delicious and very rich!! It didn't need the chocolate sauce at all, and next time I would skip that bit. Easy preparation makes it suitable for a dinner party, as it can sit in the fridge until guests arrive, then bake whilst they eat their first courses.

A great dish for the holidays! Looks festive, tastes wonderful and foolproof to make. My first bread pudding and everyone raved! Chilled overnight before baking and had no problems with it being dry. Rewarms nicely also. The only potential change might be to opt for a sauce that isn't quite so rich.

I loved this recipe. It has quickly become a favorite of friends and family. I make it every Christmas for brunch.

I liked the mixture of chocolate and cranberries, although the pudding was a little dry. Next time I will add more liquid for the bread to soak in.

This is a fabulous recipe. The chocolate sauce is delicious but makes it a very rich dessert. I also offered a creme anglaise on the side, and I preferred it this way. Great for entertaining.
