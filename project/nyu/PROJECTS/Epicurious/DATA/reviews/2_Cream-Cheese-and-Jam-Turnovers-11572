Not enough jelly and not too crazy about cream cheese in desserts. Somewhat overpowering. We did have them sit for about 30 mintues prior to serving. This could have been the problem. Definitely use more jelly.

I have made this several times for friends and for the office. Each time, I have been asked for the recipe--it was so delicious!
