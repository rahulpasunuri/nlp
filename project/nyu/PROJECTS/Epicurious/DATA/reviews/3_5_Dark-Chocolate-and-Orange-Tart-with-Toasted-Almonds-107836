Just made this for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews! The crust is a bit difficult to work with and overall it is time-consuming but well worth the effort. The candied orange peel takes quite a bit longer than 20 minutes.

I too made this as part of Thanksgiving dessert course and had a lot of pleased eaters. I added egg whites to the crust to try to prevent the sagging, and baked blind with ceramic pie weights for, in the end, 15 minutes (I had a larger dia. pie shell) and another 5-10 mins without. I also struggled getting the dough into the dish, despite chilling the dough ball, and then chilling the rolled dough. I ended up cutting a circle for the base, then plastering the sides in place with a palette knife. I also had trouble with the ganache separating as I poured it, something that hasn't happened to me before. I saved it by scraping it back into a pot and tempering it by re-heating and stirring in a bar of chocolate. Of course I lost the layered aspect, but the dessert was still super rich, and super tasty. I had a teetotal, so instead of Marnier, I used Orange Flower Water.

I made this for Thanksgiving. It was fantastic...With all other desserts , this was the one to finish first and some people had to make do with left over crumbs..

I made this for Thanksgiving with friends, it was loved by all. Since others complained of the curst "melting" when cooked, I changed the recipe and used about 2 Tbsp less butter, and about 1 Tbsp extra flour. The crust held us really well when cooking. Also, I used honey instead of sugar in the almond fillings, to ensure there was a solid consistency to this layer. It turned out great!

I'm avowed chocoholic, and chocolate/orange is my favorite combo, but I just can't get behind this one. The crust was impossible to work with (dry/hard), even though I minced the candied peel very small, it still had a funny chewy mouth feel when encountered. I can only give it 2 forks and I'd not make it again.

Truly delicious. Very very close to too rich. I had trouble with the orange peel sticking so used a tip from another reader and mixed it into the almonds and sugar. Also mixed in some chocolate sauce. I baked the crust 10 mins with weights and 4 naked, and the whole thing still slid to the bottom of the pan and had to be sculpted. Annoying. But, it tasted extraordinary. Just be sure to serve in teeny slices. Whew! Like eating a giant truffle.

Absolutely decadent and this recipe always turns out perfectly. I've made this for many people and it just disappears at parties. Serving it with fresh whipped cream and berries or pomegranate really complements the richness of the chocolate.

this tart is SO good! it does take some time to make. i usually make the crust and candied orange peel on one day, and the filling and chilling the next day. it's well worth it though. i'm not sure if it's just me, but i have issues getting the dough in to the tart pan. and the sides always fall/melt when baking that i have to reshape the whole thing once i take the crust out of the oven. no big deal though, it still tastes amazing!

Made this for Thanksgiving dessert and received raves for it. Went with 12 oz of chocolate and 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream as suggested by another user. I used a different chocolate crust recipe which required no rolling...pressed into tart pan which made this even easier. Guests loved it.

One of my favorite deserts to make! I love a good decadent desert and try to make one each week if not to share with others then to enjoy myself as a special treat for my afternoon snack with tea. This is heavenly and goes quite well with a good sharp cup of "quality" Earl Grey or Darjeeling Tea. Good chocolate deserts, like this one brighten anyones day, everyday!

Serve in small slices with LIGHTLY sweetened whipped cream.

Absolutely delicious, easy and impressive! The only problem I had with the crust was when I chilled the dough overnight it was hard as a rock and I couldn't roll it out - one hour chilling works better. I was worried the ganache would harden too much so I added about 4 tbsp. more cream. Do not pour the filling in all at once - rather, pour it slowly over the orange peel/almonds starting at the outside of the crust working your way in - that way you get the "layered" look so important to the presentation. I also used orange peel from 2 oranges - that way there was plenty to flavor the tart and plenty for garnish. I used Ghirardelli cocoa and BITTERSWEET chocolate!

I can't believe I've never posted a review after four years of making this tart. This is absolutely my failproof dessert if I really want to impress. I always use 12 0z chocolate, 1 1/2 cups cream, always stir about a half cup of the chocolate into the almonds/orange peel/cinnamon before lining the crust with the mixture. I think the extra sugar that crumbles off the orange peel when you chop it adds a lovely layer of flavor. My family has a completely unprintable nickname for this tart...

Rating: 3
I thought this was delicious, although I made some changes by increasing the orange peel and chopping the almonds more finely. The combinations below the chocolate provided great complexity in each bite.

Does serve many but leftovers lasted about 5 seconds! A little dense for my taste, but really really good. Important to use dark, bittersweet chocolate to avoid cloying sweetness. Whipped cream is a must.

This recipe was ok, but nothing special. I thought for the time it took (to candy the orange and chill the crust) the dessert should have been better. If I am going to dedicate that kind of time to making a dessert there are others I like better.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious, a house favourite. To avoid "the three seperate layers - when the chocolate had not bonded with the almond and orange layer..." i mixed the almond/orange with some of the chocolate mixture, poured into crust, then, slowly, poured the rest of the chocolate filling on top. Also, bake the crust much less time to avoid the over-crunchiness. A dinner guest favourite!

My husbanc made this tart for me for the second time this week for my birthday -- the first time on my 30th b-day, and now three years later it is better than ever! This is one of the best desserts ever for a chocolate lover like myself. I will have special memories of this tart for many years to come. Recommendation - serve in small slices -- extremely rich and decedant!

Rating: 3
I just made this for the second time. The first time I tried, the crust was a total disaster, so this time I used the Almond crust recipe from this website and, to balance it out, omitted the almonds from the filling. The result was fantastic, and I highly recommend this approach to anyone having trouble with the crust described here. With that change, this is one of the best make-ahead desserts I've found.

This totally rocked!

I had very high hopes for this dish, but came up against several problems. The crust was lovely - I followed previous advice and blind baked for 10 mins with baking beans and then for and additional 4 mins on its own, so no problems there. The big down was that the tart was in three seperate layers, and when I can to slice it, it came apart horizontally - the chocolate had not bonded with the almond and orange layer... any suggestions. It was, for my taste a little too sweet, even after following the advice and reducing the sugar content - I think that I would leave it out next time. Don't really know what went wrong - all the different components were lovely - v pleased with the candied orange etc, but as a whole I was underwhelmed - there are better recipes out there.

I was expecting rich, but this is RICH!!! Basically, its like eating chocolate ganache tart with orange flavouring. My husband said it needs to be served with whipped cream to 'lighten it'. I was pleasantly surprised by the orange, because when I tasted the candied peel after it cooked in syrup, it had a bitter edge, but in the chocolate tart...mmmmm. The almond flavour kind of gets lost in the chocolate though. They add a nice crunch, but next time I'll use toasted hazelnuts and lots of them for a stronger nut presence. The crust is easy to roll out between sheets of parchment, and looks very nice.

Rating: 4
Excellent presentation and taste. The orange peel did not turn out--too long in the syrup and it crystallized into a crunchy lump. Bought candied orange peel at the store and it worked just fine. Agree with just pressing the crust into the pan and also with 1 1/2 c cream and 12 oz chocolate. a most impressive dessert.

This was a big hit. My husband said it was the best dessert I ever made, which was saying a lot! Plus, it was extremely easy to make, and I like being able to make ahead. I didn't have any Grand Marnier, but next time I will be sure to get some. I didn't add any sugar to the almonds, other than the bit that was left from chopping up the orange peel, and it worked well. I used valharona cocoa in the crust and an 86% dark fine chocolate in the ganache. I see how this could be very versatile too, hazlenuts, pecans, different liquers... The top cracked a little bit, so next time I will cool it on the counter a while before it goes into the fridge. A keeper!

Chocolate and orange is one of my very favorite flavor combinations, and this dessert is a fabulous twist on it! It does need to stay relatively cool, otherwise it melts a little - I served it on a warm day, and had to make sure it stayed in the refrigerator until I was ready to serve it, as well as soon after it was cut to maintain it's shape. Next time I will serve it on a cooler day, seeing there will definetly be a next time!!!

Very nice tart, with a good blend of flavors and textures. The only correction I'd make is in sweetness of the chocolate on top. It wasn't way too sweet, but it could use a little less sweetness. Next time, I'll drop the sugar, and maybe even mix in some unsweetened chocolate. Also, very easy to make. In fact, I forgot the crust and left it in (no weights, no covering) for 25 minutes. It was melted down the sides, so I used a spoon to do some emergency surgery, practically scooping material from the bottom to put on the sides. Still was great! (Perhaps a little more cookie-like than for those of you who watched the time!)

This tart was really fabulous... the mixture of flavors was divine, and it really didn't take that long to make. It evens freezes beautifully, and comes out looking just as fresh and lovely as ever.

Rating: 3
I made the recipe incorporating many of the suggestions of others. The blind baking of the crust for 10 minutes and then 4 minutes without the pie weights worked great. The crust was firm but not hard. I would chop the almonds and orange rind into smaller pieces. I served with whipped cream and garnished with fresh kumquats. The tartness of the kumquats worked well with the sweetness of the tart. My guests raved over the presentation and the taste.

At last, a cake that beats my long-time favorite Chocolate Macamdemia Decadence (Bon Appetit Feb 92). But beware the '20 minutes' simmering for the peel: I suggest 5-7 minutes max. And a processor rather than beating seems to work better for the crust. Otherwise, great!

Rating: 3
WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW. I would give it a 3.5 actually. Followed advice of other. The only tricky part is the crust, I froze it for like30 minutes pricked and baked it. Turned out good. I did what the chef recommended and mix orange peel, nuts, sugar and cinamon together and placed on crusted. I tapped the chocolate when I poured. thte problem or feedback is the crust is a little crunch and wtih the nuts inbetween the chocolate separates when you cut it. But the taste and how it looks is divine.

I was skeptical about this recipe as I made it, but it turned out to be wonderful. I love the crust, and will use the recipe again for other tarts. Rather soft and buttery, not flaky. I did have a problem separating the dough from the wax paper into the tart pan. I ended up just squishing the dough into the pan with my fingers and smoothing the top off- It turned out just fine. I also used a little extra orange peel- about one and a half ornges- this helped the flavor. Next time I will add some cinnimon to the ganache. Can be chilled quickly by putting into the freezer for 30 mins and then the fridge for 90 mins- sets fine. My guests loved this tart!

the 1st time I made it I followed the recipe exactly - 2nd time I was in a rush so I made the crust, chilled 10 min. pressed it into the pie plate, chilled 20 minutes and baked - it turned out fine (I thought & guest LOVED it) and much easer then rolling the crust.

Loved this! I've made it twice - the first time my crust shrunk, so I blind baked it the second time and it worked like a charm. Then I added some more cinnamon to the cream for the ganache. Everyone licked their plates.

I have been baking this tart professionally since May. I have never had a problem with the nuts and orange peel falling out, however, I don't add sugar to the nuts, and I stir the nuts, cinnamon and orange peel together before layering over the crust, it helps ensures even distribution of the cinnamon, and the moist oranges soften the nuts. I also pour the chocolate very slowly; perhaps this allows the chocolate to settle into spaces between the nuts. I find that rather than chopping the almonds, crushing them in your fists gives much more even sized pieces, there is a little bit of nut powder, but it doesn't cause a problem. Regarding the crust, beating it long enough before chilling helps with the dryness when rolling. I bake it blind for 15 minutes (I make sure that the foil doesn't touch the top edge of the crust, just the bottom and tight to the sides, this ensures that the crust keeps a pleasing shape), and then remove the foil and pie weights and bake 10 more minutes. The crust is delightfully crispy and a nice contrast to the smooth creamy filling. I usually prepare crust and candied orange the night before, bake the shell and fill the tart the second day, chill it overnight and serve it on the following day. This allows flavours to blend and mellow. It is without a doubt the most popular dessert served at the restaurant.

Rating: 3
My advice for this recipe is to definitely let it chill overnight. I served it after the recommended 3 hour chilling time and while the center was set the candied oranges were hard and very chewey. I had some the next day and the oranges had blended nicely. I added about a 1/4 cup ganache to the nut mixture to make for easy cutting...worked well. I also took others advice and added 1.5 cups cream with 12oz chocolate, used 1.5 oranges and baked the crust for 10 min instead of 14. I did find that my crust was a little dry and a little difficult to roll out but it worked out in the end...next time I'll add more butter to the mix. I didn't have any almonds so I used peceans(untoasted) and thought the combination worked well. I thought it was delicious (so did my guest) but definitely need to plan ahead.

I made this dessert for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit. It is impressive looking and really delicious. The first time I follwed the advice of other reviewers and cut the baking time for the crust to 10 minutes. I found it nicer, however, at 12 minutes. At 10 minutes, it was a little too soft and blended too much with the tart. I also used 1.5 cups of cream and 12 oz of chocolate and it was perfect. I also doubled the orange peel (althoug I think 1.5 oranges would be perfect) and added 50% more cinnamon because I love it so much. To decorate, I suggest adding some fresh sprigs of mint as I did and serve a dollop of fresh whipped cream on the side. My mother (a professional food critic) said it was "to die for".

I served this as my mother's birthday cake over the weekend. It was wonderful. My guests could not beleive it did not come from a bakery. I reduced the baking time on the crust to 10 min. and that worked well. I also took the advise of previous reviews regarding extra chocolate filling. I used 12 oz. of chocolate and 1.5 cups of cream for the choloate filling. This covered the almonds and filled the 9 inch tart pan perfectly. The recipe suggests chilling for "at least three hours," however I would suggest chilling for longer and perhaps even over night. My only addition for next time will be doubling the candied orange peel. Outstanding!

This recipe worked like a charm -- I served it at a dessert buffet and it was the hit of the evening. It got rave reviews (actually moans of delight). I followed the advice of others and cut the baking time of the crust (I may have underbaked a bit too much -- but those eating the tart didn't seem to care). I dusted the top with cocoa powder prior to decorating with the orange peel (I had to put some plastic wrap on the tart during storage and that messed up the shininess of the surface -- the cocoa powder looked elegant, covered the minor flaws, and provided a slight bitter foil to the sweetness of the tart.)

To cook from Houston, overbeating can cause the fat to come to the surface when mixing the cream and chocolate. Add the chocolate to the hot cream, then let it sit to melt the chocolate. Stir gently with the whisk until the chocolate is melted--don't beat it.

I was very disappointed with this tart. I worked very hard -it is a long recipe- and the crust was way too hard and the ganache did not mix well, with all the fat coming to the surface. The taste was interesting though. I guess the comments I just read about baking the crust less than 14 minutes must help, but I really don't know if it is worth a second shot given the amount of time needed. I have better recipes which take much less time to do, so I think I'm going to stick with them!

I made the entire menu including this dessert. It stole the show with everyone FULL people had seconds on this wonderful tart. I also agree with previous reviewers on the tart being overcooked 14 minutes is too long when I make this again I think 10 to 11 minutes would be fine. I used semi sweet chocolate chips the candied orange peel plays such a role in this tart you can't skip this part.

This recipe was so amazing. The nuances of the flavors of the almonds and orange peel was so delicious. The mixture of saltiness w/ the sweetness of the chocolate perfect. I found the dough a bit dry but it worked out in the end. I think you should use a really good quality orange that smells good. I think that helped with the flavor alot.

This was fantastic. I served it with two other bakery-bought tarts and all my guests preferred this tart. The orange flavor was more prominent the day after I made and served it. Even though the orange peels were difficult to chop, I would definitely make this again. However, does anyone have a suggestion on how to handle the peels differently? Mine stuck to the plate and were very sticky to handle.

Although I didn't have the problems others have reported with the crust (mine was quite good), I was quite disappointed with the filling - basically bittersweet chocolate. I used very good chocolate, but thought it not sweet enough and also very very heavy. The orange peel, which tasted divine when I made it, didn't seem to translate to the taste buds very much once incorporated. The filling was just too heavy for me, and I love chocolate. This recipe needs work!

The tasted simply wonderful. I checked online first to see if I should make adjustments - which I did - in the cooking time of the crust. My guests loved it! However, it still doesn't seem right that the middle (nut, sugar, cinnamon) is dry and crackly, under the rich chocolate topping. There was plenty of topping to cover the tart. Make sure to use a 9 inch tart pan. The tast is great but overall the result is not what it should be.

My experience with this recipe was not nearly as positive as the other reviewers. The crust was waaaaaayyyy too dry and quite difficult to cut, and the almond and orange filling just fell out of the tart when I sliced it--the whole thing was just too dry. If I were to make it again I would definitely bake the crust for a shorter time, and I think I would mix some of the ganache in with the almond and orange filling to make it all hold together and give it some moisture.

I have made this tart twice and it is very good.The second time I made some changes which improved it.Fourteen minutes was way too long too cook the crust.It was extremely chewy and difficult to cut.Ten minutes produced a better crust.As written, the ganache filling barely covered the nuts and orange peel.I increased the proportion by 50% i.e. 1 1/2 cups cream and 12oz chocolate.The coverage was better and it still fit in the tart pan.It is somewhat time consuming but I would make it again.

Dark, delicious, and decadent, I loved it, my guests loved it and it was so easy. Everything done in advance. I've already shared the recipe with people who have made it and shared the recipe. The only problem I had, was I made the crust dough two days in advance and it got a little dry. I just briefly microwaved it and it worked like a charm.
