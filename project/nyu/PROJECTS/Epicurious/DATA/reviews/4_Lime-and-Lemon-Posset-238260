My 2nd review: OK, I've made this desert more than a dozen times for dinners with friends and family, and have always gotten rave reviews. I've also shared the recipe with so many friends I've lost count. They all love how easy and quick it is to prepare. Thank you Jill Dupleix for sharing this with us.

I have made this wonderful desert twice now. The first time I made it exactly as written, the second time I made it with orange juice. I preferred the lemon and lime rather than the orange as the lemon and lime gave it more flavor. I used a raspberry coulis drizzled on top with a couple of fresh raspberries for decoration. Definitely one of my favorite recipies.

I agree with other reviewers who were skeptical, but pleased with the result! Like many others, I didn't bother with the friands, especially as I wanted a light dessert. Another cook mentioned topping with raspberries and blueberries. I don't really like blueberries, and the store didn't have raspberries, so I got blackberries, which were a really nice topping/accompaniment. Will definitely make it again!

This is a delicious dessert which delivers so much great taste for so little effort. I topped each serving with whipped cream and then candied thin slices of lemon and lime which I added on top of the cream. Heavenly.

This dessert is perfection. It could not be any easier (and still be cooking), and it comes out light, creamy and simply delicious. I followed the directions exactly but was fortunate enough to strike upon Meyer lemons at the store, so I used them instead. So, so good. The zest sprinkled on top looked very pretty against the pale color of the posset. I will definitely make this again.

Made this for a luncheon. Put the grated lime and lemon peels directly into the mixture. Everyone loved it!

This is absolutely delicious! I agree that this isn't enough for 6 servings -- I got 5 out of it. I think next time I make it I will cut back on the sugar b/c I think it would be even better a little less sweet. The only change I made was that I mixed the zest right into the cream.

This is WONDERFUL. I dont usually take the time to rate, but this dessert is amazing. As one reader said, it is magic how it sets up with no eggs. It is rich, but light at the same time. Very unique.

I was looking for something light and refreshing to serve for desert after a hearty prime rib dinner, and found it in this recipe. I was a bit skeptical about it setting up since there were no eggs, but it turned out beautifully. All my guests were raving. I'll definitely add this to my recipe box.

I would give this recipe 10 forks if I could. This was the easiest and probably one of the most delicious desserts I have ever made. If you like lemon and lime flavors, this is very subtle. If you love crème brûlée, this is creamier. I served this with fresh raspberries and blueberries on the side and it was spectacular. My guests were truly impressed and you will be too!

It doesn't matter how big of meal you've just eaten, there is ALWAYS room for this tasty treat. You will be licking the bowl it was served in.

I made this and it was a big hit. Several folks asked for the recipe. It's a wonderful make ahead dish and you don't have to make the friands if you don't have time -- almond crisp cookies from Trader Joe's are a great complement to this super dessert!

Wow! These turned out incredibly smooth and creamy and light! A must try recipe.

Very easy, very fast, and very good. My guests took the recipe with them. Rather than the friands, they are much better with a light wafer type cookie. Have already made it two more times and it is always a hit.

Very easy and very good, Both posset and friands simple and fast. A little tight for six servings on the posset. I did not sprinkle sugar on top of either before serving. Sprinkled lemon and lime zest on possets. Lovely light dessert and nice presentation.

Perfect! Awesome spring dessert. I didn't have enough time for the tea cakes that were paired with this. Central Market here sells plain scones which were a great compliment rather than the tea cakes that were recommended. This was a huge hit and couldn't have been any easier. We had one for breakfast the next morning.
