CORN SYRUP????? Isn't making your own granola supposed to be about eating healthier?

Love this recipe and make every holiday season for gifts. Everyone always asks for the recipe. I omit the molasses and use slivered almonds and walnuts sometimes. I usually omit the raisins too as I'm not partial. Bake on parchment paper! Enjoy! You almost can't eat store bought after this.

Definitely need to cook at lower temp than listed. I found it too sticky the first time I made it and the second time I added extra oats to good effect. I'm not a coconut fan so left that out and instead used a mix of sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds. Love this recipe -- it comes as close to a brand that I love from Australia (Carmen's muesli) as any I've found.

I enjoyed making this with my 4 yr, but we weren't too thrilled about the taste.

a wonderful recipe! I used lyle's golden syrup instead of molasses and maple syrup, added dried cranberries and chopped dates, and tried sunflower seeds, whole raw almonds and walnuts for the nuts - absolutely wonderful! 250 is defintely the correct temp - took abouit 2 hours for it to dry out, but the wait was worth it.

It's a decent recipe that makes good granola (then again I've never really had a homemade granola that I didn't like). I would advise setting the temperature at 250 to avoid burning. Definitely grease your pan.

I made this recipe for Christmas gifts this year, and it turned out great!! Very easy to make ~ I added some extra raisins...yummy!!

I loved all the stuff in this and it was easy to find small amounts at my local Central Market (like Whole Foods). I diligently followed the directions, but burned my first batch using the temp setting they recommended. I turned the oven down for the second batch and had to leave it in much longer (250 degrees). Never got it to dry out quite right. It tasted good, but with the trouble I had with the oven, I would have to have the time to mess with it to try it again.

The best homemade granola I've had. It stayed crunchy in milk, but wasn't so crunchy that your jaw hurt eating it. I wasn't sure about the sesame seeds, but I loved the extra texture they added. I also substituted sliced almonds for macadamias, and will probably do so again because of expense.

I made this granola as a birthday present for my father and now he expects it on a regular basis. This is the best granola I have ever had and very easy to make.

Mmmmmmmmmm. Just finished making this and I have to say it is the best homemade granola I've tasted. Great texture and flavor. I made one substitution - almonds for the macadamia nuts - just because that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make again.

Seeing as how I normally don't care for granola at all, I'd have to rate this a 4. Since it didn't have cinnamon in it I wasn't sure if I'd like it all (since I always equate granola with cinnamon flavoring), but it was so good I found myself eating it instead of dessert and for a midnight treat. The variety of nuts and the texture really makes this great.
