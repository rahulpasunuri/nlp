Super easy to make and delicious! I modified the recipe by adding less garlic, and dash of ground chipotle to add a little heat and smokiness. Also, I found that the original recipe didn't have distinguishable bacon flavor so I wound up frying another slice and adding that (less the fat).

I found the dressing too sweet. I'm not a fat of sweet bacon fatty dishes. I recommend you omit or halve the sugar. Otherwise the recipe is very tasty and easy to prepare.

I used more bacon, and half hot mustard for more "punch". Also, it holds its consistency very well. You don't need much.
