nliedel - Marrow is a vegetable. Bone marrow comes from most animals. It is where our blood gets made. My jar of Branston does not list marrow as an ingredient; it does list Anchovies. So you managed to keep it vegan, but for the wrong reason...

I was looking for Vegetarian Sandwiches and ran across this. After spending a delightful ten minutes reading the ghastly mix of reactions, I decided there was nothing for it, but to make this and give it a go. I used fresh bread I made myself, a good English Cheddar, and substituted piccalilli for the Branston Pickle, since marrow is made from cow. Not a vigilante about it, just a choice. I have some gherkins and tossed some good lettuce on it. Delicious. Not highbrow, but the English are actually doing quite well in the world food thing these days. Many of their better foods are simple and delicious.

I'd never had known about Branston pickle. Found a jar of it at a Cub's discount store. It makes a great before dinner treat with cheeses & crusty bread.

you can make this with whatever is in the fridge, as long as you have a base of pickles, cheese, and any kind of good rough bread. sometimes i like a bit of leftover sausage or ham, or hot mustard in place of the branston pickle; for that almost anything pungent that clears out your sinuses will work, even horseradish. i never actually put this together as a sandwich, i just pile a bit of everything on a plate, then grab a hunk of bread and take a bite of something here and there, or wrap bits of food in a small chunk of bread; its more fun that way

I went to London recently and while I couldn't find Branston Pickle at the few small corner stores I went to, I did find "Ploughman's Pickle" in the Marks & Spencer food dept, which is very good and, I was told, very similar to Branston Pickle. Also, to the previous cook from Vancouver - you mentioned that you go to a local pub just for the Ploughman's Lunch. Being from Vancouver also, I'm curious which pub you're referring to? I wouldn't mind checking it out. Thanks.

Pub fare is great especially with a few good cold brews or maybe a cider. Just because it is not complex does not mean it is not yummy nor does it mean that everyone knows about it. Thank goodnesss there is Epicurious to remind us of the simple pleasures of food and to clue us in to other more complex culinary joys.

One of those 'so simple, but so perfect',Summer-night recipes. I go to a local pub JUST to get this with a pint of good hard cider,(their version is served with Cheddar, Stilton, and a soft white cheese, with a few slices of apple and orange for palate-cleansing sweet). Don't omit the pickled onion, either. Two pickles aren't overkill, they set each other off well--try the Branston with any cold meat, as well as cheese--addictive.

I love this sort of recipe where you just take some good simple ingredients and make a dinner with variety but fast and with little clean up. I don't know about you guys but we have great bakeries and purveyors of artisanal cheeses here in Columbus. Plus if it wasn't for this recipe I never would have been tempted to buy Branston's Pickle!

There's a question that's been on my mind lately: Why doesn't A cook from Newburyport point a critical finger at himself for a change? I mean, Newburyport's beer-guzzling insinuations are to politics what the blitzkrieg was to international diplomacy. First, the misinformation: Newburyport suggests that it's perfectly safe to drink and drive. Where the heck did he come up with that? While I don't know the answer to that particular question, I do know that if you were to tell him that no matter what terms are used, his invectives are wrong for the same reason that drug use, adultery, lust, murder, and lying are wrong, he'd just pull his security blanket a little tighter around himself and refuse to come out and deal with the real world. This has been a long comment, but I feel that its length is in direct proportion to its importance. Why? Because A cook from Newburyport is a very scabrous little man.

Ok, so I found some OK cheddar and some really good and crusty bread and, most importantly, Branston pickle! Why did no one tell me about this amazing stuff before? I agree..it is VERY hard to find good bread and cheese here, but Stop & Shop had the Branston's right in the relish section (3rd try is the charm). It is worth the search! Delish! Can't wait to try other cheeses in this combo. Thanks for all the tips!

Sorry, Sheepwash. Being talked down to about quality food by a Brit is a bit like taking lessons in organization and punctulaity from an Italian; or pointers about humilty from an American. Besides last time I went produce shopping in England, I couldn't find two fresh vegetables to rub together. Obviously my above statements are meant to show how ridiculous it can be to make broad sweeping statements about any place (or culture).

Rating: 1
It is difficult to understand this recipe from a British perspective unless you understand how bad the US supermarkets are in comparison to ours. It's not surprising that you can't get Branston Pickle, but what stunned me on my first visit to the States is that proper cheese and good bread are almost impossible to find in America. Craft suppliers of cheese, or good bakers are unheard of outside the very biggest cities. So a recipe that depends simply on good local produce will never work. I wish I understood why American consumers put up with it...

As a Brit I could add a few ingredients to this list but the staples are good bread and cheese. You will never get the same ploughmans twice as pubs will add or substitute ingredients where needed. A baguette with the cheese is not unusual and quite often there will be a choice between stilton and a strong cheddar. Hey, it's a salad with bread and cheese but missing out on Branston Pickle would be a great shame. We love Branston. There was a fire at the Branston Pickle factory last autumn which led to panic buying in case there was none to eat at Christmas! (With the turkey left overs in case you are wondering). Also, half an apple is a very common ingredient.

I regularly check the "buzz box" for good recipes and every now and then I find a gem like this. I am convinced the webmaster at epicurious.com throw in these types of recipes (remember the boiling water recipe???) for kicks. I am sure they howl at our antics. These guys don't cook and enjoy getting the "foodies" in an uproar. Thanks for the laughs!!

I've probably eaten more than a hundred Ploughman's lunches over the years at various pubs across England. Every one included a chunk of cheddar and some Branston pickle (a marriage of flavors worth trying); nothing else was sacred, it seems. Sometimes white bread, but usually whole wheat; usually, but not always, pickled onion; rarely, a few greens. The oddest addition that I recall was a slice of quiche in a working-class pub in Taunton. One could do worse than to plan a visit to the U.K. going from village to village, trying out a different Ploughman's every day. Thanks, Epicurious, for reviving such pleasant memories!

wow. interesting reactions. i note that the recipe calls for "thick slices of white bread", and everyone seems to have envisioned those soft and squishy supermarket loaves most of us grew up with. but that obviously superior "crusty" stuff that every reviewer thought that everyone else needed to be enlightened about is also, at least more often than not, white bread. why assume gourmet magazine is recommending wonderbread? i for one don't know anything about the true ploughman's lunch, and sorry to say have never met a ploughman, but only one or two of you keenly informed reviewers seemed to suggest an alternative to white bread (someone mentioned a preference for nuts and seeds i recall). same with the cheese. so they sliced it. scandalous. (do you have to bite into a block? or carve a section off with your pocket knife?) anyway, i learned a bit from your collective vast stores of knowledge, but i sure wouldnt want to go on a picnic with the bunch of you. oh, and as for the rating system, did anyone here actually make the dish?

A few comments regarding the "controversy." 1) This is not a poor reflection on Epicurious. This website merely a collection of recipes that have been printed in the Conde Nast publications (Gourmet, Bon Apptite, etc.) There's no one making decisions about content. 2) Most people who have eaten Ploughman's lunch surely must have noticed that they differ from one pub to the next - let alone town to town - so there goes the theory that there is some "codified" version of what essentially is intended to be a "catch-all" kind of meal. 3) did one of the previous posts really use the words "Ploughman's Lunch" and "gourmet" in the same sentence?

I absolutely love a Ploughman's Lunch and got so excited to see it listed as this month's Epicurious feature. After reading the "recipe", though, I'm suprised that they even published it at all. The bread and the cheese are all wrong! Brings my opinion of Epicurious down a notch.

This is fun, I really did learn something from reading this recipe even though I didn't make it--there is actually a name for the lunch that you get when you pull things out of the fridge willy-nilly, and there is a "right" way to make it! Sarcasm aside, thanks for all the reviews, now I want to go try it the "right" way-in a pub with a pint!

Hey there, Cook from Oakdale, CT: the texan wasn't making fun of this recipe. He/she was merely providing us with a resource for good cheese. I don't know about you, but I certainly appreciate that.

I agree with the Canadian writer. We're not making a boring cheese sandwich here. A ploughman's lunch consists of the most delicious fresh crusty bread, a selection of gourmet cheeses, tomatoes, spreads, pickles and fruit. The only thing you got right is the Branston Pickle - time for another research trip to the British Isles!

Rating: 1
This recipe sounds boring. A Ploughman's lunch is anything but. It needs really good old cheddar. The bread has to be dense homemade thickly cut fresh bread. And you need good butter. More pickles - Branston is essential, but pickled onions and gherkins are too. Add some other good cheeses - go to a cheese shop, not the Kraft aisle in the supermarket - try some Double Gloucester and some Wensleydale and some Stilton. It's supposed to be a simple lunch - bread, cheese, pickles, but they all have to be the best. And it should be laid out beautifully on the plate, and savoured. It's not fast food, it's food. It only takes a few minutes to assemble, but it should take at least an hour to enjoy.

Proper Ploughman's lunches are one of life's small pleasures. As many have commented, this recipe is at best a parody of the true species. In addition to the crusty, fresh bread and proper cheese or cheeses (Stilton and Lancashire are my favorites), what about a generous pat of butter? And one of the better Ploughman's I've enjoyed had frisee as that hint of greenery. The very best: a hunk of Lancashire, Lakeland plum bread from Bryson's of Keswick, and a view over Derwentwater!

I can't believe some of the postings on this recipe. I didn't care for the combination, but that's all that it is, personal favorites. Some will like it, some won't. For those who think that every recipe on this sight has to be for people who just can't wait to drop $10,000.00 on some good caviar, just turn the page and find another recipe. If you want Gourmet recipes, go to a gourmet restaurant and tell the chef that his risotto needs more saffron and a dusting of fresh grated nutmeg. You'll surely be a hit. ;)

No, no - this is not a ploughman's - this is "what on earth can I give the kids for lunch, I've no time to go shopping and I've run out of decent bread!" In reality these "open sandwiches" would probably be flashed under a hot grill, and served with the remains of granny's chutney from 2004 to take the taste away.

This has to be the worst recipe that I have seen on Epicurious. Not that it has to be said again, but crusty bread and chunks of cheese please. Though the Ploughman's I was once served in Florida was even worse. A great pile of salad with two fingers of orange "chedder" cheese and defrosted dinner rolls. It should be so simple. At least the Banston's is right, yeah for Branston's pickle.

I love Ploughman's lunches, when eaten in a British pub. But I definitely agree: this is not it. Sliced cheese is a no-no at any time.You have to include at least two types of cheese. The bread should be crusty and dark - I prefer it with nuts and seeds in this case. There is a pickle on the market called Ploughman's pickle, but I forget the brand (not Branston). Gherkins are ok, but they can't be sweet, and do add some yellow pickled onions. This is nothing like the Epicurious recipe anymore, so I answered a firm NO when asked Would you make this dish again?

What a nice surprise to see this recipe on Epicurious. I absolutely love cheese and pickle! For a nice twist, try adding some sliced ham or turkey to the bread as well and make sure to include those pickled onions. We usually have a green apple alongside the other fixin's to add another sweet element to the dish. Pubs across the whole of England sell this as a standard lunch and it is quite tasty. Branston pickle may be more difficult to come by as the factory that makes it burnt down last October. They have started making it again but I would think it should take some time to make it across to the states.

I was so surprised at the ingredients here. I agree with the other comments suggesting at least crusty bread and a chunk of cheese rather than sliced. The "white bread slices" and the "sliced cheddar" is so un-gourmet. The whole recipe reminds me of a very 50's era recipe. It's not the type of recipe I look to the epicurious web site for. Although I guess it would suit a lot of simple palletted types. You don't really need a recipe here. It would make a good little picnic I suppose, it you were to say use some very good aged cheddar, in a chunk, and a variety of white breads, like a nice crusty baguette or some nice soft Cobs baps, and a variety of pickles to suit, I would through in a little salami also and maybe some brie. If you expand the varieties of what's offered here it could suit anybody. I think that's the idea with a ploughmans lunch. I'm actually hungry for one now - bon appetite!

White bread (Wonderbread?). Oh, no! Find a good crusty loaf and no sweet gherkins; nice crunchy large sour pickled onions define a ploughman's, French gherkins in a pinch but no sugar. My personal favourite for cheese is Wensleydale but it's so hard to find without a flavouring agent (apricot, etc.), it's a lovely cheese, why do the makers have to mess around with it?
