Followed the recipe with the exception of substituting apricot-pineapple preserves for peach. Excellent flavor and a nice change from my other favorite rib recipes.

I agree with the cook's from PA and VA about the method of cooking for this cut of meat. Therefore, I chose to make this in the oven but with thick-cut pork loin chops. They were tasty! The sauce was delicious and so easy to make. I bet they would also be great on the grill with the sauce used for the last 5-10 minutes of cooking.

This is my new favorite "BBQ" sauce! The next day, I mixed the sauce with a little mayo, spread it on crackers and topped it with grilled slices of chicken sausage. Tonight I spread it on pizza dough [thin],topped it with slices of pepperoni, buffalo mozzarella and crumbled Gorgonzola cheese. Baked it at 450 degrees for 10 minutes. My point is that this sauce is very versatile and delicious! Thank you.

One of my favorite bbq sauce recipes! Very easy to make. I made double the recipe and have it on hand for other dishes!

After reading the other reviews, I decided to place the spareribs in a baking dish, sprinkle them with salt and pepper, cover them tightly with foil and bake in a 325 degree oven for about 2 hours. I prepared the glaze as directed, adding about 1/2 tsp. of chipolte chile powder. When the ribs were done in the oven, I drained the juice, spooned on some of the glaze, covered them back up and let them set for about 30 minutes. I then put them on a hot grill and basted them with the remaining sauce. They were excellent. I will try this glaze on baby backs, they are our favorites.

Easy and tasty. One of our favorite recipes when we want to be fancy, but don't want to work at it.

I've made this several times and really like it. While I agree that the cleanup can be quite messy, I generously coat the pan with cooking spray. One reader said that the ribs were rubbery, etc. and felt that this wasn't particularly good for ribs. I put a piece of foil over the ribs, place them on a broiler pan and this seems to solve the problem of both rubbery and greasy.

This is a great tip I learned from some Chinese freinds. When cooking ribs in the oven, place them on a rack with some liquid under them. It can be water, juice, wine, etc. Ribs turn out exceptionally moist this way. Just make sure the liquid doesn't burn out before the cooking is finished. Put the glaze on the last 15 minutes. You won't be disappointed.

All I can say is that I TOTALLY AGREE with the previous reviewer. We must have been eating dinner together that night!! The comments are exactly my thoughts. Enough said!!

The good news is the glaze. The combination of flavors is exceptional, with the sharpness of the lemon, the sweetness of the peach preserves, and the bite of the chile powder and hot sauce balancing each other very well indeed. These flavors combined in one of the best barbeque sauces I have ever tasted. Unfortunately, it was largely wasted on ribs that were rubbery, fatty, and uninspired after baking, a technique that appears to be unsuited to this cut. The next time I make this sauce, I will use it on ribs cooked on a slow fire in a closed kettle. If I had to do them in the oven, I would reduce the heat to 325 and cook them for about twice as long, turning occasionally, and only adding the sauce during the last 20 minutes to minimize the mess caused by burning sugar.
