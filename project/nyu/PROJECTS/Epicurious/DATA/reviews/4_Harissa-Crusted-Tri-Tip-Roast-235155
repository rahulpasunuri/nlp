Easy flavorful recipe! I followed the recipe almost to a "t" but reduced the sambal olek to 1 tbsp so my young daughter would eat. Great the next day cut up and quickly stir fried for tacos. I also wanted more of a charred exterior. Next time I will brown first.

not one to substitute freely, i was stuck&with no sambal oelek in the pantry, i took what i was afraid was too big a chance, and used thai red curry paste instead. the gamble paid off--wow, was it delicious. so wonderful, in fact, that i'd like to prepare a few batches to share with friends.

I have no right to rate this as I made so many substitutions, but the caraway seeds, garlic, chilies and olive oil as a base (with turmeric bottled hot tomato sauce and ginger because that was what i had) made a wonderful, crusty coating. I think caraway is the key to the flavor. I browned the meat in the sauce prior to roasting as someone else suggested. 130 degrees gave me rare meat. Resting meat I've found is essential. Plan on using similar sauce on chicken and fish. Husband loved it.

Love this recipe and have used it with lamb roast as well - delicious. Going to make extra sauce and try freezing it for future.

I didn't rate this recipe since i used store bought Harissa with a London Broil. It was nothing special, so it must be the homemade Harissa that makes the different. If i make again I will definitely use the recipe to make the Harissa. Bottom line -- don't use store bought harissa.

Quite good. Made with chicken, and used 1/4 of sambal.

So easy! I decided to make this at the last minute, and my local grocery store was out of sambal oelek and sriracha. So I too used an imported brand of red chili paste with garlic and omitted the garlic in the recipe. The meat was spicy and delicious but I wish a crispier char would have developed. Perhaps if had put in the garlic the recipe called for and pureed them along with the other ingredients, the coating would have firmed up a bit in the oven.

totally easy and delish. want to try on grill this summer.

The sauce is exceptionally flavorful - lots of depth, spice and a bit sweet too. Try it in your meat loaf mix. Keeps it very moist and makes delicious "gyros." My favorite way to use this sauce.

So simple and delicious! I didn't realize I was so low on caraway seeds so unfortunately I didn't get to add the full amount but I certainly will next time since it adds a much needed extra dimension to the flavor. I actually seared the tri tip on my cast iron grill pan before finishing in the oven for 30 minutes. Would definitely do this again, or even cook entirely on the grill so it can develop a nice char. The harissa was delicious but since we love spice so much, we might even kick it up and make it a bit hotter next time. Either way, we'll definitely make 1.5-2x the amount stated in the recipe so we can have extra for dipping. (What we managed to scoop from the bottom of the grill pan was instantly fought over and completely consumed!). We'll definitely be making this more often.

didn't use caraway, didn't matter. Awesome, so easy, made it for my college kid and his buddy, and they loved it. I find tri tip boring, but not made this way.

Easy and tasty. I made two minor changes; toasting the cumin along with the caraway and let wet rub sit on the meat for about 2 hours. 45 minutes were at room temp to take the chill off the beef before going into the oven.

Outrageously great!!! I had extra "harissa," and smeared it on bread for sandwiches with left-over tri-tip. You could use this paste with just about anything. I lived in Tunisia, so I wouldn't call this "harissa" authentic, but damn it's good!

This was excellent as written and pretty as the photo depicts. We served it with a nice Malbec and fresh green salad. The leftovers made wonderful fajitas!

We like spicy food, and love tri tip, but found this to be good, not great. It seemed kind of one dimensional.

This was very good. The sauce was outstanding; it might be good on a steak or some chicken. I am not sure I liked this cut of beef with it, it was a bit chewy. I used a 2.25 lb roast and it took longer to cook, about 50 mins. I'll definitely make this again.

Yikes! Made this with the sambal oelek (not sure why it was in my fridge -- but it was!) And it was way too spicy. We like spice, but this burned! Had to rinse off the roast before we could eat it.

I couldnt find Sambal oelek, and used Sriracha instead. Sriracha was spicy and sweet. The sauce was SOOOOOOO delicious! Tri-tip was cooked to a perfect medium. Juicy and tender. The outer layer was the best part because it got all that delicious spicy/sweet sauce. We ate it was some sauteed mushroom and rice. Delicious! Next time Ill make some extra harissa sauce just for dipping. Really love the flavor of that sauce! Boyfriend ate the leftover tri-tip for the rest of the week. He had it with rice, or made it into tri-tip sandwiches. He loved it. Will definitely make it again!

Lucky me, I happened to have a dried harissa spice mix in my cabinet. I just spread it on the meat along with olive oil, a little extra caraway, garlic, black pepper and a tiny bit of salt. (I'm not a fan of adding salt until the end of cooking anything.) I left it to marinate overnight in a baking dish with lots of chopped onions, shallots and plum tomatoes (in lieu of tomato sauce). Cooked the meat as instructed on a rack in a baking dish. The onions and tomatoes cooked in the olive oil and fat as it dripped from the meat, adding a fantastic caramelized sweetness that complemented the heat of the harissa quite well. While the meat was resting on a platter, I ended up popping the baking dish back in the oven with a little dry vermouth to deglaze the plan and to give the onions and tomatoes a bit of sauce (white wine would work well too). I served it over couscous, which was perfect and soaked up all the flavors.

Really easy and good! Like some of the other cooks, I used Sriracha and it worked well. I added some Ketchup to the harissa and thought the touch of sweetness was a nice addition. The meat was excellent in sandwiches the next day! I'll make this again.

Having never tried harissa before, I really enjoyed this. I made this as written except for using a 1-3/4lb Eye of Round roast since Tri-Tip wasn't available. I only added salt and pepper to the roast itself as I didn't think the harissa needed anything more. I'm looking forward to putting the leftover meat in a sandwich and using the extra harissa on some grilled fish.

I have yet to make this but I have a question. I live in the middle of nowhere in the mountains of the south right now. I have some black caraway in my pantry. Is that what this refers to?

This is soooo good! Wow! I, too, used sriracha since that is what I had on hand. I also used ketchup for the tomato, as, again, that is what I had on hand. This is so unbelievably good - I'll be using this sauce a lot.

I also could not find sambal oelek, so instead used Thai Kitchen brand Roasted Red Chili paste. It worked fine. Got compliments from my daughter, who does not generally like beef.

The first time I made this for company I couldn't find the sambal oelek so I used Lee Kum Kee brand Chili Garlic Sauce and cut back on the number of garlic cloves called for in the receipe. It was delicious! My guests played "rock, paper, scissors" to see who would take home the last two slices. Made it again using the sambal oelek chili paste and it was a little bit hotter but still very good. Will be a favorite in my recipe file.

This was excellent! I will most definitely make it again. I added a teaspoon cayenne to the Harissa mixture and it added an extra kick. Loved it!

This was fantastic. I used Sriracha in place of Sambal Oelek since we already had a big bottle. I used a little less than called for, and it still had heat but it was not overwhelming. We had this for our (fantastic) anniversary dinner with the Quick Moroccan Vegetable Couscous and Honey-Cardamom Custards, both from this site.

Very easy recipe and it tastes good. I have made it a few times and it is always perfectly done with the 35 min cooking time. We often eat the left-overs in pita sandwiches.

i took the harrisa recipe and used it for shrip instead--it really impressed my dinner guests. i marinated the shrimp for a bit, then grilled them. rave reviews for harissa!

Super! Simple! Definate keeper. To get a tri tip back east, just ask the butcher at any Publix or Kroger, or frankly at any full service grocery store. It may take an extra day, but they can get as many tri tips as you need.

To Dileo4 in Ashburn. Yes you can get a lovely Tri-tip at Trader Joes in the fresh meat section and Costco also has it. I like the ones at Trader Joes better than Costco. I live in Alexandria VA.

I don't know if you have Harris Teeter but I've gotten it there before. Although, it was pre-marinated. Try Whole Foods or a farmers market

In answer to where to find Tri Tip steak. It is available at Costco in Pentagon City as well as Trader Joe in Old Town VA. We will try this recipe.

I haven't made this but have a question. I went to school on the central coast of California where you can get tri-tip at any grocery store, but now I live on the east coast where they look at you like you are from Mars when you mention this cut. Any tips (no pun intended)for how I can ask for this cut in the east?
