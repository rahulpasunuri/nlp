The meat filling did not turn out very savory. I'm not sure if it just needed more seasoning than the recipe called for or if the meat was too lean. I used a quality pre-made pie crust which made it a quite and easy party food.

My Mom was from Chicoutimi, Canada and passed away several years ago. I never got her pork pie recipe, so imagine how thrilled I was when I found this on Epicurious. I made it last Christmas and have since modified the recipe only slightly by adding a little more spice and since I use a very lean ground pork, I add about 1/4 cup of water in with the pork for moisture. My son asks me to make this for his birthday. Now, if you haven't tried it, don't knock it ... we always made this as a 9" pie and routinely ate this for breakfast with an over-easy fried egg resting on top of your warm piece of the pie and a sliced tomato on the side. My mouth is watering just writing this down.

I had to add more of the spices than the recipe calls for to bring out the flavor. It was a hit!

This is a yearly Christmas treat.

The recipe for the filling is from Jehane Benoit's Encyclopedia of Canadian Cooking. It is intended for a large 9 inch pie, and not for tiny tarts where the larger proportion of crust to pork would overwhelm the filling's subtle flavour. I just made mini-tourtiere for a potlock buffet, using Tenderflake 2 1/2 inch tart shells (so larger than specified in the recipe above), along with the tomato-cranberry preserves. I increased the spice for the filling, adding cinnamon and cloves. It was delicious and the larger size tart allowed us to better taste the pork filling. A very welcomed contibution to the buffet -- amongst the first to go.

Made this from an earlier version Gourmet printed in an entertaining book. The earlier version called for cloves rather than allspice and didn't have the garlic. Also used cream cheese rather than shortening in the crust. But over all I though it lacked pizzaz/punch/something... Filling, but not very exciting.

With just a few additions, this recipe is wonderful either as an 8" pie or miniature pies. It helps to add nutmeg, cloves, red pepper flakes, and most importantly, raisins. As mini-pies they are a great and quick appetizer.

I have been making Tourtières for several years .. then I found this recipe and thought it would be fun to take to a christmas party .. They were perfect . My orignal recipe calls for mashed potato and slightly more spice so that is was i did .. still the pies were a great hit as was the chutney ...

I really liked this recipe. It was super easy and the chutney was excellent. I made miniature pies and served them as appetizers for my New Year's Day Dinner Party. A great hit!
