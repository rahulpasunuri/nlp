We are making them for Thanksgiving. again this year. My son loved them so much I had to make them for Christmas also Couldn't find my recipe, thank goodness for this website. By the way biscuit dough is sticky, it is not bread.

I'm sure using too much flour is certainly an issue, but, as a previous reviewer stated, the dough was too sticky to be manageable without a good amount of flour. Has anyone tried serving these with a dipping sauce like an aioli or compound butter?

These were a big hit last Thanksgiving and can't wait to have them this year!

Made these for a holiday dinner and they came out perfect. They are light and airy because of the folding process and have just the right amount of cheesy goodness and herbal bite. A top 10!

Me again. I made this again today and it came out even better having remembered the baking soda. I also reserved some cheese for the top - which meant a less wetness inside and an attractive crunchy cheesy top. I took them to a potluck and everyone loved them!

Changes: I grated the butter at fridge temp first and then froze it. Reduced cheese amount, just used chives as my only herb. Accidentally forgot the baking soda. Result: Wonderful and easy! I served them to six people and they all loved it. Very cheesy and chivey. They puffed up nicely and had delightful layers (27 of them!). I had some cold the next day and they were still good.

These poppers were very tasty and surprisingly fun to make. Grated frozen butter was a nice technique that I'll use in other recipes. It was much faster and easier than cutting the butter in to little cubes. I enjoyed the flakiness and taste. I thought they reheated nicely, too. I had a hard time keeping away from the leftovers! I might try the course salt on top next time, like suggested below. I'm passing this recipe on to my mom and sisters.

These were delicious! They are definitely a make again. I served them with chicken Marbella and they were the perfect accompaniment. Although they do take a little work, they are well worth the effort. I made them  all but the cooking  early in the day, refrigerated them, and then baked them just before serving. The no work at the last minute aspect of them makes them even better!.

OMG Yum! I have been making biscuits by hand for years and do pretty well (so I'm told). and I have used the frozen, grated butter technique before for scones. I had not done the folding technique for biscuits before, but the cheese was sooooo well incorporated and they were soooo flaky i may have to do it more often. Mine reheated beautifully - from the toaster oven(just ate the last 3 from T-day) and I'm still saying 'mmmmmm". Can't wait to make them again! I may have changed up the herbs and exchanged some parm for kick.

These were a huge hit at my house this year. Considering I do not have a food processor, the only annoying part was grating the butter, but other than that these were extremely easy and very good! I did however add some more herbs because I didn't think the recipe called for enough so I added some minced garlic, rosemary, and thyme to the mix. Right before baked I brushed some olive oil on top and sprinkled them with course salt and garlic powder. YUM!

These were a hit at Thanksgiving & different from the usual breads/rolls we serve traditionally; we toasted them lightly this morning with breakfast; aren't too difficult to make as I used the food processor with large shredded to grate the butter & mix the dough. YUM.

I really didn't think these were that much work. I put the dry ingredients in my kitchen aid and then grated the butter right in the bowl. I thought the grated frozen butter was a great way to make it blend seamlessly into the flour mixture. Poured the buttermilk right into the bowl as it was mixing and the dough turned out great. The only thing that I thought was a little deceiving was that they are biscuits more than anything (although I should have known from the butter and cheese amounts). I wanted more of a cheesy bread bite than a cheesy biscuit.

Hot out of the oven these were good. After that they were okay and didn't reheat very well. I'm not sure it was worth the effort, but my mom made them...so I didn't actually put forth any effort...

While these taste good, they are WAY too much work. I will never grate frozen butter again - surely the food processor could have been used. And with all due respect to previous reviewer, if I hadn't added quite a bit of flour (yes, I know how to measure), I would have just had a gooey mess on the countertop. Mine also did not rise much, so also didn't look like the picture. We'll see how the half I froze do on Thanksgiving.

These came out much as I would have anticipated. Peter Reinhart is an excellent and reliable source for baking formulas and these do not disappoint. It is worth saying that to those of you have have had trouble with this recipe that it may simply be due to using too much flour. Bread baking is a precise art and even something as seemingly straight forward as measurement by volume is somewhat misleading. This is not the fault of the recipe. Most bakers measure by weight and this is a recipe being published for a non bread baking audience. Generally speaking, it is so remarkably easy to use too much flour when portioning with solely a measuring cup it is shocking. If you find over dryness or stiffness or heaviness to be an issue, it is most likely due to the fact that there was just too much flour used. Spoon your flour into your measuring cup, and if you have a scale try not to exceed 4 oz. per cup. Lastly, do not be afraid of moist sticky dough, because well hydrated dough often produces some of the most pleasing of results. Again returning to the recipe, this is a nice laminated dough with a great texture and pleasing taste. But what else would you expect from a dough loaded with cheese and herbs?

Made these yesterday and they came out really well - they actually looked like the picture. As for how they taste cold, well, they didn't last long enough for me to find out. To the previous reviewer whose poppers did not look like the photo, perhaps you did use too much flour. I used flour sparingly while folding the dough and there was no flour apparent before I placed them into the oven.

Tasty when I pulled from the oven, but dry and boring when they cooled (and reheated). I assumed from the picture that the poppers would have a more buttery texture. I had the same result as the Cook from Arlington Heights - dry, floury tops with little shine. Maybe too much flour at finish, maybe butter didn't distribute well, maybe the cheese wasn't fresh enough. Thoughts anyone?

Just made them. I like that you get 36 out of one batch. Will be great for a party. I just wish they looked a little more like the photo. I may have used a little too much flour when I was folding because they look dry on the top even though they don't taste dry.

Outstanding! Took them to a neighbor's home for an appetizer. They disappeared. Love that they can be frozen ahead of time, defrosted in the time it takes the oven to reach temp. I served them with homemade hot pepper jelly. It was really unnecessary as they were great on their own. A small slice of ham might be nice tucked in the middle to make them a hearty hors d'oeuvre.

These are called 'scones' here... savoury scones. And they're not bad. This recipe looks more complicated than it is. They rise up nicely and look totally yummy. Unless you're doing heavy labour, they're a bit too heavy to have with an afternoon/evening drink, but great to send off with the kids on a picnic or to someone else's house.
