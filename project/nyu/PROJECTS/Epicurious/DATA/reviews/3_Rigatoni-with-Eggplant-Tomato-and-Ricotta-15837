I really liked this recipe, partly because I am a fan of eggplant, and also because it was simple. I didn't have any red wine around (as suggested by other reviews) so I added a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, which added a great flavor. I also mixed some of the ricotta into the sauce, and put parmesan on top. I used fresh cherry tomatoes that I had on hand, which was delicious.

Very bland if nutritious. My wife helped out at the end, rescuing the dish by adding seasonings (Cajun, of all things) as well as mozzarella and parmesan cheese. We microwaved the dish at the end to melt all three cheeses. Or you could add them to the skillet and cover near end of cooking.

Really tasty and creamy, even with low- fat ricotta. I'll definitely make this again.

I had this eggplant I had to use and decided on this recipe. I used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes. As soon as I tasted it, I knew this was a recipe I would make again and again. I definitely would make it for guests as a comfort food/winter dish. I added a dash of red pepper flakes. Loved the ricotta on top. Made it seem like a delicious lighter version of eggplant parmesan without all the work. Yum.

This is a great, quick and healthy alternative to eggplant parm. But I haven't been able to find a 16-oz. can of tomatos anywhere, at least in NYC. I've been using the traditional 14.5 oz can and haven't had a problem.

This is a simple, yet delicious recipe. I make it all the time, with different kinds of pasta. Though, I throw in a few fresh thyme stems along with the eggplants(which are removed at the end) and I add capers with the basil, and pine nuts for decoration, at the end. Yummie and yet homie :-)

This is one of the best pasta dishes I have ever tasted - the kind you would find in a five star restaurant! Loved it and can't wait to have it again.

Really good. My kids were more interested in the rigatoni and the cheese, didn't really care for the eggplant. I used queso fresco crumbled in the dish and I think it was a good choice for the added flavor as compared to ricotta. It was very easy, good and healthy. Next time I think I would add italian sausage to make it more kid friendly.

Really good and relatively easy. It's a nice way to enjoy summer flavors in the middle of winter. And that ricotta on top is delicious.

Aw, gee, I was so disappointed with this. I heeded the advice of other reviewers and added red wine and red pepper flakes, used a LOT more garlic, and even added a green pepper I had on hand and a bit of tomato paste, plus grated parmesan... all to no avail. There are a bunch of other eggplant and pasta recipes on this site and I'll try another one next time.

This was good, selected especially for guests who love eggplant. I read the other reviews and did add about half of the ricotta to the pasta mixed with half the sauce. I used that as a base to put a dollop of sauce topped with the remaining ricotta garnished with a basil leaf. Looked great. Two recommendations: fearing it would be a bit bland, I served it with peccorino and added some hot pepper flakes whie cooking to give it a little kick. Also my eggplant took considerably longer than stated to cook.

This recipe was great! so easy top make, I followed some of the tips from other members, such as adding red wine, and stirring in the ricotta, I also added some sliced black olives.

This is a good base recipe, but I used the advice of other reviewers, and used red wine instead of water. I also sauteed the garlic with the onion instead of stirring it in at the end(I didn't like the sound of raw garlic in the sauce)added 1/4 tsp. of red pepper while sauteeing, and added about 1/2 tsp. of oregano at the end. It ended up being quite yummy!

My husband and I both loved this. We added some red-pepper flakes, oregano and red wine as others suggested. Wonderful, quick supper.

Very bland recipe. The other reviewers gave me great ideas about spicing it up but it still was a major disappointment to me. I try to make new and healthy things for my children using vegetables like eggplant and tomatoes but this recipe just doesn't stand on its own.

This recipe is very similar to one in one of Marcella Hazan's books, and I adopted two simple ideas from her that I think are worth considering. First, the ricotta shouldn't be added in a dollop; it should be mixed into the hot pasta. It adds a wonderful consistency that connects the vegetables to the pasta. Second, she uses freshly grated pecorino romano to add zip to the dish, which is exactly what it needs. There were no leftovers in my house, and indeed, my family fought (politely) over the last morsels.

Glad I had some feta cheese on hand to save this recipe. You can skip the ricotta. Use more garlic and red wine in place of water. Would be pretty boring as it stands in my humble opinion.

The only reason I made this the first time was because a friend gave me a bunch of tomatoes and eggplants and I needed something to do with them. From than on...I make it because it is delish.

This was Fabulous! I really was impressed with myself when I made this sauce. Of course I added 5 cloves of garlic, generous amounts of oregano, basil and a few fennel seeds. I did, however, find that the skin of the eggplant was a little tough (that could have just been my eggplant).

I really enjoyed this recipe. I'm a huge fan of eggplant! I did doctor the recipe a little. I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole, creating a smoother sauce. I increased the garlic to about 3 cloves. I added a little bit of red pepper flakes. I also increased the olive oil and added a bit of red wine (didn't use water). I put a dollop of ricotta on each serving, but my husband and I agreed it didn't need it and really only added calories and fat. I added the 2TBS of fresh basil, but next time I'd increase that as well. Overall, a pretty simple vegetarian dish for a weeknight.

This recipe is good, easy, and filling, but ricotta doesn't really help the flavor any. I've made this twice now and fresh parmesan grated on top (as well as some red pepper flakes to spice it up) makes it much much better.

I added a little mild Italian sausage and still found it too bland. Next time I will add hot sausage instead. Recipe has good bones but needs doctoring to get a richer flavour.

This was easy, quick and really delicious. Could be a company dish when wanting to serve a vegatarian meal and could also add sausage for those who eat meat.

After reading the other reviews of this recipe I decided to add some crushed red pepper and oregano and used 3 cloves of garlic. I also used ground tomatoes rather than whole because I had some in the house. Threw in some left over asparagus too. We really enjoyed this dish and are happily eating the left overs. The ricotta adds a lot. Will definitely make it again.

Not bad, but needs some serious help. First, don't cook the eggplant as long as they say. Second, add more basil. Those two things helped. But next time I plan to add some fennel seeds, and better yet, a little browned Italian sausage. And of course, more garlic...

Very tastey, quick and easy. Couldn't find 16 oz. cans of tomatoes so we ended up using two 14.5 oz. cans, but the extra tomatoes seemed to be needed since we made extra pasta as well.
