Absolutely devine! Remember, people have different tastes--some love mint, some love chocolate, some love cheesecake. Evaluate your tastes first. This was by far the richest cheesecake I've ever made and difficult to finish a single slice. I made it without the sour cream layer and frosted the top with the ganache. Then I sprinkled crushed peppermint candies on top. It was lovely! NEXT TIME, I will make one adjustment: cut down on the chocolate a little bit to make it a little less rich. I am a chocoholic, but with the ganache, there is plenty of chocolate!

This cheesecake is delicious, but I feel the need to note that following this recipe is going to give you a cake with over 400g of fat....if that's what you're going for then by all means go ahead, but I made these changes and the result was still amazing: 1. No sugar in crust (NOT needed) 2. Used 1/3 less fat cream cheese 3. Subbed greek yogurt for whipped cream 4. Cut back the sugar to a little over 1 cup. Also I added a little more peppermint extract per other suggestions, I think it's needed. I am making this again tonight for yet another holiday party, and this time I'll make 3/4 the filling as the original recipe makes a very tall cake.....delicious yes, but no one needs that much cheesecake! :)

Not a bad cheesecake - but it could be better. I've made it a few times and have NEVER gotten it to fit in a 9-inch pan. The cheesecake itself always comes out too "dry" - I'd like for it to be creamier - and it cracks horribly. Maybe I'll try cooking it in a water bath next time. And I agree with others that the sour cream topping should probably be doubled.

This was the best cheesecake I have made from bon appetit or gourmet, and I have made many cheesecakes from them. I suggest making it exactly as the recipe specifies. Definately make the topping and ganache, it adds a lot! I did not have problems with not having enough sour cream topping to cover the top of the cake. Remember, it should be a fairly thin layer, as the chocolate and mint should be the standout flavors.

This recipe is incredible. I wouldn't change a thing. It is absolutely worth the effort.

Well-received by all, although so rich, a few of us could hardly recover!! Dense, very chocolate-y, looked great with all of the layers when sprung from the pan. Will definitely make again, especially given how simple it was. Peppermint extract definitely could be slightly increased in the cake batter. Subbed in 8 oz of mascarpone for some of the cream cheese and will definitely repeat that. Also beat the batter at the end quite a bit, definitely past the just blended point and I do think that additional lightness helped. Excellent suggestion from the CT cook about adding some extract to the toppingthe second time I made this I added extract and crushed peppermint candies to the topping. Be sure to use good quality chocolate and chocolate wafers.

This was very good - yes very rich but shouldn't a cheesecake be? I followed suggestions from others and increased the mint extract, I think I'd leave it alone next time. This would be excellent even without the mint altogether. I doubled the topping, glad I did as I doubt one batch would have been enough. I used Neufchatel cheese instead of the cream cheese, and it was still luscious if you want to drop the fat a little. Rave reviews, will make it again at Christmas I think. . .

While this cheesecake was given rave reviews from my guests, I personally did not like it. I think it was a little over the top on flavor and extreemly rich. I have made quite a few from this web-site and have had wonderful results, but this one did not make the grade. For those who want to try it here are a few suggestions. Double the topping layer to have complete coverage. Also you may want to add green food coloring to the topping to give it a minty appearance. As I said, my guests did enjoy it but I did not. Everyone has their own tastes and preferences. Definately for the chocolate and mint fans:)

Very good cheesecake; a bit denser than the ones I usually make, but a big hit. Based on the reviews here, I cut the amount of chocolate in the cake from 12 oz to 10, which was definitely a good suggestion; I think 8 or 9 oz would be even better. I did the sour cream and the piped chocolate lattice, and it looked very pretty--as usual, I had to cut the first piece because none of my coworkers wanted to ruin the pretty cake. :) I added a tsp of peppermint extract to the sour cream topping, which was a good idea because the cake itself was not very minty at all. Next time I will at least double the amount of peppermint extract inside the cake, because without a bite of the topping, it tastes like chocolate cheesecake. Also, though the crust as written is very good, I don't think the extra chocolate or sugar in the crust is necessary, so I'll probably use only the crumbs and butter. And maybe add some peppermint. Can't have too much peppermint.

This is a good cake, and a definite crowd-pleaser. The cookie crust, cheesecake, and chocolate piping all turned out perfectly, but the sour cream layer was very thin, and didn't look as even and opaque as I'd have expected. Also, the sour cream and chocolate piping both seemed a little like gilding the lily. If I make this cake again, I'll omit both toppings, and simply garnish the cake with a fresh mint sprig. A little drizzle of creme anglaise across the cake slices would provide the same contrast as the sour cream, without being quite as over-the-top rich.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic for a holiday party. Lots of compliments. I was a little concerned because the batter was so thick when mixing but it didn't affect the outcome at all.

I made this for a family gathering and received many compliments - one was even 'the best he ever tasted'. I took the leftovers to work and a co-worker has started telling people my cheesecakes are resurant quality. I couldn't find chocolate wafers so I used Keebler Grasshopper cookies which gave it a little extra mint flavor. The cake was pretty dense, but I don't know if that was because I had to use less chocolate (9 oz) because I ran out of it. It was pretty rich w/ the 9 oz, so I can't imagine w/ 12 oz - definately only needed a thin slice. I will certainly make this again.

Holy Cow this is to die for cheesecake. I did make one change though. After searching for a rich CHOCOLATE cheesecake on this site and others I found most contained Coffee Powder or Espresso. I wanted CHOCOLATE and this fit the bill simply by omitting the Mint Extract. I added some Kaluha (yeah okay a dash of coffee flavor)to the Sour Cream topping and finished as directed.I have not found a recipe on this site yet that has disappointed me or my family. Of course I read all the reviews and take the advice given according to our tastes. Thanks Epicurious for another winner. Oh by the way whats up with the comments re: it being rich. Yeah, duh, thats its job. Everything in moderation. Well most of the time anyway !!!!!

This is the kind of dessert people pay big bucks for in restaraunts. Absolutely awesome! I agree this will serve atleast 15 people if not more. Next time I would double the sour cream part as it bearly covered the top. I didn't pipe the chocolate on top I just melted and drizzled it across the white top. It was beautiful. Making this cheesecake is a snap when you do it the night before. When you make this all your guest will think you are a professional chef.

I love this cheesecake!!! Its so rich you can serve it to 110 people atleast:) I have made this twice and the sour cream step is a pain. I dont think it added too much to the flavor but the white contrast is pretty. I will skip this step next time.

Wonderful! I used a bar of mint chocolate that I had left over after making chocolate mint brownies (recipe elsewhere on this site--another winner). I therefore cut down a bit on the peppermint extract. Like the previous reviewer, I skipped the sour cream topping. Sour cream toppings don't add that much to cheesecake except more calories, IMHO. The cheesecake looked beautiful and tasted marvelous.

Fantastic! I left off the sour cream topping, as it didn't sound too appetizing and just topped the cheesecake with the chocolate ganache. Friends couldn't believe this was homemade. If you are a chocolate mint lover, this dessert is for you.

I brought this for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. It looks great and tastes wonderful. It is really, really rich though so a little goes a long way.

Just like everyone has already said, this cheesecake is incredible!!! I make mine exactly to the recipe and it is delicious. Because it is so rich it can serve probably over 20 people. The lattice on top is beautiful and so easy to do. But you do need to start at least 2 days ahead because there are 2 overnight parts but so worth it!

This cheesecake has become one of my signature desserts! It is now a Christmas tradition. Not only is this sinfully rich, but it comes out incredibly beautiful. I'm not very good with cake decorating tips, but can manage this and the results are beautiful. Just to add a hint of the flavor, I stand Andes Mints up in each of the rosettes instead of mint leaves. Really over the top, but dazzling!

Talk about rich and yummy! This recipe is delicious and perfect for the chocolate lover. I wouldn't change the recipe at all, but I would use fresh sprigs of mint leaves on the top for decoration.

I am so glad to find this recipe again! I made it for a holiday dinner when it first came out and it was beautiful and delicious! I lost the magazine somewhere and have searched many times for the recipe. It must have made some impression to have me still looking for it 11 years later.

Among the best cheesecakes I've ever had. The folks to whom I served it raved about it not only to me but to other people I know and even to their family back home. Thanks to this one recipe, I now have a reputation as the cheesecake guy in my law school. I cannot recommend it too highly.

Made this for a catered "do" - I was doing the cheesecakes. The guests were more than enthusiastic- one slipping back to the dessert table, I'm told, on more than several occasions. I don't know how to decorate- so made the whipped cream/chocolate trim as a glaze. Omitted the mint leaves and substituted peppermint schnapps. Thanks

I followed most of the suggestions of Sophie from TN. I used 8 oz of chocolate and 5 tbsp of creme de menthe in the filling but only 2 tsp of creme de menthe in the topping. Although I'm a huge chocoholic, I find the cake a little too rich, as did my co-workers. Next time I'll only use 4 oz of chocolate and maybe cut out the cocoa altogether. I used the chocolate flavored Vanilla Wafers in the crust and it was good. Unless you are making it for a party, the extra chocolate decorations can be left off. I think this crust, a plain or mascarpone cheesecake filling with creme de menthe added, and mini chocolate chips on top might also be good without being too rich.

This cake was amazing! I ordinarily don't like chocolate cheesecakes, but this was an exception. The mint flavor was a bit strong, so next time I make it I'll add a little less extract.

If you are a chocolate mint lover this cake is for you! I did some things differently though (because I'm lazy ;). For the crust I used Keebler thin mint cookies and ground them up. For the filling I used only 6 oz. of chocolate and instead of peppermint extract I used 5 TB. of creme de menthe. YUM.. I love that stuff. After it cooled an hour or so I poked holes in it with my fork and poured in the whip cream/sugar topping which I had added about 4 TB. of creme de menthe to. I let that sink down into the cheesecake and then stuck it in the freezer. BAM! This cheesecake is AWESOME!!!!

Just like the cook from San Diego 12/99- my sister in law first made this cake when it was first published. She too fell in love with it but lost the recipe. She was thrilled when I found it online for her but she has one question- How much Sour cream is actually used- she thought it was an entire container but the recipe calls for 1/2 cup of whipping cream in the ingredient list and then mentions sour cream in the instructions. Help!! She wants to make this for the Holidays!!!

This cake was beautiful. Well worth the 2 and a half days or so of prep time for a special occasion(a challenge when you have two toddlers at your heels like I do). Successfully substituted chocolate graham crackers for the wafer cookies in the crust but had to add about 2 Tbsp more of melted butter to the crumbs to get the crust to stick properly. Made it for my husband's birthday...he's a chocolate/mint fan...and it was a hit. Although I do agree with the below reviewer that it was a bit too dense and chocolatey even for die hard chocolate lovers like us. Next time I will reduce the amount of chocolate a little in the filling. This is the type of cake where a mere sliver will do rather than an entire slice. RICH.

Although the flovor was good, it was too dense and too much chocolate flavor. I served it at a party and half the guests left quite a bit uneaten, although some really liked it. I would cut down the chocolate by 4oz. for the filling.

This was definitely the best cheesecake I have ever made by far. The filling comes out perfectly smooth and creamy and with just the right amount of mint. I'm in charge of making dessert for every family get together, and also whenever there's a catered party, and this recipe gets absolute raves. Love it, wouldn't change a thing.

I first made this cheesecake when it was printed in Bon Appetit, December 1991. I made this as a desert for the fire station I worked at. Everyone loved it. I then began to make it every year for the Christmas holidays, which was for the next 3 years. I lost the recipe when I moved and was unable to find it until now. I am really glad to have this recipe again, and just in time for the Holidays.

A chocolate lover's dream. I've made this several times for special occasions and it's always a hit. Placing violets in the corners of the lattice design really sets it off.
