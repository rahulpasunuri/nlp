this was excellent, i made the peppermint bark as well from this site and they went well together. my anise chopping was a disaster too, so at the last minute i found liquid anise and used 1 tsp, Perfect!!

Excellent!! It was a big hit this Holiday season. I used almonds instead of cashews. Also I do not own anything to grind anise seed, so ended up trying to chop the seeds with a knife, which resulted in a lack of anise flavor (probably due to my poor technique). Will use a grinder next time :) yet this was still amazing!

Really, really good. No-sweat to make. I used some of a whole star anise ground in spice grinder, pistachios, Lindt dark chocolate (70% cocoa) with dried apricots. Looks, but best of all, tastes like fancy, store-bought confection.

Oh, my gosh. This was incredibly yummy. I substituted dried cranberries and pistachio nuts for that red and green holiday look. It has a very sophisticated taste with minimal effort. The amount of anise was perfect. A keeper. And the perfect hostess gift at the holidays.

This is a lovely, easy recipe with minimal cleanup. If your family has a tradition of doing outdoor things during the holidays (looking at Christmas lights, carolling, sleigh or carriage rides, etc.) this is a wonderful snack to take along, and perfect when accompanied by a thermos of hot cider. I used sweet cherries, because I couldn't find any tart ones, which made it a bit on the rich side - next time I'll try harder to find the tart kind.

Delicious, adaptable, and deceptively easy. The dried fruits/nuts can be varied to your taste and makes an elegant hostess gift. I made two batches, one with anise, one without..both equally good.
