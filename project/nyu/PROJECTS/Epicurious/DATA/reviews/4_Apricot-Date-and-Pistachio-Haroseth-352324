This recipe is BEYOND delicious.I served it along with Ashkenazi traditional charoset. I was looking to a recipe that included California fruits. One person who liked the comfort of the familiar like the apple one. The other five of us preferred this one. The only thing I did differently was that I forgot to buy an orange and had lemons in the house, so I zested a lemon instead. I'm going to adopt this as my regular charoset.

Added some juice from the orange to make it thinner and added some ginger as well. Very yummy!

The combination and proportions of spices absolutely make this recipe. I tried a bit when it was still just fruit, nuts, and sherry and wasn't that impressed. Five minutes later after the spices went in, I was in love. The cinnamon and cardamom really bring out the carmelized sweetness of the dried fruit, the cayenne gives it the perfect unexpected kick, and the sherry adds a sinus-clearing boozy warmth. I added a little kosher salt to help pronounce this great amalgam of flavors. Make it for Pesach, healthy snacking, or the vegan you love.

The texture was very gooey and I was worried, but my boyfriend's father said it was the best he has ever eaten.

i usually do an apple date walnut haroseth but wanted to try something new this year. This was delicious! I substituted sherry wine for sherry cream. I imagine you could even use some manischewitz if you're in a pinch. I made a double batch and turned the leftovers into apricot date pistachio balls-- so easy! Just wet your hands, squeeze the mixture into bite size balls and roll around in toasted coconut flakes. Yum!

I love this charoset. This is the second year I've made it, along with the cornish hen recipe and it's wonderful. My family loves that it has a little spice to it with the cayenne. Oh how I miss Gourmet!

Made this for Passover and it was inedible -- way too much cayenne. I like spicy but this was over the top. We added pears and apples to it, but to no avail.

I used pecans,almonds and pine nuts, omitted cherry and had great success anyway. this is a great stuffing for a Sephardic chicken

Very different charoset! Used for stuffing and also served with dinner. Used Turkish apricots. Will try with chevre as suggested by other reviewers.

Definitely mortar-like, but very tasty, also very sweet. I've been looking for a Charoset recipe to start using as the "Traditional recipe" in my family, as we didn't have one before, and I'm excited by this one. I used sweet Marsala wine instead of the cream Sherry, but it turned out nicely. I brought some as an appetizer to a party to serve with Chevre on Matzos - it was fantastic with the cheese. The Chevre balances out the sweetness of the Charoset.

Stuffed the cornish hens with this last night for Passover. Delicious and easy. Had to use Turkish apricots--couldn't find the California/Pacific. But it was still good. Recipe makes plenty--I stuffed 7 birds and had some left over.

Wonderful Charoses! Great flavor and color. Everyone liked it. I made it as written except I left out the cardamon. Keeps better than apple based charoses. This is my recipe for charoses from now on.
