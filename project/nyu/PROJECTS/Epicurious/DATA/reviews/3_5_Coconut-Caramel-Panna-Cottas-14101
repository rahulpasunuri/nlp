Made this for the second time as part of a dessert buffet for New Year's Eve Progressive Dinner. For an elegant presentation and faster serving for the buffet that has to be set out in a few minutes I pour the panna cotta into small wine glasses (sometimes caramel on the bottom doesn't liquify - so next time will hold crushed caramel and sprinkle on top for a great garnish with texture. Will also cut back on the amount of gelatin for a slightly less firm texture.

I love Panna Cotta, Carmel and Coconut but this recipe is WAY too sweet. I think I will try it again and leave off the Carmel.

If you want a dessert that tastes like you are at a Five Star restaurant, this is it! Even my father - gourmet "foodie" that he is - gave this dessert rave reviews. Try it!!
