So easy, so delicious, so pretty! I, too, added a bit of vanilla, per someone's suggestion, and I would do that again. Made some on Silpat and some on parchment. All great. A mini ice cream scoop made the perfect size.

Easy recipe. I don't typically like macaroons, but these were amazing! I took them to work and everyone loved them.

The perfect cookie to make with kids...especially any budding Jackson Pollock!. We had so much fun putting on the chocolate that we wished we had doubled the recipe! And, these little coconut morsels are delicious to boot. Great tasting and very easy to make!

this was my first time making macaroons and they are a snap. Make sure to try and keep the coconut balls uniform before you bake them, since an errant pieces will scorch. I used a small, 1-oz ice cream scoop.

These are delicious. I have family members who can't have wheat or dairy, and if you use a butter alternative, these fit the bill. But you can't tell and everybody loves them.

This is a wonderful recipe that is sure to please everyone. Super easy and delicious. I like to add a bit of vanilla extract as well- just before adding the eggs, and I omit the chocolate but I'm sure it's good with it too. I also find the cook time to be much less. And make sure to cool them completely before taking them off the sheet, or they will just fall apart. Best the day of or day after so they're still crunchy on the outside. Yum. Great for Passover, too!

These are really terrific. I don't even like coconut all that much, and I loved them. Did cook less time..my oven must run hot because they were done in fifteen. Want to try the Grand Marnier suggestion next time.

Wow. I am awesome (or at least that what people think after tasting these!). My husband thinks I'm great! I must say, in order to appease his purist tastes, I omitted the chocolate and orange--however, the next time I make them I am going to add them back in. All in all, a fantastic basic recipe. Can't wait to try more.

GREAT RECIPE! This will be my third Christmas making these. I give them out as gifts and I was thinking of doing a different cookie this year and somone requested these again! They are SUPER easy. I like them because they are Gluten Free. I add quite a bit more orange zest than the recipes calls for and I ususally add some red and green food coloring to different batches. I also dip them in chocolate, rather than dizzle it. They turn out great everytime.

I have made these several times, with and without the grated peel. They are wonderful. I have avoided macaroons all my life, for the really bad ones I have had. Oh, my every time I take them anywhere...there are only whispers left on the plate.

These are so good andy really pretty simple to make. I took them to a party and was asked for the recipe by several different people. I made them as the recipe was written, with just a smidge extra orange zest. Others have recommended Grand Marnier, but I think that might be a little orange overkill (though I do love the liquor).

These helped win a cookie competition at work. These are a great gluten free option also.

I was so mad when I made these. They came out of the oven gooey, gloppy, and not set up at all. I thought my whole batch was ruined. I bagged them up, threw them in the freezer, and started thinking about how I might salvage the mess. The next day, I took them out of the freezer and...MAGIC! They were great! Moral of the story: don't even think about touching these babies until they are COMPLETELY COOLED after baking. I made the mistake of trying to handle them while warm. Everyone that ate them thought they were great and had no idea they almost went straight to the dumpster.

These are great! I'm not into baking, but I'd thought I'd make these and give them out and Christmas last year.Everyone is asking me for them this year! I'm making them again for sure.

Moist and heavenly, with the hint of orange. I prefer them without the chocolate!

Rating: 4
These are easy and delicious. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added Grand Marnier to the chocolate sauce - - it was a great touch. One warning: They do not keep well in an airtight container. They lose the crispy bottom and become just chewy - - definitely not as good. I'm not sure how else they could be stored, so I'm assuming they don't last more than a day or two.

Easy to make; delicious. I grated two oranges for their peel (did not measure) and that seemed a nice balance to the coconut. Definitely a keeper, but I will make them smaller, so they will be bite-sized.

Simple recipe that is very tasty. I don't know if I did something wrong, but my batch was pretty wet and fell apart easily. Next time I'm going to make them in muffin cups so they're easier to eat. Other than that, I would definitely make them again.

These cookies are easy to make, look spectacular and have great flavor and texture. They also freeze well if you need to make ahead of time. After drizzling I have extra melted chocolate so I peel and section the oranges used for zesting and dip them in chocolate for an extra treat.

After seeing the gorgeous picture of these in BonAppetit, I made these last year for Christmas and this year people have been asking if I'm "making those macaroons again??". (Yes, I am). These are a Christmas staple now for me. I may play with toasting half the coconut this time, but otherwise stick to the recipe. A level tablespoonful per cookie yield around 50 macaroons for me.

I made these as part of my collection of Holiday cookies last year. They keep beautifully in a tin and are extremely easy to make. They taste like homemade Mounds bars but with the added essence of orange. Even my friends and family who said they don't usually like coconut really liked these. They also would go nice with a little port or after dinner drink for a casual holiday party. If I remember correctly, the recipe made more than it even stated.

I hated these. I guess if you are a cocoa-"nut" they might appeal to you, but to me it was equivalent to eating a big spoonful of shredded coconut. They also weren't very attractive because they looked like something you would get in a packaged cookie. Nobody ate them.

Rating: 4
I made these to bring to work and to my parents' for Christmas. They were fantastic and very easy to make. Of all the cookies I made this year, these were eaten the quickest. Next time I'll add a bit more zest as the orange flavor wasn't as pronounced as I had hoped, as another reviewer commented.

Rating: 3
My best friend is gluten intolerant and I wanted to give her something homemade as part of my Christmas gift to her. She went crazy over these. Between she and her husband they were gone in a week. Watch your oven they can easily burn. Next time I'll use more grated orange - I really couldn't taste the orange peel at all.

I made these for a cookie exchange this Christmas and was pleasantly surprised by how easy they were to make and how good they tasted. I also took a batch to my sister's house and the disappeared in 24 hours. I dipped the bottoms on chocolate instead of drizzling the chocolate on top. This recipe is in the Christmas cookie keeper file!

To die for! Added vanilla and almond extracts (1/2 t each) rather than orange...also dipped half the cookie in chocolate rather than drizzling. Great for holiday gifts, try these!

Yield was closer to 70 based on my smaller cookies (each a 1.5" diameter max), and I had 5 batches (baking 1 sheet/time per recipe). Each batch finished cooling on parchment over racks, rather than entirely on sheets. Perfect. I prefer these without chocolate, and I used a mix of orange and some lemon zest. Dangerously delicious!

These are super tasty with or without the chocolate. Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside! I used the zest (chopped) from 5 clementines (no oranges on hand) and they turned out lovely - just more than a hint of orange taste, especially in the ones without chocolate. These were so easy to make, I will definitely be making them again!

This was my first attempt at macaroons and I'm so glad I tried this. They are so tasty. I used the zest from one orange & they had a nice subtle flavor. The chocolate drizzle is a nice touch! Easy enough to make again and again.

These are delicious and easy to make. I thought there would be a stronger taste of orange from the orange peel - but it's negligible. Perfect for people on gluten-free diets. Keep an eye on your oven. They go from not quite done to a little too brown very quickly. My husband - originally from India and a sucker for anything with coconut - loved 'em. Will make again.

Made these today for a cookie exchange and LOVED them. Hubbie, who hates coconut, even gave them four forks. I'm adding these to my "must make" list of yearly Christmas cookies. Only thing different I'd do was maybe dip the bottoms in chocolate like a few of the other reviewers did.

Note: don't use unsweetened coconut for this. Tried it over the weekend and it came out way too dry, even after I tried using coconut milk to rescue it. I dug a bit and found out sweetened coconut flakes include corn syrup and are a lot more moist. Whoops :-)

I made these last week as written. Very easy with a stand mixer but it's certainly not required. I didn't measure the zest. I zested the one orange I had and called it good. The amount of orange was subtle and perfect. I like the idea of dipping the bottom in chocolate for more choco flavor, but drizzling it over the top gives them a very nice look. These macaroons got me a permanent invite to Passover at a friends home.

Just great. I didn't realize I only had 1 orange for the zest so added lime jest as well - so a combo of citris is fine. Also toasted 2/3 of the coconut which added a nice texture and depth of flavor.

These are delicious, and attractive! We also made them smaller, 70+. There were no directions for storage, so we are sharing some now, and freezing the rest without the chocolate, and will add that prior to serving.

These are delicious! We made them a little smaller (made 60+ instead of 45) because we wanted a bite-sized cookie and baked them for 18 minutes. This recipe will be a keeper in our holiday baking file.
