My taster friend and I found the dressing too sweet -- not enough contrast -- so I increased the amount of vinegar. Added watercress because the bitterness went well with the sweet. Tossed the three componenets separately because didn't want everything to look red. Will julienne the apples next time for a more interesting presentation. Also roasted fresh beets like most of the others, but canned would be fast and convenient in a pinch.

I used half the honey in the recipe and still found this way too sweet. Apples and beets are sweet already; they need contrast.

Upped the apple and beet (fresh steamed, not canned) amounts, but kept the dressing amount the same. I let people add blue cheese to taste. Served with a potato torte to add color and tangy contrast. YUM.

This was very good and easy to throw together - even if you roast the beets instead of using canned. I served this over mixed greens and added toasted walnuts - delicious!

I used roasted beets instead of canned, and herbed feta instead of blue cheese, and it came out delicious! also sprinked a bit of chopped walnuts on top.

I don't like beets, nor does my husband, but we both went back for seconds. This was easy to make--I roasted beets earlier in the day (400 degrees for about an hour, wrapped in foil) and then put the salad together a few minutes before dinner. The flavors complemented each other well. We wanted a recipe for beets (for the health benefits) and found this one superbly enjoyable. (My teenager gave it a thumbs down, but you can't win them all I guess.)

This is amazing! You can throw it together in less than 10 minutes and it is beautiful. I keep the ingredients on hand to make at least every couple weeks. I use the fresh steamed beets from Trader Joe's instead of canned.

Very pretty and delicious salad. I made this for a shower and had lots of compliments. Variations - shredded and mixed the beets and apples together, used goat cheese instead of blue cheese, added walnuts, tossed everything with some mixed greens. Drizzled with the dressing. Very tasty and makes a beautiful presentation.

The concept is fabulous. In my final version I give it four forks! Canned beets?!? I just roasted a beet in the oven for 45 min, cooled and used that. This salad is absolutely wonderful. Toasted walnuts are also a nice addition. If you are going for presentation it would work better to keep the beets and apples separate until serving. I'm making it again tonight. Thanks Katie!
