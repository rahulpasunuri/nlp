I also used fresh pumpkin and used Paprika instead of the pepper flakes. My 2 1/2 year old gobbled it up! Delicious and definitely worth the work!

I used fresh pumpkin and half the onion it called for. I would use a little less crushed red pepper, as the teens found it a little too hot, never the less they went back for seconds! THis was so yummy, can't wait to make it again. Friends raved and want the recipe1

I used curry powder instead of allspice and did not add sugar. Added two carrots (sliced thin). Used one can of pumpkin and one can of lite coconut milk. Added salt to taste at the end. Garnished with a dollop of sour cream. I think it was delightful.

This soup is a nice starter for Thanksgiving and/or a festive fall meal. I am not a fan of allspice in large quantities, so 1/8-1/4 tsp is sufficient. 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper gives just the right amount of "zip" or heat to this bisque. I did use one additional clove of garlic (never can have too much garlic). I added one 13.5 oz can of lite coconut milk and using the full can did not thin the bisque too much, nor detract from the flavor. The decrease in the amount of fat and calories here is a savings about 50% for the calorie conscious. I used about 1 Tbsp of sugar to balance out the heat and bring out the flavor of the coconut a bit more. A small amount of ginger really completes this. I did not have fresh today (which I would recommend) so I used about 1/4 tsp of ground. I utilized an immersion blender which made clean up a snap. I think that there are a lot of different types of toppings that can be used here: Toasted pumpkin seeds, freshly grated coconut or just a swirl of coconut milk through the middle of the bisque. I love soup in general and am always looking for interesting flavors for the various seasons. Enjoy!

Took the advise of a few of the reviews and added some kick. My soup turned out so flavorful!! Here are my adjustments: *add 1 more garlic glove *1 tsp minced ginger *only blend 2/3 of the soup for 4 seconds, keeping the other 1/3 with the pumpkin cubes and soup broth *add 1/2 tsp cheyenne pepper, 1/2 tsp crushed pepper, dash chili powder (i did not have allspice) *only used 1/4 cup thick coconut milk, anymore would be too sweet

After reading reviews I added some ginger and then after blending, added some Phad Thai peanut sauce which I buy in powdered bulk form from Cash N Carry, also found some places as Smart and Final or UGI. The guests raved and asked for the recipe. Even my kids asked for more.

I cooked this for my boyfriend as part of a surprise birthday dinner..he loved it! I changed the recipe a bit in that i combined it with a shrimp stock and roasted garlic, a pinch of cinnamon and omitted the nutmeg, allspice. It was phenomenal! So it was actually a Coconut-Pumpkin-Shrimp Bisque.

I roasted a pie pumpkin and followed the advise to increase the sugar and red pepper. Instead of chicken broth, I substituted a vegetable stock, because some of the guests were vegetarians. Roasting the pumpkin isn't a big deal because you have to puree the bisque anyway, so don't worry about the extra time (45 minutes to roast). It was a big hit, with several people asking for the recipe.

I was excited to try this soup since the recipe is easy and it can be made quickly with ingredients I already had in the pantry. However, I was extremely dissapointed in the original recipe; it was bland and the canned pumpkin tasted like tin (I used Libby brand). Yuck. I doctored it up using some recommendations from previous posts. I used 2 onions instead of 1, I added 5 (FIVE!) teaspoons of sugar, 1.5 tsps. of allspice, 1 tsp of cinnamon, a dash of ginger, 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, and a dash of cayenne. (Basically I added all the ingredients for a spicy pumpkin bread recipe) It is still pretty bland and quite disspointing. The recipe seemed promising, but I definitely would't make it the same way again. I suspect it is the canned pumpkin that really kills it. Next time I will roast a pie pumpkin, although that sort of defeats the purpose of a quick and easy midweek recipe.

I used fresh cooking pumpkin, split it in 4 pieces, roasted on a baking sheet faced down until cooked through. This gives you rich, concentrated flavor, not watery bland flavor of canned. I used a lot less coconut - it's nice but too much makes it too sweet and coconutty. Used additional water to thin instead. I also used fresh grated ginger. These changes made the soup taste a lot better.

Doubled the allspice and added 1tsp cinnamon, a dash of cayenne and it was still bland. Topping the soup with sauteed apples and more sugar helped.

I thought this soup was great for a cool fall day. I used cilantro and red curry paste instead of sugar, allspice, and crushed red pepper. And served the soup over rice with crushed cashews and/or peanuts on top. Serve with Octoberfest beer.

Absolutely terrific, and everyone thinks you spent loads more time making it than you have to. It also gets better over time, so don't be afraid to make it a day or two in advance. Nice cold or warm.

I think this recipe is delicious! I add more spices than it actually calls for which gives it a richer spicier flavor. So definitly don't stick with the actual measurements. If you wind up going too strong just add a bit more coconut milk to dilute it.

I've made this dish several times. It's easy and tasty. I brought it to a Thanksgiving dinner last year and it was a huge hit! I like to "draw" a little pumpkin in the center with coconut milk to fancy it up a bit before serving it.

I too wanted to toss this down the sink, until I added some things that the other reviewers had mentioned. I added 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter,a couple of dashes of worcheshire sauce, 1 teaspoon dry mustard, 2 teaspoons chili sauce, I used the whole can of coconut milk and another cup of chicken stock. I garnished the soup with homemade croutons and shredded toasted coconut I'm sure I totally changed the recipe, but now I like it! Joseph Butler For Hire Catering

I have been making this bisque as a soup course for years. Everyone raves about it. I misplaced the recipe one time and used curry powder instead of allspice and cooked it in the oil along with the garlic and cayenne powder that i use instead of flakes. I probably use a little more salt because instead of chicken broth, i tend to use a Minor's brand of chicken reduction and a little water.....

Very bland, very boring soup. Spiced it up after tasting by adding more red pepper flakes, allspice, cinnamon, etc. and results were still mediocre at best. Didn't even bother to save the large amount of leftovers.

outstanding. only one thing i can think to add: why not use canned 100% pure organic pumpkin instead? it saves a lot of time and energy, not that this recipe requires a lot of either.

Wonderful. My husband and daughter asked for seconds! Has a bit of spiciness, but it's not overpowering - the "bite" sneaks up on you.

Easy, delicious, great recipe! Used my immersion blender in the pot, and might try ground cayenne instead of flakes. Might try the peanut butter too. Tried a pretty design drizzling coconut milk on top and pulling through - worked great.

This soup is delicious. I accidentally bought Cream of Coconut - so I added 1/4 c. instead of the coconut milk and it was delicious. The soup was thick and creamy, just the way we like it. I also crumbled some corn bread on top for presentation.

This is one of the best soup recipies I have ever encountered. I did make a few modifications, which made it even better. I added 2 Tbsp of extra chunky peanut butter, which gave it a rich nutty flavor that blended perfectly with the coconut. I also added nutmeg. To help the flavors mesh better, I let it simmer for 45 minutes. I made this for my boyfriend and he LOVED IT. Thanks to this soup, we are getting engaged now.

Really easy to make, a hit with the guests every time. I make it with fresh pumpkin. First time I didn't have any allspice, so decided to replace by clove, nutmeg and cinnamon. The result was great. The pepper gives it a nice little sting. Also, I've used more coconut milk than directed.

Easy and Fabulous! My 3 year old even loved it! I let the pumpkin and chicken broth mixture cook down for 15 minutes and then used two cans of coconut milk (one regular, one light) to get the right consistency.

Yum. Like other reviewers I thined it out a bit with broth, otherwise I think it is too pasty but the flavors are delicious. One reveiwer said it tasted like curry but if you are not a curry lover do not let that keep you from trying it because I dislike curry and did not think this soup tasted like it at all.

This is fantastic. It is better with regular coconut milk, not low fat. I added a little dry white wine (1/3c) and reduced a bit of the red pepper. Also added a dash of dry mustard and ground dill seed. I would serve this to the prime minister.

Like this soup as it is very quick to pull together.(pumpkin in a can) The red pepper flakes a must. I use a few dashes of nutmeg. If too thick a little water or broth is fine too.

I must have done something wrong or made a different recipe from the rest of the reviewers! Mine was 1)too thick -- I finally ran out of coconut milk, 2)too spicy by far, and 3)tasted funny. I have no idea how to fix it. I won't make it again.
