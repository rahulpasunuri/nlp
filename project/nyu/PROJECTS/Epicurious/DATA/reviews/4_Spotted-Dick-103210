For the record, the word "dick" is derived from the German words "dicht" or "dick", which means "thick". It is highly probable that the ubiquitous Xmas fruit cake was derived from Spotted Dick or, possibly, a Germanic fruit cake antecedent. It is only the immature and prurient viewer/listener who titters at such, as I'm sure you just did at the word "titter". ;)

Well. I enjoyed it. I am Scottish and all the Brits have such a great warped sense of humour, so I think the name is quite amusing. Boy ... I'll bet that 'A Cook from Seattle, WA' is one exciting romp in the hay with that attitude, but they did take me back to the 4th grade when we all giggled calling 'it' s-e-double-hockey-sticks.

This is easy and delicious. I added a pinch of cinnamon and baked it. Oh was it delightful.

Pretty good recipe. My mum's was similar, and of course we eat it traditionally with custard. The spelling is Bird's custard, which is still available at supermarkets if you don't want to make your own custard. The name Spotted Dick comes from the popular name of Dick for dogs; way back in the 18th century. A lot of dogs were historically called Dick (like Spot or Rover) and the currants and raisins in the pud remind one of the coat of a mongrel. An alternate name for this pudding is in fact, Spotted Dog; there is nothing untoward about it. My family is English and I grew up on this pudding. You can add a half teaspoon of mixed spice to it; should you find it too plain. I still love it; although no one makes one like my mum did!

Delicious!I took a chance and replaced the suet with butter and all was fine. My English husband said it tasted authentic.I doubled the dough recipe and also made a Jam Roly Poly. Served with Byrds custard and he was in heaven. Change the name? Of course not! Spotted Dick is a classic English dessert.Hubby says "don't be bloody stupid!"..lol

I am offended by the implication that dick is a naughty word. I myself have been called dick my entire life. I think spotted dick is an immensely appetizing name.

If I remember rightly my mom used to make this recipe by rolling the dough up in cheese cloth and tying the two ends like a sausage and boiled. It is delicious. Who would want to change such a traditional name?

I took a different tack from the earlier reviewers. I made the recipe. I made it for some friends who knew it only as the favorite desert of Captain Aubrey. I expected a heavy, soggy pudding but got a very light cake like result. It was very well recieved. I had a second helping myself. Easy to make, and satisfying. The rendered suet was crystal clear when hot and made a very smooth texture in the pudding. I added the chitlings to a meatloaf. I used a lobster steamer because I had one. I would recommend it as something a bit different as well as delicious. Also, I recommend the books.

spotted dick is the traditional name of this traditional english dessert. i don't think gourmet is in any sort of a place to go about changing its name as it likes... think of the name as amusing party trivia. when your guests are asking whats for dessert, tell them, "spotted dick" and see their reactions. ;-)

How funny to read that the previous reviewer wants a name change for this pudding. I just heard a story on NPR that the Pudding Club in England is upset because one supermarket chain in there is changing the name to Spotted Richard!
