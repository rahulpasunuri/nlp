I must have done something wrong. Although they tasted pretty good they looked awful. Most of the popovers fell in the middle, other tilted to one side and some did both. I just couldn't serve them to my guests .. it's a good thing they were old friends who were used to being guinea pigs for my cooking experiments.

The popovers were delicious. Fall is a wonderful time to serve these. Generously coat muffin tins with non-stick spray, no butter needed. Popovers need something to cling too, try dusting the muffin tins with ground pecans. Place the muffin tins in the oven only 5 minutes. (10 minutes and you will have a lot of smoke) Before brushing the tops with butter make sure the popovers are crisp.
