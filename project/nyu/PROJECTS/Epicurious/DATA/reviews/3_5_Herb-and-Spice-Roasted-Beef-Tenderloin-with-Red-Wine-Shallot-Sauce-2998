This recipe (& the helpful comments below) made my 1st attempt at beef tenderloin a success. The flavors are intense but I thought amazing & well balanced. I can't imagine preparing it another way.

This is a crowd pleaser for certain. The herb rub of the meat is exceptional and something I'll repurpose elsewhere. Getting it on early is the key to its success. Yum. The sauce didn't resonate with me but my guests devoured it with rave reviews. As a whole, I'd do this again for those special occassions. The rub I'll make more often.

I used 50% less sodium broth. I added a little salt to tast. I used less rosemary and thyme, based on reviews. I used the same wine we drank with dinner, a pinot noir. I made the sauce a day ahead, it took 1 hour and 10 minutes to reduce. I bought my beef tenderloin at Costco, and yes, it was expensive, but worth it. I served this with goat cheese scalloped potatoes, onion bisque and mixed green salad with dried cranberries, pecans and oranges, all on this site. Poached pears for dessert. I served 6 people and my roast weighed 2.75 lbs before cooking. There was 1 slice leftover. Everyone raved about this recipe. I was very proud.

Overall, a B. The sauce ended up tasting off, so I cooked it more for over 2 hours and added more wine and stock to get the shallots totally soft and have that "melt in your mouth" texture. The spices on the meat were a bit much for a beef tenderloin- it is such an amazing cut that it doesn't need more than salt and pepper added to it.

Rating: 3
Nice dish. I found that the spice rub really added to the meat. I was less enthusiastic about the sauce. Maybe I did something wrong, but it tasted a little off, especially while I was reducing it. I kept adding things to make it better. At the end it tasted better, and then I put in twice the butter stated... then it was pretty good. Overall I'd do the rub again but not the sauce.

Made this for Christmas dinner and I was very nervous about not cooking this expensive piece of meat properly, but it was wonderful. I did not use this sauce recipe, but one very similar with a few less ingredients. I followed the tenderloin recipe exactly except used a blender as I do not own a food processor. It took a little more effort to grind the spices, but turned out wonderful, not too overpowering as to lose the flavor of the tenderloin. I used a whole tenderloin and cut the tenderloin in 3 peices 1)thick end 2) middle 3)smaller end and placed all on a rimmed cookie sheet to cook. It allowed me to have rare(thick end) and well done pieces (small end) all cook at the same time. It fed 8 adults with leftovers for at least two or three!

Exceptional dish. Superb choice for a holiday meal, I look forward to serving this again for a dinner party. The sauce is layered and sophisticated and it takes a good 40 minutes to fully reduce. Tenderloin is not inexpensive, but the outcome is well worth the cost for a special occasion.

This was fabulous! We had a 12-person dinner party on New Years Eve, and this was a hit! I had a 5.5 lb tenderloin, and we had about 6 thick slices left over...which made a great sandwich on New Years Day. The sauce actually took about an hour to reduce fully, so plan more than the 20 min the recipe states.

Rating: 4
We made this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit! I'll definitely put this recipe in my permanent file. If I had any minor change at all, it would be to just watch the salt level overall of both the marinade and the sauce. The fresh rosemary also was slightly strong, so I might try this again with dried rosemary instead. Delicious though.

Delicious. I agree that the sauce took longer to reduce. Great that it can be made ahead. It's a wonderful Christmas dinner. I served it with my own scalloped potatoes and carrots. Add a good red wine and it's an amazing presentation.

I used this recipe for a prime rib roast and it is superb. Have been making for 5 years. Make sure to blend the marinade for the beef until very very smooth. Also the sauce takes a lot longer than 20 minutes to reduce and if not done properly will be bitter and lack depth...This is a keeper!!!

The BEST tenderloin EVER! Made 8 lbs for ten people and there was absolutely nothing left over...didn't change a thing. Prepared meat and sauce the day before and then just tossed it in the oven xmas day...it was a huge hit! Save for a special occasion, as tenderloin ran me $100!! Pass on the accompanying escalloped potatoes & goat cheese though, just do garlic mashed instead....

I also made this recipe for Christmas when it first appeared in Bon Appetit and have made it ever since. I dont know what went wrong in New Jersey, but everyone loves the sauce and the rub. I make this with the goat cheese scalloped potatoes and people rave every year. I am always sure to use the wine will be drinking at dinner for the sauce.

Very Disappointing This recipe attracted me because I had made a tenderloin years ago marinated in orange peel, herbs and peper which I loved--but lost the recipe. Flavor was much blander than expected and overwhelmed by shallot sauce. We bought a larger than necessary piece of beef anticipating leftovers--that no one wanted.

The meat was delicious with the herb rub, although I had to cook it longer than directed, even for rare. The sauce was just so-so, nothing great or worth making again.

This is an amazing preparation for beef. I have never thought the flavors to be overpowering but to be fair, I have used it for years with a standing rib of beef instead of with the tenderloin as called for. Perhaps the rib stands up to the spices better instead of the mild tenderloin. It has been our Christmas dinner for a number of years as well as for special dinner parties. I usually double the sauce recipe as people really love it.

I made this recipe as directed except that I used 1 TBLS orange zest instead of orange rind for the rub and it marinated for only 1.5 hours- not the 6 hours called for. I thought the meat was too heavily spiced- and I am a fan of big flavors. The orange flavor was too pronounced (perhaps due to my using zest instead of rind.) Also, the clove and nutmeg flavor not subtle enough. The spice and orange flavor overpowered the meat. They did work, however, in the sauce- as guests could use as much or little as they cared for. I felt it such a shame that I purchased such an expensive cut of meat only to have its flavors masked. If I were to make this again, I believe I would omit those ingredients from the rub.

My mother and I prepared this for my 40th birthday dinner party. We also made the accompanying potato dish. We took full advantage of cooking ahead everything that we could so we wouldn't be stuck in the kitchen when the guests arrived. All we had to do was roast the meat and dinner would be ready...with the exception of one hitch...the power went out. Fortunately, the oven was still hot from cooking the potatoes, so we put the caserole dish back in the oven to stay hot and put our heads together to figure out what to do about the roast. I sharpened my best knife, pulled the roasts from the fridge and cut one steak from the roasts for every guest. Fire up the grill, Martha! I stood in gale-force winds and driving rain on my back deck and grilled those babies and man, oh, man were they good! The sauce (which we made a day ahead) went into the oven with the potatoes and was hot enough to wisk butter into right before we served dinner. A big salad, some candlelight, a good bottle of wine and I'll tell you, I don't think we could have planned a better party...the food was awesome and the ambiance made it the best birthday ever! Every guest had a completely clean plate! What did we do with the rest of the meat? Back in the fridge - power came back on early the next day and we roasted it per recipe directions for dinner the next night - it was AMAZING! If I could afford it, I'd make this once a month!

I have made this dish numerous times and it is always delicious and always a hit. I think the sauce makes the dish, so for those who don't like strong herbs could skip the rub. If you don't like rosemary, or rich, bold flavor, don't make this. The sauce does not come together until the end, when it has been properly reduced and the butter is added. Those who hate the taste could be using bad wine, not reducing it enough, or putting too many ground cloves in the sauce. And the butter at the end in the sauce adds a diving richness that elevates the dish, so don't skimp! Complex, sophisticated and wonderful!

came out amazing! worth the effort. i suggest to let the sauce reduce alot longer than 20min, it turns it into a velvety red wine glaze. I usually make a big batch of the sauce and freez it to use when making steak.

I just made this using venison in place of the beef and it turned out wonderful. I did not strain the sauce and I used 1 can of regular and 1 can of low sodium broth. I did not like the sauce at first but after the flavors melded it was great! One of my guests who had never eaten venison before said that up to that point his most memorable meal was at Pucks in Orlando. Now is it at my house!

I have to put my two cents on this one. I made both the sauce and marinated the beef the night before. When i first tasted the sauce, I thought it was AWFUL. Just disgusting. I was in dispair. The next afternoon I took it out again to see what I could do to save it. All I did was add some extra red wine and boiled it off before adding the butter and pan drippings, and I have to say it got rave reviews (although I'm still not the biggeset fan of it myself - as others have said it is not worth the work when the meat marinated and served au jus is incredible alone). If you make this, I think you MUST make it the night before. It makes a HUGE difference!! And the meat was wonderful.

Served 12 people this dish to raves on Christmas with Martha Stewart's Potatoes Provencal. Lovely combination. Made the sauce and marinated the beef the day before. Used all organic ingrediants plus grass fed beef. Superb dish. Used inexpensive $4.00 Lola's cabernet for the sauce - nice and hearty! Did not strain - loved the textures, and the shallots were wonderful.

I was so scared to make this recipe after some of the horrendous reviews. It was INCREDIBLE! I was suffering from misgivings the day of the dinner party, after I had already rubbed the tenderloin and prepared the sauce that I read all 253 reviews (by then, of course, I was committed). I used a chianti ($8.50) for the sauce and followed the rub and gravy exactly except I pureed the sauce in a blender just prior to reheating it to get a smoother, more attractive version. The tenderloin was rubbed and the sauce prepared 24 hours in advance. I had a 4.5 Lb tenderloin, which I cut in half, from Fresh Direct and only 5 meat eaters at the dinner. The vegetarian had two pieces of the beef (hence 6) and we ate almost the whole thing between us (many had thirds)! The meat was extremely tender and the flavor was very complex - not in the least bit too fruity or overpowered by the cloves and nutmeg.

Just tried the recipe, but used tenderloin steaks and marinated them for 30 minutes. did grill them on a cast-iron pan in the bbq. came out great. Need to more careful about 'pinch' of cloves in the sauce - anything over that amount is overpowering. do agree that the presentation is pretty messy - there is just too much sauce, but it's so good!!

Rating: 4
I have made this dish many times and always get rave reviews. It is time consuming, as many have noted. I usually prepare the rub the night before and let it marinade overnight. Also, rather than strain the sauce, I smooth it out with a hand held blender. (I think the sauce is too unattractive to serve as called for in the recipe, after all the time and money invested in the roast.)

Has anyone ever grilled their tenderloin with the spices instead of roasting? I'm thinking about doing it and wondered if anyone had comments. I have made this recipe before without the sauce and the tenderloin came out wonderfully.

The tenderloin was excellent, but the sauce was not very good. It had a sort of salty, sort of "off" taste, which was odd since I used virtually no salt. It may have been the canned beef broth. I used a good Rhone wine and decent brandy, so that probably wasn't the problem. I'd make the tenderloin again, but I'll look for a different sauce for it.

I want to eat at the house of the cook from Dumont NJ!! But seriously, this was an excellent dish. The tenderloin was a little too pricey for me, so I used a roast sirloin...on sale. It came out so tender and was roasted to perfection! Flavors blended wonderfully. Served with the scalloped potatoes and goat cheese - a must!

Rating: 4
Delicious, tender and very satisfying, without feeling heavy like other beef roasts. The recipe makes too much sauce; I cut the amount of broth nearly in half, and still had sauce left when there was no more meat. I used a single 4.5-pound tenderloin, tied by the butcher, and it was just fine. Also, the sauce obviously should be strained; this step seems to have been omitted from the recipe.

Rating: 3
I have made this dish twice and both times it came out delicious. For the cooks who did not care for the dish, perhaps they used dried herbs rather than fresh or perhaps the quality of the wine and broth that they used was not the best. For such an expensive cut of meat quality ingredients make all the difference! First time served it with the gratin of yukon gold potatoes, bacon and arugula which was out of this world. This past Christmas I served it with puree of parnips with roasted garlic, and haricots verts with glazed chestnuts (both on this site). Started with oysters Rockefeller, then onion and fennel bisque. Ended with eggnog creme brulee. Everything was sublime!

I made this for New Year's Eve and it was wonderful and easy- and I am very picky. It was "restaurant good" and my friends just loved it. Next time I may strain the sauce, also I thought it a little salty. After putting the sauce and the rub together the day before, it was a breeze to prepare. My new favorite way to serve beef tenderloin.

Made this recipe for the 5th Christmas in a row and again overwhelming success! My only alteration was to omit the sauce and replace with a gravy using Zinfandel Beef Stock from Dec 2003 issue, just to try something new. The rub was excellent as always and the beef fork-tender. Served with Scalloped Potatoes with Goat Cheese, Balsamic glazed carrots and green beans. Absolutely worth the extra effort!

What a winner!!! Having never roasted anything successfully before in my life, I was a bit skeptical about this--especially with such a hefty price tag for the beef alone. It takes a full morning to make the marinade and sauce, but worth all the effort. Make it the day before you cook. I ordered two large tenderloin ends and had the butcher tie them together with string, fat to skinny end on both sides, string was tied every 2", and so I ended up with a thick roast. I increased the cooking time by 20 minutes and said my prayers. My husband carved the meat and I couldn't believe my eyes when he brought the plate to the buffet. Our mouths began to water. Simply divine. The most sensational meal I've ever made in my life. My family would agree.

I wanted a simple recipe, as I was so tired of al bustle of end of year. It is easy, and the marinate gave a special flavor to the fillet. My family including our teenagers, and college kid loved, and had seconds. I served with Gratin Dauphinois, but hope next time I do make the provencal potato recipe. I used onion instead of the shallots, and chicken stock instead of beef, and still came out really well. I strained the sauce, so no bits were left, my kids have something against any unknown objects in their meal. I roasted in my Creuset oval pan, inside the oven, it always works, for the extra tender meat. I browned before on the stove. This recipe will certainly become a tradition, in my recipe book. I would think the marinade will be good on a leg of lamb. I will let everyone know, as I will be roasting it in January.

This dish makes a wonderful impression on guests. It has become a Christmas tradition in our home, and the aroma generated by the simmering sauce and roasting meat has everyone rushing to the table when dinner is served. The price of tenderloins can make it rather expensive for large groups. On several occasions I used prime rib roast and served the sauce on the side. Standing ovation!

This is an AMAZING receipe, it's worth 100 forks!! Make the sauce and marinade night before, saves so much time and the flavors are worth it. I have never added cream to the sauce, but I might this year. This has been on our Christmas table since it was published in 1996. It is truly spectacular. Don't forget the Goat Cheese Scalloped Potatoes!Wonderful side dish that compliements so well. Yum Yum...enjoy!!!!

Wonderful recipe! The person who gave it 2 forks must not like the sauce- try leaving out the brandy and add more sugar to the sauce or add beef broth instead. Easy to make if you do the sauce and marinating the day before. Makes a special dinner accompanied with a favorite wine and twice baked potatoes. Save the sauce for the potatoes too!. I would give this dish more than 4 forks if I could.

I have been making this dish since it first appeared in december 1996. It always makes rave reviews. As one review says the sauce has many steps but it is well worth it and better if made the day before and given time to mature so to speak. I have made this for 4 people and for 50. Very simple easy to follow steps. It is the recipe I use when I don't have to think and can rely on a great true and tried recipe.

Beware though, when cutting the recipe in half, be sure to cut down the cook time. I cut a 2.4lb roast in half and it turned out well done in less than an hour! Even so, it was still very tender and tasty. I can only imagine how good it would have been if I served it medium!

Excellent, made for a dinner party of 8 last weekend and served with sauteed vegatables and couscous. Substituted sherry for brandy and it worked out well. No problem if the tenderloin is of varying thickness as works out better for varied tastes. The amount of herbs on the crust can kind of gag you, so can be cut down to taste, or maybe wiped off a little after marination, but before cooking.

I made this entree for a birthday dinner for my mother yesterday. It was fantastic. One of the best beef entrees I've ever made. It served 8 adults and two kids, with leftovers and my family loves to eat! The sauce is really delicious and the herb rub for the meat also gives the beef great flavor. One note, I made it ahead of time and put it in the fridge overnight, next day I put it in the oven for an hour before baking and it took about an hour and a half to reach 140 degrees, which was medium rare. I think you want to eat this dish as rare as your guests will enjoy because the longer it cooks the less flavor and tougher the meat will become. I will defnitely make this again, its easy, impressive and extremely delicious.

I just made this recipe for myself and my husband a couple of nights ago (cut the recipe in half)and it was absolutely delicious and will definitely make it again!! I agree with the other reviewer to make the sauce the night before (saves time too!) for the flavors to blend together. I skipped the brandy and orange zest because I didn't have any and was lazy to go out and get it, but didn't notice anything different. This recipe is definitely worth purchasing a beef tenderloin though (an expensive splurge, but worth every penny....the beef tenderloin cut is very very tender). Make sure to use fresh herbs and marinate the meat overnight. Definitely a keeper! The sauce is scrumptious!

This dish is excellent. Definately make the sauce the night before so the flavors can mix and mellow. Put the spices on the beef approx. 30 mins before you cook it.

I use this site not only for the recipes but also for the reviews - although the reviews on this recipe were mixed, I perservered because I liked the combination of ingredients. Fabulous! I think the trick is to go light (use less than called for in the recipe)on the stronger flavors - orange zest, cloves and nutmeg. I can see where too much of any of those flavors can be disaster - but done just right, it is magnificent. I also wiped some of the marinade off and then browned the meat before putting it in the oven (prior reviewer hint). Result was a memorable New Years Eve meal!

I decided to make this recipe for Christmas dinner because the combination of spices and ingredients intrigued me. I was not disappointed. It did take some time to prepare the sauce, but it was well worth it!! The meat was very tasty, and the sauce tasted even better the next day. I did make one change in the recipe. I did not have brandy in the house, so I used Cointreau. Because this is an orange flavored liqueur, and I didn't want the orange flavor to be overpowering, I omitted the grated orange peel. My entire family enjoyed the meat, and I received many compliments. I would definitely make it again for another special occasion!

I am reviewing this recipe again after having made it for a New Years Eve dinner party several years ago, just after this recipe was published in Bon Appetit. It was a smashing success. I followed the recipe quite closely, and served the meat rare, with the sauce and with the scalloped potato recipe. My guests were very complimentary. I thought it was really fabulous. I was surprised to see that there were negative reviews of this recipe over the past few years. I will try it again and hope that I will duplicate my original, fabulous results!

Absolutely fabulous. A wonderful substitute for the common turkey this Thanksgiving; as there were only my husband and myself to feed, I reduced the recipe by half, and,like most others, reduced the shallots by half again. . . and cooked the roast to a healthier medium, 160 degrees. The port and broth took a great deal of time to reduce, actually, but the result, once passed through a fat skimming cup, was definitely worth it. Also felt that half the butter was sufficient. The tenderloin didn't yield a lot of drippings, so the gravy stood on the flavors of the port, the broth, and the shallots, and my oh MY was it good. Definitely a repeat for next year.

As Horace said, there's no accounting for taste! It does seem that one either loves this dish or hates it. I have made it several times, according to recipe but also marinating the meat overnight. While I would say that you have to be prepared for the flavors to linger, I loved it and what's more, virtually everyone who ate it raved and raved about it. A word to the wise: you MUST like rare (or med-rare) beef to have this at its flavor-peak. Also, it MUST be served with the goat cheese scalloped potatoes-- the flavors blend together just right. I loved the sauce, but used maybe just a few less shallots-- and did serve the sauce on the side.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I absolutely HATED the sauce. The combination of red wine, cloves and orange peel turned me off. It was overpowering. The roast was OK, nothing impressive. The best thing about the dish were the scalloped potatoes with goat cheese.

The dish is beautiful and unusual, but not pleasant to the palate. I too made this last Christmas and thought it a flop. Quite surprised to see the great reviews. The flavors do not blend well at all with the meat.

I made this for Christmas dinner three years ago and now I'm not allowed to serve anything else for Christmas. Nice because most of the work is a day ahead. I've even done in on the grill. Don't scrimp on the cut. Cheaper meats don't work as well.

My fiance and I made this for a dinner party, and it was a smash. The sauce was fantastically flavorul. My mouth waters when I think about it. Highly recommended!

Okay, okay, I should have taken the advice of the negative reviews! So I didn't, and made this as is, although I despise cloves and don't understand the orange in the rub, made it anyway, oh boy you know where this is going. I DID listen to the advice of making this in advance of a dinner party, thank God, this saved me a big disaster. Someone said you will either love this or hate this, I hated it, you make it and you decide. (and do the test run prior to a dinner party).

It is a costly dish and the reviews are worth a read before you choose this recipe, despite what others recommend. My husband and I did not care for this and the flavors are NOT complex as others suggest, just, well, fruity! Obviously it has it's fans, and probably just as many of us who wouldn't make this recipe again.

Excellent recipe. All of the spices where very tasty, the best beef tenderloin recipe I have come across within the last 3yrs. I cook a tenderloin for my company dinner every Christmas and am always looking for new recipes. Easy to prepare.

I'm not sure why this dish has received any negative reviews. The blending of the complex, yet comforting and familiar flavors, was wonderful. All my guests raved about it. The sauce highlights the beef rub well. A great, hearty dish for a long winter's evening.

I have made the meat over and over since it came out in 1998. Even my teens love it. The blend of spices and citrus is excellent. The person who though the meat was tough did not buy tenderloin; it is almost impossible to get a tough one, unless you cook it to death! Will definitely keep on making this along with the sauce. The potatoes are ok.

For my first-ever grown-up dinner party I made this and got rave reviews from all eight people in attendance. The first time I made it it took much longer than I anticipated, but the second time I got the hang of it. An easy recipe for a first-timer to follow that will impress your guest!

We have made this dish on several occasions for different groups of people. It has been a hit every time. We particularly enjoyed the spice combination. We are shocked at the number of negative reviews... Maybe a lighter hand with the herbs and spices would solve the problem. Don't be scared off by all the negative reviews. This is worth the trouble and the cost. Make sure to make the potatoes as well.

Rating: 1
this recipe was an awful lot of work. I marinated the meat more than 6 hours so it would be more tender. I left some of the spices and fruits out--it started to sound like we were making mulled wine here! the scalloped potato recommendation was yucky, too much fat! Also could not find the wine they recommend in my liquor store.

In retrospect, what a strange combination of ingredients. It is no wonder now that this was not the meal I had hoped it to be. I should have stuck to my old standby tenderloin recipe instead of trying something new for the holiday. Very unusual flavors. My guests were polite but did not ask for seconds on the meat (but did like the potatoes-good choice).

Rating: 4
A stunning meal! Everyone loved this one. I also served the scalloped potatoes and those were quite good with the meat.

Rating: 4
This is the best holiday roast I have ever made - I have been making it the last three years for Christmas and find the herbs and citrus to be an unusual and delightful combination. The roast and sauce provide multiple layers of flavor that are especially nice for a holiday treat. A definate repeat!!

I have made this tenderloin with the scalloped potatoes with goat cheese and herbes de provence three years in a row and it is always a huge hit - I'm surprised by the negative comments. It's a very robust, fabulous meal.

I recall making this last year for Christmas. It was soooo...tender, but not a great recipe. If you go easy on the herbs (omit the citrus and the nutmeg unless you really enjoy the flavor...most of the foodies at my table did not)and improvise on the sauce to your taste you should be okay.

Rating: 1
This recipe is just okay. I prepared it for my 80 year old French grandmother, an accomplished chef, who complained about it throughout the entire meal. She insists this is not how meat is supposed to taste. No one at my table found it extraordinary, so I will not make this again.

Rating: 4
I have been making this recipe since it appeared in Dec. 1996 to rave reviews. I can only say to those who don't like it, well, if you don't want robust blended flavors, stick to your bland tastes and leave these wonderfully complex blends of taste to those of us who do.

Rating: 1
Upon completion of the meal I felt compelled to race to my computer and rate this dish. I eat tenderloin at least once a month, and this is the worst recipe I have tried, ever. I am just now reading through the ratings and see many positive reviews, so I am surprised, but I also see many negatives. Beware!

Rating: 4
I prepared this for my family and families attending the wedding of my sister-in-law. Our local butcher provided me with some outstanding beef. Everyone raved about the flavor, it was delicious! At the wedding the next day, Beef Tenderloin was served by a professional Chef caterer, mine was better!

Rating: 4
This was my first time making a tenderloin and it turned out perfect (I would take the meat out at 120 degrees if you like it on the rare side). The guests raved about it and all asked for the recipe. Make sure to serve with a rich, full bodied red wine that can stand up to the rich flavors of the meat and sauce. I served potatoes gratin that had a hint of nutmeg that worked well with the meat flavors. I also served green beans and roasted onion vinagrette, and a green salad with maple-mustard vinagrette which were nice complements. One of my guests brought a pumpkin mousse to finish the dinner. A perfect autumn dinner!

Rating: 2
We liked the sauce and disliked the rub. There are too many flavors going on. Tenderloin shouldn't have all these flavors overwhelming the meat. Simple salt and pepper should do. Add flavors to your side dishes and skip this rub!

Rating: 3
I'd give this a 4 rating for just the tenderloin prep. I've been making this for the past 3 Christmas dinners plus special occasions, and the concensus is, use the spice rub to prepare the beef, but lose the sauce. The sauce is truly underwhelming and a lot of work (for nothing!) but the crusty edges of the roast are to die for. The longer you let it soak in, the better. Instead of the sauce in the recipe, I serve it with a fresh bearnaise, and everyone is thrilled.

Rating: 1
I've never rated a recipe so poorly. I usually sing the praises of them. But this one was not worth the effort. I am especially angry because this dish is very expensive to make. Who likes this? My husband and three teenagers didn't care for this at all, and they eat everything. I am amazed at all the good ratings for it.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe for a large family dinner and it was a HUGE success!! I liked the fact that much of the work for this recipe can be done ahead of time. I used a less expensive cut of beef, marinated it for 24 hrs since I would have no time the day of to put the spices on the beef, and used half of the suggested nutmeg and cloves in the "Tenderloin" section of the recipe as I was concerned that they may have been too overwhelming for people who aren't used to those kinds of spices with their meat. I will definitely make this again!!!

Rating: 4
I have made this dish many times and it has been part of my repertoire for a few years now. I am so surprised to hear the negative comments. . .all of my guests have raved over this dish. The last time I made it, I made a horseradish cream sauce instead of the red wine-shallot sauce and that was a big hit. Two keys to this recipe: the quality of the beef (tenderloin from Bread & Circus was melt-in-your -mouth delicious, albeit expensive. Tenderloin from Costco is also very good, believe it or not).) and 24-hours of marination time is very important. Try it with the horseradish cream sauce instead for a change! Enjoy.

Rating: 1
The do-ahead aspects of the recipe are great. The sauce is just ok. The rub is too overpowering for this fine a cut of beef. I would recommend testing this out on a less expensive cut of beef first to see if you even like it, and then adjust the seasonings accordingly.

I made this last night as a trial run for a dinner party we are having next week. This is a good thing because I asked my best friend to sample and give her opinion. I didn't think it was too bad but she thought it was awful. Guess I won't be making this recipe for the party!!

Well, it is obvious from the reviews that this recipe is one we either love or completely abhor. I decided to rate it one star because, although the recipe as a guideline is worth remaking, there are too many adjustments for my own taste that completely alter this recipe, thus creating an entirely new one.

There are plenty of roast tenderloin dishes out there, this one did not work for our family. Maybe without the rub it would turn out fine. I will stick with some of the others from epicurious that we enjoy.

Made this as part of a 5 course pairing of food and wines for some of our business associates. I greatly regret not having tried this recipe beforehand as none of my guests enjoyed this course. No one completed the course and I later fed it to our 2 dogs. What a waste of good beef. Such a shame that others rate it so highly.

Rating: 3
I only made the wine sauce since I was practicing before the "real event". I made the mistake of using dried Herbes de Provence...added too grassy a note. I strained the reduced sauce and added a beurre manie. What an incredible texture and mouth feel. Although the taste was somewhat sharp, I can tell this is going to be an exceptional sauce to have in my repetoire. I know I need to use a home-made stock and fresh herbs. I'll report back after my variations. I know I'll make this again, because it's got potential and it's a great do ahead sauce.

Rating: 4
This was so good!! Thanks to everyone for their suggestions. The blend of herbs is definitely one you'll need to adjust to your individual tastes. I made it for my parents who are "Francophiles", and I agreed with them about too much rosemary. Next time I'll go lighter on that as well as lighter with the orange, nutmeg, and cloves. What a dish! You should try this one.

Fabulous flavors in this recipe. The fresh herbs are wonderful with the beef. The key to success with this recipe is the quality of the beef. I purchased mine from Dean & Deluca - it was so tender. Also, I appreciate the fact that most of the work can be done in advance. It makes entertaining less stressful and more enjoyable.

Rating: 2
I was looking for something very special. However, how much more special can a $60 piece of beef be. The recipe did not give me anything close to the reaction, from either me or my guests, that I was after. Next time I want a special beef tenderloin entree, its back to only using salt and pepper. And for something really special, I'll roast it in a smoker with a hot hickory fire. That, served with cheese grits, has never failed to please everybody at my table.

This sauce is great - I make it the day before, and strain it, refrigerate and heat and add butter just before serving. Sometimes I leave out the orange peel, cloves, and nutmeg.

This is my first time rating an Epicurious.com recipe, but it is by no means the first recipe I have tried and loved from this site. I made this dish a day ahead and took it to the lake last night to feed a group of friends. It won raves!! I loved the make ahead aspect. We ended up cooking it on the barbeque (which I think I'd always prefer over the oven method) and I also served sauteed mushrooms (shiitake and button) over the meat along with the delicious sauce.

Fabulous! My husband can't get enough of this recipe and neither can the guests I've served it to granting me rave reviews! LOVE the do-ahead aspect too!

I read the bad reviews on this dish and I can't disagree with them more...this dish was fabulous! I made it for Christmast dinner for 20 people and everyone just raved. Also, the sauce doesn't get very thick with 1 tbsp. of flour, but my family is not into thick sauces. I agree with the cook from Sioux Falls, SD...make extra rub because it doesn't fully cover the meat. Also, the key to this recipe is letting the rub stay on for AT LEAST 24 hours. I made it previous to Christmas when I only marinated it for 2 hours and the herbs didn't have time to soak in which made them overpower the meat. Serve with garlic mashed new potatoes (skin on) and roasted asparagus marinated in olive oil, salt and pepper.

Rating: 2
With such an exciting list of ingredients and a perfect cut of meat, I was dismayed to find that this recipe did not wow me. Despite a very complex flavor, the sauce seemed to lack body. The marinade was quite nice and the beef was melt in your mouth tender but I found I could eat only a very small amount before the citrus flavor overwhelmed me. My guests seemed to enjoy it but I noticed that none went for seconds. I would not make this again.

Sorry to rain on everyone's parade but this was a thumbs-down in my house. Prepared the recipe exactly as written. It looked and smelled beautiful though.

Rating: 4
Too bad the rating system only goes to 4 forks, as this recipe is a five. My dinner guests raved and went back for seconds. I would increase the sauce next time, and stop the cooking for those rare meat lovers at 135', leaving the second roast in for the medium rare people. Worth ALL the effort!

We made this wonderful tenderloin recipe for our daughter's first birthday party (mostly all adults in attendance). It was a huge hit among all the guests, and the sauce was wonderful. In the future, I'd double the herb/spice rub as it didn't quite seem like enough to cover the meat thoroughly. The whole house smelled like a fabulous gourmet restaurant, and it was nice to prepare much of it ahead of time so that I could enjoy the party and our guests!

I made this last night when friends came for dinner, WHAT A HIT!!!! Not one slice left over and all agreed the sauce made the meal. I did cook the sauce down a bit more and then strained it-beautiful color and such intense flavors. The beef had wonderful flavor and you culd cut it w/ a butter knife. Everyone asked for the receipe-even my 12 & 14 yr old boys loved it and they are b-b-q sauce on everything!!Make this!!!

I made the sauce pretty much as written, but I added whole clove, a large piece of orange rind, and a bay leaf, then I simmered about an hour, strained the sauce through a fine seive, added half-cup of cream, and reduced again about 30 minutes more for a more refined product. Very good. I didn't like the idea of adding all those flavorings to good meat, so I used the sauce over 4 individually grilled tenderloin steaks, unadultered save for salt and cracked pepper. Served with risotto and porcini. Perfect.

This was the best beef tenderloin I have ever had, and I have tried alot!!! The flavors were fabulous! Had it for New Years Eve and it outshined the lobster tails we had! We used individual filets (really thick ones) and my husband barbecued them, they turned out perfectly. Started with Epicurious recipe for 'Cranberry Orange Salad', then the filets with this sauce, 'Bell Pepper Risotto', lobster tails and sauteed green beans with orange zest and red bell pepper slices, keeping 'orangey' flavour throughout. It was a true New Year's feast. Thank you Epicurious!

First look at this recipe might turn people away because of the length of the ingredients. However, it really was very easy. I especially liked the fact that I could make the sauce several days ahead and marinated the meat a day ahead. Not only did this taste good, it made for a beautiful presentation. It was a big hit with everyone. I certainly will keep this recipe in my "favorites" file. I've already passed it on to several family members.

Oh, YUM! I'm somewhat of a beginning/aspiring cook, and I was looking for something special for Xmas eve dinner (which my mother-in-law-to-be would be attending). I was definitely afraid of screwing up $60 worth of meat, but it was so easy, and everyone absolutely loved it. I made the sauce ahead, and between that and the tenderloin I thought they'd be too intense when combined -- both have really intense flavors. But they turned out to complement each other perfectly! I'll definitely be making this one again on some other special occasion. One piece of advice -- take a big plastic trash bag and wrap it completely around the pan with the meat before you put it in the fridge for 6-24 hours. Otherwise your fridge is going to end up smelling very strong for several days.

This has gotten to be a standard for us. The tenderloin is easy to prepare in advance and we cook it on the grill (we use a roasting pan) when oven space is tight.

I made this recipe for a dinner party of seven guests and received rave reviews from every one. Not a morsel of beef was left on the platter. I myself thought it was good, but I do find it is hard to make a bad tenderloin, since it is such a wonderful cut of beef. The herb rub is fantastic, and I will use that again; the shallot sauce was quite ugly looking, so I pureed it in the blender and sprinkled fresh thyme on top for presentation. That made it look better, and it seemed more flavourful. I might make the sauce again, but will continue to experiment with it.

I doubled the sauce recipe but didn't need to and also left out the orange. Magnificent!

So many reviews! I will add that yes it was great. We cooked the meat on the BBQ - excellent. I doubled the sauce (for a 2# tenderloin)and at first I strained out the shallots (reviewer comments) but there was not very much liquid left so I added them back in. It was exactly 1 3/4 cups.I then whisked in the butter. Flavors in the sauce were wonderful. A great and somewhat easy company menu.

This is the perfect dinner party meal: relatively easy to prep in advance,and spectacular in taste and presentation. My guests loved it, and no one thought it was too salty (cooking tip for the others: ALWAYS use unsalted butter and kosher salt, which allow you to better control the saltiness of a dish). The sauce was flavorful and delicious; everyone wanted more! I used a rich veal stock instead of broth (canned broth may be another culprit for those who thought the dish was too salty), a good red wine and reduced it over very low heat for a couple of hours. I served it with horseradish mashed potatoes and asparagus--plus a 91 Ferrari-Carano cab--and finished the dish with a decadent chocolate cake. A hit!!!!

I have not made this dish but I would like to comment on the orange peel. I have found that orange peel in a dish adds sweetness. If you don't like sweet sauces on beef consider leaving it out. The rest of the ingredients are too great to risk.

I made this for Xmas dinner, it was wonderful. I too, strained the shallots from the sauce before adding the butter. I thought the orange peel gave it a great taste. But then I'm citrus-inclined. I served it with Yukon Gold mashed atoes(the sauce over them like gravy)and gingered carrots(another Epi. recipe), the baby carrots from my garden, picked that week. The upside to global warming.

I made this recipe (quadrupled for a very large family), and there was not one morsel leftover. I did, however, make the sauce a day ahead - and strained it - as the shallots seemed excessive aesthetically, though not in flavor. The meat can also be left to marinate for an extra day, or two, to intensify the flavors - tho this is certainly not necessary. This is truly a magnificient recipe!

This was a winner. Most people would rate it a 4. Some of my guests thought there was too much seasoning and you could not taste the meat. My brother-in-law said it was his favorite Christmas meal ever!

I was not as crazy about the outcome of this dish as my guests were. The meat took a good 15 minutes longer than called for and I too left out the orange. The sauce was very nice (I strained it before adding the butter--a much nicer appearance that way). My New Year's guests loved it and that's all that really matters in the end.

This is a fabulous dish, and the nice thing is that all the preparation can be done the day ahead. I made this for a formal New Year's Eve dinner with au gratin potatoes and stuffed artichokes (from La Cucina Italiana, another great recipe source). The sauce does take a bit longer to reduce, and the cooking time for the meat was definitely about 12-15 minutes longer as well. The guests were definitely impressed and everyone wanted the recipe.

I made this for a New Year's eve buffet and received rave reviews. I omitted the orange peel as others have. Also, I agree with Bridget about too many shallots in the sauce recipe! The sauce was great, but not really necessary for a buffet style service of this dish. Overall, it's a keeper.

Rating: 4
Very tasty and even though my cuts were larger than 2 lbs (closer to 3), the amount of rub given was sufficient to cover both pieces. I started the cooking at 450 for 15 minutes to seal and then reduced to 400. Took a little longer to cook for med/rare but worth the wait. Served with plain yukon gold mashed potatoes and asparagus as I wanted the meat and sauce to be the center of attention. My guests for the New Year's Dinner raved.

I have made this recipe for a number of special occasions and love it, once we used beef tenderloin, another time used sirloin tip roast and this also worked well. We also used the recipe for making a pot roast using a less expensive meat and cooking the roast in the gravey. We added carrots to this dish and the carrots were amazing, they had soaked up the red wine!

I made this recipe for New Years Eve dinner. I had never done a tenderloin before and was a little nervous, but it came out so beautiful! My husband declared it to be one of the best things I've ever made, so I know it must be good. Three notes: First, my sauce took a good 40 minutes to reduce; I don't know how they got it to reduce in 20 as stated in the recipe, so be sure to allow sufficient time. Second, an instant-read thermometer is key. My 1-1/2 lb. tenderloin took almost 45 minutes to reach 135 degrees (medium rare). Third, I omitted the orange rind altogether based on prior reviews and we didn't miss it. This is going to be a frequent dish in our house!

Had this for Christmas Eve dinner. Everyone loved it. Shallot sauce is on the side so the kids didn't have to partake. Use the best cut of tenderloin available, also one tenderloin served six, we ate the second Christmas day sliced for sandwiches. Recipe serves 10 generously, not 8. Also, the goat cheese potatoes weren't all that great -- I'd recommend the Gruyere Potato Gratin as a better choice.

Rating: 2
What's with the shallots? The quantity must be a misprint? We actually strained them out of the sauce. The herb rub was good, but did not wow me. The sauce was good, but next time I would go heavier on the brandy and add garlic to give it a bit more kick. Overall very tasty, good presentation.

Made it Christmas Eve. Everyone loved it. Can't wait to have it again tomorrow night for New Year's Eve. Go for it.

To take the bitterness out of orange rind before adding to a recipe pour boiling water over the rind & let sit for one minute in the water then drain & use. This works!!

Rating: 2
Although it was quite good, I didn't think it was exceptional. The rub I would try again but I have tasted many far superior red wine based sauce for tenderloins. I had to tweak the sauce alot as the orange taste was overwhelming and bitter and the sauce was not as rich and substantial as I would have liked. I had to add sautee mushrooms to enhanced the sauce flavor.

Rating: 1
Did not like the herb and spice mixture for the beef--especially did not like the orange zest in it. Sauce was okay, but would not put the herb pan scrapings from meat in it--again, too much orange zest. The beef with shallot, port, and bacon sauce from Dec. 1997 Bon Appetit is much better, quicker, and easier. Also was not impressed with the goat cheese potatoes (too rich and no better than regular scalloped potatoes).

Rating: 3
Time consuming, but well worth it. Made a wonderful Christmas Eve dinner! Two notes, took much longer than stated in recipe to reduce sauce to proper consistency- and use a meat thermometer, trying to hit desired doneness via time is very difficult. Far too many variables! Great Recipe

After taking out a second mortgage, I bought 2 whole large tenderloins! Naturally I added a little a little extra garlic. We cooked the tenderloin over indirect heat on the barbeque and it was about the best thing I've ever tasted. Our 18 investment club guests raved about this. A definate special occassion recipe!

Made this for Christmas dinner was it was truly mouth watering...the best beef dish we ever had. I purchased the beef from Costco and it was fork tender, with great flavor. Based on the reviews I read before making this dish, I did cut back on the orange zest, rosemary and cloves; but doubled up on the garlic. The rub and sauce are fab-o, fab-o

Great recipe. I made this for Christmas dinner and it was some of the most tender beef we've ever had. Yum. Highly recommend this one! I ended up cooking it for 15 - 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for as we didn't want the meat rare.

I just made this for Christmas Eve dinner. My husband said it was the best tenderloin he's ever had. My friend said "wow" after each bite! It was very easy to prepare. I think this will be the start of a new traditional Christmas dinner! I only had one 2lb tenderloin and accidentally used the recipies amount of "rub" on the beef. BUT! it was wonderful! I think that next year I'll used 1 1/2 times what the recipe calls for! Make this recipe and you'll be the talk of the table!

I have been reading some of the other reviews. First if you don't like bold food don't make this. This is a wonderful tasting dish for those that like flavorful food. Sorry, but herbs do not overpower the meat. If you need a serious star for the table try it out. The sauce is extremely rich and a great addition. Again, if you want something bland this is not for you.

We made this for a Murder Mystery/Christmas party, and our crowd was so crazy about the dinner that they could hardly get their clues out between mmmmmm's and ohhhh's! Most impressed were our resident chef and his wife, who are still raving about it a week later. We also made the goat cheese scalloped potatoes, a marvellous compliment. Great meal for special occasions since you can make it ahead and it doesn't require much attention during the roasting.

I've made this recipe a have-dozen times or so. It never fails to get oooooos and ahhhhhhs. The last time, I fileted the tenderloin and stuffed it with thinly sliced red bell peppers that had been sauteed in butter and olive oil for about 45 minutes and some minced garlic and a variety of the herbs from the coating. It was beautiful and very Christmas-y.

This dish is wonderful! We were looking for a new tenderloin recipe for Christmas and tried this one out last Sunday. It's a new favorite! We also made the goat cheese scalloped potatoes---definately worth the fat calories!

As my husband said after eating this meal "THAT'S A KEEPER BABE!" I served it with the Scalloped Potatoes with Goats Cheese and Herbs de Provence, everybody raved. I didn't use the orange peel though, as I don't like the taste of orange and beef together. The remainder of the recipe I left as is(maybe adding a little more garlic), this was a to die for dish. I will make it again and again and again!

I would make this recipe again. The meat came out tender and tasty. I used cream instead of butter for the sauce.

The unusual combinations of herbs and seasonings make this a very special roast. However, we didn't like the wine sauce. Maybe I did something wrong in preparing it, but the sauce was too bitter and didn't complement the roast at all. The second time I prepared this dish, I just used the recipe for the herb/seasoning rub-type marinade and roasted the tenderloin in this declicious coating of herbs--no sauce at all. It was great. The suggested side dish of the goat cheese potatoes really does go well with this recipe. Already a favorite at our house and with guests!

The quality of the meat is of paramount significance with this recipe, as the flavor is augmented by the herbs. There is no place for poor texture to hide. I loved it, and used the entire menu from this issue, including the squash soup and goat cheese scalloped potatoes, for a lavish meal. Everyone enjoyed the effect, and the beef gave off an aroma which is wonderful

I made this for a New Year's Eve Dinner and it was a big success. I did not add the orange peel (I have never liked the taste of orange and beef together). The herbs are very strong which I like but I may cut down on the amount of herbs the next time I make this.

Rating: 3
This was very good, the flavors were intense and very unusual. My only complaint was the orange flavor was a little too strong. When I make it again I'll cut back on the orange peel. I made it for a special dinner party and received lots of complements. Preparing it and letting it marinate the night before made it very easy to manage the day of the party. The accompanying potato dish was also excellent.

Rating: 4
This dish is a sure-fire hit. I have made it several times now and it has never failed to highly impress my guest. A quality Black Angus cut of tenderloin is a good tip, and preparing the meat a day in advance is also recommended (for multiple reasons). If you are planning a big party and need a sophisticated dish that will really impress you guest, this may just what you are looking for. I will defiantly plan on doing it again and would like to thank the writer from Wayzata MN who tried it with venison-what a good idea. The one word of advice is to frequently check the meat and use a trusted thermometer if possible. The dish is excellent when the meat is medium to medium rare, but if it goes over it will dry out and not be as impressive. Finally, if you liked this dish, another similar dish which I have also prepared and had excellent results is the "BEEF TENDERLOIN WITH ROASTED SHALLOTS, BACON AND PORT." Interested readers can find the recipe in the Epicurious database.

I made this fabulous recipe for over for 50 guests attending my beau's a 30th birthday bash. I used all fresh spices, chopped and blended in a mini food processor, and I did not leave out a thing. I cannot count how many people raved about the tenderloin and asked for the recipe. I marinated the meat overnight with the herb rub, which was a blessing to a stressed out hostess. This recipe has made several appearances since the party!

Like a few others, I found the spices in this dish to be a little overpowering. Next time, I think that I will take the advice of others and cut back or skip the orange peel. I also used dried spices (versus fresh) so I might have gotten my ratios mixed up. Definitely worth another try, though.

I made this for our anniversary - it was the perfect meal to celebrate over. I made everything that I could ahead, so after a show in the city, all I had to do was cook the meat! I took many of the other reviewers suggestions which helped; I skipped the orange peel, decreased the amount of herbs for the rub, and strained the sauce. I also bought tenderloin tips which was MUCH cheaper, but just as good. Scalloped potatoes and fresh grean beens from our garden completed this wonderful meal!

Rating: 4
This is excellent. I made a few subsititutions, I didn't have scallions so I used onion and increased the garlic slightly. I also didn't have brandy but the sauce was still to die for. I served with whipped potato and yorkshire and it was excellent. Those who found it overpowering probably used dried herbs rather than fresh (which works fine, just remember to cut the amount in half). I would also suggest you could use a cheaper cut of beef, (I used Sirloin) and it was just divine!

The first time I made this dish, everyone loved it except me - I thought the spices were a bit overpowering (especially the rosemary). So the second time I made it, I improvised a bit with the coating - cutting the rosemary and thyme in half, adding more garlic and some fresh italian parsley, eliminating the orange peel. (The sauce I left as is.) This time I enjoyed it much more and everyone else still raved. It's definitely a great recipe for a special occassion dinner!

I made this dish for a "gourmet club" dinner party. It was fabulous, and got rave reviews from all of my guests, even those who claim not to be meat eaters! I served the sauce as is, as I prefer the texture of the onions, etc. I served it with a light side dish of a provencal-type veggie and bean dish, and it complimented the dish perfectly. Definitely a keeper!

A friend of mine, who generally doesn't cook, made this dish recently for my husband, my 4 year old daughter and myself, served with the goat cheese potates, simple steamed asparagus, and a bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape.

I liked this dish so much, I am making it for my father's upcoming birthday.

An excellent and well balanced recipe. A couple of slight improvemens which could be made to the sauce would be 1,To spice it up a little with a dash of cayenne. And 2,Just before serving the sauce, reduce it rapidly by ladelling it into one or more very hot wide-based pans. Just a suggestion.

This recipe IS wonderful with beef tenderloin. However, some of us are trying to eat healthier than beef, although we hate doing it. Venison is a virtually fat free red meat which is a wonderful beef substitute. I tried this recipe with the venison tenderloins and it was superb. I highly recommend it to any and everyone. You'd never know you were eating anything but beef unless you had a side by side taste test.
