I think this is a marvelous salad, especially with some sort of beef entree! When I don't have sherry vinegar, I've used a combination of white wine vinegar and dry sherry -- work fine. Pancetta is fine, but so is good, smoky, thick-sliced bacon. I use curly endive instead of other greens. It holds up to the strong flavors and weight of the warm mushrooms.

I got some chanterelles and looked for a recipe to use them in and this looked interesting so I made it. I loved the combination of the stilton with the dressing! very interesting flavors. Just wish chanterelles were not so hard to come by. Try this for something very different!

Wonderful. Very quick and uber-delicious. I used the mix of baby bellas and shitakes and it turned out great. I also accidentally added balsamic vinegar instead of the Sherry wine vinegar (the oil and vinegar are in the same white containers--whoops!) so then used the BV on the salad as well and it was all good and well. Great cold the next day, too.

This salad is very lovely as written. However, for those who like to "tweak" i suggest the following alternatives: 1) use a soft goat's cheese instead of blue - the way it melts is wonderful, and the flavours really blend well; 2) add oyster mushrooms to the mix - they add a nice texture; 3) add arugula to the greens  nice offset flavour; 4) don't toss the mushrooms into the salad, serve individually topped with first with cheese then mushroom mixture.

I used baby bellas and shitake but substituted merlot for the sherry vinegar. It was awesome, and I did not find it needed the extra oil for the greens. I will absolutely make it again!

I have made this salad a few times already. It is a wonderful salad before a filet mignon dinner. I do use the olive oil and sherry vinegar. But I also add merlot. You can use other vinegars to taste. I use prosciutto or black forest ham,and apricot stilton cheese. Not that I don't like the blue, but the taste of the stilton is fantastic. The apricot flavor with the ham is sensational.

This was excellent! I served with grilled filet and it was a perfect match. Not the season for chanterells, so I used baby bellas and shitakes, and for some reason I couldn't find stilton, so roquefort subbed. Definitely a keeper!

I replaced the Sherry Wine Vinegar with 1/4 c of Merlot. Also used Danish Blue Cheese instead of Stilton. Results: Yummy!

This was a great compliment to grilled steak and horseradish mashed potatoes. Perfect for a cold, rainy evening. The flavors are so strong together, it was delicious! To the cook from Milwaukee: I used white wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar and it was just fine.

I made this for Mother's Day lunch with mixed wild mushrooms and found it outstanding. I have already been advised to make it for Christmas under pain of a motherly guilt trip.

This was delicious! Added whole walnuts for crunch. Would also be wonderful with goat cheese and blue cheese. Basalmic vinegar might also be a nice touch.

I bet most vinegars will work fine. I bet balsamic would really be nice with the stilton.

I am not a huge fan of sherry - any suggestions on a substitution?

To the cook from Canada - your description of the greens you used is what is in a bag of "Bordeaux mix", which is available in US markets. I'm going to try this salad soon, sounds v. good.

Loved this salad! Surpisingly hearty and full of flavor. We substituted baby bellas and shitakes for chanterelles, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Will definitely be making this again!

A surprising and excellent salad bursting with flavour. I followed the ingredient list but used mixed Italian lettuce/curly endive/radiccio - needs fairly sturdy greens to stand up to the mushroom mixture. Just what is "Bordeaux lettuce mix"?

I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed the improv steps since I could not find chantrelles or the greens the recipe called for. I used baby bellas and shitake and baby arugla. It went well with steak and roasted potatoes.
