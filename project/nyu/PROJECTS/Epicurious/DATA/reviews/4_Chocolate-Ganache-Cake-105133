I make this cake for my niece every year for her birthday and everyone LOVES it!! I use the ganache for the filling and use the Sprinkles Chocolate Icing recipe for the outside of the cake! Decadent, but, Oh so yummy!!

Delicious cake--the ganache is the star. Bittersweet morsels come in a 24 oz. bag so I increased the cream to 3 cups which gave me plenty to frost the 4 layers (2 8" cakes split). Take the time to assemble the cake in stages, keeping the ganache just warm enough to spread, cooling the cake again before the final frosting. Otherwise the layers may slip and slide! A cold day outside may come in handy.

Made this last weekend for my hubby's birthday and it was delicious. Added extra yolk as suggested by some reader. Didn't use the chocolate frosting for the outside but instead used Cream Cheese Mascarpone Frosting. I am sure it will be great as it is but I needed the chocolate musical notes that I made for my cake to stand out.

I used Ghirardelli Premium Baking Bar, 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate in the ganache and it was way too intense/bitter. Also, I found it to be just (barely) enough for two-layer cake. Am I doing something wrong?

A knock-out! I made this as a birthday cake, and it was a big hit. I didn't have 3 pans, so I used 2 8" pans and cut the cakes in half. This made for very thin layers, which worked great as the ganache was the star of the show. Unlike others, my ganache glaze stayed silky and was picture perfect. Awesome recipe, will definitely make again.

I just made this cake yesterday. Made it according to the recipe. The cake is very easy to make! I didn't have three 7' pans so I used two 9' pans. It took about 35-40 min to bake at 350 f. I spread a thin layer of ganache in between the two layers and on top of the cake. After doing so, I ended p with a lot of leftover ganache so I am going to make the cake again and use the rest of the ganache. The cake looks very professional, holds beautifully and is easy to cut and serve. It is not too sweet and has a rich flavor of cocolate and a hint of coffee. I think it is super important to use good chocolate. Enjoy!

Wonderful Cake. Halved the recipe though because its a new recipe but it came out excellent. Its very moist,with dark rich chocolate flavor... very please 1(Used an 8"springForm pan, dust pans with cocoa powder instead of flour, baked for 50mins. 2)Substitute coconut milk for whole milk (didn't have milk), coffee for boiling water. 3)Added Khulna liquored.. about 1 tsp. For Ganache: Added 1 TBsp butter with heavy cream at medium heat, I used dark chocolate(didn't have bittersweet) Anyways... like to share this for am really happy my substitution came out well.. was a little nervous but glad I tried it.

I made this recipe from the book..now see it on the internet. Delicious, I've been asked to make it again. I made a second cake using the extra ganache. I do remember the cake being a bit dry, I will try an extra egg yolk and a bit more powder for additional flavor. I use Guittard chocolate found at Williams Sonoma.The picture I have of this cake is different....the outside lined with wafer cookies tied with a gold ribbon. I also will add raspberries to the filling and put a few on top :)

Really good - I read some of the concerns about dry cake layers, so brushed on sugar syrup mixed w/ Amaretto, and it came out very moist. The ganach makes a great frosting, too. Made this with my 6-year-old son and he was able to complete almost all the steps.

I just didn't think that the cake itself had enough of an intense chocolate flavor, although it was very moist (threw in an extra egg yolk) and the ganache was delicious. Next time I might try the recipe with 3/4 cup of cocoa powder.

ran out of cocoa so i substituted 6 squares (i.e. 3 of those small bars) of hershey's unsweetened baking chocolated, along with whatever cocoa i had left - maybe abt 3 tablespoons? turned out great, although i had to bake it for a longer time. also cut the sugar to just over 1 and a quarter cups, the resulting chocolatey flavour went well with the ganache. i also added slightly less than a quarter cup more of flour. this is some good chocolate cake!

This recipe is OUTSTANDING. I added shaved chocolate on the top and a circle of raspberries.

Delicious ganache- especially with a high grade chocolate like Scharffen berger Bittersweet. I agree with other reviewers - 1/2 the ganache recipe was just enough to ice the cake, though I might err on the side of a tad more. I paired the ganache with the Lemon Layer Cake recipe (though I substituted Orange for Lemon and used Grand Marnier). Delicious!

I made this cake exactly as-is in the recipe except I used a dome shaped mould for a kid's volcano birthday cake. It came out perfect - would recommend erring on the side of underbaking vs over baking as it gets very dry if bake longer, but has a nice moist texture if slightly underbaked.

This was wonderful! My daughter requested a "dark, rich, moist chocolate cake with cherry filling" for her birthday. I used hershey's special dark cocoa powder. Also, since some reviewers had reported it was dry, I drizzled cherry syrup (coffee flavoring type) over each layer for added flavor even though the cake didn't seem dry. I added chopped sweet cherries between each layer. Investing in the 7 inch pans was worth it, the cake was beautiful as well as delicious! A keeper!

Cake was really delicious...the actual cake was a little dry however a little spray of simple syrup helped moisten it. I used my own Ganache recipe which was a mix of semi-sweet and unsweetend chocolate..Which wasn't too far off from actual recipe, and put sliced strawberries in the layers of Ganache. Wasn't too sweet and the tart/sweetness of the strawberries is a perfect blend with the ganache.

I made this cake last night for my boyfriends birthday and it was AMAZING!! I'm not even a big chocolate lover, and I loved this!!! The best part is that it looks so fancy and beautiful. You will look like a true pastry chef when you serve this. Just one thing, the GANACHE is way too much. Cut the recipe in half, and you will still have plenty left over.

Rating: 3
I used two 8 inch cake pans because I didn't have 7 inchers, and cut each layer in half. It turned out a little dry, so next time I'll keep an eye on it and pull it out sooner. To moisten it up a little, while I was assembling the cake, I poked the layers with a fork and sprinkled them with Frangelico. Bailey's might be nice too. For the ganache, I put the chocolate in a double boiler, let it melt a bit, and then slowly added warmed cream while whisking. It turned out perfectly glossy, without any lumps. I've always had good results using this method and would recommend it to those who are having trouble with gritty or separating ganache. It took 2 1/2 to 3 hrs to cool down in the fridge. I then took about half of it and whipped it with an electric mixer to make a fluffy icing and frosted each layer approx. 1 cm thick (I also added a few splashes of Frangelico before whipping). This made the cake quite a bit taller and far less dense- a nice balance between fluffy filling and the heavier cake, in the style of cakes I've found in German bakeries. I used the rest of the unwhipped ganache to frost the outside of the cake. It was just enough to cover it with a thin layer and fill in and smooth out the sides. I served it with raspberries and unsweetened whipped cream with a bit of vanilla in it. Overall, the cake turned out fairly well. It was really pretty, not too sweet, and was very well received. Again, I found it a little dry, and the cake part not as chocolaty as I would like (although the ganache made up for it), but I think these are fixable problems. I would definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
I love this cake, I've made it twice already and I'll definitely make it more in the near future. I followed some reviewers' tips about adding some raspberry between the layers, which tastes great, but I found it makes it more difficult to get the layers of the cake to stay stuck together, as the chocolate ganache, once at a spreadable consistency, would otherwise facilitate. So I probably won't do that again. Also, the recipe makes too much ganache -- I'll use 4 oz. less of chocolate and a little less cream.

Rating: 4
A wonderful cake, and the ganache makes a perfect icing. It was just the right consistency for spreading, and so rich! My only complaint is that there was way too much ganache. In the future, I'm going to use a pint of cream and a pound of chocolate. That should be more than enough.

Rating: 3
The cake itself was great but i did something horribly wrong with the ganache--TWICE--and I can't figure it out--the first time I made it, I made it with white chocolate and it never got hard enough. The second time, I used Ghirardelli bittwesweet but it seperated and was lumpy and gross! I was even too scared to use it between the layers. What did I do wrong?!?

Rating: 4
The ganache was excellent, and the cake was pretty good. I halved the recipe and used one 8-inch round pan. I think I baked it for about 35 minutes, but after 20 minutes I was checking every 5 so I lost track. I cut the cake into 3 layers. Next time I'd use one 7-inch pan so it would be a little higher. I spread the ganache pretty thinly between the layers, since I was worried about running out. But in the end, there was more than plenty, so next time I will be more generous in between the layers. But it was still delicious. I used Lindt chocolate - yum. I think spreading some raspberry jam in the layers, before the ganache, would make it phenomenal!!!!!

I had unannounced guests arriving within the hour, and used this recipe because it looked easy. It was surprisingly easy and moist, but with the following modifications: regular white sugar because I didn't have brown sugar on hand and skipped the espresso powder. For ganache, I added 2 tsp corn syrup and heated everything til melted. I like a very "solid" glaze, so heated it longer, and poured over the cake when still lukewarm.

Absolutely delicious! I loved this rich moist choccy cake. Best cake I have ever tasted. I found my ganache didnt really set and the cake was pretty ugly; but my goddness what a taste! The thing i found was if you do a skewer test don't wait till the skewer comes out completwly clean (afew crumbs) - just until the cake springs back. Truly yummy cake and very easy,cheap and tasty a hit with everyone!

Fantastic cake for chocoholics. This is the chocolate cake recipe I've been looking for for years. It's moist, dense, intensely chocolate, but tender and delicate. The ganache is a fantastic icing. Following the directions, the ganache was the perfect spreading consistency after four hours. And it set up nicely overnight before serving.

Rating: 3
Just to answer some people's questions. For a shiney ganache, you never refrigerate it. Once your cake is decorated and you refrigerate it, it will lose its shine. Also, the ganache sets up much better at room temperature. I don't chill mine. To glaze a cake, let it cool for 1 hour, for a filling let it set up overnight.

I've made this cake dozens of times. It's always a winner at parties. Sometimes I'll just make the cake and sprinkle it with posdered sugar if I'm in the mood for a simple chocolate cake. Sometimes I'll skip the ganache and serve the cake with whipped cream frosting.

This cake was absolutely perfect for my birthday! I baked the layers in two 8" pans and split each in half. I would definitely use more than 1/2 cup of ganache between each layer, more like 3/4 or 1 cup (I like frosting). For the ganache I heated the cream with lavender blossoms (you can find them in health food stores) then strained them out when I added it to the chocolate. Heavenly! When I make this again I will probably only do the lavender ganache in between the layers and regular ganache for the outside, it was a bit overpowering but still a wonderful change from your usual chocolate cake. For the outside frosting I did the crumb coat as suggested, chilled the cake and then heated the rest of the ganache until it was runny and poured it over the cake. It looked straight from a professional bakery and my friends were very impressed. Perfect cake for a birthday blowout!

This is now the grown-up birthday cake of choice among my friends. Its not the easiest cake to make, so we get all the Spring birthdays together at one time & make the cake. So Rich. So good. So worth the effort...and that's coming from someone who isn't a chocaholic!

This is truly a fabulous cake which I have made several times now. The cake is dense and rich; the ganache is so delicious and above and beyond anything else in the way of frosting. I make it for special occasions; everyone raves! A truly beautiful presentation! I made it 2 weeks ago for my granddaughter's birthday, and did a little piping of ganache around the edges - very simple, but an elegant touch. The family took pictures.

I didn't actually make the cake recipe(because with a newborn, making a cake from scratch while Honey is off at work is IMPOSSIBLE!!!LOL!!!) BUT, I used the ganache recipe to ice a cake for a dessert party we are attending. I needed a luxurious topping to a simple choclate layer cake. (YES! I was bad and used Duncan Hines, Swiss Chocolate cake mix. The two turn out fabulous however) From the sampling I had it came out fabulous and sinfully delicious! This recipe was super EASY!, and super fast! (I had no problems making it while Maya was napping.) May I suggest Gheridelli's double chocolate, it's perfectly deep in flavor and not too sweet. I also garnished the cake with these silk "fall" leaves bought at the craft store. It's truly looks perfect for any fall party. I'm confident this ganache cake will please all the guest's taste buds; I can't wait to serve it.

I made just the ganache from this recipe to use as the frosting for a different cake that I was baking. The ganache came out nothing like the beautiful glossy finish in the photo and wound up cooling to look more like a dry crumbly mess. I followed the directions exactly, and am not sure what might have gone wrong. It certainly was embarassing to serve at the graduation party that I had made it for... luckily the two other cakes came out beautifully!

I made this cake and it turned out wonderfully. I did not, however make the Ganache topping/filling because of time. I used a Cream Cheese with Whipping cream and chocolate shavings icing which turned out pretty darn good. I then used extra chocolate shavings on the base around the cake and across the top. It was a hit that didn't last long at all. ICING RECEPIE: Ingredients: 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened 1 cup powdered sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 10 (1.5-ounce) milk chocolate candy bars with almonds, divided (I used one of those really large Hershey kisses (7oz)grated/chopped up in the mix and some almond candy bars in the topping)but these are more expensive than buying the big 8 oz bars of chocolate 1 (12-ounce)container frozen whipped topping, thawed (I used a cup and a half (14 oz?) of whipped whipping cream instead)Directions:BEAT cream cheese, powdered sugar, and granulated sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until mixture is creamy.CHOP 8 candy bars finely (I used the Kiss for this). Fold cream cheese mixture and chopped candy into whipped topping.SPREAD icing between layers and on top and sides of cake. Chop remaining chocolate bars and put half sprinkled across the top of the cake. Press remaining chopped candybars along bottom edge of cake. (use some kind of utencil to press the chocolate into the cake because your hand's heat will melt the chocolate) From "Milk Chocolate Bar Cake" Southern Living April 2000.

Amazing cake. I added a layer of rasberries and it was great. Had some slight panic with the ganache (looked like soup for ages and then separated but nothing time and stirring didn't fix) but next time will know what to expect. Definitely a hit and comfortably fed 16 people.

Great cake! It looked and tasted great. It is VERY rich and needed vanilla ice cream on the side! It was easy to work with the ganache. I also microwaved it (10 sec/stir/10 sec) to get it to the perfect consistency. I saved the last bit of ganache until right before party time and melted it, poured it over the cake and it was shiny.

I've never made a cake before and I really enjoyed assembling this recipe. There are several steps involved and if you have the time to spare, it's really fun. The result was beyond my expectation as well as the taste! The cake got rave reviews from my friends who didn't believe it was home made. My ganache didn't get too hard as some others have experienced. It did not retain it's shinyness however. Everything tasted great with some fresh raspberries on top.

This cake is now called Chocolate Sin with my family. The cake was very moist, and just the right amount of chocolate. The ganache was just sinful and delicious, it reaaly makes this cake! I will be making this cake again.

The cake was good but the ganache was just too thick. It was greatly improved by the addition of a layer of raspberry jam on each layer and I think it would be nice with warm ganache instead of cold. It was so thick that it was difficult to cut. Whipped cream also helps contrast the intensity of the chocolate.

The cake for this recipe is great tasting and so was the ganache. I have to say that I was disappointed that the ganache got dull and flat looking after refrigeration - I thought it would stay shiny like it was when I made it. Added a thin layer of raspberry and decorated top with them also. Needed to make this a large cake (it was for a party) and used two 10-inch pans. It could have used more batter, because the cake was not that high, but it was verrrrry moist. If you don't like a cake that is too sweet, this is a great cake, and the ganache compliments it well.

This is one of the best chocolate cake recipes I have made - extremely easy and quite delicious. I used my own filling recipe and used 1/2 cup cream and 4 oz. chocolate for the covering ganache which retained its shiny sheen even after cooling. The cake has a great chocolate taste and moist texture - almost, but not quite, as tender and light as a box mix. Definitely a keeper!

I LOVED this recipe! I made it for my mom's birthday party and everyone raved. I made it all the night before (2 8-inch layers that had to cook for about 30 min), and assembled it the next day, nuking the ganache for 20 seconds to make it spreadable. This is rich, easy to make for inexperienced bakers, and a joy to present and eat. YUM! p.s. I halved the ganache--then it was just the right amount.

I loved this cake... I thought the recipe was very accurate to follow. I made the whole thing the night before and assembled it the next day.

Very, but very good recipe. It's not too sweet, looks great & makes you feel as though you are a great cook. IMPRESIVE is the word, looks amazing and tastes great too !! I agree that you do have some ganache left over, so don't worry about testing some every time you stir it. As far as the Brits are concerned use double cream for the ganache and to the person whose ganache came out too thin, maybe the cream was the problem, make sure you use thick cream (ie. cream that can be whipped). I've made this recipe about 8 times since last year and it really is worth it.

This cake is absolutely delicious! It was fairly easy to make. I read a lot of comments about how long people had to leave out the ganache to soften to frosting consistency. I checked it often while chilling and found that it needs only about 2 hours to chill before you use it to frost the cake. Made it for my family for Valentine's Day and it was a huge hit!

This cake was awsome! It was my first attempt at baking a cake from scratch and, to my surprise, it turned out perfectly. I took it to a friend's home for Christmas dinner and everyone was very impressed. (I used Ghiradelli chocolate.) I made the ganache a day ahead and chilled it overnight. However, it took forever to bring it to a spreadable consistency, so I ended up microwaving it for a few seconds, which worked out fine. I garnished the cake with sugared rose buds from my garden. It was delicious and beautiful!

I didn't want to buy another container of heavy cream and not finish it, so I only used 2 cups (1 pint container) of heavy cream, and 18oz of chocolate. The ganache was too hard and I had to reheat it repeatedly to soften it so it was more spreadable. The cake was good without the ganache. It's overall just an average cake. I'm still searching for a good chocolate cake recipe.

If you want a chocolate cake, this is fantastic! I layered the cake with layers of Baily's pastry creme to help cut the ganache. The cake is VERY delicate when it comes out of the pans, so be careful to prepare your pans properly. The ganache is a large order BUT you can use the remaining refridgerated ganache to make small truffles to garnish with. IF you do this, simply roll the ganache into balls and roll in cocoa powder (see any truffle recipe for more details).

I made this the other night for a friend's birthday. The toughest part for me was chopping up the chocolate for the ganache (no food processor - tried to use a blender, but I think I burnt out the motor!). Came out very good. I would even say to bake the cakes for about 5 min. less next time. Toothpick read that is was done but it was just a tiny bit dry. I got a big Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate bar and peeled it with a potato peeler - put the peels on top of the cake and around the crystal platter I served it on. Looked amazing! Just a quick note: I refrigerated the ganache overnight. Had to leave out for about 6 hours before I could spread....so the 2-3 hours is definitely not right (at least it wasn't for me). Very impressed. First attempt at a "from scratch" cake. My boyfriend even ate a huge piece and he hates cake. Never buying box or bakery cake again.
