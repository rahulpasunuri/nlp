I made this as a first course while on vacation with a bunch of adults and everyone loved it. Totally delicious and refreshing, way easier to make than it looks. Only difficulty was all that julienning. If you have an adjustable blade slicer with a julienne attachment this would be a breeze.

i served this as a first course at a casual dinner for July 4 and no one can stop raving about it - it was incredibly easy to make but looked outstanding when served and blew my guests away
