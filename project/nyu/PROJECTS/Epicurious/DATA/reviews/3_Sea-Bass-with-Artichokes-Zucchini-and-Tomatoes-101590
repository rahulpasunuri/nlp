Based on other reviews, I too chose to omit the clam juice. I sauteed the veggies for about 2 minutes and seared the bass just so that it browned on all sides. Once it put it in the oven it was great!

First, thanks to all the reviewers who came before. I added more fresh tomato, more basil, and more zucchini and served it with cous cous. It was good...not spectacular. WAY too much liquid, and I didn't even add the crab juice. I would use 1/2 the artichoke "sauce" and if you use fresh veggies really really drain/squeeze them. The flavors were good but I felt something was missing - not sure if it could use something in the salt/herb category - I might make it again but it was not nearly as good as I had hoped

I have made this before, always eliminating the clam juice. This time I added a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and it was fabulous. Be sure to use lots of chopped garlic. I also cut the zucchini into fairly thin slices and steamed them in the microwave for a few minutes just to soften it so that everything got done at the same time. I used Tilapia and it was fabulous!

A quick and easy dish for any night of the week. Substituted a can of dice tomatoes drained for the plum tomatoes and increased the basil because I had lots on had (also increased garlic just because we like it). It was very "juicy" so next time will likely skip the clam juice. It didn't bring a lot of goodness to the flavor. Served it with some whole wheat linguini with olive oil and a green salad.

This is a great weekday after-work meal. Very easy to prepare, reasonably healthy, and ready in 20 minutes. Based on some of the other reviews I left out the clam juice, and the steamed potatoes were a perfect compliment. Enjoy!

I've made this several times now, and think it's terrific. I also add shallots, but at this point make it without the clam juice. I think it takes away from the flavor of the sea bass. It's in the regular dinner rotation in our house.

I thought this dish was totally tasteless and boring. I would not make it again.

The only thing I did differently was to add another 20 minutes to the cooking time. The zucchini was still a bit al dente, and the sea bass was moist and buttery. Viola!

I give this recipe 3 forks because it is orginal and delicious. Everyone that tried this dish was fanatic about it. Truly this dish was by far one of the best fish dishs I have prepared.

Fast, easy and delicious! Had to substitute marinated artichokes for the grilled baby artichokes I had on hand, and the marinade for olive oil&lemon juice. Added the capers as other reviewers suggested - perfect!

This dish was great! Easy to make, and turned out great. I've made it twice so far, and plan to make it again soon. The second time I didn't have the clam juice so I added a little cooking sherry, and it was just as tasty. Also good with capers.

Very tasty and simple weeknight supper -- light, flavorful, quick, healthy, and easy -- my significant other really noticed! (He's a culinary babe but pronounced it "delish".) Do add capers for pizzazz. I used red snapper, and served with brown rice and a spinach/orange salad -- felt like we were at Moosewood! Healthy!

The first time I made this recipe, I was the only one who ate it! The rest of the people in my family either did not care to eat "healthy", or did not like fish. Well, I made it again tonight, and have won over two more people to my side. You simply cannot go wrong with this meal! I served it with sauteed swiss chard and crusty bread... a definite keeper,(and something I would absolutely serve to guests!)

This is wonderful. The combination of vegetables really enhances the flavor of the fish. I skipped the clam juice, too. It's not haute cuisine, but it's very tasty.

This was great and I would highly recommend it. It was also surprisingly hearty, given all of the things one adds, so it doesn't need a tom of sides. Maybe just a salad.

This is great! I used tilapia instead of sea bass but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and considered it a success. I served this over garlic rice and had an easy, elegant meal.

This recipe was incredibly easy and delicious. Like others, I simply skipped the clam juice and added some garlic. This will definitely become part of my regular repotoire.

I do not understand what's NOT to like about this recipe. It is not fancy and I would not serve it at a dinner party, but it is a simple, flavorful, quick recipe, with mostly fresh ingredients. I am a culinary historian and I trained as a chef in France and I still need to put dinner on the table most nights, so I value simple fresh combinations that can be varied by season or by what's available where one lives. I think that the small jars of marinated artichokes (they come in SPICY version too!)are a wonderful pantry staple. I have prepared this dish with eggplant instead of zucchini, with sea scallops instead of fish, I haved varied with fresh herbs, shallots, garlic, etc. I used garlic scapes recently because they are in the farmers markets in my area now along with the first summer squashes. In my opinion, this recipe does not pretend to be something you'd pay 24.00 for as a main course in a restaurant, lighten up!

This dish was easy, quick, attractive and tasty. I left out the clam juice (couldn't think of future use for rest of bottle) and switched to snapper (fishmonger was sold out of the chilean sea bass). Threw in a fat sliced up shallot. Stuck it in the oven next to a tray of new red potatoes (olive oil, italian seasoning and salt). Jumped in the shower and when I came out dinner was ready to serve with some rustic bread, olive oil and a semillion chardonnay. I got a lot of "honey this is great" so give it a try yourself :^)

This recipe is a great base-line. I suggest addingor removing whatever your tastes desire. I added a pineapple chutney and spiced chopped tomatoes to the baking dish and took out the articokes. Instead of the articoke juice as a marinade, replace with cocktail olive juice.

I was surprised by the negative comments on this recipe. I am a caterer and have used this recipe many times and always with rave reviews. Capers are a great addition and use plenty of garlic and basil. This recipe is foolproof, a real hostesses dream.

I thought this recipe was disgusting. It didn't bring out the fish's flavor and was very boring. I don't recommend this recipe at all.

Very simple and easy. One dish cooking was great for cleanup. Very difficult to mess up. Looked beautiful on the plate.

I have to agree with all the statements below, oddly enough. It WAS a bit dull, but also easy and I think it could be made wonderful with the addition of maybe capers or sundried tomatoes and I will try that next time. This has a lot of potential.

This is a dish that is not bad to use up leftover vegetables or if you're in a hurry - just fills your stomach. Boring...

The results of this simply prepared dish are outstanding! This is a great recipe that can be used as a dinner for two, or doubled/tripled/whatever and served to guests.

Incredibly quick and easy recipe - so much so that I thought it might not be very good. Fortunately, I was mistaken. It's light and full of many flavors that mix wonderfully. All the vegetables serve as a sidedish in themselves - a complete meal.
