Pretty lame. A fairly mild fish like mahi-mahi does not work well with a yogurt curry. It would be better with lamb.

Maybe it's the kind of curry I used (Spice Islands spicy curry) but I have a feeling I did NOT need to add that extra cayenne and extra curry, because while I only marinated the fish for 3 1/2 hours, it was hot! Not killing yourself hot, but hot enough to stick around on the lips. I didn't scrape the marinade, I added some honey, I tossed some onion slivers and cut up tomatoes in while I let it marinate and then broiled the fish (apartment) and cooked the remaining sauce with the veggies in a pan on low heat, adding a tiny bit of butter and some water. If I were doing it again, I would DEFINITELY make more marinade and use the sauce over rice, it was tasty! The tomatoes + the fish were excellent together.

I made a couple of changes to the recipe and it turned out great. Channeling my Indian mother-in-law, I toasted the spices in a dry skillet and then added a tiny bit of olive oil, along with the ginger and garlic. After toasting for a minute longer, I added the spice mixture to the yogurt. When serving the fish, I warmed the yogurt mixture (over low heat, as the yogurt will separate). For acidity, I added a splash of rice vinegar to the warmed sauce. I balanced this with a small bit of honey as well. The sauce went really well over brown basmati rice and the fish.

We liked this a lot, I added a tiny but more spice to the marinade because of the feedback from other reviewers. I think next time we'll add some yogurt and lime to the cucumber relish.

I used half the amount of fish, and the full amount of yogurt marinade. Increasing the amount of marinade definitely makes it tastier.

i'm indian and i liked the lightness of this dish combined with the piqunacy. i don't reccomend doubling the spices..and i think serving it with brown rice and a little cucumber raita wld be delicious..that's what i did...

I love Indian food so I decided to give this a try. I doubled the seasonings and the marinade was very aromatic. Unfortunately it turned out bland and the relish was awful. It was a waste of great ingredients. I should have listened to the other reviewers!

Generally good, but the second time around I made these variations- add salt to both relish(1/4 tsp) and to fish (1tsp), add cayenne pepper(1-2 tsp-to taste) to fish, and instead of vinegar in relish, add lime or lemon juice- 1-3tsp (depending on how sour U like!!)

Spicy, fresh and delicious when a few modifications are applied. Use fresh ingredients and only marinaded for a few hours! I used Maui Maui coated with a thick Greek yogurt, not the runny breakfast stuff. I used powdered ginger in the marinade and fresh ginger for the salad. The most significant change is the use of brown rice seasoned vinegar. Make sure you are using seasoned rice vinegar. The brown rice variety gives a wonderful rich flavor. I did not thoroughly scrape off the marinade, leave some on. i also cooked this on the grill. It was wonderful!

I too thought this was a bit on the bland side. I added some chutney onto the cooked fish and found it vastly improved. It was healthy and easy. Will make again, but not without some sort of chutney!

Blah. I was really disappointed in this dish. I used smaller portions of fish because I served it as an appetizer, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. I marinated the fish overnight and made the relish the day before, so the flavors had plenty of time to marry and develop, but it was still a dish with little "oomph." The fish hardly tasted "spiced" at all. The relish was pretty bland, too - just sort of vinegar-y cucumbers. I won't try this again.
