This was so good!! It was a hit with my guests at our Christmas in November party this year. Keeping it in the skillet made for easy serving and easy clean-up.

This was a big hit at our last family get-together. Easy enough for my 11 and 12 year-old daughters to make, but it was VERY thick. We thinned it with extra beer. Next time I'll double the serrano, just to spice it up a little bit more.

I added cumin and thinned with a little milk. Very tasty.

This was bland and boring. I have made many versions of fundido and this was the worst.
