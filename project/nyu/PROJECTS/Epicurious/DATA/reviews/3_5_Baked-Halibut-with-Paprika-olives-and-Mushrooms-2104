I just made this, it was really good. I left out the bell peppers and used tilapia, but other than that I followed the recipe. Simple and really tasty, the olives add a nice kick!

Had a pound of halibut fresh from the farmers' market (two of us ate a little over half), also shiitake mushrooms, spring onions--and a fresh red pepper from elsewhere. I used pimenton and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Except, out of respect for my ingrediants, I left out the olives (or capers). Super good. Next time I may do more mushrooms-onions-red peppers, especially if I have good mushrooms.

Excellent and easy. Used only 2 pieces of halibut, but otherwise followed it exactly. The flavor meld beautifully, resulting in a sweet and spicey mixture.

We like the vegetable mixture so much that we double that part of the recipe! We use pimenton (Spanish paprika) adds a lot!

Great flavors yet simple.

I used haddock, extra lemon juice, portobellos, and substituted 1 T. capers for the olives. Since I didn't have hot paprika, I used 1/2 t. regular paprika with 1/4 t. cayenne for half the recipe. The fish was moist, flavorful and pleasantly spicy.

Didn't have any lemon on hand, and did add the jack cheese the recipe was originally inteaded to have. It turned out great! Will definitely make this again. Thank you!

I gave this 4 forks (I save only for the best) in part because the halibut filet we bought was so fresh it really made the recipe outstanding. The flavors from the vegetable mixture work so well together and the hot paprika gives it a little kick - I halved the recipe but used 1 tsp of the paprika. The preparation is simple and the result is 'fine dining' quality. I served this with rice and a simple vegetable. Next time I will do a salad instead of the veggie.

I followed the recipe as is and didn't change a thing (for the first time in my life). It was delicious. I made it for Christmas eve dinner and everyone liked it. I was going to make it like the original author suggested, but I couldn't find the "pimenton" or "jack cheese". I will definately make this dish again for it was easy and delicious. Next time I will have the pimenton and chesse.

I loved this recipe. It was easy & delicious - what more could someone want?! I have to admit, I substituted cod for halibut - I was in a hurry and the selection at the market was meager. The result was fantastic. I was generous with the lemon. Once served I needed to add a little salt.

This is wonderful and the veggie mixture is deeelicious!! It's so simple to make as well. I'll definitely use this recipe again - even on company!

I am the author of this recipe, which originally appeared in The Cook's Exchange column of the July 1993 issue of Bon Appetit. In the column I prefaced my recipe by saying that the ingredient hot paprika was a substitute for 'pimenton', hot paprika from Spain, which was difficult to find in the U.S. at the time. Using pimenton make an incredible difference in the outcome of the dish. (You may also be interested to know that the original recipe I submitted to Bon Appetit called for 2 tsps. of grated jack cheese to be melted over the fish toward the end of baking. Apparently the editors of Bon Appetit preferred it this way!). I am flattered that my recipe appears on your website.

I love this recipe, and make it frequently. But, I make the following changes to make it a little more flavorful: --I use the amount of vegetables in this recipe for each 3/4 lb of fish (we like a thicker topping) --I saute the vegetables in virgin olive oil --I use sliced carrots instead of mushrooms --I use garlic stuffed olives and add in additional pickled garlic --I add some lemon juice to the veggies while I am sauteeing them --I use a generous amount of spicy Hungarian paprika. These changes give the dish a beautiful color and a lot of flavor.

Not bad, but not as flavorful as one would hope.
