I made this soup for a small luncheon I had. If you try it, make sure that your guests are BIG fans of cumin. Although I love cumin, it almost completely overpowers the cucumber and it leaves an unpleasant aftertaste right away. If I were to experiment, I'd add some lemon or lime juice and maybe some chopped cilantro to somehow balance the flavor of the cumin. Maybe it would be better to add some ground cumin instead of the toasted seeds.
