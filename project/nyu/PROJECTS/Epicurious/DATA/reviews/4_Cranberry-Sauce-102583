This cranberry sauce was easy and excellent. I doubled the recipe and used 1 3/4 cup of water, 1/4 C Port, 1/2 cinnamon stick and a little of the juice from the zest orange. Yum!

Made with 1/4 c pc organic w/pulp OJ and 3/4 c water, and just under 1c of pc organic cane sugar, just a pinch of zest from mandarin orange at the end. Brought water/sugar mixture to boil for about 4 min before adding the cranberries, then boiled for about 8 min or so after. May reduce liquid total by about 1/8c to make it slightly thicker, but was great this time. Family loved it. This was fabulous! Gave 4 forks for taste and absolute ease combo.

Delicous with revisions! I reduced the water to 3/4 C, added 1/4 C. frozen oj concentrate, & 4 Tbl. Calvados.

The idea of orange is good, but I think they needed the Zest reduced by 1/2 at least. Otherwise, very bright and flavorful. I will take my advice next time I make them.

Super easy and very yummy - and I'm not really a cranberry sauce fan! I added a splsh of port and a 1/4 tsp of cardamom.

This is delicious! I don't even like cranberry sauce, but this sauce was so simple and it came out fantastic. I added a squeeze of orange juice from the orange that the zest came from. And I added a splash of port. I cooked this 2 days before Thanksgiving to give it some time to sit. It was awesome.

So easy to make and it came out the perfect consistency. I used 3/4 sugar, 1/2 cup fresh squeezed orange juice, 1/2 cup water, and the zest from two oranges. I let the juice and sugar simmer for about ten minutes, then stirred in the cranberries, zest and some small bits of orange from 1.5 oranges. I let this cook for about 15 minutes, till the sauce was beginning to thicken, then removed from stove, where it thickened further. Next time I'd use less zest or a tablespooon or two more sugar. So easy and so much better than store bought.

My pre-teen aged children prepared this dish by themselves. It was simple to make, but in the end the dish was a little to watery for my liking. I prefer something a little thicker to eat with my turkey. It was a little tart too.

Easy to make. I'll never buy cranberry sauce in a can ever again. I didn't know cranberry sauce could taste this good.

Really simple recipe. You'll never get it from a can again. To cut some of the tartness, I used the juice from the same juice orange that I zested, rounded out the flavor. Might cut some of the sugar next time though it was pretty good with the whole cup.

It's a winner!!! I used 1/4 orange juice and 3/4 water. Next time I will cut back on the sugar...maybe 3/4 cup. Will make this again.

Since I decided to use this with pork, I added a few cloves in the simple syrup instead of the orange zest. Added a few dried cranberries too, that really intensified the flavor.

Simple yet very effective. Hubby claims it's the best he ever had! We actually like to make it just before serving the meat and serve it warm so it doesn't cool down the meat. Yummy!

I just made this for Thanksgiving and it is FANTASTIC...I don't even like cranberry sauce but this one was exceptional! I did add the wine as was suggested by someone and it was just great! Rave reviews from cranberry lovers and haters alike!

Very easy. The sauce was a little tart, so I added sugar mixed with cardamon spice to taste.

Very good. Mine came out a bit watery. I plan on making it again, but letting a little more liquid evaporate before adding the cranberries

Went over very well at Thanksgving. Only change I made was to use 1/4 cup orange juice and 3/4 cup water. Easy to make 100% organic.

I cannot believe how easy and good this is. The basic recipe is on the Ocean Spray bag.

Very simple with excellent results. I also added a touch of orange liquer (Cointreau) as was suggested by another reviewer. Yum.

Rating: 3
Followed some of the other suggestions and used 3/4 c white sugar, and 1/4 c brown sugar. Also added orange sections so as not to waste the orange after zesting. It was good, but maybe a bit too sweet. Will reduce the sugar next time, and maybe follow other reviewer's suggestion to add a bit of red wine and lemon zest.

Easy and delicious. Makes you wonder why canned cranberry sauce became popular. I upped the orange zest and it tasts great.

Simple is best. I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and added a TBSP of cointreau to up the orange flavor. Addictive even by itself!

Sometimes simple just tastes better than more - definitely in the case of this recipe. For those watching their sugar intake, try cooking this with Splenda instead of sugar. I use about 1/4 cup of orange juice, and a small amount of cubed apples for interest.

Per a reviewer's suggestion, I changed this a little bit. I doubled the recipe, used 1 1/2 cups water and 1/2 cup OJ. Used 1 3/4 cups organic white sugar + 1/2 cup light brown sugar. Added a teaspoon or so of lemon zest with the orange zest. It was fantastic, perfect balance of sweet & tart. This is my family's new cranberry sauce for the holidays.

Excellent basic cranberry sauce recipe, and a good starting point for "add ons." I added the juice and pulp of the orange. It got raves at Thanksgiving dinner.

Excellent - I will never use canned cranberry sauce ever again!

I used half the recommended amount of sugar because I prefer a tart taste to a very sweet one. And I doubled the orange zest, and included the orange sections, spooned out of the zested shell like grapefruit. It was outstanding, and got rave reviews.

I think for a simple sauce, this is good, I enjoyed it. I have built upon the traditional base of this recipe for those who like the taste of a traditional sauce, but want to spruce it up a little without going all the way overboard. Replace 1 cup of water with: 1/4 cup cabernet/merlot 1/4 cup fresh orange juice 1/2+ cup of water This still equals out to 1 cup of liquid overall, like in the original recipe. Replace 1 cup of sugar with: 3/4 cup white sugar 1/4 cup light golden brown sugar This still adds up to 1 cup of sugar, like the original recipe. I also add just about a teaspoon of fresh lemon zest in addition to the orange zest. If you like your sauce on the sweeter side, just add an additional 1/8 a cup of white sugar. The cabernet, hint of brown sugar, and addition of lemon zest to the orange zest make this otherwise boring recipe, something to write home about!

A classic. Pure, simple, un-adulterated cranberry sauce. The only one I would ever think of making. We eat it on a wide variety of things from pancakes to pork, all year long!

Though simple, this is THE recipe for delicious cranberry sauce. I'd liken this recipe to the great apple pie recipe my wife makes, using apples sugar and nothing else. Everything else just gilds the lily, imho.

Not to be too cynical, but this identical recipe (sans orange) is on the recipe on the Ocean Spray bag, and has been for years. It is exactly what my mother made every Thanksgiving. It is a perfect plain cranberry sauce, to be gussied-up at will. I served it to my new love last night with BBQ chicken and he ate nearly all of it.

This was quick and easy, but I found it to taste alot like the canned whole cranberry sauce(which is not a bad thing!) I think nx time I'll open a can, but also try a cranberry sauce recipe that has some different ingredients for a alittle different taste.
