I just bought an ice cream maker, so I just made the sorbet. It was lovely, my friend thought so, too. I think the star anise complemented the pineapple beautifully. It is important that you use a very flavourful pineapple.

I have made this recipe several times, and all my guests raved. No one complained about the anise taste, admittedly quite sophisticated. I will try also with mint! It is particularly good with the roasted pineapple.

The star anise is overwhelming. Don't bother unless you really love the spice.
