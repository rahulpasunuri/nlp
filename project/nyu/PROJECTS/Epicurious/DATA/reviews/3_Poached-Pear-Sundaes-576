this was a nice recipe. very flexible. with interesting possibilities for variation. instead of shaving dark chocolate onto the recipe, we served it in dark chocolate coupes de dessert, laying in a layer of whipped cream, a pear, a scoop of ice cream, and topped it with a dollop of whipped cream and then drizzled it with chocolate syrup. it was delicious and very simple.
