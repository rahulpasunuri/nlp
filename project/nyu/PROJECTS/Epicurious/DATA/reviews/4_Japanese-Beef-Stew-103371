In a word, delicious, the dashi really brings out the savory character of this stew, which is exactly what it meant to do. Dashi may seem delicate, but its a flavor enhancer, the basis for umami character in many Japanese dishes. Instant dashi is widely available; just ask for it at your local Asian market. Whatever you do, dont substitute miso.

I have to say that this was a bit of a disappointment. I almost always follow the recipe to a T before I "improvise", but I wonder how this could be improved. The flavor was pallid and frankly, not worth the time invested in this. I will not make this again.

Didn't taste much different than your average American beef stew. Maybe this was because I couldn't find the dashi. Instead I used Aji Nori Furikake, which turns out is more of a topping than a soup mix.

We devoured this. Delicious. Didn't make the dashi, but used an instant seaweed soup mix instead (drained to use only the broth). When the liquid got low in the pot I added more sake instead of water. Also added turnips in addition to the potatoes and carrots. Definitely not enough liquid left at the end. It was really like a negamaki stew. YUM!

I'm currently living in Japan and have found it is much easier to just make meals using what's available. This stew was wonderful and so easy to make. The only thing I changed was to use negi instead of scallions in the broth. I also didn't need to cook it as long, about an hour. My husband loved it. We had an excellent Merlot with this dish and some great bread from Kobeya bakery.

Dashi and miso are not interchangable ingredients. The first is a delicate broth made from seaweed and dried fish; the latter is fermented soy bean paste.

NIce dish, I also had to use miso in place of the dashi. I picked up the minute miso in a bottle and it worked well. The flavors were interesting- nice and clean.

Am I missing something with this recipe? It is good, but it tastes like any other beef stew that I have eaten in my lifetime. The only substitution I made was using Miso soup instead of dashi, as other reviewers suggested. Again, the soup was good,eating it, watching the NE Patriots on the first cool NE day of the season, but certainly not 4 forks.

Just a warning. Don't do this in a crockpot. It loses the Japanese flavors and tastes like normal beef stew. It was good when I first put it together in the morning but not as good when I served it at night.

This was wonderful! I served it to three teenagers and one of them said, "This is amazing." I substituted packaged Miso soup for the dashi and also doubled the sauce as suggested by previous reviewers. I also cut the potatoes into quarters, not halves. It was really outstanding and will be added to our regular recipe rotation.

I made this as a triple recipe for a ski weekend for 12. I had trouble finding Dashi, even at a Asian food store so I used dried seaweed (removed after a few minutes of boiling it) and Miso soup mix (again triple, used 2 reg. and 1 low sodium.) Also to save time, I used canned potatoes as they are small and parboiled. So I just added them last (after rinsing them and cutting them in half when necessary.) All 12 moms loved it and wanted the recipe. I am making it again, this weekend for my family.

Loved the sauce- it does equal that from an authentic Japanese restaurant. I used a better cut of meat with no fat and found it dry- perhaps the larger chunks were too much. I will definitely make this again but make a better choice with the meat selection.

Totally delicious & I'm picky. I have made the recipe about four times now. Most recently I added some sherry and fresh ginger. Definitely double the sauce ingredients. Enjoy!

The great thing about this recipe is that it is so easy to personalize. I had hardly any of the ingredients listed, yet was able to substitute skirt for flank steak, onions for scallions, vermouth for sake, and Adobo for soy sauce. It still came out delicious.

Very interesting flavors and nice for a change. Found it a bit too sweet (and I like sweet stuff). I will cut back the sugar to 1 Tbl. next time - you can always add more...

Amazing!!

Goodness, it's good! The soup was marvelously flavorful even without sake and handled extra thinning with water very well. I followed novicechef1's advice to use 1 teaspoon of dashi with 1 cup of water, and left the scallion bulbs in after cooking--it would have been a pity to throw them out!---The reason I kept adding water (about two cups, gradually poured in at different stages) was because as soon as I caught a whiff of that heavenly scent, I knew I was going to want more than I prepared for!

YUM! we make this all the time. as soon as it gets cold my hubby starts requesting. get some good bread to soak up the delicious broth!

Absolutely awesome. Instead of potato I used turnips instead. I highly recommend turnips, but if you're not sure you like turnips, then go with potato. I really do love substituting with turnips though in this recipe and my finicky fiance loves it too. Turnips soak up the flavor so well.

Easy! Used Hon-Dashi bonito fish soup stock (like granular fish bullion)which can be found in a Japanese market in a box containing individual packets, and mixed 1 t in 1 C water. Steamed veggies in the same pot, potatoes only for first 3 min and threw the carrots on top for the remaining 7 min. Used precut and peeled baby carrots. Even though the dish contained potatoes, I served over rice to soak up all of the delicious sauce.

This was not only very delicious, but extremely easy and quick. I will definately make this on a regular basis! The only substitution I made was Miso Soup (which I had on hand) for the Dashi.

Loved it. A really nice change from the usual beef stew

I absolutely love this stew. I've made it using dashi prepared as instructed, as well as simply using broth made from packaged Japanese seaweed broth powder. Nobody could tell the difference in the finished product, and the latter method was much easier and less time consuming.

Pretty easy to make. And if you don't want to make your own daishi, just go to a Japanese food market and get any of the number of tempura or soba noodle bases. They're generally good, consistent, much less work, and probably even much less cost than buying your own bonito etc... Also, it's not horrible to just boil the potatoes and carrots regularly if you don't have the resources or desire to steam them.

Great recipe. Will definitely make again. Very easy to prepare.

While the stew tastes good, and flavored Japanese-style, this is far from the authentic Japanese dish using meat and potatoes (and sometimes carrots).

Now, as a professional chef I have tried and tried for those great authentic Japanese tastes and couldn't ever quite master it. Eventually I just took them off the menu altogether to be fair to my customers. Even though it was good, it wasnt't great and I felt that 'great' is all that I should be giving my customers. Now that I have made this it has become a great hit at all of my social functions as well as with my nine-year-old son and four-year-old daughter. With my confidence in my skills restored I was able to make all sorts of japanese dishes that are amazing. I even have a Japanese theme night in my restaurant now. And all because of Japanese Beef Stew...

I love this stew! I use 1 T. miso in water instead of the dashi. I found the meat a little tough and I may try the crock pot next time. The broth is good enough to drink!

THIS STEW IS VERY UNIQUELY DELICIOUS WITH A TRADITIONAL JAPANESE FLAVOR. I MADE IT FOR MY MOTHER WHO LOVED IT AND EVEN ASKED FOR THE RECIPE. (SHE'S JAPANESE)

Excellent, dense flavor -- different from traditional stews, but not in a bad way! We've already made this twice and will keep on making it. One suggestion is if you don't have dashi in the cupboard, substitute some prepared miso soup with some fish sauce (a thai condiment).

Even my partner who dislikes beef loved this recipe. I served it on a few occassions already and there are never any leftovers regardless of the number of diners. Delicious!

Excellent and easy to make recipe, with no fancy ingredients. I would offer only one suggestion about dashi stock based on my experience with it in Japan. The more "proper" way to make it, which provides for a better flavor, is to first vipe the conbu with a damp cloth and then place it in water and cook on medium heat for 10 minutes preventing it from boiling although making sure the sea weed is soft in the center when removed. Then add bonito flakes and bring to a boil. Immediately rmove from heat and let stand for a few minutes (do not stir). Then follow the rest of the recipe. Even a picky eater will enjoy the excellent flavor.

This is SO good, SO easy, and SO different, that I can't understand why it hasn't garnered many reviews! Try it!
