One more hint. To increase the sauce I added one cup of wine while reducing the shallots at the beginning. Then at the end, to avoid any curdling of the cream once adding lemon I took about 1/4 cup of the good white wine and added the lemon juice and stirred it in at the end quickly to avoid curdling. Wonderful finishing touch.

Wow! When we took our first bite we were silent. So good. I used sockeye salmon and placed on top of the bowl of pasta with the sauce and asparagus mixed in. It was lovely. I didn't want this to be so "fishy" with the smoked salmon. I also recommend straining the sauce to have a finished creamy sauce without the onion bits, more elegant. Super meal with a side salad and a white wine that can hold the cream and fish. Enjoy!

This is a delicious dish made with fresh salmon. I used one pound of salmon and broiled it with lemon olive oil and sea salt then topped it with smoked paprika.I broke up the salmon and tossed it with the pasta at the end. It's a keeper.

Yum -delicious sauce. Served it over lobster ravioli and it was wonderful. Only changes (other then the pasta) were to add the lemon zest at the end and to sautee a little garlic with the shallots.

The real star here is the pappardelle. I had some left over salmon from Sunday dinner and just flaked it apart and put it in the cream sauce before I pored the sauce over the pasta. Used 1 Tbsp. lemon juice only. Put two cloves crushed garlic to steep in the cream sauce. Great, easy dish. My kids loved it. YUM!

We had leftover smoked salmon from a holiday party so I made this for my man last night and it was so good. One thing, this amount of sauce is good for 1/2 to 3/4 pound pasta.

Rating: 3
As noted by other reviewers, there are some adjustments that need to be made here. There is not enough sauce, as the recipe is written, for a pound of pasta. So, added four oz. of white wine to reduce with the cream, and also a couple sloshes of pasta water to thin and spread it. Ended up covering about a half a pound of pasta. However, with only that much pasta, two whole shallots was overpowering. Ah, the delicate and wimpy shallot is not so wimpy after all, especially when minced super-fine in the mini processor! Also added two smallish cloves of garlic, which was good. Omitted the lemon juice to avoid the curdling problem others described, and zested two lemons into the sauce just before serving (think it's a bad idea as directed here, to add the zest and then reduce the cream, as zest, like fresh herbs, loses most of its flavor if cooked for more than moment). Roasted the asparagus to concentrate the flavor; also avoids all this faffing around with ice water baths and such. Be sure to cut up the asparagus before roasting; easier than trying to deal with it once it's hot out of the oven. Garnished with snipped chives. Ultimately, very good, lots of complex, delicate flavors, and not at all like "pasta in a bowl of warm milk" like another unfortunate reviewer commented. In fact, the guest of honor commented that he loved that it wasn't just pasta slathered with tons of cream.

Making this for a second time by popular demand for my 12 year olds and their friends. I use shrimp instead of salmon and there are never any leftovers.

Rating: 3
Very good. I used a salmon fillet, since that's what I had on hand and roasted it in the oven with the asparagus at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes (with a little olive oil and S&P). Next time I'll be sure to use smoked salmon and compare. It could have used a little extra something, maybe a few capers? But overall, very tasty and quite easy. Pretty too.

Rating: 4
I made this according to the recipe and it was fantastic! The mixture of the salmon, asparagus and lemon cream sauce was divine. My husband has requested that I make this for every special occasion for the rest of his life. Next time, I'm going to try grilling the asparagus rather than boiling it.

Rating: 3
Fabulous. I added fresh dill just before serving, and roasted the asparagus (with olive oil) instead of blanching it as one reviewer recommended. With dry white wine and really finely diced shallots, the sauce was excellent.

This was a disaster! The sauce curdled the first time I tried it. The second time it didnt curdle, but the end result was bland and generally yucky. It was like eating pasta and asparagus in a bowl of warm milk. I chose this because it had just a few ingredients I happened to have on hand, but it all ended up in the trash  the turkey sandwiches I made instead were good.

Rating: 3
I had mixed feelings about what rating to give this recipe, because as written, I don't think it's right. I doubled the sauce for 4 people and there still wasn't enough! I also preferred to roast the asparagus in the oven, and like other reviewers, put some white wine in the shallot reduction and sautéed the salmon with some red onion and lemon juice. The flavours are definitely outstanding, so I will make it again, using the doubled sauce quantity for 2 to 3 people at most. As tweaked, I think this would be a 4-fork recipe, but as written, probably 1 or 2. Still, learn from the experience of me and all the other reviewers and really up the quantities for the sauce and you've got a delicious and very Spring-y pasta dish.

Rating: 3
I doubled the amount of cream based on other reviews and that made enough sauce. On the other hand, this made it too rich for my husband and he was only so so on this recipe as a result, but I really enjoyed it. And it was very easy to make. I may try to produce a lower fat version instead.

This is a great recipe! This has become a favorite in our dinner rotation. I've subbed chicken and also made an all veggie version.

Quick and easy. I used whole wheat pasta which generally requires a stronger flavoring so I just intensified the flavor by adding more lemon and little bit of white wine. Definitely add smoked salmon at the very end so not to dry it. My husband loved it as left over.

Rating: 3
This is very nice! My meyer lemon tree is in season so I used one of those for the sauce along with some alaskan smoked salmon we received for Christmas(hot smoked, not cold smoked as indicated in the recipe). I used extra zest and juice and flaked the salmon in at the very end. Delicious.

Rating: 3
I love this recipe but I don't add the salmon until the last minute because I agree that it can become dry with more cooking. Vermouth and chives are also very good in this recipe. For a healthier week night recipe I use only 1/4 c cream, and 2 teaspoons olive oil instead of any butter.

Rating: 3
Served this for a dinner party and everyone adored it. Also used the local smoked salmon that I flaked rather than sliced like lox, and it was excellent. Substituted green peas for the asparagus, as my first course was asparagus soup. The only thing I would do differently is reduce the shallots by at least half. The flavor was good, but there were SO many that the textures of the sauce was just lumpy. If I'd had time, maybe I could have pureed it, but I think next time I just won't use so many, and make sure they're really finely diced and sauteed till really soft. It was an excellent combination of warm comfort food and fresh, Spring flavors for our typically cold nad damp Seattle March/April weather.

Rating: 4
This was a lovely recipe that was quick and easy to make. I did make some adjustments after reading the reviews. I added more lemon zest and juice. Instead of using pasta water, after sauting the shallots I added 1/3 cup white wine and brought to a boil. I then added the cream to the mixture. Lastly I used only 3/4 lb pasta. I finished the dish with a nice douse of grated parmesan. The salmon I used was a hard smoked Alaskan salmon, that really added a lovely flavor. This pasta presents well on the plates and tasted fantastic. I definitely will be making this again, and recommend it to all!

Rating: 3
I made this recipe as written. It was good. However, we have decided it would be better without the smoked salmon. We like smoked salmon, just not in this recipe. We will make the recipe again, omitting the smoked salmon and instead grilling salmon steaks or filets to serve with it.

I hesitate in adding yet another review to a recipe that already has more then enough entries, but I've made this 4 times now and still can't get enough of it. You've gotta love a recipe that has so few simple ingredients but rewards you with such wonderfully delicate flavors. I am lucky living in the Pacific NW with our selection of smoked salmon and fresh farmer's market asparagus but, regardless, it's just delightful. A definite keeper!

Rating: 3
Making it again tonight! Looks beautiful on the plate.Wonderful, light sauce even with the cream--a pleasant suprise. Good for warm summer days. Very easy. It really doesn't take long to make, but if I know I will be busy at dinner time, I blanch the asparagus and do the other prep work ahead of time. I put in a bit of white wine (no more than 1/2 c.) after the shallots and let it reduce a bit. I only use enough pasta for two (sometimes a bit more for leftovers) and don't need to add the pasta water. And I serve w/ fresh parm. Delicious!

Rating: 4
This is an outstanding meal, easy and light enough for every day, yet impressive enough for company. I use various green veggies and substitute white sauce for cream. Absolutely delicious! I must say I don't understand a common trend to change a recipe then rate it poorly. If you don't like a main ingredient, you won't like the end result, period. Alter according to personal taste of course, but poor flavour or results are not usually the fault of a tried and true recipe.

Rating: 3
This recipe was easy to prepare and delicious. Like many others, I also have a few changes. First, as I was making it for 2, I only cooked half the pasta but kept everything else the same. This meant I didn't need the pasta water. I added 1/2 cup plain cream cheese, some finely chopped dill and some finely chopped pimento. I also reduced the amount of lemon juice. I would start with 1 tablespoon and taste and add more if necessary.

If I had ordered this dish at a restaraunt I would not have been dissapointed. It was delicious and flavorful without being too heavy. I think the smoked salmon really makes this dish, so don't omit it. I also added a few peas, and next time I wont bother with asparagus at all because I think the peas were even better.

Oakland, I loved your simile to a bold painting. I easily made this with a few subsitutions on a Friday after a tiring week. Used only one lemon (all I had), onion instead of shallots and broccoli instead of asparagus. I was afraid my subsitutions would overwhelm the lemon and salmon, but I thought it tasted great. The lemon really came through. Had to use packaged, thinly sliced smoked wild salmon - the smokey flavor was dominant but we liked it.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe according to the directions, except that linguini was substituted for papparadelle. At first I was skeptical about the pasta water going in the sauce, but after seeing the small quantity of cream sauce it made sense. The resulting dish was unique - light, lemony, and refreshing (not an adjective usually used to describe pasta). It's not a traditional pasta dish in which ingredients blend together harmoniously; rather, it's like a modern painting with bold splashes of flavor. Three and a half stars.

This is excellent. If you are able to get smoked salmon from the Pacific Northwest (not the thin sliced lox in the deli section of most grocery stores), this becomes even more fantastic.

I discovered this recipe when I had to find something to do with some smoked salmon. It was fantastic! I didn't use aparagus and used bucatini. The sauce is delicate and lemony - a wonderful contrast with the smokey salmon. Thanks to all the readers and their suggestions on other variations. This definitely will be repeated in our house!

This recipe was wonderful the very first time I cooked it. I have cooked it many times and have made a few changes along the way. I have never made the dish with salmon, but use 2 lbs of shrimp instead. I doubled the asparagus. I use half-and-half instead of the "heavy" cream. I use PENNE instead of pappardelle. I add minced garlic and 1/2 cup parmes/roman/asiago to sauce when half-&-half added. I also add 1 tsp red pepper flakes. Folks rave how the dish is creamy but not "fat". "It never gets tooo heavy". 1- I have never used salmon; I use 2 lbs of shrimp

Rating: 1
I normally like asparagus but it contrasts too much with the other ingredients in this dish and there are also way too much shallots. I liked the flavor of the lemon cream sauce, although it was much thinner than I would prefer. I will probably continue to experiment with the lemon sauce as I think it is a nice compliment to seafood pasta dishes, but as is needs work.

I made this without the smoked salmon and used linguine instead of papardelle, creme fraiche instead of the regular cream, and added extra lemon juice, grated parmesan and parsley to garnish. A delicious spring-summer dish. But boiling the asparagus is silly - you end up chasing the bits with your slotted spoon. I think steaming would be simpler.

Rating: 2
This recipe was kind of strange. I made it as directed, but I just didn't think the flavors worked well together. The asparagus was too strong for the smoked salmon, and the salmon flavor really got lost. The lemon-cream sauce was quite good, and I might make that again. It would be great with a generous grating of Parmesan cheese.

Rating: 3
Nice lemony flavor. Made this a couple of times already and realized that sauteeing the salmon slightly with the onion (used red onion) and pouring some lemon juice, then setting it aside to proceed with the remaining steps, removes that "fishy" after-taste from the dish. I also added more than required lemon juice to suit my taste. Easy to prepare and very comforting dish.

Rating: 4
An excellent receipie!!Did it again next day!! I added one more TBSP of lemon juice and 1 1/2 TSP of lemon zest just to give it a lemoney "ting". I also added a salmon paste (process few slices + cream) to give it a creamy consistency. My husband loved the colorfulness of the dish...called it 'restaurant quality'.

I, too, used fettucine in place of pappardelle. But I also put 4 thin slices of smoked salmon with 3 tablespoons of cream and put them into a food processor to make a creamy paste mixture. Added this mixture into the cream, lemon, shallot sauce and simmered, stirring for about 8 min. Also added white wine in place of pasta water, and peas in place of asparagus. Doubling the sauce receipe depends upon how much sauce you like with your pasta. Recipe turned out just fine for me.

Pretty good. Would be great in a menu with bold flavors, for balance. I followed some of the advice of others- made 10oz of pasta but the whole recipe of sauce, doubled the salmon, skipped the pasta water and added 1/3C. white wine. I used hot-smoked salmon, I happen to have a lot of it. My kids liked it quite a bit, probably because of the subtle flavors.

This recipe is gorgeous, especially when a bit of garlic and white wine is added to the sauce. I would add that it does not make enough sauce to serve 4 people; should've doubled the recipe to avoid dryness. Still, a winner and great for parties.

This turned out delicious thanks to the different comments on this site. So I used farfalle, doubled the sauce, did not use the pasta boiling water and added a touch of wine. Wow! I just regreted not doubling the salmon; it was too scarced. I will be doing this again!

Rating: 2
Count this as a 2.5-fork rating; it's not that special, but it's still pretty good. As many other reviewers have mentioned, there's not much sauce. I found the consistency of the sauce to be just right (I used 1/2 c heavy cream + 1/2 c light cream) before adding the pasta water, which only made it runny and dilute. The sauce simply has to be increased, possibly doubled, but not thinned with water. The lemon doesn't mix that evenly (perhaps my zest was too long). Adding some white wine and other spices sounds like a good suggestion. I would strongly recommend steaming the asparagus for 2 minutes instead of boiling it for 3, and I would also add it just before serving instead of heating it further in the sauce. I would also suggest increasing the amount of asparagus, possibly to 1.5 lbs.

Rating: 4
A very nice dish. I elected to leave out the smoked salmon and instead used the pasta & sauce as a bed for almond-encrusted (fresh) salmon. Even without the salmon it would have been good. I agree with earlier comments that making more sauce than the recipe calls for is advisable.

I made this dish once and was very disappointed. It was very bland and too dry, even though I used less pasta than called for. If I try it again, I'll increase the amount of sauce I prepare and probably add some white wine and additional seasonings to it to give it more flavor. And, I would DEFINITELY substitute angel hair or thin linguine for the pappardelle, that pasta was so thick it quickly absorbed all of the sauce.

so, i made lots of changes to this recipe. i used 3/4 c. fat free sour cream and about 1/2 c. 1% milk to cut the tang a bit. i used spinach instead of asparagus. i like it in theory but i blanched the spinach leaves, and it turned out like defrosted frozen spinach--very soggy and clumpy. so i would suggest wilting it, lightly sauteeing it, or adding to the sauce directly. i simmered dill in the "cream" sauce. nice touch, but cut back on the lemon in that case. if you use smoked salmon, don't add any additional salt. a pinch with the shallots, but that's really enough. i used lemon-pepper fettucini; was worried it would be too overpowering, but nice touch. next time, i might toss the salmon into the pasta when serving; it "cooks" too much otherwise.

This recipe was a great base. Being a chef I find most recipes dont have enough flavour. To this recipe I added onions, garlic, mushrooms, white wine, freah black pepper, fresh thyme, rosemary, parsley, basil and some fresh parm cheese at the end. I sauteed the salmon with some fresh black pepper and served it on top of the pasta with some freash lemon rind, parm cheese and thyme. This flavourful variation was a huge success with my family and customers. Try this variation and I promise your taste buds will not be dissapionted.

Am I the only one who didn't like this recipe? I thought it was a mistake to cook the smoked salmon. It took away the whole flavor! I also added a grilled salmon fillet.

This has become a staple "company dish" in our home and we've never been disappointed.

I serve the fillet on a bed of pasta w/sauce and asparagus, and teh crowd goes wild.

The crowd roared! I doubled the recipe for five generous servings. My guests would have licked the bowls if they could: they all raved about it. Everyone asked for more -- it was fabulous. Even I was pleased. I used one pepper-crusted salmon filet just to add some interest and texture, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing. One caution: I'm a pretty efficient cook, and this took me more than 45 minutes (worth it!). This is the best recipe I have ever cooked from this site or the magazines back to 1991.

A great summer dish. We had some smoked salmon given to us for Christmas and needed to use it ASAP. Considering it's summer in Australia, we thought we would give the recipe a try and were not disappointed. It went down well with an Aussie Semillon. Two tips: taste the sauce and adjust by adding extra lemon zest or juice (if desired) and some more cracked pepper while tossing the pasta. A great, refreshing outdoor summer lunch dish.

I made a lower-fat version of this dish by using only the 1 T of butter and substituting fat-free 1/2-n-1/2 for the cream.

This was very tasty, and a perfect light early summer dish. A note to the cook who wondered how to make this lower in calories: I realized with horror in the midst of cooking that I only had 1 tbsp. of butter instead of the 3 called for.
