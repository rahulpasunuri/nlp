This bread is quite tasty, but the dough is the strangest bread dough I've ever encountered. The dough was REALLY stiff, and no matter what I tried, it would not cling to my Kithchenaid dough hook. I added a quarter cup more of water and kneaded by hand, which was quite a work out. I should have added the flour more gradually, I think, and stopped short of the total amount called for. I rose the bread in an oven that I had heated to 170 degrees (my oven's lowest setting) and then turned off. The first rising took about an hour and 45 min., and the second took about an hour and 15. I did not have bread flour, so the final product spread more than it rose, and my loaves ended up being only 2 1/2 - 3 inches tall. I was really worried when I could barely force a serrated knife through the bread. But to my surprise, while it was dense, it was quite edible, and as I said, very tasty.

This bread came out beautifully and is a nice change from a usual loaf. I followed the recipe (which Is unusual for me) and it rose nicely and baked up well. I don't think it needed the full amount of time in my the oven. It has a lovely chewiness, a bit of sweetness and goes beautifully with many cheeses.

As someone new to baking bread, I was a bit leery of trying this. It was only my fourth loaf. But I was very pleased with the results. It did take some time to rise, but I used a warm oven and it worked well. I like a dense loaf with a good crust, so this did not disappoint. I also made a few changes. I used dates instead of figs and anise seeds instead of fennel. After fifteen minutes in the oven, my mouth was watering. The bread was absolutely delicious served warm. My wife and children ate most of it when they got up the next day.

This bread is fantastic. Thick and chewy but not overly dense. Incredibly flavorful. I followed directions exactly, but mixed calymyrna and black mission figs. Makes no diff what type of figs you use. Chop them quite small (slightly less than 1/4 inch dice, then mix the first half in a tbsp of the flour mix before adding to mix so they don't clump together so much. Add second half gradually as knead and spread out by hand. Used scant two tbsps fennel (but I love fennel and it was still plenty strong). Before getting started, turned my oven on to lowest setting, then turned it off once it had reached temp and let it cool a bit. Then did first rise in the slightly warm oven. The dough seemed to have risen sufficiently after two hours. The second rise took much less time. I put it in the cold oven, just to prevent drafts, and came back after three hours to huge loaves. Baked for 35 minutes. Turned out great, but probably didn't need to leave so long for second rise.

This recipe has real potential and a tasty flavor profile, but the directions make me wonder if they bothered to test it before publishing it. I equated that to a "two fork" rating- inspirational, not accurate. I prepared this bread with the following 5 (!) modifications: -You need *at least* 1/2 cup more water to make this dough -The texture is greatly improved by a touch of olive oil -As per the other comments, I let it rise overnight in the refrigerator -I also lengthened the second rise period to about an hour -Finally, you should keep it in the oven for only a little over 30 min. That being said, I totally scarfed two thirds of a loaf because IT WAS THAT GOOD. I'm a sucker for the sweet/salty combo.

Great, simple recipe. I substituted Black Mission figs, and dosed them with boiling water first to soften them a bit. That made the first batch added kind of blend more into the bread, while the second batch is in nice, soft, satisfying chunks. Also took others advice and did scant tablespoons for the fennel, which was perfect. Great recipe!

Fantastic! To address the heaviness that some reviewers have commented on, I did this bread as a "no knead" version. I increased the water to 2 cups, added the fennel seed to the water along with the yeast, then mixed in 4 cups of all purpose flour, salt and all the figs. (I used my kitchenaid mixer). I covered the bowl and let the dough rise overnight until it was just starting to collapse. I then shaped 2 baguettes (roughly, without kneading) onto a lightly oiled baking sheet and let them rise again until well-risen,and baked them. The texture was light, and the crust was crispy. I think a bit of coarse salt on the top would be nice. I'll make this frequently for my cheese tray!!

This bread was good. Ever since I moved from NYC I've been craving Amy's raisin fennel semolina rolls and trying to recreate them. I used golden raisins instead of figs. Made this a couple of times and found it best when I let the dough proof for 3 hrs, punched it down, let it rise overnight in the fridge and then another 6 hrs out of the fridge before I baked it. IT makes it much less dense.

i like to halve the fennel and add walnuts, i find that it does take longer to rise than my other breads, but with a little patience I get about the same loft.

This bread was amazing! I used only 1 T of fennel and substituted whole wheat flour for the rye flour. Since I starting making it late, I proofed the shaped loaves in the fridge overnight. It came out great.

I took the previous comments to heart and I made this bread for the first rise the night before. So, it had really "riiz" by the time I got up in the morning. I gave it plenty of time for the second rise. I had no trouble incorporating the fig. I put half in for the first kneading and really kneaded the bread with the rest of the figs in the second kneading. I cut down on the fennel by 1/2 and I think it's better that way. I also put the tray of hot water in the oven during baking and came up with a hard crust. So my thanks to everyone who came before. And, yes, it's not very high but I don't think it's supposed to be. And, I would make it again and will probably make it again for my next party.

The recipe doesn't seem to picky: used general purpose flour instead of bread flour, upped the rye to account for half the flour, and substituted anise for fennel. A good break from more conventional recipes. A fun bread to make and eat!

This bread was delicious with fresh goat cheese and a little prosciutto. The sweetness of the figs and the cheese really go well with the prosciutto's saltiness.

I love this with chevre but it's also pretty darn good plain - my boss couldn't stop eating it! I didn't have any problem with it rising, but it was quite dense as others reported. After reading other reviews, I decided to use "scant" tablespoons of fennel seeds; I think that was the right decision. I used my kitchen shears to snip the figs, but I think next time I will snip them smaller. I was looking forward to the "fig smears" one reviewer described, but I just got chunks. Not that I'm complaining... I didn't have any problems with the figs on the outside burning, which I was sort of sad about, since I LOVE burned figs! (Really) Still, I'll be making this again. It's very impressive - sounds a LOT harder than it is.

This bread is tasty and would be great to serve at a dinner party with a tray of chesses. I used whole wheat flour because I couldn't find rye (I checked three NYC grocery stores!) The dough didn't rise very much, but it turned out great. Not an every day bread, but great for a special occasion

I made this to use up some dried figs that I bought for another recipe. I adjusted the amounts of all the ingredients so that I would have 3 cups of flour (total) and I made it in my breadmaker. I ended up having to add some extra water, because the mix seemed a bit dry. The figs didn't mix in very well - they were sticky and ended up getting smashed. I briefly took the dough out and mixed it by hand for a moment, but it still was not mixed perfectly. It turned out pretty good, though. It was rather dense; it did rise, but not as much as some other breads I've made in the machine. When I cut it, there were swirls of fig puree throughout the bread (and a few pieces here and there, too). That was kind of cool. I just ate some with a little bit of cream cheese and it is very tasty. I love fennel, so I don't think it is too much. It is a very crusty, chewy bread. I'm sure the presentation would be better if it was made by hand, but I was doing other things and not in the mood today. I will definitely be eating this for breakfast for several days! Very good - I'll probably make it again.

I made this on a whim Christmas eve, I had figs but no rye. Instead, I used bread flour and added a bit of unsulfured molasses. The bread turned out beautifully and was very moist. Lots of flavor!

what a great change! the fennel is strong, and you have to be careful not to pulvarize the figs, but it's really great! the dough didn't rise a ton... it was pretty dense. but the crumb of the final bread was chewy and fantastic!

This bread is delicious. It does take a while to rise, longer than the recipe says. I had to coax it by warming the oven, and letting the bread rise in there. It's great!!!

Very good. I didn't have any problems with the figs on the outside of the bread, but I cheated and used a bread maker (sweet bread cycle, add figs about 1/2 hour after the start time when the machine beeps). This bread was lighter in color and flavor than I had anticipated, even if you don't like rye or fennel you might like this - the figs impart sweetness. This was excellent served with a mild soft white cheese, I used one similar to Muenster.

This bread tasted delicious. My only problem--the fig pieces that ended up on the outside of the bread burned. I scraped them off, and the bread was still very good, but how does one avoid that? Also, I am curious: does anyone know why the figs can't be added all at once? It seems they'd be better incorporated that way.

It was very tasty, but it also took a long time to rise (and still didn't rise very much). It was pretty dense. But the flavor was excellent! Maybe some oil will help out, I don't know.

WONDERFUL! I served it with herb infused olive oil, gouda, and swiss cheese. YUM. My dough didn't rise either, but it still tasted great.

Yummy!!! Like one of the last reviews, this bread a very strong fennel flavor. For others, I might use less or no fennel but I thought it was delicious-- Just toasted and buttered a few slices for breakfast but I can't wait to go buy some goat cheese! This was my very first attempt at making bread and now I'm hooked. Only modification I made to this recipe was to place another baking pan on the bottom shelf while preheating the oven. Added a cup of hot water to the extra pan when I put in the loaves (read this in a book). It made the crust extraordinary!!

This bread is definitely a favorite and will be a staple: I plan to keep it stocked in my freezer. I gave a loaf to a friend, who had some with his dinner; then he said it "called to him" at 2 am, so he had some more, and finished the rest with breakfast. Also the recipe worked perfectly and easily. I wouldn't change a thing, except to watch the baking time. Start checking at 35 minutes. The bread is great with a cheese course.

Made this bread as soon as it appeared in BA. It is *quite* fennely -- I think I might reduce the amount of fennel seed or merely steep them in the liquid ahead of time. Also, my bread took ALL DAY to rise, but that may be a local phenomenon. Nonetheless a delicicous bread, especially with a nice cheese.
