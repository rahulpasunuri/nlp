Girardet IS a Master of French Cuisine and has been regarded as one of the worlds greatest chefs, if not THE greatest. This soup is simply quite superb. Reading these reviews from Americans like mariahfromBoston and tmfun is no surprise at all. Ignorance is bliss. You people should stick to McDonalds or KFC with which I am sure you will be much more comfortable. Leave the cooking and reviews to those who know about great food. Thank you.

I made quite a few changes to this dish, used frozen organic broccoli, regular sliced mushrooms sauteed with butter and onion about 1/2 onion. I added about 1/3 cup of dry white wine to chicken stock, used light cream instead of whipping cream and pureed the broccoli,stock and the sauteed mushrooms and onions. Did not strain. added freshly grated romano cheese before serving. Nice dish on a cold, rainy day!

This is a simple, delicious cream soup which can be made in about ten minutes.

My wife put it best. "This is good diet food, it's so bad that even if you are hungry, you won't go back for seconds." My take is, what a waste of good mushrooms.
