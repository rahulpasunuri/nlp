Used huckleberries exactly as written and was told by guests, "best desert ever." It is truly amazing.

I made it for a lime lover's birthday and she loved it. Everyone else did too, including the non lime lover. I added some almonds to the crust as suggested by others and made the compote with blueberries (never saw huckleberries here) and omitted the coulis.

Made this delicious pie for our annual July 4th party. Was an absolute hit, got rave reviews, and was the first pie to go! Used frozen wild blueberries and papaya puree as I couldn't find passion fruit puree anywhere in town. Would definitely make again, but would decrease sugar all around just slightly.

I thought the filling was just okay, but the compote and coulis are amazing. I made the coulis from passionfruit from our garden, and it knocked people over. Saved the extra for ice cream topping.

This was excellent. The coulis and compote are very sweet, I would consider cutting the sugar a bit next time. I added a little extra salt and ground almonds and pistachios to the crust which was fantastic. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he thought it was amazing as well as all the guests, and the coulis and compote make for a great presentation. Another note is I used blackberries for the compote and papaya for the coulis because it was all I could find, but I expect that those are all pretty exchangeable.

Absolutely the best Key Lime Pie I have eaten/made. Have made it several times and always receive rave reviews.

This pie was wonderful, and I'm not a huge key lime pie fan. I didn't mess w/ the vanilla bean in the compote and cut the sugar to about 3T, plus a few tbs of fresh lemon juice to brighten the berries. I couldn't find the passion fruit puree so I used frozen passion fruit juice concentrate that I reduced down. I'm not sure how much it added to the dish, but made the presentation more dramatic.

Excellent recipe. Last time I made it I used wild blackberries we have at www.nwwildfoods.com and it was amazing.

I made this pie for a party. It came together so quickly I made a second one at the last minute 'just- in-case'. The Couli was delicious, I reduced it a bit too long and it had a bit of a caramel flavor to it, but was still good. I used wild blueberries for the compote and that was also good. My only change was with the crust... I used an Almond crust from another key-lime recipe on this site. Everyone loved the pie, even non- keylime eaters (they don't like it to be too tart, this one is not) But I did get the most comments on the crust.

Very good and easy to make, although the recipe did not make quite enough filling to fill the pie crust. I skipped the compote, but the passion fruit coulis was delicious.

This pie came together so easily and baked so perfectly that I was pleasently surprised! I could not find the passionfruit puree for the coulis so I substituted a blackberry version and it was very tasty. I did cheat a little and used bottled key lime juice instead of fresh. I also put some dried cherries into the blueberry compote as it cooked;it added a nice chewy texture. I will be making this again.

I've made this several times and it is delicious as well as gorgeous. I reduced some blueberry sauce from the freezer, which was from a similar recipe but included a bit of lemon juice. I've used both key limes and regular limes. I don't think the key limes are worth the effort. I substitued vanilla extract, since I don't think you can really taste the difference here.

Could not for the life of me get this pie to set properly. Not sure what went wrong, but it was a big hot mess.

This recipe is very easy. The only time consuming part is squeezing the juice from the key lime. Pressing the key limes on the countertop helps, as well as extracting the juices with a fork. Skipped the passion fruit coulis, but the pie was simply delicious.

Wonderful. I made the coulis with frozen wild blueberries and frozen cherries. It was delightful.

This was a great key lime pie recipe, although I did modify it a bit. I used regular lime juice and added a teaspoon of lime zest. I made the passion fruit coulis with Goya brand passion fruit puree, but skipped the vanilla bean. I didn't bother with the berry compote, maybe next time I will try it. Overall, a very good and simple key lime pie recipe.
