The first time I made this I spent about 2 hours shucking oysters (had never done it before) and only 20 minutes making the actual pan roast. However, it was delicious and I have made it several times since then. The last two times I have played with the recipe and found that adding some linguisa and some fresh corn off the cob add delicious texture and taste. Also have made this with shrimp, clams, & mussels if you don't feel like shucking oysters all night.

Easy and well balanced. This is an easy to prepare, yet elegant recipe that is tasty while allowing the oyster flavor to come through. Use all the oyster liquor you can, but be careful to strain the liquor through a fine mesh or cloth. Crusty baguette is a good substitute if you do not have the time or inclination to make croutons.

Gosh, always thought I loved oysters but this recipe is death by mollusks. Felt like we were eating space aliens or something. Husband finished his portion and seemed to enjoy it, but then again he'll eat just about anything. Flavor was very bland, and not in a good way.

Absolutely delicious. Much better than the list of ingredients would lead you to believe, even though I substituted skim milk and canned milk to get the fat content down. It couldn't have been better.

Excellent! I did use the FF 1/2 & 1/2.

Delicious. I plan to make it often. Just the right combination of flavors. And the croutons are perfect.

Wonderful - I have now made this twice. The second time, I finished it with sherry, as someone suggested below, and that added just the right hint of complexity to what is basically a very simple, but delicious, dish. Make sure the oysters are well enough cooked before you take the pan off the fire: the edges should be just starting to curl up.

Since I am the only one in the family that will eat oysters, I am continually on the watch for new ways to prepare them in hopes the rest of the family will indulge. Unfortunately for them, they snubbed this too. However, as for me, this recipe was a fantastic change from typical oyster stew (milk & oysters). I will make this for myself again and again. I followed the recipe exactly (but reduced it by half and did not use the croutons) and had a wonderful lunch, with provolone and gouda cheese, crackers and fresh fruit.

Terrific! Flavorful, but the tomatoes, shallots, and seasonings did not overpower the oysters. I used very large Louisiana oysters, pre-shucked and water-packed, so I substituted white wine for the liquor and added additional salt. Thanks to the review on the croutons: I used chunks of sourdough bread instead. I also used a double boiler to ensure the oysters were not overcooked. (Too bad many folks won't know that a pan roast doesn't involve roasting - it's a fabulous stew that's very easy to prepare!)

It's very easy to make and so good on a cold day. We used FF 1/2 and 1/2 and added 2 tsp. sherry at the end -- enough to brighten the flavor, but not overpower it. We also used 3 Tbsp. flour to thicken it better. The oil on the croutons did not work with the flavor of the soup, so we will make them plain next time -- and it will be soon.

Since I was looking for a lower fat, easy way to prepare oysters, I did the following: I used preshucked Pacific oysters (extra smalls or yearlings) and I used fat free half and half and olive oil instead of butter. I've made it 3 times now and half the recipe makes a great simple supper for two.
