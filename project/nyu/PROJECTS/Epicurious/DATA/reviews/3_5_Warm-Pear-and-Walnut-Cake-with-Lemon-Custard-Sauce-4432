Love the cake, no more fussy than a layer cake... Love the Lemon custard sauce. Still we all found that the lemon custard sauce on the cake masks the more delicate caramelized pear flavors. Next time, I am going to do a little whipped cream with it instead.

I made the cake and the topping; I did not make the sauce. Instead I served the cake with fennel ice cream. the cake was one of several dessert options, and it was the biggest hit of the party.

The cake was delicious and easy to make. I actually liked the cake better than the sauce, and will probably skip the sauce next time.

This recipe is outstanding! I have made it many times and it is a winner. The lemon custard sauce puts it over the top.

Although this is time-consumming, it is well worth the effort. My standard cake of choice! Often double the lemon custard - so yummy.

The lemon-custard sauce was good, the Cake was not. I spent a long time in the Kitchen making this cake. It just wasn't worth the time and effort.

What can be said about this recipe? It is now not expected at my house, it is demanded! Works well with apples. Truely an excellent dessert!
