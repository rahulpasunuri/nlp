Eh. I'm not sure what the fuss is about. This has a lot of intense flavors, but they don't add up to much. I love basil, blue cheese, pine nuts and can put them to much better use in other recipes,

Okay, this is how I made it: Same ingredients, but slightly different order and quantities. Thanks to all whose ideas I stole! Before any other sautéing, toast pine nuts in large skillet. Remove them & sautée garlic & prosciutto in 1T of s-d tomato oil in the same pan. Add s-d tomato (small dice) and chicken (I used thin-sliced breasts cut in 1 strips) to brown w/ a little more olive oil, then add broth (1 cup) and white wine (1/2 cup) to simmer for three minutes or till chicken is just done. Meanwhile, blanch 2 cups (?) broccoli in the to-be-used-for-pasta/gnocchi water/pot. When the chickens done, stir in the basil, cheese & broccoli till heated/melted. Next time I would use more cheese; you could hardly taste the blue-ness and the sauce would be even better a little thicker. Ive avoided gnocchi for years, always finding it heavy & tasteless. But this seemed like a good recipe for it, so I gave it another try, and it was delicious! And perfect for this recipe.

Have been making this for years with a few modifications. I use dry sun-dried tomatoes, chopped and soaked in good olive oil for about an hour. I find the pre-packed to mushy. I also have the prosciutto cut thicker than usual and then I cut it into small strips. Fry them in almost smoking olive oil for about a minute. Yummy.

Fabulous! Easy and different- I agree-it would not be good with feta-if you don't like blue cheese, leave it out completely and just add parmesan at the end.

Loved this recipe! My boyfriend and I never cook and we tried it out.. super easy and while we were waiting for pasta to boil and the nuts to toast we made little bruchetta's with french bread, olive oil, priscutto, arugala and gorgonzola - OMG!!! SOOOO GOOD - we could have just eaten that for dinner. The pasta was great, could have used less pasta and more dressing.. I suggest adding arugula (so good!) and sprinkling gorgonzola on top of the pasta as well. YUM!

Despite my impatience with others who completely change a recipe and then review it, that's exactly what I'm going to do. I didn't use prosciutto at all, sauteed about a pound of broccoli after the chicken, and used feta instead of gorgonzola. It was delish!

This was great! My husband went back for thirds! I used half wine, half chicken broth and cut the chicken into small pieces before I cooked it, also sauteed the prosciutto with the garlic before adding the tomatoes and chicken, then added the basil and gorgonzola at the last minute--delicious!

This was delcious! I didn't have the gorgonzola, so I added a bit a shredded gouda and parmesean cheese, and it was delicious. I didn't have the prosciutto either, but I just omited it and added more broth, and it was fantastic!! We made it with gnocchi, but I bet it would be great with fettucine or penne also. Next time I might add a dollop of cream??

Wow. This is even better the next day. I have made this recipe twice: once with pasta and the second with gnocchi. Have to say, I prefer it with the gnocchi. Those little pillows of softness really soak up the flavors well. I used the variation of 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup white wine. I'm a huge gorgonzola/blue cheese lover, so I found it hard NOT to put more than a 1/2 cup of crumbled cheese, but I was good and restrained. I think if you add too much cheese, it will overwhelm the other ingredient's flavor, which you don't want to miss out on. I agree that if you can crisp up the proscuitto a bit before adding, that would add a smokey touch! Delicious.

Lovely meal made as directed, exceot I did not have broth! I used wine instead and it worked perfectly. The only thing I might do diffenrently is saute the prociutto before the garlic to give it a little texture.

Great recipe! Everyone loved it and I would definitely make it again. It took me about 30 minutes from start to finish, so I would use this as a weeknight meal again. A couple things I did: I drained and lightly rinsed the sun-dried tomatoes and chopped the chicken prior to cooking it. I used shell pasta and also threw in some broccoli at the end (blanched it for 2 minutes in the pasta water before cooking the pasta, then took it out and added it after I added the sauce to the pasta). Yummy!

I made this last night, following the recipe to the letter. It was so deliciously good!!!! My fiance, who doesn't like blue cheese, was very complimentary of the gorgonzola cream sauce. I paired it with a simple salad. This is definately on my monthly menu now. (And I can't wait for lunch today to have some of the leftovers!)

oh come on, who doesnt like this? i think i dont like people who dont like salt, just as a matter of policy. i mean, it isnt health food for sure, but it's delicious. only changes were i made just a half pound of pasta (bow ties) and one chicken breast for two of us, but all the sauce. and added a little extra chicken broth. i think a lot depends on the quality of the blue cheese you use  get the best you can find.

After the rave reviews, I was disappointed with this recipe. It wasn't bad, but by no means company worthy. It was simple enough that I may try it again, but if I do, I will leave out the prosciutto.

This IS really good. Like the others, I added about one-third cup cream and a quarter cup of wine with the chicken broth, but left out the proscuto (don't care for it). As with most of my pasta sauces, I add the basil just before serving. It is so delicate that it just loses it flavour when cooked. I'd make this again in a heartbeat!

This was a great quick weekday dinner. It used ingredients I had at hand (I used parmesan, omitted the ham) and we thought it was quite good. The wine is a must, I would say. For 2 people, I used the ingredients as listed, but with 1/2 cup broth and 1/4 cup wine, letting it boil a bit. So for 4 people, I would at least double the sauce. Didn't add the cream as some have suggested and it was a nice, light sauce. I used mini penne as I don't care for gnocchi and it was just fine. Will make again, I'm sure. Sorry I didn't end up with leftovers.

My house smells amazing after cooking this! I prepared it exactly as is. The flavors compliment each other very nicely. The gorgonzola is not overpowering, but gives it a nice "bite" that is balanced out well by the smokiness of the prosciutto and the tangy sun-dried tomatoes. I prepared it with gnocchi, and the topping was in perfect proportion to the pasta. Very good!

Man oh MAN this is good! I've made it the way it is listed, but I must say, using 1/2 cup whipping cream and 1/4 cup chicken broth puts it over the top.

I crave this stuff!

Everyone says that the amount of pasta is too much, but it isn't if you use FRESH gnocchi, not dried pasta.

I made this with chcken- style seitan and no proscuitto because I'm vegetarian. I couldn't find any good gorgonzola cheese so I used feta. The seitan needed to be sauted longer in it's packaged broth. Seitan often comes with approx. 1 cup broth. I used 1/2 cup for the chicken broth. I agree that it could have used 1/4 cup of white wine. Otherwise this was quick and tasty.

I made this last night for dinner and thought it was an easy, quick and very tasty dish. I did make a few changes after reading the reviews and also because of what I had in my pantry. First I doubled the cheese, as many reviews advised. They were spot on. I also used 1/4 cup white wine plus 1/4 cup chicken broth, instead of the full 1/2 cup broth called for in the recipe. And heading to my freezer and finding no chicken breast, as I thought I had, I used medium size shrimp. It turned out delish. I will not hesitate to make this again as it was a lovely weeknight meal served with a salad. I highly recommend it to everyone.

This is by far one of the best pasta recipes I have ever made. I substituted smoked Gouda for the Gorgonzola which added a nice touch and also added just a pinch of red pepper flakes for kick. I made this for a large family gathering and my very hard-to-please family LOVED every last bite of it.

This was okay, not as good as I expected given the reviews. I added white wine and extra gorgonzola, which helped. One pound of noodles (I used penne) was too much. I guess I had hoped for a creamier, richer sauce that really clung to the pasta. If I try the recipe again, I'll modify it.

This is a good weeknight meal. You can make the entire sauce in the time it takes to cook the pasta.

This pasta dish is sooo tasty! The broth and cheese make a yummy creamy sauce and adding pine nuts(which I roasted w/ a bit of garlic and olive oil) and Italian parsley(instead of basil) amped up the flavor even more.

This recipe is PACKED with flavor!! I have made it 3 times in 3 weeks, making it different each time. If you'd like to try something different, try sweet Italian Sausage (with fennel, boiled and then chopped up but remove fennel) and shrimp in place of the chicken and proscuito. I also added a tad more cheese and added some half and half (or cream) to make it a cream sauce (not alot though, just enough to coat). And also used spinach gnocchi in place of regular - adds more depth of flavor. (store bought spinach gnocchi can be found at World Market if there's one near you...) delicious! this goes in the keeper cookbook!

Ingredients, ingredients, ingredients. Curious isn't it, the drastic contrast in these love/hate responses? First of all, by no means are all sundride tomatoes created equal. Taste yours before you use them. It's absurd just how bad some can be. Also the quality of things labelled "gorgonzola" in this country, may have nothing in common with the traditional thing originally made in traditional ways, and first imported here, as there are not the strict guidelines inforced in Europe. Like that domesticly produced ham they call "prosciutto" and sell @ your local American supermarket: taste it side-by-side with the real thing produced in Parma or San Danelle and you'll see what I mean. And pinenuts can go rancid in a heart-beat, if stored improperly. With this kind of dish, as with most "Italian" cooking - it's all about the subtle qualities of the ingredients.

This is one of my favorites! I, too, use a roasted chicken from the grocery store because it is fast and has lots of flavor.

I would give this a double yuckie on a scale from yuckie to delicious. Even worst - I made it while my Mother and Father-in-law were visiting. However, we did have some good laughs after dinner. Now when my children misbehave, I can threaten them with the "Gorgonzola recipe".

Rating: 1
Yuck! I love anything with these ingredients, but together they were dang close to disgusting. I followed the recipe, and read the comments thus increasing the sauce. I am a big fan of blue cheese of any type and used high quality ingredients, but the cheese overwhelmed every other flavor. Basil is beautiful and the fresh leaves at the end of summer are so special, but the flavor was lost, as was the tang of proscuitto. And the sweetness of sun-dried tomatoes was overwhelmed. Even the majesty of garlic was lost here. I haven?t a clue why this one gets such high ratings. It does not work.

Very good recipe and great to throw together quickly. I also added a bit of cream to thicken the sauce slightly. I also added a few baby peas for a touch of sweetness. I will make again.

One of my families all time favorites, and one of few recipes I consider a "4 forks". I can't say I follow measurements closely, but any way you make it, the flavors blend wonderfully. Even my picky 11 year old eats this one!

I took the other reviewers suggestions and added creme and doubled the cheese and chicken broth. This tasted excellent - everyone that had it enjoyed it. I will definitely make again...

My only recommendation to this dish is that you use the absolute best quality Gorgonzola you can find. The first time I made it, I used a store brand cheese, and it was quite bland. The second time I used a much better quality (pricier) cheese and it really made a difference. I also doubled the sauce the second time, as the amount of sauce is not enough for an entire pound of pasta.

Rating: 3
Loved it! Definitely double the sauce for a lb of pasta. I used sherry to deglaze the pan and also a cup of whipping cream. Pretty yummy but then what isn't with sun dried tomatoes? I also prepard it with substitutions of parmesan and walnuts, which worked very well in my estimation. Guests loved it.

Far too salty, even with low salt broth.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I made it for company and they raved about it. My husband is not a big pasta fan but he loved it also. I took the suggestions and doubled the broth, sun-dried tomato, and cheese. I also added cream at the very end which made a thicker creamy sauce and served it on penne pasta.

I used homemade gnocchi using Yukon gold and putting them through the grating blade of my food processor 3 times instead of a ricer. I used Danish blue for cheese. I added the basil after removing from heat.

After the first bite, my husband raved about it. A little cream to the sause would be a nice touch. Very little work for a such a tasty dish. Next time I think I will throw in some peas to make the meal complete. Keeper

This was really good and really easy and really fast!!! I used stilton instead of gogonzolla because that is what I had on hand. Yum, Yum,....I also used a broasted chicken that I took the meat off. I didn't have to cook a thing but the pasta!!!.

We doubled the "sauce" ingredients and added 1/2 cup of half and half. We grilled chicken tenders and basted them in tomato oil Next time we would double the pine nuts. Served this with asparagus that had been brushed with olive oil and kosher salt, then grilled. Great!

Great quick recipe. We used left over chicken from a roasted chicken. We added 1/4 cup wine and evaporated with chicken, then added 3/4cup broth and 1/2 cup cream to the usual ingredients but left out sundried tomatoes. Next time I will reserve a little crumbled gorgonzola to mix in at the end for more flavor.

Rating: 2
Good, but not as creamy as I was expecting. Sauce seems to disappear on reheating. For the amount of cheese one is sinning with here, I would expect more return in the taste dept. But it's easy and good, so I might make it again if in a pinch.

I know this one is popular, but it was just so-so for me. If I were to make it again, which I probably won't, I would double the basil, gorgonzola and sun-dried tomatoes, and leave the chicken in larger pieces. One upside to this dish is that it does make a fairly nice presentation.

Rating: 3
I really love this delightful recipe for both the ease of preparation and the flavors. I've made it for some pretty discerning crowds without a single complaint. One thing: I use perhaps 1.5 times the oil and gorgonzola called for in the recipe.

I didn't have gorgonzola, so used a Danish Blue. It was still excellent and got rave reviews.

I made this for a dinner party last night. It was exceptional. I definitely recomend adding the additional wine and cream. I also doubled the cheese and basil. The guests really enjoyed this one. My husband couldn't get enough. Beware, this is a salty recipe. The low sodium chicken broth is a must.

Rating: 3
Delicious! This took next-to no time to put together, and it was tasty and warming on a cold night. Substitutions: My sun-dried tomatoes weren't packed in oil, so I subbed in 1 tablespoon of olive oil. That was plenty oil for the whole dish. I also used Healthy Choice smoked ham instead of prosciutto and blue cheese instead of gorgonzola. It was still good. I think next time I will use a whole cup of broth for some more sauce. It's a keeper, tho!

Another winner! I made this for guests last week. Used farfalle because my husband especially likes it. I do think a pound of pasta is too much for the amount of sauce. I would use less next time. We served this with a green salad and roasted asparagus. Very good.

I actually brought some in for lunch today and I let my co-workers have a taste and they ranted and raved too! They all want the recipe. It was easy to make and delicious. I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes packed in their own oil so I bought regular sun-dried tomatoes, added olive oil to the container and let it sit for a while. Wow, what a burst of flavor. You'll defintely enjoy this and it doesn't need a side dish. It's a meal all by itself!

I have made variations of this in the past and have found that adding port or even some Madeira or Marsala compliments the gorgonzola cheese and enhances the taste. Definitely needs more sauce (or less pasta). Get creative with this one--it's a keeper!

This went over well at my brunch party. I made double the recipe and doubling the pasta turned out to be WAY too much however. I substituted good quality bacon for the prosciutto (which was very expensive!) and also used dry sun-dried tomatoes ($3) instead of oil-packed ones ($10) and just soaked them in my own olive oil for a few days and it was fine.

Rating: 3
It was good, everyone enjoyed and it was easy. My family thought higher of it than I did. I think there are plenty of other pasta/chicken/sauce dishes out there and would try another one instead of making this again. I did add 1/2 cup of cream and added an additional 1 cup chicken broth because of the other reviews stating the need for more sauce...I am glad I did. I did not double any of the other ingredients and the added liquid did not take away from the flavor. It made enough for my family of four.

Thank you fellow epicurious & reviewers! I pulled this recipe from this site hours before a dinner party for 12. tripled it, added heavy whipping cream and wine as advised, a little extra cheese, low low sodium broth and romano on top. I was pleased how well it held up to being multiplied. My boyfriend said today as he ate the left overs; "this is the best thing you've EVER made". (thanks again for the help). It made all the difference. This is a tasty, attractive winner.

This is out of this world! I've made it twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, my husband said it was "good". The second time I used 1/4 cup of chicken broth and 1/4 cup of cream instead of 1/2 cup of broth. With this small change my husband said it was "Excellent!". The sauce seemed to coat the pasta better with the addition of cream. I highly recomment this dish!

Superb, sophisticated, adult taste. Superior. I had no prosciutto but instead fried two slices of bacon, removed them and then crumbled them back into the dish later. I kept the little bit of bacon grease in the pan, added the oil and used it to cook the chicken. This is a special occasion dish for people who appreciate great taste.

I wanted to give this 3 forks but my husband and daughter said it was definitely 4 forks. I also used a cup of broth and I used gnocchi (potato dumplings) instead of the shaped pasta. I used 2 tbsp blue cheese in place of the gorgonzola and added parmesan at the end when tossing. Oil packed tomatoes are so expensive so I used dried ones and added the rehydrating liquid to the chicken after I sauteed it in olive oil. This went together very quickly after just a little prepreparation and I would make it again for sure.
