Tastes like ketchup, just slightly fancier/tastier. It's not too difficult to make though, so if that's what you're looking for, it's worth it to make.

I made this to go with the tourtieres for a Canadian Thanksgiving and it was quite tasty. However, I used about half the amount of vinegar called for as I have had problems in the past with recipes for chutneys which have turned out too vinegar-y. I also used this sauce for a raost chicken and it went quite well with the chicken.

I made this last year - partly because it sounded AWFUL, but I didn't think Gourmet would have a recipe for anything that tasted as dreadful as this sounded to me. To my surprise, it's really good: an excellent savory, not dessert-y, cranberry relish recipe.
