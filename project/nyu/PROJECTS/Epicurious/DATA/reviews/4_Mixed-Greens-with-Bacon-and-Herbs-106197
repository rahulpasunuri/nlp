I have made the rest of the menu (mahogany beef stew and horseradish mashed potatoes - which I heartily recommend) several times without including this salad. This time, I rounded out the meal with the salad. It was a perfect complement. I made a few, small changes: I used a bagged herb salad mix (Whole Foods) and curly endive, and skipped the extra herbs listed in the recipe. Also substituted turkey bacon. And added a teaspoon of mustard to the salad dressing. I will make this again.

My family and I loved this salad. Very light and easy, but super flavorful! I also made it for a lasagna dinner and it was the perfect complement.

Prepared this to serve with our Easter ham instead of a steamed veg. sidedish - it was wonderful, and so easy to prepare. Very fresh tasting!

Excellent. I made it without the bacon and I added some dijon to the dressing. I only had dried tarragon, which I added to the dressing as well. I served it with the Mahogany Beef Stew (made it many times, love it) and the Horseradish Mashed Potatoes from the same issue. Highly recommmended

Love it! Also, as I always seek variations on cooked greens, I use this recipe as such, adding herbs, and greens such as chard and/or kale, to the bacon, and toss the greens until just barely cooked. Fresh or cooked, your dinner companions will beg for more!

This is s unbelieveably good. I made it with a lasagna dinner one night, and by the look of the recipe, I thought it would be a simple side dish. Turned out to be the star of the show! I also threw in some dill with the rest of the herbs, and mixed it with a bag a baby greens from the grocery store. Very nice recipe! Thanks!!!!

The great thing about this recipe is that is gives the correct ratio of greens to herbs--about a 1/2 tablespoon per two cups of greens. The bacon is a nice contrast to the strong flavors of the cilantro and tarragon. I've made the salad with other greens and other herbs, but keeping the ratio the same. Always comes out great.

Tasty combination of herbs. I'd probably make it more often if I had an herb garden, or if herbs were cheaper here. Ooh, and I added a little feta as well. Yum.

I thought this was delicious -- and would be so even without the bacon -- but I found out that some people react violently to cilantro.

simple and delicious! Full of flavor but simple enough to go with any main course. I made it exactly as written but I did use thick cut bacon - which allowed for a stronger bacon taste.

Delicious! Very light yet decadent. I will definitely serve this as my "house" salad for years to come.

Made this simple, beautiful salad to go with a family Christmas Eve dinner of Pasta Bolognese. It was a huge hit - even with the 6 and 7-year old grandsons. Used all mixed greens and was generous in measuring out the fresh herbs; great marriage of flavors and the bacon added just enough texture to keep it interesting. Would definitely make it again! The dressing was perfect; complemented the various flavors of the herbs and bacon w/o overpowering any of them!

I have made this recipe twice now. It's simple yet delicious, and goes perfectly with a hearty winter stew and mashed potatoes.
