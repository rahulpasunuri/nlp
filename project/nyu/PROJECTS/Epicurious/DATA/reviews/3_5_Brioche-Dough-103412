I've made several brioche recipes and this is very easy. What I like is the relatively small quantity it makes. I haven't tried doubling this recipe; I rely on Nancy Silverton or Rose Levy Beranbaum's version for larger quantities. The flour is indeed light which is important to enable this recipe's starter strength to do the work.

it was good

worked perfectly, other reviews were right, trust the recipe, even if the dough appears too wet. I even kept it in the fridge for 48 hours before I baked it because it was NFL playoffs. Rich, buttery, exactly as I remembered from my trip to the Provence.

Great recipe. If you do it exactly as written. Don't add extra flour this is not french bread it should be soft and tacky. It will thicken after 12hr cooling. Bread should have a feel so if you don't usually make bread try something easier.

Wow. What a mixed set of reviews spread over so much time. Anyway. Tried two brioche recipes before this one and both were miserable disasters. Just very tasty hockey pucks. I am a French-trained chef, but not a bread maker. So, not a complete beginner, but certainly not well versed in technique. This recipe turned out perfectly and was very easy to accomplish. I only had to let my yeast activate a little longer than ten minutes, but it does say "about" ten minutes. The resulting dough, after the last addition of butter, was unbelievably wet. It felt very strange to have to scrape the dough out of the bowl with the rubber spatula. I had to resist the urge to add more flour, but I am so happy that I did. Just follow the recipe. You will be happy. The second time I made it I added 1 tablespoon of honey and only put 1 1/2 tablespoons of granulated sugar. Yum. Of course I will still try other recipes, because that's what growing is about. But, this is definitely my go-to recipe. Just don't start it at midnight like I invariably do.

This is my standard brioche recipe and I *love* it. Don't make the mistake of adding extra flour -- it *will* be a very very (very!) soft dough before you refrigerate it. The overnight rest is critical, and you'll find that it's much much easier to handle and shape after the rest. It's buttery and delicious. Love it!

Disaster. I bake a lot and this recipe it truly messed up with wrong information. First of all it takes much more flour than the recipe calls for and then I refrigerated it for 24 hours, which it did rise in the fridge; took it out to rise again and then it turned into a flat cake in the oven.

My husband told me yesterday that a radio program did a survey on what turned women on and baking cookies was number one.....well that's only because they haven't baked this brioche dough. Oh my goodness, just watching it rise and seeing how light and beautiful the dough was, was exciting. Anyway, need to take a deep breath....I only added the extra salt that others have mentioned and have followed the recipe to a "T"....for shaping I rolled eight even size balls and placed in a zigzag form in a standard 8 x 4 baking pan. What a treat. Plan on using the bread on Christmas morning to make "Poached Egg Brioche" recipe that I found on this site.

Mmmmmm... I'm no expert on brioche, and a relative amateur with yeast breads but I found this brioche to be absolutely delicious! The dough was very sticky indeed, but I refrained from adding the extra flour as I like to give a recipe its due and try it unchanged the first time. The only change I would make is to increase the salt to 1/2 tsp. - perhaps that's a more American taste, but I sprinkled a little salt on the slice while still warm from the oven and I found it filled out the flavor beautifully. It was rich, moist (what would you expect with all that butter!) and the crust was extremely tender. I had no problem getting it to rise. As for baking instructions, I had to search the internet for that - for the traditional brioche pan, place about 4/5 of the dough in a round ball and make a 2-3" well in the top of it; form the remaining 1/5 into a small ball and place it in the indentation. Let rise 2-3 hours until dough has risen higher than the edge of the pan. Brush gently with 1 beaten egg mixed with 2 tsp. water. Bake at 375 (350-360 for dark coated pan) 35-45 minutes - cool in pan 10 minutes than remove from pan to cool. I will be making this brioche again and again to be sure.

I am new to brioche making but did learn that brioche dough is supposed to be more tacky than regular bread. Still the 1.5 Cups flour called for in this recipe yielded an extremely wet dough...I ended up putting in an extra cup of flour. I then found a few other brioche recipes and all called for more flour. What gives?

Just read this recipe and it sounds like most other brioche recipes, but are the baking instructions missing, or do I just not see them?

I thought this was a perfectly acceptable version of brioche. However, as the previous reviewer pointed out, brioche is a soft, bready bread or roll; the method you describe of rolling the dough, layering with butter, is either puff pastry or croissant dough, not brioche!!!

Dandmorgan, Skelly: You guys are both CONFUSED!Brioche is not Inlayed and turned with butter. That is puff pastry, and the process that you are reffering to is done to acheive what is called Muille Fuille (thousand leaves.) Brioche is in fact a bread and NOT a pastry, it is a rich yeasted dough that is based on Eggs and Butter. When Puff pastry is Not Correctly turned it will become a brioche consistency because the layers of fat merge and do not stay seperate to acheive the flaky consistency that is desired in Puff Pastry. Puff Pastry is Leavened with Steam, Brioche with YEAST. NICE TRY FOODIES!! and Yes I am an Industry Professional.

You all got me to try this recipe by your comments. Its not a bad substitute for a true brioche which Mr. Skelly is correct. A true brioche does not use yeast as a rising agent but rather relies for its rising action on the chef who must fold and roll out the dough in many repitions throughout the day before it will be used in the various pastries that it forms the basis for. The recipe is very simple. Make a dough with about 2 cups flour, 2 tbls. sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt and just enough water to form the dough. Using the dough hook method add just enough cold water to get the dough to adhere to the hook (add a little at a time. Roll the dough out and then take a pound (yes 1 full pound) of butter (if you use salted you can eliminate the salt in the dough) spread the butter to cover half the dough and then fold the other half of dough over the buttered side. Now roll it out ot the original size and fold it again. Keep the rolling surface lightly floured during each rolling. Keep doing this until the dough is too unworkable. Then refridgerate for a few hours and do it again. and then again. After about 128 layers you're done. After the first set you can fold in quarters to speed things a long a little. (Big bakeries actually have machine rollers just for this process.) The next morning the dough needs to be rolled out into convenient shapes after coming up from refridgerated temp a bit. Then use it in croisants or cinnimon rolls or whatever. What makes it rise is all the air that is trapped in the dough during the rolling process. Hope this helps. Enjoy!!

I am uncertain why this recipe was described as 'lean' and a complicated version of sourdough...I'm curious if you actually tried the recipe when determining it was not brioche and submitting your review? First, while it does call for a starter, this is a far cry from sourdough. Preparing a starter simply gives the yeast time to activate and improves the final texture, which I personally do for all of my bread recipes including basic Italian. An hour is not enough time for the starter to sour - that is a process that takes several days. As far as being lean...From the tens of recipes I have researched, I find two basic varieties. One has nearly twice the flour to egg/butter ratio and is more of a traditional bread dough...still a good bread but not what I would consider brioche. This is more of a yeast batter and I have had excellent results on two of the three occasions I made the recipe. Potential problems: The second time I made this, I was not paying careful attention and mixed the yeast in with the flour for the starter. For some reason, when I then mixed in the warm milk, I ended up with a dry, heavy dough that didn't want to raise (until I added additional warm milk after an hour and the yeast kicked into overdrive!). I also made the dough early and allowed it to remain in the refrigerator for almost 2 days before baking and the result was a fermented, beer-like taste. If you are not going to bake it after 12-15 hours, be sure to punch down the dough 2-3 times per day to avoid this and be sure to follow the instructions for the starter to avoid the mistake I made. Also, I would recommend increasing the salt content to 1/2 tsp, particularly if you are using unsalted butter. Overall, I found this to be an excellent recipe. The final texture is light and flaky and somewhat reminiscent of a croissant, and it makes the best French toast I have ever tasted!

I LOVE this brioche dough! I live in Europe and I can say that this is very comparable to the brioches I get from the bakery, which is saying a lot! It was relatively easy, although it does take time to rise, etc., but don't all recipes with yeast? Don't understand why previous reviewers gave only 2 forks max. Am keeping this recipe as my standard brioche dough recipe.

For what it is, this recipe is fine--I've baked it both as a simple loaf in a traditional fluted pan and as Raisin Brioche Pastries (a recipe I also found on this site)--both were delicious and compared favorably from my local French bakery. After reading Mr. Skelly's comments, I went looking for other variations online. Of the dozen or so I scanned before I got bored, I only found one that significantly differed from this one and it was a lot richer. All the others were nearly the same, including one I found at a site in France (with ingredients in metrics measurements). In Craig Claireborne's "The Original New York Times Cookbook", he lists two variations--one like this one that he calls "American Brioche" and another with twice the eggs and butter labelled "French Brioche". The latter sounded like a lot of work, but I might try it for comparison.

This is an awfully lean and mean version of brioche -- in fact, brioche it ain't. Brioche is more a pastry than a bread, involving use of many eggs and a great deal of butter and well worth overcoming one's fear of food. The recipe above might be termed a politically correct brioche ("for the health-conscious '90s", as they simper) or an unnecessarily complicated recipe for sourdough bread. Where do I find a real French receipe for brioche, but one adapted to American ingredients (and I don't mean one castrated to placate food phobias or the bitch goddess "Health."
