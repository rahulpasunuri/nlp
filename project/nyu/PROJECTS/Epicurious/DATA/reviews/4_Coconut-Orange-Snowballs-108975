These cookies are simply phenomenal. The flavor and texture combination of the orange peel and toasted coconut (do not skip the toasting - you can do it in a few minutes in a pan on the stovetop) is perfect, combined with the buttery softness of the cookies. And they are one of the easiest, quickest cookies you will ever make. I can't praise this recipe highly enough.

These cookies are fantastic. Got raves from my bridge club. I thought that the dough was going to be crumbly also, but just keep beating it and it comes together nicely. I did not have coconut extract, so used almond extract and it worked well. The cookie would probably have a more pronounced coconut flavor if I had not substituted. But I think they were great.

A delicious confection! These cookies are light yet substantial, delicate yet sturdy... the toasted coconut flavor is dominant, and the citrus complements it wonderfully. I did not have coconut extract but found the flaked coconut to impart enough flavor. When making this recipe, note that the powdered sugar is not listed as "divided" in the ingredient list, but all the powdered sugar does not go in to the cookies; most is reserved for rolling the baked cookies. Mine did not require all of the sugar reserved for rolling. I used a tablespoon-sized dough scoop to make nearly perfect balls of dough; they shaped easily. These are very pretty cookies - they look great on a tray of assorted goodies.

Every year my work has a holiday cookie party. Being an alpha female, I'm always trying to make the yummiest cookie at the party. Last year I made these coconut-orange snowballs and... they may have won the contest. They are GREAT holiday cookies: rich, delicious, and addictive. Like another reviewer, I think of them as the best wedding cookie I've ever had. Like another reviewer, I used some tangerine as well as orange peel. If you want to make a memorable holiday cookie, this is a safe bet. I'll be making it again this year! The only other holiday cookie that has gotten onto my repeat list is a Jam Thumbprints recipe from Cooks Illustrated Holiday Baking 2008. You should check out that one too.

Oooooh, no no no!! You must leave in the orange--that makes these cookies in my opinion. I made these as part of my numerous other Christmas cookies to hand out to our neighbors. The neighbors raved about them and so did I! These are definitely going to be a part of my Christmas cookie making from now on. Definitely better than just the boring old regular snowball cookies, or wedding cookies I think they're also referred to as.

These cookies were so-so. I think if I make them again, I will leave out the orange. It gave them a bitter taste. It also overpowered the coconut flavor.

Rating: 4
These are super! I used tangerine instead of orange rind and I used unsweetened coconut and just sprinkled a little sugar over it before I toasted it. The coconut was perfectly toasted in 5 mins. After mixing with the electric mixer the dough was too crumbly, so I added just a tad of soy milk and used my hands to mix and squish the dough to the right consistency. I think maybe the butter I used was too cold.

I too had problems with this one..... the dough was not a good consistency, more like cornmeal BUT I determined that they WOULD go into little balls! End result was rock hard powdered sugar "snow balls" too much flour?? no idea as I did exactly as it said.....

Delicious and decadent! Just the right amount of coconut and orange flavors. I was worried these wouldn't come out because the consistency of the dough was a bit odd but after I kneaded it with my hands and chilled it for a bit they rolled into balls perfectly. I wish there was a way to roll a bit of coconut on the outside - maybe I'll serve them on a plate of shaved coconut next time. I served half and froze the other half - they thawed perfectly even after being frozen with the powdered sugar.

Very easy for a novice not only to baking, but to the kitchen in general :) Did not find the dough hard to work with. I only chilled the dough for 30 minutes in the freezer and it was plenty cold. Also, a lemon zester worked perfectly for the orange peel. Will definitely make again. I will use more orange zest and/or orange extract and I'll stir the coconut every 2 minutes or so as it toasts VERY quickly.

I am rating this at 4 forks as I am still excited about making this. Do want to point out that I just goofed and put the entire 2 1/4 powedered sugar with my room temp butter and began creaming. Oops, the recipe stated 1/2 cup with the butter. Perhaps the ingredients list could be altered to note this. It is confusing. Perhaps this is why the previous cook had problems with her cookies. Good luck!

I had such high hopes for this recipe. I read all the reviews over and followed the recipe EXACTLY but I think something went wrong. When I mixed in the flour and orange rind, the consistency was almost corn meal-ish, like a cake mix rather than something to make dough. I chilled it for an hour but there was no "rolling" into balls, it was more like "pressing" into balls. The taste is really nice but the consistency is a bit hockey puck. I reread the recipe four times and can't figure out what I may have done and I didn't see anyone mention a similar problem in the reviews. Sigh. And they're for a cookie exchange tomorrow morning!

yum. i have made these many times (mostly around christmas) and everyone loves them. i don't change a single thing to the recipe.

i toast the coconut until its pretty browned and dry, stirring it often to get it consistent. use vanilla beans instead of vanilla and you won't be disappointed. i usually add some cinnamon as well and sometimes a little powdered ginger. i make these are as part of a large christmas baking effort and they can be done early and put in the freezer for several weeks.

Delicious, melty, must-make cookies. One time I made them with tangerine zest (forgot to buy oranges) and they were even more wonderful.

I really liked these cookies. I couldn't find coconut extract (actually I could only find artificial -- is there the 'real' kind?) so I just left it out and I thought these were very tasty.

I use a microplane grater to get the zest off an orange. It is fast and produces a very fine zest. One orange usually produces a teaspoon of zest using this method.

I followed the recommendations of an earlier reviewer and made these with walnuts and orange extract. These were the best of all the Christmas cookies I made and I didn't find them labor-intensive compared to, say, cutting out and decorating gingerbread or sugar cookies. Next time I would make the balls smaller because they seemed rather big even though I used a tablespoon to scoop out the dough. I didn't get anywhere close to three dozen. However since these cookies taste best when eaten within a day or two it's probably better not to make too many and have them go stale. This cookie was very popular with all my guests.

I love these cookies. I made exactly to the recipe and was pleased but may try a little more orange next time. I fine grated the zest so it mixed nicely. And I'm really happy - I didn't burn the coconut!! Almost though!! LOL These will be on my regular Christmas cookie rotation.

I loved these cookies but my husband rated them as only "okay". I did not use coconut extract because I did not have any, so maybe that was the problem for him. I liked the salty- sweetness and the hint of coconut and orange and good (unsalted) butter. I thought they were pretty labor-intensive, what with the stiff dough and chopping the orange zest (it should be chopped pretty fine) and burning the first batch of coconut (oops! I know, there were warnings posted!) and two coatings of powdered sugar. Can you tell I am not a big fan of cookie-making? But in the end they were delicious, and despite the work, I would make them again (adding the coconut extract, which I now have).

I substituted same amount of toasted, chopped walnuts for the coconut, and same amount of orange extract for the coconut extract/flavoring. MUCH better - elevates recipe to 4 forks. Recipe was 3 forks w/the cocount. Great for a Christmas cookie exchange.

My favorite cookie! I absolutely loved these. Subtle but delicious. Perfect with chocolate fondue.

These are delicious and easy to make. I used a small ice cream scoop instead of hand rolling, which worked really well. I didn't need as much powdered sugar as suggested for rolling them at the end. Great flavor combination.

excellent cookies! Always well received. I agree with one cooks's warning not to burn the coconut. Has happened to me.

Rating: 3
These are very good, but I disagree with those who say they are too salty -- if I were to make them again, I'd add more a dash more salt to balance some of the sweetness. Very good, but I think I prefer the nut version better. I suspect these would be very good with some chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans) in place of some of the coconut.

Rating: 4
mmm, mmm, MMM! Make these cookies. A nice change from the usual nut version. Agree with previous reviewers: use unsalted butter or omit salt, no need for second sugar rolling; they are sweet enough. Definitely double the recipe or you'll have a lot of left over coconut.

I have been making these cookies for a few years now. They are so good they have become one of my traditional Christmas cookies. make sure you pay a lot of attention to the coconut while toasting. I have a bad habit of burning it.

Wow! These are great. I am about to make them for the second time as they have all gone very quickly. They are a great holiday cookie since they are a completely different flavor than the traditional desserts.

Rating: 3
These are good but a couple of tips; Don't skip the coconut extract. I didn't have any and thought I would do without. The cookies lacked a depth of flavor that I'm sure was due to its absence. Also be sure that your zest is very finely grated otherwise you end up with a chunkier result than you would want for such a delicate and flaky cookie.Overall very good,looks festive for the holidays and is a nice change of pace.

These cookies were so good and it was so nice to have something other than a chocolate chip cookie. Everyone loved them.

Just finished baking these beauties, and I gotta' say they drive a hard bargain against the traditional pecan drops! I followed the recipe exactly as written. Lovely orange flavor, and the toasted coconut is Definitely a huge flavor contribution I wasn't expecting. I did actually refrigerate and bake the following day, which seemed to allow the flavors to deepen and meld. My only advice? DOUBLE THE RECIPE! They're way too good for the size batch they produce!

Rating: 4
I suspect I goofed and added an extra 1/4c of flour, because the dough resembled a coarse meal. I also 'stooped' to dried grated orange peel. While I definitely think the cookie would be better served with fresh orange zest, and less flour, these were still really addictive. I added some coconut to the powdered sugar hoping I would end up with coconut covered cookies, and that 'almost' worked. Either way, they were very cute and bite sized, not too sweet, or too salty and the fact that they were too dry was my fault entirely. I will have to make them correctly next time, since they are so good even when done wrong.

Excellent. All my friends asked for the recipe. Will definitely make again.

These were a great change from the usual nut based recipie I have. They were tender/crunchy and didn't completely fall apart when bitten into. I used kosher salt (half as much) which gave the cookie and balanced sweet salt flavor.

I had to make this 3 times, as every time I put out a platter of Xmas cookies this one was the first to go. Using a fresh, robust orange is essential, as I thought of resorting to dried & grated orange peel and it's not the same.

I couldnt help but wonder if the people who had the salty problem were using unsalted butter as directed...this might explain what happened

I have added this recipe to my Christmas must haves. I made them last year and they were a big hit. I had none of the problems the others did. They were not tough or salty and I thought they were fair better than ones made with just nuts. For me they were perfect.

Although these were fairly tasty I found them to be a little tough. I prefer the ones with nuts rather than coconut

Although I agree with the previous reviewer about the excess of salt, I still found these to be delicious, as did my guests. The texture is lovely and the flavor has a refreshing tropical hint to it. So...probably best to downsize the salt by 1/2, and then it's perfect and can be enjoyed year-round!

I thought these were WAY too salty. 1/2 tsp. of salt seems like an awful lot. The recipe I usually make doesn't use any salt at all. Is this a typo with the salt, or what?

Rating: 0
You have to like coconut to enjoy these. I do, but still prefer the traditional nut-flavored snowballs instead. They are a different and unusual change for holiday cookies. I don't think the second coating of sugar is necessary. Save some time and skip it.
