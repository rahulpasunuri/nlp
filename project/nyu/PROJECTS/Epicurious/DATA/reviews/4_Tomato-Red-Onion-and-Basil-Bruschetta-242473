Excellent although I have done it several different breads, and conglomerations of onion and tomato. You really have to find the right combination for you. I usually use large tomatoes food processed. Best bruschetta recipe going though.

Big hit! I roasted the heirloom tomatoes and the onion (cut into wedges, diced after roasting), and threw in a bit of roasted red pepper. Served on slices of Italian bread toasted with a dash of romano in the oven and rubbed with garlic.

This is really fresh and perfect for a light sunday evening on the porch with a crisp white wine. No heirlooms of any size are available around here, but I used the yellow grape tomatos, mixed with red and it was the prettiest, tastiest dish I've had in a long time. A super way to use the excess basil my plant is producing too. Fine dice the onion, and quarter the grape tomatos, even though they are tiny, it lets you get more onto the toast...large pieces fall off. Finish with just a squirt of lemon.

Made just how the recipe stated with the exception of I added chopped up sun dried tomatoes to it as well and a touch more balsamic vinegar (because I love balsamic vinegar). Everyone loved this.

This recipe is a keeper. Made it for a potluck and got rave reviews. Used fresh cherry tomatoes from our garden and subbed fresh parsley and tarragon for the basil. Also added some chopped garlic cloves and just used a regular french loaf. I highly recommend this if you're trying to use up your summer tomatoes!

Delicious recipe with a few alterations- it only needs 1 or 2 Tbsp oil, GREAT with super grainy wholewheat bread, can use Walla Walla onions super finely chopped, doesn't need any balsamic if the tomatoes are at peak season, lots more garlic, add a serious grind of pepper and a dash of salt to make this perfect! Also you can use heirloom tomatoes, super delicious! Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Tomato-Red-Onion-and-Basil-Bruschetta-242473#ixzz0xa556jbi

Delicious! Simple, colorful and delicious! I used what I had on hand - Roma tomatoes, grape tomatoes and figs. I also used the red onion and had to substitute fresh tarragon for the basil. I'm all out of balsamic vinegar and used red wine vinegar instead. I served this on 9-grain ciabata. I agree that the trick is not to top the bread with the tomato mixture until it's ready to be served. My husband I love this and I will definitely make again.

unbelievably delicious - such a hit at a very high-brow pot luck birthday dinner we recently went to... Instead of focaccia, I used a regular baguette, sliced and prepared as suggested. Leftover tomato mixture was incredible the next day. I'd recommend making the mixture one day in advance if possible. I will definitely make this again.

Summer food heaven! Made this with all fresh LI locals - heirloom grape tomatoes, basil and onions. I served as a do-it yourself app, so instead of the focaccia, I used another epicurious recipe: cut a baguette into 1/2 inch slices on the diagonal, on cookie sheet, drizzles both sides with olive oil, into oven for 30min at 250. Then out and rubbed with a cut piece of garlic. Served these in a bowl. It was amazing.

Yes, it's easy and delish. I added 4 thousand crushed cloves of garlic to the mix and let everything sit overnight in the fridge. Didn't have cherry tomatoes so made tomato petals (and chopped em up). Served on sourdough toasted bread with Feta...difficult to eat tho', you need a big mouth or larger plates. Thank you epicurious.com. Yes, will make again, and again, and again.

This is the only bruschetta recipe I'll make. I make it as is with heirloom tomatoes. I suggest sprinkling some parmesan cheese over the bread before putting it under the broiler. My husband and I just ate this for a light dinner tonight. Amazing!

You'll be the hit of the party when you bring this dish. I've made this many, many times to great acclaim. When you're looking for something lighter, the tomato mixture is wonderful with a lettuce salad. You may also make this the night before and store in the fridge. The mini tomatoes really do make the difference. I've made this with full size tomatoes and while good, it wasn't the same.

This thing is delicious, seasonal, light, healthy, and addictive. Out of all the elaborate things I make, this is my fiance's favorite. The only tip would be to pour on the toppings immediately before serving so that the bread doesn't get soggy. Ciabata can also be used for focaccia if you can't find the latter. I've made this upwards of twenty times, experimenting with new combinations of tomatoes (a fun seasonal variation). Make This!

This recipe is full of simple, fresh-tasting flavor that will enhance any kind of bread, (try it on sourdough, Italian, French). Letting the ingredients meld for several hours at room temperature only enhances it more, (I mince that garlic and mix it in with the other stuff). Sure, you could get creative and add cheese, olives, other things, but I love it as is - each taste both complements the others and shines through individually.

Exactly how bruschetta should taste! I used a leftover French baguette cut on the bias and prepared it as in the recipe.This is an epicurious SIN, but after using a pint of grape tomatoes, I still needed more tomatoes so I had to add a can of canned diced tomatoes infused with roasted garlic. Do not chastise me...it was in a pinch...but it STILL tasted delicious!

This was absolutely amazing! I used regular tomatoes and added a clove of chopped garlic to the mixture, and it tasted great. The tomatoes I used were very juicy, so it was a very liquidy bruschetta, but it was delicious all the same!

So good! Wonderful with various types of garden fresh tomatoes and a high quality balsamic. I didn't have red onion on hand, but white onion worked just as well. Will be using this recipe again!

Great recipe! I had this bruschetta with a glass of red wine again now for the second time. This time I put some mozzarella over the brushetta and put into owen for maybe 5 minutes. The mozzarella melted a little bit and became even more delicious.

This is a fantastic recipe! I tried it tonight and kind of just winged the measurements, but followed them for the most part. My only addition was a single (large), green serrano chili. I definitely recommend it and can't imagine this recipe without it. DO IT. It's yummy.

I used regular fresh tomatoes from the garden and it was wonderful. Why would you deviate from this recipe when it is so good. I've made it several times this week to rave reviews every time.

This is absolutely delicious. I didn't have a red onion so I used green onions. Also, I added more olive oil and balsamic vinegar and made a dip out of it. This way you don't have to worry about it falling off the bread. It got raves at my party.

This was a delicious treat on a wintry day. I used organic cherry tomatoes but would use the heirloom tomatoes in season. I also topped it with chevre, as I was doing a theme menu - it was a very tasty addition and received raves. Definitely a keeper.

Very very yummy... I used a bagueete and also added diced fresh mozzerella... very simple and tasty!

This is fantastic as written.I did try "freshcopes" suggestion in trying this with a standard baguette and found I liked it better than the focaccia. But, for variety, I actually made it both ways and everyone seemed to enjoy that.

This colorful, fresh bruschetta was a hit with my dinner guests. It's healthy and delicious. It was a little bit awkward to eat, though, because the tomato topping had a tendancy to slip off the bread. My answer next time: larger, thinner pieces of foccacia toast, with the topping placed safely in the middle.

I agree with everyone else, its great recipe. I also, added things but would have been happy as it was written. I just threw it together with ingredients I had on hand and EVERYONE was asking about the recipe. (Which I reluctantly admitted was based on Bon Appetit's Version) I used grape tomatoes, and sun-dried tomatoes. I two kinds of sun-dried tomatoes: dried and in-oil. I drained and patted the oiled ones and used 1/2 tbsp oil instead, and I had only half the required red onion so I subbed with small crisp Vidalia finely diced. Basil and oregano, and French Baguette sliced 1/2 inch, dusted with EVOO and hit under the broiler for 3-5 mins. Made it for a test 2 weeks ago and then at the BIG GAME party my family had. Not one ounce left. Even my parents who HATE SPICY things devoured this, which does have a bite.

Great basic recipe. I made some changes. Didn't have heirloom tomatoes to add color, so added a yellow bell pepper. Gave it a nice crunch. Used fresh cilantro because basil was out of season. Still turned out great. Will try again when I can find basil.

Tasty tasty tasty! Only change I made was to chop the garlic and top the bread with it before tossing it in the oven. Delicious and a great basic bruschetta recipe. We will definitely be making this again.

I use this recipe myself, but just chop the garlic fine and put it right in with the tomatoes. Balsamic vinegar is our favorite. Try some goat cheese on top! Also, grill the bread, you won't be disappointed!

I have always used this recipe with some changes. I use what ever tomatoes I find grown in the US. I do all my prep using all the ingredients listed. Cider or wine vinegar preferred. I spritz the vinegar and some, "EVOO", over the veggies and let it sit in the refrig for about 15 mutes. I use a french bread baggette sliced 1/2 inch, brush with the EVOO and put the slices under the broiler to crisp up. serve on a platter with the Bruschetta in the middle surrounded by the bread slices. YUM YUM .

Remind me to not invite FreshCope to my next party. What a wet blanket! I'm sure you'd be happier creating your own hi-tech recipes than using these. But it's so fun to criticize other people, isn't it?? The recipe sounds fabulous. We all doctor stuff up, of course. Jiminy crickets.

FreshCope - who are you and why do you have to provide commentary on every recipe of the day? Your comments are not reviews! Why don't you actually TRY the recipe as written! I did try the recipe and it was great! I used tomatoes from the garden and a thin focaccia - fantastic. This may be "basic" but it is a crowd pleaser.

Rating: 0
Basic, but not bad, so long as you skip the focaccia, which will interfere with the some of the more delicate flavors of this recipe. To make this recipe more interesting, I suggest drizzling the bruschetta with a balsamic reduction before serving. You might even marinate the tomatoes and onions in the reduction overnight for additional intensity of flavor. The recipe as written is pretty much THE tradition Italian bruschetta. But it is also so simple that it's success will depend on the quality of your tomatoes, so make sure that they are ripe, fresh and in-season.

Delicious, it was my dinner last night and probably again tonight. Next time I will cut the tomatoes smaller, I halved most of them and they tended to roll off the bread. If you are not crazy about balsamic vinegar you might want to cut back a bit. I love it and thought it the perfect amount and it soaks into the bread deliciously.
