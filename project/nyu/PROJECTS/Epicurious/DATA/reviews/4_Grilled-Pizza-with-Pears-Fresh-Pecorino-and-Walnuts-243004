I just made this grilled pizza last night. No more grilled eggplant or portobello mushroom burgers for the vegetarians in my life. This was fun to make, sooo yummy and was the perfect recipe to introduce me to the world of grilled pizza. I used a three month Manchego; they didn't have Brinata at the local store. The Manchego worked great! We have a gas grill, I do not think it would work on charcoal, unless you have an expert griller. The only thing I would change (there will definitely be a next time) is to lightly brush the crust with olive oil before putting on the toppings and maybe add a sprinkle of fresh thyme.

Pears, Manchego, walnuts, and black pepper are a great combination. I'm lazy and so I just make this on Boboli pizza shells rather than making my own dough. They come out great on the grill--you only need 2-3 min. over high heat on a gas grill to melt the cheese and make the crust really crisp and a bit charred.

I don't understand why a recipe only 12 people have made can be a "blue ribbon" and "top ranked." Doesn't make sense to me.

Love it! It's easy to make and really yummy! I've made this dough several times and added various toppings it's always really good on the BBQ!

This is really delicious. Great with manchego and with gorgonzola too. Fantastic with some wine.

This is fabulous. I made the entire Tuscan Grill menu. Each & every dish was a huge success!

Creativity got the best of us while making this.... so we used gorgonzola instead of manchego and added caramelized red onions... It tasted amazing... next time Ill make a small one actually following the recipe and a large one with the gorgonzola

nhampton, it says to grill the dough for 1 1/2 minutes on each side. I'm guessing that's how it gets the grill marks on top.

Great recipe, then get creative and come up with your own combinations. I make the crusts, then freeze a few to have them on hand.

If you carefully read the recipe, you'll see that you are supposed to grill both sides lightly before putting on toppings. The last paragraph of the crust portion details this.

I made this recipe when I got the last Bon Appetit magazine. Was amazing and a real crowd pleaser.

a comment. You will notice from the picture shown that there are grill marks on the TOP of the pizza dough. That won't happen if you follow the directions given in the recipe. I have made grilled pizza numerous times and you must grill the dough on one side first then put the toppings on the grilled side. Slide the pizza back onto grill and cook until toppings are melted. You should do the second side on low or indirect heat. The first side on direct heat for about 5 minutes, turning 90 degrees at a time. watch bottom for burning. Hope this helps people making this recipe. That photo tells the whole story.

Substitute brie for the cheese portion. It's exquisite. A cross between appetizer and dessert.

Used crushed hazlenuts instead of walnuts, and fontina instead of pecorino. Slightly thicker slices of pear and it was fabulous hot from the pizza oven.
