I'd use a little less garlic and a little more pine nuts.

My hubby bought a couple of basil plants and decided to prune them to encourage more growth. Followed this recipe as indicated and it's really good. I mixed the pesto with penne, broccolli and chicken breast. Yummmmssss!

Incredibly easy and delicious. The perfect amounts of basil, garlic, pine nuts and Parmesan. I will make this again and again.

The perfect balance of garlic and basil-the measurements were just right. I often just toss in the basil by the handful and sometimes end up with a pesto that is too strong. This recipe never lets me down. I typically make it x5 and freeze it in batches. It keeps me from dragging out the food processor and gives us fresh garden pesto all year long!

Very flavorful and easy. I added heavy whipping cream. It makes it creamier and coats the pasta very nicely! Not as low cal but worth the calories!

This is the perfect recipe for a quick, simple and delicious pesto. It made excellent use of the surplus basil in my garden. Definitely a repeater.

I always have lots of basil in the summer. So much better than purchased pesto.
