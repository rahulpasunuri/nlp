Actually found this quite tasty, but won't repeat it because it was far too much work. I used on 5 onions, but they were HUGE. Cooked down a bit longer than suggested, but had to to get rid of liquid.

One fork from me. I have never, ever rated a recipe as awful, but this was close. Long prep time slicing up 6 large onions, cooking the spinach, making the the roux, boiling the lasagne noodles, and then letting it bake for 1- 1/2 hours! Far too many onions, very little taste (could not even smell it baking), even with oregano. We had it one night for dinner and tossed it out the next morning. Not worth leftovers. Sorry, but honest!

I made significant modifications based on the reviews. Used 3 onions, one of each, and 3 scallions. Added a package of sliced baby bella muchions and a mixture of frozen spinach and fresh baby spinach. I used gluton free brown rice lasagne noodles and bunches of fresh oregano. DELICIOUS!

This was okay. No emergency pizza while dumping it out uneaten, but we also didn't keep any of the leftovers.

Note from my previous review..I meant to say the roux and not béchamel.

I, too, was wondering how it could be rated "4 forks" with no reviews. Way too much onion, not enough spinach. The taste was overwhelming onion. It could also use an increase in the ricotta cheese. The béchamel sauce was skimpy too. The lasagna was okay, but certainly nothing special.

The recipe should have been called "Onion Lasagna." The 6 large required onion was too much and very over powering in this recipe. I would suggest reducing the onion to just 3 and doubling the spinach.

How on earth did Epi rate this recipe four forks when it has never been reviewed or rated.
