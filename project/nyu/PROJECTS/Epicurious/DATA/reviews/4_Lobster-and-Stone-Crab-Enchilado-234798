I used Dungeness crab in lieu of the stone crab, and removed the shells from the lobster prior to marinating ( I sauteed the shells and then poached in the clam juice, strained before adding to the mixture). Served with a thick slices of toasted Asiago ciabatta.

Loved...Loved...Love...this recipe! I used King crab legs,Shrimp and Lobster the firstime,instead of stonecrab...the second and third times I omitted the Lobster and added more crab & shrimp... (for cost reasons) it was wonderful, and everyone loves it!!!!

My husband and I thought this was very good but not exceptional. I followed the recipe exactly except I did not have crab. Served with a nice baguette and a salad with chevre for a simple spring dinner. Something to sop up the sauce is a must! It was a nice alternative to surf and turf or other standard uses of lobster tail.

I enjoyed this a great deal, even though, as it was a last minute recipe for me, I had to make some substitutions that may have changed the character of the recipe: instead of crab I put in some clams (I thought, as the recipe called for clam juice this would not be such far-fetched thing to do), and instead of the wine, I threw in a swig of rum.

I am giving this 4 forks because I it is definitely company worthy. However, it is VERY expensive. For the 2 of us about $30 for two 5 ounce lobster tails and 8 snow crab claws (about 8 ounces) so company will probably never see this from my kitchen. The enchilado is great and has fabo flavor. It needs to be served in a low soup bowl. I served it with crusty bread and a nice simple salad for a GOURMET Saturday night dinner.

...one more thing...in a traditional Cuban household, white "Cooking Wine" would be used. That is what my mother-in-law uses and her cooking is the real deal. She probably would have omitted the garlic, too, but I never would.

Delicious. We made it almost 100% to the recipe (rare for me) but we omitted the stone crab because it wasn't in season. This is a LOT for 2, we couldn't finish it. This is a Cuban recipe, so the white rice and fried plantains are traditional. Sliced avocado on the side would also be appropriate. I've had it in a restaurant over cheese grits and that is also good. We'll make it again, hopefully with the stone crabs and with some friends to share it with.

This is a great recipe. Will make it again.

Outstanding dish. I disagree with the rice as a side recommendation - this needs this needs thick hearty bread to sop up the delicious sauce. Great stuff.

Traditionally, my Cuban family uses shrimp, and occasionally we add lobster tail and king crab legs. I'm going to try your version, it looks amazing! This is one of my favorite dishes, and we're always trying new ways to make it.

My son Ryan and I went tide pooling yesterday at a secret spot along the San Diego coast near one of my favorite surf breaks. It was a -1.7 tide, one of the lowest tides of the year. We caught 3 lobsters and 4 crabs, came home and cooked them up using this recipe. It was one of the best dishes I have ever tasted. The crab and lobster had a briney taste just like the ocean we live near and love. We added some fresh new mexico green chilies to give it a litte extra kick!
