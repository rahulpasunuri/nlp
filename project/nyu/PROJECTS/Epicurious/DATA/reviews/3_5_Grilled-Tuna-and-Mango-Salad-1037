This was very good. I found the dressing a little milder than I expected but was a simple, very healthy weeknight dinner. If I make it again I'll maybe spice up the dressing with a little serano chili or a bit more vinegar.

Delicious & easy! Used basil instead of cilantro & added chopped romaine, avocado & feta cheese. Will definitely make again! Next time I'll add toasted pine nuts.

I made this as dexcribed, except I used olive oil also for brushing the tuna. It was very tasty and very easy.

This is a solid, quick and healthful weeknight meal in our house. I add avocado slices to the salad - I love the way they taste with the mango, and tuna and avocado is a great combination, as well. I often just make a dressing with lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper, but the rice vinegar is lovely, too. I add or omit the cilantro depending on whether it's in the house - it is not my favorite flavor.

Easy. Good enough to make again. We didn't have any green peppers, so I used one jalepeno.I also used vadelia onion as that was all we had on hand. My husband liked it, but even with the jalepeno, I still found it a bit bland. Since it had mango, I thought it would probably taste delicious with some bottled carribean hot sauce. Delicious! I look forward to trying some different variations of this simple recipe.

The mango salad is now one of my favorite things. I dropped the recipe at the grocery store and had to remember it when I got home. I used one-half of a medium-sized red onion. That was probably a little too much. But I really love this salad, and it complements the tuna (which I marinated in soy sauce, olive oil and garlic and which could still use some stronger seasoning, even just salt and lemon) beautifully. A great summer entree that's definitely a keeper.

This was a simple and delicious salad for the summer. The tuna and the mangos go perfectly together. My only advice is to not use very ripe mangos - salad becomes soupy.

Excellent summer dish. I took the marinade sugestions (cilantro, garlic & seasame oil) and it was wonderful! So quick and easy. I paired the dish with garlic & olive oil couscous then finished the meal with grilled nectarines topped w/ vanilla ice cream. This is one of those meals that completely satisfies your taste buds without leaving you overstuffed!

This salad is excellent. I used grilled halibut and it went well with a NZ sauvingion blanc. I will definitely make it again.

Crowd pleaser... every time. I have made it just like the recipe said and it was very very tasty (did decrease the amount of grilling time to 4 minutes each side). I will also try the suggestions about the marinade for the tuna next time. Really good... easy easy easy...tasty!

This is a nice summer dish that takes very little time to make. Taking heed about the fish being bland - I marinated it in sesame oil, cilantro and fresh garlic. It really added to the flavor.

We brushed yellowfin tuna with sesame oil and grilled the tuna while dicing and slicing the veg/fruit. Instead of using oil and vinegar,we drizzled the juice from one lime on the salad. It was great! I think the serving size is better for 2.

Beautiful and tasty dish. Perfect for outdoor dinner in summer! I marinated the tuna in soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, chopped green onion, sesame oil, and olive oil for 1 hour before grilling.

This is quick, easy and great! However, the amount of salad is not enough for a main - I'd suggest doubling it.

This is a great recipe! I was very pleaed with the combination of flavors. I used a teriaki and ginger marinade for the tuna. Every time I make this, everyone loves it.

Awesome, fresh and flavorful.. the peppery flavor of the mangos offset the tuna. DO make the salad ahead of time and let it marinate at room temperature!

This dish is easy to prepare and is enjoyed by everyone.I prepare the salad in advance and let the flavors marinate.

Wonderful - but I add tomatoes and a ripe avocado to the mango - the flavours are beautiful together and give a buttery melt in the mouth texture with the tuna. Make this everytime I have ripe avocados, mangos and fresh tuna on hand

I served this on 4/30/00, and it was a hit. The mango's flavor is refreshing but not dominant, and complements the taste of the tuna perfectly. The more coriander, the better.

I've made this dish several times, and just logged in to find it to make once again(after a break since last summer). It's interesting, different- the mango gives it an unexpected sweetness.Great for hot evenings.

This is a dish I have made over and over again, for family and guest, and it has been a hit every time. I usually marinate the tuna in a teriyaki type sauce and add fresh jalapenos to the mango salad.

Takes tuna into a completely different direction away from the trite and stale teriaki. Works supremely well with high quality sorbet and/or a Chateau D Yquem like dessert wine
