I made this for Super-Bowl. I wasn't sure how my guests would respond to "Lamb Chili". Guests were coming back for second and thirds!There were NO leftovers on this one. I did simmer it overnight and added flour to thicken just before serving. I did this to make the lamb very tender...crockpot style. People are still emailing me for the recipe!

I made this with chorizo and beef and a different kind of dried pepper. It was delicious and easy. Made the boys watching Sunday football happy, and coworkers as well. Next time I will get better quality meat.

I used 1.5 oz. chipotle chilis instead of ancho, because that's what the store had. I also used less lamb, because it was pricey, and added used 3 cans of beans instead of two. I also added tomatoes because it was too spicey, and seemed like the flavor would benefit. I'd say it did. The chipotles gave the chili a phenomenal smoky flavor and spice. It was really tasty. We served it for the Superbowl, with nachos alongside to dip in the chili.

I am a butcher. Ask your butcher for boneless lamb shoulder instead of the round bone chops. The round bones come from the shoulder but are really meant to be grilled. The boneless shoulder is ideal for braising and its cheaper besides.

I swapped the lamb for mince (cheaper), but kept everything else the same and it turned out amazing. My roommates couldn't resist.

As many reviewers have mentioned, this is quite a heavy dish. Surprisingly, the lamb was almost over-powering when I presented this at half-time of the Super Bowl. The next day, however, it tasted a bit more like "normal" chili, so perhaps making it a day in advance is the thing to do. It is an unusual combination of flavors, quite subtle when given time, and everyone loved it. I, however, would probably not make it again--not because it's not good, but because it was so heavy, and so spicy that I could barely eat any of it.

Make sure you use Spanish chorizo, not Mexican chorizo. The Spanish chorizo deepens the flavor and gives the dish umame, that rich, deeply satisfying, sensual taste. Also, throw in a tablespoon of summer savory. It compliments the Lamb's gaminess.

I'd give this 10 forks if I could. This was probably the best chili I've ever made, and I love chili. Found lamb chops on sale and couldn't believe how great they were in chili! I used one can each of hominy and pinto beans; next time I'll just use hominy for the really interesting texture. Also used half chorizo and half linguica; next time I'll go for all chorizo because the linguica added nothing and I love chorizo. Can't wait to enter this into a cookoff. WOW!!

The flavor combination here was outstanding! I ended up using ancho chili powder (from www.penzeys.com) and added 3 poblano chilis which I sauteed with the chorizo. I used about half the garlic, but also made a smaller batch using only half the lamb, chorizo and hominy (a must!).

I don't get it. I find this recipe not at all what I've read in previous reviews. I did use ground lamb, perhaps that's the difference, but it is just how with a lamb sweet undertone. All I can say is I will not be making this chili again. NEVER!

this one is a showstopper! fantastic combination of flavors, lots of depth. Everyone I've ever made it for raves about it.

We tried this receipe when we first saw it in 2000. Wow, a real kick--- great chili. Love lamb and thought it was scandalous to use in a chili but glad we did. Making it tonight for party tomorrow. We never have leftovers.

Yet another chili cookoff victory to add to the list for this recipe! We went with white hominy instead of beans.

I made several chili recipies from the Epicurious website (turkey and white bean, vegetarian) - all got good reviews from our guests, but this one disappeared the fastest. I used ground lamb instead of cubed, and cooked it off first to get rid of most of the fat. Also made a bit more of the Ancho chile-based sauce - seemed a little dry (probably because I used 3 lbs of ground lamb instead of the cubes - more surface area to coat with sauce). Finally, spiced it up a bit with chipotle chiles in adobo (to taste).

Phenomenal chili recipe. I, too, won a chili cook-off with this recipe. I didn't change a thing. Very rich, layered flavors and multi-dimensional. Also, very expensive to make. After all was said & done I spent approx. $50 bucks... but I won!

My husband has been making this recipe since it was first published in the magazine. He uses his homemade chorizo (adaptation of one from Bruce Aidells)---that may be the secret to our loving it! He also uses a mixture of chilies, always including at least one ancho.

Wow! I also don't have access to good lamb so I used pork tenderloin instead. I used one can of hominy and one can of pinto beans. I also added 3/4 bottle of dark beer (I used Negro Modelo)and can of diced tomatoes with mild green chiles (Hunts brand -- they also have other varieties of diced tomatoes that would work great in this recipe). I couldn't find the ancho chiles and didn't know enough about what was for sale to know whether I'd like it or not, so I went with a winner -- chipotle chilis in adobo sauce. You don't have to cook them. I used half of a 7 oz. can and simply added the chicken broth and pureed it. After cooking the chili I took it off of the heat and refrigerated overnight. The next morning I added the beans, hominy and tomatoes and put it into the oven at 300 degrees and baked it for 3 hours. The flavors blended marvelously, the tenderloin got so tender, it was so good I couldn't stop eating it. I was worried it might be too spicy but it's not -- just the right amount of good smoky heat (adobo and chirizo). All of my friends (some don't like spicy food) loved it as did my daughters who are VERY picky eaters. Make this chili. If you like chili, you'll love this recipe.

AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE!! I love the Aussies, "Bloody good recipe" :) Anywho, this recipe is a good variation of posole. If you get Mexican chorizo southern California style, the casing is plastic and the chorizo is a finely ground paste, so try for the Spanish kind. Portuguese Chorizo (chaurice? choris? choriz? forgot the spelling) or linguica are okay. Use the hominy. Get dried hominy and soak and cook it yourself if you can. Get good Aussie or New Zealand lamb if possible, the crap we raise here is too old and tastes like a friggin GOAT!! AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE!! :)

Fantastic chili! The authenticity derived from pureeing real chilies is unbeatable. I used New Mexico chilis (there were about 5 different kinds at the store, but no anchos! And so I decided on these, listed as "medium hot"), added about 3/4 bottle of dark beer and a can of tomatoes (just as previous reviewers recomments), and used 1/2 hominy and 1/2 pinto beans. It is by far the most delicious chili I've ever tasted. Who knew that lamb and chorizo were such a delightful combination? I can't recommend this highly enough, but would add a word of caution--it's REALLY spicy. Great if you like that (which my husband and I do), but if not, probably a good idea to add only half of the homemade chili sauce initially, and then more incrementally to taste. YUM!

Brought home the office Chili Cook-off title with this recipe. Fried a couple slices of bacon before adding the chorizo, and mixed pork butt with the lamb. Can't add too many beans -- can double the amount (and kidney beans work well too). Highly recommend adding sugar along with salt to taste, to add some depth, which is blunted by the anchos.

This recipe won second place in my firm's Chili Cook-off probably due to it's different and complex flavor. I followed the recipe to the letter (lamb shoulder and beef chorizo) and might change up some of the ingredients if I make it again. Overall I found that it was quite rich and most tasters could not eat more than a small amount - which for a chili contest is good, but for everyday cooking perhaps not as good.

This was absolutely awsome! All the guys at work were actually sneaking around so they could get more. I'm going to have to make another pot because others didn't get any and are a bit peaved. Just some thoughts about this recipe, I was concerned about there not appearing to be enough liquid. It just looked like it would be meat and the liquid would reduce to nothing, but it was just right. I also did one can hominy and one can beans, instead of all one. I served with mexican style sour cream and fresh tortillas. I didn't really mess with this recipe, because it was perfect.

Well in so many words this chili was a hit! I made it for a company Chili Cook Off and it was a unanimous first choice. This contest wasn't anything special but there were 9 other chili's to choose from with 5 random judges. I pretty much followed the recipe except I used a shoulder of pork instead of lamb. I also added the 4 arbol chilis, previous recomendation, and the can of diced tomatoes. Turned out great! Hope this inspires others to flag this recipe. This was one nice chili with a kick.

Great! I will never use store-bought Chili powder in my Chilis again! Oregano, Cumin, Chilis = chili powder. Because I like a bit more heat, I added 4 or 5 dried, seeded Arbol chilis to the initial chili/broth mix. This sated my desire for hotter foods. I used beef rather than lamb, because my area only occasionally has decently priced lamb. The beer addition was good, of course. I found that I needed to simmer for more than an hour to properly tenderize the beef shoulder that I used, and hence needed more liquid. Unable to locate golden hominy, I used one 20 oz. can of white hominy (important for thickening) and one 16 oz. can of pintos. (I usually prefer to use my own cooked beans, but time-saving won this round). The flavors were very well balanced, and I think this chili could win a local contest, certainly.

Delicious! Hominy is important...adds nice texture. Took the advice of other reviewers and added a can of diced tomatoes (15oz) and 1/2 bottle of Harp. Great additions - each helped to make it a moister chili (especially once the hominy was added). Next time will try with pork or beef instead of lamb. Very expensive for a chili!

Thank you, Epicurious.com!! Imagine my horror upon searching my recipe collection to find that my fave chili recipe was missing!! This is the one and only for me! My husband didn't even like chili til he had this. I've done w/o the chorizo and it's still great; but don't leave out the hominy. sub'd chipotle for ancho..perfect! Toss in a bit of chocolate & cinnamon, too. Cilantro & sour cream are a must!

Delicious! I added 5 whole fresh tomatoes and used 4 fresh poblano chili peppers instead of dried anchos. This tasted more like an East Indian stew to me than a chili. I will try it with potatoes or cauliflower instead of beans the next time.

Delicious! I used 3/4lb chorizo, and added considerabley less fat drippings (about 1Tbsp as opposed to 1/4 cup)... I thought the lamb made it plenty savory. Also, didn't realize I was out of cumin until it was too, late... I think it turned out better without it. Also took advice from the others and added 1/2 bottle of Bass Ale... wonderful!

Delicious chili. I thought the idea of hominy in chili was strange, but tried it anyway. It added a really interesting texture. Having grown up in Texas, I'm pretty picky about chili, and this one makes the grade.

One of the best chili recipes I've made. Experiment with the type of dried chilies to make it more or less spicy. I've used ancho, new mexico, negro and combinations of these. I also like to use tortilla chips as my fork or spoon!

Wonderful dish, just loved it!! I did not want to make this spendy dish so I substituted pork, I felt that it was a good compliment to the chorizo. Otherwise I made it exactly the way the recipe was written. Good job epicurious!

This is a very interesting dish -- I eliminated the cayenne pepper so it wasn't too spicy. I also found it a little dry so I added a can of diced tomatoes to make it a little moister.

Last weekend we were the first of 4 other couples to arrive at a beautiful Lake Tahoe home rented for our annual ski retreat. Since we were the first in the house and the storm was just coming in we began preparing this recipe for our friends' arrivals. It was spicy and delicious. We served it with cornbread and a tossed salad. Everyone raved, except for a few who were not used to our hot & spicy tastes.
