Made this for my sister's b'day and everyone loved it! Great presentation. Used zest of one lemon and Gran Marnier. (I might make it without the cardamom next time.) Watch the cake carefully as it's very easy to over cook. Also, use toothpicks to keep it from sliding apart as you assemble -- all that cream can make it slippery!

I've done this cake before, never with cardamom or muscat wine I've been using ron... But Cardamom really make the difference. I made it yesterday and when I got to the store and saw the price on that spice I was like WHAT!!!! 11.50 USD! I'm from Mexico, so for me that is very expensive on a spice.. there you find fres cardamom leaves for less than a Dollar, anyways, I made it for my Boyfriend, we had it for dinner desert and we both loved it!!!!! the directions are very clear Loved it!!! It does take a while to do it, so be prepared to enjoy baking for at least 2hrs.

I made this cake for my brother's birthday (in the summer) and it was a huge hit! I would say that I'm an intermediate baker. There were many steps to the recipe, since you need to make the cakes, syrup, and cream (and cut the strawberries), but the instructions were very clear and the end result was better than I hoped for-- a light, fluffy, slightly sweet, wonderful cake! I didn't want to go out and buy the wine, so I just used water and made a simple syrup with added cardamom. The cake was still delicious.

I just made this for a friend's party and it was a smashing success! I tweaked it a little by adding all the zest from one large lemon. Another tweak was that I used creme fraiche instead of heavy cream and sour cream. It was fantastic - thick, creamy and tart with wonderful spreadable consistency. Everyone loved the lightness of the cake. It is so easy to make and so pretty. I can't wait to try it with peaches later in the summer and definitely will use creme fraiche again.

Whats' the big deal with others saying this is difficult to make? I was going to make a strawberry shortcake for my sister-in-law for her home weekend visit from Maryland...and I wanted it to be extra special, so I turned to Gourmet, as always, and here I am writing this review! Even if you haven't had a lot of experience with egg whites before, it most certainly is easy in the required steps. I couldn't find Muscat Beaumes de- Venise or Essenia, so I used Grand Marnier instead. This cake is beautiful when done. Even the cakes, while cooling, had a very nice color and were pretty. And not to mention, exceptionally soft. I did add something to the recipe, though: after the very last step and everything was completed, I drizzled a little of the syrup over the top. The result? Absolutely gorgeous. Amazing taste. Bon Appetit! Thank you, Gourmet.

A beautiful cake, perfect for late spring! I didn't have any Muscat so I used a Late Harvest Reisling instead - superb. Everyone loved it, from the 3 year old birthday boy who requested it, to his 7 year old sibling and all the grown-ups. I would definitely make this once a year, come strawberry season.

This was a big hit at Easter,and I would absolutely again. I'm not a big cardamom fan, so I used a ginger syrup instead, which worked great. The best thing about this cake is that it is just sweet enough. A great cake for adults and kids alike.

I was looking for a recipe for strawberry shortcake and decided to make this..delicious!! Don't leave out the cardamom syrup (sounds a little weird, but was a nice flavor). The cake turned out light, but I also used my electric mixer to beat the egg yolks. Made this the first time for company for Easter as a prelude to my nieces bridal shower. Definitely a keeper!!

I'm a rather novice cook and this wasn't too difficult to figure out. Turned out really well and everyone at my dinner party loved it. Will definitely make it again.

Sorry, the review i wrote below was for a different cake, the picture looks the same but it is a different cake. Dont mind me lol

I did not like the cake after i made it. the cream cheese frosting and the bland tasting cake just didnt do it for me. However, i let it sit over nght and the next day i COULD NOT get enough of this. Maybe you have to let the flavors meld a little before you eat it, just my preference. I usually LOVE cream cheese frosting, i just feel like the cake was missing something in the beginning. It is very light though, so that is a plus if you dont want a heavy dessert. Very good :)

Made this a few times w/out the cardamom syrup and everyone loves this recipe. and the kids love cooking this one, all the different layers.

this recipe is not nearly as hard as other comments make. i think where others go wrong, complaining that their cakes are as dense as pancakes, is that they are not beating their eggwhites until they hold stiff glossy peaks. it's a fine line to beat too little or too much and then of course you'll end up with poundcake. all in all it turned out great and is an excellent summer dessert!

Amateur bakers beware: this is not a simple cake to bake. I followed the recipe carefully twice, with tips from experienced bakers. I measured my oven temperature, I made sure the whites were yolk-free, I folded as carefully as I could. But all I got were pancakes. There are much simpler strawberry cream cakes out there. This may not be the one to try.

I'm midway through making this cake and already something seems off - the cakes came out more like pancakes than the inch-high layers shown in the photo. They didn't spread out in the pan at all. Could something be missing from the ingredient list?

This was great. Next time I will need to make sure to soak the cakes in the syrup properly--I was too light with it so I ended up with leftover syrup, and when I served the cake I realized that it hadn't absorbed much. Really nice flavors, though.

I did something wrong. I know it. But I don't know what it was. I couldn't even begin with the syrup and the filling. The cakes were awfull! All ''eggy'' tasting and the consistency was gooey and not cakey like, too thin and crunchy on the edges. Please help me because from what I've read here it is a great recipe and I would really love try it. I followed the recipe to a T and still no good. Perhaps I beat the egg whites too long?

Really tasty, makes a pretty cake.Cake smells divine out of oven!!! Better taste (cake was moister) next day though, but good first day too. Really needed extra strawberries I thought, so added some macerated ones on the side. Sadly, couldn't taste the wine (a nice quality muscat - couldn't find orange muscat, so subbed regular muscat and orange zest. Next time I might try grand marnier too for more orange-ness. Couldn' taste cardomon either, but it did have a nice, pleasant overall flavor. However, for the effort (moderate), there are a few better strawberry desserts in my opinion. The whipped cream and cake are good standard recipes that I will use again though.

This cake is sooooo good! Although I make it without the syrup, it's still a huge crowd pleaser. The cake is especially great for the summer because it isn't too sweet and it's relatively light.

This cake was excellent and very impressive. Everyone absolutely loved it! Next time, however, I will substitute for the Grand Marnier. Way too expensive.

As noted by other reviewers, this cake was certainly well received! The cake was easy to make and relatively uncomplicated to assemble. I didn't use the muscat as recommended in the recipe because of how much it cost. Instead, I got a bottle of Arbor Mist strawberry flavored white Zinfendel (can't beat the price at $3.99/bottle) and reduced it as directed with the sugar and cardamom, but also added the zest of one orange to infuse it with some orange flavor, and it worked wonderfully!

I too found the sauce didn't thicken so I kept on boiling for about 30 minutes and it then turned into a fairly unspreadable 'goo'! Could probably get away without the muscat sauce if needs be. Delicious all the same and am definately going to try this one again.

My son found this recipe and requested it for his 11th birthday party. Boy, was it a hit! And that's saying something since it fed a bunch of pre-teen boys! I made it exactly as written. Very easy, and the cardamom syrup was delicious! We had a bit of syrup left over and dunked our extra strawberries in it. Tasty!

I just made this cake for my sisters birthday. I really hate store bought strawberry cream cake but she wanted one just like it so I grudgingly search for a similar recipe. This cake turned out spectacular! Much better then I had expected. The cardomom syrup is what sets it apart from the boring store bought versions. I used triple sec in place of the muscat. It turned out perfect and triple sec is much less expensive then the wine or grand marnier. Give the cake a try!

I made two of these for a large dinner party last night and they were fantastic. The syrup makes all the difference. I made one with the syrup as written and another with a reduced orange juice, sugar syrup for the kids -- they were both perfect. Don't oversugar the whipped cream.

I was a bit disappointed-- it's good, but I had pretty high expectations based on the other comments below. It can also be a bit messy to serve-- also, don't let it sit around more than an hour or so after assembling.

A showy dessert- pretty to look at and great to eat! I first baked one as a thank you gift for neighbors. My family sobbed quietly as the cake left the building, so I made another one the next day.

I used Grand Marnier also and it was better the next day. Made it virgin for work and had no left-overs. I plan on playing with flavorings and fruit combos. Strawberry-mocha could be wonderful. What about apricots?

This was superb! Used Grand Mariner and it was excellent. Almost better the second day. It was not a difficult recipe, either. Next time I'd add more strawberries.

Since cardamom is a member of the ginger family, why not try using ginger? I have done it for other recipes. This is just a suggestion for the cook from Los Angeles. I made this cake yesterday for Easter. It looks and tastes a lot like a trifle. It is delicious, but I have tasted better trifle.

Recipe is delicious, very easy to make and a big hit at our familys last get together. I would wait to put it together one hour prior to serving. I'm not a big fan of cardamom but you can hardly taste it. To my surprise, I found the Essencia at Beverages & More. I'm making it again for Easter.

Any ideas on a substitute for cardamon? I am not a fan of it. I wonder what other spice would work with the strawberies? Finely chopped mint?

What a wonderful dessert. It is definitely a hit. I made it for my sister's baby shower. By the way, for the reader who does not want to go out and by the muscat. There are other recipes you can use this for, such as pouring over some fruit and/or flambe. Also, have you considered drinking it with this dessert.

I have made this recipe and one similar for years for birthday parties and spring occasions. Good substitutes for the Muscat syrup would be Cointreau, Grand Marnier, or for an intense orange hit, I have used melted orange juice concentrate blended with 2T of unsalted butter.

I don't really want to go out and buy a bottle of Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise or Essensia for just one recipe. What would be a good substitute for that?
