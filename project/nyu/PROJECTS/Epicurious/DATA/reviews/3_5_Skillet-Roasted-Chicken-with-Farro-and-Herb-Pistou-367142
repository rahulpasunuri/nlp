Judy15, it's completely unfair to rate a recipe you haven't even made. The chicken is not intended to stand alone, but to be complemented by the other ingredients. To only make one part of the recipe and then give it a bad review is like reviewing a chocolate cake when you've left out the butter, sugar and flour.

It isn't too much work if you already have a Sous Vide : )

I marinated the chicken but when it came time to cook it, I just couldn't put myself through all the work required to poach it. So, I popped the chicken in the oven and roasted it as I usually do. It was delish!! The herb pistou was a nice touch. Perhaps I will try this method one day when I have more time.

This was just ok and way too labor intensive for mediocre results. I only made the chicken part and have many superior chicken recipes.

It tasted great, but was too labor intensive for the 2-4 servings the recipe makes. However, the replication of the sous vide process for home cooks was an interesting science experiment. I would make the farro again on it's own.

I made this and wrote about it in my blog: http://bmoresara.wordpress.com/2011/08/22/sunday-afternoon-in-the-kitchen/ Bottom line: Tasty, but an awful lot of work. Plan ahead and make it a party.
