Oops. I realized that my aunt's recipe was slightly different after re-reading this recipe (I wish you could read the recipe while writing a review). Anyway, she would use a package of cream cheese instead of mayonnaise and yogurt. Totally different result I'm sure, but it's firm not runny (though there might be some juices to drain off after letting it marinate overnight). You can also substitute canned chicken if the tuna is too "fishy".

My aunt has been making this recipe for years (without the yogurt) and would serve it at Thanksgiving time. I remember that it was supposed to refrigerate overnight in a covered bowl, and the juices would help marinate the ball (she would roll the dip into a ball and cover it with the parsley). Just drain the juice before serving. The dip was always firm and would need a knife for spreading. However, her recipe differed in that it didn't use yogurt. Perhaps reducing or omitting the yogurt would help the texture problem.

I've been making this for years. I used Tuna packed in water and omitted the yogurt. You could substitute with Sour Cream. I've also tried it with some white beans added to the puree. Yummy!

Nothing special, but for how quick this comes together, it's great. Next time I'll double the horseradish, though.

Sorry I haven't made this yet though it sounds delicious. I just wanted to make a suggestion regarding running. In that situation I usually let my yogurt sit in a collander until most of the liquid has drained off. That usually does the trick.

This was a weird dip in both taste and texture. The best thing I can say about it is that some people mistook it for hummus. Kind of pasty, overly "fishy" even with good-quality tuna. Skip it.

Add a few drops of liquid smoke for a wonderful taste! I've made it several times and it disappears every time.

Easy as pie!! I tripled the recipe for a party. I used some ranch dresing instead of sour cream and tuna in water with good results. I also ran out of parsley so I used some fresh basil to make up the difference.

Miracle Whip??? AHHHHHHH-YUCK!!! The taste of Miracle Whip is nothing like mayo. Don't go that route!

Great dip. I also like cottage cheese in place of yogurt, and I use tuna packed in water. The best way to drain the horseradish is to literally squeeze it between your fingers--messy, but works well.

I tested this out with my housemates before deciding to make it for a party. I made sure to drain the tuna well (as everyone had suggested), but I found that I didn't have any plain yogurt so I used cottage cheese. No problems with it being too runny, and everyone loved it! I'm going to stick with the cottage cheese and maybe add some minced radish for a bit of texture. Very yummy as is, though!!

I tried adding chopped cucumber,chopped black olives and very finely chopped radish. Be sure to drain very well.

Terrific potential here, although it isn't quite there yet, in my opinion. I increased the horseradish after making it to the letter, because the tuna overpowered the flavor of the horseradish (I could barely tell it was there). Xscorpiox was right; despite draining the tuna and horseradish well, it still came out a bit runny. Next time I'm going to add cucumber pieces for a bit of crunch. Anyone else have any variations? The possibilities are limitless!

Great tangy dip. Good for poker or ball games! Be sure to drain tun & horseradish very dry or it turns out runny.
