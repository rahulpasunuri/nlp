Definately would have benefited from garlic in addition to the chilli flakes and rosemary. Interesting way to make game hens, but I felt that it was a variation on fried chicken alla game hen and wasn't anything exceptional. Not sure if I would make it again.

My husband and I love this!! It's so easy and very tasty. I don't get the fumes at all - just a wonderful, mouth-watering smell!!!!!

Good stuff, but it'll kick up major peppery fumes. Cooking it in my small apartment left all my gusts rubbing their eyes and coughing. So, make sure your vent fan is going, and preferably keep the fumes from your guests.

I marinate boneless chicken breasts in the oil/herb mixture and grill them over a low flame for 3-4 minutes per side.

I modify this recipe by adding garlic finely chopped with the red pepper and rosemary, and butterfly the game hens before marinating and grilling with a weighted on top. They make an elegant and tasty room temperature dish for picnics at Tanglewood.

I make this ALL THE TIME. It is so good. If you are in a hurry, don't bother marinating for a full hour. Instead of a brick, I put a heavy cast iron pot (Le Creuset) with another cast iron pot inside of it, both filled with water.

This is a WONDERFUL dish - It is easy and impressive and has become a meal that I make and crave often!

I made this last night for friends, using chicken instead of game hens, and it was great! It did generate some peppery fumes, but a better exhaust fan would have helped me. It was very easy and I'll definitely make it again.
