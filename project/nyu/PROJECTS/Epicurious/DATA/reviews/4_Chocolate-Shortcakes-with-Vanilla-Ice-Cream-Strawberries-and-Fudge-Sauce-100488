I made this dessert following a BBQ with friends. It was soooo good. The chocolate shortcake was soft and perfect. Paired with the ice cream and strawberries and the bittersweet fudge sauce made a perfect combination. Tremendous, planning on making this again for family next week!

very good. i used milk chocolate for the fudge sauce because i have been burned before when using bittersweet, and it came out great. party of six all members of the clean plate club.

A sinfully delicious chocolate delight! Shortcake dough is rather sticky and difficult to handle, so use plenty of flour on your rolling surface and hands.
