Super quick and delicious sauce. I added 1lb of farfalle to the sauce, I recommend that if you do this, make extra sauce or use less pasta. I would make this again.

This is a very simple sauce that can be made in less than one half hour. The fennel really adds to the sauce. While this is not my favorite sauce, its great if you are short of time or would just like a change of pace. In the future I would use 3 teaspoons of marjaram instead of 4. Its a keeper!
