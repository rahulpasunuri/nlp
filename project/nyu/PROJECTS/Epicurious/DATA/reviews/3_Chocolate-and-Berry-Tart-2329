This was a hit at an open house where I was asked to bring several desserts. This one was demolished quickly with plenty of requests for the recipe. I did not make the sauce and no one seemed to miss it. Will try it again with the sauce next time.

I spared the time of fussing with one of the steps and bought pre-shaped, frozen puff pastry cups. I made it hours in advance and it worked well, but next time I'll try to make it closer to the meal. The chocolate mixture was my favorite, and while I didn't care for the sauce, my boyfriend was crazy for it. Easy enough, fresh and great for summer. He's already asked me to make it again.

A few steps, but very simple. Looks most impressive and tastes great. I didn't, however, try the sour cream and creme de casis sauce.
