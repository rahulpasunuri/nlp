I've made this dish so many times, and always to raves--"best fish I ever ate" is common. The amount of marinade is enough for 4-5 times the amount of fish. To those using sea bass instead of cod...please, black cod is not the same as "regular", northern cod. Not a cod at all in reality, actually sablefish, it has a completely different texture and flavor than cod. Very high in fat content, lots of EFAs (more than salmon). Lovely flakes, incredibly tender, wonderful flavor. Sea bass is nothing like it and not nearly as good.

awesome- tastes just like eating at Nobu. I used Chilean Sea Bass

This is a fantastic dish and so simple to make. I highly recommend letting it sit for 2-3 days. It will not spoil if properly stored an only enhances the tenderness of the fish. Definitely makes difference. I've tried various methods for cooking; broiling, BBQ, baking - but the best is Sous vide - this dish was made for sous vide.

Hands down, this was a hit. After reading the reviews, I chose to use sea bass instead of cod. It was pricey, but my boyfriend would say well worth it. :) I let the fish marinate overnight, and opted to grill the fish rather than cook it inside (take advantage of the beautiful October weather in Atlanta). I simply put some foil down and cooked the fish at about 400 for 10-15 minutes (until it reached about 145 degrees internally), and it was done. Couldn't have been easier! I paired the miso sea bass with ginger/garlic bok choy and soba noodles. The bok choy wasn't a fan favorite, but overall, a great meal. I would recommend wiping down the fish after pulling it out of the marinade, as the recipe suggests. This allows the sauce to caramelize on the fish, but not so much that you get the "candied fish" effect one reviewer reported. My boyfriend also mentioned it would have been nice to have a sauce to go with the finished fish, so that is something to think about too. Will definitely make this again - delicious!!

Really good dish; but I think it needs some tweaking. My 5 cents :) * Use seabass, goes better with the recipe than normal cod * Use lemon while baking (not in the marinade) to give the dish a more balanced flavour * Don't heat the oven at 200°C (400°F) as it will dry out the fish too much. If the fish isn't thick you can even skip the oven. It's important that the fish isn't overcooked.

how much sake?

Rating: 3
I did like this recipe, and it is very easy to make, however I would recommend the follow changes. 1 - in the Saikyo Miso section, the recipe lists 4 ingredients; Sake, Mirin, Miso paste and sugar. Ignore the Sake. Mirin is sweetened Sake, and since the recipe calls for adding more sugar to the mirin and burning off the alcohol, it makes no sense to add the Sake. 2 - The quantity of the Saikyo Miso the recipe makes is too much for the amount of fish stated - add 50% more fish. 3 - some reviews have called this candied fish, and this comes from the step "Lightly wipe off any excess miso clinging to the fillets but don't rinse it off". This step is crucial to having a well balanced dish. The excess Miso needs to be scraped off with a fork for this dish to work. The Miso is REALLY SWEET. All in all an easy fish dish with a unique taste.

I have made this dish several times and it is a delightful and simple recipe. The flavour complements the buttery texture of the fish.

This tasted absolutely delicious, and I had to make a few alterations -- I used mostly white miso but also a little red miso, no problem. I reduced sugar by 1/4 c according to other reviewers. I scraped off the extra miso paste with a paper towel, not wanting it to be too salty or sweet. Then I broiled it at 400 degrees in the oven for 10 minutes, and it was perfectly cooked with a lovely caramelized top. Everyone raved!! Easy and delish. However, WARNING WARNING WARNING: OPEN YOUR WINDOWS!! I had a rather foul fish smell that lingered in the house for four days, yikes!! (It's still cold in Wisconsin, so I can't really air out the kitchen yet.) I think the mix of fish with fermented beans makes for a pretty potent odor. I'm surprised no other reviewer mentioned this. I might try the recipe again, but I will grill the fish outside and eat it outdoors too!

After making this recipe at least 10 times, this is my no fail go to dish to impress, even when I have approximated measurements. I find it extremely difficult to find black cod in my area, so I often use Chilean sea bass instead. I find that the sea bass cooks a lot faster, and I simply skip the baking step altogether to get tender, juicy fish. Here are the steps I found for a similar recipe using sea bass: Preheat broiler. Remove fish from marinade. Place fish on rimmed baking sheet. With broiler door slightly open, broil fish 6 inches from heat source until just opaque in center, about 6 minutes. I usually know it's done when the top is golden brown all over, which takes just about 6 minutes.

This recipe was a huge disappointment for me. Maybe I had my expectations too high based on all of the rave reviews but I was really looking forward to trying this. I couldn't find black cod so I used sea bass but I don't think that was the issue. I found the white miso and the mirin and I cut way back on the sugar as others had suggested but this was just too sweet for us. My husband ate 2 bites and quit. I was so sad, especially after what I spent on the ingredients!

Black Cod has more healthy Omega 3's than Salmon according to Dr. Andrew Weil. I have had this dish numerous times at NOBU including the week after making this recipe. I marinated the Black Cod for about 5 hours instead of two days and in comparision to the restaurant version it is a bit less rich..but to my palate...better. Also, the recipe doesn't say how much sake to add to the mirin...I used about 1/2 cup and boiled for a few minutes. It was one of the best fish dishes ever! I served with wok stir fried baby bok choy with wild mushrooms on steamed brown rice. Yum!

This was delicious, albeit I used the same ingredients, just changed the measurements a little. And I didn't marinate it for 2 days - who has time for that. I marinated for 6 hours. Still delicious. Next time I'll try to do it before I go to work and marinate for longer. I used 1/4 sake, same amount for miren as recipe, 1.5 c shiro miso, and 3/4 c fine sugar (to help it dissolve a little better/faster). Marinade was simple to make. Then I threw it in the broiler for 10 minutes, then the oven for 10 minutes at 400. Will make again!

This is soooo good. I had some doubts about the two-day marinade, generally like to cook my fish right off the boat, but the texture was sublime and the subtle flavor of the miso was right through the fish, not overpowering it but highlighting the unctuousness. My husband absolutely loved it. I used about equal parts sake and mirin. There was way more than enough of the miso mixture, kept some in a jar, thinking it might work on chicken. Anyone use it on anything other than fish?

Just excellent! I've now made this several times (I cut the recipe in 1/4 for two people). The miso blends so nicely with the delicate flavor of the fish. I've never marinated the fish for the amount of time called for - a few hours still yields a wonderfully-flavored meal!

Rating: 4
I've made this twice, once according to the recipe, and once marinating only a few hours. While good both ways, they are not the same dish. With only a few hours in the marinade, the black cod retained its usual character and the super-sweet sauce retained its. So it was nothing unexpected. But after 2 days of steeping, it turned into something quite unique-- the texture of the fish changed and the taste of the miso disappeared and the whole was something special. I would recommend steeping for 2 days to experience the remarkable change that happens to this dish. I cooked for a total of 12 minutes, 6 under the broiler and 6 at 400 degrees. Do wipe off all the excess sauce. It does not add anything to the dish and is too sweet if left on. The recipe makes enough sauce for 4 lbs of black cod. I used 3/4 cup sake (or equal parts mirin and sake).

Rating: 4
I tried this and really like it but I made a few alternations as well: I added about 1/4 c of sake although a little more would have worked fine. I also cut the sugar by half and next time I'll cut it even more, mostly because I want it to just hint at sweetness not overtake it. I also added one very large garlic clove to the marinate when I added the miso. I had about 2 lbs of black cod and felt I had way too much marinade so next time I'll halve the recipe entirely. I served this on top of my version of Japanese fried rice: you'll need: cooked rice, half an onion, some kind of meat (try, bologna or hot dog, or go without), fresh cilantro, 1-2 eggs. To make: 1 1/2 cups uncooked rice, 2 cups water, cook according to your rice maker instructions. The older the rice, the better so if you can make the rice a couple of days ahead and then put it in your frige, the better. For the fried rice, I start with around 2 Tbs or so of oil, saute half an onion until softened, remove to a bowl, add rice and saute until softened, remove to a bowl, add some chopped meat of your preference (some people like to add more meat than others, but I typically used one all beef hot dog). Make sure you chop it very very small. Cook until heated through, remove to another bowl. Add the rice back in with the onion and meat and saute together. Add some chopped ciltranto. Beat 1-2 eggs lightly. Push the rice over to one side of the pan and add the egg, stirring it to scramble it. When it's just becoming cohesive, start incorporating it gently into the rice mixture. Once incorporated, sprinkle with whatever seasonings you like, I usually use a little pepper. Then add about 2 Tbls (or more) of soy sauce and a little squirt of ketchup. Taste and adjust your seasonings.

I made this dish, but cut the sugar in half -- the sweetness still came through. I sauteed the fish instead of baking so it would caramelize a bit more (make sure to use a non-stick pan and film it with oil). Everyone raved -- served it with a soba noodle salad (soba noodles, sesame oil, ponzu, cucumbers, mint, red pepper flakes and scallions - yum!) This is a keeper.

This recipe is as great as it is flexible. If you stick to it, is fabulous. However, I have experimented by adding a bit of grated ginger, garlic, and green onions to the marinade - excellent variations. I usually serve it with braised bok choi on the side. Also, I had a variation of this in a japanese restaurant where the skin was left on, and it was crisped as if fried. My own attempts at getting the skin crisp have not been successful, but when I get black cod with the skin on, I bake the whole fish in this sauce and it helps keep the fish together (black cod - or butterfish - is very tender and falls apart easily). A must-try recipe.

Disappointing to say the least. I used 1/2 c of sake; red miso (all I could find) and marinated it for a day before wiping the fish & cooking it. Blech! I must have missed some secret step.

I have had this dish many times at Nobu and it is always a favorite so when I decided to make it on my own - I thought "fat chance". However I was wrong - we followed the recipe and it was amazing and almost exactly the way it is in the resturant. The only difference is that we only marinated fish for about 4 hours as opposed to days but it was very flavorful. Also - we only baked the fish for about 8 minutes after broiling it and it was perfect. When broiling - get it to the point of a nice light brown. Highly recommend this dish,

I broiled mine until done as opposed to baking after, the crusty, carmelized top is the best!

Excellent recipe! Fell in love with the dish at Nobu's Malibu and Bev Hills locations. Best thing about the recipe is the simplicity...very easy to make, especially for a dinner party. The minimal prep can be done 1-2 days before (no need to marinade for more than 1 day) and simply bake/broil for a few minutes to complete the dish. Have made this for several dinner parties and everyone always insists this is the best fish they have every tasted. FYI - The white miso can be difficult to find even in a area heavily influenced with Asian groceries. The red miso works just fine.

Phenomenal. Guests raved about it. I doubled the number of black cod filets to serve 8 but kept the marinade amount the same. In the flurry of the dinner party, I accidentally baked it first and then broiled it...still perfect. I doubted myself every step of the way on this one though, being unfamiliar with both cooking fish and with cooking Japanese food. For others like me, here are some helpful hints: miso paste is sold in the refrigerated section, mirin is not sold in liquor stores but in the grocery store (the "rice wine" bit threw me), leave the skin on the fish to cook. The marinade looks, smells and tastes like you are making a huge mistake - persevere...the end result is so good. Can't wait to make it again.

I used less sugar and marinated for 2 days. I served it with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes. My husband loved it. I liked it, but didn't love it, largely because I think black cod is such an exquisite-tasting fish on its own and I vaguely resented the marinade for overpowering the flavour. I will try it again with a stronger-flavoured, less hard to obtain fish, like salmon.

There seems to be some general comments that kept repeating, and I wanted to provide my variation. The miso mixture can be made and then stored in the refrigerator for up to a year. I cook for two, and find this is a great way of having something on hand to whip up. Second, on most occassions I purchase my cod in the morning, come home and dunk the fish in the marinade, and then cook it that same day for dinner. I find that there is not much change in flavor, rather the texture of the fish is different than that of a 2/3 day marinated cod. My boyfriend and I actually prefer the lighter marinated fish (about 6-8 hours). Hope this encourages those singles with little time to try this out. It really is a wonderful dish!

There is a restaurant in Dallas called Tei Tei Robata that makes the most delicious sea bass. We've all tried to reproduce that recipe and I think that this comes closest.

i used a half a cup of sake, and only one cup of sugar, and it was supurb. a few notes ... you can use only part of the marinade and reserve the rest. it stays well in the refrigerator for at least two months. this marinade is as good with salmon as it is iwth the black cod. and as stated by others, the white miso is a must. this marinade is my staple for entertaining on short notice. i double the recipe and always keep some in the refrigerator.

Do take the effort to try the Black Cod (aka Sablefish) and not another fish - the texture is beyond compare. And not to mention how easy. "Four forks" is just not enough, I would have to give it ten forks to describe how much better it is than other four-fork recipes. I will dream about this one.

This is a relatively easy to make recipe and brings great results. Make sure you use white miso and not the yellow kind; otherwise it'll turn out salty.

First, use about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of sake. Second, if you follow this recipe and use WHITE miso and marinate as directed it will not be too salty. Third, use black cod, not regular cod if you don't want it to overcook. Also, you can broil the fish before your guests come and then finish in the over right before serving. Perfect.

The recipe was good. I used 1/2 the amount of marinade and that was more than enough. Instead of cod I substited chilean sea bass. The last time I made this recipe I left in marinade for over 24 hours and that was too long. This time I left only for 3 hours and it tasted great.

Aside from the advance preparation, this recipe was laughably easy and turned out great. I used regular cod and only marinated it for 36 hrs. Don't skimp on the broiling out of fear of overcooking it. The brown caramelized parts on the top are by far the tastiest part of the dish. However, I had to yank the cod after baking for 5 minutes because it was already slightly overdone. My only concern is that it's a little wasteful - since you can't boil miso, you need to either use sushi-grade fish or throw away the copious marinade.

This was very good. I used cod and cooked it for the recommended time, and it came out way to overdone. I would say to bake it a little bit less, especially if you broil it first. Otherwise it was a good recipie and turned out very well. It was also a very easy/quick recipie. Marinate it the night before and you can have dinner on the table within 20-30 minutes the next night.

I've had this dish at Nobu several times and it's one of my favorite dishes. However, I made it at home and it didn't come out the same. It could be that the miso they used is different but I would suggest that you don't need to steep the fish for 2-3 days. The fish absorbs a lot of flavor even in just a few hours. I only did it overnight and it came out really salty. So 5 hours would do it.
