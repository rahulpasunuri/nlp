This recipe is missing 3 T. of sugar from the ingredients in the filling that is included in the original version in the magazine. We thought it was delicious/

I made this for New Years Eve. Instead of individual tarts, made one large tart. Had a lot of extra filling which I piped around the edge. Made it the day before and it set up very nice. Everyone thought it was delicious and very light. Will make again.

This recipe was a flop! The biscotti mixture did not form well, as it was just too crumbly. The cheesecake mixture did not solidify, even though I refrigerated it for more than 4 hours. What a disappointment!

This is awesome! I have made it as individual tartlets or as one larger one and everyone always loves it! so creamy and absolutely luscious! Have topped with other sliced fruits as well, Kiwi, Blueberries, Bittersweet Chocolate Garnish, you can't miss with this one!

The rest of the recipe is wonderful but, the strawberry coulis is idiot proof. I've used it for a myriad of dishes and have always had rave reviews, and I'm a married man!!

According to the online version of this recipe, the filling has me stumped! The directions call for sugar, yet there isn't any listed in the ingredients. It also calls for 5 (!) teaspoons of vanilla extract?? I'm not sure I'm going to even bring this dessert to our dinner engagement tonight, as the vanilla is overpowering any hint of white chocolate that may be present. Any tips????

I made this dessert for a dinner party Sat. night. Came out great and made my life easier since I could prepare it the night before. I used 1 9" tart pan rather than individual pans. I served with the sauce and a fresh strawberry on each plate. My guests loved it!

Absolutely amazing!! People just couldn't get enough of this dessert. Next time I will reduce the amount of butter to 1/4 cup(for the crust). It was difficult to make it stay put on the rim of my 9-inch pan. it was extremely easy to make and tasted wonderfully!!

I found that the crust was too tender to make a big tart (9"). Mine just fell apart. I made it again, adding some chopped white chocolate and an egg and had better results. The filling is wonderful. I piped mine into the crust using a star tip and it looked very pretty.

I served this for our "Dinner Club" and it received raves! It was VERY easy to prepare and the fact that I could do it a day ahead made my life much easier! I used the individual tartlet pans. The presentation was wonderful and the coulis really enhanced the dessert. The crust was a big hit with our company as well!

Wonderful recipe! Made these for New Year's Eve dinner with friends and a huge hit! Easy to prepare. I thought they might be a little "rich" but ended up being very refreshing and actually quite light tasting. I topped mine with slices of fresh strawberries and served a little of the coulis on top as well as on the plate. I think you could use other berries in this recipe as well depending on what looks good in the store. Will make again and again!

These tartlets were awesome! I thought they might be too sweet, but not at all. The strawberry coulis compliments the filling and crust very well. I made these for my new boyfriend, the first meal I prepared for him. He was in awe! I would definitely do them again!!

I made this in little tartlet tins, but had plenty mousse left. We piped the remainder on a graham cracker and added another to make a sandwich. Wrapped them individually and put them in the freezer. They were awesome. They would probably be good dipped in dark chocolate, too.

I made this for a dinner party, and received rave reviews. I, too didn't have individual tart pans, so I used a 9" pan with removeable bottom. Crust recipe makes enough for two of these. Very easy, delicious and showy when garnished with whipped cream and whole strawberries. A keeper!

This recipe was delicious and got rave reviews. I made it for valentine's day. I didn't have enough tartlet pans so i used a 9-inch springform pan instead and made one big one. It came out almost cheesecake like but lighter. Definitely going to make this one again. The crust alone was delicious

This was a great dessert recipe! I made it for a dinner party this past weekend and it turned out just wonderfully. One thing to watch is that the recipe mistakenly tells you to add the sugar with the whipped cream and chocolate mix when, in fact, the sugar gets added with the strawberry coulis. I just ignored this and didn't add any sugar to the filling mix (additional sugar would have made the filling too sweet anyway). The tarts were great! I really recommend this if you want to get impress dinner guests--the presentation is nice too.
