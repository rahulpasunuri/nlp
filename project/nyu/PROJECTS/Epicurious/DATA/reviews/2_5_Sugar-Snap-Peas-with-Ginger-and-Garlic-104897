Made this minus the ginger plus bacon. Yum!

This was surprisingly bland even after I tried to spruce it up with sesame oil.

just a lovely, delicate hint of spice that adds so much to the peas I use it all the time

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. I tried using sesame oil instead of olive oil and adding toasted sesame seeds at the end but it still wasn't that impressive

I used this as a base recipe and riffed on it. I used the shallots, garlic, and ginger, and added a little chopped pancetta (bacon works, too). I recommend either cooking the pancetta separately or adding it after draining excess fluids because otherwise the pancetta ends up limp. Add salt and pepper about 1 minute before you take it off the heat .

Sounded good but the results were just so-so.

Boring. The flavor just wasn't strong enough. Might as well just serve fresh sugar snap peas. They have quite a bit of flavor on their own. I have recipes that add brown sugar and almonds to the ginger and garlic. I think I'll stick with those.

I didn't have all of the ingrediants available for this particular recipe so I opted for another one. I think SESAME OIL rather than olive oil would give this recipe some flavor.

Not as much flavor as I had hoped, but better than nothing.

Delicious. My market was out of sugar snaps, so I substituted snow peas. My husband, who is not the biggest vegetable fan, ate his portion right up. I served this alongside jasmine rice and Honey Gingered Pork Tenderloin. (Gourmet, August '98).

ALthough the ginger and garlic are strong - it tastes flat.

So easy and tasty! A wonderful complement to any meal. I served these with with epicurious recipe seared tuna with wasabi and green onion sauce.

Simple and tasty. An easy way to make a side vegetable a little more interesting...
