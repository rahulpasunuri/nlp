If Eric Ripert say it needs 25 eggs.... I'll use 25 eggs. Excellent recipe, be sure to whisk the sabayon enough so you dont get that eggy taste some talked about.

I would agree with the previous commenter that this tasted 'eggy'. Maybe I didn't cook the sauce quite long enough, but it definitely tasted a little off. I think it's a very nice idea, and with maybe half as much egg and a little English mustard to oompf it up, it might turn out OK.

I've made this several times and both my husband and I found it excellent. I used a grill pan and lightly oiled the pan and fish and avoided sticking. The sauce was delicious--I followed the recipe exactly. The slightly bitter bok choy was a perfect counterpoint to the rich sauce.

I used three eggs instead of four and the dressing still seemed "eggy." I also substituted shrip for the tilapia, because thats what I had on hand. Good, but there are better recipes out there for use of these ingredients.

Not impressed. Grilling the tilapia did not work out very well. It fell apart when removed from the grates. The sauce was good but took a long time to get to the light and foamy stage. Don't overdue the salt.

Grilling the tilapia as directed, till slightly charred outside, made the fish really delicious. I must have done something wrong with the sauce though - it was very runny. Good flavor, but the texture was too thin. Perhaps because I had the water bath at higher than a simmer? I will definitely try again, though.

There's nothing like making a new dish for company, but thanfully, it turned out pretty well. The only recommendation that I would have is to make sure your wine reduction errs on the side of more rather than less. I though I had 2 T. when I took it off the stove, but because I let it sit for a little bit, the shallots absorbed the liquid and so the sauce turned out more like a paste than a sauce. Though, I must say, the technique of using a double boiler for this sauce does a wonderful job at not cooking the eggs solid. I've made a bernaise sauce in one pot before and it's rather tricky to get the eggs warm enough before you add them to the heated liquid. I served this with the heirloom tomatoes and the chili cheddar shortcakes. The dishes were great color combinations.
