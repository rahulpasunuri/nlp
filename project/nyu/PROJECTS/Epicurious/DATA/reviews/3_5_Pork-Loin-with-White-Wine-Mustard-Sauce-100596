I've made this a couple of times now and as others have found this is a great base recipe that becomes better as you expand it. This time I thinly sliced the shallots, added about 2 cups of thinly sliced mushroom and 2 cloves of garlic along with the shallots. After the wine I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of thyme, used chicken stock (didn't have veal stock) and added about 2 tablespoons of plain (greek) yogurt along with the mustard and reduced till it was starting to get thick. Served over rice the pork was great and the rice provided a great way to soak up the sauce.

just made it tonight, between my husband and I it took 25 min to make the meat, mashed potatoes and asparagus, Wonderful, quick and easy, Would definitely make again. Used beef stock as it was what I had and it was fine, otherwise did recipe as is.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I used garlic instead of a shallot. The sauce reduced well but could have used more spice - was a bit bland. In fact I put cayenne pepper on top of my pork chops to give it a kick. I'd suggest using a mix of cayenne and black pepper on the steaks or incorporating into the sauce when serving.

Good - took others' advice and sauted garlic and mushooms with Shallots then doubled the sauce and served over rice. Even the 5 year old ate it up. This would be good with chicken as well, or beef tips if you added a little creaminess to the sauce.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed this very much. I used THICK chops and sauteed them for 6 minutes on either side. I thought the sauce was fine as the recipe stated, except I used a mixture of chicken and beef stock instead of the veal. Followed the recipe otherwise and was very pleased. Will DEFINITELY make this again. A good, quick weeknight meal.

This was very tasty and a nice alternative to my other pork recipes. Next time I think I will add a bit of garlic with the shallots as well as some Sage to give it more oomph. Also, I wish I had pounded the chops as mine were quite thick. Regardless, this was a big hit with the family and very quick to make from start to table.

I want some of the wine that Bella used.

Quick and easy. I used beed stock and added a little cream at the sauce at the end to make the sauce smoother.

Excellent. Can be prepared in 15 minutes--not 45! I seared chops for 3 minutes per side, then added to the pan with wine/mustard sauce for final minute. Great dish for week night!

Recipe was very user friendly, mustard sauce really made the dish.

Thank you, "Bella", for one of the heartiest laughs I have ever had. You are extraordinarily funny.

IMPORTANT: If you want this recipe to succeed, take four tablespoons, not more. I hesitated when adding the other thing, but instead I used carrot shavings. BEFORE cooking, rinse under HOT water, until just whitish, picking out any specks you see. The way to cook is right, as the other person wrote, but not more than that. ALSO: remember that cooking improves flavor, and that the oil/butter/lard/chives combination is a tricky thing to pull off. Use tweezers, or a mitten, preferably blue. WINE is important, and the right one is probably right there on my bookshelf. PEPPER can be overused, especially if you're not used to grinding your teeth right. I would suggest cutting down the cooking time, or extending the heating time, whichever works well for you. Remember NEVER to follow a recipe exactly unless you have tried it once before, then go ahead, but adjust as you see fit. REDUCE heat after the first 4 minutes, section by section, afterwards. If you see any red, make sure the wine is not burning, or the bell peppers. TIP: good kitchen lighting is essential, especially for this recipe, and also have handy a spoon, you'll need it!!!!!!! I tried lowering the cholesterol by adding ground cloves, but it ruined the taste, I think. Paprika is a good substitute, and hot dogs. If you are hosting a large party, DOUBLE the recipe except the water and salt, placing a salt cellar and a pitcher on the table instead. Healthy food makes everyone enjoy it better. I do. My blood pressure plummeted after changing my dietary habits, and THIS recipe needs some work in that regard. White wine can't work, for obvious reasons. Bye!

This was very good. I added mushrooms and garlic and used beef broth instead of veal. The pork was very tender and the sauce was flavorful. Next time I will probably add a little more wine. This is a good change for pork chops and I will definitely make it again.

Very good. I added a little sour cream to the sauce at the very end prior to serving over the pork chops. I also substituted vidalia onions (the white ends) instead of shallots

Enjoyed the dish very much. Not difficult. The only thing I changed was to use vegetable broth so that I did not have to bother making the veal broth. Had all ingredients on hand, making it very simple.

Of course, one of the things to do with such a recipe is to select the right wine. In this case I'd say a nice tangy Sauvignon does the trick. And perhaps Dyon-mustard instead of the whole-grain. Also make sure the pork is not overcooked as it tends to get very dry.

Excellent recipe. The key is to not overcook the pork and let the sauce reduce significantly to concentrate the flavors. I cooked my pork to about 150 degrees and it was very juicy. Will add this to my rotation.

It was good, I was looking for a recipe that contained staples from the kitchen, and this was a good example. (I had to sub regular onion) I read the reviews and got some ideas. I used more white wine and let it reduce longer. I added garlic, dried parsley, sage and thyme. I finished it with butter and a little cornstarch slurry to thicken. I would make versions again, it's an easy recipe to do last minute from things around the house.

Easy but incredibly bland, even after I had added spices!

This was really easy and very good for a basic, home dinner. I probably wouldn't make it for company. I didn't have whole mustard seed, so I used 1 tsp of Dijon instead and it seemed to work well.

I only had yellow onions so that's what I used. Didn't have veal stock, used chicken. Will definately do this again but I think next time I'll add mushrooms.

I used chicken stock and doubled the sauce recipe. I only had red onions, so I chopped up one of those and it added a nice tang. I needed to add some cornstarch to thicken it up, but it was delicious.

I have made a variation of this recipe several times. I got it from my mother, but, I believe, she got it from Bon Appetit. I use a whole tenderloin and use fresh sage while cooking. While the pork rests I add thinly sliced onions that have been carmelized to the liquid. Let it reduce for a few minutes and then add some half and half and cook down. When the pork has rested for about 10 minutes, slit it down the center (not all the way through, but like a moat). Place sliced Gruyer cheese down the center. Tent the pan and put it back in the oven at a higher heat and cook intil the cheese is completely melted. Pull it out and slice then cover it with the sauce. It is really close to a 4 fork dinner, but I am picky! Enjoy!

I made this recipe with the pork for my boyfriend and we both loved it. Since then I've made it with chicken breasts, which was also good. However, the best was using beef tips, putting them in the sauce, and spooning the mixture over rice. It's a very versatile, tasty recipe.

Fast and easy, add a couple of cloves of minced garlic with the shallot and some fresh thyme, finish with a generous garnish of minced flat leaf parsley.

While this was quick to prepare, it wasn't anything special. The chops needed to be cooked a little longer, too. If I made it again, it only would be for a super-fast supper and I would leave out the mustard and add a little sage.

I made this recipe with beef stock instead of veal, since i was in a rush. We are not big pork lovers, but this was a hit. I'm thinking of trying it with chicken breasts, too.
