Excellent side dish. Baked the sweet potatoes for 30 minutes and lightly cooked bell pepper, black beans for 5 minutes before potatoes were cooked. Tossed the sweet potatoes in the pan with the scallions and mixed in 2/3 of the dressing. Delicious! Our family preferred this dish warm after tasting our cool leftovers.

Really beautiful presentation, it looks so bountiful. I kept the sweet potatoes warm and warmed the black beans slightly, then let them wilt the arugula just a little. Did not add mint, did not miss it. Found the lime to be a little strong, but still thought it was delicious, whisked in a small bit of olive oil to balance the lime and balsamic dressing. I did not improvise too much, but I think it is a recipe that would take substitutions well.

In a word - wow! This salad is delicious and visually beautiful. The only change I made was to use parsley instead of mint and I made with a red pepper not sliced orange. I did not have arugula so ate it without any type of lettuce. Does not need it in my opinion.

This recipe is divine! To help with the potatoes, cube them same size as beans, they'll cook up in a flash! Wonderful goto recipe for a nice side dish when feeding friends. Love love love it.

I made this yesterday it was delicious, I cut the potatos very thin and lightly coated them in oil so they browned at the edges. This salad was delicious and I added a little corn and a little spice to make it southwesterny. YUM

This was good - but not great - the first time I made it to serve with dinner. Next day, however, the leftovers made a very tasty lunch. Lesson learned for me was to marinate the beans, scallions and pepper in some of the lime juice, balsamic, garlic and mint for several hours before adding the roasted sweet potatoes and serving over arugula- MUCH better!

I made this for my own lunches during the week. I left out the mint, added cumin, cayenne and cilantro. I also added some corn. I loved the sweetness of the potatoes with the heat of the cayenne.

I would actually use less black beans next time and skip the mint. But everything else was great! I even added baby corn, snap peas, and cucumber!

Very good - leftovers make a good lunch to take to work. Had to add some meat for my husband so did a coriander crusted pork tenderloin - went great with this salad.

Really really delicious! The only thing I did differently was that I left the potato skin on and I used some oil when roasting the taters. I also did not use any scallions. Other than that, followed recipe exactly and I will definitely be making again.

Not bad...I would try it again, maybe with a bit less garlic as I found it slightly over-powering. I wasn't too crazy about the mint - I might try with fresh basil instead. I roasted the sweet potatoes in a small roasting pan drizzled with oil. They turned out perfectly, but did take about 25-30mins. This is just as good the following day out of the fridge (but don't mix leftovers with arugula beforehand).

What a yummy, easy to make, and versatile dish. I followed the recipe and my husband and I both liked it as is. I'll definitely make this one again.

SUPER DELICIOUS!!! Our arugula was bad, so we ate it without. I agree with other reviewers that the potatoes took longer to cook, and I would recommend to toss them in a little olive oil before roasting, not just spraying the pan.

This recipe needs some serious mods. My potatoes cooked too slowly also, as well as unevenly. It didn't appear to be a size issue; I cut them into variable sizes and some of the big ones were well done while some of the little ones were not. And vice versa. Maybe it was variation between the potatoes themselves?? Anyway, they came out real dehydrated looking so I drizzled some olive oil on them before mixing them in with the other ingredients. I feel like the recipe should have called for this, *before* they were put into the oven. Also, I used the recommended amounts of lime juice and vinegar but it was WAY too sour. Otherwise it was OK...

Tasty and easy (one of my favorite combinations). I left out the mint and used a bit of cilantro instead. I served as a side vs over arugula. I also doubled the dressing and mixed in about 1/3 cup olive oil. Very happy w/ this one. I'll definitely make again.

This was super tasty, but the potatoes (I used a mix of yams & sweet potatoes) took closer to 30 minutes to roast even though I chopped them closer to 1/2 inch pieces. I substituted cilantro for mint and green pepper (diced) instead of orange or red, and used about half the salt and lime juice called for. I also served it on spinach instead of arugula, and wrapped it all into a whole wheat tortilla - a great healthy & easy (and vegan!) dinner I'll definitely make again.

This was really good, and was easy to throw together. The potatoes took about twice as long to roast... you'd have to cut smaller than 1" cubes to get them done in just 15 minutes. Will make this or some variation again!
