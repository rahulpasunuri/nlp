I made this for Father's day and it turned out beautifully! I figured out that it works best to loosen the crust from the wax paper on both sides before putting in tart pan. I used cherries from my tree (not sour) and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. It could have used the 1/4 cup of sugar that it called for. I will definitely make it again!

I see from the reviews that the last time I made this and reviewed it was in '05, and I've been craving it ever since! The last few summers, the birds have had their way with the cherries on my tree, but this year I beat them to it and made this wonderful crostata again. It reminds me so much of when I lived in Italy and would attend my nephew's school functions. The mom's would bring the most amazing desserts, and the crostata was my favorite. I adore this sour cherry version, and as long as you keep the crust cold, it's quite easy to work with.

Really, really good! A co-worker brought in some pie cherries, so I made this to share at work. Sturdier than a pie, so good to put out in our break room. Went together easily; chilling the dough well between steps is a must. At first the filling seemed a bit gloppy with so much cornstarch, but turned out fine. Do be sure to mix in the cornstarch/water mixture well into the filling, or you will end up with cornstarch blobs. After blending the cornstarch/water it was really thick, so when it came time to mix into the filling I added several spoonfuls of filling to the cornstarch, stirred it well, then poured back into the rest of the filling. That helped disolve the cornstarch evenly. Will definitely make again. The final product looks gorgeous, and tastes even better.

This was terrific and a total keeper. I only had half the amount of sour cherries needed so I supplemented with fresh blackberries and some frozen raspberries. No matter. On the crust problem, it does not have to be perfect, but make sure you chill it sufficiently or you will have a big mess. I also used a 10 inch tart pan and found I had enough dough.

I forgot to rate this in my review. I give it 4 forks.

This tart was delicious- I had fresh sour cherries from the farmer's market, so I Iooked here for recipes.When I added the cornstarch-cold water combination to the hot cherries, it dissolved and thickened them almost instantly. No problem with the dough either, although I would recommend chilling the dough strips for the top more than 5 minutes, as some of them broke apart - I pressed them back together and stuck the completed tart in the freezer for a few minutes before baking - it turned out great. My tart pan is only 7", so I made 2/3 of the pastry dough and 1/2 of the filling - nothing boiled over.

I'm not sure why others had trouble with the crust - I found it very easy to work with. To the cook from Arlington, VA - it isn't the recipe's fault that your cornstarch didn't dissolve - the directions were clear about dissolving it in water before adding to the cherries. Cornstarch always clumps if you try to mix it into hot liquid. I'd try it again - the tart is delicious, and much easier than a cherry pie.

The filling was great and the crostata was beautiful, but the pastry was a nightmare to work with!!! I'm usually pretty good with pastry but this one was IMPOSSIBLE to roll out, even though I did it between layers of waxed paper. It stuck to everything. I ended up just patting it in the pan, and then rolled out the remaining pastry for the lattice with great difficulty. Next time, I will use either my tried-and-true pate sucree recipe, or find another recipe for pasta frolla. The filling was fabulous, though - I used fresh organic cherries (worms and all!!!) from my in-laws' tree. Delicious!

Delicious! I can't wait to make it again. I could only find sour cherries in a jar, which, when drained yielded 16 oz. of cherries. I reduced the amounts of the other ingredients for the filling accordingly, and it made just the right amount of filling for the tart. Also, I had trouble working with the crust dough (my kitchen was a bit warm, and the dough gets sticky quickly) so instead of rolling it out, I simply pressed it into the bottom and sides of the tart pan using the bottom of a measuring cup dipped in flour. It came out beautifully. It's best eaten within 24 hours.

Fantastic and beautiful to look at! I used a 10-inch tart pan and there was plenty of dough. I used jared cherries from Trader Joes- drained the juice and followed the recipe exactly after that. The strips broke apart easily (the colder they are, the better) but pressing them together worked out fine. I didn't use all of the filling (I used about 3/4) and had no problems with it overflowing. Would definitely make again and the crunchy cookie-like crust really stands up to the hearty cherry filling- strips don't get soggy and brown nicely!

This was great. I can't wait to have cherries on my tree again so that I can enjoy this wonderful dessert.

Very pretty and good flavor. The only problem we had with it was that the filling bubbled out all over! Next time I will not use all the filling.

This was a recipe was an enormous disappointment for me--I'd been saving my sour cherries in the freezer since June just so I could make it for President's Day! My cornstarch didn't dissolve, and I removed big clumps of it from the cherries. Needless to say, while baking, the cherries ran over and I ended up with a scorched sugar pie. I won't do this one again.

This turned out delicious! Never made crostata before. Here are my comments: 1. Cherries took very long to pit, will use a cherry pitter next time and maybe will be faster. 2. Found it hard to find sour cherries - finally found them at Dominion but they only sold a whole pail of them for $10.00. Ended up finding them at small fine foods store in pints. 3. Found the crust really easy to make! Used a hand mixer. Crust was I think a little too moist (could have been the humid day that added to that) so it was hard to cut strips for lattice and place them on top without breaking. Maybe next time will add a bit more flour. 4. The filling boiled over onto the lattice a bit - did not ruin taste at all, but did affect the appearance of the lattice - not sure how to prevent this - anyone have any ideas? 5. I had the wrong size tart pan - I had a 10" pan - made a little more dough and worked out fine. Will try to use the proper pan size next time though. I realize I had a lot of comments, but this crostata was still amazingly delicious!

This was a great recipe, got RAVE reviews from my dinner guests, will definitely make it again. The presentation was killer as well.

Outstanding! A very good and attractive recipe.

Definitely different! Overall a good dessert - my cherries weren't sour, so perhaps that would've made the filling more tart, or lemon juice or something like that. But the crust was heavenly and very easy to make. Also, I didn't have a tart pan, but a good pie pan worked just as well. I'm interested in trying the nectarine and blackberry crostata also on this site, but using this same crust recipe! Yum! Give this one a shot - it's worth trying!!

Last year in Feb. I was in Rome, walking through the Jewish quarter, and a couple of blocks behind the Temple that faces the Tiber, on a little corner is a bakery that was pulling sour cherry crostate out of the oven! The fragrance was celestial; they flavor divine. People were lined up out the door waiting to buy a piece and carry it away - it had sweetened ricotta filling and the sour cherry filling on top of that inside the 2 disks pinched together;no woven top. I'm delighted to find a recipie close enough to make it myself.

The dessert was good but not good enough to warrant the amount of time I spent on it. Despite pitting my own cherries, I felt the filling was unremarkable. If you choose to make this, I would suggest adding a tablespoon of cognac or port to wake it up. I wish I would have done that. I had a very difficult time with the crust despite having made several dozens tarts and pies in the past. Good luck!
