Quite yummy, I made a champagne sauce to go with it, I think it needs a sauce. butter scallions champagne fish stock cream parmesan cheese I also included a crisp salad for the side and put the lemon on it, not in the sauce.

This is VERY VERY salmonny. And I am a true lover of salmon. It was okay, and it might be good on a bagel or something, but the buckwheat galettes are not enough to balance the flavor of the salmon. Though the galettes are good, and it's really not horrible -- it's just a whole lot of salmon, you'd better be serving this to people who just can't get enough of it.

This is a nice light dinner. I boiled potatoes and made a creme fraise sauce with dill for the side.
