I use West Coast Dungeness. I have made the recipe about 5 times and we love it. I don't always use cream, sometimes just milk and it works well. I also add a layer of either gruyere or havarti cheese on top of every crab layer. We don't have purple potatoes so I also substitute regular baker potatoes.

Can't review the dish, haven't made it but was looking for something special to do with the recent gift from home (Maryland) for my family in Connecticut. I won't eat crab in restaurants around here because in never measures up. Don't know about CA but 'there is no place like home!'

We anticipated the purple potatoes would make this a great dish for a Valentine's Day dinner. Instead, we got a gray, mushy, fishy mess. The qualities of the potatoes are entirely lost in this recipe. The crab is overpowering and bathing it in cream destroys its delicate sweetness. The proportions are off (too much crab, too little cream). If you're still even remotely considering making this recipe, please also see my review of the poached halibut it is meant to go with. When was the last time anyone at Epicurious made this meal? If they tried it themselves they'd know enough to remove it from their archives, lest others be subjected to it!

I too found this dish just okay. We had it as a main course with spinach salad and a Chardonnay and it was tasty but not exciting. I seasoned each layer with Old Bay to combat the blandness that others described, but eh... I found the crab to be overpowered by the potatoes and the color of the dish was not very appealing in the end. The crab and sauce turned purple-gray from the potatoes. Also I did not have enough cream to go to the top despite following the recipe exactly, so the top was a little dry. I'm guessing my potato slices were too thick. I also grated some fontina on top but in the end it was *still* missing something. Sadly I think there are better uses for both the crab and the potatoes.

I found this dish to be just so-so. Served it for a crowd of foodies, and we all agreed that it was missing some spice. I also found it difficult to season with sea salt and white pepper for each layer - without any indication of how much to use? I was concerned with over-salting the dish. Although I did not, if I were to make it again, (which I probably won't) I would use something to give it a little kick!

Interesting. A bit rich, and it seemed like a waste of the crab (where the crab was from I don't know, but it was nevertheless good stuff). Perhaps it was the dish I made the gratin in -- an oval casserole with a capactiry of 1 or 2 quarts. Not very big. I might make it again if I wanted something unusual, at a buffet or something, but probably not for a weeknight dinner.

This is a good recipe!especially if you use Texas gulf coast blue crab!

I haven't tried this yet but I thought I'd comment on you all squaking about who has the best crab- I live in Ohio. At least you have crab!! I have the best, let me think, nothing!!

Excellent and very rich. I liked the swiss cheese on top as well. However, here in the northwest, everyone knows you can't beat Dungeness crab.

True, this is a winner and the crab issue is moot. Reason? San Francisco has GREAT crab and something Maine and Maryland will never have that goes with this meal like Ginger Rogers and Fred Astair: SOURDOUGH FRENCH BREAD ! Thats right, and while you are trying to decide who has the best crab, consider this: Sonoma County is right next door and thee best wine region in the world. Suffer my Eastern Companions.

This was delicious and easy to prepare. (I melted some grated swiss on top during the last 10 minutes of cooking.) It was particularly good with fresh crabmeat from Maine!

Outstanding!! One exception, every good cook knows the best crab comes from Maryland!
