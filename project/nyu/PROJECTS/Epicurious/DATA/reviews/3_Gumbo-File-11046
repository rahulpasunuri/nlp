As a True Cajun this recipe is sooo far off from a true gumbo! A gumbo does not take days to cook ! I was raised by true Cajun Women in the heart of Cajun Country with family roots from the 1800's! A gumbo is a simple dish nothing fancy at all. Okra: if you want okra in your gumbo, it may be cooked ahead. Take your 6-8 cups of sliced okra and cook it down in a covered pot with 3 tablespoons of oil on a medium heat. Add 1 chopped onion, seasoning like Tony Chachere's or salt and cayenne pepper to taste, and a can or 2 of Rotel. Stir it up and cook until the okra losses it's slime. Put aside. For the Gumbo: First of all file' is added to your dish when served. I personally don't like the taste of it and it is not something most of us true cajuns use! Second, a ROUX is made with equal parts of Vegatable oil and flour. It is mixed in an iron pot and put on a medium to high heat and stirred consistantly. For a gumbo the roux should be a milk to dark chocolate color. Third, When making a gumbo, dissolve your roux in water or chicken stock. Then add a chopped onion. At this point, add chicken and sausage. Cover and simmer for a couple of hours. Add okra and and chopped onion tops (Shallots) then let simmer for another 30 minutes. Serve over Rice. If you want a seafood gumbo, add the seafood at the same time as the okra. Seafood cooks quickly. Seafood we add to gumbo consist of shrimp, oysters, real crab meat, and crawfish. It is super easy and a great meal with a side of potato salad!

If you have a gumbo with okra, you shouldn't use file. File' is for a gumbo that contains chicken and sausage. I don't like this recipe at all. Okra and file' are both thickeners, don't use them both in the same dish.

Why don't you give us a break? I grew up around New Orleans, and this is the receipe real cajuns use. Yes, you can make it where it takes two days, but that is wasted time. Please don't down grade someone for cooking a certain way. Try it, you may just realize they are right. Oh, and when you're raised in the south, you try and not heat up the house by senseless time in a kitchen. The other time is used to finish college and get your Masters.

Give me a break here people,the preparation and cooking of Gumbo is an art. "File" powder is as an ingredient that is as curcial to a gumbo as is Okra like it or not. Most important to note here is that GOOD gumbo is not made in a day, like a great italian tomatoe sauce (known as gravey)gumbo is a dish that takes anywhere from up to 2 days (and in the best of cases) 4 days to prepare.Feel free to use this recipe as a resource, but I would never consider serving gumbo on the "fly".

As a surrogate Texan (i.e. Navy brat of South East Texan parents) I was raised on Gumbo! I'd love to just add a few quick tips, since I prefer sausage and shrimp, above anything with chicken in it. (Crawfish are perfect for gumbo, too, if you can get them.) If you can't find a good andouille sausage for the gumbo, chorizo works really well, too. It's a little greasy, but I like to slice the sausage, brown it in my cast-iron dutch oven,don't add oil,(the bigger pot the better), remove the sausage. I then use the lovely browned bits and oil with a bit of new oil and get it nice and hot. Then add two to three tablespoons of flour. Rouix doesn't have to be cooked on an extremely low temperature. Medium heat will do just fine. When it gets to a dark cocoa brown, add your drier veggies (onions, celery, peppers), salt, pepper, and spices (minced garlic, oregano, parsley, cayenne pepper, and Zataran's or Old Bay is good, too). I don't always use file because I really like the taste of okra, and besides, the real thickener is the flour. Brown your veggies in the rouix and slap a lid on the pan. Let the veggies sweat a bit. When all is tender, add your water or broth, softer vegetables, frozen okra, frozen or canned stewed tomatoes, and your peeled, deveined shrimp or crawfish tails and sausage. Heat through and serve over long grain white rice!

According to the Picayune Original Creole Cookbook first published in 1901, "orka and file are not, as a rule, used together in making gumbo." My Aunt Rachel makes gumbo with roux, chicken, shrimp, crab and sausage. This is my preferred method. The key to great gumbo is fresh ingrdients and dark roux.

As a Texas Gulf Coast grown cook who's naturally well acquianted with Cajun cooking (that part of Texas has a lot of Cajuns), I can answer "confused"'s questions: while some people do scoff at having both okra and file in a gumbo together, it is not as bad a "sin" as it's made out to be. The culinary dilemmia these two ingredients combined presents is both are thickeners, and putting them together may cause the gumbo to be too thick. There are ways around this if you want to use both, like using a little less of one or both, or not cutting the okra (use only small pods), or thoroughly rising or even blanching the cut okra beforehand to get rid of some of the stringy, thickening juice. Also only add file to the gumbo right before it's eaten, and *only* to the portion intented to be eaten immediately. Do not put file in any gumbo cooked and then kept to be eaten later. Traditionally, gumbo is served tableside with a bottle of file on the side along with a bottle of Tabasco, and each person adds as much or little as they like. As for tomatoes, yes, gumbo can have tomatoes, and frequently does. Gumbo, like many other homegrown dishes like meatloaf or chili, is versatile and has an endless number of variations that are acceptable. In Cajun country, gumbo cooking is a kind of self-expression, and it's typical for everyone or every family to have their own particular style of gumbo. P.S. to the other reviewers: the flour-fat base is spelled "roux" but pronounced "rue."

please forgive me for asking a question rather than reviewing the recipe, but i need to know before i dive into it: isn't it a 'cardinal sin' to add both okra and file to a gumbo? tomatoes in gumbo sound a little weird, too. are there any seasoned cajun cooks out there who could once and for clarify my doubts? does okra go with file? tomatoes or no tomatoes? (while in new orleans i had many a bowl of gumbo - all tomato-free). please help. thank you.

This is a very simple dish and should be enjoyed by all. At the start be sure and be patient w/the RUE!!! It should be stirred constantly on a very low heat. If you burn it,START OVER! I like to B-B-Q my sausage(usually andoulle),but have used several differant kinds, b/4 adding. It adds more sausage flavor. I also use my turkey cooker to make large batches,as it is a great fall/spring dish for outside on the patio. Also,be sure and double recipes until your sure of how much to make. Most people come up short. If yours looks like its going to be thin,add some masa to thickin. This dish is served OVER rice. Just b/4 eating,sprinkle w/gumbo file.

I have not tried it but I would suggest it to any one till I prefect my own.:) I was looking for a recipe similar to the one I grew up eating, which I no longer have access to. If anyone knows family recipes, they are not written down! If you are going to make this dish I would suggest starting with this one, but also take a look at two others. chicken, sausage and okra gumbo, and the shrimp and crab gumbo. If you combine all three, omitting the tomatoes! we never used them in our gumbo! You have something very close to the VERY spicy hot dish I and my family ate every year as a child. I will be making my version of this family dish for my wedding and will be practicing for the Fourth of July 2004. Instead of just chicken adding a duck braising them together in the duck fat witch you use for your rue! Replacing the shrimps with crawfish with a nice Main lobster for fun! Gumbo is not one dish, there are many varieties, but there are some constants if not definite. Burn the flour, as my step-dad would say, meaning make a nice slow DARK rue! Okra, unless you can't stand it and file at the end. But as I say not hard and fast rules. I also recommend always using the Creole trinity! equal parts green peppers, yellow onion and celery, it always helps to.

I added ham, shrimp, crab, chicken, and andouille sausage. I also added some tobasco, extra butter, and a little bit of rice when adding the water. These were previous made suggestions. I had to go to 2 grocery stores to find the file powder and ended up finding it at a Jewel grocery store.

I did use a pre-made Roux from New Orleans. "Savoies" Other than that I substituted crawfish for shrimp and followed the recipee as is. It was wonderful! Supper club loved it and my husband said I could make it every week. It was good!

I followed the recipe perfectly. However it came out really watery. Isn't Gumbo supposed to be a bit like a stew. It was like floating fish. The taste was good, but the consistancy was thin.

The only changes I would make is to use more okra, substitute andoulie sausage for ham and double the recipe because when you make this gumbo, you're going to have a few people show up for dinner.

As a bad Brit I add tiny dots of butter very gradually, towards the end of cooking - and then, finally, a good dollop of creme fraiche...this makes a velvety, scrummy consistency and a glossy look. Otherwise, it's excellent - probably - without!

Wonderful. It's great without the file powder in case you can't find it.

Really think this is a wonderful gumbo recipe

it is very diffcult for me to do this type of cooking and not tinker with the recipe I like to use seansoned sauagein place of the ham I chopp it into bits size pieces. and I like to add rice when adding the water. a word of CAUTION to all DO NOT place gumbo in frig until it has cooled to room temp. I did and the crab meat soured we live on the Gulf Of Mexico an crabs are readily avaiable to us. but never cheap.I found a hot sauce named "Alabama sunshine" that is wonderful in this dish. they have a web site. check it out.

Absolutely Loved it, gives you a new perspective of how, and why seafood restaurantes are so expensive. Note: it only feeds 3 hungry folks. Especially if gumbo is the only meal.Might feed more if it is only the side dish. You get tired before you get full, maybe a new invention for diet food. Joking!, If you, like I did, use fresh crabs, it is a very teadious process getting the crab meat out. But if you have the time, and pacience, is a spectacular meal, can't wait to try on very important guests. OH and allow at least 3 hours to prepare, from scratch.

I used vegetable oil instead of shortening (good) and imitation crab (bad). My husband and I are great fans of Cajun and Creole foods and we both really enjoyed this recipe. I would also use a bit more okra next time.

Very tasty. I used the garlic broth by Barbra Kafka, as a base. Next time I made it, I'll use more okra as I found it a tad thin. But, I loved it and will be making it again.

I made a few changes which I recommend. Use oil instead of shortening for the roux. When making the roux, heat the oil until just about to smoke (the oil, not the cook). Use tasso instead of ham. Save a little work and use garlic paste, available at Asian markets. It also works well in vegetable stir-fry.

I first used this recipe in the 1960s when my daughters were toddlers and after I discovered Gourmet's Menu Cookbooks. We didn't have much money, but a great deal of it began to go into special cookery items and recipe ingredients. The amazing part is that at the time we lived in Boulder, CO, but somehow got our hands on fresh crab one December. We must have had a lot of crab, for we had some left over. As the smell of the crab intensified the next day, I searched for some way to cook what remained so that none would be wasted. I found this "Gumbo File" recipe in my Gourmet cookbok, which I made & served over steamed white rice -- to raves. I had forgotten all about the recipe until this month when one of my daughters asked me for it. Unable to lay hands on my Gourmet cookbook, I came to the web and voilla! THANK YOU again.
