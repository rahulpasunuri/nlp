A perfect way to share my grandmother's quince jam with others!

I could not find quince jam, so I used ginger jam. I quadrupled the recipe for a large part, and none were left

After reading the reviews, I used all the listed ingredients, but fiddled with the pastry part. I, too, tried using a bottle cap since I don't own a tiny pastry cutter. This proved a bit messy, so I dug out my pizza cutter and cut the pastry into bite-sized squares -- easy! I sliced the baked bites in half as recommended by an earlier reviewer. My guests LOVED these!..Might try these with fig or apricot jam next time.

I've made these twice for wine tastings at my husbands shop. Everybody raves about them. I haven't been able to find quince jam so I use Fig Ginger Jam made by Stonewall Kitchen. I also use regular Blue Cheese instead of Stilton to stay within budget.

These make a lovely presentation and were all eaten up at my holiday party. I used a 1 1/2 inch cap from an iced tea bottle, because couldn't find a cutter small enough. Found quince jam in a Lebanese market. It was delicious, but think fig jam would work equally as well. Like others, I split the puffs in half, so they looked like little sandwiches. There's no such thing as too much stilton cheese - so pile it on!!

These were very tasty, and my guests really appreciated them. I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the pastries in half, then filled them with the cheese and jam. Stacking the cheese and jam on top was just not going to work. Also, I wished I had let the cheese come to room temperature a little more, because the flavor was not as full as I would have liked. Also, I only had a 2-inch round, so my pastries were a little on the large side. When I make again, I plan to find a smaller cutter--at two inches, these couldn't be eaten in one bite, so they were very crumbly.

The flavor combination was great, but the ingredients kept slipping off. Re-worked, these would be very tasty.

Everyone raved about these! They were super easy to make. I cut the cooked puff pastries in half and put the quince jam and stilton inside, like a little sandwich.

Served these at my New Year's Eve dinner party and they were just okay. Not worth the effort of going to three Manhattan gourmet grocers to find the quince jam (at Zabar's in case you need it for something...)

This is one of my favorite hor's d'oeurve recipes for entertaining. Guests absolutely gobble them up. Do find (or make) Quince jam; it is essential. While the recipe does call for some last minute preparation, it is well worth it.

these are delicious! many of my friends love stilton, so we piled it on. as far as the puff pastry rounds went, i baked the rounds, and then pulled them apart, making two rounds, and then layered the quince jam and stilton on what would have been the inside. no trimming necessary!
