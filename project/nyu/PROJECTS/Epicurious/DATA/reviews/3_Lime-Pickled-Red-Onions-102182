These onions have a very different, unique taste. They are very good if you have the right thing to eat them with.

Excellent. I doubled this recipe and used them in a salad with mandarin oranges, toasted walnuts and my favorite recipe for vinagerette (adding a little of the mandarin orange juice to the dressing).

These are delicious! Fortunately when I made them I made too many for the recipie we were having at the time. My husband continued to use them as a condiment on other things and even ate them right out of the bowl! This is a unique condiment that I'm sure would be welcome at many gatherings.

What a surprise this was. The flavor was great. I served it with grilled steak, and it was a hit.

Goes great with meatloaf. We left the cilantro out, and it was still great. We'll make it again
