I made this recipe last night for dinner and found that it kept well for lunch the next day. I think that the cooking time is too long, as I simmered it for less time than required and it was still a bit on the mushy side. Instead of oregano, I used Italian seasoning and it came out very well. Make sure to use good olives, not the canned sliced black ones. I used Kalamata olives. Nice flavors with a bit of a spicy bite in the finish.

Like the previous review, i didnt make the onion or pepper mixture in advance. The recipe was super easy to make, though towards the end i added crushed tomatoes to make it more saucy i also added a lot of crushed red pepper flakes. All in all it was a hit.

This recipe was easy to make and it was healthy and delicious. I hadn't made the "onion and garlic mix" or the "broccoli and red bell pepper mix" ahead of time, so I just chopped up one medium onion (I doubled the recipe), 4 cloves of garlic, 1 red pepper and about 1 cup of raw broccoli. Then, I sautéed them in olive oil for about 5 minutes before making the rest of the recipe. I also added some pre-cooked chicken at the same time as I added the artichoke hearts. Hearty, healthy and delicious!
