Delicious recipe. I added thinly sliced carrots for color, also flash boiled. I would back off on the butter, however. Next time I will try it with 1/2 T. butter.

This was fantastic... I did substitute white wine for sake and soy sauce for miso (couldn't find it here) and was still great.

I substituted dry sherry instead of sake and used more miso (an extra tsp) and the beans turned out beautifully - I will definitely be making these again!
