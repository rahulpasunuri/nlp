Amazing! As everyone said moist on the inside, crispy on the outside. Best thing about it is the way the savory just gives the chicken so much flavor. I did it with the deglazing sauce and recommend that too.

I did turn the chicken on its sides while roasting and enjoyed the way that method browned the lower parts of the bird nicely - Visually very appetizing. Chicken was very moist and flavorful... I stuffed the cavity of the bird as well, using the same ingredients mixed with bread crumbs, and made a gravy out of the glaze for a more traditional meal, with great results. Only problem - smokes heavily - was afraid my fire alarm would go off!

Thought it was good, but cooking time was off, and needs a lot of seasoning. Not sure if "stuffing" is enough for flavor

This was not only fun to make but it was absolutely delicious. Had a bit of trouble when turning the chicken...it stuck to the roasting pan. Nevertheles the inside was wonderfully tender and the outside was perfectly crispy. I definitely recommend pairing it with the deglazing sauce.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made the stuffing in the morning. I didn't cook on all 3 sides. I put in breast side up and cooked it fully from there. I served with sauteed potatoes and skillet-glazed baby carrots and sugar snap peas. I did find however that the chicken tended to smoke a lot when cooking. I had to open the windows to vent.

This is a great recipe. I did not like to roast the chicken on the sides and move around.I put mine on a wire grill in a roasting pan breastside up at 350 basting once in a while. Turned out perfect, skin crisp, meat full of flavor from the stuffing. Serve with patato dumplings and haricots verts a la lyonnaise.
