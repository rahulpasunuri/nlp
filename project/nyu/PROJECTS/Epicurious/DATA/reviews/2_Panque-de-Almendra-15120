Did I do something wrong? I've baked enough before to consider myself quite capable but this turned out all wrong. I used the cornstarch but otherwise followed it. The loaf fell while cooling and there was this thick layer of- I don't know what (almonds & egg?) on the bottom. I tried the sponge/cake layer and it wasn't very good. I'd love to hear if anyone else made this and how it turned out.
