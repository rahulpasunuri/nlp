A friend made this for me and I begged for the recipe. I never knew meat loaf could taste so good.

My Fiance LOVED this meatloaf. I just added some tomato paste and a few more herbs like oregano . It makes a ton, especially for two people we had leftovers for the week.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever eaten.

I am very pleased with this recipe. I substitute ground pork for the veal, but do not tamper with it otherwise. The consistency is firm and dense, which makes for excellent slicing and sandwich-making once cold. It has a big, meaty flavor, with just the right amount of onion. The proportions given here will feed a small army of meat loaf fans.

i was craving some meatloaf so i thought i would try a diffrent recipe to change it up. BIG MISTAKE. something about this just did not work for me it was incredible dense more brick like than anything and the taste was just off it was missing something but i just dont know what. it may have been the lemon or the sausage that threw me off i have no idea. If your looking for a meatloaf recipe there are better ones on this site [the crusty mustard dill comes to mind and it taste even better cold the next day] this is definatly not something that i would even try making again it just gave meatloaf a bad name

I didn't have any lemon zest or italian sausage on hand, so I added some thyme, chili pepper flakes, and tobasco. It was quite tasty!

I skipped the veal and the sausage (didn't have on hand) and thought this was a good, uncomplicated meat loaf. Everyone enjoyed it. Also, I added a little tomato paste to it.

The sausage makes this a standout. It was excellent hot, cold, or at room temperature. It lasted for quite a few leftovers, and every time I brought it out I had to fight off hungry vultures who kept picking at it right out of the foil.

Very good and tasty. Next time I will use a bit less of the hot sausage - while the sausage taste was nice, it was a bit overpowering

After 35 years of marriage to a meat loaf lover I finally helped him achieve meat loaf nirvana. Spicy, delicious and sort of like a country pate; great sandwiches!

We all really liked this recipe - the addition of the hot sausage was a good one. And if you believe, as we do, that the test of a superior meat loaf is how it tastes on a sandwich the next day, then this one is tops.

This was good, but I have a better one: two pounds ground beef, one packet Good Seasons Italian dressing mix, one cup Italian flavored bread crumbs, one egg, one chopped onion, six minced garlic cloves, a little flatleaf parsley, about 1/3 cup of a good canned/jarred spaghetti sauce, mix 'em up. Form an oblong "patty" with the mixture, the length of the loaf pan by about 14 inches. On top of this lay six rounds of Provolone cheese and four to six slices of sliced sandwich ham or Prosciutto, then roll up into a loaf and place in loaf pan. Sprinkle Parmesan/Reggiano cheese on top, bake at 350 for one hour. Drain fat. Top with mor spaghetti sauce if desired. Yum.

This was wonderful. The only changes/additions I made were: no veal, just beef and sausage; covered the top with sliced green olives and prosciutto (harkening back to the bacon-topped versions). Yummy.

Manly, yes; but I like it too. Undoubtedly the Irish Spring of meat loaves. The foil technique is a little cumbersome; I'll probably just lightly grease the pan next time. As other cooks suggested I made a few minor additions and it was HUGE. I used a second smaller loaf pan for the excess. I'd recommend reducing the ingredients proportionally to about 75%.

Good suggestions: added mushrooms, a little extra onion and green pepper. Also, balanced the meat at 1 lb. veal and 1 lb. beef. Served it up to a friend, my harshest critic, with homestyle potatoes. He went nuts! THIS is a keeper!

I'm not a big meat loaf fan, but my partner is, but we both agreed it was a liitle heavy on the lemon...and I used slightly less than the recipe called for...but we found the lemon intriguing. I would also use less Italian sausage next time. I used NO veal, instead I used ground pork.

Great flavor from the lemon zest! Very unique. I didn't have a problem with dryness. I used 20% fat beef, and because of the previous reviewer, finely chopped up about 1/4 cup of white mushrooms that I had lying around. The mushrooms threw a little water into the loaf, enough to moisten and offer some mushroomy accent.

This meatload had an excellent flavor but came out a little dry. Probably next time I'll add a can of crushed tomatoes or about a half cup of ketchup. The sausage flavor though, gives it the nice little kick missing out of most meatloaves.
