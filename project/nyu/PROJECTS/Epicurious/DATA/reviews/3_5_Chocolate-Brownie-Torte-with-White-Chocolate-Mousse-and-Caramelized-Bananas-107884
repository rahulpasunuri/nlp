While no particular element was difficult it took some time to create and assemble so imagine my deep dismay when, like other reviewers, the entire mousse collapsed when released from the pan. (I too followed directions eggs-actly.) I found the brownie to be a nice contrasting compliment to the very sweet mousse. Because of mousse collapse I served it in individual bowls with chocolate sauce drizzled over each portion. Everyone loved it but one wonders if the photo version isn't covered w/hairspray to keep it together!!!!

The mousse part of this is delicious! The brownie however is dry and boring. I also did not love the sauce. Overall, I would not make again.

WOW! Absolutely beautiful dessert. Not difficult to make. I didn't serve it with the caramelised bananas, instead made a fresh mixed berry salad, which matched really well. Still used the bittersweet chocolate sauce.

very delicious but don't put the sauce on until you're ready to serve! it fell into a delicous pile after i sauced it and i was very sad as i had worked very hard on it and would've liked for it to be pretty...

Wow, I thought this was one of the very best new dessert recipes I've tried in a long time. Easy, a bit different and totally delicious. Everyone who ate it agreed. I figured you can also do the bananas in a skillet - a quick toss with some butter & brown sugar. We poured the chocolate sauce over the whole thing!

I made this for a dear friends Birthday Dinner last night. I read the reviews after making the torte as I was looking at the best way to carmelize the banana's . The reviews had me very worried! I had no problem making the torte nor the mousse, it held up beautifully. I did leave it in the refrigerator overnite before adding the banana's. The torte was a huge hit, my friends loved it. I do agree that the white chocolate does not stand out with the banana topping, but I thought all the flavors together were delicious as did my guests. We added the chocolate on our individual pieces instead of drizzling it over the whole torte. I will be making this again!

My family does a dessert contest for Christmas every year and as a last minute decision I picked this. I won the taste vote but lost in presentation. I followed the recipe to a T and found that mine wasn't as sweet as other reviews said. The banana's were pretty but it was missing the WOW factor.

Meh. It looked good until I un-sprung the pan, and then the mousse slumped. Flavors were good, but not great. People gobbled it up, but it felt heavy for taste. I should have read the reviews before getting started!

Although my husband and guests liked this - I was not thrilled. It was very very messy looking. the bananas did not caramelize properly (my husband thought it was better without the bananas actually) and there was too much chocolate sauce. Although this was okay - there are better dessert recipes out there.

This is a pretty presentation, but the white choc mouse portion is sickly sweet and kills the whole dessert. I made this for a New Years Eve dinner party dessert...poor decision.

Using the white chocolate with coconut cuts the sweetness a bit. I substituted caramel sauce and we loved it. The portion do need to be small because of the richness.

I used white chocolate that had coconut in the bar and that added a nice touch. I had trouble with the mousse the first time I made it, but now its easier. Not too much manipulation of the mousse is key.

After reading all the horrible reviews, I made the brownie from this recipe and instead used to ice cream from the brazilian banana and white chocolate tart from this site. I topped it off with caramelized bananas with butter, sugar, and 151, cooled before. This was a huge hit! Quite possible the best dessert I've ever made.

Rating: 2
Blech! The recipe sounded delicious. And all of the individual elements were quite tasty. However, put together they were sugar-overload. In a way that made the dessert no fun to eat. I think replacing the white chocolate mousse with some other, less sugary mousse, might be a way to salvage the recipe.

This dish was way to sweet for me. And my mouse didnt set up well. Based on the mousse being too soft/runny i didnt even try the carmelized bananas. But I will try again using some of the suggestions from the other memebers.

Very Rich, Make sure that the brownie is fully cooled. Otherwise the mousse will be runny.

I was quite disapointed with the turnout. Presentation was ok, and definitely didn't look like the picture. I think making the mousse also requires some practice, it sunk when in the fridge, maybe becasue the cream was not as fluffy as it should be. I got some good feedback, but no raves...I wouldn't make it again.

I made this for a New Year's party and it was a hit with the revelers - it is a delightful presentation after all. The white chocolate mousse is really quite good, though adding a bit less of the white chocolate would make for a less sticky-sweet treat. I thought that the brownie was a bit dry and that the bananas would really benefit from the crispiness of a good torching. Overall, nothing really stood out for me. Since this is a mildly complicated dessert to assemble, and making mousse can be a nuisance without properly chilled cream and bowls, I don't think it would be worth it to make again.

Rating: 4
I made this for a friend's birthday and it was a huge hit. I agree with those who say to chill the mousse and I too think the bananas come out better in a saute pan. I took it one step further and finnished the bananas with sugar and a tourch. I liked the brule texture it gave the bananas, it creates a nice texture contrast.

My fiance and I made this together for Valentines Day a year ago and we both agree that this was our favorite dessert ever! The form was not perfect - I think we rushed into combining the brownie and the mouse, but it tasted amazing even if it didn't look beautiful.

Great presentation! Made the brownie cake a day ahead of time and slightly under baked. Made for more tender/moist result. I also made the mousse in advance...made for better assembly in the end. Carmelized the bananas in saute pan vs broiler w/butter and peloncio (mexican style brown sugar). The bananas glaze beatifully and add a wonderful layer of flavor! This was made for an open house event and recieved thumbs up!!!

It is a very nice birthday cake. However, the chocolate mousee needs to be put in the fridge for a while before topping the torte with it.

I didn't think this would be as good as it was, but I was quite impressed with how tasty it turned out to be. I brought this over to a friend's house, and everyone there loved it. (I chose this recipe because my husband is a banana freak, and one of the guests was allergic to nuts, which limited my options.)

Made this for my mom's 42nd birthday since she loves bananas but both she and my father didn't eat it because it was "too sweet!" the 7 kids liked it though. the mousse part is so sweet+wet it compliments the dry+noextrasugaradded brownie part well. use a quality white chocolate is all I have to say. fun times.

Although the mousse was indeed not as firm as I would have liked (something which can be adjusted), the dish received rave reviews from everyone who tasted it. It's a keeper. Those who used raspberries: try the bananas. I'm not a real banana dessert fan, but they worked very well with the other ingredients.

Rating: 4
I brought this to a pot luck lunch and people went nuts over it. Like another reviewer, I used raspberries, since I couldn't do the bananas at the last minute. I think the freezer for a bit would work well. Mine set nicely, but in walking over to the lunch, my mousse drooped. I will make this again and again. Wonderful.

Rating: 2
I made this for a work function, and modified it somewhat, using raspberries on top instead of carmelized bananas. The brownie part came out great, but the mousse needed improvement. It only tasted faintly of white chocolate, and it did not set, despite the fact that I used half a package of unflavored gelatin in it. I would recommend using another mousse recipe. It presents really nicely though.

Made this for a family dinner. Everyone loved it. I made it before I read the reviews, had visions of it oozing all over, and stuck it in the freezer for a couple of hours. Although, I don't think I needed to - it looked like it set well. I used El Rey white chocolate. The brownie layer seemed dry and I agree with other reviewer that less baking time might help retain moistness. Also, I served the bananas on the side and drizzled the chocolate on the mousse.

This is my first time reviewing a recipe on this site. I must first say that I come to epicurious ALOT and have never been disappointed. However, this recipe didnt WOW me. My guests were impressed by the presentation - I thought it looked O.K.. I took the advise of another reviewer and added 1/2 package of gelatin (I softened it first in whipping cream, then melted it befor I added it too the mousse). It stayed together nicely,but I thought the bananas made the presentation look like they had been on the counter for a week. I also thought the cake was very sweet. The recipe was just not what I expected therefore I probably won't make it again.

Rating: 3
It tasted fantastic but it turned into a soupy mess in the pan. The next time I make it, I will either serve it trifle-style in a big dish or make individual parfaits for everyone. The caramelized bananas were the perfect partner for all that white chocolate.

Yowza!! This beautiful dessert is a show stopper. I've made it twice and gotten rave reviews both times. Both times I served it without the bananas and with caramel and chocolate sauces on the side. I also garnished the top with striped chocolate curls - stunning! This dessert is so easy to prepare, and so delicious...it's worth the effort every time.

Rating: 2
The recipe itself was pretty good. It could have used some gelatine to set up, but as I was doing this for a class assignment, I had enough time to freeze it. The bananas were a bit of a pain, and didn't really like how the flavors worked. I'm not a fan of white chocolate, so next time I may make some alterations.

Rating: 3
This was delicious! My family loved it. I will definitely make this again. I did read the reviews first for some advice. I omitted the bananas this time. I used Baker's white chocolate and Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate chips. For the mousse I added a half packet of gelatin dissolved in a little boiling water and added it to the white chocolate mixture while it was melting. I put the finished product in the freezer for an hour and then placed in the fridge and prepared the chocolate sauce. I served it after finishing the sauce. It wasn't hard and the mousse held perfectly. It was a hit.

Note to self: read the reviews BEFORE making a new dish for a party!! My mousse didn't set up either and since it was too late for gelatin, I froze it. It was FAB! It was a little hard to cut the brownie part, but my guests raved nonetheless. I'll make it this way again!

The first time I made this torte I followed the recepie exactly and it did not set at all. But the second time I made it I adjusted the recepie and it came out perfectly! to stay on the safe side with the mousse I used high quality white chocolate with 28% cocao, I also added 1 bag of unflavored gelatine mixed with a little bit of water (i added gelatine to the white chocolate mixture while it was melting). Also, make sure you cool your white chocolate before you FOLD IN egg white and whipped cream. I also skipped caramelizing bananas since I love fresh bananas and many of the reviewer before had problems with it. It came out DELICIOUS!!! Probably the best one I've ever tasted!

This was 1 of 3 desserts I made for a large party. This was gone in no time at all. I used scharffenberger bittersweet chocolate and ghiradelli white chocolate. The mousse looked loose when I poured it in the pan, but it set up perfectly overnight. I used heavy whipping cream from Trader Joes which whipped up in less than 2 minutes; it must have a higher fat content. The mousse was light and complimented the rich fudgy brownie base. The bananas made it difficult to cut. Make sure the bananas are just ripe with very few spots or they will turn to mush under the broiler. Since some people didn't care for them anyway, I'll use them to garnish individual plates next time.

Rating: 3
I found this dessert to be incredible. However, I attempted the white chocolate mousse recipe twice and neither time it came out to be the right consistency. I ended up using an old recipe of mine using 1/4 cup of whipping cream with 1 cup of white chocolate on the burner and then combining that with 1 1/2 cups of whipping cream. After that the dessert was truly a success! It is a must for all chocolate lovers!

Rating: 4
I absolutely loved this recipe. The white chocolate mousse was the best part. Everyone agreed they would happily eat it by the vat if served to them separately. The banannas came out nice, however, I like one reviewers suggestion of using a brulle-torch to get the carmel on the banannas crisper. The chocolate torte was also exceptional, although it is essential not to over cook it. I would definitely make this again. If anyone likes banannas, it is a MUST!

Rating: 3
I used a very high quality chocolate and had no problems with the dish collapsing. In fact, it held its shape at room temp for 30 minutes after I took it out of the pan. It was a little dense though. I cooled the chocolate completely, so am not sure why it didn't retain the air of the egg whites. The bananas were also incredible. Instead of broiling them, I suggest caramelizing them with a kitchen torch. They weren't mushy at all, and had a nice crunch!

Rating: 3
I had a lot of problems with this dessert at first. I made it in a springform pan and when i took it out it compelety colapsed. I found that i needed more wipped cream to stiffin the mousse. I later tried again, but made individual molds and added cointreau to give it a nice flavor. This worked out well. I presented it on a round dish with various sauces, it was a nice presentation!

It's a lot of work, but the results were delicious! I took someone's tip of adding a packet of gelatin to the mousse & had no problem with it setting. I also didn't have a springform pan and used just a glass pie plate, but it still worked fine. Would make again for a special occasion.

I made this for Easter this year, and everyone raved. The mousse came out beautifully, not too sweet and very light, while the brownie was very rich and chocolately. I didn't do the bananas, but next time I will. Definately a recipe to make again.

I made this dessert for Easter and my family liked it very much. The mousse set beautifully and the brownie layer was fudgy. Next time I make this torte I will leave out the carmelized bananas. I might substitute chocolate curls or just a sprinkle of cinnamon. Great recipe!!!

I made this without having read these reviews first. Used callebaut chocolate, with great results. The mousse was a little soft, perhaps should have left in the firdge for longer prior to serving, but as the others have said - use premium white chocolate. No problems with the banannas - only lightly caramalizing them might be the answer for people who had problems

Waaaaaay too sweet! I made this for my husband's birthday, and it was a lot of effort for a dessert that looked better in the magazine than it tasted in real life. I used Baker's chocolate, and while my mousse wasn't completely runny, it sure didn't look anything like the picture, either. The brownie was also too dry (shorten the baking time, perhaps?), and my "caramelized" bananas also turned mushy. None of my guests went back for seconds. I won't be making this recipe again.

For taste, this recipe gets four forks. It was delicious! My mousse did not set very well though, and although it wasn't runny, it wasn't very firm and it did collapse as I was cutting it to serve it. I used Baker's chocolate (as suggested). I did not use gelatin, and I will next time. I also found the caramelized bananas very disappointing! My bananas were perfectly ripe, but after 'caramelizing' them, they tasted awful. I ended up taking them off the mousse and replacing them with fresh strawberries, which was a HUGE improvement.

I overbaked the brownie a bit but my mousse came out perfectly, thanks to tips from other reviewers. My only puzzlement was that my bananas did not carmelize well. The result was that they tasted a bit over-ripe and not carmelized at all, just mushy.

I got scared by the reviews about it being too runny or not setting so I added a few sheets of dissolved gelatin. It worked perfectly.

A rich and delicious dessert. Having read the previous reviews, I added a teaspoon of gelatin to the chocolate while it was hot - in the end, the mousse was soft and barely set, but it stayed put! I messed up and added 2 TBSP of lemon juice to my bananas instead of 2 tsp, so they didn't caramelize as they should have, but no real harm done. I will definitely make it again. I think that other fruits (glazed fresh blueberries?) would work well also.

This was an excellent dish. I used Ghiradelli white chocolate morsels and after the chocolate was melted, I left it to cool for a few hours to come back and have it still in a semi liquid form. The mousse held really well and was delicious. I would definately make this again.

I too had never made a torte, nor mousse. I made it in two stages. I made the torte and the mousse the night before serving and let it set overnight. I carmelized the bananas and let them cool before serving. I had no problem with it being runny, but it could have been firmer set. It was a delicious and impressive desert. Very rich, but very impressive to serve your guests!

Excellent dessert! They all loved it and the mousse held up wonderfully. The others who used candy making chocolate need to realize that thats no baking chocolate and is primarily vegetable oil and will never set. Secret to a runny mousse, adding a box of instant pudding the same flavor will set it.(will thicken up... Just keep adding milk or cream afterwards to get the consistency you want.)

I made this recipe twice. The first time I didn't let the bananas cool very long and the mousse absolutely melted. The second time I let the bananas cool and the mousse still melted(and I mean dripping off the cake plate and all over the counter). I used a candy making white chocolate, maybe that was the problem. The combination of ingredients was good but certainly not the attractive presentation shown in the picture.

There's only one word for this recipe: decadent! As this was my first foray at mousse making, I was definitely nervous, so I added 1/2 teaspoon of unflavored gelatin to the white chocolate (I used Ghiradelli as well) right after I took it off the heat to cool. More for my own peace of mind than for the mousse, I suspect. In any case, the torte and mousse turned out perfectly and I only let the mousse set for 4 hours or so before taking to dinner party. It was fine, didn't run at all. Took cue from another reviewer and let white chocolate COOL COMPLETELY. Had only one dilemma, after carmelizing the bananas, knew that putting them on top would melt mousse, but let them cool and they lose the carmelized sugary crust...I suggest drizzling cake with chocolate sauce for presentation and either putting bananas on the side or on top as your serving. Other than that, it was delicious, everyone loved it!

I did not believe the mousse would set (it was so runny) when everything was combined so I added 1 packet of unflavored gelatin and I thought it set but it didn't. I used Ghiradelli white chocolate (it didn't say how much cocoa butter was in it) and the package said you could microwave it to melt it. Melting it over low heat on my stove would take forever so I microwaved it instead. When I took it out of the springform pan (much to my horror), it ran all over the counter, between the counter, and all over the sink and floor. It was a huge mess and disappointment. I personally don't like really rich chocolate and the brownie part was too rich for my taste. I would not attempt this again. I've made many other wonderful desserts that are just as tasty or more so and are not as risky to prepare. I've made mousse before (other types) and never had a problem with them until now, but have never seen one with egg whites in them.

This was delicious. I made it for my birthday cake. I was not crazy about the bananas - so we just left them off - and drizzled the cake with chocolate sauce. The guests loved it - the kids loved it - a great success story.

Wow! This dish is outrageously delicious! Mousse is always tricky, sometimes mine sets and sometimes it doesn't. There are so many factors. But here's a creative solution if you're nervous about it: Instead of constructing a torte, cut out rounds of the brownie and place them at the bottom of individual oversized wine goblets or dessert dishes. Then top with mousse and bananas. Making individual desserts eliminates the need for slicing so that, in case your mousse is a little on the runny side, no one will really notice. Plus, they look very elegant!

I admit that I am not very good at getting the right consistency from mousses and fillings. The review from Cali almost scared me out of making the recipe. However, the advice from Greenville is right on target. I made the mousse using Lindt white chocolate and followed the Greenville instructions to the letter. It turned out PERFECT!! Thank you Mr. Malik.

In my *professional* experience, the addition of gelatin to the mousse mixture (which is a typical addition for mousse anyway) would allow a better set-up, without weeping. Truthfully, I'm surprised the recipe doesn't include it.

Rating: 4
Just a note for anyone wanting to make this wonderful recipe. At our restaurant (33 Liberty) we use a high quality white chocolate. Now in order to be labeled white chocolate it must be a minimum of 20% cocoa butter and the one we use is 32% cocoa butter. It's cocoa butter that stabilizes chocolate at room temperature and helps this dessert set without gelatin. Check the label of your white chocolate for content. Another tip to keep in mind is once your egg whites are whipped they will immediately begin "weeping" which means they're seperating. Use your whipped egg whites quickly, make sure your white chocolate is cool to the touch and it should set fine.

Boy I am really struggling with the review of this dish, but taste won out and I gave it 4 forks. I made it for a dinner party and just could NOT get the topping to set enough. When I put the bananas on top, just before we left, the topping began oozing over the sides and onto the platter. We just stuck the cake lid on top and drove carefully to our host's house. For looks, this dessert got a "1" as I just scooped the whole glop into bowls. But, oh the taste!! I am assuming that it was my error, but the whites and the chocolate mixture SEEMED to be correct. I will be checking this site again to see if anyone else has this problem, and what the solutions are. Or maybe, it is just ME! But DELICIOUS!!
