Ok, we love this! I took suggestions to up the flavor, and also had to make some substitutions to use what ingredients I had, & I think it helped the flavor. I didn't have white wine open, so I used Marsala. Since I was cooking whole wheat pasta the darker color did't cause any issues for us. Another substitute was a bunch of rainbow chard for the spininch I cooked the onions until they were very carmalized, bumping the flavor, and I had seasoned the peppers with oregano and dried basil when roasting. Extra red pepper flakes, black pepper & thyme also boosted the flavor. I'm going to make this in the fall with roasted butternut squash instead of peppers and goat cheese. Highly recommend!

Very tasty and light! Used jarred red peppers as well, extra thyme and crushed red pepper. Added some diced chicken and goats cheese too! The recipe for the sauce could easily feed four people as an entree..

This was really fantastic. I added a bit extra crushed red pepper, used jarred roasted red peppers and feta. So good!

Heeding the reviewers who thought it was bland, I sauteed a couple chicken thighs in chipotle sauce then proceeded withe onions in the same pan. I also doubled the red pepper and it was excellent. I might have over reduced my sauce as I had to add a little more wine after adding the thickener.

That is delicious! Will definately make this again.

very good. Having made this 2x now I have a few suggestions: 1.) Roasting your own peppers is cool if you've never tried it before, but you can substitute store bought in water or oil and get the exact same effect and cut 50% of the time and effort of this dish. 2.) Another reviewer suggested 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and if you like a little kick to your dishes I would recommend this as well. 3.) In my experience about 1/2 the amount of Parmesan made the dish much cleaner and lighter, allowing the wine thyme and peppers to come out clearer. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great taste, wonderful color & fresh - Will continue revamping - Here's my changes: Used full can of beef broth (14oz) and 1/2C sherry cooking wine to give more depth/flavor since rotini is so big (If using low/no sodium broth, add kosher salt for best flavor at time onions are "sweating"); Used jar of roasted red peppers soaked in H20 & vinegar to save time. Husband LOVED it all! Next time, will try feta, black olives, meat and/or 'shrooms - COOK'S TIP: Roast pine nuts B4 cooking so you avoid being distracted w/burners and oven -I burned a huge batch, such a waste :-(

I agree with the cooks who say this dish is pretty bland and boring. We put in 4 times the crushed pepper to give it some zing. This dish is missing something, just can't figure out what it is. Made for an OK dinner last night, but won't make again.

Definately Good. Used organic whole wheat Rotelle instead and 1/2 teaspoon of chili flakes which added a nice hint of heat.

I added chicken breasts and used 2 jars of roasted oil packed peppers, and low carb pasta (12 oz). It was really good. The only one who didn't like it was my daughter, and she won't eat anything.

I loved it! It reminded me of all that I like about italian and mexican food. I used tri-color pasta which not only tasted great, but looked incredible. I agree with the other reviewer that it would a good "holiday" pasta because of the appearance, however it's pretty light and a good summertime side as well. Highly recommend.

It had just the ingrediants I had on hand. It was good, but not very exciting.

Very good. Used penne instead and it worked fine. Also used parsley since I didn't have spinach and it gave the dish a tangy flavor without the water of spinach. Peeling the roasted peppers can be a bit time-consuming but the flavor is worth it. The sauce has nice consistency without the fat. Would definitely make again.

I think this is an okay recipe. It's a good way to get some spinach into your diet, however I thought it was a little bland. My adjustments probably added to the problem. I used a whole pound of pasta, and rather than roasting two red peppers, I sautéed one red, yellow and orange pepper in a little olive oil.

Fabulous dish! I made some minor changes: I cut the peppers first and roasted them in the oven for 1/2 an hour at 375. I also used a full pound of rotini. I will absolutely make this again. Next time, I will use 2 red, 2 yellow, and 2 orange peppers (I love peppers) and only 1/2 cup of the cheese!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. Having read the rave reviews, I was expecting something wonderful, but I'm afraid I found it on the bland side, and my husband agreed. It seemed a bit more flavorful the next day, which is why I am giving it two forks instead of one, but I don't think we will be making it again. I am always searching for good pasta recipes to add to my collection, so I was disappointed that this one just didn't work for us.

Wow! What a simple and delicious meal. I used red and yellow bell peppers and a bit more spinach. I severed this with cheese stuffed tortellini. I will be making this again very soon!

Good full flavored pasta. I was struck by the brilliant colors; it looked like Christmas. Perhaps it would be a good dish to serve during the holidays. The sauce tasts much richer than one might suspect from the ingredients...tasted like cream. It is now in my favorite recipes box.

Omitted the spinach and used vermouth rather than wine. Very good.

This is a good easy dish. It's now in my permanent file. Try it, you'll like it!

We loved this dish. I will use only one red pepper when I make it again, my children felt the red pepper strips overpowered their favorite part, the pasta! I also didn't have a big enough pan to include all the spinach, so I used only half. It was still great.

Recipes are guidelines, this one is a great base from which to experiment. To the individual in Florida, was that really necessary? TOO MUCH INFORMATION.

Very tastey pasta dish. Doubled if not tripled the crushed red pepper and added grilled chicken at the end. Yum! Would wait until served to add the parmesean cheese. It can get a bit gookey if tossed in the pan too long.

We loved this dish! Unlike other white wine pasta recipes I have tried, this was not bland at all. It had great flavor and a terrific zip from the crushed red pepper.

This recipe was nothing special. I must say, though, that for a few days after eating it, I kept emitting a nasty-smelling gas. My wife just couldn't seem to get the smell out of any of my underpants.

Wow...I'm really surprised by the two previous reviews of this recipe. I saw the recipe in the Nov. issue and tried it as I had the ingredients on hand. I think this is one of the best pasta dishes ever. Not only does it have great taste, but the different textures of the pasta, spinach and pine nuts make it a joy to eat. I only used a cup of chopped onions (personal preference), and I used two 7 oz. jars of roasted red peppers for ease. Also, the only dry white wine I had on hand was a dry Riesling, which worked very well in this dish. I can't wait to make it for friends sometime. I'd love to see some others try this dish and hear what they think, too.

Beautiful but boring...The roasted peppers and spinach give this dish a lovely, festive look for a vegetarian Christmas Eve table, but I felt the pine nuts were more intrusive than interesting, and the overall effect was bland, bland, bland. IF I were to make this dish again, I would try it with Gorgonzola or feta cheese, and perhaps some kalamata olives to give it a little more zip.

I needed to add almost double the cheese. It was o.k. not great. The kids ate it up.
