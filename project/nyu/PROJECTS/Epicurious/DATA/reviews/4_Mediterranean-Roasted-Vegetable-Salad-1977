This was really awesome. The only thing I changed was that I skipped the eggplant because it's not my family's favorite, and I grilled everything but the potatoes. I usually make grilled veggies with a simple basil, EVOO, garlic, and s & p mix, but this was a very nice change of pace and I will do it again.

I have made this salad since it was published in Bon Appetitin 1994 as part of a 4 salad menu for entertaining. The other 3 salads (orzo and shrimp, asian chicken linguine, and tabbouleh with lamb) are also great, and the combination for a crowd can't be beat. The changes that I make in this salad are to eliminate the peppers as we can't eat them and to use Parmigiano Reggiano instead of Pecorino Romano which I think is too strong. I often make this salad to serve with a fairly plain grilled beef dish of some kind, like steak or roast.

I was looking for something to make for our weekday work lunches, incorporating what was plentiful in the garden. This was delicious! Grilled the eggplant, peppers, onions, and roasted the potatoes. Did not use zucchini or radicchio as I had none available. Added the arugula, basil, etc. as per the recipe and used some leftover Dijon vinaigrette from a French potato salad. Next time, I'd like to try the balsamic version. Grilling the veggies added a sweet, slightly smoky note to the dish.

I have made this salad twice. Both times I have broiled the vegetables. Both times the vegetables have been burnt, even though I do stir, as the recipe indicates. The salad is good, but next time I will grill the vegetables instead of broiling them.

I made this for a party. I had to leave for 30 minutes during which it was devoured except for one piece of potato saved for me. I roasted the potatoes/onions, but grilled everything else in one grill basket, starting with the eggplant, and peppers, then the zuke. I sometimes use a touch of sugar with balsamic vinegar. Good red skinned golden potatoes were great; can't understand anyone throwing this treat out.

this salad ended up very pretty, i left grilled whatever i had on hand: asparagus, mushrooms, zuchinni, eggplant, tomatoes, peppers. i left out the potatoes and didn't miss them at all.

Way too much effort for pretty yucky results. Served at a BBQ for 20 people and had tons left over. Even my husband who will eat anything and everything thought it was nasty and we ended up throwing out the leftovers, which we never do. Don't waste your time on this one.

I've made this salad before and would have given it 3 forks. However, I made it again last night with what I had on hand and scaled it down for a quick accompainment to a steak on the grill -I will make it again and again now just by improvising with whatever is in my refrigerator. Here's what I used: a medium portabella mushroom cap, 1/2 red bell pepper, a medium zuchinni. I cubed these to roughly the same size seasoned with salt and pepper and roasted in the oven - I only had fresh basil and mint which I chopped and added to the roasted veggies after they cooled to room temperature. At the last minute, I tossed in arugula and dressed with a small additional amount of olive oil and a good balsamic then the grated parmesan with a microplane over the top after plating it with the sliced steak fanned out beside it. It made a substantial salad that would be great with any grilled meat. We agreed that the mint was what made the flavors really sing. You know it's there, but it doesn't overpower anything or come off as "minty". I say use this recipe as a guideline and improvise with what you have on hand - I don't think you can go wrong!

I made this for a party and while some guests loved it, I didn't think it was spectacular. I won't make it again.

This was as fantastic as everyone said. I made things easier by just roasting the eggplant in cubes, and it worked just fine. The one thing is that the salad gets a bit soggy as you leave it out for a buffet, so I would probably eliminate adding the fresh greens unless you have a smaller party. The cheese really added a lot of flavor.

What can I add to all the rave reviews? How about some variations so this salad can be served as a main dish? Consider serving this salad - with whatever greens you prefer - on a bed of home-made polenta. Consider using the roasted veggies as a filling for your next omelet. Want to keep it simple? Add slices of jicama for added crunch and texture. To add protein, slice hardboiled eggs into the salad. This can become a FABULOUS MAIN COURSE DISH!

This is the second time I've made this salad. I was serving with grilled lambe kebabs and rice so I didn't want to use potatoes. I used 2 cans (16oz) artichoke hearts, drained instead and it was a FANTASTIC substitution. I roasted them with the red onions until the juice had evaporated and they started to brown and the onions were tender. Fabulous!

This dish was delicious and got lots of praise at a recent potluck. I used spring mix instead of greens in recipe. Important to serve a room temp as it was much much better than cold.

I concur with other reviewers: omitting the potatoes is an important change. Substituted Sweet Balsamic Mustard for the Dijon - balanced the bitterness of the Arugula and Radicchio. We grilled the eggplant and peppers for lack of oven space and it worked fine. This recipe made it into the to-be-made-again box!

An easy summer salad; you can make most of it with little prep and unsupervised roasting the night before. The sweet vegetables play off the bitter salad greens; this was the dinner party's favortie dish of the night. The dressing was just right; I omitted the potatoes. I would say this serves 8 rather than 20.

Big hit at our summer picnic. I grilled the vegies the night before on the barbecue (except potatoes and onions) Spring salad works great.

I cut the amount of radicchio and arugula in the recipe and used spring greens to make up the rest. I also reduced the amount of oil used during roasting. I made this salad for a BBQ this past weekend and it was a hit. Although the vegetable prep and roasting time is somewhat lengthy, the end result is well worth it! This salad is a great vegetable side for a crowd.

Fabulous dish! I've made it many times - used spring mix for easier version.

Delicious. Great way to use summer vegetables. My zucchini was kind of mushy. I cooked it to long and put too much oil on it. Also I left out the arugula and radicchio because I did not have time to go to the store. I served it like a cold vegetable salad.

Have made this several times with great success. Following the suggestions of another reviewer, I made this with Parmesian and mixed field greens which was terrific.

I made this dish to bring to an International Dinner where the participants are world travelers. It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it. Not too difficult but well worth it.

When I first saw this recipe, I did want to make it if the opportunity came up. Not long after it did, a friend said he was having a picnic, and this was the first idea that came to mind. Not a bit was left. When I made it again for another picnic last summer, the same thing happened. It does take some time, but it is worth it. It's convenient that the roasting can be done the day before, with just the dressing and last-minute adds done on party day. An excellent salad!

I have brought this salad to many pot luck barbeques. There is never any left and each time someone has hounded me for the recipe. I substitute Reggiano Parmesan for the romano cheese and use spring salad mix for the radicchio and arugula.
