Opps, silly me! I read this recipe 2x and still made mistakes and it turned out great. 1. used a garlic press and sauteed in butter. 2. had no tomato so added a little chicken broth for extra moisture 3. followed the cooking instructions from there. The results were very garlicky but smoothed out after resting part of the afternoon. Served on rosemary baguette toasted with olive oil topped with thinly sliced fresh mozarella. Nothing left over! EASY

Very easy and makes a beautiful presentation. I softened the goat cheese, added fresh cut basil, salt and pepper then spread it on the toasts. I have also made this using a tomato salad (tomatos, onion, garlic, olive oil, balsamic) on top as well.

This was a delicious addition to my recent cocktail party table. I served 15 different treats. This was the second most requested recipe at the party. The varied textures and tastes made for a very interesting dish. It was easy and quick to make. Definitely a new file in my recipe box.

I was pinched for time with 4 more guests than planned. I molded the goat cheese is a small bowl, turned out onto a plate, and topped with peperonata and served as a spread. Worked very well.

This was really great for a Super Bowl party. I roasted the peppers, because I like them better without the skin. Next time I will rub a clove of cut garlic on the toasts before spreading the cheese. The pepper flakes add a great zing.

This was my husbands dish for our recent gourmet club dinner. It was a hit. Since he chopped the peppers in the food processor it turned out very smooth. He did however, have to let the mixture sit in a sieve for about an hour. Rave reviews!

I have made this twice, so far, for two different potluck get-togethers. This was one of the most-liked and talked about dish brought to the affairs. I have used different flavored goat cheese spreads, and all were very well liked. Several people have asked for, and I have printed up for them, the recipe!
