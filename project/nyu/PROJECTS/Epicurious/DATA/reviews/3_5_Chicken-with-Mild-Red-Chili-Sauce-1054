wonderful spices and such a bland outcome. I used New Mexico chile powder which is supposed to be the same as California so that shouldn't be the problem. I broiled the chicken and should probably have grilled it too add flavor. A recipe I won't be repeating.

With all the spices I couldn't believe it turned out so blah! I broiled the chicken instead of grilled and that may have been a mistake. It is certainly an easy recipe to prepare but I won't be repeating it.

I used skinless chicken breasts and added cayanne pepper. Served it to a bunch of my husbands friends who were helping with landscaping. It was a hit! Used left overs in a salad the next day.

Made this for Valentine's Day and it was a smash hit. As for questions below, 5 minutes is plenty of time if you get it to a good boil, not just a simmer, but stir it. California Chiles are a mild mexican chile used in enchiladas and chile rellenos. The powder is a very common ingredient in Mexican dishes and has a great flavor that's key to this dish. They can be found almost anywhere here in California, but I would look wherever they sell other mexican spices. It usually coms in little 2 or 3 ounce packets for about 75 cents.

Is it safe to serve the marinade after only heating it for 5 minutes? Would the chicken juices be cooked enough after 5 minutes?

I made this dish last year as a part of my Valentine's day dinner for my boyfriend and it was absolutely wonderful. Tastes really good with a roasted pepper salad and a light pasta with some chardonnay.

I added a little cayenne, and it was delicious. Great recipe, and really easy, since I made the marinade the night before.

I made this dish for a Valentine's Day dinner date who ate three whole pieces!! We loved it - the flavor of the sauce is great. One note however, just as the title says, it is a MILD chile sauce.

This is a favorite recipe at my house. The flavor of the chili sauce is great. I make extra chicken and then grill vegetables and use the leftover chicken and vegetables for a cold chicken salad the next day.

This recipe is a family favorite. It is simple to make, and the chicken remains very moist after cooking. This goes well with rice or cous cous, and a simple fruit salad.
