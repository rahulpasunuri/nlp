Unique and delicious, although I did make several adjustments. Upped the bacon to 6 slices, garlic to 2 - 3 cloves, parmesan to 1 cup, nuts to 1/2 cup. Added in one small chopped onion (added in with garlic) and 1 1/2 - 2 c. halved cherry tomatoes (added in after corn is taken out). Subbed walnuts for pine nuts and chicken broth for olive oil. Also, added all the basil and bacon in with everything. Definitely making again.

Lovely dish, a fav of my husbands. Added more pepper flakes to kick it up a notch, as well as more garlic and pine nuts. Made a double batch to try on pizza crust. Anyone tried that yet? Found this recipe on the following website first: lottieanddoof.com Definitely a pesto to use with a thicker pasta - made the mistake of using linguine once. Ick.

This didn't wow or amaze - it didn't offend, either, but there's just not enough flavor here to warrant a repeat. Make sure your corn is uber fresh and flavorful, as it is the primary taste. Highly recommend adding spice too, like a healthy pinch of crushed red pepper. And toast the pine nuts well too - pine nuts have such a luscious, delicate flavor that they often get lost in a dish like this - sadly the case, as the parmesan , basil, garlic and corn took over completely.

This was really good! The bacon is completely unnecessary though and the recipe made more than enough sauce for 1 lb. of fresh pasta. Topped with a chopped tomato for some color and it was superb.

Interesting - but the corn pesto ends up a lot like creamed corn which isn't my ideal pasta sauce. I probably won't make this again - time intensive, gets a lot of dishes dirty and the payoff wasn't that great.

Awesome way to eat decadent pasta without all the cream and butter. I think I snuck some extra bacon and garlic in, but otherwise made as written. Loved it! Made a full batch, and had lunch-box leftovers for a week.

This sauce is fantastic! It's almost like a cream sauce. I generally follow the recipe but add an extra clove of garlic, a small onion and a pinch of chili flakes. I cook the onion and garlic in the bacon fat and then add the corn. I also like to toss in other veggies, in particular cherry tomatoes and asparagus. When I pull the corn out to puree it, I simply add a little reserved bacon fat to the pan and saute them until the tomatoes are starting to burst. Usually I cut the sauce with broth instead of olive oil. It's not as creamy in the end but helps make up for all of that bacon fat and parmesan.

I made this today with leftover grilled corn on the cob. I processed the corn with a little olive oil, parmesan cheese, a handful of basil and sunflower seeds (my daughter is allergic to nuts and I have found the sunflower seeds work beautifully instead - just watch out for salt). I served with whole wheat shells and added some sun dried tomatoes and sauted zuchinni rounds. Loved it!

Made this tonight for dinner and WOW!! It is so good. Had to use frozen corn but it didn't seem to affect the taste. I served it with pork chops and asparagus. I think it would be great with grilled chicken. Will add this to the menu often.

So incredibly good, especially when corn is in season. It does make a little too much sauce, so if you don't want to waste you could adjust.

Deliciously different, everyone who tries this absolutely loves it. I substitute toasted walnuts for the pine nuts usually (just because I always seem to have walnuts in my pantry, but other than that I follow the recipe to the letter. Dreamy good. The only negative comment I can share - I never seem to have left overs! : )

VERY GOOD EVEN WITH FROZEN CORN! Here in Miami we're backwards, so our fresh corn comes in March. But using good quality frozen Silver Queen corn kernels, this came out great. I wanted a one-dish meal for 3 people, so I made 6 oz. of pasta and basically halved the sauce recipe (lots of sauce). I added a 5 ounce bag of spinach to the pasta cooking water as it was done, then drained and kept the water. Used the pasta water instead of OO in the pesto recipe. Oh - used pancetta instead of bacon - don't think that matters. After mixing the pesto and the pasta, put out smoked salmon trimmings (available here after the Jewish holidays very cheap and very good) to mix in or eat on the side. Yummy - like a creamy pasta sauce, without the cream or butter.

This was surprisingly good. I thought it maight be too sweet, but the cheese and bacon really balanced it out. Delicious. Equally good the next day.

Wow. This is the best thing I have made in quite a while. Corn in pasta -- who knew? The sweetness of the corn was perfectly matched by the bacon and parmesan cheese, and the fresh basil put it over the top. I halved the pesto recipe as other suggested and found that it made plenty to coat 8 oz. of pasta. Make this while there's still fresh sweetcorn to be had!

This was good, not fantastic. It's a nice refreshing change, as one of my guests said "I've never had corn in my pasta before'. Good, just not out of this world.

I was skeptical, but it looked like a dish full of summer, and with fall approaching I thought I would try to retain summer for another night. I was amazed at how good this was. Get good fresh corn and you're set. The pesto made more than enough - I'm wondering what else I can use it for or I'll make this dish again tomorrow night. Next time, I'll add scallops or shrimp for a more complete main dish. I did add some pan-roasted cherry tomatoes which added a nice acidity/deeper flavor to the dish, but I enjoyed the bites without the tomato just as much as with.

Rating: 4
This dish is the essence of summer! Delicious and creative twist on pesto. 4 ears of corn produced 4 cu of kernels so I went by the cup measure rather than the ear count. Produced enough pesto to easily combine with 16 oz pasta (which I did) with room to spare. Not sure about the instruction to "coarsely tear" the basil. I did this for the first 1/2 cu but it didnt blend that well into the dish. I finely chopped the remaining basil leaves and found this released the flavor and blended into the dish much better. Overall, this was a big hit!

Rating: 4
This was a very delicious and unique pasta dish. I enjoyed the saltiness of the bacon and cheese with the sweetness of the corn. I agree that the pesto recipe makes way too much, and next time I will cut it in half. I served it over fresh tagliatelle from our farmers market with seared scallops and a tomato salad dressed with lime juice, olive oil and salt and pepper. The acidity of the salad helps cut the richness of the pasta. To the person who used clam juice and couldn't figure out why your finished dish "tasted fishy" - ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!?!? Get a clue!

Rating: 4
Based on earlier reviews, I only made 1/2 of the pesto recipe, and this was more than ample for 8 oz of pasta. I subbed toasted pumpkin seeds for the pine nuts, used slightly more bacon than called for, and added some chopped fresh tomatoes as a garnish. This was a lovely recipe, and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I'll definitely make this again while fresh corn is in season.

This was an excellent dinner, well worth the time and effort. The most time consuming thing was cutting the kernels off the cob for me, I haven't yet invested in one of those zippers. I subbed walnuts in for pine nuts, since I didn't have them on hand and it was still delicious. I did not find the sweetness of the corn overpowering at all. I used 4 large ears of sweet summer white corn. I was about to use the recommended 6 ears but then decided to measure out the 4 cups. I think perhaps those getting the thick hummus-like texture had too much corn to begin with? I'd definitely recommend actually measuring out 4 cups of kernels instead of just going with the 6. As others mentioned, save the starchy pasta water to thicken up the final dish and help the pesto coat the pasta better. Others used more basil, but I would use less the next time around as the taste was very overpowering for me, personally. Then again, I didn't think my dish was overly sweet. I made the dish with orecchiette, which I thought was just perfect!

Loved it. Thought it was perfect and delicious. I had to leave out the pine nuts because of my son's allergies and it was still very tasty. I also think there is enough sauce for a pound of pasta. Can't wait to have it again.

I was expecting super fresh, summertime flavors, and was disappointed to find that the cheese and bacon overpowered a lot of the sweetness of the corn. I added diced tomatoes at the end, which lent a nice brightness to the sauce. I'll make it again, but with less cheese and with the bacon on the side!

Recipe was easy and came out as planned (used a lot of the pasta water to thin sauce), but in the end the taste of the corn pesto was not appealing to me. A bit of a disappointment.

I love this recipe. It's such an unique pasta and perfect for late summer when fresh corn is all around. I don't eat cheese, so I left that out. Still delicious. Cook's tip. It helps to get the pesto scrapings out of the food processor by putting the reserved pasta water in the processor. Thus, some of the bits mix with the water that will be used to thin out the sauce.

This dish will undoubtedly make regular appearances on my summer menus! Though it is likely still delicious when executed as written, I did make a few minor changes... blended some of the basil into the corn pesto, thinned the sauce somewhat with pasta water, and tossed in some halved grape tomatoes. Absolutely fabulous!

what a great way to enjoy fresh summer corn! i used fakon (fake bacon) instead of the real stuff and it worked fine and still gave the sauce a smokey flavor. the corn pesto is incredibly creamy and has a great texture with the pasta. next time i think i will add fresh, halved cherry tomatoes to the pasta mix right before serving.

Meh. This was OK -- but I realize that may have been because I used veggie bacon and cut the olive oil back by half. Funny how things don't taste as good when you cut back the fat, huh?

This was delicious. I added chopped chicken breast to make it a meal instead of the bacon. Spinach avocado salad on the side. A little red pepper flakes to give it a little kick seemed appropriate too. I'm not sure I would have ever thought to make a corn pesto but I'm glad someone else thought of it!

I found the texture of the sauce exceptional. Rich, creamy and bacon-y, reminiscent of carbonara. Used fresh corn from the farmer's market, a bit sweet, but balanced nicely with the bacon and nuts. I found it nice for summer; while it was creamy, the fresh crunch of the corn reminds you of the season!

Really, really tasty, and not terribly difficult or expensive to make. As for the whole corn menu, I found that partly because corn is so sweet, I can get tired of it and want some contrast. But this dish I loved and will certainly make again.

This recipe is creative and worth trying, but I found that it took much more than the estimated 45 minutes prep time. With husking the corn, cooking it, and then cutting the kernels, it's a bit labor intensive. I would increase the number of bacon slices to 6 or 7 and also increase the basil to balance out the sweetness of the corn.

The corn I used was fresh from the farm. I added fresh basil, thyme and oregano. The result was a greenish sauce which was tasty, but on the sweet side because of the corn. This tastes better than it looks.

I'd like to give this 3.5 forks. (To Zoaster from VA - you have to add the pasta water to make it "sauce-y." Without the water, you are right, it is like bad hummus.) As others say here, it's not a light dish. My husband said it would be great in the winter, but you wouldn't have the fresh corn then. Made the sauce as written using fresh bi-color corn from the farmer's market. We really enjoyed it, but it didn't send me to the moon. (Those are the dishes that get 4 forks!) It is monochromatic, so I added a little diced red bell pepper to the whole kernels before adding them back into the pot. Also threw in a handful of tiny red cherry tomatoes for more color. I added snapped green beans to the pasta water in the last minutes of the boiling time for even more color and veggies to cut some of the starchiness of the corn AND the pasta. I really don't think the bacon added much to the dish - the little bit of crunch was nice, but I think the suggestions of serving with shellfish (although, that would really add to the sweetness factor) or steak are really good ones. Will make again, really because I love corn!

Great summer dish. It's all about the corn that you use - I used about 1/4 sweet corn and the rest, a mix of yellow and white. I added half of the basil in the food processor and then mixed in the remainder (plus) as directed. I also used more garlic and parm than the recipe called for. The pine nuts weighted the flavor a little too much for me, so I will cut back a little on that next time. Will defintely make again.

This recipe was outstanding. A lot to do but sooo worth it. I also added some freshly steamed lobster to the dish and that sent it over the top. My husband and I were in heaven. My son wasn't big on it as he likes his pasta with lots of red sauce. He's a teen, he has time to build his palate. I also think that I should've added some of the basil to the food processor along with the corn and the oil. I didn't taste enough basil. I used opal and spicy globe basil (as that is what is growing) and also a bit of fresh tarragon and mint. It was outstanding.

This was delicious. I served it with the grilled mustard chicken from the same issue. Would go equally well with beef, pork, or seafood. I've read suggestions from some of the other reviewers about adding some onion and upping the parmesan cheese. All makes good sense. But, really, I thought it was amazing just as written. I agree with many of the other reviewers that this makes way more pesto than you'd want for 8 oz. of pasta. You will definitely have leftovers. But considering how good this was, I'm okay with that.

In theory, this is a great recipe but my version was borderline inedible! Perhaps not giving it enough thought, I used ears of "peaches and cream" corn which is incredibly sweet. The result was a sugary-sweet pesto supplemented by pops of sugar with the remaining kernels. I suppose I could try it again with a different variety of corn but I was so put off by the candy-flavoured version I made this weekend that I doubt I will.

This recipe was in the section for "I can barely cook". It was very labor intensive & not really a good start for a true novice. It was, however, very yummy! In the future I will try using frozen corn instead of fresh off the cob - and will add cooked chicken at the end. At least one member of my family would have preferred not having the kernels of corn in the pasta - might serve that on the side.

I altered the recipe as I couldn't bear to puree the corn and corn was enough starch for me in one recipe. I prepared the bacon as directed, removing it with a slotted spoon and draining it on paper towels. I then added the corn till it was softer but still with a bit of texture. I added the parmesan, toasted pine nuts and basil cut into thin ribbons to the pan. Wow, that's a wonderful side dish unto itself.

All I can say is, "Oh My Gosh!" It was delicious. As soon as my August issue arrived this recipe stood out in my mind as being the most appealing. I made it this evening and it exceeded my expectations. It was very rich, flavorful and delicious. I used turkey bacon instead of regular to make it healthier. I haven't tried it the other way, but I can't imagine I sacrificed too much with this substitution. Not only was this recipe easy to make but it had far fewer ingredients than your typical BA recipe.
