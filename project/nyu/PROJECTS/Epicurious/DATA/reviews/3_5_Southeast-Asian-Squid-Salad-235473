I followed the recipe exactly (except halving for two) and it is wonderful. A great refreshing cool summer meal. It was light but we were NOT left hungry. Great flavor too -- reminiscent of pad thai with the chili, lime and peanuts. This is definitely going into the (summer) rotation.

This is actually better for a main course if you eat it over rice noodles, which is quite delicious. It's good for a summer meal or anytime you want something fresh tasting.

I think this might be better as a first course. My husband and I split the salad as a main course and were still hungry. We are not huge eaters either.

Very good---light and refreshing and easy to put together. I sliced the cucumbers and carrots very thin on a handheld mandoline. Leftovers were good, too, except the lettuce and mint wilted. Next time I'll add them at the last minute.
