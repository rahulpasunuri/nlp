This cake was delicious I also made slight changes.Replaced 1/2 the oil with applesauce. Used sugar in the raw instead of white. Didn't change icing I believed it was a perfect consistency. Definitely would make it again.

I was very disappointed with this cake. I did cut down on the sugars and oil by about 25%, however I found it very bland. I don't think upping those ingredients would have made a difference.

This is a delicious cake. Like others I made a few modifications to the recipe. For the cake: 1) Instead of 1 cup of vegetable oil I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of plain yogurt. 2) I cut down the sugar from 2 cups to 1 1/4 cups. 3) I omitted the pineapple. For the frosting: 1) I omitted the cinnamon. 2) I added a few tablespoons of finely grated coconut and a tablespoon of milk. Preparation: Once cooled I cut the cake in half horizontally and used just under half of the frosting in the center of the cake. I put the other half of the frosting on the top. I added a few sprinklings of finely chopped pecans and a little grated carrot to the top for decoration. I made this cake for my husbands birthday and we enjoyed it with friends. Everyone complimented the look and taste of the cake. I will definitely make this one again.

Wonderfully moist and tasty! I made this with the orange icing on another carrot cupcake recipe here, to keep it nondairy, and the orange flavor adds a nice touch to this. I garnished with candied carrot curls, and got a lot of compliments on both the taste and the look!

I didn't cut anything. It's a cake, not a health food! lol I had every intention of baking it just as written, but remembered I had a little piece of ginger in the fridge that needed to be used, so I added that. With or without the ginger, this would be a fabulous, dense cake. The icing was worrisome because it was so runny, so I (oh, no!!) added more powdered sugar. 8 oz. makes a lot of icing for a bundt cake. Next time, I'll use half, and keep the thin consistency. I'll be making this again.

Followed earlier advice about cutting sugars and oil. Also omitted pineapple and nuts -- increased bananas and carrots. Made as muffins and they were delicious - a hit with my four year old!!

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious. I followed these suggestions:omit pineapple, decrease oil to 1/2 cup, increase bananas to 3, increase carrots to two large and add 2 T milk to frosting for glaze. While I'm a healthier-the-better gourmet, my family is not. Yet they enjoyed this relatively healthy cake and yummy cinnamon frosting.

I have made this cake several times and it is a huge hit in our family. Just enough banana for a hint of flavor and the only modifications are slight reduction in the oil and sugars. The crean chees frosting is a must.

Very moist without being cloying. I made half the frosting recipe and thinned it with milk to drizzle on top. Delicious.

I wrote the review below and failed to mention I eliminated 1 c. of total sugar using 1/2 c. of both the white and brown sugar. Minor detail...

Ooops..I wrote the review below and failed to mention an important factor; I used only 1/2 c of both the brown and the white sugar!

I used orange mango applesauce and 3 T. oil in lieu of 1 c. of oil. No pineapple, 3 small bananas and 2 medium carrots. Produced 22 moist medium and flavorable muffins baked at 350 for 16 minutes. Everyone (including teens) thought muffins were sweet except my husband who loves everything sickening sweet. No frosting needed if you are going the muffin route.

I made this recipe as muffins (25 minutes at 350) and they turned out fabulous!! I used a cup of applesauce in place of oil, 1 cup of carrots (about 2 carrots) instead of 1.5, 3 bananas instead of 1, and left out the pineapple and pecans. I will definitely make this again the next time I have some overripe bananas at my house!!!

i tried this recipe with all the substitutions - applesauce instead of the oil, more bananas, more carrots, left out the pineapple, 1/3 of brown sugar - and it came out delicious! unbelievably moist and would definately try it again...next time, even less sugar than i had put because it was still way too sweet, even without the frosting. for some reason, eating a piece of the cake made me and guests really thirsty afterwards...not sure what it was...??

I've made this twice and have been amazed just how good it turned out each time. The second time I left out the pineapple (I really didn't care for the texture of the pineapple). I increased the carrot and banana by half a cup each and substituted 1cup of apple sauce for 1 cup of oil; it exceded my expectations by far. I have to say that I also left out the cinnamon in the frosting as being English we don't go a bundle on it (the cinnamon in the cake is just perfect though). I have also frozen the cake for a later date and that worked really well too. I have been enjoying constant compliments for this cake; I'm glad that I could let you into my secret!

I have made this several times - very easy and delicious. I always bake it in mini bundt pans, then make a double recipe of the frosting and cover with toasted pecans. They are a big hit.

I make this cake about 3 times a year - it's gorgeous and really tasty. I use walnuts instead of pecans and crush them up in a plastic bag with a rolling pin. I've also backed off the oil to 3/4 cup and it works fine.

Very good -- I made it for a get-together w/friends and everyone loved it. Next time, I will try replacing the oil w/applesauce as one of the other reviewers did. Also, the cinnamon cream cheese frosting was perfect on it -- just right to complement the cake. Yum!

This is one GREAT cake. It's easy to make and is incredibly moist. My co-workers absolutely swooned. I don't frost this cake because I think that would overwhelm it. I just dust with powdered sugar. Except for omitting the frosting, I follow the recipe exactly (well.... maybe I add a little extra banana if it's available,)and it ALWAYS turns out a winner. This one is a keeper. Try it....you won't be sorry!

Great carrot cake recipe, however, would remove the pineapple chunks. Although you couldn't really taste it, the chunk threw off the normal texture of carrot cake. Was very happy that it was a simple recipe to follow!

Excellent and suprisingly easy recipe. We replaced the 1 cup of oil with 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce and it worked great! Very moist! Also, it doesn't hurt the icing to use reduced-fat cream cheese.

Wow! This tasted great, but what a mess! I don't know much about cooking, so I tried something that I have mixed feelings about. I put the frosting into the bunt pan first, then put the batter over the top. I cut down on the sugar and oil. My husband can't have too much oil or he will get sick. Well, the cake tasted wonderful with the hot frosting (what didn't stick to the pan). I served the whole thing right from the oven and filled the bunt hold with vanilla ice cream. The ice cream melted and went all through the cake. YUM!

This was really good and easy to make. So moist..I added an extra 1/2 c. of banana. Did not make the frosting..this was good just plain.

Excellent, i personally hate ripe bananas, but this cake was a wow with everyone who had a slice and even i thought it was quite lovely. i added more bananas to the recipe and cut down on the oil just a little.

Great Cake, moist and flavorful. I agree with previous reviewer. Frosting is a bit heavy for the cake but good. Will make this again, maybe a bundtlettes with a pineapple glaze.

This cake was quite good. I omitted the frosting, and it was more like bread in bundt shape, a "snack cake". Very moist, used semi-drained pineapple (just used a fork to get it out of the can, some juice stayed behind). Great for kids!

I made them as muffins and they were fabulous! I'm into low-fat cooking, so I replaced half the oil with egg whites, which made the batter was light & fluffy. The pineapple is a great way to add moistness to a lower fat cake.

Cake turned out heavy. Was okay....but wouldn't make again. Not worth the time.

Great cake with interesting flavors--mainly a carrot cake, but the pineapple, banana and pecans add depth. I decreased the vegetable oil by 1/2 cup and added 1/2 c. applesauce as others suggested. I felt it could have used a bit more moisture--perhaps increasing oil by 2T. Also, I decreased amount of brown sugar by 1/4c. with great results. A wonderful frosting is the Orange Cream Cheese Frosting (10/99 issue). Also, I baked it in two 9" rounds (mine were perfectly done in 20 minutes). I will definitely make this one again.

This is a great, easy recipe for cake or muffins. It is moister than a banana bread but less carrotty than a carrot cake. We didn't like the cinnamon cream cheese frosting, though - it is much better with orange cream cheese frosting. The kitchen smells marvelous while it is baking!

I too made this as cupcakes (24; bake 25-30 min) and used the orange-cream-cheese frosting instead of the one in the recipe. I also used 2/3 c applesauce (actually peach mango sauce, come to think of it) and just 1/3 c oil in the cake. The batter tasted a little too sweet to me, so when I mashed the banana I mixed in the juice of one lemon, and that seemed to help. The final result was okay; moist, yes, but considerably more like a banana bread than a carrot cake. I might make these for a brunch, unfrosted, and call them muffins, but I will not make this again as a dessert. Still, they were decent.

This is a great cake. Very moist. I made this in 2-9 inch rounds, baked for about 40-45 minutes. I also used a different cream cheese frosting. I made it even more low fat but using 2/3 cp applesauce and 1/3 cp oil instead of 1 cup of oil. Do not squeeze the juice out of the pineapple.

My daughter made this delicious cake for a family gathering over the Easter weekend. EVERYONE loved it! In reading some of the comments regarding this cake, it appears as though some people found it to be dry. However, my daughter did not drain the pineapple and it was super-moist. Also, we thought the frosting, without the cinnamon, was very good (she did add more powdered sugar, however).

I love this cake. It is one of the staples in my recipe file. Since my family is weight conscious and we love our sweets, I use only one-third cup oil and substitute applesauce and/or plain yogurt for the other two-thirds. I often also use an egg substitute to further cut fat and calories. It always turns out rich and moist and keeps well.

I tried to bake this but it came out dry. What do you do to make it moist. When I drained the crushed pineapple I squeezed it to drain all the juice. Is that bad? Please advise. Thanks.

This is the best carrot cake I have ever tasted. I made it for a baby shower because the expectant mother is crazy about carrot cake. She loved it and took home every crumb of the leftovers "for the baby." All the weight-conscious women guests even raved about it and had seconds!
