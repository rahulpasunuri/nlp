I've made this cake 4 times now and it's been a big hit each time. My only suggestions: omit the lemon zest as it just creates a mildly gritty texture without adding anything significant by way of taste (if you really want extra lemony flavor, add an additional tablespoon of juice; I add 1 teaspoon a vanilla extract; take the cake out of the refrigerator about 45 minutes prior to serving.

Excellent!! It wasn't Girl Scout cookie time & we used Pepperidge Farm shortbread cookies & it turned out fantastic. This isn't great the next day though- the cookies (crust) get soggy, otherwise a total hit!

I found this to be a great base recipe. I would be comfortable omitting the citrus and adding chocolate, fruit coulis or other flavors. I added 2 lemons and 1 orange, zest and juice, as well as about 2 teaspoons of vanilla. It was definitely a little under baked but I will use this as my basic cheesecake recipe. I wasn't crazy about the crust, I would go with graham cracker or nilla wafer next time.

Cheesecake is not a dessert one finds in Holland often. I had not enjoyed a slice in a couple of years, and after seeing Nigella on BBC making a cheesecake I had a craving for this delicacy. I chose this recipe for a dinner I was having for my in-laws. The recipe was easy to make the night before and it turned out delish. I did have to tweek some of the amounts, as other cooks have stated. I used the juice of one whole large lemon, and also used the whole zest of that lemon. I baked in a convection oven, so the temp used was 170C/340F for 1 hour, I then turned the oven down to 140C/285F for 20 minutes longer. I used a raspberry coulis (recipe found on this site)thickened with a cornstarch slurry as the topping with fresh raspberries as garnish. The dessert was fantastic and a good success, as it pleased all the Dutchies at the table. The recipe is a definite keeper! I will definitely make it again.

Loved, loved, loved this recipe! Used Sandies cookies for the crust and although a little skeptical that such a soft dough would create a good crust, let me say it made a great crust! Crispy and delicious. I used the marscapone as directed and extra lemon as suggested. I thought I might have under baked it, but the top was browned so I crossed my fingers. After chilling, I ended up trimming off the browned top (fearing it would be tough) and made a delicious lemon curd which was not only beautiful, but added another layer of lemon flavor. Finished it off with rosettes of whipped cream around the edge and raspberries nestled in the "flowers". It was lovely and a major birthday party hit!

soooo good. I did up the lemon juice to two full lemon's worth and I used both lemons worth of zest as well. I used ricotta instead of mascarpone and I think it was a bit grainy because of it. the crust is fantastic and i doubled it to make 9X13 pan but i did not have to double the filling.

This cheesecake is phenomenal. I made it for a July 4th BBQ and it was a hit! Someone I didn't know actually came up and kissed me on the cheek in a fit of cheesecake-induced ecstasy. I used the large "brownie size" rectangle glass baking dish - doubled the crust but not the filling, which ended up being a perfect amount. Used pecan sandies as per a previous reviewer's suggestion (yum!) and the juice from 2 whole lemons. Somehow it took nearly 2 hours to bake. I got nervous, finally decided it was done when the top was an even shade of gold and I could poke it in the middle and encounter a little bit of resistance, while overall it still had some wiggle. It turned out perfectly - "fluffy", rich, lemony and delicious - but the crust stuck to the glass dish despite greasing it first.. so if you take the baking dish route, lining with foil and lifting it out is probably the way to go. Served with blackberry & blueberry coulis on the side. The kind of cheesecake that might change your life.

This is the best cheesecake I've ever made. I doubled the recipe since I was making it for a large group. For the crust I ended up adding more of the shortbread cookies since it looked too wet. I used a large rectangle casserole dish lined with foil then spread the shortbread and bake until nice and golden brown. Cooled it completely until the crust was hard and crunchy. I added a extra egg and more lemon zest in the batter. Baked a bit longer with a water bath under the next level below oven. There was no cracking, I cooled it and chilled in fridge for a day to set. The cheesecake lifted right out of the dish with no breakage or clean-up required. They were cut into perfect squares drizzled with raspberry coulis. Everyone raved about it, even said it was better than the cheesecake factory.

Wow, I have no idea what I did wrong, but this did not turn out well. I've made cheesecake before without a problem, but this took twice as long to cook, and the crust seem to melt and start convecting into the cheesecake batter. I made the shortbread from scratch, so maybe the butter content in the crust was too high? The cheesecake itself looked awfu-- all brown in the middle, and raw and cakey around the edge. I made a coulis and covered it up as best I could, hoping it would still taste okay, but the final product was pretty mediocre. Maybe I overmixed the batter? Maybe the batter sat out too long at room temp while the crust cooled? Maybe my springform pan didn't have a tight enough seal? I'm a pretty experienced cook, so I thought this recipe would be a walk in the park. Good luck with this, and hopefully yours works better than mine!

What a glorious recipe! I made this last night and took it to lunch at a friend's today. Everyone loved it. I used 3/4 cup graham crackers and 1/2 cup flour for the crust and baked it for 20 mins. I also doubled the lemon juice quantities and used 3 eggs as suggested by many reviewers. I used a little less sugar - maybe 1 cup or a little more. I baked for an hour at 350 with boiling water in a pan under the cheesecake. I then reduced the heat to 300 for the next 30 mins. I did have a little bit of cracking on the edge, but finally it didn't make a difference. I covered the middle of the cake with raspberry coulis and ringed the edge with whole raspberries. Delicious!

My first cheesecake ever, and it turned out beautifully! I also used ricotta instead of mascarpone, and I substituted graham cracker crumbs for the cookie crumbs, as well as adding more lemon juice and zest than was called for (I like citrus a lot). The result was rich and creamy and flavorful. Definitely recommended!

Very smooth, rich and easy. After chilled, I put on fresh halved strawberries with melted pomagrande jelly on the top and let set again. Also nice because the crust didn't turn rock hard.

This was a delicious cheesecake recipe. I did have to alter the crust so that the dry to wet ingredients were 2:1. Otherwise it was much too wet. It turned out very well with that change, though. The shortbread base was a perfect compliment to the fresh lemon taste of the cheesecake. I will absolutely make this again.

I maded this for Easter. Used three tablespoons of lemon rind and 1/3 cup lemon juice. Came out great. I don't think I would have liked it as is, as it was sweet enough even with all the extra lemon.

I made this for our Easter dessert and it was fabulous. Soft and creamy - just a lovely texture. I had some toasted coconut that I put over the top and also served some sweetened strawberries on the side. A real keeper, I will do this again and again. I did have to cook it about 15 mins longer than called for. And I used Lorna Doones instead of GS cookies (they never last long enough to cook with!)

I've made this at least 6 times. Each time I have had to bake it for at least an hour and a half and it still comes out runny in the center. I made it for a birthday party last night and this time I threw in an extra egg. Eureka. It still spent an hour and a half in the over but it set up very nicely and didn't collapse when I cut it. This will continue to be my go to recipe for cheese cake.

This was the best cheesecake I have ever had! I, too, add 1/2 cup lemon juice and the zest form 2 lomons. The top got very dark after just 1/2 hour in the oven so I covered it with foil. The top peeled a little when I took it off but it kept the top a nice golded brown.

Delicious. I probably used about a 1/3 cup of lemon juice but kept everything else as it was meant to be. I would make this again, however I would either use a different crust or cut the butter way down in this crust. The melting butter seeped out of the bottom of the pan-the smoky oven set of the smoke detectors! Learned my lesson to always wrap the bottom of the pan-no matter what.

This recipe was so easy to make and everyone raved over it. So creamy and rich, yet the lemon gives it such a bright and fresh taste. My only comment would be I wish it was just a tad less sweet. That's a personal preference, though. Personally I would probably just reduce the sugar in the crust a little bit for next time. P.S. I never have problems with cheesecakes cracking. - I just bake in a water bath as described above.

I served this at work to celebrate the end of a project-it was completely gone in about 10 minutes! I used blackberries for the coulis and ginger snaps for the crust. The coulis spilled over the sides while I was transporting it in the car, but it actually looked better that way. I had no trouble finding the marscapone at Trader Joe's and it was about $3. Alot of work overall, but so worth it. Everyone who tasted it raved about it. I make a lot of cheesecakes and they all agreed this was the best one yet. BTW, I never cook my cheesecakes in a water bath, and I have had no problems whatsoever.

This was a hit! One of the best cheesecakes I've ever had. The shortbread crust was a nice treat and the cheesecake was perfect. A great spring and summer dessert.

Rating: 3
Great flavor, but I think it's a bit much using butter AND shortbread for the crust. Shortbread is already very buttery, and I found that, after baking, the crust was somewhat oily from all that excess butter. Next time, I'll just press the crushed shortbread with no butter. Otherwise, it looks and tastes amazing, and it's almost too easy!

Rating: 3
Everyone at the party loved it. A few notes - I substituted "strained" cottage cheese (according to the Japanese label, not the lumpy kind) for the marscapone and whipped it with a hand mixer before adding; added 10 minutes to the cooking time to brown it a little more; and used full zest and juice of 2 lemons. The crust came out lightly browned from the first step, but ended up extremely crisp like a toffee in the end (was still delicious but hard to cut). The lemon flavor was strong but not overwhelming. We also drizzled some pureed frozen strawberries over it. Delicious!

This is a great, light tasting, elegant cheesecake. I did a ginger snap crust this time and loved it. I put in 4T of the lemon juice, and baked it in a water bath for 1 hour and 30 minutes. The pan was wrapped in tin foil to keep some of the water from seeping in. To the previous reviewer--the top will be lightly browned. Don't worry about the jiggle factor--it sets up in the frige. Definitely refrigerate overnight.

HELP!! I made this cheescake yesterday in anticipation of an Xmas Eve feast but the recipe did not work out like all of the reviews said. At the 1 hour mark the cake was still very liquid when it moved. So I left it in the oven in its bath. I continued to cook it for another hour, after repeated tries the cake was still very 'wiggly' in the center. The top browned so deeply that it looked gross. I took it out and it rested and spent the night in the refrig. I tasted it in the morning and it tastes very good however I now know that it has been overcooked. Please tell me when you know that the cake is finished. Describe how much wiggle will happen when it is ready to take out of the oven. I want to make another tonight because the cake tasted so good. But it was so overcooked and too ugly to serve that I threw it out.

I made this cheesecake to take to a party. Everyone loved it. The host even told me I would be forever asked to bake it for future parties! I had no difficulties with the recipe, although I did bake it about 10-12 additional minutes. I also made a raspberry sauce that some folks added to their slice. The 'umm' mantra was heard for quite some time!

At first, I was ready to throw the whole thing out the window--the cheesecake puffed up so much that the sides started breaking off! Good thing I had the water bath UNDER the cheesecake and that prevented the whole oven from going up in smoke. Next, it took over 1 1/2 hours to set -- the top was BURNED. It was awful...but having spent $ 11.00 on marscapone (cheaper at Trader Joe's by the way) I decided to salvage what I could. I peeled off the burnt top; when completely cool I spread homemade lemon curd on top and chilled overnight. I then drizzled the top with a raspberry sauce and put fresh raspberries on top. The end result? FABULOUS! I'm making it again today with hopefully a little less drama!

This cheesecake is truly magnificent. I am NOT a real baker; never make desserts. So I was pretty nervous about making a cake for my mother's bday party. This worked out very well with minimal fuss. Some adjustments I made: -Cooked for 1 hr 10 minutes -Used way more lemon: 1/2 cup lemon juice and 4+ tsp of zest. -Did the water bath but used like 6 layers of foil to wrap the pan before putting it in water (I had tested the pan earlier in the day and found it did leak, so was nervous). -used mix of lemon cookies and shortbread cookies for crust. As suggested by other reviews, I doubled the cookies but didn't increase the amts of the other crust ingredients. -For glaze I mixed lemon curd (bought in gourmet shop) and sour cream and a splash of vanilla and 1 tsp of sugar). Put it on for last 5 minutes or so of baking. -Topped the whole thing with pomegranate seeds, which looked gorgeous, added a little crunch, and was a perfect complement to the lemony flavour.

I've made lots of cheesecakes and this one is not very good. Per the reviews, I used the juice of three lemons and the zest of two, which together topped off a half cup measure. I was also careful not to overbake the crust, pulling it after 15 minutes when it had browned only lightly. I did use mascarpone, but I substituted neufchatel for the full fat creamcheese. I baked for only one hour (used a water bath) because the top of the cake was deep brown and the consistency was firm and solid when touched. I was a little surprised because my oven tends to be slow and others had to bake much longer, but I really hate to overbake cheesecakes. I refrigerated it for well over 24 hours before serving. I did spread lemon curd on the top of the cake and that turned out to be the only really good thing about it. The crust was too hard and difficult to cut. I definitely should have baked it longer because the filling just about held together and was still wettish in the middle. The flavor was only okay. Even with all the extra lemon juice and zest, and with 1/4 cup less sugar than called for, the taste was only vaguely lemony, basically rather bland. Cheesecakes are generally uncomplicated to make, and while this is a particularly easy recipe I'd rather spend my time on something with more flavor.

I've made this several times with great results every time. Next time I'll try the lemon curd on top--great idea. I like to serve this with fresh strawberries and strawberry-lemon sauce on the side (For sauce, mash up fresh strawberries, bring to boil, add lemon juice, lemon zest and sugar to taste). This is definitely company-worthy!

I just love to try new recipes, and this one is a real winner. I used 2 whole lemons (zest & juice), and the taste was just perfect. I would not change a thing in this recipe. Will definitely make it again!

Fabulous recipe! Remembering a dessert I'd had at the Snake River Grill in Jackson Hole, I used Meyer lemon (a lemon-tangerine hybrid) and doubled the amount of zest and juice. My other change was to use a large pan of hot water under the cheesecake rather than baking the cake in the water bath. It came out perfectly cooked and without a crack. I topped it with a Meyer lemon curd, and baked that briefly to set. This is a stunning dessert that is sure to impress!

Rich, creamy, unctuous: everything a cheesecake should be. The lemon helps cut the richness, and the mascarpone adds a creaminess that lightens it up a bit. I wouldn't bake the crust for as long as the recipe calls for: even 20 minutes seemed abit too long, as it became very browned indeed. Maybe it's my oven, but I'd suggest checking the crust a few times during cooking: as another recipe says, the pre-bake is just to give it a bit of a head start, not to cook it completely.

I've made many cheesecakes and this one is THE BEST! So easy to make and everybody raved! You really need to let it cool for the full 6 hours. In fact, we thought it was better the next day. I gagged when I saw the price of the mascarpone cheese, but I wouldn't make this recipe without it. Googled that cheese and found a website offering ways to make it and substitutions, but haven't tried them. This recipe is definitely a keeper for that potluck when I want to impress....

I indicated in my review that I wouldn't make this cheesecake again. However, I may give it a try. So many reviewers gave the recipe such glowing reviews, I can't help but think I did something wrong. The cheesecake tasted salty, not sweet.

May have to try it again to figure out if it was cooks' error or this recipe just isn't to my liking...

I love this cheesecake recipe. The filling is extremely creamy. I did take liberties with the rest when I made it last night. I used gingersnaps, 1/4 cup melted butter and a little brown sugar for the crust. I set my oven at 325 as it runs a bit hot. I baked the crust for 11 minutes so as not to dry it out. I followed the filling recipes exactly. To add a zing of lemon, I topped the cheesecake with a jar of good quality lemon curd before I refrigerated it overnight. It is PERFECT. I did have to bake it for 1 hour and 15 minutes with a triple layer of foil around the pan in a water bath. This is a keeper and will become a standard for me. The marscapone adds exactly the right flavor for this cake.

I love trying different cheesecake recipes but I always come back to this one when I want to "wow" folks. This recipe always gets rave reviews. I've made the crust with many different cookie types--Lorna Doones, pecan sandies, shortbread, butter cookies, windmill cookies--they all work well. You have to use the water bath to get a really creamy texture. If you're worried about the pan leaking, wrap the pan in a sheet of tinfoil. It's a good precaution. I'd hate to go to all the trouble and expense and windup with a waterlogged dessert.

This is the third time making this particular cheesecake. Never changed a thing in the recipe except the length of time it takes to cook it! The last time I used the convection oven and it still took long - 1 1/2 hours - to cook and it probably coud have baked another 15 minutes! Always served to rave reviews and requests for the recipe. No one can get over how smooth, light (yes, light) and delicious it tastes. Four forks for sure!!!

Nice texture. Served with blueberry compote on the side. To the reviewer with the smoking oven problem, next time try putting a large sheet pan on the rack below the one you are baking the cheesecake on (I line mine with foil for easy clean-up). This catches the drips of butter onto the bottom of the oven if your cheesecake ring doesn't fit tightly anymore.

I found this recipe to be just so-so. The cake had a crumbly almost dry texture which I didn't care for. I also more than doubled the lemon juice and while the flavor was nice it was pretty subtle. Finally I found the crust to have a greasy flavor and when baked was too hard. I was unable to use the water bath during baking due to the size of my oven.

My reason for typing is to suggest (after baking for over 25 years - with passion!) a simple solution to the need for more lemon: use 1-1/4 c sugar instead of 1-1/2 c. I'm sure that this cake would be fine this way. One could also use 1/2 lemon zest and 1/2 orange zest... ENJOY!

A great recipe - the cheesecake is very creamy and not too sweet. Like other reviewers, I used much more lemon juice than called for and still felt it could have used even more. In my opinion, the cheesecake tasted even better the day after it was baked! I didn't have time to make the crust, though, so I used a store-bought 9" graham cracker crust, which worked very well, except that there was enough filling to fill two pie shells. But this is definitely an easy ans elegant dessert for a party.

This is a fabulous cheesecake - especially the filling! I prefer to use a different crust recipe (I generally make a crust with organic vanilla or snaps, melted butter, and sugar). Mascarpone is hard to find- and expensive - where I live, so I often substitute yogurt. (I love the organic orange-passionfruit yogurt from wallaby farms - it adds a very subtle tang that's exquisite). That said, the recipe is also wonderful as is!

I made this for a holiday party with colleagues and it was well-received. I didn't find it light and airy, though, as many have described it. I agree with previous reviewers that more lemon is needed. I used 4 tbs juice and 1 tbs zest, and think I could've easily used more.

Hate to sound like a broken record, but it IS superb. My husband swears he's not a cheesecake fan and ate 3 pieces. Followed the invaluable advice of past posters and upped the cookie crumbs to 1 cup (left the other proportions the same, though), used 4 TBS lemon juice (could easily have used more) and baked for closer to 1 hour and 20-30 minutes. Made the mistake of placing a piece of foil on top for the last 15 minutes to retard browning and it took the whole top off when I removed the foil. Saved it by covering top with fresh strawberries and brushed on a little strawberry jam melted in the microwave. The cake and strawberries together were out of this world.

I made this cheesecake for my easter dinner and it was a huge hit. I doubled the crust and instead of shortbread crust I used lemon cookies. I added more lemon juice and zest then it called for,because you can never have too much lemon. Instead of mascarpone I used ricotta cheese and it was still nice and creamy. I didn't use the water bath because i was worried about water getting in. I also made a lemon sauce to put on top that have lemon juice, zest, sugar and a few drops of yellow food colouring and let it cook til it was thick and that added a nice touch.

I have made this cheesecake several times and it is FABULOUS. I served it with a lemon cream sauce. I whipped some whipping cream just until it starts to thicken.

I then spooned additional cream on top of the cheesecake. YUMMY! P.S.: To cut a cheesecake without any mess, dental tape works great (not the waxy type)

This cheesecake is very delicious! It is the kind that people go ga-ga over. The first time I made it, I was disappointed with the crust texture and flavor, so the next time I made the crust by using 1 1/2 cups of the Trefoil crumbs and 1/4 cup of melted unsalted butter, slightly cooled. Then I pressed it into bottom of pan and froze it for 2 hours. Then poured in the filling and baked it. I also had to increase lemon juice and zest to taste. I have found cheesecake pans work better than springform pans, i barely found out there was a difference.

UNBELIEVABLE! I made this cheesecake yesterday and it was outstanding. I took the advice of those who had reviewed it and doubled the amount of shortbread to 1 cup, added and additional 4T of lemon juice, as 2T would never have been enough. Additionallly, I had to bake it almost 2 hours. I started it in a conventional oven and baked it for the last 30 minutes in a convection oven with a piece of that new Reynolds Release foil on top to prevent it from becoming too brown. I served it with fresh whipped cream, although raspberry coulis would be great too. This cheesecake was absolutely a hit. And, I don't bake! Cooking I love, but baking is such a chore to me. In fact, my repitoire of desserts usually consists of Tart Tatin, because I really don't like to bake. I will make this again and again!

I made this recipe for a dinner party last night and it was a big hit! The lemon flavor is just right and the mascarpone really adds something to the texture. I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the shortbread to 1 cup and the crust was perfect. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Simply fabulous! The filling is so creamy and the taste is just right! Crust skimpy; suggest using crust recipe from another cheesecake. I'll definitely make it again!

Made the cheesecake for a dinner party this weekend. It was a hit. It was excellent! I used one cup of shortbread cookies and did not increase any of the other ingredients in the crust. I also increased the lemon juice to about 6 TB. I did not have a lemon zester so I barely got any lemon zest when I attmepted to use a grater. DO not leave out the marscapone. I bought it at Trader Joes for $3.69, the cream cheese was $2.19 so it was not much more of an expense...but well worth it!

A KNOCKOUT!! The easiest, creamiest & tastiest cheesecake I have baked yet. I did increase the cookies, and had to cook it about an extra half hour. I also increased the lemon zest and juice. It is parobably the most impressive dessert with the least amount of work involved. Making my second one today - just because its cold out!

Outstanding! I suggest you add the lemon juice and zest prior to adding the eggs. That way you can taste the batter and adjust the lemon to your liking. When you are satisfied, add the eggs. I used about 1 cup of shortbread cookie crumbs and about 1/2 cup of finely ground almonds in the crust.

I've made this cheesecake three times now - every time to rave reviews from my cheesecake audience. I've made it with and without the "notorious" marscapone cheese and, although expensive, I believe that the marscapone adds a richness & smoothness to the cake that makes it worth the expense. The crust recipe should definitely be doubled, but I'm having a hard time finding the perfect balance between butter & flour & cookie crumbs. You definitely do not need to double the butter, but if someone could reply with a more exact way to make enough of the crust, I'd really appreciate it. Enjoy!!

I followed the suggestions to add more lemon. I added 5 T. of fresh lemon juice, 2 tsp. of fresh lemon zest, and 1 tsp. of lemon oil (concentrate from the zest)--PERFECT. Plus I added 2 tablespoons of poppyseeds for color & crunch--GREAT! For the crust, I added more shortbread cookies to suck up the excess butter that people commented on--plus I like crust, but in this case too much crust disturbs the balance. Next time I will stick to the creator's intent and have just a thin layer of crust on the bottom because the crust is very sweet (the cookies are full of sugar PLUS you add even more sugar which [gasp] isn't really necessary). The cheesecake itself is the sweetest I've ever tasted (I've used at least 15 other recipes but the sugar in this one STANDS OUT for some odd reason) so crust up the pans sides is overkill (for the 5 people in my group). The cake itself has a truly wonderful, dense texture (not for those that like light & airy cheesecakes). I used the water bath with no problem.

Haven't made this yet, but I intend to make it for a Christmas party this year. To a previous reviewer: Sogginess can prevented by placing the sprinform pan on a large square of heavy duty foil before baking. Fold the foil up around the outside of the pan, making sure that it is completely covered. This will prevent water from seeping in and ruining your crust.

I am not a cheesecake eater as I usually find the texture to thick and heavy, but I made one as a special request and gave this one a try since it was my first cheesecake ever. WOW!!! I am sure is was the marscapone that made the difference because I have to keep eating it! I used some of the shortbread cookies that I had made by coincidence the night before. I also doubled the amount of lemon zest and juice as suggested here and found the flavour to be right on! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is by far the best cheese cake receipe ever. I've made this over and over and have gotten nothing but rave reviews. In fact, I am again making this for Thanksgiving. The only thing I do a little different is to use lemon curd for the toping. All my dinner guests love it.

This is now going to be my go-to recipe for cheesecake. It was outstanding. I took other reviewers advice and doubled the lemon zest and juice which worked out beautifully. I used the mascarpone which made it wonderfully rich. My change to the recipe was the use of gingersnap cookies. I ended up doubling the crust recipe by half which gave me the pan coverage I wanted. I also used my 11-cup food processer for the whole recipe. I recommend making this recipe at least a day before being served. I din't, and realized the left overs have gotten better and better each night since I made/served it. (P.S. I recommend sending your guests home with the remaining cake).

I made this cheesecake and got rave reviews. It was my first time using mascarpone cheese in a cheesecake recipe and I found it rather too rich and sweet. Also the crust was hard so that i had some difficulty cutting it nicely. It looked great though.

I was extremely pleased with this cheesecake recipe. It produced a wonderfully creamy cake and the addition of mascarpone truly made a difference. I used a graham cracker crust and it was still outstanding. The water bath method of baking this cheesecake resulted in a perfectly baked cake, but the edges of my cake and crust were soggy (a consequence of water leeching into the pan?). This was rectified after one night in the fridge.

Fabulous!! Thank you to the other reviewers who suggested doubling the lemon zest and lemon Juice. It was perfect. I did not bake it in the water bath and it turned out beautifully.

As often is the case, using the reader's suggestions made this a better recipe than following the recipe as written. I don't see the point of grinding up cookies as part of the crust. Any basic shortbread recipe creates the same impact. I too doubled the lemon and the zest. A very nice lemon flavor. I also glazed the top with 1/2c sour cream & 1/4c sugar mixture 10 minutes before the cake was done. If I would have followed the recommended 1 hour cooking time, I would have had a cake too soft to cut. 1 hr 20 min to 1 hr 30 min was closer to accurate. Overall, with modifications, this is an excellent summer cheesecake recipe, tasting much lighter than it actually is. The shortbread is a nice flavor combination with the lemon. Definately a keeper!

Wonderful! I'm not sure if it's Colorado but I did have to bake for 1 1/2 hours. Followed other's advise and doubled the lemon juice. The mascarpone cheese is a must.

DREAMY!! We made 5 different cheesecakes for an open house and this one was, by far, everyone's favorite. It was creamy, delicious, and beautiful. I highly recommend using the mascarpone, it does add a different dimension to the flavor. I used the juice and zest of 3 lemons for a fantastic lemon flavor. Excellent!

This was my first cheesecake venture and has definitely made me more confident to continue baking them. I made only a few modifications, the first being me using my own shortbread crust recipe, and the second was doubling the amount of fresh squeezed lemon juice than the recipe calls for. One co-worker thought there should have been even more added, but I loved it with double the juice. The cheesecake is wonderfully creamy and light, but at the same time, very rich and satisfying. I got rave reviews from my roommate and co-workers, and got asked for the recipe from everyone who tried it. Will definitely make again and again!

Delicious! I tried doubling the crust recipe, but it collapsed on itself while baking. I gathered up the crumbs and used them for a topping on the cake.

Haven't made this one yet, but thought I'd throw my two cents in. I've made many cheesecakes in my time (being a pastry chef by trade), and I must agree with the last reviewer-LEAVE IN THE MASCARPONE!!!! It's a bit expensive, but worth it. It's utterly delicious. You won't be disappointed.

why is everyone so chicken about using mascarpone cheese? gimme a break please!

I've made this several times, always to rave reviews. I always omit the mascarpone and add another block of cream cheese instead, so I've never had any problem with it being too fluffy and I like dense cheesecakes. I also always spoon sour cream, sweetened slightly with a little sugar and vanilla to taste, over the top of the cake in a thin layer for the last 10 minutes of cooking. When sliced, it adds another pretty layer and the flavors combine perfectly. Also makes for a beautiful smooth white top.

I read all the comments and took them into consideration. I used Walker's shortbread for the crust and doubled the amounts of everything regarding it except the butter. How much fat does any one person need? I doubled the lemon zest and juice as suggested as well. Marscarpone was $3.69 a package so I just added another cream cheese. The result was so creamy, so smooth. Simply divine. I made it Saturday for Sunday night so it set very well. I topped it with a shmear of strawberry fruit spread and fresh strawberries. Everyone was thrilled. A definite repeat!

I made this based on the reviews and have to agree with all of them! It was a very creamy and full of flavor. I also used sour cream (1/2 c.) instead of the marscapone and added vanilla. I made in the morning to serve in the evening but it wasn't completely set up by then. The next day it was much better so I suggest making it at least 12 hours in advance. Served it with sliced strawberries!

This was absolutely wonderful!! I served it with a raspberry coulis, which had a bit of Chambord liquer, which added a lovely balance of taste and color. Next time I make it, I'll make a bit more of the delicious crust, and have it come up the sides of the pan a bit. It was a great birthday party hit!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I used sour cream instead of the marscpone (4 oz) also I had a 7 inch spring form pan and had to cook it 1/2 hour longer. but the end result was wonderful. Everyone raved about it and I would definitely make it again and again.

After reading all the rave reviews, I just had to try it. I made this for Thanksgiving, and it turned out perfectly. I used Spanish almond cookies for the crust, and used 500 grams of cream cheese and a little tub of the Italian cheese. I also added a little vanilla for more flavor. This being my first cheesecake, I couldn´t believe how beautiful it looked and how delicious it tasted. I don´t think I´ll ever buy cheesecake again. With a little time, it´s so easy. This is a definite keeper. Happy Thanksgiving, America!

Wonderful for those who prefer creamy cheesecake! I added extra zest (about 1 T total) and used 4 oz cream cheese and 1/2 cup sour cream in place of the mascarpone. (I used Philadelphia cream cheese). I had grave doubts about the crust recipe when I realized how much butter was in it. But I only added 4 extra Lorna Doone cookies after increasing the recipe by half. After baking the crust was saturated and there was a little oil in the foil around the pan. Unbelievably, the crust came out crisp and was really outstanding. I decorated the cake with fresh raspberry coulis in a deep pool on top, fresh raspberries heaped over and a little coulis on them for color and shine, and a frosting of cream cheese, a little butter, sour cream and confectioner's sugar applied with a decorating tube in a continuing scroll around the edge of the cake. The cake was so evenly brown and neat-looking right out of the oven, though, that I was tempted to serve it completely plain. It was greatly appreciated. The lemony flavor of the cake, the buttery, crisp crust, the tart-sweet coulis, and the texture of the raspberries were right on.

Did anyone else notice that the cheesecake seemed to leak a lot of liquid as it baked? I wrapped aluminum foil around the springform pan and noticed that there was a pool of liquid when it had finished baking. I'm sure that it wasn't water from the water bath. I was afraid that the crust was going to be mushy, but it still was firm and rather crisp. I was suprised that the batter for the crust was very soft (somewhat between a cake and cookie batter). I refrigerated the cheesecake overnight and had no problem with it being runny. Not only was the cheesecake wonderfully creamy, but also attractive to look at: lightly brown on top and NO CRACKS. A real winner.

Thanks to all of you who included your changes and suggestions. I also increased the cookie crumbs and the lemon juice. Decorated the top with sliced strawberries. The result was heavenly!

After a little "doctoring" this cheesecake is fantastic. As suggested by previous reviewers, I made the crust thicker by 50% (used Lorna Doones), used 5-6 tablespoons of lemon juice and extra lemon zest and baked it a bit longer than the directions suggest. Served it with raspberry coulis (Gourmet-Feb 2001) and fresh raspberries. A "top ten" cheesecake...and I've tried them all.

this was delicious and very rich! but i didn't trust my springform pan to put in a roasting pan of water half way up this sides!!!! so i didn't and it came out fine? Why do that? someone please explain to me..thanks

Absolutely wonderful! It did seem like alot of cheese, but it was perfect. I cooked it 10 minutes longer than specified and it was still a little runny in the middle, but wonderful anyway. Topped it with lemon curd, then sliced strawberries and covered the sides with sliced almonds - stunning! Everyone raved about the cookie crust - will never make graham cracker again!

I have been on a cheesecake tear of late and this one was the simplest - but the best. Didn't have any marscapone on hand (very expensive) but substituted sour cream instead. The result was delicious, very light and creamy. Not for people who like "cakey" cheesecakes.

This was so delicious, I made 2 of them over the weekend (when I went home for my mom's birthday). However, I modified the recipe a little. No mascarpone cheese in rural towns, so added one more package of cream cheese for a total of 5 8-oz packages of cream cheese. Crushed one and a half packages of Keebler Shortbread cookies and slightly increased other crust ingredients to compensate for the additional crumbs, we like thick crusts. Also, increased fresh squeezed lemon juice to about 5 or 6 tablespoons and added 1 heaping tablespoon of vanilla. Baked in a 10-inch pan, at a little lower than 350 degrees, and a little longer. Unbelievable, smooth, creamy lemony taste with wonderful, thick(er) shortbread crust. Will make again, and again.

Help! I haven't made this yet (am going to this weekend). 2 lbs of cream cheese is 4 of the 8 oz packages? This along with a cup of Marscapone just seems like a lot for a 9 inch pan so I just wanted to make sure! Thanks.

This was a great recipe. I found it to be rather simple and quick as well. I made a few adjustments suggested by other readers, ie: used a cup of shortbread cookies, and extra lemon juice and zest. I also added a bit of zest in the crust. The shop I visit was out of Mascarpone cheese I ended up using 3 bricks of regular cream cheese and it still was terrific. I seldom give 4 forks, but this recipe topped with fresh raspberry coulis and cream was wonderful. Oh, and I froze it then thawed in the fridge the day I was serving it, and nobody would have know it didn't come out of the oven that day.

Excellent!!! I didn't know what to do with all the lemons my mother in law gave me, so I made this cheesecake with graham cracker crumbs b/c I didn't have the shortbread cookies and froze it for 1 1/2 months before serving it.

Scumptuously delicious and very light. We made this for New Years eve and it was a smash hit. I did have to use more cookies than what the recipe called for. (If you like dense cheese cake this is not for you.) Better than any bakery can do! Make it and your friends will all want the recipe.

THis is absolutely delicious. I added 3 tsps of rind and 3 Tbs juice because I like tangy. Right before serving I covered the top with a concentric pattern of sliced strawberries which I brushed every so lightly with melted currant jelly. IT IS SO DELICIOUS!!!!

While I prefer dense, thick cheesecakes, my husband loved this light fluffy creation. So, it's on his behalf that I'm giving this cheesecake a high rating. Question to other cooks: Did you find you needed to use more than 1/2 c. ground cookies? I did.

I made this cheesecake this week for a Christmas Eve dinner party, and it got wonderful reviews by all. No one believed it did not come from a bakery! Caution: It really does need a good long time in the refrigerator to cool and firm up. I only had it in the refrig for 3 hours, and slicing it was kinda messy. Enjoy!!

Worked well with low-fat cream cheese substituted for the regular cream cheese. The shortbread cookie crust was far tastier than crusts made with graham crackers. I was skeptical about baking it in the water bath, but it delivered superior results....evenly baked, excellent creamy texture. If you are worried about the water leaking into the pan, wrap the outside of the springform pan with aluminum foil.

Perfect use for too many cookies. Loved it and will make again and again
