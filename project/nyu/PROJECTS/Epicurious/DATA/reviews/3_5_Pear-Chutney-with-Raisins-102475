I added a tablespoon of Cyclone cider to the recipe in place of some of the regular apple cider vinegar. It gave the dish some heat and extra spice. I served it to 10 people at two different dinners. It was a huge hit and everyone asked me for the recipe. Thank you, Susan!

This recipe was rather bland and dull, I don't think I'll be making this one again.

I was sadly disappointed with this recipe. We found it bland and lacking any "zip," even though I added 1/8 tsp. red pepper flakes. Since we are heading into pear season, next time I will try the Roasted Pear Chutney also on this site.

Served it over grilled lamburgers for an easy, cheap and tasty dish.

A keeper; so simple to make and tastes delicious everytime. Our family and guests rave about it. I've served it mostly with pork and lamb dishes, but it would go equally well with others too. I've even substituted dates for raisins and have added chopped walnuts.

This chutney is just right--not too sweet. We serve it to guests whenever it is appropriate with our menu and always get favorable reports (even after an initial skepticism from those unfamiliar with chutneys.) This is a great find! It keeps well in the refrigerator so you can have a couple spoonsful each day all week.
