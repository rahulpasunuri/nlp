I made this with smoked bluefish, omitted the dill, and mixed in some drained and chopped water chestnuts, which added a nice crunch. This tastes great served on Nabisco Triscuts, or if you want to fancy up the dip presentation, it looks beautiful spooned onto individual endive leaves and served on a platter.

This is a wonderful smoked fish dip or spread. It's good with any heat smoked (as opposed to cured) fish and this time we used smoked marlin. I've been tempted to add some extra ingredients, but I haven't. I would only do that if using canned fish. It's great as is, if you have tasty smoked fish that you want to appreciate.

To the reviewer below: If you have a Whole Foods or Wild Oats near you, they'll have smoked trout.

where does everyone buy smoked trout? I've seen several recipes I want to try, but have no idea where I should be looking for it....

This is a great one and I've added my own twist with a bit of chopped scallion, some lemon zest and a squeeze of lemon... just seemed to give it a little kick. I also upped the quantity of horseradish some.

Loved it! Simple and delicious, just as it is. I do admit to being a dill fanatic, though, so this is right up my alley.

We use can trout and it works well.

Used some smoked bluefish and the tabasco and it was excellent. I agree - no dill.

Smoked salmon was on sale at the grocery store, so I used that instead of the trout. I thought it was nice, spring-like, very flavorful. Not superb, but nice, and different.

This was pretty good. I added some tabasco to give it a bit more zip. Not all that crazy about the dill.
