Delicious! Guests raved over the dessert. Even the ones who don't have a sweet tooth. Some modifications: I used less sugar than the recipe called for, omitted the confectioner's sugar on the cheese, used cranberries instead of prunes and cognac instead of calvados. I can't wait to make it again! YUM.

I made this dish for Christmas dessert a few years ago, and have kept it in my box because I still have fantasies about it. The decadent richness of the brandy and mascarpone balance the lightness of the fruit beautifully.

Wow. I don't agree at all with this dish being "light." The combination of the dried fruit and the mascarpone made this taste really rich and almost greasy. I love rich desserts, but this was a little too much for me.

I took one cooks advice and used the Apple Jack instead of the Calvados. I also left out the prunes. It was the perfect ending to our Christmas dinner and all the guests asked for the recipe. An elegant light end to a festive meal.

I changed the reciped to two apples and two pears so that each person got a half of each if there were four people. I found that the sauce was great with the mascarpone; i couldn't stop munching on it. The dish was very easy to make and tasty.

This was fabulous. Easy to make, too. I used cognac instead of calvados. The marscapone topping was elegant and unusual. all my guests raved. I will make again and again - a perfect autumn dessert.

simple to make and a delicious difference from the pie/cake type of dessert

So simple. So delicious. Excellent 'lighter' ending to a big meal, or even a quick fix mid-week.

Laird's Apple Jack is a much less expensive alternative to Calvados and nearly equals the flavor
