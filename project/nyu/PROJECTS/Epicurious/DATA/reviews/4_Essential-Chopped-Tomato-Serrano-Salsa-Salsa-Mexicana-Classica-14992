Best salsa around. Hard to find serrano chiles at times. I take this salsa to parties and people rave about it. Time consuming slicing the the tomatos but it is worth it. Do not put the ingedients in a food processor. It will ruin the intended texture of the salsa.

Did not use garlic. Used about 2 oz minced fresh shallot in place of onion. Used 2 fresh serrano chilis, left the seeds in one and seeded the other. Used 12 oz of Campari tomatoes (it is off season here) Rave reviews; they emptied the bowl.

Excellent, this is a keeper. I used about 1 1/2 large jalapeno minced in place of serrano.

Simple and amazing. I had never made salsa before and was skeptical about the flavors - it seemed too simple. But after making it twice it is a keeper. It's exactly what fresh salsa should be. Used canned jalapenos and had no cilantro - but delicious anyway.

I've never made my own Salsa before. It's so easy to buy it at Whole Foods or elsewhere, but thought I'd try this after I bought some very ripe, sweet local tomatoes. This was easy to make, colorful, incredibly flavorful and delicious. If you can get heirloom, organic tomatoes from a local farmer's market, they will transform this dish.That's what I used and this Salsa was just yummy.

made with one jalapeno without seeds and it was still pretty warm. hope it'll integrate better after sitting overnight. added a little salt just on principle.

I made this salsa for a casual pre- dinner appetizer on a weeknight with my husband, and we ended up eating the entire bowl!! It is amazing. Having spent a good amount of time in Mexico, we fancy ourselves salsa "connoisseurs," and this was exactly what we miss when we aren't sipping margaritas on the beach south of the border. YUM.

My 4-year-old son and I just made this together, and it's great. I stayed cautious for my young tasters and used just 2 serranos, seeded. My 2-year-old can't get enough!

Very watery, but excellent flavor. I used three jalapenos and doubled the tomatoes. I also seasoned with black pepper.

Can't get fresher salsa than this. Change the lime juice to olive oil, the cilantro for basil, omit the jalapenos and you'd have a great bruschetta topping.

Very tasty and easy. I could have happily just eaten this with a spoon. I used one jalapeno instead of the serrano and the salsa had no heat at all - will use 2 jalapenos and keep the seeds next time.

Yum yum! Adding a pinch of ground cumin and some diced black olives is a nice touch too...

This salsa tastes incredibly fresh! I usually make it with jalapenos instead b/c serranos aren't available at my store, but still delicious! I recommend cutting down the amount of onion, though. I usually use half a small onion, which is plenty.

I used this recipe as a rough guide, varying the amounts of each ingredient to suit my taste. I used fewer of the chiles, for example, and the salsa was plenty hot. My family and I really liked this salsa. It was fresh and easy to make. Plus, it had a lot of flavor and zip. I would make this again.

This simple salsa is identical to that served in a Leti's Seafood near Ajijic. It is best (and less watery) served within seconds of bein cut and mixed.

Great recipe, but needed just a little extra flavor. I added cracked pepper for taste, and won't skip the salt as I did the first time! Salting the tomatoes and letting them drain reduces the watery- ness, especially on day 2.

I absolutely love this salsa. Very simple and easy to prepare. Letting the salsa sit for about 30 mins or so before serving really helps the flavor. When serving this to people who don't like cilantro, I use Italian parsley instead, and it still tastes great. About making the salsa less watery: removing the seeds and only using the fleshy parts of the tomatoes really helps. Plum tomatoes are less watery than round ones too. Also, after the salsa sits for several hours, it will get more watery.

Flavor is beyond compare, so fresh. Can anyone tell me how to make it less watery, though?

We really like this salsa, Serrano is too hot for us so I used pickled Jalapenos. We like it chopped finer than hand chopped so I used a hand blender and chopped it up so the liquid would be thicker, it stays on the chips better. We have this with our breakfast quiche. Dipping with tortilla chips.Yummy!

Just like I used to get in the little Mexican restaurants in Chicago! I can't easily get mexican peppers, so I used the tiny red or green thai ones. I've also sometimes substituted red onion or even shallots for the white onion. It still turns out beautifully!

Just a tip: Err on the side of caution with the chiles. I added 3 serranos - seeded - as the recipe suggested. When I tasted a spoonful, it nearly took the top of my head off. Yow! Maybe my chiles were unusually large, or unusually hot, but my advice is to start with one and add slowly. I'll try again...

I used extra lime juice and a jalapeno as well. It is fresh and delicious with the right amount of heat. I will make this all summer.

This is the most incredible salsa. The first time I was in Mexico I ate something that tasted just like this and I keep going back to find it again. This is perfect as is. I wouldn't process it because I love the fresh tomato chunks. It tastes like summer.

Yum yum yum..I don't like tomatoes raw and I loved this! I made it as suggested but I added a small clove garlic *finely* chopped and added a lot of onion too because I love onion. I also added half a jalepeno and 2 serrano chiles with the seeds and all. It was the perfect amount of hotness. Also added a little extra lime juice. Very good!

This is a great and easy recipe! I made it with Roma tomatoes instead of the plum but will try again with plum to taste the difference. And I used half a clove of garlic but would omit altogether. Had garlic breath for two days! I also used 4 chiles and thought it was a perfect amount. Put everything in the food processor, set on chop and had a great consistency. Would recommend if you want an easy, fresh salsa.

This is the BEST salsa recipe I've come across (as well as one of the easier ones). I personally use 3 serranos chiles. It can get spicy pretty quickly. This recipe doesn't need the garlic, but if I used garlic in it, I'd make sure it was a SMALL clove, or else only use half of it. I didn't think the garlic really added much to the salsa (and I am a garlic fanatic). I've only had positive reviews about this salsa from guests (and I've made it more than 20 times) :D Tastes good on quesadillas as well! **Be sure to prepare it ahead of time (at least 30 minutes) and refrigerate so the flavors have time to mix.

Rating: 3
This was great. I used 5 serreno chiles but next time I will use only 3, it was a little too hot even for me. I food processed half of it to make it a little less chunky. You have to let it sit for at least 1 hour to let the flavors blend.

Is Vancouver THE salsa capital of the world or are we just amazed at how simple and good it can be?? Try this recipe just once! Use a sweet onion if you can - it's much less harsh. I usually add some chopped garlic. Also, Serrano peppers are great and still tend to have the "kick" that you just don't find in Jalapeno's anymore. For those not used to the heat, use with caution.

I am so addicted to this salsa. I definitely like the tomato seeds in there and let it sit for at least 2-3 hours so that the flavours can meld together. Interesting appearance if you add different colored tomatoes like yellow or orange too.

I ended up adding avacado in attempt to lessen the raw onion, which was overpowering the other ingredients (had no more tomato on hand). I also increased the lime juice to give it more brightness and roasted the garlic as suggested--a nice modification. Don't be hesitant to make a lot. It goes quickly, and any leftovers should be great in a sandwich the next day...

Good, basic salsa recipe. I used a red onion, threw in the garlic and lots of lime and cilantro. Use the food processor and the salsa is made in no time, just be careful to use the pulse feature and not overprocess. Everyone loved it and now I have to make some more...

Too much onion. Yeecch! Next time, I'm going to reduce the onion to 1/2 and increase the serranos to eight. It has potential...

Picante means spicy. We used this recipe as a skeletal outline for our salsa, adding the spice of a yellow habenero pepper to it as well. We also add more garlic but soften the taste by roasting some of it in the oven.

This is our salsa recipe. We like the garlic in it, and we leave the tomato seeds in our salsa. It is delicious! What does "picante" mean? It is not in the epicourios dictionary. I wish there was a place to communicate things like this to epicurious. If they use words like this they should put them in their dictionary. I love Epicurious, but if we could communicate directly, I would ask them to please keep their screen narrow enough so one doesn't have to keep moving it back and forth to read the sentences. Do others have this problem?

I have mixed feelings on this salsa. It was quite good in that it tasted very fresh and had some great flavors - cilantro, lime, etc. On the other hand, it didn't have much taste initially though and it became very soupy quickly. All in all, it's not a great salsa. Ripe tomatoes are a must!

This was a great salsa recipe. Quite easy to make. In response to the cook who asked about canning, yes, I would imagine it can be canned. I would add some vinegar or lemon juice to raise the acidity. And I would omit the cilantro from the recipe before canning. Add the chopped fresh cilantro moments before serving, as the herb doesn't retain its flavor well through the canning process.

This is nice...I would call it Pico de Gallo. I like to add some finely diced avocado ( 1/2 to one whole avocado) to enhance the taste. It is good with meats, chips, and delicious as a condiment for almost anything. Plus, it is colorful and makes a nice presentation on any table.
