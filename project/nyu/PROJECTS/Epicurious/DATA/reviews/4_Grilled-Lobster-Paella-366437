Made a vegetarian version of this and it was great! I substituted Field Roast sausage for the Chorizo (and cooked it separately to keep the texture), adding just one to the early stage for added flavor and used a vegetarian broth. I also added garlic tops (with the peas), onions and garlic (at the start) for added flavor. Loved it, will definitely make again.

This was incredible. Hunt down smoked paprika (we used hot) - it really made the dish!

This recipe is delicious. Of course, a few changes-just 2 of us, so we used 3 small split lobster tails and 6 shrimp. Cut the recipe in half, and couldn't find short grained rice (even Whole Foods didn't have any). Substituted a long grain. Used leeks, and added 2 minced garlic cloves. Can't wait to make this for our grown kids.

Subbed a seafood medley, shrimp, scallops, mussels, & calimari for the lobster. Good stuff. Will fine tune, until get the crusty bottom.
