Not great, too bland. Will not make again

Great recipe. I left my garlic minced, not pasted and added a little almond extract for flavor and taste.

I really like the almond sauce. This is good for making a basic sauteed chicken breast and making a sauce from what's left on the pan.

One of the worst chicken recipes I've ever tried. Will not be making it again.

A hit at our table! I doubled the sauce as suggested and dipped the chix in egg and bread crumbs before browning.

After I started to cook this dish tonight, I realized I had no almonds, so I used pecans, which worked surprisingly well - I made double the sauce, with only a tad bit of butter, and used about 3:1 wine to water and no parsley. I recommend pecans if you think that it's bland with almonds. It went well with brussels sprouts and white beans (in which I used a grating of Romano: check out that recipe if you are not much of a brussels sprouts fan - or if you are).

Definite winner -- I did double the sauce, as I'd rather have too much than be wanting more. Agree that the amount of almonds could be reduced if you prefer, but I simply mixed some sauce and almonds in with my rice side and it was fabulous. Used slivered almonds vs sliced, gave it a nice solid crunch.

Yes, good idea to make more sauce. I used a Liebfraumilch which worked out great. My husband loved it but wanted more "stuff" in it like red bell pepper and onion which I will try next time. I put it over a brown rice medley from Trader Joe's. Great!

This was good, but not great. Have made many better quick chicken dishes.

I have made this twice already, once for my husband and once for dinner guests. Everyone loved it. I loved the sauce but I also agree that you need to double the recipe, even for just two servings. I also thought that the amount of almonds was large so I cut it by about a third. It was fine.

My husband loved this one. I thought it was above average, but he scarfed it down and raved. I only had slivered almonds, so I used those, but it was a bit too crunchy. Will definitely use the sliced as recommended next time. Didn't double the sauce as others recommended and ended up regretting it. Wished there was more sauce when I served this dish. Overall, a quick and good weeknight meal.

I made this for new parents who were so grateful to have a wonderful meal. As suggested below, I pounded the breasts thin and dipped in egg and seasoned bread crumbs before sauteing in butter. Doubled the sauce, added more butter and cooked it after adding to make it creamier. I put too much lemon juice in the first time, so be careful. Served with Trader Joe's wild and arborio rice with dried cranberries mixed in while cooking. Mixed fresh berries for dessert. My son and husband, friends and I highly recommend!

I served this to my chilhood sweet heart having found her after forty-five years. She was impressed. I was impressed. I doubled the sauce, added small mushrooms & scallions (sauteed) & brown butter. this is a keeper. Chef Alan Kingston Ontario Canada

Quick, easy, elegant, and flavorful. I pounded the (skinless)chicken breast thin and coated it in Italian breadcrumbs (I would HIGHLY recommend doing this.. it made a difference appearance and taste wise). Also, I would double the sauce.. just not enough after it was reduced down. I served it with Green Beans with Balsamic-Shallot Butter and Wild Rice Stuffing with Hazelnuts and Dried Cranberries (all from Epicurious).. made for a memoriable meal.. mmmmm...

Made this for a small dinner party recently. I served on the side fresh green beans tossed with lemon and parsly. It made a beautiful presentation for company - very colorful and elegant.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe! It was very easy to prepare and the wine, garlic and almonds gave it such a wonderful taste. Only thing I didn't like was the chicken just didn't look appealing. Next time I'll maybe dip it in eggs and flour first to give it a little color. I also used seasoning salt on the chicken for more flavor.

I have made this a couple of times. I use regular butter too. The first time I made this, I used the fresh parsley. But, now I just use the regular parsley. I love this recipe'. It is one of my favorite ones.

This is a great quick recipe. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and pounded them before browning. It went well with a white/wild rice mixture with herbs that I got at Trader Joe's. It's important to boil down the sauce to enhance the flavor, and the butter really adds fullness. It would be a good fast company dish that makes a nice presentation.

The dish overall is very light and the sauce accompanied with a side dish of wild rice gives it a full flavor. It was not to die for, but I would definately make it again considering the ease of preparation.

I was very disappointed when I made this recipe. I thought that it was bland and tasteless. I would not make it again.

This was pretty good, but I didn't find it outstanding. It is quick and easy to make, using ingredients I tend to have on hand.

Good but I'm not crazy over it. Would make it again; makes a very presentable dish.

12/22/99 Excellent flavor and easy to make. I used boned chicken thighs because I don't like white meat. You can dress up thighs to look as good as breasts.

I served this for a small dinner party. I also used chicken on-the-bone. It was a very big hit with everyone. Even an individual who preferes dark meat liked it very much because the meat remained tender and moist. I followed several tips from previous ratings and I consider draining off most, but not all the fat before making the sauce a must! For appetizers, we served steamed artichokes followed by an egg drop soup. Use some extra chopped parsely to garnish some whipped garlic potatoes, then Pour the sauce over some steamed miniature carrots and you have a beautiful presentation. A Chardonnay fits well with this dish and can be used in the sauce as well.

The flavors the sauce makes w/ the almonds, wine, butter and parsley is fabulous! I squeezed in the sauce at the end lime. I also used chicken breasts on the bone rather than boneless and it was very tender! (I also drained the extra oil after browning the almonds.)

I made this for my boyfriend and he just loved it. He gave me an "A" on this one. He said it was casual yet elegant. I'll definitely make this again for him and other people.

I thought this recipe was wonderful! I actually forgot to bring the printed copy home, but remembered all the ingredients. It is such a flexible combination of wonderful flavors that it still came out great. I used the wild and white rices combined as a side dish and it worked perfectly soaking up the wonderful sauce. I think it would make a nice entree for a dinner party as well. My only recommendation would be to flatten/tenderize the breasts before browning.

Delicious combination of crispy almonds, mild chicken and poignent wine sauce. We served this with a blend of white and wild rice and steamed asparagus. Only change I'd make, is reduce the fat by draining oil from pan and perhaps not using butter next time.
