I made this for New Year 2011 gather party, I like this recipe. It's like the beginning of special things to come. It's delicious, very colorful, spicy, sweet & tangy, who could ask for more????

Fish sauce is supposed to be salty, its like a fishy soy sauce. Certain brands have a less salty taste.I think there are enough other ingredients to provide a nice flavor. I will definitely try this and provide a more thorough review.

This was far too salty. The salt from the fish sauce fully overpowered any other flavor. 2.5 tbs of fish sauce has nearly 1,000mg of sodium. I learned this too late and after the recipe. yuk..
