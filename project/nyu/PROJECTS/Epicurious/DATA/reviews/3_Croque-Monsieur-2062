Actually, James Beard was the one who introduced mustard to the croque monsieur. Classic CMs have a bechamel sauce. Me, I like to toast both pieces of bread slightly with a dab of butter in the oven before removing one slice and adding the ham and cheese to broil a bit. Once the cheese is golden and bubbly, pull the slice out and top with the other piece of bread. For the person looking for variations, I like to add a slice of tomato to mine. A croque madam has a fried egg on top.

I make them all the time. I was just checking out the recipe to see if there were any interesting twists added on to the traditional recipe. But it doesn't need it-- Gruyere is splendid and paired with ham it is divine. (I couldn't believe someone remarked that it's just a "fancy name for a ham and cheese sandwich." It's actually the FRENCH name for a ham and cheese sandwich-- they don't speak english in France.)

I love Croque-Monsieurs, ever since a food day in French class, I've been dying to make some. It's a little bit different than the one we had in class (that recipe was my favorite), but it's been the closest one I can find. I've never even heard of a Croque-Monsieur with mustard before...it sounds un-french-like to me.

I'm going to make this dish for a school project, again. I've made it before...very easy, of course.

I loved it! It's a very simple recipe, quick and easy to make, but it's very good. I would definitely make it again.
