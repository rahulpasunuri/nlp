This is an incredibly delicious and comforting dish. It is the homier cousin of sweet potato pie but can be dressed up with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. As prepared, the cobbler feeds closer to 15 people making it a great addition to a buffet or family dinner. I prefer my cobbler to be a bit more moist, so I reduce my syrup slightly less than called for in the recipe (closer to 2 1/2 cups).
