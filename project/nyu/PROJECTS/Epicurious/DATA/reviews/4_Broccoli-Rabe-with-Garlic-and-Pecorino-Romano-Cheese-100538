This is excellent. I only used 5 tablespoons of pecorino Romano cheese and added red pepper flakes. So good!

I made this and kept the leftovers for a cold pasta salad the next day with the addition of sundried tomatoes it's delicious. Simple and easy to make. I don't bother blanching the rabe though, takes too much time/too many more pots to clean. I simply cook it with the olive oil and garlic and add a dash of crushed red pepper flakes and its amazing.

I made this dish to accompany a Tagatelli with Beef Ragu. The bitter greens are a great contrast to the richness of a meat sause, and the garlic made it perfect. Just try and be sure of your audience when you make this, smaller children or picky eaters might find broccoli rabe too bitter.

I made recipe as stated but used asiago instead of the romano cheese. I also added a little more cheese (about another 4 tbsp as it cuts the bitterness of the broccoli rabe). My teenage boys ate it, and my vegetable hating DH loved it. I thought it was great.

I happen to love broccoli rabe as a side dish as an accompaniment to any dish but for those of you who don't really like the taste, try it cooked as the recipe states but add some pasta to it and some sauce and some sausages, mix it all together and it's sooo yummy. You will love the way the broccoli rabe tastes this way. I boiled the broccoli rabe in salt water til wilted, meanwhile in a fry pan I heated up some olive oil and sliced garlic and then added the broccoli rabe and sauteed for a few mins. Add the pasta, sauce and sausages afterwards and u will have a great Italian meal u will love.

My boyfriend doesn't really care for vegetables so I wanted to try and find a recipe that would give a little more flavor. My grocery store didn't have broccoli rabe so i substituted french green beens and it was excellent! What a difference it makes sauteing in a little bit of garlic and then topping it with fresh romano cheese! He ate all of them! I'm sort of a beginner when it comes to cooking and this was a great, easy, tasty recipe that can be used for any vegetables!

Good recipe. Easy to make but it needs a kick try adding crushed red pepper. Also, for a Brocoli Rabe with more tecture and taste, skip the blanching and simply wash the Rabe in water and add it straight to the hot olive oil (be careful it will splatter, use a lid to steam it) but really adds depth to the flavor.

I didn't think this recipe was anything special. Even with romano I bought in Rome I was disappointed. It was good, but I won't make it again.

Excellent and easy! I peel the base of each stalk an "x" at the end of each stalk, I find this helps with the bitterness when blanching. So good!

Very good! I made it exactly per the recipe and it was a hit. I didn't use exactly 2lbs of Broccoli Rabe, a little less, but it was fine... used a little less Pecorino in the end.

I am not a big fan of rapini, but my husaband loves it, so I make it for him. I tried adding the balsamic vinegar as suggested by another reviewer, and it was delicious! Just what I needed to take a bit of the bitterness away. Thanks for the hint!

I love rapini - this dish is quick, basic and delicious. I prepare it with almost no oil and add some chicken stock to distribute the garlic and it is great.

This is a great basic preparation for broccoli rabe that allows for a lot of embellishment possibilities. For those who don't like the bitterness of broccoli rabe, a sprinkling of balsamic vinegar will help. But I'm a fan of adding a few shreds of lemon zest and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes for an undertone of flavor that really punches up the bite of the rabe. This is great tossed with egg noodles or orchiette.

Since I'm not a big fan of broccoli rabe to begin with, I must say, this was not that bad. However, it was not good enough for me to make again. Unlike other broccoli rabe recipes, this was not that bitter, which was a plus for me. I will keep searching........

This was very good....it was my first time cooking rapini...iv already made it again! and iv found a new good veggie that will now become a usual at the table...i took this one step further and served it as a hearty one bowl meal..by adding lots of wild mushrooms..shallots..a few cloves of unpleed garlic (about7)in addition to the peeld..which i up to 4 cloves..some white wine...and some penne rigate...(the first time i used angel hair..i like the penne better)...anyway i sauteed the garlic and shallots...added the mushrooms..some red pepper flakes 2tsp white wine3/4cup...some chicken broth 8oz..a dash or two of balsamic...ummmm ummm it was good...and i had a fruity chardonnay to cut through the slight heat of the pepper flakes.For cheese I also added 3/4 of smoked mozzerella....I hope people will try this..it's good comfort food..even my kids ate this!

This was my first time cooking raab and it was great. My husband doesn't like to much garlic, so I cut back to 2 good size cloves and it was still quite tasty.

This is a great accompaniment to many things-roast salmon, lamb tenderloins. It also makes a great pasta dish when tossed with a few black olives and fettucini. I like to saute lemon slices with the garlic then add the rabe raw to the pan, toss until wilted then add a little water and cover to steam (one less step this way). squeeze a little lemon and add a few red pepper flakes-fantastic!

I'm a beginning cook and only had regular broccoli but decided to try it. Cut off the stocks so I had just the florettes but realized too late that I should have cut so almost no stock was remaining because the stocks just weren't cooking. So I added some water to the bottom of the pan I was using to steam the stocks. Turned out great and still crisp! I love recipes that I can mess up and still recover.

Excellent !

I used this recipe with broccoli florets, can't get rabe here. This is now a staple vegetable dish for us and for company, really a nice change from our other broccoli dishes. I sometimes use fresh grated parmesan or asiago cheese, it's good with all of them. The broccoli stays firm unlike some recipes where it gets mushy. Highly recommended.

This was so delicious. I served it over fresh cavatelli pasta and it tasted almost exactly like a dish I love at Bella Notte, one of my favorite Chicago Italian restaurants. It removes all the bitterness from the rapini.

Previous to making this dish (I made it solely for my husband), I've never cared for broccoli rabe. I always thought it was too bitter. After making this I decided to be a good sport and try a little, well I loved it! The garlic and romano cheese added such nice mellowing flavor. Definitely a "repeater."

To this already excellent recipe, I added 2 teaspoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes and a generous tablespoon of lightly toasted pinoli nuts. I made one pound of the broccoli rabe, and if I made the entire amount, I'd double my additions. This was a fine vegetable side dish.

I saw this recipe on TV today but did not have any broccoli rabe, so I used spinach instead. My two ten-yr-olds absolutely went crazy over it. I will definitely use this with broccoli and broccoli rabe ( if I can find any of it ). The flavor was FANTASTIC.

I have made this many times before finding this recipe. I wanted to compare what I did with the "official recipe". Surprise! It is the same. I don't like to clean pots so I simply steam 1 Lb rapini in the skillet, covered, until my desired tenderness. I add enough water so that the water is gone when the tenderness is achieved. Remove the rapini and continue the recipe. I guess if I were using two lbs I might do the steaming separately. (Added bonus - If there is liquid left in pot or skillet - it gets poured into a glass, cooled and consumed for many vitamins.)

First time i've tried broccoli rabe, and i definitely would make it again. I'd cut back on the garlic, thinking that 5 cloves sounded like too much.. next time i'd use all 5!

This was my first time at trying Rapini and we were delighed with results of this recipe. We will add this vegetable to our diet and savor the taste of the rapini and garlic again in the near future.

Some things are so simple they can't be improved, and this is one of them. However, for a quick, one dish supper, I vary this by adding a few slices of diced prosciutto, a can of great northern beans, toasted pine nuts and tossing it all over whole wheat spagetti.

Try the following for a complete side dish: cook 2-3 Idaho potatoes for 20-30 minutes until soft. Drain and add to the pan with the garlic and olve oil and broccoli rabe. Cook, stirring and mashing the potatoes as you go. For a complete supper, you could add chunks of cooked Italian sausage, too.

This side dish was very easy and quick to prepare. It was a wonderful change from the ordinary. The grated cheese cuts down the bitterness of the vegetable and enhanced the flavor of the dish. My husband loved it and I will definitely make it again.

A great recipe, fast and easy, with a savory taste. If Broccoli Rabe is unavailable, it works equally well with Kale. If the amount of garlic seems too heavy for some, substitute shallots. I also add 4 reconstituted sun-dried tomatoes; great color and added taste. Also good with Chicken.
