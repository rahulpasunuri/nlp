I found this just plain silly.. it was a waste of time even trying it. Ambrosia is called "ambrosia" because it is perfect just as it is; why fool around with a bunch of silly trendy add-ons when you've already got perfection? zero in my book.

My guests liked it; I wasn't wild about it. Love Scott Peacock, though! I'm lucky to live a mile from Watershed!

I have to say that this beautiful recipe brought me joy and delight. It was a challenge to make because of the sectioning of the oranges and cracking a coconut, but the reward was tenfold for the teduious tasks! I served it as a palate cleanser between dinner and dessert. My guests loved it and wanted to know where I got the recipe. Thank you Mr. Peacock, it was a pleasure!
