This is good, easy and quick. I did it on the spur of the moment and my wife and kids really liked it, as did I. I didn't have white wine vinegar so I substituted white wine and balsamic bianco, no shallots so onion, no fresh tarragon so dried, no dijon so a couple of other mustards we had. For fish I used pangasius. I'll do this again.

Probably wouldn't make this one again. At the end of the day, not much flavor here.

Too much Dijon. Both the fish and the salad tasted sharp. My husband liked it well enough but I did not at all.

This was very tasty and best of all - easy! Perfect mid-week dish. I used whole fish fillets, rather than cubes on skewers. Made the amount of marinade listed for 4 which was enough to marinate the fillets with some left. Didn't toss the dressing through the salad, instead put the fillets on the leaves and drizzled over remaining dressing. Will make marinade again in the future as a salad dressing alone - yum.

I made this with monkfish. I pan-grilled it (BBQ is too much for 5 minutes of cooking, and broiler on the fritz), but otherwise followed the recipe. I added a little olive oil to the pan, and after turning the pieces, spooned over some of the marinade and finished cooking. Delicious and easy, and perfect for a worknight.

My family is an eclectic bunch: an old southern cook; a Julia Child devotee; a budding Asian chef (teenager); and me a try-anything-but follow-the-recipe-exactly cook. We all thought this was a keeper. We used fresh summer tomatoes, seeded but not grilled on top of the greens. Used wooden skewers and broiled the fish in the oven. (It was pouring down rain and I'm scared of the grill anyway...).

This was excellent and really easy to make. I used wooden skewers, but soaked them first.
