Anyone know how long the Goat Cheese Phyllo Blossoms will keep if made ahead? Or would these freeze at all?

one of our favorite recipes. I have done it exactly as written but also have substituted spiced nuts for the lardons, when keeping it vegetarian (or just for a change of pace). My daughter's favorite thing!

Modification: Don't have the time/inclination to make "goat cheese phyllo blossoms"? Just crumble your goat cheese onto the salad itself. This is SUCH a great way to prepare dandelion greens. Tips: a) tossing the greens with the oil/dressing about 30-40 minutes before serving softens them to just the perfect crunch; b) toss the whole thing with honey to taste is an added layer of awesome.

I just made the Phyllo blossoms but used blue cheese instead. they were delicious and beautiful. I got so many compliments even when they were on a table filled with other great appetizers.

Very impressive presentation and very tasty. Even so, very simple to assemble. Made the blossoms ahead and reheated to serve. Perfect

These were amazing. Dandelion greens are out of season so we substituted baby greens. Still very delicious, but the lardons overpowered the delicate greens a bit. Will not add them next unless using the dandelion greens. Very good, and held up as leftovers for two days.

I substituted cow's milk feta for the goat cheese (my mom can't stand goat's cheese) and I used a nice cabernet vinegar for the dressing (I had a hard time finding sherry vinegar). It all worked perfectly. The dressing really mellows out the greens and ties everything together beautifully. Excellent dish.

The cheese mixture in the phyllo blossoms seamed to separate slightly. Did I cook it too long? Delicious anyway, as was whole menu.

Made this for Easter dinner. Used Frisee as the work suggested in prepping dandelion greens did not appeal to this mom of 3 under 6yrs! The blossoms are yummy and even reheated well the next day.

This is a lovely recipe! I was afraid the dandelion greens would be too bitter and leave a lingering after-taste, but the dressing is the perfect counterpoint and "antidote" to those flavors. And the little goat cheese blossoms are easy, pretty and tasty. My guests loved it. Highly recommended.
