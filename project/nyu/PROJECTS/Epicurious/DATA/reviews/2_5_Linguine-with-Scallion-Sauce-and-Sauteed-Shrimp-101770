Whoops. Didn't read the other reviews. This dish needs work. Yes, double garlic (at least), also add some splashes of white whine and even chicken stock. Better use ultra fresh shrimp too. Didn't see any point in leaving some shrimp out to serve on top. Just mix it all in.

I had already bought all the ingredients for this recipe by the time I read the other reviews. So, I went ahead and made the following changes: I added more garlic to the sauce, and we grilled the shrimp (which we'd marinated in olive oil and garlic). We both ended up liking this a lot, and I now would make it again.

We love green onions but this was aweful. We just don't have anything good to say. Even though it was simple, pasta tossed in butter and cheese is better.

Thanks to the previous reviews I was prepared to "kick it up". I used about 5 garlic cloves, the juice of 1/2 lemon, and lots of fresh ground pepper. It was a pleasant meal, light and tasty but not one to make memories. I'll probably use it again for the short, easy ingredient list - easy to remember.

Although the dish didn't taste bad...it didn't really have much flavour at all. I even used atleast double the garlic called for. Idea is good but lacked flavour.

My husband made this for my 50th birthday. The recipe is definitely a keeper. There is a fair amount of steps to follow but the end product is worth it. Needs a little bit of salt or as the reviewer said, maybe doubling the garlic would do the trick.

Relatively easy to make...however we would double up on the garlic, 4 cloves instead of 2, as the sauce was very delicate, not exactly bland, but we were surprised that it didn't have a stronger flavor. Next time we might try a squeeze of lemon.
