From the reviews I was expecting more. Made with a mix of lime and Meyer lemon juice, marinaded chicken for 6 hours. Good but not great.

Perfect for grilling. Served chicken with Meximerican kind of fare - perfect match. Loved the way it almost glazed the chicken upon grilling. Can't wait to serve it again.

Great basic marinade to elaborate on. I would use a VERY mild olive oil or even vegetable oil. EVOO will make it bitter and burn on the grill.

Really?!? I am surprised people like this so much. I marinated chicken for a few hours, and threw them on the bbq for the first bbq of spring. BIG disappointment! Way too sweet. Even my kids - who love anything off the bbq - didn't like it. Yucks. Delete!

We followed the directions exactly and then marinated shrimp and wild sockeye salmon .We thought it was really good .

This marinade was EXCELLENT!! Users that said it wasn't good obviously didn't follow instructions. My husband and I loved the flavor of the chicken so much, he asked me to make it again! I cut the chicken into chunks and marinaded it for about 4 hours.

Great recipe loved by the whole family. We didn't have a lemon for lemon zest, so we used about 2 tsp of wasabi. It really brought out the citrus flavor. Definitely going to use again

I had really high hopes for this recipe but was dissappointed. It did not impart the flavor on the chicken as I thought it would when I read the other reviews.

I love this recipe! and is easy to tweek to your liking. I added lime, as well as a mix of chili powder, cumin and cinnamon. Fantastic! This is our favorite marinade for grilling chicken.

This marinade was SOO good. My boyfriend doesn't speak much English but just kept saying "incredible" over and over! I actually didn't follow the instructions and put all the ingredients in a food processor and then warmed it on the stove for a bit. Afterwards, due to time constraints, I only marinated our chicken breasts breifly before throwing in the oven for about 15 minutes. Next time I might use only 2 Tablespoons of sugar (by the way I used regualar white sugar because we don't have brown sugar here), and actually follow the preparation instructions, but in general absolutely excellent!

I modified this a bit by leaving out the sugar and using champagne vinegar in place of the balsamic. Marinated shrimp for about 30 minutes then removed them and boiled the marinade until it was reduced by half. Used that as a basting and finishing sauce, simply incredible.

I used this marinade with skinless, boneless chicken thighs which I grilled on low for a slow cook. They were great.

Yum! Light and refreshing. We made it with the lime and marinated chicken for 24 hours. My fiancee thought it was a little too sweet, but I thought it was perfect! Really easy too!

Used the o.j. version to marinate skinless, boneless chicken breasts before grilling. Served them over a salad of mesclun with walnut-balsamic dressing, scattered with fresh raspberries, toasted pecans, and crumbled stilton. Topped with the chipotle-raspberry sauce from this site. Superb.

This was a great marinade for chicken. I marinated skin-on chicken breasts for 8 hours, put them on the grill and basted with leftover marinade. We ooh'd and aah'd over it all evening. I don't understand the reviewers who didn't think it had enough flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

This was a 4th of July hit! I used the lemon-lime version with shrimp and the lemon-orange version with chicken. It's light but still tasty.

Utterly wonderful. I experiment around with the citrus proportions and it never fails! To Kathy who gave it 2 forks because she made it for beef: the recipe SAYS for chicken and shrimp. That's like blasting a recipe for hollandaise sauce because you put it on oatmeal.

Loved it! So refreshing and different from some of the heavier marinade/glazes for grilled food.

Used this on beef kebabs for 34. Rave reviews from everyone! Will definitely make again.

This marinade recipe is a wonderful jumping off point to get creative. I used the juice from one "honey" orange, one lime and one lemon and 3 crushed garlic cloves. I also cut the zest from the lemon and diced it rather than grating it. Marinated boneless skinless chicken breasts overnight then grilled. I then boiled down the remaining marinade and strained it, pressing on the solids, to use as a sauce for the chicken. It was delicious and a great marinade for the warm weather. I will make this all summer with chicken, fish and even vegetables.

I'm a vegetarian, but I marinaded chicken breasts in this for the better part of a day. I baked the breasts and served them with some manderine oranges. My wife really loved the taste.

I love this marinade! I have made it several times and find swordfish to be the best with it. I also like using lime instead of orange for more kick. You don't have to follow the recipe too closely, just throw it all together and you can't miss!

I made shrimp kabobs on the grill first for a party in NH, then for a party in NYC and I haven't heard the end of the compliments. I emailed the recipe out to everyone!

This is a very good marinade. I used it on ahi tuna and it was wonderful. I did not remove the garlic slices and used maple sryup instead of brown sugar. I served it with chili-mango salsa.

I made this recipe for my husband and daughter and they flipped. I added a little fresh rosemary and that gave it just the right lift. The sauce thickens beautifully as it cooks. The entire marinade only takes a few minutes to make. It's such an easy recipe. I'm making it again tonight.

I have used this recipe on pork roast, bbq ribs, chicken and fish. Have always received rave reviews! Used it on the Thanksgiving turkey and it was so moist! I use fresh, minced garlic and leave it in. I also use orange and lime juice and some lime zest also. I am going to use it on my Christmas pork roast and add rosemary to the recipe.

After reading another reviewer's warning (and because we were using orange juice and don't like things too sweet) we changed the recipe slightly by cutting the sugar in half. We then marinated the chicken overnight and grilled it. It was superb! The citrus and mustard flavors went perfectly with the smoke of the barbeque, and the chicken was wonderfully moist. We're adding it to our recipe file.

If you can, marinate your chicken for 24 hours. Everyone loved it, and I ran out!

This is a great marinade -- I used it on grilled chicken breasts and got rave reviews. More than one guest told me that they didn't know grilled chicken could be so moist and delicious. This one's definitely a keeper.

Had a big barbecue this weekend and EVREYBODY RAVED about the kebabs (used chicken and pork). Looked good, tasted even better. Marinated overnight. Quadrupled recipe easily, but not everything disolved by stirring, so an airtight container and a good shake did the trick!

I thought this was very disappointing, however it was beef I tried it on and maybe that made the big difference. Didn't care for the sweetness. I may try again on poultry.

TO THOSE WHO DIDN'T LIKE THIS RECIPE, TRY USING GRATED ORANGE PEEL INSTEAD OF LEMON. OR YOU COULD USE 1 1/2 TEASPOONS OF EACH. MARINADES ARE TO ADD A SUBLTE FLAVOR AND HELP MOISTURIZE. THANKS CARLA, MY CLIENTS WERE DELIGHTED WITH THIS RECIPE WHICH I USED ON CHICKEN AND PORK. I ALSO USED MY SUGGESTIONS ABOVE.

After reading all the rave reviews about this recipe, I was quite disappointed. The recipe was just so-so. I marinated chicken breasts for almost 4 hours but the flavor was nothing special. It did keep the meat very moist.

I marinated shrimp for 2 hours before grilling on the BBQ. I also think it needed a little more zing but had a fresh fruity flavor. My fiance loved it. Next time I'll try it with chicken and maybe a little more mustard.

O.K., maybe it's just me. I thought this recipe was average. I will say that it kept the chicken quite moist and tender. However, something was missing from the flavor. I would suggest you let the chicken marinate for at least two hours to get the most out of the flavor.

When I was in a hurry, I used to use a store-purchased citrus marinade mix that was delicious, but I became concerned about the very high sodium content in the mix so I stopped buying it. When I saw this recipe, it seemed similar as far as calling for orange juice so I decided to try it. What a hit! It was absolutely delicious with the chicken breasts I roasted in the oven. I'm sure it would be great on a grill. Next time, I'm going to try it with grilled jumbo prawns.

I used this marinade for boneless chicken breast and marinated them over night, then grilled them. They had such flavor and came out very moist.
