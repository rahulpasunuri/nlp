Made this last night with the recommended potato and kale salad. I thought it was easy but not that tasty. I think it would be more flavorful if the meat were marinated in the madeira mixture for several hours (perhaps with a crushed garlic clove or two) before being coated. I used the rack, as suggested, which was a good idea. I cooked it (one 1 1/3 lb tenderloin) for 30 minutes at 425, and most of the meat was still too pink for my taste.

Excellent. Took others recommendation and used a rack for complete crunchy crust. Served it with slowly sauteed mix of endive, apples and grapes. Recipe from Dori Greenspan. Good pairing. One guest wanted his pork well cooked, and 145 degrees takes it to only medium and pink.

This is a great alternative to the usual recipes of pork tenderloin with a fruit sauce or sweet glaze. The key is the smoky flavor of the pimenton. Regular paprika doesn't provide the same depth of flavor. I followed the recipe closely, but like another reviewer, found the cooking time slightly understated.

This recipe was really good and easy. I also used a rack on a baking sheet in order to keep the bottom crunchy. The almonds gave it that extra texture that bread crumbs can't. It was hard to tell if the pork was done and it was a bit soft so I added 5 more minutes, 20 total and it was perfect. I also didn't have Madeira or cooking sherry so I choose dry red wine mixed with whiskey. Because you use so little and just coke the pork, it didn't seem to make a big difference anyways. I also put the rosemary in the food processor, I never would have been able to chop it fine enough.

I thought this was a really delicious recipe and my kids and my husband all loved it. It was also pretty quick and simple to make

Made with both fresh and dried rosemary. Fresh is better but dried works too. Usually make with one tenderloin and halve the rubs.

Fabulous recipe! Loved it with the recommended Kale and Potato salad.

Delicious recipe - will definitely make it again. Couldn't find madeira, so used sherry instead. Cooking time is longer than indicated - closer to 40 minutes than 20, but still need to check and tent @ around 15-20 minutes.

This is not quite as easy as it looks, but worth the trouble. I brined the loins, but I should have cut back on the salt in the recipe. But, utterly delicious with this one little tweak

Came home late from work, had one, half frozen tenderloin, and not much else. Dinner on the table in less than an hour. Burned the first batch of almonds, used sherry instead of madeira, pimenton de la vera (smoked sweet paprika), rosemary from the garden and served it with a tossed green salad, and quinoa with green peas. Lovely flavour, very different than the usual hoisin or mustard, would definitely do it again.

I have made this two or three time, following the recipe exactly as written. It has been a great success every time. I figure it's a hit when all my guests want the recipe. The combined textures of the meat and the crunchy coating are very satisfying, and the flavors are new and different. I served it with the Wilted Kale and Roasted-Potato Winter Salad, also available on this site. The combination is perfect.

Great mix of flavors. Relatively easy preparation. I'm a big believer in the sear and roast method for any roast and made adaptations accordingly: Didn't bother with pre-cooking the garlic and kept panko/almond mixture separate until last. Let meat sit with seasoning mixture (plus a healthy pinch of kosher salt...which is really needed here) for 15min at room temp before searing, coating in crumbs/almonds, and roasting to internal temp of 140. Left-over crumbs make a nice pre-serving sprinkle for slices of the pork.

Very, very good -- exceeded exceptions! Only change was I used boneless pork chops, rubbed madeira, paprika mixture on chops and let sit about 45 minutes. No other changes to recipe -- wonderful flavor, moist pork chops. Baked in 425 oven for 15 minutes. Served with BA Creamy polenta and steamed broccoli. Definitely a keeper -- quick and easy for week night meal, but also worthy of company.

My family loves this recipe. I use a little extra pimenton and marinate the meat in the "rub" for half-hour or so. It is easy to make and delicious.

I bought one 1.4 lb tenderloin and also had to cook it longer, but I suppose that's to be expected given the size. When I cooked the tenderloin I used a trick from Cook's Illustrated: line your pan with foil, then place a baking rack on top of the foil and spray the rack with Pam. Place the pork on the rack. This helps the bottom crust to maintain its texture a bit better. Tasty recipe; I don't think I'd make any alterations. Just out of curiosity, has everyone used pimenton picante rather than dulce?

Four forks, easily. I ended up using dry sherry in the place of Madeira, and it worked just fine. The extra breading may be used to sprinkle over smashed potatoes, etc. Highly recommended.

Well, I don't know why everyone else had so many issues with this recipe. I followed it and it came out perfect. I did use tenderloins that were only 3/4-lb each and after 20 minutes of roasting they were actually even a little bit overcooked, so next time I might even reduce the cooking time a bit. I can't imagine why other readers needed to cook their meat for so long. I suspect they weren't using tenderloins but some other cut of loin entirely (especially the reader with the 2-lb tenderloin - no such thing unless you have gargantuan pigs where you live!). I also marinated the meat in the spice/oil rub for a couple of hours before completing the remainder of the recipe. I thought the amount of rosemary in the recipe was perfect, and my crumbs didn't come out soggy, either! In all, a very easy and delicious recipe for pork tenderloins.

The crust added a nice texture and helped the loin retain it's moistness. However, the cooking time was a little short...we ended up roasting for 35 minutes. Fresh rosemary would be a nice addition.

The combination of flavors was a little odd to me even though i like all of the ingredients. The crust was soggy and the meat took a lot longer to cook than the recipe says, so my timing was messed up with my other dishes. Might be worth tinkering with, maybe adding a sauce.

Very easy and quite tasty. I had 2 small 1-lb tenderloins and they cooked up beautifully. The combination of rosemary and paprika was intriguing and the coating was definitely NOT simple bread crumbs, as one reviewer thought. Definitely toast the almonds, use panko and use good smoked paprika. It DOES make a difference. Served it with a simple spinach salad and was very pleased.

The ingredients sounded good---but the tastes weren't there. To me it was as if there was a simple breadcrumb coating. There are much better recipes out there for your tenderloin.

Just like promised in the description, this is a great combination of sassy crunch on the outside and moist, tender meat. I see no reason to change or add any ingredients, unless you're a little rosemary-phobic (not me!). It does take a little longer to cook than 20 minutes.

Good but cut down on (or cut out, for kids) rosemary. Added a shake of allspice and two of coriander. Took much longer than 20 min -- more like 35-45. Putting crumbs on the bottom of the meat that is lying in the pan just makes a soggy mess -- top and sides is enough. Had much more crumb mixture than needed. Could cut down almonds a bit as well, for 2 lb of meat.

Superb recipe. For those interested in a sauce, try creating a sauce in the pan you make the pork in. Over medium heat add 1/2 cup of beef broth to 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar (or red wine would work), reduce by 1/3, whisk in 2 tablespoons of butter for added sheen at the end.

i was really excited about this recipe. the flavors and ingredients sounded interesting to me, and putting it together and cooking it made my kitchen smell divine! however, i used a 2.2 lb pork tenderloin and it took over an hour to reach the desired temperature. in the end, it was juicy enough, but nothing spectacular and all the flavor was on the crust, not in the meat. I did make this with the kale salad recommended at the bottom, and agree that it goes excellent together! i may make this again, but i would definitely use the right weight in meat

This recipe was great. Followed it exactly. The crust is very good. I just wish there was some type of sauce to go with it.

I made this recipe just as written and it was a huge success with my guests. In fact, I made twice as much as I needed and microwaved the left-over tenderloin two nights later, and it was still delicious. The smoked paprika gives it an unfamiliar and exotic taste which my guests raved about. They had never tasted anything like it. The flavors are strong, so I recommend mild-flavored accompaniments.

I have prepared this meal twice since I received my magazine in the mail. Delicious and easy. I wouldn't change a thing either. I prepared the side dish recommended in the magazine - potato and kale dish which was an excellent companion.

Sooooo delicious - but definitely too much rosemary unless you love rosemary above all else. We recommend half as much rosemary, twice as much garlic and a little more smoked paprika. Fabulous, moist, yum.
