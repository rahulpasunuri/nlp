Used the "from scratch" recipe listed in the reviews with whole wheat instead of all purpose flour, and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Everyone loved it

I'm not a big fan of buying baking mixes. Here's an equivalent if you want to make this from scratch. One box of mix = ¾ cup cornmeal; ¾ cup all purpose flour; 2 tablespoons sugar; 1 tablespoon baking powder; ½ teaspoon salt

I know that many "real" southerners will probably be opposed to this recipe but it is delicious whether it is authentic cornbread or not. It was fantastic with a spicy chili. It was so moist and delicious. The addition of broccoli seemed strange but is amazing.

I took this to a get together over the weekend and it was quickly completely gone! My husband said he had about four pieces himself! It was dense and rich and delicious. I added more broccoli to make it 2 cups, why not? I'll be making this again!

Great recipe - added some diced jalapeno for a little kick. People keep asking "Is this really cornbread?" A hit at any BBQ!

Served this last night at a family party with chili and fruit salad and it was a hit. The only modification I made was to reduce the salt to 1/2 tablespoon (and was glad I did). The skillet filled right to the brim. It all browned up with a beautiful crunchy crust and a creamy moist inside. It's definitely rich so a little goes a long way--I fed 11 people from one skillet (some taking seconds) and have some left over.

Yum. Very dense and rich. A big hit with a bunch of adults. I served it with my go-to recipe, the Turkey Chili with White Beans.

My 89 year old Dad who is a cornbread purist just loved it.
