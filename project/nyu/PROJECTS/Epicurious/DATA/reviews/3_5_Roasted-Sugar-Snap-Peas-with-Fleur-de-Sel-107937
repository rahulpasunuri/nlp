Oh my, this is the only way I'll make snap peas from now on! So tasty and so easy. I used whatever sea salt I have for our S & P grinders. Mmmmm.

I loved these! Simple, crisp, delish. I used gray sea salt. I ate the leftovers as a midnight snack and they were just as good cold.

Wow! These peas are rock stars! I used lemon pepper/salt and I'm thrilled.

In the midst of dinner party craziness, I definitely appreciated how easy and quick this recipe was. I enjoyed the peas, but my guests didn't find them exceptional -- maybe I didn't have the most tender peas to begin with. That said, though, I especially enjoyed the brightness of the fleur du sel against the roasted sweetness of the peas. Try it, you might like it.

What a great,easy way to cook snap peas. Steaming is not always accurate and there is little I like less than over cooked snap peas. Did not use the chives as I didn't have any. Can't imagine the peas could taste better.

We really enjoyed this method of preparing the sugar snap peas. They were crisp and delicious. I'll definitely prepare the snap peas again this way.

I ended up throwing out the entire portion I had made. I thought it was terrible. I'll just go back to steaming them to preserve the clean, crisp taste I enjoy about snap peas.

Delicious! I loved the carmelization on the peas. I used pink Hawaiian sea salt instead of fleur de sel. It was fast and tasty. Even got a veggie hater to eat his peas!

For years I've been boiling the sugar snap peas for 2 minutes. This method is much better. They don't overcook as easily and they are also great with toasted sesame oil for an Asian twist. Mmmm.

Fabulous recipe, and so simple to prepare. Another great one to keep for those days when you have to throw something together quickly. I agree with the comment about the chives not adding any noticable contribution to the flavor, so why bother? The snap peas are wonderful on their own.

Nice presentation...good flavor. Wonderful to have a really fast veggie that can be done at the last minute. Didn't find that the chives gave much flavor...perhaps more are needed.
