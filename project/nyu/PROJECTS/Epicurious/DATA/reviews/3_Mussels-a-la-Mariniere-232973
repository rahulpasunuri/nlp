This is outstanding! The sauce is that wonderful, classic mussel sauce. So simple, yet so good! It is very easy to make, especially if you have all of the ingredients ready. Total cooking time is less than 15 minutes. With prep, just 30 minutes. The hardest part is reading the recipe, which is written in a charming, old fashioned style. I used 2 shallots (who knows how much 2/3 oz is?), and it was just right. YUM!!!

It was very delicious -- but Gourmet did a very poor job of explaining the recipe. Very confusing list of ingredients and amounts (in fact lemon juice is not mentioned in the ingredients but is mentioned in the text of the procedure). Also the procedure was backwards with cooking the actual mussels as a footnote at the end. But don't be put off -- it's easy and delicious. I'm going to rewrite the recipe and keep it!
