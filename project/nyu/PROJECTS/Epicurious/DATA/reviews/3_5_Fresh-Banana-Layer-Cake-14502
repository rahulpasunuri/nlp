Rich and yummy yet light enough to have a piece the next day. I used vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk and it worked fine. Put sliced bananas in water with lemon juice and patted dry before layering with icing between layers. Still turned darkish by the next day - maybe more lemon juice next time. Agree with other reviewer about the taste being better, and cake moister, the next day. I'll sacrifice slightly dark bananas for the moist cake next time. Loved the icing.

Very yummmy. It basically tasted like banana bread with a sweet, but not too sweet, frosting. The combination of the cake with the frosting was very good, and I am NOT a frosting person at all, but I really, really liked this. I always scrape all the frosting off of cake before I eat it, but I thought this frosting was delicious with the banana cake.

These were delicious! I followed other reviews and used two sticks of (salted) butter instead of one, and kosher salt. I used about 1/3 cup of buttermilk since my bananas were just shy of 1 cup. I doubled the vanilla, added 1 tablespoon of amber rum (St. James). I also added 1/2 tsp of "speculaas" spice - a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, mace, coriander, and cardamom, and had 1 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup light brown sugar. I baked them as cupcakes for 15 minutes, and we ate them unfrosted. They had a perfect texture and were just sweet enough with a lovely, nuanced flavor. My husband brought most of the cupcakes to work where they were devoured and the recipe requested. I will definitely make them again!

Delicious cake! I used 2 9" cake pans instead of 3 8" and it worked out great, I just ended up having to cook the cakes about 5 extra minutes. The combo of banana in the ultra moist cake and fresh banana in the layer was fantastic. One note...the frosting was a little too sweet for my taste..I think next time I will use half the sugar and up the cream cheese. But, consistency and quantity wise was perfect. Other than that a definite keeper!

3 8" layers? No way. I used 2 9" (and couldn't even find 8" pans in the stores...) and it was still kind of "flat". The cake was denser than I would have liked but everyone loved it...especially the frosting and the handful of chocolate chips I through into the batter. What can be better than banana and chocolate together?

This was a pretty dry cake and the layers are not very tall. I was not using the frosting, but using the cake for another project and was very disappoionted in it.

Add about a cup and half of chopped dark chocolate to the batter! And brush the layers with amareto, add a shot to the icing as well, and WOW! I also add toasted slivered almonds to the finished cake. Wow! Must try!!! You will be addicted.

I agree that the cake layers are thin but if you make it as suggested with banana slices in between it works beautifully and tastes great! I have also made it as a bundt cake and muffins. Can't go wrong.

I made only the cake part of this recipe for a layer cake I was making for a birthday so I can't speak for the frosting part of it. I wanted a four layer cake with two chocolate layers and two banana layers and this worked perfectly! The taste and texture was excellent and it makes nice firm layers. I used seedless raspberry jam and chocolate ganache for the filling and served it with sliced strawberries and whipped cream.

This isn't the best recipe, the premise is nice, but the presentation is awful. I made the cakes in two 8" pans with 1/2 c. extra banana in them. They were perfect. I made the frosting and have NEVER, NEVER worked with anything worse. It was sticky and gooey and runny and just horrible, yet surprisingly yummy which makes me feel bad. I started frosting the cake and it was getting everywhere. It made too much, and with its runny-ness, the bananas and chopped walnuts I put on the inside of the cake started slopping about. This has to be stiffened up somehow to a more buttercream consistency to make sure that the banana layer stays intact. The idea of not frosting the sides sounds great, but even then I would be cautious of the middle layer falling out. It was such a fiasco in the kitchen that after I put the banana slices and walnuts on top, I stuck a fork in the side and started eating; I knew the presentation could not get any worse (it was just for family, luckily). Use a different frosting!

I made this cake twice.The first time I followed the recipe, calling for a 1/4 cup of yogurt or buttermilk, and found the batter too heavy and not enough for three cake pans. I increased the buttermilk to 3/4 cup, now the cake is lighter and can accommodate three 8" cake pans easily. Served it to my co-workers, it was a hit!

Yum-yum...I made these in muffin tins, added cocoa powder to the frosting, and put crushed pecans on top. WOW!

I've made this cake many times. I use a different frosting recipe but primarily I am writing to say that there is NO WAY this would make 3 8" layers. If you stretch the batter to two 9" you get two thin discs. It's almost better to double the recipe to get two fat layers.

Rating: 3
I've used this recipe about 3-4 times now to either have a tasty snack on hand or to get rid of old bananas. I don't like banana bread and this recipe is much lighter. I put it in muffin tins and skip the frosting and it's still good. My four year old loves them. A handy recipe to have and one I know I'll be revisiting many more times.

This cake was not bad, but I think I'd try to find a better recipe rather than make it again. It was a little too sweet for my taste. Maybe I am simply a banana bread, not cake, person.

The idea of a layer of ripe bananas didn't appeal to me so I just made the cake recipe and baked it in a 13x9 - don't do this - it makes a very thin cake. Still tasted good. I also used cinnamon cream cheese, which was tasty but not as cheesy (it was sweeter) than I thought it should be for the cake. I guess they write recipes a certain way for a reason! (Never hurts to experiment though...)

This is the yummiest banana cake I've come across and really easy to make. I've used vanilla yogourt instead of plain. The cake is nice and light, fresh flavour. I agree with a couple of the comments below, especially if your bananas are small, better to add 3, and the recipe makes a lot of icing (too much). Also I have never bothered with extra banana slices in between layers, but usually don't make the icing anyway. It freezes really well (without frosting) and is moist without the frosting, if you want to cut back but still eat your cake!

Rating: 3
This cake was just what I was looking for with a light tender crumb and knockout banana flavor (if you use fully ripened spotted bananas) I did use 3 bananas in the cake, a total of 1 1/2 cups. No other changes except I made 18 cupcakes with the batter. I found that 1/2 recipe of the frosting was plenty to frost them.

To beat well the sugar-butter mixture with eggs seems to be a key point to get a nice and fluffy texture. It turned out a very nice cake. I've used brown sugar and apple bananas, otherwise following the recipe closely.

I should add, you should only make 2 layers otherwise the cake it too thin as the previous reviewer found

Rating: 1
I made this cake for a friend's birthday. It was just horrible. The three layers were so thin, I didn't even frost it. We tried to eat the unfrosted layers for breakfast as banana bread, but it just tasted lousy. After a few bites, we ended up feeding it to the squirrels (who seemed to enjoy it). Fortunately I had time to recover in time with another cake (giant coconut layer cake) which was fabulous. Don't bother with this recipe.

Rating: 4
After reading everybody else's reviews....I doubled the recipe except for the mashed bananas, used three 9" pans, and blotted the sliced bananas before putting them inbetween the layers. This makes one very big cake, and it tasted lighter than banana bread. I got great reviews from the choir party that I made it for. One guy really likes banana anything and he loved my cake. (I didn't make the frosting, I used store bought cream cheese frosting instead, still yummy)

I made this cake for the Iowa State Fair - I took 2nd place in the banana cake class - I would definitely recommend 2-8 inch pans (9 inch is too skimpy!!) - the judges liked the raspberries - I used them between the layers and as a garnish on top - I used my own brown butter cream cheese frosting - thank you

This cake was wonderful. I made it for a fathers day brunch and it was a big hit. I added a layer of banana pudding in the middle layer with fresh banana and strawberrys. The cake is reminicent of a banana bread and the frosting is creamy and delish!

Delicious cake. I added 1 Tbsp of lemon juice and that enhanced the banana flavor. It was moist and my guests loved it.

Rating: 3
I also did the 2-9in. layers, and they were a little short but very tasty. One recipe made enough for 9 kids and 9 adults for a birthday party, with leftovers. To prevent browning I dipped the banana slices in water w/a little lemon juice, and dried them w/paper towels. Be careful! It made them VERY SLIPPERY and I had sliced them too thick so assembly was a comedy. I staked the top layer on with plastic straws through the cake (a tiered-cake trick) and coated the sides of the cake with sprinkles to cover up the bowed sides and the occasional banana sticking out! But everyone loved it.

Rating: 3
So glad I read other reviews. Not much cake batter - I would have panicked it I had make 3 layers. Just did two 9" layers, used another reviewers idea for fresh raspberries to top the bananas. I make it for a co-worker for his birthday, and everybody loved it!

A great classic banana cake. I prefer higher layers so I used 2-8" cake pans. Try fresh raspberries between layers. Absolutely delicious!

I knew right off that this recipe lacked spices, as another reviewer mentioned. So I added cinnamon to the flour mixture. And I topped the cake with chopped walnuts covered in cinnamon sugar. It was spectacular! I'm a cinnamon freak, so if you're not, don't try this at home!

I made this cake for my boyfriend and his house mate... It was a perfect cake for college boys. mmmm I used the 2 cake pans as well, and put wood rods in it as I frosted it to keep the cake from sliding around.

I made this cake for a graduation party. My first attempt gave me super moist, dense cakes(I added 1/2c extra bananas)that were to thin. The next time I doubled the recipe and used three nine inch rounds.(and the EXACT amount of banana) It came out lighter and just the right thickness. I made some pralines to decorate the top but they came out to soft and didn't look nice so I ground them up and made a paste. I spread that between the layers along with pastry cream mixed with a little whipped cream. For the frosting I used Chantilly. It was a hit. With the cakes from my first attempt I used two of the rounds, used praline paste as a filling, cut them into little squares and drizzled dark chocolate ganache over the tops. They were rich and nummy. Next time I make the cake I will put ganache between the layers along with everything else.

I seem to be in the minority with this one. I found this cake quite dull and uninteresting, it was not at all light and fluffy quite the contrary heavy and doughy. I will stick to my own Banana Cake recipe, not as big but the texture is absolutely delicious. Sorry everyone

I also used 2 9" pans and baked for 18 minutes. It came out great. The top is quite sticky so be careful turning it out.

I followed someone's review to use 2- 9" pans but the layers were still fairly thin. So I made two more! It was a huge cake but sooo good. Maybe 1-1/2 times the recipe with 3- 9" pans will be my next adventure. I added an extra package of cream cheese and reduced the powdered sugar to 3 cups to the frosting so it wouldn't be as sweet and I thought it was perfect with that modification. I also sprinkled fruit fresh over each layer of bananas so they wouldn't turn brown.

I doubled this recipe and it made three gorgeous layers. I made it for my boyfriend's birthday, and as he does not like cream cheese, I made a bittersweet chocolate frosting with it and it was wonderful. It ended up being about a foot tall, but everyone still asked for seconds. Now I'll have to make it every year.

My layers didn't rise well at all, making me think I had done something wrong. It may be better for appearance sake if one used two pans instead of three. I think the flavor will be all right though when I assemble it tomorrow. Anyone has any thoughts why it was so flat? I used yogurt in place of buttermilk.

This cake is wonderful. I think next time I will squeeze lemon juice on the banana slices to prevent them from turning brown. Otherwise this recipe is a winner. My family loved it!

Great recipe! I added chopped walnuts to the batter which gave it terrific flavor. Decided to use 2 9" pans so the layers wouldn't be too thin. The cake was deliciously moist. Frosting was excellent. Just enough cream cheese and not overly sweet. Topped it with chopped walnuts. Everyone raved about this cake, said it looked and tasted like it came from a bakery! Will make again and again...

Amazing -- nice change from the usual vanilla or chocolate. My husband and I are not frosting lovers so next time, I'll frost between the layers and the top, but I'll leave the sides unfrosted (it looked interesteing before I frosted the sides, too!) Now that I have done one cake, I know to put more banana in between the layers. But this is a DEFINITE recipe for me to keep with subtle changes for our preferences.

This cke was wonderful, it was nice and moist, I made 2 layers and split them, instead of cream cheese frosting & filling, I used whipped cream frosting and filled one layer w/ fudge sauce and bananas, and the second layer with whiped cream and strawberries, then frosted entire cake with whipped cream frosting from another recipie. Made this cake for my mom's b-day and she absolutely loved it!!! will make again very soon

I also made this cake for my son's first birthday party. I was nervous I wouldn't have enough for 20 people making one 9" round cake so I made two 8" round cakes. One 8" would have actually been enough. A little piece goes a long way. One thing I would change next time is where the recipe says to spread the icing thin between layers, I wouldn't spread it as thin as I did. It was all banana and cake on the inside and frosting on the outside. I might also put in a little less confectioners sugar (very sweet!) and add walnuts to the frosting.

I have no choice but to make this recipe again. I made it for my son's first birthday party, and my best friend asked me to make it for HIS birthday (nine months from now!). It was amazing.

I also made the layers one day ahead, which made life much easier on the day of the party.

This cake was delicious! Even people who don't usually like cake enjoyed it. I made it for about 20 people, so I doubled the recipe and used 10" square cake pans. It worked well, but the layers were a little thinner than I expected. Since it was a birthday, I used white cholocate to decorate -- the flavor went very well. I also took the suggestion of making it a day ahead -- easier for me and the banana flavor was all through the cake.

This cake was a hit with all people I shared it with. Have only made it once. I found it filling but not heavy and not too sweet. It's the kind of cake you would expect to find at a very expensive restaurant. I found the recipe easy to follow but the bananas kept sliding around until the icing got chilled and they stayed fresh. It lasted in refrigerator for almost six days. The recipe makes a large tall cake. I followed the recipe exactly as listed. The icing was the most time consumming part of making cake. A definate must try recipe.
