Made this recipe last week as a test run for Passover. Fantastic idea to replace an old stodgy time-worn course. At least for one year. My family will be thrilled! Not sure why folks review negatively without even trying the recipe. They should have a separate section for "opinions only"

If there is one dish that does not need updating it is Matzo Ball Soup! My family looks forward to the traditional recipe each year at Passover and would be shocked, stunned and appalled if I served them carrot and turmeric matzo balls. No thank you!

This was a big hit at seder last night. We gave guests option: mix, match and also offer two broth options: clear and puchy (bits of chicken, celery, carrot). Spinach version particularly is a keeper. Great idea, Susie: folks get tired of "same ol', same ol'" at Passover. Adding a bit of color and flavor variation puts smiles on faces looking ahead to seven days of matzoh!
