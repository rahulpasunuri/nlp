I modified this a little & loved it! I reduced the olive oil to 1/3 cup, juiced & zested half a lemon, added a pinch of salt, 2 minced garlic cloves, & 2 Tbsp white wine vinegar. We at our kabobs with brown rice. Delicious!

Way too sour and without much flavor. This was disappointing, after the previous reviewer's glowing words. Perhpas adding a large amount of garlic to the marinade and decreasing the lemon juice by half would give a better result.

Lamb never tasted so good. Perfect recipe for this cut of meat!! This easy to prepare dish surprised everyone with tender savory pieces of lamb. I will definately make this again for a dinner party.
