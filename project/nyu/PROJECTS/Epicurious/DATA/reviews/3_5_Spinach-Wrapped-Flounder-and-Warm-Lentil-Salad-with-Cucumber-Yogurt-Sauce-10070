I'm not a big fan of sea food, but my husband is. We both enjoyed this meal very much. It's filling without being heavy, and the 'fishy flavor' is very delicate.

This dish could be an entire meal all by itself as it contains fish, vegetable and legume. That's a good thing, because it's a lot of work. I have to say that the yogurt sauce really made the dish -- it was delicious. The lentils and fish, frankly, did not have that much flavor. That said, in the future, I'll at least double the sauce, to make sure there's plenty.

I made a couple of minor adjustments. I used collard greens instead of the spinach, so decided to put curry powder on the fillets before wrapping them with the greens. I also added tomatoes to the lentil salad. My friends all wanted the recipe as it was light yet still substantial.

Healthy, delicious, and satisfying. Used dried mint and sole, didn't have a cucumber; everything turned out great. Will make again!

This recipes was very interesting. A lot of different flavors. The cucumber yogurt sauce was had way too much garlic. I served with additional spinach and finely chopped tomatoes. The lentil salad was very good.

This dish is quite different from what I usually serve at home(we LOVE spicy and pungent flavors). It came as a complete surprise that my husband and I both LOVED every aspect of this meal. The flavors are fabulous. I did squeeze out the extra liquid from the cucumber after pureeing. I also used 1/2 cup yogurt, drained it in cheesecloth for about 20 min., and added extra garlic to the mixture. I used fat free feta to save on fat and calories. Really good; extremely healthy!
