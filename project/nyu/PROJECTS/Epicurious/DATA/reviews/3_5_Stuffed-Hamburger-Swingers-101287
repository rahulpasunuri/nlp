With changes definitely a 4 fork: Mixed garlic powder, salt, pepper, cumin and cayenne pepper with egg then added ground sirloin. Used dried tomatoes, cilantro, jalapeno, red pepper and scallions, salt and pepper for salsa. Made half of patties thicker to be the top. Made slight cavity in center bottom patty to add salsa. Put on top, sealed then picked each burger up in my hand to seal any holes. Put in refrigerator for at least 40 minutes. To grill, husband separated coals on two sides and put burgers in middle and flipped burgers only once. Added mushrooms to sauteed onion. This was a mistake; mushrooms too strong a flavor. In fact sauteed onions weren't necessary either. Will leave out next time. Mixed half sour cream and half mayonnaise, added lime juice and hot sauce. Put on grilled buns. Stayed together and were delicious. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/ Stuffed-Hamburger-Swingers- 101287#ixzz1B8jVcSE3

I give this recipe 4 stars with the few modifications that I made after reading other reviews. I thought the combination and proportions for the "salsa" ingredients were great. I grilled rather than fried the burgers, added pepper jack cheese and sliced avocado on top, and grilled the bun. Making the patties very thin was key but I still needed more than one pound of beef for 4 servings. Great, refreshing, and got rave reviews from my family.

Delicious! I substituted bison meat (lean & hormone-free). Served with broccoli topped with remaining "salsa" ingredients and a small serving of angel hair pasta and marina sauce garnished with cilantro

Very good! I left out the tomatoes because, well, I don't like tomatoes! I probably should have cut back on the Oregano b/c of this. I also think fresh Oregano would have been better, but we didn't have any. Oh well. Got a great reception from my parents and I liked that they weren't stuffed with something high in calories like cheese or bacon. :) I would definitely make these again!

ok second time around and can't help but to add a little. First time followed recipe exactly. Excellent. This time added some chives, parsley, shallots and green chilli (seeded) and left stuffed patties overnight to marinate in own juices. What a difference a day makes - perfection.

Oh yum! These burgers were deeelicious. One pound of meat made four burgers easily, though you definitely need to make them THIN. Next time, I'd use a little less meat on the bottoms and save a little more meat for the tops, so they can stretch over the filling. (I added chunks of sharp cheddar cheese along w/ the "salsa" filling inside the burgers.) Also, had some of the filling left, so served it with avocado and goddess dressing as a side. Oooooh good!

Very good. I used a few other's suggestions for substitutions/additions: a little salsa to compensate for my lack of tomato, pepper jack cheese crumbles in the middle, and the mayo mix of lime juice and chili powder for the condiment. My father and I agree that it's got complexity, but it's almost too subtle - it brought out the flavor of the meat more than add new elements. A good one for meat purists. Will try again with different ingredients (almost anything can be substituted).

Ok, was it just me, or did anyone else have trouble keeping the burgers together? My "stuffing" kept falling out, so I put everything back in the mixing bowl and mushed it all together. Then I made my hamburgers. I put a piece of cheese on before piling on the grilled onions. Very good, and I will definately do again!!

These were good - be sure to use enough salt and pepper (I would have liked more in mine, and will do that next time). Would be great with steak sauce or a similar condiment (Pickapeppa from Jamaica would be terrific). Also, maybe it's just me, but it wasn't that quick and easy to dice up all the veg as small as I wanted them... didn't love the sound of crunchy big raw pieces of pepper & onion inside the burger.

Very easy and quick to make. I decided to add a chunk of Monterey Jack cheese like one reviewer suggested, and I would do so again. I would also recommend dicing up a canned jalapeno and adding it to the vegetable stuffing.

This was an outstanding hamburger - savoury and delectable. Instead of the tomatoes, I used sun dried tomatoes - which I found added punch. I also found that you do get eight patties - You just have to make them very flat - which is fine - because each burger is made up of 2 patties! Also, the burger was so moist and full of flavour there was no need for condiments. Conclusion? A great everynight kind of dish!

I made this for my husband and found that it was bland.

I could only get 6 patties out of 1 lb of ground beef, and those were small, so my suggestion is to double the recipe completely unless cooking for two. This is a great tasting quick recipe that adds that something special to hamburger. I also added a cube of monterrey jack cheese in the middle with the vegetable stuffing--love my cheese. Served with corn on the cob and fresh green beans--great summer meal. I definitely will make this recipe again.

When I came across this recipe, I thought it sounded OK. I normally serve Jerk Burgers from this site, but wanted something easier, yet different from the same old burger. WOW! What a treat. It is suprising how something so simple can make the burgers so special. My Brother-in-law, who was dissappointed that we were having burgers for dinner, ate two, asked for all the leftovers for the next day, and claimed these the best burgers he'd ever had....as did everyone else at the table. If you can get it, use Montana Natural Beef

this dish turned out great. Tons of flavor, I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used sundried. yummy!

Delicious!! I made these last night(Thurs.) for dinner, and my husband has requested I make them again on Sunday. For a little extra flavor, I whipped up a sauce of mayo, lime juice, and a pinch of chili powder. Great weeknight dish!

A new staple in this house! I used oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes instead of fresh ones! Scrumptious! That gave it a wonderful flavor. My husband is a tough critic and he loved them!

It is very rare that my children request that I make something again. But this one was unanimous in that regard! If this wasn't a hamburger review, I would give it 4 forks.

I also chopped the filling (green pepper/tomato/onion) into very small pieces. It gave gave the burgers flavor and a small crunch that was nice!

The secret is to dice the vegetables very small. My boyfriend will not eat tomatoes so I left them out of half of the mixture. They were great both ways!

I have found this recipe on this site a couple of years ago, and never forgot it. (We've tried cheese filled "swingers" - delicious) Great idea.

The flavor was okay, but the vegetables were still pretty much raw inside the burgers.

My picky 17 month old LOVED these! He figured out how to take it apart and eat the inside and thought that was just grand. These were definitely a hit with the whole family.

Delicious!! Very flavorful, moist burger. My husband is on a low-carb diet, and this fits in perfectly. I served with swiss cheese and dijon mustard (no bun), and it was great!

Very tasty. The vegetable filling gave the burgers a nice fresh flavour. I had some leftover fresh mushrooms and I sauteed those along with the onions. These burgers make a quick and delicious dinner.

These were the most delicious hamburgers I have ever had. I put cilantro and cheese in with the tomatoe onion stuff and it really added something. I served them on hamburger buns and put dijon mustard on them because I didn't have any regular. I wasn't sure how that would turn out, but it was delicious!

These were one of the most flavorful burgers I've ever had. My husband absolutely loved them. I've made them several times. One time I made it with cilantro and just a touch of salsa because I didn't have any tomatoes. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who loves a burger with a ton of flavor!!

If you love salsa, you will really enjoy this burger. It was so tasty, especially since I used garden vegtables. Very delicious!
