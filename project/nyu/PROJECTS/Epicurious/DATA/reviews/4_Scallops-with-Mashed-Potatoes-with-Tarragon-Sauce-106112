Delicious and easy! I used less butter for the mashed potatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe. We thought the amount of tarragon called for was just right. Yummy!

This was very good, but I had to put my own twist on it as I do not like Tarragon. I added a clove of garlic to the potatoes, used less butter and some half and half and added minced green onion and parsley in place of the Tarragon. Then I doubled the wine, reduced it, added 2 tbsp of butter, then a grated clove of garlic, 2/3 cup of half and half, 2 more tbsp butter, salt and pepper, cooked this on very low heat, seared the scallops, deglazed the pan with a couple tbsp of water, added the deglazed pan juices, then green onion and parsley and a tbsp of parmesan cheese at the end. It was soooo yummy.

Fabulous! We loved the mashed potatoes with tarragon. We made a couple edits, however. 2 minutes for large sea scallops is a bit much, I think. We also weren't sure how we'd feel about the sauce, so we left it on the side which proved to be a good move. We could have ditched the sauce altogether, and just cooked those badboys in some butter on medium-high heat!

This dish was just so-so in my book. The sauce was mediocre (& we love sauces)--should have been amazing considering the amount of butter. The mashed potatoes were very good, though, & the prep method/time for our scallops was right on!

Yummy! The potatoes with the tarragon sauce was delicous then topped with scallops heavenly. I served steamed asparagus with this dish and just circle it around the potatoes making it a one dish meal. of course tarragon goes great with asparagus so this a a wonderful meal

It is a fine recipe. The texture of the potatoes does closely resemble the delicate texture of the scallops. Unlike many other cooks, I adore tarragon and to NOT think the recipe calls for too much, but, I do love tarragon. Bring on the bernaise (!), (okay, but not as an addition to this recipe). Because I eat flax seed instead of wheat, I do not have a problem with cholesterol -- I used all the butter and doubled the cream.

I didn't have any shallots and not even onions! I winged it with 2 garlic cloves, plenty of fresh chives, and one stick of lemon grass I happened to have. It turned out excellent. I listened to those who warned again too much tarragon and was grateful to them.

This was an excellent recipe and easy to do for a dinner party (not time consuming to make at all). The only trouble I had was keeping the scallops warm while making the sauce. It was delicious and a big hit at our party.

OMG! This is one of the best recipes I have gotten from this website..and I have gotten many great ones! I made this for a dinner party, everyone absolutley loved it. I thought about changing the mashed potoatoes to something else but in the end I chose to make them. Glad I did, they went nicley with the scallops and as another reviewer had said it was a nice change from having it over pasta.

This is really delicious! I was attracted to this recipe because it didn't call for pasta as an accompaniment....a nice change of pace for scallops. I used Bay Scallops (about a handful per serving) instead of Sea Scallops, because that's what I had on hand. It's easy and delicious. I halved the recipe, because it was just my husband and I. I used dried tarragon, and only put 1 teaspoon into the sauce. I didn't add any to the potatoes, and it was just the right amount of seasoning. I served it with green beans. The longest part of preparing this dish is peeling and boiling the potatoes. Once they're boiled, the whole thing takes maybe 5 minutes, if you have all the ingredients ready! If you use new potatoes, you don't even have to peel them; just mash them with the skins. You can use your favorite type of potato for mashing, it doesn't have to be Yukon Gold. Wonderful recipe, and I will make this many more times!

I'm giving the rating to the sauce - I made this tonight as a trial and the sauce was excellent. I used fillets of sole, and instant mashed potato and for veggies, sliced carrots and peas. And it was trully excellent - it will be even finer when I make it for company with scallops and real potatoes! I doubled the sauce - that's a must.

Rating: 4
WOW! My Dad hates mashed potatoes so I used Basmati rice, halving the tarragon in it. The sauce was terrific, and it all paired well with the rice and plated beautifully.We served it with royal beans (they cook to a deep green) This would be wonderful for a dinner party. For those who can only get tiny scallops, try briefly poaching in white wine then use as if sauteed.

This is a great recipe. I had some awesome sea scallops and the sauce was exactly the right touch. In addition, I have an herb garden and the fresh tarragon is always one of my favorites. My husband, son and daughter-in-law loved the dish.

Loved this dish! Absolutely make double the sauce and also make as the other review says, make the sauce in the same pan as the scallops for better flavor. I used the same amount of tarragon and found it to be perfect as it was.

Love this recipe. I think this recipe is not to be cooked like daily dishes but once in a while when you want to have a different taste. It is very creamy and heavy but worth having.Ease up on the tarragon.Overall a great dish to add in the collection.

My family loved this recipe. I enhanced the flavor of the sauce by pouring the wine and shallots into the skillet that I had cooked the scallops in. I know the wonderful butter and carmel left in that pan should never be wasted. After scraping up all that flavor I then retuned sauce to small pan and added remaining butter, cream and fresh tarragon. My twelve year old daughter said it was wonderful.

AFTER READING ALL THE EXCELLENT REVIEWS ABOUT THIS RECIPE, I'D REALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DELICIOUS. THE COMBINATION OF MASH POTATO AND TARRAGON IS GREAT; HOWEVER, IT OVERCAME THE LIGHT FLAVOR OF SCALLOPS. INSTEAD OF USING SCALLOPS, I THINK THAT USING CHICKEN MIGHT BE A BETTER CHOICE.

I made this tonight for dinner to great reviews from my husband and guest. I thought it was delicious. We have the good fortune to regular access to fresh sea scallops so I am always looking for new ways to prepare them. I doubled the sauce based on previous reviews. It was incredibly tasty. I did use fresh tarragon and whipping cream. I served it with a green salad with vinaigrette dressing. Will definitely make this again!

Undeniably tastey. But, the sauce did not come out quite as I had imagined; I was picturing something creamier in consistancy versus runny as butter. I know there is a lot of butter in the reciepe but did I perhaps do something wrong? Is this the way it's supposed to be? Loved the shallots and tarragon and the potatoes were the perfect accompaniment. Will make again and next time change the cream-butter ratio.

This was very special. I will definitely make again, but it is not something I would make frequently because it is so rich. I used 10 dry scallops/serving - they weren't very large. Next time I think I would go with 6 or 8. Doubled sauce and served with a nice autumnal salad with apples, bacon, greens and blue cheese. Just great. RH

Rating: 4
I love this sauce! I did double it as others suggested but I ended up with a lot left over but it was great the next day over the mashed potatoes. I used frozen scallops from Trader Joe's but they tasted great. I will make this again soon and next time I will try it with prawns.

Fabulous recipe! Very elegant and delicious but not difficult to make. I've made this about 4 times, the 1st being for my parent's 45th wedding anniversary. As my mom had total knee replacement surgery 3 wks prior, going to a restaurant was out of the question. This was oustanding and comparable to high quality restaurant fare. My parents still rave about it!

This was such a different way to serve scallops. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the tarragon sauce. We actually had this again a week later and I think I ready to do it again soon!

Rating: 4
I thought this was a very tastey dish, my guests really enjoyed it! I was able to get some very good quality sea scallops, which certainly added to the success. I made the potatoes ahead, instead of adding milk by the spoonful in the warm-up, added a bit of the sauce (which I doubled), this worked very well. I thought that 5 scallops were better than 3. I served the dish with a simple green salad and a wonderful Pinot Gris.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. I couldn't find any fresh tarragon so used dried but the taste was still wonderful (would have preferred fresh of course!). With dried tarragon, I added it to the sauce while it was simmering so the flavor would be absorbed into the sauce. I also sprinkled it on my mashed potatoes with a little cream instead of milk and that worked well too. And I would suggest doubling the number of scallops...I used 24 for 2 people and it was just enough (with double sauce and 2 potatoes). Use the same amount of butter for double scallops since a lot of liquid comes from them anyway.

From the start I questioned the potato thing. I chose fried polenta as a base to serve on instead. This worked out wonderfully! I also deglazed the skillet with the wine to give an added zing; this took away a little from the presentation but gained in flavor.

I enjoyed the scallops and the potatoes but not together. The scallops and the sauce over a little buttered and tarragon sprinkled angel hair pasta would do more justice to this rich and delectable sauce then for it to get lost in the creamy potatoes. I would serve these delicious potatoes as a side to any other dish but not the scallops. There is too much competition between the two.

I love the tarragon cream sauce, it makes the dish especially elegant. I added 2 cloves of garlic to the potatoes while cooking and mashed them in for added flavor. Check out the Chicken Louisa recipe also on this site: a similar tarragon sauce and budget friendly with chicken.

This dish was very easy to make, yet when served seemed fancy to the guests because it plated well. I used small organic Yukons and added a little nutmeg, so they had plenty of flavor. Also, I meticulously timed the cooking of the scallops at just under two minutes per side to avoid the chewy overcooked effect. I will probably mince the shallots much more next time, or strain some of them out, but not a big deal. Adding this one to the repertoire!

I must have totally screwed up the recipe because the mashed potatoes were really bland; I could barely taste the butter. Maybe I used too many potatoes (but it was 2 lbs as recipe indicated)? The sauce for the scallops was very good (my wife didn't like it though). It's an interesting flavor and the crunchiness from the shallots made it have an interesting texture. I might save that part of the recipe and use it for an appetizer.
