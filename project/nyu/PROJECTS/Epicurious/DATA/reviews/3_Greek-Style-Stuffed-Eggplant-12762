Added fresh marjoram and thyme plus a light sprinkling of dried oregano. Used fresh mozzarella and parmesan instead of feta, and added short grain cooked brown rice for texture and body. It was delicious, devoured by my generally veg-averse teenagers, who actually took seconds.

In my oven, the broil setting is too strong, so I should have baked the unstuffed eggplant a little, then broiled. Also, once stuffed, baking would have been better. It was more like an eggplant salad in an eggplant cup, so next time I'll cut the eggplant smaller so the filling binds more. Good base recipe for experimentation, but not that special.

Bland and dry? I wouldn't say so. I followed the recipe and it was anything but dry. Now bland is a matter of taste I suppose. I found the dish delicately flavored and certainly not oversalty, although there was no need to add salt with the saltiness of the feta. I guess you have to trust your tastebuds and taste as you go along. Good satisfying dish but not the best eggplant dish we've had.

This recipe was not very good at all. I followed previous suggestions and added extra diced tomatoes and spices (oregano and cinnamon). I also added about half a cup of red wine and let simmer for half an hour. It was still dismally bland. It didn't taste anything like the yummy eggplant I ate all last week during my trip to Greece! .

I was using small white eggplants so I just cut them up and made a casserole out of this. I too added the Kalamata olives, but I thought it was too dry so I added a can of diced tomatoes. Didn't put in the mint but since it was still a bit boring I went to my Moussaka recipe and then added wine vinegar and cinnamon and then sprinkled more Feta on top.

I also thought this was dry so I ended up adding a can of diced tomatoes, left out the mint but added cinnamon and some wine vineger after looking at my Moussaka recipe. I also added the Kalamari olives and put more feta cheese on the top.

It was okay but kind of dry and boring. I followed the recipe pretty closely but used two small eggplants for each large one. It looked nice! If I were to do it again I'd use more olive oil, tomatoes, and mint. I'd use less onions.

Easy, yummy and pretty. To the person who found it too salty: after salting the eggplant for 30 minutes, I held it under cold water until it ran clear.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it turned out beautifully. The mint and parsely added a great flavor and I don't think the dish would have been the same without them.

Omit parsley (you shouldn't use two strong spices on the same dish), and like the previous reviewer said, add kalamata olives and substitute feta for chevre... much nicer... great dish!

broiling the shells to just the right cooked-ness takes some skill, but otherwise, this dish is quick and simple. the end result is surprisingly rich, considering the fact that it is mostly made of vegetables.

I cook on a daily basis, so I should be able to make this. But reading the previous reviews, I almost feel like I did something wrong. It was too salty for my taste, and I think it had way too much mint. kind of left a funny taste in my mouth.

ADD Kalamata Olives !!! This is similar to a recipe that I lost from a great greek cookbook my ex-girlfriend had (she got the cookbooks), but the other one added the olives. Because they are salty, use milder feta. Can be made without the parsley and mint and will still taste good. I submerge the eggplants and shells in heavily salted water rather than sprinkling them with salt (it removes more acids).

Simple and delicious. The tip from the previous poster suggesting fennel seed was a good one - yum! I prefer making these with chevre instead of feta, because the milder taste of that cheese (as opposed to salty feta) enhances the vegetables. I'm a vegetarian, so I make this with rice pilaf for a complete meal, but if I'm having company I can offer it to meat eaters as a side dish and everyone's happy!

I added fennel and stewed tomatoes to this dish, and it came out very nicely (Mushrooms might be good too). I made a large Greek meal with several dishes and this one was the favorite!

i really didn't expect much from this recipe, as eggplant isn't one of my favourites. How wrong I was, it was delicious.

I liked this recipe as a side dish. It would also be a nice vegatarian dish. To add a little crunch to it I sprinkled a little italian style bread crumbs on top just before serving.
