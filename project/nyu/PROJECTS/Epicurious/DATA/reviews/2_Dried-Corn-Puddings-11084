I have made this dish dozens of times in the last 10+ years. Copes corn is a flavor of my childhood. There must be 20 possible variations by adding dried tomatoes, mexican seasonings, parsley, cheese and so on. I always use white shoepeg corn.

This is a very good recipe. John Cope's dried corn has been a tradition in my family for years.. if you've never had it, it's worth the search. (My family from Ohio keeps me stocked at the holidays, it's not available where I live.) The recipe for Baked Corn Supreme on the back of the box is also excellent. I highly recommend it; it's a distinct flavor - nutty and sweet.
