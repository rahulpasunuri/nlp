This recipe is fantastic and has become our family's Thanksgiving meal. Easy and delicious. Watch the roasting time carefully as the hens will not need the cooking time suggested.

I made this for dinner for a group of six. It was fabulous! I followed it exactly, with these changes: Didn't have dried sage, so used fresh (adding more than 3/4 tsp., of course); used currants, instead of raisins; pecans, instead of hazelnuts. Oh, and I prefer local-so I bought organic,locally farmed poulets from my butcher. They were about 1.5 pounds each, and the roasting time was close.

I am very attached to the "Figgy Piggy Cornish Hens" recipe's way of roasting Cornish game hens, they have come out perfectly every time. I was intrigued by the stuffing in this recipe, and made it as a side dish. Followed the instructions up until stuffing the bird, added 1 1/2 cups of water and when boiling, added a package of stuffing. Mixed well and covered, then turned off stove and let sit for a little while. Turned out terrific and I got lots of compliments on the whole meal.

Unless your hens are ice cold, the cooking times are way too long! I took the hens out of the oven after 50 minutes, and they were already overdone. And they hadn't even been glazed. I painted on the glaze and put them back in for five minutes to set the glaze. Despite these troubles, the end result, though dry and overcooked, was tasty, and the stuffing was terrific. That said, I had to add some chicken broth to it before putting it in the hens, as the onion and fruit mixture just didn't combine well at all with the dry bread. But with less cooking time and a bit more broth or butter, this is a real winner.

Made this for a dinner club....received all compliments...esp loved the chutney glaze!! I substituted pecans for hazelnuts and cranberries for raisins and did cut back some on the lemon juice (too tangy)....

Tasty stuffing and excellent/easy recipe for hens. Made this for the first time for a Thanksgiving for two and it turned out absolutely lovely. I made extra stuffing and cooked separately for leftovers but it sure didn't beat the stuffing inside the hens - so delicious!

Really nice twist on traditional poultry! Used Major Grey's brand of chutney, and thought the tang was just right, but it was the stuffing itself that we truly enjoyed; wished the birds were bigger so we could have had more stuffing!

excellent dish made it for christmas dinner everyone loved it. Added mango to the glaze as the lemon juice and chutney was a little tart.Left the hens for 25 mins in oven after glazing, may have made the hens a little dry next time will leave it for only 10 mins, will definately make again and again.

Excellent recipe - I used 3 tbl of lemon juice w/ the chutney as recommended and shelled hazelnuts. Everything else was as written - it was awesome - my guests raved on and on. This will be a favorite company recipe from now on.

Loved the stuffing. Didn't have hazelnuts, so used macadamians. Cooked for 70 minutes at 400 and were done perfectly. The chutney glaze was way too sour with the lemon juice added to it, so would either leave it out next time, Or I might try using apricot preserves instead of the chutney.

Excellent recipe fairly easy to prepare. Big hit for dinner parties.I served with risoto and fingerling carrots.And topped it off with a bitter sweet chocolate mousse.

This was a hit at thanksgiving. I used 3 1.5 lb. hens so I had some leftover stuffing which I cooked on the side for about 20 minutes. The stuffing on the side was a little dry, so add some broth to it before baking. I used old french bread, chopped toasted almonds and fresh sage and basil. The glaze was a nice addition as well.

I've made this twice already...always a huge success. Chutney glaze is to die for!

I made this for my Gourmet Dining Group, and it was a hit. I was able to fit all the stuffing into the hens, so it was nice and moist. I served them with wild rice and Asparagus with Parmesan Butter (from Epicurious). Very nice!

I made the glazed hens but used a different stuffing recipe on this site (wild rice stuffing with hazelnuts and dried cranberries). Just reviewing the hens, the glaze was phenomenal! I will definitely use this on hens again, or chicken parts. This stuffing recipe was too fruity for our taste, so I chose another one. But the glaze alone makes this recipe worth it!

My guests loved this dish. I was disappointed in the leftover stuffing that I cooked separately. It was much too dry. Next time I would add some broth and/or wine before cooking the extra stuffing.

Finger Lickin' Good! If nothing else, make the chutney glaze!

I cooked this for Christmas dinner 2000 and it was a bit hit! There's nothing like eating a whole chicken to yourself!! I used mango pulp instead of chutney, for a lighter taste. It worked a treat! I'm making this again for dinner soon. Delicious.

This was totally delicious!! I made it for Thanksgiving for my husband and mother-in-law, and it received rave reviews from all. I made the glaze days in advance and merely reheated it before glazing the hens. I also used almonds and only four hens, and baked the extra stuffing separately. I made a pan gravy from the drippings, and it was great on both hens and stuffing. I can't wait to share this recepie, and to make it again!

This glaze is incredible. It is wonderful on chicken too.

I used all onion, no shallot in the stuffing, more garlic, chopped dried mangoes instead of raisins, pecans instead of hazelnuts. The stuffing is very good, but the hens are absolutely superb. I made a quick mango sauce to complement the glaze and to serve especially over the breast meat (which was still exceptionally moist): 1 pureed, strained mango, cayenne pepper, chilli powder, 2 T soy sauce, fresh cilantro, and fresh scallions. Served with lemon-garlic asparagus and mushrooms for a lovely meal. I will definitely make these hens again, and will try the glaze on chicken legs for a buffet.

Wow is this one tasty. I used the almonds and it worked out just fine. Too bad it is so messy to eat. I made 4 hens and cooked the extra dressing at 325 with the necks. Boy the stuffing is good. And it is a very attractive presentation with the glaze.

The hens present beautifully when served with a gingered mixed brown rice and a colorful vegetable on the side. It's gotten rave after rave since the first time I served it in '93.

Great recipe. Served it twice in one weekend to guests; it as a great success. One of the best new recipes I have tried in a very long time. It also allowed me time to spend with guests while hens were in the over which is always a plus. Didn't bother with hazelnuts, used chopped almonds for texture; worked out fine.
