Such a mess! Easy recipe to follow but something went wrong. Great flavor but the texture was never right. I also think that the 6oz. portion was way too much and I love dessert!

This is a wonderful dessert. I find that everytime I make it, it comes out slightly different but always delicious!

A friend made this and it was fabulous! So I tried it a few weeks ago and it was delicious! There were only 4 of us so I had 4 remaining ramekins. I refrigerated them and my husband and I had 2 the next day (refrigerated for 24 hours) and the last 2 on the second day (refrigerated for 48 hours). They were all good. Next time, I'll make them in advance and have them chilled. I served these just alone and they were a total hit!

Delicious! I serve it with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce. I find that I have to beat the eggs for much longer than 5 minutes. I am beating them for closer to ten minutes. And I get enough for 10 ramekins. It comes out great, so I am not worried, but if I can do something to make them even better, then I'd love to hear about it!

Very good but very sweet! Living at 5280 feet, I raised the oven temp to 380, increased flour by about 2 full Tablespoons and baked for 14-15 minutes. I cooled for nearly 10 minutes before removing from the ramekins. The frangelico ice cream made to recipe was a bit too strong for me on its own but with the cake became much more mellow and pleasant. I could not eat this every day but would not hesitate serving this for chocolate lovers!

I have made this several times to rave reviews. Then, I over cooked. Not to worry.....I took them out of the ramekins, poured chocolate ganache over, topped with chocolate whipped cream and a chocolate covered strawberry and got more rave reviews!!

I was introduced to a dessert like this in Paris and in searching your files I was pretty sure this would produce something similar. Well, it is the most delicious new dessert I have tried in many years. It was better if left to cool a little longer than 5 minutes so the center gels somewhat more....but is still warm. Also, I left a few in the refridgerator and baked them about 3 hours later. I saw no difference in the finished product, so it could be prepared for company in advance and baked just before serving.........it only takes about 12 minutes.

I am a beginner cook so for food to turn out like it's suppose to is a miracle for me; luckly my husband usually catches me right before I'm about to majorly screw up the recipe. These are really good, however I can't wait to get the recipe right enough for the center to come out like pudding, instead of hot chocolate!! Lastnight I cooked them for 15 minutes like the previous reviewer stated, I was even closer this time. I have cooked them longer and the bottoms get over cooked (gross) but stil the middle is runny!

Wonderful! Chocolate lover's dream. I made these with Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate and served with vanilla bean ice cream and fudge sauce at a work party and got raves. I made them the night before, chilled them overnight, and warmed them in a microwave before serving. However, when baking I found that the cakes needed to be cooked 15 minutes instead of 12 to turn out.

Everytime I make this recipe the people I serve it to make amazing gutteral 'mmmmmms' through to the last bite - I've taken that to be a good sign. I use Scharffenberger chocolate (bittersweet) for my chocolate - it has a flavor that is incredible.

I'M MARILYNE THE PASTRY CHEF AT BRIDGES RESTAURANT WHO SUBMITTED THIS RECIPIE. IN RESPONSE TO THE WRITER FROM OREGON--YES, YOU CAN MAKE THE CAKES AHEAD OF TIME, REFRIGERATE AND BAKE IN THE OVEN JUST PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR MEAL.

Excellent with raspberry sauce!

Question: How do you do this for a dinner party, since obviously some of it must be done ahead of time? Do you make the batter, put it in the fridge, then pop them in to cook as dinner is ending, or do you bake them earlier and then re-warm them? Thanks

This dessert tastes amazing and is incredibly easy to make. The Frangelico ice cream is a wonderful accompaniment....I've served it 3 or 4 times and it gets rave reviews every time!

A very good recipe! The cake was light (I generally prefer a denser texture) but the pudding center made for a rich contrast. It was simple to prepare, yet very impressive. It recieved raves from my guests!

This was the easiest dish to make for my dinner party and overshadowed the dinner. My guests were amazed. I served it with some fresh rasberry compote and dusted it with sifted powdered sugar to complete the look.

The first time I had this recipe, it was in a french restaurant and I fell in love with it. I've searched a long time, and am so glad that it is hear for the world to enjoy. In the restaurant, they made a note of it being made with Valrhona chocolate, and along with the ice cream, served it with a tart raspberry sorbet to balance the sweetness. When I get around to it, I'm going to use better chocolates . . . but even with my first attempt with Baker's, it worked out fine!

I did not even serve it with ice cream and it was yummy! I used the semi-sweet chocolate....not only is it divine, but is was very easy to make!

Absolutely Fabulous!! We are real chocolate lovers so we skipped the ice cream and, believe me, mouth watering does not begin to describe! Probably the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted. So all you chocolate lovers....enjoy!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. The cooking time was questionable, and the flavor was bland. Next time I'll just drink a glass of Frangelico instead!

This dish is both delicious and easily-prepared. My guests raved about it and it only took minutes to make!
