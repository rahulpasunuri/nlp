Outstanding! I wish I had written down exactly what I did, because this rice pudding was the best we've ever had. Here's what I can remember: I used organic brown rice and distilled water, the latter for allergy reasons. For dietary reasons I used nonfat milk -- maybe 2 1/4 cups -- and left out the extra egg yolk and the salt. I didn't have raisins, so I used sweetened dried cranberries -- the soft kind from Trader Joe's. I baked the pudding in an 8 x 8 inch ceramic baking pan. I skipped the water bath but did put a pan of hot water in the oven to create a moist environment. I baked it for a really long time, first at 325°F and then at 300°F when the top started to get all caramel-y. I'd guess I baked it for about 2 hours altogether. Toward the end, I put foil on the top. The texture was perfect -- not at all dry -- and the maple sweetness contrasted beautifully with the tartness of the lemon and cranberries.

I would use less syrup next time, but other than that I thought it was delicious! I followed the exact recipe, except for the whole milk. I didn't have any so I substituted 1% milk + half and half. Turned out great. Definitely making it again.

A bit on the sweet side (next time I'll substitute extra fine surgar for half of the maple syrup), yet everyone at my table thought this recipe was a "keeper".

This is a great recipe for left over cooked rice you don't know what to do with. I used only one egg,whole milk and used golden syrup (Aussie) instead of maple syrup. It turned out wonderful. Very creamy and not too sweet. Topped it off with custard for a great winter dessert.

After reading all the four-fork reviews I figured this one would go over great - but my kids spit it out. I didn't like it either. I don't know, maybe my family is crazy, but as far as we're concerned it was a waste of a rather expensive 1/2 cup of maple syrup.

The flavor was actually okay, but the texture was a letdown --- don't use this recipe if you're looking for something smooth and creamy. Maybe omitting the eggs would improve it...

This recipe had really good flavor only mine turned out pretty dry and not very pudding like. I will use less rice next time.

I read the comments left before by others and I did this: I used soy milk instead of regular. I made the pudding in 6 individual cups. I cooked it in a convection oven at 320 for 50 minutes. It turned out PERFECTLY!!!! Very tasty and not too sweet!

Delicious & so easy I made it twice in 1 night to use up leftover rice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly & it was a bit dry, so I used 2 cups of whole milk the 2nd time. I love that it's sweetened only with maple syrup since white sugar is hard on the body! Will make every time I have extra rice lying around!

This is the best rice pudding I've ever eaten!

I made this recipe exactly as prescribed (apart from baking) and had perfect success. The cream added last is essential, otherwise it is dry. A very good recipe that uses left over cooked rice and prepares easily. I baked it 45 minutes at 200 C with a fan forced oven.

The BEST rice pudding I have made AND eaten. The lemon is superb and the maple syrup adds such a "natural" sweetnes. You have to try it to believe it!

I've made this recipe twice (and will make it again sometime) - we loved it. However, both times it has been a little dry for our taste. The second time I made it, I increased the liquid by 1/4 cup, which was still not enough. Maybe some of the problem is because I was using 2% milk. The leftovers heat up great in the microwave - with a little extra milk. Lots of raisins and the syrup make it a sweet treat, but not overly so.

This turned out great in spite of my substitutions. I used non-fat dry milk instead of whole milk. I was fresh out of pure maple syrup, so I used good ol' pancake syrup. No nutmeg, but lots of cinnamon. Followed the baking instructions to the letter, except I used a 9x12 glass pan instead of the souffle dish.
