For those who found it bland: salt to taste (not always amount listed in recipe) and a bit of lemon zest and/or juice right before serving. For those who disagree with the cooking time: oven temps vary so trust your eyes and nose, not just the recipe. Bacon or pancetta and brussels sprouts are a match made in heaven.

Nice easy recipe, quick to prepare and tasty. I did not trim the fat from the pancetta and did everything else per the recipe. Cooking time and temperature were perfect. I wonder if the people who had burning issues broiled instead of baked?

Rating: 4
I, too, had to use more olive oil than the recipe calls for. I added enough to lightly coat the brussel sprouts. Because my husband doesn't eat pork, I substituted D'Artaganan duck bacon which is wonderful. I also added 2 coarsely cut shallots per pound of brussel sprouts which add an amazing flavor when carmelized. This easy recipe will be a staple in our house!

I can't believe this was rated so highly, I was really disappointed in this recipe! I found it fairly bland (thank goodness I'd added more garlic, not that it helped much). The only aspect of this dish that I liked was the crispiness of the Brussels sprouts, but I definitely would not make it again. :(

A wonderful and easy recipe. I did not trim the fat from the pancetta and did add some extra olive oil. For my oven (which is quite accurate) the cooking temp and time was perfect. I used a metal roasting pan...maybe the type of pan determines the outcome. I did not do the water step. My husband raved about it!

Rating: 3
Next time I would not trim the pancetta of visible fat. And I'd up the olive oil a bit. Forgot to do the water bit at the end so will try next time. Our oven has been wonky temperature-wise so looking forward to trying this out again soon with the new oven.

Addendum to my review. The cooking time is definitely TOO LONG. I pulled out my dish just as the sprouts started to burn maybe 25 min. I think 20 min at 450 is plenty. 425 might be better.

I thought this recipe was good, but not great. Made it exactly as stated, and we like brussels sprouts. Seems like it needs something more to send it over the top. But I love how easy it was, and all in the oven. 'll make it again, but experiment a little next time.

Rating: 4
Love this recipe. So delicious. The sprouts were just a bit / nearly burnt by the time 25 minutes passed, but the high temp gave them a wonderful crispy texture on the outside that I would not want to do without. Maybe next time I'll reduce the time by a few minutes. I added crushed red pepper, more garlic, omitted the water and also added a dash of lemon at the end.

I used Prosciutto this time, which was good, but I think that bacon really works better. The sprouts needed a bit more fat than the very lean meat I used. I could have added a bit more olive oil, too. Overall, I think bacon or pancetta gives a better flavor. Still, wonderfully yummy!

This recipe is so simple and easy to make, but tastes fantastic. The pancetta really brings out the sweetness of the brussels sprouts. I would wager to guess that people who "don't like" brussels sprouts might be turned on to them by this recipe. I followed the recipe to a T, and it was great!

Don't fiddle with this recipe. Trust the simplicity of ingredients and the roasting to bring out the best in this vegetable. The pancetta adds just a hint of smoke and the roast garlic adds a little nuttiness. Really nice.

Rating: 3
I made this without the pancetta and added some red wine to the wash instead of water. I actually wouldn't recommend adding the red wine as some of that nutty flavor got lost in the tart/vinegar of the wine. Perhaps a 50/50 mix of both would do really well. Overall, a really great and simple recipe!

This dish was fine, but I can't say much more than that about it. It probably would have been better had I started it in a skillet - the pancetta would have crisped up better. Also, instead of water, white wine would have infused more flavor. There are better brussels sprout recipes out there. I likely won't be making this one again.

Best recipe for brussel sprouts. I added some shallot to the garlic and deglazed with water. You could use wine but it really doesn't need it.. Delicious.

This was really easy - hardest part was prepping the brussels sprouts. It was snowing the day I shopped and my local store does not carry pancetta, so I used hickory smoked bacon. Was really good. I used the water - if I had stock open, might try it. I was serving with a peppered pork tenderloin (which needed to cook at 350 degrees, so I roasted the sprouts, removed to a covered side dish, lowered oven temperature, put the pork tenderloin in the same roasting pan and during the last 5 minutes added the sprouts back in - was awesome together.

I agree with the other reviewers who said that this recipe is an extremely easy and tasty way to make Brussels sprouts. I used 2 pieces of applewood smoked bacon, and it was way too much. Next time I'll probably use pancetta, or just 1 piece of bacon. I also agree that deglazing with liquid at the end helps keep the sprouts tender. I would keep the pan in the oven for a few minutes after deglazing, though.

Very good, but prefer the Bon Appetit November 2003 recipe in which the sprouts are drizzeled with blasamic vinegar after roating. I can't find that recipe on this website, only in my magazine.

Have made this recipe every year since it came out and ALWAYS a big hit, even with Brussles Sprouts haters.

This was fabulous!! It's the best brussels sprouts recipe I've tried life-to-date. I think looking for the smallest and best sprouts is key.

Rating: 2
Not being a big fan of pancetta, I used prosciutto parma instead. The prosciutto crisped nicely and added just the right amount of salt to the dish. I too used 425 instead of 450 oven temp - the sprouts opened nicely. The dish lacked zing though - bitter sweet sprouts, salty prosciutto but after first bite, it was a bit flat. I tossed the sprouts back into the cast iron skillet, added a splash of balsamic vinegar- juice from 1/2 a lemon - toss - and back on the table. Perfection! Last thought, if you can, use a cast iron skillet instead of a baking dish. I think the seasoned skillet added a little flavor not found in a clean and sterile baking dish. An ok recipe that needs a little zing if thats your thing.

Rating: 3
Cooked it at 425F and they got slightly over-caramelized. Be sure to cut all your brussels sprouts in half, this allows the sulphur compounds to escape during cooking, which eliminates the unpleasant tastes. Left the fat on the pancetta, very tasty!

I made this dish for my cooking club (tough crowd) and everyone raved. It's quick and easy and really tasty. I usually don't like brussel sprouts. I bought sprouts still on the stalk and used the smallest ones (less bitter). I also added those white almonds they sell at Whole Foods at the end. Fabulous!

Rating: 3
A nice variation to make a much maligned food a happy addition to a healthy dinner. My four year old hated it, but that's no surprise. I added some toasted pine nuts right at serving and found them the perfect addition. The nutty flavor really made the roasted greens "pop". I also noticed that trimming the stems too close should be avoided because those sprouts will open up and dry out a bit too much. Will make again.

Rating: 4
A really nice way to have fresh sprouts. I also added chicken broth at the end instead of water. We didn't have pancetta, but I used two slices of bacon and that worked well. I also turned the oven to 425 after tossing the veggies halfway through the roasting. These are easy and quick and so healthy, even with the bacon.

I love brussel sprouts and was so excited by the ratings this recipe received. I assured my husband, a known and confirmed Brussel Sprout Detester that he would finally be converted! I happily cleaned my 2 pounds of Brussel Sprouts, (purchasing extras so that I would be able to enjoy the highly lauded "leftovers) and followed the recipe down to the Pancetta, testing for doneness starting at 15 minutes, and adding the water at the end for a light glaze. (15 minutes was absolutely correct for my end of season small sprouts). They smelled fantastic! Sadly, I have no idea why, but the lovely golden outside leaves tasted horrible and the just tender centers tasted bitter. I am so disappointed. Even the panchetta seemed to be spoiled by these darn rotters. I will go back to my lightly steamed then sauteed b.s.'es that I know and love and hope someone who rated this a 4 will invite me over for their A+ rated sprouts as mine ended up in the trash.

A recipe I keep coming back to--I use smart bacon to make it veggie, extra garlic to make it, well, garlicky, and I keep roasting them until they're brown on the edges. I found this recipe while trying to copy the sprouts served at Mama's in NYC, and for those that know those sprouts, these come close. I often throw them into another recipe after roasting them this way.

these are awesome. first time i made them i used chicken broth instead of water and it was delicious. last few times i have forgotten that step completely and they are still yummy. i use proscuitto also. just make sure you roast long enough for them to be tender. they also still taste great a day or two after as leftovers. we've had them about 6 times in the last month and my husband (who is 44) refused to eat them his entire life until i "forced" him to eat these - now he's a convert.

I've made this recipe a number of times, those that don't like brussels sprouts love these.

I wondered how this would be with no meat....since I didn't have bacon or pancetta, I tried it. The vegetarian version was very good - the roasting adds so much flavor, and with the garlic and spices, it's definitely not bland. The roasting also takes away any bitterness. Have made before with pancetta, vey nice, but good to know you can do without in a pinch.

This cooked a lot faster than I expected - it was done in more like 15-18 minutes, and some of the leaves were starting to char (yes, I know my oven temperature). Maybe it was because I always use small sprouts - they are usually more tender. I made it exactly as stated, as other reviewers had recommended. Having done that, now I would add more garlic, and definitely substitute white wine for the water, which really didn't do anything for me. Otherwise, a really nice dish and one of the few that makes brussels sprouts palatable, although my house still smells like sprouts.

This dish was delicious. I took the lead from the previous reviewers and made a few, minor changes. First of all, I didn't have pancetta, so I used one large slice of regular old bacon. It worked fine. I substituted French white table wine for the water at the end. I also used two large cloves of garlic and a small shallot. In addition, I added some rather large asparagus spears that I had in the crisper and cooked them at on one end of the pan. At the end, before serving, I squeezed a half of a lemon on the vegetables. We liked it so much, going to make it again tomorrow night! A keeper for sure.

I never thought I would willingly eat brussels sprouts, let alone MAKE THEM myself. (Blame it on a horrifying encounter with boiled sprouts in the teenaged years -- a similar experience also kept me off asparagus for the better part of two decades!) But a friend made these at Christmas, and they were DELICIOUS! We've had them several times since then, and I'm really digging the little green globes! Definitely don't leave out the water at the end, somehow it makes it better -- more flavorful/moist. Yum! I used proscuitto just because I didn't feel like waiting in line at the deli for pancetta -- but have had it both ways and it is GOOD!

This is the second time I've made this recipe and I followed it exactly both times. The second time, I think it got a little overdone but it was still delectable. My husband always thought he hated brussel sprouts but he sure does like these. Do yourselves a favor and follow the recipe exactly........then make your changes the next time. (such as more garlic, more oil). Most cooks have spent a lot of time figuring out the blending of flavors.I personally think that the second time I could have used more EVOO the last time I made it but it was still soooooooooo tasty. But who knows what temp my oven really is?

I have always loved Brussels Sprouts and I'm thrilled to have a new way to prepare them. I also increased the amount of pancetta and garlic.I must disagree with the reviewers that feel the water was unecessary. Just that small amount deglazes the pan of all those yummy brown bits the pancetta leaves behind and then kind of "glazes" the sprouts. I made this using cauliflower and also that funky "brocciflower" thing you see in the produce section and wonder what the heck to do with it. Anyway,this is a great recipe and I rarely steam my brussels sprouts any more.

My husband & I loved this dish, but then we eat brussel sprouts often-- usually steamed or sauteed. I thought roasting added a smokier, earthier taste that was wonderful.

We love brussel sprouts, and liked this new method of preparation very much. Few hints though...1) I'd opt for the largest sprouts I could find, as the smaller ones cook too rapidly, and be sure to trim them well, 2) I'd check for doneness after as little as 15-20 minutes, 3) and finally, I didn't see the point of adding water at the end at all. A little thyme wouldn't hurt either.
