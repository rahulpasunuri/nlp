Made the recipe as written except used a whole small grated yellow onion, so maybe 1/3 c. Tastes great to me - DH says he can taste the yogurt, which is a negative to him. Be warned, though - 1/2 small head of cabbage slices up to more like 4 cups. This recipe says that 7 cups of vegetables + 1 cup of dressing (so 8 cups total) is 4 servings. Then with the extra from using 1/2 head, you quickly end up with a lot of slaw.

Great salad and very quick and easy. I stayed on recipe with the exception of adding extra grated onion, a touch more dill and a tablespoon or so of grainy mustard (not dijon, Inglehoffer brand). I left out the green pepper, as I didn't feel like it would add to the overall flavour. This is also a great slaw to use as filling in a wrap. Give it a try.

Nice fresh flavours - the dill really makes this dish.

Fresh, beautiful, and light. Didn't enjoy it as much the next day, but loved it yesterday. Will make again using yellow peppers.

Delicious! I used yellow pepper and it was beautiful. Added extra dill too.

I find many coleslaw recipes to be too sweet or too tangy, this one was just right. You taste the freshness of the cabbage, and the celery seed adds that special coleslaw flavor! Make sure you salt and pepper enough, to bring out the TOUCH of sweetness and TANG of the vinegar. We made a double batch, and the leftovers were just as good the next day.

I made it for my daughter's birthday bar-b-que one hot summer evening and served it in chilled Armetalle Bowl. It was a huge hit, very yummy. I didn't have any green pepper, only red which didn't change the flavor much, but I don't think looked as pretty because it's color clashed with Red Cabbage--next time I might try using yellow pepper which would be pretty or orange (not a big fan of green bell pepper). The night before I used a mandelin to finely slice cabbages & pepper and Crussinart to chop baby carrots. The prepared vegtables were stored overnight in a huge ziplock and the easily whipped up dressing in an air tight container; then about 30 minutes before serving tossed together and put it in chilled bowl--everyone raved...much better than store bought slaw & adults came back for seconds & thirds!

Made this just yesterday (God bless my Cuisinart!) and thought it was OK. My husband and I agreed that it needed more zip. It was beautifully colorful, and I did leave out the onion, which would have helped with the flavor. All in all, not a bad basic recipe, just kick it up a bit to your taste.

I liked it, especially the fresh dill. Next time I will leave out the green peppers (not a big fan) and add more grated carrot. It looks very pretty with the different colors.
