This was such a fun recipe! It was surprisingly fast (45 minutes, start to finish), the presentation was beautiful, and it was De-Lish! The combination of ginger, garlic, cilantro, lime, and basil are very reminiscent of Thai food. I would do it next time with Thai basil and rice noodles, and call it a Thai dish. Yum!

The poaching liquid was wonderful (I saved it for a future Bouillabaisse). In addition to the cod, I also poached about a pound of sea scallops and used Broccoli Raab istead of regular Broccoli. The result was flavorful and delicious. It was almost like an Italian version of that good old Vietnamese Pho with seafod instead of the typical chicken or beef, and angel hair instead of rice noodles. Will definitely make it again. The leftovers are going to become a fish chowder for tonight.
