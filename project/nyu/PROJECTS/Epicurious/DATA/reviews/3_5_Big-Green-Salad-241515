I made the dressing as written and used it on a mostly mache salad and thought it was wonderful.

Boring. It was fresh, crisp and clean, but the dressing lacked serious flavor, which it needed for such a simple salad. More citrus to the dressing may have helped.

I used the dressing on a plain lettuce salad, and it is quite tasty.

I liked the dressing but thought the overall salad was a bit blah. Would make again but with perhaps a few more ingredients

a beautiful presentation and a very quick dressing. I added avocado to add another green component to the salad.

Wow. This looks like such a simple combination of ingredients, yet the salad is a fresh, mellow addition to a weeknight meal. Very nice with a little feta, too.

I can't do honey, so I substituted Real Maple syrup. It was pretty darn good!

Outstanding. Such a simple dressing and yet it has depth and freshness. I'll be making this for my Wednesday treat for people at work this week.
