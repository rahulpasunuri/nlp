Quick and delicious! This is the kind of recipe that makes you look like a chef without laboring in the kitchen for hours!

This is a great way to whip up a side dish quick....and it'll still taste like you spent time on it. I cut down a little on the butter and put extra OJ in it to make it healthier and it still tasted very good.

This was so easy and really fabulous. All three of my children as well as my husband ate this up, and they normally think asparagus is so-so (and no one likes olives!) I added a small extra splash of OJ before I added the olive paste and reduced it. It went beautifully with a roasted chicken that I had stuffed thyme, rosemary, butter and lemon rind in between the meat and the skin. I will definately make this again, and will keep it in mind for the occasions when I serve a lot of people - the asparagus can be blanched ahead of time and just reheated in the olive mixture.

This was a definite loser. This was the first time I have an leftover (a lot) asparagus that I can remember. Generally, it doesn't matter how much I cook, it is all eaten.

This was very simple to make. My guests all asked me at the end of dinner for the recipe. The olive gave the asparagus a meditteranean taste. I served this with Monk fish that I marinated in ginger and orange juice. it was a nice combo.
