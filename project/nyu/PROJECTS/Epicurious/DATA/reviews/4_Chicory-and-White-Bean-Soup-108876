For some reason, I had in my head that chicory was just another name for radicchio. Oh my, is it ever.. not. They are in the same family, so the soup still turned out yummy, but MAN...with the purple tipped leaves added (and then partially BLENDED?!) to a white bean soup? Tonight's dinner looks like something that would be served to inmates in a prison movie. It's kind of cracking me up...hope my hubby as the same sense of humor about it!

the best soup ever

I've been making this soup for years and it is very popular since it is tasty, healthy and easy to make. I use escarole instead of chicory and add a few drops of tabasco and a squirt of lemon at the end. I use a stick blender and puree the whole batch of soup.

This was one of the best soups I have ever made or eaten. I substitued chard for the chicory, because my grocery store did not carry chicory. Also I added a potato to thicken the soup just a bit more, all of the pototoe went into the part that went in the blender. The result was amazing!

I liked the cobination but I think there is definetely a failure in the recipy. The soup liquid gets unpleasantly bitter so one should could chicory separately.

Absolutely delicious and flavorful. This soup improves in taste every day after it is made.
