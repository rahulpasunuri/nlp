This recipe is SO good, especially for something so simple. I make it all the time, and like it best as a side dish for salmon, barbecued chicken or lamb. The pine nuts MAKE this... don't leave them out.

Really nice! Took it to the beach with herb roasted chicken. Everybody was quiet while eating and finally somebody said, OMG, that's sooo good! Substituted shallots for garlic. Didn't cook the cherry tomatoes, but tonight I will. Doesn't keep well, but that's no problem because it's usually gone!

This recipe is a keeper - few ingredients and minimal prep time. Fresh and flavorful. It's a hit at summer bbqs so be prepared to be asked for the recipe.

This deserves 4 forks because of the simpleness of the dish and its preparation. I like it with parsley and feta for a more greek taste. I also like it with basil and fresh buffalo mozzarella for a more italian taste. It's versatile and can be served warm, room temp or cold. It does get gummy after a day, so don't make much more than you need. I cook the garlic with the tomatoes until just wilted and dump in the other ingredients. I use balsamic vinigrette to taste and TONS of salt and pepper. I also add some extra olive oil at the end to round out the dish.

It was a good recipe, I forgot the basil the main reason I wanted to make the recipe!! UGGH, it was a keeper very tasty. I boiled the garlic for 30 seconds it takes the bite away from the garlic but gives you the flavor.

It's a good thing I doubled the recipe! Everyone had seconds! The only change I made was adding a tablespoon or so more red-wine vinegar.

Rating: 4
Tasty and versatile, practically foolproof. I dont think I ever measure the ingredients. (1/2 teaspoon Balsamic vinegar? Are they mad?) Ive added tuna, chicken or feta to make a meal of it. White Balsamic vinegar is an attractive alternative to traditional Balsamic. The texture of orzo makes this recipe unique but you could substitute any salad-friendly pasta.

Loved the dish. Perfect for those hot summer days when you dont want to eat something heavy. I will make this again with grilled chicken or lamb. Delicious!

Easy, filling and fresh tasting pasta dish. Served it for a family dinner party for 7 adults and 3 children. Sauteed grape tomatoes cut in half with extra virgin olive oil and a tablespoon of minced garlic. The pine nuts are a must and I used basil. The red wine vinegar livens the dish as did half of a squeezed lemon. I served it at 15 minutes after cooking. Next time I will add more tomatoes and feta.

I LOVE this pasta salad and make it year-round. The parsley is a must. I make it as the recipe instructs and think it's perfect. This is a winner for company and pot lucks

My friends have begun calling this "crack salad" - because you just keep going back for more, no matter how full you are. It is that tasty. However, for the best results you absolutely have to substitute basil entirely for the parsley. Also, I often add extra garlic and pine nuts. Finally, I don't bother to saute the pine nuts - just toast them in the oven (much easier). You can toast them at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes or until golden. It always gets rave reviews & is my requested dish for family get togethers, parties, etc.

Really easy and really delicious. I didn't make any changes and my finicky fiance gobbled it up. We should have had leftovers but he ate it ALL! I served it as a side with the lemon & caper chicken and sauteed spinach. Very nice meal with a mediterranean feel.

This is a great simple meal. I like the freshness of the flat parsley. It's a nice uncomplicated flavor. My only change is that I double the red wine vinegar and oil it boosts the flavor - if you like it strong.

Very nice recipe! Per some of the other reviews, I substituted cherry tomatoes for drained canned tomatoes and used sherry vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. I also added a second clove of garlic and 86'd the pine nuts b/c couldn't find any at the store. I heated the tomatoes, garlic, pepper, and a pinch of sugar in a saucepan just long enough to heat and added to the pasta, vinegar, and feta. Everyone loved it!

I loved this- so healthy, easy to make, and delicious. I can't wait to make it again. I couldn't find orzo, so I just used bow-tie pasta, and it came out fine.

I made this last night as a side dish with some grilled sausages and veggies and it was perfect. I will definitely make it again. I followed the suggestion of many others and used balsamic rather than red wine vinegar and also substituted fresh basil for parsley. The only suggestion I would make is that it needs a bit more salt.

At last, a recipe from this site that actually was easy for me and came out the way it should. Loved it- good to pack for lunch, too. Didn't have pine nuts, used walnuts and was still good. If I'd had pre-crumbled feta, would have been even faster. Love it!

Excellent, simple and company quality side dish. You could add kalamata olives but the recipe as written is a place to start. It says 2 as a main course (I can't imagine?) but it serves 4-6 as a side dish. I served this along side Chinois Grilled Lamb Chops with Cilantro Mint Vinaigrette for a fabulous dinner. The lamb recipe is from Chinois on Main in L.A. a Wolgang Puck restaurant/recipe.

This was fantastic! Light and clean tasting. Perfect summer supper dish - with grilled meat (lamb would be the best). I had a cucumber and added it quartered, de-seeded and sliced thin. Found this after referral from reviewer of another feta salad recipe said this was much better. Believe her! Notes: orzo takes at least 15 minutes to cook. This is better at room temperature than cold - more flavorful.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times and it never disappoints. We like it just as the recipe is written as well as with frequent substitutions. I often use sherry vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar with great results. I have also used several of the suggestions left by other reviewers: basil instead of parsley, can tomatoes drained and cooked slightly in a little olive oil to release the juice when I didn't have fresh ones, other nuts, chopped Vidalia onion or scallions, olives, grilled chicken, etc. It's just a wonderful dish that is so versatile.

I LOVED this recipe! I served it with lamb like someone suggested (which was great) but the orzo was so tasty that I ignored all other items on the table just to fill up on this! Don't make any changes, just follow the directions and prepare for a heavenly meal!

This recipe was delicious and was well received by all. I took it to a party where many of the guests had never heard of orzo. Once they gave it a try they were hooked. Relatively easy to prepare. I made it a couple hours ahead of time and let it chill for a few hours in the fridge. Yummy!

Rating: 3
Even my husband, who professes to dislike feta, liked this salad. It was a great complement to chicken wings and would go as well with any simple grilled meat. It also makes a pretty potluck dish. I'm not sure it's really filling enough to be a main course, unless there is a lot of other food on the table with it.

Very good - best eaten that day. With each subsequent day I liked it less, as the orzo absorbs the liquid and becomes gummy, and the tomoatoes become more mushy.

Love this one!!! Add some leftover grilled chicken breasts and you have a meal!! You can use chopped walnuts if you don't have pine nuts.

INCREDIBLE! If you like orzo and feta, you will LOVE this dish! We served it with a green salad and broiled salmon. My housemate made it and when I first saw it, I was so impressed by the colors, smells and beauty of the salad, perfect for summer or Christmas (the parsley and tomatoes give it a red/green look). The vinegar is key, but what really makes this salad is the toasted pine nuts. We used Israeli sheep feta, my favorite. I will make it again and again!

I made this dish as a side for the coriander flank steak, both recipes turned out great! I did make two changes however. Rather than parsley I used chopped fresh cilantro and rather than toasting the pine nuts in oil I just popped them in the toaster oven to lightly brown them. It was a great meal!

big flavor in little time! Dry toasting the pine nuts cuts down on fat (pine nuts have enough already). Definitely recommend the fresh basil substitution and making enough to have plenty of leftovers.

Yum! Served it with rotisserie chicken from our grill. The explosion of flavors from the balsamic, kalamata olives and feta were a little much for my 13yr old, so next time I will follow the recipe rather than the suggestions and then I think I'll experiment with the basil vs. parsley ideas and then perhaps a Mexican version with cilantro.

Rating: 4
Love this recipe! It's excellent hot or cold. I sauteed the tomatoes for a short while in a bit of olive oil to release the juices, which added a lovely tomato coating to the orzo. I also added fresh basil instead of the parsely, as well as some fresh spinach that I wilted as I sauteed the tomatoes (I recommend using more tomoatoes than the recipe calls for too). So good as either a main dish or side dish. This summer, I have a feeling that I will be bringing it as a (cold) side dish to many, many BBQ's! YUM!!

Delicious & easy! Adding raw garlic to a salad made me uncomfortable, so I only used a little. I also used balsamic vinegar; however, because the amount called for in the recipe was quickly absorbed by the orzo, I splashed some Wish Bone Balsamic Vinaigrette over it just prior to serving. Also served it on a bed of baby spinach - very colorful!

I don't know that I actually made this recipe because I had to make quite a few substitutions for what I had around the house. I took other reviewers advice and used basil and balsamic vinegar instead of parsley and red wine vinegar. I also used feta w/peppercorns. I didn't have any tomatoes (and my roommate doesn't like fresh ones anyway) so I decided to put in about 1/4 c chopped white onion, and about 2T canned crushed tomatoes w/ garlic. My roommate LOVED it. I thought it was pretty darn good, too. It's good as leftovers the next day too. Don't worry about heating it- it's great as a cold salad!

Rating: 3
Like another reviewer I also used balsamic vinegar and found that that worked extremely well but I found that it needed a little more olive oil. I also used feta cheese made from goat's milk which has a milder flavour. And as my partner does not like to eat orzo I used "spirali" shaped pasta.

Like another reviewer, I too used basil instead of parsley. It was great. I used only 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar instead of 1 1/2. I thought that there was a slightly excessive amount of pine nuts so I didn't add all of them. Overall, it was a delicious, fast recipe.

This is a very useful recipe to know, especially when you are in a hurry. I served it for company with grilled swordfish and it got raves. Here's my modifications: After you brown the pine nuts and remove to drain, add the one Tbsp olive oil and heat. Then saute the garlic and tomato halves (instead of quarters) just until wilted. Dump this all into the orzo, and add fresh basil (instead if parsley), feta etc. I only used 1/2 Tbsp red wine vinegar and served it hot. It was a wonderful and easy dish. I also used pre-crumbled feta that you buy in the grocery store in packages (Athenos brand). I just discovered this Web site and I love the reviews!
