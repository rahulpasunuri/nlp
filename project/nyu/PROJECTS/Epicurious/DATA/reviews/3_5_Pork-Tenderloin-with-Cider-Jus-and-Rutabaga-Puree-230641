Simple, delicious, good. changes: I used anise seeds and ground all spice, a couple pinches of each. Had to sear and then cook in the oven. I also made the rutabaga w/sauerkraut from the boyami review. Basically, you can take liberties and still end up with good stuff.

Not a fan of this recipe, although it sounded good. For me, the anise overpowered the sauce and did not complement the pork well. Would highly recommend the pork with apricots and mustard instead if you're looking for a good sweet pork dish.

Wonderful sauce. I used homemade chicken stock and it was just right, not too thick. I served with rutabaga and carrot puree. Would be nice with braised bok choy.

Excellent! A nice change from thicker sauces on tenderloin - the sauce is wonderful and you can still taste the meat! Used light cider and cloves instead of allspice, and only about 3 Tbsp of butter. Made ahead and reheated when the pork was done. Also used olive oil in a very hot pan to brown the tenderloin then cooked in oven at 350F for 20 minutes. Really really delicious!!

I have been making this for years, and if the jus is too thin, continue cooking. I always brine my tenderloins, and this last time, I used the rest of the apple cider I had (fresh)with 1/2 cups Kosher salt and a pinch of sugar. When I grilled it I did not oil the loins and they had a great flavor

We loved this simple dish. The sauce took just slightly longer than the pork. I cut recipe in half and used anise seed instead of star anise and just 2 T butter for two of us. Excellent flavor for a simple sauce--served with mashed sweet potatoes.

I have made this recipe 3 times and each time everyone loves it!! I have not been able to find star anise so I just leave it out and it still comes out great. The rutabaga puree, I also add a carrot or 2 and it adds color and flavor yum!

I could drink the sauce.

Dinner party of six and everyone loved it. However, I felt it was a little thin. Adding a little corn starch might be the trick. I might try that next time.

this was absolutely wonderful. I cut the sauce in half, and it doesnt take much sauce because the flavor is so strong. It complements the pork perfectly.

Have already made this dish multiple times. The second time I reduced the cider mixture to syrup like consistency before adding the butter. I used halved shallots instead of the chopped onion for a more delicate flavor. Served with the grilled pork and butternut squash gnocchi in a sage butter sauce.

A great fall meal! Roasted the pork in oven vs. grilled as in the receipe. Skipped the rutabaga puree and served roasted butternut squash instead. Awesome! Cut jus recipe in half no problem.

This was a marvellous! I had to use anise seed and dried thyme but it came out just great. I made the Rutabaga (Turnip) Puree and served it all with sautéed Bok Choy. My family of five all gave it a thumbs up.

kepeneter - the rutabega recipe is a separate one. Click on the link. It is not really fair to rate a recipe you haven't tried.

The cider sauce is truly wonderful. I followed the directions exactly except more time was required for the reduction than indicated. Rather than barbecue the tenderloin, I sauted thin medalions of pork in olive oil. I served with acorn squash and an apple salad instead of the rutabaga puree-- a great Fall meal!
