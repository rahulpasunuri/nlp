Great simple recipe, worked perfectly and didn't stick (even though I didn't use a non-stick pan).

a great reminder of a classic dish. I used 1/3 cup chopped frozen spinach and a slice of brie for my filling. yum!

This was so simple and came out better than most omelettes i've tried. I followed the recipe exactly and can't wait to try different combinations for fillings:)

Fantastic. Come out perfectly every time. Our favorite filling: onion, thyme and mushroom (pref. portobello) - plus cheese of course. Our new weekend staple.

Because of this recipe, I'm no longer afraid to make omelets. I did everything exactly as stated and the omelet came out perfect. I stuffed mine with feta, spinach, tomato and kalamata, and I put some marjaram in the egg mixture. As I was eating, I daydreamed about making this for other people, because it's so good. Unfortunately, it's hard to make more than one omelet at a time...

I think that milk to egg ratio is very important and this recipe nailed it.

My favorite meal of the day is breakfast. I love the omelettes, hash browns etc., but couldn't get my omelettes to come out 'just right'. This recipe is perfect. It explains very well the trick of the trade to have a perfect omelette. Today I used three eggs with lots of filling. Next time, I'm going to try egg beaters. Happy Cooking!

I've never had an omelette turn out right until I used this recipe!

I agree with previous reader. Sometimes it's nice to get back to "the basics".

There's always someone snotty that puts in a revue to tell us novices how unecessary it is to have such basic recipes on this site. However, I've learned so much off this site. I want to learn to make a variety of dishes WELL. This recipe is well written and my omelette turned out fantastic. Now I can make omelettes for friends without looking like a dolt! Thanks again :)

Try a little olive oil too. It's a match made in heaven.
