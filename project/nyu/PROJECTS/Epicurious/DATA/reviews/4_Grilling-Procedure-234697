Clay, please play nice. I am not a novice cook, but I have never grilled (my ex-husband had an innate fear of benzopyrene). Now that I will grill on my own, I need to play catch-up. Be kind to those of us who are still learning, and I won't speak ill to those who can't make a souffle.

ClayinIowa: Nice to hear you've conquered the task of boiling water, and since you already know that 'recipes' like that above are for people who've never used certain cooking procedures before, you also know that your heaping dose of sarcasm is unecessary and unwelcome; and before you give yourself a headache coming up with a witty retort - my boyfriend doesn't do most of the grilling - I do, and I'm just a girl.

If you like this one you should check out the "SALTED WATER FOR BOILING" recipe. It ROCKS! ;-p

Being the novice grill cook I am, (never really conquered "THE GRILL"!), I will know right where I need to go for moral support. Thank you!
