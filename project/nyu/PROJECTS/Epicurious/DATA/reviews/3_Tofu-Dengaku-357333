I believe this involves a lot more work than this similar recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Broiled-Tofu-with-Miso-em-Tofu-Dengaku-em-353652. I think the tofu itself is more flavourful due to being boiled in the dashi. I used genmai miso instead of the white. I did not use yuzu or shiso. I used Braggs aminos instead of soy sauce. And rice wine vinegar instead of the mirin and sake (I used less vinegar and added some water for the broth). It was pretty good. I love the taste of miso but it is rather salty. Please do not discard the dashi (broth). It will serve well as the broth for a miso soup (just add veggies and tofu, and some miso at the end).
