Sifting the flour really helps with lumps. Mine turned out great!

a great basic recipe I've made several times, perfect as a filling for cream puffs or cake. changing the flavor is as simple as blending in a different extract, flavored liquor or pureed fruit.

Easy, versatile and delicious. I used this for cream puff filling. This is a classic.

Easy recipe to make. If you temper the half and half as the recipe says, you shouldn't haved a problem. Whisk in a little of the milk at first and then continue to adding it. I also added a little almond extract, but thats because I like almond extract!

I followed this recipe exactly as stated and it came out beautifully. I grew up watching my mother make this often, so I didn't have any problems with tempering the eggs. for beginners - remember that a mix of patience (pour in the hot mixture slowly) & speed (whisk as fast as you can!) is key.

When tempering in the egg yolk mixture, remove the pan from the heat, gently and slowly add some of the heated mixture to the egg mixture to raise the temp. a bit, then temper into the hot mixture. Replace on the heat to begin thickening. This will stop the curdling of the cream.

A good basic pastry cream. DO NOT substitute canned milk (yuck!) for the half and half or you might as well use a boxed mix. If you have trouble w/ the mixture lumping or curdling, use a double boiler rather than direct heat. It will take much longer but it will eventually thicken and the taste will be great.

The reason you are having problems with curdling is because the recipe calls for half & half, which is does not tolerate heat very well. If you switch to evaporated milk, the results will be much better. DO NOT use condensed milk! It contains approx. 45% sugar and will not work. (Thanks to America's Test Kitchen & Cook's Illustrated.) All in all, however, with the substitution of evaporated milk for the half & half, this recipe provides a good springboard for pastry cream. But it's nothing special. The same basic recipe can be found in any cookbook.

I have tried this recipe several times and it always seems to get curdle-like. I Have kept it low and temper the mixture like it says, but never with good results!

This was my first time making any kind of cream. I found it to be a little bit lumpy, but straining the cream took care of it. I also added a bit of almond extract as well. Really kicked up the flavor!!!!!!

I haven't tried it, but I'm hoping to use it to make a strawberry cream pie. Any ideas??
