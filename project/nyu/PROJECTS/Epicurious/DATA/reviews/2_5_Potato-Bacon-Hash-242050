The simplest recipes are always the best!! Yes, as almost every reviewer has pointed out...we all make a version of this recipe...BUT let's face it. EVERYTHING is better with bacon! YUMMY pork! I love fried potatoes, with bacon and onion.....AND....ketchup. YIKES...that's right...ketchup! hahahaha....it just tastes good people..it just does!! My version is diced small so it more like a hash once it's all cooked and crispy. Delish!

This was a hit for our family. There being six of us, that's not always the case. Used about 10 slices of bacon & 4 medium russet potatoes, leaving the rest of recipe the same minus the extra 10 minute cooking time. Turned out to be just the right amount with lots of "yum, mom, this is good!"

I made this for a party of six, so I increased the ingredients and also added some fresh herbs as the potatoes cooked. I increased the cooking time, but mine never got crispy like the ones in the phone. They were still good.

To the cook from Oslo, start the pan with bacon grease at medium heat, add (dry) potattoes and onions, then slowly add 1/4c of very hot water and raise heat to high. No splatters for me. Hope this helps.

I've always made "home fried potatoes" using leftover boiled potatoes, with or without skin. The thought of adding 1/4 C water to 1T bacon fat on high heat would never have occurred to me. Just curious, has anyone actually done this without getting burnt by spatter?

Like so many of you, this recipe has been in my family for eons. But, I've taken some of the fat out. Toss potatoes and red onions in a little olive oil and s/p. Then roast in the oven 425 for about 20min. Oven roast the bacon in a sheet pan with a cookie rack in it. Then combine all ingredients together. Dice everything or leave them quartered, crumble bacon, sprinkle parsley and serve.

I thought this recipe was tasty. Not gourmet, but tasty. I think it's funny to read all the people's comments who freak out about it not needing a recipe and so on. At first it was annoying--now it's just amusing. Keep freaking out people! You guys sure take things personally...

You can buy bacon at Whole Foods that does not contain nitrates and it tastes better than any other! Also, any recipe that uses potatoes or pasta is going to have carbs, they provide energy and are necessary for your body. If you are concerned about the fat content, you can still enjoy this, just eat it in moderation.

We always called these "Home Frys" - Our family stopped using pork and so we sub in Turkey Bacon. We also use Paprika to give this dish some zest. However, we don't make this for breakfast very often. You might want to try this... When making green beans for dinner, I sometimes like to stir fry them in combination with this basic recipe: It makes a pretty good side dish.

I also have made this for years. I add extra onions and scramble a few eggs in at the end for a one pan breakfast.

Seattle, At my house we call it "Fridge trash hash." It's a recipe right up there with "Fridge trash stir-fry" and "Fridge trash risotto."

My family has made a similar recipe for years...we like to slice the red potatoes into 1/4" pieces & keep the bacon in the pan during the entire cooking process for more flavor.
