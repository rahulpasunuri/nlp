Huge hit at dinner party! I used homemade strawberry preserves instead of currant jelly which made it a bit darker but very tasty indeed!

No, no, no. Shortbread does NOT work in this scenario. Take the extra time and make shortcake!

I made these for my boyfriend and he loved them. I am making them again for a dinner party this weekend. Simple and elegant. The cookies were good by themsleves.
