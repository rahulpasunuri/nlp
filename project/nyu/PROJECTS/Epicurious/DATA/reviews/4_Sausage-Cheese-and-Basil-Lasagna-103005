Wonderful! I made no revisions, and it was fantastic. The leftovers were the best part. I did use whole milk ricotta and mozzarella, and I think that really makes it outstanding.

This was delicious! I also modified it a little according to what other reviewers said and it turned out great! I added ground sirloin to the sausage....also added queso fresco to the filling and added a can of tomato paste to the sauce. Made it for my Dad's birthday last year & it was requested again for his birthday this year.

I have been making this recipe for three years and have tinkered with it, as I'm sure many of you do. I double the sauce as noted in many other reviews. Since that makes more sauce than is necessary for a regular lasagna pan, i make extra lasagna to freeze in smaller containers for a quick meal for two. I just make extra filling and buy another package of noodles. It is my family's favorite lasagna and I always get requests for the recipe when I make it for others.

This lasagna truly warrants all 4 forks. It's flavorful, delightfully cheesy without being heavy - just perfect. I've made it three times now. The third time was by special request; a coworker had me make it for her birthday after she tried a bite of my leftovers during lunch one day and couldn't believe how good it was.

I don't care for sausage, but it is so good in this! This recipe is as good or better than lasagna I have had in any restaurant. Definitely my go to recipe. I always get rave reviews when I make this.

ps. When I made it last, I finely chopped up and added 2 slices of leftover bacon. When I made the recipe again for a potluck, leaving out the bacon, the lasagna was still good, but definitely not as great as with bacon. The bacon rounded out the flavour without being overwhelming. It seemed to have brought out the other flavors.

OUTSTANDING!! I used the pesto that I made and froze from fresh basil. Since grating the cheeses took a long time, I progressively did little steps throughout the work week before putting them all together over the weekend: definitely less exhausting. Also, I only had 15 oz of ricotta and did not feel that the recipe was lacking in cheese. From previous experience, the no-boil lasagna often came out too dry, so I added an extra 1/2 cup of water to the sauce while it was baking. Noodles came out perfect.

Rating: 4
Liked the dish okay, though everyone else thought it was wonderful. I felt that it was still a bit too dry even with additional sauce and was missing something..perhaps, a little diced carrots in the sauce would give it more depth. We made it with tomatoes from the garden, tripled the basil and added 1 cup of red wine. Will try again.

I'm no world class cook, but it's rare for me to find a recipe that I can't improve upon with a few little "personal taste" tweaks - however, I just dug into this lasagna, and I can't come up with ANY improvements. It's delicious, holds together well and comes out exactly as expected. I followed others' recommendations to double the sauce (nothing worse than a dry lasagne with no extra sauce to perk it up). I used about 2/3 of the doubled amount during preparation and have a couple of cups left over to freeze and put on gnocchi or whatever. I would recommend making the sauce the day before if you can - it was a little thin last night and might get runny if you used it right away, but it "settled in" after some overnight chilling in the fridge and was perfect. Enjoy!

Awesome lasagna. I made it for a family dinner and everyone just raved over it. As other reviewers have said, the fresh basil really makes this special. Do not leave it out. For anyone who wants to make this ahead, I made the sauce and mixed up the filling the day before and then just assembled it an hour before it went into the oven. Makes it much easier if you are entertaining with this.

This is a classic style lasagna, with some punch added by the fresh basil. Don't scrimp on the basil either, in my opinion it makes the dish.

Wow. My husband conquered a good quarter of this lasagna in under five minutes. He should've gotten a speeding ticket for how quickly he ate this dish. As far as the recipe goes, I used a whole container of fresh basil from the grocery store. I couldn't figure out how to measure "1.5 packed cups." That was really an unhelpful measurement gauge. Anyway, the lasagna is plenty basil-y enough if you use the whole container of fresh basil.

This is my second time making this recipe! I still love it! The did a couple things differently this time: I used Mild Italian CHICKEN sausage, and 12 oz of it instead of 16. The amount was by accident but ended up being plenty! I also used three layers of noodles instead of four. Oh and I dont have a mixer so I whipped the cheese up with an old fashioned wooden spoon and came out perfectly!

Wow! I'm part of the choir on this one! It's the best lasagna I've ever made! Changes (primarily to make it a little lighter & less caloric): three layers of noodles, not four, half sausage & half lean ground beef, slightly less cheese, and the mozarella & ricotta were both reduced fat. Made a lot of sauce -used fresh tomatoes from my garden (the inspiration for making lasagna). And used 14 oz. can diced tomatoes with mild green chiles instead of green peppers.

This recipe was very easy and the most delicious one my husband and I have tried in ages! We did add more sauce like everyone else seemed to do in reading their reviews. We mixed it with half beef and half italian sausage to make it less greasy and I didn't even have to drain it! It is even tastier the next day! YUM YUM. I will most definitely be adding this to my cook book of favorites!

Being italian and from the northeast, we've had a lot of lasagna. This recipe was excellent. Doubled the sauce, added another lb of chorizo chicken sausage and 2 lbs ground bison. In essence made a bolognese sauce. Added 1/2 lb of mushrooms, 2 cups chopped spinach, 2 cups chopped basil. Let the sauce cook for 1.5 hours. Rest of recipe stayed exactly the same. 4+ stars!!!

Rating: 4
Great recipe and I've used a number of different lasagna recipes. Very easy. Used a combo of sweet and spicy Italian sausage and went light on the crushed red pepper because my son doesn't really do spicy foods. I missed the reviews about increasing the sauce--will do that next time as the no boil noodles took a little longer to bake through and the lasagna was on the dry end when done. I'll increase the amount of basil and garlic next time and add mushrooms for some more texture. We loved this recipe though and it's definitely in our rotation now.

Rating: 4
I will definitely make this again. Followed the suggestions of others, and doubled the sauce. While I couldn't fit it all in the pan, I just heated the excess and served it on the side, along with Parmesan. I also used a combination of sweet, hot and pepper onion sausage, and some ground beef. It was a real hit with my company.

I substituted some of the meat instead of using all hot Italian sausage because of the spicy factor. I used 1 link of hot Italian sausage, 1 link of sweet Italian sausage and 1/2 lb. of ground sirloin. It still had plenty of flavor.

Made the recipe as directed. The dish was the specified size and was almost brimming over. It was delicious, but I would like to have had more tomato sauce in it. My husband added some on top that we had in the fridge. May use a larger pan next time and double sauce as other cooks have suggested. Otherwise, very tasty.

This is my family's favorite lasagna! I always double the sauce with "no boil" lasagna noodles, and it seems to do the trick. The most important part of this recipe is to let the lasagna sit for at least 30 minutes, or longer.

This is an excellent recipe. It isn't necessary to use a food processor in my opinion. The ingredient proportions are perfect. I add more garlic, about 10 cloves in all. I also like to use more meat (my local store sells 1 1/2 lb packages of Italian sausage anyway) and you can make cheese substitutions, but when it all comes together it is a fantastic dish.

Great Sunday dinner. Used Italian sweet sausage rather than spicy.

Rating: 4
Unbelievably good, notwithstanding the fact that i think i made some weird mistakes in terms of proportions. i eyeballed both the sauce and ricotta amounts and think i ended up with too little sauce and too much filling. there wasnt much i could do about the sauce problem, but i did throw some filling away. also, i was only able to fit three layers, and even then the pan overflowed  it actually rises while cooking, i think because of the no-boil noodles plumping up. it looked really weird going into the oven, and i feared a failure for guests (albeit good friends), but it turned out great!

Excellent recipe! The sauce is delicious and use this sauce often when I'm serving pasta or polenta. When I make this for a crowd, I never expect left overs!

Absolutely outstanding. Served this last night for a meal with friends with a simple green salad with a balsamic vinaigrette  everyone agreed that it was one of the best lasagne we'd ever tasted. I'm in the UK, and we don't have Italian Sausage over here, so I just bought 500g minced pork (ground pork) instead and mixed it with a little fennel seed. I saw some other reviewers' comments about increasing the amount of meat in this recipe but decided to stick with the original amount, and am glad I did. We all actually liked the fact this has a little higher tomato to meat ratio than your usual lasagne. Will definitely be making again and again for dinner parties etc. Well worth the effort (and really it's not that hard, it's not as if you've got to go to much effort to get a side salad together!)

My 13 year old said of all the lasagna recipes I've done, this is the BEST! It's a keeper. I made the sauce early in the afternoon and just let it simmer until I had time to finish up the rest.

I don't make lasagna much because of the time/preparation, but this lasagna deserves to be made again and again. I have a toddler, so I mix and match the spicy sausage and crushed red peppers. Sometimes I use sweet sausage with the peppers or spicy sausage and no peppers or even no peppers at all. Really depends on my mood. And, I've also added more sauce to the mixture so that there's oodles left to sop up with garlic bread at the end.

Rating: 4
This is the best lasagna have I ever taken the time to make! Instead of all hot Italian sausage, I used 1 link of hot italian sausage(from butcher, approx. 1/3 lb each) and 1 link of sweet sausage, plus 1/2 lb of ground sirloin. Instead of all ricotta cheese, I used one 15 oz container of ricotta, and 1 cup of mexican queso cheese, which gave it more texture. For the basil, I grow it in containers on my deck instead of buying it, the difference was quite apparent and I needed less. I also topped it with slices of mozzerella to give it the restaurant look that people expect.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! I add a pound of ground turkey to the sausage and mixed it with the sauce to combine a step when layering. Made for the in-laws and they loved it!! Was enough to feed 6 people and 1 toddler (with leftovers to spare!). Also added 3/4 extra moz cheese to the top. No broiler needed to get that lovely bubbling on top..the foil did the trick!

I made this for a dinner party this past Friday and all agreed this was very good. Based on other reviewers' comments I doubled the sausage (used 1 3/4 lb hot Italian 1/4 sweet) - there definitely would not have been enough meat with just one pound....but, I think next time I will use half hot Italian sausage and half ground beef. There may have been too much sausage - but ground beef would have been perfect. I also stuck with the recipe on the sauce with the exception that I added 1 can of tomato paste due to the fact others said it was watery - and voila! mine wasn't watery at all. I will make this my regular meat lasagna with the exceptions noted above.

Rating: 4
I hadn't made this recipe in a long time, forgetting that it tends to get watery. I made it today with a simple amendment to help- I drained the can of diced tomatoes before adding to the mixture. I also pureed the filling at the end and it came out perfectly (it does help to wait 20 min or longer after taking it out of the oven to serve). Also, I used 1/2 hot and 1/2 sweet sausage which made it more palatable for my kids. Truly the best lasagna recipe I've had.

Rating: 4
I recently prepared this dish on Sunday and I must say that this is the best lasagna recipes that I have ever experienced. Even my parents, both of whom abhor Ricotta cheese, ate multiple servings. Based on the reviews, the next time I will increase the amount of Ricotta and adding tomato paste would probably thicken the sauce. In spite of those issues, I will probably make this my default recipes from now on.

This was excellent - used a mixture of hot and sweet sausage, and pulsed it in the processor after browning as suggested. Then finished the sauce with the tomatoes as described. Also doubled the ricotta and used 2 eggs. Never enough cheese!

A delicious lasagna that bakes up good and fluffy! I followed the recipe per letter except for the sausage (used mild for my parents' tastes) and basil (used dried). I also used Barilla's new flat no-boil lasagna sheets, and they were perfect. I will make this my regular lasagna recipe

I've been making this lasagna for YEARS, and my family loves it. To those who asked how to keep it from getting watery: I find it gets watery if you refrigerate it before cooking. This is unfortunate as it's usually more convenient for me to assemble the night before and stick it in the fridge, but it does lead to a watery lasagna. The problem is remedied if you cook the sauce, assemble, and bake immediately (from my experience, anyway).

Delicious! I make the sauce a day ahead, the only change I make is adding more garlic (5-6 cloves). This lasagna is always a crowd pleaser!

I have made this recipe MANY times! It is my tried and true winner for lasagne. I make multiple tins at a time and put several in the freezer. However, it is always a bit runny when I serve it. Luckily, no one seems to mind it, as the flavors are truly fabulous! The basil really makes it. And I love the idea of putting the sauce in the food processor to make it a bit less chucky--especially for the first layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan. Does anyone else have trouble with it being too runny? Both the cheese and the sauce run! I'd love to know if others have this challenge. And if so, how to firm it up just a bit. Tomato paste is one option, but I'm not sure how to firm up the cheese layers. Thanks.

This is a great recipe. I had to make my pork sausage from scratch due to diet restrictions. The garlic was also minimized to the can of crushed tomatoes which were very watery so I added a can of tomato paste. I added ginger and allspice to make up for the garlic and the taste was sensational. Bonus forks for this one.

The best lasagna recipe, ever. I'm coming up on the 9th year of making this wonderful dish for Christmas Eve, and everyone looks forward to it ("Are you making THE lasagna again this year? Excellent!") Several things make this particular recipe stand out: 1. the basil - don't skimp, and in fact, I add a handful more than called for; 2. the right sausage - use a spicy sausage and use more than called for. After browning, run it through your food processor to create a fine crumble; and 3. the blend of cheeses - be sure to use all three, and use fresh mozzarella if you can. It makes a difference to both the flavor and texture of the finished lasagna. Because this dish is labor intensive, I always double up and make two. It freezes well!

Rating: 4
really delicious. instead of italian sausage, i made a mixture of fennel, red pepper, and garlic heavy ground turkey, and then used that as the base of the sauce. I also through in spinach and mushrooms. it was really delicious. one thing, i would definitely use all of that basil. i didn't quite have enough on hand for the 1.5 cups. i think the basil is in large part what distinguishes this from other recipes.

I'll preface my review by noting that our family will always miss the world's most amazing lasagna my Italian mother-in-law used to make. Eating her homemade pasta was like eating clouds! She made a light tomato sauce and used plenty of parsley mixed with her ricotta and egg filling, as well as lemon. She always served her medley of meats on the side. Having said that, this was certainly delicious. If you prefer a meat sauce, I doubt you'll beat this. I made 50% more sauce, and I did have some left, which made the leftovers perfect. I look forward to making it again next year when my basil is bursting! I did make it the night before, which was fine, but it does take quite a while to reheat.

I also added 1 cup of baby spinach to the cheese mixture and sliced baby bella mushrooms to the sauce.

This is the easiest and most delicious lasagna recipe ever. I bought bulk sausage and it is much easier than removing the casings. If you have small kids you might try mild Italian sausage but if not, spicy is great. A Cuisinart makes the prep a breeze. I have made this many times and it is always a hit. I also recommend placing a cookie sheet under the pan because it will drip. Love it!!!

The key to this recipe is the ricotta mixture. I usually make a sauce browning 2 1/2 pounds of sausage/2 onions to three 28 ounce cans of whole Italian tomatoes from Trader Joe's. Leftover sauce is fine. To these tomatoes I add 3/4 head fresh garlic cloves crushed, fennel seed, French Basil, a little thyme and white wine and simmer well. I cannot fit all cheeses with the chopped basil in my 11-cup Cuisinart, so I remove the basil and ricotta/egg to a bowl with the shredded mozz and add the parm. Mix well. There simply is not enough sauce for this recipe as written. There is, however, plenty of cheese!

I made this last night and it was amazing1 The only thing i altered was the sauce. It wasn't flavorful enough at first so I added a splash of red wine, extra garlic, extra red pepper flakes, fresh basil, herbs de provence and a handful of pancetta to spice it up a bit. That turned out great. I realize it might have had more flavorful without my alterations if i had used the directed diced peppers with green pepper and onion. However, I am a staunch opponent to the green pepper and used regular diced tomatoes. My italian fiance raved and our guest loved it. The filling was great as is and all the cheese couldn't hurt:) I might add chopped spinach sometime just to see. I will be using this recipe for a long time!!

I am NOT typically a cook, but I made this for a dinner party last week and it turned out beautifully! I freshly grated the mozzerella and used about 1.5 times as much as the recipe called for (i am a cheese freak), and I didn't have time to grab fresh basil, so I used crushed tomatoes with basil already in them. Also, I made twice the sauce and used about half the second batch on the lasagna and saved the rest for spaghetti. I used sweet sausage instead of spicy, and it was delicious. The presentation was perfect and of course, the leftovers were divine! I will definitely make this again!

My family's absolute favorite lasagna. Sometimes I make it with extra sauce, sometimes not. It turns out fantastically either way. Can't recommend this recipe enough.

I too went with the prevailing advice and doubled the sauce, and I too was glad I did. This was very good. I stuck to the recipe, with only one change, instead of 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper, I put in a whole teaspoon. We like spicy and we like red pepper. To us, it added the zip and mouth appeal we like. This was a great meal and I froze some squares to have for later meals. I defrosted the squares out of their fail wrap in a 9x9 pan and once they were fully defrosted, I put them in a 350 degree oven with some added cheese on top and a 1/4 cup of chicken stock on the bottom of the pan, and they turned out like fresh and we thought even more delicous! This is a keeper!

As with some others, I doubled the sauce recipe. I had a few cups left over, but was glad to have the extra sauce for the lasagna and some leftovers for topping pasta! I was a little concerned as the lasagna looked watery after uncovering, but the moisture absorbed nicely during the last few minutes of cooking. Great reviews from all. Make it a day ahead if you can. As always with lasagna, this was even better on day two.

I made this and was a little concerned about all the basil but I am glad that I left it in. The basil worked its magic even more the next day. I got rave reviews for this dish. The sauce is great.

This is a terrific recipe. It freezes well too. The second time I made it, I did not have fresh basil, so substituted the frozen pesto mix I keep in the freezer (2 c. basil leaves, 6 cloves garlic, 1/4 c. olive oil, 1/4 c. pine nuts). Delicious!

you can't mess this up, it's delicious. add more fresh basil to the ricotta mixture if you want to, its very subtle w/ 1.5 cups.

Plan for two lasagnas by doubling the entire recipe. Extra sauce for the moistness of this lasagna and extra white filling which I made a WHITE lasagna with. Make a white sauce and layer with chicken, mushrooms, artichoke hearts - it was fabulous! Served both and all were happy!

Rating: 4
My family and I love this recipe. I disagree with the others who suggest more sauce is needed. I like a firm, not slippery, lasagna. If you follow the directions and measure out the sauce for each layer, you'll have plenty. I generally make alterations to recipes, but find this one very good as is.

I'm getting ready to make this again -- it is a Xmas Eve tradition in our house and everyone clamors for it. I make it just as is except, as so many others have said, I double the sauce and use most of it so the dish will be moist enough. A truly delicious dish made even better by family members from near and far gathered 'round the table.

Made this for a dinner party of 25 last night. Made the recipe 5 times thinking it would serve around 6 people. Wrong!! Had 2 whole left over. Used 3/4 spicey sausage with 1/4 ground beef, and added just one more can of diced tomatoes, also pre-assembled the whole thing the night before and stored in the fridge. Over-all the dish was good and really pretty easy to make. Was hard to fit the whole thing in a 13x9 pan, did run over in the oven, thankfully I had liners to catch most of the mess.

I would make this again, however, I would half the amount of basil -- the basil taste is too powerful, and I like basil very much. I also found it a bit dry. Next time I will make/add more sauce by adding a 15 oz can of tomato sauce.

Very delicious recipe. Made for a dinner party of 7 adults and 1 five year-old. They all enjoyed it even my 5 y/o nephew (who before dinner said, "I hate lasagna!") I did not double the sauce but I did use another 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, mash the tomatoes and added the extra juices. It came out great!

I made this recipe last night for a small dinner party. I asked my friends what I should make, and one guy said lasagna was his favorite dish, so I decided to make an effort... it was my first time making lasagna of any kind... and he said this recipe was better than his mom's lasagna! When a guy says that, you know it's good! I was a little worried about all the fresh basil, so I did 3 parts basil, one part spinach. The basil was great---next time I'll leave out the spinach. You definitely need extra sauce---I used an entire can of Beritolli in addition to what the recipe made. It might also be good with a thin layer of pepporoni added.

I've made this dish a few times for friends and have followed the recommendations to add additional sauce. Not only has the final result been fabulous each time, I have become somewhat famous for this dish. Friends who have tried it tell others that I should be famous for my lasagna, it's that good! The other benefit is that you can prepare everything ahead of time so you can spend time with your guests instead of in the kitchen.

Wonderful. I made no changes to this dish, other than spliting it up into two 8X8 pans. I froze one. The cook time was about the same, even with the smaller pan. I was worried about the sauce amount, based on previous posters and the fact that I was pretty conservate with it and didn't have any left overs. However, it turned out perfect. I am actually going to make the sauce and serve over pasta tonight, it's a great sauce.

Great! I could not fit everything in the pan. (Leftover filling.) I used Boca Italian sausage and extra Olive oil to replace the animal fat. This was the best lasagna I have had. I am going to try a tofu version next. I could see doubling the Basil and adding a bit of dry red wine to the sauce. This is a great sauce even for other uses!

Rating: 3
this always turns out consistently great...i can't even imagine not using fresh basil leaves in the cheese filling! i even double it for a really intense basil flavor! if i don't have sausage i have substituted with ground beef/turkey simmered in red cooking wine...gives it a much more complex taste. in my book, with the combination of garlic, basil and red wine you can't possbily go wrong!

Excelllent crowd pleaser to make the day before a busy day. Made this for a big family dinner party the night after x-Mas, and everyone said this was best lasagne they had every had. I did double sauce and added ground beef with mild sausgae. I also added a bit of tomato sauce and parsley. Tastes better if it sits in fridge overnight.

I didn't have any basil on hand so I substituted a mix of spinach and arugula. That added a very nice little extra zing to it.

My family loved this. I did not double the sauce and thought the recipe made quite enough as written. If you use too much sauce you get a slippery lasagna and slices don't stay firm. Besides, even without the extra sauce my lasagna spilled over the sides a bit while cooking. Do be sure to put a drip pan under the baking dish to avoid messy spills.

Rating: 4
This came out great. I made this for a dinner party, and every one loved it. I'd definitely make it again. I used whole-milk ricotta and mozzarella. Out of respect for my guests' arteries, I did drain the fat from the sausage before adding the onions and spices.

Loved it. I doubled sauce as some suggested but probably only needed to increase by 50%. This amount isn't enough but 2x is a bit too much. Very good. I just chopped basil and didn't use the processor to save steps and clean up.

This recipe was DELICIOUS and a big hit with my company. Just a couple of hints: it was a tight squeeze in a 13x9 pan. I put it on a sheet so it wouldn't spill all over the oven. Also, I cooked it 15 min extra to allow noodles to become tender.

I made this lasagna last winter a few times. I've dreamed about it all summer. It really is a very easy and outstanding dish - just make sure to double the sauce!

Rating: 4
Made many of the changes suggested by reviewers which made this recipe a crowd pleaser: doubled sauce, added beef, increased the amount of filling by adding more ricotta, simmered the sauce longer and used mild Italian sausages rather than spicy. I also used regular lasagna noodles but the no-boil ones are probably fine. The one thing that I highly recommend is that when making any lasagna you should only use WHOLE MILK ricotta and mozzarella. It makes a world of difference. Lasagna is not supposed to be dietic and using part-skim or fat free ricotta makes the lasagna much less flavorful. I made the mistake once and will never do that again.

Rating: 4
Honestly, the best lasagna I have ever eaten. Made it for a dinner party and every single guest asked for the recipe. I almost doubled the basil to keep it interesting and added a half a cup of a dry red to the sauce for a little bit more depth. Delicious!

This is the best lasagna recipe ever. (However, we also love the roasted portabello lasagna recipe on this site!) I doubled the sauce, too, but don't understand why cook from Minnesota doesn't recommend no-boil lasagna? I used them, let the dish sit in the fridge a day before and it came out wonderful! You can't find a better lasagna recipe.

Rating: 4
Fabulous lasagna recipe! Made it for dinner guests, and it was delicous. I took advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce - using 1 pound beef and 1 pound spicy sausage. I had a bit extra left over to freeze. Also, my advice with the noodles is to use regular lasagna noodles, NOT the no boil kind. Make the lasagna a day before so it can sit for a day. I've always done this - it's easy and better than no boil.

Rating: 4
This dish turned out wonderfully! I followed previous cooks' reccomendations and doubled the sauce. I am also a vegetarian, so I used Boca Burger's ground 'beef' and a couple of Boca Burger's Italian 'sausage' in place of the meat. All my guests were non vegetarians, but they loved it. Definitely a keeper! I know this will be a hit whenever I make it.

This is my family's favorite lasagne. I generally make more sauce and fill 2 9x9 pans. I freeze one pan, without the cheese topping to use within a few months. I defrost the lasagne, and adding the cheese topping immediately before cooking. This makes the work of fixing it the first time easier knowing I have a second quick and easy meal in the future.

Based on earlier comments, I went to meatloaf mix (ground veal, beef, pork) rather than sausage, and used 2-28oz cans tomatoes rather than 1-28 and 1-14. It turned out very very good. No problems at all with the no-boil noodles.

I was expecting the greatest lasagne ever, so I was a little disappointed. Even with the hot Italian sausage and the fresh basil, it wasn't very flavorful, although it definitely improved the second day. This was the first time I'd ever used non-cook lasagne noodles, and I'm not sure I'd do it again--the heavy pasta overwhelmed the sauce.

This recipe is one of my favorites for easy casual entertaining. I too would suggest simmering the sauce to enhance the flavor and generally let it sit for 1 day. In addition, I would suggest adding a can of pesto to the ricotta cheese in place of the fresh basil as this makes it easier and adds a new demension. FAMILY FAVORITE!

Rating: 4
This dish was excellent!! I teamed it up with a garlic bread recipe also from Epicurious, what a meal it made. Quite filling, definitely a winner in my kitchen. I must agree with the previous cook on substituting the sauce w/ 1/2 grd beef & 1/2 sausage. It'll definitely cut down on the richness of the flavor. I also used fat-free ricotta for the filling, but did not blend everything together. Instead, I mixed the filling ingredients & used the chunky material as is, as I was building the layers up. Next time, I'll definitely will use a smaller dish. I seemed to run out of the sauce. I did use the no-boil noodles (mainly out of pure laziness), didn't seem to find that the dish was overtly dry from not enough sauce. Actually, I think it came out quite well. It's great as leftovers & surprised my boyfriend that the dish came out so well. Recipe's definitely a keeper!!

Rating: 3
I liked this lasagne because, as other reviewers pointed out, it stays so well together when plated. Not so quick, but that's okay too. It was a little rich for us, but very very good. Next time I make this, I'll use a bit less of the basil, substitute fat-free ricotta for some of the part-skim and maybe go 50% ground beef/50% hot italian sausage. None of this for caloric content, but rather for cutting down on the really rich flavors. In summary, though, this was simply a very good lasagne recipe to start with: I'd recommend making it as-written the first time, and then alter to suit your family's taste if necessary.

This was my first attempt at making lasagna and it was delicious. My boyfriend and family loved it. I added mushrooms and more garlic to the sauce. I also went ahead and used fresh noodles instead of the no-bake kind. They tend to taste rubbery. I also mixed in some chopped fresh basil with the mozzerela and parm cheeses for some added kick.

Rating: 4
This is an awesome recipe; I made this for my group of catty friends. They loved it, and now have let me off the hook for my lentil soup disaster. I used fresh noodles, instead of no-cock. Dried noodles make lasagna feeling rubbery. Once you use fresh noodles you will never want to use the others again. After reading other reviews, I took heed and tripled the sauce and doubled the cheese, used a 15 x 10 pan, and let it sit over night. I used half fresh Italian sausage and half fennel sausage this added an extra dimension and soften the flavor of the spicy Italian.

Yummm, this was a delicious lasagna and pretty easy to make too! I halved it, except for the sauce part, since I didn't need to make so much. It was just right. I couldn't find the tomatoes with onions and green peppers, so I used tomatoes with roasted red peppers instead. I also omitted the red pepper flakes, because I was afraid it would be too spicy with the hot sausage. I probably used more cheese on top than I should of. My husband really liked it! Served with salad and Semolina bread, it was great, a real keeper!

I doubled the sauce recipe, used 1/2 spicy turkey sausage, 1/2 pork spicy sausage, and could not get fresh basil, so I used good quality jarred pesto. I also made 2 8x8 pan lasagnas instead of one larger (there are only 3 of us, and this is what I usually do with lasagna, eat one, freeze one). This was not very good at all. I may throw out the one that is still in the freezer, instead of trying to get it eaten. It actually may just become very expensive dog food.

This is delicious!!! My husband and I both love it. The fresh basil adds so much flavor to the filling. Definitely add more tomatoes to the sauce as others recommend, and I add an add'l clove of garlic. I wouldn't normally recommend using pregrated cheese since it has plastic in it, but it would make this recipe MUCH easier, since it calls for so much cheese. I use some romano cheese in place of parmesan -adds big flavor, so you don't need as much cheese.

Great lasagne recipe. Got raves from my Italian family. I used two cans of crushed tomatoes instead of diced and cooked the sauce for about 25 minutes to give it more taste. The only change I would make is I wouldn't use the "no boil" lasagne again. It was the first time I used the "no boil" and I thought the noodles were a little tough around the edges. The old fashioned kind I think are alot better.

My family loved this too, as I was generous enough to give them all a bite. Four forks!

This is a fantastic lasagna! Everyone went nuts for it and asked for the recipe! I have used the no boil pasta before and hated it so I was concerned about using it with this recipe but it turned out perfect!!! The pasta was paper thin and not so thick and starchy like most lasagna noodles. Instead of the different cans of tomatoes, I just used 2-28oz cans of high quality organic crushed tomatoes with basil. I cannot imagine using less sauce as I think it would be too dry. I also added more garlic. A wonderful recipe!!! Throw the other lasagna recipes away.

We hardly ever give 4 forks but this is absolutely the best!!! Sooo tasty - for once I am at a loss for words!

I am tyically disappointed with most lasagnas, either put off by the excessive cheese or the boring sauces; however, after reading various reviews I utilized this recipe with a few additions. I added a bag of baby spinach, uncooked to the ricotta/mozzarella/egg mix. Also I added a half cup of chopped carrots to the sauce, along with 2 tsp brown sugar. I did not add any parmesan, followed the filling amounts exactly and topped the final layer with only 2 oz. When it came to assembling the final product, I discovered I only had enough noodles for 3 layers which was more than adequate. Was outstanding.

This recipe is superb and I have made it numerouse times - all to rave reviews, even by some pretty terrific cooks.

I think this is the first time that I've used no-boil lasagna noodles where I was happy with the results. This was absolutely delicious, and even better the next day. My kids are big fans of lasagna and said it's the best they've had, even in restaurants. I think it's the basil that makes it so great. I used 1/2 sweet and 1/2 spicy sausage, and also added a little red wine to the ragu. Also lots of garlic. Yum! Will make again soon.

Tastes great. Can serve 6-8 people if you're serving it with other side dishes.

I figured it doesn't matter since it all melts anyway.

I thought this was the perfect recipe for classic sausage lasagna, it's just deeeelish. Everyone loved it. I also ran out of sauce the first time I made it, but it was still excellent. Second time I made it, I made more sauce, which was nice to have for warmed up leftovers. This is now the first lasagna recipe I'll use, no need to look further. Gotta love those no-boil noodles too, what a time-saver! And they come out so perfectly.

Instead of using the extra ricotta from the second container (I never get around to using the remainder and it always goes bad on me) I used a small pack of chevre. In addition, I gave the sauce a bit more body by adding some dry red wine and diced carrots. The result was very nice.

I made this dish for two different dinner parties and had a lot of success. I did not need extra sauce at all, I think it is important not to cook the sauce too much longer than it says. I cooked it for about 10 minutes, then I let it sit all day. The lasagna was rich and very flavourful and everyone enjoyed it.

I made this lasagna for friends we had for dinner one night and they loved it! I think extra sauce is necessary if you have a large lasagna baking dish or if your family prefers to have a little extra to serve on the side. Also, the fresh basil makes a significant difference in the flavor. This is a great recipe.

Rating: 3
This got great reviews from guests. I used fresh basil in 1 batch and dried in another, couldn't tell difference. I also used 1/2 hamburger 1/2 sausage. I also double meat sauce because any leftover can be frozen and is great on spagetti. Just add some tomato paste when reheating to thicken.

Rating: 4
The best lasagna recipe ever!!! The key is to use an Italian (unfortunately NOT American) pasta for the lasagna- I used Barilla no-bake/oven ready lasagna, and I have never tasted a lasagna pasta like that in my life. The sheets are very thin, but hold together great and cook very well- they do not get gummy like most American pastas. I also added another 14 oz can of diced tomatoes in order to have enough sauce. I really can't say enough about how great this was- my husband said it was the best lasagna he has ever had and I agree!

Rating: 3
I agree with the last review that extra sauce would make it impossible to fit in the pan. As it was, I had cheese and sauce running over the edge and making a mess in my oven. My lasagna turned out excellent. The only change I made was to triple the garlic-you can never have enough garlic. For those reviewers reporting poor results, I would stress the use of quality ingredients. Go to the nearest Italian deli and get good sausage, cheese, and basil. Cheap italian sausage alone could ruin this recipe.

Rating: 2
After reading the reviews, I almost doubled the sauce and am so glad I did not do it--there was more than enough sauce. Had I made more, it wouldn't have fit in the 9 by 13 pan. Having said that, I thought this recipe was good, but I did not love it like other reviews indicated.

My absolute favorite lasagna recipe! I always double the recipe and freeze some, as my family requests this one often. It's even better re-heated.

This lasagna was good but I don't think it was good enough to write home about it?!? Everyone enjoyed the dish and all of it was gone in a couple of days (a good leftover dish). I think I would puree the tomatoes next time, as I wasn't a big fan of the tomato chunks. I too used only 15 oz. of Ricotta, which was enough and yes, you need to use the exact amount of sauce for the layering or you could run out.

Rating: 4
Agree with other reviewers - excellent lasagna recipe! Tips I can add are: Don't simmer the sauce too long - it's OK to have it on the watery side so that the noodles will cook and absorb the liquid. I also kept to a strict 1 1/4 c. of sauce per layer and was able to avoid running out of sauce. As far as the basil, the recipe does state that it should be 1 1/2 c. packed, so make sure you pack it down when measuring. It was also on the salty side for me, so I'll be sure to add less salt to the sauce and filling next time.

Great lasagna recipe. I added more diced tomatoes to get more sauce. I use hot Italian sausages but some varieties are extra hot so I don't bother adding the red pepper.

My husband loves lasagna and this is the only recipe we use now. I use one 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and one 28 oz can of regular diced tomatoes without the peppers and onions, not drained, for the sauce. I don't eat pork so I use lean ground beef. If I can find beef sausage, I'd really like to try it in this recipe. I use only one container of the ricotta and half of the cheese when assembling as suggested by other reviewers and it's wonderful. The proportion of the basil in the recipe is a must. I've made it with less and it doesn't taste as good. Very easy recipe.

Excellent recipe. My boyfriend, an Italian who makes his own pasta, loved it more than his mother's recipe. Who knows, maybe he was sucking up. It worked, though! Good for company, easy to prepare in advance. I would definitely use hot Italian sausage. My BF made pasta for this dish, but the layers melded too much. Use the dried no boil stuff - less work, better outcome. For even better flavor, use fresh tomatoes in season and roast them on the grill. The smoky flavor really is good.

Awesome lasagna...the best I've ever had! We are vegetarians so I used Gimme Lean fake sausage. To cut down on fat, I used less mozzarella cheese and no parmesan cheese and it was definitely cheesy enough. I also used half ricotta cheese and half cottage cheese.

I doubled this and baked it in an extra large 12 x 17 x 3 inch pan for a party of 20. It filled the pan right to the top and turned out great - bubbly, browned, and delicious. Beware though, I ran out of sauce for the top layer and resorted to bottled sauce - you can't make too much sauce. I used Aidell's garlic and artichoke sausage and I thought the artichokes in the sausage added a nice touch - they separated from the sausage and bulked up the sauce a bit.

This is my family's favorite dish. I like it better than any other lasagna I've tried. I now make extra sauce and split the recipe into 2 9 inch sqaure casseroles. We freeze the extra casserole for another day. I always serve it with fresh ciabatta and a green salad.

This was my first time making lasagna and I have to say that this recipe made it really easy. I only did three layers because I kept mis-measuring everything, but it turned out well in the end. I doubled everything in the sauce and added 1lb of mushrooms that I minced in my food processor and 4 tbsp of brown sugar. It was sweet and spicey...perfect combo. We can't find fresh basil in this town round now, so I had to use dehydrated...and I used alot. All in all a great recipe that I will use again and again. Good thing because I have enough sauce leftover to feed the NFL.

I have made this a few times and find it great with diced beef instead of sausage. I also add sliced black olives & sliced sundried tomatoes to the sauce. If fresh basil is hard to obtain, I use fresh blend basil & garlic in a jar. I find this gives it a great flavor and can be mixed through instead of using a blender. One of my favourite recipies!!

This is very good. The meat sauce is not alot, but it worked. The cheese mixture also didn't cover all very well, but the finished product baked together nicely and was enjoyed by all!

This was very good and my guests enjoyed it, but "the best I've ever had"...? No, hardly. It's quick and easy because of the no-boil noodles, but I think that they alone are what make it that way. Wouldn't pretty much any lasagna recipe be made easier with the no-boil noodles? It's good. If you want a basic lasagna that would be hard to find fault with, this is it.

Rating: 4
This was the tastiest lasagna I've ever had. I found it easy to make as well. The fresh basil in the cheese mixture just makes this recipe special. I made the sauce as described in recipe but used only half amounts for cheese filling and it turned out great - not too heavy. It could have perhaps used just a half recipe more sauce but I think one 15 oz container of ricotta is perfect. Reheats beautifully. Great entertaining dish.

I made this for my friend's birthday party and everyone just loved it! One friend said that it was better than any lasagna he'd eaten at restaurants. I doubled the amount of sauce as advised, using 2-28 oz cans of peeled whole plum tomatoes in sauce from Trader Joe's. I just chopped them up and crushed it all in a big bowl with a potato masher. Also substituted the diced tomatoes with Rotel milder diced tomatoes as suggested by a previous reviewer since I had some already in my pantry. I actually let the sauce simmer for 30 minutes on low and ended up with just enough to put the lasagna together. I only used 1 cup of basil and didn't bother adding the extra cup of ricotta. It was my first time making lasagna and it turned out very well!

I made this for dinner last night for my husband and I and we both loved it. After reading all the reviews I made some revisions to the recipe that I was pleased with. Most importantly I made 3 layers instead of 4. I reduced the ingredients in the filling - less 1 cup ricotta, 1 1/4 C basil, 5 oz. mozzarella, 2/3 cup parmesan. I made a full recipe of sauce using spicy Italian turkey sausage, extra onions, doubled the garlic. I had to supplement the sauce with leftover spaghetti sauce from my freezer so next time I will make at least 1 1/2 X. The result was less heavy, perfect consistency, golden brown and delicious.

For the amount of work this takes, I was expecting something spectacular. The dish was good, but not overwhelmingly so. I've made better lasagna using sauce from a jar. I think lightening up on the basil would help.

This is a very good lasagne recipe. I did add and omit some seasoning to make it to my guests liking. But the basic recipe was the same and the lasagne had a great creamy consistency yet held together nicely. I followed the other reviewers' advice and doubled the sauce, I had a some left over (after doubling) but served it on the side.

Although it's time consuming to put together (most lasagna dishes are) it was well worth the work! I served this about a month ago at a 14 person dinner party and it was an absolute hit! Everyone raved about it, had seconds and asked for the recipe! I'm making it again for a small Christmas Eve family get-together. EXCELLENT!!

Rating: 4
I made this exactly as stated in the recipe and it was so delicious and flavorful! I didn't double the sauce and I don't see why other reviewers felt the need to. However, it could be that I just dislike soupy lasagna. This one had a good sauce to cheese balance and it sets up beautifully on the plate. I loved the spicy sausage also-- it gave the dish such a great flavor. Next time I would probably cut down on the cheese or use skim cheeses (the thought of all that fat and cholesterol just kills me) and I would increase the basil since I'm a big fan of fresh basil. Since other reviewers have had good experience with turkey sausage I'd try that too, just to make it healthier in any way possible. I can't wait to make this again for a group!

I used two packages (about 4 cups) of frozen homemade meat sauce(with mushrooms) for the sauce, followed the recipe (sort of) faithfully for the filling (substituted a package of flat Italian parsley for the basil) and was really generous with the cheese. BE CAREFUL! This amount will NOT fit in a 9x13in pan! I got it to the point of adding the final cheese layer and went and got my 10x15 inch, sprayed it, put it over the one I had together, looped it, and all was right with the world. It was a beautiful thing.

Although I gave this three forks, my whole family gives it a four forker. I used the no boil noodles and fresh Italian bulk sausage from a local vendor. I like basil, so I upped the ante there. My only gripe was that it was a bit flat presentation-wise, but my mom loved that it wasn't so heavy with layers and layers. Better than some, and definitely easier than most...

I thought this was just average. My family liked it, but I thought the ricotta was too heavy, drowning out all other flavors. (And I only used a 15oz tub. I can't imagine using the recommended amount). Some modifications: I used an extra can of diced tomatoes, and it just seemed like enough sauce. The brand of lasagne I bought was too short for the pan, so I added one extra noodle per layer to compenstate. I much prefer the recipe for lasagne in the cookbook "The Best Recipe", written by the people at Cook's Illustrated magazine. Check it out if you get the chance.

The first time I made this lasagna, it was verbatum and I liked it. However, the rest of my family prefers the sauce to the cheese and now I only use a 15 oz. container of ricotta and 1/3 less cheese in the spread and 1/3 less in the sprinkled cheese. I often use a can of diced tomatoes rather than one with gr.peppers and onions and chop extra onion for sauteeing. One to 2 cups of grated carrots add a little sweetness for balance. This is an easy lasagna, as advertised

This is a winner! My husband is not a lasagne lover but he really liked this one, I think the sausage really makes a difference. I made a full recipe but divided it between two 8x8 inch pans, cooked one and froze one. We ate the frozen one this week and it was as good as fresh.

I hate reading the reviews here by people who change important ingredients and then trash the recipe. Well, I wanted to make this dish, didn't have a car that day, and had to work with the ingredients I had. I used half hot turkey Italian sausages and half sweet. Substituted a can of Rotel milder tomatos and peppers for the tomatoes with onions and peppers, and had no fresh basil so used an entire container of Buitoni pesto. Left out the red peppers because I used the Rotel. Then . . . I put it together in the wrong order. (Haste makes waste.) Know what? It was wonderful! We loved it. I will do it the proper way next time, however. I loved how fast it was to put together (compared to my 3 hour sauce) and it was delicious!!!

This is a very good lasagna recipe. I didn't have any fresh basil so I stirred in a few teaspoons of purchased pesto--added a nice flavor. Also, I cut down on the cheese a bit. Used about 4 cups mozzarella total and 1 cup parmesan. One container of ricotta was enough. Put the cheese for the topping on when you uncover it and you won't have to worry about it sticking to the foil.

I've made this recipe 5 times including a meatless version, which was still fabulous. It's a ton of basil, but I think it's what makes this recipe a standout.

This is, without a doubt, THE best lasagne that I have ever tasted! I've made it many times over the past year and never changed any part of the recipe. Everytime I make it for company everyone asks for the recipe and there are never any leftovers. The no-boil noodles really add structure and keep the lasagne from getting too "soupy". And the fresh basil is an absolute must - it's the one flavor that really separates this from any other lasagne. If you like lasagne -- this is the recipe to try!

To Madison, let me get this straight. You substituted the 12 strips of no-cook lasagna for spinach leaves to make a healthier, less fattening version of this Lasagna? Then you consume a total of 1 pound of greasy Italian sausages, 23 oz. of Ricotta cheese, 4-1/2 cups of Mozzarella cheese, and 1-3/4 cups of Parmesan cheese! And the noodles are bad for your health?! Oh, my!

This was great on a cold night but tasted even better as a leftover. In the future, I want to make a few days ahead for the sauce to have that chance to mature. Also, my kids not only liked this dish, my 10 year old had picked this out from the site - he wasn't disappointed!

I made this for a friend's birthday party and everyone *loved* it--many even asked me for the recipe. I made it exactly according to the recipe, and found it perfect. Not too dry at all, nor was it too much (or too little) for a standard Pyrex 13x9x2 pan. I reheated a piece for myself two days later (in the toaster oven, not the microwave) and thought it tasted even more fabulous than the night I served it. Will definitely make this again.

Very good lasagna. I substituted hot italian lean turkey sausage instead of beef, maybe that was a mistake.

All in all, we really enjoyed it, will make it again using beef sausage.

The best lasagna ever!!! Thought it was just okay the first time I made it, but the second time I made some adjustments to bring it up to a 4-fork rating. Substituted 2 cups of crushed fresh tomatoes (1 c. vine-ripened, 1 c. roma) for the diced tomatoes w/green pepper & onion. Added 1 lb. 4% fat ground beef, 1 c. sun dried tomatoes, 1/4 c. Trader Joe's pesto, and 2 tbls of brown sugar to sauce. I really like Frigo's whole milk ricotta for filling. I allowed the sauce and the filling to chill overnight. Mama Mia!!!

I made this lasagna for a dinner party and it was absolutely delicious. I used conventional lasagna and made it the night before the dinner, cooked it for 45 minutes the evening of the party and let it rest for 15 minutes before serving it.

I thought this was one of the best lasagnas I've ever tasted. As one other cook mentioned, I thought, too, that the basil would be too strong--it was perfect. I couldn't fit three layers (mine didn't fit in a standard 2" high dish. An easier way of making sure you have enough filling is to use 1/3 of the filling if you plan to have 3 layers or 1/2 the filling for 2 layers (rather than measuring by cups). I used 1-15oz ricotta container and I thought that was perfect, no need for that extra 1 cup). I used the "Pomi" brand box tomato from Italy (a cook suggested) and thought it was FANTASTIC! (found in a box container near your canned tomatoes). Also added 1 small can diced tomatoes w/ pepper & onions and one 15 oz can tomato puree. Ended up with just the right amount of sauce.

Tasty lasagne. I used sweet italian sausage because I was preparing this for family who aren't spice tolerant. Next time, I'll make it spicy because I think it's probably better that way. Also, I ran out of sauce and had to top with some marinara out of a jar. Will also cut down on ricotta next time--15 oz container is sufficient I think.

I really loved this lasagna. It's the best one I've ever made and not only did I love it my family loved it too. I made two thinking one wouldn't be enough for everyone that was coming over (about 9 people! some having two slices) and ended up giving a whole lasagna to our next door neighbors. Tey came over the next day and raved about it. I ended up skipping the basil and upping the amount of crushed red pepper because I love spicy and my family didn't even notice. A definate make again!

This is a fantastic lasagna recipe! The only thing I would change next time is to make more of the tomato sauce. I could have used at least 1/2 as much more. I would probably double the sauce and save what I didn't use in the lasagna, for topping some pasta. It's delicious! I used fresh sheets of pasta and cooked them ahead. I also used "Pomi" chopped tomatoes. If you can find them, you'll never use canned again. They come in a box and are from Italy- look for them near all the cans.. Everyone loved it. Mixing the fresh basil in with the cheeses took it way beyond the usual when savoring each bite! Don't look any farther for a great lasagna!

Everyone I have served this to says that this is the best lasagna they have ever tasted. Pretty straightforward/easy for lasagna, especially like the no-boil noodles.

I made the recipie, following the measurements loosely, adding more basil to the cheese and a 1/2 cup more tomato to the sauce. I also pre-cooked the noodles, a habit I can't get away from.

I made this lasagna last night. It is delicious. I followed the recipe to the t. I did not have enough of the filling to go 3 layers, only 2 layers. Also, I found the top layer of noodles was a little dry. I didn't have enough sauce to cover the entire top layer of noodles. I think the next time I make I will save more of the sauce to add on top (cover noodles) and add a little more mozarella. I will definitely make this again.

This is an excellent lasagna recipe. I mixed spicy and non spicy sausage. I'm making it again and here are my tips on the sauce. Since the sauce on the bottom is not very important (in my opinion) I pour a thin layer of tomatoe sauce on the bottom, sprinkled over some pizza seasoning, then continued with the recipe. I had plenty of filling in doing this. Also, I will add more mozrella to the filling and less ricotta so it will be a thicker filling. I'm making it again this week, my previous guests took home the remainder. Its excellent!

I made this recipe a couple of nights ago and my husband and I enjoyed it but I felt it was a little dry. The flavor was great though we are not accustomed to red pepper in our lasagna. Anyway tonight we had it again as it makes a large amount. It was better the second time. We have put one third in the freezer for a busy evening. Tonight my husband said it was his favorite recipe for lasagna. I loved it because it is very easy to make. Will definately make again, next time for guests.

This was OK, but not spectacular. The wonderful basil flavors faded with cooking, and then seemed overpowered by the red pepper. Also, my sausage turned unpleasantly chewy, perhaps because the whole thing had to cook so long. Avoided the sauce shortage issue by adding an extra can of crushed tomatoes. Even had enough sauce left over to ladle a few spoonfuls onto my guests' portions.

Excellent recipe! Took reviewers advice and doubled the sauce. I lowered the sodium content by using salt free canned tomatoes and deleted the salt from filling --- was still delicious. Used Barilla no cook noodles and thought they were excellent, much lighter than regular noodles. Will definitely use this recipe from now on!

Substituted hamburger for the sausage, didn't use the red pepper and it turned out fine. I followed the sauce directions to the letter, and I came out with the right amount of sauce--any more would have been too much, especially for the size of the pan. A good recipe, nothing really extraordinary.

Although I thought the lasagna was too greasy, my husband really, really liked it. I would therefore make it again.

I followed the suggestions of reviewers and doubled the sauce; single batch of sauce would not have been enough. On the advise of one reviewr, I didn't put the salt in; it still tasted salty. I thought it was too rich - and will go back to my old standby the Good Housekeeping. recipe.

This was an excellent lasagna, however, mine came out a bit salty. I'm not sure why, since I only added the salt that the recipe asked for. Maybe it was the tomato puree or canned tomato. Next time, I'll try using the low sodium or no salt added tomatoes. I love the "no boil" noodles- it's so much simpler.

Loved this recipe! This is the best lasagna I have ever made. I did not use as much fresh basil as it calls for and thought it was plenty. It was a big hit and I intend to make this again and again

Rating: 3
Very good recipe and I will make again. I used no cook noodles, so I added another 8 oz. of tomato sauce. Next time I will use regular noodles but will still add the additional tomato sauce. I might add that leftovers freeze well and seem to taste better the second time around

It took me forever to remember which issue this recipe was in since I made it before. I wish I had looked here first. I would have had the sauce hint ahead of time. I definitely agree more sauce was needed. Even without this was an absolute hit! I think between 2 people it lasted 3 days in my house. Very simple to prepare and plates up great. I use half ground beef because my boyfriend does not want that much sausage. I will never use another lasagna recipe again I will just make variations with this recipe. Great lasagna

I made this over the weekend. I took other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce. I have two comments regarding the filling. I hate using a partial container of anything since it generally gets forgotten and spoils and couldn't really imagine that 7 more ozs. of ricotta would hurt the recipe. So, I used 2 15 oz. containers instead of the 1 plus 1 cup called for, and then increased the mozzarella from 6 to 8 oz. Also, I don't understand the necessity of using the food processer to mix the filling. I don't have a full sized one so it would have been more time consuming to begin with, but it was very easy to chop the basil with a sharp knife and then mix everthing in a bowl. The mixing bowl and sharp knife are alot easier to clean than a food processor bowl! It came out great, my husband and I loved it,and we shared two large pieces with my neighbors who said they loved it too and they are both from Italian families who know how to cook! I will definitely make this again. We're eating the leftovers tonight!

I tried this recipe with Vegetarian Italian sausage and it was amazing. No one could tell!!Take all the other advice though and make extra sauce!!

Great lasagna! I never really cared for lasagna but this recipe is terrific. I made it the second time (triple recipe) for a crowd of 30...should have made more because I ran out. Will definitely make it again!

Delicious - the combination of spicy sausage and basil are the key!!!

Rating: 4
Delicious! Even my friend, who claimed she hated lasagna because she didn't like ricotta cheese, cleaned her plate without a single complaint (that's saying a lot!). The spicy Italian sausage and the fresh basil went really well together. I'm just sorry I didn't listen to the other reviewers and make extra sauce, because I, too, ran short.

This is a great lasagne recipe. Everyone I've made it for has asked me for the recipe. It's great to freeze and have on hand for a quick meal. The fresh basil makes it!

I've never made a lasagna so delicious before! I will never go back to what I used to make! NEVER!

I've tried many lasagne recipes, but this one is THE best. Definitely use fresh basil -- I've made it with dried basil, and it tasted terrible. I use 1 lb. of Hot Italian sausage and make two 8x8" servings; freeze one or give to a friend.

This dish was a very tasty version of lasagna which we prefer! We did need to follow the suggestion to make more sauce. This recipe is a keeper!

I'd always been put off by the idea of making lasagna, since it seemed so involved. This recipe changed my mind. It's easy to do and the results are superb. This is definitely one to make again.

Since I have just spent 1+ hours looking for this recipe again (couldn't remember which cooking magazine it was in) - it is obviously the best lasagne recipe I have ever tried. The sauce is the best and can be used for other pasta recipes

Rating: 3
This is my new lasagna recipe. Simple to make, looks great, and absolutely delicious. Agree with other reviews, always add little extra sauce, as the no-cook noodles absorb moisture.

This is the best lagasna recipe I have ever made. Even my husband, who dislikes anything with ricotta cheese, loved it. I use a roll of Jimmy Dean spicy sausage. Delicious!

This is a terrific lasagne recipe. We make it without the sausage for vegetarian friends, and it's still wonderful. In fact, the sauce without the sausage is now ourpasta marinara sauce of choice.

Rating: 4
Excellent, a really great change from the regular lasagna. Full of flavor and very satisfying.

Rating: 3
This recipe turned out great - it's one of the first lasagnas I've made that hasn't fallen apart when plating. My 8oz. package of noodles only had 9, so I had to adjust amounts in the layers. I used hot sausage and lots of red pepper and loved it - but would use more than 1 lb. of sausage next time.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe twice now - the first time it took forever to prepare, but the second time it went much more smoothly. I did a few things differently: I cooked the sausage separately so I could drain the fat, then I added it to the onion, garlic and tomato mixture. Also, I used an extra 15-oz. can of tomatoes because I didn't feel there was enough sauce. Finally, the San Giorgio brand of no-cook lasagna fits the pan better than other brands. Overall, I think this is a really great recipe and it got rave reviews both times I made it!

Rating: 4
We LOVED this recipe. I used mild Italian sausage and more basil than called for. Also used fresh lasagne sheets. Next time I will make about 1.5 times the sauce, as I nearly ran out. This is definitely a keeper and since we enjoyed it so much, we are planning a dinner party just so we can try it again soon. (Oh, turkey sausage was all that was available, and it was just fine.)

Rating: 3
Added fresh basil in the sauce instead of the filling so that it won't be so overpowering...even though I love basil.

Rating: 3
Yum! Unfortunately, I only had dried basil, and my conversion chart called for 1 tsp. of dried herbs per tbsp. of fresh- which I ended up halving. Also cut down on the garlic. But I doubled the chopped onion, threw in some sliced mushrooms as well, and used grated Romano instead of Parmesan. Nothing too radical- but then, do you really want your lasagna to be radical?

Rating: 2
This was not really as quick as promised. The lasagna was O.K. I prefer sliced sausage tucked into the layers. Also I missed the taste of the parsley mixed with the cheese. The basil was just too much. Next time I will make my traditional lasagna and substitute the no-boil noodles

Rating: 4
This was delicious and very esy to make. I have always hated making lasagna, but this one has changed my mind and I will use this recipe again.

I used mild Italian turkey sausage, omitted the crushed red papper and used only 1 bunch of basil. I've passed this along to my co-workers.

Rating: 4
My husband is no big fan of Italian food but we both loved this. I made double the sauce and froze the extra; I agree w/some other reviewers that a single batch of sauce might not be quite enough. E-mailed this recipe to 3 friends, which I have never done with another recipe.

This is very, very good lasagna. I followed the recipe exactly and felt it had enough sauce as it was--depends on what you like I guess! Very good the next day as leftovers. This has become "the lasagna recipe" in our house.

This received rave reviews from guests and took less time than other recipes. The basil really made it special.

Rating: 3
This was really delicious and easy. I made the full recipe and did run out of sauce by the time I got to the top layer. I just added some more plain crushed tomatoes, but this made it almost overflow the pan. Next time I will either be more careful not to use too much sauce in the early layers or I will make extra sauce and make this in a bigger pan. Also, I recommend the 'Barilla' brand no-boil lasagna noodles because these are flat (not crinkled) which makes it easier to spread the filling on. Even though I had a little glitch w/the recipe, I will definitely make this again. This is one of the most flavorful lasagnas I have ever had. Do I dare say, even better than mom's. ;->

My favorite lasagna is the 4-cheese one in Bon Appetit but it takes a long time. This one really cut down on the time and was delicious. It took me less than an hour to prepare. My no boil noodles curled up when I put the sauce on them. Next time I will cool the sauce in the fridge before using it.

This is a keeper. Great the next day.

My husband and I loved this. Easy and relatively quick to assemble. Reheated well in the microwave forleftovers. I made a 9 X 9 dish and cut down on the filling (omitted the extra cup of ricotta and used less of the cheeses) and used 8 noodles (for 4 layers). I did make the full amount of sauce, however, using spicy turkey sausage as a substitute. I would increase the sauce ingredients if making a 9 X 13 dish.

Rating: 3
My husband loves basil so I am always looking for new recipes with basil. We both loved this lasagna and I can't wait to make it again. Next time I will double the sauce since it seemed I was a little short. The left over sauce can always be frozen and used to top pasta for another meal.

I made this and three other recipes from the site for my parents over Spring Break. This was their favorite, even over the Filet Mignon. They gave it a "10+", and can't wait until I come home to make it again.

DELICIOUS! As usual we doubled the garlic. The fresh basil is a must and just wonderful. We made everything one day before, put the sauce and cheese layer separately in the fridge, put it together the next day and baked. Best lasagna we've had to date.

I made this lasagna (2) for my daughter's 18th surprise birthday party (20+ guests) because I wanted something fast and easy and it was a hit. Everyone loved it. I've made it again since and once again, everyone loved it. I couldn't believe how good it tasted with very little time and effort.

Epicurious reviewers came through for me again. They weren't kidding when they said this was delicious lasagna! The hot sausage and fresh basil flavors played off of each other wonderfully. Are there really no-boil noodles? At the advise of other reviewers I used plain old lasagna noodles and it turned out great.

I had all my girfriends over for dinner and they all raved about this lasagna. What is amazing about this is that they are all "World traveling Foodies"!! I think I would add some fresh or frozen spinach to one of the layers for texture and color. Just goes to show that sometimes old standbys are the way to go. I served a nice salad and good red wine. YUM.

It is the best lasagna recipe I've ever tasted. However, for colour, I added one regular sized can (16 oz?) of cooked spinache to the ricotta mixture.

My husband and I loved this! He ate 3 helpings! I used spicy Italian turkey sausages and they were great. This recipe was described in the magazine as "Lasagna in One Hour." It took considerably longer from start to finish, but it was definitely worth it. This was the first time I ever used no-boil noodles. They are the greatest invention since sliced bread!

I thought this recipe was quite good, especially for fussy eaters like my husband. He's not especially fond of vegetables ( help! ). I added about 1/2 cup of wine to the sauce to give it some pizzaz, as well as some salt. I made it a full day in advance and cooked it before serving. It turned out very well.

Very tasty, but what's so quick about it? To me, boiling the noodles is the last thing that worries me about kitchen time. I made double the amount of sauce and froze it for other uses so I wouldn't have to go through all the work again.

My husband and I both loved it! I used regular lasagne noodles (without pre-boiling), and I didn't let the sauce cool before using it--with no ill effects. It was very delicious, very filling, very enjoyable as leftovers. The only problem was some boil-over during cooking.

I substituted bulk turkey sausage for Italian sausage and doubled the recipe for a dinner party. Also used half basil and half fresh spinach in the ricotta layer and added garlic.

Excellent, quick and easy. I made this when I came from work and we had it for dinner that night. My husband is VERY fussy about Italian red sauces but had two servings and is waiting for the leftovers. First time I've used the no-cook noodles and will never go back the the other type. Rich, yes, but what's lasagna without lots of cheese!

Everybody liked it, I thought it was a little rich, next time I will cut down on the parmesan cheese.
