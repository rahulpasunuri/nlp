Who needs to go to a restaurant . . . I knew this would rock when I tasted the sauce. I added some spinach, cream cheese and chicken. Next time I'll add some anaheim. This is so easy and amazingly great!

MMM MMM good. All ages love this dish time and time again. Even DH who doesn't like pesto!!! Definitely carmelize the onions. FYI - when prepping for a party I do a larger batch and then put out the extra onions on bruschetta. I live near a Wegman's grocery chain and they sell a yummy roasted red pepper sauce for when I don't have time to make my own. Enjoy

Wonderful! Made for appetizer dinner by cutting into narrow pieces and it was a great vegetarian dish.

I make these all the time for dinner when I'm short on time. I use jarred roasted peppers, add shredded rotisserie chicken to make it a meal and sometimes for variation add sauteed shitake mushrooms and omit the pesto. Really easy to make and really, really good. Even my 2 year olds like them.

I'm not a fan of goat cheese, but with some modifications I found this dish well balanced and it tasted great. Give the sauce a few tastes, At first my brain had a hard time eating a quesadilla with a red sauce and thinking the taste was off because it lacked the sweetness of a tomato salsa. Like most recipes the taste of this dish depends on the quality of the cheese and pesto. I modified this recipe for use in a production kitchen. I used more roasted peppers than it called for and more basil than it called for. I also added salt and pepper to taste and a jalapeno pepper for some heat. Blend all ingredients thoroughly to make it a sauce consistency. When serving it with the quesadilla make sure that the sauce is at least room temperature, DO NOT SERVE CHILLED. The sauce has a very subtle roasted red pepper taste and serving it cold will wipe the taste out completely. As for the quesadilla, make sure the onions are very carmalized for it helps the flavor immensely. Also slice the onion into thin julienne strips, that will help the onion from being long and stringy and hard to bite through cleanly in the quesadilla. I also grilled off a chicken breast and sliced it thinly and added it to the recipe to help it sell better. I made a nice light bruchetta and garnished each order with it and served the sauce on the side. Tough dish to sell because of the goat cheese, but the employees loved eating my sample.

Thrilled with recipe even for party situation. Daughter is vegetarian, others only eat what tastes good, others are messy eaters, and others don't like what seems different. Yes, my extended family is hard to cook for and THIS dish was a hit for all! It will be staple recipe for this crowd!

With German, Mexican, and vegeterians in the family, I find dishes for everyone to enjoy a challenge. This recipe was a hit with the whole family and hear there are multiple benefits to goat products in the diet. A winner. Thank you for submitting!

Fabulous! Made twice in one weekend as they were such a hit. Carmelized onions a must. Also, added a bit of cayenne to sauce as others suggested. Baked at 400F both times - flipped over half way thru. 2nd time - assembled earlier in the day, popped in fridge; buttered and baked right before serving.

This is really delicious dish. I used regular polenta, just cooked it a little longer, otherwise did the recipe as is. Had enough for 3 dinners and reheated well in microwave.

These were very good. I used the carmelized onions as suggested in other comments. I would not recommend taking this dish to serve at someone else's house, where it has to be reheated in the microwave, because they come out rubbery. They were delicious, though, when I sampled them freshly prepared.

The sauce is the best part. I combine it with another quesadilla recipe.

Very easy recipe that did not taste like it! Although I did everything as per instructions I would definitely used canned roasted red peppers to shorten preparation time. Was a big hit both times I've made it....none left!

These quesadillas are fabulous. You can the ingredients in a normal grocery store but the taste is gourmet. I triple the sauce and eat it with plain chips!

This recipe is so easy to make, and the mix of flavours gives the palate a wide range to enjoy. It is also tasty from the BBQ.

Roasted red pepper sauce was a big hit. I would roast the peppers in the oven, not over an electric burner. Got rave reviews of the quesadillas -- make sure to get good pesto.

I made some modifications to this recipe that yeilded a great appetizer. I added cream cheese to the goat cheese which made it spreadable and the goat cheese didn't fall off the tortilla when flipping. It still had the taste of goat sheese. I also used caramelized onion-which took this from good to outstanding. I also cooked mine in a 4oo degree oven rather than frying them.

MMM! These were so good, and so quick to prepare. The most time consuming part of the recipe is the sauce, which I liked, but my guests hardly touched because the quesadillas really do stand on their own. They were gone in minutes. (re: the sauce -- you can definitely half it, I did, and I liked the addition of Cayenne pepper as recommended by other reviewers).

I've made these twice now and they were a huge hit both times. The first time, instead of adding raw onions (yuck!), I carmelized the onions and added some roasted red pepper. The second time, I substituted roasted garlic for the garlic and added the roasted red pepper. Both times were great. The first time I did the layering, the second time I didn't.... made no difference! Great appetizer for a few or a lot of people.

I made these with "chicken and mushroom quesadillas" and "corn and cheese quesadillas" (both epicurious recipes) and cooked them all on the grill. Brush top and bottom tortillas with olive oil and grill over medium heat 3-4 min. per side or till lightly browned and filling starts to melt. I did not do the layering suggested in the recipe - just used two tortillas with filling in the middle for each quesadilla. Everyone loved the red pepper sauce - could use a little more zing to complement the sweetness.

I made this for company last night. Everyone loved it! My friend took home the leftover ingredients and the recipe to make it the next day for her guests. I used jarred roasted red peppers to save time and they were fine. Definitely a keeper! It's easy to make too!

This dish was very tasty. I added a little cayenne to the sauce to offset the sweetness of the roasted peppers and give it some zing. One warning, though... it's hard to stop eating them, but you'll regret overdoing it!

Love this! It's rich and delicious. I agree that you should cut the sauce in half - it made way too much. I also cheated and used the jarred roasted red pepper. Will definitely make this again - quick and easy and very good!

I made this as an appetizer for a dinner party and it was a huge hit! I recommend that you cut the tortilla into 16 pieces because it is quite rich. The red pepper sauce is a nice sweet tasting contrast to the sharpness of the goat cheese.

These are very good. Every one of my guests really like them. You do get quite a bit of sauce. You could probably get by with a half recipe of sauce.

I've made this a couple of times and have received great reviews each time. It is very simple and easy to make a very nice presentation. I add a couple of dashes of Tabasco to bring the sauce up a bit.

This was unusual. Tasted like something you would get when ordered in a restaurant. Good to serve when guests are over.

We always default to this recipe when we need a beautiful and incredibly delicious appetizer.

This one's a keeper! I used pre-roasted red peppers that come in a jar to make the process even easier.
