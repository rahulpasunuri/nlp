this is great! super easy and tasty. I used water packed tuna. I added a little celery and red onion.had capers on the side because hubby dislikes them. In assembling the sandwiches, ommited the eggs and lettuce, and added some black olives.

i have to say that the 3 tablespoons of white-wine vinegar was absolutely *overkill!* (was that a misprint/typo?) instead, i used 1 teaspoon of white-wine vinegar instead of the 3 tablespoons printed (& added 2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil to balance it out). so much better! other than that, the recipe is excellent. next time i make this, i will experiment with a little bit of finely chopped red onion.

This is a delicious and easy variant on a tuna sandwich. Highly recommended!

Definitely a keeper! I kept to the spirit of this but then added finely slivered celery roasted red peppers, and sun-dried tomatoes to give it more diversity. It was a hit!

Excellent recipe. I made this for a wedding shower and it went over very well. I found the anchovy paste near the salad dressing and was surprised that it was not expensive ($2.50). I didn't get a chance to boil my eggs, and I couldn't find white wine vinegar so I used red with garlic flavor...and I used ciabatta bread. Very, very good.

This has to be hands down, the best tuna mixture that I've ever tasted.

This was a wnderfully different tuna salad, great for when you're tired of the same ol'thing. I didn't have anchovy paste or the white wine vinegar, so I used red wine garlic vinegar and a bit of salt and it was great. Also, ate them as open faced bagel sandwich, didn't have the rolls... but overall, great recipe and quick to make. Enjoy!

Very good! I made a few changes. Rather than using fresh tomato, I substituted sun dried tomatoes packed in oil, and rather than lettuce I used fresh basil leaves and omitted the boiled egg entirely. I also toasted the bread, which gave it a nice textural component. Definently worth making and very easy!
