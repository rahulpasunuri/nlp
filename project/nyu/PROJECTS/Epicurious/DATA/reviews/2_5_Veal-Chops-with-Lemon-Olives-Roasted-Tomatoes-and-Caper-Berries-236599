This is one of my most requested dinners, but it needs some adjustments to warrant this preparation style for such an expensive cut of meat as one member said. First I leave the veal ribs together to achieve the level of doneness my clients prefer. One likes very rare, the other likes medium. I salt and pepper the roast lightly, then brown in a saute pan that can be transferred to the oven. Browning takes about 6 to 8 minutes, then I add the tomatoes, chopped garlic, caperberries, olives, oregano and wine (increasing to 3/4c.), with an ADDITION of peeled cioppine onions and a TBSP of rich veal demi-glace or beef boullion. I roast in a 400F degree ovens for approximately 15 minutes more depending on thickness of meat. I remove the veal to rest on cutting board while I correct seasonings to the vegetables and sauce. I only add the lemon juice if the sauce is not tangy enough which is preferred. I have also used fresh thyme instead of the oregano before, and it was just as good. I prepare the plates by spooning the vegetables down first, then laying a chop on top. If the sauce is thinner I simmer it a few moments more then swirl in 1 TBSP of the butter just before topping each serving. I use this style to take advantage of the wonderful meat juices and have the flavours combined as much as possible.

The previous review scared me a bit so I did some improv. that worked out well. I decreased the garlic to one clove and added one mince shallot. I added a tsp of veal demi-glace to the sauce. It also seems like a waste not to deglase the pan that the chops were broiled in. I did this with some more white wine and added to the sauce.

In my epicurious recipe box there are at least a dozen better recipes for this expensive cut of meat. Funny thing is all these ingredients are favorites but not in this case.
