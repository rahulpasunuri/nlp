I doubled the recipe and brought it to a pot luck dinner. It wsa a hit even among the usual fussy folk.

This recipe is basically a stolen version of Kasha Varnishkas, for which the recipe is on the side of your box of kasha (which is another type of grain similar to barley). It tastes much better with the kasha, which isn't quite so squishy as the barley.

This wasn't really a "wow-er". Nothing with carmelized onions can be all bad however and texturally, it was good. Had it as a main dish--would only make it again as a side dish. Agree that visually, it would need something else to serve "outside the family". I also felt somewhat "virtuous" eating it!

Again, another big hit with the in-laws and my fast-food loving husband. The only thing I changed was I used low sodium beef broth instead of the vegetable broth. Even in this carb crazy world this dish is irristable.

Both my husband and I thought this was pretty tasty. I found this to be very filling. Quite healthy, although it doesn't taste THAT healthy. Pretty chewy - nice texture. Different.

This is a fantastic recipe. I think the vegetable broth makes it taste too soupy, so I recommend substituting white wine: pinot grigio or vinho verde make the dish perfect.

Liked the texture of it, but the onions made it way too sweet.

This was delicious! It was a little too healthy for me to try to pass off to my kids for a main course, but I made it as a side and they really enjoyed it. My son didn't believe there were onions in it because it was so sweet, and my 6 year old daughter had to helpings. The pasta is a nice compliment.

I really enjoyed this dish. It was earthy and filling and easy to make. It's a nice main course for vegetarians, but it would also be a great accompaniment to a meated entree.

A very easy recipe w/ a pleasingly different texture (the barley). I served this cold at a tailgate, and it still went quickly. However, it's not the most appealing-looking dish; I spruced it up w/ a diced red pepper.

Very filling recipe. It gives new meaning to the "mushroom side dish". Try it when you want to put something a little different next to your beef.
