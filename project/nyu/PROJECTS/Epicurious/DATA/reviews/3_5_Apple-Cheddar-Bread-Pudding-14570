I made this for a brunch on the first day of Nov. Perfect autumn dish! I used a French baguette instead of white bread. I would do it again- the baguette held up really well. I used MacIntosh apples instead of Granny Smtih (not a Granny Smith fan) and they were sweet and delicious in the recipe.I also added extra sharp cheddar in the first layer and would do that again as well. This is a really tasty dish- the apples stand out to distinguish it. As others have noted, it is not an overwhelmingly sweet dish which also made it different. Definitely a winner!

I had a 1/2 loaf of leftover Cinnamon Raisin bread that I used, and omitted the butter and spices step. I also added sausage links too! I used a mild white cheddar and it didn't seem to add much to the dish, so next time I'll try a really sharp cheddar.

I made this for a fun sunday dinner on a cold fall evening. I used whole wheat bread (because that's what I had) and Splenda instead of white sugar. MMMM

I made this last Christmas Eve for an open house, and people loved it. I agree with other reviewers that the baking aroma was heavenly, but I also agree with the sweet-toothed reviewers that the flavor was not what I expected. I would make it again, because it is very good, but I'll know in the future to expect something more savory than sweet.

This was a winner! ...a perfect dessert for a cool fall day. There is nothing I would change in the recipe. My guests raved and asked for seconds. Served it with creamy whipped cream!

I personally did not like this recipe and my sweet tooth son agreed, but my husband really liked it. I would not make it for our household but could see making it for a brunch, maybe if my arm was twisted and I had no other ingrediants for something better.

Delicious! I've made it several times for my family and company. All who've tried it love it! The cheese gives it just the right touch. Though the recipe name proclaims it a dessert, it makes a great brunch dish.

My husband, too, loved this bread pudding. Compared to many others, it is quite light. However, I though it could have been a bit more custardy, and I think the next time I make it, I will increase the eggs and milk by 25%. I took the suggestion of the other reviewer and omitted the cheese, and instead made a caramel white chocolate sauce to accompany the read pudding. Delicious!

This is one of my favorite recipes. My husband doesn't like bread pudding but loves this one.

I would make it again without the cheese. It didn't really add anything. But the apples and cinnamon bread were wonderful.
