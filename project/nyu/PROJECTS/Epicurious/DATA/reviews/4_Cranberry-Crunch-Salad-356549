Had most ingredients left over from holiday functions and made these for the salad course for dinner with 9 and 10 year old boys. "Can we eat the salad with our hands?" they exclaimed and proceeded to devour the entire platter. Never really thought of endive as a kids treat, but you never know...

These are excellent little winter vegetable crunches that make a tasty and easy addition to fall and winter cocktail parties. They are a huge hit

These were OK. Looked nice but just OK.

What an easy, elegant and unique appetizer! I made this for a Christmas party, and after an initial hesitation because of not knowing quite what it was, someone tasted it, exclaimed out loud how amazing it was, and within about 20 minutes, the entire plate was empty! Used radicchio instead of endive, which was not bitter (are they they same thing??), left the skin on the green apple for the red/green holiday theme, and used plain goat's milk yogurt instead of Greek...more yogurt than mayo, too. YUM YUM! Making this again tomorrow for a Christmas day appetizer for our extended family!

This was really, really good! My husband who normally doesn't like creamy ingredients such as Mayo loved this.

The cabbage being so bitter I would use more apple next time. Bit the dressing really was a nice change! Oh and more pecans since I love the crunch :)

Using small endive leaves this was a hit at my cocktail party. It really needed a wee bit of orange zest to pull all the flavors together. Made a great finger salad!

Everyone raved at what a healthy, refreshing, delightful combination this appetizer was. My guests didn't mind the endive and it makes for such pretty presentation (although it's understandable folks not accustomed to endive might find it a tad bitter in comparison to other lettuces). Will definitely make again!

This was a tasty, healthy appetizer. However, not everyone liked the endive because it is so bitter. I recommend have crackers or wrapping in lettuce.
