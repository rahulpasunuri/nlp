Great recipe. Works like a charm. I added some udon noodles to make it a little more robust but the taste was spot on. Thanks!

4 forks alone for swiftness & ease from start to table. finished with a drizzle of sesame oil which added a nice dimension. look forward to trying different types of miso & fish. veg additions sound lovely, increased shitakes and added oyster mushrooms. lovely, light, flexible.

Black cod was not available when I wanted to make this recipe so I used chilean sea bass instead. It was wonderful!!!!

This dish is incredibly flavorful and easy to prepare. The only reason I did not give it 4 forks is because I found it to be a bit salty. Maybe it was because of the miso I used, but I suggest cutting down on the salt added to the fish and shitakes just in case. Use extra shitakes and don't skimp on the scallions - they are wonderful additions to the dish!

I think this is the first time that I have ever made a 4-fork rated epicurious recipe and regretted it. To me, the soup tasted like something for an ill person who was too sick to eat real food. It was just too boring, and I have no advice on how to make it better--except not to make it at all.

My wonderful neighbor gave us some fresh local cod from Montauk. This dish was the best fish dish we ever had!!! The flavor combo of the mushrooms, parsely, garlic, wine & lemon on top of great fish. It was super.

Easy and tasty. I used fresh wild pollock and made my own miso soup. It was flavorful but there was a richness that was missing. Maybe I should have used butter instead of oil or possibly rubbed the pollock with miso before baking?

Delicious! I made this for a quick dinner and my BF & I found it to be a perfectly filling and light meal. I plan to add matchstick carrots & peppers & some spinach to the broth to up the vegie content. Wonderful and simple dish! Try it!

Absolutely delicious- rich and light in a rare combination! Made it tonight with sea bass. A few other modifications, which we all loved: pour the piping hot miso broth over fresh spinach in each bowl. Also added lightly steamed carrot and fennel matchsticks for a light, sweet crunch to complement the umame.

Excellent - I used fresh halibut and served it with rice. Next time I'll use ramen.

this is a great, super easy recipe, especially if you are watching the calories. I doubled the mushrooms to make it more of a main course. Hubby loved it. Will try in smaller portions for elegant, easy starter for dinner party.

Great easy recipe, but now the local grocery is out of red miso soup because I've told everyone about it.
