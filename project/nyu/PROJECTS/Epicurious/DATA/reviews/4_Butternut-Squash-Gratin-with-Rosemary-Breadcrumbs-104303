Made this recipe again for Thanksgiving. It was a big hit. I didn't change a thing but next time might try less butter. My friend, who does not eat much meat, ended up taking most of it home. She loved it.

This was the hit at our family Thanksgiving dinner this year! We fought over the leftovers! I think this can be made with significantly less butter, and I'd quarter, halve or coarse-chop the onion slices to make them more manageable. Great recipe!

This is, hands down, the best butternut squash recipe that I've ever used. I made very few changes: cut the butter in half and added a little olive oil, used dried rosemary instead of fresh, and used mostly rye breadcrumbs because that was what I had on hand. The crunchy/smooth contrast and the flavor combinations were fabulous. My husband and I devoured half the dish all by ourselves. Takes a little time to put together but well worth the effort.

The squash lovers in my house loved this, but it didn't win over the squash haters. It was pretty in the dish, but not over the top pretty. In short, I think I'll try something with a bit more of a wow factor next year.

Fantastic! I've made at Thanksgiving with turkey and at Christmas with beef tenderloin. Didn't change a thing.

This was absolutely wonderful - and received lots of compliments at the table. I think that using fresh bread crumbs from a good loaf of bread is key to a really exceptional dish, since they play such an important role in the gratin. I whipped up a super easy sourdough- type loaf in my breadmaker, and toasted the slices before throwing them in a food processor to make bread crumbs. Ended up really excellent and even people who don't like squash loved it! Will definitely be making this again.

We've done this every year since recipe was published. Great for when you want something other than the sweet side of butternut squash. Little kids like it too if you have vegie haters.

I changed a few things. I pre roasted my squashes (used a mix of acorn and butternut) whole, and just scooped the flesh in chunks into the onion mixture at the appropriate time. I added more salt and pepper than called for. I used fresh parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme with the breadcrumbs, as well as subbing Parmesan for the cheddar (and used about 1/2 the amount of cheese called for). It was absolutely fantastic. It will be making a reappearance at the Thanksgiving table, but I'll have to make twice as much, as this recipe was devoured by 6 people.

This was really easy and delicious. I modified this in the following ways to save time and calories: Halve, seed, and roast butternut squash ahead of time. Carmelize onions in 1/4 stick of butter instead of 1/2, and let them cook a little longer until very soft and browned. Then I added the squash and the broth, put it in the pan, and added topping (using breadcrumbs made from leftover rosemary bread and about half the cheese called for). I baked for 30 minutes and it came out great. Even my non- squash loving husband had extra helpings.

This is excellent. Really no need to change anything, other than it took me twice as long to get the squash to start carmelizing. My husband loved. So nice you can start prep the night before.

I have made this twice and loved it both times - even more the second time actually. Definitely pre-roast the squash (cut in half lengthwise, 350 oven for about 30 min.) - makes sauteeing and final baking much quicker. Also added a couple of cloves of minced garlic just before adding the squash to the caramelized onions. This recipe is now part of my "regulars"!

This was a universal hit at Thanksgiving this year. It was unusual and delicious. I'll make a few changes, though, when I make it again, namely: 1. A greater ratio of squash to topping--there was not enough squash per bite. I'd double the squash; and 2. Far less rosemary or perhaps none. The rosemary taste dominated---I wish it had been more subtle and that the thyme had stood out more.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe for something different, especially for Thanksgiving. And have made it several times. However I have found if made as written it comes out a little soggy. So I cut back on the chicken broth to 1/2 cup. I also cut back on the fresh rosemary to 1T. Since it is hard to find white cheddar here I just use regular cheddar and it is delicious. Over all this is a keeper for me and one I would recommend.

Rating: 3
This dish is not spectacular, but it's yummy. We used bread cut into small cubes instead of crumbs, which lends a nice crunchy texture to the top (though it won't be crunchy the next day!) The sweet and salty/savory flavors together were good, though I would have preferred less sweetness. Nice comfort food.

Rating: 3
Like others before me suggested, I roasted the squash first..making it much easier to peel and handle. I cut the onions in half as I have an onion hater in the house and added just a touch more cheese. Brought it to a potluck and the dish was almost licked clean. I did keep a small ammount for myself and it was even better the next day. I will make squash a day ahead next time. I made the breadcrumbs and found it to be easy and a nice compliment in textures. Will be making for Thanksgiving and December holidays as well!

Rating: 4
I could eat this every night for dinner. It was so good. For the bread crumbs, I highly suggest using rosemary bread from a local bakery if possible. I used some of the crust, which added a bit more crunch. I also tweaked the recipe a little by only using 1 1/2 onions and by sprinkling about 2 tsp of celery seeds over the top. Very tasty!

Rating: 1
I was very disappointed with this dish. Way too many breadcrumbs (I used another reviewer's suggestion of using regular bread crumbs and panko bread crumbs). It's quite a bit of work for a vegetable sidedish, and takes quite a long time from beginning to end. It's not worth the trouble.

Rating: 4
Dear God, this was delicious. I read the reviews and used a mix of dry and panko breadcrumbs instead of the fresh and it was delicious. We had to put it away or we would've eaten the whole thing in one sitting.

This is a totally awesome dish. My husband and I are not vegetarians by any stretch of the imagination, but we find this a very satisfying main course on many a night. I can also see it as a side, especially at Thanksgiving, but for us, this plus a salad makes a meal. Also, on my most recent attempt, I cut both the butter and cheese in half. I thought it would really compromise the flavor, but as it turns out, it was just as delicious this way.

Greatly exceeded my expectations. Absolutely delicious and the crust gives good contrast/texture to the squash which almost becomes a puree. Not a spoonful was left. Wouldn't serve 10 at our house.

Very easy recipe. DEFINITELY purchase the pre-cut squash-it would take too long to cut it yourself. I agree with another reviewer- if you make it in advance you don't have to re-heat it for 10 min. I used panko breadcrumbs. I was hesitant to give this recipe 4 forks because I thought it was delicious but not out of this world. Then I ate it 2 and 3 days afterwards and then I realized it was definitely a dish beyond compare!

Rating: 4
This will absolutely be on our menu for Thanksgivings to come. I made a half recipe of this last night for husband and self, a few days after the Holiday, as I was craving a comfort dish with butternut squash. Starting with precut squash is a huge time saver. For the topping, I mixed a bit of finely grated romano in with the cheddar and used panko for the crumbs, which provided a light crunchy counterpoint to the melt-in-your-mouth goodness beneath. I rarely award four forks, but this was indeed a dish beyond compare. Also, I used a blend of half butter/half macadamia nut oil, a recent adjustment in much of my cooking of late (easily whipped together in Cuisinart to have on hand).

Rating: 4
FANTASTIC~ I have made this for the last four years for Thanksgiving. Even those who are not squash fans love it. It will be a family tradition forever. I bake it the day before Thanksgiving: 15 minutes into the final baking time, melting the cheese/bread crumb mixture, I take it out and refrigerate it. Once the turkey comes out of the oven and is cooling, in this dish goes for 15 minutes at 350-375 degrees. Perfect timing with make ahead ease.

I made this for a potluck last night and it was a hit. I baked the squash as others have recommended, which I think saved a lot of work. I added the cooked, cubed (and somewhat smooshed) squash to the carmelized onions and cooked them for about five minutes. Then I only did one baking of the assembled dish at 400 degrees until the crumbs browned. The recipe as written is very time-consuming but I don't think it has to be.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely delicious! I pre-baked the squash to make peeling/dicing easier. Used veg broth to make vegetarian and cut rosemary back to 1 tbsp (love rosemary, but was afraid it might overpower the squash). Baked veggies about 35 minutes as squash was already partially cooked and I carmelized onions longer than recipe states. Before adding topping, I removed foil and baked an additional 10 minutes as veggies seemed really watery. Ended up leaving in a warm oven while trying to get baby to bed, so topping and edges were quite crunchy and still completely heavenly. Will make again with noted (small) changes.

Rating: 3
This was excellent: I followed another reviewer's advice and baked the squash in the oven, halved and seeded, until it was fairly soft, then scooped out the flesh - a lot less work than peeling and cubing a raw squash. At that point, you can reduce baking time quite a bit - I think I baked about 30 min plus another 20 with the breadcrumb crust, and it came out very soft and velvety. I used a mixture of pecorino and parmigiano as it is hard to find cheddar cheese here. the following day we ate leftovers with brown rice and it was delicious.

Phenomenal!!! I only made a tiny few changes. 1) did the sauteeing in a non-stick so I only used about 2 Tbs of butter rather than 4. 2) mixed thyme in with the squash before baking 3) In the absence of a food processor, I got some good day old roasted garlic bread from a store and crumbled it into 1/4 to 1/2 inch cubes. I actually used between 3-4 cups of cubes mixed with the cheese and rosemary. All in all, a huge winner!!!

I'm back for a second review. Made this for a dinner party last night and served with Roast Pork with Dried Apple and Cranberry Conserve from www.cookinglight.com. Make sure you use a large serving spoon...each person needs a generous serving of squash and breadcrumbs to enjoy the dish completely!

Made this tonight, and it was loved by even our picky eater. Our vegetarian son ate half the dish! I did not make it as directed but halved and seeded the squash, and baked @350 'till done , and scooped out. Cooked the onion and seasonings on the stove then combined all together in a casserole.I don't usually give 4 forks but will today. It a great change from the sweet dishes.

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. Besides it being a great recipe, the ability to prepare the dish half way through the day before cut down on the amount of food preperation on Thanksgiving Day. The only thing I did differently, was to deglaze the pan with the chicken stock and strain out any brown bits before adding it to the dish. This adds more of the great carmelized flavor to the Squash.

Made it with hubbard squash. Delicious flavor combination but threw off too much liquid, which had to be drained off. Could reduce the cheese somewhat.

I love this recipe. I made it a few years ago to bring to my in-laws Thanksgiving dinner, and I have been assigned to make it for every holiday feast since that time! Always a hit. I also substitute brown sugar as well as sprinkle a bit of nutmeg and maple syrup on top before adding the breadcrumbs. (Just a smidge, though, so as not to overpower the dish.)

Made this for the in-laws at Christmas (always nerve-racking, as they used to own a restaurant). They loved it! Used half the amount of fresh rosemary, as I didn't want the rosemary to overpower the squash. Used yellow cheddar instead of white, 'cause the store was out. Cooked the squash in the morning and set aside; topping step timed to serving time--great for oven-intensive holiday dinners. Will definitely make it again.

Actually, the squash part was good but it was much to difficult to cut into to those little chunks - would have been much easier larger. The topping was a waste of time - squash was much better without it - much too many different flavors going on.

What a great way to serve butternut squash! The dish was easy to prepare, and very tasty. I would serve it with almost any roast through the fall and winter months...lamb was particualarly nice. I did make a few changes though, I used dry breadcrumbs and only 3/4 cup, and used 1/2 cup freshly grated pecorino cheese (similar to parmesan) instead. If you make those changes only bake 20 minutes during the last 400 degree bake.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was fantastic -- the topping made a nice, chewy texture. However, either double the amount of squash mixture for the size casserole dish recommended, or use a smaller casserole dish (which I did, and it was gobbled up by 6 of us!). Definately will be a mainstay dish all winter!

This is a great dish! With three of the most perfect requirements: easy, quick and delicious. I can understand about fewer breadcrumbs, but didn't even come close to ruining the dish. Absolutely going to become standard part of our Thanksgiving menu --especially since sweet potatoes and yams are evil. :-)

I made this first to take as my contribution to Thanksgiving Dinner. Ironically, the only thing that was missing from the traditional dinner this year was sweet potatoes and this was a really great substitute. It got fantastic reviews. I had two squash left over and made it again over the weekend, this time omitting the sugar because I personally found it a little too sweet the first time. It worked fine and the squash alone is sweet enough. I also used 1/2 sharp white cheddar & 1/2 sharp yellow and found it to work really well. We didn't find it to be dry either time.
