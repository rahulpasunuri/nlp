I made lots of revisions, but the results were exceptional. 1) instead of jalapeno, I used ancho chile powder and added salt and pepper to the marinading shrimp 2) Used corn tortillas and brushed liberally with butter before baking, this ensured the tostadas were crisp, not hard. 3) made a salsa with 2 avocados, 1 tomato, green onions, lime juice, parsley salt and pepper 4) served an iceberg lettuce/red cabbage/cucumber salad on the side with a lime vinegrette 5) made red beans and rice topped with shredded cheese as a side dish 6) served shrimp and salsa on top of tostada with Herdez green tomatillo salsa and had salad and beans/rice on the side

I also made these with corn tortillas. Much better than flour. I made coconut rice with pineapple as a side, but ended up putting it on the tortilla, topped by the salad and shrimp. In the end, I had a ton of salad and tortillas left, but no shrimp, so my friends and I made some with refried beans and put those on the tortillas, with the rice and salad. Very good too!

Quite yummy - served 2 as a one-dish meal. Heated the tortillas on the stove. Added lime, cayenne, and a little jalapeno (and some extra avocado) to the salsa. Omitted the majority of the cilantro, due to personal preference, and subbed green onions for red.

Not too impressive... The salsa and salad are okay, the shrimp was not that special - maybe if they were grilled they might be a little better, and the baked flour tortillas crumble when you eat them. I definitely won't make them again...

Great dish! I did make several modifications as suggested by other reviewers. Instead of store bought tortillas I made them myself (basic flour tortillas recipe). While a very quick and easy modification, it made a big difference in the overall taste. I also added a dash of salt and pepper to the shrimp. Overall- a very fine meal, healthy and flavorful...

My fiance and I love to spend time in the kitchen creating new meals. We were very disappointed with this particular one. The shrimp was bland, to say the least, and after fifteen minutes in the oven, our tortillas were over done. The salsa did not add much to the dish. The presentation was so delightful, but after a few bites it was obvious that this dish was not all that we had anticipated.

I needed another recipe and made this for my family and they loved it. I made my spanish rice to go with it and used jasmine instead and the combo was great. Will be making it Christmas eve for my family again with flour torillas and some slow cooked beans and ham hocks...

I really liked this recipe and would definitely make it again, but next time I would add more spices to the shrimp - they were a bit bland for my taste. The overall presentation of this dish was quite nice.

I used canned jalpenos and and extra garlic clove in the shrimp marinade and they turned out excellent. I didn't read flour, so I baked corn tortills and fried some so the family members had a choice. The corn tortillas are small and the salad on top made dinner look like a restaurant salad tostada. I added a little bottled salsa to my 'salad' because I should have doubled the salsa recipe. Other family members added refried beans to the tostada and piled the rest on top. I served asparagus and ended up adding it to my 'salad'. The asparagus was a really yummy addition - it had a little butter and lemon juice. The baked corn tortillas are crisper and take more chewing. We liked them.

I made this recipe last night with some small revisions and it was thoroughly enjoyed by both my husband & myself. To shave some of the fat, I sprayed the tortillas w/Pam instead of brushing w/oil. Used the calories saved to put cheese on the tortillas as suggested by others. Yummy! This recipe looks nice on the dish too.

Very good. Next time I would watch the tortillas because I think that I almost overdid them in the oven. Also, I added a little bit of bottled salsa to the avacado/tomato mix, a little bit of grated white cheese on top of the tortilla, and more lime juice than the recipe calls for. I think that those additions made this good recipe even better.

This was really good and easy. I made it for a Mexican party in our neighborhood and everyone loved it....just didn't make enough!

WOW! This was great! Hot any spicy! I added a full heaping tsp. of cumin and 3 full cloves of garlic to the shrimp,extra avocado to the salsa. Only had purchased corn tostadas which turned out crunchy and delicious. We also placed a thin layer of jack cheese with jalepenos on the hot corn tortilla. YumYum! I'm making it again Sunday for guests!

Great recipe! I made it into a salad (didn't have flour tortillas) -- light, fresh, and very tasty!

This was awesome! Left out the cucumber and avocado (only because the one we had was rotten inside!)and it was still scrumptious! Made them like quesadillas, shredded cheese on the bottom and top, heated through in a frying pan. Yum.

This dish was very easy and quick, and it was delicious too! My husband said this is what he'd want me to make if he was stranded on a desert island... I left out the jalapeno, and added a bit of chili powder and paprika to the shrimp, and we left out the lettuce & cucumber. It turned out great! Yummy!

I've made this one a couple of times already, and it's been great every time. It's very fast and easy too; all the prep time is in the chopping, but even that isn't excessive. I've always served this recipe as soft tacos, which works great and is a little easier. Leftover salsa is great on quesadillas!

Easy to prepare, great for a buffet party table. Assemble just before setting out,or let guests assemble for themselves, they go fast! You can substitute mini corn tortillas or large corn chips and use in a tapas buffet.
