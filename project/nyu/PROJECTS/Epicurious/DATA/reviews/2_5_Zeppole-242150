Try this other recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Zeppole-363570 I'd make the balls smaller per the Bon App version, but follow the proportions and prep from the Primo restaurant (link above). Delish! It's fun when they turn over by themselves as they brown. Be sure to let them go darker golden to ensure the center is cooked through.

This recipe must be WRONG. 1 tablespoon of salt?! I followed the recipe, even though it sounded off, and they came out terrible.

I haven't made these yet, though looking forward to it, as I just discovered the recipe for them on this site, but we order them practically every time we got to Primo in Rockland (which is a lot), and I have yet to see a person who did not like them - a perfect finale to a glorious meal, thank you, Price!

Here's an alternative to doughnuts. Zeppole turned out good, but not great. I imagenined addictive, bite sized fried dough treats. These were not addictive. My kids had one or two and they moved on. I made them as a winter dessert and paid attention to the comment on reducing the salt that an earlier reviewer posed. For our family of four the dough yield was too much. I would cut it in half so you have a one- evening treat and can decide if you like it enough to make again. Since I had left over dough I refrigerated it and fried again the next day. They turned out exactly the same, good enough but underwhelming, just not quite delicious.

Beware! The version printed in the magazine reads "1 tablespoon salt", which I stupidly followed even though I suspected it was wrong. Other than using 3x too much salt, this recipe was wonderful. Light, crisp, airy, warm. Be sure to make them quite small, otherwise they take too long to cook through. I wondered about the pronunciation so I looked it up: TZEE-powl-ee
