I didn't have mint or shallots, so I substituted arugula and onion. I also only had milk, so the sauce wasn't "creamy" at all. But it was really quite good. A light flavorful pasta, that was a nice change from parmesan type sauces. The arugula substitution worked especially well. We liked it and would probably make it again someday, maybe as written next time.

I made this after searching for a recipe with pasta and carrots (because I had them already) and was delighted to find a recipe requiring mint, which I also had on hand. Warning to particular readers: I substituted frozen corn for the peas and thin spaghetti for fusilli (since they were the ingredients I had). The result was delicious. The carrots, mint, chicken stock and cream combination was a winner.

Sauce was flavorless...pea flavor much to prevelant
