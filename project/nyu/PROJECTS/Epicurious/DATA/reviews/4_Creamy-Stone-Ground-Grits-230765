I have never really liked grits, which, for a southern cook, is kind of a disgrace. That is, I have never liked grits until I tried this recipe. It's now one of my go-to recipes any time I cook breakfast at home. The recipe is rather flexible. If you're short of time, you can shorten the cooking times in each section a little bit and it won't suffer. And you can use cream or half and half or more or less butter, and the results are still good. And if you have leftovers, they reheat very well. This has become one of my favorite recipes. And I don't know what other people are doing, but it has never come out runny or thin for me.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were wonderful. But they were even better when I doubled the butter!

I liked this recipe because it didn't use cream or half & half to get the creaminess promised in the name of the recipe. I halved the recipe but other than that, followed the ingredients and technique exactly, and it came out great. Grits, when done, often do come out soupy just out of the pot. But in a couple of minutes they'll firm right up. This was a nice way to cook our local stone ground grits that kept the flavor and texture intact. Simple, easy, and tasty.

First let me say that the grits from Hoppin' John are outstanding (I ordered them from the site). The owner was also more than accommodating, as he doesn't generally ship to Canada (they don't sell grits up here, sadly). This recipe comes with the little sack of grits. I followed it to the letter, and it positively gave me soupy, thin grits. I therefore went hunting for other recommendations and then tackled the grits again. For beautiful creamy grits: To the top of a double boiler, add together: 2 cups chicken boullion, 2 cups milk, 1 cup stone-ground grits, 3/4 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, 2 TBL butter, (and optional: 2 strips bacon). Put the heat just under medium, cover, and leave it alone for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. You will need to replenish the water once. Voila! Perfect grits! Deborah Madison gets the kudos for the correct kind and proportion of liquids.
