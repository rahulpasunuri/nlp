The recipe with corrected egg white made a delicious tart. I had no problem making the crust; there was plenty of dough. It was somewhat hard however and would have been difficult to eat if it had been any thicker. The Marcona almonds make the recipe as their flavor is far superior to standard variety. I picked some up at Whole Foods.

Here's a link to the original recipe posted on Bon Appetit's site. This has the CORRECT ingredients (the egg white quantity is listed): http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/2010/05/bakewell_tart_with_raspberry_preserves

I made this with a bit of hesitation due to the negative reviews. The end result was pretty good, though. I agree, the crust measurements do not provide enough crust for a strong crust. It was a bit sparse and thin in some areas. Additionally, it wasn't as flakey as I would have liked. Thank you to the reviewer who pointed out the correct egg white measurements. Based on that I was able to achieve the perfect consistency for the filling. I didn't have any marcona almonds, so I roasted almond slivers and ground them in the cuisinart. I found that the raspberry flavour came through just fine. Would I make this again? Yes, but I would use either a different crust recipe or make more of the one listed.

Important: The original recipe in the magazine calls for 3 egg whites. This has been left out of the ingredient list here.

I would like to try this recipe but please note that your list of ingredients calls for 4 large egg yolks and no mention of egg whites, but you directions for the filling say add egg yolks and egg whites - HOW MANY EGG WHITES - maybe the 4 from the 4 egg yolks

Total disappointment! Followed directions exactly, but was a disaster. Crust filling was too scant and shrunk after baking. Filling with eggs appeared to have unusual texture.Could it be missing flour? Terrible-would not recommend at all. Threw in the trash!

Will never make again....very bland...not enough raspberries. It was just okay and wouldn't make again. There are too many other fantastic dessert recipes to make

Very tasty. I had forgotten to get whipping cream, which I wanted to add a little Amaretto to! I found the dough to be super easy to work with. I did have to add 2 tsp. extra of water, but no problem after that. Will definately make again!

Yummy and easy. Didn't have a food processor or a tart pan or fancy almonds or almond extract or a vanilla bean and it still turned out great. I used regular sliced almonds and ground them up in the coffee grinder, vanilla extract and a little rum extract. The kids liked it too.

Not extremely exciting but good texture and the crust was great even though it was a bit hard to work with compared to others. Make sure to get good preserves. Best part is I had everything in the pantry to make it so it was very low cost. I would probably make it again for that reason.
