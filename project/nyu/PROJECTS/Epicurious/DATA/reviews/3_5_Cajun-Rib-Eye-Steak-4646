I made this tonight with just the spice rub. I used organic paprika, extra cayenne, less salt (but Kosher), and freshly grated garlic pepper. I just mixed the spice rub together, rubbed it onto an organic grass-fed ribeye, and let it sit for about 10-15 minutes. Since it's freezing out, I used the George Foreman and then finished it in a 350 degree oven for about 15 more minutes. It was really tender and delicious--so easy. I wouldn't say it was bland at all. Make sure your spices are fresh.

I just tried this recipes tonight. All I did was substitute Accent for the salt in the recipe. Used Frank's Red Hot in place of "cayenne pepper" and added some Creole Seasoning. And I did away with the white pepper. This, by far, is the best tasting Cajun Rib-Eye I had.

I have to agree with the reviewer who complained about being less than overwhelmed with the flavor of the steaks. I don't think the issue is upping the components of the spice rub. I think the steak would be much more flavorful with the addition of soy sauce in the marinade rather than salt with the spices. Also. I broiled my 1" thick rib-eye as instructed. Half of it was medium and the other half was well done. I'm not exactly sure what went wrong. The steak was the same thickness throughout. I'm guessing the problem stems from my not positioning the steak properly under the broiler. Either way, a total of 16 minutes is too long. 'Sides, the resulting smoke set off an alarm. Not cool. Nonetheless, I'm continuing with my plan to use the remaining marinade on salmon. With the addition of soy sauce. And, not on broil.

Great and easy, nice kick to it. Almost doesn't need the onions and mushrooms on top. Stands all by itself!

This steak had a nice flavor. Very tender and easy to make.

Overall, this was great - the marinade smelled really good because of all the onions in it. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil for more flavour. For it to be Cajun, I think it needs more "punch". Maybe next time I'll look into some Creole spices as well before putting the steaks on the grill. Also, the grilling time was a little longer than recommended for medium-rare (I used 1-in thick steaks).

Great flavor, the cajun spices "snuck" up on us. I will no doubt make this again! I used olive oil instead and it gave it a more rounded flavor!

My husband made this for me after my first day in a new job. Marinated for about 20 minutes due to time constraints and sauteed the onion and garlic (instead of garlic powder) to eat atop the steaks. Did steaks medium on the grill. This was the best steak I ever had. I highly suggest the onions and/or mushrooms on top as it adds something else with the delicious marinade flavor!! You will not be disappointed! Seasonings are perfect with just enough heat, if you like more, just kick it up a notch!

I was really looking forward to this recipe with the great reviews, but it was only ho-hum. Surprisingly, it wasn't seasoned enough. I marinated the meat overnight, and I think the oil needed an acid in it to give it an umph, which it just did not have. Perhaps if I added a little more salt and cracked black peppercorns all over the steaks just before searing them and tried the recipe again ...

The best steak that there is. Definitely saute onions and mushrooms. After I made it twice, no other steak recipe apeals to me anymore!

Really good. One day, we were too busy to marinade so we just did the dry rub, which was still excellent (though not as quite as good).

This steak was better than many of the "steak palaces" in New York City!!!!! The combination of the marinating and the dry rub is absolutely fabulous!!!!!!!! My friends beg for this steak when I invite them to dinner!!!!! Thank you Bon Appetit!!!!

Very tasty dish, and the meat was very tender. My husband loved it, he said it reminded him of his father's steaks in Panama.

One word....FABULOUS. The tip to saute the onions with some mushrooms was an additional treat. You will not regret making this...and your dinner guests will be extremely impressed!

This was good, but like any steak recipe, be sure to use a good cut of meat. We used an average cut, and though it had great flavor, it was still tough. However, the suggestion to saute the marinated onions with mushrooms, etc. made this recipe worth it. The onions were outrageously good.

This meal is great!!! Just enough heat and tons of flavor, my guests loved it. One tip I have is to saute the onions used in the marinade w/ some mushroons, a little butter and some cooking wine. Tastes great.

This steak was great. I have already planned to make it again by putting the steak in the marinade in a zip-lock bag and freezing it! That way when I'm ready to fix it all I have to do is thaw it out.

Exceptional, I added dried red pepper to the blend to make it more spicy.

Absolutely LOVED it! Making it again for my husband for Fathers day! Made garlic and parmesan mashed potatoes and asparagus tips with a nice glass of Merlot Muuuah! Wonderful! A+

My husband is a GREAT cook himself and loves Cajun recipes. We loved this steak!! It was very flavorful and tender with just the right amount of heat to make it interesting. Although I'm a confessed medium-well meat eater, I wouldn't cook this past medium for premium flavor!

Very hot and spicy - which my guest and I loved! Tip: I accidently mixed too much of the dry spices for sprinkling, so the next day I used the spice mixture on some chicken pieces as a dry rub and it was almost as good as the steak.
