I used a silicone bundt pan instead of an angel food cake pan and that was a big mistake -- the apples burned on to the bottom and the whole cake suck to the pan. Yucky burnt honey flavor all around. Also you MUST store it in the fridge or the apples will mold. I would steer clear of this one in the future. There are much better honey-cake recipes out there.

Not very good. Unlike some of the other reviews, I followed the recipe exactly with the only exception being that I used a bundt pan instead of and angle food cake pan. The bottom of the cake burnt, and fortunately I checked the cake after 1 hr or the damage would have been worse. It's way too sweet and the texture was too spongy and chewy. Without slathering it in butter or frosting it's really not worth eating. Next time I'll just stick to good old fashioned apple pie for Rosh Hashana.

This cake is wonderful EXACTLY as the recipe calls for. Baked in a Bundt pan and froze in large pieces for later.Served with a maple cream cheese spread. Delicious

I love that comment. What is so funny is that everyone took it so literally. Doesn't anyone else notice looking that the recipes here that everyone indicates that they will make the recipe again but then they change almost everything about it. Classic!

I really hope the previous reviewer was writing about a different recipe, or it would certainly come out rather strange! :)

It was GREAT! I did make a few changes, though. Instead of 3 1/2 cups of flour, I used 1 can of drained chunk white tuna. Instead of baking soda, I used 1 tbl sweet relish, and I replaced the baking powder and cinnamon with 1 tbl mayonaise and a touch of dijon mustard. I kept the salt, which added a nice touch, but instead of beating the eggs I boiled them and cut them into small pieces. I also used honey, but not a cup. Closer to 1 tsp. I then served over crackers and dry white toast. It was fantastic! I strongly recommend.

hello, why would you rate the recipe if you didn't even make the recipe. if you used zucchini in place of apples, it's not an apple cake then is it?

Substituted 2 apples for 2 cups of coarsely grated unpeeled zucchini; did not use the baking powder (I never use it for its aluminum taste, baking soda alone gives enough rise); used only 1 cup of sugar - 50/50 mix of brown and white; used 2 large eggs in place of 2 extra-large; did not use salt. After baking for 10 min at 350, followed by 35 min at 325, the cake came out moist and delish. Oh, and used the buttered and flowered bundt pan. Cake slid out easily when just warm. Cooled on a rack.

This has got to be the WORST apple cake that I have ever made. It cooked way too fast. I had to put a piece of foil over the top to keep it from burning (probably because of the honey). It also was the DRIEST cake I have ever made. You'd think with apples it wouldn't be. I put 3 very large Cortland apples in too. The only thing good about it was the cream cheese frosting I made to go on top. If I didn't know what kind of cake it was, I would never have said there were apples in it. If i could give this cake 0 forks I would. A real bomber!!

This cake was absolutely fabulous (with a few minor changes). First of all, I cooked the cake in a bundt pan and had leftover batter which I used for a minicake. I added two extra apples and used 3 cups of flour. I also added a half cup of vanilla yogurt which in my opinion makes the cake! It was moist, sweet, spicy and delicious! (Vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce would make this a to-die-for dessert!!!)

Made this for Rosh Hashanah; I chose it because it looked easier than the other honey cake recipes. It was good, but not great. (The batter was better than the final product ;-) It's interesting that other reviewers said theirs were done in less than 45 minutes. I baked mine in one-layer cake pans (one was a springform) and they took a little more than an hour.

I thought this tasted a little like a gingerbread (the combo of honey & coffee?), and I liked that a lot. My only 'complaint' is that I did think that the cake was a little on the dry side, maybe I baked it too long? I also added a glaze to make it prettier.

A great cake, very moist and soothing, especially warm. Would be great for any holiday in lieu of spice cake or even breads. The cooking time IS off--I used a 9-inch springform pan with an angel food insert, and it only took 50 minutes. Thanks to the Irvine cook for noting it! My husband took this to his work's Thanksgiving dinner, and only a tiny sliver was left. Next time I will add a light glaze to show it off, although it clearly sold itself! A couple of things I noticed about this cake--if you use McIntosh apples, they are great with the peels still on, just core and chop. I didn't need parchment paper, either--I buttered it down well, and it came right off after baking and cooling a few minutes. The last thing to make it easier: forget step 2 in my opinion. I added the dry ingredients one at a time into the bowl then the coffee as well, and the batter didn't seem to care at all. I even mixed the chopped apples in with the paddle, though obviously on low speed.

I tasty cake but the cooking time was waaaay off. By 40 minutes the cake was already beyond done. It still turned out okay, i also subbed pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon and used a very aromatic honey called monukka, which i got from trader joe's.
