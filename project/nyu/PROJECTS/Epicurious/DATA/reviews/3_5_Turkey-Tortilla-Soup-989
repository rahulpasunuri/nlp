Love this recipe. Easily doubled and made for a weekend night dinner. I always add some fresh cilantro and avocado at serving time. I've tried it with leftover grilled corn and grilled poblano peppers and they're a nice addition as well.

Best use of leftover turkey ever! Added a jalenpeno and black beans instead of lima and everyone loved it! Quick and easy for a soup.

I crave the flavors of Mexican flavors after Thanksgiving, so this soup is awesome for leftovers. I found the initial result on the bland side, so I added the following: black beans instead of lima beans/ a bit of adobo sauce/ 2 dried guajillo and ancho peppers, placed in hot broth for 15 minutes and then whirled in the cuisinart and strained/ a sauteed onion with thyme, Mexican oregano and epazote/ 2 lg cloves of smashed garlic. I did not put the tortilla chips in the pot, but put them in each individual bowl. We added fresh cilantro, grated cheese and chunks of fresh avocado. Complete YUM.

This is a great quick and easy soup! I make it a little different though. I add in sauted onion, a can of black beans, and a package of frozen corn. I don't add lima beans or chips during the cooking process. I just put the chips on in the end. I have made it several times. My husband loves it.

A great soup. As did most reviewers, I improvised. I used canned corn, black beans, chopped onion and sliced black olives. Left out the limas. Also spiced it up with ground cumin. Skinnyboy from Chester is correct - the soup is better the next day. But isn't that true of most?

made it with turkey broth leftover from thanksgiving. Added frozen corn, black beans (lima beans...no thanks), local potatoes, and lots of fresh cilantro. I also added a lot more spice then it called for, but, I love spices. Served it with grated cheddar cheese and sour cream. One of the best tortilla soups I've had.

on a time/effort to results ratio, this cannot be beat. i used homemade smoked turkey stock, smoked turkey from the same bird, peas instead of limas (don't like them) and canned chipotles plus adobo instead of jalapenos because i didn't have any fresh. also topped with shredded cheddar. Was really good and ready in under an hour.

This was a simple, easy dish. Not very deep in flavour but then, there's not much effort put into it. I did use turkey stock, black beans and canned corn, but didn't have any cilantro to go with. A good one-pot way to use up some leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I think it will improve if left overnight.

This recipe has a great results to effort ratio. Very tasty and so easy. I followed many reviewer suggestions: started with fresh turkey stock (added a chopped onion), used black beans instead of lima beans, and garnished the soup with chopped cilantro, lime wedges, sour cream, and crumbed tortilla chips. Delicious.

I added onions and a small can of tomato sauce to the soup. But I also served some chopped raw onion, cilantro, and tortilla pieces in individual dishes on the table (which I got from visiting Mexico years ago.)

Adding fresh cilantro at the end is a must. Also, substitute black beans for lima beans and add a second chili - I used pasilla this time around and it worked out well.

Loved this - it came together soooo quick too which I love! I did substitute black beans and left out the jalepenos hoping my kids would eat it. Also put some cilantro and avocado and cheese on top as was suggested. Fantastic!

Easy and delicious. I used homemade broth that I had in the freezer. I also halfed the chili powder and left out the jalapeno so my kids could eat it.

one of the best tortilla soups I've ever had. I added some cheese to it, which wasn't in the recipe, but definitely made it even better. And this recipe was so quick and easy to do!!

A quick and easy way to use up leftover turkey when you cook a big bird. I'm not a big turkey fan to begin with - a serving or two on Thanksgiving or Christmas is plenty - and the spicy flavor really disguises any gamey turkey taste. We like it topped with sour cream to balance the heat. I've passed the recipie on to friends who all love it.

My husband & I found this soup delicious as prepared with no substitutions or embellishments needed. Turkey is the real star of this dish. We will look forward to making it again with the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving!

Ok, the recipe is a good start, but it needs some help to be really amazing. Here's what I did the second time I made it, and it ended up getting rave reviews and won the "left-over turkey contest" with friends. Broth made from the carcass of the turkey is best, as the stock is key in this recipe. Roast a pasilla chili, peel, dice, and add to the soup. Then when serving top each serving with a scoop of chopped avocado, a spoon of spicy pico de gallo, sour cream, tortilla chips, and a lime wedge. In my opinion, when served this way it looks much prettier and the taste is more interesting.

A quick and easy way to use leftover turkey. The second time I made it, I did not add the chilies, it was hot enough.
