I wish I could give this cake 0 forks -- it was not worth the time, effort or expense. However, the frosting itself was very good. That's the only part we all ate. I'm keeping the frosting recipe to use on a better chocolate layer cake recipe.

This cake was easy to make and good enough but I prefer a lighter cake. The icing was fine, not spectacular.

I didn't care too much for the cake, but the frosting is to die for!!

I don't make a lot of cakes, but I thought this one was good. Not sure if a packaged cake mix would be just as good and a lot easier and cheaper. The quality of the choclate can have a lot to do whether you like this recipe. I'm tired of the flourless cakes that are so heavy. I wasn't able to fit a bowl with ice and water in my mixer, so I put the bowl of frosting in ice to get the bowl very cold, then I put the bowl in the mixer, worked really well.

I wasn't crazy about the cake part of this recipe although I'd definitely use the frosting recipe again.
