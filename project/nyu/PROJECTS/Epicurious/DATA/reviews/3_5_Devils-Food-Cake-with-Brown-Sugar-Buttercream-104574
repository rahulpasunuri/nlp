I have made this recipe, as cupcakes, 4 or five times now. I absolutely love it, BUT the liners always seem to pull away from the cake while they cool. Does anyone else have this problem?

The cake is divine and certainly does make the best cupcakes. Icing is another thing, thought. Absolutely no flavourand family wholeheartedly suggested I never use it again.

This devil's food cake is delicious! I'd give the cake itself a 4, but the recommended brown sugar buttercream takes it down a notch; definitely not my dream frosting pairing. However, the cake itself is moist, flavorful, a perfect chocolate layer cake. I took the advice of several other reviewers, and used half coffee/half water as the liquid. And I did end up needing to bake for a little more than 25 minutes. But the layers came out pretty perfectly for me; they were very tender, so it was a little challenging to get them stacked without breaking, but I managed. I will definitely make this recipe again. However, as I said, I am not a big fan of the brown sugar buttercream. If you don't relish the thought of eating a slab of pure butter on your cake, this may not be the frosting for you. It's just too rich for its own good; I'm all about splurging on decadent foods if the flavor merits, but this buttercream does not, for me.

This is a terrific chocolate cake. I've made it with the brown sugar buttercream, but we like it even better with Caramel Icing between the layers and Chocolate Fudge Icing top and sides, both cooked icings from the Joy of Cooking. Two issues with the cake: the directions say 20-25 minutes, but it takes 30-32 in my ovens, and I've checked my ovens for accuracy. The other issue is that invariably a chunk of cake from the middle of the layer sticks to the buttered & floured parchment paper. Have made this cake a dozen times and it's happened every time.

I love this cake, it has become the only chocolate cake I ever make! I follow the recipe exactly. I've done it as a cake and as 24 cupcakes. Always moist and wonderfully chocolatey.

this recipe is fantastic! i've made it several times, and always to rave reviews. i always halve the recipe and make cupcakes, and substitute the boiling water for hot coffee to intensify the chocolate flavor - and the results have been consistently perfect! it is my go-to chocolate-cake recipe. delicious!!

I would make this again - it is not too sweet and served as a good birthday cake. I used dark chocolate cocoa powder.

This recipe, by far is one of the very best I have ever made. I have used this recipe for years. I make this for my Grooms cakes. Moist, great texture. I add 1 or 2 Tblsp. of strong coffee. I use the brown sugar icing, but add about 12 ounce of good quality dark chocolate melted in the last step to icing. OMG! It is the best. Top it with ganache, chocolate dipped fruit, and dizzle with melted chocolate or curls.

Um...this cake is ridiculous. It is so moist and delicious. I cut it in 1/2 and made twelve lovely little cupcakes. I also made some substitutions, coconut milk for whole milk and coffee for the water. I followed the suggestions of previous foodies and used coffee to add depth. Also I baked the cupcakes for 18 min exactly and they are perfect! I topped them with brown sugar buttercream frosting and I have inhaled two already! These wont stay around long.

A lovely cake with a moist texture. I cut recipe in half and made 12 cupcakes. I used the choc sour cream recipe mentioned and I prefer a buttercream. I would make the cake again, but not the sc frosting.

Made cake without frosting... for all the bowls required - three - it's not worth the effort. Cake texture is nice - moist and fairly light - but, unfortunately, has almost no chocolate flavor. It'fine as a "snacking cake" but not rich or intense enough to be a special occasion cake.

I thought I had a great Devil's Food recipe, but I decided to give this one a try since it looked similar and I didn't have my hand-written recipe with me. This one was better! Great flavor, but the light texture was what made it such a big hit! I was also a little worried about the frosting being too much sugar flavor for such an already wonderfully balanced cake, but it really did pair perfectly! I put some homemade raspberry-crab apple jam between the layers, on top of a thin layer of frosting, and it added just the right amount of zing. I have a large family, so I make everyone a b-day cake as a gift to keep things simple. This was for my sister, and everyone else has asked me multiple times to make it for their birthdays, too!

Delicious, light, moist cupcake. I made two substitutions because I didn't have some ingredients on hand: I used light brown sugar instead of dark, and used 1/4 cup skim milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream. Fantastic!

Did not make frosting, but wanted to compare this recipe side-by-side with a Sprinkles dark chocolate cupcake. Hands down, texture, flavor and moistness - these are the winners. The recipe makes 24 cupcakes, perfectly baked at 22 minutes! I added 1 Tablespoon of espresso powder to bring out the chocolate flavor without it tasting like coffee. I made a chocolate buttercream with these, and they are GREAT. No problems whatsoever. Easy and delicious!

A great basic devil's food recipe. I was intimidated reading through comments about how tempermental the batter could be, but I followed everything to a tee and it was a smashing success. Since I made these for a tea party, I went with cupcakes instead of a full cake; beware, they're prone to expanding quite a bit during baking. Very light and a nice change from dense chocolate desserts. It will be a great addition to my list of potluck contributions!

A tasty chocolate cake, surprisingly light considering the eggs aren't separated. I used half a cup of coffee in place of part of the boiling water in order to enhance the flavor of the chocolate.. I used whipped cream rather than the frosting included with this recipe.

This recipe is just perfect for light, tasty little flavorful cupcakes. Don't expect kid-style super-rich, dense, thick-tasting cupcakes - these go over best with a slightly older crowd. To frost these, I made a simple ganache of about 1/2 c. fancy chocolate shavings and a 1/2 c. of cream (boil the cream, pour over the chocolate). This makes a nice rich icing that can be applied thinly but easily adds that extra dense chocolate-y taste. Serve with whipped cream. Mmm.

Delicious chocolatey moist devil's food cake. I made this recipe as 2 dozen cupcakes which I baked for 18 mins (instead of the suggest 20-25). My oven may run hot, but I think with cakes it is crucial to not overbake, and many people tend to do so--check your cakes at least five minutes shy of the suggested baking time for any recipe. I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I added 3 oz bittersweet chocolate to the hot cocoa mixture. I made these into haute "Hostess" style cupcakes using a swiss meringue for the cream filling and ganache icing. I even made the squiggle on top. My guests (and I) LOVED these. Will definitely make again.

The cake is spectacular, easy to whip up, moist, and super flavorful. The frosting - not so much. I'm on the butter bandwagon, but eeep, I have limits! I would cut back the butter by at least 1/3 - and make sure to be patient while you darkened the sugar - the richness of the browned sugar is the absolute anchor to the frosting.

The cake [I made cupcakes] was easy and delicious. Such a nice texture and taste. I had trouble with the buttercream though. I liked the brown sugar taste, but way too much butter. Has anyone tried to cut the butter in half, or alter it in some other way to get it to work better?

The cake was great....I'll pass on the brown sugar buttercream frosting. It tasted mostly, like...well, BUTTER, and lost all the brown sugar flavor when paired with the rich choclate cake.

I made this as cupcakes with a sour cream frosting. Best chocolate cake I've ever made and I can't remember tasting one better anywhere. Ate it the next day, very good deep flavor and I can't wait for another occasion to try it on another recipient of my gifts of goodies. Valentine's day.

This recipe is awesome. I made it twice this week for two different occasions. Both times I made cupcakes and used my own icing. The cake is very moist and full of flavor. I added about a cup of mini chocolate chips the second time and they were even better. Everybody loved them.

My boyfriend's stepfather requested that I make a devil's food cake reminiscent of his grandmother's. I was at a bit of a loss. But I used this cake recipe with a caramel frosting recipe found elsewhere. I added a little extra cocoa - maybe 1 T. I made it two days ahead, frosted and stored in a cake container at room temp and it kept lovely. Perfect. What a relief.

This cake is the first "scratch" cake I have ever been able to have turn out with a tender crumb, not like a 10-pound doorstop. I must admit I prefer a more intense flavor, so I added a 16-ounce can of chocolate syrup and added 5 minutes to the cooking time for a Bundt pan. Marvelous!!

I'll be trying this again tonight--and watching the baking time more closely. I made them as cupcakes and they burnt (yes, all 24 of them) in the suggested 20 minutes. My fault for stepping away, but my oven is spot-on. Anyhow, unburnt centers tasted moist and delicious, can't wait to try again.

My husband and I made this cake a few months back for a dinner party. He spent a long time decorating it to minic the cover photo in Gourmet. Our guests were wowed by the looks but no one was impressed with the taste. The sour cream gave an odd taste to the cake. I ended up throwing out about a quarter of the cake a week later after no would eat it.

I used this recipe as a birthday present for a friend. Instead of the chocolate buttercream frosting, however, I made cookies and cream frosting by combining vanilla buttercream with crushed Oreos. I garnished it with some chocolate-dipped cherries on top. The birthday boy was thrilled and so were the rest of the guests. A fantastic recipe!

This recipe was great. A friend of mine offered to make my wedding cake and agreed to let me give her the recipe. My husband wanted devil's food cake so my mother, sister and I made this recipe and Nana's devil's food cake (also found on this site) for our family to taste-test. This recipe was the winner, although we didn't make the buttercream frosting. My cake-making friend has made wedding cakes professionally for years, but usually uses boxed mixes because they are easier. I already knew the recipe was really quick and easy, but she said this was the easiest and best from-scratch cake recipe she'd ever tried. Our guests all raved about the cake.

What can I say.. I'm speechless! This cake was AWESOME! Moist, chocolate-y, and delicious. I followed the directions to the "T". I also made the butter cream frosting.. It was "just okay" off the cake but fantastic once I smoothed it on each little cup cake. It was a HUGE SUCCESS! I only made 24 cupcakes, and this was not enough. I will defintely make this again. TRY THIS CAKE, and you will be the talk of any event! It was TERRIFIC

This cake was a huge success. Perfect moist, level layers, delectable buttercream. Spectacular with home-made chocolate ice cream. I can only guess that some of the disappointed reviewers prepared the buttercream during hot, humid weather, didn't use a thermometer, used too-soft butter or if perhaps they didn't mix it long enough. I've made lots of buttercreams and am always amazed at how much time it can take. I too didn't get a chance to see if it was better the next day since the birthday girl (my 77 year old mother) and the rest of the family licked the platter clean!

I made this for my friend's birthday, and HOLY COW, did people go nuts for this cake! I found the icing a little messy, but well worth the effort. I think the key to the icing -- and having it not taste like whipped butter -- is getting the brown sugar syrup to the right temperature...reducing it down really intensifies the flavor. The end product tastes like creamy, whipped caramel. YUMMI-LICIOUS! And the cake...AMAZING. I highly recommend this cake. Follow the directions. Use a thermometer. Make the cake. Eat the cake. Exercise like crazy for two weeks afterward. :)

The cake layers were very easy to make -- they were nice and flat so it was easy to assemble, and the cake itself was delicious -- chocolate-y with a tender crumb, but not too dry. I used chocolate whipped cream frosting instead of the one here and the cake was just light enough to allow for such an airy frosting. Makes a very pretty cake.

This made one of the most successful birthday cakes I've ever offered. The cake was delicious -- light and moist. But it was the combination of that cake with the brown sugar of the frosting that is really special. At first I planned to make a different frosting because this combination sounded a little weird. But I'm glad I went with the brown sugar buttercream. Don't be discouraged if the frosting seems to come apart; keep mixing and it will come together. The combination of flavors in the result -- cake plus frosting -- is outstanding. The cake calls for a frosting that can stand up to all that chocolate, and the brown sugar in the frosting adds that edge that keeps you from thinking you're just eating butter. It served 10 very happy customers.

I agree with the other reviewers - the frosting is awful. I tried chilling some of the cupcakes after they were frosted..even worse. Tasted like cold, hard butter.

I wish I had read these reviews before I made this cake. I found the flavor and texture of the cake delicious but I'm sorry I made the brown sugar buttercream. Though I've made plenty of buttercreams before, this one took an unreasonably long time to come together, and tasted like just like creamed butter.

Well, the cake was only so/so in my book. I made it as cupcakes, and it did get better the next day, but this cake is only average. There are far better recipes out there for Devil's Food Cake, so I won't make this again. As for the frosting it is far too time consuming for something that just comes out tasting like butter. And talk about unhealthy! You might as well just take plain unsalted butter and smear it on your cake...that's what this tastes like.

This cake has a deep chocolate flavor and easy to make. The brown sugar buttercream complemented the chocolate flavor perfectly. Everyone loved it. I baked it in a 9"x2" heart shaped pan and placed chocolate shavings around the sides. Perfect for Valentine's Day. I will definitely make this again.

The cake part was so delicious. I will definitly make the cake again only without the frosting. When I was making the frosting it did look at one point like it was breaking apart but I kept on mixind it and it came together fine. Only when I ate the cake the frosting tasted to much like butter. Like I was biting into a stick of it! I ended up scrapping the frosting off and just eating the cake.

This is now #1 on my "standby" cake recipe list, replacing some real winners... I made only the cake, (haven't tried the frosting yet), baked it in a Bundt pan and dusted with powdered sugar. Rave reviews, but I can't say whether it was even better the next day because it was devoured immediately! Very tender with a fine crumb and perfect chocolate flavor.
