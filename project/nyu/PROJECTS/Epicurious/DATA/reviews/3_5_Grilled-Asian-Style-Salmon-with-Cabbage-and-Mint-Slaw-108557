This was delicious. I did a few variations though. I used half mint and half basil and added zest from one lime to the dressing. I roasted the salmon (along with lime slices) in the dish for 15 mins at 400 degrees; the marinade became more caramelized and better absorbed in the fish than if I had grilled it. I didn't make the cabbage salad because I had planned a side dish of stir-fried bok choy and shiitake mushrooms, but I would try the salad too in the future. Overall the dressing is very refreshing and I would try it on other dishes like stir fried veggies or grilled shrimp or tofu.

Best salmon recipe we've ever made. The mint did not sound good so we left it out. Substituted broccoli slaw for the Napa. Added some honey to the reserved marinade and reduced to a syrup drizzled on top when served along with an orzo pasta side. Truly exceptional!

This was tasty, but man did I think the salad needed more dressing! Also, could have used more heat, more ginger and maybe some garlic too. Refreshing, but not outstanding. I will make it again for a family dinner because it is so healthy, but probably not for company - tasted kind of like spa food.

Very tasty. My husband really liked it, especially the cabbage.

This recipe is delicious and refreshing for summer. I would not change anything except that I used low sodium soy sauce and did not add salt. The cabbage should be raw because the crunchiness balances well against the ingredients in the marinade.

It was good. Next time I might marinate the salmon a bit longer, maybe an hour.

This was a great dish. I used fresh cilantro instead of mint and it was delicious. I also doubled the sauce recipe. I would definately make it again. My family loved it.

I really liked this.. Simple, interesting and easy to make for one or multiples. Took me longer to eat it than to make it! Secong time around I threw a chopped scallion and a few red pepper flakes into the dressing.

this has become a staple in our house, it is incredibly delicious. I add chopped peanuts and toasted sesame seeds to the slaw; I also sometimes use red cabbage, and it's very pretty. Truly a groumet easy meal. The marinade works well with chicken, too. Wonderful!

2.5 forks. This is way too salty if made as directed; the soy sauce takes care of the salt and there's no need to add more. Apart from that, it's nice enough. I added chopped scallions to the slaw and they improved matters. Also took previous reviewers' advice and sauteed the cabbage first, but didn't use butter; I felt that the dairy flavor wasn't quite the thing. I used vegetable oil, with a tiny splash of light sesame oil, and sauteed the cabbage for two minutes, and all was well.

Just OK - there are better recipes on the site that are just as easy. The balsamic glazed and caper butter salmon are excellent.

This dish was not only excellent but super fast and easy. I will definitely make again. I took other's advice and heated the cabbage as well to soften.

I didn't have fresh ginger on hand, so substituted a little more than one tablespoon of dried ground ginger. My husband thought that this was the best salmon recipe I have ever made. It was so yummy! The fresh mint added the right touch to the slaw. Great Spring dish.

Followed the instructions except sauteed the cabbage with a little butter and olive oil before mixing with dressing to soften. All of the flavors worked well together.
