I had some serious doubts while making this. I doubled the dressing (keeping a reasonable amount of dill, adding a salt and pepper) like everyone suggested, but when I started tossing the potatoes in, it started to look like a bunch of vile goop. Fortunately I kept with it and after letting it rest and soak up the dressing for a half hour, the taste was really quite nice, and the appearance improved.

I thought these were very good and easy to make. Based on other reviews, I doubled the dressing but also increased the potatoes by a half. That ended up being a good amount. Note to only increase the dressing, not the dill!

I should of paid attention to the previous cooks; too dry and needed twice the dressing. Otherwize I'm sure it would be fine.

Make twice as much dressing as called for, as the recipe as is produces very dry potatoes. The taste is wonderful, however.

I absolutely love this dish. I like it best made with fingerlings, champagne vinegar, and coarse-ground dijon mustard, and if fresh dill isn't available, finely minced parsley is nearly as delicious. I'm sure it would also work well with nearly any other fresh herb -- thyme and tarragon both come to mind. Double the dressing ingredients and use half as a sauce for grilled salmon -- or add the salmon to the potatoes for a lovely variation on this simple recipe.

I first made this recipe when it appeared in July 1990. I keep going back to it every summer, so I consider it a classic.

This is a delicious low fat alternative to potato salads that are drown in mayo. I find I often use a little more dill than called for. Also, we dont have regular dijon, only stone ground mustard so I have to add quite a bit more mustard until the taste is right. Also needs some salt and black pepper, but with tiny modifications this is a staple in our house.

This is my new favorite potato salad recipe. However I made some substitutions. I use equal parts grey mustard and white wine vinegar. I added less oil to cut down on fat/calories, but if you like you can whisk in a tablespoon of sour cream to thicken. It is best if you let it sit overnight.

A decent, quick, warm potatoe recipe. I omit the white wine and add chopped parsly and green onions
