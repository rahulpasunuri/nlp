Delicious and great presentation.

With the warning from previous reviews, I added prawns and fresh sea scallops to the stuffing and used pearl couscous. I think these all helped to bring more flavor. But I think the item that helped the most was adding grated Parmeggiano-Reggiano. It added a complexity to the stuffing and also enhanced the creaminess of the pearl couscous. It turned out wonderfully and will try it again.

Should've shunned this altogether after reading the first review. Just salt and pepper can't possibly carry the whole dish. What a waste of ingredients including the beloved fennel and pine nuts.

It was just okay. People ate it, but there really wasn't anything distinctive about it- pretty darn bland actually. I almost added some raisins or dried cranberries to the rice, and I really wish I had. I can think of plenty of other healthy ways to cook fish that are much more interesting.
