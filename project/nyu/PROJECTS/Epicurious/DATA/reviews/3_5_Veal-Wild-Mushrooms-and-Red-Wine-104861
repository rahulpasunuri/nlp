I started making this recipe in 2010 and have been asked to bring it to a family seder every year since. I have made it with lamb, as well, which is good.

Yummy. Used Pinot Noir (that's what I had!)lots more onions and garlice, a veal brisket rolled, and cooked for more like 2 1/2 hours. After sitting for a few hours, reheated and it was fell apart at the knife when I cut it! Everybody loved it and it was a nice change from regular brisket.

I made this the day before and reheated in oven and it was perfect!! I added garlic with onions.

This is fine. Not anything to write home about. It was convenient to make ahead, and very easy, so fit the bill. My sauce was the right consistancy per the recipe instructions. I added more rosemary and thyme, and am glad because it would have been bland otherwise, I think. What I didn't like was the unattractive gray color of the sauce. Thank goodness for parsley to cover it up! I made the apple matzo kugel also on this recipe, and it was a great compliment to the veal dish.

I almost forgot to include this...I sauteed 6 cloves of finely minced garlic with the onions, and substituted red for white...feel free judge away for my changes...but post judgment please try the changes...it was wonderfully delicious

I added a ton to this recipe and made it with veal breast. Though not seder safe, I substituted corn starch for the potato starch. I also used a very high quality cab sauvignon (Darioush 2002). Instead of the spices recommended, I added fresh mint and parsley as the broth, post cab and chicken, was thickening. I also seasoned with fresh ground cinnamon, right before the broth addition. As the broth was simmering, I added 2 packets of splenda, though sugar will do (perhaps a teaspoon). Instead of veal stew cubes, I used a cut of veal breast. I also added a handful of raisins during the initial onion, carrot saute period. While I know these additions may have taken the recipe a bit astray from the flavor combination intended by the original, the dish came out incredibly well, especially in light of the fact that I was cooking veal..the broth was delicious and aromatic, and a must do again

I used a veal brisket. My seder guests all said they liked it, but I expected a certain 'richness' to the flavour that wasn't there. I made it the day before I served it, and perhaps expected the flavours to permeate the meat somewhat, and it didn't happen. I will try it again as written and re-rate if there's a difference; maybe in my haste to prepare this and many other dishes concurrently I missed something. BTW, it was annoying to see 'add garlic' when there was no garlic on the ingredient list; it's additionally bothersome when previous reviewers have made note of it and Epicurious hasn't corrected it yet.

This is the second year that I made this dish for Passover and it was a big hit both years. I think people enjoy it not only for the wonderful taste but because it's a nice change from the standard brisket. When preparing it, I mince 5-6 cloves of garlic and use a variety of mushrooms. While the recipe calls for 1 1/2 hrs. of braising, I braise the stew for 2 hrs. The result is veal that melts in your mouth.

The lesson I learned here was not to substitute chicken for veal. The sauce turned my chicken a sad shade of purple and although the taste was quite good, the presentation was rather purple. I also had a lot of trouble getting this sauce to thicken and think perhaps there was too much chicken broth in the recipe.

This was an amazing dish. Instead of cutting the veal into cubes, I was able to find a veal brisket, had the butcher roll it up and went from there. After the veal cooked for a few hours, I took the remaining sauce and let it cook on the stovetop at a low heat for a few more hours and it turned into a very rich, tasty sauce. This is a definite make again for Pesach.

I added dried porcini mushroom in the last step of this dish and added some additonal potato starch to the water the mushrooms were in because I too was worried the sauce was not thickening. This did the trick. Although there was something missing from the sauce that I haven't figured out yet. I used a different red wine than the ones suggested and maybe that threw off the taste. But it was a pretty good dish anyway. My guests liked it.

Everyone liked this - I added additional rosemary and thyme when I reheated it.

I totally disagree with the previous reviewer. I made this for our seder and it worked far better than I expected. I was worried that the potato starch roux would become gummy during the long braise, but it thickened up nicely and made a beautiful gravy. There was a deep flavor from the richly browned veal and mushrooms, and everyone loved it. The previous reviewer is correct, however, that the recipe does not specify how much garlic to add--I added four cloves, finely chopped, and that worked fine for me.

gravy too thin and not much taste, recipe did not mention the amount of garlic and directed users to add reserved twice.
