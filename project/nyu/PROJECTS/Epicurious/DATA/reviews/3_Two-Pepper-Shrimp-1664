My husband thought this was the best thing I ever made. I too used vermouth instead of the wine and the whole can of tomatoes to balance the onions. I also skipped the lettuce and served over angel hair. My guests were raving!

I agree that the bed of lettuce bit doesn't really add to it. I got constructively lazy and decided to just make the shrimp in the sauce and *instead* served it *over* the rice noodle dish that it's paired up with in the menu--made for an exquisite one-dish light supper. I used quite large-large shrimp, and I think that's the only way this works.

Oh man, my husband went crazy for this dish. I substituted cayenne for the crushed red pepper and put in the whole can of tomatoes. I added in steamed pea pods at the end and served it over egg noodles. It was pretty spicy, but we loved it. I'll definitely make this again.

I have made this dish several times and love it - as have all of the guests I have prepared it for. I even like it over the lettuce, keeps it light. I serve it with an Orange/Almond rice which compliments it very well. It's one of my "signature" entrees!

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I left out the lettuce and placed it over pasta. It was great and our guests thought it was amazing. This was also very simple to prepare.

I thought the shrimp was very flavorful. I do agree, that I would prefer it over rice or noodles rather than on lettuce and will probably do it that way the next time. I served it with a side dish of rice and sun-dried tomatoes and fresh thyme. It tasted better with this than with the lettuce.

This dish doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. The flavors don't seem to mesh; I wonder is it an Italian, Asian or Nuevo American dish? There are too many onions, not enough tomatoes, and the idea of placing it on a bed of lettuce doesn't make sense. This is, to date, the only Epicurious recipe I have been disappointed in.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish -- very tasty! The only change we would make is to reduce the amount of onions by about half.
