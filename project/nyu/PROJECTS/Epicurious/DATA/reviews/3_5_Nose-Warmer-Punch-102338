I made it for Christmas and ran out. Everyone loved it.

Made this last year for a holiday party, and am looking forward to having it again this year-quite a hit.

This is one of my favorite winter treats! It's a tradition at holiday time, everyone loves it. I make a single serving with one cup red wine, one tablespoon each brandy and sugar, half a cinnamon stick, three or four cloves and a half a lemon slice. Perfect on a cold winter's evening!
