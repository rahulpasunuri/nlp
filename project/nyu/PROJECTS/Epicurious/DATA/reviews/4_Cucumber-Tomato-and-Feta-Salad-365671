Fantastic cucumber salad! We loved it and though I was skeptical about the mint, it did enhance the flavor. We both had seconds ;) I made a half-batch, more than enough for the two of us!

Everything comes together perfectly in this salad, and the mint really adds depth. This would actually work as a summertime meal for me with some warm crusty baguette and a glass of Albarino. The only thing I changed here was substituting a very small amount of finely chopped shallots for the scallions since that was what I had on hand. Delish!!

My husband likes salad as a main dish so this one sounds like a winner. The ratio of ingredients is just right in this recipe for the best flavor, I think. It will be easy to serve this one for a church potluck as well.

Make this all the time! Sometimes I substitute parsley instead of mint. Also I use a little tahani maybe 2-3 tablespoons & olive oil. GREAT! A simple easy side dish.

delicious! i only had 4 persian cucumbers so i cut everything a little (and lot for the mint) i made it for a mothers day dinner and the whole family loved it and i've got a very ethnically diverse family (scottish and maltese, hungarian, filipino, cuban) so...winner! i will definitely make this again!

A great recipe. If you eat it right after you make it. the salad tastes lemony. If you let it sit for a couple days everything blends in and it is incredible. I would make this for guests anytime. Very nice.

I made it with extra mint and lemon. It tastes like summer in Greece.

My family loved it I made it exactly as written, but used feta & olives from the grocery store's olive bar rather than buy them separately. The mint made the salad.

Easy and healthy. I served it for our book club in little plates for an appetizer. I picked up the olives and feta already prepared in olive oil from the grocery store. Simple.

Great summer salad. I opted for oregano and it was a party pleaser. To reduce the watery possibility, I suggest putting the sliced tomatoes in a colander (tossed with some salt) to drain out some of the excess water prior to tossing them with the remaining ingredients.

Easy with clean flavors. With fresh summer produce and good olive oil this is a treat - especially when served with a good crusty bread and crisp wine. Definitely would make again!

Excellent salad. Quick, healthy and very tasty. I used oregano instead of mint but will have to try again with the mint. This salad would be great when it's very hot outside.

Excellent salad. Quick, healthy and very tasty. I used oregano instead of mint since I didn't have any in my garden. After reading how good it is with mint will have to make it again! This would be a great summer salad when it 100 degrees outside.

Awesome salad! Made it a couple weeks ago and my wife and family loved it. Going to make it again tomorrow. Great summer (out on the deck) salad!

This was a great recipe, perfect for summer! I couldn't find hothouse or Persian cucumbers at the farmer's market, so bought some small regular cucumbers and removed the seeds if necessary. The mint, scallions and lemon were nice touches to a basic greek-style salad. Leftovers held up pretty well for lunch the next day, but I wouldn't leave them much past that. Served with falafel for a nice summer dinner!

I love this recipe and the mint just makes it so much better!!

very very good salad. the mint is a nice touch. i didn't use fresh lemon juice but i definitely would next time and add a little zest. i originally thought about using red onions instead but the scallions had plenty of bite and didn't overpower the salad.

This was outstanding! I made it without the olives because I forgot to buy them, but the flavor was delicious even without them. To Pixelaki, who didn't bother to try the recipe but felt compelled to call out how wrong it is to add mint, lemon and scallions...who cares? This is billed as a cucumber, tomato and feta salad. It did not bill itself as a Greek salad. In my opinion the lemon and mint really made this stand apart!

Very nice, fresh taste.

Yummy. Simple, and fresh. Used chives and garlic scamps as I didn't have scallions and didn't want to do onion. Even better the next day.

I haven't tried this, but just wanted to write that Greeks wouldn't add lemon, scallions and NEVER mint/lettuce/dill to a Greek salad! Keep it simple and easy with: Tomatoes and peeled cucumbers cut in wedges, thinly sliced onion (sweeter onion is nicer), olives (don't bother pitting), feta, a sprinkle of dried oregano and sea salt, and a good few glugs of Q olive oil. Thinly sliced green pepper is an option. Don't forget fresh bread to mop up all the goodness (called pappara)! Good quality ingredients are what makes these simple Greek recipes sing (this salad is only good in summer)

Even better the next day. I used fresh oregano instead of mint (cause it was rampant in the garden) and it was divin. Delicious. A perfect balance.

Cool and refreshing side dish. Not a mint fan, so used fresh basil instead. Might toss in some avocado or chickpeas next time...

Super and simple. At the last minute I was afraid that I didn't have enough food for my party/picnic. I made this is at the last minute and was real pleased. The only thing I changed was that I removed seeds from cucumbers because a previous review said it was too watery. I was able to make salad 4 hrs before serving and it was great.

This salad was delicious, a great lunch item. I followed the recipe with one minor exception. I only used half of the mint listed in the recipe (I'm not huge on mint). I used a mixture of kalamata olives and a green olive that was stuffed with chiles. It added a lovely spice to the salad. Perfect for summertime veggies!

This was so good. only change I made was I used red onion as I didn't have scallions and dill because I prefer it to mint. really nice summer salad.

Boring. Not worth the time.

Delicious and refreshing. Dressing and the high water content in the vegies does make it runny. Just have to be sure to drain it if you have left overs.

Very easy to make, but most of all very tasty. Flavors were great and fresh, everyone enjoyed it.

Keep in the mint!!! It's not "minty" by any means, just adds a good dimension to the flavor.

We have always enjoyed the greek version of this salad, but the green onions instead of red, and the addition of mint made this a whole new flavor mix. This was truly one of the best, easiest salads I've made. So simple, flavors were amazing. Will be making this salad a lot! Would be perfect for a pot luck, too

This is called an horiatiki salad. Do not put the mint in it! Buy the best Greek feta you can get your hands on. You can leave out the lemon juice, too and use olive oil only. And add green pepper circlets ...

Excellent summer recipe. Cold, fresh, perfect. Will make this again and again!

Excellent version of this salad. I added the dressing gradually till I got the intensity of flavor I wanted--didn't need the whole amount called for. Very refreshing. I'll make it again

Very tasty. Left out the mint (hubby doesn't like it) but still really enjoyed the fresh flavors.

Whats up here? This is just a Greek salad with mint thrown in. It's good but not anything special. Although I did like the addition of the mint. I guess I have to say I'd make it again because I make Greek salad all the time in the summer.

Easy, awesome, pretty, & the Mr loved it. Made it to go with the yogurt-marinated lamb recipe from this month's BA mag. Perfect.

This is so fresh and delicious! I had cherry tomatoes on hand, so used those halved. Otherwise I followed the recipe, and added some dried dill weed. I'll be making this many times.

Not bad, but it tends to get watery if it sits once you've put the dressing on. I think I chopped my vegetables up too small, probably better by leaving them larger like the picture. Makes a ton! A bit work intensive with all the chopping.

This salad is fabulous! We paired it with Grilled Mahi Mahi with a a mango avocado salsa from the same issue and it was light and full of flavor. I am making the salad again on Memorial day and can't wait. We will have this often!
