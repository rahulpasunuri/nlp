This was a waste of saffron - I couldn't even begin to taste it. Also, is it really that hard to make risotto the traditional way, adding the hot broth/wine mixture a cup at a time? This dish was lazy, and tasted no better than an upscale TV dinner. What a waste of expensive asparagus and saffron! Next time I'll just make butternut squash and pancetta risotto - also on this site. I love that one!

This was a successful way to introduce my children to saffron--to learn to cook with it and enjoy dining on the results. We used carrots in place of asparagus to suit them. Sprinkling a few toasted pine nuts on top made it more of a main dish.

I have to agree with the cook from the San Francisco Area. I did not like it and I do like saffron. Unfortunately I don't know what it was... maybe just the combination. :(

I left out all vegetables and otherwise followed the recipe. Added the Tbsp butter at end. My husband loved it. Delicious and pure risotto taste!

I thought this was good. I didn't use the asparagus - I used mushrooms instead. And I also used very good Chardonnay. I think that is a must. I'm not sure why frozen peas were reccommended. Fresh is always better for a risotto. I am interested to try this adding sausage. Mmmmmm

I don't usually give a recipe 4 forks, but this one deserved it. Followed the recipe almost as written. Softened 1/2 cp. onion in the oil prior to adding the rice, added the liquid in the traditional way, about 1/2 to 1/3 cp at a time, and stirred in about 1 tbsp. butter at the end. Fantastic. Served with the apple dried cherry salad with the maple mayo dressing that is on this website and is delicious along with a good cibatta from the local Italian bakery and the rest of the white wine used in the recipe. I think the secret is in the seasoning at the end, using a good quality parmesano reggiano cheese, a good quality saffron and a decent wine. Thw tbsp of butter finished it off beautifully.

My husband has an aversion to peas, so I sauteed a variety of mushrooms and red pepper to add with the asparagus. Lent some great color to the dish, and he loved it!

I didn't like this at all. I'm not sure what was wrong--maybe I don't like saffron. In any event, it just wasn't worth the calories. What I did learn, though, is that you can make a risotto of decent consistency using the method they used, pouring almost all of the broth over the rice at once, and not having to stand over it and stir the whole time.
