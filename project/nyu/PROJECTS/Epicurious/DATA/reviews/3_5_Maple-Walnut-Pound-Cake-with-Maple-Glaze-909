The flavor was excellent. The texture seemed more like a quick bread than a pound cake to me. I didn't find it dry at all, but I took it out when there were moist crumbs on the tester, not when it came out clean. The only change I made was pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had.

I also wish that I would have read the reviews. My dad works hard making real Vermont maple sryup. What a waste. I did not use the fake flavor, but I knew that if I concentrated the maple it would have more flavor.

I should have read the reviews before I made this cake. It was very dry. I thought it would be a great addition to a ham dinner but it was a disappointment. I used twice as much glaze, some with just sugar & maple flavoring and it didn't mask the fact that the cake was way too dry.

This cake was great! It was slightly dry, but not that bad. I took the advice of two reviewers: I didn't add the whipping cream, and I put the glaze on the bottom as well as on the top of the cake. The glaze was gross! It was just butter! But, it is a good idea to put the glaze on the top and bottom--if it is a nice glaze.

This was dry as dust. Horrible. I've adjusted a cake mix with this recipe as a guide and it was wonderful, this recipe as written doesn't make it. Want more maple flavor? Eliminate that fake flavoring and use Grade B Syrup, boiled to reduce it by half so that you're using the same amount of liquid, but getting twice the flavor. Trader Joe's and Whole Foods carries it.

This cake was just delightful, I made it for both Thanksgiving and a friends birthday, it was a hit! I added a few changes though, first to decorate the cake I used more chopped walnuts on the top covered with powdered sugar. Then I served it with pumpkin, vanilla, and coffee icecream. I'll surely make it any time.

This is more like pound cake, and the glaze is a MUST. I added more lemon zest and thus had a nice lemon glaze. I glazed the cake with it, but most of it ran off! So I passed a bowl of glaze with the cake and everyone liked it. More of a brunch type cake than a dessert.

It had good flavor, but came out too dry. It sounds like the reviewer before me had a good solution to the dryness by glazing the top and bottom.

I made three changes to the recipe. First, I followed the advice of the cook from Seattle, and poured glaze on the bottom. But I also glazed the top, thus solving both the dryness problem and the maple-flavor problem. (Plus it looked good.) Second, I omitted the 'maple extract' from the recipe [none available]. Third and more importantly, I omitted the whipped cream from the glaze, and thus the cake did not require refrigeration (an important consideration at holiday time, when the fridge is full). I live overseas, and made this for a crowd of maple-loving North Americans and a crowd of those-who-have-never, and likely-will-never, taste maple again, and it was a big hit. Thanks for all the useful comments!

This cake is absolutely delicious! Would be wonderful for a brunch dessert or anytime. I added alittle more maple flavoring to the cake and the icing based on the comments that I had read before making this cake. My neighbor, who shared a slice, described this as a 'perfect cake."

This wasnt a bad cake-but it didnt wow me. I found it a little to dry even after reducing the cooking temp and cooking time. The top inch of the cake was yummy due to the syrup that soaked in-but the rest was just kinda there. Im sure there are many other better recipes to make

OK, here's what I did with the glaze: when the cake came out of the oven, I poked it with a fork all over the bottom (while still in the pan) and then poured the glaze on. Let it sit till cool, then drop it out of the pan. By making holes in the bottom of the cake, the glaze seeps into the cake, making the bottom rich, moist and slightly gooey. This worked really great. Also, I cooked this in a dark bundt pan and it was done in 45 minutes. Added more maple syrup than the recipe called for and no maple flavoring. Cake was still just a tad dry on top, but not bad, certainly not inedible! I ground the nuts pretty fine and also added a bit less than the recipe called for. Guests were asking "what's in this?!" while taking a second piece!

This was tasty, but I probably wouldn't make it again. I am an certified maple-freak, and it just wasn't maple-y enough. The cake was handily consumed by family and friends, but overall it wasn't a knock-out.

This cake was absolutely A-W-E-S-O-M-E ! Make sure you bake it for 50-55 minutes if you use a 12-cup bundt pan,otherwise it may turn out a little dry (as the other reviewers have noticed). Even though it may seem a little undone when you insert the tester,it will be moist and delicious once it cools. I love the crunchy texture the chopped walnuts add! The glaze was too runny (I doubled the recipe, by the way), so I added a little more powdered sugar and - my secret ingredient - 1/2 teaspoon imitation maple flavor. This will definitely be a keeper! Yummy!!!!

The cake baked beautifully and was easy to prepare. I baked it in a dark pan so I cut the temperature down to 325 degrees. The cake tested done in 50-55 minutes. Still, I thought it was just the slighest bit dry and the glaze needed more sugar, as it was runny. This cake and glaze had a delicious flavor. I consider it more a "coffee" cake, than a "pound" cake, because I didn't find the texture as dense as the pound cakes I usually bake. I will make it again, but will take it out of the oven, when a few moist crumbs still stick to tester.

Very yummy cake. Came out moist. I did not grind the walnuts very finely, left them in pcs to give the cake texture. Would definitely make again.

I loved this cake even though I made a big mistake on the walnuts. I ground them rather than chopping and it was still good. I would try the recommendation of a previous reviewer of increasing the powdered sugar in the syrup so it isn't so thin. Overall, it had a excellent yummy flavor.

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe almost precisely (I had no maple flavoring, so I just used a little more maple syrup, I used cold butter and beat the hell out of it), it was done in a hour exactly and moist and delicious! Although I made a double batch of the glaze according to the advice to previous reviewers, I found I didn't need to (maybe whipping the cold butter to fluff helped keep it moist? Who knows - I just didn't have time to warm it up any). Garnished with candied walnuts, this cake sold the most out of any other dessert I have ever made. It was wonderful! So many people asked me for the recipe...I suggest this to anyone at any time. It's definitely a keeper. :)

This cake is stupendous! Be sure not to overbake it. Start testing at one hour, and then every 3 to 5 minutes after. Mine would've been perfect at 1 hour and 10 minutes, but I let it go to 1 hour and 15 minutes -- a few minutes too long. The ground nuts in the cake tend to make for a drier (but fantastic-tasting!) cake. Next time I make it, I'm going to double the recipe for the glaze and put half of the glaze on the cake while it's still IN THE PAN, before it cools, then put the other half on the cake after it's cooled. This time I doubled the glaze (as one reviewer suggested), but poured it ALL over the top after the cake had cooled. I'll try using some hot glaze as a syrup next time, then glazing the cooled cake too. I think that would work like a charm to moisten the cake a bit. Still, this cake is too good to describe. Make it often! I will.

Taste good, but a bit dry as well.but I'll try again, cook less, and use more glaze/syrup. Made this again recently. Used one stick of margarine, and increased amount of syrup & maple flavor in recipe, and made a soaking syrup to put on cake when it was done. Texture was better this time, but tase better the first time.

This cake is a dense and buttery type of poundcake, perfect with tea or coffee. This cake also looks beautiful. The maple syrup adds a different but wonderful flavor not found in "other" pound cakes. I highly recommend it. Tastes great for several days too!

Lovely Fall dessert. My guests loved it. I think I overbaked it slightly (I was distracted by the phone at the last minute) because it was a little drier than i expected but i will just be a little more watchful next time. Perhaps serving a whipped lightly flavored cream with the cake would be nice.

For anyone who, like me, loves maple syrup and walnuts, this has an extraordinary taste. One of my favorite cakes.

Outstanding! Rich & moist. This has become my new favorite cake to make for birthdays.

This cake was absolutely scrumptious; a snap to make, and everyone adored it. I would recommend chilling the glaze a little longer to prevent it from being slightly runny.
