This recipe is truly a gem! I use it for Thanksgiving and for typical weekday/weekend meals and the family always gives it rave reviews. This is truly one of the best sweet potato recipes out there.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Next time I make this I will alter the amounts (more sugar and less apricots) and mix some pecans into the mixture. I loved the apricot flavor, but it is strong.

too much apricot flavor for me it seemed to overpower it-though a lighter option, i just prefer more of the sweet potato flavor. Good topping for sure.

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner and got rave reviews from 18 people. The apricots added a surprise flavor to the the sweet potatoes that gave them a very unique taste. It was almost like eating dessert. Also, the fact that it is pureed is a bit different and gave it a very fine, light, almost baby food texture. Definitely give these a try some time...they'll make you smile!

I have made this every year since it first appeared in gourmet 1994 and it's always a big hit with everyone. If I am going to someone elses house for Thanksgiving Dinner you can bet that I'll be asked to bring this dish along.

Great recipe. I've been making streusel-topped sweet potatoes during the winter holidays for several years. This is one of my favorites. The apricot addition is fabulous.

I've been making versions of this great recipe for almost ten years. For alternatives, try soaking or poaching the apricots in sherry or orange liquer, and/or a touch of vanilla. Friends and family seem to like double the topping.

I really enjoy making this recipe and have done so on numerous occasions!! I have discovered that when working on a limited time frame, one can boil the sweet potatoes until soft and microwave the apricots until rehydrated. It's virtually the same as the oven roasting method but half the time. I also added orange juice instead of the sugar.

This recipe was a huge success at Christmas dinner. A non sweet potato-eating guest went so far to grab a second-helping after dinner. I added a teaspoon and a half of pumpkin pie spice for a little extra zip.
