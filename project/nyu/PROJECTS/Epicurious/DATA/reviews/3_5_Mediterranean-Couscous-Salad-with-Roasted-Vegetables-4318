I make it with quinoa for a gluten free meal. I usually add mushrooms and always lots of red onions. Today I added asparagus instead of zucchini. I use whatever I happen to have on hand. The other day I used those little Italian eggplants. It is one of my favorite dishes. I love the capers and olives and balsamic vinegar and use way less oil. Only enough to keep the vegetables from sticking to the grilling pan.

After hanging on to the 1997 edition all those years, finally made this in January 2011. Love, love, love it!

Well worth it...easy to customize based on what is in your fridge. We omitted the olives + lemon but added sundried tomatoes and a can of garbanzo beans.

This is my new favourite salad. I couldn't find leeks so just added 2 onions. I love the combination of sweet roast vegetables and the sourness of the capers, olives and lemon juice. Fresh or roasted tomatoes would probably be a great addition. I'll try that next time.

This was WELL WORTH the effort. I followed the instructions and it came out amazing!

Best couscous I have ever made. Used Japanese eggplant, skipped the red pepper, used canned pitted olives. Used 1/2 homemade chicken broth 1/2 water. Decreased the salt by half. After couscous cooked stirred in the mashed garlic, then lemon juice/basil/caper mixture, decreased oil to 2 tbsp from 1/4 cup, added 3 tbsp chopped Italian parsley. Then gently stirred in the roasted vegetables.Do not need to cut up vegetables smaller than cut when roasted. Placed in large shallow bowl and topped with cut up rack of lamb.

Absolutely amazing. I loved this salad! I made it as-is and the only thing i think I'll alter is the cook time because the veggies were a little too soggy and I'd use flavored couscous to give it a little extra zip

Unreal! i love nothing better than an easy veg meal. this was fantastic! I chopped the veggies before I roasted and peeled the garlic. I did NOT add extra salt except when making the couscous as I knew I was going to add Bulgarian Feta. MMMM... sooo good!!! Was supposed to be for dinner tonight. Turned out to be my second lunch. DELICIOUS!

My frig was loaded with lots of fresh veggies and I needed to use several up at once. Found this recipe and since I keep couscous in the house I was good to go. Grilled yellow peppers, zucchini, and asparagus the day before along with a head of garlic. I did leave out the balsamic, not because of taste but because we just had the balsamic ribs from this site this weekend.(to die) Glad I did. Just lemon juice was perfect. I could eat this all day long.

I make this salad often - especially in the summer when the veggies are fresh from the farmer's market. As written it is great. I made it again last night with quinoa instead of couscous and a can of drained and rinsed chickpeas. Made a great vegetarian meal.

After completely screwing this recipe up, I tried again and followed the directions to a T. The result? It was too sour, between the basalmic vinegar in the marinade and the lemon juice in the vinegrette. Weight-obsessed teenaged sister tried to eat it, since it looked healthy, but didn't manage more than a few bites, and I actually had to agree with her. Next time will halve the basalmic and lemon juice. Otherwise, it was very good.

I won't rate because I ended up modifying so much due to lack of ingredients on hand and screw ups. I needed something different to do with the squash, green peppers and eggplant in the garden. This was a great idea! No leeks on hand but I did have fresh corn, so used that instead. I grilled the peppers and squash for speed and roasted the eggplant and garlic but forgot about it. Okay, no eggplant or garlic. Ended up throwing in some pickled jalapenos... And it still turned out really good! Conclusion: I would bet that actually following the recipe would be wonderful! I will be making this again and actually following the directions next time around!

My store didn't have eggplant or leeks in stock, so I used bell pepper, zucchini, asparagus, and cherry tomatoes. I cut all but the tomatoes into 1-inch chunks and roasted all of the vegetables and garlic together for about 30 minutes. The roasted tomatoes were an amazing addition. The vegetables got very sweet from roasting. I only used 5 garlic cloves, but could have used a few more, although 10 might be too strong for me. This was a big potluck hit!

I cant believe I almost didnt make this recipe! Its incredible  thanks to the reviewers I didnt miss out on this keeper. I put all of the vegetables except the eggplant in a plastic bag and added the oil and tossed them around and then added the eggplant and balsamic vinegar and scrunched them around again, then I just dumped the whole bagful in a large roasting pan. I moved the eggplant to the corners because that area cooks the hottest and I put the large unpeeled garlic in the middle of the roasting pan because thats the coolest area. The vegetables came out great. I was worried about some crispy leeks but they were fine after being moistened by the dressing. I took the tip to add a crushed garlic clove to the dressing and after tasting the finished salad I added a splash of balsamic vinegar which made it INCREDIBLE. This should be a master recipe for cooking eggplant. I dont even like it that much and I couldnt get enough.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. Use pearl couscous for a fantastic texture and add yellow zucchini for texture. The leeks are to die for.

The wonderful aroma of the roasting vegetables was making me crazy. I put one crushed clove of garlic in the olive oil used to brush onto the vegetables. Used 2 cups chicken stock (instead of the 2 1/2 cups water) for the couscous. I put the cooked couscous on a large platter and arranged the large pieces of veggies (I didn't cut them up as the recipe instructed) on the couscous. It was beautiful...and delicious!

This recipe was good, but not knock your socks off. I did add ground sausage, which added some heartier flavor, but it still came off as a little bland. However, I do think its a great starter recipe to add and experiment too - next time I will add more sausage and experiment with more spices.

I used pearl couscous. May be that was what it was suppose to be, but it didn't specify that. Anyway, the pearl couscous is the way to go with this salad. It stood up well against the roasted veggies. I used less oil in the dressing as there was more than enough in the roasted veggies. I agree that they didn't need to be roasted for 45 minutes. 30 would have been enough. I liked the lemony flavor of the dressing.

This is the best tasting salad! The roasted leeks really made it. I have made it a bunch of times.

This is the best couscous salad that I have ever tasted. I have made it many times for family and friends and it always gets rave reviews. Be sure to use fresh basil and fresh lemon juice - they really make a big difference in the taste!

As written, this is okay (provided you ignore the 45 minute roasting time, which is about two times too long), but the second time I made it, I left out the couscous and got a really terrific roast vegetable salad. I used less oil to make the dressing for the vegetables, of course. The salad was really good at room temperature or cold, and it was the kind of thing that costs a fortune at the gourmet deli counter.

After all of the effort, I actually found this rather bland. It just didn't have that much flavor in my opinion. It needed some umph!

Forty five minutes is way too long to roast the vegetables. The vegetables were mushy and the garlic was like rocks. This recipe took entirely too much time to prepare.

This recipe rocks! I used quinoa instead of couscous, chicken stock instead of water, mashed the garlic and wisked it with the olive oil lemon juice and used more herbs and garlic. In addition I served it with garlic, rosemary pork sasuage. Can you say yum, sure you can!

Great tasty recipe. A bit long to make, but worth it. Make sure you keep an eye on your veggies in the oven... 45 minutes is way too long, unless you want purée.

Good side dish for Indian food, although I used it as a main course. I used zuccs, asparagus, peppers and mushrooms instead, and it came out great. The yogurt sauce and chutney are a great addition to jazz it up a bit. I also added more curry powder, as I like my food a bit spicy. I am making the Herbed Lamb Burgers tonight to go with the leftovers, 2 great meals (hopefully!) 2 nights in a row!

I made this for a vegetarian friend's baby shower and everyone loved it (some of my friends don't like olives, so I would serve them on the side next time). It's more time consuming than it sounds, but worth it. I also used only 2 cups water in the couscous since that's what was called for on the box.

This is an excellent recipie that is always popular. It is a lot of chopping work, but well worth it!

Delicious and so versatile. I used onions instead of leeks and about half the oil (1/8 cup) and it was plenty. I roasted extra veggies and the next day, tossed them with the capers and olives, plus basil, feta, grape tomatoes and warm farfale pasta.

This was a big hit with my monthly cooking club. I used red, yellow, and orange peppers to add color. I also used chicken stock to cook the couscous for added flavor. I served it on a large platter and then placed shrimp skewers on top. Great for a large crowd or buffet.

Yum! Thanks to previous comments, I added more garlic (1 head) and reduced the amount of water added to the couscous (down to 2 cups), and everything was just right. This is definitely one of the best main dishes I've made off this website.

We did the vegetables on the grill rather than in the oven, and the results were excellent. Eggplant, zuke and leeks about 2-3 minutes per side, red pepper a little longer.

Someone in my cooking group made this! The roasted vegatables were served stand alone and they were wonderful! The couscous didn't turn out, looked more like a soup, but the vegatables are definitely a keeper

One of the best recipes I have found on Epicurious--and that's saying something!!! I followed this recipe pretty closely except to substitute chicken stock for half the water. The results are wonderful--the roasted veg and garlic make for a flavour reminiscent of truffles. It's going into the favourites file!

I love this recipe as does everyone I've served it to. Great at picnics since it's best room temperature. The only negative is that it's not the most colorful. Make it and enjoy!

I thought that roasting the veg in larger pieces, then cutting into bite-size afterwards worked very well -- nothing got dried out. I used 2 red peppers and added 2 yellow ones, which added some needed color. I also used two whole heads of garlic, which wasn't too much since roasted garlic is so mellow (I did leave the garlic in the oven a bit longer than the veg, though, to be sure it was very soft). The salad was completely devoured at a barbecue we held!

Loved it. Used carrots in place of leeks and eggplants as that was all I had as a replacement. It only took me about 30 min to roast all the vegies.

chopping the vegetables took time but it was well worth it. Very good flavor. Next time I'm going to use onions instead of leeks.
