Excellent dressing! I used white miso and halved the oil.

Definitely halve the oil, and it might be a good idea to add ginger and garlic to taste, not those exact proportions. I used two Italian eggplants and cut the slices into cubes after broiling, then served it all chilled. It was excellent!

Delicious! I used a regular red miso (dashi included in the paste) and a base of spinach and mizuna. I also broiled some red onion wedges along with the eggplant slices. My Japanese boyfriend had never heard of a miso dressing but he strongly approved.

I didn't have miso or rice vinegar. Instead I used one tablespoon soy sauce and ~2Tblsp rice wine. I used 1/4c oil. I cooked my eggplant in a wafflemaker! (cool huh?) Though the origial sounds delicious, my variation tasted delicious.

I used golden Yamabuki Shiro Miso since the recipe did not specify. I also used just 1/3 cup vegetable oil and even that was too much. The flavor of the dressing was very good, however. I served the dressing over eggplant only, no greens, since I had so many Japanese eggplant from the garden. I will definitely make this again.

Following the recommendations of other reviewers, I used only about half the oil in the dressing. It was really really good. The flavors of eggplant and dressing really complement each other well. Next time I think I will cut the eggplant slightly thicker as it seemed a bit dry after broiling. Only wish I had made the full recipe for the dressing!! Well, there's always another time...

We are stationed in Japan where the variety of miso is as abundant as canned soups are in the states. When I asked for help choosing one that would work well as a dressing, the grocer told me she had never used miso as a dressing. I made it for some Japanese friends, they loved it! I liked it better with fresh spinach, but the eggplant was good too. I agree with the others that the full amount of oil can be too much.

Adjusted the recipe - added more garlic and ginger. Also used 1/2 of the oil - seemed too much! Only cooked two small eggplants and tossed the eggplant with the dressing and placed on a small portion of baby spinach. With that, proportions seemed correct. Husband loved it.

We've made this twice and it was great both times. And I thought it was even good on the second day, cold - out of the fridge!

It was pretty blah when I made it exactly according to the recipe, but the dressing was good enough to make again - I would probably add more ginger, garlic, and salt. I would use baby greens, maybe some other ingredients but the eggplant added nothing to the recipe & I'd skip it.

I wanted to pre-prepare salad dressing for tonight so that I don't have to fuss too much when I get home from work. Made the dressing only, and it is absolutely superb. It's so good that I'm not sure it will last until dinner tonight! I like using grape seed oil in dressings - it's a very light, clean tasting oil. I used a little more ginger and garlic than what's called for too. ...YUM!

I roasted the eggplant and marinated it in the salad dressing for several hours before serving. I added about 1/2 tablespoon sugar to the dressing, and used ground cayenne pepper to taste instead of crushed red pepper. The salad was absolutely delicious! I will certainly make it again.

Great recipe! I came home late after work, and didn't feel like cooking. This was a snap to make and it tasted great today for lunch as well!

Nothing tastes better than fresh miso-ginger dressing (versus bottled). I bring the leftovers to work for lunch, and my coworkers are always stopping by to jealously look at my meal.

This is a great recipe! I tried it with my husband who doesn't like eggplants, but he loved this one. You can buy miso at any asian grocery store. Don't be intimidated to buy a whole package. It can be used for many great dishes.
