We love these -- I make this whenever we get slightly overripe mangos. I agree they aren't the easist to get out of the molds I have either, but I just turn the molds upside down, run some warm water on the molds, and they usually slip out with less fuss that way.

These are great...perfect for summer. I have store bought icepop moulds...but what do I have to do to them or the recipe to make the icepops come out easily?

Great recipe. The fresh fruit taste really shines through-- sublime. I made half the recipe to fill four molds, and used the strawberry margarita recipe for the other four, to give people the option. Guests were divided about which they liked more. Really a fun idea, one my friends seemed to get a kick out of.

This was a wonderful and surprise adult dessert. I served these at a cookout last night-the temp here was in the 90's-Everybody had such a kick from these popsicles. The flavor was wonderful!! Will make again-I have lots of mangoes on my trees and a great way to serve this treat.
