This was delicious with all the herbs and spices. I was going to cook it on a weekday dinner for two so I did do it differently. Mixed chicken with some cornstarch, Szechuan peppercorns (roasted and crushed), ginger, and garlic and let it marinate for about 20 minutes. Scattered them into boiling water and cooked until just done and drained. Spread cooked rice noodles on plates; sprinkled dry mint and cilantro, spread sliced carrots, mushrooms, and cooked cauliflower florets on top. Toped it with the chicken and green onions. Next time I might just marinate ground chicken and stir-fry it. The blend of flavor was marvelous and I would definitely do this again!

Terrific! So much fun with kids...we also did shrimp and beef tenderloin - another idea is to toss veggies (shiitakes, spinach, snow peas) into pot and make a soup at the end for everyone to enjoy.

This is fantastic! I don't cook often and this is a fool proof meal that guests adore! I also added a bit of lemongrass to the broth and mushrooms! Even if you aren't a great cook, this recipe makes you look great!

This is a fun dish to do for a small dinner party. The sweet and spicy dipping sauce is excellent. I also have offered prepared peanut sauce (Sun Luck makes a good one), as well as diced cucumbers, to give it more of a Thai taste. The leftover chicken broth makes a great base for homemade soup.

This recipe is easy, fun and delicious!! I have had friends request it again and again! I usually make more dipping sauce to ensure lots for everyone. We often will drop a slightly beaten egg into the broth at the end of dinner, and serve 'Egg Drop Soup' in mugs to finish things off nicely. One of our new favorites!

The flavour of this dish was excellent but the preparation needs some fine-tuning. I made this the first time my boyfriend came over to meet my parents. It didn't take long before the entire ordeal of using the lettuce as a wrapper was nixed in favour of picking up as many goodies as possible with chopsticks and trying to get it cleanly and safely to the mouth. I think next time I might use rice wrappers.

Half the fun of being American is appreciating hybrid everything -- including cooking. I went ahead and bastardized it some more. We live nowhere near any store that would dream of carrying cellophane noodles, so I used ramen instead. I cooked up a couple of packages and served them hot and steaming in the bowls. We used them to wrap in the chicken and later ladled leftover borth over them. I also cooked finely shredded carrots, onions and peppers in the dipping sauce. Added to the noodles with the broth it was an excellent -- and wholly American -- supper.

This recipe is definately the creation from some American cook. It appears to be the combination of Korean and Vietnamese.

I have made this several times for company and it is always a hit. I put the chicken strips on bamboo skewers before serving it(you can get a large pack of skewers at most grocery stores). Doing this ensured that no one had to handle the raw chicken and/or lose their chicken in the hot pot when it fell off of their fondue fork!!

I loved this, my fiance thought it was much too fussy, and hard to get enough food. We will serve it again but only as an appetizer. The sauce is excellent.

We loved the unusual flavors of this dish. The Asian flavored broth is an inspiration for other soups. I marinated the noodles in the sweet and sour dipping sauce for an hour before serving for extra flavor.

My wife and I had this for Valentine's Day--it was so fun, and a great way to interact and laugh. To keep the chicken cold, I put an ice pack under lots of ice in a large bowl, and spread the chicken on skewers over the top. The chicken stayed cold the whole time, and we stayed healthy. We enjoyed eating the broth afterwards: it was a great treat.

Recently, my husband and I got together with another souple for anight of Asian cuisisne where we would all participate in the preparation of the food for the night. This was one of the easiest and most impressive courses of the night. I would suggest that instead of everyone skewering and dipping their own chicken that the chicken be simmered in small batches in the broth and then placed on a plate and everyone helps themselves in a more sanitary way. Thanks for a great recipe that really impressed my friends!!
