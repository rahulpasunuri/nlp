Very good and easy. Made early in the day for a dinner party in the evening. Was a hit!

It's funny how you know how to make the most complicated dishes, but are uncertain when it comes to what seems like the most basic recipe. I am glad this was on the site because I needed it!

This whipped cream was just what I was looking for. Really yummy on the Open-Faced Fresh Blueberry Pie also on this site.
