I added 1/2 vanilla bean pod and deleted the almond extract. My hubby went crazy -- still basking in the glow

I won't buy pistachio ice cream every again. I made mine a little differently - actually cooked the 1/2 cup sugar along with 1/2 a vanilla bean with the milk and cream, added the pistachio powder, then tempered the eggs and added them as well and cooked until thick. I let it cool overnight in the fridge and strained it prior to adding to the ice cream machine. I too only used the 1/2 cup of chopped pistachios.

Forgot to mention - I did not use almond extract. Pistchio flavor is quite perfect, with a bit of vanilla.

Completely addicting - I think the recipe could use some changes, but the final product is still so good, I had to give it 4 forks. I found the ice cream didn't maintain a creamy consistancy when frozen. Next time, I will try using 3 whole eggs vs. 4 yolks. The salted caramel ice cream (which I make with similar ratios of milk to cream and calls for whole eggs) stays super creamy when frozen. I did use a little less than the 3/4 cup shelled nuts at the end -- there were still a lot of nuts -- but the flavor was fantastic. (I also used salted pistachios for both uses).

the best pistachio ice cream ever! i left out the almond extract and used salted pistachios (didn't rinse); added only 1/2 cup chopped to the custard (didn't toast first). love love love.

.....I forgot to mention that I used almond extract and vanilla 1/4 t. of each, I think the vanilla adds more flavor.

Just finished making this, and it is amazing!!! This recipe is more like a Gelato than an ice cream, quite rich but it leaves you with no sweet tooth craving. I replaced the sugar with Splenda and you would never know! It calls for unsalted (I used salted) pistachios, I rinsed the first cup of nuts and left the last 3/4 cup salted. The result was perfect, a touch of salty combined with sweet & creamy. Probably the best pistachio I have ever had Yumm-O I will make this again!!!!

Oops, forgot to mention that I put just 1/2 cup of chopped nuts into the completed custard, based on previous suggestions. Thanks, a great idea; 3/4 cup would be too much.

OMG, this stuff is amazing. The cooks who boosted the amount of almond extract must not like pistachios. I found that 1/2 teaspoon masked the pistachio taste. The second time around, I used somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoon and it was much better. I also let the ground nuts sit in the milk for a while before heating, and I'm not sure it added flavor, but it didn't hurt. I had salted pistachios on hand, so I used those for the ground nuts. For the chopped nuts in the ice cream, I rinsed the salted nuts very briefly and toasted them in the oven to re-crisp them. Again, not sure it made much of a difference, but the bottom line is that this ice cream is unbelievably good.

I, and the three people I made this for, found this delicious in spite of the foibles I had with it. On request, I added a teaspoon of ground cardamon to the ground pistachio stage. Good. Then I forgot to put in the almond (I get excited and did not lay things out how I should have), but the flavor turned out ok so I am not sure this was bad. Ran out of pistachios so it had no chunky bits (made this to use up some we had on hand). Mixed opinions. I'll have to do this again with the chunks of pistachios and see what happens... :)

Recipe is good however the almond extract overpowered the pistachio taste. I recommend leaving it out to get a pure pistachio taste. Left out the chopped nuts and just sprinkled on top when serving.

I followed the recipe except that I listened to everyone's suggestions to use a smaller quantity of chopped nuts, and I used salted pistachios because that's what I could find out of the shell. It was delicious -- creamy, a deep green color, and with a strong pistachio taste. I wonder why other people had such different results?

Too much sugar, too much chopped nuts, not enough pistachio flavor.

This was great, i reduced the whole nuts at the end and it was excellent. Thought the color from the ground nuts was nice, wouldn't add food colouring

really wonderful & easy! Confused by those who say it is a lot of work--can't they get shelled pistachios? I used super-fine sugar and I did add a pinch of salt; results were fantastic!

Absolutely fabulous! I didn't mind the ground nut texture, but my husband (who is the pistaschio fan) likes it creamier. I also added too many nuts, and that was a mistake. Who knew? I thought the more the better, but I was wrong.

I couldn't find unsalted pistachios, so I used salted ones instead, and the result was phenomenal. I actually think the bit of salt on the pistachios provided a delicious contrast to the sweet cream. This was an amazing end to a summer meal.

Wow, I just finished freezing this and couldn't stop eating the leftovers inside the cylinder. I added 1/2 cup total of toasted chopped pistachios and slivered almonds at the end, along with shaved dark chocolate. Delicious! Turned out a nice light green color without the addition of food coloring (yuck!). Beware, cooking the custard is a little hard to gauge because of the ground nuts, and the first time I over-cooked and made pistachio scrambled eggs. Worth starting over.

This dish was definitely a hit. I used the ice cream for a sandwhich (with brownies). Like others suggested, I let the custard sit overnight and only added a 1/2 a cup of pistachios the last five minutes of the cycle.

As other reviewers noted, I feel there were too many chopped nuts. I decreased the amount by about one quarter, and my guests still commented that it detracted from the dish.

I loved this ice cream. I pureed the pistachios finely and simmered them for 10 minutes in the milk. After straining the milk the result was a beautiful toffee color. Please, I beg of you, do not add food coloring. Who decided pistachio ice cream should be green? We don't make butter pecan ice cream yellow. I followed suggestions and added only 1/2 cup of pistachios. It was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

I made this with the chocolate souffles for a dinner party Saturday night. It was good, although I could have used a stronger pistachio taste. I wish I had looked for pistachio extract (if there is such a thing) instead of the almond. I also added food coloring, which helped, and decreased the final round of pistachios a bit. I couldn't figure out why the whipping cream would be added after the custard had been cooked, so added it to the pot as I do for all other ice creams. Very creamy.

As the two forks say, I liked this but didn't love it. If I should make this again, I would certainly reduce the quantity of chopped nuts. I felt I was chewing my way through the ice cream. I second the suggestions about using green food coloring.

Loved this! I will definitely make again. I served this with the warm chocolate souffles (divine), and if I were to pair these again I would add less than the 3/4 cup of pistachios, for a smoother ice cream, before churning in the ice cream maker.

Though not a fan of pistachio ice cream this was truly delicious - very smooth and creamy with lots of nuts. It is sort of a funny brown color, though, if you're expecting it to look like regular pistachio ice cream.

True pistachio ice cream - not the vanilla with nuts you find in the store. My only suggestion - add 10 drops of green food coloring.

Unbelievably delicious!!! The nuts in milk were scrumptious. Any ideas how to make that into a coating for fish?

Reviewer from 2/11 - do not give up. I make lots of ice cream at home and your problem is not special to this recipe. If the milk and egg mixture gets to hot (start to boil) you are in trouble and the eggs will start to "cook" and or "scramble" and then it is over. This ice cream is very very good. I have repeated requests and repeated raves.

I hate to be the lone dissenter, but this ice cream was a disaster for me. After adding the egg yolks and following the recipe exactly, the whole mixture seized up on me; the yolks curdled and the liquid separated. Maybe I goofed somewhere, but I have little use for recipes that walk such a fine line between great and disastrous.

Delish! Made as the recipe suggests only adding about one quarter teaspoon of ground cardamom gave it a subtle WOW. Nothing but raves and on my permanant list of favourite ice creams.

Outstanding ice cream! I added a few drops of rosewater since I was serving this with an Indian dinner, garnished with one rose petal. Everyone raved about it, rich, creamy, excellent! I would like to try substituting the pistachios for hazelnuts sometime...Oh, and the pistachios that are boiled with the milk make a great snack (my kids liked it mixed into plain yogurt).

This ice cream was a showstopper. Even the strained, discarded nuts were delicious! We will definitely make it again!

Wow! I prepared this for our Gourmet Group's dinner theme--Middle Eastern cusine. This dessert was perfect along with homemade Pistachio Cresents. I substituted salted pistachios kernels purchased from Sam's Club in a 2# bag. The sweet/salty taste was great, and complimented the creamy richness of the custard.

This ice cream was rich and creamy. All of our guests enjoyed it. The flavor was great! I would only add a half cup of pistachios next time. I wanted more of a balance between creamy and crunchy textures.

I chilled the custard overnight to really get it thick and cold. I folded in the chopped nuts after processing and added a few drops of green food coloring. Decadent!!!!

Wonderful stuff, worth shelling all of those nuts. We just got an ice cream maker, and this is the best flavor we have made. Because we had it on hand, we used extra cream- next time I will stick to the recipe because our variation was too rich.

Yum! I've made this twice already and everyone loves it. Great flavor though I did add a splash more almond extract and a Tbl more sugar. A definite keeper in my recipe box.
