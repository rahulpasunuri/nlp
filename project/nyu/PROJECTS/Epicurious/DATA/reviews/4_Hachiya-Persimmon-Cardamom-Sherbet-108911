Ground my own cardamom and used the 1/8th tsp; tasted great. I also used very ripe fuju persimmons from my tree that had gone soft and sweet. I have hundreds of persimmons every year, so I'll be using this recipe for when they get too soft to slice.

This was a good recipe; everyone enjoyed it. I ended up using 1 1/3 c almond milk (unsweetened) and 2/3 cup heavy cream and it came out fine, though I think it might have a tendency to get crystalline if kept in the freezer more than a couple of days. I don't know, because we ate it all! 1/8 heaping tsp freshly ground cardamom was good for me, but I'm a cardamom lover.

We made this as part of a Thanksgiving dessert and loved it. I used freshly ground cardamom and would probably use less next time, as it overwhelmed the persimmon flavor a bit.
