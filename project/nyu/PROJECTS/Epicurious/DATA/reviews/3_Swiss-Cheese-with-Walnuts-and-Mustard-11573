Sadly, this was a disappointment as well as a waste of 2 1/2 cups of good cheese. It is not an elegant presentation (rather like cheese-ball hash) and husband said he might have liked it had either the shallots or the walnuts been missing...with both, it's too many competing (and not at all complimentary) flavors.

Easy to prepare. Make sure to serve it at room temperature. I was thinking of warming it. Excellent with wheat crackers. I used fresh tarragon instead of dried.

This was easy to make and had a delightful flavor. The Dijon gave it a nice snappy taste without being overpowering. There were 7 of us, and lots of other dishes to choose from, but not one drop was left at the end of the get together.
