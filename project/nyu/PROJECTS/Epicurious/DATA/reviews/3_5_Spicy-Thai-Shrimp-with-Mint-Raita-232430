DO NOT use 1/4 cup of chili sauce as this makes the dish incredibly spicy (and we like spicy dishes). We wound up adding orange juice and honey to try and reduce the heat. Others are raving about this dish. I followed the recipe and was quite disappointed in the results.

My new favorite hot summer day meal!

Very tasty, I used 2 tablespoons of chili paste instead of 1/4 cup and it was perfect for us. Will definitely make again!

Excellent, used Panda Brand Chili Garlic Sauce instead, to great results. Also, the raita could use 2 teaspoons of lime juice and some salt.

I thought this was a GREAT recipe, as did the 2 other people who I made it for. Of course, I made a few changes (who doesn't?) I used less than the juice of one lemon, as opposed to the juice of 2. I also used less chile paste, but that was a mistake... the spicy-ness lessens after cooking. The raita was good, but I made it with cilantro (all I had in the house), and added some fenugreek, dried coriander, and salt. Honestly, we didn't think the shrimp needed the raita at all. I served it over rice and everyone cleaned their plates. It was easy, quick, healthy & delicious... what more could you want?

something about this recipe wasnt quite right to me. my sister ate it and loved it. i thought it was tasty enough but a little disappointing. i didnt use the whole amount of chili paste but i dont think that would have fixed the problem. i wanted this to be saucier i think. and next time i would add more ginger and garlic. there is a base to work from, but as it stands this isnt the most exciting of recipes. and the ratio of shrimp to raita is way off.

I think I must have read the recipe wrong, because this was so very spicy that we could not eat our dinner. We used Thai Chili paste..sambal oelek. I thought it sounded like it would be very spicy, but the reviews were all so good. a four year old ate this. We live in Texas and enjoy food that is "caliente" but this made our lips burn and even with the Raita, it didn't cool the palette enough. Sorry, we'll not make this again

OK, so here was my version of this recipe: I followed everyone's advice and reduced the amount of lemon juice in the shrimp by 1/2. (Warning: careful with the chili paste; it can get a bit too hot!) Next, I turned the raita into a side salad. I added a half head of cabbage, and made a dressing with the yogurt, unused lemon juice and white vinegar. I also doubled the other ingredients --cuke, mint, and green onion. Viola! A nice cooling salad/slaw. Served with rice, but mixed everything up on my place. Tasty. Granted, the only reason I used cabbage was because I had no idea what else to do with 1/2 head in my fridge! You could easily use other veggies.

This is a great dish! Even used frozen shrimp and it still tasted great! Definitely cut up everything ahead of time as everything gets thrown in the pan pretty quickly. I used the Thai Kitchen red chili paste and half the amount of lemon it calls for and my husband has asked me to make it 3 times!

Our 4 year old loved this recipe! He asked for seconds when usually it is everything we can do to get him to eat. I found the Mint Raita needed a little bit of sweetner and a tad bit of salt to liven it up. Otherwise, it was very good. The shrimp were great, but I think next time I'll use less lemon juice. And I served the shrimp with a little bit of basmati rice. Delicious. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Easy to make and absolutely delicious; especially when paired with the Spicy Napa Cabbage Slaw with Cilantro Dressing. I am definitely making this meal again.

What? Mint raita with Spicy Thai Shrimp. No way this is just not a good combination. This is not a review because I never attempted this. It is just a non-starter, period.

Very good, I added light coconut milk, about 1/3-1/2 can to make it more of a curry. Don't need the raita then although with a little less yogurt it was a good cool side dish.

This was good--we liked it with the raita. Served with rice.

The shrimp part was good and I serviced it over rice. I forgot to serve the raita and didn't miss it so you probably could skip the raita all together. I would add some more chili paste or cut back on the lemon juice too.

Can anyone tell me what "Thai red chili paste" is? I assumed it was Thai red curry paste, but a previous reviewer used Thai chili-garlic sauce, also known as sambal olek, and the two are quite different. Help!

It's really good, and I've made it a couple times now, but just be aware it makes a good amount of sauce once you add the lemon juice. If you don't have something like rice to soak it up, some of the flavor will get lost. The second time I made it I added probably half the lemon juice and it was quite good.

Definitely a quick, easy, and tasty meal. I used Thai Chili Garlic sauce and it came out great. There was a lot of sauce so I would recommend serving with rice or cous cous

I loved this recipe for the shrimp! I didn't make the raita however as I was looking to make roasted spicy Thai shrimp to lay on a bed of greens. I created my own rendition of this shrimp recipe by using the suggested garlic, ginger, sesame oil and olive oil... then I added 2 key ingredients: 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and lots of Sriracha hot sauce. I then roasted the shrimp in the over for 10 minutes under 400 F and then broiled for 2 more minutes under 500 F crisp up the shells. They came out so crispy you could just eat the shells!

I have made this recipe several times - the shrimp with red curry paste is delicious. The mint raita I only made once. The flavor wasn't quite right. I would pick a different raita recipe to pair with the shrimp.

I made this recipe for my girlfriend last night and we both loved it. The subtle flavor of the Raita is a perfect complement to the spicy shrimp. I went a little soft on the chili paste but definitely should have used the full amount.
