Great pecan pie - not too sweet thanks to the lemon juice. This will be our go-to recipe in the future. Used a different crust, though.

I used a great store-bought deep-dish frozen crust. I cut the recipe in half, but used dark brown sugar only and a mixture of light and dark corn syrup. Rave reviews from guests saying it was the best pecan pie they'd had: the bourbon made it interesting and it wasn't cloyingly sweet like regular pecan pie.

Absolutely delicious. Served this to a group of "foodie" friends and everyone loved it. They even asked for the recipe (which is rare with this group)!

absolutely delicious.

Hands-down the best pecan pie ever! The bourbon and the pre-toasting of pecans are essential and the amount of pecans. This results in the best pie with pecans throughout (as opposed to many pecan pies that have a layer of goupy sugar filling with only a few pecans on top).

I really liked the flavor of this pie. Crust also turned out well. Admittedly, my first homemade pecan pie -but still thought it was a great recipe!

I halved the recipe, but other than that made it exactly according to instructions. It was delicious, one of the best pecan pies I've tried, with a nice sugary crust on top, but I felt the bourbon flavor did not really come through. I might try it with more bourbon.

Best pecan pie ever! It was also super easy. Pecan pies end up being way too sticky-sweet. This one was rich and flavorful and sweet-perfect!

I make this pie for Thanksgiving every year. It is unbeatable. The bourbon and lemon are subtle and highly appreciated. I double the nuts because I don't like too much goo. Thanks to Trader Joes it is not to expensive either. Nuts always rise to the top, so doubling the nuts results in a better ratio for nut lovers. Toasting the pecans is IMPERATIVE. Save a cup of whole pecans to decorate the top. Make sure they are also dunked in the filling mixture. Enjoy!

This is our go to pecan pie recipe, and we live in Texas so it is a holiday must. It's the first pecan pie I can bear to eat, the toasted pecans and bourbon make all the difference.

Fantastic! My go-to pecan pie recipe. It is great as is, but I usually combine this recipe with the chocolate pecan tart recipe. I use a pate brisee for the crust and add a layer of melted bittersweet chocolate to the bottom of the crust. The combo of chocolate and bourbon is nice. That said, this recipe can stand on it its own with no alterations.

I make a chocolate bourbon pecan pie for the holidays every year, and have actually started freezing them and shipping them to friends as well. I use fewer pecans, but the 1/4 c of bourbon actually sets off the flavor, kind of like bourbon balls, which have a "boozy" flavor to them. (I usually make bourbon balls to serve as well.)

Great texture and flavor, reminded me of my days in Kentucky. I thought the pecans were a little too much and I like pecans. When I make this again I will cut back to 2 cups and hopefully enjoy the filling more. I gave the second pie to my friend Duke in Jacksonville who is form Louisville and he agreed that the flavor was great but a little too much crunch.

This recipe was excellent, and it was gone before the next meal. I will make it again and again.

I can't believe anyone would give this pie below 4 forks -- it is definitely the BEST pie I have ever ever tasted. I used a different crust but the filling was superb.

This is a recipe I have made at least 30 times. And every time, my guests comment on it being the best pecan pie they have ever had. It is my standard recipe now. No changes or alterations.

Terrific!! I did however use less pecans than the recipe called for and I only had light brown sugar on hand. I used Jack Daniels. It turned out great my husband ate 2 pieces and wanted more.

Add 4 cups of chocolate morsels to the filling if making two pies

leave the pecans, bring in some walnuts and add some chocolate, and make it more like a real derby pie.

Great recipe, very dense and it set up nicely during baking. I only baked the pies for 40 minutes. I cheated and used 2 regular frozen pie crusts.

What a waste of expensive ingredients! The lemon zest tainted the luscious caramel flavor, and there were actually too many pecans.

This was everyone's favorite pie at our thanksgiving dinner. We used a different crust, and forgot we had no bourbon in the house, so we used Grand Marnier instead. Everyone loved it, and we're making it again for New Years.

This pie got rave reviews from my guests at Christmas Eve dinner and would definitely make it again. Am curious though at what point should the whole pecans (which are seen in the pie photo) be placed on top of the pie? It is not indicated in the recipe at all.

This was a much loved pie at Thanksgiving, everyone had at least one piece, even at the end of arguably the biggest meal of the year! delicious!

Great pie! Lemon excellent touch. Bourbon a little strong. I will reduce bourbon slightly in the future.

Probably one of the best pecan pies. We added some Knob Creek bourbon to the whipped cream. So delicious.

My brother-in-law thought it was the best Pecan Pie he has ever tasted. He especially liked that the pecans are dispersed throughout the entire pie, not just on the top.

I love pecan pie but this was too sweet for my taste. Couldn't taste the bourbon at all. The lemon peel was very nice.

I made this recipe for co-workers and family and EVERYONE loved it! It's not too sweet and the citrus is a nice compliment. This is the best pecan pie recipe!

This was my first time making pecan pie. I used frozen pie crust and I only had organic light brown sugar from Trader Joe's so I used that for both cups of sugar. You can really taste the bourbon and the lemon zest. It was wonderful! I made it for a large party and everyone raved about it. Several people told me that they thought it was the best they'd ever had. I didn't think it was too sweet. I served it with fresh whipped cream.
