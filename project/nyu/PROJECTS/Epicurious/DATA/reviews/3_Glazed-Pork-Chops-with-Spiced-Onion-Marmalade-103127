I too did as kdbell and bbq'ed a 3.5 pound pork tenderloin indirect in my big old webber kettle. Be sure to use coal spreaders and center the meat over the pan of water under your grill. Don't lift the lid for the first 2o minuets, thewn turn. With a full stack of charcole coming from your charcole chimney pre-heater ( about 63 charcoles)I topped the meat with a vidial onion mash on added some wine soaked cherry wood chips 34 minuets in to the cooking process) This method produced perfectly cooked meat at about an hour in a 328 f webber. Enjoy.

I doubled the amount of molasses in the glaze and used a 3 pound pork tenderloin instead of chops. It was perfection. I made it for a special occasion and everyone loved it. I topped it with the onion marmalade (used vidalia onions), and it was a huge hit. Be careful not to over cook pork, perhaps that was the cause of previously negative comments.

We had high hopes for this recipe, but it smelled better than it tasted. It wasn't that good, even for a Wednesday night dinner. The only thing good about this meal is that it was quick to cook, about 30 minutes. We served it with the equally disappointing onion relish.

I'm glad I decided to try this in spite of some of the negative opinions. It turned out to be one of the best pork dishes I've ever had, which is saying a lot, because I don't particularly care for pork. We did pour off excess oil from the marmalade. Even though the glaze seemed kind of blah before cooking, the flavor really came out. Simple, elegant and quick (although we had to cook the meat about 30 min.). The pork was tender and juicy, not dry, and the dish has a lot of interesting flavors. In my opinion, needs to be served with something simple, because the tastes are strong.

This recipe is not worth the effort, in fact, this dish is so bad that eating these pork chops could almost make a person want to switch to a vegetarian lifestyle immediately!! I cannot imagine that someone would actually go into a restaurant and request this dish!!

This was decent. It didn't rock my world. We haven't talked about it since I made it and aren't desperate to taste it again. But it was a satisfying albeit not memorable dish. Who knows, maybe I'll make it again one day if the mood hits.

This was okay... surprisingly, we didn't care for the marmalade. The pork was okay.. would probably make the pork chops again (with the glaze) but not the marmalade. I didn't have any problem with the glaze falling off.. just didn't care for the flavor of the marmalade.

My family loved this! It's one of the best pork recipes I've found and I can't wait to try the marmalade on other meats. Some of the more negative reviews suprised me. I had no problem with the glaze "falling off" or anything like that. It was easy to make and tasted delicious!

Great recipe. The onion marmalade was wonderful, but I will use less oil next time I make this dish. I tried some of the leftover onion marmalade on some baked ham slices and liked it even better on this than I did on the pork chops. Will definitely make this again. This marmalade will most certainly be added to my menu file as a general meat glaze.

Wonderful dish--the marmalade is what makes this exceptional; its worth the extra time. The chops are quick and extra easy to make. I served this with baked sweet potatoes, fresh creamed corn and baby lima beans--a feast!

I used pork tenderlion and basted the pork every 15 minutes for 45 minutes. Then, turned off the oven and let it sit in the oven for 15 minutes longer. It was perfect. I love the spiced onion marmalade, it is exceptional. However when I make this recipe again I will use my favorite pork recipe, GRILLED GARLIC LIME PORK TENDERLOIN Gourmet September 1995, it also has an onion marmalade but I think I prefer the spiced onion marmalade. I have made the grilled pork for numerous dinner parties and I am always asked for the recipe. I can't wait to try this new combination. Also I thought the glazed for the pork chops makes a great cocktail sauce for boiled shrimp! Try it.

This recipe is fast and you can't fail with it. To point, I used regular yellow onions and red wine vinegar. No tomatoe paste on the shelf, so I reduced the brown sugar and used catsup. Everyone raved about it still. After clearing the table I realized that I had overlooked the garlic and everyone agreed that it was still the finest meal they have had in awhile. I also used dark molasses instead of the light.

Use more garlic, a good red wine instead of bourbon, and dark molasses instead of light--excellent glaze, but use it as a marinade overnight as well to get better flavor. I would use it on a tenderloin roast, not on chops again--baking the chops as in this recipe was a mistake as they got severely dried out even in the time specified. Let me also add that the onion mixture to go with this is _horrible_ and I will never make it again.

This recipe was so-so. My glaze slid right off the pork chops during baking. The Spiced Onion Marmalade perked up the chops a bit; if I make the onions again, I will add less oil and play around with the spices.

My husband really liked this recipe. I was surprised when he liked the marmalade so much. He is a meat and potato sort of guy. I loved it too, and it was easy to make.

This was absolutely scrumptious! The Glazed Pork Chops were very good, but the Spiced Onion Marmalade was to die for.

I made this outside on the grill instead of the oven. It was outstanding! The onion marmalade was a great compliment, and very easy to make.

This was an excellent recipe and fairly easy to make. I turned the chops once while baking even though the recipe didn't say to turn them. The marmalade was really, really good. I plan to try both the glaze and the marmalade with a pork tenderloin.
