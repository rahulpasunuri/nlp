This Pico de Gallo is tasty, but not spicy. I will add more jalepeno the next time I make it, and probably some avocado as well.

ok but bland - added more garlic and a serrano chile too

The best pico de gallo recipe I've ever made. Mt husband loves it so much he eats it alone as a relish. I've made it several times and each time it's great.

Easy and delicious with the addition of minced green onions, and a few tablespoons of a spicy tomato juice. Excellent for a side condiment or with chips. Pico de gallo is supposed to be somewhat watery. Any time you add salt to tomatoes, it's going to produce liquids. It only adds to the flavor.

This is absolutely wonderful! I served it with a simple Mexican salad and grilled chicken.

Really yummy! Very important, use plum tomatoes or roma tomatoes as called for, if you use the more common beefsteak variety the pico de gallo will end up very watery.

This was a great recipe, but I found it a bit runny. I did drain the tomatoes after chopping them, but I think in the future that I will also drain off the lime juicke after the mixture has had a few hours to marinate in it. Because fresh sweet corn is SOOO good this time of year, I cooked an ear, the cut the kernels off of it and added it to the salsa. Yummy! A great dish.

This was so delicious, an excellent addition to black beans with rice, fajitas or as a base for salad dressing. Very easy to make.

As a brit I didn't know what to expect as I'd never heard of this before, but found it very tasty and enjoyable. It was very easy to make and definetly makes a good accompaniment to Beef Fajitas (also in recipes) and I had a great meal!
