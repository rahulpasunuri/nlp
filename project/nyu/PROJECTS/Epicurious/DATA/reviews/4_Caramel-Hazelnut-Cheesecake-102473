I had a completely different experience to previous reviewers which I read before I embarked. I make cheesecake often, my recipe calls for cream so I was concerned at the absence. made the mix and baked. It puffed very early and set quite crumbly. maybe our cream cheese is different. I would try again but at a lower temperature and bake for 35 mins only. The butterscotch sauce turned out perfectly. Its not tricky, you just have to be patient and let it boil for a while and turn a rich golden colour. When it has reduced, take off the heat and let it cool. As this does so it will thicken. add the cream, stirring vigorously. Return to heat and boil up. It was lovely and saved the cheesecake which was disappointing.

LOVED this recipe! I didn't give it 4 forks only because the caramel sauce didn't turn out at all. I resorted to a recipe I've used before (classic sugar, butter, and cream formula). I used toasted pecans in place of hazelnuts for the crust. My guests raved about this cheesecake. Definitely the best I've ever made. Didn't bother with a baine marie, and it still turned out beautifully.

This has to be the best cheesecake recipe I have ever made! It was super simple. I couldn't find enough hazelnuts so I used pecans instead. I made for Mother's day and my mom (and dad) went crazy over it! The crust tasted like pecan sandies. yummy! The caramel sauce wasn't hard but a little time consuming. It was definitely a delicious recipe. I recommend anyone to try this recipe! Delicious!

This is one of the best and most requested cheesecakes I have made. The sauce is fun to make! Just try a little patience. It really is worth the effort. The crust is outstanding.

I too had trouble with the caramel sauce. The 1st time I overcooked it (very bitter/burnt taste) & the 2nd time I used less cream and it was still too thin! Next time I will use a jar sauce.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe -- it looks fancy when you're finished but really isn't difficult at all to prepare (with the exception of the caramel, should you choose to make it from scratch.) I tried it the first time with hazelnuts and it was alright, but since then I have made my variation using sliced almonds and it is wonderful! The almonds are much easier to grind into a delicious crust and the toasting definitely makes a big difference. All my friends and family say it's the best cheesecake they've ever tasted (and they've had a lot of cheesecake!)

This was one of the best cheesecakes I have ever make - got rave reviews from all my co-workers. Light texture and great taste. The hazelnut crust was wonderful. Making the caramel sauce was a liitle more time consuming than stated but worth it!

I thought this cheesecake recipe was good but I have made others that I prefer. I had some difficulty with the sauce. It tasted delicious but never thickened too much even after sitting in the refrigerator overnight. I used pecans in the crust but didn't find it to be that interesting. The chessecake part came out great and was easy to make.

Wonderful cheesecake!!! And extremely easy to make as well. I used the crumb crust with grounded hazelnuts instead of the plain hazelnut and used dulce de leche for the topping. I halved the recipe and made 2 tiny cheesecakes. Everyone gobbled them up. You might want to make the a couple of days ahead, they taste much better 2-3 days later.

Quite easy to make, this was the first cheesecake I have ever made, and it came out excellent. I made every thing from scratch, but I did forget to toast the hazelnuts, but it did not affect the crust. I did think the sugar in the crust was a little grainy, but overall, an amazing treat.

Chopped hazelnuts around the edge of this cheesecake look like a border of stars against the caramel sauce! Very sophisticated. My husband the cheesecake connoisseur really liked this.

This was an excellent cheesecake. I cooked it longer than the recipe suggests, but it ended up a little uncooked in the middle. It was still great, though! I used store-bought caramel sauce to save time. I also used pecans instead of hazelnets. The crust really sets this one apart. Can't wait to make it again!

I made this for a small Thanksgiving party and was extremely pleased with the recipe. (I even found myself stashing a slice for breakfast the next day!)

I made this using pecans, instead of hazelnuts and it was fabulous. I made it for a large family dinner and everyone RAVED about it. It also looked wonderful---professional, even. My father was extremely impressed with the presentation. (I used pecan halves around the edge as a decoration.) My father-in-law didn't eat it the night of the dinner, but had a piece the next day. He called me and said, "This is the most spectacular thing I've ever eaten." The only caveat I have is that it took a little longer to bake than the recipe says. I think I left in it the oven 10-15 mins. longer. By that time, it had set around the edges and was just starting to turn a golden brown on top.

EXCELLENT! I forgot to pass the extra caramel sauce and everyone still loved this cheesecake. I used 4 packages of reduced fat cream cheese and it didn't change the consistency at all. You have to watch the first step of the caramel sauce as it boils. I let it get too dark and had to start over.

This recipe is simply delicious. I love hazelnuts, and am always looking for recipies to use them in. I will definitely make this recipe again and again and again!

I agree with the first review. This was excellent. To save time, you can use prepared caramel sauce (a good brand) to save yourself the sticky mess that making your own caramel creates.

I made this for some friends at work, and it was gone in an instant. I should have made two. I had trouble finding hazelnuts, so, I substituted walnuts. Pecans would probably work also.
