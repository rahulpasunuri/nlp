I do the potatoes in the microwave. Find it better to brown in large skillet with evoo, sea salt and pepper. Flip and when browning sprinkle generously with balsamic. Flip several times to caramelize evenly. Creamy,sweet,salty,smokey, vinegary potatoes. Delicious!

Boil the potatos unpeeled, just wash and rinse very well before boiling. They will not fall apart. Potatos are fully boiled when a knife inserted comes out easily. Don't smash too hard :-) The skin gets crisp and tastes wonderful, the inside will be rich and creamy.

We were just in Mexico with friends - they bought a bag of Yukon Gold potatoes- I made these potatoes the first night and they insisted I make them 3 more times. I cooked potatoes in microwave then let marinate in olive oil, rosemary and lots of garlic for at least an hour. Did cook on foil on the grill.

I haven't made these yet, but think that baby yukon potatoes would be a better option. Also liked one comment about adding paprika and parmesan butter with a little garlic powder. It sounds from reading the other comments that one would have to be careful not to over boil the potatoes.

I really liked these. Top grade olive oil before and after grilling. Lots of salt & pepper

SO disappointing! I loved the concept of this recipe, followed directions exactly, and I was not able to adquately "smash" a single potato! Maybe my potatoes were too new/too old or I just don't have the magic touch. Ended up having to dice the entire lot and make Nigella's incredible roasted potatoes with semolina.

I agree with most other reviewers, these were a bit bland. The idea of it is original and I'm always in search of different things to do with potatoes. I may try again with some spice added.

Tried these tonight and was disappointed with the result. Tje outside was crispy but the potato didn't carry much flavour. We'll try it again hoping that it was just the potatoes we used.

Like other reviewers, my potatoes fell apart a bit. I wouldn't have minded that, but the overall flavor was a bit bland, and I even added crushed garlic to the tops with the oil and rosemary. Something was missing. But I must say they looked great on the table! I probably would not bother again.

I loved the idea of this- but mine did not really crisp up on the grill- Next time I will use the suggestion of the reviewer who put hers in a 500 degree oven. Hopefully that will work out better for me. The recipe is simple however, and a great alternative to roasted or mashed potatoes

As an alternative to smashing the potatoes, just halve the potatoes after boiling, cool, brush with oil mixed with a pressed garlic clove, and they will come out almost exactly like the recipe--crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. You don't have to worry about them falling apart, and they won't fall through the BBQ grates. :-)

Tasted good, and good as leftovers. But smashing was a bit messy and some of the potatoes fell apart.

This was a big hit with my family. I grilled half of the smashed potatoes one night, and saved the rest of them for a second night. Will definately make them again.

These are wonderful. Easy, tasty, and delicious. They are creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside.I microwave the potatoes instead of boiling them. Haven't had the troubles with the potatoes falling apart. Small potatoes work best. Try other fresh herbs on them.

This recipe was terrible. If you fully boil the potatoes as directed the potatoes fall apart. I could not put them on the gril and ended up turning the mess into my usual smashed potatoes. Very disappointing. Would be willing to try the recipe again but I would undercook the potatoes a bit to see if that would help them stay in one piece.

This did not work out at all. I was very careful about not overcooking them, and they "still" crumbled like crazy - nothing special. I put a layer of tin foil on the grill and cooked them that way.

Great tasting! Will make again.

Over-boiled the potatoes so they were too soft to put on the grill after smashing. Instead, put on a baking sheet and put in an already hot (500 degree) oven. They crisped up perfectly on the outside and were delicious. The group (incl. the kids & baby) gobbled them down. A nice change from regular roasted, baked or mashed. Will definitely make again.

These are FAB...be sure to watch them while boiling...they don't take 25 min. I took them out at about 15. They worked perfectly on the grill and I grated a little parmesan cheese over the top of the warm potatoes. They were a huge hit...a great mix of crispy/soft. Will definitely make these again!

O.K. I know how to boil potatoes. I also used little yellow ones not the red. I put them right on the grill and turned out perfect. But I used from July 2001 from Bon Appetit called grilled porterhouse steak with paprika-parmesan butter. (my 3rd summer to grill this).I made these potatoes with the olive oil marinade from the steak. (also made the paprika-parmesan butter). Did not use fresh spices. Just from the spice rack. Also dashed in some sugar and garlic powder. Left the extra marinade on the table to dip. With the porterhouse of course.

The end result is good, and yes, it's easy, but 25 minutes is way too long for boiling the potatoes. I'd pay attention more to the directions, "boil until tender" than the time. I'm kind of pissed that my potatoes came out of the boiling water too soft, and I only cooked them for 20 min. I just did what I could to keep them from falling through the grates. And I don't have a grill pan.

Fantastic and easy. Don't worry about them crumbling. I used a grill pan.
