This was great. I used 2/3 the noodles and could definitely use less next time. I tried to add some of the mushroom soaking liquid to the stir-fry for additional flavor

Great way to use up cabbage - the cabbage wilts down significantly. Used only 1/2 pound of pasta and substituted bow tie pasta for the Chinese noodles! Left out mushrooms. Used dried ginger, about 1.5 T. Added one can of great northern beans, for extra protein, at the end. The sliced hard-boiled eggs and extra cilantro were very good. My husband loves the sauce and this dish.

I see this as a recipe with alot of potential, and I am looking forward to making it again, next time using 1/2 lb. noodles instead of the whole pound, and using at least 5 cups of the napa cabbage.

I substituted parsley for cilantro, fresh crimini for the dried shitake, and used fewer green onions. Delicious! Served it for a Chinese New Year ladies' luncheon and the ladies loved it! Filling, not fattenning!

I made this dish with ordinary green cabbage, cooking the cabbage for about 4 minutes before adding the scallions. I also used fresh shitakes, cooking them separately for about 5 minutes. The cabbage was crisp tender, and the shitake meaty. My husband and I found the flavor combinations delicious.

We all loved it! I made the following changes: -Used rice noodles, due to a family member's allergy. Soaked the noodles first, then stir-fried them with the garlic etc. -Per previous reviews, added the cabbage @ the same time as the green onions so that it wouldn't get "mushy." -Again, per previous reviews, added peanuts. Yum. -Used fresh shitakes. I made it earlier in the day and added the garnishes & peanuts at the last minute. I highly recommend it!

I've got to disagree, I didn't think the recipe was all that amazing. Maybe I used the wrong noodles (azumaya asian noodles) or over cooked the cabbage (I followed the directions on the recipe) but it was overly mushy and not particularly tasty.

Really good. Refreshing and light.

Followed the recipe and it's a very tasty dish. May ad more napa cabbage next time because it really shrinks down when it wilts.

If I could have rated this 6 forks, I would have! I love this recipe and can't wait to make it again. This will be something I make monthly - and I don't do that with much. As always, I changed a few things in this recipe to make it my own: Instead of using dried mushrooms, I used fresh shiitake mushrooms. Also, I just went ahead and used powdered ginger instead of fresh and it worked great (just in case you don't have fresh on hand). Also, I didn't use eggs at all, but instead, I added cashews. However, in the future, I do plan to add the eggs for another dimension. But the most important thing I did to this recipe to make it excellent was I added a couple good healthy squirts of Thai red chile sauce to the mixture to give it some heat. And finally, I served this noodle dish WARM, not chilled. I followed the advice of the last reviewer from CT and served it with the hoison chicken, chopped up on top. It was an excellent noodle bowl you can curl up with on the couch and go to town with. Did I mention I love this recipe?

Divine! Delicious exactly as written - I served sliced "spicy hoisin chicken" breasts on top, so it had enough kick; otherwise I would toss in some red pepper flakes. I, like others, used fresh (crimini) mushrooms because I had them and they were great. I also omitted the eggs, and instead mixed in and topped with lots of chopped peanuts. Truly delicious served hot or cold, and I cannot wait to make it again. I halved the recipe and it was just enough for two people -- too good!

Excellent! Used fresh soba noodles, fresh shitakes, at room temperature. Thank you for the numerous suggestions re adding chili sauce. Served with Martha Stewart's Asian-marinated roast duck, but this would go well with any plain meat. Can't comment on the quality of the leftovers - there were none.

Overall I loved this recipe but did do a few things differently. I had fresh shitakes so I used them. After reading earlier reviews, I doubled the amount of cabbage and could have used even more -- I prefer a higher vegetable to noodle ratio. I used 1/4 cup of toasted sesame oil rather than 1/3 cup of regular sesame oil. Also added some hot chili oil to heighten the flavor without making it spicy. Yum.

Yummy! It did need a kick, though. I cut back on the sesame oil to 1/4 cup, added more rice vinegar (1 1/2 tbsps), and added a teaspoon or two of chili oil. Also have made this with baked, marinated tofu instead of eggs and if I don't have enough dried mushrooms, I will add fresh ones.

This recipe and the ORZO SALAD WITH FETA, OLIVES AND BELL PEPPERS recipe comprise my room-temperature pasta recipes for hunting trips, football games, picnics. These recipes do not taste like pasta with salad dressing!

#1. cook the cabbage less time. it gets too soft. #2. this recipe lacks a "kick." I added some thai chili sauce and it was just what was needed.

Very nice. Followed the directions to a T. Added more mushrooms. Nice flavor and my husband like it. Served it at room temperature

Although the flavors were great, I thought the texture would have been better if the cabbage had not been cooked. It became soft and disappeared in the dish. I added shredded raw carrot at the end to add some crunch and it helped.

Mmm... wonderful. I served this at room temperature with grilled Swordfish steaks. Used extra shiitakes because I am obsessed. I might add more ginger next time because well, ginger is just such a winner.

Delicious! I made some modifications based on what I had. I used 3 broccoli crowns cut into florets instead of the cabbage and cooked it just till it was bright green along with the mushrooms, garlic and ginger. I only had 2 scallions, but the taste didn't suffer. Because I used broccoli instead of cabbage, I substituted rotelli pasta for the noodles because of the size of everything. That way you'd get pasta, mushrooms and broccoli in every bite. I would also recommend adding a little chili garlic sauce to the dressing recipe to spice it up a bit.

This was yummy. We served it with the Korean rib recipe from the same issue. This noodle dish is very tasty. I used fungus instead of shitake mushrooms. I don't like the taste of shitake. The fungus gives nice texture and color and has no taste.

Excellent recipe, it was better the next day.

This is a delicious salad. I served it room temperature along with Korean Ribs (not the recipe in the same issue). I did not find dried shitake's so I used fresh ones and just added more than the 12 specified. My guests for dinner asked for this recipe.
