I made these green beans as a side dish at Christmas and it was a fresh, delicious take on a green beans salad. It's easy to make, and the outcome was great.

Followed the recipe ingredients exactly. Experimented with cooking methods. I split the cooked beans beans and blanched/shocked half in ice water as recommended. The other half were added warm to the vinaigrette. In a taste test, everyone agreed the batch that had been blanched tasted "brighter", more flavorful. I agree. Going into the experiment I really thought the ones tossed warm would be better, more blended. They tasted good, just not the winner!

Very good! Easy! I've made this recipe and a similar Gourmet recipe that also calls for hazelnuts and flax seed oil. The two ended up tasting very similar, so I would go with this one since the ingredients are less expensive. Great with summer corn and ribs.

Well, I loved this green bean recipe! I made the beans a day ahead because I was concerned that marinating the beans with the other ingredients as soon as they were cooked could easily overcook the beans. (Ugh!) The recipe was delicious as written, and everyone at the picnic gobbled them up. Thanks again, Epicurious!

I usually like my green beans cooked with a little bacon for a smoky flavor, but this was a really nice change. Living close to South GA, it's easy to get sweet vidalia onions and fresh green beans which are, I think, key to this dish. Served the beans slightly chilled (fresh out of the ice bath). Very enjoyable side dish.

The only word I can find to describe this recipe was "blecchy". However, I followed one chef's advice and instead of submerging the beans in an ice water bath, I mixed them while warm with the vinaigrette so as to merge the flavors. The result was very limp beans with no flavor. I will make this again per the recipe's instructions to see if the result is any better.

Just made this for dinner, my BF and I loved it! I didn't have any parsley in the house so I used cilantro instead and I added sauteed mushrooms. Like some of the other reviewers, I served it warm instead of putting the beans in an ice bath. We will defiantly be making this again.

This was no good for my family! My BF said it wasn't very good. And his friend threw up!! Sorry this didn't work for me!

I just thought this was okay. Not bad, but there are other green bean recipes on here that I like better. My husband thought it lacked flavor.

EASY AND DELICIOUS Did this recipe to the letter and it turned out great. Make sure to cook the beans in smaller batches so the ice water stays cold enough to stop the beans from overcooking. I accidentally let my first batch overcook by two minutes in the pot, then threw all the beans into an ice bath. This didn't help since the heat of the beans took over the cold water. I gave that bag away and re-did the beans right. DEE-LISH!

I don't know why, but this simple dish seemed so much tastier than it deserves to be. One of the best green bean dishes I've ever had. I didn't do the ice bath on the beans--just tossed them with the vinaigrette while hot and served immediately, which was fine. In fact, I think that was a nice way to take a little edge off the raw onion and also help the vinaigrette permeate the beans.

Served this dish with the corn and tomato scramble and lemony potato salad (no mayonnaise just a little olive oil) and everyone loved them together.
