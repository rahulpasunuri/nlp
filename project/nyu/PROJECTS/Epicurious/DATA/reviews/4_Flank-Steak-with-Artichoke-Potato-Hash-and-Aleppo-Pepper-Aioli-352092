We skipped the hash but loved the steak and especially the aioli, get ready for some crazy dreams though!

Worth the four forks for two things: 1. the technique for cooking flank steak (when grilling isn't possible) - easy and it was perfectly cooked. 2. the addition of artichoke hearts to potato "hash". We used canned (no frozen even available) and the combo with tiny potatoes (the wee little ones from Trader Joe's) was very tasty. The aioli is lovely (I made homemade mayo to start) but without the rest, it is only a 3 star recipe.

Whole Spice.com in napa is a great source of Aleppo. Its listed under Chili Aleppo on their site, and is rather affordable. Its a uniquely delicious & unique spice, that if your inclined, I highly recommend. The substitute sounds good, but is a far cry from the unique sweet smokey heat of the aleppo. (If you do find it, or already love it- try it as a warmed marinade with olive oil, garlic, s & p for shrimp. marinade 24 hrs, grill. squeeze some citrus... delicious!)

The 4 stars is for the steak and aioli portion; the hash was good on its own, but worked very well with the steak and aioli, which both had major zip to them. I made the recipe as written (had Aleppo pepper on hand), except for the use of frozen artichokes hearts. Using them made this dish super simple. The steak and aioli were outstanding, although I don't believe you need that much olive oil in the aioli. Makes it too thin and more like a vinaigrette. Aioli is basically flavored mayo, so it should have that consistency. I'll definitely be making this dish again with or w/o the hash component.

Thanks Penntex for the aleppo pepper substitute. It's fun cooking with new ingredients, but I don't need to be hiking the mountains of Afghanistan looking for some obscure pepper.

I did not make the aoli, as had some leftover steak from a Mario Batali recipe, which was already marinated and flavored with herbs and garlic. But the hash is great! Quick and easy when you use frozen artichoke hearts (trader joe's), but have to start with the potatoes. Cook in butter and oil with a shallot or garlic until nicely browned, add frozen artichokes, small amount of chicken broth, cover and cook for five minutes. Uncover, add the cream, turn to med-high and reduce until all is carmelized. Top with your steak, some parsley, and enjoy!!

The steak and aioli are both tasty, however, the hash is nothing special.

I absolutely love the flank steak and aioli. I make it with ancho chile powder and then use the left over aioli on burgers, with pickeled red onions. Delish!

The sauce was amazing! simple but delicious. however the potato hash brought down the recipy. I found it to be very plain and boring and not worth the effort. Scrap the potatos and cook the meat and sauce!!!

Incredibly good - I use this to impress company! Aleppo pepper is an issue - I found a guide that suggested a mixture of 1 part cayenne to 4 parts paprika as an excellent substitute. The Aioli is marvelous - we use it with dense fish steaks like tuna, marlin, or swordfish as well as with beef. Fresh baby artichokes are hard to come by in small town America - I used canned baby artichokes and adjusted the preparation of the hash accordingly.

Delicious! The aioli was my favorite. I followed their substitution recommendation for the Aleppo since I had none on hand. I thought it was just fine. Pretty affordable to make and not too time consuming, I'll do this again.

This recipe goes straight into the repeat file. No aleppo (created the substitute, but will look for the real deal). I have to say that nothing makes me happier than a steamed full-grown artichoke, but I've never had a good experience with the babies. That said, I substituted frozen -- didn't take away from the complexity of flavors, and one less prep step.

I'm from Aleppo, and our red pepper really adds a nice flavor to all kinds of food. Try it with salads, it is great...

Oh, and I agree that the Aleppo people was worth picking up at the store.

This was delicious. I almost didn't make it then at the last minute decided to give it a shot. I am so glad that I did. The aoili was so amazing I wanted to (and perhaps did) lick my plate!

This was really wonderful. The aleppo pepper was worth the trip to the specialty spice store-it was much better than chipotle chile pepper. I served it with a simple salad of mixed greens with balsamic vinaigrette and store bought bread for an easy but special week night dinner.

This recipe is outstanding and the aioli is the star. As mentioned in other reviews, it could be used in so many other ways as well. Really great flavors. I used the leftover steak, aioli and some provolone and made paninis which were fantastic.

Maybe I just don't like artichokes (little to no experience with them prior to this recipe) but this meal was just too rich, too garlicky (the aioli) and too lacking in contrast to be really enjoyable. It was quick and relatively simple to prepare but we should have ordered pizza.

A really nice dish. I used frozen quartered artichokes with great results. I agree with caponironi that the aioli is truly a star. I made it with sweet smoked paprika since I didn't have Aleppo pepper. I also made extra so that I could slather it on sandwiches and pretty much anything else--it made the BEST coating for a grilled mozz. cheese sandwich on Tuscan bread. mmmmm.

This reminded me of a great tapas dish from one of my Favorite Tapas restaurants. High marks for such little effort. The Aioli really complemented the steak.

This turned out well. Couldn't find baby artichokes, so I used regular artichokes. They were kind of a pain to deal with (choke, etc.). When I make it again I will substitute canned artichokes in water if I can't find baby artichokes (no choke). I also couldn't find the aleppo pepper. Regular chili powder worked fine.

This turned out well. The baby artichokes weren't available yet, so I used regular artichokes and they were a lot of work to deal with the choke, etc. If I did this again I would buy canned artichokes in water and I don't think you would lose taste.
