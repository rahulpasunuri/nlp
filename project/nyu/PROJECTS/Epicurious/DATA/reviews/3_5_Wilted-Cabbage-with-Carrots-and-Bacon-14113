We didn't care for it. (Made exactly as written.)

This is really great. I was looking for a good cabbage recipe to go with corned beef. I have never really liked putting all the veggies in with the cooking liquid because every thing ends up tasting the same. This is perfect!

I thought this was good. I used olive oil rather than bacon in order to make it a bit healthier, so I think the flavor may have come up a bit short. Others seemed to like it more than I did--I think the bacon was it!

Great side dish. Will try next time with keibasa (polish sausage) as main dish. Not too low cal., but really favorfull.

I used savory cabbage and a really smokey bacon and kept it tender crisp. Even my husband who hates cooked cabbage like it.

I've made this twice so far, serving it as a bed under roasted fish (salmon and cod). The flavors and texure work well with the fish and it makes a great one-dish meal.

Delicious. Always love the combination of cabbage, onions & carrots, and with the addition of bacon, it's even better. Thinly sliced the carrots, instead of grating & it was fine. A definite keeper.

We made this with cilantro instead of parsley, and reduced the amount. It worked very well; the flavors blended nicely.
