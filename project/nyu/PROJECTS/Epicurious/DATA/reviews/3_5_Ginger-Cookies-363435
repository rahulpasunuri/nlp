The aroma of ginger cookies in the oven will put you in the holiday spirit. Definitely chill the dough, cookies rise better. We cooked the first half for 19 minutes and they cooled to the consistency of hockey pucks. 15 minutes was better but still a little too snappy. Dipping in apple cider is not advised. Next time we will try cutting the flour by 1/4 cup or using brown sugar to see if we can reach a softer cookie. Overall, they are snappy, spicy, and good.
