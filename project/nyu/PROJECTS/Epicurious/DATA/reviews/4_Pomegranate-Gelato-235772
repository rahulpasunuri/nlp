The flavor is delicious, but I would not call it gelato, but ice cream, with the emphasis on "cream." It's too heavy on the cream for me. I wonder if you could use more whole milk and less heavy cream. Like others recommended, I passed on the pricey PAMA and instead used a reduction of POM with some Vodka. If I make it again, I'll definitely replace about half the cream with whole milk.

Love it, except for the chalky taste which I assume comes from the cornstarch. Does anyone know if I can eliminate the cornstarch all together?

This is one of my standard Ice Creams. I make this multiple times a year.

Incredibly good! I've made this many times and will continue to do so. I've only just recently gone so far as to buy Pama in order to follow the recipe perfectly. Until now, I've used Pomegranate Syrup (also called pomegranate paste or molasses, found in Middle Eastern, Armenian and Iranian groceries as well as Whole Foods) with a shot of vodka instead. It's not better with the Pama.

I made this tonight for a family dinner tomorrow, I didn't have the pomegranate liquor so used a couple of tablespoons of mandarin orange vodka I had on hand and made up the rest of the liquid with more juice. I whisked the sugar and cornstarch and slowly added the liquid while whisking and had no lumps at all. The finished product is absolutly delicious! Threw in some grated dark chocolate like a few others suggested and plan on serving it in waffle cones. I will definately make this again.

Ok, I haven't made this yet but will review after I do, but for people getting lumps just combine the cornstarch and the sugar very well and then slowly add milk while whisking. You shouldn't have to worry about lumps at all.

Mild flavor, not too sweet and very refreshing. Followed the "A Cook from Los Angeles tips" and got good results- Used mango-pomegranate juice instead of straight pom, reduced mango-pomegranate juice by half and use mango run for the other half. Added a pinch of lemon zest but didn't add vanilla. I didn't like the pomegranate seeds as a garnish. Instead I squeezed some juice from the fresh fruit right over the bowl, and also added a champagne clementine compote. Very nice contrast.

Other than adding some bits of good dark chocolate, I followed this recipe exactly. Everyone loved it and I will make it again.

Very good. I didn't have pomegranate liqueur, so reduced 1/2 cup of POM juice by half and added vodka to make 1/3 cup of "liqueur". Added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and a pinch of orange zest to brighten the flavor. (And do be sure to mix the cornstarch in to part of the cold milk and then pour into boiling milk misture while stirring continuously - no lumps)

This stuff rocks - it is so easy and so delicious. I tried this recipe and mixed in dark chocolate drops in hopes of duplicating my favorite Haagen-Dazs ice cream bar and it blew Haagen-Dazs out of the water. Like many others, I mixed the cornstarch with the cold milk prior to whisking it into the warm cream and waited until the mixture cooled before whisking in the pomegranate juice. I didn't have pomegranate liquor so I just used half vodka and half juice for the 1/3 cup liquor, that worked really well. To make the dark chocolate chunks, I melted bittersweet chocolate with a little cream and a little vodka at 20% power in the microwave and then plopped the mixture in big drops on waxed paper and chilled it until firm. The vodka and cream help keep the chocolate soft so you're not biting into brittle chocolate shards when the ice cream hardens.

Pretty good, but I was expecting a stronger pomegranate flavor. We decided it tasted more like black cherry. I did use Pom brand juick and Pama liqueur.

Lightly grind Columbian coffee beans and sprinkle on top before serving. Wonderful contrast to the creaminess and sweetness of the gelato. Fabulous!

I first made this for dessert for Thanksgiving, & it was phenomenal! Our guests raved about it & even had seconds! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers by straining the mixture after removing it from the heat but before whisking in the pomegranate juice, pomegranate liquer, & lemon juice. I also used POM brand of pomegranate juice to get a gorgeous purplish-pink color. The garnish of pomegranate seeds made the dessert exquisite. So simple & elegant!

Many thanks to previous reviewers for their suggestions. I did mix the cornstarch with some of the cold milk together first, then added to the warmed milk/cream mix and didn't get any lumps. Also, I used the Pom brand juice and let the cream cool about 20 minutes before adding the juice, and it stayed a beautiful pink color. It is very refreshing and tart...a good dessert for people who don't like overly sweet things.

Wonderful recipe! But I substituted grape juice for the pomegranate juice, and Port wine for the liqueur. It was terrific.

I agree with earlier comments that many brands of pomegranate juice turn what would be "a beautiful bluish-pink color" into a light brown. If you can't get your hands on POM brand juice (as I couldn't), try chilling the milk-sugar mixture after boiling first and then whisking in the juice and liqueur. The heat of the milk seemed to shock the color of the juice from red to brown.

I never add comments when I haven't made a recipe, but I do have a suggestion. I've read that many people need to strain the mixture because of the cornstarch. I've never added cornstarch at the beginning of a recipe. Try using the gravy method, put the cornstarch and some of the cold liquid in a jar and shake it til smooth. Add it to the cream mixture after it's warmed and it should thicken without the lumps.

Fantastic recipe! Used Pom and strained, added mango liquer and cut up some a dark chocolate bar. Next time I will double the recipe because this amount isn't enough.

This is amazing. I've made it a few times and will concur with others that Pom and straining is the way to go.

This has become one of my favorite go-to desserts. Creme de Cassis is an excellent alternative to the Pama for a variation on the flavor.

Delicious! Followed another reviewer's recommendation to strain the cooked cream mixture prior to adding the pomegranate juice and Pama. This is similar to Sheer Bliss' ice cream, but a fraction of the price. Add finely chopped or shaved chocolate at then end of the freezing process for the ultimate dessert.

I made this recipe using Pom juice and Pama liqueur. I agree that the mixture should be strained as there were small lumps in mine from the cornstarch. I will remember to do that next time and I think I will be much happier with the results. I can't complain because I had only compliments on this recipe and it was my first attempt with my new ice cream maker.

I made this twice. The first time I made it with pomegranate juice from Trader Joe's. The color was an awful brown. The second time I made it, I followed a previous suggestion to use Pom brand. I cooked it down some to intensify the flavor (I like it on the tart side). I came out beautifully!

This was the first recipe I used in my new ice cream machine. I made it for Christmas dinner and it was wonderful.I followed the recipe as written. One note is that I did have to strain the milk mixture because the corn starch got a little lumpy. Everyone who ate it, loved it. Its smooth and not heavy despite its use of heavy cream and whole milk. I highly recommend this recipe and I will certainly make it again.

I've made this twice. The first time it was very good, but the second time it was outstanding. I bought pomegranat juice at Whole Foods, some super duper pure pomegranate etc etc, but I wasn't happy about the color - it seemed diluted. When I made the mix, instead of a pinkish color it was a brownish color, and although it had a pleasant flavor it wasn't what I remembered from the first time. So, I went and bought a bottle of Pom brand juice, and because I didn't want to water down the mix I took a cup and a half of the Pom juice and boiled it down to 3 tablespoons. I added it to the mix and OMG. I made a double recipe because I knew that it keeps better than most home made ice creams, and I'm so glad I did. I didn't have a drop left at the end of my dinner party. I'll use the same method next time. People just couldn't stop eating it.

I attempted this gelato last night, but burnt the cream mixture fairly badly, even though I whisked my heart out and was using medium heat on a gas stove. Is anyone else having this problem? Are people using a double boiler? thanks!

Very good and lovely color. I used extra juice and no liquor. I didn't feel like shelling out the money for a bottle of liquor just after the holidays. It turned out very well though I can imagine a more intense flavor with the liquor so I will try it in the future.

Excellent Recipe. I substituted the pomegranate liqeur w/ 1/4c. pomegranate molasses & a splash of Bacardi Limon to equal 1/3c. It punched up the flavor without being overwhelming.

This is fabulous. I didn't have pomegranate liqueur, so I just added the same amount of pom juice and substituted lime for the lemon juice. I took it to a party last night, and people just couldn't help themselves.

This was delicious! I didn't have any Pomogranete liqueur, so I used raspberry liqueur, and it was still great. Next time I will try to find the pomogranate though.
