The best pepper corn sauce - and very easy. Really don't need to change anything about it. If you are going to make this with the pan fried steaks - a nice touch is to flame it with a healthy dose of cognac or brandy for the final minute or so.

YUMMY. THe green peppercorns were a bit hard to find but SO worth it. This is great. I froze the extra sauce and served it over a roasted prok tenderloin later. It was even better the second time!...... bitterendive.blogspot.com

This sauce was very good. This sauce, minus green peppercorns, is usually served with a black peppercorn crusted filet for steak Au Poivre. Note that if your using a low sodium or acutal beef or veal stock, you will have to add some salt to finish.

delicious, but almost too rich for us. We made pepper crusted the steaks for added kick. YUM.. next time, I'll switch out the garlic mashed potatoes (another recipe from this site) for something a bit lighter

Although the sauce did not thicken as much as I would have liked it to it is absolutely delicious. I have also frozen the leftover sauce and have used it again and it was still delicious

We made this for a second time this year for Christmas Eve. Big impact for very little work. Like another reviewer, we started with good quality demi-glace rather than reduced beef stock. Made all the difference in time.

YUUUUUMMMY..... this is SOOO GOOD and EASY!

Rating: 4
Wow - so easy, fast and shows gourmet. My sauce thickened beautifully - and surprisingly, given the other reviews. And given other reviews, I tweaked the process a little: grilled lamb in butter in cast iron pan, removed lamb for another meal, added shallots & butter for two minutes, added broth and reduced on high for maybe 7 minutes. Nearly boiled down to a syrup before I caught it, it was so fast. Keeping it hot, I added cognac & peppercorns, then heavy cream. It's so thick and delicious! Great for our Bordeaux dinner tonight.

This was very good, however I added one and a half tbsp of beef demi-glace (I doubled the recipe) and it made all the difference! Served over a Chateaubriand with roasted rosemary potatoes...yummmy!

Pretty Darn Good! 2 Tbl spoon peppercorn a bit much for me (and I love pepper)... Suggestions: Deglaze the pan with the Cognac for a few seconds...Worked time magic by reducing the broth to 1/4c rather then 3/4c as called for... which shaved down the boil time to thicken sauce.. Mine only took 15 Mins!

My husband has great faith in my ability to replicate his favourite restaurant dishes! This recipe hit the mark. To better release the green peppercorn flavour, I mash some of them in my mortar and pestle before adding. Marsala is my usual substitute for cognac--just what I have on hand.

Great sauce, but takes forever to thicken! Use heavy whipping cream, it helps, but I'm not completely sure I've ever been able to let it thicken as much as it should be. It's a game of patience I guess.

Make sure you taste this before adding any seasoning. I found it to be incredibly salty. Try and use low sodium broth if possible.

Rating: 4
Oh, one thing I forgot. Sometimes I make the sauce by starting with a cube steak (just for the sauce, then I give it to the dog). That way I can separate the cooking of the steaks from the cooking of the sauce to limit the timing variability.

Rating: 4
Everything the previous reviewers wrote is true...this is absolutely delicious. It did take much much longer to reduce, and later to thicken into a sauce than the recipe indicated, so plan ahead and wait for the applause!

I've been making this dish for many years-- it's our New Year's Eve/wedding anniversary/any special occasion meal. Rich, but decadently good.

Rating: 3
This was delish. The only changes I would make next time is to reduce the peppercorns to 1 Tbs...we all thought 2 Tbs was too overwhelming. For those of you who couldn't find brined peppercorn, can be found in the same area as capers in the grocery store.

Excellent recipe and super easy. Spinach or roasted root vegtables go very well with this dish. This sauce can be prepared alone without the steaks. I made it for my parents and now have to make them the sauce every time i visit.

I have added this to my list of "to impress the guests to no end" recipes. I prefer to add the peppercorns into the broth during the boiling down stage as I really like the sharpness and spice. However, even if you do not do this it is a wonderful recipe and I would highly recommend it.

One of the best sauces I've tasted!

Rating: 4
Best steak sauce ever! I've made this for dinner parties and everyone loves it. I grill the filet mignon so I only use the sauce recipe. I agree with other reviews that it takes a while to thicken but it is well worth it. You want the sauce thick enough that is doesn't just run off your steak. I use the dried green peppercorns and it works great. I've also used brandy and cognac and I don't taste much difference. I stick with the brandy now. Get some great steaks and give it a shot.

Rating: 4
I made the sauce to serve with a whole beef tenderloin we prepared on the grill. I cooked it in a saucepan, so it took about 90 minutes to thicken. I also added 1 tlb dijon mustard and 1 tlb brown sugar to deepen the flavors. It was absolutely delicious.

Rating: 4
This was the best peppercorn sauce ever! I had a couple of mods though....we were bbq'ing the steaks, so I just made the sauce in advance (using a saucepan). I doubled the amount of sauce and used it for six people (though I have some leftovers). The only caveat is that I found it took a lot longer for the sauce to reach 'sauce consistency' (like 40 minutes of boiling). It wasn't an issue, because I made the sauce in advance, but it is worth noting. I have a crap stove though, and less 'burner' area than I would have had with a skillet. Overall, the sauce is amazing!

Rating: 4
Excellent and super easy! I don't normally have shallots readily availible, so I used minced onion and it was still very good. Also, I used dried green peppercorns, not the ones in brine, I placed them in the beef broth and let them simmer in it for a bit. I'm sure it'd have a bit more peppery kick, so I added a bit more freshly ground black pepper to compensate. This sauce can also be used for other cuts of red meat, including game.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful and easy recipe! Make sure you use Butter to cook the filet mignon. The cream sauce is 5 forks! If you are a sauce person make double. Sauce will thicken, have a glass of wine.

Rating: 4
This was easy and yummy. Came together easily as a last-minute menu choice. Prepared as written. My only issue was that my local market did not have peppercorns in brine, just peppercorns in vinegar. I don't think they're the same thing, and the vinegary taste was present in the peppercorns, which was a little wierd.

This receipe was delicious, I would make this again, I live in Spain and the cream purchased from the supermarket was cooking cream, the sauce was thin, next time I would try and find a thicker cream, but the flavour of the sauce was excellent.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe, the flavor was spectacular, but it didn't quite reduce the way it should have, I think in retrospect...try adding a little flour to the sauce to help it thicken.

Rating: 4
A wonderful recipe. A shortcut: After reducing the stock I added the cream and cognac and reduced it all beforehand. Later, after the steaks were cooked, the sauce was ready in a few minutes. Next time I'll save out the cognac to flambe the steaks before removing them from the pan. But any way you arrive at it, this sauce is great.

funny how the only one who couldn't find success with this sauce was the "professional" chef! I had no problems, reduced it a bit further than t;he 3/4 cup of broth. Then you just need to be patient. It will thicken. Flavor is great!

Rating: 3
I don't think a beginner cook should make this, the sauce does need to be manipulated, and if you don't have any tricks up your sleeve, it might not turn out that good. I found there wasn't enough sauce, and would double it. It was also too liquidy so I added a tiny bit of cornstarch. I'd like to try adding some garlic as another chef recommended below, but not his suggestion of Irish Whiskey! Mama Lucian! You can't substitute Congac! Overall it was very good.

Rating: 3
I made this for our first anniversary and we both loved it. I only cooked two filets, but made the full recipe for the sauce--we'll try the leftovers on chicken breasts, as others suggested. My sauce took twice as long to thicken as the recipe indicated; from previous comments, I probably didn't have the heat up high enough.

I made this with strip loin steaks which I finished cooking on the bbq. A divine sauce for any steak however, I would probably reduce the amount of liquid next time and add some fresh garlic. Superb!

I made this for a birthday dinner for the boyfriend, and I have to say--I think this was the best sauce I've ever made! Because of the previous reviewers comments, I decreased the beef broth used (just used the soup can amount and then boiled), and used less peppercorns...I also boiled down to about 1/2C of broth (instead of 3/4C) and it really came out good!

Fabulous and easy!!!This served on a bed of Horseradish Mashed Potatoes surrounded by Vegetables in Arugula Broth made a very elegant Xmas feast!I followed some of the reviewers suggestions of patience during the sauce preparation - keep the heat high and allow more like 15 minutes for the sauce to thicken. Pan searing the filets to medium took 7 minutes on each side.Added extra shallots but otherwise followed the cream recipe to a tee.

What a waste of money! The steaks were fine pan seared (better on the grill), but the sauce was below par. I have had (and made) much better. I am a professional chef and none of the restaurants I work with would ever serve this.

What a treat! We grilled the fillets instead of pan frying them. Reduced the beef broth first, it took longer than 7 minutes and set it aside then cooked the shallots in the butter then added the rest of the ingredients. The sauce reduced to a very thick consistency. Make sure to use heavy cream and allow for longer than the suggested time for it to thicken. I made it while my husband was grilling so by the time he was done so was the sauce. It was "special dinner" worthy and the sauce would be great over lamb or venison.

I tried this recipe on company. Unfortunately, I didn't have the same success as others who wrote in. The sauce never thickened and it was hard to cook the steaks evenly and finish the sauce all at the same time. I ended up having to remake the sauce at the last minute under a lot of stress.

I agree with the review below - Westlake Village. We had a big party the night before and after days of making all the food I needed an effortless, cozy, stay at home Friday night dinner and WOW...I've never spent a more rewarding 15 minutes in the kitchen. I scrubbed 2 russets plopped them in the oven while boiling down the stock, set a pot of water to boil for sugar snap peas (boil 2 min.), organized the sauce ingredients, poured wine, turned on the music and when my husband got home I put on the filets and he never stopped umming. Then he started naming different people we need to invite for a dinner party with this recipe! I used one can of Campbells Beef Consomme (better flavor than their beef broth) and ½ cup half and half and ½ cup cream and it tasted great.

Fabulous recipe! I made this for dinner last night for my huband and I. It was as good or better than any restaurant version. I made a full recipe of sauce for 2 filets. I 'tweeked' the recipe a little - extra shallots and only 1/2 cup of whipping cream. The sauce thickened beautifully (you need high heat) and the flavor was fantastic. One cup of whipping cream to 3/4 cup broth seemed out of proportion....and it was! I served the filets with Horseradish Mashed Potatoes and Mushroom Stuffed Tomatoes for a fabulous Friday night stay at home dinner.

This was decadent and the perfect dish to wow any man into doing almost any yard work. Used mushrooms instead of shallots and left out Cognac, was still spectacular. Served with twice baked potatoes loaded with imported cheeses and cream, and a side of green beans with toasted almonds. Sip a nice California Merlot, whew, delicious! Pronounced the best steak he's ever had, so I'll keep this, thanks Epicurious and all helpful reviews. My yard looks great!

My suggestions.... First... I add a bunch of ground white pepper as well to give it a bigger punch. Second... I strain the shallots and green peppercorns out near the end. This makes it smoother. Last.. Use Beurre Manie to thicken. Yum

I am writing this just as a warning, I thought this would be fantastic but did not have the success that others did with this recipe. Just two quick cautinary tips, that might make it better: I let the sauce reduce for at least ten minutes and it was still to liquidy for my taste. Maybe add cornstarch as others suggested? I also had to return my steaks to the pan twice b/c they were far to red. I think the ribeye with brandy and blue cheese also found on this site is far superioir w/ a thicker sauce.

O.k. So my husband (who has never been more adventurous in the kitchen than making chicken breasts in the toaster oven) made me this filet mignon for my birthday and it was spectacular! Soooo delicious I felt like I was eating at a restaurant. He served it with stuffed portabello mushrooms--really nice alternative to the typical starch. I did coach him a little with the sauce-----the sauce will reduce perfectly, you just have to have patience. Don't add cornstarch, it's not necessary. We wanted our steaks "medium" so we finished them off at 475º in the oven for maybe 6 or 7 minutes (they were really thick filets). Bottom line is, this is a fantastic recipe and EXTREMELY easy.....Do try!!!!

Wow - this is a great way to prepare steak...my husband and I both loved this recipe. I made it in a grill pan simply because I like the way it looks and it seems to cook the meat very evenly. I did add cornstarch for thicker sauce, as a matter of personal taste. I served it with pureed butternut squash, creamed spinach (recipe from Gourmet/Feb2001) and a wonderful epicurious salad - Green salad with roasted asparagus and apples. YUM!

I just made this tonight and it was a hit. I had to use half a cup of fat free half and half to round out the half cup of wipping cream I had left. I have been disapointed in other cream sauces in the past, but this onr is good. I think picking up the juices from sauteing the filets did the trick. It was my 1st experience cooking filets this way. I've broiled them in the past. I also used dried green peppercorns and took the advice of another revier and soaked them in bandy, white wine vieager and hot water. Do make this, it is well worth it.
