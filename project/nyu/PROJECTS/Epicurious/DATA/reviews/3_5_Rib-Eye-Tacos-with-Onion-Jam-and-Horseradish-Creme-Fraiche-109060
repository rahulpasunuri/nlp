Fantastic! Make the onion jam the day before to turn this into a fast but delicious meal worthy of serving guests.

In fairness I just made the onion jam part of this recipe to serve with a duck rillettes (potted duck)I made trying to duplicate a dish we had in old Quebec City. The flavour was beautiful; texture more like a relish or pickle rather than a jam. We have since used it for gourmet hotdogs with dijion mayo. It would be super with tourtiere or other meat pies.

My husband I were disappointed with this recipe. Followed it as written and we didn't think the flavors went together well-the combo of the horseradish and the vinegar/wine in the onions. And as far as taco fillings go, it was very skimpy or maybe we are just used to great tacos due to our location.

This recipe turned out delicious!! Perfect for a party. Incidentally, A-Cook-from- Whitebread, I am Mexican and neither required someone else to make this recipe for me (Mexicans do use the Internet and have memberships at Epicurious) nor was I compelled to eat this dish over and over (Mexicans can possess sophisticated palates). Here's hoping you don't represent all Kansans in your narrow-minded views of other peoples.

This was a little sweeter than I expected. Still, very good. I agree with some others that this was better with potatoes than tortillas.

Made this tonight with great response (nothing left) I didn't have white wine vinegar so made fraiche without.It was still good, but will make it per the recipe next time. Used top sirloin (butcher was appalled that I was going to use rib-eye on"taco's") It was fabulous and will use sirloin next time as well. Onion jam was good as well...very tasty!

We love this recipe. We usually make it using leftover rib roast- that's what the restaurant did when we lived in Boston. Bonfire's taco bar has many more fun/different tacos like this one.

I made this dish using a beef tenderloin roast since it was for a party of 50-60 people. I also used about 3" cutouts for the tortillas. Otherwise everything was as the recipe specified and they were very good.

Fantastic recipe and a show stopping first course! I made it exactly as written and it was a huge hit. Rib-eye is pretty fatty, however, and I'm thinking of using a leaner cut next time.

I made this last weekend and it was sooooo good. Whitebread from Kansas you are too funny!

Yum! Made this for a dinner with friends and everyone raved. And it was so quick and easy. The horseradish is really strong so I kept tasting as I added it to the sour cream and vinegar and stopped at a little less than 3/4 cup. I'll make the horseradish sauce to serve with prime rib in the future. Also, I used sirloin rather than flank steak and substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine in the onion jam. Absolutely fantastic - a keeper.

This was excellent. No suggestions for improvement to be made.

The onion jam was fabulous. I would keep this recipe just for that portion. Also, to Maureen from Iowa - why not just use alcohol free wine? It's readily available in most supermarkets and since the alcohol evaporates in the cooking process, it probably wouldn't make much difference to use alcohol free wine in place of regular wine.

I don't really see the point in the tortillas, they just got soggy and didn't really add anything. But the onion jam was divine and I'll happily serve this as a meal with sourdough bread or potatos in place of the tortillas in future.

Absolutely fabulous. I used grilled flanksteak which I grilled and cut across the grain. After the meat sat for 10 minutes, of course

Yum! Used London Broil 'cause I couldn't resist the super-cheap grocery store sale, so it was a bit chewier than ribeye. Made up for cheap meat by using homemade tortillas... The horseradish cream (mad ewith with prepared horseradish) is quite strong.

Yum! The creme fraiche is over the top delicious! The onion jam is great and sooo easy!!

Wow. This is an exceptional recipe. I tried it on Trader Joe's flatbread, which was awesome. It makes for a heavier appetizer than the tortilla, yet it doesn't mask any of the other ingredients.

Delish. I used London Broil (what I had on hand), and yellow onion instead of red. The onion turns red anyway with the addition of the red wine, so the red onions aren't critical for color. The real key to this is the horseradish sauce - which is really great tasting. I served this on a plate - no tortilla - and it was so yummy. Served the leftover sauce later with seafood, and it was a big hit a second time.

DIVINE!!!!! I salted & peppered the steaks prior to searing for nice crust.

To Maureen, I have heard that if you are a recovering alcoholic that even wine with the alcohol cooked out can be counter productive. Why not try juice? Maybe prune juice and some balsamic vinegar for depth? Good luck.

RE: substituting the wine. I cook quite a bit with wine, and it's my understanding that when you reduce it, the alcohol content is evaporated. I'm pretty sure about it, but I would double check on it. Excellent Recipe. Can't wait to make it for my step sons.

As a recovering alcoholic, I would like to know if there is a substitue for the wine in the onion jam. Thanks for any input. angelica

Made this for a weeknight supper, so I used prepared horseradish, which was not the greatest, but the onion jam is fab. Would make again as a summer lunch, with the steaks on the grill. Didn't bother cutting the crusts off the tortillas--easier to eat that way.

So anything that comes on a tortilla can be classified as a taco? :) This should be called little piles of love on tortillas. I made it for some friends in town and I was frightened at the half crazed look in their eyes as the devoured everything with small grunts of satisfaction and delight. I would make again and again.
