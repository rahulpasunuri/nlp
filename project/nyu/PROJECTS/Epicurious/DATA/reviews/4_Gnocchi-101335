The best potato gnocchi recipe I've tried yet! I used an electric beater - didn't mind having a few lumps in my dough (or potato skin, actually....). Went by texture rather than measurement, so not sure how much flour I ended up using, but the result was delicious!

I've never made pasta before, and never gnocchi. This recipe was really easy to follow with great results. I doubled the recipe and started with baking my potatoes. I peeled them right out of the oven and grated with a box grated on the smallest hole. I made the dough in my kitchenaid and rolled it and cooked half right away- the other half is in the freezer. So tasty and simple! It wasn't labor intensive, just a little time consuming. I'll be making this again! I need to practice shaping the gnocchi! :)

To the website editor: It doesn't say 1/4 of WHAT. I would assume it's 1/4 cup. 1/4 freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

I made this today (Christmas Eve) using leftover mashed potatoes - wonderful!! I use the Beef Ragu recipe on here, too - it's a festive pairing and favorite of my family for special occasions.

This is the best recipe I know for gnocchi. It is indeed crucial to use a potato ricer to avoid getting heavy and chewy gnocchi. The amount of flour absorbed by the potatoes depends on the potato type and even the season. I used Yukon Gold and found that I needed much less flour than the suggested 1.5 cups.

My Husband LOVED these... he couldn't stop eating them. I used 6 med size potatoes and baked them because keeping the potatoes as dry as possible is what soon many recipes said to do. I used maybe only 3/4 cup flour... while kneading the dough... it looked too dry so I added another egg and then I was able to rope the dough, roll the pieces off a fork and cooked them. They tasted delicious, but they tasted like potatoes... delicious, but whenever I've eaten gnocchi before and they tasted like pasta. Mine cooked up GREAT. None fell apart. They just tasted like potato... not sure if all the other times I've eaten gnocchi that it was supposed to taste like what I made? Anyway as long as my husband likes it that's all that counts.

Even without a rice cooker, my gnocchi turned out wonderfully. I used a regular old potato masher, and did have to pull a few lumps out of the dough while forming the dumplings. I tripled the batch and did find that the last gnocch I formed were quite sticky and difficult to shape, but still delicious with a simple butter and basil sauce. Some advice: don't be shy with the salt in this recipe.

Making gnocchi is like self-torture. It's not worth the pain of burning yourself with hot potatoes, getting your counter so sticky you can hardly get the gnocchi dough off of it, even after scrubbing it down multiple times. If you have a ricer, great! but if you don't, this recipe can be very daunting. I tried to use a cheese grater, but ended up cutting myself accidentally. I then proceeded to try an electric mixer, which didn't get the potatoes as fluffy as I would have liked and left chunks of solid potato which I then had to pick out. It was delicious, but not fun. Cooking should be fun!

Oh! Also, if you don't have a ricer/food mill, you can grate the potatoes on the side of a box grater for finely-shredded cheese (not the spiky/hard cheese/zester side).

This is a really great, straightforward gnocchi recipe. It got me over my homemade-gnocchi hiatus/phobia; it's really not that hard, especially if you make it ahead and freeze. I used a little less than 1 1/2 cups of flour and was a little afraid they'd fall apart after I cooked them, but they held together nicely. Not too dense--just the right texture. Thanks!

I have just read the reviews, printed the recipe & will now laminate it B4 I cook.My mama who is Polish/Ukraine used to first make (potato/farm cheese) PIEROGI & when the filling ran out the leftover dough would be made into PELUSHKI" translates to lazy fingers.while we waited with baited breath for them to cook mama would fry chop't onion in speck & butter to serve. We ate them with sour cream & KAPUSTA-fried cabbage MY DIFFERENCE-I have baked the whole spuds B4 I rice them, read that if you bake the spuds have tendency to be less watery makes sense to me. Thanks 4 this great recipe for GNOCCHI see ya later I'm now going to make Polish PELUSHKI, stuff my face & return to my childhood.THANKS "

Delicious, and surprisingly simple. Note: If you want the lightest gnocchi, do prepare this directly before serving. Last time I made these, I riced the potatoes the night before and used the precook method due to time constraints, and they were slightly firmer than I'd like. Still, everyone raved about them, so it's nice to know that I can make them ahead when necessary.

My only deviation from the recipe was using a farm-fresh egg & less flour than anticipated. Light, wonderful and perfect with a ragu using pork neck bones from the same farm. (Love my farmers!!) Also, find a ten-year-old to help with the rolling and shaping! Mine has the patience required, and the appetite to merit the effort.

Very light and creamy texture to these gnocchi. As it turns out, I was out of parmesan, so I decided to try neufchatel instead (about 2 ounces). Nuked the potato's instead of steaming or baking, riced them, added the cream cheese, egg, salt and pepper, and a couple pinches of dried basil. Used a stand mixer to bring together the ingredients. Started with the paddle to lightly whip the potato's, egg, and cheese then switched to the dough hook to add the flour till it just came together. They turned out light, creamy, and wonderful!

we made this with, duck with a brandy,red wine and bing cherry reduction.we sauteed the the the gnocchi in carmelized onions,celery and fresh sage,kinda like a stuffing.was a real hit.if you dont have a ricer or food mill as most dont,we used a cheese shreader with holes about a 1/16 of an inch holes,much cheaper and easier to find(most super markets have them) than the alternative. it worked perfect.also when i boiled them i pulled them out as soon as they floated to suface and stayed,any longer made them start falling apart.i also would suggest looking on the internet and find a video of some one making this it will make it tons easier., there is one, but i am sure epicurious would want me say where..lol. bon appetite y'all

Excellent recipe - I use those one all the time. It might sound like a lot of work, but it is very easy. Everyone always loves them.

Fabulous! This makes the lightest, fluffiest gnocchi I've had, better than many restaurants. It's not nearly as labor intensive to make at home as you may think. Serve the gnocchi tossed with a little brown butter- sage sauce and you'll think you've died and gone to heaven.

Great easy recipe. Cooked our fresh green beans, made pesto w/garlic, evoo, fresh basil and tossed all together with some shredded parmesan. Fast 'good for you' meal. Probably any veggie of choice could be substituted for green beans.

This was easy, fast and excellent. They will fall apart if you do not use enough flour. I used left over baked potatoes that were too starchy and they still turned out great. Maybe not easy for the novice cook. I could not find my ricer and just mashed them and they still were tender lots of flavour and held the sauce.

this recipe made the best gnocchi I have ever had. Found it didn't cook well from the freezer but made and eaten fresh, these are the best and lightest.

These came out perfect. I used a food processor with appropriate blade attachment instead of potato ricer and followed instructions exactly. Excellent results. Much lighter and not as rubbery as store bought gnocchi. And they held together beautifully. Served with gorgonzola, carmelized pears and a few toasted walnuts. Fast and easy. Definitely will make these again.

this is the nastiest gnocchi I have ever had. They fall apart in the water and are completely lacking any flavor (the little bits that aren't dissolved). What a waste of a perfectly good Sunday!

This is an excellent recipe! We love to make this for dinner guests -it is a lot of fun to get people involved in helping to make the gnocchi.

really nice and light, even though I only had a masher instead of a ricer. Needed only approx. 1 cup of flour though (+dusting).

This is a perfect recipe for gnocchis. I followed the directions step by step. It was very easy and delicious. I made it for Easter with the Tomato, Basil and Olive Sauce; Roast Baby Lamb and Braised Spring Legumes. This is going to be my Easter menu for the rest of my life.

This is the best Gnocchi recipe I have ever used. The results were very, very light. It all worked perfectly. I found I needed most of the flour (1-1/4) cups. I also used a ricer as recommended.

I was searching for a Gnocchi recipe and found another Lidia Matticchio Bastianich recipe elsewhere. The problem with this recipe is that the cheese amount isn't typed correctly - 1/4 - I assume it meant 1/4 cup. The other recipe I found of hers didn't include cheese in the basic gnocchi recipe.

This is the best gnocchi recipe I've tried so far. It was easy to make and my picky Italian/German husband loved it. I'd reduce the amount of flour though, it doesn't take much to hold together, but you don't want it too light/mushy like the last reviewer, she probably didn't add enough flour. After a few try's it a keeper. I make it every christmas with my famous sausage bread.

I'm not going to rate this recipe since I really messed it up. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but after boiling, the gnocchi came out all mushy and most of them broke apart into a watery kind of mush. Did I boil them too long? The few that did turn out tasted good and were very light. Any comments would be welcome.

My first time making gnocchi, and it wasn't nearly as difficult as I'd expected. After using just about 1/3 of the flour the recipe called for, the gnocchi came together nicely. The flavor and texture were great.

I was at a wine tasting where Lydia Bastianich was the featured chef. She prepared various gnocchi this being one of them. It was a wonderful dish. Although I have not yet tried this recipe myself it did not seem to difficult to make. I would give it 4 forks on taste alone. Can't wait to try it.

If you ask me, this is the definitive gnocchi recipe. I always use it when I make gnocchi with my daughters (they love to "help" Mommy) and the gnocchi are always light and tender. The key is to rice the potatoes when they are piping hot and not to work the dough too much. A real keeper.
