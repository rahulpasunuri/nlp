Great pie. If you love lemons, I suggest using the zest of a whole lemon and the juice of half a lemon. I also cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup and everyone thought it was perfect... lemony and not too sweet. I may try serving it with a fresh blueberry sauce next time, although it`s good just as it is.

I just won 3rd place in the buttermilk pie category at the Kentucky State Fair with this pie. As you don't get to taste the other pies, I don't know what they had to beat this one, but there was a lot of pies, so I feel pretty good about 3rd place! I added the zest of a whole lemon and spoonful of lemon juice. It's a nice easy lemony pie - not as rich as lemon meringue, great with tea.

I thought this was made great by adding the zest from the whole lemon and a tablespoon of lemon juice. It's lemony and sweet, but not too much, with a nice, muted tang from the buttermilk. Be warned, though, that lemon juice prevents browning, so you'll have to figure out a way to cover up the funky-looking top of the pie (I used dulce de leche, but I imagine a tangy raspberry glaze would be great). I baked it at least 20 min longer than the recipe recommended as well. I used the 'easy pie crust' from elsewhere on this site.

There isn't anything special about this pie. I found it bland, with not enough lemony tang. I don't recommend adding lemon juice, as it will cause the milk to curdle. You could add additional lemon zest, which might help. Still, I wouldn't make it again.

Like other reviewers, I thought it was very easy to make and liked the suble, oldfashioned-ness of this pie. (Lemon freaks, do up the zest quotient.) Because I'm really just a novice with pastry, I used a traditional recipe for pate brisee that I am confident with and divided the filling to make two small pies in small fluted quiche pans. The crust coloured beautifully and filling set perfectly without any change at all to cooking times. I topped the pies with sliced strawberries mascerated in cointreau with a little french strawberry jam added, a few mint leaves crusted with confectioners sugar in the middle, and clotted cream on the side. I gave one to a neighbour and took the other to a friend for afternoon tea. I don't usually make things like this, so all were suitably impressed, including me!

This was great; a wonderful tangy, lemony, sweet custard pie. I just picked some fresh raspberries so I added 2 baskets. It was great! I have to say though, the dough that is supposedly called "Pâte Brisée" is not Pâte Brisée at all; it is a regular pie dough (Pâte Brisée should have egg yoke and sugar in the dough). But hey, that's just semantics; the recipe is spot-on. Thanks for a great ending to a wonderful meal!

I have made this pie occasionally since it was first published in the magazine and it's delicious. The subtle lemon flavor doesn't overpower the delicate custard of the pie, but if you like it more lemony just increase the amount of lemon zest. If you're in a hurry, it saves a bit of time to use pie crust mix -- quick to mix and roll out and better tasting than a frozen premade crust.

I've been making this pie for years. I always toss a handful of fresh blueberries onto the crust, then pour in the filling.

Perhaps it's user error, but I baked this at least 30 minutes extra and it still came out soupy (though it did finally brown on top). Too eggy for my taste--the texture is like when I learned NOT to freeze quiche--lumpy with unappetizing liquid at the bottom... Looks like I'm the only one to have had this problem though!

Perfectly respectable pie, but not that interesting. Lemon lovers be sure to add extra lemon.

I guess I was expecting this pie to be fabulous, after all the reviews...it was ok, but nothing special. I added additional lemon zest as others recommended, but I won't bother making this again. I think the recipe for Carmelized Lemon Tart on this site packs a better lemon punch.

A great pie recipe!!! Easy to make and my lemon loving eight year old simply gobbled it up. Only thing to change would be to bake it an extra 15 minutes to achieve the look and taste of perfection!! YUM YUM!!!

Quick, easy, unusual and really good. I'll make it again soon.

I am so happy that I tried this delicious pie recipe. As with the other reviewers, I made a couple of minor changes and would definitely incorporate the same changes when I make the pie again (which will be soon). For the filling: I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup; I increased the grated lemon zest to 2-1/2 teaspoons; I added 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice. For the crust (which is wonderful! and simple to manage): I found I needed about 3-4 tablespoons ice water to bring the pastry together. I also did not use quite all the crust when rolling out the shell. I probably have enough left over to roll out a small tart...but that's only because I do not prefer thick crusts. My husband doesn't like buttermilk so I didn't tell him what the main ingredient of the pie was - I made him guess (he thought it was some sort of lemon cream pie). When I told him I had used buttermilk, he was very surprised and told me the recipe is "a keeper". I served it with sliced strawberries and a fancy squirt of whipped cream. Oh yes -- I had to bake the pie longer than the recipe called for. It took about another 15 min. at the reduced temp. for me to get the golden look to the pie filling and the perfect color to the crust. To be sure, make it the day before, refrigerate, then eat it the next day. Perfect!! Try it - you won't be sorry!!

This was great! One of the things I liked best about it was how easy it was to make. Even the crust was easy. I didn't have time to refrigerate it before I rolled it out, and it still came out perfectly. I did have to add a few more tablespoons of water, though. I will definitely make it again - maybe add macerated strawberries to serve on the side with whipped cream.

This is a scrumptous little pie that goes together quickly. It's a nice alternative to the tired old lemon meringue thing. This receipe is definitely a keeper.

I like the flexibilty of the recipe. As the other reviews show, you can make it sweeter or tarter to taste. Topping tip: I like to "rasberry flavor" vodka. When I remove the rasberries after a week, I use them to make a topping which is excellent on this pie !

I just ate a piece of this pie slightly warm, and I can tell I'm really going to like it chilled. I made it exactly according to the recipe except that I added about another 2 teaspoons of lemon zest. Maybe next time I will try adding lemon juice like another reviewer said, but I didn't really think it needed it with the extra zest. This is really a yummy, old-fashioned, and very easy to make pie. Reminds me of my great-grandmother's sugar cream pie. I will be making lots of these.

This was one fork at room temperature, two forks chilled, and three forks the next day! I followed suggestions of the other reviewers and used more lemon zest, less sugar, and added lemon juice. Very easy! Next time I'll jazz it up a little with raspberries on the side.

I rated this, "like it, don't love it" because I think it could be more lemony and less sweet. I think other reviewers thought the same thing. However, it was easy to make and I used the filling in purchased tart cups and it worked beautifully. I tried adding lemon juice and extra kemon zest as others had suggested but still found it sweet(I will cut sugar more) add more lemon or maybe I am trying to make a mountain out of a molehill-:) I froze one to test and defrosted with no ill effect. I also froze the raw filling and will let you know... Yes, I took it out of the freezer/whipped it/ and used in tart shells. Delicious!

This is a simple pie with a wonderful creamy texture. It's great served chilled. I use a bit less sugar to cut the sweetness. I also use a different crust, as I found the one in the recipe a bit fussy. Surprized at the intensity of the lemon flavour from just a bit of minced peel.

Yummy but with one change. I found the original to lack in the lemon department. To remeday the situataion I added a mere one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and it made all the difference in the world. Lemony but not too tart. It still had the lovely sweetness of the buttermilk.
