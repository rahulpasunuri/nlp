Just served this to my in-laws after dinner and they loved it! Great zabaglione. Served some exactly it is in the recipe but also made a couple small glass bowls with just crushed lady fingers, strawberries, zabaglione, etc. It is a great and simple and elegant recipe.

Spectacular! No one could guess the flavoring. Delicious!

I would definitely do a dry run of making this recipe. At first try, the zabaglione was a little runny, but on second effort, it turned out perfect!

Fabulous recipe and so simple to make. I made the zabaglione several hours ahead and it was great. Also cut up the fruit ahead of time. Vin Santo wine was a little pricey but then we served it with the dessert.
