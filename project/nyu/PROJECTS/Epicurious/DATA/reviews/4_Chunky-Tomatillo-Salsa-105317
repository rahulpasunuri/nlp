This is a great recipe for garden produce. Fresh tomatillos are much sweeter than anything you can get at the store. I did add a little salt, then let it marinate in the fridge for a couple of hours. Was fabulous with chips and used it to top grilled chicken.

I have had better tomatillo salsa. Somehow this seemed to lack something.

I substituted salt for the sugar and skipped the bell pepper (didn't have any) blended the tomatillo for smooth texture. Fantastic!

THIS IS YUMMY! I rated it beyond compare because really good, tasty salsa recipes are hard to find. I have tried many and this is a keeper! I threw it all in my Vita-Mix with superbly delicious results.

This is an interesting cross between a salsa fresca and a salsa verde. I left out the sugar, and it was excellent. We tried it with chips, over roast pork and as a sandwich relish. I liked the texture very much.

First year experience in growing Tomatillo in my garden. Made this salsa to take to a BBQ, everyone loved it. Had to make it the next day. Cut tomatillo's smaller to have less chunky salsa. Will add this to my favorites.

This salsa is wonderful!! We really enjoyed it and I intend to use this again and again! Very light and fresh tasting. Yum! Rather than use the food processor, I chopped everything extremely fine so it was still 'chunky'.

This was a little too 'chunky,' so I ran it through the blender. I have made it three times now. Saves some of the chopping using the blender directly. Third time I roasted tomatillos before adding. Gave a nice flavor, but result is somewhat thinner. We have used it with chips and veggies as a dip. Good with batter fried zuccini and even batter fried tomatillos. Alice

I made this as a first experience with tomatillas. It is very pretty in a clear glass dish. Used it for dip with chips like salsa and as garnish for tamale casserole. Used left-overs in omelet and hash browns for another meal. Everyone loved it!!

This is easy and fast beyond your wildest hopes...as long as you have the ingredients on hand. It is fruity and tangy , the perfect condiment. I served it with chipotle marinated and grilled (over charcoal) skirt steak. Just delicious.
