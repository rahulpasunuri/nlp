This is one of the TASTIEST chicken recipes I have ever used! I served it over couscous. I love it so much I have started saving other recipes on this site and others that use fennel. I'm collecting all kinds of tagine recipes as well.

all in all, worth repeating as is, though next time I may cut the cayenne in half. Definitely reminded me of morocco! I liked the fennel, but would maybe add more veggies -- zucchini, carrots -- to give it a bit more variety, and something like carrots would add a bit of sweet. saved it to the box!

I don't think this dish would win any beauty contests, and there was something about the flavors that I thought lacked savor. Overall, it was fine for a night and the leftovers will get eaten, but not really a keeper for me.

This dish is easy and very flavorful. We loved it. Thanks to the cook who suggested thickening with butter/flour mixture. It was a good final touch and also cut the sodium a bit, because I didn't have low sodium broth.

SOO good. Amazing so flavorful. I would make it again with garlic and white wine. But over all. so good.

For the all the high-impact ingredients, there really wasn't much flavor to this dish.

I was really excited to make this dish, and although it was a good comfort food (warm and stewy), I found it very bland in flavour. Kind of an 'ok' meal. Would not make it again.

Super easy. Wonderfully tasty. I thickened the mixture with a little butter/flour mixture just before serving. Lovely!

Easy and exceptional taste. Embarrassed to say that I had neither the fennel nor the olives but it was great just the same. The lemon was outstanding.

really tasty! i love this recipe. the grocery store was out of fennel bulbs, so i replaced with 2 teaspoons of fennel seeds, and i thought it came out great. others said it was a bit salty but i enjoyed it (i like salty foods). this one's a keeper.

I love this recipe, I give it to all my friends. I serve it with cous cous and slivered toasted almonds on top.

Super easy, and the chicken was tasty,but despite doing everything in my power to lower the salt short of making the chicken broth from scratch, it was too salty. Tasty enough, but there are other easy tagines out there that better fit the bill.

We loved this! We omitted the salt based on other people's comments. We will definitely do this again.

This was fantastic!!! Unlike a lot of tagine recipes, it does not take hours - it was a great weekday dinner! I doubled the spices and got perfect flavor and heat. *DO* use the low-sodium chicken broth...I used regular and it was a little too salty. I also doubled the olives, because I love them, and I *DO NOT* reommend it...to salty again. I fixed roasted red potatoes alongside it, but honestly may just chuck them in the pot next time to make a total one dish dinner! Great the next day. And the next after that. :)

It really is this good. I used whole chicken legs (not boneless/skinless thighs) and tonight, I'm going to make it by roasting them, rather than cooking them on the stove. Certain it will be as awesome if not moreso.

Absolutely delicious! I made it for my boyfriend last night and he thought it was one of the tastiest dishes I've ever made - and it was so easy. I threw some craisens into the couscous I served with this - the sweetness was a delightful contrast to the saltiness of the olives.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! I made it for my husband and then my family and they all went crazy over it! My hubby said it tastes like something you'd get in a restaurant! Ok so I used boneless breast (not thighs) and it still came out great. I like things tasty and spicey so I really didnt measure the spices but just made sure the chicken was well coated. Also I left out the salt. This dish came pretty salty the first time so be sure to use the low-sodium chicken broth and rinse the olives before adding them in. I did not use the whole can of chicken broth, a little less as it takes forever to reduce. I did add a little more lemon like people said, yum! Lastly I would saute the fennel for longer and let it simmer in the chicken broth before adding the chicken. The fennel takes awhile to soften and you dont want the chicken to get overcooked! Enjoy, it truley is a great dish!

Just made this for dinner, thought it was really good and easy. Next time, I think I will use the bone in chicken thighs and kick up the cayenne. But, I like a little more heat.

This was a big hit. I left out the red pepper because I was serving it to children and I use flat parsley instead of cilantro because I didn't think cilantro and fennel would work well together. We will definitely make this again. Really good!

Very easy and very good. I'd add a bit more spice next time but otherwise perfect. I served it over couscous with pistachios and was perfect. I might throw in some golden raisins next time.

This was excellent! The olives and the cumin are a perfect compliment to the fennel. I added extra lemon at the end, and reduced the cilantro. It's great over couscous, and makes a great left over, as well.

Amazing flavors for such a simple dish! This one is a keeper. I used the juice of one lemon (not quite double what the recipe called for) and it was perfect. Served with couscous for a quick and delicious meal!

This is a very enjoyable dish to prepare. It is very aromatic and beyond delicious for your palate.

We really enjoyed this dish. Easy to make but very tasty. I served it over egg noodles and did add more lemon juice than called for. It was even better the next day as a second meal. This dish could be a regular on our table.

easy to make, tasty and healthy--the dark meat of the thigh is great. The fennel bulbs add a nice texture and complimentary taste to the nicely seasoned dish. Only thoughts are that it came out quite salty, so take care with the olives and extra salt, and that it could use even more lemon.
