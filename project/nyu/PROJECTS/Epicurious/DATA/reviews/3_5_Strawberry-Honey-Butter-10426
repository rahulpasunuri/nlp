Love it!!! It's a huge hit among friends and a total secret. :) The trick is to leave the strawberry mix slightly warm and add the butter so it melts into it. Then it mixes perfectly!

I just finished off my batch. After a day in the refrigerator it separated, but was still delicious! A perfect way to welcome spring. My husband and I ate it on crepes for breakfast and on cornbread muffins as dessert. Yum!

This separated and did not work for me at all. Not very sweet either.

A sweet delicious spread, and really pretty simple. It has a really pronounced strawberry flavor - I put it on homemade strawberry bread, too! The pink color would also be perfect for a Valentine's brunch or tea.

Really great flavor. Spread on cornbread, mmmm... I actually melted the butter in with the strawberry/honey mixture and the texture was smooth and creamy.

Delicious. I made it to go with popovers at a dinner party and it was a huge hit. If it looked like cottage cheese, perhaps you didn't beat long enough. That's how mine looked but after a good five minutes plus, it whipped up very nice and blended beautifully.

I found this dish to be okay but nothing terribly special -- to me it tasted mostly like butter and jam. And I'm uncertain if I simply didn't cream the ingredients together correctly, but the presentation was awful! It looked like tiny cottage cheese covered in red food coloring. Any suggestions on where I might have gone wrong?

This was so delicious made with stawberries from California - can't wait until we get native Massachusetts ones at our local Farmers'Market in a few weeks!

In a word, delicious! My daughter and I made this for her class assignment that required a dish containing honey. She and her classmates and teacher loved it. I added an extra tablespoon of honey to give it some extra sweetness to offset the lack of sweetness that comes with out of season strawberries. Freshly picked strawberries this summer will make this irresistible.

YUM!! A favorite cafe of mine served this butter with french bread and it was so wonderful. I finally found a recipe for it, exacly. Thanks! The unsalted butter is key here. Other experiments I've done is to take the unsalted butter and blend with jam--orange marmalade was a big hit. Took it to a breakfast with 2 B&B owners and they loved it! Good variation on pancakes instead of syrup.
