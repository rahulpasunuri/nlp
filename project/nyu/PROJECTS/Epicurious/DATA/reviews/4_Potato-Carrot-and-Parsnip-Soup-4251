Delicious! I puréed the whole thing. Added half cup each of 1% milk and half and half and 1/8 c of sherry. Excellent but we preferred it without the milk sherry. So if you are looking to cut fat, don't hesitate, it's still really good. I also roasted the root vegetables and caramelized the onion for more flavor.

Just finished making this soup for my husband and I. We were going to eat it while watching the football game today, but after doing a taste test, we couldn't wait! It is so delicious! Other folks are right in that the sherry really makes it. I used 2% milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2 as that is what I had on hand. Will def recommend to others and make again! Thx!

This was SO good! I needed to use up my Christmas ham so I added chopped ham. I really think the sherry is the star, it really plays off the parsnip flavor, super yum. I upped the potatoes to closer to 4 cups. I apologize for rating the recipe with so many changes (I know it drives people crazy)but I hit before I knew it, the soup was just so good! lol

Will be making this again very soon. Very tasty.

I'm not rating this recipe because I changed it significantly but ended up with a sweet, tasty soup. Here's what I did: I omitted the pureeing, the half & half, and the sherry. Instead of parsley I added about 10 chopped fresh sage leaves. Instead of broth I added a quart of water and a Rapunzel Vegan bouillion cube (no salt) plus a teaspoon of Kosher salt. After letting it simmer for 30 minutes, I let it sit for another 30 minutes and then dove in. This soup was lovely and sweet. I loved the chunks. I sprinkled a little more sea salt on after ward. Yum.

Loved this soup. Simple using local fall ingredients. I added about 6 cups of broth, used Port instead of Sherry and am saving the cream for an optional top-up twirl at the end. Tasted rich enough. I blended a little more than half but like a few chunks in the soup for texture & flavour.

Great way to use up vegetables. Instead of only pureeing half of the soup I did all of it and I think it made a huge difference in the taste. I also did not have any sherry so I add a couple of dashes of red wine vinegar. This was a great side for a sandwich or a protein such as fish or chicken.

Rustic, flavorful & subtle, this is a great soup for a winter's day. We're vegetarians at my house so we substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth, but otherwise followed the recipe. Even our finicky 17 year old wanted more!

This soup is great! I did make some adjustments to this recipe though: (1) I mistakenly used a whole stick of butter instead of half. (2) added 3 little cloves of garlic and shallot to one purple and one white onion. (3) used cilantro instead of parsley and it was WONDERFUL. and a great garnish. (4) used a mix of 1% and half and half instead of all half and half. (5) added a few pinches of sugar for some sweetness (6) let the soup simmer on very low for at least an hour before serving to blend the flavors more b/c the taste wasn't there yet. Quite delicious and very filling! I'm normally not a fan of soup for dinner because I don't get filled up, but this does the trick! We also served with warm bread and butter and herbed goat cheese and salami on the side.

I made this pretty much per recipe. I eyeballed the amounts & I had to sub Marsala for the Sherry since I was out of it.I also left out the parsley. Delicious. I will definately make this again.

Thought this soup was ok, but I was expecting something better given the overwhelmingly positive reviews. To me it was a bit bland so I doubled the thyme and added some sage, and a few dashes of white wine vinegar to perk it up. I pureed most of the soup, leaving just a few chunks. I will make it again but will continue to add more seasoning.

Substitute leeks for parsnips and add a little garlic. Using carrots and parsnips together is a mistake in my opinion. They are too similar and the result is something over sweet and hard to identify. This soup might also benefit from something spicy.

Fantastic flavor! I got raves and high fives after serving this. I did not have sherry on hand, so I used rice wine. I plan to invite my friends over just to have the excuse to make this soup again.

excellent - the half-n-half and sherry really make this excellent. i used 2 cups of parsnip and 1 C of carrots because that's what i have, and i love the flavor of the parsnips in the final soup. i also added 2 shallots with the 2 onions, and substituted fresh sage for the fresh thyme. i highly recommend this soup.

The soup was yummy, it just wasn't the hearty winter soul warming soup I expected. I was delicate and delicious, though, and very pretty.

Fantastic soup. A definite keeper!

We liked this soup. Using milk instead of half and half made it lighter, but kept it creamy. A leek instead of a parsnip worked really well. This recipe is a keeper.

Absolutely delicious soup! I used 8 thin carrots, 1 large parsnip, 4 small yellow potatoes and 4 cups chicken broth. I also decreased the Sherry to 1/8 cup and substituted skim milk for the half and half. I would definitely make this again!!

This is a great fall soup! I have never cooked with parsnips before, and I was pleasantly surprised with this soup. I did substitute yellow potatoes for red, white wine for sherry, and skipped the parsley. I would make this again.

Deeeelicious! And pretty easy to make. It was really rich, though, so I'm going to make it with 2% milk next time instead of half-and-half. I had never had parsnips before. They have a very unique flavor that could probably be unpleasant if you use too many. But in this recipe, they added just the right amount of zest for me. If you're hesitant to eat too much of a pale, gnarled root, you might try using just two or three of them.

This is a hearty, full-bodied soup...great on a cold Sunday evening for a casual dinner. I drizzled a bit of maple syrup on top of the bowl instead of the suggested maple syrup cream from another review but otherwise followed the recipe. It is easy to make and impressive to serve.

Wonderful soup. I didn't have parsnips on hand and instead just increased the amount of potatoes and carrots...still turned out beautifully. A great first course for a fall/winter meal.

It's become a staple at Thanksgiving.

I served this to a dinner party and everyone loved it. I wonder how it would be without the potatoes, since I thought they added a little grainy texture I didn't like so much...

I included sweet potatoes (just because I happened to have them already chopped and mixed with the rest of the vegetables). I also excluded the cream to have a lighter version and just let the picky eaters (kids) add a dollop of creme fraiche. The result was, (I quote) "delicious".

I'm sorry...I would not make this soup again because I believed it to be an entree. I guess it would be fine as a first course, but it is really unsatisfying as the main dish. In any case, the flavor is fine, not excellent.

Wonderful! Have made for the past 2 Thanksgivings and everyone loves it! I puree the entire soup and add a little more broth at the end. It is my kids (11 and 12) favorite soup. Always pleases.

Fabulous, has become one of our most requested soups at this time of year, great for fall. I've also added a tablespoon of maple syrup cream as a garnish, elegant touch. Whipped cream add syrup to taste.

This was great soup. I couldn't believe that it was made by me. It tastes like something you'd be served at an upscale restaurant.

This soup is to die for! If you love parnsips as much as I do, you'll love this soup. I did not find the parsnips overwhelming at all -- just wonderful! And it was very easy to prepare.

We belong to a Community Supported Garden, and this time of year we get loads of root vegies. This week we got parsnips, and I can't imagine a nicer way to use them than in this wonderful comfort soup. Thank you, Epicurious!

I was a little leery of this soup until I added the sherry and half n' half--then it became divine! A wonderful, silky, elegant winter soup. And fairly easy to put together.

This is a delicious soup. I have made it w/out the parsnips as I thought the parsnips overpowered the carrot flavor. Really easy and just a great cream soup. For less fat, I also use 2% milk.

Everyone in my family loved this, even my finicky teen-age daughters! Here are my modifications: saute 2 cups of onions in olive oil, not butter. Use dill instead of thyme;add 2% milk, not half and half.

This is just delicious. And it gets better the next day. A lot of chopping & can't be described as a quick soup to make, but well worth the effort. Good, fresh, flavourful ingredients are key. I used a dry sherry, not the sweet, cream variety. One of those hand-held blenders that you use in the cooking pot (off the heat) is a God-send when making soups like this. I use mine all the time & it saves a ton of washing-up. Comfort food at its best !

I was craving parsnips (a food from childhood) and found this recipe. It is now my favorite soup recipe--I can hardly wait to make it for guests! The fresh herbs really make the soup; and when the soup is pureed, the carrots give it a beautiful golden color. SO delicious and would be a classy, impressive start to any meal. Definately deserves four-plus forks!

I love this recipe. I have made it numerous times and have always received rave reviews for it. No one ever guesses the ingredients beyond the carrots. I have made this for occasions from Thanksgiving to everyday lunch and it never fails to satisfy.
