Something as simple as a little more salt (half a teaspoon isn't much for 1 cup and a half or rice) rescues this recipe from blandness. Loved the ginger flavor. Skipped scallions (didn't have any) and coriander ( I abhor it)and got really generous on the Tabasco, although I used Picamas, a local brand of hot sauce.

I followed the others advice and increased the coconut milk to 1 cup and decreased the water a bit. Also used red pepper flakes instead of tabasco. A more subtle side, but not your boring old rice!

sorry to disagree with some of you but i took the advise of other reviewers and doubled the ginger and coconut milk and even put in a healthy dose of hot sauce (by mistake but glad i did it) and i found this rice to be dull. it really lacks flavor considering all that is going on with it.

My husband and I really enjoyed this rice. As others advised, I too also increased the coconut milk by 1/3 cup, I used light milk. The rice was moist, but not sticky.

This rice is fantastic! I find that I have to add a little more coconut milk to it than the recipe calls for, I use the full flavored coconut milk(not low fat). I have never put the tabasco into it. This is a super easy to make, lightly flavored, beautiful side-dish.

This recipe came out well when I used an additional cup or so of water plus extra coconut milk - did anyone find that the amount of water specified in the recipe was much too little?

This has great flavor that's more subtle than the ingredients would have you believe. It would be great substituted for steamed white rice in a lot of asian dishes. See it at Mise En Place

I made this recipe for a 25-person polynesian beach party - and it was a hit! I agree with Jeff (see below) - let the main dish carry the main ooph. Use full-fat coconut milk too - the flavor is worth it. Served with teriyaki chicken; grilled sweet potatoes w/lime cilantro dressing, grilled shrimp, grilled pineaplle; tropical fruit and King's Hawaiian bread

I would make this again, but only to use up the rest of the can of coconut milk. If you like the taste of fresh ginger, you will like this.

I liked this recipe a lot, although it did turn out dry for me (possibly because I used low fat coconut milk or maybe it was the jasmine rice). After cooking, I added a good bit of coconut milk to moisten the dish and it was wonderful.

I made this dish to go with Hoisin 5-Spice Chicken Legs. It was good but very mild. I added extra cocunut milk and instead of adding hot sauce we used a spicy sweet chile sauce on top at serving time. Next time I think I will also use more ginger. But I will make it again.

Previous reviews of this recipe are correct in noting the lightness of the coconut flavor. If more pronounced coconut flavor is desired, I'd recommend sprinkling dried unsweetened coconut flakes on top. I believe, however, that the dish works best when it's more subtly nuanced as opposed to a tastebud onslaught. The key is to allow the main course to carry the intense flavors. In my case, I did a Caribbean grill with lime shrimp and chicken skewers--both spicy and robustly flavored. The ginger is certainly the dominant note here. The hot sauce turned the dish a not-so-nice orange color: next time I'd use slices of red Jalapeno or other red chile to add kick and provide more visual interest. I cut down the oil per previous review and the rice was dry--I wound up adding it back at the end.

This dish was absolutely perfect, the taste of coconut was a bit subtle, possibly adding more might make a difference...but the subltleness led to a refined taste. The only thing I changed was reducing the amount of oil (happy I did, if not I think it would have come out too greasy for mine and my boyfriend's taste) I can't wait to make it again!!!

Goes great with spicy dishes. I'll add extra ginger next time.

I tend to eat a lot of rice and was quite excited about this one when I read the recipe. I was disappointed. I found that adding the coconut milk was a waste of time. You really couldn't find it in the taste unless you concentrated. I HAVE to make it again, as my husband raved about it. Next time I will add a heaping tablespoon of the coconut paste (the brand I buy tends to separate) as well as the milk. Steph

I made this as a side dish to Curried Pork Chops with Brandied Peach and Crabapple Chutney (on this site). Delicious combination! The rice was easy to prepare and very light in flavor. I had to add more liquid and cook the rice for a longer time before it was tender and substituted fresh parsley for the fresh coriander. It was well worth the wait. I substituted fresh parsley for the fresh coriander. My sister even asked for the recipe and she doesn't cook! This dish will be served again and again at my home. Sissy

This dish has become a staple of my household--easy to prepare with ingredients that are always on hand,instantly comforting, and a provocative match to any number of entrees (especially highly spiced ones). Goes particularly well with recipes of Mexican or Thai origin.
