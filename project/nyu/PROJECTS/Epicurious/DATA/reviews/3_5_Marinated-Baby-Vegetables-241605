followed recipe exactly. beautiful presentation and would work well for an impressive side dish. agree with other reviews, there was a lot of leftover oil, i would reduce by a third at least.

Horrible. I followed the recipe but added more veggies than called for because others commented there was too much sauce. The result was oily, pickled veggies. There was still way too much vinegar and oil. Also, the crunch and flavor from the whole fennel seeds was terrible and a fresher-tasting herb like parsley would have been much more appropriate. A waste of great produce!

It was awesome. In fact I am here today as I want to make it again

I agree on the oil. I halved and still thought it a bit much but was happy with all the vegetables. I used peruvian potatoes so it was a very colorful side.

This recipe calls for a ridiculous amount of olive oil, for it to be even edible you MUST cut the oil at least in half. I used Sherry instead of champagne vinegar and next time will use fresh herbs. The dried oregeno was not a winning flavor in my opinion. The combination of vegetables however can not be argued with and they are a pretty presentation.

Dee-licious! I tried adding broccoli once, but it broke up and muddled the whole thing. I always end up with way too much marinade and add more veggies!

Use only half of the volume of olive oil and vinegar. Great with baby carrots and cauliflower. Company quality.

gave this 4 forks if you 1/2 the olive oil. 1 cup is definitely too much.i also cut out the fennel as i'm not a fan. good alternative is to use sherry instead of vinegar (but less).

Vegetables were delicious, however, WAY too much olive oil. I'd make it again, just cut way back on the oil.

fun side dish - colorful and impressive flavor. It was even tastier a day or too later.

Delicious, and keeps its flavor and texture for days in the fridge. Don't let the vegetables marinate too long, however, or the vinegar will cause anything green to turn brown.
