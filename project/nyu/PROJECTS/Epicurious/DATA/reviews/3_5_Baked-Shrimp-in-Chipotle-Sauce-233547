Good flavor, but didn't care for the worcestershire sauce -- made it taste like the sauce in the Vienna Sausages. Next time i make it I will reduce or leave out the worcestershire. Took the suggestions of other reviewers and used 3 Tb Butter in the sauce, white wine, more garlic and lot less salt. Whisked in 3 more TB butter at the end and reduced the sauce. I made this with jumbo prawns as a main course and served with BA Saffron Rice and Red Pepper Pilaf.

This was outstanding!! HOWEVER...a bit hot. I used 3 Chipotle's and it was a bit much. I would seed them next time and reduce them by one. I also added a tablespoon of honey, very amazing. I followed others suggestions and doubled the sauce but not the butter, added no salt and added 1/2 of the butter to cook the garlic and chipotles in then after I baked the shrimp I reduced the sauce again and added the remaining butter. Very amazing dish!!

This was fantastic, better than the BBQ shrimp at Pascal's Manale, and I don't say that lightly. I made this with 3/4 lb shrimp to feed two and left the rest unchanged, so if you're going whole hog I would definitely double the sauce. Also, someone upthread recommended using half the butter at the beginning and reducing the sauce/whisking in the rest of the butter at the end; DO THIS. Makes it taste extremely restaurant-y. I served the shrimp with corn fritters instead of bread (gluten allergies make for some necessary innovations) and celery root remoulade. Fantastic.

This got rave reviews from my friends and there was not a drop of sauce left. I doubled the amount of garlic and added a good squirt of honey to the sauce. I will make again.

This was easy and delicious. I was worried that the chiles would be too spicy, since I have only used the adobo sauce previously but it was fine. I left the seeds in one chile and seeded the other. Next time I will use only 1/2 teaspoon salt because it was too salty. The sauce was great with homemade bread.

We made this receipe with cod (mistake). In general it just tasted like a uninteresting, dull, wine sauce and turned the fish a purple/grey. Not very attractive. I am sure there are much better receipes out there. Do not waste your time with this one. It would have ruined shrimp too.

Way Tasty. I was going to follow the comments, but then forgot to, so it was pretty much to the recipe. I made this on catfish, not shrimp, and it worked really well. Cooked it at 450 for about 20 minutes I guess. Just about the right amount of sauce, probably could have used a bit more garlic. I didn't reduce the sauce, in part because it seemed really thin, like it really wouldn't make a dipping sauce. I think I probably would just make another batch and add creme if I want something to dip in... I think that this is a really good basic sauce that could be added to anything.

I make this recipe all the time! I am not a big fan of shrimp, but I use the sauce on chicken, too. I just cook the chicken on a skillet until its almost cooked through and then put it in the oven for 8-10 min. so it gets the flavor of the sauce and finishes cooking. Also, for the sauce, I double all of the ingredients (except salt) so there is extra to dip the baguette in. This is a family favorite and I make it for guests all the time!

At the suggestion of others, I doubled the sauce (but used only 6 Tbs of unsalted butter: half at the beginning of the recipe, and half at the end-- whisked in to velvetize the sauce. I used white wine instead of red, and LOTS more garlic. I used 1.5 large chipotles and about 2 tsp adobo, and the heat was fine (despite some initial concerns). My guests deemed this to be of restaurant quality. I served it with grilled olive bread,lightly brushed with extra-virgin olive oil. Definitely a keeper.

The first time I made this recipe was for a potluck. I made it as is. It was a hit. It was the first thing to go. The next time I made it, I used lard instead of butter and added an additional chipotle (they break up badly when you chop them). Again, a big hit.

Rating: 4
I thought this was wonderful as is, but the idea of processing the chilis and adding the butter later sounds great. Also next time I will add an extra chili and double the sauce to serve on rice.

Great recipe!! I doubled the sauce and added more chipotle. Not sure where ssdscott is coming from. The flavors were far from "flat and boring".

What's great about this recipe is how fast and easy it is, and the result is really tasty. Followed the advice of other reviewers: doubled the sauce, cut way back on the butter and whisked it in last, and cut the salt to a scant half teaspoon. Used white wine - no problem. Garnished with a bit of chopped parsley for color. Will definitely be making this one again.

Made this using the recommendation to lower the salt & add the butter at the end - the sauce came out very velvety. I wish I'd used the recommendation to peel the shrimp beforehand. This is nice & spicy, but I found the smoky flavor a little off-putting and DH (who is cuban & loves spicy foods) found this "flat & boring". Reasonably tasty, but not great. Definitely easy to make, if you like the flavors.

I followed some of the previous reviewers' recommendations such as adding the butter at the end of the cooking process and doubling the sauce. the sauce definitely needed to be doubled. Adding the butter at the end made it incredibly velvet-y. It had a nice bite to it. could be served over rice for a more hearty main dish. Even some peppers and onions might be a nice addition. Would definitely make this again.

Very tasty recipe. The chipolte chili gives it a very good taste. I would make a few changes. I found this to be just a little too spicy for us. Next time, only one chili and 1 tsp. adobo sauce. Found it too salty and will use only 1/2 tsp. salt. I used the same pan to bake the shrimp, less dishes. This is a keeper.

Rating: 1
I'm not sure where I went wrong (followed the recipe exactly other than cutting down on the salt) but the end result tasted like red wine and the shrimp didn't get pink like they would if you sauteed or grilled them. I assume the dish was supposed to look attractive, but the wine colored shrimp was a turn off. One of the few Epicurious recipes that didn't work out for us and landed in the disposal.

Rating: 4
SO good. Quick, easy, and AMAZING. Do cut down on the salt - I typically double the salt in almost everything - and appreciated the advice to cut back on this one. Be careful with the chipotles and adobo - they get VERY spicy very quickly!

For a no-fuss, quick dinner, this was outstanding. Peel the shrimp before hand for less mess.Per previous reviewer's instructions, I incorporated the butter as the last step and cut WAY back on the salt. We enjoy highly salted foods, so I was skeptical about that, but 1/2 teaspoon of salt was plenty. Also, I lightly browned the garlic before adding the other ingredients. It turned out great! My husband loved it, and I will definitely be making this again.

Spectacular, rich and tangy. I have never used canned chipotle peppers before I discovered this recipe. I use them all the time now. Shrimp serves well wrapped at the table by your guests in soft tortilla wedges.

Thanks to everyone who submitted all the great tips for this dish. Cutting the salt, adding more chilpolte and adobe sauce, and whisking in the butter after baking was what made this recipe a keeper.

Made this very easy and delicious dish last night for a party. Everyone loved it. DH loved it so much that he requested it again tonite- So I made it again(so easy that it takes barely 5 minutes of prep!) I used shrimp in shell. Might try it without next time just to compare- but we had fun with the mess! and the flavor can't be beat!

Very nice! One change: it's better to peel the shrimp before cooking. This makes things much cleaner.

We liked this dish as a meal rather than an appetizer. It is easier to peel the shrimp first before baking (to cut down on the mess factor).

We really liked this, but I'd make a few more changes the next time. I doubled the sauce as others did, and I reduced the salt, as per other reviewers' suggestions, but I'd reduce it a lot more next time -- and I'm a salt fiend, usually. Next time, I'll add the salt little by little to the sauce *after* cooking -- removing the shrimp from the sauce first. To save the over-salted dish this time, I put the sauce back in a pot on the stove and added wine and water to dilute. I thickened the resulting liquid with a slurry of cornstarch and water, which gave the sauce its body back, and also happily served to bind the butter into the sauce (rather than being all floaty on top). The next time, I'll take the suggestion of the reviewer who recommended adding the butter after the sauce comes out of the oven, thus emulsifying it better. Also, this time, I took the suggestion from one reviewer to add a few chopped tomatillos, and that was great -- they added a really nice, slightly tart level. As a one-dish dinner, a pound-and-a-half of #21-25 shrimp (that's all they had at whole foods -- damn the superbowl sunday crowd) fed two of us quite heartily. Definitely a keeper, with the tweaks. I'll probably also try this sauce with mussles... yum!

This was very tasty. Having bread on hand is a must to soak up the delicious juice. It's good even cold the next day. If you or your friends like spicy foods, try this.

This is wonderful, but I made a few modifications to make it more like the bbq shrimp we had at a New Orleans restaurant. First, I set the butter aside and proceeded with the recipe, doubling the amount of sauce for the shrimp. I cooked the shrimp in the butterless sauce in the oven, then when the shrimp were cooked, I removed them to a warm plate, and placed the sauce over the lowest heat. I cut the cold butter into pieces, then whisked in the pieces one at a time until all the butter was added. Take off heat immediately, add back the shrimp, and serve with crusty bread. By doing it this way, the sauce is emulsified, much like a buerre blanc, and it is velvety and smooth. It is imperative not to heat the sauce too much when adding the butter, or the sauce will break. IF this happens, no big deal, you'll end up with the same thing you would have had should you have done the recipe as printed. When doubling the sauce, I didn't double the amount of chiles, thought is would be too hot. You can always add more. This is a great appetizer, or light supper with a salad. Definitely a keeper!

I doubled the sauce, adding more garlic and chipotles and using only a pinch of kosher salt. I also followed the previous reviewer's advice and melted everything in the oven. It was difficult to get the chipotles finely minced. I may try to the food processor idea next time.

Rating: 3
On the money....yummy and easy. Great lazy Friday night dinner with a cold beer. I didn't even melt the butter first ....put everything in the baking pan except the shrimp, melted in the oven and stired it together...added shrimp, and back into the oven. Had a broccoli slaw (bagged mix, homemade dressing)with it. Can't get much easier.

Not bad at all, and very easy. I happened to use peeled deveined shrimp and it came out just fine. I also cut down on the salt and the butter (in my opinion a little butter goes a long way!). Next time I will chop the chipotles and garlic in the food processor; I had a hard time getting the chipotles small enough to be really well integrated into the sauce.

This was incredibly easy and tastes great. I squeezed a little lime juice and sprinkled some chopped cilantro over the shrimp before putting in the oven. Will definately become a staple around our house.

This dish was very simple to make, however there are other ways to treat shrimp that taste much better. It was very salty, so I would omit that and I would deseed the pepper. A great dish if you want a spicy shrimp curry.

to teamfyr: the recipe reads "1 to 2 canned chiles" meaning 1 or 2 chiles, not 1 or 2 cans of chiles. You will enjoy it more this way...

I loved the flavor! Will definetly be making again. I used 2# of shrimp so I thought using the two cans of chipotle, doubling up the adobe, and doubling the wine would be Ok. I found it too hot to enjoy after about 5 minutes. Next time will make with just one can of the chipotle. I enjoy and can take the spicy foods, but this batch just kept gaining heat with the more I ate. I'm glad I found it!

Enjoyed it a lot; even left overs tasted delicious. Didn't find chilis in adobo, so used adobo spice and made own adobo sauce, but without the chipotle chilis, so probably missed some of the "fire" other writers described. The bread soaking up the sauce was great, and basically easy to make.

I loved this recipe! I did alter it just a little though. To offset the wine & salt I doubled the chipotle peppers & added just one more teaspoon adobo sauce. Love, love, loved it!

It's spicy, it's fiery and it's fabulous! I used both shrimp and scallops in my version and the sauce is excellent on both....and especially wonderful sopped up on a crusty dense bread. My husband wolfed this down. I will probably add more garlic the next time, and I will definitely be making it again. Two thumbs up on the YUMMY-ness factor!
