Ok, I have no idea what happened with my tuiles. I followed the directions EXACTLY, and they did not hold their shape when I tried to remove them with the spatula. They bunched up into smushed oatmeal blobs. I ended up just breaking them all up into oatmeal-like granola and will try to just sprinkle it over ice cream or something.

Delicious! Came together in minutes (exactly as written) and everyone loved them - will make them again tomorrow and serve with vanilla ice cream. A real keeper.

These are great and, as has already been mentioned, very quick to make. They'd be excellent with vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe! Very yummy. I added 1/2 c of oats instead of using only 1/4. I also found it did not nearly make the amount what the recipe said it would make (says it will make 12, got only 6). Perhaps I made them too big? Will double to recipe next time.

These cookies turned out exellent! I used a half a cup of sugar instead of a quarter and they were a little too dry but after I made them again they were Great! I'd definitley reccommend them to anyone lookin for an amazing recipie with limited time.
