Very easy and very tasty. Accompanied it with boiled small potatoes and steamed green beans. Just for myself and my wife this time, but will be happy to serve it to company.

We prepared three tenderloins, and served them with Basmati Rice with Sweet Onions and Summer Herbs, and Shrimp-Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms...Everyone loved it!

This was a very flavorful sauce. I prepared it with a whole fillet tenderloin, not steaks. I only had cognac, and used that without a problem. Because I was not sauteing steaks, I just sauteed the shallots in butter first, then added cognac, etc. I also did not add the butter at the end, as I thought it was rich enough.

This is amazingly delicious. I didn't have port so I just used a little more brandy. Also,I as I don't use canola oil (yuck) I used olive oil instead. Yum!

I made this a while ago and misplaced the recipe; now that I've found it, time to make it again. It was a hit, but again, we like our steaks medium to medium well...

I'm with the folks that said the sauce was a bit bland. I followed a suggestion and added some mushrooms which helped. It just needed somehting. It wasn't bad just wasn't amazing.

Good recipe, but I made a few tweaks. First of all, I used the butter basting method of the recipe, but I would not do it again. I did not see the benefit over my regular 4 min on one side, 5 on the other method of pan searing a steak. I cut down the cooking time to 10 min (from the 12 in the recipe) and it was still medium when we prefer medium rare. For the sauce, I sauteed some mushrooms first, then added them in with the shallots. My husband said the mushrooms made the sauce, so I would recommend that alteration. I cut back the mustard a little, and I added a little heavy cream at the end with less butter. The sauce was heavenly - it ended up making a great Valentine's Day meal along with my favorite mashed potatoes with cremini mushrooms from this site along with roasted asparagus, and the garlic-rosemary shrimp from this site as the starter.

I was an absolute idiot and totally overcooked our rather thin steaks . . . the pepin method wouldn't have saved me I was that dumb. that said, the sauce came out absolutely divine (used all the pan drippings, not just 3T worth) and it was miraculous to even save my poor overcooked steaks. a worthy recipe indeed!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. I used a tenderloin roast, and seared it in the pan substituting canola for olive oil and all the spices in the recipe. Transferred to the oven and baked covered lightly with foil at 200 until medium rare. The sauce was great once it cooked down- -even the teenagers loved it.

Although the sauce is good, I think it was a huge mistake to pan fry filet mignon! The beef lost much of its juice during frying, and came out rather flavorless. A big disappointment for a special Valentine's dinner.Filet mignon is very expensive, to waste on frying it. Would not make it again.

I agree with the other reviewers that the cooking time is way too long for medium- rare steaks. But then again I think a 7 or 8 ounce steak is way too big. I usually get a 4oz., but I went all out for this recipe and got 6oz. steaks. I thought the sauce was great, and I might try it on some other meat.

Excellent and fairly easy recipe, a staple of my home based catering business; keep the chicken stock low sodium and always use fresh herbs for great results

Great sauce! I made it for grilled rib eyes. Since I was grilling the steaks, I simmered the 3 tablespoons butter with smashed garlic and thyme for about 10 minutes and used that in the sauce. The outcome was wonderful.

Very good. Used half a tenderloin instead of steaks as that is what I had, which I pan roasted to med rare. Made the sauce as directed but strained it after reducing for a silky texture. Sauce was very good but needed a little more oomph to make it outstanding. Maybe use 1/2 beef 1/2 chicken broth or a demi glace? Hubby loved it, but then he'd had 2 martinis by the time we ate.

This sauce was excellant. I did not use any chicken stock but used the liquid from dried Patagonia mushrooms. I have served it over chicken breast and Argentina Lomo (filet tenderloin) and it is great!

This was outstanding! The flavor was distinct and yummy! I was apprehensive about making this. I was unsure of how long to cook it and I was unfamiliar with the Pepin method everyone was talking about. I also found that it took a very long time for the sauce to cook down, much longer than stated in the recipe. However I pulled it off and my guests all raved.

The sauce was out of this world - I've used it over any cut of beef and it's just incredible. Highly recommended.

I made the recipe as stated and used the Pepin baking method. I used venison chops. The dish was heavenly, and a bigger hit was the spinach-garlic custards that I paired with it.

This was awesome! I used the Jacques Pepin method to cook the beef suggested by other reviewers. Thank you! It worked perfectly. The meat cooked in the oven, while I cooked all the sides on the stove. I didn't know how long to cook the beef either, but miraculously they turned out perfect! Some pieces were medium and thicker cuts were medium rare. The beef was so tender and the sauce complemented it perfectly. I paired it with green beans with shiitake mushrooms (from this site) and garlic mashed potatoes. Also, a special bottle of 1990 St. Emilion Bordeaux. Wonderful...

Absolutely delicious sauce. I used homemade stock, so it wasn't too salty. I strained the sauce just before adding the final butter, because I thought the large pieces of herbs and garlic would detract from the dish. I did leave in a bit of the shallots. By the time this is reduced, you've gotten all the flavor from these items and the sauce will have a silkier appearance.

Question: How long do you leave it in the oven with the J. Pepin method? I want to try it, but am scared of overcooking such a wonderful cut of meat!

Rating: 3
Very easy and totally delicious. No timing or carving worries. Usually I prefer to brown then finish meat in the oven, but this time I felt no compulsion to change a single thing. Still achieved a fabulously tasty sauce with perfectly med/rare and properly rested meat without drama. This is a keeper for me.

I made this dish for my husband's birthday. It was fantastic! I took a reader's suggestion and used the Jacque Pepin method and the steak was perfectly medium-rare...but closer to rare, the way we like it. I did use brandy instead of the cognac because that is what I had on hand and the sauce was spectacular! Full of flavour and just a hint of heat from the dijon mustard. The steak just melts in your mouth. As the magazine article suggested, I made it with the oven roasted mushrooms. I also made sauteed asperagus and roasted pototoes. We will be enjoying this dish again.

Excellant recipie, made it for a friend last night, we loved it. I didn't have thyme and subed fresh sage, I intend to do this again.

Would you believe it? I just reread the recipe and it says "low-salt chicken broth". I just proved why reading the recipe is so important.

Rating: 2
I think this might be a great recipe but I found it overwhelmingly salty to the point that I couldn't appreciate any subtlety of flavor. I would use low-sodium chicken broth and not use any salt on the meat the next time. Also it was too well-done the way the recipe is written. I like steak rare to medium-rare and this came out a disappointing medium-well. But the sauce SMELLED fabulous and it has all my favorite ingredients so I'll try it again.

This was OK, but nothing phenomenal. There are far better mustard sauces out there. We thought any subtle flavors of the Cognac were overwhelmed by the mustard. Not even sure why the port was in there at all; it seemed to add little to nothing. The best thing I can say about this is that is was fairly quick and very easy. Cut back on the mustard and it would be a good dish for a beginner-level cook to impress dinner guests with.

Phenomenal! Don't be wasteful - use all the delicious pan drippings. We also used (and prefer) the Pepin baking method of the commenter below. This was so delicious, our guests were raving. Do this sauce justice and use the freshest tenderloin steaks you can possibly find.

I prefer Jacques Pepin's style of grilling beef: Sear the steaks in the pan for a couple or three minutes on a side, then transfer them to a 250 degree (or less) oven; let gently cook through. This way you avoid that overcooked exterior and undercooked interior; i.e. you end up with beautiful, even red meat across the width of the steak. Let stand before serving, of course, which allows the juices to spread out. The mustard sauce is marvelous.

I have to agree with the first reviewer in that this dish would be suitable for company. My husband and I thought the mustard flavor was a little too strong, so the next time I will use about a teaspoon less.

This was excellent. Wonderful company or special-event dinner. Sauce was great without overwhelming the meat. However, 12 minutes for medium rare is too long! I took them off in 10 and next time will put them in the oven even sooner.
