I searched for this recipe for years after reading about it in a book about the Holocaust. I made it yesterday but the cake was rock hard and the filling too sloppy it just ran all over the place. Do you think I should add more semolina *That is what we call creamed wheat in England? I am not Jewish so no problem with eating it

I don't think so.

Give me a break, 3 tbsp. of honey does not qualify a cake to be called a honey cake. With this as a refernce, would a cake with 3 tbsp. od cinnamon be called a cinnamon cake. I wasted time clicking on in my search for a new honey cake

To the cooks that it came out "hard". The key is to let the pastry sit a while before cutting or eating it. The honey will soften it eventually, but it usually needs to stand at least 24 hours, not 6. We also have a recipe similar to this in my family, but no one ever told me that you have to wait so long!

This is a fine recipe, but please note that your menur which includes it is in complete contravention of Jewish dietary laws and it is especially unthinking to promote it for one of the most important Jewish holidays.

This is a horrible recipe. The first time I made it it was as hard as a rock. I could have played baseball with it. I tried it again and it was plain disgusting. I incourage no one to make it.
