Excellent pork recipe - but a little "catsup-y". I reduce reduce the catsup and add a bit more onion and garlic. The second time, I added tamarind juice for in place of apple. Subtle but noticeable.

I haven't tried this particular recipe yet, but if it's anything like the other recipes in Mike Mill's book Peace, Love and Barbecue, then I'm sure it's amazing. I love that book and have made many things, the Magic Dust recipe is in there too. I always have a shaker bottle of it in my cabinet :)

This is the best BBQ recipe in my file. The magic dust is the perfect rub; we put it on everything. The sauce is sweet and tangy and smoky. Love it.

Oh Great, Nothing like leaving out 3 hours worth of actually COOKING the meat. Nice job

Shorthand for smoking directions in the July '06 magazine: smoke according to your grill manufacturer's directions (about 3 hours, turning occasionally until temp reads 160 degrees F. Why would Epicurious leave this out??

The most important element to this recipe is the "Magic Dust". I've used it on different meats and is especially good on slow cooked ribs. It is the best rub - magically outstanding. I first used it after seeing it in Bon Appetite.

this sounds good but where are the insructions for the smoking?

this online version doesnt include the three hours of indirect smoking as the first cooking step Saw it in the magazine first. Outstanding dish
