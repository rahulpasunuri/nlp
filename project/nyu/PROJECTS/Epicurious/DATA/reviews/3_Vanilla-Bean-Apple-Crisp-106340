Just finished eating this dessert. Not bad but perhaps I goofed up. The apples all turned basically to apple sauce. I wonder if cutting the apples thicker or dropping the temperature or cutting back on 1st baking time might help. It was like warm apple sauce with a crumble over it. Would try it again with some adjustments.

Not what anyone expects from what looks like an apple crisp. Watched my guests make surprised faces as they tasted weird and unexpected flavors paired with apples. Would not make this again. Try the lovely Cinnamon Apple Crisp on this site for something really delicious and a little more traditional.

Very Nice and sweet but i think adding a little extract wont hurt it tastes great!

I wantedto kick this recipe up a bit, so I added allspice and ground cloves along with the cinnamon--and if you like a slight layer of heat, two or three shakes of cayenne pepper. The pepper blends and becomes an underlayer of flavor.

Simultaneously too sweet and bland.

Made this with gala and macintosh apples and utilized an entire vanilla bean. The firmer galas kept the apple mix chunky even after baking. Unfortunately in an attempt to cut down on sugar, I used Splenda and granular sugar in equal amounts for the topping which makes for a finer crumb and not the usual chunks. Still was excellent.

My husband says "blah". Made it as written. There was nothing about this recipe that we liked. I only used 1/2 the vanilla bean and not sure what would have improved with using the whole bean. The topping was not special, nor were the apples - which were mushy. Apple crisp is one of our favorite recipe. What did I miss? Everyone else seemed to love this recipe.

I about doubled the recipe using 3lbs of Galas and 1lb of pears. turned out very tasty. had to bake it quite a bit longer, but I didn't have a problem w/my apples turning into applesauce. they held up nicely and tasted great.

This is the first ever recipe I made that involved vanilla bean. I was very pleased with how this crisp turned out. The vanilla scent was lovely, and delicious! The difference with this recipe is that the apples melt into more of a thickened sauce. If that is alright with you, I would recommend this dish!

I have made this recipe MANY times...too many to count. I work at a gourmet kitchen shop and we have served this recipe to customers...a smashing success!!! I too used the whole bean, it makes a big difference. FYI: there is a product made by Nielsen-Massey, vanilla bean paste, that makes the preparation that much easier. I used a previous tip concerning different types of apple and found that the Gala apple tasted the best. Thanks Bon Appetit!

I am a freshmen in college, and am always looking for simple, tasty recipes to prepare. This one qualifies. I made it for a friend's birthday, inviting only a couple of people, but we ate it all! I even really messed up with the amount of flour to put in, but I saved it and it tasted great.

I thought this was a great crisp- it tastes even better the second day after a night in the fridge. It was too sweet straight out of the oven- I'd tone down the sugar unless you really love super sweet desserts. I used a mix of McIntosh, Granny Smith and Golden Delicious apples and it worked pretty well. I'll make it again, but probably with 3/4 of a cup of sugar

If 5 forks was an option, this would get it. This was so easy to make and it was extremely tasty. Prepared it in advance and then cooked it while eating dinner. Held up well for leftovers heated in the microwave too. Have made this a few more times. Added raisins which was a good idea. Added raisins and dried cranberries and although good it was a bit too tart. If you want to add cranberries I would suggest adding a bit more sugar to sweeten them up.

Wonderful~ Very tart. I too used the entire vanilla bean and feel that is crucial. To those of you with a sweet tooth, add a little extra sugar~

This apples crisp recipe is the BEST I have ever made. Eveyone was pleased and begged me for the recipe. I did use the entire vanilla bean for more flavor and it worked out nicely.

I have a love of sweets, and I thought this recipe had too much sugar. I would definitely cut down the amount of sugar, and maybe next time I will experiment with different types of apples. Also, use the whole vanilla bean and more nutmeg and cinnamon.

This was a great crisp. I used an entire vanilla bean rather than 1/2, and a combo of Pink Lady and Gala apples rather than the Granny Smiths. The topping was outstanding, and the filling was luscious. It was also easy to make!

This was super easy to put together. I used a whole vanilla bean, and would even use more. I was surprised by the rave reviews I got for what seemed to be such a simple dessert.

Very good! I also used more vanilla bean than the recipe called for and found that that worked out fine. I've had better "crisp", but would definitely make this recipe again.

By far the best apple crisp I have ever made. The recipe is also easier than other recipes I've used in the past. Serve with high quality vanilla ice cream! Yum!
