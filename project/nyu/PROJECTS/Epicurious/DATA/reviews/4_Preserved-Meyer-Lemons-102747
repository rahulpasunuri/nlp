I thought, why waste the peel of the juiced lemons? I removed any remaining pulp, cut them into rings and added them to the jars.

I found a recipe similar to that described by by gotchabarbara on 02/17/05. Mine was 'simpler' in that it did not call for more than salt. In early July 2011 I washed and dried enough ripe Meyer lemons to fill a liter European bail top glass jar. I cut out the stems, quartered them to near the 'nipple', packed them with salt and stuffed them into the bottle. My instructions (See: http://www.pilotguides.com/tv_shows/planet_food/food_guides/morocco/preserved_lemons.php) recommended against additional spices and suggested that the lemon juice and olive oil are also unnecessary. Within a week the lemons had settled a bit and they were 90% immersed in their own juices. I put the jar in my 'cellar,' a large insulated plywood box cooled with a wine cellar cooler. It maintains 55F year round. I tasted a bit of the peel this evening (after 7 months storage) and could not taste any remarkable lemon character. I was very much reminded of Indian lime pickle without the hot pepper and spices. I thought I'd add these observations: 1) long term storage at cellar temperature results in 'lemon peel kraut.' 2) the rave reviews of others may reflect 'early ' sampling of the product. Have any who tried this recipe kept the lemons long enough to have a similar experience? I would not make it again, soon, because I have a large jar full. baumgrenze

I used lemons from my tree and think this is a great way to preserve lemons and also great gifts. Last forever and keeps very well in fridge.

I made this recipe this past Christmas, as Meyer Lemons were abundant in my specialty grocery store. I have two dwarf Meyer trees but they were not quite ripe enough to use. I will though, when the time is right. I used 1-pint jars as my canning medium, but prepared the recipe to the letter as directed. While the finished product makes a beautiful presentation...the Meyer's in their juice with the olive oil are bee-u-ti-ful!, I must admit to having trouble after blanching the lemons for 5 minutes. They were soft and although I have professional cutlery, they were still difficult to work with. I think the next time I do this recipe, I will not cut them down into eight pieces per lemon, opting to leave some of the slices larger, as I believe they will be easier to work with. Being cut into 8th's after blanching, they were soft, and some of the flesh was separating from the rind. But I managed, and was quite pleased. But would revise the way I did it next time. Otherwise, top-notch recipe! An added little tip not related to the recipe: Meyer lemon slices freeze very well. After washing your lemoms, cut them into round slices, then half those slices (removing the seeds) and lay them on small baking sheets and cover them tightly and flash freeze them in your freezer. When completely frozen, remove them from the baking sheet and store in airtight containers in your refrigerator. Because of the flash-freezing, they stay seperate, and are wonderful used in cocktails and just water for dinner, almost acting as lemon ice cubes. Even after thawing inside your drink, I still found they were just as tasty as ever.

I made the "preserved meyer lemon recipe" listed here on Epicurious. Easy, except for when it came to cutting the cooled, blanched Meyer lemons. Despite using a very sharp professional knife, it was not an easy task (seeding was particularly difficult) cutting into the blanched, softened lemons..the skins became VERY soft. But I managed to can three, 1-pint jars of Meyer's (using 6 good-sized Meyer's as a base), and covering with their juice, which I will continue to shake gently for five days before adding the olive oil. Well worth the trouble, as having Meyer's hanging around for an extra year is well worth it. I love these lemons, the gourment of lemons IMHO, and I have two of my own trees growing as I write this. I will say, and I don't know how long they will last, that I cut my original Meyer's into rounds, then into half-moons and flash-froze them and safely secured them in containers in my freezer. They are fine. And make an exellent accompaniment to a lemon martini. They act like lemon ice cubes in a Meyer lemon martini...recommending Williams-Sonoma Meyer Lemon Drop mix as the base. A heavenly martini! Made by "Stirrings" but exclusively for Williams-Sonoma. You can get a regular lemon drop mixer from Stirrings, but they only make the Meyer for Williams-Sonoma. What a shame. But with my method of flash-freezing the half moons of Meyer's, you'll never serve another Meyer martini without this accompaniment.

To "gotchabarbara"...the addition of your spices seems like a great idea (the black peppercorns, allspice berries, and cinnamon sticks), but it seems to me if you want the TRUE flavor of a preserved Meyer lemon, you would preserve it as directed, as the added spieces/aromatics might end up interfering with whatever you choose to do with them later. It's always easy to add additional ingredients to infuse to lemons with flavor later on. JMHO...your recipe sounds FANTASTIC!

I haven't made this yet, so I can't write a review per se, but it looks like a wonderful way to keep those delicious lemons around a lot longer, at least til they're in season again! QUESTION: if you're preserving them in batches smaller than 6 cups, how do you adjust the oil (I'm assuming extra-virgin olive oil here). How would you adjust the olive oil for smaller containers? Just enough to cover to the top, 1/4" from the rim or so? Meyer's are my favorite and the gourmet of lemons to me. I have two trees that are fruiting right now, but won't be ready in time for the holidays to share. But my local specialty market is carrying them.

Very Yummy recipe

TO marc_allen: pack lemons *tightly* into jar leaving room at top for oil. After covering lemons with juice, you'll still have room for oil. "Add" oil to jar. Don't take out lemon juice, it's required for flavoring and preserving. If you adjust quantities, you can use smaller jars instead of 6c. jar.

Yum!! I live in the midwest and got Meyer lemons at Trader Jooe's.

These are very good. One question: After the 5 day soak, do I pour out the brine or add the oil without draining? The recipe seems to indicate the former, but, if you retain the brine, why refrigerate? And, since I filled the jar to the top with the lemon juice, how do I make room for oil?

If my hosue was on fire, I'd grab this jar of lemons on my way out. I really never expected them to be this amazing. Tonight I used two pieces, finely minced with peel and pulp included, in a hummus/yogurt dip. The fresh perfume of the meyers infused it and it was wonderful. They really are phenomenal and I can't wait to use them in other things.

I am a newbie at making preserved lemons. Who knew it would be this easy? It takes a little planning ahead to soak the lemons overnight, but the results are outstanding. It would make a great gift in a pretty jar, too. Our jar looked so lovely that we hated to open it, but thank goodness we did. This is a new staple for us. We made it exactly per the recipe. As a previous reviewer noted, preserved lemons can be used in many recipes. These were outstanding.

We've ALWAYS got a jar of preserved lemons in our refrigerator. We use them in all kinds of recipes. Nothing compares to them in taste, especially now that I've preserved Meyer lemons instead of supermarket lemons. No comparison! I don't cook mine at all. I cut my lemons from the top down, in 4 parts, going almost, but not quite to the bottom. Spread the lemon open and fill the center with kosher salt. Place in wide-mouthed jar. Continue doing this, packing the lemons very tightly, until the jar is almost full. Add about 6 black peppercorns, 4-6 allspice berries, and 1-2 cinnamon sticks. Fill the jar to the top with fresh lemon juice and cover. Leave out on countertop and shake the jar well at least once a day for 6 weeks. Refrigerate and use as needed. Remove the flesh, rinse and use the peel. You may also use the flesh after rinsing the salt off if you wish. You'll love it!

meyer lemon is actually is cross between lemon and orange - thats why its sweeter than usual lemons. does anyone know what kind of lemons are actually used in "authentic" morroccan preserved lemon recipe?

Someone asked: a Meyer lemon differs from the typical supermarket "Eureka" in that it is slightly sweeter and has a heavenly, ultra lemony scent. If you are familiar with lemon verbena, it's like that: more floral and less like Lemon Pledge than Eurekas. Meyer lemons have been rare outside California, as they were forbidden to be exported (some time in the mid-1900s) because of some pest (I think. I can't remember exactly, and Google isn't helping me). Anyway, they are the nirvana of lemons, and every time I visit my family in Georgia, I bring them. I also have been known to send books to friends, with Meyer lemons as the packing material.

I've never had these lemons before, so I have nothing to compare them to. If you enjoy Moroccan flavors and have Meyer Lemons growing in your yard, then having a large jar of these preserves in your fridge is a great. The flavor of the lemons definately mellows with age and they last in your fridge for up to a year.

Meyer lemons can be obtained from diamondorganics.com. This is a wonderful site.

A meyer lemon is a type of lemon (like apples are Rome, Gala, Fuji, etc.). Meyer lemons are generally sweeter and they are commonly found growing in every other yard in California. They are not too easy to find in other parts of the country.
