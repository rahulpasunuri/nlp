I added cilantro and lemon zest which made it so fresh and bright. Less oil and more lemon juice. Arugula might be great with it, too.

Easy to make (I used pearl barley and cooked it in a rice cooker), very nutritious, and looks great on the plate...but yet it didn't thrill me. Could be that I'm not a huge fan of barley. I was hoping the pecans or dill would work some magic, but no. I am going to have to move on to another recipe in my quest for barley goodness.

Under the pan-fried red snapper with chipotle butter, it was great. We made it without quick-cooking barley and, accidentally, without the dill and it was still delicious. Good leftovers for lunch the next day.

Although the recipe is very simple, it definitely lacks in imagination and flavour. I didn't try the blue cheese suggestion of another reader, but that may well do the trick.

Delicious!!! I toasted the pecans, substituted chopped red onion in place of shallot, and omitted the lemon juice. Then I added 1/3 c. or so of crumbled bleu cheese. This added the zip that several reviewers said the recipe needed.

This dish sneaks up on you. I agree that it does need a little zip, but even prepared as per the instructions, it just grows on you. I found myself continuing to nibble on it after I'd finished eating. The pecans really are they key. I hate to add saturated fat, but perhaps if they were sauteed in butter?

Nice texture and colour. A flavourful salad that's different. I toasted the pecans in a hot pan without oil and added less oil than the recipe called for directly into the barley mix. It was all absorbed by serving time so I added a small amount of a nice bottled dressing which worked well. Could use a bit more zip.

This is a terrific use of barley! I loved it. I added a bit of balsamic vinegar and left the rest alone. It was a big hit!

I have made this recipe four or five times over the summer and everyone who tried it has loved it. The lemon gives it a nice tang and the toasted pecans are wonderful. I am making it tonight for the annual "sisters-in-law weekend" at the lake.

I made this recipe in July because I was intrigued with the barley and pecans combo. Without the benefit of the other reviewers' responses, I added d'anjou pear vinegar (or I would have tried balsamic vinegar) because it did seem to need something. Now that several cooks have made additional suggestions, I'll make this again with those in mind.

A lovely and delicious side dish! I also added a half cup of wheat berries which added a wonderful crunch and texture. I also sauteed the celery, shallot, carrot and diced red & yellow peppers. I'm not big on raw onion/shallot. Not having tried it the original way, I can't comment but I really liked it this way! I wasn't sure about the lemon at first so I only added half of what was called for and kept adding more as I tasted it. It really did add a nice zip to the dish. This would also be great served hot as a barley pilaf type dish. I will definately make again.

Made this last night, and really enjoyed it. Very different texture, but delicious! I think I would like a little more tang, so may add more lemon juice next time, and also found the olive oil a bit much (would like more of the sweet pecan flavor, may use canola next time) but otherwise I loved it. However, doesn't go well with steak. Steak is a little too overpowering for it, would be better with chicken or fish. It's a very pretty salad, though, and a nice change of pace.

I usually love barley, but this dish was all wrong.

Although Alaska doesn't have the fresh dill available very often, I still went ahead and made the recipe using (UGH) the dried stuff. Anyway, the salad itself is delicious and was an instant hit at a recent gathering. This is staying in my recipe file for sure!!

What a unique and attractive salad! Definitely a keeper. I found it great chilled with a summer meal (also a break from my garden leaf greens). You may want to try this twist: I substituted slivered almonds for the pecans which were sautéed in olive oil infused with macadamian nuts and rosemary, used 1/2 the recommended dill (originally overpowering for some), less oil (as suggested by Sauna..thanks) and seasoned with multi-coloured pepper and juniper berries. As with the pecans the almonds added a pleasant nutty flavour, however with less "crunch". Sliced baby carrots not only saved some time, but complimented the appearance of the almonds. I just served this with grilled salmon and won rave reviews!

made it yesterday fir last night's dinner. Next time I might try lightly sauting the celery and carrots in the olive oil before adding the pecans. My guest loved it.

I didn't grow fresh dill this year so I used about 70% parsley and 30% basil to make 1/4 cup and it tasted very good. Cilantro would probably be good, too. Next time I'll use half the olive oil called for in the recipe. This is an unusual and delicious salad. The toasted pecans give it a crunchy/nutty richness which is complimented nicely by the delicate flavor of the shallots. Lots of eye appeal with the colorful veggies. You'll like this.
