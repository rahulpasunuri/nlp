Flat-out hands-down the best way to eat fresh corn. However, maybe only half of the cheese stuck and I ended up trying to find a polite way to scoop it from the serving platter and balance it on my corn for the next bite.

This corn is absolutely delicious -- a definite winner. The garlic butter, lime and queso fresco are ingredients that are made to go together. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

This was awesome. I used the garlic press instead of mincing - much more uniform texture. Used feta, tasted great, but next time I will try it with queso fresco to get another perspective. It will be my go to grilled corn recipe forever!!!

Made this for a BBQ. Some loved it, some hated it. I say forget the corn and just keep tons of that butter on hand! Melting it in the microwave to pour over popcorn is--though totally unhealthy--absolute heaven. The garlic gets soft like it does in the oven and the whole things smells and tastes beautiful!

Grilled corn is a summer BBQ staple in my family. I found this recipe by accident while planning for a rather large BBQ, and decided to give it a try. It was a HUGE success with everyone! it's easy, quick, and delicious! Have made it twice since then, substituting feta for the queso fresco. Amazing!

I will make this over and over again. The corn was very tender and juicy, and the garlic butter was a nice contrast to the sweetness of the corn. Yellow is a pretty color on the plate, too!

I LIKED YOUR GARLIC BUTTER, BUT YOU MAKE TOO MUCH WORK OUT OF COOKING CORN. FOR LARGE GROUPS I SOAK THE FRESH CORN IN A BUCKET OF WATER FOR AN HOUR OR MORE. I PLACE THE EARS ON THE GRILL TURNING 1/4 TURN EVERY 6 OR 8 MINUTES. IF THE HUSK STARTS TO BURN TURN SOONER. HERE IS THE NEAT PART. I USE A PAIR OF LINED RUBBER GLOVES TO HUSK & SILK THE EARS RIGHT AT THE GRILL TABLE. AFTER THE CORN IS COOKED THE SILK COMES OFF MUCH EASIER. I BREAK THE EARS IN HALF-INSERT A WOOD STICK IN EACH END & DIP IN A SMALL PAIL OF MELTED BUTTER. WE CAN GET 48 EARS ON 2 GRILLS & SERVE 80 PEOPLE AT A CHURCH PICNIC WITH 10 MINUTES OF PREP TIME. IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HOURS TO SILK THAT MUCH CORN & I FEEL THAT THE MOISTURE STAYS IN MUCH BETTER IF THE HUSK IS NOT OPENED. I PICKED THE CORN FRESH BEFORE CHURCH SO IT WAS ALREADY GREAT, BUT SOAKING IN WATER WILL REHYDRATE THAT STUFF YOU PEOPLE HAVE TO PUT UP WITH. MDJ

This was great! I did a dozen cobs, so it was squishy on my barbecue, and I probably should have cooked them longer. That being said, the butter and the lime made it perfect. I didn't have the time nor the energy to source the queso fresco, so I used freshly grated parmesan from the night before. It was so good, in fact, that I gave half my steak to someone else so that I had room in my belly to eat another cob!

Ridiculously good. You'll never want to make corn on the cob any other way! Don't be afraid when the corn husks get black, that's good, it gives the corn a nice smoky flavour. The very best kernels are the ones that have some browning, it means the sugar inside has caramelized. I know what I'll be doing with all the beautiful corn from the farmer's market!

Certianly a nice change, next time we thought that garlic powder in lieu of minced garlic would be better as it would distribute more easily and really stick to the corn. We used feta, I would be inclined to heat it a little make it soft enough to spread, again, so it'd stick to the corn. The flavor combination was a surprise, and makes me want to try some of the other variations I spotted as well.

I had to boil the corn, because our grill isn't big enough to do the corn and spare ribs at the same time. I liked the garlic butter, but the queso fresco didn't do anything for me, and I didn't like the texture of it. I think that feta would work better here.

Used feta instead of queso fresco - AWESOME!! Don't know if I'll be able to eat corn any other way . . .

I have made this many times. This latin twist on grilled corn on the cob lends an exotic flavor without overpowering the taste of the fresh sweet corn. Although this has proven to be a real crowd-pleaser (and easy to prepare!), I do usually have to leave a few ears plain for the kids. Queso fresco is available in the international cheese section of most grocery stores, but if you can't find it, freshly grated parmesan works just fine.
