Turned out much better than I expected. I marinaded the chicken beforehand in a Thai style marinade. Nice balance between sweetness & spice.

This recipe was very good and easy to make. However... healthy??? Has anyone ever read the nutrition label of coconut milk?! It's like 70% of your daily saturated fat in ONE serving. There are 7 servings in a can. Didn't realize it until we had already dumped the can in. I don't think I'll be making this again.

Very tasty and it couldn't possibly be easier to make. Will definitely be making this again. Only alterations were to only use half of the water (I like my curry a bit on the thick side), I used Lite Coconut Milk, and Green Curry Paste instead of yellow (it's what my grocery store had). Served over jasmine rice. Delicious. Next time I'll go to the local Asian market and look for Red Curry Paste for some more heat, or maybe add some Sriracha.

Made the recipe as is here on the page, with slightly more veggies than called for (but not much). Very tasty and a good mix of flavors. If you prefer a creamier sauce for your curry, then add less water than called for, and if you are sensitive to spicy food you may want to cut the amount of curry paste a bit and add some more coconut milk. Interested to try this recipe with green and red curry pastes. They seem to be more common than yellow and I bet would be just as good!

I followed this recipe exactly, except used red curry paste as I couldn't find yellow. Very disappointed. This was too liquidy and bland. The potatoes and carrots didn't cook completely after 20 minutes.

Great curry recipe. I didn't add the potatoes and I only added 1/3 cup of water. I also used red curry paste and it was perfect. But a great quick dinner.

I just made this. Didn't put in potatoes, did add mushrooms and broccoli. I should've put in less water given mushrooms add moisture. This dish is nice and spicy, I'm really liking it.

This dish has a good "time spent" to "yumminess" ratio. Such a quick dish to throw together and it's infinitely variable to whatever your latest diet is. Tofu instead of chicken and it's vegan! Sub cauliflower for potato, and it's pretty much paleo! Or just make it exactly as written, as I did, and enjoy.

I also could not find yellow curry paste so used yellow curry sauce from TJ's and no add'l liquid, except a splash of homemade chicken stock to be sure there was enough liquid to cook the veggies. Also used light coconut milk and a few extra veggies to clean out the produce drawer. Very good and easy to personalize as others have noted. Served over brown rice with Siracha on the table for those of us who like a little more heat. Will keep this in mind for future use!

I thought this was quite a tasty weeknight (and subsequent lunch) meal! I made the recipe as written, save for the fact that I eyeballed most of the ingredients and did use a bit less water than called for. Oh! I added a diced jalapeno as well. I found the spice level to my liking, and will keep this in my arsenal for future use/tinkering.

This is a good basic starting point for any curry. Like others, I made changes to make this 'mine', including 1 cup of chicken stock (no water) and red curry paste. I omitted potatoes but sub'd in sliced green onion and garlic in the initial saute. Also used yellow curry powder, garam marsala, cinnamon, and fish sauce for flavor and salt. Served over rice with choice of raisins, pineapple, p-nuts, cuke, coconut, apples, and chutney for toppings.

Very delicious. Easy to make. I added a drained, 8 oz. tin of pineapple chunks toward the end and served the dish over rice.

Has anyone ever found the yellow curry paste? Not I, so I used red and I used coconut cream instead of coconut milk, chicken breasts instead of thighs and chicken broth instead of water like some of the other reviewers suggested. I thought it was very good as is but I agree you could really tamper with it to make it your own. Very good will make again.

I substituted red curry paste with a T of chili paste for the yellow curry paste; cauliflower for the potatoes and I left out the water and added snow peas. I sauteed the chicken before blooming the pastes and added it back in at the end to warm it through. To keep the snow peas crispy I didn't put them in until about 5 mins cooking time left. The best part of this recipe is that you can experiment and have fun with it. DO NOT forget the fresh herbs at the end - they make all the difference.

Easy and delicious dish.

i used green curry which turned out insanely hot but tasty. also my veggies were mushy and i followed the directions to a t. not sure what happened but i'll add all of the veggies (with the exception of the onion) 1/2 way through the simmering next time.

I did add 3 cloves garlic, pressed, and diced ginger as well as a glug of fish sauce per the other suggestions. But what it really needed, I felt, was 2 TB brown sugar to bring up the flavor level. I also used sweet potato instead of spuds, and had no problem with the amount of water. Everyone loved the dish, and it will see many repeats.

If you have never cooked Thai food before, this is a very easy recipe to follow! I could not find yellow curry so I used green curry instead and it was very delicious!

Couldn't find yellow curry paste, so I used red. I used chicken broth instead of water and per other reviewers, only used 1 1/4 cups. Threw in frozen peas when I turned off the heat. I didn't rate with forks because of the few changes I made, but I would give my version four forks. Not bland at all, colorful and healthy, quick and easy to prepare. What can be better than all that?

Altered it a bit like others because I was worried it was too bland: -Replaced water with chicken stock -Used green curry paste, added a few dashes of yellow curry powder -Added two red, seeded, chilis -Added garlic and ginger -Added a handful of snow peas -Replaced Yukons for red 'C' potatoes Definitely not bland anymore. Turned out great.

Made this last night exactly as called for. Great flavor but a bit too much heat for us. I will cut the yellow curry paste in half next time.

Made this last night and we loved it! I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and chicken stock (2 cups) instead of water (I wanted it a little "soupy" to go better over brown rice) but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Husband had some for lunch this afternoon and said it had lost a little of it's original heat but that wasn't a bad thing. Like everyone else said, the cilantro and basil as garnish really complete this dish. I am definitely making this again. Delicious!

Made this curry on a weeknight. It was incredibly quick and easy. We used the low-fat coconut milk instead of the full fat stuff. Just add less water or you'll be boiling it to reduce the liquid for a while. We also used green curry instead of yellow (because that is what we had). Any curry will work. You can definitely add more spices and fish sauce to bump up the flavor, and any veggies will due.

I used Sun Luck Yellow Curry Paste and it definitely was NOT bland. I made it exactly as stated except that I served it over rice made with coconut milk and I look forward to trying this again. Such an easy weeknight dinner, the fresh herbs are a must. Great as is but will add some additional vegetables next!

It did turn out fairly bland when I made it too, but a little bit of Sriracha perked it right up. I omit the potatoes and put in some peas instead.

- Halved the water and could've stood to remove it entirely - Added a little bit of corn starch to make it less watery - Should've added some curry powder, ginger, and/or garlic to give it a little more kick. A solid, basic curry, easy to modify and tamper with - we had one person who didn't care for spicy food so it worked well enough without additional spice.

I doubled the recipe -- I, too, could not find yellow curry paste so used green. My only adjustments were less water (used only 2 cups); after cooking the veggies for about 10 minutes in the curry paste, I added about 1 Tbsp of curry powder. Once finished, I did add some sea salt. I served it over rice. We found it to be very flavorful. I agree w/other reviewers that the fresh herbs are key. Absolutely would make again.

I used red curry paste, as I already had it on hand. Recipe was very bland and very liquidy. Would suggest not adding as much water and definitely more carrots.

I agree that it was a bit weak in flavor and depth. I couldn't find yellow curry paste, so used yellow curry sauce (12 oz) and cut the water by 1/2, added a bit of ginger and more curry powder. A bit of cayenne pepper and/or red pepper flakes might add depth.

Delicious and easy! Used yellow curry paste. Didn't change the recipe at all...it didn't need any additional seasonings. Had just enough "heat" to make it delicious.

This was pretty bland. Couldn't fine yellow curry so used red. Added garlic and ginger but still blah. Needed salt and a Thai pepper or two to give it a punch. Won't make again.

I thought this was really good! My husband enjoyed it as well. I made it Paleo by leaving out the potato and doubling the amount of red peppers and tripling the amount of carrots. I also used red curry paste because I couldn't find yellow (which was fine because I think I prefer red). I also didn't have basil and only topped it with the cilantro. I am glad that I at least added that - the fresh herb REALLY enhanced the dish. I think this dish would be great with a few more additions, such as cashews. Seems like an easy recipe to tinker with.

I thought this was good, but anemic. It lacks that rich coconut milk flavor, despite having coconut milk in it, and is missing a deep curry flavor. I amped it up with more paste and a little curry powder and salt. Added chopped pineapple for sweetness. The basil and cilantro are a must and some chopped peanuts would be nice thrown on top, too. Will make again but with the changes.

Really good and simple. I couldn't find yellow curry. Used red and it was good. I also added other bell peppers and sweet potato and topped with toasted cashews.

..This was a huge success !! It was more yellow than red, like the picture is. Hubby said: "If you made this again, I'd be really happy" I used more carrots than 3/4 cups and added 1/2 tsp yellow curry powder (because I used green curry paste)...in the end it tasted Great ! The chicken thighs really added to the taste of the whole dish... Enjoy !

...Making this tonight for dinner, I just bought all the ingredients, yellow curry paste is very hard to find. I went to 2 markets and called another. Only saw green and red, I thought green would be better..... We shall see. I'll let you know....
