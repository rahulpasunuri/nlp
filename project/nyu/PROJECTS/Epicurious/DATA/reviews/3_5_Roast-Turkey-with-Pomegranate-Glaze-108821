I use this recipe every year for Thanksgiving. There's always a surprise because it's hard to get perfect, and the turkey takes longer than you would think, but it's well worth the hassle. My family asks for it every year. Remember to baste early and often to avoid the "burnt" look (doesn't taste burnt though). I'm looking forward to making it again in a few days!

This is absolutely outstanding. I cook for a chef who has worked with some 4 star chefs, and he said it was one of the memorable culinary experiences of his life. OK, perhaps over the top, but the flavor is so unexpected and complex that it is indeed memorable. Like the others, cooking times are longer than expected.

Like another reviewer, I tried this on a chicken (in anticipation of Thanksgiving, I'm trying out recipes) and while the color was beautiful, the flavor was just meh.

Made this the other night for Rosh Hashanah dinner - amazing. The gravy is to die for. Two things: you don't need to worry about buying pomegranate molasses, it's easy to make yourself with just pomegranate juice, lemon and sugar. Search for a recipe online. also be careful when separating the skin from the chicken to rub the sauce underneath - the skin can tear. But even if that does happen it is still super tasty! Highly recommend this!

The trouble with this dish is that my family won't let me make anything else. We've had it 3 years in a row and we're having it again this year. I learned a tip on the radio about ensuring even cooking.. take the turkey out of the oven and cover the breast with ice before you pop it in the oven... I also cover the turkey in with cheesecloth and pour the pan juices over it. And tent the skin with foil about half way through. It takes longer than the recipe says.

This was outstanding. Used a kosher turkey and the meat was moist and delicious. The resulting gravy was fantastic. A really nice change to traditional roast turkey. My only problem was that it took much longer to cook than the recipe suggests (5 hrs vs 2.5).

Could not find Pomegranate Molasses but used Apricot Preserves instead. Slightly increased ammount of glaze for a 20lb bird. Found that the skin crisped radidly and then almost got to the point of being burndt. The meat was VERY MOIST. I used a Convection oven and it took around 3 hours at 325-350 degrees. Also put an aluminum foil tent on top.

My family and friends just LOVED this! I had to special order the pomegranate molasses - guess it' not a common ingredient here in the SW. ;-) Be careful to tent the turkey to avoid excessive darkening of the skin. The molasses has enough sugar that the bird browns really quickly and needs to be watched. I have been asked (begged even) to make this again this year. Fine with me!!

This recipe sounded incredible, but I found that the glaze was watery and not very flavorful. Also, I'm a novice turkey-cooker, but I think you should cover the turkey with foil from the very start. The breast meat cooked SO much faster than the thigh meat.

This turkey was excellent. I used one recipe worth of glaze for a 22 pound turkey, it was plenty. The fresh roasted turkey looked and tasted great, but the cold leftovers were even better! Next time I might not stuff the cavity with the lemon, this made for very nice tasting meat but the gravy it made was a bit too tart and lemony (lemon flavored gravy seems weird to me).

Excellent! I made this for a between Thanskgivign and Christmas family dinner. It got rave reviews from even the pickiest eaters at the table. Even more impressively, they asked that for thanksgiving next year we use this recipe....for over ten years there has been no messing allowed with the thanksgiving recipes so that's saying a lot! Easy to make, and delicious. Definitely a winner!

I agree--this was unusual and really delicious. I made it with a kosher turkey (though a brined turkey would also work well, I'm sure) and it was great. Served it with a wonderful cranberry/tangerine/crystallized ginger relish from the 11/02 issue of Bon Appetit, as well as a rice/dried fruit/pecan dressing on the side. The combination was a big hit! I also found that the turkey browned very quickly, though, and I would cover it sooner than directed, too, the next time around.

I have been using Bon Appetit's recipes for Thanksgiving dinners since 1984 with great success. This year, everybody said, I outdid myself. Thank you! This recipe (together with the bread, mint, apricot, and pistachios stuffing and other recipes from the November issue) worked out perfectly! The turkey was light and satisfying (someone said: sassy ;^) ). A perfect balance of tastes! And I cook for two chefs every year, so my audience is really hard to please. The most important: I was satisfied with the effect and I almost never please me ;^). Can you believe I have no leftovers? Everyone asked for doggy bags! Now, how am I going to top that next year? :^O You will think of something dear Bon Appetit, won't you? Thanks!

Very nice, tangy and moist, but the turkey skin darkened very quickly and looked almost burned. I ended up covering the bird much earlier...next time, I'd skip the 400-degree temp and just cook at 325 the whole time, as I usually do.

I've made a similar recipe for years and adore it, and this one is great too. I use a different kind of stuffing, and omit the red pepper from the glaze, but I have to say, I will NEVER make a turkey without pomegranate syrup again. It is absolutely amazing - it's both sweet and tangy - and everyone raves year after year. It comes out looking spectacular too. A couple years ago we started brining our turkey and this glaze still works well.

I tried this on a chicken last week and hated it.
