This is a great, fresh tasting spring soup! I've made it a couple of times already, in anticipation of the snow melting and spring coming, and it certainly got my spirits up! Plus, it's super easy to make. Definitely a keeper :)

I suspected that this recipe might lack depth of flavor because it doesn't have much seasoning called for aside from the dill. I was pleasantly surprised! The soup is simple and delicious. I used regular chicken broth and didn't add any salt, I felt that combo gave me just the right amount of saltiness. I also used a bag of baby carrots so I would not have to do any chopping. Easy!

I am perplexed by the rave reviews of this recipe. I am a frequent epicurious recipe user and typically agree with the ratings. This soup is extremely easy to make and tastes good, but not special or unique enough to warrant the reviews. It tastes exactly like it sounds: a soup of carrots, onions and dill seed. The dill pesto adds a lot of flavor, so I cannot imagine serving the soup with out it as others have suggested.

Easy & delicious. Got rave reviews from "foodie" guests and requests for the recipe. Doesn't need the dill pesto however it adds a nice touch.

This soup is amazing. Beautiful to look at (green/orange contrast) and the taste is fantastic. You can see mine here: http://definitelynotmartha.blogspot.com/2007/07/soup-for-sicko.html

Oh my goodness! I can't get enough of this soup. I used (local organic) spring carrots rather than fully grown ones, which I think added a nice sweetness, and took a shorter time to cook.Also, I didn't have dill seed on hand, so I just added a bit of fresh dill instead. Worked out perfectly. The dill pesto is truly divine, but I agree, the soup doesn't really need it (though I'll probably still serve it with the pesto for a nice touch). I had considered adding cream to the soup, so glad I didn't, though some sour cream on the side may be nice. So simple, so so delicious, so recommended.

Excellent! And easy to make. I made the pesto, and it is also excellent, but as a previous reviewer noted, it's totally not necessary to have the pesto. The soup absolutely stands on its own. Before I pureed the soup, I was concerned that it looked like there was too much broth. Wrong - when pureed, it was perfect. I will be making this many times.

I like using a little dill weed to flavor the stock, but the dill pesto really isn't necessary. Today I embellished with a drizzle of cream and some shreds of proscuitto I crisped in a fry pan before adding. Wonderful, and the saltiness balances the natural sweetness of the carrot.

I liked this simple, smooth soup. My fiance found it a little too sweet - the pesto helped, as did a dollop of sour cream on top. Next time, I will try adding some lemon juice or citrus to balance it out. I will also add some other herbs to the pesto, as this was very dill-heavy in taste. The left- over pesto is great for seasoning fish!

Great recipe! The second time I made it I went to the bother of making the pesto. It was good but the soup itself stands alone. Really tastes great! My kids loved it!

Excellent! Went to three stores and couldn't find dill seeds, but it was delicious without. Used a 1 lb. package of carrots and a 4 cup "box" of Swanson's organic chicken broth. Save time, energy and more dishes to wash and just use an immersion/stick blender in the soup pot. Definitely add a dollop of sour cream or plain greek yogurt at service.I will find those dill seeds and try this again. Low fat and delicious.

This was so good I was tempted to lick the inside of the blender the way most people lick a cookie dough bowl! I made extra of the pesto and used it to coat salmon steaks, then broiled the salmon and served it as the main course.

Sooo good on a chilly fall day. The carrot soup was rich and creamy with virtually no fat added. And the flavor of the dill pesto was fantastic. Make sure to salt it well and make it extra pesto. Will definitely make make again.

This was absolutely delicious! Based on some other reviewers' comments I played it safe and doubled the recipe although I was serving it for five as a starter. I'm glad I did, my guests ate all of it! Even having eaten close to double servings each this was still perfect as a relatively light starter. I'll definitely be making this soup again!

Wow! This soup is delightful! After reading rave reviews I decided to triple the recipe. Sure glad I did! I always improvise, using whatever I have on hand: six teaspoons dill weed for seed; 8 cups frozen turkey broth from last week's feast plus 4 cups frozen veg stock for chicken broth; and frozen dill from my neighbor's garden instead of fresh. I also added 1tsp. each cumin and coriander, plus the juice of one lemon. A bit of plain yogurt was added to the pesto, and I garnished with homemade garlic croutons. Thanks to this web site, my search for new and interesting ways to use ingredients on hand is simple and rewarding!

Although I doubled the recipe, we never had enough for a second dinner -- because my husband ate it all for lunch! He is usually the understated type, but he LOVED this soup! The only thing I did different from the recipe was to add a little lemon juice and a splash of orange juice, in an attempt to freshen the flavor and cut the earthy sweetness of the pureed carrots. Worked beautifully. I would have made more of the dill pesto, had I more fresh dill.

I served this soup cold in a shot glass as an appetizer. More was availble in a bowl with a ladle. Extra pesto was served in a smaller bowl along side. Guests were very impressed.

Wow, this goes on my "Hall of Fame" epicurious soup recipes (including the inimitable Winter Squash Soup with Gruyere)--so simple and so delicious! Used the poaching liquid from a chicken salad recipe as the stock. Fabulous as written--probably decadent with cream. I like the pesto, too; I might try it with parmiggiano next time. So good! So easy! Try this soup!

fabulous!!!! quadrupled the recipe for a crowd and ppl still wanted more...

This soup has become a staple item. I add corriander seeds and cumin powder to it. For the pesto, I use peanuts instead of pine nuts because they're more readily available in my pantry. Also make some garlic croutons to add some texture. From one of my New Yorker friends, "This is better than restaurant food." hahah

Has anyone tried this with dill weed instead of dill seeds? Am not familiar with the seeds...

Delicious! The dill pesto turns a good soup into a superb one. I will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe, as did my guests. I improvised a little and added a ball of risotto to everyone's bowl, which made for a heartier but still yummy soup.

yummmmmm - the dill pesto smelled like a lawn when making it but ended up tasting like dill - great idea and scrumptious

The pesto truly is optional -- it's wonderful in its own right, but it distracts you a bit from the taste of the rest of the soup. I made the mistake of adding some lemon, intrigued by a comment made by another reviewer -- the soup had tasted much better without it. Nonetheless, still a great soup.

Excellent. Very simple and delicious. Have made twice and will definitely make it again.

I went to a local restaurant where they had a similar soup. Replicated the recipe and tried to figure out what their secret was. It's lemon. Squeeze half a lemon into the soup, and it makes a great tangy flavor!

I have made this recipe 6 times in the month since I downloaded it. It is a dream to make and delicious to eat. We used the dill pesto once and never again. When you use really fresh carrots and sweet onion like vidalia the flavor is heavenly and just gets muddied by the pesto.

I loved this recipe and would definitely make it again. My husband also liked it although he is somewhat picky. It was reminiscent of a carrot/dill soup I liked at my favorite Polish restaurant.

Excellent! I needed a simple soup for a special party for 20 - scaled the recipe up and within 20 minutes everything was done except the simmering & pureeing. Used a vegetable stock to suit vegetarian guests - also added a swirl of creme fraiche against the carrot & dill.

Ouch! It was so good, it hurt! Instead of butter, I used a prepared blend of 1 part butter to 1/4 part olive oil. This has to be the best soup I've tasted in a long time (both in America and Europe)!
