Amazing! Oy, this is a good reason to have butter in your freezer at all times. (not a euphemism.) Toot a bit of time, but was really great. I made a lot more than 8 scones though...definitely not complaining.

I used tangerine zest instead of lemon, and added diced figs and some cinnamon and they turned out delicious!!! Even my husband who does not care for scones or candied ginger loved them. I had some homemade mango preserves that I put on top, YUM!

I followed the recipe pretty closely as this was the first time I had made these. I was trying to replicate the delicious lemon ginger scones from Ula Cafe in Jamaica Plain. These came pretty close, but I would put even more than the 2 tsp I used of lemon zest in next time (rather than the one called for)and maybe a little lemon juice. I used all cake (pastry) flour and I made a thin glaze from lemon zest, juice and a little powdered sugar to spoon over them when they were done and it really added an extra zing! I would try the suggestions of using less butter and substituting half and half or milk to get the calories down another time, just to see how they come out, but the original is so yummy and tender, I think I might be disappointed!

These are just wonderful, I followed the recipe exactly, I used my Cuisinart to cut in the butter, go slowly until it is a little smaller than a pea. If you want to make ahead because you have limited time, you can mix the dry ingredients, cut in the butter put in plastic gallon bag and then measure the lemon zest place in small baggie then chop the ginger put in a small baggie. Refrigerate them all(I put the two smaller baggies in the gallon bag). The morning you need them simply mix the three ingredients with the heavy cream, follow the rest of the directions. You can make this up to a week ahead and it is still great! Also I make small scones in a wedge size, people are so weight conscious and these are not low calorie.

Delicious and easy. Maybe easy because I'm too lazy to roll out and cut dough. I just pressed it into buttered muffin molds till they were about 1/2 full. I only used one stick of butter, and the scones were still very rich and tender. I added ground cardamom to the dry ingredients, which made these really fabulous when served with clotted cream and a bit of lemon curd.

These are Peets ginger biscuits!!! I remember seeing boxes coming into the store with La Brea stamped on them. Since moving to Pennsylvania I've craved them without end. Now I can make them here! SWEET p.s. I made them with 1/2 whole wheat flour and can't tell a difference.

I loved this. Followed exactly. But would like a more dense scone. This is very delicious-almost like a light cookie. But I like that 'bready' type of scone and not sure how to accomplish that. But it is delicious and I love the ginger.

I made these scones EXACTLY as written. They were so delicious. I had a little bit of a difficult time getting my food processor to properly grind up the butter. I kept having to turn it off, scrape the sides and then restart it. Eventually I got the mixture right. I served these with some clotted cream and honey apple butter. To die for!

Buttery, moist scones! I would recommend rolling them thicker though, since they don't rise much, and baking a little longer to compensate. See photos and my modified recipe here: http://limeandmeadow.blogspot.com/2011/04/ginger-cream-scones.html

This is only my second foray into scones, but I must say this version turned out so much better - however, I think that I way overkneaded the dough the first time around. I used pastry flour, only 1 1/4 sticks of butter which I had frozen, and I didn't have candied ginger so I used candied pineapple pieces and threw in some crushed macadamia nuts. I also sprinkled raw sugar on top (after brushing with cream) before putting them in the oven. I didn't have a cookie cutter so I made a 1" thick circle with the dough and used my pizza slicer to make 8 triangle wedges. They are flaky, moist, buttery, and fabulous! I know I tweaked the recipe a bunch, but I think I kept most of the basics, and will continue to use this as a base, tweaking with ingredients I have on hand, making them savory, etc.

Oh My! Wonderful recipe. Instead of using a round cutter, I patted my dough into a round and sliced into 12 wedges. Used half-n-half in place of heavy cream, and closer to 2 tsp lemon zest. Delicious!

just like the Warren Inn (Paoli, PA) serves! I'm hooked! made 9 3 inch ones and at 400 took more like 20 minutes. (ordinarily my oven seems regular) Did have trouble gathering dough, just kept at it. Used food processor and let it chop the ginger. added it it back in after butter was incorporated. ran it too long as taste was fine but ginger invisible! I would add salt next batch. Plan to freeze some and hold others a few days as a test. What happens if you make them smaller?

This recipe for scones is wonderful, to make them really flakey, I used one cup cake flour toward the total amount of flour 2 1/4 cups of the recipe called for. I also cut down the amount of ginger by 1/2 and add dried cranberries and orange zest in stead of lemon, they are yummy

For a healthier variation, substitute 2/3 cup nonfat milk for 3/4 cup cream; 1/4 cup canola oil for 1/2 stick of butter; 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup white flour. I promise they will still taste delicious and festive. Because you are cutting the fat, you need to spray the pan or bake on a parchment sheet. (I also double the lemon zest for whatever it's worth).

Oh MY! How delicious. Because of all the butter and heavy cream the mouth feel was fantastic..very flaky.Make sure to leave them in the oven long enough so that they do brown..makes a nice presentation. I am on a ginger kick these days and they are a nice addition to my baking repertoire.

Wonderful scones,I will use this as my base when making scones from now on.These scones are the best I have ever tasted.I used only one stick of butter and the zest from one whole lemon.My husband loved them.

DELICIOUS! I was a little concerned that the recipe didn't call for an egg, but the scones are just fine without it. I tweaked the recipe slightly...only used 1/4 cup of sugar, tripled the amount of lemon zest and used salted butter (was out of unsalted). This will be the basis for all my scones now. The taste and texture are perfect! Can't wait to make another batch, maybe savory ones next time (minus the sugar).

hmmm... this was my first time making scones. i haven't eaten loads of scones in my life because i've had a few bad ones (dry and heavy and unpleasantly lumpy), but then i tried the most amazing ginger-currant scones at the academy of sciences' cafe (golden gate park) and HAD to try to replicate them. this recipe made scones that were crisp on the outside and very tender inside, definitely on the light side. i guess i have just three comments: i couldn't taste any lemon at all; the ginger was too sweet and overpowering (and i adore candied ginger!); and the scones didn't really rise (they didn't spread, either)--of course, not having made scones before, i don't know if they're supposed to rise. i used one stick of butter, half-and-half, and a little less sugar, and used a handheld pastry cutter to mix, and shaped the dough into a circle and cut wedges, and baked on a silpat. oh, and because my oven is a nightmare, i baked them at 350 for the first 6 minutes or so by mistake (could that be why they didn't rise)? when i make these again, i'll probably use half the amount of ginger and dice the pieces even smaller (that part was such a pain!), plus some chopped ried tart montmorency cherries, and zest from a whole lemon. dried apricots would be amazing, just with the lemon. so... this recipe is mostly yum, with variations.

I have made these scones twice now, and they are wonderful! Gathering the dough into a ball is a delicate undertaking, but once that is mastered, these are not so difficult to make. Today's version used 1 stick of butter and fat free 1/2 and 1/2, since I had no cream on hand. Very yummy!

I use this as my base recipe for scones (minus the ginger and lemon zest of course.) Favorite version? Fresh rosemary and cheddar. I prefer it without the sugar, but my housemates prefer it with sugar. Either way, weekend mornings, they're running downstairs to grab them. I have done chocolate chunk (no chocolate chips, so just cutting chunks) with the added sugar, which also came out well, too. My British housemate says that it has the appropriate scone texture - so A+ for texture authenticity!

I've made these for Christmas gifts for the past 8 years. I've always just followed the recipe as written with a little extra lemon zest. I'm afraid if I don't make them, I'll hear about it for quite some time. They store really well in the freezer and taste good for several days after baking. They make great teacher's gifts.

I have made these many times (I always use just 8 T. of butter, instead of 12) and they are fabulous. I made a new discovery recently when I had a craving for these. I found some old frozen ones buried in my freezer and reheated them. I was shocked to find that they tasted better than when they are made fresh. I had a professional baker friend for lunch that day who also uses this recipe and she concurred, as she had also previously noticed that they are better the second day after reheating. A nice discovery!!

I made these twice this weekend. The second time I used raisins and a half tsp of Penzey's French Four Spice, giving it a ginger, nutmeg flavor. As before, I cut down on the butter and sprinkled generously with Demerara sugar prior to baking. We think this is even better than the ginger version.

Rating: 4
Yes! This is as simple and as tender as the others said. I'm familiar with LaBrea Bakery's products and had no hesitation to begin with. But as other reviewers noted, I too cut down the butter and they were out of the ballpark. Added a handful of dried cranberries (wow) and sprinkled the tops with Demerara sugar. I blended the dry ingredients the night before and it was a breeze to finish early in the morning.

Wonderful recipe! I made these for brunch this morning -- super easy. I followed the blog advice and reduced butter to 1 stick. I ran out of heavy cream, so I added buttermilk. I didn't have any lemon zest, so I added 1/2 tsp of lemon extract instead. The dough was very dry at first but after 20 seconds of kneading, it came together easily thanks to all the butter. I think this is a great basic scone recipe and the candied ginger could be replaced with dried fruit (like cherries!).

Yum! I decreased the butter to 1 stick (as many reviewers had suggested) and they were still rich tasting. I rolled the dough a little too thin and used a 2-inch cutter instead so they kind of look like fat cookies but who cares they taste amazing. Very gingery but not overly spicy. I used Uncrystallized Candied Ginger "Sweet & Smooth" from Trader Joe's.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. The scones had a tender crumb and were so flavourful. When I initially tasted the crystallized ginger pieces themselves (pre-baking), they had a sharp bite to them, but once baked in with the dough, the taste was toned down and hence married well with the scones. As other reviewers mentioned you don't need 6 oz of butter. 4 oz will do the trick and it will come out just as tender. Also, if you don't want to fuss with a round cutter, pat the dough out into a circle and cut into 8 wedges. By doing this you avoid having to reshape (and possibly overwork) the dough. To revive leftover scones (if by chance there are any left!): brush the bottoms and tops with a little milk or cream and put into a cold oven. Set the oven to heat to 200-210F. Once it reaches that temperature, pull them out (though I check them periodically it reaches this temp. to avoid the possibility of overheating/drying them out)

These were terrific. I made them with only 7 Tbsp butter, as suggested by a previous reviewer and also used half and half instead of the cream and orange zest instead of the lemon since I didn't have any lemons. These were flaky and tasty with great flavor and the delicious chunks of candied ginger.

You know when you want to make something really warm and good that will make everyone smile because its made with butter and flour and how can you go wrong? This is it. SOOOO good. Crispy on the outside, warm buttery but not heavy on the inside. Perfect scones. I used light cream and it was perfect. To get the frozen butter to break, I used the hand-held cutter i use for pie making and then my fingers. Didnt have enough crystallized ginger to say WOW but they were phenomenal.

I made these again (next review is also mine) and asked a professional baker friend what to do about the heaviness/oiliness. She suggested reducing the amount of butter and I did just that. I made these with only 7 T of butter and they were SOOOO much better--really fabulous. They simply don't need all that butter. They were fabulous with 7 tablespoons of butter.

Rating: 4
These are heavenly, and I think they're even better with more crystalized ginger. I used more than the recipe called for (to use up an odd- amount of leftover ginger) and will use even more next time. When you bite into a piece with ginger, it's fabulous. I will make them again, but will warn that they taste and feel very fatty--more than most scones, with all the butter AND the heavy cream. I'm going to experiment to find away around that fatty texture and flavor--any suggestions--maybe buttermilk instead of the heavy cream???

Yummy! I was skeptical about not adding more liquid too but after kneading, it all comes together. I don't have a processor so I just used a pastry cutter to blend the butter etc. So delectable I don't want to share.

Fabulous!!! These will be made again for sure!! The dough does seem like it will be too dry - but resist temptation - you do not need to add more liquid just keep working dough into a ball. I used 5 oz ginger - found at Big Y in CT $2.99 I also sprinkled sugar on top after the cream to give it a little crunch/glaze. Gald to hear you can use fat-free cream, will try next time. And very glad to hear the dough freezes - will do that for sure next time guests come over.

I have made this recipe many, many times - each time to the same response: "these are the best scones I've ever had!" It is absolutely a perfect recipe, exactly as it is written with wonderful flavors from the ginger and lemon. Few tips: Firstly, it is very important that you freeze the butter. Otherwise too much of the butter will blend with the flour before baking and the texture will not come out right. When the butter is frozen, the dry ingredients combined with it should feel dry, and look like pale yellow flour. Use food processor for best results. Secondly, absolutely do not use more liquid than the recipe states. I've even tried it with less cream and had wonderful results. If you add more (as I did once) then the scone mix will spread and not rise. Trust me, it will bind together no matter how dry/crumbly it seems, because of all that butter. The most flexible part of this recipe is with the type of liquid. Usually I use light cream. But I've also tried milk, half and half and heavy - the taste was always about the same. Cream just keeps it slightly moister. I use exactly the amount of butter in the recipe and have never heard anyone say it is too buttery. The texture comes out dry on the outside but soft and a bit cake-like inside. Delicious! I will be making this recipe forever.

delicious! I made them without the lemon zest because I didnt' have any lemons on hand and used evaporated milk instead of cream -- still came out great.

damorgan, scones are kind of like pie dough, which also doesn't need an egg in it for it to rise properly. Scones like this one rely on the butter inside to melt and turn to steam, the large amount of baking powder, and the delicate folding of the dough into layers. Adding Baking soda instead of powder could cause this to spread instead of rise, and not folding/shaping the dough into the proper texture could also make it act more like a cookie.

I love ginger and spicy foods, so when I made this recipe as is the first time, I found it a little bland. The next time I made it, I used light cream, added 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp vanilla, pinch of Cinnamon, 1t of lemon juice instead of the rind, about a cup of the candied ginger and 1/8tsp salt. I did flour the table slightly heavier than usual to accommodate the extra liquid, and the flavour was a lot richer.

Sadly these turned into cookies - spread out and didnt rise - I dont know why there is no egg in the recipe - surely there should be? every recipe I have made (scones) has an egg in it...However I told everyone they were ginger shortbread cookies and they all raved about them!! I do not know what I did wrong - I followed the recipe to the letter!!

Question: The recipe calls for 6 oz, or three sticks, of butter. The sticks of butter I have and that I consider standard size are 4 oz., or 1/2 cup, each. Should I use 1 1/2 sticks? Maybe other reviewers are using way too much butter? Any ideas out there?

Too much butter! I made 2 batches of these scones, with varying ingredients. The first batch was far too greasy (more like a shortbread than a scone), so for the next batch I only used 1 stick of butter and they were much much better. The dough was soft and easy to roll out. I'll keep this altered recipe in my repertoire.

The first time I made the recipe, I accidentally only used 1 stick of butter and added an extra 1 T of cream. The scones were perfect-- moist and delicious. The second time, I added the full 1 1/2 sticks of butter, and I have to say that it was much better with only 1 stick-- plus better for me!!

I didn't have a food processor so I used my hands. That worked just fine and they turned out really good. I am defintely making them again, perhaps adding some orange zests...since ginger is so good with many things, I think you can experiment a little to your taste.

Am I the only one who found that these spread considerably? Maybe that's what some meant by the shortbread reference? That said, I loved the taste and would make them again.

I made 12 scones (as the other recipe does) instead of 8. Anyway, 12 scones or 8 scones, they are absolutely delicious!

These are just delicious. My four housemates, two of whom don't really like ginger, loved these. I used half-n-half for half of the cream to use some up and they turned out fine.

The dough freezes well for quick morning treats. Just pop into the fridge the night before to thaw. I freeze them in individual 4" rounds and cut them into quarters to bake. I also sprinkle a bit of cinnimon sugar on the tops before baking. My kids love them.

Recommendation to make without a food processor - I don't have one and have instead used a hand-held pastry blender. The tool is horseshoe shaped; it has a flat handle on top, and a curved bottom of either thick wires or 4-5 blades. If you do a search on amazon.com, they show many models. I find it works best if the bowl I'm mixing ingredients in is not much bigger than the pastry blender so the mix doesn't spread out a lot. It works for any recipie that you have cut shortening into dry ingredients. Good luck!

I periodically read the reviews from some of my favorite Epicurious recipes and wonder where some folks go wrong. This ginger scone has to be one of the best I have ever eaten. The buttery layers - served warm, please - are meltingly good. I pat the dough into a circle and cut it into 8 wedges. If you want a smaller scone, make two smaller circles and cut each into 6 wedges. This is a good size for tea. For those who think the ginger is overpowering, cut it into really small pieces and you get a pleasing taste of ginger. I like the candied ginger from Williams-Sonoma because it is thick and soft. As for the crumbly texture - it is indeed, but will come together very quickly with a few kneads. Tonight I tried the Joy of Baking recipe that has been mentioned here. It is a decent scone, but not as special as this one.

These were the best scones I have ever made. Delicious. I didn't have any heavy cream but I did have buttermilk so I used that and it worked great. I brushed them with a beaten egg (no cream). I also didn't have the candied ginger but I had some dried cranberries. I soaked them in boiling water for 5 minutes or so to soften and then dried them with a paper towel. Very yummy. This is a great basic scone recipe, you could put whatever you want in them. Nancy Silverman's recipes are always the best.

I served this recipe at a tea I was co-hosting, & everyone seemed happy with them. I myself, found them to have too much of a shortbread flavour... I presume because of the high butter content, & method of mixing. I took another poster's advice & looked into the one on joyofbaking.com, & found it to be perfect! Made the recipe last night, & used them as the base for strawberry shortcakes. Lovely. THIS will be my Lemon Ginger Scone of choice from now on.

I mixed the dough as directed but rather than cutting individual scones, I patted the dough into a thick round on a hot baking stone, cut it in wedges and baked it. It turned out great. Just let the round cool before separating the wedges or you will get a lot of crumbs.

Starbuck's, eat your heart out. Never found a scone yet, in bakery or elsewhere that can compare to these. I don't understand those who find this dry and crumbly - if you follow the recipe exactly, they're not. And for those watching their fat intake, you can substitute half and half or even skim milk for the cream and it makes no difference at all. Believe it or not. Everyone I've ever made these for can't stop talking about them, including my Irish houseguests who swore I got the recipe from their hometown of Kilkenny! If you're a scone lover, it doesn't get better than this.

amazing!! i know it's been said before, but it bears repeating: the dough will seem very dry and flour-y. just form the scones the best you can (I rolled them into small balls) and they will be wonderful and flaky out of the oven. the amount of butter in the recipe will hold everything together. i also added toasted walnuts, a bit more candied ginger, and chunks of white chocolate. unbelievable.

I have made this recipe several times this is what I have discovered: The dough will appear to be very dry, so much so that you won't think it will hold together. It will. Just knead it several times and it starts to come together. Don't add extra cream! It will make the scones spread. I use a small heart-shaped cookie cutter to make them look more attractive and they make great gifts. Also, I bought candied but uncrystallized ginger at Trader Joe's for 99 cents. The crystallized kind cost about $4. I was never aware that there were two kinds.

Way, way too heavy. The reviewer that compares it to shortbread is on the right mark -- too much butter and cream. These are almost greasy.

Rating: 2
I think these scones were alright, but I won't make them again. The base recipe for cream scones was delicious - I expect I will use it again and add some other ingredients. But I didn't care for the chunks of ginger (and neither did my guests). Candied ginger is very expensive, and I just don't think this recipe was worth the price.

Rating: 2
The ginger was very tasty, but we thought the scone itself insipid. I'll add the ginger to other scone recipes with better "crumb". Cooking reduces the bite of the ginger, and adding lemon to the recipe and topping with lemon curd was good advice.

I made these for breakfast and we LOVED them. The only change I made was using a full cup of ginger.

quite yummy and lovely texture - I used a bit less ginger than suggested.

Good recipe though I must say that the better version I have made over and over is from www.joyofbaking.com. The latter uses buttermilk (healthier too) instead of cream and uses more lemon zest and little less butter. I've included this in my christmas basket giveaway and have received great reviews + requests for the recipe.

My friends loved this recipe! I paired with a simple lemon curd and whipped cream for a delicious treat. My only complaint is that it seemed more like shortbread than a scone--but it was no less enjoyable.

These are very fabulous. Easy to make and bake. I made these for a sick friend, and she swears they made her well! I used a tad more lemon, because that's what I like, and they were perfect. Do not skip brushing the cream on top before baking, and freezing the butter is essential to perfect texture.

This is a great scone recipe. I've used this to make other varieties of scones too... Last night I tried blueberry and they turned out great. I doubled the lemon, and added 8oz frozen blueberries. They needed to bake a bit longer, at a lower temp (350) due to added moisture. But they still turned out amazing!

DELICIOUS!! I make them every week & have them for breakfast all week long. My friends & family love them. I use only one stick of butter, Rose's Lime Cordial instead of lemon zest, and milk instead of cream.

Rating: 4
These were excellent, but almost a little too rich, for my taste, to be consumed as a breakfast food. I will however add the ginger and lemon zest to my standard scone recipe which uses 3 cups of flour to 3/4 cup butter and uses a cup of milk instead of cream. But I will be making these again for very special occasions.

Delicious! One of the best scone recipes I've ever made. I also had to add a bit more cream to make the dough stick together. Perhaps as a result, they were very nice and moist. YUM.

Thanks for all other other reviewers' comments and suggestions -- very helpful. As for the scones, made mine with slivered almonds (toasted) and white chocolate. I brought them to work and they were devoured! Wonderful, flaky texture, not dry, and perfectly sweetened. One of the best scone recipes I have come across! Will make again and again!

These were heavenly. I used 1/2 cup whipping cream plus 1/4 cup milk, and only (!) 10 tb of butter and they still came out redolent of creamy, buttery goodness. I will use this recipe as a template for all cream scones to come.

A most delicious, moist scone recipe. Due to what was in my fridge, I made them a second time today with half-half versus the heavy cream. They were just as nummy....now if I might just reduce the butter a bit!

This is an amazing recipe. I used 4 oz. crystallized ginger and 1/2 oz. fresh ginger . Rave reviews - best scones ever.

Rating: 4
These are the best scones ever. I make them so often that I had to find a cheap source (Trader Joe's) for candied ginger. I get about 12 scones from the recipe and have to bake them for 20 minutes. They really benefit from cooling on a rack for 30 minutes otherwise they crumble when you try to eat them. Delicious!

This recipe is great. I made smaller rounds about 2.5 inches. We ate them warm with homemade peach jam. Then later I used the rest as a base and topped it with strawberries and cream to make my own verison of strawberry shortcakes.

When I initially made this recipe, I thought the dough was incredibly dry and added more liquid--disaster! I added too much and the dough became too wet. Anyways, I used an ice cream scoop to scoop out the batter and put them on a baking sheet. They spread a great deal (good thing it was a sheet with a rim). Well, after I took them out of the oven and tasted them, they tasted great! Will try again, but this time I will be very cautious on adding the exact amount of cream.

I made these scones for a baby shower tea. I've gotten an email from just about every guest specifically about these scones. They are so delicious!

Rating: 4
These were delicious. More like shortbread than the more biscuit-y scone recipes out there. I have made these twice, and once had to add more cream, maybe because the butter was really frozen for that batch. I have been asked for the recipe by everyone who ate one. Will keep this in regular rotation.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! Not the usual heavy dry scones. I did have to add more cream (gulp!) as my dough was very dry. No way I was going to get it into a ball. Also had to bake much longer. Could be low humidity & my oven may be off. I also cut them into wedges. Love the ginger lemon combination.

My whole family loved these and the recipe will forever be in my files. I would only change their size and make them smaller, with a 3-inch cutter they ended up too big.

In response to the butter question, it means one and a half sticks (or three fourths of a cup), which weighs 6 ounces.

I adore these. They are my base scone recipe. I make them again and again with modifications. The addition of the cream makes a dough that is less likely to get tough than a recipe with milk. Usually I find these scones are so tender and light that I can't even split them. I modified them today. First, I used aluminum-free baking powder for a pure taste (this is very important in all baked goods, but especially quick breads where the ugly metallic taste can be very strong, especially on the second day. Next, I cut the sugar to 2 T. I substituted cake flour for one cup of the all-purpose flour. I poured in the cream and let the food processor have a few whacks at it before turning it out. The dough felt stiff and heavy, but sure enough the scones were light, amazing, and I could split them! Regarding the margarine question...let's think about this for a moment...why does anyone use margarine for anything? Why does anyone ever buy margarine? Food is about taste. Butter tastes good. Margarine tastes like chemicals. Try it. Taste them side by side. If you have a cholesterol problem, use a lot less butter a lot less frequently, but don't substitute margarine, which tastes terrible and will be a main flavor in the scones. Margarine is not "good for you." The previously liquid fats are hydrogenated, making them "bad for you." Julia Child would agree with me on this. Don't be terrified of eggs, butter and cream. Just limit your use of them to one day a week, and have your cholesterol rechecked. You could try cutting the amount of butter in this recipe, since there is so much. If you are using margarine to keep Kosher, a cream tea party is perfectly dairy kosher: scones, cream, salmon sandwiches, and tea with milk. There is no reason to buy margarine, ever.

We have amde these 6 or 7 times and they are tender and moist and the two of us have trouble NOT finishing them off because they are soooo good. They don't need anything on them, but they go well with lemon curd.

Great scone recipe. My mother has always loved ginger, so I thought I'd give these a try. Thanks for the tip for subbing evaporated milk. Has anyone made these with margarine instead of butter? Trying to keep my New Year's resolution!! Thanks!

I must have done something wrong..the scones were not cooked through after 20 minutes. They had that glued look inside. I cooked them for close to 30 minutes. They were cooked by then, but were dry and didn't taste sweet enough. I had taken a suggestion and used currants and cranberries. Any ideas to help?

Plse clarify this confusion - 1 1/2 sticks of butter? Or 1/2 stick butter? And why 6 oz? Thanks. Sorry...my grey cells caught up with my physical body and I get the 6 oz!!! Thanks. here lies a problem when one gets up with one's grey cells!!!

Not only is this recipe easy, but I agree with other reviewers that these are just about the best scones I've ever eaten....tender, moist, and delicious. Plus, they make the kitchen smell wonderful as they bake. I brought them in to work, and they were a huge hit.

A lover of anything gingery, I've been meaning to make these scones since the recipe first appeared, but don't usually have heavy cream on hand. After the holidays, my cooking muse was still active and so I whipped these up yesterday afternoon and couldn't wait for them to cool and enjoy. Moist, tender, buttery, gingery, easy, comforting - outstanding. I got ten from the recipe, using a 3" cutter; must have rolled the dough out a bit thinner than 3/4". Will use recipe again as written, and will also try with craisins, currants, and other dried fruits.

This was WONDERFUL! Made these scones for Christmas brunch, and they were a great hit. My husband, who usually turns his nose up at ginger, thought they were very good... the rest of us rated them as great!

After reading all the reviews, I was dying to make these scones. The recipe lived up to its great press. As far as buying the candied ginger, the least expensive place is an Asian market. It cost 75 cents for the ginger needed for this recipe.

I got up at 4:30 this morning to make these scones (for the 100th time) for the neighbors Christmas present. They are always a hit with everyone. I always substitute canned low-fat condensed milk for the cream and you cannot tell the difference.

I am not a big scone person, but I thought that these were pretty good. However, my mother thought they were the best that she had ever had! I cut the recipe in half and made smaller scones and it turned out just fine.

IT saddens me that I can not give this scone a five folk star, I read the recipe (and as always all the reviews) then drove to the grocery store at 7:00 PM (in my flannels and polar freece no less) to get the candied ginger. I followed the recipe to the letter and the result is the best tasting scone I have ever tasted. These are sooo good, rich yea but not overly, tender and moist. These will not last more then a few hours...... TRY THESE

Very light; not heavy as heavy as some scones I've made

The scones are absolutely wonderful. I got around their richness by rolling them out to about 3/4 inch thick and cutting them small (approx. 1 1/2 inches in diameter); I served them as "mini-scones" at a brunch for 40 people (I baked them a few days before, froze them, and then defrosted them in order to serve at room temperature). The scones drew raves.

Really delicious and different than more traditional scones. The candied ginger was very subtle.

My scones turned out very bicuit-like and dry. I had watched them in the oven to avoid overbaking. I swear I had not overbaked. The taste was good but texture failed. However I found that after freezing, the scones were much more delicious to eat. Moist and like a soft teacake. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

The ginger aroma was marvelous and the flavor was outstanding. I used a 3-inch cutter...I think next time I'd be inclined to make smaller scones because they are so rich. MMMM, mmmmm good!

Wonderful scones. Since they are so rich, I make them a little smaller and cook for a shorter period of time. I chop the ginger up small and use a little less and it is still a fragrant and nuanced presence! Great (though even richer!) with apricot jam and clotted cream.

Just finished making this. I used 1 stick of butter as I found the printout confusing (perhaps a dash would do) at the 1 1/2 sticks of butter 6 ounces I was thinking tablespoons when measuring as it's listed on the butter. i might try again as they were dry but had good flavor.

These were good but my all time favorite is still the dried apricot and sour cream scones on this site. I might make them again when I want two kinds of scones but they are too rich to make very often.

Excellent scones! Most scones I've tried are either bland, dry, or dense. These scones are delicious!!! I cut mine into 8 wedges and bought the candied ginger at an open market for the price of $5.99 per pound. I'm sure you can find the candied ginger at the bulk food section in most supermarket. Next time I'll make them with dried cherries or dried cranberries or chocolate chips or......

Can you believe the first time I made this I used 1 1/2 cups of butter instead of 1 1/2 sticks of butter?!?! A disaster. Anyway, I made them again a few hours later and I was so glad I did. These are simply the best scones I've ever made or eaten. I made them into 12 wedges rather than 8 circles. Yum!

I've made these exactly according to the recipe, and they ARE spectacular; however, I'd make them smaller as they are so rich! Today I made them with 1 stick of butter and 1/2 stick of margarine and used half and half instead of heavy cream with perfect results. They were part of my contribution to a St. Patrick's Day party and all were eaten. That's my answer to a review.

This is a fabulous scone. I have served these to many and all loved them. Watch them closely in the oven though since there seems to be a fine line between being perfectly done and a bit dry.

These are just amazing! I have probably made every scone recipe on this site. I try a different one just about every weekend. These are by far the best that I have tried. My husband agreed. My two toddlers loved them! The ginger is not overpowering at all, but just a great compliment to the tender scone. Will certainly be doing again!!

I became a kitchen GOD to my friends for making this EASY EASY EASY recipe. Make sure you get the candied ginger at an Asian market: you'll pay a couple bucks for a pound, instead of $8- for an ounce from the spice rack at the grocery store.

I pulse the mixture until it just holds together after adding the cream. Wrap in wax paper (will be crumbly). I refrigerate or freeze the dough overnight or longer. Pat the cold dough into a round about 1 inch tall and cut with small biscuit cutters for mini scones. Excellent!

I have made this recipe several times and they are always great! I do add extra cream so they will hold together more easily. When I make them for the children I omit the ginger and lemon rind and add cinnamon chips - wonderful!!!!

Since ginger isn't the most popular flavour in my household, I substituted cinnamon chips. They were FABULOUS! This is definitely a keeper: The perfect combination of moist yet crumbly and tender; sweet, but not overly so. All around delicious!

Excellent! The amount of ginger was just right! I lightened the recipe the second time around, using milk instead of cream and half the recommended amount of butter, and it came out (almost) exactly the same.

these turned out great. I used about 3oz of ginger because I didn't want them too strong but instead I hardly tasted the ginger. Maybe I cut the pieces too small? Next time I will try it with the full amount.

Duh, when I read 1-1/2 sticks (6 ounces) butter, I heard 6 tablespoons, which of course is half the butter called for. I guess I'm not used to seeing ounces when it comes to butter. The scones came out all right, despite the lower butter content. The dough was definitely on the dry side and needed some persuasion to come together. I cut the dough into more traditional wedges for baking.

Nancy Silverton is an FOM (Friend of Maida), so how could she go wrong? She can't, and she hasn't. These are quite delicious. I just made a batch and am eating one now with my Saturday morning coffee. Yum yum.

Since my husband and I adore Nancy Silverton's desserts, I had to try this. Am I glad I did! The scones were absolutely delicious and buttery (especially when slightly warm). I'm not too fond of ginger and used only 3 ounces (that's all that came in the package), but I must say that the candied ginger was a must. I don't think I'd add more next time, but the combination of the ginger and lemon was divine. I will make these again for sure.
