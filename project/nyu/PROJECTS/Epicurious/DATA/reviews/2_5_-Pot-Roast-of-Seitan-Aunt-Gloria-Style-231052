I'm not sure why this has such poor reviews. It had a tangy, excellent taste. Due to the many "too sweet" reviews, the only substitutions I made were to up the tomato sauce (about 2 cups) and lessen the cranberry sauce (1/2-3/4 can). It would be great made with the ground beef seitan as sloppy joes.

Another thumbs down. This in no way resembles or tastes anything remotely like pot roast. I ended up "recycling" the seitan - I hate wasting food, by rinsing off the seitan and roasting it with a tangy barbeque sauce. I was thinking of getting the cook book this came from but I've changed my mind.

I tried this against my better judgment. A can of Cranberry jelly??? But I was up for a new adventure with seitan: Too sweet. But I bet kids would love this. I even added a 1/2 teaspoon of smoky paprika and a dash red wine to the pur veg stock. No deal. I too have a huge pot of left overs that in no way resembles POT ROAST. I wonder how I can push this more toward BBQ sauce? This should be titled "Sweet and Tangy Seitan". I Think I will stick to treating this soy with a coconut curry. SKIP IT.

I don't know what I was thinking to try this recipe. It is awful. I even used half the cranberry and it's still too sweet. Contrary to what the intro says about it sounding "weird" but you'll be "coming back for more," I wish I didn't have leftovers since it has no redeeming qualities. I think the combination of tomato sauce and cranberry is hopeless--ugh.

If you haven't cooked with seitan before, this is a pretty easy and tasty way to try it. Next time I'll cut up the onions smaller because the first time I sliced them into thin strips, but they got too stingy in the stew pot.

I thought this dish was really simple and really yummy. The horseradish and mustard balanced out the sweetness and everyone asked for seconds.
