As I am a huge fan of scallion and potato pancakes, this receipt was right up my alley. It did take some time to make, but was worth every minute. If I could change one thing, I would just reduce the salt by half, as the bacon I used had plenty. Other than that, delicious! I made it with a maple glazed, oven roasted chicken and it paired very well.
