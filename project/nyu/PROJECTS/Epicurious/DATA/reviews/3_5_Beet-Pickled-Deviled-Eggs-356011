Great recipe, I think it's a big improvement over the traditional deviled eggs. Both in complexity and flavors, it adds a lot to boiled eggs. Plus it does look quite attractive

This is a fabulous recipe and my go to appetizer for every occasion. Like today! Great taste, beautiful color and so easy to make. Everyone who has tried them, even people who say they don't like eggs, give them two thumbs up.

These are fantastic! Not any more difficult than your standard deviled egg; I did the pickling liquid about 3 days in advance, kept it in a big container in the fridge, then put the eggs in for about 4 hours the day of the party (a pink-themed baby shower). They were such a beautiful pink hue! With time, the pink color changes; a thin layer of hot magenta spreads to a more gentle pink throughout the whites (more like the Epicurious photo here). These got rave reviews at the shower and were really delicious! I'll make them again!

In order to like this recipe,you first have to know if you like pickled eggs. If you don't like Pickled eggs, you will not like this recipe. With that said, the recipe tasted very good. I ended up removing the caraway from the recipe only because I'm not a fan of them. It was good. Next time I made them I substituted the grainy mustard for horseradish. I ended up liking that better.

Great color and taste. The stoneground mustard (with horseradish) and the caraway flavors complement the mild beet flavor. I used half a white onion instead and they marinated overnight. The local German restaurant has a sliced red egg with more flavor that I was anticipating.

These went surprisingly quickly as a pre-Thanksgiving appetizer. We let the eggs pickle about 2 days. We had never pickled eggs before and I was worried when I sampled one before deviling and didn't care for it, but the finished deviled eggs were outstanding. We even forgot the caraway in the Thanksgiving rush and didn't miss it, but I will add it next time. Worth the work and the several days of prep for a special occasion.

These eggs are beautiful and tasty. I took them to a party and after everyone marveled at the eggs' appearance, they quickly and mercilessly finished them off.

Really good.

These are my absolute go-to hors d'oeuvre for any occasion. Dinner parties, Christmas, Oscar night, etc.; turn out a batch of these and you will be the belle of the ball. Additionally, the magenta hue from the beets makes for a beautiful presentation. The caraway seeds add the perfect extra little something to the filling.

these were super cute & easy, and a lovely plate on our party snack table. they weren't too pickled (i let the eggs hang out in the beet-y vinegar for almost 24 hours), which i liked. pink eggs!!!!

I grew up in Pennsylvania Dutch country and we had pickled eggs in the frig all the time as did my Amish friends. This recipe makes an easy method of preserving eggs, which is exactly what the pickling of them is supposed to do, and makes it complicated. All you have to do is take a undrained can of sliced beets and dump it all into a large mason jar or other large glass jar. Take the can and fill it with cider vinegar and dump that into the jar with the beets. Stir to mix. My family likes dill so I throw some crushed dill seeds into the mix. Add your peeled, hard-boiled eggs. Add more vinegar if necessary. Stick in the fridge. You really should let it sit it in the fridge for at least 48 hours, but we have been known to sneak an egg much sooner than that! The whites WILL get a bit harder. But they are SUPPOSED to. It's not a bad thing. After they've pickled a bit you can do anything with them you would do with regular hard-boiled eggs. We use them for fun egg sandwiches.

Made them for a baby shower (girl, of course!) and people loved the appearance. Marinated overnight, the whites got a little rubbery, but they turned a lovely pink color. Sadly the flavor was lacking (needed more salt, pepper, and more herbs I think). I won't make them again unless I have to host another baby shower. If I do, I'll just marinate for color and use a different recipe for the yolk filling.

Came out just like the picture! I marinated the eggs for about 2.5 days and doubled the recipe. These were a big hit with a 30+ person holiday party and a topic of conversation...How did you get purple eggs! Really easy to make and worth marinating in advance.

This came out awful! I was too embarassed to bring it thanksgiving! The eggs whites get hard as you marinate them for a long time. What a waste!

I made these for Thanksgviing and they came out so jewel-like and beautiful. I marinated mine for almost three full days and they looked identical to the picture in the magazine and here. I made half to recipe specs and added a bit of horseradish to the other half - both were delicious.

Made this recipe as published with the caper option rather than dill as the garnish and served it as one of two hors d'oeuvres with sparkling wine before a Thanksging dinner party. The depth of flavor, complexity of taste, and visual presentation sure beats the traditional Deviled egg recipes. This recipe is definately a keeper!

This recipe rocks!!! It's surprisingly easy to make and if you really want Wow factor, this is one of the best! This recipe will be one of the top recipes in my potluck repertoire.

Very good and beautiful in color BUT the beet flavor was lacking.

I experimented with using yellow beats to try and get a more fall oriented color. The taste was good. This is the first time I have eaten pickled eggs so I can't say how they compare to others. The eggs came out with a nice mustard kind of yellow color, not bright but earth tone. Good for a fall table. I bought a few beets and used one for the eggs per the recipe. The color did not seem very vivid so I took some of the pickling juice and boiled the peels from two more beats in it for a few minutes then strained that back into the rest of the juice. This brightened up the color quite a bit. I would suggest increasing the number of beets to two to get more color. Also boil the peels separately in some of the liquid and strain this back into the main mixture. I wish we could post pictures so others could see the results.

I made these eggs for a supper club last weekend, and they were terrific! I made them accorrding to the instructions except that I pickled them for 48 hours. The whites got a little bit tougher than I like during the pickling, but the tart pickled taste and spectacular color more than made up for it! I'll definitely make these again.

To the person wanting to use carrot juice...not a good idea. Its the vinegar that preserves the egg. Very important. I guess you could add vinegar to the carrot juice, does not sound like it would be tasty.

I have made beets with almost this exact same recipe, and never had the color really take until about 7-8 hours. They are really quite tasty, and in fact they often don't survive long enough to be deviled. We often eat them for a quick snack or on a salad as mentioned, or with rice, sstir-fried veggies and a little chicken.

I will give this recipe the benefit of the doubt and give it a try with two caveats--First, marinating the eggs for only two hours is definitely not enough time from my past experience pickling eggs. Color is achieved, yes, but full-bodied flavor? I think not. Second, why discard a perfectly good brine? True pickled egg fans would never use once and discard. Certainly it can not be held forever and a day, but use once and throw away? Never! Then, one final point: a good second idea for a Non-beet pickled egg is to use a certain "V" brand of Zesty Dill liquid once the "heavenly" pickles have been consumed. YUMMMMM!!!!!

Are any of fork ratings thus far derived from an actual review of the recipe as written? (I love food dialogue, but it seems to muddy up the rating system. Perhaps a comments tab as well, epicurious?) In any case, did anyone like THIS recipe?

I have been pickling boiled eggs for years by purchasing a good jar of pickled beets and marinating the eggs in the pickling liquid. This would save a step or two in this recipe. And probably be very close to the taste of your recipe.

I alawys kept my pickled eggs in the fridge for a week and never had a problem with them. I use can beets and never onions. They are great slice on a salad too.

Maybe if the reviewer that wants different colored eggs for different seasons used yellow beats they would get the authentic beet flavor with a different color. I think I will try this for Thanksgiving and report back.

Not a very appetizing color....

I tended bar in a few of those neighborhood bars in Pennsylvania and I must say that if you ever put pickled eggs out after only two hours of marinating/pickleing, the customers would throw you out! Also, those same eggs would get put out on the bar (in the jar) in the morning when the bar opened and put back in the cooler at 2:00 a.m., repeat day after day for weeks sometimes! Funny, nobody ever got sick on those pickled eggs.

Great snack for the football games involving the Vikings!! Another cheat is to use the brine from your favorite pickles...add hardboiled eggs, wait a few days. YUM

Have been making very similar recipe for years. A good quick "cheat" is to combine a jar of sliced, pickled beets and the hard-boiled eggs, and let the eggs marinate for at LEAST 8 hours. I think the Pennsylvanians who prepare "red beet eggs" regularly use beets for a reason-- it's about the taste as much as, if not more than, the color. I think trying this recipe with something like carrot juice (or other seasonal variations as suggested by previous reviewer) would be quite unpalatable. I'd be interested to know how it turns out, but I think it might truly be an "egg of a different color!"

Clever idea!I think you could expand on this recipe and use carrot juice for orange Halloween eggs, etc. for many holidays.
