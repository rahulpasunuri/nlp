I have made this so many times... as a quesadilla (grilled or done in a frying pan) and as an enchilada filling. I usually double the recipe and add a can of black beans as well as chicken or shrimp. So easy - a favorite with the kids but tasty enough to satisfy the adults.

This is one of our favorite recipes for a quick weeknight dinner. I make extra and keep in the freezer for nights when I'm not around to make dinner. Mr. Honey loves 'em!

These were certainly easy and tasty. I did think that they were a tad too spicy. I'd cut the adobo by half next time. I also added black beans on advice from other reviewers and paired it with a chicken tortilla soup. Definitely a good addition to the week night dinner file.

These were ridiculously easy to make, and very popular with the family; granted, I excluded the spicy elements. Certainly not the healthiest dish, but definitely an easy crowd-pleaser.

I made this for an outdoor party and it turned out excellent. I assembled the quesadillas ahead of time and grilled them. When we were ready to serve we put them in the oven to heat them up. I made two batches, one spicy and one plain (for the kids). Everyone loved them. Great, easy recipe

The best! I've been making this recipe now for 2 yrs. It's easy to make and you can make a batch or 2 of filling in advance and freeze it. I keep a couple of frozen bags on hand for nights we get home late from work. A good substitute when in season, is homemade creamed sweet corn (frozen). Yum!

Really tasty. Followed the recipe as written but added some grilled steak. My husband loved it! Nice flavour and heat with out too much spice! Served it with fresh guacamole and salsa. Don't forget the ice cold beer!

Really deserves three and a half forks, which sounds strange for a quesadilla recipe but is absolutely true. I was wary about using mayonnaise, but the result was so simple and so flavorful I wouldn't hesitate to use it again. I added a little sour cream to the mixture and used pepper jack cheese. I also mixed in an extra teaspoon or so of the adobo sauce - yum! I added Latin marianated rotisserie chicken from the market to half and left the other half plain for my vegetarian husband - both were surprisingly good. Will become my standard quesadilla recipe.

Good kick from the chipotle! I slightly reduced the amount of corn and cheese and added some cooked chicken. There are several nice layers of flavors here for something so quick.

Excellent! Not too difficult, and very, very good. Even those at the table who didn't like spice ate them (if slowly, and with lots of water). I didn't need to change any of the instructions, and really have no complaint.

Wonderful recipe! I made this for a luncheon, and everyone loved them. Quite easy, too. I served them with some sour cream and pico de gallo.

It's also delicious with black beans and/or saffron rice added! (Quick and easy and good!)

Great to do on the Barbecue. Add chicken for a lunch. Easy to turn but kinda makes a mess of the grill if you are not careful. Will definetly make again.

I've made three double-batches of this mix in the last 6 weeks. It keeps well in the freezer so now we always have some 'dilla filling on-hand for nights when we don't feel like cooking. It's simple to throw together and is super yummy.

Deelish! Quick and easy! I doubled the recipe and it made just enough for 4 servings. I used half sour cream and half mayo and used my griddle pan as I don't have a grill pan. One essential tip: use raw flour tortillas (available at most grocery stores)and grill them before filling. They are soooo much better than regular flour torts. I served with spanish rice. This is going in my "regular" menu.

This was wonderful! The flavors were fantastic together. I served with grilled shrimp but could easily stand alone with the bold flavors. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Great for my vegetarian! daughter.

What a great recipe! I added another tbsp. of mayo though. I served this with mexican rice and roasted aparagus soup. I didnt add exactly 2 tbsp. of chipotle, I just used one whole one and cut it up. Didnt have a grill pan either, so I used my extra long pancake grill. Delicious!

This is a dish hot of the press from Gourmet magazine. It is SO good! I raised an eyebrow at the thought of mixing mayo with these ingredients, but it definately worked. The flavors blend well and it is very good and inexpensive to make. The next time I make it, I will definately increase the cilantro and chipotle.
