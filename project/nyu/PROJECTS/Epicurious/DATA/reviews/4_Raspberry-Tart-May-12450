Wow what a great recipe and so easy! I think it really took me about 20 minutes not counting oven time. I did change it up a little I doubled the jam for glaze and I also melted white chocolate chips with a little corn syrup and then drizzled over the top. I also didn't have a tart pan so used my springform pan. It was a huge hit at the dinner party and would make this again in a heartbeat. Also if you have the Raspberries growing in your yard like I do it ended up only costing about $5 for a 10" tart, what a deal would be at least five times that at a bakery. Oh and it does come out picture perfect with some attention to placement of the Raspberries. .

I loved this tart. I added the grated rind of one lime to the filling (great addition) and used apricot instead of raspberry jam on top. Very well reviewed by adults and most children.

I followed the recipe exactly. The only addition I made was to top the tart with freshly whipped heavy cream. Delicious. I made it for a dinner party and there wasn't one crumb left.

Excellent based recipe. The first time I made this exactly to the recipe and received rave reviews. The second time I used fresh blackberries, raspberries and blueberries which made it more visually appealing and added a little berry liquor to the jam which took the flavor over the edge.

Fantastic!! I used apple jelly for the glaze b/c I had some around and it was fine. I've got a bunch of frozen raspberries from my garden and I can't wait to make this one in January...

Fantastic. Looks beautiful and tastes like summer. Then main modification that I made was to add a little lemon zest to the cream cheese, a subtle change that complements the berries and gives the tart another dimension. I've also used other fruits with the rapberries (blueberries, sliced apricots) and topped them with apricot preserves instead of raspberry, because I like the almost-clear glaze that it gives the fruit. This is an easy and impressive dessert to serve to dinner guests.

A very good and easy recipe with a presentation that impressed my guests. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added a bit of almond extract to the filling but I would NOT do that again. The recipe is good on it's own; it didn't need that extra boost of flavor.

This is a great recipe. I had frozen mixed berries I wanted to use up, so I tried this tart for the first time. Because the frozen berries aren't as pretty as fresh, I put them on the unbaked cream cheese mixture and baked all together (35 min at 375). To the Cook from Horn Lake, I spread melted milk chocolate (4 oz) on the baked crust before adding the cream cheese. It was a little tricky to spread the two layers without them mixing, but the extra flavor and richess were worth it. I will definitely do this again, with fresh uncooked berries.

I have made this countless times and it's always a big hit. So easy and looks like it came right out of a magazine. I use kiwi slices along with the raspberries. When I haven't had raspberries I've used blueberries and kiwi slices with blueberry jam instead of raspberry. Kiwi slices also add great color next to either raspberries or blueberries. I'm going to have to use raspberry liqueur next time as suggested. Sounds great! The crust is just wonderful! And I've added almond extract to the filling every time. It's a must.

The dessert was easy to make and attractive, but I found itlacked flavor, even though I added almond flavoring to the filling along with the vanilla. I had purchased some beautiful end of the season raspberries at the farmer's market, and wished I had used them for something more interesting. My husband thought the tart was good, but I would not bother to make it again.

I also added a little almond extract to the dough and I received rave reviews overall, especially for the crust. I will definitely use the crust receipe repeatedly. My chocoholic friends want me to use a chocolate filling next time. I loved the raspberry. And it is so simple!

DELICIOUS!!! I made this yesterday for dinner guests. One and all absolutely loved it. And it was so easy to make! I did change one thing - I decorated it with kiwi slices as well as raspberries. It looked like it had come out of a magazine. I am delighted.

I found this tart easy to make, beautiful at table, and delicious! Both times I've made it for others they have gotten the recipe and made it themselves with excellent results. My husband likes it because it is not overly sweet.
