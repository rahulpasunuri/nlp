I made this recipe exactly as is, including the cream. The juice concentrate gave the strudel a nice tartness, and the candied ginger whipped cream really complimented it nicely. My husband (who is ambivalent about pastry in general) couldn't stop eating it! The strudel by itself is nice, but the addition of the ginger cream makes it quite good.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I left out the cranberry concentrate and mixed the crumbs together with the fruit and added finely chopped walnuts to the mix. I used comice pears.

I had two thoughts after making this--first I wasn't sure that the cranberry concentrate was needed and second that nuts would have been a nice addition.

Really terrific - and nobody can quite figure out what makes it so special. You do indeed use fresh ginger(grated)in the whipped cream - it wouldn't be so special without it. My minor variation: I brushed each pastry leaf with butter, then sprinkled small amt of sugar over it; I added the remaining sugar and breadcrumb mixture to the fruit mixture. (This made the pastry much crisper - next time, tho, I'll score it before baking, so it's easier to cut)

Can somebody tell me if the ginger whipped cream really is made using fresh ginger root? I just can't imagine it!

Very good. I decreased the butter a bit, and only buttered and put the breadcrumb mixture on every other layer of phyllo. Served this with vanilla/ginger ice cream instead of the whipped cream.

I made this for New Year's Eve with a bit of modification. I couldn't get fresh figs so used dried Calimyrna figs and soaked them in heated cognac & calvados until they were soft. The strudel was delicious and the ginger whipped cream is absolutely perfect as an accompaniment. I will definitely make this again and will probably use the whipped cream with my pumpkin pie next time.
