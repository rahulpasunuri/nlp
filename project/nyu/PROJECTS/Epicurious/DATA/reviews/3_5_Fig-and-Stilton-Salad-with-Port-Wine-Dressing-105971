I do not think you need to exhibit slavish devotion to a recipe, they are guides (unless baking, where they need to be more precise). When you need to make a substitution b/c you think it will improve the recipe or to avoid another trip to the store, try it. If you have success, then share with others. This recipe was SUBLIME. Here were my necessary substitutions: an old, wonderful Madeira for the port, no dry red wine (did not want to open new bottle), used all canola oil as was out of walnut oil, pomegranate molasses instead of light molasses, added the toasted walnuts, and, finally, Maytag blue chees instead of Stilton fresh figs that I roasted first Incredible recipe. Lightly dress the salad. If making again, I will use the walnut oil and make sure I have Stilton instead of Blue cheese. I WILL continue to use my Madeira and pomegranate molasses as they added depth to the recipe.

This is a great salad for special occasions. The warm syrup dressing with figs is a taste of heaven. As someone else suggested, I substituted goat cheese because kids don't care for blue cheese. I also added the walnuts, toasted. Mixed baby greens came from the garden. Wonderful!

Although we made some substitutions on the salad ingredients (subbed fresh mozzarella for the stilton, and added toasted pine nuts) this salad and especially the dressing were fantastic!! Served it to our gourmet club and it won rave reviews!Takes a long time to reduce the port, but it's SO WORTH IT!!!

Very successful and easy to prepare. Made it for Christmas dinner and again for a special dinner with friends - rave reviews. I added toasted walnuts to the salad. Found the dressing to be just right,not too syrupy. Some may find it a bit sweet.

Based on the reviews of it being too sweet, I left out molasses and sugar (and worchester for that matter). I also sauteed some portabello mushrooms and tossed with the dressing/salad before serving. Turned out wonderful.

Simple and quick recipe that produces a very good sald. The only suggestion I have is to toss the greens with the dressing first then sprinkle the chees on top then spoon the figs over that.

Did not like this. The dressing cooked down nice and syrupy, but it totally overwhelmed the cheese. And, the dressing was way to sweet.

I substituted fresh goat cheese crusted with walnuts for the Stilton. It was excellent. The dressing was a little sweeter than I would have liked, but good. I added a little extra balsamic vinegar.

I made this as an accompaniment to our Christmas dinner and we all thought it was terrible. I can't think of anything that I would change to make it a success. The figs in the port wine sauce never got the least bit syrupy. Good thing it was an immediate family dinner with lots of other food.

I served this at a business dinner party and had rave reviews. Three of the wives have already called to ask for the recipe.
