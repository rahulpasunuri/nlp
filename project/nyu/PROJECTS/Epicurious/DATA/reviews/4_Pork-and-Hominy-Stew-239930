I thought this posole was delicious and the process was quite easy, so I will be making it again. In fact, I intend to serve it at a dinner party this weekend. I only gave it 3 spoons because after I combined the soup with the paste and seasoned it with salt, I agreed that the recipe, as it is written, seemed to be lacking something. So, I added a couple of teaspoons of ground cumin and about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of ground coriander and then simmered it for about 15 more minutes. I then let it sit for a day to let the flavors really meld, like any great soup/stew! That seems to have added the depth that I was after. Don't skip the accompaniments either! They balance the richness with fresh, bright flavor.

Splatter when you add the chili paste to the hot oil in the cast iron skillet? Are you kidding me? My kitchen looked like that old postcard of Jackson Pollock's mother, with spaghetti sauce splattered across every inch of her apron. Still, it's definitely worth making for one dinner party. The stew is fabulous.

This was absolutely delicious. Just what we needed for a cold and rainy evening. I made the recipe as written with two exceptions. I browned the meat prior to adding the water. Also, I had about 2c. of leftover chicken stock so I used that and 8c. water. Served with guacamole slices and crumbles of queso fresco on top. It was a bit of prep but not at all difficult. I did take the recommendation of other reviewers and doubled the chile paste so I could freeze half for future use.

Sooo, sooo good! Delicious with the avocado chunks, and squeezes of lime! I agree, once a year recipe as it takes that long for your kitchen to recuperate!

Wow -- this is gorgeous and yummy! I mean, really yummy. My kitchen is a wreck, but I made a double-batch of the chili paste to lessen my work next time.

Once a year recipe, easy and tasty.

Yummy and so cheap to do. This is very easy yet time consuming recipe. I omitted the mint and cilantro as I feel it is a waste and none of my Mexican friends said that it was a step they knew of. However, it's crucial to have that cilantro as an accompaniment. I also skipped cooking the chile sauce in oil - I still had a hearty thick-ish soup. For those not familiar with posole, the extras (cabbage, lime, cilantro, onions)are a must. They add textural contrast as well as freshness. It's like eating the Vietnamese soup, pho...

So-so. Definitely needed lots of lime squeezed in it with lots of cilantro. If you want a better pozole recipe, look for Pork and Hominy Stew from Bon Appetit February 2002. That one is much yummier.

This is amazing delicious comfort food. I am making this posole for the second time today, a rare rainy day in San Diego. The only thing I am changing from the first time I made it is reducing the amount of hominy. I use pork stew meat because it's readily available. My husband and I both enjoy it with sliced radishes, queso blanco, onion, cilantro, and tortillas. The mint is a delicious addition to the broth. In my opinion, well worth the time and effort.

My mom declared this the best pozole she had ever eaten. I liked that it wasn't as difficult to eat as most pozole since the meat was shredded and returned to the pot. Yes, it was time consuming but I love to cook!

Pozole also can be made as green, using green chiles and tomatillos instead of the guajillos. Pozole also tastes good if topped with shredded cabbage and oregano, there's also no need for that much garlic unless you like the garlic taste, recipe also calls for too much hominy and not enough meat. Best meat to use is Pork Shoulder, preferrably boneless for less work and easier, but may lack the bone-in flavor. Also try using chicken, but that really tweeking it.

I used cubed, browned, well-marbled pork roast instead of ribs, and kept the pieces whole (this cut the cooking time in 1/2) Everything else stayed the same. I served this with an orange, endive, sugar-snap pea salad and fresh cornbread. YUM!

I am from NM and have made pozole many times. It is time consuming and laborious but worth every bit of effort for natives of NM. This recipe is outstanding. Adding the cilantro and mint to the broth add depth to the finished product. Note: Making chile paste is messy and time consuming so we always make large batches and freeze the leftovers. The paste can then be used for other New Mexico style foods such as red enchiladas or carne adovada.

I thought this was an excellent dish, though mine was a little more like soup than stew. I'm glad I made it once--however, it was a lot of work, and I'm not sure I'd make it again; I love the complex flavors of various Mexican foods, and this just didn't quite do it for me

I made a much-less labor intensive and quicker version of this last week using a pressure cooker and pork shoulder. Instead of using homemade chili paste I used a chipotle mini-cube by Knorr. I thought my posole was still incredible even with the shortcut and it took less than 30 minutes because of the pressure cooker.

Agree with all reviewers that this recipe was a long effort, but worth it. I used dry pozole which had a delicious taste but which needs to be cooked for several hours before it's softened. Do not skip the add-ins recommended at the end of the recipe -- I did, and was left with that 'missing something' feeling.

Quite a bit of work but well worth the effort. When reheating leftovers, I suggest adding a bit more mint and cilantro. It freshens up the stew nicely.

Delicious. It definitely took me more than an hour of prep time and it was pretty messy, but worth it.

I thought this was Ok. I love pozole and have been looking for a recipe but this one was lacking something. However, my boyfriend lovedit.

This definitely took more than an hour of active time (most of which was probably spent separating the edible from bone, cartilage etc after the meat was cooked). It was also pretty messy. BUT, the flavor was delicious, and pretty much exactly what I was hoping for.

This is quite labor- intensive, but worth the work. My butcher didn't have the ribs, so I used bone-in chops along with a few extra bones. It worked out well. I strained the chile paste after sauteeing it, to get rid of any seeds or tough skin. It was a big hit!
