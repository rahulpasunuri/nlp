I love this recipe. I have made it several times. I understand the comments about the dressing being too oily, but my suggestion is to just use less dressing and lightly coat the romaine lettuce. I can buy a 24oz wheel of queso fresco at Sam's club, so it is easy to cut the wheel in half to make the wedges, or make it all for a large party like I am going to do tonight. Everyone I have served loves this salad.

Dressing didn't offer much. Changed dressing to one that I found in March 1997 Bon Appetit. (Southwestern Casesar salad with Chipotle Dressing)(chipotle Chilies in Adobo sauce. Really dressed the salad well, added tomatoes, corn and toasted pumpkin seeds. I have made this several times, got a lot of ohhs and ahhs.

Made this last night as part of a mexican themed dinner - fantastic! Skipped the fried queso in favor of fresh feta, also added chopped red onions and grape tomatoes as suggested by another reviewer. very very good. As reccommended, used less oil, a little more chopotle sauce, and a teaspoon of sour cream. a couple drops of water helped emusify it. Again, very, very good! Making it again tonight, will add in some grilled chicken to make it an entree. enjoy!

I am the same cook from San Jose who reviewed this recipe previously. Reading all the comments, I realize that I did NOT use extra virgin olive oil as the recipe states. I used regular olive oil. I've also used garlic-infused olive oil. The oil taste wasn't overwhelming for me, maybe this is the difference.

I really love the idea of this salad but, like several other reviewers, found the oil to be overwhelming. On a whim, I used the same amount of sour cream as a base, and then added the rest of the ingredients as per the recipe. The only addition was a squeeze of lime juice. Let me tell you, my boyfriend practically licked his salad plate clean, and he insisted this salad be added to the permanent collection. The sour-cream base might not appeal to everyone, but it's miles ahead of the olive oil.

The idea here is so good, but it just doesn't work. The dressing is way too oily. Even after doctoring it up with more chipotle sauce, then some vinegar, then more sauce....I just couldn't get rid of the predominant oil taste.

This dressing definitely needs something -- lime juice, vinegar -- something. But I really like the idea and the cheese (which I've never had before) was wonderful. I used panko to bread the cheese which turned out very well. I'm going to keep experiementing with this because it is a nice accompaniment to a Rick Bayless-inspired dish I make a lot for guests.

Got to tell you, cut the oil with apple cider vinegar as suggested by another reviewer. Did not like it. Threw it out and started over. The original recipe works. Tabasco makes a Chipotle Pepper Sauce. Look near the tabasco, its in a box and its cheap - $2.99 for a huge bottle.

I haven't been able to find chipotle sauce--I used Crystal Extra Hot Sauce and felt like the dressing needed more flavor and was too much oil, but I loved the whole concept and will keep looking for the right kind of sauce. I used plain bread crumbs spiked with basil and oregano. A very gourmet-looking salad--would be a great light lunch or first course for more formal dinner.

I have made this salad twice now and will definitely make it again. The first time I made it I added red onion and grape tomatoes for some color. It was great! The next time a added a little apple cider vinegar to cut the oil some and it was even better. One suggestion; toss at the very last moment. Next time I will try the bread crumbs instead of the corn flakes.

I didn't rate because I changed the recipe a bit. Made the dressing just as written and it was wonderful but I just topped with crumbled Queso Fresco instead of frying. Next time I will do it as written. Can't find Queso Fresco? Try Feta, It's kind of similar.
