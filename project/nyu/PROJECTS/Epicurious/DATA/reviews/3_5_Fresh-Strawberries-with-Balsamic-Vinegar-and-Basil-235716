i also halved the balsamic and substituted shiso leaf for basil - delicious over vanilla ice cream!

We had the recipe as listed, except less sugar. It was fantastic with a bit of vanilla ice cream. I would bet that Greek Yogurt would be good, too.

I was lucky enough to remember to read the reviews first (I don't always, and sometimes regret it), so I halved the balsamic and let the strawberries sit in the sugar for 20 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. It was delicious.

I like balsamic and strawberries...mmmm, but I would definitely back off on the balsamic in this recipe. It's too much...only need half of what is called for. And back off on the basil as well. I find the whole dish to taste better if the berries are macerated in sugar first for about 1 hour, then add rest of ingredients (half the vinegar and a bit less basil) following the prepartation instructions. Top off each serving with a bit of LIME ZEST! That will make your tastebuds happy.

I usually like strawberries with balsamic vinegar, but this recipe had too much vinegar. Between the vinegar, the basil and the pepper, I could barely taste the strawberries at all. I much prefer the balsamic strawberries with mascarpone from this site at http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/105321
