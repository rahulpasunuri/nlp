I made this on a week night, excited that the recipe didn't require the laborious addition of he broth by 1/2 cups as many risotto recipes do. It was delicious, and came together quickly. My husband loved it, and my 4 1/2 year old helped clean the squid, but stuck to noodles for his dinner. It was an amazing Tuesday dinner and it would also be great for a weekend dinner party, with the recipe doubled and served on a platter to display all the beautiful shellfish.
