Ohhh, these are so good. Added butterscotch bits and chopped the pecans really coarse. This could be a signature cookie...it's that good! So, off to nibble on just.one.more!!!!!

Ha! I see almost everyone commenting recently has already added the chocolate chips!

Looking at the recipes online that are for Ranger Cookies, I find them all odd to our own family recipe. Perhaps those of you who are a little disappointed with what you have found so far will ditch the cereal (corn flakes or rice krispy type cereals)altogether. Our family recipe uses only shortening (no butter) and opts for 2 cups of coconut and 2 cups of quick cooking oats... those of us with a real sweet tooth throw in some chocolate chips! Nuts, as always, are optional... but pecans are the best! I will try the epicurious recipe next...

One of my local lunch places offers Ranger Cookies and I simply love them, so I was excited to find this recipe, but somewhat disappointed in the results. These were okay. Not bad, but not as good as I had hoped. My only deviation from the recipe was to add 12oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I was careful not to overcook them, but they came out somewhat dry and rather bland. I guess we are still on hunt for a better "Ranger".

A very big hit! Made a ton of cookies - i made half then froze the rest of the dough and made it a few days later. Worked great both ways. Only modification was to add about 6 oz milk chocolate chips, but would be great without chips, or with peanut butter or butterscotch chips instead. Will definitely make again!

Yum. Used white choc chips and butterscotch, and the whole experience was delightful. Maybe a little too much - I ate waaaaay more than I should have.

Made this following the recipe exactly. Too dry, not much flavor. Was disappointed.

These cookies are addicting, even for me as a chocolate lover! I used walnuts instead of pecans, what I had on hand. My husband and his friends go crazy for these. I'll definitely make them again, perhaps with chocolate or butterscotch chips. I used a tbsp. cookie scoop for slightly larger cookies, and flattened as in the recipe, for a softer cookie with a slightly crisp bottom.

Like the cook from Iowa, I too grew up on these cookies, and we also used rice crispies. But we always used raisins instead of pecans or chocolate chips, so it was sort of a twist on an oatmeal raisin cookie. The rice crispies make it a touch lighter tasting, and the coconut keeps them moist. To the cook who flattened them to make them crispy, these aren't far off from Oatmeal Lace Cookies, if you thinned them out and flattened them (definitly different, but similar)

These cookies turned out perfect! Just be careful not to overbake, it's easy to do it. I used Wheaties instead of cornflakes and they still turned out yummy!

These cookies are great. My 4 year old and 17 year old both loved these. I like using whole-wheat Total as an earlier reviewer said. I squished the cookies flat before cooking and not the flattened ball as the recipe suggest. These cookies do not spread much when cooking. I found that if they were squished flat they turned out crispy. Yum. Next time I may add chocolate or butterscotch chips.

Loved this cookie! So hearty, I made it to send to the Soldier's over in Iraq for Christmas. And so simple to make, too.

This is a great and easy to make cookie recipe. Can't wait to make them again! I added chocolate chips, but would have been good without them. Best Ranger Cookie recipe I've found.

I thought this recipe was great! I made some for New Year's and everyone inhaled them!!

I thought they tasted really good. I love the crunch from the corn flakes (I used whole-grain Total because we were out of corn flakes, but it can't be too different). I used chocolate chips in place of nuts in hopes that my 2- and 4- year olds would eat them. They were onto the oats and coconut immediately, so I had to send them off to the office with hubby for fear I'd eat the whole batch alone! When the kids are older, I'll come back to this tasty cookie!

This recipe is nearly identical to one I've known all my life as "PRIDE OF IOWA" cookies. It was our family's number one comfort food; any one of us five girls could make a batch without even looking at the recipe, so I've had these cookies hundreds of times. The only difference: we use Rice Krispies (not corn flakes) and chocolate chips (not pecans). Try it, you'll love it!! Seeing this brings back many warm memories!! I think I'll go make some right now........
