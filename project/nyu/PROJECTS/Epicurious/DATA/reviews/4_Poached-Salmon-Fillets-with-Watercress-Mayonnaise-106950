I only use cooper river salmon. This recipe was worth my cooper river salmon. Typically I just whip something up, but the cooper river doesn't run by my house, so I have to be sure to use the best. I would say this is about #3 best

this is the first time i've been let down by a recipe that got universally glowing reviews on this site. i just didn't like it at all. i followed the recipe exactly -- only slight modifications were that i used very low-fat mayo and a bit of extra lemon juice as others have suggested. i also ate the salmon warm instead of cold.. but i didn't get the feeling it would have been any better cold. my husband and i ended up scraping off the mayo and using tzatziki i had in the fridge instead. i wouldn't make this again.

I agree with others that you need to add liquid to cover, plus I use the smallest skillet that will accomodate my fillets. For another good poaching method, see "Poached Salmon with Green Peppercorn, Ginger and Orange Sauce," especially useful if you're doing a lot of fillets. Aside from that caveat, I love this recipe! Great to make ahead for company, and easily portable.

Bought four large fillets, doubled the liquid ingredients (actually, I did not measure the wine, I kept pouring until it looked like enough!). The fillets took longer to cook than the recipe indicated - about 15 minutes, and I cooked them in two batches - really thick fillets! The fish and accompanying mayonnaise were delicious.

Great. Good starting point for using different flavourings in the liquid such as lemon-flavoured herbs. Can also be nice drizzled with fresh herbs and a touch of fruity olive oil. I think submerging the filets washes away some of the delicious flavour and oils that makes salmon unique. Like all classic recipes, just follow the method and you can't go wrong.

This is an absolutely wonderful dish. Easy and great taste. My husband and I enjoyed it along with Green Bean, Potatoe and Leek Salad, Bon Appetit, October 1992. We recently moved to Osoyoos, BC from Calgary and needless to say my recipe index did not include nearly enough cool dishes to enjoy our wonderful hot summer. This one certainly will be added to my regulars.

This recipe is extremely easy and delicious. The salmon just melts in your mouth. I found the mayonaise a little too sweet and perhaps would add a little more lemon next time. Will definately make the salmon again and again!

This dish was INCREDIBLY EASY to prepare and the final product really was elegant and delicious! The poached fish is also a healthier alternative to sauteed or roasted salmon where you'd be using additional oil. I served it with green bean and potato salad as the picture suggests - delicious!

Hard to believe this luscious dish is so easy to prepare. I love the fact that I could serve it just as easily for 2 or for 20. A wonderful cold dish to serve on the patio or at a buffet.

I would add a little more poaching liquid, but they did steam perfectly! I used larger fillets so I gave it about 12 minutes to poach. I also added a little lemon juice to the liquid. Thw watercress mayo was good, but I would a little lemon juice to it. It was a big hit with my guests and I served it with the red potato and green beens sald with dijon vinaigrette, which carried the Dijon flavor through the dinner theme.

Absolutely wonderful, simple elegance. I heeded the cook from Hawaii's advice and doubled the poaching liquid (mostly added some more water) - I didn't want to steam my wild salmon ($20/pound!) but to submerge/poach it! I did not have parsley so used additional thyme, substituted half an onion (not sliced) for shallot, and added 2 lemon quarters to the poaching liquid. For the excellent sauce, I added additional lemon juice. I was in a hurry and didn't have greens - just a midweek meal, so we only had boiled potatoes and corn - next time, I will have the asparagus or green beans as others have suggested. Also served this warm. Would be perfect for luncheon guests!

I had never poached salmon before, so I followed the directions exactly even though it seemed like there wasn't enough poaching liquid for the amount of fish. The filets were cooked perfectly-- but only on their bottom halves! I had to flip them and cook them some more. This is a tasty summer recipe that I'll use again, but next time I will at least double the amount of poaching liquid and make sure that the fillets are fully submerged.

This is perfect lite summer fare. Have had the dish warm or cold and both are perfect. I have all so made this recipe with the lemon mayonise (another poached salmon recipe on this site) and been equally as pleased. Don't miss out on this recipe! Perfect do ahead for any occasion.

De-lish! This was a lovely, easy recipe. We ate our fish warm (perfect!), and the wine & shallots give it a wonderful mild flavor, as does the sauce. The fish was moist & delicious and our guests loved it. We served it with garlic rosemary potatoes & french green beans. Perfecto.

This is as perfect as recipes get. Easy, quick and elegant, perhaps especially great for those who, like me, feel they should eat more salmon but aren't crazy about it. I tried it on the family and, when it got raves, served it for company -- raves again. We served it with new potatoes and fresh asparagus -- the asparagus seems a good complement to the watercress mayonnaise. This definitely will be a frequent repeat with us, both for the family and company.

Very delicious dish, warm or cold. The mayonnaise tastes great! So easy and elegant, I will be doing this again and again (did it 2 times so far). I thought that the suggested potato salad didn't perfectly match with it (though it is good), so I served simple green beans the following time. By the way, I did the watercress and watermelon salad on that site with the watercress I had left: very good too!
