Fabulous! I was worried when my butter started to brown and reluctant to use the parsley because I hate it, but neither concern was justified. My only problem was that there wasn't enough! Next time, I'll definitely double this recipe.

Really bland. Nothing special. Huge fan of sesame, but this didn't do the trick.

Pretty good, really easy. It was a good accompaniement to Salmon with sesame and Orange relish.

Very nice and easy. Went well w/chicken and kumquats. I think it would go nicely with Asian dishes.

Delicious - kids loved it. Sesame seeds adds a distinctive flavour to white basmati rice.

It's really a nice change. Something unexpected, but not overpowering. Doesn't take but a minute to toast up those seeds and throw them in. I agree about the nutty flavour...took me 15 minutes to calm down my husband (nut allergy) and convince him it was just sesame!

A very easy and tasty recipe. To the cook from Denver. If you thought this tasted stale, maybe it did. Sesame seeds go rancid rather easily once the bottle is opened. You probably used old ones. Try it again with a newly opened bottle of seeds.

Yikes, this was awful! The sesame seeds made the rice taste stale and smell awful. I did use regular white rice, but I don't think jasmine or texmati rice could overcome that cardboard smell or bland taste.

This is an excellent rice recipe. The sesame adds something unexpected, I agree, almost nutty. I plan on making it often.

Terrific! This is one of the better recipes I have found for rice. Nice nutty flavor. We loved it!
