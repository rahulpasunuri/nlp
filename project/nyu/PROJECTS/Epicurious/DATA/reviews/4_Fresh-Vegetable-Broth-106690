Subbed purple potatoes for red and doubled the peppercorns. The broth comes out very clove, parsley, and onion intense. A bit overpowering on its own, but excellent in soups-- I used it for "A Nice Vegetable Soup," also on Epicurious. I split the remaining vegetables: half pureed, half whole. I ate the whole ones, with a pinch of salt, as sides to further dishes, which I might describe as "enjoyably plain" in a wholesome sort of way. I used the puree to thicken the broth when I was taste-testing it, but now I am at a loss about what to do with it and fear it will get wasted. Next time, I will keep all vegetables whole.

An excellent recipe where you can add other vegetables from your current stock. The inclusion of mushrooms, potatoes and tomatoes gives this a different slant. Can you whatever fresh herb availalbe. And, of course, if you are not a vegetarian or vegan you can subsitute chicken stock for any soup recipe. A small % of the cooking public would find this "strange". This stock works for "all" cooks.

Excellent recipe. I did not use the cloves or the dill, not because I don't like them, it was a finacial decision. It was delicious without and probably even better with the cloves and dill. This recipe is a keeper.

Thank you for posting recipe. Many many recipes call for veg. broth but not how to make it. Most say to used canned chicken broth or veg. broth. Seatched many data base recipes to no avail.

Tried to make a different vegetable stock and it was awful. This one has a good flavor and color to it.

Canned chicken broth substituted for homemade veg broth? Are you kidding? You're kidding, right? There's NO comparison. And no choice either, for those of us who do not eat meat or meat byproducts. I've made my own broth for years, and never, ever, been tempted to substitute canned chicken broth.

This broth had wonderful flavor. It has a brown color which wasn't as nice for matzo ball soup but it made a fabulous broth.
