These were absolutely delicious. The flavors meshed so well! Only complaint is that they were a tad dry.

the frosting was very runny however the cupcakes were ok. not spetacular, but simple cranberry cupcakes if you're in need of some. i whipped up a cranberry cream cheese frosting and it worked perfectly. its also a pretty light pink color.

The combination of flavors sounded intriguing, but ultimately they don't really go well together. Couldn't really taste the cranberry, which is odd because cranberries usually have a strong taste. Perhaps the sweetness of the dulce de leche overpowered it. With the dried fruit and nuts, these tasted more like very sweet muffins instead of little cakes. If I make these again, it could only be as a brunchtime treat for trail-mix-loving, outdoorsy folks during the christmas season. Not too likely.

What a disappointment! The cupcakes were dry and tiny with very little cranberry flavor. The frosting was way too runny and didn't taste like either cream cheese or dulce de leche.

I didn't have cranberries, so used dried sour cherries and used Trader Joes candied pecans (which I highly recommend). Otherwise followed exact recipe. I used Nestle's can of dulce de leche. The combination of fruit and caramel and nuts was scrumptious! My 14 year old son/critic gave them the thumbs up!

The dulce de leche icing with pecans was easy to make and tasty, but the flavor of the icing did not enhance or go with the cranberry cupcake. A very strange flavor pairing.

I made these, and simply purchased dulce de leche from the ice cream toppings section to make the frosting. They were a hit with everyone and very easy to make. Wouldn't change a thing.

I did not make the cupcakes, but I did make the frosting. I used it to top the mini chocolate cupcakes from this site. I made my own dulce ce leche. I thought that the icing was a bit runny, though it might have been because my dulce de leche was runnier than others. It still tasted good, though very sweet. The icing looked quite pretty.
