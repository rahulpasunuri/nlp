I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday and it was a total hit! The flavors with the fresh dill and caraway seeds are amazing. I also loved the use of rye bread in this recipe. I couldn't find pumpernickel though, so I used a loaf of sourdough, which was obviously delicious. One thing I did notice with this recipe was that once I had diced each of my 1-lb loaves of bread, they yielded closer to 10 cups cubed EACH, not the said "6 cups each" in the recipe. I also had to up the amount of broth to about 4 1/2-5 cups. The stuffing was perfectly moist this way. I will definitely be making this again! We loved it.
