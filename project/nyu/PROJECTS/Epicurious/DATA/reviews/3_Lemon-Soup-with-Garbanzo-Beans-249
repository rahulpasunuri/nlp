It was OK. Easy and quick.

I was blown away by the flavor (and low calories) in this soup. I'd give it four forks if there were no garbanzo beans (I normally like, but they were just weird here -- broth and beans with no other texture). Didn't have turmeric and didn't miss it. Plan on making again today for lunch without beans.

Reversed spices: check. Used homemade chick stock: check. Added shredded chicken leg (mmm, dark meat) and about 3/4 C barley to make it a "real" meal: check. Ding, ding: we have a winner. Very healthy. Surprisingly good. Great for people with ulcers n such that need to watch their ingredient intake. Def recommend the homemade stock, which is so easy and rich and probably makes it.

This soup was really good. I followed the suggestions about switching the tumeric and cumin seeds and also added chicken breasts. However, the next time I make it I'll use 3 eggs which will make it richer. My husband loved it; I told him it was egg drop soup.

I modified this recipe by switching the amounts for the turmeric and cumin seeds, and I used a 1/4 teaspoon of white pepper instead of a pinch of cayenne. With those changes, this soup was amazing! I definitely recommend it.

My family and I LOVED this recipe!! As others suggested I did switch the amounts for the cumin and the tumeric. Another suggestion of adding chicken breast was great. I just threw a few in the broth when it was cooking, then before serving I took the breasts out and kind of chopped/shreaded them before adding back to the soup. This soup has sooo much tasty broth I felt it just needed a bit more 'bulk', I guess you could say...the chicken was perfect for this. I also happened to have some leftover rice on hand and if you want to give it a try, the rice was also a great addition! I'm sure I will serve this with rice every time I make it.....which will be often!!!! (I don't usually repeat recipes often, but this one I've made twice this week!!)

I really enjoyed this soup! Very easy, very fast and very good. I'll definitely make it again, and if I ever forget about this soup - I now have a tumeric yellow soup ladel to remind me of it.

A delicious and easy dish that can be served hot in winter or chilled in summer. Do use fresh mint! I added 2 whole, skinless, boneless chicken breasts and it made a whole meal for 4. The rich yellow color of the turmeric gives delightful eye appeal.

I almost didn't make this because of all the negative reviews. But I couldn't believe that this combination of ingredients wouldn't be yummy. So I tried it - I'm SO glad I did! My husband and I both loved it, we agreed we will have it again for a first course soup. The only thing I changed was I had to use chicken bouillon/water for half of the broth since I only had one cup of canned broth. I also took the time to "peel" the garbanzos because I have issues with the waxy outside of them. Well worth it! Deliciously light and tasty. Oh, and also I forgot to mention - I reversed the amounts of cumin vs. turmeric upon the others' advice - definitely a typo I'm sure that what makes all the difference.

The amount of turmeric is too high. I agree with the previous comment. In most Indian cooking about 1/4 teaspoon or less turmeric is more than enough. This recipe calls for 1 1/2 teaspoons of turmeric??

I made this very simple soup for a dinner party and it was a big hit! Very tasty with the fresh mint. I have made it several times since, always with great reviews.

A waste of time and ingrediants. I made this as a starter and it was so disappointing that I decided not to serve it to my guests. There are so many other GREAT soups out there, and this isn't one of them.

this recipe looks great on paper but was very disappointing. if you choose to try this recipe, it might be better if you decrease the turmeric and increase the lemon. i found the flavor overwhelmed by the turmeric.
