This was delicious! I followed the advice of a few reviewers: I roasted the vegetables in the oven, and added a little white wine and broth at the end to make a little more "sauce". I also substituted a leek for the onion, because I had one that I needed to use. The essence is the same, though--fresh, soft, savory vegetables, mixed with goat cheese and pasta. Definitely worth trying again.

This recipe is a bit misleading in that the veggies do not actually make a sauce per se. We made this pasta on a weeknight and it lasted for two days. Would probably pre-chop the veggies next time. We skipped the parsley and used thyme from the garden; I would suggest adding more for flavor. Don't skip the goat cheese! Tastes good warmed up later and even cold.

This was a little bland - we added lots of fresh ground pepper and salt. I also added mushrooms. Next time I make this I will probably add a little tomato based pasta sauce or a vegetable broth. This made a TON of food.

I absolutely love this as my 'veggie' dish when I make it exactly as shown. I personally don't like goat cheese, though, and choose to leave it out.

I roasted the vegetables in the oven instead of sauteeing them in the pan. Then I threw them in to a pot with jarred pasta sauce. I added a 1/2 c. of red wine and pureed the whole thing. Tasted great. The kids weren't even aware that they were eating all these vegetables!

Very good but needs much more flavor-- add extra garlic and salt and pepper!

I've made this numerous times and find it to be easy and delicious. Since I don't care about the presentation when I serve this, I don't bother making the logs- I just sprinkle the goat cheese and add the herbs.

I added some chopped mushrooms (because I had them) and let the vegetables simmer at the end with a half cup white wine and a half cup chicken stock, to give it a bit of sauce. Easy and tasty. Probably would give it 2.5 forks if I could.

The goat cheese was a great touch, but still left this dish too dry. I wouldn't make it again without making a sauce to go with it.

This meal is a wonderful, easy summer meal. It is so flavorful, I plan to add it to my rotation. I was worried about the eggplant tasting bitter since the recipe didn't call for salting it but it was great!

This was absolutely delicious and looked beautiful on the plate. The goat cheese rolled in thyme makes the dish. Do not skip this important ingredient. I did add a litte white wine to the sauce, but that was my only deviation from the recipe.

Let's call this dish what it truly is-- ratatouille! The use of cherry tomatoes wasn't necessary. Regular tomatoes would work just as well. I sprinkled the goat cheese over, and then the chopped parsley.

This was a wonderful recipe full of robust flavours! I made it as written but next go round will omit the eggplant (which didn't seem to add much) and add artichoke hearts or asparagus. Don't skimp on the goat cheese it made it sensational! I also added some vegetable stock near the end with some Chardonnay as noted by in other comments.

Easy and very good. I think I'll play around with additional ingredients next time, but this is a wonderful dish as written.

I really loved the flavors in this recipe, but I used angelhair pasta instead of shells (personal preference). Most recipes never call for enough garlic so I usually double it or more - same goes for this recipe. Also, I added about 1/2 to 1 cup of white wine little by little during the last 15 minutes. It helped to keep the sauce moist, and gave it a nice little extra punch. Definitely don't skimp on the cheese, and don't mix it in - it's wonderful on top, and allows you to savor all the flavors of this dish one-by-one!

This is a great summer pasta dish. Just be sure to season it enough or it will be sort of bland. The combo of fresh veggies and pasta with the tangy goat cheese really make this dish (so don't skimp on the cheese!)
