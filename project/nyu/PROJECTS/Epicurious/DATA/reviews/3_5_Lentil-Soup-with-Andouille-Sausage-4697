Upped spice to two tbsp. really good, hearty soup with flavor and health.

Made this for a fall picnic. Flavors were good, but Creole seasoning made it a bit too salty. Plus, I'm just not a big fan of lentils in soup, no matter how hard I try. Date seemed to enjoy it, though.

Delicious....second time around but used red lentil.... creamier and thicker consistency than the regular lentil. Definitely double the veggies & sausage again. No need to add salt or pepper because of the creole seasoning. I will make this again & again! Love it!

Definitely super easy and delicious! I sauteed all the ingredients plus lentils in a large pot after browning the fennel seeds. I read the reviews and increased the vegetables and andouille sausage. Served it with baguettes.

This is a super easy, simple and delicious meal. We used chicken andouille sausage to make things a bit healthier and it turned out great. In the future, we would recommend doubling the celery, carrots, onion and Creole seasoning. The cooking time for the mixture seems like it could be at least 15 minutes less unless you'd like the lentils to be completely disintegrated.

This was YUM! I did it the lazy way and pretty much threw everythign in the pot at once and cooked it all together for a half hour. Added extra carrot, onion, and celery times 5 and threw in chopped snow peas at the end for some green. Also used bouillon instead of broth. Easy weeknight soup!

This is wonderful, and your recommendations (spinach, rice, additional sausage, etc.) really made it that way. Oh, and I checked my cajun seasoning; as a commenter noted, the first ingredient was SALT. Instead, I added my own salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne and smoked paprika. Thanks!

This soup was perfect on a rainy afternoon. I served it with bread slices topped with melted smoked gouda. Maybe next time I will use less fennel. I followed the advice of others and increased the amount of vegetables.

I was looking for a lentil soup recipe that I could make "cajun" and use up some okra - this one with andouille sausage seemed to fit the bill. It's basically a veg lentil soup with sausage and creole seasoning. I don't think the fennel seeds added anything to it. It came out pretty good, but in the future I'll just make my regular lentil soup and add the sausage and okra. I also did not precook the lentils. I did brown the sausage first and sauteed the veg in the rendered fat. Then I added the sausage at the end because I don't like the texture of sausage that's been cooked for an hour.

Delicious soup for healthy weeknight meal. Made this 3 times in the past 2 months. Spinach or kale is great addition.

I used red lentils, and followed the suggestion of the previous reviewer to use the creole seasoning recipe from Chuck Taggert's website. This soup was delicious, and so enhanced by the taste of thyme. I also used a low-fat chicken andouille sauasage from Costco. I doubled the recipe and shared it with Korean, Chinese and American neighbors, with rave reviews from all!

This soup is fabulous! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and increased the amount of vegetables to 1/2 c. each, doubled the amount of sausage and added a 1/2 c. of wild rice and extra liquid. I also avoided the saltiness problem that some reviewers experienced by using a home-made batch of creole spice, using a recipe from Chuck Taggert's website, www.gumbopages.com. Taggert's recipe uses no salt, but has plenty of flavor.

Made as written and it was perfect for a cold winter's day. I made up my own creole seasoning but it was still fine.

Tripled the vegetables and doubled the amount of andouille, otherwise followed the recipe. Had a number of friends over and all wanted the recipe. My wife and I loved it. Might be best made with low-salt broth, especially if you use more of the andouille than the recipe calls for. The quality of the andouille makes all the difference. I recommend Savoie's.

This soup was serviceable. I made it exactly as written, and it was good but did not impress. Mine had a very strong black pepper flavor to it.

Great recipe when some changes were made! I took others' recommendations and added cooked long-grain rice, fresh spinach, and doubled the amount of sausage. Because of all these additions, I ended up having to add about 1 more cup of broth and an additional 1/2 cup of lentils. I also doubled the amounts of onion, celery, and carrots. Easy and great-tasting! I would definitely make this again.

What a great soup! I found the first step unnesessary as the last step of cooking 45 minutes is ample. I used 3 each 141/2 oz. cans of low salt, no fat chicken and beef broth. This will solve the salt problem A few extra lentils won't hurt. I also doubled the veggies and sausage. Instead of Creole seasoning I used Spice Islands Louisiana cajun seasoning. You can also substitute an equal amount of beer for some of the broth. It is a keeper!

Ewwww!! The predominant taste was SALT. Probably because of 2 reasons: 1) store-bought andouille (not great) and 2) lousy Creole seasoning. The first ingredient for the Creole was SALT. I followed others' suggestions and skipped the precooking of the lentils and also added extra veggies. Didn't help. I threw the whole pot away after serving just my husband and me. Yuck!

We frequent Guiseppe's and finally made this soup last night. It is identical to what you would be served at the restaurant. I did use low salt beef broth because I thought the recipe called for it. We and the neighbors loved it!

Nice quick soup. As written, I agree that the recipe is a bit unfinished. However, this recipe does great by spending the time (and $) on great ingredients. The modifications I'd recommend: 1) Definitely cut back on the cooking time for the lentils. The entire first 30 minute boiling and simmering step just reduces them to mush and I think can be omitted, 2) Use a good gelatin-filled stock rather than just store-bought broth or stock, 3) The carrots, onions, celery, and sausage can all be increased (1/2 cup for vegetables, full 12 oz for sausage) 4) I also added the cooked rice (1 1/2 cup long grain, 1/2 cup black wild) and would have been disappointed without it.

I increased the quantity of vegetables from 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup of each. This is a wonderful, spicy soup. We'll definitely have this again.

I used the other reviewers' advice and really enjoyed this recipe. I used 2 cans each of broth and water to make up the 9 cups. I used 1/2 c. onions, 1 c. each of carrots and celery, and I doubled the sausage (sliced and cut into quarters). Near the end, I added 1 pkg. of coarsely chopped baby spinach and 3 cups cooked rice. This made 8 hearty servings of a tasty and pretty main dish soup. By the way, lentils don't require this much cooking time; 45 minutes total should do it which makes the dish pretty quick, too.

My family enjoyed this receipe very much. It was easy to make and great for a cold wintery night. I also used low salt chicken broth as other readers recommended. Thanks for the tip!

I thought this soup was great. Though, I did use low sodium broth as suggested by other reviewers. I also added some fresh spinach and then let the soup simmer. Excellent, I will surely be making this again. Also for those who don't like it too spicy, I have made this with kiellbasa instead and it still adds tons flavor. I prefer the andouille though.

I've never been a fan of fennel seed. Is there anything else I could use to replace it, or will it be good even if I omit the fennel seed.

I think this is the easiest soup I've ever made, and it turned out great. I added a little extra sausage just because I love the stuff. I packed this soup in thermoses and took it on a fishing trip with a friend. He gave it rave reviews. A good hearty soup for a cold day.

Delicious! I added more andouille sausage to increase the distinctive flavor, which I enjoy. It is easy and fast to prepare,

After reading the reviews, I really watched the salt, and it came out just right. I also added about 1 c. diced potato. I really recommend making your own cajun/creole spice, because then YOU control the heat and salt. I have always made my own and I add very little salt, and instead of some of the cayenne, I use hot Hungarian paprika, which makes it taste richer and more complex, and adds heat at the same time. If I want more heat, I can always add it. (Besides, it's cheaper making it yourself, and you can make tons of it for gifts for friends!)

Loved this soup. It was so easy to make. Was going to purchase a frozen version until I found this recipe. Will be preparing this one often.

I agree with the previous reviewer, this soup was way too salty. I would definitely try to find a low-salt broth to use instead. In spite of the saltiness, the soup was tasty and spicy enough for my tastes. No need for salt at the end, just pepper. It is very filling and good for a chilly evening.

This was tasty, but so salty with the sausage in it. The second day, after it cooked down some more, even worse. I finally found some "no salt added" beef broth in a health food store to use next time. That, plus the lowest salt chicken broth I could find, should do the trick. By the way, I just noticed that the store brand regular chicken broth actually had less sodium per can than the "low salt" national brand. Go figure.

I can't believe some reviewers wouldn't make this dish again. This soup is so easy and so good. I've made it countless times (without changing a thing) and it always gets rave reviews.

Excellent. I omitted the creole seasoning since I didn't have it. I used turkey sausage. I served it with brown rice mixed with pecan bits. My husband said this soup was awesome.

If you use firey hot creole sausage, cut back the thyme to 1/8 tsp, and same for the sauteed fennel seed. i tasted as I went, and am I ever glad I did! Then it was spectacular.
