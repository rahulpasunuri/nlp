I have made this recipe several times, all to rave reviews. I've made it with bulgar, brown rice, and quinoa (all equally delicious). Once I didn't have the tomatoes, so I used vegetable broth for the grain to soak up. I'm making it again tonight for a party.

We made this when we had a vegan among our weekend guests. It was wonderful made exactly as written. The currants, allspice and sugar do not make it sweet, adding instead a great dimension. Well prepared bulgar in the right proportion of eggplant does not get mushy. The only drawback is this recipe involves a fair amount of work chopping, etc.

What is wrong with you people?!? Neither of you made the recipe as written and yet you rate it poorly! Feel free to change things up as you wish but then don't trash the actual recipe. Geeez!!

I made this as a weeknight dish. I halved the bulgur portion of the recipe and used four tomatoes, one zucchini, and one red pepper. I added sausage to the stuffing to make it a one-dish meal. This had an interesting flavor and, minus my addition, is very healthy. I also used less oil than called for in the recipe.

The recipe looked and sounded great but was mushy and disappointing. I left out the currants, sugar and allspice as I did not want a sweet flavor with the other dishes I was serving.
