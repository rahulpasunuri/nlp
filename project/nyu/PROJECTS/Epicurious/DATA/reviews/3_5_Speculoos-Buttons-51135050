These were terrific and easy. Everyone was so impressed with how cute they appear and delicious they taste! Rolled each log in different sugar, so when I packaged them up, the bags were so pretty and colorful. I also froze a batch at Xmas time and six weeks later they are just as delicious!! I thought the icing was easy and perfect consistency. Will definitely make again.

These were really fun to make and delicious. I don't bake much and I usually like chocolate but I wanted something special for Christmas. I ate about half of them myself and they also made a nice last-minute gift in a cute holiday tin. I used regular molasses and thought it tasted good, so I wouldn't seek out the light. My small oven bakes hot and I cut them thick, so I only got 30, but that was plenty for me. Nice to have that option.

Loved the recipe and how the cookies turned out. Took these to a cookie exchange this past weekend and everybody loved them! I am making another batch to have to mix in with our Christmas cookies. Per another review I had no problem with the cookies falling apart. All I can think is that there must have been too much flour ? I followed the recipe to a T for cookie and used my royal icing recipe for the glaze. (1 egg white whipped up to form peaks, add 2 cups icing sugar and juice of 1/2 lemon - thicken with more icing sugar, thin with more lemon juice). Love the results. As always thanks Bon Appetit!

Watch the cooking time--ours came out great, after 8-9 minutes. As a Belgian, I can vouch for the authenticity in flavor. These cookies actually taste like the speculoos I remember from my youth.

I loved the spice flavor of this cookie and it's retro look by using different colors of sanded sugar and sprinkles. The dough was perfect, however, I would only allow about 40 minutes in the freezer before taking it out to re-roll, as my dough was frozen solid in 1 hour. They still turned out beautifully even without re-rolling. The powdered sugar glaze was perfect! Nice and thick. I only took one log of dough out of the freezer, and did have some trouble with the sugar not sticking to the dough, but all in all turned out great. I made a half batch of the icing since I made only one log of the cookie dough. I still have two logs left in the freezer in case I need fresh cookies fast! Williams Sonoma has a wonderful assortment of sprinkles and sanded sugar available - from traditional reds and greens to purples, metallics, etc.

These are very good cookies. Keep an eye on them in the oven; because they're so small you want to be sure they don't dry out. I don't know why one reviewer had trouble with the dough falling apart. The log kept together and then, while slicing the frozen log, there was no trouble with it falling apart. I had a bit of trouble having the sanding sugar stick to the egg white wash on the frozen log; next time I might leave the log out of the freezer for a few minutes before attempting this. Glaze, too, was perfect: it was very thick, as the recipe indicates, so it doesn't "run" when put on the cookies. (I put the glaze in a sandwich bag, snipped a teeny bit of the bag's corner, and squeezed the glaze onto the cookies as described in the recipe.) These are tasty, easy, and pretty. Will make again.

Followed the recipe to the T. It fell apart while mixing the dough together. I kept going because most recipes in Bon Appetit are excellent, but not this one.When I pulled it out later, the cookie fell apart with every slice. I ended up with 4 cookies out of one log. Very disappointing. In my opinion, the recipe needs 2 eggs and 2 sticks of butter. The glaze was too runny as well. It does not need 7 teaspoons of water. Maybe start with 3 and add a little at a time.

I thought they were great. Be sure and take them out after an hour and re-roll. However, when we sliced them they did get messed up again. Not sure how to keep them round after slicing. They looked just like the picture and tasted delicious. We made them the day we got the magazine.
