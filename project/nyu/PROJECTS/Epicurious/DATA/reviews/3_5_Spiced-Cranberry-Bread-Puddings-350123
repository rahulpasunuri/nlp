Everyone loved this,even the people who don't normally"waste calories " on dessert! I used Knudsen's bottled cranberry juice concentrate as I always have some for salad dressings so I was concerned that it would need more sugar but the tartness was a perfect contrast to the custard.I made the custard and poured it over the bread several hours ahead and it was perfect.

This was really exceptional! I made this dessert for my gourmet wine-dinner group and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. I put about 8 cranberries on each layer and then used just the reduced syrup to drizzle around the bread pudding when I served it. I did add a little extra orange zest to my cranberries and let them simmer until they cracked and were soft. A previous reviewer didn't care for the texture of the cranberries, but I cooked them so that they were soft and delicious. Several of my guests wondered whether there was really bread in the dessert because it was so light and fluffy - more like a souffle than bread pudding. This is already on my Christmas Eve menu. I would give it "5" forks if available. Yummy!

loved this recipe. i would not use all of the cranberry mixture only about 2 cranberries with sauce per layer. and use the rest of the sauce and cranberries over pancakes or waffles.

The cook from Arlington is right. This was sour and the texture of the berries was a real minus.

I made the recipe as written and was disappointed. The cranberries ended up tasting like cranberry sauce from a can. I could barely taste the orange or Grand Marnier. I like the idea, though, and might try the layered bread pudding with a different filling.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. Did not change a thing and found it very easy. I did not have the right size ramekins and used coffee mugs, with excellent results!
