I made this for New Year's Day 2009, and loved it. It was a hit! I also added andouille sausage, skipped the lemons though. It was phenomenal and everyone raved over it. I look forward to making it again.

I love making this recipe for a large group of people. The only changes I make are that I use crab legs instead, (I don't like to use live crabs). I also add some spicy cajan chicken sausage and it is wonderful!! My guests love it and it is so easy to clean up.

This is great  made it in a turkey fryer, which was perfect. one important change  i LOVE salt, but i think it was much too salty. I'd go down to 1/4 cup or less. also, i agree that prep doesnt need to be anywhere near this complicated  just add all the ingredients sequentially by how long they take and scoop them all out together at the end. finally, dont forget to add sausage!

I made this recipe for a dinner party and everyone raved about it for weeks afterwards! It was so easy to make I couldn't believe it. I used smow crab legs instead of blue crab and I added cajan sausage otherwise I followed the recipe and I will make it again.

This is a take off on a very famous "Low country", South Carolina recipe called "Frogmore". It is so delicious! It has been around since what seems like the beginning of time & is still served on Sundays, picnics, & tailgateing at the football games. A real crowd pleaser! It isn't as labor intensive as this recipe makes it. Bring water to boil with seasonings & simmer for 15min.,add crabs, simmer til done, (crabs are considered to be optional), remove, now add 2lbs. spicy smokey sausage such as andouille (this is an important ingred.), simmer 5 min., add potatoes, simmer 10-12 min., add 10 ears broken in 1/2 or quarters, simmer 5 min., add shrimp, simmer 3 min. Drain, dump all on newspaper or plastic cloth. Need lots of paper towels. Dig in & have fun! Beer is the drink of the day!

We made this recipe the other night with 6 friends. Not only was the meal excellent, we had a lot of fun. It was very interactive because everyone wanted to be involved in cooking the crab. I couldn't find blue crab so we used dungenese which is quite a bit more expensive in these parts, but it was well worth it. 4 forks!

Last night we beat the January blahs with a shrimp boil. I served this to my card club with newspapers on the table and damp washcloths for napkins. It was just plain delicious and a fun thing to do in the winter.

Okay, maybe it's just me, but how is KIELBASA a substitute for CRAB? You made an entirely different recipe, lady, don't rate this one!

What FUN, we had 20 freinds over for a BBQ, Not only did this turn out to be one of the most enjoyable meals, it was a blast to make on the back deck with everyone wondering what was going in next... If you like the idea of cooking outdoors, this is the one to do! NOTE< having a crab steamer is a plus for this dish...

Did not have the crab but used 6 lbs of shrimp. Excellent - even had the garlic spread on french bread (just like roasted garlic!). This will be our new company dish - no real preparation and everyone gathering around the cooker to help (we have a 32 quart crab/turkey propane gas cooker)

I didn't have crabs and made it with kielbasa sausage chunks as a substitute. It tasted great but made it a little greasy.
