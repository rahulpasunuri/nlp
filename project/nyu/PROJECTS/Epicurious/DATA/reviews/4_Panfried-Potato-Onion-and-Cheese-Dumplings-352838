Satisfying and delicious but needed some additions to really up the flavors. I substituted goat cheese for the Muenster which added some creaminess and a nice tang. The potato mixture seemed really dry even after I added the cheese so I put in about 1/4 cup white wine which made it a nice consistency and added some complexity to the flavors. I also added a generous spoonful of minced garlic, fresh chives and s&p. Then I cooked them in a chicken broth white wine mixture instead of water. They turned out amazing!

This was a good recipe, but it was difficult to cook all 22 dumplings at the same time -- they stuck together and didn't necessarily cook evenly. I cooked them in smaller batches (I had already more than doubled the recipe), and it worked great.

OOOH, these are so good! I used Old Cheddar, and added some bacon. Dressed with sour cream and dill. Delicious. Lighter than perogies, but yes, very similar.

I used Fontina and added cayenne for a touch of spice. Seasoned the mixture with sea salt to help bring out the flavors instead of bacon for the vegetarian in my family

Instead of Muenster, I used smoked gouda and 2 pieces of veggie bacon. Amazing.

As to the reviewer that outed these dumplings as pierogi, well they are... almost... because they use the short cut of a wonton/dumpling wrapper. I had desperately wanted to title this recipe as "fauxrogi" but common sense won out.

This was AMAZING. Delicious, easy, the perfect pub/game/weekend night food. I made a huge batch and froze the leftovers - am looking forward to eating them again soon!

These were delicious, fun to make and a novel way to do potatoes. Instead of Muenster, we used smoked mozzarella (but only because we do not eat meat, otherwise I agree that bacon would be a great addition), and I added a little garlic to the onion mixture.

These were just okay. Between the potato and the pasta, the dish was a bit bland. Adding some bacon to the filling would not be a bad idea, and would help to amp it up a bit.

Ummm aren't these better known as "Pierogi's"
