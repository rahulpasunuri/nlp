I used 1/2 cup creamy all-natural peanut butter, 4 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1/2 tbsp sriacha, 3 tbsp sugar, 3 tbsp fish sauce and 1/2 cup coconut milk...blended till smooth and let sit for about 6 hrs...so yummy and easy too...served it with chicken skewers and shrimp skewers that I baked with a little brush of this sauce on before hand. Rave reviews!

Good with the modifications that others have said (coconut milk and splash of fish sauce). I found mine very salty- I think it may have been the type of soy sauce I used (gluten free) so I ended up adding 1/6 cup extra peanut butter and 1/6 coconut milk, along with an extra 1/3 cup water).

I have been so disappointed with store bought peanut sauce, I just have not bothered. I love this Sauce!! I have been craving the peanut sauce at a local Vietnamese restaurant and I devour every drop of it with their Spring rolls. Thanks Kate for having this recipe. I did modify it, with two cloves of garlic, 2 tbs brown sugar, less coconut milk, because I like it a little thicker. Simmer to blend the flavors. Delicious! The fun part, my 8 year old daughter Amira made it and felt like a queen chef! It is so yummy!

...also forgot to mention, I used coconut milk in place of water!

This is a great base recipe, but I felt like it needed some doctoring up. I added a few extra seasonings (curry powder, extra tumeric and coriander, a touch of ginger), a tiny splash of fish sauce, and tomato paste, and substituted sriracha for the cayenne.

Just what I was looking for. Used coconut milk instead of water and less of it. This is super simple, but has that peanut sauce flavor I was craving. Also added some chopped peanuts and some siracha.

Delicious after a few changes. Like previous reviewers, I used coconut milk instead of water, and less then the recipe called for because I wanted a thicker dipping sauce. I also used brown sugar instead of white. I simmered everything together in a small pot and then chilled it overnight. It was even better after sitting. My guests devoured it.

forgot to mention that I used coconut milk instead of water. It helps the texture and flavor.

Made the sauce and the chicken sates quickly before surprise guests arrived. It was easy,delicious and got rave reviews. My 11 yr. old son has begun making this peanut sauce to put on everything he eats. Crazy, but he LOVES it!

Right after I made it, I thought there was way too much garlic. After it sat overnight the raw taste settled out and it was very good. I reduced the water but only a little.

I thought this was excellent as a sauce for my broccoli & chicken stir fry. Didn't expect to like it so much because it was pretty thin...will probably not add as much water next time - as others suggested. Very nice flavor & texture with the crunchy peanut butter. Will make again & again.

Oh dear - not a success at all - we love peanut sauce, but this was just awful. Really flavorless, and after I tasted it I tried to adjust seasonings, but nothing worked. NOT one I will try again - still searching for a good peanut sauce recipe that is easy to make...

Great recipe idea but this might be a bit better. I use: 1/4 c peanut butter 1/2 c water 2 tbsp brown sugar 1 tbsp soy 2 tsp lemon juice 1/2 tsp crushed chilly peppers 1/4 tsp garlic powder Simmer 5 minutes and enjoy!!

Great flavour, and yes better after sitting for awhile. Skip the water for a very thick sauce (which I prefer). Chunky peanut butter adds a nice texture. Works great with the other sate marinades, not just the one it was designed to accompany.

I have made this recipe many times, and my guests and co-workers all LOVE it. I just wish I would remember to just use a HIGH QUALITY canned coconut milk, rather then wasting time and energy processing the flaked coconut. The Dipping sauce, I feel, needs a few hours or overnight for the flavors to develop, and it is not a thick sauce, as I like for a sate.

Since most reviewers said this sauce was too thin, I used 1/2 cup peanut butter. I also used 2 cloves of garlic and will add more pepper in the future (I foolishly thought my kids would eat this so I only used the 1/8 teaspoon). Very good. I will definately make this again and try it out with other dishes.

I didn't use the recipe for the sate but instead used the sate kambling recipe from penzeys.com and substituted the lamb for 1.5 lbs cubed filet mignon. This sauce was an outstanding compliment. Instead of smooth I used chunky style peanut butter. The sauce was thin but that was not a bad thing since both the sate and the sauce are very flavorful.

A little thin in consistency but good flavor.

I thought this was a really good recipe. If I were to make it again I would try it with more garlic and more cayenne for a little kick! I did think that it called for too much water so I added more peanut butter and a little more sugar.

Delicious!!! I added some chile oil to spice it up and used 1 packet of Equal instead of the sugar (I am diabetic). The sauce complemented the sates perfectly. I also zested the limes before juicing and garnished my platter with the zest. Everyone at my party raved about the sates and sauce, and I will definitely make this again.

Very good. I added some Thai red curry paste to give it a little heat and a little more flavor since it seemed a little bland and it turned out very well. The left-over sauce was great on stir fried vegetables (also added the left over chicken satay).
