At our house, this is called "The Ridiculous Appetizer", so called because it is one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten! Each component compliments the others to perfection! There are many steps, but after having prepared it so many times, it has become rote. The only thing that we changed was vidalia/sweet onions for red, but that's just a general preference in our house.

Although it involved a lot of work to prepare, the bruschetta was delicious! Each component was great tasting on its own. The flavor of the homemade ricotta does get lost with all the other ingredients piled up on top, but since it is a snap to make, it was worth it. I agree that you need to cut up the toppings to make it easier to eat, although it looks better with the full onion slices as stated in the recipe. This is a good appetizer for entertaining.

Here's another Cook from Brooklyn saying exactly the same as my fellow Brooklyn Cook back in Dec of 2009. This is also my first review, yes almost 2 years later, but I still remember how amazing this was. I also served it at a NYE party, a huge hit. Beware, it's a lot of work and can be messy to eat, but worth it! The taste combinations are out of this world. If I could give it 5 stars, I would.

amazing appetizer.. The onion are a key element - brings the fig/cheese combination concept to a whole new level. Brought this to a party last night and everybody loved it!

I never review a recipe. In all my years of cooking, this is the first I've felt compelled to comment on. It is by far the best app. I've ever made. It's now a regular for ever New Year's Eve dinner.

I used baguettes instead as I thought it might be less messy, and it was. I think about half the amount of ricoota would be better, and I should have cut the onions and figs smaller for the smaller bread. I would probably double the amount of figs too. Great flavor

y'know, what it really came down to was that this was a lot of work, a lot of cleaning up for a dish that I felt was unremarkable. let me put it to you this way, I remember all the work that went into making it but I don't remember eating it. :(

Excellent...will try it on small baguette with less sugar and more vinegar next time.

Great appetizer served for Easter dinner. I needed to cook the fig mixture a bit longer to get a syrupy consistency to the reduction

Fantastic! Flew off the appetizer plate at a recent dinner party. I made fresh ricotta, and used balsamic vinegar. Mine was not soupy at all, perhaps because I let the fig mixture reduce quite a bit and it thickened once it cooled. I finished it with a generous sprinkel of fresh thyme instead of oregano and a drizzle of olive oil.

Messy and difficult to eat, but very good components. I made one batch with a very strong blue cheese and another with a herbed goat cheese instead of the ricotta. I think the blue cheese was the best, but the ricotta was tasty too. It could have used something crunchy as it was too soupy and slippery. Very nice change of pace from the regular tomato type of bruschetta. I skipped the step of pouring hot water on the figs and just boiled them in the wine mixture because my figs were very ripe and soft. I also used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar in the fig mixture. Easy and good recipe, but the final product is not a "looker".

Very tasty. Each component on its own was delicious but the onions dominated the finished product, to the point that you didn't notice the lovely fresh ricotta...A bit messy to eat as a passed appetizer.
