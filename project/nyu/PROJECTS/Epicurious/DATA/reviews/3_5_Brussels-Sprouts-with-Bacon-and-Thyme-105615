Fantastic! Easy prep and quick. I opted to add a minced shallot and a pinch of garlic to the recipe. After blanching and straining I mixed the ingredients and popped the skillet in the oven on 400 for 25 mins (roasting vs frying) and the sprouts were extremely delicious!

Delicious! No surprises here, it tastes exactly like brussels sprouts with bacon and thyme. I felt a little bit guilty about not pouring out at least SOME of the bacon grease before mixing in the brussels sprouts, but I was glad I didn't, as it turned out rich and delectable and not at all greasy. Next time I think I will use even more thyme, but that is the only change I would make.

Delicious! Made them just as the recipe said. Even my 3 year old liked them.

My husband who is a Brussel Sprout lover; raves about this recipe, the bacon and Thyme make it more edible for me. I do reduce the amount of bacon grease for health reasons. I also cut the Sprouts in half.

This is ok but nothing special. I am still searching for that tasty Brussels sprouts recipe!

Good & easy. Poored off some bacon fat, added lemon zest and a little butter. Just as good.

The best thing about this simple recipe is that you can boil the brussel sprouts, let them cool off and set them aside while you work on other cooking projects, and then quickly finish up the cooking after everything else is ready to go. The flavor combos are simple and elegant.

It's okay. A bit dry, but the basic flavor is good. I would prefer to braise the brussel sprouts but couldn't find a recipe in time so used this one.

Very simple but quite good. Cutting the brussels sprouts in half is absolutely necessary, this lets the bad flavours escape. The brussels sprouts will be sweet, with a hint of smokiness from the bacon.

My non-brussel sprout eating husband thought these were pretty good. My 15 month-old ate several the next day. Although I felt guilty for not pouring off any bacon grease, the sprouts were simply divine. A great use for those tall stalks of sprouts that Whole Foods was practically giving away after Thanksgiving.

Simple, easy, but very elegant. Served with toasted garlic fish and it was the perfect accompaniment. I doubled the recipe, but still no left overs. Will definitely make again.

I really liked the flavors in this dish. I substituted real bacon bits and added some butter in place of the bacon fat. It worked out well and was easier than frying bacon. Great dish!

This is my favorite flavor combo for sprouts, but I never boil them. I simply trim, halve, and saute directly in the bacon drippings (I only use one slice for two people), and add a tablespoon or two of chicken broth. It's our favorite side dish, very crunchy and healthy with alot of flavor.

Talk about easy. And fast. The thyme gives it a kick, and bacon is always tasty with Brussels sprouts. I think I'll cook them a bit less next time so that have more of a crunch, but definitely a keeper.

Made this for my family that has always turned their noses up to the "cabbage smell" of traditioanlly prepared sprouts. They actually loved it and requested it again!!

I made this using baby brussels sprouts and reduced the cooking time accordingly. It was simple and delicious, and was great reheated in the oven before serving.

We love our Brussels Sprouts, so this recipe was perfect for us. Very nice blend of flavors. We actually cook them on the stove until they are a bit browned and crunchy on the outside. Yum! We made these last year for Thanksgiving, and we plan on making them again this year!

So simple & quite tasty. Will definately make this again whenever brussel sprouts are in season.

Brussels sprouts at their best! We really enjoyed this savory dish for our Thanksgiving feast. I'm looking forward to making it again this year!

This recipe has changed the way think about brussels sprouts - wonderful! We had it for Christmas dinner, and are making it for the third time already (it's Jan 11). Fresh sprouts are key, as is not overcooking them (of course).

Easy and a crowd pleaser for the brussel sprout lovers in the family. I'd certainly make it again.

This was a wonderful dish for my Thanksgiving table. My husband is a huge fan of brussel sprouts and this is by far his favorite way to eat them.

Tried this recently- it was big hit!! I am discovering Brussels sprouts and finding I like them, as does my boyfriend. We loved this dish, and served it alongside a pork tenderloin with a quick apple chutney and it was perfect. I added a splash of cider vinegar near the end to help deglaze the pot a bit, because, hey, why waste those nice cooked bits at the bottom? Making it again tonight, in fact!

A wonderful dish and a simple one to prepare. A heavenly fragrance wafts up from the pan while you are cooking it, and the bright, fresh flavor does not disappoint. My Brussels-sprouts hating relatives scarfed this up at the Thanksgiving table.

Bacon is good on everything. Here the Thyme and bacon balance out the natuarally bitter sprouts. Don't be bashful with the bacon and bacon fat here. The flavors are wonderful. Will make again

Very nice dish. I would prepare it differently next time, possibly by spliting the sprouts and then broiling away some of the liquid for added crunch. Still quite fine as prepared.

Much better if you do them by Fine Cooking's method of sear and steam. Cook bacon in about a TB of olive oil over high heat in a sautee pan, remove bacon. Add 1 large shallot, cut into thick disks, 2 cloves of garlic, smashed and the halved brussel sprouts. Sautee until browned, then add 1/4 c water, thyme, s&p and cover. Reduce heat to medium and steam about 5 minutes. Uncover and stir in 1 TB maple syrup, 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 TB butter. Serve.

I never liked Brussel Sprouts before I tried this recipe. Now I buy them whenver they're in season. I agree with the reviewer who credited the good taste to the bacon oil - it must take out the bitterness in the sprouts. Great taste and packed with vitamins!

This is a good easy recipe although not low in fat it is tasty and simple for those who don't do a lot with brussel sprouts.

This is a new way to enjoy brussel sprouts. We love them anyway, but I added some shallots, sliced thin and sauteed in the with the bacon. I didn't have fresh thyme so used dried and it wasn't too bad. Great new recipe.

Best darn brussel sprouts I ever ate, even my kids loved them, my 14 year old was eating them out of the pan before they were done

Good and simple. Easier to cook bacon crisp and then crumble it. Be sure to use fresh thyme.

Very easy to make and well worth it. Not greasy at all; the bacon flavor cuts the edge of bitterness from many brussels sprouts recipes.
