Easy and very tasty. We used napa cabbage.

I don't know what people are talking about! I made this and it was amazing!! Flavourless? You have GOT to be kidding me! If anything I got a bit too much flavour. I didn't have savoy or beans so I just used bok choi and broccoli and it was still delicious. Any green would go with this. I would not only make it again, I am turning the sauce into a household staple! Everything I keep in the fridge anyway! Perfect.

Delicious, satisfying, and healthy! I used fresh savoy cabbage from my garden; the texture of the sauteed cabbage curling around strands of pasta with clinging bits of melting Parmigiano was lots of fun. I made the recipe as stated and it was great as a meal on its own.

The sauce is absolutely fabulous. I made this in early September, and the fresh haricots verts are magnificent. No need for cabbage--perhaps in winter when there are no good vegetables, but even so, why complicate a great simple dish? What is important here is the sauce. It is a wonderful combination of flavors. Adjust the proportions to your taste, but if you use fresh, good quality haricots verts, this sauce will absolutely enhance them. I used regular old spaghetti. I doubt that the multi-grain factor would make any difference. Keep it simple and fresh. For the pesto, I used a blender and pulsed, adding some pasta cooking liquid(slightly cooled). Then you can taste and see what you need to add. For me it was a few more anchovies, salt and pepper. At the end I tasted the pasta and added a squeeze of lemon juice and a bit more cheese and pasta cooking liquid. It was not only delicious but quite beautiful and elegant. Serve with a good red wine and this makes a wonderful dinner for casual but sophisticated company.

Great recipe. The pesto was delicious and would be tasty spread atop good crusty bread as well. I think 1 or 2 additonal anchovy fillets might be a good addition as the anchovy flavor was fairly subtle to me. I used 1/2 tbsp. less capers than called for and a tbsp. less oil in the pesto. This is the first time I'd used savoy cabbage and I was pleasantly surprised at how much milder the flavor is than green cabbage. I used fresh beans which were delicious in this recipe and whole wheat fettucine. I loved the contrast of the clean, fresh flavors of the beans and cabbage to the salty, stronger flavors in the pesto.

I left out the anchovies, and added some canned green chiles to the mix (I was intrigued by the idea of the roasted jalapenos, but was feeling lazy...) It was delicious. I think the additional garlic is key - I can definitely see how the unadulterated recipe would turn out bland.

Blah. As a frequent user of epicurious, I was intruiged by this recipe's interesting blend of ingredients. In the end, despite overcompensating for what other reviewers warned as a blandness by adding extra flavor (garlic, capers, anchovies), I was disappointed. It 'might' serve as an acceptable side to a pork chop or loin. Those who think they can save it might have some bacon or lemon on hand. Also, slice the cabbage as thin as possible to match the thickness of the pasta. Oh well, I guess it got rid of that head of cabbage that had been taunting me from the fridge.

I really did not like this dish. I followed the recipe pretty precisely, and the taste was bland and not interesting. I ended up having to add quite a bit of salt just to be able to taste anything.

Both my husband and I were surprised we liked this so much. This is the 3rd time I'm making it. I skip the anchovies (vegetarian) and add some roasted jalepenos to the puree instead.

The flavors came together well. It was very tasty and satisfying. I would use slightly less oil next time.

Easy to make, tasty and healthy. What more can I say. I do add a little unhealthy (but flavorful) spicy Italian sausage. I crumble the sausage, and fry it. Then I fry the cabbage in the sausage fat. OK, not so healthy, but really good.

Delicious. This tasted very healthy and fresh and was perfectly salty. Some of the reviewers commented that they wanted more anchovies, my personal taste is to cut the amount in half. After a bit of prep and chopping it comes together very quickly and easily.

My family and I loved this. As a lover of all things salty (including anchovies), I was surprised to find that I was satisfied with the amount indicated. I wouldn't opposed, however, to adding another fillet to the sauce.

I thought this was OK, not fantastic. A little more lemon might have balanced out of the saltiness. I thought there was too much cabbage, and couldn't taste the anchovies at all.

Better than it sounds; the flavors and textures work nicely together. Next time I will use more anchovies and reduce the olive oil in the salsa to 2 T. I had to substitute Napa cabbage. The leftover anchovies make a nice garnish on top.

This was fantastic! We've had multi-grain pasta before but never liked it until this recipe. My husband and two daughters (2 and 6) liked it as well and my 2 year old is picky. I may try it with the lemon next time although I can't imagine this tasting any better than it already tastes.

This was probably my least favorite Bon Apetit recipe I have tried. We tried a few things to salvage it, but in the end, I didn't find it that fast or easy to make and the flavors were strange to agree with a previous review. I usually like different, interesting flavors, but this was not up to par. I would avoid trying this out.

This recipe was downright strange. It's like Asian/Italion/French Fusion. In the end I thought it was tasty, but my husband was not crazy about it so I probably would not make again (or would try a variation w/ less cabbage and more pasta). I substituted the anchovies for fish sauce.

Glad the wbsite was updated with when to add the pesto. It wasn't in the magazine version! Enoy!

We thought this was really a great, fresh and unique recipe. We used fresh beans and steamed them slightly prior. Other than that we didn't change the recipe -- it was really a nice, refreshing dish with beautiful color/presentation.

I made it with fresh haricot too. This dish is healthy, easy to make, easy to get ingredients, tastes good and my children liked it. What more could you ask for?

This is fast, tasty and beautiful. Savoy cabbage has a great vibrant color. I used fresh beans instead of frozen and they cooked quickly. Norfolk -- the recipe does indicate when to add the pesto -- it is the parsley mixture from the food processor.

Good, fast, healthy. I made it with lima beans, instead of green beans. Leftovers were as good as the first bite.

This was good, but as did the previous reviewer, I also made some tweaks. You'll definitely want to add the juice of at least half a lemon to the pesto to counteract some of the briny flavor of the capers. I used 2 tsp anchovy paste instead in the pesto instead of chopped anchovies. All in all, it was good and the bright green flavors were nice.

I gave this recipe a "good" rating because overall I liked the dish, but think the recipe itself needs some refinements: 1. For starters, you'll note that the instructions tell you to make the pesto and set it aside... but never tell you when to add it. I did so at the end, but it did make the cabbage clump-up a bit. I would perhaps add it diluted with a little pasta water to ensure even distribution 2. I found the caper/anchovy pesto a tad strong. I added the zest of one lemon and a tablespoon of lemon juice which I think helped to even out some flavors 3. I'd suggest the option of using fresh haricot verts. They cook so quickly that I don't think the cooking instructions need to change 4. Lastly, and this was my own mistake, I'd stick to the recipe suggestions and only saute the veggie items briefly, as if you overdo it they turn from a vibrant green to something not quite as attractive. All in all though, my fiance and I gobbled it up. So I'd suggest you enjoy and play with the recipe to your liking!
