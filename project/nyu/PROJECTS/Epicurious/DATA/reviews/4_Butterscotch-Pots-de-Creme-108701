Really delicious. I topped it with whipped cream made with a little lime juice and a sprinkle of Maldon salt crystals.

Haven't made it, but will for my next fabulous dessert needs; we love my chocolate pots de creme -- IDEA: with the reviews saying it's more caramel-like and the current salted caramel trend, I'm going to top the creme with a dollop of warm dark chocolate/butter ganache and a bit of flaked salt. Can't wait!!!

Really great dessert! My family put it in the top 5 of all time so far! I did not try seeking out the special sugars, my lame grocery store had neither so I used dark brown and regular sugar and it tasted very butterscotch-y, rich and delicious. Served it with whipped cream and strawberries and blackberries. Will definitely make again!

Great smooth texture in a straightforward, and quick recipe. I agree with Medford that this is more of a caramel rather than a true butterscotch that has butter as a key ingredient.

I have not made this myself, but did have opportunity to try made by M. J. Adams herself at her restuarant, The Corn Exchange, in Rapid City, SD. It was a sublime end to a really terrific meal. I will try making it myself if I can find the sugars in my small AL town!

I made this recipe for Valentine's Day and it was incredible. The sugars were worth the search-I found them in the health food section. I made the custard earlier that day,refrigerated it, and then baked it so it was lukewarm when we ate it. Refrigerating it first extended the cooking time to 1 hour.

Unbelievably smooth and creamy dessert, with a deep, can't-quite-pinpoint flavor that reminded me of toffee/praline/caramel more than butterscotch (but maybe I've never had good butterscotch). 3.8 forks.

Yummy and easy! I didn't have time to get the muscovado and demerara sugars, so I used light brown and granulated, respectively. I was concerned about the amount of sugar compared to water for the caramel, but it came out fine. I also used 5 eggs, as recommended. Good flavor and very smooth. I lined my roasting pan with a kitchen towel and covered the whole thing with a sheet pan for more even cooking. The other reviewers were right though, this only makes about 4 ramekins. If you want 6, do one and a half times the recipe.

I needed a quick dessert to take to dinner at the in-laws', so I subbed light brown sugar for the Demerara and dark brown sugar for the Muscovado. TURNED OUT GREAT. Will try it with the other sugars next time. I added 1/2 tablespoon of Chivas Scotch Whiskey to each pot before baking for some extra flavor. These set up QUICK, and are definitely a KEEPER in my regular repertoire. YUM!

We loved this recipe! I decided to try this one after having some fabulous butterscotch pudding at a local restaurant. I've never made pots de creme before, and these were easy and definitely satisfied my craving!

My wife and I are totally hooked on this recipe now! One of our favorites for sure. Easy to make but takes a few pans but it's worth it.

My 80-something neighbor is ill. Nothing tastes good, her clothes are hanging. In November, I delivered two small dishes, one for her, one for her husband. When she finished her own, her husband handed his over, still half-full, for her to finish. Now I deliver about once a week! She's looking much better!

This was luscious and easy! Even my caramel and butterscotch hating friend enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe, and used raw sugar and dark brown sugar, as I wasn't able to go searching for the others, and it still had a rich, deep flavor. It developed a bit of a skin on the top that I didn't really like, and really seemed more like butterscotch pudding to me, rather than the denser texture that I associate with pots de creme.

We all loved this smooth, rich, creamy and flavorful pots de creme. Easy to make once I found the sugars, but I think the alternatives would work as well. I definitely would make these again, but would need to increase recipe to get more than 5 servings.

I bought the right sugars to make this but probably won't be using them again - at least not for this recipe. My family was polite about it and finished their servings but were clearly disappointed that it wasn't chocolate pots de creme. It was easy enough to make but still not worth the effort (or the washing up) and mine came out thinner and 'soupier' that I was expecting. They did look pretty (I decorated mine with whipped cream and grated chocolate) and the cream was a nice foil to the richness of the butterscotch but overall, I probably won't bother with this one again. Thee are too many other better recipes out there.

I have made this at least four times and it always comes out fabulous. Lucious flavor and creaminess. Recipe doubles well. I did cut the muscavoado down to 5 tablespoons after teh first time I made it.

Rating: 4
In a word, SUPERB! I used light muscovado as I couldn't find dark, and it appeared to work out just fine as this is absolutely the best baked custard-type dessert I've ever eaten. I used 5 oz. ramekins and made only four. I agree with the other reviewer who said six servings would be skimpy.

Rating: 4
My friends and family love this recipe!! It is also good when made as a flan or as a creme brulee. I've made it both with the special sugars and also just using plain white and light brown sugar. I was probably the only one who could barely notice the subtle difference. I have used about a third less sugar than what's called for and it is still delicious. Very easy and quick to prepare, yet everyone thinks you went to a lot of trouble.

OK, so I couldn't find the special sugars, but really wanted to try this. Made it with dark brown sugar and regular sugar to sub. Very tasty still. I ended up only making 4, because I think 6 of them would have been pretty scrawny portions.

so with all the back & forth on the sugars, i tracked them down and can't imagine how this could taste without them. Though i really enjoyed it, some thought it too rich & sweet.

The texture was absolutely divine -- the very definition of 'silky-smooth'! I can't imagine that refined sugar would have given the same result, so the hunt for Demarara was worth it. Having never used it before (or even heard of it, for that matter), I was a little surprised to find that it comes in cubes. Maybe that's just a peculiarity of the brand I bought. The pull tab was located on the *bottom* of the box, which was a little weird, too. :) Since it was too hard to smush easily and I was in a hurry, I guesstimated and used a total of 8 (very small) cubes for the 2 T. called for in the recipe. If anyone else runs into this, the amount seemed to be right. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough cream left over for a topping. A dab of whipped cream would have cut the sweetness nicely and would have looked prettier, too. I'd really recommend that addition.

My favorite comment from one of my guests was "omg this is so good, I could BATHE in it". I'll def be making it again :) I used light muscavado (that's what I had on hand) and raw sugar. Very delish.

This is a very good, comforting dessert. It would be good for fall entertaining because it can be made ahead. It is sweet--the topping of whipped cream helped cut the sweetness. Next time I will add an additional egg yolk as I found it to be just a bit too thin for me. Note: I used light brown sugar in lieu of the demerara sugar, and it was just fine.

Rating: 4
I had never heard of muscovado or demerara before, but found muscovado at a local health food store. I used that and turbinado which is available from your local grocer. The types of sugar you choose to use will definately affect the flavor, but even if you just use regular brown and white sugars, this dish is awesome! The portions were a little small for a sweet tooth like mine. Next time I will double the recipe.

Well kids. I live in a rather rural area and our Eagle's Supermarket just reopened as a Jewel. So, I was walking down the baking aisle and lo and behold, there were the 2 sugars in this recipe. I even clapped my hands! So...I made this the next day. It was delicious. Creamy and subtle after a rather heavy beef stew dinner. Yes, I'll make this again, because what else am I going to do with this sugar!!!!

Yum, said all concerned. I used muscovado and superfine white, not demerara. I also used haf-and-half instead of cream, so as to reduce the probability that we would all have heart attacks then and there. It probably didn't set quite as firmly and probably wasn't quite as creamy as it would have been with heavy cream, but there were no complaints. I added several cut pieces of vanilla bean to the water/sugar mixture while I boiled it, and it imparted nice flavor and those lovely beany nits. Still used the extract as well.

I thought that this recipe was delicious! I did substitute dark brown sugar for the muscovado, but it didn't seem to negatively affect the results. And for the record, I read Blanche's review three times and I still have no idea what she's talking about...

What a delicious recipe, not to mention fast and easy. I found demerara sugar, but not muscavado. I substituted dark brown sugar (packed). The flavor is delicate, and the texture devine. The do-ahead feature make this a great dinner party staple.

This was delicious. For those of you freaking out over a few unusual ingredients, take a Xanax, chill out and go buy Jello Pudding cups instead. Leave the serious cooking to those of us we a sense of adventure and fun and wonderment.

Those wanting to substitute might use dark brown for the muscovado, and light brown for the demerara, to get a similar result. Blanche, could you say that in English? (speaking of pretentious, as someone did earlier......)

I reckon that it's gourmet if those who like to use this vague term want to apply it to the actual dish.Mountains of ingredients and nuances of such delicacy that not even the most gifted tastebuds can detect do not gourmet make. By chance I have some Demerara sugar which must have lost its way to elsewhere andlanded in my supermarket in a small city in Israel. What's more, I've been successful with other pots of things cooked in my microwave oven and this is next on the list.I suspect that Aemrican obesity is the result of a sad chase through jungles of culinary possibilities in the hope of finding gourmet....

What a fuss over sugars, how about a little compromise, experimentation. How do you think recipes cames about.... Living in Mexico there is always a little compromise and sometimes a whole new recipe is discovered.

I haven't tried this yet (though I have made other pot de cremes and loved them). I'm surprised to hear confusion over the different sugars - they're both in our basic grocery store up here. Come visit!

I'm sure as heck not going to send away for two different sugars to get 8 Tbsp of dark brown sugar for one recipe. C'mon, Epicurious, get real. Eight tablespoons of dark brown sugar will have to do....

You can find a great selection of sugars, including those mentioned in this recipe, at Whole Foods Market. If you don't have one near you, try your local health food or culinary store.

Muscovado and demerara are sugars you mainly get in the UK. Because of protectionist policies, they are very difficult to get here. Raw or turbinado sugar is a good substitute for demerara. Our brown sugar would probably do for muscovado, or those brown sugar cones you can get in the super markets here in Denver. Used for Mexican dishes.

Uh...what the heck are muscovado and demerara sugars? I've heard of brown, powdered, confectioners, and raw, but this is kind of advanced for me. And where the heck can you find such sugars anyway? The internet? Sign me confused...I hope one of you gourmet experts can fill me in!

You could just use 8 T. of dark brown sugar instead.
