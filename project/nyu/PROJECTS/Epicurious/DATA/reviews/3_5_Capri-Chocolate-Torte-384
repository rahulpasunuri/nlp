This is my favorite cake, I have been making it for years. It is easy to do and always gets stellar reviews. It can be served plain or dressed... in the summer, I plate it with raspberry sauce, or a sauce of fresh figs, both delightful complements. Today, I am pairing it with home-made ginger ice cream.

I made this for my mom's birthday and everyone loved it! Very easy to make, does not require expensive ingredients. It was even better the next day, very moist. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this for my grandparents, and my grandmother, almost a trained chef, loved it. She ate every crumb off her plate. I used 7 oz semi-sweet and 1 oz unsweetened with an extra tablespoon of sugar in the butter; worked fine. It almost has a brownie texture but so much more sophisticated. Very rich and tender. Make a doily pattern with the powdered sugar on top and you are set.

To the cook from Hoboken, NJ. You add the flour with the walnut in the very beginning of the recipe.

I make this wonderful cake every Christmas. It keeps well over the holidays and is sturdy enough to mail, provided it's sealed up in a tin. One year I even sent one to New Zealand. One caveat: don't forget to add the flour. It's easy to forget, since it's not mentioned in the recipe text.

I made several of these as part of a dessert buffet for an art gallery opening I catered. I did add a simple chocolate glaze in lieu of powdered sugar. Delicious, European style torte -great results - especially in light of ease of preparation.

Delicious cake. Very rich. The chocolate dominates the task and the nuts have a more subtle influence (even though 1.5 cups of nuts seemed like a lot).

I've been making this cake since it first appeared in the magazine and it never fails to please. It's easy to make and can be put together in less than 45 minutes!

It tastes just like the wonderful chocolate-walnut torte I had on Capri. The cake is best when served warm. Easy to make and great for parties!

This is an excellent recipe. A big hit with my dinner club. The tort was incredibly moist! I served it topped with fresh berries which looked great and tasted delicious.

This is as close to an authentic receipe as you can get. When I make it for special occasions, I slap a dallop of Frangelica flavored whipped cream. yum

I have visited Capri many times and I always look forward to eating the wonderful chocolate and lemon tortes served at most restaurants and cafes on the island. I have made this recipe 3 times and it has always turned out great. My friends and family will attest to that! The recipe is time consuming though, so don't plan to make it if you're in a hurry. In my experience, the cake is better served the second day. I think that waiting atleast 12-24 hours allows the flavors to really develop.
