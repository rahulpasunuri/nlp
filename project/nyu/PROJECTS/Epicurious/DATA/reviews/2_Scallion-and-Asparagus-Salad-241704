I found what another viewer said, it was slimy which was my main problem. It was an interesting mixture of ingredients but I do not think I will make this again.

Don't overcook the scallions; otherwise they'll be slimy. Eggs added a nice twist.

Used this recipe as the first course for our Easter family lunch. Family members first played the egg cracking game and then after peeling the egg added it to the salad. I had placed the salad on top of baby spinach and arugula. It was fun and great tasting too. Family members were surprised how we used the easter eggs in the salad!
