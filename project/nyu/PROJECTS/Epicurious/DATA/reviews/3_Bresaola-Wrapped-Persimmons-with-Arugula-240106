Wow, this is my first experience with persimmons and im hooked! I used proscutto as i had some in the fridge and arugula still growing in the garden. A new obsession which will only lead to goodness.

I'm not sure I'm entitled to review this, because I ended up using mango & capacolla, which was what was available. Still it was delicious & fresh-tasting, a nice first step for the meal. Next time I will be more careful to cut long spears of fruit - putting two small ones in there doesn't work - they shoot out the ends when you eat. Provide napkins :)

We loved this disha and I used the bresola, although it was very expensive. I also used mangos.

I made these for a recent dinner party and they were a success! Healthy and delicious. I used aged balsamic, mangoes cut in 1.5 in spears and substituted the bresaola for prosciutto. The combination is fantastic!! This recipe is a keeper!
