I love this recipe I served it with Indian food and it was a great combo. I did not add the mint. My guests loved it and there were no leftovers

This is the BEST recipe I have made from epicurious. It was easy and quick, I made it with stuff I had on hand, and the taste was out of this world. The only change was due to a lack of shallots, so I just sprinkled mint over the yogurt sauce and chicken at the end. Absolutely delicious and it will turn into another easy way to impress guest.

This is so delicious and easy. I made it for a big party and got tons of compliments and requests for the recipe. I've made it many times since and can't believe how flavorful the marinade makes the chicken after just a short time marinating. My kids say it's their favorite chicken (although they skip the salsa on top). One for the recipe box.

Very delicious! I agree with the other reviewers: do not skip the mint and shallot topping. It really completes the dish. I followed the recipe exactly but used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead. We served it on brown rice with grilled red peppers and onions. The chicken was moist and the flavor combinations were perfect. Will be making again and again

Wonderful. Results in delicious, moist chicken. Made for kebabs with bell peppers and onions. Everyone at the BBQ loved it, but I would put half the amount of salt in the marinade. Maybe with Kosher or sea salt 2 tsp is correct, but with fine sea salt I found it to be too much.

My family loves this recipe...the chicken is moist and flavorful...and by itself is very good, but the addition of the yogurt sauce and mint salad brings it from good to exceptional!

This is delicious surprise. I was confused by the final yogurt and mint shallot topping until I tasted and realized it made the dish. Do NOT do away with the last step.

I've made several changes to suit our taste. Actually fused this recipe with "easy chicken masala" recipe on this website because I didn't have the garam masala spice called for. Because I didn't have time to marinate, I used the spices called for in this recipe in one cup of yogurt (nonfat greek style). Omitted the lemon juice and the yogurt sauce, while I added two cloves of garlic and about 1/4 cup of cilantro. I baked the chicken on a bed of 1 inch slices of onions for 1hr at 400 degrees. Result was flavorful, easy recipe, without even the yogurt-y taste for my picky boyfriend who hates yogurt.

Rating: 2
Not the worst but not the best. Tartness of yogurt dressing with the lemon juice was a bit overpowering. Maybe a greek/honey yogurt would be better than plain. Marinade for the chicken was good.

Rating: 4
Super easy and delicious, great spring meal on the grill. We were in a hurry and substituted some of the spices, left our coriander etc. We also didn't have enough plain yogurt for the dressing part at the end but used a Greek/honey variety which worked out really well. Next time I could see consolidating the last two steps (the mint salad and the dressing).

Rating: 4
My goodness - this is delicious. I too incorporated the mint (also the shallots) into the marinade because I misread the recipe, but I think it enhanced the flavour! The cinnamon is a very nice touch to the marinade. I had it with a quinoa salad mixed with asparagus and pinenuts, with a sprinkling of tabasco. Sublime.

This is wonderful! I also use it on pork tenderloin that I slice into 1-2 inch "steaks" that I then simply throw on the grill... quite yummy.

Delicious chicken cutlet variation. I added a little cayenne and more cumin to marinade and omitted coriander which I did not have. Used marinade as "dressing/sauce " for cooked chicken and then topped it with chopped mint leaf "salad."

very close to the nyc halal chicken street cart vendors.i recommend using boneless chicken thighs and cooking in nonstick pan until marinade evaporates and chicken starts to brown and you have a few crispy bits.serve on greek flatbread with lettuce and tomato and top with yogurt sauce[combine mint and shallots with remaining yogurt] and hot to taste.all the taste without the mystery of streetcart sanitation.

We loved this so much that I thought that I would try it on pork tenderloin as well. It was equally if not even better than with chicken. I must admit that I used chicken thighs as well as breasts. A keeper. Every time I make it I get rave reviews and asked for the recipe.

Rating: 3
The chicken came out very moist, I marinated the night before and used breasts and legs with bones. I incorporated the mint into the marinade and added cayenne. For the yogurt sauce I added 2 crushed garlic cloves and cilantro. Used a mixture of 2% greek and nonfat yogurt and it was still very good --and a bit healthier!

Rating: 3
1) The chicken marinade is great, but could be a little spicier. I added some fresh garlic, which helped. I also pounded the chicken breasts slightly to even out the thickness. The chicken came out incredibly moist! 2) I would do away with the yogurt sauce... it didn't seem necessary.

Rating: 4
My family loves this dish. I skip the sauces, though, and throw the mint and shallots straight into the marinade and "grill" breasts for 8-10 minutes per side on the stove top in a heavy bottomed teflon pan. You can also leave the chicken marinating in a ziplock bag in the fridge overnight. Plain drinking yogurt works, too. Cooked chicken is good cold the next day.

Great recipe. Everyone in the family loved it. I have served it to guests as well to great acclaim. I cooked on the outdoor BBQ, and added some of the marinade during cooking, which enhanced it. I also made it with a mixture of yogurt with Penzey's Bankok Blend and fresh lemon juice. Easy and Delish!

Rating: 4
excellent, would make again for family or company -- tasty and aromatic -- I sliced chicken breasts long ways prior to marinating so that more of the surface area would be coated and to minimize grilling time (and thereby lower the risk of burning the surface of the chicken while the interior cooked through); added shallots and dried mint (fresh was unavailable) directly to the yogurt sauce; served with sliced cucumbers (tasty to put some of the yogurt sauce on them) and side dishes of Indian spinach and rice. Worth trying!

This sauce is great with chicken, but works even better on a white fish fillet like basa or tilapia. The yogurt sauce isn't great on it's own, but brings a subtle yet spicy flavour to the chicken/fish. I broiled it in my oven, but look forward to grilling it this summer.

Made this exactly as directed except I strained the yogurt to remove liquid. This made a wonderful thick sauce that stuck to the chicken as it grilled. Also used mesquite chips on the charcoal grill. Delicious! Kids loved it too.

Wow, this exceeded my expectations. I grilled the chicken on my new indoor grill and was a bit apprehensive about the outcome. Both the grill and the chicken came out with flying colors. This dish could not be easier and is really tasty. The chicken turned out very moist and flavorful. I added the chopped mint and shallots to the yogurt sauce rather than serving them over the top. Served it with quinoa and steamed spinach. Mixed some of the yogurt sauce into the quinoa -- delicious.

I made this for my husband (halved the recipe) and we loved it!! I added cayenne pepper to the spice mix and it turned out delicious. I sprinkled the mint over the grilled chicken, and added onion (instead of shallot), some minced garlic, and diced cucumber to the yogurt sauce and it was excellent. I can't wait to make this again!

Rating: 3
Great, and easy--especially if you don't have to make an emergency run to the store for plain yogurt, having confused it for the vanilla in your fridge. I followed the recipe for marinade as it was, but next time I'd give it a shot of cayenne, and maybe go a bit heavier on the spices. I served this with couscous and grilled veggies and it was wonderful. Instead of making a yogurt sauce and mint salad, I took my inspiration from Greek tzatziki sauce. I squeezed lemon into the yogurt and added finely chopped mint, onion, salt, pepper, and a shake or two of the spices from the marinade. Juicy chicken, awesome sauce. Yum.

This is so quick, easy and delicious. I made it last night for dinner, and had leftovers cold today on a salad. I think marinating chicken breasts in yogurt is the best way to ensure they don't dry out while cooking. I did not serve this with the mint salad, but have in the past. Either way it's a sure bet.

Rating: 4
A great tasting, easy recipe for chicken that takes very little time. I've made it three times now and each time it's gotten rave reviews. I tried the mint salad, but it wasn't that great. Instead, I prefer to add a little mint to the yogurt sauce you put on top of the chicken. Also, make sure that you cook this on a regular BBQ and not on something like a George Foreman. The George Foreman-like grills cook with a lot of steam, causing the yogurt marinade to fall off of the chicken instead of baking into it.

Rating: 4
This is an absolutely delicious dish! Subtle, but well blended, flavors. Don't skip the mint salad! It provides a fresh taste that is a contrast to the more southwest flavors in the marinade. The only change that I made was to marinate the chicken for about an hour (in the refrigerator), rather than just the 20 minutes at room temperature. This one could definitely be served to company due to the layers of flavor. Excellent!

I made this with a group of friends last night and we all loved it. We skipped the mint salad and just added the mint and shallots directly into the yogurt sauce.

As amended, this is a wonderful weeknight favorite: Saute it in a skillet instead of grilling, omit the mint salad and serve it instead over a bed of couscous flavored with a bit of this recipe's spice blend. Thin a good yogurt with a bit of lemon juice and drizzle it generously over the chicken and couscous. As a side, serve the the filling from the Moroccan Garbanzo Bean and Feta Pita Recipe (also outstanding) on this website.

I was unsure of the sauce flavor when putting this dish together. But when we tasted it....delicious! Very easy to prepare. This one is definately a keeper. I made the dish as the recipe states but used an iron pan with ridges, it is winter here and too cold to grill outdoors

Excellent Dish! My husband and I really enjoyed the chicken. I brought the left overs in to work the next day and all the young men came around looking for the source of the great aroma. The spices really make this exciting and the mint ties it together. I would use half as much salt and half as much chili powder. Since I don't t have a grill I put it in a curved stove top pan, covered it and let it simmer. I suppose it could also work in baking pan in the oven. There are many versions of this recipe that I'm looking forward to trying.

Rating: 4
What a fabulous recipe. So easy to make, and my husband loved it. We've had it several times since I first made it a couple of months ago. The only modification I made was, since there seemed to be more than enough yogurt for the marinade, only using about one-half to one-third of it for that purpose and saving the rest to throw on afterward as a sauce. (Obviously, separate the before and after sauce batches BEFORE you contaminate it with raw chicken.)

Made this last week. As a FT working mother of two, it is difficult to make delicious AND simple meals. This fits my needs perfectly! Used Greek 2% yogurt. Skipped the mint/shallot salad as had no mint and no time. Served with yogurt/lemon mixture. Chicken is great by itself. Grilling is a must. Husband loved it!

This dish is soooo damn good. I just made it tonight and my husband ( 3hrs. later) has not shut up about it... I think I'll be making it again. I made kabobs and added onions to them & accompanied the dish with almond pilaf and toasted pita bread. Good enough for company I'd say. Might use this dish for a BBQ and try the same recipe with lamb kabobs along side the chicken. Yum.

Made it last night, and I would give it three plus forks. We will definitely make this again -- very tender, flavorful. Smelled great while it was cooking, too. I served it with cous cous and roasted veggies (as others had suggested). I spiced the yogurt to use on top as well. Delicious. Am looking very forward to the leftovers. Also, I used low fat yogurt, and I think that worked well if you're looking to save a few calories.

Rating: 3
Very good prepared just as stated. I only had split chicken breasts with the bone in, and I know the overall flavor was less intense than desired because the breasts had to cook longer than a boneless piece. I used a wonderful authentic greek yogurt (at our local Trader Joes) which is certainly not the low-fat kind I'm used to eating! I think this choice is perfect for the topping but you might want to thin the topping just a bit with more lemon juice. A keeper.

This recipe had everything I was looking for on the night. I needed something quick to prepare (after our after-work shift helping at an animal shelter...too tired to cook, really...) and something with loads of flavor and low in fat. It was absolutely delicious! My husband didn't speak during the entire meal, and neither one of us touched our wine while we ate...it was just too good. I only made two chicken breasts, but would make more next time so we could revisit this at lunch the next day. The mint and shallot topping was brilliant with the lemon-yogurt sauce. The one thing I would do is increase the spice in the marinade (or maybe I just need to refresh my supply, some of my spice jars are a little elderly.) This one is a keeper!

This was a great recipe. Very easy, incredibly flavorful. I agree with the person who said it was too much yoghurt. I messed up and mixed all of the ingredients with all of the yoghurt, so I then just pulled out the amount indicated to spoon on afterwards. I marinated 8 chicken breasts in plenty of sauce, and still have probably 3/4 cup of the non-marinade sauce left, after eating all of the chicken! I also served this with white rice and a salad. It was wonderful. Also, I don't know why the recipe specifies to use full fat yogurt. I used lowfat and it was fine. I intend to try it with nonfat as well to make it a super healthy meal.

Made this recipe using turkey cutlets instead of chicken, and dried mint instead of fresh. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Very unusual and interesting. My husband absolutely loved it. I don't think turkey is a good option in this recipe, however.....without the sauce it wasn't all that tasty. It was much better with the sauce, and the mint/shallot topping was a must! Next time I will make this with chicken and put garlic in the marinade as everyone else seems to recommend.

Excellent and different chicken recipe! I added some fresh minced garlic to the mint salad along with the minced shallot as didn't have enough shallot on hand. My husband was very leery when he saw the ingredients I was using, but absolutely loved it. I also tend to be heavy-handed when adding spices as we both like spice. This is our new favorite grilled chicken recipe!

Rating: 3
A very good recipe, especially with the garlic added. And couscous goes with it nicely, providing a mellow vehicle for sauce and mint salad. If your eaters don't mind (mine only tolerate this), adding almonds or pine nuts and chopped raisins, apples, or dried apricots to the couscous will make an even more interesting foil for the chicken. Incidentally, yogurt is a great tenderizer -- stronger than lemon -- but as such will break down meats over time. Try to marinate chicken in yogurt for no more than an hour, when making this or other similar recipes.

Rating: 2
Neither my husband nor I are lovers of overly spicy food, but this one was not spicy at all - barely even tasty. The spices were barely detectable. The mint and shallot topping was really good, though. I skipped adding the yogurt as a topping. I added fresh garlic to the marinade, as per other reviewers suggestions. We were too busy to grill this dinner the night I marinated it; so it sat in the refrigerator until the next night. The overnight marinade was detrimental to the chicken. It unfavorably changed the texture a bit. I can't describe it. If possible, only marinate for 20 minutes as per the recipe to avoid this chemistry. Part of the problem could be the amount of marinade touching my chicken. I made a whole recipe of the marinade, but only used two chicken breasts. My chicken was drowning in marinade. Maybe that is why the marinade adversely affected the texture of the chicken. But I really think it was the length of time - overnight is too long.

I gave this 4 forks in the quick meal category- it is a simple, delicious, healthy weeknight meal. I did not add garlic, nor did I mix the yoghurt into the sauce.

This was an excellent recipe, the mint and yogurt sauce make for a very refreshing summer meal. I thought the strong flavor of the mint overwhelmed the spices in the marinade, so next time I will add more spices, and also add a bit of garlic, as others have suggested.

I'm not a big chicken fan but I loved this. Chicken was so moist and flavorful. Like others, I'd even make it for company but I love that it's easy enough to make after working all day.

I thought this was very good and I'll make this again. It was quick for a weekday dinner and I made it with the roasted pepper with bacon dressing salad recipe that Epicurious sent in my mailbox this week - an excellent combo, colorwise and tastewise. I did what another reviewer suggested and used 1/2 mint and 1/2 cilantro, I also had a little mache lettuce leftover and added that to the salad. Very healthy - I was out of both coriander and chili powder so I used some of Emeril's essence and a little taco seasoning instead of the dry spices suggested.

I thought this was just OK. I did add garlic to both the chicken marinade and to the yogurt sauce for a little more zip. The chicken was good, I liked the yogurt sauce - not wild about the mint salad. Might have been better to just mix the mint salad into the yougurt sauce (?).

Pretty good, but nothing special. With all the great chicken recipies on Epicurious, probably wouldn't make this one again. The type and hotness of the chili powder used will greatly affect the outcome, so be careful if you don't care for spicy (which we do).

This is very nice, but served over "gujerati green beans" takes it to a whole new level. I added a little more chili powder and made more sauce. It was excellent for a mid-week dinner.

I reduced the amount of olive oil, and used fat free plain yogurt. My husband suggested substituting cilantro for mint. I'm sure it would work well with the spiced yogurt flavors. This is a delicious grilled chicken recipe, nice enough for company.

I enjoyed this recipe very much but I do have a complaint on trying to print same WITHOUT the Eddie Bauer advertisement. Very annoying.

This chicken is moist, yummy and interesting. I chopped the shallots and mint & added them to the yogurt sauce instead of making them a salad. Thought my husband would try it but no go. He absolutely loved the chicken and wanted more marinade to dip in. Next time.

Absolutely fantastic dish. I sliced the chicken breasts after they came off the BBQ, and placed them on top of a bed of brown rice, and then drizzled the yogurt sauce, and topped with the mint salad. I also took some additional chopped mint and spread it on top of the dish for a beautiful presentation.

This marinade is a good basic and unique. I didn't think the side yogurt sauce and mint added much but still like the idea, so next time I'll just add 1/2 cup of mint and one tablespoon of minced shallots to the marinade. I also had used lowfat yogurt to save on fat grams but next time will use whole milk. You discard the marinade so it really doesn't make much of a caloric difference in my mind.

Another great recipe from Gourmet magazine, 2004 Summer issue! My family also enjoyed the sea scallops with corn coulis and tomatoes from the same issue.

yumyumYUM! made this last night - GREAT way to use up some runaway mint from the garden! I thought the marinade was a tad too salty, so next time I'll reduce by half and marinade longer beause the taste was just SO GOOD! Next time, I'll also add 3 or 4 cloves of garlic to the marinade (cuz everything's better with garlic!)

It was wonderful. Quick and easy to make and a great way to dress up chicken.

This was delicious and the presentation was lovely with the mint salad on top. I added a bit more lemon juice to the marinade and marinated the chicken overnight in a plastic bag. It turned out so juicy and tender. The mint salad is a must -- I added fresh cilantro to the salad and also put in a squeeze of lemon with the olive oil. I drizzled some sauce on the chicken for presentation, then put the rest in a bowl to pass. My mother-in-law (who is a great cook) asked for the recipe. Very easy and really tasty -- I will definitely make this again!

Another way to print only the recipe is to click on printer ready, then go to print preview (under file on the tool bar) and determine on which page the recipe is located, then ask the printer to print only that page.

Jim -- I always copy the recipes into Word, as you suggested. I hate to waste paper, plus who wants to deal with a 2-page recipe!!

In my haste to get the marinade together, I combined ALL of the ingreds, up to the chicken, adding about 1/2-1 tsp garlic powder & using lo fat yogurt (about 1 1/2 cups) and 1/2(+/-)sour cream. I used Penzey's Med hot chili powder, but you could use regualr & add cayenne to taste. I used a 4 1/2 lb whole chicken, cut into 1/8's & then butchered (and I MEAN it, LOL) into 1/16ths. I marinated them, all day in the fridge... rotating top to bottom a few times. Then I grilled.... Yum, Yum!!!! I didn't bother with the sauce... it really wasn't needed, so my error turned into a good thing... I never would have had enough marinade for all my chicken the other way... Anyway... try it.... you'll love it!

I loved the idea and adapted to it. Yoghurt, cayenne, curry, cumin... marinated chicken for an hour. Cooked in a pan on the stove top, low, for and hour. Wow! was it good. The flavour of the yoghurt and curry? Fabulous! Thanks for the idea. I will try it again a little closer to the original... on the grill, with mint? Mmmmmm.

Since Epicurious WONT design the pages to print on 1 page (they always slop over onto 1.3 pages or so, I suggest you copy and paste onto Word. There it easily printed on 1 page

WOW! I got this as a recipe flash email from epicurious. I had to make it the same day I got it because it sounded so good. It turned out to be one of the finest recipes I have ever made. I was also impressed by the mint, I didnt think it would be all that great, but to my surprise it puts the finishing touch on this dish.

Has anybody tried to make this with non-dairy yogurt, (such as soy yogurt)

This is healthy, incredibly simple and delicious! I marinated it for about 40 minutes so the spicy flavor really permeated the chicken. I doubled the sauce and serve it with brown rice. This is a keeper. I'll be mixing the spices in a ziplock bag and bringing it to the ski house this winter for an easy post-ski dinner.

Absolutely delicious and so easy! Definitely dinner party worthy.

This was fabulous! I adjusted a few things as I always do, fresh cilantro instead of coriander and garlic in the yogurts. Will most definitely make again. Greek full fat yogurt is a must. YUM!!!
