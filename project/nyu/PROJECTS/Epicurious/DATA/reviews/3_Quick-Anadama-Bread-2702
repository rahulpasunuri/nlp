I was surprised that I didn't like this as much as I had expected. I made this variation after trying a similar one from Mark Bittman in the New York Times. This recipe is different in that it adds an egg, baking powder (instead of soda), and less molassas. The texture was coarse - normal for quick bread. But the flavor wasn't great. Bittman used more molassas and less flour, and that bread is naturally darker, but it had a good flavor. This one tasted a bit off.

This has authentic anadama flavor without the work, time or texture of yeast bread. I omitted the poppy seeds. This is great for any meal.

It was very easy to make. The bread was a little bit too coarse. I thought it wasn't so special, but my husband really liked it. So I'll make it again.

This was so easy and quick that I was very sceptical! However, it was really excellent!It doesn't have quite the texture that I remember from New England, but an outstanding bread!I look forward to serving it with homemade soup this winter.
