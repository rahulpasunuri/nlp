Good recipe, although a little heavy on the leeks, the flavor came through in the first batch I made. Definitely use the tomato paste and *never* at salt! Yikes! Stocks should never, ever be salted. When they reduce, that's all you'll taste and the sauces you make with them will be ruined.

There are many recipes for veal stock if you Google it and they're all basically similar to this one. You want bones with lots of marrow in them and basically roast then simmer that gelatinous goodness out into the stock. I deglaze the pan with red wine, usually a Cab, instead of water. Make sure you don't burn the bones when roasting! Your stock will be bitter. Same with the deglazing bits. Give it a taste before you dump it in, discard it if it's bitter. Don't skip the tomato paste, this is a "brown" veal stock. Veal stock (along with homemade chicken stock) brings such versatility to the kitchen that it's well worth the effort. Freezing in ice cube trays is essential, then you always have what increment you need on hand. I call them my "flavor cubes" and my freezer is never without them. A little of this stuff can go a long way.

Good recipe. You should not skip the tomato paste, it is in every traditional beef stock and demi glace recipe. Skipping it effects the color,texture and taste. It is needed, or you will have a very bland product.

Yes, it's rather a lot of trouble, but well worth it. I always make extra and freeze it in small batches. A little bit of this stuff can add a great deal of depth to all sorts of dishes--soups,sauces, braised winter greens, you name it. Skip the tomato paste, and be prepared for smoke when you brown the bones.

I made this recipe twice. It turns out better with about a TB or more of salt, adding the bouquet garni (parsley, bay, thyme) after about the first hour, and raising the temp to a true simmer. The 190 didn't work out at all (I used a thermometer to insure) but it barely reduced. Wasted hours at 190. My advice: raise temp and season! Skip the tomato paste.

Made this stock while we were still in Bettendorf Iowa. Veal is not usually found in markets here and it was a challenge to come up with the basic ingredient. I visited a meat market, another rarity today, and asked if they had any veal bones. The young lady said they had no veal, this is about as deep in pork country as one can get, but she did have some veal soup bones in the freezer. I purchase 10 pounds, three knuckles, and hoped they had enough meat on them to make my stock. To my surprise they were loaded with meat and the stock is one of the best I have ever tasted. Will make again when, but not sure I will find "veal soup bones" like this ever again.

Thank you Michael - it was a great recipe - long but worth it. I had to use breast of veal which worked very well and is relatively inexpensive. I would definetly make it again - could get hooked on the idea!

This recipe produced a wonderfully rich, thick, and fragrant stock. The greatest challenge, here in Nashville, was finding veal bones, which had to be special ordered. What arrived were all knuckles and shanks pieces, which resulted in a high gellatin content. They were also fairly meatless, so next time, I think I will purchase a little extra veal to augment the recipe. The final test will be in its use in other recipes. We shall see. Cheers
