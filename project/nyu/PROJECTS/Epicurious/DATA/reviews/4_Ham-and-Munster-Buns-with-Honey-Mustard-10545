Great taste combination, none left of the plate! I ran out of time preparing for my brunch, so I wound up just serving the honey mustard on mini bagels topped with the ham and the munster and then just toasted lightly under the broiler. Hoping to try it as buns soon!

I cheat and use refrigerated pizza dough... mmmm...

Made these for a picnic, thinking I'd have leftovers for lunch tomorrow...no such luck! But, I guess, there's no better compliment than nothing but crumbs left in the dish. The picnic peeps all loved these and the flavors melded together really nicely. Just three forks purely because I'm impatient about leaving dough to rise, although it was well worth it. I substituted smoked gouda and port salut cheese with some finely chopped Canadian bacon. The rolls were delicious hot and cold, and would make a great quick brunch/supper roll.

I make these all of the time (by request). They are so easy to do I can employ the help of my two little assistants, whom love to cook. Because I actually started getting bored (I've made them a lot) I created some variations. Try: grated swiss with turkey, chopped fresh basil with mozzarella, pastrami with grated cheddar and sauerkraut (yes sauerkraut... drain it VERY well), blue cheese and black forest ham.

I also have been making these for 10 years. They are great and if do not have much time you can use hot roll mix. They are even better with capicollo ham (spicy Italian ham) and cheddar.

These buns were delicious but I did have some trouble with the cheese. It leaked out of the bottom of the bun and made it difficult to get them out of the muffin tins. Did anyone else have this problem? Next time I may put some of the dough aside to use it to "seal" the bottom of the buns. I'll let you know if it works!

My Father-in-law makes these every Thanksgiving, truly a recipe traditions are born of. I made these for a party and everyone wants to know the secret!

I served this at my self-catered beach wedding. Our guests loved it and many asked for the recipe. I substituted smoked turkey for the ham. (Use a drier turkey or roast it in the oven to remove excess moisture.) Cooking spray worked well. They also freeze very well.

I have been making these buns for 10 years--ever since the recipe first appeared. Excellent!

Very tasty and easy to substitute ingredients. I used chopped left-over ham and course ground mustard with great results. Chutney not necessary.

Delicious! Great with tomato soup.
