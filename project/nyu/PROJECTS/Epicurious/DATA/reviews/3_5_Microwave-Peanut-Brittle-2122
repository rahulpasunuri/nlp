Great peanut brittle. Does not last very long. Had some difficulty spreading it out thinly on cokie sheet because itsets up so fast. Any way to thin it to give more woorking/spreading tiome?

First batch I burned the nuts using 6 minutes the first time and 6 minutes at high (1250 Watts). So second batch I turned it down 30% (900 Watts), did the first run for 5 minutes without the peanuts, added the nuts, butter and vanilla then cooked for 6 more minutes. Came out chewy! Then I found out you can correct it later by putting it back in the microwave in chunks on parchment paper in a microwavable pan for a minute to re-bubble. It thinned out and browned up great with just a hint of chew. Takes a few trys to figure out your microwave strength. Tastes just as good as stovetop, fast and fun too.

Made this tonight for the first time, and I think it's delish! I have a 900w microwave. First, I blended together the sugar, corn syrup, and salt and microwaved on HIGH for 4 minutes. Then, stirred in the peanuts and microwaved 2 min more. Stirred in the butter and vanilla, and microwaved for 5 minutes more - until tan in color and instant-read thermometer registered 300 degrees. Added baking soda, and poured on buttered cookie sheet. The only thing I will do differently next time is cut back on the baking soda - but that's just a personal preference. I prefer my peanut brittle less opaque. But the flavor is excellent! (P-s-s-s-t! If you stick it in the fridge after you've poured it on the cookie sheet, it will be ready-to-nibble in 30 minutes!!)

This didn't work for me; it didn't get brittle & was sticky. But I'm not rating b/c I didn't follow directions exactly. (I did the first microwave on hi for only 3.5 min. in a 1400W oven; it was bubbling vigorously IMO.) The peanuts had a nice flavor & I don't think I could have cooked them much longer. I probably won't try this again; I think stovetop is the way to go.

YUMMY, QUICK and EASY! This brittle is excellent, however I too have adjusted the cooking times, to 3-1/2 minutes on the first go, and 3 on the second. Less burnt peanuts that way. My husband's coworkers have requested this over and over. Love it.

Mostly this recipe is good because it is easy and fast. I needed peanut brittle for an ice cream pie recipe so the quick factor was key. I have to say it s a little unidimentional and I like the deeper flavor of old fashioned peanut brittle that you sweat over on the stove a lot better.

I must depend on an old, unreliable oven, and can't bake, so was thrilled to discover this terrific and easy microwave recipe. I reduced the times to 2.5 min./ 3.5 min. for my new microwave, and used cashews. Also added 1/2 tsp. hot chili powder which was great.

Be very careful with microwave settings! Three minutes on high in our new microwave melted our microwave safe container and boiled over, making a huge mess. Everything went to waste. However, our friend has made it and when prepared, it is very tasty.

Exceptionally easy. Started at 10:00pm-finished 2 batches by 11:00pm-included cooling time. I used lightly salted peanuts and omitted the pinch of salt. Greased both pans generously with butter, one pan heated, the other room temperature. Didn't make a bit of difference with spreading the mixture. Terribly easy and very tasty. Clean up is a sinch-soak in hot water, detergent and rinse-simple! Why bother with the old fashion recipe when this one is just as good. For those of you trying to do everything this holiday season, this recipe simplifies at least one thing. Enjoy!

We make this every year for Christmas now. So easy and delicious I share the recipe whenever I can.

I made this with lightly toasted pecans, almonds and cashews--the brittle has great flavour and easily stands up to more time-consuming recipes on the site. I would stir the sugar mixture halfway through as it wasn't all dissolved after the six minutes; also it was quite sticky the next day but that may just be because it's so damp here.

My grandmother taught me how to make microwave brittle years ago. This recipe is very similar to hers except that instead of microwaving in chunks, like they do here, she microwaved for a minute or two after the addition of each ingredient. This one is easier but I still use one of her hints - use a wooden spoon. That way, you can leave it in the brittle while you microwave the candy and not have to look everywhere for a place to put a sticky, messy spoon. I love and miss my grandma every single day. I love making this and thinking of her.

This came out great (we also made a batch with cashews)... I cooked it for 4 min. then for an additional 1 min. 40 sec., instead of the times listed due to a new microwave. I think if you over-cook the color in the center of the brittle starts to look like a Butterfinger (but still tastes good).

Based on the other reviews here I used this recipe instead of the old-fashioned recipe also on this site, and wow! Incredibly easy, and the peanut brittle is fabulous, crisp and buttery. Even got rave reviews from my BF, who's not a peanut brittle fan. I've already made several batches to give as Christmas gifts!

I couldn't find my microwave recipe that I have used for years so I decided to try this one. It rocks! I made it with walnuts and it's even better.

I tried it in my 1000W microwave first, what a burnt disaster. The brittle was fine but the peanuts were little blackened scorchballs. Then i tried cutting the power to 700W but it was really chewy and soft. Maybe I would keep the 1000W timing and add the peanuts before the 2nd warming phase, but I think I will look elsewhere :(

I gave this version 3 forks, but my version 4 based on my husband's reaction. He is a peanut brittle nut,(no pun intended) and also loves spicy. With the butter and vanilla, I also added a tsp. of XXX Habanero chili sauce. What a wonderful combo of flavors! Not only did he rave, because of the spice, he eats it slower and will enjoy it longer!

l can't believe how easy this was! l hate doing candy because you always have to watch it so closely but this was practically fool-proof. l didn't have corn syrup on hand so substituted honey and it came out PERFECT! l also substituted margarine for the butter and it was no problem at all! The texture and flavour are both wonderful - and it's a rich golden colour. So yummy! l will definitely do this one again.

I made this recipe for my 72 year old father, who was craving peanut brittle and couldn't find it in the stores (guess it's out of style). I was very pleased at how it came out, given that it's an extremely simple recipe and takes no more than 15 minutes to throw together. Nice crunch, not sticky, and very peanutty. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of prepping the cookie sheet; I prewarmed it and lined it with buttered parchment, and it worked great. Very easy cleanup too. I will definitely make this again...in fact, I already did. Couldn't send that first batch out to Dad without making one for my family, now could I?

I made both the traditional stove-top peanut brittle and this recipe, to see if there was any difference. I couldn't tell a difference in taste or appearance, and neither could my co-workers. But it is a big difference in the time spent in the kitchen. If you've got better than an hour to fritter away, use the stove-top method. If you've got things to do and want a great tasting candy, use this recipe. My microwave oven is 700 watts, and the cook times in the recipe are perfect for my oven. I also tried the 5 and 2.5 minutes that other cooks suggested, and ended up with brittle that stuck to the teeth something awful (still tasted OK).

definitely a delicious snack that is easy and quick. great for festivities and is a big hit with children and adults. friends usually ask me for its recipe after tasting it.

I am a truly novice cook, and I tend to destroy perfectly good recipe components in my bumbling kitchen efforts, but I found this recipe to be almost foolproof, as well as delicious. This recipe is the best of several highly recommended peanut brittle recipes I've tried.

I've made this for the last 3 years at X-MAS time to give as gifts! Everyone loves it... Simple & foolproof to make. Use 1 can of any nuts-cashews or mixed is a nice change from peanuts. Just remember to work quickly when spreading onto cookie sheet. Enjoy!

This was a very easy and I must say some of the best brittle I have made. I made this recipe twice and changed the microwave times slightly, but it made a big difference in appearance, but not in the quality of the taste. First recipe I microwaved as per the recipe, the second batch I microwaved as per a previous review 5 minutes and 2.5 minutes, this made the brittle look more creamy in texture. Remember to use heat resistant utensils and the pyrex bowl as suggested by another review was great!

I had trouble with this recipe. It never got "brittle" enough. It was crunchy on the first bite, but too chewy after that. I made a second batch and cooked it a bit longer but the texture was still too chewy. It was delicious, but you spent more time picking it out of your teeth than eating it. I will stick to the stovetop method.

This is an excellent recipe! Easy to make and almost fool-proof. I made it for my cafeteria special and everyone (including myself) loved it. One thing though is that you really have to be careful with the butter as it burns easily (esp when compared with margarine).

Rating: 4
This is practically effortless and is extremely delicious. I have made this three times and each time someone has said that it is the best peanut brittle they have ever eaten. A little tip: use a 8 cup Pyrex measuring cup instead of a bowl--the handle makes it easier to get the hot mixture onto the cookie sheet quickly.

I took this to a gathering and it was the first dish to vanish, many of the gourmets there insisted on the recipe. My brittle is now invited out more than I am! Love the stuff, great with cashews, pecans do not work as well. Easy to make and impressive too.

This stuff is awful. It lacks the texture and consistency of traditional brittle. I'll stick w/ the over the oven method.

Excellent and easy! A favorite many times a year! I microwave 5 minutes and then 2-1/2.

This is a great recipe for a quick holiday treat or gift. As others added, the mixture gets very hot in the microwave so you should be very careful when removing it. Also, once you get to adding the baking soda, be sure to mix it thoroughly before pouring it into a baking sheet. It took 10 minutes to make and is really good. I'll make it again.

Some sleep-over teenage girls made this brittle and enjoyed it very much. Not for children because it gets too hot, but with adult help, even little ones will want more. Reminds me of the brittle my mother use to make at Christmas.

Thanks for an old favorite that I remember making as a child (which in no way negates the other reviewer's advice - too hot and risky for children). Made with cashews too - delicious!

This was an old recipe published in the 60's in one of the magazines. I made the candy frequently, always at Christmas. Unfortunately, in the course of many moves, the recipe was misplaced. I was delighted to find the recipe because it is positively the easiest way possible to make delicious peanut brittle. Be careful, though, the candy syrup gets very hot! This is not a recipe for children.
