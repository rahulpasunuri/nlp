This recipe is wonderful, and my whole family loved the results. Using fresh fruit is a great alternative to the syrupy sweet and sour sauce you'd get at a chinese restraunt. Next time I'm going to cut the fruit into shorter strips, say 1 inch or so. I found that the long strips were hard to pick up and eat, and nearly impossible to cut with just a fork after they've been cooked for a minute. Also, the pork strips definitely need to be cut short and thin.

I've cooked at least fifty recipes from this site, maybe 100, and this is the first where I threw away the food without serving it. The pork should be cut in THIN strips, not long strips. Long strips, even moderately thin long strips, end up not cooking all the way through. The citrus really didn't work, giving it a sour taste. Very unrecommended.
