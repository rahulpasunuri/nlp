Loved the flavor, especially the next day, warmed up! The changes I made are as follows: increase crushed tomoatoes to 42 oz and next time I will up it to using both 28 oz cans, making it 48oz, as it was a tad dry; decreased the olive oil to 1/8C, and perhaps that's why it was somewhat dry; substituted about 4C of FRESH spinach, de-stemmed and sliced up; added 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper to the tomatoes as they cooked. The mozzarella was low-fat, low moisture.

My vegetarian son loved this, but the other reviewers were right: add flavour. I added pesto, and pepper flakes and red peppers, but found it was missing something. I would actually double (or increase) the sauce next time, I think that would help. However I think the ovreall recipe is not bad, and will try to modify it and make it again.

I'm ten minutes away from trying this dish for the first time--it's in the "set" phase. I hope it's good--I wasn't sure when to add the tofu "ricotta" mixture, as per the directions. After I already had all of the ingredients in the dish and the cheese sprinkled on top, I realized that I hadn't used the tofu ricotta. After looking at the picture again, I figured it probably should have been folded in like the other ingredients. But, too late for that. So I just spread it on top. Oiy. If I did indeed make a mistake, which seems clear to me, can epicurious please make the directions clearer? Thanks!

Hearty and freeze-able, and a great way to sneak tofu to unsuspecting family! I added lots of hot pepper flakes, basil & oregano. Also sauteed zucchini into the onion mix, and a 1/2 pepper since I didn't have much spinach on hand. Only used 2-3 cups mozzarella in the end, was plenty.

If I wouldn't have doctored this up as others suggested it would have been a waste of time; but I did - and it turned out tasty and healthy. Changes I made: more vegis (I added sauteed zucchini, red pepper, mushrooms and 16oz spinach). I added red pepper flakes and additional herbs. I added extra tomato sauce to the crushed tomato sauce. I also put some tomato sauce on top of the pasta, under the cheese. My favorite part of this recipe is the use of tofu in place of ricotta. It works really well. I may try the tofu/egg blend to make a healthy lasagna.

I used this as a base for a tofu casserole. Based on previous reviews, I went in knowing it would need more flavor. I added olives and capers to the mix -- and used fresh spinach I chopped -- which created nice, thin ribbons in the casserole. For spice, I used a pinch of clove and rosemary -- next time I'll skip the onion, tomato, garlic step.... when I didn't have enough tomatos I simply sub'ed my fav tomato sauce, and it worked out perfectly.

Blah! This is super bland, it looked better before it went in the oven. It needs something more, maybe some fresh basil and some spicy sausage or something to give it a kick.

A simple, large dish that was tasty. Feels like a vegetarian lasagna that is pretty easy to make. I omitted the mozzarella cheese, grated a small amount of spicy cheddar on top, and it was still very good. I also did not have rigatoni and used whole wheat spirals instead. Next time I would add some red pepper flakes before baking for some spice.

This'un's a keeper! The first part should be: preheat the oven, then onions, at the same time get the pasta water going, then you're golden. Not gourmand, but real easy, real tasty. Go for it.
