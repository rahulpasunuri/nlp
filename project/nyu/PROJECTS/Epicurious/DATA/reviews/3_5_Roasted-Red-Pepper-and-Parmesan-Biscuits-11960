I love these biscuits! They are great with a roaster red pepper soup. Sometimes I use cheddar instead of parmesan, and they've always turned out great.

Quick, Easy & Delicious! I followed the advice of one of the reviews and added a bit of dried basil.

These biscuits were really good. The more red peppers, the better! I also put in extra cayenne pepper to make them spicier.

Very good but... I added basil, asagio cheese and rosted fresh red peppers. The basil complements the cheese and peppers wonderfully. Nice crumb

These are simply delicious. I;ve made them several times and they are always a hit. Wouldn't change a thing!

Served this with Roasted Tomato Soup and it was beautiful and a great compliment to the soup. Have passed this along to friends. Very easy.

Quick and easy to make; even my 4-year-old loved the "sweet red peppers".

These biscuits were pretty good. Not the best. When they cool to room temperature, they taste like those little goldfish.

They were quite tasty...very cheesy. I'd add more pepper the next time I make these!
