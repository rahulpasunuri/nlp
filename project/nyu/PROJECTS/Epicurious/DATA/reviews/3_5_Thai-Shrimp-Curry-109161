This was absolutly amazing! I've never made curry before-super easy! I only had yellow curry you could probably use red curry paste as well.

I love this dish and order it at our local Thai place all the time. This recipe was easy to make and I loved the flavor but it was not hot enough. First, I made half the recipe and for 2 people, there was still a ton left over. Second, I used thinly sliced red onion in place of regular and I used thinly sliced red bell pepper in place of tomatoes as did others. I also threw in water chestnuts which gave it a great texture. I used brown sugar instead of white and I used the whole can of coconut milk even though I halved the rest of the recipe. I served this over rice and as I stated, the flavor was great but it lacked spice. I would add some chilies to spice this up. I used 2 tablespoons of green curry paste and it just was not hot. Will definitely make again!

This is by far, one of my favorite dishes. Instead of chicken broth, I boil the shrimp shells for shrimp broth - give extra to the cats. I also added a red pepper and used Agave instead of sugar. Fantastic. If you think this is bland or doesn't taste good, you did something wrong. lol

Wow. So so delishious. I went with what some people suggested and added red peppers and I threw in some orange peppers instead of the tomato. I also added a yellow squash since I had one on hand and wanted to incorporate more veggies. Probably not as authentic as the recipe but I love veggies. I also used red curry paste and I'll try it again with green. Maybe I'll throw in some tamarind too. You can't mess it up. Make sure not to over cook the shrimp.

Really great sauce, however I would replace the tomatoes with red bell peppers.

Made a few changes. Of course. Didn't use tomatoes -- water chesnuts instead. And basil rather than cilantro. Made my own curry paste from a different website. Overall, this was a little too salty (I don't usually use as much salt as a recipe calls for but used the full 3 T of fish sauce here) but still really good.

I've made this recipe numerous times and what I have discovered is that the Green Curry Paste varies in heat from jar to jar and brand to brand. So, I would taste the paste to determine it's level of heat before using. Also, personally I wouldn't load this dish with all the vegetables you typically put in Chinese stir-fry. This is a Thai dish. The most I would put it in is thinly sliced red bell pepper, and perhaps a handful of snow peas.

Rating: 4
This is my base recipe for any Thai curry. The recipe is easy to follow and very easy to modify. I've added a variety of other vegetables, skipped the shrimp & added fried tofu, used different Thai curries, etc. Really, it's a fabulous basic recipe that you can change to suit your own personal preferences. One of my favorites: Panang curry with shrimp & add avocado (large dice) at the very end. The avocado and shrimp together give a very nice texture and flavor with the lemongrass-y panang curry. Enjoy!

OK, so i changed it a bit but damn. SO GOOD and an awesome jumping-off place. here's what i did: i used 1 good-sized shallot instead of onion but could have been 2, and sliced it super thin. 4+ tbsp. Thai Kitchen green curry paste but could have used the whole jar and likely will next time to make it hot and not just spiced. i used a bit extra low-salt chicken broth, to the tune of about 1 1/2 c. over the 1 cup called for in the recipe. additionally, i added about a cup of shredded green cabbage after pouring in the coconut milk & chix broth, but purple would have been pretty too. a cup of julienned bamboo shoots with the tomatoes, 2 chicken breasts cut into bite-size pieces and added before said tomatoes. also, a cup of matchsticked green peppers with the curry but i could have waited as they got a bit overcooked when i needed to add more curry. lastly, snow peas for the last couple minutes, served it over jasmine rice with the cilantro garnish but will and basil next time. YUM. SO GOOD. i can't to try it with shrimp!

Did not have cilantro, but used fresh basil instead as I prefer basil in curry rather than cilantro. Did not use lime either. I did add orange bell pepper, zucchini, and stayed, unlike some reviewers, with the 1-2 tbspn.'s of curry paste-wow, you people like it hot! Served with brown jasmine rice-used frozen trader joe's shrimp and it was delicious-even my husband who is not a shrimp lover thought it was great...but of course, he said he would prefer chicken. ;) Oh, I would also use BROWN SUGAR instead of plain old sugar, as most thai currys call for. Delish!

Used additional veggies... carrots, red bell pepper and zucchini to sauté with onions and only one tbls of fish sauce ( just not a big fan) and 1 extra tbls of curry. No other changes. It was fantastic with Jasmine rice

This was the first time I ever made a curry, and I absolutely loved it! It's not a perfect recipe, but even without adjustments it's really yummy. A few recommendations- I'd read from a bunch of people that it needed more "kick," so I put in 3 tbsp of curry instead of 2, but it still needed more. Next time I'm going to add 4 or 5. Also, next time I think I'm going to add more coconut milk and less chicken broth. Lastly, I highly recommend serving it over vermicelli noodles. I did and it accompanied it really well. Overall a great, quick, easy recipe. Highly recommended :)

Tried this a few weeks ago and it was definitely a winner! We even messed up on adding coconut juice instead of milk, and it still had great flavor (we ended up adjusting the sauce and adding coconut milk as well. I'm planning on trying it again this week without the coconut juice. The suggestion to add other veggies is definitely on point- the green pepper and mushrooms we added went really well.

if you've only ever depended on restaurants for your thai fix, this recipe *could* change your life! as someone who has NEVER attempted thai food (except for pre-packaged pad thai...sigh), i was amazed by how easy it was to throw together such a satisfying meal. i altered the recipe a bit-- adding red bell pepper, zucchini, string beans, and fresh chili paste, and substituting fried tofu cubes for the shrimp and vegetable broth for chicken broth. i also omitted the diced tomatoes and sugar. i will definitely make it again...much spicier (and with eggplant)!

Rating: 2
This is a good, very basic recipe. Adding loads of veggies is a must for flavor and variety. I do like thing relatively "hot" so I added several tablespoons of Sircha sauce (chinese red hot sauce), and also served it on the side. I did not add sugar and it was very sweet. The cilantro and lime are essential. Play with it a bit (I would reduce the amount of cocanut milk), and it result in a nice meal.

Can't rate because I made some changes. Skipped the tomatoes, added mushrooms, green beans & red pepper- eggplant would also be good. Doubled the curry paste. It's a good base recipe. We make it often

This dish was really, really good. We added red bell pepper, and used a seafood mix of scallops, shrimp and calamari. I am not an expert in Thai food but it tasted like something we'd get at a thai restaurant, and it was fast and easy to make. I definitely recommend this. We served with rice and some thai salad I had leftover (thus my search for a thai dish to use the leftovers!)

This was so easy and tasty! I have never cooked Thai before - but I will make this again. I don't understand the reviews that said it was bland? I made this and served over jasmine rice - it was fragrant and delicious. I only used one big TBSP of the green curry paste (Mae Ploy) and it had enough of a kick for me. Others may need more. The tomatoes were a nice mild addition. Enjoy!

Made as written, except sauteed 3 boneless and skinless chicken breasts instead of shrimp. Sauteed white onion then removed from pan, then added cubed chicken, cooked through, then removed from pan, draining on paper towel. Returned frypan back on stove, added a bit of oil, returned the chicken and white onion to the pan, added sliced red peppers. Then continued with the green onion etc. Added extra curry paste and added 2 very finely chopped fresh thai bird chilis - was the heat I was looking for! Delicious. I like the thin and flavourful curry vs thick sauce, great with coconut rice.

Easy and delicious -- I haven't cooked Thai food much before and this was a great intro. I agree with the reviewers that say to add veggies, and next time I'll try cooking down the sauce a bit to thicken it. Would also be delicious with fried tofu cubes in place of the shrimp.

Rating: 4
A nice variation from my usual red curry...I added 1 Tbsp lime juice plus a bit of kaffir lime and several dashes of ginger. I substituted 1/2 c. vegetable broth for the chicken broth, which worked well. Also, I tossed in red pepper, carrots, and broccoli while avoiding the scallions and tomatoes. The only downfall of this recipe is that it needs a bit of extra spice. Experiment to find a taste that suits your palate!

This is exceptional because of the combination of flavors and ease of preparation. It is nearly a "pantry staple" recipe, which is great for weeknights. Cooked chicken is a good standby for the shrimp. 2T of curry paste is almost over the top for me but my husband loves spice so it was great for him.

Made as written, except sauteed chicken thighs instead of shrimp. Sauteed white onion then removed from pan, then added thighs, cooked through, then removed from pan and used paper towels to squeeze out excess fat. Rinsed fry pan then wiped out as well. Pan back on stove, added a bit of oil, returned the chicken and white onion to the pan, added sliced red peppers, and chopped carrots. Then continued with the green onion etc. Reminds me of king and i shrimp green curry..added a little extra green curry paste and a few red pepper flakes. served with coconut rice. I gave four forks to recognize the combination of great result with ease and quickess of prep,

Delicious. I've made shrimp curry many times using the recipe on the Thai Kitchen curry paste jar, but this recipe gave better results.

I have made many thai curries from the recipe off the coconut can, and this one by far surpassed them all. I made a few changes..ditched the tomatoes and added green beans, carrots, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and mint leaves. the mint added wonderful complexity to the dish. I also added about 5 tablespoons curry paste, which was the perfect heat for me, and i doubled the sugar, brown sugar instead of white. Lots of changes, yes, but really delicious!

Absolutely delicious!! Next time, though, I'll make two changes. First, since I like spicy food, I may triple the amount of curry. (I doubled it and it still wasn't quite spicy enough for my taste.) Also, I'll make the broth the day before so that the flavors can really blend before the shrimp is added. This tasted even better on the day after preparation!

I used the amount of green curry paste indicated (maybe even a little more, 2T for half the recipe), and I did not find it too spicy, contrary to other reviews. Perhaps its the kind of curry paste used? For this recipe I also agree that I would not add any other additional vegetables. I made this recipe half with shrimp and the other half with pan-fried tofu for my vegetarian friend (leaving out the fish sauce as well). Both were great, in my opinion.

This dish is perfect the way it is. I would not add any vegetables, pineapples or anything. Just follow the recipe as is. It is meant to be soup like instead of stew like. I made this for the first time tonight for a dinner party. It was a HUGE hit! Everyone agreed I shouldn't change anything in the recipe. The brand of curry paste I used was Maseri, it comes in a small can. It does pack a little heat to the dish. If heat is not your friend use a little less. I served mine with rice noodles and everyone loved it. The only part that was difficult for me was how slippery they got. Personally, I would recommend serving this dish with rice. Everyone else thought they wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if it was just rice. All the other reviews made me wonder. If you want to get vegetables in your meal, make a salad or something. Don't add it to this dish.

while las vegas is known for having some of the best restaurants in the country, there is a hidden gem called the lotus of siam. thomas keller goes to this hole-in-the-wall place on his visits to las vegas. this dish rivals anything we've had at lotus of siam! some readers said there isn't enough heat, just add red pepper flakes, not more curry; the curry will overpower the coconut milk. also, lite coconut milk is fine, just let it simmer a little longer for the flavors to meld before adding the shrimp. also, add some oyster mushrooms with onions to saute. delicious!

I made this last night, and it came out delicious! I would rate it a 3.5. I used red curry paste instead of the green, and per other reviewers added snow peas, green beans, mushrooms,pineapple chunks and a few rounds of sliced ginger to give it extra flavor at the end. I let the veggies soften before adding the shrimp. Served it over jasmine rice. There were only two of us so I halved the recipe, and it still worked out well. It is supposed to come out "soupy", because the curry gets absorbed into the rice. Also, I don't know if it's the curry paste that I bought, but it wasn't hot enough for me, even after adding more than the recipe called for. Many people's reviews say that it was super hot, but it wasn't hot enough for me. Also added a little lime juice at the end. Will most definitely make again!

Will keep looking for a good shrimp stir-fry but will pass on this one in the future.

Superb. I have been making coconut curries for years, trying to find the perfect one and now my search has stopped! Based on other reviewers' advice, I added some sliced bell pepper to have more vegebtales. Baby corn, bamboo shoots or snow peas would also all be good. Besides that, made as written. The great thing about this recipe is you can alter it easily, substituting tofu or chicken for the shrimp or green curry paste for the red curry paste. Will make again and again for the rest of my life! =)

This recipe is delicious and extremely quick and easy to prepare. I would start with 1 T. of green curry paste as 2 T. is pretty unbearable. Do not use the "lite" coconut milk...it definitely degrades the taste and makes the dish runnier. Use the fresh tomatoes (it is always better to use fresh), and serve over Jasmine or Basmati rice.

So delicious! Two tablespoons of curry paste (I use Thai Kitchen brand) was just hot enough for us. My market was out of cilantro, so I substituted basil and threw in some 1 inch pieces of fresh green beans to squeeze in some veggies. It was fantastic, and absolutely as easy as everyone has said.

This dish was quite nice. I added shittake mushrooms to the recipe. I feel that they add to the texture of the dish, just add them in with the tomatoes. Great on a bed of Jasmine rice.

Very tasty--a bit too spicy for a couple of the tasters--would go on the low end of suggested curry paste

Really nice recipe. Very easy to make and delicious too. Much better than a store bought green curry sauce. Tried it with chicken as well, which was also good.

Loved this recipe! I used low fat coconut milk and instead of using onion slices, added sugar snap peas, shoestring mushrooms and bamboo shoots. My husband and daughter thought it was wonderful and SPICY!

This was one of those "let's try something new" meals, and yes, it was wonderful. I used red curry sause and mild curry paste because I could not find green curry paste at the store. We did add a flour mixture to thicken the sauce and served it on a bed of brown rice. It received rave reviews.

This dish turned out really well. I used 1 lb. shrimp & 1 lb. tofu, and only 1 T green curry paste (just right!). Quick and easy!

I have made this dish several times and it's always delicious served with either jasmine rice or rice noodles. It works well with chicken also--just saute the chicken after the onions. I use brown sugar, and sometimes add red bell peppers. It's great with a simple salad of greens with julienned cucumber, carrots, pepper, and mango.

I love the sauce. I braise shrimp, tofu, or tilapia in it and serve it over basmati or jasmine rice.

I am not much for cooking - I wok weird hours and my three sons won't eat anything my hubby and I like. We LOVE Thai food and Ive tried a lot of Shrimp Curry recipes hoping to replicate the one at our favorite restaurant. This is just like it and fantastic! I only used 1 tblsp of curry paste and its about a "7" on their hotness scale....

HOLY SMOKES! I made this for my husband and me and we devoured it! Excellent, authentic and so easy. We've added it to our favorites for quick mid-week meals.

I love this dish. it's so easy and definitely full of flavor. Use at least one tablespoon of green chili paste if you do not want it too spicy but still flavorful. Since there was so much good sauce, I added red pepper, canned baby corn, canned straw mushroom, sugar snap peas, canned bamboo shoots and skipped the prawns. Instead of cilantro, I mixed in thai basil before serving. Delicious and healthy!

Awesome curry recipe, very easy to put together. Shrimp was yummy, although I wouldn't hesitate to make again with chicken. I had to use canned diced tomatoes and because they cook down into the sauce I wouldn't bother with fresh next time. Also since I was only cooking one pound of shrimp, I used less broth and coconut milk - but it was not soupy as others have said, it just had a wonderful sauce. I served it over rice noodles in soup bowls and we were licking our plates clean. One Tbsp of curry paste was plenty of heat for us - any more would have overpowered the wonderful flavors. Can't wait to make again! Enjoy!

Quick, easy, and tastes great. I ate with the thick thai noodles. Buy the shrimp already peeled and de-veined. It saves a ton of time.

This recipe is easy to prepare and pretty good. I used thawed previously frozen shrimp, so it took a little longer to get the shrimp cooked/warmed through. I also punched up the heat by adding more curry paste. A simple, good weeknight meal.

This was pretty good. I think next time I will reduce the amount of broth so it won't be so runny. I substituted chicken and added thai eggplant. It is great to now know how to make my favorite thai dish at home. And it's easy too!!!

This dish tastes exactly like the one we order from our favourite thai restaurant! And it was so easy. Only change I made as cutting the recipe in 1/2, adding slivered red peppers and usiing red curry paste. It was wonderfully spicy. Will definitely make again and again.

If you love spiciness, you could add another tbsp. of curry paste -- my spice-fiend friends craved more when I used 2 tbsp. Next time I make it, I think I'll add a bell pepper or other extra vegetables -- it's a bit thin as written.

Rating: 3
Reduced amount of broth so it wouldn't be so runny/saucy, and added pineapple chunks. Used the full 2 TBL curry paste, so the sweetness of the pineapple is a pleasant offset to the fiery heat of the curry. Also used chicken in place of shrimp. We liked it.

Rating: 3
This was a real treat, and fairly quick to throw together. If you are interested in this recipe for lower carb reasons, as I was, try using only scallions rather than scallions and yellow onions, and don't saute them as long. I used splenda instead of sugar, and cream instead of coconut milk. I love edamame soy beans so I warmed up some I had on hand in the freezer and threw in. I'll make this again for sure.

Rating: 4
Yum! This is restaurant quality, awesome Thai food. I served over rice noodles in a soup bowl and my husband and I couldn't get enough. Can't wait to make it for company. Depending on the crowd, might tone down the heat from the 2 T of green curry (we loved it hot). Even my 6 yr old ate it (with lots of bread and milk). A keeper for sure!

Rating: 4
This was excellent. I added 1/2 a red pepper cut into strips and 2 carrots sliced into discs. I cut back on the onion and only used 2 tbsp. of fish sauce because I only had regular chicken stock. Very easy to put together and I served over coconut rice.

I've prepared this dish three times in the last two months to excellent reviews. I closely follow the recipe (with 2 tablespoons green curry and canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh), but also add carrot and zucchini (both thinly julienned on a mandoline) and a handful of peas. Along with lime and cilantro, I offer bean sprouts as a garnish (because they're also on the salad with Thai-style peanut dressing I serve alongside). A very colorful presentation and substantial dish. The flavor is tantalizing and leaves you begging for more!

I first made this recipe exactly as listed, adding only a little garlic. Excellent and friends lapped it up. Next time, I didn't have any shrimp but substituted chicken and silver noodles to make a sort of chicken soup. Delicious! Thai pennicillin! A very workable recipe and extremely easy.

I had never made a thai curry dish before and thought this was excellent -- and easy. I cut it in half to serve two people, and used 1 T of the green curry paste - definitely spicy enough for our tastes. Served over jasmahti rice.

In a word, YUCK! No one in our family really liked this. I have made many better curries, and won't waste my time on this one again.

Very good shrimp curry. We changed it a bit, using vegetable bouillon, since one of us doesn't eat chicken/beef products. The bouillon along with the fish sauce made the dish too salty so I added an extra can of coconut milk and a little more of the sugar and curry paste and it was perfect. Also added one pound of asparagus sliced into one inch pieces shortly before the shrimp.

This was very easy to prepare and delicious. I would suggest adding in the curry paste a tiny bit at a time & tasting after each addition - it can get SUPER spicy SUPER fast!

The fish oil was a bit hard to find in the stores and then when I finally did find it I was overwhelmed by the variety (couldn't find anything named nam pla). The one I picked was a good one thank goodness, don't be offset by the smell. This dish all comes together in the end and it is excellent. I served it on a plate over basmati rice, next time I'll use bowls. Don't cut down on the liquids, they are absolutely fabulous with the leftover rice.

This was very good...I really liked the one pot aspect of this dish, it's very good for how little effort it takes. I used vegtable broth and canned diced tomatoes. I followed other reviewers about having too much broth and used less, but i have to say that served over white rice, there is no need to reduce, you want all the sauce you can get...

What a great recipe! Based on previous suggestions, I added some ginger and by mistake, increased the tomatoes to 2 cups, which worked out fine. I also added a couple of handfuls of frozen peas with the shrimp and thickened the sauce a bit with some cornstarch. Served over basil flavored rice noodles. I used 1 1/2 Tbsp. of the curry paste and it was fine for me, but a bit too spicy for hubby. Next time I make this (and it will be soon!), I'll make two batches - one with heat, and one a bit milder.

kitchen in Seattle: I used Panang curry paste (MAE PLOY) and this dish was wonderful! I have tried it with fried tofu as well as shrimp and both are great - served with peanuts, lime, and young coconut yum!

Mmmm...mmm...scrumptious! Even my brother-in-law, who is a hard-to-please gourmet, complimented me on this dish. And it WAS easy to make, which was a bonus since I have a 3-mo-old daughter. Based on the suggestions of others, I modified a bit: added 4 ginger coins along with the onion saute, cut back on the chicken broth (to 1/2 c.), added blanched green beans and basil leaves near the end, and served over rice. While I don't shy away from spicy food, next time I would reduce the curry paste too. (It may depend on the brand, I used 1 T. of the "Thai Kitchen" kind and it was yummy, but HOT!). For dessert we had coconut sorbet with fresh mango slices. What a delicious meal!!

Wow! From the smell while this was cooking, I didn't expect to like it at all, but once it all came together, it was fantastic. (Totally a subjective thing -- my husband, who grew up in Thailand, thought it smelled wonderful.) Changes I made: no chicken broth, no sugar, no onion, added ginger and garlic. My husband said it reminded him of his childhood. Definitely a keeper.

I was really pleased with this. I used a combination of shrimp and chicken. I also took the advice of some other reviewers and reduced the broth. I did add some corn starch to thicken up the broth, but I might have added a tad too much. I only used half of the curry paste, which was plenty for me, but I really enjoyed the flavor and will look for other recipes I can use it in.

It was delicious, but watch the amount of green curry. I would definitely not use any more than 1 tablespoon, especially if you cut down the amount of liquid.

Rating: 4
Wow! Outstanding! Based on past reviews, I reduced the stock, coconut milk, and fish sauce. It was wonderful, but I'm not sure the reduction was necessary. This dish is meant to be served in a soup bowl and the excess broth will be absorbed by the jasmine rice. So, next time, I'll follow the recipe as written. I do think substituting brown sugar for the white is reasonable, since it's similar to the traditional palm sugar often used in Thai cooking. We loved this recipe, and I'm looking forward to trying it with chicken. I did make a shrimp stock from the shells, and next time I will likely substitute it for the chicken stock.

TASTES BETTER WITH 4" PIECE FRSH CHOPPED GINGER AND 1/4 CUP BASIL LEAVES

My family loves this, it's so simple and flexible, but sooo good! Every time I make it I think it gets better and better. I use 1/3 cup chicken broth and brown sugar instead of white. Some simple variations on this basic recipe: add two med zuchinni (and/or tender yellow squash), halved lenghthwise and sliced; one or two big handfulls of frozen peas; the same of fresh or frozen diced carrots- let the veggies soften up in the curry before adding shrimp. Also for a nice change, add a small can of pineapple chunks with the juice & skip the chicken broth. Serve with lots of sticky rice to soak up that curry! Yum!

Glad that we put the tomato product in the dish. Also, threw in some green peas at the end for much needed color and flavor. I thought the dish was flat and needed some salt to brighten things. Served over Japanese noodles. Will make again.

My husband and I enjoyed this SO much! I did make a couple of alterations. I only used a 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I also used chicken breast instead of shrimp. I cut them up bite size and then sauted them up ahead of time. Also the two tablespoons of green curry paste was to HOT for me, (my husband loved it, he likes things really hot) If I was going to make for company I would definitly dial down the curry. I also think it would be really good if you added some potatoes as well. That might help with the soupiness others have found. I really loved the flavors of this dish. Tasted just like in a restaurant.

Rating: 3
The flavors in this recipe are great, but I agree with previous reviewers that a few modifcations are in order (based on my making it exactly as printed). It turns out very, very soupy - it's mostly liquid + shrimp. I'd leave out the chicken broth or cut back on all the liquids in equal amounts. I cut back on the curry paste to 1.5 tablespoons and it was very, very hot. The on-line recipe does not state this, but the magazine article does....serve with jasmine rice (they also suggested coconut ice cream for dessert).

Rating: 4
Fantastic!! Based on other comments I reduced coconut milk to 1/2 cup, chicken broth to 3/4 cup and added one pound of green beans (blanched 5 minutes) topped w peanuts and bean sprouts. Served over sauteed cabbage, garlic and soy sauce. Really good!!!

I adapted this recipe as a special treat for my veggie boyfriend- instead of shrimp, I used firm tofu; in place of chicken broth, I used vegetable broth- it was delicious!!

Very delicious and easy!!! The sauce was a little too liquidy (I added a little corn starch to thicken it) but next time I would probably only use 1/2 of the chicken broth.

Delicious!! Easy enough to be a weeknight meal, but it tasted like something special. Such a nice change from the same old same old we make during the week. We love a lot of flavor and this hit the mark for us. We will definitely make this again. Definitely serve over rice as there is so much good sauce that otherwise would be lost.

I made this for a dinner party, and it was a big hit. I used light coconut milk as did many other reviewers, and, because the local Wild Oats here in the heartland doesn't sell raw shrimp, used precooked (though not frozen) shrimp. I just tossed them in toward the end of cooking to heat them through, and it worked perfectly.

Not only would I make this again, I've made it several times already, including last night for a dinner with a friend - who also loved it. In fact, the reason I'm on this site is so I can email it to him. I've substituted chicken for the shrimp, as one writer suggested, and used a mixture of chicken and shrimp another time; I've also added other vegetables (red, orange, or yellow peppers), since I wasn't sure about the tomatoes, but I used tomatoes last night and liked them too. I've looked for a recipe that duplicates my favorite Thai restaurant's curry for a long time - so happy to have found one! (Oh, and I added rice, but I just assumed that was the idea, since I almost always have curry over rice, especially Thai curries, but any curry, really). Can you tell I liked it?

Sometimes we wonder if these recipes are even kitchen tested. This dish busts out with really great flavor, but be prepared: this is SOUP by anyone's definition.

You have made two "Thai deprived" people very happy! We are in an area that does not offer alot of ethinic restaurants, so I am always on the lookout for recipes to make at home. This is very close to one we loved at a restaurant in Jupiter, FL. I used red curry paste and doubled the amount. Can't wait to try this with scallops!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful, and incredibly easy, too. I have made it twice already! Like many of your other readers, I also used lite cocounut milk. The first time I made it, the sauce seemed a little "soupy," so I cooked it down a bit after adding the tomatoes, then added the shrimp. I also plan try it with red curry paste. Thanks for making me feel (however briefly) that I have mastered the art of Thai cooking!

SO quick and wonderful!!! I, like several of the other reviewers, used light coconut milk. My family is not fond of fish sauce, so I only used 1/2 the suggested amount and it was great - and not noticable. I used the full 2 tablespoons of the the curry paste. Can't wait to make it again.

This is one of the best curry recipes we've ever had! Don't change a thing, unless you want to cut it in half (which we did -- the 6-yr-old is not too keen on curry)or double!!
