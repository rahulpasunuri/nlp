Wow! My husband and I made this for our special stay in dinner this week. We changed up the risotto, I agree you never use water. Instead of Parmesan we used fontina and we stirred some fresh spinach.I added thyme and shallot to the water I cooked the pumpkin in and used that along with chicken stock to make the risotto. Don't skip the sage butter, it really is good especially in combination with truffle oil. For us this made 2 generous dinner servings with a little risotto left over. I decreased to scallops to a little under a pound. Will definitely make this again!

So good. I used shrimp instead of scallops (more affordable). Still great. This made 2 dinner size servings. 4 servings would be pretty small. My husband is European and he agrees...so it's not just me being used to American sized portions! Ha ha. I will use 4 1/2 cups of liquid for the risotto next time and cook for 20 minutes instead if 18. Definately recommend!

I thought this was fabulous. No baby pumpkins for me. I used butternut squash (more than was called for) and I boiled it with just enough water to cover. I used the cooking water for part of the risotto cooking liquid. I also used about 1/2 cup of sherry - the rest chicken broth. Used a big shallot and a clove of garlic instead of onion. Threw some sage in about halfway through cooking risotto. Nice addition, but whatever you do, don't skip the sage in the brown butter at the end. Drizzled truffle oil on at the table. All-in-all really small edits to the original recipe. It was excellent.

OK, so I didn't use the risotto recipe here - I've been making risotto for a very long time and have my own method -- for one thing, NEVER add plain water to risotto!! I use different stocks and wines. I used a very large butternut squash that I roasted in the over for about an hour with salt, pepper, cinnamon, honey and butter. The sage butter was absolutelty to die for!!!!

I made the pumpkins the night before using the tips in a previous review. It was very cute and everyone loved the dish. I thought the risotto was a bit bland, so I think using the tips for stock and wine found in the reviews is also a great idea. With the changes in the reviews, I'd give it a four forks rating, but three forks is for the recipe as written.

A beautiful fall recipe. While it was not my absolute favorite risotto, it was good. If we were to make it again, we would definitely add some white wine instead of just using chicken stock.

Excellent fall dish. We had leftover pumpkin mix from a different dish and were looking for something to use it on. Used the same quantity as called for with fresh pumpkin and still turned out just fine. Prepared a bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin for the main dish and it made for an excellent meal.

SO GOOD!!! I do not usually cook, my husband does all the cooking, so this was a bit for me to take on. I planned it all out and made sure I had plenty of time for everything. I loved the pumpkin dishes, it was fun and added color! I took some suggestions and did 3 cups veggie stock (I am a pescatarian) and 1 cup wine. I added some garlic too! A little extra cheese and some salt and pepper. The scallops were so good! I stuck to the recipe, but added a bit more sage because others recommended that. It was yummy!!!!!

OMG. This was so good. I made this for a dinner party last night and it was a huge success. I followed some of the suggestions and used chicken broth and white wine for the liquid components. I also sauteed onions and shallots in olive oil beforehand and added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the risotto as it cooked. I had problems finding a good, fresh, and perfectly ripe pumpkin, so I ended up using canned pumpkin- I don't think it ruined the dish at all. It tasted amazing. The parmesan cheese added at the end really brings everything together. Next time I'll be serving it alongside the scallops- my student budget didn't quite allow room for that this time around. Also, the pumpkin shells were a bit of work but they are so cute and definitely impressed my guests, so the work is well worth it!

I made this risotto along with the Pan Seared Scallops in Taragon Butter Sauce (different recipe). I found the Pumpkin Risotto to be lacking in flare and flavor. Presentation was ok, and taste was ok - nothing more and not worth the effort (my brother and his wife agreed). Will not make again.

We did this recipe for my birthday meal...I have never prepared scallops before and they were just sweet and tender and tasty with the sage butter over top. Hints: pumpkin prep was very time consuming...will not do that again. Even with roasting the pumpkin some to separate the flesh from the outer section - very time consuming. We will consider butternut squash as the preffered alternative in the future. Bought as others had suggested (thank you!) dry sack scallops - no weeping - so totally worth the extra $! Also dust scallops in flour for beautiful browning. Additionally, we will use more sage. The sage fried up in the pan with bits of scallops in it - very tasty! This is a winner - very simple prep on the scallops over risotto with a very memorable result.

I haven't made this recipe yet but I plan on making it for a dinner party I'm having next weekend. For all of you who've made this dish, would the risotto recipe serve six instead of four people?

I just made this recipe and all I have to say is it was AMAZING!!!! Even my 4 1/2 year old said, "Mommy, this is the best dinner EVER!" And he proved he wasn't just saying it by eating it all. I did make some adjustments to it, though. For starters, I did not roast the mini pumpkins but opted instead to microwave them for 5 minutes in a bowl with a little water at the bottom and covered with plastic wrap. For the risotto, I started by also microwaving a whole pumpkin on high for 5 minutes to soften it. Once cut up, I drizzled it with a little honey and roasted it at 350*F for 5 minutes. Instead of an onion, I used a cup of chopped leeks, which I sauteed with the olive oil until soft (about 5 minutes). I added the pumpkin to this with a 1/2 cup mixture of chicken broth (not stock) and some nutmeg and cooked it until tender (about 5 minutes) and then proceeded the recipe substituting one cup of white wine and another cup of chicken broth for all of the water. When the risotto was done, I swirled in 2 tablespoons of mascarpone cheese. I changed nothing in the scallops, but I think next time, I'll fry up more sage because I just loved the crispy sage over the scallops. I would definitely make this again!

Followed recipe exactly except omitted truffle oil at end. Delicious as written. Got rave reviews at dinner.

Excellent use of pumpkin! Because you add in the pumpkin at the end, you have some flexibility as to how much to use. I would double the amount, if you think you'd like it. I used a pumpkin from our garden, Connecticut Field Heirloom variety. It was well received by the kids and adults. I added the spices as suggested by the other reviews. I opted for veg. broth also. I would think canned pumpkin would really ruin this dish. Just my opinion. Will definitely be on our holiday list this year!

READ ALL REVIEWS! Would never make as written-basic idea is fantastic. I didn't have guests or mother-in-law over for this meal,therefore ditched the frou-frou pumpkin shells. Wonderful thought for a small dinner party. My contribution to these notes: Trader Joe's fresh butternut squash, roasted in duck fat and sea salt. Add to risotto. My 20-something kids stayed home to eat after glancing at Mom and Dad's dinner fare.

The pumpkin, scallops and sage all smelled delicious as the risotto cooked, but once we added the truffle oil it swamped the rest of the flavors. Probably worth adding a bit, but definitely not two Tbs.

I used canned pumpkin in the risotto and it was fantastic. An impressive company meal that doesn't take a lot of time if you mostly precook the risotto, as the scallops take such a short amount of time.

Did a test run for Thanksgiving, using this dish as a primi. Trying some of the suggestions of other readers/cooks, here is my feedback: use marsala as the first liquid, use all chicken stock (for any great risotto), substitute white truffle oil for the butter at the end of the risotto, use a combination of shallots and onion instead of just 1 onion for the risotto (much more earthy and seasonal flavor), and add either dried or fresh sage and thyme to the risotto during cooking. This is FANTASTIC. I am definitely making this for my family over the holiday.

GREAT RECIPE! I made it with many of the suggestions on this site. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg & 1/2 teaspoon fresh sage to the risotto mixture while cooking it. I used 3 1/2 cups chicken stock and 1/2 cup dry white wine (in lieu of 2 cups stock & 2 cups water). I roasted the pumpkin in the oven - you want to see the pumpkin chunks in the risotto as opposed to using a puree of pumpkin. It was easy to make. Serving the risotto in the mini pumpkins made for a wonderful presentation with little effort. All in all a wonderful fall recipe!

Loved the scallops. The risotto was also good. I followed some of the suggestions and used shallots,canned organic pumpkin (could not find the small pumpkins) and more stock and 1/2 cup wine in place of water. Good, but maybe a little too sweet. Will try it next time when I can find the pumpkins.

Before I forget... I sauteed 1 1/2 large, chopped shallots in 1 T. butter for about eight minutes, added the 3/4 c. arborio rice for about two minutes, then mixed in 2 c. chicken broth bit by bit until most was soaked up, followed by about 2 c. chopped asparagus. After about five minutes, I added 1 c. white wine, let it simmer for a few minutes, then added 8 oz. canned pumpkin, lots and lots of salt and pepper, 2 or 3 t. dried sage and at least 1 t. cinnamon. Yummmmmmmmm!!! Thanks to all reviewers for the tips! It tasted (and was) healthy, and it drew raves from my husband.

After making this dish once or twice, we fiddled around with the recipe enough so that the risotto finally had lots of flavor. 1. Use all chicken stock and no water, and finish with a little white wine 2. Roast or pan roast the pumpkin in butter or duck fat to bring out the sweetness 3. Add fresh or dried sage or Thyme to the risotto during cooking: both spices bring out the earthiness of the truffle oil and the pumpkin. We did this last night and it was absolutely delicious: a perfect fall meal.

Exquisite & we've made 100's of risottos! Made a few changes after reading reviews: used shrimp (scallops not available) & the shells we removed were tossed into the vegetable broth we were simmering - used "kitchen basics" brand veggie broth & some natural powder broth added to water, then added the shrimp shells & reduced it all by half, discarded the shells (straining with cheesecloth) & the broth was exquisite. Used 1C Marsala wine as 1st liquid added to rice. Also, used 8 Oz organic canned pumpkin instead of the squash - it was outstanding! The shrimp were out of the world good - great idea the crispy sage!

I used the roasted butternut squash risotto recipe from the site instead of the pumpkin risotto. It was delicous served with the scallops. I am trying it again with porcini mushroom risotto.

We did away with the schmaltzy presentation in the mini pumpkins--too much froofiness. Instead we piled the risotto in the center of the plate and arranged the scallops round it--looked beautiful. And tasted great as well! All I could find was truffle FLAVORED oil, but it worked fine. The risotto is a little bland, as some people have commented, but we found it to be a nice contrast (or "canvas") to the very tasty scallops. Very nice meal!

Fresh pumpkin can be a bit hard to find, so I substitute some butternut squash that I've roasted for 30 mins in a 450° oven. Also I add white wine into the chicken broth. It's always a huge hit. Don't skimp on the truffle oil - it's wonderful.

For those who are looking for a pumpkin risotto recipe but don't have pumpkins available (this happened to me when I wanted to make it after Thanksgiving and no pumpkins were to be found!) I used this basic recipe and added 1/3 of a can of pumpkin for pumpkin pie filling and a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon applesauce mixed together after the last of the liquid had been absorbed. It was SO good. My friends loved it.

I made this for a dinner party, and received rave reviews. Preparing the miniature pumpkins to serve the risotto in was a lot of work, but the rest of this recipe was pretty easy. I seasoned the risotto with cinnamon instead of cheese and used fat free chicken broth to make the recipe a little healthier.

I did not make the scallops, only the risotto. Heeded everyone's suggstions but failed to taste the pumpkin. Maybe more nutmeg or some pumpkin pie spice would enhance it. Found it rather ordinary, but a great presentation.

This made a lovely Christmas Eve dinner with a frisee salad and a sparkling Italian wine. We no longer had sugar pumpkins in our market, but some small sweet winter squash worked well. I agree with other comments here that the squash worked well cooked with the shallots and rice and I added white wine first (befoe the chicken stock) as I always do with risotto. This would be lovely as a 1st course in a more formal dinner.

This recipe was easy and delicious! It's the best and has the greatest 'wow' factor of anything I've ever made at home. I have never cooked with pumpkin (too much association with the sweetness of pumpkin pie, I suppose) and was blown away by how wonderful it was. I would definitely suggest having a nice cold, crispy salad dressed with an Italian vinagrette on the side to cut the delicious richness of the dish.

Outstanding! Like other reviewers, I added a little garlic and used 3&1/2 cups of broth, 1/2 cup wine and no water in the risotto. Very rich dish but oh so delicious! Great presentation. Both dishes stand alone. I'll definitely be making this one again. My husband rarely gives four forks but he gave four forks to this recipe.

This was so cute to present! I didn't follow this risotto recipe, though (yuck). For better pumpkin risotto saute about 2 generous cups shallots with a couple cloves of garlic in butter, then add the rice, then some dry white wine, wait for the wine to aborb, then add pumpkin/squash plus a pinch of nutmeg, then start adding the broth (definitely no water!), a little at a time, until all broth is gone except for about a half cup (approx. 15-20 min.) Remove from heat, add parm. chz, remaining liquid, S and P, and let stand for a few minutes. Much better!

Yuck, the risotto needs a bit more flavor, the truffle oil is a bit smelly. I think I had a cheap version of the oil. Our guest were nice and said everything was very good. But I think they were being polite. The risotto was a bit bland, and the scallops were nothing faboulous. Although I walked away from this dinner still in good standing,I would not make this again.

This meal was outstanding and the presentation was fabulous! I took the advice of others and replaced the 2 cups water with 1 1/2 C more chx broth and 1/2 cup marsala wine. The wine gave the risotto a nice colour. I also roasted the diced pumpkin pieces with a little olive oil in the oven and they carmalized somewhat. We are making this again this weekend for a party - due to requests from last night!

This recipe was amazing with a few variations. I heeded the comments from others who tried this. First, use all chicken stock vs. adding any water. It provided a more well rounded flavor. Then, since mini pumpkins are hard to find, I took small acorn squash, roasted them for 35 minutes and scooped them out, using the shell of the squash as the "serving dish". I also added toasted pecans to provide texture and richness. The scallops, delectable! This was hands down a fabulous foundation for an amazing meal.

I would make the scallops again but I have had better risotto. The pumpkins were adorable and they are still talked about by friends. The scallops came out perfect and tasty. The only reason I rated this 2 forks was because of the risotto. Make the scallops and find a better recipe for the risotto

Although the presentation was fun and fantastic, I thought it was too bland, especially for the price tag on the scallops. I parboiled the pumpkin, but it wasn't enough to bring out any flavor. Roasting may work better. I didn't have truffle oil, so that may have been a problem, but the strongest flavor that I tasted was butter. The sage was definitely the best part of the dish.

There are a few fundamental problems with this recipie. The broth is too bland, there is really no flavor except for the sage and truffle oil. Add chicken stock and marsala or white wine cut back on the water. Also, infuse the broth with a few sage leaves for more flavor. Roasting the pumkins made the presentation GREAT! I would make this recipie again but skip the truffle oil and concetrate the flavor in the Risotto (as noted above).

I'm not a fan of scallops so I made it with pork! I substituted a little white wine for part of the stock, which I infused with a little sage to make up for the herbs in the scallops. It was really good stuff. We gobbled it all up.

Four forks for the risotto, for which I used roasted butternut squash instead of pumpkin. The scallops, on the other hand, were not as spectacular as I expected from the other reviews; I found the combination of the butter, truffle oil, and scallops a bit rich and overpowering. I could eat only one scallop before I went back to finishing off the risotto. Does anyone have any suggestions to cut the richness of the scallops?

I followed the recipe exactly including the mini pumpkins. It was a great presentation with wonderful flavor. The mini pumpkins were minimal effort. Based on the previous reviews, I question whether the truffle oil added a lot to the flavor. Half the reviewers didn't use it and still like the dish. I paid $7.15 for 2 tablespoons of the truffle oil!

Delicious. I've made this twice--once w/scallops and once w/chicken. You don't need the truffle oil, though it is delicious. The only recommendation I had was to roast the pumpkin cubes (or butternut squash works too) instead of boiling them. It tastes better that way, I thought.

I am a busy mom of a three year old and a 5 month old. Needless to say I am always trying to save. So with that in mind, the evening before my beautiful adult dinner, I cooked the pumpkins for 30 minutes. Removed the seeds and allowed them to cool completely. During this time I made the Risotto exactly as the recipe called for except for par boiling the diced pumpkin. ( a mistake that worked to my advantage) After the risotto cooled I added the diced pumpkin. Once everything was cold, I filled the pumpkins with the risotto, wrapped them up in their roasting pan with tin foil. The following evening I simply put them in the oven at 400 for about 30 minutes and served. I was truley skeptical that I had ruined this dish, but the risotto was still firm, moist, and the pumpkin ever so slightly crisp. I will definately do this again.

I agree with the previous reviews. Wonderful dish even though I did not add the truffle oil (just used extra virg. olive oil). The small pumpins i used should probably have been taken out after 40 minutes. 2 of them did fall apart somewhat.

I loved this recipe!! I did the full show, including the fresh pumpkin, the Jack-Be-Littles and the truffle oil. It was a lot of activity for an hour, but the results were worth it. I was afraid that the truffle oil might overpower the delicate taste of the scallops, but the combination was perfect. It really highlighted the earthiness of the pumpkin. I'll definitely make this again.

I cheated and used a cup of canned pumpkin instead of the diced (tasted great anyway)! I also just served the scallops on top of the risotto and didn't bother with the tiny jack-o-lanterns (too fussy for a regular week night dinner). The scallops and the pumpkin make a wonderful taste combo (savory seafood and sweet). I also didn't have any truffle oil but we didn't miss it.
