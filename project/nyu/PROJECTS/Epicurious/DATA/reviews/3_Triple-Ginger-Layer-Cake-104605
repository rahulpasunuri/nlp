This cake turned out perfectly. Just remember to use cake flour (sifted) and it won't be too dry or dense. Penseys crystalized ginger worked great. The fact that it is not overly sweet is a plus.

I made this cake for my mother's 60th birthday surprise party. It was amazing. After reading some of the reveiws I opted to add 1/2 cup sour cream to the buttermilk to make the cake moist. It was very dense but had a great texture. I also put the ginger in my grinder because I didn't want to chop it. It was sticky but mixed in well and gave the cake an excellent flavor. I used a lemon cream cheese frosting. It was a huge hit. (kids didn't like it much, slightly spicy).

This is my favorite birthday cake. Like other reviewers, I find the cake a bit dry. Adding an additional 1/4 cup of sour cream and 2 tablespoons of grated fresh ginger help moisten the cake and lift the ginger taste. Our friends love that the resulting cake is not too sweet, but very rich, beautiful (especially with lots of lit candles) and delicious. Serve with a glass of Washington's sparkler - Mountain Dome. Cheers!

I've made this several times, and it's always well-received. One popular variation I do is to make a bittersweet chocolate frosting instead of the cream cheese one. The Joy of Cooking has a good chocolate ganache I used last time. The crystalized ginger makes a nice garnish for this too.

I have made this cake three times now, and absolutely love it. 30 minutes was too long---mine was baked in just under 25 minutes. The frosting is out of sight. Since crystallized ginger is fairly expensive, I used about 2/3 of the amount called for, and it turned out well. Will make this one again and again.

This cake has good flavor but turned out too dry. The frosting is delicious, though--I'm saving the rest for a carrot cake. Nice change from the regular cream cheese frosting.

Made this for my husband's and his father's birthday party, and it was a huge hit. I think the subtle sweetness is an asset. For kids you might want something more sugary but the adults here loved it. (Crystalized ginger can be expensive in the little jars so buy in bulk when you can find it- try penzeys.com.)

Not nearly sweet enough and not enough flavor in the cake to make up for the lack of sweetness. It was also not tender enough and too dense. I was making it for a birthday and threw it out without frosting it, so I can't rate the frosting.

it is very heavy.

This cake is delicious. I serve it with cinnamon ice cream. It's easy to make-just mix a generous amount of cinnamon in vanilla bean ice cream-stir until creamy and smooth and refreeze for a couple of hours. It's a great complement. I always get many happy reviews from my guests and requests for the recipe.

We loved this cake the first time we made it. It seemed pretty dry the second time. Don't know what the difference was. Great flavors, though!

Excellent ginger flavor, but I agree it was a little dense and dry. For ginger lovers, I'd stick to Gramercy Tavern Gingerbread.

Agree that it was a little dense, but the flavor is fantastic. A little vanilla ice cream was the perfect complement.

We made this to accompany some of the recipes from December 2000 issue, New Year's Buffet for 24. It complemented very nicely. Our guests were very pleased with the results. My husband thought it was on the heavy side, but wouldn't the crystallized ginger have sunk if it was lighter?
