I just made this last week and it is definitely a keeper. I followed the recipe as written; and it turned out perfectly!! The crackling skin was so good and we fought over it. I found a small piece that was overlooked the next day and was amazed that it was still crunchy. I used a small leftover portion and the bone to make Galician Meat and Vegetable Soup the next day.

I found this in my Bon Apetite magazine and made it for an annual holiday pot luck my husband does at work. These guys put on quite a spread and try out lots of amazing recipes. Our ham was gone so fast many folks were disappointed and wanted to know how it was prepared. Yes it is a keeper simple to make with a wonderful interesting flavor.

I made this over the Holidays and it was a "must make this again" winner for the family! I used a slightly smaller green ham from Publix (about 8.5 lbs) as my local butcher would only sell the entire 20lb+ shank and modified the cooking process by cooking it on my Kamado Joe grill after browning in the oven (it's tough to get the temperature down quickly in a ceramic grill). The hickory smoke really complimented the rub and ham literally "gushed" juices when sliced. The ham had a turkey-like color and consistency, definitely not the pink color you get from a traditional smoked ham. I'll make the gravy a little differently next time as it turned out too "smoky" from using the pan drippings as the base, though there wasn't any gravy left!

@ Homesckalien use it to make a flavorful broth for future soups or simply include it in water to cook a bean soup.

Made this for NYD and it was great! Followed as written, including the 4 day brine. Very easy. Blast it @ 500 then drop to 325 for a couple hours. I rested it for about an hour. Now if I only knew what to do with the meaty bone....

I took the plunge and made this for Christmas dinner based on the stunning photo in the magazine. I followed all of the instructions exactly. It was easy to get a bone in, skin on shank ham from whole foods and at two ninety-nine a pound, very economical. The hardest part was scoring the skin/fat. You must have a crazy sharp knife or you will have a miserable time like I did. My knives are not so great and it took forever. The rub really sunk into the ham after four days in the fridge, I used oven roaster bags to keep it all contained. While cooking, it smelled amazing and you can really taste the herbs/seasoning in the final product. The sauce was easy to make and my guests all gobbled it up and raved. Personally, I was only so-so on the ham. I think I prefer a country ham (super expensive) or Irish boiling bacon (harder to find) over this. But for the price and simplicity of the recipe, it is very nice.
