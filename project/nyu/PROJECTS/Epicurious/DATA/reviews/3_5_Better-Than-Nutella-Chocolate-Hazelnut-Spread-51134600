Yep the texture was grainier than Nutella, but it was nice. Had lots of help skinning the hazelnuts with my kids and they all loved the product. Will make for gifts in the future!

Loved the taste, and yes, grainy but I didn't mind the texture. I liked the fact it was without preservatives, and I used half and half instead of cream. Skinning the hazelnuts was a bit of a pain, but with 4 kids, I had help. Will make again to give as gifts!!!!

I followed the recipe, but found the result to be much grainier than Nutella. I appreciate that it's all natural, and it's a better choice than the stuff in the jar, but I was disappointed with the texture.

This tasted quite a bit better than regular Nutella, but before I make it again, two things need to happen: 1. I need to find hazelnuts without skins. Removing the skins was a miserable miserable experience and I will never attempt that again. 2. I need to use a higher powered food processor or find an alternative to get the smooth paste the recipe calls for. That said, I gave out the jars as Christmas presents and people loved it.

I found the jars shown with lids at the Container Store and some cute bunny spoons at Sur La Table. These made lovely homemade gifts. Although it is not something I usually buy, I thought that the homemade version was quite tasty and did not hesitate to present it to others.

Wonderful recipe...went over well as gifts. Definitely need high quality chocolate and even higher performance processor. Was able to process nuts until very smooth, which made all the difference between first and second batches.

Delicious and very easy. Better than Nutella-- not necessarily something I would make for myself in this quantity, but a perfect little gift. Does indeed fill four eight-ounce jars. The texture is definitely grainier than a regular Nutella, but I liked it.

Fun holiday gift to make with my 12year old daughter. We tripled the recipe and processed with an electric mixer at the end to take care of the chunks of hazelnut "paste". Turned out lovely (and yes, a little grainy, but we don't mind).

Seriously delicious! I really whirred up the hazelnuts in the cuisinart and they turned into a silky smooth paste, so I didn't have a problem with the graininess noted by other reviewers. Just do it a little longer and it almost liquifies. Infinitely better tasting than the commercial product and without any of the additives. I used 4 oz jars for packaging, which ends up being a really sweet little present. This one will go into my recipe file for the future.

The recipe is fairly easy to make. I decided to use semi-sweet chocolate rather than bittersweet. The recipe does not call for a lot of sugar so the spread is not overly sweet. The Hazelnut paste does not come out smooth which does impact the texture of the spread but I still liked the flavor.

This totally bombed for me. Couldn't get the nuts to make a "smooth buttery paste" even after lots of extra time processing. Finished product was incredibly bitter and just tasted nasty. Xmas present fail :(

This was easy to make and is a terrific foodie gift idea (in my opinion). Presented in small kilner jars it looks and feels really special. I think it tastes gorgeous, but it's not quite like nutella. It tastes more grown-up - slightly bitter from the roasted nuts and dark chocolate and significantly less sweet. The ground nuts can be felt, so don't expect a perfectly smooth texture. I think all this is an improvement compared with the industrial original, but a child might be disappointed.
