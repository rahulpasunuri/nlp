Fairly easy and good, but not great. The texture was spot-on but it lacked a real rich chocolatey taste when I made it with semi-sweet chocolate. Next time I'll use dark chocolate and maybe a hint of coffee.

Best fudge I have ever had

Rating: 3
First time fudge maker here. I doubled this recipe and it came out great. I had some trouble getting it up to temperature without mortally wounding myself - I would recommend a nice deep pan for this recipe. Other than that, it set perfectly and tastes really good - smooth consistency, very chocolatey. It is a bit too sweet, however. I might cut back the sugar next time around and add nuts for some variety. Based on the success of this recipe, I would make it again with slight modifications.

I made the fudge exactly as the recipe says except I sprinkled it with miniature chocolate chips and chipped pecans. I really liked the texture of the fudge. It was not as teeth-achingly sweet as some fudge, but still too much sugar for me. I'm not sure if I would make it again. - would probably try something else first (I'd rather make dark chocolate truffles, but this is so much easier, especially just cutting it into 3 wide bars).

Yum, Yum and Yum!!! This recipe was easy to make...I am first time fudge maker and it turned out perfect. I skipped the chocolate chips and added chopped up toffee instead - delicious!

I have been looking for a really good fudge recipe for years - I have found it! It's so delcious - creamy, rich, decadent!! It will become part of my Christmas candy favorites!

OK - my rating might not mean much since this was the first fudge I've ever made. However, it flew off the plate - against a lot of really good desserts and chocolates at both Xmas parties I brought it to. I did not use the chocolate chips, but used chopped, toasted pecans instead. I got so many requests from relatives that I have sent the link to this recipe more often than the one to my kids' pictures (it was a family crowd...)

This was absolutely delicious! Make sure you have and use the candy thermometer, though - it makes all the difference. Next time I'll probably garnish with a sprinkling of brown or powdered sugar instead of the chocolate chips - I found that they just made it hard to cut and didn't add much.

My first time to make this fudge but I will add to my Christmas repetoire. I used half dark and half light brown sugar, but am now intrigued to try with all dark. I added toasted pecans and it came out beautifully. Now, if I could just stopped snacking on it!

I learned a valuable lesson about marshmallows making this recipe: don't melt them to replace marshmallow sauce. It seems that all my local grocery stores got together in the same week and decided to stop stocking marshmallow cream. So i decided to go with the real thing. I could only get about 50 percent of the marshmallows needed to come unstuck from the pot. And I wore a small marshmallow goatee for the remainder of the preparations. But the recipe turned out great anyway. So if for some reason you have to do without the marshmallows in this recipe, you'll be fine. Also, if furniture or leathergoods need repairing around your home, you can always use melted marshmallow in place of industrial glue.

I have made this fudge for the past three years for the holidays and it always turns out great!

I have made this recipe a couple of time, each time with light brown sugar. It always turns out smooth and creamy. This recipe is a keeper in my book.

Okay, basic fudge, on the soft side as fudges go. A lot like that "See's Fudge" recipe that circulates, except with brown sugar. Crucial thing: pay attention to the uncoventional need to STIR this fudge as it reaches its target temperature. I didn't read closely and quickly ended up with a nasty burnt layer and undercooked syrup!

For High Altitude: I reduced the initial cook time to 8 minutes and then boiled until the thermometer read 215 (about 7 minutes). So far the consistency is MUCH better than the last batch. If the end product tastes as good as the bowl - this is a keeper!

The taste was good (used lt brown sugar) but it was a bit dry. I think it has to do with altitude but I'm not sure how to adjust the recipe. I will keep trying to experiment. Anyone have any suggestions please let me know.....

Pretty good for standard fudge. I still like the espresso chocolate fudge better. I'd make it again but I think I'll look for a new fudge recipe.

Good overall. Not the answer to "the only recipe I will ever use", but good. I added chopped walnuts to the mix and on top for added flavor and texture.

This turned out recipe turned out the best fudge I have ever made; it was delicious and had a wonderful smooth texture. It was pretty easy to make too.

Words can't describe how yummy this recipe is -- but I'll try! We loved the creamy, smooth, and non-grainy texture; the consistency is what it should be, not at all chalky, hard, or sugary. I made the mistake of using milk chocolate, which made the fudge have a more muted chocolate flavor. So I ended up having to add some cocoa powder to bring out more of a fudgy taste. It worked, but I will definitely use bittersweet chocolate next time. I sprinkled toasted pecans over the top instead of chocolate chips and used golden brown sugar instead of dark. Delicious! This is the best fudge recipe hands down!

The flavour of this fudge was lovely - chocolatey with strong brown sugar taste that was not overwhelmed by the chocolate. Mine turned out a little grainy - not as smooth as fudge should be, but I don't think it's the recipe. I took some to my office and my collegues all liked it (quite an unusual taste for them since fudge is not well-known in Greece) and my usually devoted-to-only-Greek-desserts fiance loved it! I took the cook from Duluth's suggestion about the brown sugar but changed it a bit - I used one cup dark and one cup light and it produced a very nice result.

This is simply wonderful fudge - like the kind you buy from a gourmet shop. I sprinkled mini M&M's on it for my children. It is slightly time consuming (standing stiring at the stove) but worth it. I didn't even have a candy thermometer at the time and used a meat thermometer and let the mercury rise to where I thought the right temp would be!

I gave this fudge as gifts over Christmas and my husband was addicted to the left overs! Great tasting and easy. A perfect combination.

Phenomenal.

My wife and I have made this recipe four times. Twice using dark brown sugar and twice using light brown sugar. We have found that using light brown sugar makes the fudge creamier and less "burnt" tasting. We highly recommend substiting the light for the dark.

delicious and fairly easy, as homemade fudges go. marshmallow creme is commonly marketed as fluff and can be found in 7.5 oz jars in the peanut butter aisle!

I haven't tried this recipe, but there's another "Creamy Brown Sugar Fudge" recipe on Epicurious that does not use marshmallow cream. I searched for marshmallow cream online to see if you could buy it via the internet, but didn't have any luck. Hope this helps.
