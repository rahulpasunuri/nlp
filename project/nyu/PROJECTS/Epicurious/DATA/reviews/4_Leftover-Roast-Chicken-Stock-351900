Following the recipe closely, I found that it made 13 cups (!) which I reduced to 10 cups. Since I was making this stock for chicken soup, I poached a bone-in, skin-on half chicken breast with the carcass, removing it, shredding it, and setting it aside after about 20 minutes. After straining the finished unseasoned stock, I added some small bow-tie pasta, o-ring pasta, broccoli, and julienned carrots, all of which were precooked. Then I froze three quarts of soup. Season with salt and pepper after defrosting and, if the pasta absorbs some of the liquid, add canned chicken broth to one's liking. This made a very good chicken soup.
