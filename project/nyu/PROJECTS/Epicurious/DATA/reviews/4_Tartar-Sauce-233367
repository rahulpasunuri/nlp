Very nice! We used more capers too.

Our favorite tartar sauce. I use half regular and half light mayo. We like additional lemon juice, and more capers, roughly chopped.

Great recipe. Made a few alterations to accomidate some food allergies - no sweet pickles and hot sauce. Even with veganaise it was still a hit - especially with my kids.
