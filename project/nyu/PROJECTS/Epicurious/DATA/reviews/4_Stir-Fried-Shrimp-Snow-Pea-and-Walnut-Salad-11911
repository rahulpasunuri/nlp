this is a tasty, very light summer salad. i thought it might need a little extra punch so added twice as much garlic and some red pepper flakes to the shrimp. after tasting it, it could have used even more. next time i'll double the shrimp and snow peas and use less watercress (it was a little bitter and overpowering). i would also top it with some toasted sesame seeds.

Easy and delicious. I nix the walnuts, endive and watercress and simply serve over rice. Always a hit with my family.

Very good. Nice textures and flavors. Next time I would add less salt because the shrimp are very salty.

Really lovely summer salad. I, too, used whatever amounts of shrimp and snow peas that I wanted. I doubled the garlic and skipped the watercress because there was enough stuff in the bowl. Very nice contrast of textures.

Tasty and light. I think it could use maybe some lightly toasted sesame seeds and at least a pound of shrim rather than just 1/2 a pound.

I was a little nervous about how this would taste but it was delicious! I doubled the amount of shrimp, walnuts, belgian endive and sauce. Ran out of white wine vinegar so used rice wine as well. Also, used sesame oil to cook the walnuts and snow peas. Pretty easy but there are multiple bowls to clean up after. Try it!

Light, satisfying, refreshing, easy, tossed all ingredients in a large white ceramic bowl. . . very attractive presentation. Will no doubt become a regular on our table espcially in the summer

I've made this recipe over and over again. It's great just the way it is, or spice it up with a some red pepper flakes. You won't be disappointed.
