I have the cookbook that contains this recipe and it is indeed 200 degrees centigrade (he is a London-based chef who I can't recommend enough), so cook at 400 F. I hope this helps!!!

This is one of the best treatments for eggplant! Wonderful flavor with elegant presentation. There's a misprint for the temp. Roasting eggplant requires a hot oven, so roast at 400F (as someone pointed out earlier, the 200 temp was probably meant for Centigrade, since the chef is in London)

I so wanted to love it. Visually it's beautiful. I think what some others have said must be true 400 degrees would be better. Mine tasted pretty raw. Also I served this for dinner with quinoa not an appetizer. With the amount of olive oil you are supposed to add it would be a 400+ calorie appetizer!

Simple to make and tasty. I love the sumac spice but the real star of this dish was the yogurt sauce.

So I found this recipe to be alright, but kind of on the bland side. Next time I think I'll add more garlic and maybe some more herbs. Also, because of the previous review saying it wasn't actually 200F, I looked up the original recipe and it actually says 350F... That seemed to work fine at 35 minutes.

it's not 200F - it must be 200C, around 400F. After 45 minutes at 200F, eggplant is still essentially raw. Delicious though.

Who would have thought a new way to amaze culinairs. As a retired Chef I congragulate you on your genius. Keep up the good work.

How is it possible that NO ONE has reviewed Yotam Ottolenghi's divine eggplant sent from heaven! It's my honor; first let me say that I live 100 yards from his small, densely packed epicurean cafe / takw away spot in Notting Hill, and I have blown a lot of money there. Worth every penny. This eggplant recipe is fab - and be altered in 1000 ways just by adding a sprinkle of this or that to the eggplant or the sauce; cumin, curry...or it's perfect as it. If there were one chef to follow on this website, it would be him! I hope he never moves to NYC...London would be so lost without his genius! PS his choco chip cookies are TDF.
