Delicious! I wasn't a fan of the vinaigrette when I tasted it by itself but it was delicious when I ate in the salad combined with the pear, walnuts and goat cheese (I used goat cheese because I don't like blue cheese). The salad was wonderful! I served it with some chicken breasts that I sautéed in a little bit of butter, honey and dijon.

I made this for company along with a roast leg of lamb and a spinach/ricotta pie. It was one of the best menus I've done in a long time! I forgot to buy lemons and had to sub with key lime juice that I had, and it was still terrific! Definitely a keeper.

Delectable. The lemon accents the blue cheese/pear/walnut combo perfectly. I saved time and used jarred pre-chopped shallot, great anyway!

Made this for Christmas dinner with only slight changes. Everyone loved it. The combination of textures was fantastic. I will definitely make it again. I made candied walnuts in place of toasted walnuts and used part walnut oil with the olive oil for added flavor. I made double the recipe and have used it on other salads. It was slightly oily; I would use less oil next time.

Well balanced flavors in this salad. The dressing is bright and goes well with a spicy green. I sautéed the shallots a little, roasted the pears and added some chopped turkey bacon which pulled all the flavors together.

I love this salad- it's super easy and delicious. I used Gormet's Candied Walnut recipe (but used pecans) and used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese. Also, to make a meal out of the salad, I made the Dijon Chicken Breasts recipe, thinly sliced the chicken and added to the salad. Yummy!

Wasn't a big hit at Thanksgiving. Next time I may try to sweeten the dressing a little with honey as someone else suggested.

This was very good! Served it followed by the Epicurious recipe for Pecan-Crusted Trout with Orange-Rosemary Butter Sauce, which is on this site & is a fabulous follow- up to this salad. I used pecans in the salad (just because that's what I had) and sauteed them in butter with a little sugar & finely crushed red pepper........kicked it up a notch!

Used honey roasted almonds instead of walnuts. Absolutely de-lish!

This is absolutely outstanding. We had some Royal Riviera pears from Harry and David that were out of this world, so that helped. The recipe is really perfect as is, though you might prefer a tad less dressing overall. The first time I made it, I caramelized half of the walnuts, and I also added a touch of sweetener to the dressing instead of just salt & pepper, because after I tasted it I thought it needed it. It didn't - the final product turned out too sweet with my wise-guy additions. Just follow the diretions as they are and you'll end up with a winner. I could eat this every day!!

Sorry. I forgot to mention in my previous review that my additions to the dressing were for double the recipe. Half-heimer's again.

For sake of picky eaters I used all romaine. Next time I will use half baby greens and half romaine for substance. I found the amount of fresh lemon juice to be overpowering so I changed the dressing by adding 2 T. light corn syrup and 2 T. honey and wisked in 1/3 c. light sour cream. Presentation would be even better with a few strategically placed raspberries or strawberries for color. Nice salad for a luncheon or first course dinner.

Delicious! I've made a variety of dressings with this including a rasberry vinaigrette and a walnut vinaigrette and they're all wonderful. I also love adding some fresh strawberries or cranberries.

This was a fabulous salad! It was so super easy. I even used a can of pre-cubed pears and just drained them and dumped them in with the dressing until I was ready to mix up the salad. The most work I did was to toast the walnuts. I'm already planning to make it again.

I have variations of this salad before, and this is definitely one of my favorites, especially being that I am a bleu cheese fanatic! I didn't have baby greens so I used baby spinach instead, and I took the advice of others here and candied the walnuts-delicious! I also added dried cranberries, which was an extra nice touch. Use the dressing sparingly-it can be a bit heavy. I had extra leftover for future use.

I have made this recipe only once but I can say with certainty that I will make it again, and again. It's simple to make but it will leave a strong taste memory. I didn't have enough ripe pear to match the recipe so I added apple but there were no complaints! It gave me the gratification that I desire as a hobby cook. Enjoy!

Made this for Christmas eve dinner with yummy comice pears - a huge hit. Dressing as written is oily and tasteless. I tossed it and made the shallot vinaigrette from Lukins/ Russo New Basics, which is an excellent dressing.

I made this salad for my husband and I and we enjoyed it very much. Very similar to others with the fruit, nuts, blue cheese and greens. I took others suggestions and carmelized the walnuts which was a step worth doing. I made it again for an informal dinner as an accompaniment to Hearty Veal Stew with Red Wine and Sweet Peppers (BA 10/200)and everyone loved the salad especially the dressing. The second time I didn't carmelize the walnuts and it was great anyway.

I like to sub killer (sweet and hot) pecans for the walnuts and add dried cherries. I think it then changes to a 4 fork recipe.

Truly 4 forks! The combo of pears, toasted walnuts and blue cheese is scrumptious. Served this several times, most recently last nite when I couldn't find the recipe so devised one from scratch, using 1/4 c lemon jc, 3 small shallots, 2 tsp dijon 1 tsp dry mustard and 1 tsp minced ginger, in addition to regular olive oil & thyme - very tasty.

We had this for Christmas brunch and enjoyed it. With the baby greens, it did need to be served ASAP--the salad wilted VERY quickly, but the flavor was marvelous. I had let the greens come to room temp...maybe if they were dressed and served chilled?

I agree with the balsamic lovers. Dijon mustard tasted a little strong for me. I might even try a light olive oil/lemonjuice/cidervinegar vinaigrette. I love pears/bleu cheese/walnut combo. it makes such a rich salad. It's a nice treat for the winter

Rating: 3
I thought the dressing was good as written. I love balsamic, but I think with sweet pears, you don't need the sugary taste of balsamic. Besides, don't you think the use of balsamic vinaigrettes and balsamic reductions and glazes is just getting a little "played-out?" It feels a little "90's" to me. Food for thought.

I made this salad last night for guests and I would say it was okay. The dressing was less than desirable. Next time I will use a balsamic vinegarette.

Great fall salad! A real keeper.

I made this salad for "Food Day" at work, and everyone loved it. I substituted toasted pecans for the walnuts and used a mandolin to slice my pears into julienne strips. Since I'm not known for my cooking, my co-workers were pleasantly surprised. Some even asked for the recipe.

To the cook on 10/22. The apple, dried cherry and maple salad was wonderful make sure to try it. I have made this salad for years and it is a staple on our house. My thought is you can NEVER go wrong with fruit, cheese and nuts on a salad.

I've made this salad twice now in a week (and plan to again in the near future), once with candied walnuts (thanks to suggestions in the review column) and once just plain nuts... the sweetness was such a great combination with the blue cheese and onion (I didn't have scallions so used green onions, also honey dijon mustard added an extra sweetness), and the combination of soft and crunchy was great too. Though I do agree this dressing is a bit too oily -- I'll have to try some of the dressings other reviewers graciously shared. This really does make for a great presentation and interesting tastes without being weird enough to turn off potentially picky guests... it's swiftly rising to the role of my favorite fall salad (and what my husband's dubbed a "show-off" salad). Very fun and refreshing recipe. Paired perfectly with a chilled bottle of Bonterra chardonnay, by the way.

I have also been making a version of this salad for years. I am not crazy about this dressing.. I use a balsamic vinegarette, poach the pears with vanilla, core them while warm,and place the cheese on top so it slightly melts... toasting the walnuts also adds a nice touch!!

I, too, have made this several times after first trying it at Blackhawk Lodge in Chicago, and guest love it. Like the other reviewers, I use the similar fruit/cheese/nut formula often. A favorite is greens with feta, Mandarin orange wedges, slightly-candied sliced almonds, and raspberry vinagrette.

I ate this salad in a restaurant last fall and re-created it at home. I poached my pears with a vanilla bean, and used just a little Cuisine Perel Late Harvest Reisling Vinegar and walnut oil instead of the vinaigrette. My friends loved it!

This dressing is too oily. I too have been making a similar salad for several years. Instead of mixed greens, I often use baby rocket. If I don't have pears, I use dried cranberries. Sometimes I crumble one piece of fried pancetta over each serving of pear salad. Simply dress it with Cuisine Perel's Black Fig Vinegar, no additional oil.

Baby greens, fruit and a tart cheese are now a favorite of mine.......I used this recipe last night for company, used what I had on hand, red skinned pears, slivered Asiago cheese, and toasted pecans and a bottled (wonderful from Trader Joes) rasberry fat free dressing. Not a lot of dressing used, helps keep salad crisp.........Patti from Willow Glen

Baby greens combine so beautifully with nuts, cheese, and a fruit in a nice vinaigrette. My favorite is toasted piune nuts or pecans, crumbled goat cheese or shaved pecorino romano, and either sliced pears, nectarines, or fresh figs. This is an interesting version but way too much dressing for the quantity of greens and fruit. I would cut back to 3 tbs of the oil and follow proportionately on the other ingredients.

I really enjoyed this recipe, although I used walnut oil and walnut mustard instead of the olive oil and dijon. I didn't add as much oil as the recipe called for, but I did put a little more lime juice. It came out really good with these alterations. Since I wanted to make this as a main dish, I grilled chicken breasts in olive oil and walnut mustard so I added these on top of the greens, blue cheese and pears. I almost forgot! I also caramelized the walnuts with sugar, cinammon and anise to give it a spice.

I saw a recipe similar to this one that included two other things. First, there was some balsamic in the dressing (big plus). And, you take the blue cheese and mix it with a little bit of soft butter and spread it on crouton toasts. Both of these were very good additions.
