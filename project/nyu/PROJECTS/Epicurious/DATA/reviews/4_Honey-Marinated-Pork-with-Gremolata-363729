Maybe it was me, but the gremolata was far too acidic, too gravelly and really didn't add anything to the recipe. The pork with the marinade was excellent.

I made this for the first time this evening. Hubby and college aged son thought this was superb. Loved it!! I don't know when I've made anything as easily and delicious. I even used dried herbs b/c it's January and I'm not paying for herbs that normally grow every year in my garden. Had 1.5 lb of tenderloin and I made the whole recipe for sauce; am glad I didn't cut it back.

Delicious! Everyone loved it!!! Added benefit ... It was vey quick and easy. Did not make the gremolata .... added the herbs to the sauce when cooking down; sauce was a wonderful addition, though the pork was tender and flavorful without as well (as noted by a picky 11 year old friend of my son's). Will absolutely make this again!!!

I liked this quite a lot. I pretty much stayed to the recipe, though like some others I marinated it overnight. I also accidentally sprinkled the gremolata over the pork *before* I put it in the oven, and frankly think that was a fortuitous mistake.

Great recipe... most tender pork tenderloin I have ever made. The only variation I did was to marinate the pork in a plastic bag. The gremolata was the perfect finish.

Excellent recipe though I definitely think the pork needs to marinate for at least 24-36hrs for optimal results. I had never had a gremolata before and loved the freshness it added.

Thought it was just ok...tasted mostly sweet and orangey from the zest and honey...didn't taste the herbs that much unfortunately :-( It's wasn't bad, just not as superb as the reviews made it seem...

Yum. The whole family liked it and it was easy to make. The gremolata is optional - the dish is still great without it.

I made this exactly by the recipe and it was so easy and so awesome!

This pork was good, but not great in my opinion. The marinade burned in the pan (due to the honey)despite having it on medium heat, which gave the sauce a slightly burnt flavor. Next time I will make sure most of the marinade drains off the pork before adding it to the pan, or just cook it with salt and pepper without marinating it and use the sauce just for drizzling. My favorite easy pork tenderloin recipe is still the Pork Tenderloin with Maple Glaze (Bon Appetit, October 2000), it's very simple as well and has tons of flavor.

I have never cooked pork before as my husband always said he didn't like it... well, he RAVED about this recipe! Made with boneless porkchops (which cut down the cooking time). Skipped the gremolata (fresh herbs in winter? Expensive!) and just mixed the zest and dried herbs into the sauce when I started reducing. I also added some lemon juice to the marinade as my oranges were very sweet and not very tangy. Very good recipe!

Delicious. (that's what 3 forks means...) The pork had excellent flavor. We prefered the sauce to the gremolata, though we did use it... I thickened the sauce a little with cornstarch... altogether, very nice.

I needed to speed this recipe up, so here's what I did. 1. Cut the tenderloin into chunks so the meat would marinate more quickly. 2. Made kebabs on wooded skewers alternating the pork chunks, red and green pepper slices, chunks of onion and whole mushrooms. Broiled 'em. Good way to stretch the recipe and take care of the veggie course. 3. Served the kebabs on a bed of couscous dribbled with the gremolata. I did not change a single ingredient in the recipe. Looked gorgeous, tasted fabulous. Gonna make it again and again all year 'round.

It was the best yet of meat dinners I've done in a long while. Outstanding.

Even with the prep, this is pretty darn easy and you get a meal that is nice to look at and delicious to eat. Mine was a little sweeter than I like because I marinated it too long. The sauce and gremolata are a must.

This was a very easy and DELICIOUS recipe. You do have some prep (chilling for a couple of hours), but otherwise it's a very simple recipe. The orange in the gremolata is what really made it for me.

Excellent! Made as directed but only marinated 3 hours. The pork, sauce and gremolata was an excellent combination. Only wish it made more sauce. Might have to double next time. This is a KEEPER! Yum.

OUTSTANDING! I marinated overnight and used dried herbs instead of fresh (it was what I had), and just added them to the sauce at the last second. I'm sure a "real" gremolata would have been even better, but this was out of this world!!!

Terrific! I used 1 pork tenderloin (2 adults, 1 kidlet) and we dispatched the entire thing. I halved the sauce (but wished I hadn't) and marinated it for 7 hours. I didn't bother with the gremolata but the sauce was so good I'm not sure we missed anything. The pork went from 142 degrees to 153 in a hot second and it was a bit overcooked as a result. Next time I'll be more careful, but there WILL be a next time. This was great.

Not a morsel left(one tenderloin for two people, but made the full amount of marinade/sauce). I served this with sweet/sour red cabbage.

Home run. Easy and delicious. Even my picky six-year old liked it. Made it exactly according to the recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. I can't believe how good it was considering how easy it was to make and I can't wait to have it again. I served it with some jasmine rice which soaked up some of the extra sauce and it was fantastic. I want to make it with everything too, chicken, shrimp and even vegetables. Yum!!

This was: EASY to do DELICIOUS to eat BEAUTIFUL to look at SOPHISTICATED to serve. Served with Rainbow Chopped Salad and fingerling potatoes. Everyone raved.

Oh. My. God. This was ridiculously, weeknight- easy, but absolutely fit for a fancy dinner party. Gorgeous and scrumptious. Mine looked exactly like the photo. Husband raved and raved, 4 year old devoured his. The sauce is divine, hubby wants to put it on everything now. I only marinated mine for 30 minutes in the vacuum-seal container, can't imagine how great it would be if I had marinated it the day before, like they suggest. Don't know if it made any difference but I used a cast-iron skillet. Served with brussels sprouts, fingerling potatoes, and a orange & almond salad. Home run!
