I used crunchy peanut butter, tamari, honey, ketchup, cayenne, no orange (had none), and substituted ground ginger as I was out of fresh. I wanted to cook some tempeh I had purchased, actually, but ended up using half a block of tofu as well because there was only 8 ounces of tempeh. It was tasty, but I prefer the tofu (tempeh is so expensive anyway). I used aluminum foil to cover my baking dish. I forgot to grease it but it was fine. I love the versatility in choice of ingredients, and since I am always looking for ways to cook tofu, I will try variations of this in the future. I had cut the tofu and tempeh into sticks beforehand but won't do that again; I'll cut it into slabs or "steaks" so that turning the pieces over is quick.
