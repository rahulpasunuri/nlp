This was great. I felt it was better than some I have had in restaurants. I made the sauce as well but thought the roll stood on its own as well. The flavoring of the noodles in the recipe was what took it there for me. I did not think I would like the mango mix but I was completely surprised how much I enjoyed that flavor in the context of the other ingredients in this recipe.

Very nice summer roll recipe. Flavouring the noodles makes the difference. All the portions are good except you don't need an entire cucumber! One third of an english cuke did the trick for me. I have made this twice. First time was exactly as written, second with a few modifications. Second time I only used the mint, no cilantro and used mock crab meat instead of shrimp. I also made a spicy peanut sauce. The combo with the sweetness of the crab/roll with the peanut sauce was excellent. Very light and refreshing appetizer. I made the peanut sauce the night before and the rolls in the morning of the party. Came together very quickly. Was done in an hour. Being comfortable rolling is the trick. Enjoy!

Loved this as written. Love the sauce; wow! I can't believe all the comments about there being so much cutting to do. There are really only three things to cut; cucumber, scallions, and mango. Is that really that hard/time consuming? Seemed to go very quickly for me.

Really good, I need to just practice rolling so they look as nice as they do in the pic. I didn't have all the ingredients and it was delish so I can imagine it's perfection if I had everything. Nice and fresh!

Delicious and easier than expected. The proportions are off - too much mango and cucumber.

The rolls were delicious, although very time consuming to cut everything. -1 fork because I really didn't like the dipping sauce, it was way too sour and fishy.

wow, wow, wow! This was amazing. I have a mandoline, which helped cut up most of the veggies (my mango was too soft so it didn't cut well). Didn't take too long with the mandoline. Made the sauce exactly as written. Both my husband and I love this and plan on making regularly.

This was a rockin dinner. I made everything in advance and served it like a salad bar and part of the fun was putting it together at the table. I would probably use a little less fish sauce in the dipping sauce but other than that, wouldn't change a thing. Great for a light fun meal in summer.

A lot of work to get everything cut up, but worth it. Delicious (including the dipping sauce, which some reviewers didn't like-I thought it was fresh and light). I couldn't find rice paper rounds anywhere, but I did find tapioca paper rounds, which worked well, and which I later found out are a common substitute for rice paper.

Delicious and Fresh...perfect summer brunch item.

I was very please but note the substituion for mint with basil. These went over well with a group. Do a test run before preparing them for a party. Next time, I plan to increase the amount of mango and sprinkle the herbs randomly in a way that is visually interesting once rolled.

These are amazing - the different flavors complement each other so well. (I am glad I chose the recipe with mango aa the tangyness really adds to the overall effect). I made these for my dad's birthday (he's filipino and can't eat the traditional filipino egg rolls any longer due to the salt and fat) and everyone LOVED them. the only down side? The prep time. I would only make these again if I had a mandolin!

While I liked the flavor of this dish, I did not like the prep, so I won't make it again (especially since I can get a comparable dish at neighborhood restaurants--albeit, with a new respect for the work involved!). Be sure to julienne the vegetables per the instructions--any bigger and you'll struggle with rolling, as I did.

I made these last night for an Asian- themed dinner at a friend's house. Another friend made a very similar summer roll with shrimp, noodles, mint, cukes, etc. and it was interesting to compare the two. First, I used holy basil instead of mint and really liked that combo better than mint/cilantro. I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer who said that soaking the noodles in the vinegar/sugar mix adds depth to the recipe. My friend's rolls had plain noodles and didn't taste as good. Also, I used avocado in some rolls (per another review) and enjoyed the savory flavor and buttery texture they add. Finally, the dipping sauce in this recipe is perfect - a peanut sauce (also on hand last night) covers the flavors too much for my taste. Fun to make and very easy to modify with your favorite ingredients and flavors.

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe. Simple, though time consuming, even with good knife skills. The rice paper rounds take a while to get used to. If it's your first time using them, I'd make extra filling so you can practice getting the roll nice and tight. (These test rolls taste equally good, however.) Next time, I'll make a peanut/chili sauce to go with this.

I swapped some avocado for the mango... just because I had it and didn't have mango. I also served this with a ponzu sauce. It was quite wonderful.

Delicious recipe, the accompanying sauce is good, a Thai peanut sauce goes well too. Didn't change anything and got rave reviews from my guests. My husband helped with the prep (julienning veggies, etc)and it was a solid 2 hours of prep time.

This was a great recipe. I liked the fact that the recipe instructions included seasoning the rice noodles before wrapping it up. It adds an added dimension of flavour, which generally I find lacking when having these at Vietnamese restaurants. It was a very good balance in texture and taste with the coriander, mint and bean sprouts that I used. I did not bother using the cucumber or scallions as directed. Also, I used the peanut dipping sauce from the Vegetable Summer Rolls recipe found on this site. This is one of those recipes where you can easily add and subtract items to taste.

Rating: 4
LOVED THIS! And, despite what other reviewers have said, I really liked the dip that came with the recipe. Give it a try... I did add a drop of chile oil to give it a kick and a bit more lime juice. Overall, very easy for the quality of taste that you end up with!

Rating: 3
Great flavor! I used the Vietnamese dipping sauce recipe from the Shrimp Rice Paper Rolls (another tasty dish)and at other times used Spicy Peanut Sauce (omitted mangoes)- both recipes on this site. I've also made my own dipping sauce: 1/3 cup each of lime juice, patis or fish sauce and water, 1 1/2 T sugar, 1 garlic clove, 2 siling labuyo or red Thai bird chiles, 1 T unseasoned rice vinegar, shredded carrots. Complements the rolls beautifully!

This came out great even though it is a lot of prep work. I followed the recipe but did not make the sauce due to others' comments about it. I made a spicy peanut sauce which worked out well. I will make this over and over again.

Rating: 4
Yum, yum, yum! What a wonderful and simple recipe. I actually prefer it without the mango sticks as I feel they make the rolls a bit too sweet. Definitely be sure to keep the rolls sanwiched between damp paper towels to stop them from drying out. Stored this way in a tupperware container I was able to make them the day before a party and they were still perfect.

I've made this recipe several times and thought I would pass on my discoveries: First, I bought a package of summer roll wrappers at our local Asian market. They were extremely difficult to use and it took hours to make these rolls but they were so good I decided to make them a 2nd time. I bought another package and was surprised to find out that they were very different than the first package, and extremely easy to use. When I compared the ingredient list on the two packages, I found out that although they both said "Summer Roll Wrappers", the first package was made with wheat and the second (easy) package was made with rice. I know the recipe calls for rice but I don't read Vietnamese and the small print on the package in English is too small to ready. Second, I make a fabulous sweet/hot dipping sauce of 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup white vinegar, bring to a boil, simmer for 5 minutes and set aside to cool. To cooled mixture add 2 heaping tablespoons of chili garlic paste, 2 - 3 thinly sliced bird chilis, and about 5 juliened mint leaves. It's not too hot and the mint is very complimentary to the rolls. Third, the original summer roll recipe is very flexible. I made a variation that I call Cowboy Rolls made with grilled, cooled and thinly sliced sirloin, gorgonzola cheese, pickled red onions (recipe below), arugula, and wasabi mayonnaise (2 tsp wasabi to 1/2 c. mayo). Make sure the wasabi mayo is on the inside of the ingredients otherwise it soaks through the rice paper wrapper. For pickled onions, slice 1 large or 2 small red onions 1/4" thick, sprinkle with kosher salt and let sit for 20 mins., rinse well and dry. Mix 1 cup red wine vinegar, 3 tablespoons sugar and 1/2 tsp. pepper and add onions. Let sit for one hour and use, or refrigerate for up to a week.

i've also made this with crab meat in place of shrimp; this is delicious either way!

This is by far one of my favorite recipe's - so fresh & healthy. Since I have easy access to Asian groceries, I buy pre-made sauce de poisson with carrots, peppers, fish sauce. Learning to roll them takes time, definitely underfill them to make it easier. I bought a Borner V-Slicer to julienne the vegetables, the matchsticks, so prep time goes much quicker.

FANTASTIC! Great rolls, I'll make them again and again. I wouldn't use the dipping sauce suggested in this recipe -- try something lighter with a hint of sweetness. I used a lime based sauce with a little fish sauce, sugar and cilantro.

Made this a few times...the first time I followed the directions exactly. Didn't care for the dipping sauce. Now I use the vietnamese dipping sauce on Martha Stewart and it works great! I agree, no need to count match sticks etc. Also, I think they over list the ingredient but I always have tons of veggies left over!

Rating: 4
Delicious! The blending of the flavors with the herbs and mango was fantastic. I wouldn't worry too much about counting matchsticks though. Made another simple dipping sauce - light soy sauce, rice wine vinegar with some of the julienned scallions.

Perfect! We use sweet chili sauce for dipping instead. Beware, the insides get soggy after a couple hours, I would not recommend making them ahead. I have made these half a dozen times, always a hit.

I served these at our annual Memorial Day get together. They were an unqualified hit. I used a Thai-style peanut sauce rather than the one recommended here, though. I made this sauce and tasted it, and decided it was too strong and would over-power the delicate flavors of the summer rolls. With a milder sauce, they were heavenly.

Rating: 4
This dish was very labour-intensive but well worth the effort! I would make it again esp. in the summer... as I tried to cheat the season by making it in cold, cold early March. I did make the rolls several hours before they were served and they kept very well as suggested- however, they don't last very well for the next day (esp. with the slimy way a mango tends to go).

This is an excellent version of these "fresh rice rolls". One tip: With the rice papers, I just dip them in warm water (not soak) then let the wet papers rest stacked with wet paper towels in between. After a few minutes, they are ready for rolling. On another note, there are many variations you can make as well. First, try offering a couple different dipping sauces: (1) the dipping sauce recipe here but with some chili sauce (sambal ooleck) and grated carrot, and (2) a Thai peanut sauce (I make one with peanut butter, crushed unsalted peanuts, garlic, shallots, red curry paste, sugar). Also, feel free to vary the ingredients: I use a marniated tofu instead of shrimp for a veggie version, or try homemade Thai sausage or Chinese "duck" sausage, shredded poached chicken, smoked duck breast, or crab-leg (try to keep in a single piece). For a Japanese-style variation, use sushi rice instead of rice noodles along with sliced raw seared ahi tuna, cucumber, avocado, and some wasabi & pickled ginger. Then offer a wasabi mayo or soy-based dipping sauce. Once you get used to the rice wrappers, you'll want to come up with all kinds of ideas for stuffing and rolling these things. Just make sure to keep the prepared rolls covered with a damp cloth until serving time; otherwise they dry out and can get somewhat "chewy"

I have made these several times and they've always been a big hit. I leave out the mint, and use a peanut-garlic dipping sauce instead.

Maybe the problem was making these in November but they just didn't wow me. The presentation is impressive, and they are very refreshing. But for the 1-2 hours I spent making them, they were just average. I agree that the fishy smell of the dipping sauce is an issue. It tasted fine but perhaps cutting the fish sauce and substituting...soy or something would be better.

Just a suggestion for the rolling process: I take one "wafer" out of the water at a time, place it on a paper towel and then another paper towel on the top to absorb most of the water. It makes it a lot easier to roll tight...and they stay rolled tight. Hope this helps.

This is a great recipe. As most people have noted, the rolling is tough. I thought mine were rolled too loose, but surprisingly they held together and people commented on how well I had done with the rolling. It takes forever, but it's worth it!

Wow - this is a keeper - so light and refreshing in this heat! Great flavors. I played with the sauce a bit as i thought it fishy. Also, i used frozen, cooked shrimp (50/lb.). Made prep. faster and easier with great results. Also, i soaked the rice paper to just before it got too soft as the liquid from noodles/veggies etc. softened it fully and was less likely to fall apart. The rolls look more authentic if the shrimp are placed near the end of rolling with the mint so they can be seen through the rice paper.

I used egg roll wrappers and fried the rolls one-half minute per side; also modified the dipping sauce by adding 1.5 t ginger, 2T water, 2t sugar and 1T rice wine vinegar. Fabulous. Hard to stop eating!!

Takes some practice to get the rolling right, but you have enough wrappers to make mistakes and start over. Went over well with guest. You just have to assure them that the dipping sauce tastes good (sometimes they find fish sauce funny smelling)

First was a trip to the Japanese market for a few of these items, what fun!!! Prepping for this dish takes most of the hour and a half then voila! It all came together rather quickly although it took a few go-rounds before I mastered the rolling process. I used a regular cucumber vs seedless, I just used a spoon to remove the seeds, worked out fine. On the side I served gingered jasmine rice, fresh spinach salad(poured a bit of hot saki over leaves just to wilt them a bit then added sesame oil, fresh squeezed orange, toasted sesame seeds and s&p. For dessert, green tea cake w/ fresh mango on the side and hot tea. I'll pull this meal out again for my next dinner party! Smackdillyicious!

I really liked the way this recipe provided a base for making rolls very similar to those I've eaten in Vietnamese restaurants. I would suggest using a peanut dipping sauce instead of the fish sauce, as the latter is usually better with the fried imperial rolls. Start with the largest rice paper rounds you can find, it'll make it a lot easier to roll them with all of the goodies inside. I didn't use mango, and I did include slices of fish cake, which tasted really good. I also didn't use the cucumber and I included lettuce.

Although I haven't tried this recipe, I can tell it will be delicious. This is similar to what is called Spring Rolls...same technique but slightly different ingredients. A recommendation on the rice paper; test one before automatically doubling, otherwise you get a mouthful of the rice paper versus the fillers! However, if you must reinforce, try using 1 1/2 and wet only one side since it is very thin.

A great combination of filling for rolls, I used more shrimp though. The sauce was a little bland, so I added soya sauce, Thai chili sauce, a few drops of sesame oil, some fresh cilantro, and wizzed it all in a small food processor. Totally refreshing. Cut them in 3 for hors d'oeuvres, guests can just dip and enjoy.

These were very good, and surprisingly close to what I've had in restaurants. The rice-paper rounds were a little hard to find -- in the dry noodle section not fresh like won tons.

I would definitely make these again, but with some adjustments. For the same amount of filling ingredients, with perhaps a few extra shrimp, I would make 12 rather than 8 rolls. It would make the rice paper easier to roll and the rolls easier to handle for eating. If the shrimp are very large, I think they should be cut into quarters lengthwise, instead of into halves. Dampened paper towels to cover the rolls is not such a good idea. The paper towel tends to stick to the rice paper. A dampened linen napkin or tea towel works much better. Lastly, I would not dilute the dipping sauce with water. Although I haven't tried it without the water, the flavours of the fish sauce and lime juice just did not come through well enough. In fact, with the leftover rolls we had, I served little bowls of fish sauce and soy sauce and we mixed the two together to suit our own tastes. We enjoyed that much more.

Rating: 4
I make something similar but with grilled chicken and basil leaves. Yummy! Once you have the technique down, it's easy and fairly quick, and the veggies don't need to be cut as thinly. One key "trick" is to double up the rice paper wrappers. Use two and they're a lot less likely to tear.

My mother-in-law is Asian and makes these all the time.
