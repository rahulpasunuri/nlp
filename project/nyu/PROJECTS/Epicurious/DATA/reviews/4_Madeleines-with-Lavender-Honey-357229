In response to the previous reviewer, LClarke, I tried mine with self-rising flour instead of all-purpose flour and they rose nicely. I tested the self-rising flour becase I saw it used in another madeleine recipe. Good Luck!

I think these are very good, but I didn't give them 4 forks because they are too sweet. Also, they didn't have a very pronounced "bump" that are typical of Madeleines. I'm not sure what changes would make the bump appear. I will try them again with less sugar. Very easy to make (especially since I have almond flour handy).

I agree with the reviewer above that these were really sweet - too sweet for me. But the texture was just right! I tried another recipe with whole eggs and flour... and decided to come back to this one. Anyone have any suggestions for how to tweak the recipe to use less powdered sugar? Also, what do you all think about adding some orange zest?

Thank you for this delicious recipe ! It is perfect for a snack with friends. I aslo tested a recipe from Lenôtre, a famous French pastry Chef. It is a vanilla and honey recipe you can find on http://www.bestoffrenchfood.com/recip es/1124-vanilla-and-honey-madeleine- lenotre-recipe.html. Bon appétit !

I made these cake like cookies with my granddaughter and they were wonderful. It was extremely easy and quick to make. Since my granddaughter is 10, it was a perfect recipe for her to learn.

Absolutely delicious! I used lavender honey but couldn't taste the lavender very much. I think next time, I might just add a pinch of salt. I did a batch with the metal pan and a batch with the silicone pan. I liked the metal pan more as the ridges came out more distinct.

The texture is great, but it's VERY sweet (there is more powdered sugar than flour and almond meal combined!) and the lavender honey aromas don't come out as much as I expected. The madeleines stuck in the pan and had to be peeled out; this may be my fault because I buttered but didn't flour the mold before putting the batter in.

These were wonderful! I used wildflower honey, because I couldn't find any lavendar honey, even at a so-called Provencal market in Chicago. I then made it a never ending quest, and found some at a reasonable price in the Borough Market while on trip to London. I'll try it again.

These Madeleines were great. Very simple to make. I, too, ground up some almonds and that was fine. I halved the recipe and it yielded about 40 mini Madeleines that were devoured by my family. Cooking time was about 6 minutes. I will definitely try again. I think I will try the full sized ones next time.

These were absolutely delicious, and such an easy recipe. I could not find lavender honey, so I substituted acacia honey. I made these wonderful fluffy cookies one weekend night, and my husband and I consumed both batches by the next afternoon. I found myself craving them all week, so I made them again.

Fantastic flavor! If you haven't had Lavender Honey before, it does make a HUGE difference. Unfortunately, it is also pretty expensive, as in $16 for a 7 oz jar. I use Mitica Wild Lavender Honey. Super floral, delicious in tea! I serve these at brunches!

Pretty good! My only problem was that the madeleines had a slightly hard honey edge and I had a bit of trouble with them sticking to the pan the first time around.

I found this recipe better than the others which use whole eggs and flour. I too could not find the lavender honey and used orange blossom in one batch and a high end honey in the other. I didn't taste a difference. This is a great treat and easy to make.

These were very easy to make, and they had excellent texture and flavor. I used wildflower honey. I also used blanched almonds, which I finely ground in my mini-Cuisinart, instead of the almond meal.

Delicious! I used orange blossom honey. Will definitely make again!
