I used farro instead of rice and it was excellent - I love farro and am always looking for new ways to use it. The suggested ratio on the package is 1 to 3, so I used 1 cup with 2 1/2 cups of beef broth and 1/2 cup dry vermouth (out of white), and of course it has to simmer about twice as long, but the texture and taste were great. Next time I will cut the broth by about 1/4 cup because it was a bit too soupy, even after the farro was done. I also used an extra clove of garlic,and probably more than the recommended amounts of feta and tomatoes (diced grape). I only had about 16 oz or less of spinach, but will use way more next time.

This is a very simple dish that almost anyone would like, although there is nothing exciting about it. Good way to make use of spinach and tomatoes.

This was so yummy and flavorful! That said, I must confess that I tweaked the recipe a bit. I used all chicken broth and no wine, only 1/2 cup of feta, and probably had about 12-14 oz. of spinach rather than 20 (but it was plenty spinach-y...I wonder if 20 oz would have been *too* spinach-y for me?). This is a very flavorful side dish to go with a simply roasted chicken. For me, it could stand alone as an entree.

Excellent dish: easy to make, delicious and nutritious. I used 1 16 oz bag of chopped frozen spinach ( instead of fresh), and also put extra 1/2 cup of tomatoes,and a small bunch of chopped flat leaf parsley. Pungeant/acidic domestic or bolgarian feta goes best in this dish.

I didn't have white rice so I made this with quinoa. I was also out of white wine - I think the wine would add some nice complexity, but it was still good without. I added some kalamata olive, and a little spritz of lemon juice just before serving. Delicious! I will make this again.

I first made this for my boyfriend in 2000. This is also my favorite rice dish for our three children which we've had since then. The flavours are beautiful and they meld with each other so well. TAKE NOTE: There will NEVER be leftovers so double it cause it is just as good cold. I have never changed a thing and I am a MAJOR recipe tweeker. You'll be so happy to have this in your rotation.

I made this recipe to take to a friends home for dinner. I made it per the recipe and it turned out great. We had it with Barbecued Salmon and it was delicious! Everyone asked for the recipe. It will be a staple of mine!

I used brown rice and didn't initially change the volume of the liquid. I realized it after I added the spinach so the timing was off. I liked the brown rice's taste with it and the flavors of all the other ingredients. Also, I did not put the tomatoes in the pot because my husband doesn't like tomatoes so I added some to my serving, I acutally liked it better without the tomatoes. I didn't quite add the total amount of feta, but 3/4 of a cup seemed to be plenty. Will definitely enjoy the leftovers.

I made a good variation of this with what I had on hand: already-cooked, frozen light brown rice; sake; frozen spinach; canned plum tomatoes. I added oregano and ate with salmon fillet. Yum!

Made this with the Greek Chicken and Mushroom recipe from this site. It paired very well, I thought. I did add about 1/2 cup lightly toasted pine nuts. Other than that, I made the recipe as printed as was quite pleased with the results. I'll keep this one in my recipe files to make again.

very nice recipe for an easy dinner. I used equal parts whole wheat couscous and stock and deglazed the pan before adding the couscous to evaporate the wine, then very lightly sauteed the spinach before addig the broth and couscous. also squeezed a little lemon over at the end.

I do suggest using only a quarter cup of wine, otherwise it's too overpowering. And certainly no beef broth but chicken broth or vegetable broth. And some black olives. I think this recipe has some Greek/Turkish influences, which I like.

I substituted a combination of concentrated lamb stock, red wine, juice from canned tomatos and a little red wine for the broth/white wine. I also added rosemary and a cinnamon stick. I followed the rest of the recipe -- using brown wild rice, frozen spinach and cananed diced tomatoes. We loved the final dish -- served with lamb chops. I was trying for a quick lamb stifado and it was delicious. (My apologies to all of those who review recipes with multiple subsitutions -- I tend to like those reviews for the ideas.)

This was AMAZING!!! One of the best recipes by far that I have tried from this website. I used short grain white rice, because it was all I had, 16 oz of frozen spinach (wrung out), pine nuts, and strawberry tomatoes. Absolutely delicious. I wanted to steal the pot away from my family and eat it all on my own!

I made this dish for a Greek/Mediterranean themed dinner party and it was a big hit. As the Toronto cook suggested, I made the recipe the night before, then right before serving I added the tomatoes, feta, and some toasted pine nuts. I used long grain brown rice and veggie stock. The first time I made this, I used a mixture of fresh and frozen spinach. I made a mistake and didn't chop the fresh spinach, so it was kind of stringy. The next time, I used organic chopped frozen spinach and I liked it much more. So, be sure to chop the spinach if you use fresh. The flavor of this is great with any kind of grilled fish or chicken. I'll make this again and again.

Good foundation, but can be much improved with a few tweaks: 1) use bowties (farfalle) instead of rice 2) use medium heat to saute the spinach. If you use high heat, the spinach will dry up too quickly and become sour 3) throw in some hot pepper flakes 4) wait until you've got about 3 minutes left with the pasta before you put in the feta. Heating up the cheese breaks down some of the lipo-protein bonds and changes the taste of the feta. Also, be sure to taste your feta before you use it. This will help you adjust when salting. 5) Sprinkle a little fresh parmigiano over it and enjoy!

not bad, but nothing spectacular. I took long-grain rice as suggested, but it may benefit from using arborio instead, making it more risotto-like. Needs a bit of tweaking I think.

I used only one bag of spinach and omitted the tomatoes and it was fantastic. I used one reviewer's advice and prepared it 24 hours in advance and it was more flavorful than the first day.

I love this dish! I make it a lot. I always double the recipe, since it goes fast, and tastes even better the next day. I've used it for potlucks - it's great hot or at room temprature - for special, elegant meals, and for everyday. I've added Greek oregano at the last minute, which is great, too. It does go great with the Greek Chicken and Mushrooms suggested originally, also with shrimp, fish, lamb (oh, yeah!) or, really, ANY meat. Just a great all around recipe. Everywhere I take it I get asked for the recipe. In fact, I couldn't find my copy of it so I had to come here to get it - so I thought I'd add my two cents. If it isn't full of flavor and texture, you're not making it right. Although it is almost impossible to mess this up. Use fresh ingredients if you can, but don't be limited. A very forgiving recipe. Enjoy!

This was one of those disappointing recipes when all the ingredients are wonderful, but the combination is a failure. I had been looking forward to making this; it seemed really appealing. But the flavors fell flat and the consistency was gloppy. There were ample leftovers, which almost never happens in my house with rice dishes, spinach, or anything with feta.

Yummy, but too oniony. My vote is use all the spinach, it cooks down to nothing, but use less onion, otherwise the flavor takes over. Add pine nuts, if you can, they create a nice counterpoint to the other textures. And add just a touch of salt if you are using a low-salt or unsalted broth.

A local restaurant makes a side dish called "Greek Rice" that is so similar to this, so I was happy to stumble upon it. I added toasted pine nuts to this recipe to give it a little oomph. Really enjoyed it with the Greek-style chicken. The two sort of need one another,like all good relationships, along with some crusty bread, and a Greek salad. We'll definitely have this again.

This is an excellent dish. I subbed brown rice to make it heartier and used veggie broth instead of chicken. The brown rice took 10 minutes of sauteeing and 40 minutes of cooking in the broth, so it was not quite a quick meal, but was so delicious with all of the flavors melding perfectly. The tomatoes--picked from the garden--cut the saltiness of the cheese. A wonderful way to use spinach (and wine!).

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. There weren't enough left-overs the next day for everyone to have some, so I gave in to the begging and made some more. It is so quick and easy to make that it wasn't a strain to do that. One word--I didn't have low-salt chicken broth, so used regular the first time. It really was too salty. The next day I used water with a better result, although the chicken broth itself adds to the complexity of the flavor as one other reviewer mentioned.

This dish was easy and came together great. I've made it twice and loved it both times. For those thinking there is too much liquid, I think you need to watch the times on all rice dishes. Every stove I've ever had cooks rice at a different time. The liquid in this recipe is the standard 2-to-1 ratio so I can't see how it's a problem.

Rating: 2
I made this because it more or less fit what I had on hand. I only had 2/3 of a bag of spinach, maybe less, so I added broccoli cut up pretty small a few minutes before the spinach. I think the recipe calls for a bit too much liquid. I think the broccoli probably helped the dish texture wise. All in all, it was a nice supper. I had it as a main dish. If I find myself at suppertime with these ingredients, I'd probably do it again, tinkering with it a little to see if I couldn't dry it out a little. It's an attractive dish. Probably needs some good black olives as a garnish.

I'm giving this one "four forks" simply because of its ease, without compromising flavor, and it requires absolutely no modifications - the balance of tastes is perfect!
