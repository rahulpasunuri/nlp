Really nice flavors blend so well. This is one of my favorite Mex recipes.

Fantastic and flavorful. My (normally vegetable averse) husband and I both loved it. Made the following adjustments: - half can of chipotle peppers (instead of the child powder) - 3 garlic cloves I marinated for 3 hours. Wonderful flavor, and the heat from the chipotle ended up being fairly mild, but imparted a deeper flavor. Will make again!

my FAVORITE fajita recipe. It is SO easy and SO quick to prepare, and the flavor is just amazing. I make this so often in the summertime, I also add shredded cheese and sour cream to it, it's great!

Great recipe, though took us north of 45 minutes to prepare, what with saucing, chopping, preparing sides, etc...

If there were a 3.5 rating I'd give this that. Simple, fairly quick, and very satisfying. Great dish, even using a broiler (it's winter and I'm not BBQing outside :P).

This was wonderfully tasty and I would recommend to anyone. I didn't have poblano chiles to hand, so I sliced up a jalapeno instead. I didn't puree the marinade either, and I cooked everything in a frying pan with satisfactory results.

This is a nice quick dinner - fresh limes perk it up! Served with brown rice and blackbeans, cilantro and fresh lime juice and lots of extras - green onions, sliced jalepenos, sour cream, etc. Yum!

I'm a college student and made this recipe one weeknight for dinner and was so happy to find how easy and quick it was. I threw the marinated chicken on the george forman for 8 minutes and it came out perfectly grilled. The leftovers also make for a delicious and healthy lunch the next day.

This is spectacular!! The poblano chiles make it!! Served with guacamole, sour cream, on whole wheat tortillas. Made a beautiful presentation on a platter for guests to pick what they wanted. Can't wait to make it again. I will increase amount of marinade and heat before pouring over grilled veges.

Very easy, very tasty. Made it as-is and it was delicious. Good for a quick weeknight meal.

Great recipe! I made it (almost) as written. I used one .57 pound chicken breast and that was plenty for 2 people. Next time I will double the veggies. They shrink when grilled and they are the best part.

I have made this twice and it is very repeatable. I like the method and recipe but my wife and I think it needs some salt and a bit of a punch. Currently she prefers the packaged supermarket type.

This was a great recipe. I fixed it for seven people, including kids, and everyone loved it. I couldn't deal with grilling the veggies so I roasted them in the oven for a really long time until they were pretty crispy (the onions, especially). I will definitely make it again!

The sauce was delicious, I put it on 2 chicken breasts and sliced red onion and baked in slow oven at 300 for 1.5 hr. I will try this with beef too, the meat was moist, very tender and super flavorful. This would be a great way to cook meat or chicken and serve with rice and veg too!

I made this last night, put all the marinade on the chicken (2 breasts) and sliced red onions and baked in a slow oven for abg 1.5 hr.BEST SAUCE EVER. The meat just fell apart and was so deliciously seasoned. I'm going to try this sauce with meat too, also great way to cook and serve on rice or whatever!

These Fajitas were the best I have made at home! I used much less oil and they still turned out great. Use a BBQ for the exceptional flavors that we got in our dish.

I think the ingredients are right but the proportions are up to you. As given I found the recipe lacking flavor. I would like more spice (more chili powder, more cumin), more cilantro, and more lime. Also, I'd marinade the chicken and veggies a long while to let the flavors really soak in. I had to work with an oven, which I'm sure changes the overall taste, and would like to try this recipe when I have access to my grill again.

These are by far the best Chicken Fajitas we have ever had! The first time I made these I made what I thought was more than enough so we could have leftovers. Suffice to say there was nothing left for leftovers. This has become a go to recipe for my family. The chicken is better if you marinade it longer. It is good whether it is grilled or seared and cooked on the stove-top. Be sure to make extra onions and peppers. We like a combination of red, yellow, and poblano, and white or yellow onions. Add rice and beans, a fruit salad and a cold ceveza and theres no reason to go out for Mexican food!

Cilantro and lime make the perfect combonation. This recipe is a refreshing take on regular fajitas. The marinade is delicious.

This is a great quick and easy recipe. I find that you can alter the spice proportions to your liking and it still comes out yummy. I add several cloves of crushed garlic.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and like other reviewers mentioned, it is very flexible. I didn't have a grill, so I roasted the vegetables in the oven, and sauteed the chicken in a pan after marinating it for an hour. I also accidentally added more lime juice than it called for, but it tasted delicious!

This was really tasty. I did not have poblano chiles on hand so used all bell peppers. It was delicious and I will definitely make this again.

We really like this marinade with a few additions. I add 3 cloves crushed garlic as well as 1 tsp chipolte chile powder. I also reduce the cilantro to 3/4 cup.

Excellent and easy. I marinated the chicken for a few hours and it was extremely tender and tasty. Sauteed the veggies in a cast iron skillet on the BBQ. Delicious.

Very simple, easy weekday dinner. Because my garden was overflowing with green bell peppers, I just used 6 of them to replace the other peppers in the recipe. Also, sometimes I add extra peppers and onions because my husband and I can't get enough of the veggies with that wonderful lime and cilantro flavor. Goes great with a simple homemade pico!

I added some chipotle in adobo sauce as an extra to this recipe and it added a great smokey, spicey flavor to an already great dish.

This is one of our favorites. Husband loved it! I added shrimp and used red pepper flakes ilo chili powder for some kick. Sauteed veggies in olive oil, garlic, grill seasoning and added half a fresh jalepeno sliced. Served veggies and meat over rice as I didn't have tortillas on hand. Chopped fresh avocado and tomatoes to garnish. Loved it.

LOVED this recipe, we are huge fans of fajitas and I am always looking for new recipes but I think this will be the only one I make for a while, at least during the summer when I can BBQ! So yummy!

Quick, easy & delicious! I substituted chipotle powder and yellow onions and served with basmati rice instead of tortillas. I will absolutely make this again. . . and will serve it to guests.

Easy, and more importantly---versatile! All you need for the base recipe are: limes, cilantro, onion, and olive oil. From there use your favorite spices (even packaged fajita spices are wonderful), meat (pork, fish shrimp), and chiles (poblano, Anaheim, jalapeno, serrano, red, yellow, or green bell peppers; depends on the heat you want). I even made this while camping this weekend--no need to have a food processor at all, just chop finely and mix the marinade. I didn't measure anything because it's not that critical. I thought I had made too much, but it was gobbled up in no time, with major kudos!

Awesome, everyone loved it. I marinated the chicken breast for about an hour, because I had other things to do, and it came out soooo tender and moist. Definitely make this, it's a good dinner staple

Don't be fooled by the simplicity of this recipe- sometimes less really is more. I added a dash of chipotle powder to the marinade for a little heat, and a few whole cloves of garlic tossed in and grilled with the veggie mixture. Also grilled some lime quarters to serve alongside. Other than that- easy, healthy, and delicious. Served with a salsa that I "made": chop an avocado and add it to bottled tomatillo salsa along with a little leftover cilantro. A perfect match.

Wonderful recipe.We loved the chicken after marinating, it was very tasty and tender.

Rating: 4
I must disagree with the previous reviewer - we've made this recipe several times and we'd definitely put it in the amazing category. To us the best part is the grilled vegetables. They get a lovely char on them, which combined with the grilled marinated chicken is just an excellent taste. This is an easy to make dish that's fun to make for a casual dinner with friends or just for yourselves. We usually up the # of chicken breasts to 8 when we are having guests so we have lots to serve (and yummy leftovers too). That means there's a little less marinade at the end to pour over the chicken, but you still have enough for good flavor.

These fajitas are excellent! In line with the comments of other reviewers, I would suggest increasing the amount of marinade. The recipe, as written, made just enough to cover 2/3 of the recommended amounts of chicken/veggies, squishing them around in (separate) zip-lock bags. I also roasted the veggies in the oven.

I agree with other reviewers to increase the marinade. I used a ziplock bag to marinate the chicken and I also added skirt steak which was delicious with this marinade. I placed the peppers and marinade in another bag. I used a brush to paint the onion rounds with marinade. To conserve grill space which was occupied with chicken and steak and speed cooking time, I broiled the onions and peppers in the oven and they were terrific. I cooked a few on the grill for comparison and actually liked the ones from the oven better. I made guacamole - avocado, lime juice, water, tobasco, salt and that really added another dimension of flavor to the dish. It was a wonderful meal bursting in flavor and has been placed on the favorites list. Thanks epicurious.

Easy, delicious. This is already a family favorite. I made one and a half more times the marinade, as I found the listed amount didn't quite cover the chicken and vegetables. Also, putting the chicken and vegetables in a resealable Ziploc-type bag makes coating and storing them a breeze.

This has become a week night staple in our house. Delicious, easy, healthy, and no pots & pans to clean up. I halve the recipe for my husband and me, and increase the ancho chile a bit, and use a good fresh salsa.
