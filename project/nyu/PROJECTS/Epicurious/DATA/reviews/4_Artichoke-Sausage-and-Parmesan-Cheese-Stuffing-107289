I have been making this stuffing for the past 8 years. The first year I made it my family and extended family have requested I make it every holiday it was such a huge hit.

I replace portobello mushrooms and vegetable stock instead of sausage and chicken broth so it is vegetarian. I have been making the same stuffing for five years and it is a big hit!

This was a huge success with our family on Thanksgiving! Modifications included 2 cups of celery, 2 15 oz. cans of artichokes, 2 lbs. of sweet and hot sausage, plus 2 12 oz. bags of Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing in lieu of the sour dough. Leftovers were frozen and it was even better a week later reheated as a side dish. A keeper!

2nd go-around with this recipe, and I continue to struggle with the dryness of the sourdough cubes, despite reducing the size to 1/2". This time I kicked up the broth A LOT - and ended up with a doughy stuffing. Not a hint of sponginess (I did toast 5 minutes too long and cubes were dry-but-not-brown). Maybe toasting only ~8 minutes would help?

Absolutely excellent, even my nonstuffing eaters raved. I used sourdough-wheat-walnut bread instead and it was excellent.

Served this recipe with grilled thick pork chops...delicious. I used La Brea Bread stuffing. Big pieces of deliciously herb seasoned bread. Used 2 full cups of broth due to dried bread cubes...unbelievably delicious!!!

this is going to be the 4th or 5th year that i've made this stuffing. it is the BEST. i add extra cheese, omit the mint and use half sweet sausage and half spicy or country sausage for something different. i also agree that you need extra broth. can't wait to make it again!

This is, like most everyone says, the best stuffing I've ever had. We now make it every year. However, make sure you have extra broth on hand......I've left out the mint and it still is great! I'm going to try gluten-free bread in this recipe tomorrow.....not sure how it'll turn out, but my fiance was recently diagnosed with Celiac's disease and I want to make sure she gets stuffing on turkeyday. I'll let folks know how it come out....

A true crowd pleaser. I have made this the last two years at Thanksgiving, and everyone is expecting it again this year. I had been on a search for a great stuffing, and this is it.

It's easy to have a hit on your hands with this. I didn't have sourdough this year, so simply prepared it with white bread (including the crust,) and it really absorbed all of the flavors nicely and worked out well. Half went into the turkey and half into a baking dish - which led to double compliments at serving time when people took a bit of each.

Greating classic stuffing recipe! It seems that most stuffing recipes lately all lean toward the exotic. This reminds me more of the stuffing mom used to make.

Rating: 3
I used this recipe as a jumping off point and it was very, very good. Used half sourdough, half French, cubed smaller and left the crust on. Sauteed about half the bread cubes in a little duck fat for toasty croutoney goodness. Skipped the parmesan and basil, upped the garlic, added thyme, a little sage and oregano. Roasted one small butternut squash, cubed, and added to stuffing for color and flavor contrast. Meant to do some toasted pine nuts ... will add that next time. A fine stuffing.

I have made this recipe for 3 yrs running. The first year, it was so popular, I hardly got any myself, so was forced to make another batch the following week. It is work intensive; but worth every bit of it. My son always asks if I am going to make it again. A local caterer asked for the recipe, which i gladly provided, and he reported that it will be a mainstay at their family Christmas from now on. BTW, I follow the recipe to a T, and it is always terrific.

My family really enjoyed this stuffing. I used a pack of veggie Italian sausage and 10 oz package of frozen artichokes. I also used alot more broth since we cooked it in the oven. I definately will make it again.

My advice is be prepared with A LOT more broth. The flavors are delicious, however it was very dry. I also took some of the other reviewer's advice and cut smaller bits of bread. Perhaps I should not have kept the crust on, but this was dry dry dry.

Rating: 3
Cut the recipe in half. Used fully cooked chicken sausage. The thyme and mint were completely drowned out by the sausage, and it was also really salty because of the sausage. But the dish was delicious besides the saltiness. Even though I cut it in half, I used a full can of broth 3/4 cup of parm, and a full can of artichokes.

I thought this was good, but would have been better if I had mixed it together a few hours ahead, to soften the bread and make the flavors blend. It was great as left overs the next day. I used french bread and whole foods chicken sausage with artichoke and olive.

I make this recipe every year and it always receives rave reviews. It is extremely easy to make and it is the best stuffing recipe I've tasted. I use one loaf of sourdough and one loaf of whole wheat sourdough. You will need more than one cup of broth.

I made this for Christmas Dinner and everyone LOVED it...I did not stuff in the bird, instead I baked it in a casserole dish. This gave it texture and a great floavor.

I made this at Christmas and everyone LOVED it, I changed the spices though, and uped the amount of artichokes. I used canned artichokes, I left the crust on the bread, and cut smaller pieces, also I substituted chicken sausage, and the seasonings I used were Trader Joes's 21 herb one and well as oregano, with the proportions they used and it was awesome.

I made this stuffing as an alternative to the traditional Thanksgiving stuffing and it was a big hit. My only recommendation is that you use the canned artichokes. In my opinion the frozen ones were just too mushy. I also doubled the amount of artichokes that the recipe called for and I was so glad I did. I was a bit more liberal with fresh grated parmesan and I substituted basil instead of mint. It's a great recipe that I highly recommend. I'm already getting requests for next year. Oh yea....leave the crusts on the sourdough bread too. It added great texture to the look and taste of the stuffing. Good Luck!

I had very high hopes for this stuffing this Thanksgiving; however, it was only good, not great. If I make it again, I would definitely use smaller bread pieces, add extra cheese and a bit more sausage. I followed the reviewers' advice and added more stock to keep it moist, but it was too much, so it ended up a sloppy mush that was good (I guess all stuffing looks somewhat mushy), but not too flavorful.

Rating: 4
Smaller bread pieces with crust, extra cheese and garlic and this is a winner. Have extra chicken stock on hand, I used quite a bit more than called for to keep it very moist. Everyone loved it - yummy!

This dish reminded my family too much of a breakfast sausage casserole. All it needed was the eggs. Don't get me wrong, they still liked it and ate it. Kids loved the sausage. Next time I'll, cut the bread into smaller cubes, double the artichokes, and maybe it would fly as a dinner dish.

This is so great! I make it every year to rave reviews and repeat requests. I make a couple of changes though. I use just bulk sausage (not Italian), am more generous with the cheese and chicken stock and I throw in some herbes de provence for good measure. Yummy!

Excellent- I always tweak recipes a bit, and I cut the bread into 1/2 inch cubes, left the crust, extra garlic, and guestimated the other ingredients-Heavenly!! Huge yield, but, good- you might have some leftovers for company!

I made this for the 4th time. Every year this is everyone's favorite. And it is so good the next day too. I agree with the recommendations to cut the bread smaller.

I made three big dishes of this for Canadian Thanksgiving and my guests were sneaking into the kitchen all night picking at the leftovers! It even worked well as vegetarian (I made a smaller one to accommodate a few guests). Tastes even better the next day. For herbs I use a fresh poultry mix of thyme, parsley and rosemary. Delicious and flexible too.

Living in Italy I wanted to make an american dinner for all my friends! So I used this recipe and everybody loved it. I actually stuffed it into little round zucchini and baked it with the cheese on top...Very good! I substituted the mint with basil, because mint and zucchini don't go well together.

This has now become my family's new traditional stuffing. My 90 year old grandmother even asked for the recipe!

I must have done something wrong because we did not enjoy this dish at all. Not very flavorful and the stuffing seemed too dry. Agree with others comments on the bread cubes being too big. Would not make this again.

Delicious and wonderfully different from the traditional stuffing. The flavors really worked well together. Followed the recipe, but left the crust on the bread and used basil instead of mint. Bread cubes were a little too large for my taste, so next time I'll make them smaller.

For the most part, I was pleased with the result. I wish I had broken all the ingredients into smaller sizes though - I noticed patches of big, dry sourdough and oversized lumps of sausage. Guests enjoyed the result and nobody balked at the artichoke.

Excellent! Even to chefs that attended Thanksgiving dinner had seconds! I did make a few changes and made this vegetarian. Also, I poured a little melted butter over the dish and continued to bake it for the last 10 mins. This will for sure become my new holiday favorite to serve.

Delicious! I made this dish for a crowd and it was a hit. The tartness of the sourdough is great and I found this dish tasted even better the day after. Next time I make it, I'll bake it a day in advance and just brown it before I serve it. I'll make it over and over. Also, I added most of the bread crusts, it added more texture I think.

Oh, this was so good. It was the highlight of Thanksgiving dinner. Because there was no room in the oven, I cooked it on the grill in one of those Pampered Chef stone-like pans, covered with foil and the edges got nicely crisp. The flavor was amazing.

So-So, no one really loved it, liked it but did not ask for 2nds.

This was fantastic - my family is still raving about this. The only suggestion I would make would be to cut the sourdough a bit smaller than the recipe calls for. The fact that much of the recipe can be prepared one day ahead made it ideal for a big Thanksgiving dinner.

My family didn't care for this with our turkey dinner. It is definitely not the traditional stuffing recipe. It is very tasty, yet with the sausage and the tang from the sourdough bread it is better off as a meal by itself with some veggies or salad on the side. Too rich and too much going on with flavors in this dish to be a side with many other dishes.

I did a test run, and it came out great. I left the crust on and I like the texture difference it created. I ended up using more broth to moisten it before baking - with great results. I can't wait to serve it @ Thanksgiving.

I did this recipe on T-Day 1999 and loved it. My in-laws liked it as well which was a plus. I'm happy to locate the recipe again and will make it this Thanksgiving along with Traditional stuffing.

I was very interested in trying this recipe but was disappointed only for the simple reason that I don't think the cheese works well with the turkey. I guess it's just too "out there" for me. I would certainly use the artichokes again, that was a nice touch. Perhaps I might try the whole recipe again to accompany another type of dish..I'm not sure what though. I think next time I'll try the "grandma Stoll's moist dressing" that was recommended by a friend and is available on this website

This was a delicious new addition to the Thanksgiving table. I used french bread with the crust on, romano instead of parmesan and a can of drained artichokes, and it was the best dish on the table. The sausage really makes a difference, as does a good quality of cheese. I will make this again when I want to impress friends!

Did the deep fried turkey this Thanksgiving (DELICIOUS YUMMY EXCELLENT) and made this dressing to sub for stuffing. Delicious and easy. Left out the mint and mixed some French bread cubes with the sourdough. A big hit!

good stuff! its not stuffing, though. still, it is one of the better side dishes that masquerades as stuffing.

Fantastic change for stuffing! Keep in mind if this is made in a pan instead of in the bird, quite a bit more chicken stock is needed - make the bread moist or it will be dry.

I thought the flavor of this stuffing was fabulous and the sourdough was a great addition, but the next time I would add at least another 1/2 pound of sausage and another whole can of artichokes and maybe about two cups less bread (from which I did not remove the crust and it was fine). I ended up putting two cans of broth to make it very moist, rather than just the 1 3/4 cups the recipe calls for.
