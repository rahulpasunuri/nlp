I thought this recipe was problematic on a couple of points and produced an only OK soup. Problem 1: Why not just say cilantro instead of "fresh coriander"? Very confusing for the novice cook. Problem 2: The directions never call for the curry powder and ground cumin. It's not hard to figure out when to put them in, but I almost left them out since they were not mentioned in the directions. I also think it is amusing that some reviewers give the recipe a high rating then tell us about all the adjustments they made. Just sayin'...... nf

This soup is a great way to use leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I had frozen my turkey stock and leftover turkey, from Thanksgiving. The recipe doesn't read easily and never mentions when to add the curry and cumin. I added it with the veggies and let them saute for a minute or two. Like others, I added turkey at the end. I shredded the turkey. Pretty tasty with a baguette on a cold December day!

I was disappointed with this soup. It sounded really good. At first, I would have said it was good, but after a few bites I was bored with it. No variation of flavor.

I didn't use as much liquid as the recipe called for and added garham masala to the spice mix. I also garnished with mint instead for fresh coriander. My husband went crazy for the soup. Oh, I also added cubed turkey at the end of cooking.

This was terrific with these alterations: I made my turkey stock ahead. I halved the recipe, and cut the liquid by a further 2.5 cups, added more curry and lime juice (I used 4 packets of True Lime powder), after puree was made I added 1 cup lentils and bits of turkey meat from the carcass.

A great way to use up the left-over T-giving turkey...I added about 3 cups of meat at the end. I also substituted sweet potatoes for the russet. Gave the soupe a beautiful color and sweetness.

I made this soup half the stock from out large turkey, and it is a hit. I added some lemongrass in the initial reduction and had some winter melon from a friend so threw it in, adding a nice sourness. i also used extra coconut milk because we love it. Some people sprinkled a little cayenne at the table but I didn't want to add it for everyone.

Tried this after Christmas this year. The soup is rich yet bland. It seemed almost hollow to me. We added a lot more curry than the recipie called for, additional cumin and garlic. Scotch bonnet peppers are also a nice addition to give it some pazzaz! The recipie never tells you where to introduce the curry. With the additions my family enjoyed the soup.

This is a great base recipe - I made just as directed then added toasted almonds, toasted unsweetened coconut, turkey meat and a healthy dash of Sriracha chili sauce. You can adjust the seasoning to make the dish more Indian, Thai or whatever works for you. This is also not the time for "Don't we have some curry powder in the spice rack?"-type of dried-out, flavorless curry. USE A GOOD, FRESH CURRY POWDER, one you like and you will love your soup. If you don't like curry you should pass on this recipe.

Ths is a great day-after-Thanksgiving soup for when you can't possibly face another big heavy meal. Interesting that there was no actual turkey in turkey soup; we added some. We also felt it needed some heat and used a spicy Madras curry powder and a bit of cayenne. And salt, pepper, and ground coriander. This time we didn't use the coconut milk but we will next time, along with lemongrass and the lime. We agree lentils sound like a great addition.

I FOUND THIS RECIPE IN GOURMET YEARS AGO AS A WAY TO USE UP LEFTOVER TURKEY. MY HUSBAND AND I LOVED IT SO MUCH IT HAS BECOME A YEARLY TRADITION IN OUR HOUSE AS AN AFTER HOLIDAY SOUP.BUT, IF YOU DON'T ENJOY INDIAN FLAVORS, YOU WON'T ENJOY THIS SOUP.

This recipe is calls for way too much ginger and not enough varied spices such as cloves or cayenne. If I were to try it in the future I would use 1/3 the amount of ginger and add in some cloves, nutmeg or mace. That said, the recipe instructions themselves are very porrly written. When to add spices? What kind of onions work best?

The whole family enjoyed this, used ground turkey, a great jumping off point. I have added peas and julianned carrots for texture and color. a lovely winter day soup.

With minor modifications, this soup was deliriously good. Started with my turkey broth, substituted low-fat coco milk, used 8 rather than 10 cups of broth overall and went a bit havier on the cumin and curry. It was unbelievable. Who cares if it isn't authentic mulligatawney? Name it something else if you like!

Note - this recipe directions omit addition of spices - recommend adding at the beginning of the dish when sauting garlic and ginger.

Let's just call this "Mulligatawny-Inspired?" I made a lot of variations on this recipe, but if you do too, you'll surely end up with a meal you love! The seasonings needed extra support, although I did forget the lime, which disappointed me because I think that would have been good, and would have added flavor. Omitted the coconut milk. Doubled cumin as suggested, and doubled cilantro, also seasoned with cardamom, cinnamon, and lots of salt and pepper. I substituted the potatoes for a yam and half a small head of cauliflower plus 1 1/2 granny smith apples, chopped. Also added 1 cup of lentils. I didn't think the apples nor the yam added much beyond a nice stewiness to the texture.

My recommendation: make the soup up to the point just before adding the coconut milk and stop there. Add some turkey and diced potatoes and this is a good recipe. That's what I did the first time I made it. The next time I made it as written and was not impressed.

A good recipe, but not to my taste.

This soup was one of the best, and certainly the most interesting thing to come out of thanksgiving! I took the cook from Seatle's advice and added more spices, lentils and the apple. I substituted cauliflower for potatoes and added lemon grass to the broth and fresh mushrooms to the finished product. I plan to make more of this soup with the stock I have in the freezer!

Made this after Thanksgiving (Canadian, eh?) and since I only had a few hours on weeknights to work on it it took me a few days to get the stock as rich as I wanted it. But once done, it turned out fabulous. I added extra hot curry powder, and some hot hot sauce for a little kick. I didn't puree the veg since I only have a small chopper, so I just mashed them a bit once they were soft. The soup wasn't very thick, so I added some leftover jasmine rice, and it was perfect. I would probably make this again, but won't need to for awhile since I now have tons in the freezer! Very nice tasty soup, and a nice change from the usual turkey-veg.

Made this at christmast time, and just opened up one of my containers in the freezer --- ahhh, sublime on a cold dreary day. (it freezes great). Loads of changes: double the cumin, add chopped turkey meat white & dark, add chopped hot peppers to the broth, red lentils and diced green apple a must. My turkey carcass was from Cook's Illustrated spice-rubbed brined bird (a great recipe, http://www.cooksillustrated.com/turkeyhelp/turkeyhelparticle.asp?did=6291)...it already was very spicy, but I liked that in this broth.

not hot enough. Should have bits of turkey or chicken. Spices should be added during first veg saute. NO OTHER INDICATION GIVEN!! I am accustomed to having dried onions to sprinkle on. And the result would also be darker. I remember the Singapore Cricket Club version had rice not potatoes as the main starch.

Intoxicating! I made the following changes. Added 4 cups or so of turkey. A cup of assorted chopped peppers to the vegtable puree. I didnt cook the vegtables as long or with stock. Pureed yogurt with fresh coconut shavings rather than coconut milk. Added a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper.

This is not Mulligatawny Soup. Mulligatawny Soup must have apples in it. This recipe does not, thus it is not Mulligatawny Soup.

My friends and family raved about this soup! Like many other cooks, I used more cumin and added some extra turkey chunks to the soup. Do not substitute low-fat coconut milk for the coconut milk; it will not taste as good.

WONDERFUL!!! I made it the 1st time with the turkey carcass and 2nd time by cooking 2 turkey cutlets (boneless skinless turkey breast pieces) in the ginger/garlic/onion + some water. It was easier and better (not so rich). Used 1/4 c. Julie Sahni's curry powder recipe, increased cumin to 1 tsp. and added 1 cup red lentils. It tasted very much like Singh's before our local Indian restaurant changed owners. Try this recipe!!!

I followed the recipe exactly but didn't find it robust or complex enough for our taste. After blending, I added 2T madras curry paste, 2/3c raisins and some diced turkey. It made all the difference and the next day was fantastic!

Not to be snobby, but "Mulligatawny soup" is, essentially, yellow lentils with tomatoes, onions, and a clear, pepper broth. The spices are cumin and mustard seeds in addition to a powder containing various indian items. The thought of coconut milk in this beautiful recipe makes me nauseated.

I used chicken broth instead of making the turkey broth. I also added about 1/2 cup of cilantro in the puree and 3 tablespoons of chicken base and it was EXCELLENT!

I don't get it? This recipe has so many wonderful ingredients and so many raves, but it just didn't do anything for me. I kept tasting after every addition thinking the next ingredient would be the one that made it great, but it never did. Too bad because my turkey broth was glorious and ended up as a mediocre soup.

Excellent dish! I added some leftover roasted turkey breast to the soup just before serving. This was a good way to use the carcass- better than the usual turkey soup w/vegies.

This was a good soup, however the recipe never tells you when to add the spices. I realized this when I tasted it and it was pretty bland. I ended up adding the spices at the end, and suspect that they should be added with the garlic and gingerroot.
