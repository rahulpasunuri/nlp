Pretty good sauce that was not too difficult to make. I used canned tomatoes so I'm not sure how big a difference that would have made. Also, after simmering it for about 1.5 hrs, I tossed it in the blender to even it out. I much prefered the result post blender, so just a thought.

This will become a stand-by! I added Italian sausage at the tail end of the garlic sauté, doubled the red pepper flakes, and topped it with parmesan and chopped basil. Delicious!!

Glorious. Will become my stock sauce from now on. My only changes to this were a) 108 oz of tinned chopped tomatoes, b) about 3 teaspoons of sugar and c) let it plop away for about 3 hours, purely as I had to time to do that. Served it simply with shrimp and some spaghetti.

This is a flavor-packed little sauce! And so easy too, especially if you use canned tomatoes. Don't be afraid of all the garlic - it is what makes the sauce. But definitely cut down on the oil (4 tbsp).

I also used chartruese's suggestions re: roasted the tomatoes, and Oh. My. God. I could have eaten the tomatoes all by themselves. It made all the difference in the sauce. I didn't add any herbs as the garlic and pepper were flavorful enough with the roasted tomatoes. Served over spaghetti squash. If I can find some BPA free liners, I'll be canning a whole mess of this sauce this summer when the fresh tomatoes hit the farmer's market!

I used the method from charteuse's last post and roasted my less than stellar winter tomatoes here in Al Ain, and this sauce is absolutley Gorgeous! I can't wait to try it with tinned tomatoes, but the roasting of my insipid, squashed fresh Lebanese imports has turned out a sauce that can only be described as heavenly...pure genius. I'd say this was an heirloom recipe.

I did this to the tomatoes, before starting this recipe: Oven‐Roasted Plum Tomatoes By Mark Bittman From the How to Cook Everything® app Introduction: Ingredients: 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus a little for the pan 2 pounds plum tomatoes (about a dozen), cored and cut in half lengthwise Salt and freshly ground black pepper Steps: Heat the oven to 165°C (325°F). Grease a large baking sheet or roasting pan with a little of the olive oil. Scoop the seeds out of the tomatoes if you like and put them on the pan, cut side down. Drizzle or brush with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Roast until they start to char a bit and shrivel (there's no need to turn), 30 minutes. Variations: Works for heirloom, beefsteak, or hothouse tomatoes, especially when you want to improve imperfect ones: Core the tomatoes and halve them around the equator instead of lengthwise. Squeeze out the seeds (see Preparing Tomatoes). Cut the largest pieces in half again and proceed with the recipe. This lets you just pull the skins off.

after reading the "exception" review, I felt I must make my experience known. I have made this recipe many times... in winter I used canned tomatoes..actually, bottled, from Italy, and in summer, I use roma type tomatoes from Nice, as I live in the South of France. Always fabulous. not too oily -- and not to work intensive... that person obviously never made a Julia Child recipe of anything with 15 or more ingredients. I do use less pepper flakes, but otherwise, a wonderful easy great recipe

Delicious. I used 2 heads of roasted garlic and the San Marzano tomatoes. I also added 3/4 T sugar at the beginning, and added 1 t of coarse salt during the last 5 minutes of simmering. I also tossed in a handful of shredded pulled pork left over from our previous evening's dinner. We served the sauce over grilled polenta rounds, brushed with olive oil and fresh cracked black pepper. I will definitely make this simple, flavorful sauce again.

I hate to go against the grain here, but I don't think I will be making it again. I doubled the recipe as I wanted to make enough for several days. The effort involved was enormous, and the result was underwhelming. I mean, it was good, but very very mild. It calls for way too much oil - I had to drain it when it was done. I also pureed the whole thing because I wasn't happy with the texture.

Tripled recipe, but only did 2/3 of suggested crushed red pepper. Still very hot. Ended up adding 3 spoonfulls of sugar, 6 oz can of tomato paste, and 28oz can of crushed tomatoes.

This is a good basic tomato sauce. The spiciness was a nice touch! I give this three forks because I felt it needed some additional herbs (I added thyme, oregano and marjoram). This sauce is VERY expensive to make in the Northwest in March, ( I doubled the recipe and used organic Roma tomatoes at a whoppin $3.99 a pound) but I will be sure to use this recipe as a starting place as the tomatoes start pouring in from my garden this summer!

What an outstanding and simple recipe! This is the first recipe I've used to make my own tomato sauce and I've made it several times now. I carbo load for running and this is the tastiest way to do it. It also freezes well. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves pasta.

really really good sauce... I used canned whole tomatoes and added 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp dried thyme, 2 Tbsp fresh basil, and left out the red pepper flakes, since I had none on hand. Also, I only used 4 Tbsp olive oil as another reviewer suggested. When finished I smoothed the sauce out with an immersion blender. highly recommended... great sauce with very little effort

This recipe is really fabulous. I turned five grocery bags of tomatoes from my garden into sauce using this recipe. The texture turns out wonderfully if you peel and chop the tomatoes, but that was out of the question with the quantity I had so I used a tomato grinder to seed and peel the tomatoes, which gave me basically tomato puree. Then I simmered until I had the consistency I wanted and I canned it. It's great tasting the bright, fresh flavors of my garden tomatoes now in the middle of winter. And, even better, my aunt is allergic to onions but no worries with this recipe, and I never noticed that they were gone.

This is fantastic. I have made this four times now and a friend said it was the best thing I have ever cooked for him. No modifications necessary and I am always shocked how little sauce two pounds of farmer's market heirloom tomatoes turns into.

This sauce is outstanding! Some things to take into consideration. First, I only used one head of garlic instead of two. Secondly, I used beef steak tomatoes instead of plum. And lastly, I referenced this recipe in the actual magazine where I discovered that the amount of red peppers flakes was misprinted. Within the hardcopy it states 1/8 teaspoon instead of 3/4 teaspoon which makes a world of difference! I also used a hand blender once it was finished simmering to make it less chunky. I suggest making a double batch if planning on serving a family of four. Hopes this helps!

Awesome! I quadrupled it (bought one of those BIG cans at CostCo) and didn't change anything else- although experimentation would be easy & likely delicious (onions, herbs, veggies, meat, etc.) This recipe is a great basis for a real italian marinara. It freezes well too.

Delicious recipe! Must use good summer tomatoes and reduce the red pepper flakes.

Surprisingly delicious. Also cut way back on the pepper and used one large head of garlic, which was all I had. Husband -- not a tomato sauce fan -- loved it. I plan to make a big batch to freeze.

Rating: 0
Whoa--the sauce was great, but 3/4 t of red pepper flakes was too much! I would recommend reducing the amount of red pepper. I also didn't have the full amount of garlic--I only used two cloves, not two heads. Garlic taste was very subtle--would use more next time. Great recipe!

excellent recipe....simple but delicious. I added the juice of one keylime and sprinkled one teaspoon of sugar on top while it was cooking. Everyone loved it because it added taste and not a lot of liquid.

Though this sauce tastes wonderful, it calls for an excessive amount of oil. After it was done cooking, there was a heavy layer of oil floating on top. I skimmed it off and it was about 2/3 of what the recipe called for. That's a lot of unnecessary fat! I popped a stick blender into the pot and blended it about halfway, and the resulting texture was lovely.

This is the best pasta sauce ever!!! I'm never buying that horrid stuff in a jar ever again... But next time, I'm doubling the recipe. This stuff's enough to make me start canning! :-)

Amazingly easy. Does require some work. Made it with 37 lbs of my garden fresh tomatoes and froze it. It freezes wonderfully. Also, I add a little bit of yellow onion sometimes as well as Italian sausage to make it a meat sauce. Any which way I cook it, by the book or with a little bit of improvisation, I get rave reviews from my husband and friends. Just wonderful!

Just a handful of ingredients makes this simple, easy and very flavorful sauce. The garlic is not overpowering at all. I served it over noodles with some fresh mozzarella. Delicious!

This recipe is fantastic! The sauce is a lovely bright red, and delicious. I made a quadruple recipe (hordes of tomatoes from the garden this year) and halved the qty of olive oil, and it was a perfect quantity. Next time, I will buy peeled garlic (highly recommended).

It's amazing that something this simple can taste sooo good! It's velvety, melt-in-your-mouth smooth and has an oh-so-mellow garlic flavor. Can't wait to make it again.

OMG I loved this sauce so much! I am always looking for new tomato sauces. This was unbelieveably finger-licking good--and easy! I basically doubled the recipe. Used two 28 oz. cans of good tomatoes. I added about 3/4 T. sugar, and only about 1/2 t. salt and pepper at the end for the last few mintues of cooking. It is incredibly sweet--in a good way. I can't believe the 1 T. of sugar gave it all that sweetness. Must be the combo of the tomatoes and garlic. The hot pepper flakes create a nice contrast to the sweet. Plus it's very tomatoe-y. It's easy, delicious, and just perfect!

Has anyone tried to roast the garlic rather than peeling and sauteeing it? Seems like it would be less effort and maybe provide some good flavor. Just curious.

This sauce is a bit tedious to make, but the results are divine. I made the recipe exactly as written and it was one of the most delicious sauces I have ever prepared. Next time, I may try to reduce the amount of olive oil and add a bit of fresh basil toward the end of the cooking time.

This is a wonderful recipe that I return to again and again. I prepare it as written with canned organic plum tomatoes when fresh tomatoes are out of season. The garlic is fantastic and not at all overwhelming, as some might imagine based on the amount called for! I often add some dried basil and oregano. I try not to mess with it too much though, since the balance of flavour is so nice. When the sauce is done simmering, I puree it for the picky eaters in my family. In all honesty, I have no idea how this sauce tastes the next day - I've never had leftovers!

So easy, simple, and delicious. I use this all the time. When summer comes and the garden is full of real tomatoes, I will try it with fresh. But otherwise with a can of good San Marzanos, it is scrumptious.

Great just as written, and like suggested I used canned marzano tomatoes because it was not tomato season. When I saw this in the magazine I was very excited. Still good the next day, well work at make or 2 or 3 or ...

I expected to love this. The peeling of the garlic was tedious, but the sauce smelled and tasted wonderful as it cooked. However, I let it sit for an hour before tossing and serving with pasta--it took on a rather odd flavor that I can only describe as "turnip-y"--it tasted vaguely unpleasant to me. The garlic flavor did not hold up well even for a brief time, though I see it should keep 4 days or can be frozen. I won't make this again.

I'm half Italian and I NEVER use sauce from a jar. Don't be disappointed tasting this before it's done - the final result is delicious. I made it with the Sician Meatballs from this site and the combination was totally yummy. Def. will make again.

This was so yummy! I hate when people review recipes when they make changes, but I have to do it anyway. My husband is on a very low-fat diet, so 6 tablespoons of oil was out of the question. I used my supermarket olive oil to cook the garlic and then dumped nearly all of it out, then when the sauce was finished simmering, I drizzled in a bit of the good olive oil for flavor. I also used a can of crushed instead of diced because that's what was available. I'm amazed that something with so few ingredients could taste so good. Oh, and a tip for making this more kid-friendly - use a potato masher to break the garlic up just a bit. I'm planning to make this again this week to try with a manicotti recipe!

I grew a gazillion tomatoes this year (80 plants- yikes!) and was looking for a way to use them. This recipe seemed too simple to be as amazing as it is! I used mostly plum tomatoes, but threw in a couple 'Mr. Stripy' and 'Cherokee Purple' heirlooms. The flavor was to die for, and the garlic cooked up so mellow and soft, seriously the best pasta sauce I've made! We froze some, but ended up eating it within the week it was so good!

This recipe is delicious. I added cooked and drained ground beef as my husband needs "meat" with every meal. Still wonderful, the garlic adds great flavor, isn't too much at all.

This recipe was so easy, I plan on making it again and again. At first I was in disbelief that the 2 heads of garlic wouldn't overpower the dish, but I took a chance and loved the outcome! The amount of sauce is perfect for one pound of spaghetti and tastes like it's straight out of an Italian resturaunt. Next time I'll add more red paper flakes and perhaps some hot sausage to spice it up a little.

I loved this recipe. Simple, easy, & delicious. I used a 28oz can of whole plum tomatoes from Trader Joe's instead of fresh, cutting them up with scissors while they were cooking. I poured the sauce over manicotti and baked in the oven with a sprinkling of parmesan. Delicious!
