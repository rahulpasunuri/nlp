These were amazing! I was inspired to make these after having fried yuca at a favorite restaurant - these were much better! If you have a deep fryer, it helps.

I personally find that the frozen product is much better than fresh. Frozen food gets to 'vine-ripen' much longer, picked at its peak and flash frozen, sealing in flavor and nutrition. Also, frozen yuca is MUCH easier to work with! Also like to fry my yuca with some crushed garlic. Still have to try the mojo.

I have been making these fried yucca sticks for many years. I havent tried the Orange Mojo before, but I look forward to it. It looks delicious. I do recommend using a small pinch of sugar in addition to salt and pepper on the yucca. You can buy frozen cleaned yucca in any grocery store if you cant find the fresh stuff, which is available at every bodega.
