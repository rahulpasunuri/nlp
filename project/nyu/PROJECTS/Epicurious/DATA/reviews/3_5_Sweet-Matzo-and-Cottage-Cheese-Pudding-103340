Have never been a fan of sweet noodle kugel, but this is so delicious, homey, soothing that I have some in the oven now and it's May!! It pays to use high-quality cinnamon.

This is fabulous, and reminded us of noodle pudding. I made it with the filling quantity called for in the recipe, but added a 1/2 matzo next to the whole piece for each layer, as I used a larger pan. I cut back the butter on the top and bottom, but sprayed the top with cooking spray. It browned very nicely. I used walnuts and golden raisins. Excellent and highly recommended if you like noodle pudding!

Very good and very easy. A variation on a variation, I added 1/2 tsp almond extract, which added some zip to the recipe. I also had some chopped apricots which worked well. Would also try sliced apples next time. Easy and good

As passover dishes go, this one is pretty good. I will definitely add vanilla next time. We had fresh strawberries, but actually some sort of fruit with a sweet syrup might add some more flavor.

Very easy to make and a bit tasty but really not that great...kind of bland...needs something to spice it up or add some flavor

What a wonderful dish. You could use creme fraiche or even maple syrup on it.Or you could add other dried fruits like apricots. A great breakfast side dish.

This recipe was very easy. I added a half teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cottage cheese, and used 4 matzahs instead of 3. I will make this again, even after the holiday!

I made this dish today for my husband and his family and they were all very impressed. It was delicious, "a keeper" as my mother-in-law said. It was incredibly easy to make. The next time I make it, I will add mixed berries to the top during the last few minutes of baking to hide its unattractive appearance. Sour cream really enhances the flavor.
