I have a very similar recipe, but the hazelnuts are replaced with toasted almonds, cilantro with parsley and vinegar with lemon juice. I usually add a little bit of lemon zest as well. The sauce suits white fish as suggested, and also makes a good starter when tossed with cooked shrimps. For a surimi salad, I have tried this sauce with cilantro as well, but with the addition of a little bit of honey. It was quite ok, I guess could have been nicer if I used lime instead of lemon.

Very nice! I had some cilantro that needed using, and coincidentally had just seen this in the back of this month's Gourmet magazine, so voila. I think next time I'll use some chopped fresh green chile instead of the cayenne, and maybe a little more vinegar (might work well with lime juice for some or all of the acid, too, if you like limes) Served over fish and israeli couscous, made for a super-fast meal (the sauce can be made while the rest cooks, about 15 mins total in the kitchen!)
