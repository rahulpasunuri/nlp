These beans do take a long time to get finished, but they are so very good. I don't soak my beans anymore (per chef Rick Bayless) but instead start them on low and cook them at a bare simmer for 2-4 hours, depedning on the bean, and in this case I cooked 2 hours before adding garlic, onions, bay, and dried thyme. I then cooked another hour. I made the tomato sauce and, after draining the beans, mixed together and cooked on the stove top for 45 minutes or so, and then in the oven for a hour. It could have gone longer in the oven, but it didn't need to. I did use about half the reserved bean liquid, and poured more over to store (it will soak it up in the fridge). This is a worthy recipe, indeed.

These were good, but we took them over the edge by cooking them in a cast iron dutch oven in a smoker that was cooking pork shoulders. Yep, we put the pot under one of the shoulders with the lid just tipped, and the goodness that was dripping off the smoked pork went into the pot. It was a meal of pulled pork, fresh slaw and baked beans that was as close to heaven as my friends and I are likely to get. It took about 5 hours in the smoker at 250-275 deg, but was totally worth it. Smokey, porky, and beany.

Not our cup of tea. The clove flavor was too much. Still looking for the perfect bean dish. Would not make again.

Wow! These are delicious. I'm not a big baked bean person, but apparently it's because I never had a good batch. My husband loved these on toast (he's british) and I love them with polenta. I will definitely make these again and for a bunch of people. One thing I might change is to leave out the bacon, for heath reasons. Overall...a total hit!

These beans were a hit. I decided to do them in the slow cooker like many other readers but for some reason they took forever. I soaked the beans overnight and then put all the indredients in the slow cooker and cooked them for approx. 12 hours total. The beans took forever to soften. The end result was delicious and I will definately make them again and again.

Great recipe! If you want to kick it up, instead of adding the reserve liquid during baking use a dark Irish stout beer! I also like to add a pinch of cayenne pepper for zip!

This is a great recipe. Incredibly delicious. I used a slow cooker for the 3-5 hour baking process.

Family & friends loved this dish, though I changed the method a bit; simmered the beans in water for 10 minutes, rinsed them and set them aside. I made the barbecue sauce w/out cooking any of the ingredients prior as I added them all into the bean pot with the semi-cooked beans and baked them at 300 for 6.5 hours adding beef stock as needed. I also increased the sugars to 1/3 c of each brown sugar and molassesas They were perfectly sweet, saucy and delish!

This was my first time making baked beans and they were a hit!

This was a great recipe. Like others, I wanted to make these in the crock pot. I made a double batch of the sauce with the following modifications: didn't use the bell pepper, added a few extra tablespoons of brown sugar and molasses and added a few splashes of cider vinegar. I soaked the beans overnight in water to cover in the crock pot, then drained, rinsed and added 3.5 cups of water/stock mixture with thyme and salt/pepper and cooked the beans for 3 hours on high. Took out most of the cooking liquid with a turkey baster and reserved it. Poured 3/4 of the double batch of sauce over, mixed in lots of diced half-cooked bacon and cooked on low for 6 hours, the last 2 with the lid ajar. They were great, really great, but could have used a bit more mustard. Didn't need any of the reserved liquid.

Really good baked beans, in nowhere as much time as the recipe says. Let the beans soak in the initial boiling water until it was all absorbed - about 1/2 hour, cooked for forty-five minutes and baked for about 2.5 hours. Had to use all the cooking liquid and then some - next time I will increase the amount of tomato sauce to a full jar. Also added extra worcestershire and a little vinegar for a nice kick. PS Left out the bacon to make it vegetarian - didn't even notice!

These beans were delicious. I, too, made them in a crockpot (first soaked them overnight in water in the crockpot) and then cooked them all the next day. Personally, I would like a tiny bit more "kick" to them, but they were perfect for my kids and wimpy hubby.

This has become a staple for us. I now eliminate the meat completely as once I couldn't get to the store to buy it and discovered the beans were great on their own. I add extra vegetables but don't put in the Worcestershire sauce, cloves or stock. A wonderful and oh so satisfying recipe.

I used a slow cooker for these beans and they turned out really well. I doubled the recipe, and soaked the beans in the crock pot turned on low overnight, along with bay leaves and thyme. In the morning the beans were pretty soft. I turned off the crock pot and prepared the sauce. (Next time I would cut back on the cloves by about 1/2. I added the sauce to the beans and cooked them on low in the crock pot for about 3 hours. Got rave reviews from everyone at our barbecue to whom we also served the Texas beef brisket (recipe found at this site. A great combination.

This was really tasty. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and cooked the beans in a crockpot overnight (on low) with the 3 1/2 c of stock/water (next time I will use a little more), bay leaves, salt, pepper and thyme. In the morning, I added about 2 cups more water and turned the crock pot off; made the sauce (omitted celery as I didn't have it), adding 1/4 cup cider vinegar, 1 1/2 tsp extra mustard powder and 2 TBS extra brown sugar, and a quick dash of cayenne. I then poured it all in the crock pot with the beans and cooked it for about 5 hours on low. I did not use any of the reserved bean liquid. It turned out REALLY yummy, and it was nice because it left the oven free for biscuits! I will definitely make these again. It was really easy in the crock pot.

OH SO TASTY. PEOPLE SAID UMM THE MOMENT THEY PUT THEM IN THEIR MOUTHS. I COOKED THEM AT 220 DEGREES FOR SEVEN HOURS ALONG WITH THE NORTH CAROLINA PULLED PORK ON SARA'S RECIPE SWAP. I ALSO SERVED EPICURIOUS COLESLAW MADE WITH BARBECUE SAUCE, RICE AND PORTUGUESE CORNMEAL WHITE BREAD. VERY SATISFYING MEAL.

We're big bean eaters in the midwest, and this recipe is a keeper! Give yourself plenty of time-- there's a lot of messing around associated with this dish, but the time and effort was well worth it! I used a crock pot instead of a dutch over and it worked well! Enjoy!

Made this for Memorial day BBQ. I used regular mustard instead of dried and Hormel bacon pieces instead of slab bacon. It was very good. A little time consuming, but well worth the effort - especially if you dislike baked beans that start with canned pork-n-beans as I do.

These beans were wonderful! I don't think they needed to cook for the full five hours though, I liked them after one!! Will definately make these again soon, my kids loved them and they went well with ribs!

The other reviewers are right - the BBQ sauce is great. I would use it on chicken or ribs. But to me, it didn't really go with the beans. They tasted OK, but different from other beans - wouldn't really say it was better than others. Won't make this as a bean dish again.

I must be a complete idiot. I made this yesterday and it was WEIRD. The beans never softened enough despite soaking them overnight. Also, I kept adding stock and it was absorbed but the sauce never thickened after 3+ hours. I was given a Le Cruset bean pot for Christmas and was so excited to use it. Now I think it's cursed. :(

This is the best baked bean recipe I've found. The BBQ sauce is great too...mmm, try it on chicken or ribs *drool*

Great bean recipe. I served this for Father's Day 2002. It was very similar to a Cooking Light recipe which called for more onion, green pepper and celery. It definitely has good spice and it worth a repeat. I soaked the beans overnight before cooking.

Great recipe. Just for fun, I added a little bourbon to the sauce. The sauce is so good that I had to make a pot of it to try on grilled chicken. It was perfect - the best barbecue sauce recipe that I've found.

I had searched hard and long for the perfect Bean dish..This is it! I sauteed the vegetables for a long time, I carmelized them. I reduced the amount of brown sugar a bit and punched up the hot spices.

Making this dish was the first baked beans I've ever made but certainly not the last. Very impressive: full flavour, exactly the right amount of sugar. Served it with roast pork and corn bread. Need I say no leftovers?

Comfort food for me. I soaked my beans over night - always have. The BBQ sauce is so tasty it is hard not to eat it right out of the pan before it gets to the beans.
