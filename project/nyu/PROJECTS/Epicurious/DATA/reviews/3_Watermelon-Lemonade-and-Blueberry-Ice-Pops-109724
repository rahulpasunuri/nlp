I had a lot of left over watermelon and blueberries from a fruit salad i had made and this was the perfect way to not waste it! I used Splenda with the watermelon to cut down on some calories, but stuck with the real stuff for the blueberries since i wasn't sure how it'd come out with boiling the water and all.

I haven't tried it yet but I can imagine the watermelon part to taste bland so I would put a little strawberry syrup in it.

I didn't really like this recipe a lot. I think the best layer was the sour lemonade. I would make them again because they were fun to make but I would not eat one.
