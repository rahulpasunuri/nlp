Quick and Easy. I used half the sugar (I like a little less sweet) and it covered 24 red velvet cupcakes with a little extra to spare. Yum!

Delicious IF you add lemon juice and extra sugar. I added 3/4 cup of lemon juice, because we love lemon, and I don't even want to know how much sugar I added because it probably has taken a day or two off my lifespan. I made this with Tofutti (I know, disgusting) and Coconut Oil, softened. We're very allergic to dairy, but had to make a birthday cake for a special 7 year old, and so I did the unthinkable and bought one of the most disgusting products I can imagine. The lemon and sugar covered up the fake flavor nicely, and the end result was amazing!

Needs more lemon zest and I omitted the butter and about half of the sugar as well. The frosting has more body that way and less fat! When I made this recently for a family Christmas my dad thought that I was kidding about making the cake as he thought I bought it.

I love this recipe and made it tonight with clementine peel and zest instead of lemon. On chocolate brownies - YUM!

Loved it--great consistency for frosting, flavor what I expected. The lemon flavor was significant, but not overpowering. Everybody enjoyed.

This frosting is **extremely** rich (well, duh, look at the ingredients, right?) and would not have so much as a hint of lemon flavor unless you add the juice of up to 4 lemons. I did not have any problems with consistency, as I had anticipated per other reviews-- however, this is a frosting for spreading, not for sculpting.

This frosting is very tasty but if you're looking for a lemon flavor, which I imagine is the reason you're looking at this recipe, then you need to at least double the amount of zest and add the juice of a lemon or two. If you do that it actually tastes like lemon but it's then even more slippery. It was a very good lemon frosting after many additions of lemon flavoring but not sure if I'd make it again.

Great icing but I made a few modifications: I used 3x the lemon peel and I had to add more sugar to stiffen it up. It was too 'drippy' without the extra sugar.

Very delicious. The flavor is even better the second day. I've had it every year for my birthday for the past four years- I love it that much!

Made this for the Four Layer Lemon Torte and it was delicious!

Made this to go with the blueberry-lemon cake, and it was the best thing about it. Really wonderful, smooth, creamy, rich, SWEET. I took to heart the warnings about slipperiness and brought the components of the cake to my party in pieces, assembling them onsite and putting the cake back into the fridge to firm up. I'd make the frosting again anytime (it's by far the best cream cheese frosting I've ever tasted), but the cake was a complete bust.

Used half of this recipe. remember to sift your sugar, it will encourage smoothness. Added not only the zest of the lemon, but the juice of the entire lemon and a splash of lime juice. I needed a strong lemon and it worked out nicely. Added to this some leftover white chocolate ganache. Three forks for ease, reliability and taste.

I made this with the lemon-blueberry cake and it was great-- with a little extra zest, the lemon came through really nicely and it spread very easily. Excess frosting is great between graham crackers for several days too!

I took previous reviewers advice and used this on cupcakes - both the lkemon-blueberry ones and chocolate as well. I also tripled the amount of lemon in it. It was delicious.

Dangerous!! You make this one once and everyone must have it over and over again!! This recipe does blueberries a wonderful justice. It is an unforgettable desert!

I struggled a little bit with deciding how I would review this recipe. I thought that this was a delicious tasting lemon frosting~I think the best I have ever had. But honestly, I do not think that I would make it again. When I read an earlier review suggesting that it would be better used on cupcakes, I guess I wasn't paying attention very well. To say that is frosting is slippery is an understatement! If you are reading this 2nd review, take it seriously! It does taste delightful,no kidding, but to transport this cake from fridge to table is about as far as you can take it. It MUST remain cool for ANY presentation success. People loved it! I made the recipe as written, maybe if you used less butter.....but of course we all know that butter is what probably makes it so wonderful. Good Luck!

This was the most delicious frosting I've ever made, but found it to be very slippery. I've used it on all kinds of cakes and found that if it is used between layers of cake, the layers slip a bit, especially when I drove a cake to a friend's for a party. I think it would make an incredible frosting for cupcakes or cakes that you assemble and eat at home.

I made this to go with the cake and it was a hit at the bridal shower I was hostessing! I used 2 tsp of vanilla extract instead of 1 and I liked the flavor better. I plan on making this cake and frosting again!

I made this to frost the lemon-blueberry cake and it was easy and delicious.
