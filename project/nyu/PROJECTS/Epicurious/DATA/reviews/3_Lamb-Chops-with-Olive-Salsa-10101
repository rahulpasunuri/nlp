The lamb and olive salsa were excellent- the short marinade/spices on the lamb did not compete with the salsa at all. To address some of the issues that the other reviewers had, I would recommend using full fat yogurt in the salad, doubling the amount of yogurt, garlic, and mint in the salad, and adding a bit of lemon juice. This ties the whole dish together without beating you over the head with it. For a vegetable I sauteed eggplant, garlic (2 cloves) and green beans (steam them just a little bit first) in some olive oil with salt and pepper to taste. I would definitely make this recipe again with these changes.

Although the different parts of this dish were nice, the flavors did not seem to mix very well.

I agree with the previous reviewer - the salsa IS the recipe. The lamb preparation is nothing special. We used the leftover salsa on top of baguette slices as an appetizer. It was great.

The olive salsa is what makes this recipe special. It could accompany grilled pork as well...and even certain types of grilled fish (such as swordfish)...The accompanying potato salad lacks 'umph'.
