I was requested to bring "baked onions" to the Xmas dinner. "A Cook from Besthesda" saved the day for me. Definitely use aluminum foil to line your pan. I poured 1/2 cup of water in the pan to begin with and added 1/2 cup water each time I basted the onions with wine which was every 20 mins. Seemed to take the full 90 mins., in other words forever. Obviously didn't plan well and we managed to be 45 mins. late for the party.

I used vidalia onions and broiled them at the very end to get a nice caramelized top. Excellent, served with Osso Bucco and whipped potatoes. Everyone raved.

I made this recipe (I used yellow onions) last night and thorougly enjoyed it. It is easy and very flavorful. Based on the reviews I cut down on the baking time to almost half and the onions were great. I served it as an accompaniment to a Filet Mignon recipe from Bobby Flay.

Goes very well with any Steak or Beef roast receipe.I have added mushrooms to the pan also. Just delicious! The draw back is, it takes to long to cook.

Well...this recipe was simple enough to prepare. The final result, however, was a pretty small, quite unattractive, very overcooked, but reasonably nice tasting onion halve. In conclusion, I'd never bother with them again. Should anyone else have to, start with the biggest onions you can find, as they shrink up a lot. Salt and pepper the onions well. Add both the wine and the water at the beginning. Baste frequently right from the start. BE SURE to add water if necessary to keep some juices in the bottom of the pan or you'll be scrubbing all night. And begin checking for doneness after as little as 40-50 minutes. Better yet, try wrapping the onions up individually in aluminum foil and ignoring them for an hour.
