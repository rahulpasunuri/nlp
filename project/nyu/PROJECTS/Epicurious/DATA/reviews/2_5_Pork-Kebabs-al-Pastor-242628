Love the basting sauce and pork kebab portion of the recipe. Making the salsa is just too time consuming, so I substituted a store bought salsa instead. Makes great soft-shelled taco's.

I thought this was a great deal of work and expense for a less than stellar dish. Don't get me wrong, it was GOOD, but I was too worn out to enjoy it.

This was delicious. I let the pork cubes marinate for an hour in the fridge before skewering them. Also served it with some quick pickled red onions and a second avocado based salsa like they do in Mexico.
