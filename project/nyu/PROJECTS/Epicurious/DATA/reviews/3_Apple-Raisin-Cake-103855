I only had 1/4 cup of oil so I followed the advice of adding applesauce and OJ. I used 1/2 cup of OJ and 2 3.9 oz containers of natural applesauce (like what I put in the kids' lunchboxes)- with the 1/4 cup of oil. No problem on moistness - and just think of all the fat that was saved -it was a huge hit! Also used dried cranberries instead of raisins.

Over the years, I've made dozens of different apple cakes as a traditional Jewish New Year dessert - this is the best! I too substituted apple sauce for half the oil, and I also topped it with a thin rum/vanilla/powdered sugar glaze, just to gild the lily. It stays moist and delicious in an airtight container for days and days - not that it'll last that long.

I thought this was OK, although others who tried it really liked it. I made it because I had all the ingredients on hand. This definitely is one of those cakes that develop flavor with age. And, it retains its moistness over several days. I don't think I'll make again, though--there are other coffee cakes that I prefer.

I've made this cake several times - to rave reviews. I use canola oil, which may be a bit lighter. This is one of those "I'll just have a LITTLE bit more" reippes, and then the cake disappears.

Well loved cake. Substituted apple sauce for some of the oil as suggested - perfect!

This cake was delicious. In place of the 1/2 cup of extra oil, I added a 1/4 cup of orange juice and a 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce. It came out super moist. I also cut down the bake time. Try it!

A large cake, looks good, tastes good, is good. For a special occasion, plain or iced,wonderful, with Creme Fraiche as a dessert - superb.

Yuck! With all of the rave reviews, I really thought I would enjoy this cake. I didn't think it was any better than the yellow cake mixes you buy in a store, and the ingredients were basically the same (1 and half cups of oil). The oil made it heavy, the taste bland, and the texture uninteresting. This cake was tossed in the trash.

I made this cake for a gathering, but couldn't wait to try it. We had it the night before, warm, with vanilla ice cream and it was delicious. So good, in fact, that one of the younger girls (11) asked for the recipe. Next time I will increase the spices though.

I took the suggestion of cutting the oil in half and using applesauce instead. I came out great. Very moist yet with a great texture. I also used about double the amount of raisins. Served warm with caramel ice cream. Yum!

Hey, if you think the apple cake featured here is tasteless, try this one. You won't be sorry! It is extremely delicious! The tangy/sweet glaze on this moist apple cake is the perfect blending of flavors. 1-1/2 cups oil, 2 cups sugar, 3 beaten eggs, 3 cups flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 3 cups diced apples (McIntosh, Jonathan, Granny Smith or any tart apple). One cup chopped nuts (optional), and glaze. Combine oil and sugar. Blend in beaten eggs. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Add to oil and sugar mixture. Add vanilla. Add apples and nuts. Place in a greased 9 x 13 pan and bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes in a 300 degree oven. (Start checking for doneness after 1 hour and 10 minutes.) While cake is still warm, cover surface with glaze. Glaze: Combine 1 cup powdered sugar and juice of one lemon. Enjoy!

I agree with Carson City! This was a totally useless recipe! Too oily, and not enough taste to warrent using one and a half cups of fat again. Sorry, Gourmet.

Yuck. I thought this cake was a big fat bore! Just goes to show that not everyone can have the same opinion. Texture was a little odd, and the cake turned out slightly mushy. Won't repeat this one.

I followed the advice of many of my fellow reviewers and came up with a cake that I will definately make again... soak the raisins in 1/2 cup dark rum until they are plump (1/2 hour)- use dark brown sugar and raw sugar - use 1/2 the amount of oil & add 3/4 cup apple sauce - next time I will cut the apples into smaller pieces.- no frosting needed.

I made this in 8 individual small pans with enough left over for a loaf pan. Served as individual cakes with warm caramel sauce and ice cream for a dinner party was a big success. The loaf cake served the next morning with butter as a coffee cake was also a hit. This cake actually got better the second day. Make sure you put in the amount of apples called for, even though it may look like a lot as you're stirring. This recipe is a keeper!

I guess I am in the minority with this one, after reading all the ingredients in this recipe I really thought this was going to be something else. I found this cake to be very boring and uninteresting in flavour and texture. Sorry to all those who raved about it but this one is one you have to try for yourself and make up your own mind.l l

Wow - so many different feelings about this cake recipe! I made it per the recipe and found that it had very good flavor but I was expecting that it would be a bit more moist than it was - Especially with 1 1/2 cups of oil. I will definitely make this again and the next time I will try with part applesauce as some people have done. I agree with one of the reviews - with that much fattening oil, I expect a VERY moist cake. As far as getting too well done on the outside and not done enough on the inside, all I can say is that perhaps the temp in your oven is off a little bit. I did not have any problem whatsoever with how it baked.

Interesting that the alternative recipe offered in the post below has essentially the same ingredients in the same proportions as the recipe above (1 1/2 cups oil, 2 cups sugar, 3 eggs, 3 cups flour, diced apples), but is baked in a different pan for a different time/temperature. Maybe the pan and baking change would work for this recipe, too.

Excellent cake! I followed other reader's suggestions and used 3/4 cup of oil and 3/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce. Fuji applies worked well. It was a big hit and easy to prepare. I will definitely make it again.

Thanks to the reviewer from Rockford- I get so tired of logging on and finding comments like the one submitted by Buffalo. If we have a different opinion, why is that considered wrong? Who says yours is right, and ours is way off? Surprise surprise, this is the point of reviewing recipes- to share different points of view. If that's not what you want to hear, don't bother to log on to the rewiewing secion. To answer the question of whether or not we liked this cake, the answer is a big fat NO! It looked and smelled heavenly, but unfortunately tasted awful. It had a yucky texture, and, to justify eating a cake containing one and a half cups of oil, I think it should have been the most delicious cake I've ever baked, and it just wasn't. I've made recipes lower in fat that tasted a million times better; this was oily, and heavy, and not the autumn cake I'd serve to chase away the chills. I'm glad for those who liked it-don't berate me because I think another way!

I thought this cake was very good. I had it at a friend's house and made it myself. Its a very nice cake for autumn, not too sweet but rich. Tastes good slightly warm and I have kept it over 5 days and it still moist.

I didn't really care for this cake either. It was easy to make and the batter looked and smelled delicious, but the end result was a disappointment.

I guess I'm in the minority on this one, but I didn't love this cake. I would say it was good, but not great. I reduced the oil by half and replaced it with applesauce and that worked well. I think the thing I liked most was that it didn't require an electric mixer, but I've tasted better cakes (including low fat ones) that I would make before this one again.

I think the person who gave this 1 fork must not know how to follow the directions. This cake was delicious. I have made it twice for 2 different sets of people and everyone has loved it!

I served this to my eight-person family, and am sorry to say that not one liked this cake. Ugh. It had the strangest texture-- I think the cook that described it as seeming underbaked hit it right on the head. Didn't care for this one, and will stick to my usual fall apple cake recipe.

It was easy to make, and the family and co-workers raved and asked for the recipe. Instead of 1-1/2 cup oil, I used 3/4 cups each of oil and unsweetened applesauce - worked very well. If you like dense, moist cakes, this is one to make and enjoy.

Delicious! Looked really pretty sprinkled with sifted powdered sugar..thanks for the tip to decrease the oil, I'll try that next time. Definitely a nice keeper for fall.

This cake was moist and delicious. I soaked raisins in rum overnight for a little extra zing and frosted the cake with a cream cheese frosting. Really good!

I have rated this recipe a 3. However, I have served this cake with a warm cream caramel sauce (from a Nov.1999 issue of Bon Appetit). Served this way, they loved it so much, I had 2 people ask for the recipe and would rate it this way, a 4!!!! Will do it again!

Excellent cake! The cook's note in the recipie says it will keep for 5 days -- nice to know, but unnecessary - it won't last that long! My husband had taken a dig out of it before it cooled, it smelled so good baking. 1 cup of oil is plenty to produce a moist cake.

Rating: 2
I enjoyed this cake, but not quite enough to consider making it again. I find cakes made with oil rather than butter to have a flat, bland flavor and the only way to jazz it up is to use a LOT of spices. Butter tastes better!

This was the best apple cake I've ever made. I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil. The smell was delicious. My husband and I didn't even wait until it was fully cooled. I didn't use any icing - it was great just as it was.

It's pretty clear from reading the reviews that not everyone is looking for the same thing in an apple cake. I made this cake twice; once with 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce, and once with 1 1/4 cups of oil. I found very little difference in the two. Second time around, I cut down on the sugar. Everyone I served this to loved it. I baked mine in a convection oven for 50 minutes. Perfect!

I replaced 1/2 of the oil with unsweetened applesauce, used a few dried currants and chopped walnuts in place of the raisins and the results were spectacular! Friends and family want it again!!

Excellent cake. I used only 1 cup of oil and replaced the balance with 1/2 cup of apple sauce. For extra flavor, soak the raisins for an hour in dark rum and drain well before adding. Everybody raved about this cake.

I am sorry to say I was very disappointed in this cake. I agree that it was moist but I just did not love it. The outside also burnt before the middle was cooked which did not help. My oven is working fine and I used my regular bundt pan. I do love all the ingredients though so I am going to give it one more try. Seeing so many positive reviews makes me want to give this cake a second chance.

This cake got rave reviews. Everyone wanted the recipe. I did cut down on the oil and added applesauce (because of previous reviews) Would make it again.

Sorry to rain on the parade-- but, for some reason, I did not like this cake. It was moist, all right-- to the point of seeming underbaked. (It wasn't). IF I were to make this again, I would decrease the oil (I think one cup would be plenty), omit the raisins and perhaps add walnuts instead. I did think that the recommended apple (I used Cortland) was delicious, and that will be my apple of choice from now on for baking.

LOVED THIS ! Served with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce . Substituted the 1 1/2 cups oil with applesauce with great result - I prefer my fat grams in my ice cream , where they belong !!!

My review of the apple raisin cake is 3 on the scale of 1-4. It is absolutely delicious. I do think it is a little too oily. I think the next time I bake it I will try to cut down on the oil. My family loved it and I served it plain without any embellishment.

I shared this cake with my office to get several opinions, planning to make another for a holiday dinner. The cake was so well-received, I may need to make another one for the office! It really is one of the best-flavored and moistest cakes I've ever made. Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was unbelievable! It was so moist and was perfect as either a dessert cake or a coffee cake. It would keep very well on the counter for several days if it lasted that long as nobody could stop at one slice. I used Fuji apples with great success. You have to try this cake!

This cake was amazing. I made it after coming home from work last evening and it took no time at all. It was so good, I cut it in half and took half to my sisters' home and my brother's home. My brother couldn't wait to call and tell me how good it was. His exact words "this cake is smoking". Please try it hm-hm-hm good.
