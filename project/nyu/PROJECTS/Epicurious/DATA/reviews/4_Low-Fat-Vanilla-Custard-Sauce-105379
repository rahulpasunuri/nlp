I meant to add that after you add the hot milk to the eggs, and boil it again, let it cool down and give it a taste. Then, I added the butter (unsalted) and you'll know what I mean.

It was such a delicious recipe. Hard to think of it as low fat. I ended up adding: -pinch of cinnamon -2 tsp of vanilla extract (like someone suggested) -3 tsp of cornstarch (thought it could be a little bit thicker) -a little over 1 tsp of butter (this really gave it much more body without the guilt of too much fat) overall, delicious recipe.

Still delicious when made with skim milk! Also substituted 2 tsp organic vanilla extract for vanilla bean - tastes the same with less fuss and expense.

This is amazing. I used 2% milk and served it over the apple crumble pie on this website.

Pretty good. If I make it again I will use a little more sugar and use 2% milk.

It's tasty, no doubt about that. But what nobody mentioned in the reviews was how superliciously easy this was to make!

Very yummy and light. It was so good I was almost tempted to drink it right out of the pan.

Wow - is this good! I paired it with the Summer Pudding from Epicurious (the one made with French bread, strawberries and frozen mixed berries). Great combination, and perfect for a warm summer day.

We were looking for an alternative to the high fat typical custard. We love this recipe. It is very tasty and we serve it with apple tarts and with our apple pie. We have made it several times and it has become a favorite sauce!

Delicious light,vanilla flavor. Made this for a relative who is on a fat restricted diet. Wonderful flavor without the fat. A keeper!
