I had a couple problems with the recipe as written. I agree with the other reviewers that its way too much bread and not enough garlic, so I modified that immediately. I had to toss out my first batch of roasted tomatoes because at 8 minutes they were already mush and disintegrating. I can't believe recipe says 12-16 minutes. Even for the beans 12 minutes was ample. Next time I would drop that to 10 minutes, (though the beans I used were very thin.) I used 8 oz feta cut in cubes, regular (brown) balsamic and added a roasted yellow bell pepper. I skipped capers because another dish I was serving had them, but would have added them otherwise. This seems best at room temperature, so if you make it early allow time to take it out of fridge to warm up a bit. I added bread cubes last and saved extra bread so can have leftovers today without soggy bread.

Who says vegetarian meals are all rabbit food? This dish is fantastic: a real standout on this site. I made the dish exactly as written, including with white balsamic, and it worked out fine. I understand the point made by others about less bread, more garlic. That could help the recipe even more, but I didn't think the proportions were out of whack as written. Fantastic.

Was I on drugs when I wrote my first anonymous review of this? Four freaking stars all the way! The boy and I drool when we even think about this recipe. I do only use one small baguette, but everything else as is, white balsamic and all. The bomb, the end.

Really good. Served with barbecued boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Made for a great meal. Even my 18-year-old son liked it.

This is my go to recipe whenever I have vegetarians over. I used less bread and extra garlic, which I think is a must. I also used half red basil which gave it a nice colour. The flavours come together really well and it makes for a great one dish meal.

Excellent. Recommend using more garlic. Great as leftovers, don't add the bread until the last minute.

Uhhhhh-mazing! I happen to be living overseas, and couldn't access fresh basil, mozzarella, capers or balsamic. HOWEVER, even with dried basil, some regular Turkish white cheese, and a splash of white vinegar, it was great. Highly recommended, and I can't wait until I have a grocery store near me to do this the right way! Also, like others suggested, I pan-sauteed the green beans quickly with just some olive oil. I had oversalted my bread cubes, so it worked out perfectly in balancing it out.

The melding of the variety of flavors was delicious. Who would have guessed?Used grated cheese instead of diced.

Quick pan fry beans with chopped shallot. Used whole wheat bread instead of french. Zucchini instead of green beans. Still amazing and that what I had in stock.

this was a bit time consuming but really worth the effort. i used zucchini instead of the green beans because that is all i had but it went well with the recipe. i assembled it early in the day but added the bread at the last minute so it wouldn't get soggy. this is a pretty dish to look at and a flavorful one to eat!

i tend to embellish recipes in general, so i added a chopped yellow bell pepper and a sliced red onion to the green beans, which added a lot of color and additional flavors. based on the other reviews, i left out the mozzarella but added some crumbled feta, which stood up to the balsamic and garlic really well. i wanted this to last for a couple of meals, so i only combined the vegetables and bread that i was going to eat at a time and kept the leftovers separate. combining them in a container in the morning before work gave everything plenty of time to meld before lunch, at which point i microwaved it for just a minute or two to warm slightly. it worked perfectly and the leftovers were just as good as the first time around. i will definitely make this again and try some different variations on the veggies.

this is the second time i've made this, the first time being so delicious. i'm taking it to a BBQ where the hostess is doing the vegan thing right now. so i left out the mozzarella and added a cubed zucchini and peeled eggplant. roasted those along with the tomatoes and green beans. i haven't actually assembled it yet, but the dressing tastes as good as last time, and the bread cubes are tasty. just going to bring the dressing and bread separately and toss it all there. delish, regardless of how authentic or accurate or whatever.

I apologize if I sound snobby or snooty, but I am writing from Italy, where I have lived my whole life, and I can assure you that panzanella is entirely different. It is a peasant's dish, conceived to use up day-old or week-old bread, and the bread is soaked in water, then the water is squeezed out, and the remaining, soggy, crumbled-up bread is mixed with a variety of ingredients (that depends on who makes it and what they happen to have in the kitchen), especially tomatoes, celery and onions, and sometimes tuna, lots of olive oil and garlic... I love the real dish, and it is frustrating to see a salad with copious amounts of crispy croutons being touted as a panzanella. Nevertheless, I love this website and I hope you don't mind my intervention... it was meant with the best of intentions!

I cut the bread quantity and substituted the mozzarella for some leftover boiled chicken I brushed with honey and grilled. Tomatoes got soggy and tasted bitter (I guess they were not too good) so next time I'll try fresh ones to see if it gets the 4 forks :-) Ah, and I added some oregano and paprika to the garlic oil. Yummy!

As other reviewers said, the good thing about this dish is that you can add pretty much anything you like. I used about half of the bread called for in the recipe, though I could see needing the full amount if you were adding many more vegetables. Also added roasted red peppers and they worked nicely.

Rating: 4
This recipe is great, and you can basically put everything but the kitchen sink in it! I followed other reviewers suggestions by adding 1/3 of the bread the recipe calls for, then I added more tomatoes, roasted red pepper, roasted zucchini squash, and little pieces of chicken breast. It was fantastic and definitely good enough for company but simple enough for a weekday meal.

Wow! I was surprised at how much we loved this dish. Like other reviewers, I significantly reduced the amount of bread, and I used honey instead of sugar. Easy, impressive, and uniquely delicious. Will make again and again.

A wonderful salad, beautiful to look at and delicious. (I agree that there were too many croutons, but I served some on the side by themselves and they were quickly eaten.) I love the mix of flavours in this salad and the touch of sweetness along with the piquancy. The second time I made this recipe, I made the croutons a couple of days ahead, which made it easy and fast to put the rest of the salad together.

This was scrummy and although seemed a bit complex to begin with, having done it once, will be a recipie you can put together easily. Will definately become a classic weekday dish in our household and would be nice as a side salad if friends come round for dinner.

Very yummy--if I made it again I would add more tomatoes. I tossed in some romaine lettuce at the last moment, which was nice for a little crispness. Loved the contrast of hot/cold in this recipe. This salad is NOT GOOD leftover the next day--soggy bread and garbanzos, and no crunch left in the greeen beans at all. Make sure you have enough pals around to eat it the first day!

The flavor is delicious and the presentation is greatalthough I agree with most of the others that you need to cut down on the bread.--as written it kind of overtakes evertying else in the dish. Otherwise it is great. I would also add more vegetbales but nly because I personally like them.

I'm a sucker for panzanella of all sorts, and this one is a keeper! this was salad was great, and just got better as it sat around. I had to change a few things based on what was/not in the house, but it was delicious with feta cheese instead of mozarella, a can of olive oil-packed tuna as one person suggested, and some shallots in the dressing (and everything else as written). I also had no bread for croutons, but put in a bunch of homemade bagel chips- worked in a pinch though I'm sure the bread would be yummier. everyone including kids devoured it!

I thought this was great, a big hit at my gay pride BBQ. I put all ingredients together before hand except bread and dressing so it worked well as a make-ahead dish

I agree with the other reviewers, use half the bread and add more vegetables. We were not fond of the salad dressing but when we used a Caesar type dressing with parmesean cheese it improved it to a four star salad.

Rating: 4
FANTASTIC!!! Only modification I made was to use dried basil instead of the fresh, at about 1/3 of the written amount. The flavor of the mozzarella blended well with everything else, but next time I may try provolone instead, just for a little more cheesy flavor. DO TRY THIS.

The boyfriend loved this, though I was less enthralled. Same thoughts as previous -- too-crunchy bread overwhelmed the fresh mozzarella, halved and still have lots left over. But vinaigrette is really good and other flavors mesh nicely. I might make this again, also with more tomatoes and less bread.

This was delicious. I served it to company and it received several thumbs up. I made it with the full amount of bread cubes, so there was plenty left over. I just had some for lunch, a day and a half later, and the bread held up pretty well and it still tastes yummy. It would be a great pot-luck dish.

I used less bread (2 - 3 cups) and thought that this was really good. I did toast the bread until crunchy, because it absorbs the dressing and softens once the salad is assembled. I will definitely make this again.

I agree that using less bread and toasting it for a shorter period of time is a good idea. The fresh mozzarella's taste gets totally lost in the recipe and might as well not be there. This said, it is a great combination of flavors, and our guests gave it rave reviews.

Great taste, although w-a-y too much bread. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used fresh mint. Good taste, although different than this recipe is looking for. I also roasted up a pretty yellow pepper for contrast. Next time I'll cut the amount of bread by a quarter, at least, increase the amount and variety of vegetables, and include the fresh basil. (I made a whole batch of this and intended to eat on it for a week while husband was out of town. Two days into it, I felt like a stuffed turkey! Note to self: cut down on bread and don't forget the vegetables!!) Again, it has a great taste--roasted vegetables and XVOO, a good balsamic vinegar and fresh mozzarella. Worth a repeat . . . . . .

I liked the combination of ingredients and the taste, but I think it would be better with less bread, and if the bread were less crunchy (maybe just baked for 5-8 minutes). Following the recipe makes a big bowl of croutons with occasional sightings of the other items. I will also use more tomatoes next time to provide more liquid without having to add more oil.

Rating: 4
Loved it, wouldn't change a thing. I followed the recipe exactly except that I held half of everything aside at the end to save for another meal (the recipe makes more food than two people can handle and I didn't want soggy bread in the leftovers). This was an easy way to half the recipe and I still have some great looking leftovers!

This hasn't yet been whipped up in my kitchen but I can tell from the ingredients that it will be three or four forks! More to follow after I put this together for a picnic after ourlocal annual Highland Games on Saturday.. I'll let you know for sure, R
