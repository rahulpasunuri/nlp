Do you really need a recipe for roast carrots? They're good and I like the dill idea, but vague directions didn't help. Roast time was about 30 min. for my medium sized carrots that I trimmed and peeled, and I didn't need to broil to brown them. Very simple and tasty, good to be reminded of a use for carrots.
