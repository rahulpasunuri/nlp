I've made several variations of this pie over the years, and think it's pretty solid. Sometimes I use cardamom, sometimes I use cinnamon. I almost never use the vanilla beans, partly because they're so expensive and partly because I find the flavor overwhelming. My favorite thing to do is sub 1 cup berries for 1 cup of the peaches. Blueberries are best. I agree with other reviewers that it tastes better the next day.

Forgot to say I also peeled the peaches. Peeling them is super easy if you dip them in almost boiling water for about 30 seconds first.

I used about 1/4 tsp. cardamom and didn't find it overpowering once the pie had cooled. I used very juicy peaches, but I don't like using too much flour in the filling (I think it makes it taste bland) so to make sure the pie wasn't runny I cooked the peaches, 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, and sugar on low-med heat for about 15 minutes (tossing more or less constantly to prevent overcooking), and then drained the mixture and reduced the liquid over med-high heat until it started to harden when cooled (mostly sugar). Then I turned off the heat and immediately re-added the peach mixture, vanilla seeds, ground cardamom, another 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, and about 1/4 cup flour. I used about 50% more peaches than the recipe suggested, and about as much more sugar as well, and a different (but similar) crust recipe. I baked the pie at about 375-400 for about 1.5 hours. It was amazing! Best peach pie I've ever made. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

good...but not amazing..OK, lets go over the tweeks I based on the reviews. First, I left on the skins (I wouldn't do that again), my fiance felt the peaches were crunchy because of them, but then agian, she's a snob. I omitted the cardamon and used cinnamon (about 4 shakes) and used 3 cap fulls of bourbon vanilla (should have used 2) but thats why I'm a better cook and not a baker. Oh, I also used a slotted spoon to put the peaches in the pie (so it wouldn't turn out so soggy) and then spooned in about 4 spoons of the sauce before I closed up the pie. The pie was good, but tasted better the next morning. Fiance is from Vienna and doesn't get our "pie's", so unless I used very ripe peaches and took the skins off, I probably wouldn't make this again.

Can't wait to make this recipe again! I have never used cardamom before and found it to add a nice delicate flavor (not overwhelming). I didn't have vanilla bean, so I added 3 teaspoons of vanilla to the sliced peaches and tossed to coat before incorporating the sugar mixture. I used my own pie crust recipe and added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to flour. Delicious!

I made this pie today for a luncheon, followed the recipe as written. The pie was wonderful and everyone wanted the recipe. All eight women agreed it was the best peach pie they had ever had. My neighbor gave me a basket of peaches she had just picked and I'm glad I tried this pie.

I loved this crust but found the cardamon overwhelmed the peach and the vanilla flavor not pronounced enough. The crust recipe is a keeper, though.

My mother-in-law is a peach pie fanatic and she said that this was the best she's ever had - so there! The accompanying pie crust recipe is the absolute best - wonderful!

This is my new standard peach pie recipe. When I make it for company, I get rave reviews. I put the leftover vanilla bean in a jar with Bakers Suger and use it on sliced peaches with a dash of cardomom over ice cream when I don't have time to make a pie. Let them sit for a bit to bring the juices out. Yummy!

Very good! A nice variety for pie.

Rating: 2
When I read the other reviews, I wonder what I did wrong. I think the cardamom ruined the taste of the whole pie. The filling was runny but did thicken up after baking. Overall, I'm not sure it was worth the effort, mainly due to the spice.

Rating: 3
My filling was also a bit 'soupy' and made the bottom pie crust soggy. Used exact cooking time and vanilla paste instead of bean. I've raved about the pie crust before (w/ the blueberry pie), but this time wow! Glazed w/ whip creme and sugar and well anyway I was eating chunks of the pie crust off the leftovers.

The pie came out so delicious everyone loved it. I put more flour in since I thought it might be a bit juicy. I served it warm with ice cream..great

Rating: 3
This was a very good dessert ! The pie crust was outstanding ! Extremely flaky. The filling was juicy, even though I drained the peach mixture before filling it. And, to respond to earlier comments, I found the cooking time to be correct. I covered the outer edges with foil after 35 minutes and the top after 45 minutes. It baked for approximately 55 more minutes.

Hmmmm... I think perhaps I need enlightened here. I made this pie and didn't really like it, was very disappointed in it, and my guests weren't thrilled, either. It seemed to be too heavy on the cardamom and too light on the vanilla, and I could taste the vinegar in the crust. I'd make it again with a different crust, no cardamom, and double the vanilla -- perhaps even using extract. Everyone who has reviewed this raved, though, so if I'm in the minority, maybe I screwed up somehow.....

Rating: 4
WOW!!! I've never seen a pie crust with vinegar, and when it dripped in my kitchen, it almost scared me off. But I sure am glad I continued. I got the most fabulous peach pie ever. My husband loved it! I've made it several times last summer, and can't wait for the real good peaches to make more this summer.

I love this recipe! It is always eaten up quickly at my house. It is definately a summer must-bake!

This makes for a really luscious pie. The only thing I change is to add a few more tablespoons of flour and a half teaspoon of arrowroot powder to thicken the juice-- I've made it several times now, and either the peaches I buy are just very juicy, or it needs more thickener each time. However, the flavor is superb and the spices don't outshine the natural peach flavor.

Best fruit pie ever.

Everyone loved this pie! I've made it twice,the first time with real vanilla and the second time with vanilla extract. The real vanilla really added something extra. Also, once i was came just shy of the amount of peaches i needed, so i added some fresh blueberries. It turned out beautifully and I would make it that way again even if I had enough peaches! Definitely a recipe worth making again!

I followed this receipe to a T. I found the bottom crust to be uncooked ( because of the baking sheet- cooked 1 hr 45mins) and the crust got soft and mushy by the following day. i wasted expensive Cardamom, vanilla beans and not to mention peeling 4 lbs of ripe peaches. I was very diappointed and i wouldn't attempt to bake it again, nor would i recommend it to anyone,

Rating: 3
Next time I'll use a little less cardamon -- this much was a little overpowering.

Rating: 2
I cooked this pie for 45 minutes because the crust looked good and browned, but the bottom crust was kind of mushy, next time I would definitely cook it longer. Otherwise it was tasty.

YUMMY! My family LOVES this pie! In reading some of the other reviews I concur: skip the cardamom and use cinnamon, and the pie only needs to be cooked 45 min - 1 hour depending on how brown you like your crust. Speaking of crust: the pie crust included with the recipe is the BEST ever! It is not hard to work with if it's kept cold. I rolled out my top and bottom crust and put it in the fridge while I made the filling. It also helps to roll it out between two pieces of wax paper. With regard to peeling peaches - I need to share my grandmother's handy tip: cut a small "X" in the bottom of the peach, plunge each peach in boiling water for 10 seconds, remove and cool until you can handle them. Go to the "X" and use a knife to peel off the skin. You won't lose a bit of the flesh and you may not even need a knife if the peaches are really ripe. This WILL NOT work if the peaches aren't relatively ripe.

We really enjoy this pie. Love the cardamom and vanilla flavors with the peach, yummmmmmmm. Just made the 3rd one with the last of the season's peaches.

My Sis-in-Law gave me a huge box of small but ripe peaches. As I had read this recipe, I was all set to go for it. At least an hour into peeling the tiny little peaches, I really began to regret ever reading any recipe, much less one for peach pie. But it was very good and I really am glad I read all the reviews, especially on draining the peaches and who really needs cardamon...wow that stuff is expensive! Finally after mixing and draining with a slotted spoon, I added more sugar and flour as the sweetness and thickener had somewhat disappered in the juice and these were tart little peaches. I'm hoping for zuchinni on their next visit!

Based on all the tips and comments below, I used 2 vanilla beans, pure vanilla extract, cinnamon in lieu of cardomom and a 45 minute baking time. I still found it was lacking a distinct vanilla flavor, but all in all, this was very good. Unfortunately, my peaches weren't at their peak, so I'm off to the local Farmer's Market in search of the sweetest peach to try this recipe again since even my husband says it's a keeper.

Rating: 3
This was so easy and delicious. Any tips for making crust that won't break when you roll it out? My bottom crust was pieced together and my top crust came out pretty well, not to mention how deliciious it was. I think I let it thaw to much and that made it crack up? Nonetheless, it was very good. And the filling was yummy. I added 2 vanilla beans and a teaspoon of vanilla extract and it tasted great. My husband and neighbors raved. My peaches were a little to runny so make sure you drain them very well before putting them in the pie dish. Add the extra vanilla and this pie is a big hit.

This is lovely. I've made this pie twice now, and this second time I made a couple of changes. I added an extra vanilla bean, and STILL couldn't really identify it as a flavoring. I skipped the cardamom, and used cinnamon in its place, and also used a pint of sweet, sweet raspberries to make it a raspberry peach pie. Yum! The berries really created almost a totally new pie, but, it was delicious. (I liked it made with only peaches, too, but the berries were from a farmer's market and I couldn't refuse). I used an all lard crust, and I think this pie, modified to my liking, is killer!

Rating: 3
This is a delicious pie. I used a Pillsbury Ready Crust and only cooked it for 45 minutes - any longer and the crust would have been ruined. The filling was delicious, but next time I will use 2 or more vanilla beans as I am a vanilla freak. Be sure to use the best peaches for this one. Underripe will not do. I also used 1/4 tsp cinnamon instead of the cardomom. This one is going in my permanent collection.

Great, but cooking time is too long (at that temperature). I cooked my pie @ 425 for half an hour, and then covered it, and continued to cook the pie @ 350 for about another 20 minutes. I used another crust recipe. Perfect! Thanks for the tapioca tip. It worked beautifully, and now I have a use for that box of tapioca that's been sitting in my cupbord since the beginning of time! Try it.

Rating: 3
I have made this pie twice. I tried cooking it for the 1 hr 45 mins but this is too long. Fourty-five minutes worked the second time. I also did not put sugar on the crust the second time. I agree that more vanilla would help. Could you use some vanilla extract? The crust recipe is great!!!!

Rating: 4
Ditto for all the comments below. I too used cinnamon and my own crust recipe. Also, I substituted quick cooking tapioca for the flour, as I always find too much flour in pies gives the fruit a cloudy appearance and starchy taste. I felt much more vanilla could have been used-- I'll put in two next time and see what happens.

Rating: 4
Great pie! I modified it, as did other reviewers. I used about 1 and 1/4 vanilla bean, and still felt a more pronounced flavor was lacking (though the seeds were hard to scrape out-- I may not have gotten them all). I substituted cinnamon for the cardamom-- the latter was too expensive, and anyhow I got turned off by the smell of it. I only had about 5 cups of peaches, but I didn't feel the pie was too "empty". Lastly, reading all the negative reviews about this crust (mostly on the blueberry lattice pie page) convinced me to use my own tried-and-true-- all lard, no butter, an egg, vinegar, and cake and pastry flour. Not the healthiest, I know, but butter and shortning are not exactly virtuous, either, sooo.... Anyway, I loved this pie, even with all my modifications. I wish peach season weren't ending so soon!

THis was delicious! I made it for my family and everyone loved loved loved it! The dough can be a little difficult to work with unless you get it really cold. I'd refrigerate overnight next time. Otherwise Perfect and DELICIOUS!!

This pie is delicious - perfect with a scoop of good vanilla icecream - but it isn't the easiest pie to make. I'd agree that the crust was very difficult to work with, but if you're willing to give it a try, the results are wonderful - the flakiest crust I've ever eaten. I too had difficulty peeling the peaches - I'd try blanching them next time first. Also, skip the cardamom - I used cinnamon and nutmeg instead.

This was my first peach pie and I loved it, and my husband did too. I thought it was very easy and fast. I took the advice below and used a Pillsbury double pie crust and it was pretty good and fast! I used ripe peaches, ready to eat, and think that it made the flavor. I substituted 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of cardamom, because cardamom was $11.99 a bottle! Most importantly, I put foil on crimped edges, baked 45 minutes, removed foil and baked another 15 minutes. I used less peaches, and less sugar also. Great!

Made this pie last night everyone thought it was great. I reduced the sugar and the baking time to one hour. I too had a disaster with peeling the peaches and finally just left them on which didn't matter. I thought the cardamom tasted great but overpowered the vanilla just a bit.

Rating: 1
I baked this EXACTLY as directed, and this was a disaster! The baking time is way too long, and the oven way too hot. A friend had these same problems with the blueberry pie with lattice crust. Don't ask me how she could've formed a lattice shape-- this dough was murder to work with-- a real pain that had to be pressed into the pie plate, rather than gently rolled. Doesn't Bon Appetit test out their recipes anymore??!

The pie was quite tasty but I could have used more vanilla flavor as well. I will make this again with more vanilla flavoring next time.

Rating: 4
I thought the pie was wonderful. Especially liked the use of the vanilla bean. I too think more vanilla flavor could be added. I do have a question though. How can you cook a pie for an hour and 45 minutes at 400 degrees? I did 45 minutes with the edges covered and an additional 15 after that. I thought this was a misprint! My pie turned out just fine and the filling was nice and thick, just perfect!

Rating: 4
Wonderful pie!! The family loves it. I would agree to increase the vanilla some and adjust the sugar for the ripeness of the peaches. The recommended crust was perfect with it!

Rating: 3
Not too bad. I would add 2 vanilla beans - it could use just a touch more of a vailla taste to balance out the sweet peaches. This pie also works best with peaches that aren't fully ripe yet. It was hard to get the skin off of the peaches as they were still very firm, but the end result was worth it. My boyfriend LOVES this pie - and he's not even a big dessert fan. I'd make it again. I also agree with Sally Starrfield - use the Pillsbury deep dish - not worth the time and effort to make the crust.

I actually only made the filling and used it on shortcake biscuits. It was a fantastic hit. I'll make this again!

Rating: 3
Fabulous! I omitted some of the sugar but will omit even more next time and probably add more flour since it was quite runny due to very ripe peaches. I had never cooked with a vanilla bean before but will definitely do that again. I love it's taste and aroma. I ALWAYS use Pillsbury deep dish pie crust. I've yet to find a pie crust recipe worth all that time and work.

This was my first attempt at baking a peach pie. I struggled with my few "not so ripe peaches"(hard to remove the fuzzy skin.) Thank goodness the rest were ready.I didn't have cardamom,so that was deleted. By the way, what is cardamom? The vanilla bean added a nice accent to the peaches. I cheated with store bought pie crust. I might not bake it as long. It got kinda toasty even with the foil. The kids and the hubby liked it. I'd make it again, now if I could remember to buy vanilla ice cream...

This pie filling did not set up and had major overflow-even in a 10" pie dish. It took 1 hour forty five minutes to bake which made the crust too brown. If I make it again, I will pre-cook the filling.

This pie is fabulous. The filling is delicious. I used part fresh peaches and part frozen peaches. I served this warm with homemade vanilla ice cream. Even good the next day. I did not have any trouble with the crust. Turned out beautiful and easy to work with. Lovely summertime dessert.

I used Pillsbury's pie crusts for convenience. And used about 3/4 of the flour mixture, which was plenty. The pie was very juicy and the vanilla bean added a wonderful nutty vanilla flavor. A big hit with the beau.

This pie delicious, but manageability of the crust something else. I literally had to scrap the crust up and press into a pie plate. Don't see how you could ever make a lattice for the blueberry pie. I followed the recipe very carefully, chilling dough overnight. By the way, it's not my first attempt at making pie crust--I have been making pies for forty years. Just wanted to try one with butter and vinegar.
