Good recipe. My husband didn't "get the roasted red peppers" with this recipe. But I liked it. I served it with steamed broccoli and rice.

this was both beautiful and yummy. We used only red pepper (with one jalepeno because we had it). We would bake it 1 to 2 minutes less -- sockeye can get dry very quickly. But we will definitely do this one again!!

An excellent recipe for what I find to be a very difficult fish to cook well.... As another reviewer commented, if you like your salmon on the rare side, stick to 15 mins no longer - I convinced myself it looked too rare and added 2 minutes to the cook time - of course, it was about 2 minutes overcooked.

Super easy and delicious! The cooking time for this recipe is perfect if the fish is at room temperature and you like your salmon rare - remember, it will continue to cook as it rests.

Made this last night with a large, 3 lb single piece of sockeye. I, too, added sliced red onions that I precooked slightly together with the garlic in the microwave about 90 seconds. I scattered these around the fish, together with the capers and roasted peppers. I used red and green - still made a gorgeous presentation. Served room temperature as part of a large buffet. Total coooking time was closer to 25 minutes. Would definitely make again with the splash of white wine and an infused oil and garlic mixture.

This was terrific. Finally I know what to do when sockeye salmon goes on sale. The timing is about right. I wonder if people who said it took long were using "regular" salmon, which tends to be thicker. The peppers are not hard to do, so I wouldn't substitute jarred peppers. Also delicious left over. This would be a wonderful company dish, pretty, easy to prepare in advance and delicious.

Liked this simple recipe. I used fresh peppers and although they were good, I'll try the bottled next time. Will definitely make again.

Cooking time is off by at least half, I baked mine for 25-30 minutes total. I pre-roasted the garlic, primarily because I prefer it that way, but next time will at least double from four to eight to ten cloves. Pasta of choice is a good compliment. No sauce need, the flavor of the Salmon is all you need.

We enjoyed this dish, though I too found that 16 minutes was not enough to cook a substantial piece of salmon. Mine was 12 ounces. Either have your fishmonger cut yours into 6 ounce fillets, or add 5-10 minutes to cooking time. We eat salmon weekly, and this is a tasty preparation to add to the cycle. I served it with roasted potatoes and a greek salad with an oregano dressing.

Nothing spectacular, but decent. I roasted sliced onions and chopped garlic in 2T olive oil, then laid the fish on this bed to roast with the bell pepper and capers. Cooked for 15 mins (these were fillets, and not very thick). Used roasted red bell pepper from the jar (I think fresh would have added a bit of oomph). Served with sauteed spinach, spiked with a shake of dried hot red pepper.

One day I actually had all these exact ingredients on hand for some surprise dinner guests, and I made it quickly and with no fuss. Everyone enjoyed it. If you use the steak cut instead of filet cut, the cooking time is perfect. Served with a side of fresh broccoli sauteed with garlic and roasted potatoes. Delish, easy, quick.

This has become our favorite way to bake salmon. My only quibble: 15 minutes in the oven will produce an underdone, cool center if the fish is shaped as it often is, with a thicker part with a thinner "tail." I recommend adding 5 min. to the recipe.

Quick meal with very nice results. Beautiful on the platter.

Followed the recipe with the recommendations of cooking on a bed of onions. Made once by roasting my own peppers, second time using store bought. No one could tell the difference. Don't be shy with the spices. This is a great recipe with amazing results for little effort if you use jarred peppers. Try it!

This is a very easy and fantasic dish. A couple of notes - I used salt packed capers which had the right saltiness for the dish. If you use liquid packed capers, be ready with additional sea salt at the end to get the right taste. Also, the dish would have been better if the garlic had been made into an infusion with some of the oil and then spread over the fish. This is a definate winner.

I like the combo of flavors, but it's apparently *very* important to press the fish quite dry. I didn't, and my thick salmon fillets were incredibly soggy. I'm not even sure that drying would have made much difference; if I made this again, I'd broil the salmon. Also, the garlic doesn't get anywhere near edibly soft in the time given, so I'd roast that separately, and for longer. Frankly, I'd prefer pieces of broiled salmon, the sliced peppers and capers, roasted garlic, and some parmesan tossed with fettucine.

Excellent! I added a couple of splashes of white wine to the baking dish with the salmon. We absolutely loved it and will definitely make it again.

A nice Italian spin on an otherwise simple, yet very tasty baked salmon dish. The trick to the dish is using good olive oil. I added some vidalia onions to sit under the salmon while it was baking to mix with the garlic. I also topped the salmon with some garlic slices to get a full infusion. You can save yourself a lot of time by buying pre-roasted peppers, although it won't have quite the same taste. The capers really go nicely with the peppers. sprinkle on some parsely before cooking. I served with sauted spinach and a quick capellini with olive oil and garlic (aglio olio) and kicked it up with a little hot pepper. Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe - easy and a wonderful combination of flavors. We roasted yellow and orange peppers, using wild salmon, and served it with brown basmati rice. I loved the flavor combination of the capers and the wild salmon.
