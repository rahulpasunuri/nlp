Great receipe, delicious and pretty on the plate.

This was an extremely tasty and healthy option to traditional eggplant parmesan. And, I have to admit that I prefer it to the traditional version. I agree with the other reviews that broiling was the key to success. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!

Better than I expected. I'd back off on the salt a bit.

Super easy and delicious. It comes very close to traditional Eggplant Parmesan with less fuss. I will be eating eggplant more often. I did what others suggested which was to finish it off under the broiler - a great suggestion!

Very easy and very good. I also added a little goat cheese on top. It tastes like grilled pizza...only healthier:)

Delicious. Made knife and fork open face sandwiches: toasted sourdough, pesto, grilled eggplant, marinara, fresh tomato slices, fresh moz, parm/panko/basil mix, all under broiler (far from heat - burned the topping on first attempt!) Many great suggestions in the reviews.

my husband doesn't really like eggplant, but he went back for 2 extra servings! i was so surprised how easy and quick this was to make on the grill... and pretty healthy too, since it is not "battered and fried in oil". i didn't have parmesan on hand, so I used Boursin cheese (with garlic and herbs) along with some grated fontina. I cut the eggplant into circles by accident, but result was that they came out cute, like little pizzas. I topped the eggplant rounds with a sliced Yellow heirloom tomatoes and like the other reviewer, I finished it all in the broiler so that the tomatoes would heat up and the cheese on top would be more melty. fresh basil makes this dish!

Great recipe, and fairly simple. I had the eggplant, which was why I was looking for a recipe in the first place, but used a few different ingredients. I used Panko breadcrumbs, a little cheddar cheese instead of "pizza"/4 cheese and some dried sage and fresh oregano & parsley. Turned out great. Next time I think I will try moving it into the broiler for the finish (I was cooking something else in my oven!). But it's a good recipe.

This was simply amazing! I just did a few things differently. I peeled the eggplant, I used 2 by the way (which was perfect for 2 people and a half serving left over), and sliced it lengthwise 1/2" thick, and grilled it. Then I took it off the grill and heated up the broiler. I sliced campari tomatoes 1/4" thick and placed flat on top of the eggplant (which I spread out onto a cookie sheet). Put it in the oven under the broiler and roast the tomatoes on top of the eggplant (season w/ s&p) until the skins are shriveled. Once they are done, take it out ladle homemade tomato sauce over top and place sliced fresh mozzarella on top and sprinkle 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs on top. Put back under the broiler until crumbs are golden and cheese is melted. The best dish I've had in a long time. Unbelievable simple perfection.

Love this recipe. So easy and a great way to get the taste of eggplant parmesan without all of the calories. Read more about my experience cooking it here: http://www.adventuroustastes.com/2010/09/grilled-eggplant-parmesan.html

I'm only giving this two forks because I made a lot of changes, and I don't think I would have liked the original recipe. I doubled the cheeses, made this in a broiler and added my own marinara from scratch. Topped with some fresh mozzarella, it was delicious but probably not as healthy as the real recipe. It was healthier than breading the eggplant and frying it though. Turned out great, perfect for a crisp fall night.

Much healthier than the traditional eggplant parm with all the flavor! I skipped the grilled tomatoes and served eggplant over a bed of angel hair and topped with fresh marinara sauce. Outstanding recipe. Definitely a keeper!!

Just made this tonight and my whole family--including my picky son--loved it! I broiled it instead of grilling but followed the recipe pretty much exactly as written. Great as a main dish or side...thumbs up!

Wow! My husband made this last night for dinner and we couldn't stop raving about how delicious it came out. Used crumbled feta, grated provolone & garlic jack for the cheese mix; Japanese panko with dried Italian herbs along with some fresh thyme. Skipped the garlic oil due to the garlic jack cheese. Used a mandoline to cut the eggplant evenly into 1/4 inch slices. Once cooked, stacked 3 slices on top of one another and served it on whole wheat spaghetti. Love that it's much lighter than your traditional eggplant parmesan. Will definitely make this again!

This was such a nice change from the traditional, heavy, and fried eggplant parm! I skipped the breadcrumbs because I forgot them and it was still delicious. It truly doesn't take more than a couple of minutes on each side. If you cook it too long, it dries out quickly. You can chop the tomatoes up like a bruschetta with the basil and top it that way as well. You can also use fresh mozzarella, which gives it a more authentic flavor than store bought shredded cheese.

A mandoline makes this an easy, simple recipe-and gives you a uniform thickness for the eggplant slices. This uniformity is important for evenly cooking the eggplant. My family prefers this to traditional eggplant parm, and it takes much less time. The caramelizing effect of grilling imparts a nice sweetness to the eggplant. Also, you can experiment with the cheese mixture and dry basil will do if you do not have fresh. Another variation I do is to mix roasted garlic into the cheese mixture. Put this on pasta and pass red "gravy" separately if you like.

We really enjoyed this dish and incorporated some of the suggested changes by others such as using only Parmesan cheese and pouring a bit of tomato sauce over the eggplant and angel hair when serving. Prep time is really quite short.

I made a lot of changes and this still turned out great; I think without the changes it might not have been so tasty, thus the three forks. I used all parmesan cheese instead of mixed cheese and made my own breadcrumbs from whole-wheat bread. I didn't want to use tomato slices since the eggplant parmesan I've had before had more of a casserole-y feel, so I used 1/2 cup tomato sauce and 1/2 cup sliced cherry tomatoes - I added a pinch of chili powder and a pinch of dried basil since I didn't have fresh basil. Since I didn't have garlic olive-oil, I just plopped a clove into a glass measuring cup with olive oil and microwaved it until it seemed sufficiently infused. I'm making this again and am going to broil it instead of grilling it so that the cheese crisps up more.

This was absolutely delicious! Quickly sauteed 5 minced cloves of garlic in olive oil then added more to make 1/4 cup. Any combo of hard cheeses will work. So simple yet so flavorful!

This is a great summertime meal. I added garlic powder to the breadcrumbs since I didn't have garlic flavored oil. It was delicious, a great meal when eggplant is plentiful and it is too hot out for standard eggplant parm.

This was AMAZING!!! Neither my husband, nor myself, are eggplant fans, but our neighbor gave us several. I added extra garlic,used paremsan cheese only, and served it on top of angel hair pasta. I now crave this dish, and cannot wait to make it again!!

This looked really pretty, but it was nothing special -- basically just cheese melted over eggplant.

I've made this several times and loved it. I'll have to try it with the pesto next time. The eggplant I tried slicing lengthwise but it didn't come out as nice as when I cut it cross wise in little circles. I also used my grill pan and the circles were perfect for serving. I've used several kinds of tomatos but my favorite are the roma which are just the right size for the egg plant.

This was very good! and I would have it again even though eggplant is not my favorite.I also added some garlic to the olive oil that was brushed on the eggplant and to the cheese mixture and I cut the eggplant across instead of lengthwise. Very flavorful and light

Absolutely delicious! Easy to prepare and cook with yummy results. I didn't have fresh basil so used the dry stuff along with basil oil rather than garlic. The basil flavor surfaced beautifully. I also added garlic and some other Italian spices to the cheese mixture. We served it over a bed of angel hair pasta with some fresh tomato sauce. Simply scrumptious!

I am not a big eggplant fan, but my husband is - so, I tried this. It is delicious. I can't wait to have it again. I followed recipe pretty much exactly, but added galric salt to cheese mixture, and garlic oil to tomotoes. YUM YUM!!!!

I do not like eggplant, but I thought this was VERY good. The only thing I did differently was to add garlic to the bread crumb mixture. Good way to use up neighbors excess eggplant!!

Rating: 3
I went with earlier reviewers' suggestion about using pesto. I brushed a thick layer of pesto on each slice before putting the tomatoes, etc. on, and the results were quite tasty. Be sure not to overcook once you put the cheese mixture on top. Good quick, different vegetarian meal.

I loved this dish, it is so flavorful! My husband, who usually eats anything, liked it enough for one meal but not beyond that--he wasn't crazy about it. I guess it maybe depends on how adventurous your diners are (or at least how much they like eggplant). I will definitely make this again for my vegetarian mother, though.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! It even won over my meat-and-potatoes father, who was skeptical about trying eggplant for the first time. The only change I would make is leaving out the added salt- the cheese and italian breadcrumbs make it salty enough to please. This is one of my new favorite recipes- try it!

Most Excellent! And a very forgiving recipe, as I made some rather large errors and it still turned out great. I accidently cut the eggplant cross-wise instead of lengthwise (3/4 inch widths). Then I accidently salted it and let it drain in a collander for 30 minutes. I also forgot to buy basil but substituted pesto instead at the suggestion of another cook here, which produced a fabulous flavor. I omitted the garlic oil, but used rosemary oil just because I had it on hand. So I wound up with these pesto eggplant discs with sizzling tomatoes and cheese on top. This would make a great first course served that way, by the way. And I think using eggplant rounds rather than lengths might make it easier to serve. I think this recipe might be a bit bland if prepared the suggested way with just basil. The pesto really made it sing. I used five plum tomatoes, although I don't know their weight because they came from the garden.

This was the first time I ever had eggplant. It was great. I even got my picky eater (5yrs. old) to eat 3/4 of one. He said it tasted like garlic bread. It's really inexpensive to make, quick, and easy. It has become a regular on our menu.

Rating: 4
Yummmmm. I made a few slight changes. I spread some pesto on the eggplant when I added the tomato and cheese mixture. So, I did not use extra basil or the garlic olive oil, just plain olive oil. I also cut the tomato slices thick, as my knife was not up to the task of thin slicing. It was better than conventional eggplant parmesan which I love but avoid because of all the grease and calories. This was a delicious lighter version plus there was an extra layer of flavor from the grilling. Easy to make too!

I LOVE this recipe and its versatility. My changes: I crushed 2 cloves of garlic in the olive oil, and of course brushed the garlic onto the eggplant too. I topped the eggplant with sliced Jersey tomatoes (the best), followed by some baby spinach, and then ricotta mixed w/ shredded cheese (less than the recipe calls for). Finally, I stacked the finished eggplants in 2 layers in my casserole dish- so it was actually more like a lasagna. I kept the whole thing warm in the oven and topped w/ the basil before serving. It's an awesome summer meal, easy to do on a weeknight.

As the lone voice of dissention here, my family thought this was nice but definitely short of wonderful. I will make it again but will eliminate the sliced tomatoes and, after grilling, I will instead top with the tomato sauce from the Eggplant Parmesan recipe (August 2004) from this same site. The sauce can be made ahead of time so it's ready when we're ready to grill.

This recipe was amazing...and I don't even love eggplant that much! My dad had given me a couple from his garden, along with tomatoes, and WOW, how yummy! I did not have garlic oil and honestly, forgot all about that fact until I was eating it just moments ago. I do use kosher salt, which always imparts a great flavor, so I would recommend that. Excellent recipe...will definitely make again! Plus, so easy...took minutes!

I really enjoyed this dish. I doubled it, and found that slicing all those plum tomatoes was the only problem. Tasty larger tomatoes might be a help (though hard to find sometimes).

I love this recipe! It's so simple and the grilling really brings out the flavor of the eggplant! A bit messy on the grill...it's worth it, we've had this once a week at least! Never leftovers!! Good for summer cooking.

I browned thin slices of garlic in olive oil and then placed the slices under the tomato. The second time I made this I also cut the eggplant thicker than recommended. I agree with the other ratings this dish gets five forks if possible!

Oh my! This has to be the best recipe I have received on this website. Even better with fresh tomatoes from the garden. I didn't have garlic olive oil so just crushed some fresh garlic into olive oil and was fabulous!!! My husband and I fought over the last piece.

You have GOT to try this!!....I would give this dish 20 forks if I could. Not only is it absolutely delish, but also so easy to make! I like to serve this with a big Caesar salad and a crusty baguette for a summer-lightened Italian dinner.

a big thank you from one of the many vegetarian followers you must have. this was simple, quick and terrific. see, meat can move on over and take a lesson on the grill.
