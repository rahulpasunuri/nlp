This was the best cheese bread I've ever made. The dough was fantastic, and and its flavor greatly complimented the cheese layer. Alterations: I didn't end up using all of the cheese that is called for in the recipe. I probably used about 1/2 pound mozzarella (actually used part-skim), and 2/3 pound sharp cheddar (instead of the brick or munster cheese). I did this because I couldn't fit all of the cheese in the dough. As a side note, a 1/4 oz package of yeast is 2 1/4 tsp.

This bread is excellent! I made it one day because I was itching to cook and it turned out perfectly! The only thing was that I didn't have any muenster or brick cheese so I just used sharp cheddar...and it was still perfect. Some suggestions: use parmesan and mozzerella and sprinkle some rosemary on the inside/top...use cheddar and mozzerella and sprinkle some chives on the inside. The bread itself is delicious and basic, and the cheesy inside leaves plenty of room for experimentation! Try it, you'll LOVE it!

I lost this family favorite several years ago. I'm glad to have found it. It's an easy bread to make and it's always a hit. Brick cheese may be too strong of a flavor for some. I usually use a sharp cheddar with the mozzarella. This is a favorite, especially with my oldest son.
