Excellent! I could not find plum jam so I made it with fig jam, and it was great. Easy to make, a keeper.

This is one of my favorites. I follow the recipe and it is perfect. It plates beautiful and looks impressive for very little effort. I have also used the sauce over boneless chicken breasts and it tastes great. I serve it with a wild rice and steamed broccoli.

I loved the sauce! I read other reviews and used chinese plum sauce instead of plum jam, added baby carrots and had to bake for 45-50 minutes to cook through. Lime is most important ingredient as it completely changes the final flavors and nuances of the sauce.

This was a really good recipe for cornish hens, but I changed a few things. I used only cherry preserves that I bought from Trader Joe's with Vanilla Rum and curry powder for the glaze. Also, I cooked the bird for a bit longer to get a better browned color and flavor. I didn't use all the glaze for the bird. I added butter to the remainder and poured over the bird when served. I served it directly over basmati rice to let the juices and the sauce mix with the rice. I served a sauteed blend of baby carrots and zucchini w/garlic and butter along side. My fiancee and I loved it and I definitely will make it again!

I think if I made this again, I would marinate the hens in the sauce overnight. I cheated and roasted the hens at 350 for about 1-1.5 hours in the sauce, but I didn't cook the sauce before hand. A lot less work and pans, but it was still very yummy. I didn't know what chutney was, so I improvised. I cut up a mango, put it in a blender with some sugar and mixed that up with the curry and plum jam when it was smooth. Is this wrong? it tasted just fine!

Excellent recipe. Little spicy and little sweet -- complex flavor was just right. My boyfriend ate an entire hen. I doubled the recipe for 2 hens and used my own plum jam that I made. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Definitely a keeper to use again.

Mine was not so sweet. I used Plum Butter from Dillman Farms (online) and Major Grey Chutney. I doubled the recipe for the sauce (but not the curry powder) - it was perfect! My only mistake was that I didn't cook the hen nearly long enough. I have a hard time telling when poultry is done and not overcooked - help? I will definitely try this again and use a poultry I am more familiar with - I bet duck would be awesome with this sauce.

I used Old Farmhouse Chutney and it turned out great. I cut up a sweet potato, a small squash and a couple of carrots and placed them under the hens. They absorbed the jucies and the sauce. Very tasty. I am making this dish again.

I would rate this 4 forks, but only after some changes. I saw from previous reviews that the glaze was judged as too sweet. I chose a jar of chinese plum sauce along with Major Grey's Chutney and did not use the jam. Because the hens exuded a lot of fat during cooking, I baked it for 25 minutes and poured out the juices to use later for the sauce. I then reglazed it, put it in the refrigerator until my dinner party, theb baked it another 25 minutes. It was 4 forks and received raves from my guests.

We have used this recipe 3 times now, and find it so easy to prepare, and very tasty. We used plain whit rice with 1/2 tsp of curry in it, for 2 people. The rice compliments the cornish hen.

This was very good, if a little on the sweet side. I made two hens and doubled the sauce, to which I added a bit of salt and lime juice to cut the sweetness. Very easy to put together, and do heed the advice from a Cook from Virginia about thoroughly lining the roasting pan with foil.

This is absolutely delicious. It is a wonderful dish for company. This is definitely a keeper.

This was very easy, different and tasty. My guests loved it, especially those with a sweet tooth. I found it a bit too sweet, but good nonetheless. I imagine that there is a fair amount of variation, depending on the brand of chutney and jam. It's important to use the foil lined baking sheet; otherwise the mess from the sugary glaze will be unspeakable.
