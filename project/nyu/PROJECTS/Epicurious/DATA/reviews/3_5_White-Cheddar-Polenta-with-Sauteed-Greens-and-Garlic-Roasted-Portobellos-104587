I was really disappointed in this. I followed the recipe pretty closely. The polenta was very salty and I didnt feel like all of the ingredients went together very well.

We loved this. Everything came out perfect, and the sauteed greens went so well with the mushrooms. I used a garlic cheddar cheese which made it even that much better. I served it with the Zinfandel Braised Short Ribs, which left a lot to be desired, but at least the side was outstanding!

Absolutely wonderful! I plan on making it again without changing a thing. The white cheddar (I used an Irish white) was absolutely perfect with the Polenta.

This was so delicious and very easy. I used baby bellas & gruyere cheese since that is what I had on hand but followed the recipe other than that. Next time I will add in some rosemary and use a bit more salt. My husband (former chef) loved it and wanted me to make it again tonight!!

Delicious. I made simplified one step: I just cut the mushrooms in chunks and sauteed them with the garlic in oil in a large skillet for 15-20 minutes. Added chicken stock when it got dry. Added the chopped greens to the same skillet to cook for 5 min. or so with the mushrooms. Also added a pinch of red pepper flakes at the end for some zing. We loved it!

Delicious - Is a favorite with my husband and I. I substitute Parmesan when I don't have cheddar. I roasted red onion and red bell pepper along with the portabello and only used fresh spinach. Very satisfying!

i agree -- a bit uninspired and bland. not bad, not inspiring. easy enough, i guess. why in the world would you sully your chard with that vile spinach, tho?

Perhaps it was my tinkering with the ingredients: red chard instead of Swiss, reconstituted garlic instead of fresh, dry parsley (which I don't care for much anyway), and Italian and Mexican cheeses (store brand). The polenta was too salty and I thought too cheesy (although my husband said he couldn't even taste cheese!), possibly to offset the rather bland spinach and chard combo. Mixed with the greens combo, the mushrooms, which had become a bit desiccated in the oven, perked up a bit and added a good flavor to the dish. I had also added a dash of sherry vinegar to the greens due to the fact that the iron in them isn't bioavailable unless there's some acid present. The small amount did not give the dish a sour taste and, indeed, it was not detectable. I really wanted to like this dish as it is relatively easy to make and it uses greens, but this dish, I think even made to the letter, is missing something. Perhaps it is tomato, perhaps it is a spice or two, but it is definitely lacking. (One thought I had was to substitute cilantro for the boring parsley.)

Like another reviewer, I added a little roasted garlic and served with cherry tomatoes. It was delicious!

Very easy and simply gourmet. I prepared the mushroom as directed but then added a can of diced tomatoes, pressed garlic and a tablespoon of fresh rosemary. The tomatoes added the perfect flavor to complement the richness of this dish. With regards to the Polenta, I only added 1/2 tablespoon of butter and 1/2 cup of gruyere cheese (instead of cheddar) - it was still incredibly rich. I didn't have chard, so I just used spinach. Delicious!

I used this recipe as inspiration and it turned out really great. Here's how it went. I roasted the portobellos as instructed but I added quartered roma tomatoes and sprinkled everything with probably a good tablespoon of fresh rosemary and three cloves of minced garlic, plus a pinch of salt and fresh cracked pepper. I didn't have cheddar so I substituted fresh grated, quality parmesan in the polenta. Lastly, I did not use spinach but rather just green chard slowly cooked down with another clove of garlic plus salt and pepper. Don't let the garlic brown or it turns bitter. It was absolutely delicious with a full bodied red wine. Very colorful too, and good for you. :)

I wasn't crazy about this meal, and my guests were fairly mum about it as well (never a good sign). All of the elements were okay by themselves, but I didn't feel that they worked all that well together and, in general, just seemed to be missing something - too bland for our tastes. I won't bother to make again.

Loved the polenta, greens and 'shrooms, but found the combination of all those riches a bit too heavy/rich together. I think I'll substitute a side of broiled tomatoes - no cheese! - for the portos the the next time. Also might try with a nice mild bleu like Maytag instead.

wonderful! Just what I needed to add to our lenten menus. It was easy to prepare and very tasty. I think perhaps next time I'll add a bit more herbs or a hint of hot pepper to give it a bit more zip.

I substituted a 6 oz log of goat cheese for the cheddar and doubled the mushrooms. It was a HUGE hit! The leftovers are even fabulous!

This dish was beautiful but the flavors didn't quite come together for me. I think might not have cooked the polenta long enough. I will probably try again and maybe brighten up the polenta with sundried tomatoes or something.

This was a real crowd-pleaser, and was a perfect meal to make on a rainy, cold night in March. The greens made the dress very showy, and overall, it tasted wonderful! I definitely recommend this recipe.

It's almost like a grown-up version of Mac and Cheese. The greens and portobellos make you feel like you're eating something healthy, despite all the cheese and butter :) I was a little suspicious of the Swiss Chard, but it turned ou really delicious. Good winter comfort food!

Made this for a family of mushroom-haters and they loved it. I threw a little white wine in with the greens and added some thyme, shallots and sun-dried tomato bits to the portobellos. The polenta needed no adjustments. Excellent!

We loved it. A bit of work, worth it. Used baby spinach for the greens. Added some sauteed shitake (only because I had some) used a Near East polenta with cheese/tomato & already seasoned just to make it easier. This recipe is adaptable. My husband loved it ( a real carnivore)

This was a big hit at a dinner party with both vegetarians and meat-eaters. This could also work as an appetizer course using smaller portions. Great combination of flavors! Definitely a keeper.

To editors of this site -- please change first sentence describing mushroom prep, otherwise people who cook as they read will mess this up. It presently seems as if you're supposed to chop the mushrooms finely. It should specify you chop the mushroom STEMS finely, otherwise you'll ruin your portobellos before you get to the next step.

My wife and I have made this dish several times with excellent results. It's a great winter evening dish.

This is a very good but very rich dish. It is a complete meal with only a salad needed as a side dish. In answer to the Cook From New York: there is only one mushroom type used - the preparation calls for separating and chopping the stems and then removing the 'gills' from the caps, slicing and adding those to the chopped stems.

I think you may want to look either at the ingredient list or the first paragraph. Two different mushroom preparations are described and only one calling for mushrooms on the infregients list. Confused, please respond

Very good, well-balanced dish. The mushrooms go very well with polenta, and the greens add just the right flavor. In my opinion, you have to make your own polenta. Instant just isn't the same. Besides, it's pretty easy and quick.

This recipe is full of wonderful flavors. I used a box of polenta (Fantastic brand)pre-flavored with bits of tomato and garlic - excellent. However, this recipe leaves you with with a super-dry tongue...strange, but true for both times I made this dish...I think it's the calcium-rich greens!

Very Good. The ingredients balance eachother perfectly.

Very tasty as is. I love polenta. And mushrooms.

While not terribly healthy - it is delicious and easy to make. I use less cheese and throw some roasted garlic in the polenta. Delish meatless meal.

A very tasty dish. I didn't have Swiss Chard and substituted Arugula, which worked fine. Definitely will stay in my recipe file.

This dish was very tasty. I used sharp white cheddar cheese in the receipe and I don't think I would use the sharp cheddar again. I might try mild or even mild yellow cheddar. The sharp white gave the polenta a funny taste. Other than that I enjoyed the dish. I would this as a side dish.

I think that this dish makes a great meal - nutritious, tasty, and relatively easy to prepare. I also disagree with the other reviewer; I do not think that the greens were too bitter or that the polenta was too salty.

Very tasty and unique. I couldn't find white cheddar so I used yellow and it was fine. I went heavy on the portobellos and made gravy with the juices after they cooked. I served the gravy along side the prepared dish. Excellent, even though the dish didn't need it. I put only a heavy dash of salt in the polenta and it was perfect. I also didn't find a problem with the texture or taste of the greens as a previous cook did.

My family and I really enjoyed this meal. I wanted to present something different for dinner that night, and this turned out flavorful and healthy. I would definitely make this again.

An interesting dish, but needs several adjustments. The polenta was much too salty--probably half the salt would do. The greens were quite astringent; white stemmed chard would be better. The portobellos were very tasty.

My family loves this recipe. It's really easy to make and is really delicious. Even my 2 year old enjoys it!
