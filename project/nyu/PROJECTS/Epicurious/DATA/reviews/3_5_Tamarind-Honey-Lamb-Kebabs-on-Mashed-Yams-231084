Instead of tamarind concentrate we used about 2x the amount of some tamarind sauce (the kind you would get at an Indian restaurant to go with your samosas). Ours was homemade by my boyfriend's mom, but I don't think that made a huge difference. Just used sambal oloek and some chopped garlic for the chili garlic sauce. Flavors paired surprisingly well with the yams, and this is mostly a very easy dish. However, It took longer than the time suggested to get the outsides browned, and turning the skewers was pretty tough, plus the meat never got truly charred before we knew we had to take it out to prevent it from getting tough. Nevertheless, taste and texture were excellent. We were lucky to get the meat to the temp we like it, which can be a challenge with skewers like this--not so easy to just go by touch, unlike a steak in a pan that you could poke with your finger.

I added shredded manchego cheese and half and half to the mashed yams and they became stupendous. The lamb was quite tasty as well, but not outstanding as I had hoped.

I love this recipe. Never make the yams, but the meat is great. It works just as well with pork tenderloin cut into cubes as with lamb.

The only reason I gave this 3 forks instead of four is because I wasn't crazy about the mashed yams. The lamb, however, is excellent and easy to make. I would suggest serving with a side of squash instead (see Apple-filled Acorn Squash Rings with Curry Butter on Epicurious) for a middle-east inspired meal. A great dish for Rosh Hashana or Passover.

The marinade was really easy and really delicious. Convenient ingredients that created an overall exciting change to our normal lamb marinade. The only complaint was that the honey burned rather quickly and made me concerned as the dish was being grilled, but it turned out the flavor was only enhanced. Will definitely be making this again and again.

A surprisingly easy and fun dish. Served with a curried vegetable couscous for a meal with even more flavor.

I couldn't find any boneless lamb, so I used 1 inch loin chops-turned out well. Served with 5 spice mashed sweet potatoes.

I've made this recipe twice now, both times with great results. I've used both boneless chicken and lamb, and while I like the lamb, the chicken worked out wonderfully as well.

I tried this recipe again, and increased the amount of chilli sauce, reduced the amount of honey and it was really tasty. An easy main course perfect for any weeknight or even when guests stop by!

Tasty, quick lamb dish. However, my husband found it to be a bit too sweet. I would cut out the amount of honey next time and increase the garlic chilli sauce.

I used pork tenderloin cut into medallions, marinated them for 30 minutes and grilled them..... Delicious. A sweet dish, but the combination on top of sweet potatoes goes well. Serve a side dish that balances the sweetness and richness of the meat and potatoes.
