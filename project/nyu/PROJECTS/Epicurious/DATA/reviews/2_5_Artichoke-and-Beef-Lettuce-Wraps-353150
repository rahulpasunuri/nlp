A friend made these for a get together at my house. They were a huge hit. I don't understand the bad reviews. Only thing I will add when I make this (and I will) are toasted pine nuts. I like a little crunch.

I found this recipe to be very tasty. Two differences are that I used more cheese (I bought pre-grated and it wasn't very flavorful) and I wrapped the lettuce in flour tortillas. I also made it the night before serving it for lunch, and the flavors were better the next day. The recipe makes a LOT more than 4 servings, so I had it for a while. I started putting just a little mayo and some basil dijon mustard on the tortillas under the lettuce and I added some fresh diced tomatoes. Both additions made it even tastier. My guests all enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again. Simple and tasty.

This was awful. I have never written a review before but I felt I must warn others about this recipe. We ended up throwing the whole thing out. I made it as the recipe instructed and it was not edible.
