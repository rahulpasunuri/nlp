This is our favorite squash soup. Most of the time I use just butternut squash which I roast, caned corn and chicken stock.

Be sure to make the corn relish! Its just not the same without it. I liked the corn relish best the next day because the corn had absorbed all the flavors and then they just exploded in your mouth with flavor!

This was so good! I used chicken broth and a jalapeño as suggested. Will deffinately make again.

Like a few others, I too used chicken stock instead of water. I also took the advise of another reviewer and used one large jalapeno. Wow! That really pulled the soup together with just a subtle kick. The corn relish is a must as it adds another dimension to the soup. Definitely a keeper recipe.

A big hit this year for Thanksgiving. A good dish for everyone from kids to grandparents. I'd never had the opportunity to use calabaza squash before, though I've seen it regularly at my local market. The rind is thicker than on a butternut squash, and it took a little longer to remove it, but it was worth it. The flavor is like a mild butternut, or if you can imagine a combination of a zucchini flavor w butternut. Delicious, and in general it's very inexpensive in comparison to other winter squashes. Being on a tight budget, I'm thinking I'll be using it a lot more in the near future.

This was very good and very satisfying. Along with a big green salad, it made an excellent dinner. I used one can of corn kernels rather than fresh corn, and I added it to the soup in the last few minutes so it would be warm.

Terrific soup! I too added stock instead of water and reduced the salt by one tsp. I also added one large jalapeno pepper to the soup at the saute stage. We loved the finished product and are looking forward to leftovers tonight!

Totally delicious. I added a bit more cayenne and did it with butternut squash. My roommates and I loved it and it didn't kill my college kid wallet!

Wow! So I couldn't find either of the listed squashes but I used butternut and it came out delicious! I also used canned corn. I'm sure it would be better with fresh but the canned was still very good (and easier). As many others suggested I par roasted the butternut ahead of adding it to the soup. It may not be necessary but the cooking time once in the pot would be longer. The lime in the relish adds a magical little twist. Very satisfying meal or great starter!

Just to clarify (though it's probably obvious): I bake the squash, and then proceed as per the recipe, i.e., the only difference is that I do not cook the squash raw but pre-baked.

Rating: 4
I have made this a few times and it is absolutely delicious (served it at a dinner party, and some guest were completely blown away by it). One change I make is that I BAKE the squash until soft in the oven. I started doing it primarily to make peeling & chopping it easier, but I think that it enhances (mellows down?) the flavor it as well. Also, if possible, I combine both the squashes suggested in the recipe. I think that the relish is a must. Although to simplify (and even out) things, I simply mix it into the soup at the end.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if something was wrong with the ingredients to produce such an unpleasant soup... is calabaza normally weak on flavour? I did love the relish but the soup was sort of wishy washy and overwhelmingly coconutty but not in a good way. Will not make again.

Rating: 4
This soup is excellent! The relish definitely enhances the flavors. I made with kabocha and frozen corn, since it's hard to find fresh right now. Would up the cayenne next time. Yum!

Rating: 4
Without the relish, I would give the soup 2 1/2 forks. However, the relish made this dish and I would not leave it out. I made the soup with butternut squash instead of calabaza, and it worked well. This makes eight HUGE servings. I would halve it if I was making it for four or even five people.

This soup is absolutely fantastic! It is the best soup I've ever made. The flavors are incredible. I did double the cayenne, definitely add the relish..it doesn't need it, but really adds to the soup. I was very impressed!

My sister in law served this soup to us for lunch. I made it tonight and added 1 small jalepeno & 1 small serrano to the onion saute along with a little (about a dime size) of grated fresh ginger. I also used chicken broth instead of the water. It was so yummy. Next time I will double the relish as it really makes the dish special.

The first time I had this soup, it was the first course to the Beer Marinated Flank Steak, also on this site. It was a delious starter. I made it last night for book club and it received rave reviews. I subbed butternut squash for calabaza and it worked just fine. Will definately make it again.

Very Good! Top with crushed tortilla chips and sour cream. I doubled the corn relish too.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! Made it with calabaza (unlike the cook from Los Angeles, I found it very easy to peel and cut up). Substituted chicken broth for the water, doubled the coconut milk (because I had a big can and didn't want any leftovers), and added considerably more cayenne -- otherwise adhered to the recipe as written. We loved the texture and flavor the relish added. My husband and 2 neighbors (one of whom is 13 years old) deemed it a keeper that should be made on a regular basis!

Rating: 4
this is truly exceptional. I roasted the calabaza 375 for 30-40 mins until soft and easy to cut. Up the cayenne and added some garlic. this soup is amazing! however, the relish is what it takes it to the next level. don't skip it!

Excellent soup with or without salsa. Hubby says this is a keeper. I changed it a bit because I didn't have all the ingredients. My substitutions were butternut squash, chicken stock, 1/4 C frozen corn kernels in the soup and only a sprinkle of cayenne. For the salsa I substituted lemon juice, honey, frozen corn and a white onion.

This took more like an hour for me to make, but the results were well worth it. The soup wouldn't be remarkable without the corn relish. Definitely don't skip it. I used frozen corn and it came out fine. Makes about four or five main servings.

I used kabocha, frozen roasted corn and chicken stock instead of water. Yummy. The relish is not only tasty but provides the much needed acid to balance the soup. Yum!

Fantastic - make with confidence! Used chicken stock, roasted butternut squash and frozen corn (1/4 cup kernels pureed with soup since no cobs to add corn flavor). Immersion blender made this so easy. I love recipes that are super easy and make me look like I know what I'm doing :-)

Wonderful soup with balanced flavors. I am a chef and I made this for my guests and they loved it. Can be a bit spicy though if you have people who are sensitive to spice (and I only used the 1/4 tsp cayenne!) I used the kabocha squash since that was readily available. I liked but didn't love the corn relish... would be equally as fantastic without. And I didn't have corn cobs (or fresh corn) so I didn't include the corn in the actual cooking of the soup. Overall delightful!

Just made this soup from a small pumpkin I grew in my backyard. I made it according to the recipe, but added a little more lime juice since I served it to lime-lovers, and it disappeared fast. Best fall soup ever!

This went straight to my "all time favorites" folder. I got a kabocha at the farmers market and roasted it in the oven. Easy to remove from shell after cooking and great texture. From there I followed this recipe to the letter and the resultant soup is amazing. I made it three days ago and tonight I'm making my second batch. Cannot keep it in the refrig. This is a totally unique and addictive soup! Love it.

I used two large yams instead of squash because I had them and wanted to use them up. So maybe I'm reviewing a different soup but it was quite tasty and easy. I also used chicken broth instead of water and doubled the cayenne for extra spiciness.

What a great fall soup! Used chicken stock instead of water and added some fresh ginger to give it some extra zip. Ate it with and without the corn salsa and was great either way, but prefered it with. Used Kabocha squash which was difficult to work with - next time I will either roast beforehand or use a different variety of squash. Will certainly make again.

This soup was incredible & so easy with an immersion blender. I wish I'd used farmer's market corn instead of corn from the grocery. Even though the kind I used was never frozen the taste is so different! I'll definitely make this again. I used butternut squash.

The fresh crunchy corn salsa makes this soup superb. The soup itself is good but I found it a little bland without the salsa. To kick it up a notch, I added a cup of carrots, a large apple, a tablespoon of freshly chopped ginger and substituted chicken for vegetable broth. It put the soup over the top and was a great starter at my dinner party. I will defintiely make this again and again.

Rating: 4
I substituted the cilantro stems in the soup with lemongrass and galangal in order to turn it into something more Asian, but otherwise followed the recipe. The corn salsa can be made ahead more than the one hour noted. I made mine about 12 hours before serving and it held up perfectly.

Rating: 4
This soup is sweet and spicy and quite delicious. It is also faster to cook than most squash soups. I used a kombocha squash, but a prepared butternut squash would have made things even easier. My only modification was not cooking the corn kernels, as the raw kernels were extremely sweet and tender. Our guests raved about this dish.

Rating: 4
This was an amazing soup! I think you can probably use any type of squash. Mine was made with summer squash and turned out perfectly. The richness of the coconut and the freshness of the corn salsa makes this soup good for summer or winter. I will be making this again and again.

I made this substituting a local sqush here in Germany where I live, and it turned out amazing! I did use the advice of another cook and added a little chicken base :o) My husband and I both loved this soup and I will definitely make it again! Also, I garnished it with a little balsamic glaze, which really complimented the flavor (and looked nice!)

Loved this soup--very yummy and wonderful that it's vegan! However, I found that right before I was about to serve it, it was lacking some flavor, so I ended up adding 2 chicken boullion cubes and it was much better. The lime from the relish adds a little pop of flavor in your mouth to go with the coconutty-soup. Delicious!!

Delicious soup! Subbed butternut squash for Calabaza but roasted it first. I added a little dried lemongrass and extra lime juice before pureeing. I also mixed half regular coconut milk and lite coconut milk to cut on the calories. It was still incredibly creamy and I will use all lite coconut milk next time. I could not believe how tasty this soup was! I will continue to make it

Very good. Used butternut squash as calabaza hard to find..would use less water next time or sub some quality vegetable stock for same (although quality fresh corn cobs act as a stock in the water, but I didn't have). I roasted (although you could microwave) the squash first to add depth of flavor, then peeled.Finished with dash of nutmeg to taste. Can swirl with cream or creme fraiche for serving, with dollop of the relish Can play with this soup, adding fresh shrimp or crab as garnish in summer, or all sorts of relishes and frizzled veg in winter. BTW..I added coconut milk at end to preclude curdling...

I made this last year for Thanksgiving, fearing that the picky eaters would hear a strange ingredient or taste it and pass. I doubled the recipe with no adjustments. Big surprise, ALL loved it! Many asked for seconds! One of the best soups I have ever had. I held onto one serving and savored it a second time the next day!

This soup was fantastic. I used butternut squash. Two of my favorite things, squash and coconut milk, and my 3rd fave, cilantro. Don't skip the relish, it made the dish. Used fresh off the cob corn-don't bother to cook, it's crunchy and sweet as is. can't wait to make again.

This soup was a big big hit and may be my favorite of all times. The best part of making it with fresh corn is eating the remaining kernels after the cobs have cooked with the rest of the ingredients... delicious!

This is now my husband and my favourite pumpkin soup recipe. The relish is a must, and when I dont have fresh corn I just use a drained can of corn kernels. I also add an aji dulce pepper and use habanero instead of cayenne but the recipe is perfect.

Nice soup. I followed the receipe exactly and it turned out very well. Friends and kid enjoyed. Other reviewers commented on how hard it is to peel the Kobocha squash - I used a shureform and that worked very well. A shureform is a woodworking tool that I use for shaping surfboards normally but find a handy kitchen tool sometimes too. Another nice thing is that most all ingredients can be found in Chinatown cheaply so I will make this again.

This soup is a great combination of flavors. The relish adds a nice touch, however I think that the shallots are overpowering the other flavors. Next time I make this soup I may just leave them out altogether. The only deterrent to make this again is what a pain in the rear it is to peel Kabocha!!!

What a fantastic soup! I was unable to obtain either of these types of squash and used butternut instead. I had tons of extra corn so threw the kernels into the soup as it was cooking and blended them into the soup, which was good. Next time I plan on adding some chicken after blending to make the soup a bit heartier. Totally delicious and I ate almost half of it the first day I made it. Absolutely wonderful.

Not having access to South American produce I used a local pumpkin for this soup. It was sensational, so tasty and the fresh corn garnish was so sweet and such a lovely compliment to the flavours of the soup. Best version of a pumpkin soup I've ever made, and I'm not a real soup lover!

I thought this turned out well. I generally don't like coconut milk, but I used the light milk which cut the calories and provided a nice smooth flavor. I found this recipe when looking for something to make with a Kabocha I had, and I think mine was a little small and definetly not worth the effort... next time I'll use the Calabaza. I also only would have needed 2 ears of corn - I had much more than 2 cups of fresh corn from the three ears.

I just made this soup last night for dinner. It was perfect for a rainy Spring day! I substituted Swanson's 33% less sodium chicken broth for the water, then used less salt.

Absolutely the best squash soup I have ever made! The complexity of flavors is beyond compare to any more mundane squash soup recipe and yet it really was not difficult to make. I was able to find a kabosha squash locally (although I am told acorn squash would also work because it is sweet).
