Not sure what I did wrong.. used calrose rice which is a short grain rice similar to Arborio. It took an hour and a half, and I ended up having to add an additional 6-7 cups of liquid to keep the rice from drying out and staying hard. At the end, it was still a little too al dente. However, the flavour was delicious. I will try with jasmine or basmati as it seems to have worked for others. But I am a bit confused, as to make risotto with arborio rice, you would normally have to add 3-4x the amount of liquid to rice (vs 2x in this recipe).

Very nice. No need to add the lemon or chives; I tossed the rice with leftover lamb (diced, w/ garlic and shallots).

I used oranges instead of lemons which paired well with the saffron.I also added garlic and parsley like one of other raters suggested. Overall it was delicious!I think had I gone strictly by the recipe it may have been too bland because I had to keep adding more and more oranges/herbs

Very disappointed- thoughts flavors did not mesh well at all and were awkward and not very good at all.

I added some sliced carrots from a local farmers market and sliced orange bell peppers. The color was exceptional but...the flavor was too bland...may have been the spanish saffron that I bought from COSTCO. If I made it again I would add garlic.

This is an easy way to make risotto. The only thing I would do is to reduce the lemon juice by about 1/2. 3 Tbsp. was a little too overpowering. I served this with seared scallops with butter tarragon sauce and it was delicious.

I was very nervous making this recipe, but it turned out excellent!! Used medium grain rice and only 1 TBL lemon peel. Will definitely make again!!

This was great although I would use less lemon rind and chop it finely. Also- using wine in place of stock was a great idea although I think i over did it. A little goes a long way!

Chopped lemon rind, that's a pig in a poke. How finely chopped? I used grated rind, less than called for, and it was overpowering. Next time, way less!

Good and very easy recipe. I made this once just as the recipe is written, and liked it but found it a little bland, so the second time I made it with half chicken stock and half white wine as the liquid, and used chopped flat leaf parsley at the end instead of chives, and it had just the tang I wanted. My guests loved it.

This was delicious. I used scallion tops since I didn't have chives. Served with a spicy tomatoe BBQ shrimp & sauce, it was enjoyed by all at our dinner party.

very nice flavor, but let me make a suggestion: if you don't use custard cups to portion out, then double the recipie to serve the same number of people.

So fragrant and pretty. I served this with osso buco and my guests felt spoiled.

I was skeptical of the lemon rind and used half the specified amount, but next time I will do it right. I served this with grilled Greek lamb and it was terrific.

Good Rissoto. I added my liquid a little at a time and found I needed about 1 extra cup to get the rice nice and creamy. Go easy on the Saffron - - just 5-6 strands should do it or else you'll lastic/inky off notes. The lemon was nice....I didn't have shallots so used medium carmelized onion and added some dried Tarrgon instead of the Shallots.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times, with salmon, with chicken -- I think it would pair with anything. It is easy, delicious, and presents beautifully. The whole house smells good and when guests arrive, they are transported before they even take a bite!

This risotto is exceptional; always a pleaser! Every time that I make it for guests, I receive loads of compliments. Do not overcook, rice will become gummy. It is best served a bit al dente, moist and creamy.

This was a wonderful and simple recipe. Also, I was able to adapt it to my rice cooker. Cook the saffron and shallots (I used yellow onion) in a pan as directed, add your rice to coat and then transfer it all to your rice cooker. Finish recipe as directed. It was all so easy.

This was quite nice and beautiful to look at! I served it with a roasted pork loin and steamed green peas. Will definitely do again!

A very unique and delicious rice dish. I would make this again.

The color, smell, and taste of this recipe makes it a great side dish. The lemon flavor makes it a even better dish with seafood. Serve sauted scallops or shrimp on a bed of this rice, with a glass of white wine. Simple and great for entertainment

This was a delicious side to honey mustard glazed salmon. Though I did used basmati rice instead, didn't have the other. Kitchen smelled wonderful while cooking too!!

Outstanding!! Use extra saffron! The idea to use the molds was great!

Excellent rice dish. Made it with Basmati Rice and it turned out wonderfully. Would disagree with other viewers who said the lemon flavor was too predominate.....it is that flavor that makes this dish, in my opinion.

Kitchen smelled great as rice was cooking. I'd definitely cut down on the lemon juice though -- a bit sour, overpowered the delicate saffron. I'll try 2 tbsp lemon juice, and maybe cut down on the lemon peel also.

Fabulous rice recipe. The lemon flavor was perfect, as in the recipe. I'm not a fan or short-grain rice and will make it with a Jasmati or Basmati next time. Looks beautiful on the plate, adding beautiful color. I packed the rice into 1/3 cup custard dished and then turned it over onto the plate. It looks so much better this way. Next time I'd also be more generous with the saffron. Amount of shallots was perfect, too. I'd highly recommend it.

I used jamine rice instead of the arborio and it was excellent. I will definitely make it again - and I do not agree that the lemon peel was too strong. The flavor was great.

The rice came out wonderfully, but I should have taken others' advice and cut the amount of lemon peel. It was a bit overwhelming, even served with fish in a very flavor-rich sauce.

This was wonderful. I made this as a side dish with pork loin. Every last bit was eaten, no leftovers. Everyone loved it, some said it was the rice dish they ever ate. I will definitely make it again.

I made this rice as a side dish to salmon, it was delicious! I also used lemon zest and halved what the recipe called for. I included a very generous pinch of saffron and used 2 shallots. It was unique enough to impress my guests, but not overbearing. I bought the saffron in the ethnic foods isle of the supermarket and found that the spanish version is MUCH less expensive than regular saffron and worked wonderfully.

Easy and delicious. I also decreased the lemon zest by 1/2 and used a very generous pinch of saffron. Really nice color and flavor.

I made a number of substitutions--using jasmine rice instead of arborio, adding about a cup of fresh peas to the rice before cooking it, cutting the butter in half, and adding a dash of paprika for color since I didn't have any saffron. The rice was exceptionally creamy and I would definitely make it again.

Yes this is deelish. Easy to prepare and with simple ingredients.

I thought this was an excellent side dish. I also used lemon zest and only one tablespoon--the result was delicious! The ratio of rice to chicken broth makes this recipe easy to double or cut in half.

Rating: 3
Easy and tasty--just the way I like it. However, the recipe calls for lemon "peel", not zest, maybe I was stupid for strictly construing the term, but I would definitely use zest next time.

Better than I expected! Easy to prepare, the saffron was a little expensive but worth the cost! The color is beautiful and presented well. Paired well nicely the fish that it accompanied too. I would probably decrease the amount of lemon zest as the taste was a little strong; would have preferred to savor more of the saffron flavor. A definite repeat!

I absolutely loved this recipe! Quick and easy to make and the flavor was incredible.
