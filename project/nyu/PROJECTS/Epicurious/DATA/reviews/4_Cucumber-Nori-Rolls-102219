this is one of a few sushi recipes I have tried, and I have this method for making the rice beats any other I've come across. The rolls came out very well, although I like a little something more interesting than plain old cucumber in the middle of them (avocado, prawn, red pepper...). The only reason this doesnt get 4 forks is the sushi zu. I prefer the recipe I got from Sushi Day - theres a little more salt to it and theres more of the stuff for this amount of rice. apart from that, this recipe is so good just thinking about it has me drooling.

I actually tried this before finding the recipe and had some problems...I didn't use half a sheet I used a whole sheet and it didn't work too well. but besides that I added tuna (i got it fresh then froze it solid then defrosted it right before i used it) advocado, carrots, and green onion...yum yum...as to the question about wasabi...if you put one tablespoon per roll, you will have some HOT HOT sushi!

I've made this reciepe twice for dinner parties and it was excellent both times. It is definately a process, but worth the work. It tastes just like the rolls at my favorite restaurant. I also added avacodos and carrots to it and it turned out great!

I believe this recipe says 1 tblspoon for all 12 rolls. I would use more, since I like my wasabi. It all depends on whether you want to clear your sinuses or just add a little kick. Just remember that it's always better to add too little than too much--you can add wasabi to your soy sauce later if there isn't enough in the rolls.

I am making this for the first time today and I have a question.Is the 1 tablespoon wasabi for all 12 rolls or is it 1 tablespoon per roll? HELP! Please contact me ASAP. bridget@montrose.net

Absolutely fantastic! The rice was perfect. I also included finely shredded green cabbage and carrots. My husband and I couldn't believe how perfectly they turned out the very first time we made them. Our dinner guests were completely amazed we hadn't bought them at a Japanese Sushi house. I will definitely make this again and again!

This was my first time making sushi and it came out great! The trick to sushi's wonderful flavor is the correct preparation of the rice. Using this recipe, the rice turned out fragrant and tasty, and had a great consistency. Because I made this for a party, I made the rolls with wasabi and pickled ginger already in the center, so people could just pick up the pieces, dip them in gyoza sauce, and pop it in their mouth for full flavor! What a hit. I'm actually making it again today.
