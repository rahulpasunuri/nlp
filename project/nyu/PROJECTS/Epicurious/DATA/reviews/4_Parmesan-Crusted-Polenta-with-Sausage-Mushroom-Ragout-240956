Absolutely delicious! Usually make my own sauce; however, have used Newman's Marinara and it turned out just as tasty. Cremini mushrooms are a good alternative to mixture of wild.

Great quick and easy meal! I too got eight polenta slices out of the tube- four would've been crazy!!! So delicious served this after a spring vegetable (fava bean, asparagus, green bean, leek, carrot) soup. Yum!!!

This has everything going for it. It was quick and easy to make. I don't usually like tomato-based sauces but I have made an exception in this case. I used dried morel mushrooms (reconstituted). It was wonderful.

Love this recipe! It's quick and delicious. I serve this sauce with pasta too.

As did other reviewers, I made my own sauce and used housemade sun dried tomato sausage from the local butcher. Delicious. The leftovers 2 days later were even better, served with pasta rather than polenta. Over pasta, I'd give it 4 forks.

This was super simple. But I'm surprised that no one mentioned that it serves closer to 6 or 7 than 4. When I sliced the polenta tube into four rounds they wer so thick that I ended up slicing them into 8. I took the advice and added onions and it was fantastic! I think you could use Boca veggie saussage to and make it for non meat eaters. I didn't use the jarred sauce but took tomato sauce and doctored it up with herbs and 2 garlic cloves. It was wonderful! I served it with a Caesar salad and it was a great dinner!

This is terriffic, and takes no time at all. I made it for a last minute get together with friends, and it was a huge success in just a little time! I would definitely suggest using spicy/ hot italian sausage instead of the sweet, and the polenta a little thicker (and more of it). Served with a spring mix inspired salad. My boyfriend is still raving about it!

I was unwilling to pour a half cup of the good red wine we were drinking into this recipe, so I used 1/3c wine and some sherry to deglaze the sausage-skillet with. Coupled with fresh thyme, the combination of flavours was wonderful. Like others, I was wary of using polenta from a tube, but baked and crusted with Romano, the disks browned, had a good texture (soft on the inside, crunchy outside) and complimented the sauce nicely.

EXCELLENT. I was a little scared to use polenta in a tube, rather than the homemade stuff, but it turned out great. Easy, fast, delishious - perfect weeknight meal! In the future I will not crust my polenta disks with parm - it would have been better without it.

This was fabulous. One note: perhaps I'm the only idiot who needs clarity; drain the sausage before adding to the ragout. Otherwise it was a bit greasy.

Rating: 4
Excellent. However, I did make my own sauce and poenta from scratch (both my husband and I come from Italian families and are very picky...) Next time I will try the "Creamy Polenta" that takes no stirring to make it more of a weeknight meal...

Superb weeknight recipe. I sauteed the polenta patties instead of broiling them, and they came out great. I'm sure the wine isn't necessary, but it's a nice touch.

Great! I did make my own sauce and polenta. It turned out excellent. Husband has already asked for me to make it again.

This was so amazing and easy. I've never actually cooked with wine before but it added such an amazing depth to the sauce. I strongly recommend this.

Delicious and so easy! I omitted the wine and threw some chopped spinach into the ragout to sneak some leafy greens in and the kids loved it!

From a formerly mushroom-phobic novice cook, this recipe was totally delicious, totally simple, and impossible to mess up. I was excited and prepared to divide the recipe, as my boyfriend is not a vegetarian and I am, but I discovered that the Italian sausage I had purchased a few days ago had already gone bad. My naivete regarding meat fully exposed, I trudged forward. The meal was so delicious even without the sausage, though I am excited to include it for next time. I really recommend this dish for its flavor, depth, and simplicity.

I love this recipe; tastes like something that took more time. I've made it with turkey sausage to make it a bit more healthy and it's still great.

Loved it! It's all about the sausage. I bought mine fresh at a tiny Italian market.

Will absolutely make this again! The polenta was delicious broiled and the sauce tasted like it had been cooking all day. I would even serve it over pasta if I were cooking for someone who didn't like polenta. After reading the reviews on here, I doubled the mushrooms, but I think I will use even more next time.

I agree with some other reviewers -- if you want to make this special you have to make your own polenta and sauce. The dish is only as good as the ingredients you use. If you like your sauce and polenta, its a keeper.

One additional thought - I used very high quality prepared marinara (Lucini brand) and I think it made a big difference in the quality of the finished dish.

Totally agree with all the reviewers who rate this a winner for "quick and easy." I used turkey italian sausage, increased the mushrooms, and added a pinch of red pepper flakes. It came out great. Will definitely make this again!

If you are looking for something quick and easy, this recipe is a winner. Because it was so simple and used some prepared ingredients I didn't have high expectations, but my husband and I kept saying "wow" with each bite. I used ground sweet Italian sausage and marinara sauce made with San Marzano Italian tomotoes.

Although I probably wouldn't serve this at a dinner party, I will definitely be making this recipe for my family again. It might have a big wow factor but for a quick and very yummy weekday dinner it's hard to beat. I used a nice French Shiraz, some high quality tomato-basil flavoured sausages and half a jar of gourmet spaghetti sauce. My finicky 3 year old asked for thirds and so did my husband. It's hard to find recipes that will please both of them so this one is definitely a keeper for me!

Went right by the recipe using quality ingredients. We ate some of it and threw the rest away. I don't get the rave reviews on this one - am I missing something? I know one thing: I'm not going by the reviews anymore when I cook!

Just don't get it. How could it be rated so high? Tubed polenta and bottled sauce...good sausage or not, that's what you end up with...as you should based on the recipe. Guess I thought something "magical" would happen based on the reviews. There are PLENTY of recipes that are also easy and not so "pedestrian" tasting.

This recipe is awesome. I couldn't find the roll of polenta at my grocery store so, i used the instant, then rolled it in foil-tube, chilled for about 30 min, then sliced. this worked fine. My sig. other is VERY picky and he loved this dish. Big Hit.

I couldn't find a 2-pound tube of polenta, so I ended up getting 2 one-pound tubes and slicing each into 8 rounds. Worked great. This is my new favorite recipe -- made it several times, always to rave reveiws.

Great and easy for a weeknight; perfect for my carnivore husband. He doesn't like polenta so I served his portion over pasta, which was also a success.

I added chopped onions with the mushrooms and it ended up tasting great. I didn't have wine on hand so substituted chicken broth. A very filling dish I will definitely make again.

Great! Easy to prepare and yet get a gourmet taste. I used polenta flavored with basil and sun-dried tomatoes and substituted habenero chicken sausged (diced). Not one bit of this was left. I will make this again and again.

I made my own polenta because I didn't have the tube kind on hand. I added about 1/2 of a cup of romano cheese to the polenta after cooking it on the stove. I spread it on a 13x9 inch pan and put in the refrigerator to firm up. My husband and our guests enjoyed this recipe, and they stated it was a keeper and a winner. I also made my own marinara sauce. This was delicious, and I definitely would make again.

This dish was very simple and yet tasted as though I'd been simmering the sauce for hours! I used turkey sausage, portabello and button mushroooms, and $2 chuck and it turned out very well. Presentation was nice as well!

I opted to make my own polenta and it was superb with the ragout. I'm passing this on to all my friends..five stars..

Easy and tasty. I agree with the reviewer who suggested doubling the mushrooms and halving the sausage. I also did not find the polenta in a tube and used instant. Instead of circles, I pressed the polenta into a pie plate, topped with parmesan and broiled until browned. I just cut it into wedges and it was great.

Just made this recipe and it will now be a staple (good sub for pasta night). The only thing I would do next time is place the mushrooms in the salad spinner to drain all excess water or spoon out the excess water after simmering the mushroom before adding the wine. In the end, my sauce was very watery but still had flavor. I used oyster mushrooms and it was yummy. Browning the polenta to the point of crunchy edges was key!

Quick, easy, and very very good. We used turkey sausage (hot) an Trader Joe's polenta in a tube. We also served with aspargus.

Pretty easy and tasty as well. I added red pepper flakes for more of a kick. I used chicken sausage which ended up being a little dry, as chicken tends to do, but overall it was delicious.

I wasn't altogethor fond of the polenta-in-a-tube, it just had an odd taste. Next time i'll use real polenta. But the ragout was good.

Tried this tonight. It was great! A fairly simple comfort food. I did not do the cooking- just reaped the benefits, but the prep and actual cooking was easy and the final product- looked as good as it tasted. (Thanks Andrea!) This will definately goin my recipe box. I would only add some crushed red pepper for a spicy kick.

This is really yummy and much less intimidating than doing everything from scratch, not to mention a lot faster! If you're not using very finely grated parmesan, use at least half a cup. Also, I recommend punching it up a bit with a bottled sauce that's a bit more than just tomato sauce--I used sausage mushroom pasta sauce just to really make it oozing with goodness.

I made this a couple of nights ago. I wasn't able to find the polenta this called for, but found instant instead. I used cookie cutters to form the polenta into a round, removed the mold and baked as directed. This was delicious, comforting and very easy. We paired it with a good red wine, which I also used in the recipe. The other great thing about this recipe is that it's a really decent portion size, just enough. If you're looking for something comforting and delicious this is it.

This is sooo easy, but it turns out really tasty. I actually think you could get away with serving this to company and they'd think you'd slaved over it. I subbed spicy chicken italian sausage from Trader Joe's and threw in a few handfuls of swiss chard when sauteeing the mushrooms. Delish!

Just did 1/2 recipe; used wild asian type 'shrooms from local Costco and added reconstituted porcini. Probably not best use of those type of mushrooms, but they held their own against the marinara. Don't get that much cool weather here in Honolulu, but nice to have something different to make when it is!

ridiculously easy and quick to make...perfect for colder nights, too. This will become a regular entree in my house.
