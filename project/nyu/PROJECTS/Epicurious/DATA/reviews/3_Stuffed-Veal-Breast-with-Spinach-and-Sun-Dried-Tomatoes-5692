This was absolutely yummy! It was my first time cooking breast of veal. The supermarket had it on sale, so I cut it up myself and pounded out a flat piece for the wrapper, then ground my own veal from the trimmings for the stuffing. I followed the recipe exactly as written and my husband and I found it really delicious.

I used the breast of veal with the pocket and the bones. I sauted the gound veal, the sun dried tomatoes and the spinach first.Let them cool slightly and added the eggs. After stuffing the breast of veal I sauted it in a very large electric skillet for about 10 minutes. I removed it and added the salary onions and carrot, sautued then for about 5 minutes, then added the wine and the stock. I continued cooking it on the electric skillet for a couple or hours, until it was very very tender. I served with polenta. It turned out oustanding. I will make this again and again

Closest I could find to another recipe I used to use. Substituted veal breast with pocket, and ground pork and beef for the ground veal. Smells good as it's roasting.

I used a whole, butterflied scallopini which worked well - but if using this cut,either reduce oven temperature 50 degrees or cook about 30 minutes less. The stuffing was excellent and this dish makes a beautiful presentation. Next time I will reduce pan juices and thicken with a butter/flour paste. Overall winner!

i thought this dish was superb- it was a lot of work, but well worth it- i let it cook longer because the more you let a veal roast, breast cook it is more tender and falls off with a touch of a fork. it is good to see that veal is making a come back. it is the most versitle meat there is.

It is delicious, but a lot of work. I bought the breast, then found the recipe. Used the bones, roasted, to make the stock. It didn't need the ground veal, too much bulk, I omitted it. Used dry French bread crumbs instead of fresh; it made a great stuffing. I will use it for Chicken breasts in the future. Served Besmahti Rice with it. I felt that the onions, celery and carrots (mirapoix) were necessary for the intense, rich flavor that compliments the veal so well.

I scaled the recipe down a bit and used chicken breasts in place of veal and turkey sausage in place of ground veal. It was really fabulous. The only thing I would do different is to maybe skip the vegetable part. I didn't care for the carrots and celery too much with this dish. I think I would still include the onions and garlic while cooking but strain the sauce and not serve them with the dish.
