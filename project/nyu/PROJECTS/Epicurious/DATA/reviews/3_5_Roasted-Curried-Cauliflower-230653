Nice side dish. Easy and good

I 1/2ed the recipe and tossed the spice vinaigrette in a big bowl with the veggies before adding to the pan. I used smoked paprika instead of hot, and some spanish chorizo for protein and served over rice and it was quite good. Garnished w/ yellow raisins instead of cilantro (which I didn't have, but would use next time). Def use the raisins - they add sweetness - very nice w/ a fruity white wine (we had a Tournaine).

This dish was quite nice. We had it as a main course for the two of us. I cut the portions in half and we have leftovers. I followed some of the other suggestions and added more onion,celery,carrot as well as the garbanzo beans which were a nice addition. Be careful of the salt, even halfed, I thought that it was almost too much. Really good, try it!

mgwynnjones, I wish you had trusted your instincts and not made this dish, since you clearly don't like the strong flavors it contains. But why did you have to be so disrespectful of the vast majority of cooks who quite rightly rave about this dish--by impugning our judgment with that snarky line about this being a perfect dish for people who don't like cauliflower? I do, and so do millions of Indians who enjoy theirs with similar seasonings.

This was excellent. I estimated the spice amounts (the recipe is forgiving) and used ground coriander instead of seeds. I added about 5 tablespoons of black mustard seed as well which I toasted and ground in the mortar. I threw in a large handful of dried cherries as well after I pulled it out of the oven and it works quite well.

I really enjoyed this recipe tonight.When I say recipe, I mean the mixture of spices, oil, and vinegar. For my husband and I, I had a small amount of cauliflower and, having read many of the reviews and a number of related recipes, I augmented it with chunks of sweet potato(yams), carrots, red pepper, and of course, onions. I had about 5 cups of vegetables (used a generous amount of onion) and used 1/3 of the recipe for olive oil, vinegar and spices, as in the recipe (exactly). I baked it for 35 minutes at 450 degrees F. (Vegetable pieces were about 1 1/2 inches square.) It really was delicious.

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe as written except for a variation in the cooking time/temp as I had something else in the oven at the same time. I found the flavors interesting. I would say the dish as a whole was good, but not great. Well, the onions were great, the cauliflower was just good. I'll keep looking for a curried cauliflower recipe.

I don't understand the excitement. This is a relatively simplistic and uninspired recipe.

We're not big cauliflower fans (buy it, rarely, because it's in season and looks so pretty), but this recipe is cauliflower's raison d'être. Made it once and within a week was begged to make it again (it's roasting away as I write this). I cut back the oil and vinegar by about 1/3 and more or less doubled the cumin and coriander. Roasted at 400 degrees, and then 45 minutes is perfect. We'll be eating this often, and enjoying cauliflower (a new experience in this house)!

Loved this recipe! I made it twice in one week. I reduced the vinegar - the brightness is needed but I found the original amount to be overwhelming. I posted a step-by-step photo of the recipe here... http://ceramiccanvas.com/2011/11/roasted-curried-cauliflower/

Wow, this is great! I had to reduce proportions because I only had two smallish heads of cauliflower. But my husband and I ate all of it before it made it to the table and now I wish I had 12 c. If anything I would increase the onions because they're delicious when they get caramelized or crispy -- we ended up with some of both.

I made this substituting ground coriander since I didn't have the seeds. This was the best way I've ever had cauliflower, I could't stop eating it. Easy, unusual, good for you, a real keeper.

Try with ghee instead of olive oil. (microwave ghee for 40 sec. to liquify). Ghee has higher smoke point than olive oil, and very nice flavor. Also cayenne instead of paprika is good - spicey, and apple cider vinegar works too.

This is a fantastic side dish that goes with so many different entrees. I can't wait to make it with shrimp. I used a lot of suggestions found in the reviews and comments (doubled spices, added sweet potato and red pepper, reduced vinegar, used a fig infused balsamic that was delicious). I tried to scrimp on the olive oil (used only 2 T) which caused the vinaigrette to be too thick at first, but I added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth which kept the vegetables moist and it turned out really well. Thanks to everyone's excellent suggestions as usual.

I probably reviewed this a long time ago, but just had to review it again. I love this recipe. Sometimes I add red potatoes cubed very small and at the end of roasting I add frozen peas. I don't use all of the olive oil, just enough to coat the vegetables that are to be roasted. I make this every time I make Indian food.

Rating: 3
This was really good and that is saying something as I am generally not a fan of cauliflower. Made it as written, except I only roasted it for 20 minutes -- 35 mins would have been way too long at 450 degrees. (I did make the florets fairly small).

This is fantastic! I loved it! I used one of those "Good Seasonings" salad dressing carafes to shake up the dressing. I think this dish would also be good if you mixed in a few potatoes.

Excellent, not too "Indian", can be served as a side with any cuisine. I made the dressing in a bottle and really shook it up so it emulsified and I think that helped keep it from being oily. Made it by the recipe with only added a few garlic cloves, and it was wonderful.

Wonderful, subtle flavors. Great side dish.

I almost didn't try this because the ingredients were so peculiar - I am SO glad I did, it is wonderful. I only had ground coriander and ground cumin so i used half of the amount called for and simply toasted them anyhow. It worked really well. Only thing is I think the cauliflower would have been way overcooked at 45 minutes, and the ground spices didn't take as long to turn color. But this is another favorite, for sure.

this is good as written although i think you need a good quality vineger - however, i found it unpleasantly charred at 450* and would do it next time at 350* instead.

A truly delicious and simple recipe. Add-in friendly (my favorites: a dozen or so whole garlic cloves and dried cranberries) but a fantastic way to make cauliflower the star. As for the oil debate: don't skimp! The rich vinegarette coating is the key to keeping the cauliflower moist while roasting. I served it with coconut rice on a cold winter day. Mm!

I have made this dish a couple of times a month since my daughter started a vegetarian diet, 3 years ago. We love it as written, though I usually cut the olive oil back by 1/4 cup or so. Don't mess with the spices, they are wonderful, and for God's sake don't substitute broccoli for cauliflower!! It's fabulous over brown rice.

Made the recipe as directed with the addition of two small zuchini--excellent. Even our somewhat 'selective' eater loved the cauliflower. Also prepared kafta and samosas (2004 epicurious recipe) for a great dinner.

This was the best!! I didn't have the coriander seeds, nor the cilantro as called for in the recipe. I did substitute cumin powder for the seeds and added 1 tsp of cayenne red pepper (I love spice!)instead of Hot Paprika.

Very good. I doubled the sauce and had enough for three heads of cauliflower. Used only half a cup of oil, but I think I could have omitted it altogether and used Pam, as one reviewer suggested. Nice curry flavor and a creative side dish.

Rating: 0
I'm sorry, I thought this was awful. I followed the recipe, except for cutting everything in half (I had only one head of cauliflower.) I've roasted a lot of vegetables in my time, and none came out charred and burnt like these. Perhaps I shouldn't have halved the oil, but we're still talking something like 6 TBS of oil, which should have been plenty.

Rating: 3
I've done this as given (well, I'm too lazy to toast and grind spices on a weeknight...) and also adding carrots, sweet potato, some raisins. Have reduced fat once. All ways, a real winner, with pretty much the results you'd expect from each adjustment. Roast a chicken at the same time, toast some pita triangles in your heated oven at the end, and you've got a super-simple, energy-efficient, vaguely ethnic dinner with loads of flavor. And great leftovers, should you have any!

Rating: 4
This recipe is fabulous. Kept it entirely as-is, except adding in a can or two of cooked chickpeas, to add protein and make it a complete meal. In terms of cooking time, we followed the recipe, and loved the results. The cauliflower was moist on the inside with a hint of crunch, the onions carmelized, and the chickpeas, while perhaps a bit dry for some, gave a surprisingly welcome crunch. Could make again, eat again EVERY DAY.

I reduced the volume of red wine vinegar and olive oil as previous posters. Good cold as well as warm.

Rating: 4
I followed the advice of the cook from Saranac Lake, NY (reductions of 1/3 cup red wine vinegar and 1/2 cup oil), and that made the recipe exceptional. I was surprised by the idea of red wine vinegar in a curry, but it totally made this recipe. I found the cooking time to be perfect--only the tips of a few pieces were slightly charred, and it wasn't in a bad way. This is hands down the most delicious veggie curry I've ever eaten.

Rating: 4
This is a really delicious way to get your veggies. I wanted to make this lower in fat, so I omitted the olive oil and instead used an olive oil spray (similar to Pam). I sprayed the veggies, tossed them, then added the rest of the dressing and tossed them again. The roasting time was much shorter for me than in the recipe -- just 20 minutes. Both my husband and I loved this dish.

I used ground coriander seeds and ground cumin without browning 1st. Equal amounts of cauliflower and new potatoes quartered. Only problem was that there was uneven browning/crisping of the veggies. Think I should have flipped them during baking.

This was tasty and easy but not a "wow" dish. I did reduce the red wine vinegar at the suggestion of prior reviewers, and added garlic to the liquid.

This was by far the best curry I've made at home. I followed the advice of commenters and used less vinegar - I shouldn't have. It was delicious, but could have used a bit more bite. I also used potato and cauliflower, instead of cauliflower alone. The potato soaked up the curry mixture and was delicious. I'll make it again with the full vinegar amount.

Quite exciting and tasty with a nice balance of flavors. In addition to cauliflower and onions, I used aspargus, zuchini, wax beans and the last of my broccoli. I took the aspargus out early.

We usually prefer to roast our cauliflower, and were looking for a recipe that could add some pizzaz to an otherwise plain meal. And I looove curry. So we did like this recipe, but not quite 3 forks worth. We will probably make again, but this will not be the only recipe in my cauliflower repertoire. Actually, I would have liked it hotter/spicier (but I did use regular paprika, not Hungarian so maybe that made the difference?).

I made this dish last night to accompany some store bought marinated Masala chicken. This dish is outstanding!

This is the best cauliflower I've had (other than just breading and frying the stuff, yum). I dislike red wine vinegar so when I doubled the recipe I only increased the red wine vinegar 1/4 cup. I still think I could have used less vinegar but it was palatable this way. Everyone really enjoyed it. It is best eaten when warm, out of the oven.

I made this the first time as an experiment--used both heads and ended up eating the entire recipe for dinner! Could not stop. I tried to cut back on the oil, but found it didn't cover enough of the veggies that way--so while it sounds like a lot, you shouldn't skimp. Also, I cut the onions much smaller than indicated (I was using a very large onion, and quarters were ungainly). I've made this three times: the first time I bought parsley instead of cilantro my mistake, the second time I used cilantro, and the third time I was out of herbs altogether--it always tastes great, nonetheless.

I'll admit, I don't love cauliflower. It's one of those ought-to-eat vegetables. This recipe, however, is great. I made a few mods... Didn't have enough red wine vinegar so I substituted balsamic. Didn't have the seeds, so I substituted powders. Forgot the cilantro at the end, and I don't think it made THAT much difference. It was still great! I served it with Moroccan-style cornish game hens, fresh green beans and rice and it was a great supper. Would definitely make this again. I served it warmish, but picked at it before serving while it was still very warm. I preferred it very warm to room temp. Other than that, it's definitely a keeper.
