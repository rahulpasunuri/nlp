I've made this twice now and it's an excellent recipe. I used about twice as much water and simmered the bouquet garni considerably longer to reduce the "stock" and get the maximum from the herbs. The amount of water called for in the recipe is rather low, in my opinion, though I confess adding more makes it more of a soup than it already is. It is, however, easier to poach the eggs with more water. Agreed that chicken broth would be a good substitution for part of the water. I used a little more bread to compensate, in part. I also found that a fair amount of salt is required in this (perhaps also partly due to my addition of water but not solely so)

Wonderfully quick, easy meal to throw together made from common pantry ingredients. Richer flavour by substituting homemade chicken stock. Sunny, fresh taste in the middle of a cold and blustery winter.

This is a filling and comforting meal; it is also pretty easy to make. However, I think the flavors are not very complex and it seems to fit more into the "comfort food" category than the "gourmet" category. I suppose our tastes have changed a lot since 1967.
