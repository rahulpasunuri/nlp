I thought the recipe was very good. Ensure that you are using a good quality basalmic and wine to prevent the overly vinegary or overly sweet tastes that some reviewers complained about. I deconstructed in the recipe a bit by making a compound butter with minced shallots, fresh Italian parsley and some fresh lemon to top the filet. The sauce was simply a reduction of the wine and balsamic. I also charred the onions and cooked them down a bit.

Very tasty. I thought the reduction was slightly too vinegar-y, so next time I will add maybe 3/4 c. of balsamic instead of a full cup. Otherwise this is simple and delicious.

Key: If you like sweet sauces with your filet, then this one is fine. But, if like me, sweet isn't so much your bag, there are other wine reduction sauces on this site that are much better. I was warned by one reviewer, so I did only 3/4 cup of balsamic and 1/4 of beef broth, and it was still too sweet. Definitely go with 1/2 cup each, even if you LIKE sweet. Otherwise, recipe is fine.

Our rating is just for the sauce; we served it alongside individual beef wellingtons. The sauce was fab.

The sauce was too sweet; I did use a cab. The onions needed to be cooked longer and I should have cut the zucchini on the diagonal rather than straight cut as the recipe indicated. The directions for the fillet were perfect.

One word....YUM! Although my house did fill up with smoke from charring the veggies, next time I will lower the temp when cooking. The sauce was phenominal, and overall pretty easy. My guests raved.

Some folks went wild for the balsamic sauce. The kids found it to be a bit much; served it on the side. Overall, good but not great. Easy, however.

I made this for 2 and halved the sauce recipe and it was great. We ended up grilling the steaks but pan searing the veggies- fantastic.

This is an awesome recipe! It works exactly as it is written. I did use sirloin steaks instead of filets due to the price, and gave them slightly longer time to get to medium rare. The combination of flavors is exceptional. The sauce is definitely prize-winning. You can't go wrong with this one.

I ended up going back and forth between the 2 and 3 forks, because it's a great weeknight dinner, and I loved the vegetables and beef, loved the relatively low fat / high protein / high vegetable content, and like the sauce initially. It's just that the acid from the balsamic vinegar got overwhelming. I think next time I might halve the vinegar and subsitute broth for the other half to calm the acid a bit. Will definitely make it again, though.

Early in the morning I purchased a beef tenderloin to make into Beef Wellington. Then spent the whole afternoon in the garden rather than making Puff Pastry. Pulled this recipe out of my epi recipe file as a panic-solver. Had beef, had guests coming, had no dinner. Wow! The sauce is easy to make and beyond belief delicious. Presentation is easy, but looks like you took an hour. We used to make Beef Wellington as our "signature dish" for small dinner parties. Now I will use this. The recipe is a bit pedantic -- 1 cup plus 2 tbsp Red Wine -- oh, come on! Throw a cup and a bit of Pinot Noir in -- but measure the balsamic! Pinot Evil -- a boxed wine -- works really well and you can drink it too! Fast, easy, delicious. What more can you ask? We have now served this three times -- each time to raves.

Amazing recipe. Unbelievably flavorful and presentation is beautiful. Can't wait to serve this to guests! Definitely a keeper.

This dish is quick and easy to prepare, but delicious. The balsamic vinegar sauce is rich and sophisticated - tastes like something drizzled on a dish at a 5 star restaurant.

The sauce is very flavorful and the charred effect on the vegetables adds both visual appeal and flavour. Do stack everything as directed - it makes for a nice presentation. Variation: We cooked the filets on the grill, to no detriment. Next time, I'm going to add mushrooms to the zucchini for more vegetables.

One bite and we knew this was going into the "keeper" file. Aaagh, the flavor! The sauce, although quite simple, tasted as if it had been intensely labored over.And the accompanying vegetables were ideal--I would not add or replace anything.I second the suggestion that this dish be plated exactly as recommended. It was like dining at a five star restaurant until I remembered I had to clean the dishes.

I could DRINK this sauce, wow is it good. I'm going to make it again this weekend and think I might put a squeeze of lemon in it. I'm also going to try it on chocolate brownies and ice cream.

Very good. The sauce was delicious. I cooked it a little longer than prescribed, but good quality steak made each rare bite tasty.

This is a fabulous dish, especially should you plate, just as suggested. Use only these items of the recipe and drizzle the balsamic sauce around the plate and your guests will think you are a 5 star chef. The filet did need to be seared longer, even for rare lovers. It went into my keeper file!
