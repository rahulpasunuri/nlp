I really like these. I agree that the vanilla bean is expensive but it really isn't all that much more work. These cookies make my apartment smell sooooo good (they taste great, too!) Perhaps not an every day cookie, though I've made them twice in the past two months so apparently they're worth it.

Delicious and easy recipe. I didn't have the white chocolate either, so just doubled the ghirardelli chips, and just used vanilla extract. The cherries keep these cookies at that perfect consistency, soft and crispy. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Sooooo disappointed! These sound wonderful and i have held on to this recipe till I had the time to invest in them. Today was the day, and they are truly just okay as far as my husband and I are concerned. The ingredients are quite expensive, the time invested with scraping the vanilla bean and soaking the cherries, etc., is more than the usual cookie...and they just are not that great. When baking cookies, I will choose other recipes--just too many good ones to waste the time, $$, and effort on these.

I really liked this cookie. It was a nice addition to the holiday cookie tray, but I think I'll make these throughout the year. I substituted good vanilla extract for the vanilla bean, and I can only guess that using the bean would make them even better.

Delicious cookie! I eliminated the nuts b/c of allergies and used 1 tsp of vanilla extract instead of the vanilla bean. i didn't have white chocolate chips so i chopped up a white chocolate bar. I will definitely make these again. Easy and delicious!

DELICIOUS. I made as directed except instead of investing in the vanilla bean, I used about two and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract. When you add the cherries, (wal)nuts, and chocolate chips, it seems as if there is an impossible amount of stuff in the cookies, and not enough dough... it's not true, so don't freak out when that happens. Allowing them to firm up for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet outside of the oven also seems essential to ensuring the cookie is thoroughly baked without letting it to get crispy. These will probably become a year-round standby if I need to impress others. The cost of the ingredients can add up for just everyday cookies.

Delicious. Added vanilla and almond extract. While I had a vanilla bean, maybe it had dried out as slicing into them did not reveal beans that could be removed.

A nice holiday cookie that plumped up nicely. I didn't use the actual vanilla bean but substituted premium vanilla. I think using the bean itself would have given these cookies a more distinct flavor and will not stray from the recipe next time. Overall, the tartness of the cherry gives a different spin on standard chocolate chip cookies. Quite tasty!

A fantastic grown up chocolate chip cookie. Truly worth the effort of making them.

Our new favorite cookie. I used pure vanilla extract instead of vanilla bean and added 1/2 tsp almond extract. I view the nuts as optional, use them or not according to your preferences. I used part semi-sweet and part dark chocolate (Callebaut callets) and the cookies came out excellent!

This really is a yummy addition to the hard to improve chocolate chip cookie. Delicious. I used a tsp of vanilla instead of the expensive bean.

These were really good, but I made a few modifications. I don't care for hazelnuts so I opted for macadamia nuts. Used mini semi sweet chocolate chips instead of regular and cherry flavored Craisins. Baked for 11 minutes and they were yummy. Will definitely make again.

These were delicious. They have just the right balance between butter and flour to produce moist cookies with crisp bottoms and delicious ingredients. I threw in 1/4 t of vanilla in addition to using the bean as directed. These will become a standby for me!

These cookies are delicious! I baked them once following the recipe, exactly; then baked them again for a cookie exchange, substituting gluten- free flour and guar gum for the all- purpose flour. Both batches were crowd pleasers. This is a definite go-to recipe for a quick and yummy cookie.

Loved these, but since I am not much for white chocolate, I subbed bittersweet chips for them. To me, cherries and darker chocolate are a marriage made in Heaven!
