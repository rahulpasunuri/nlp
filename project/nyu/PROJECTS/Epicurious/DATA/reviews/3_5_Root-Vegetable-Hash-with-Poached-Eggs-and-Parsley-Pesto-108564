My husband and I made this for a friend for brunch and it was lovely! My husband has his own method for making poached eggs that seems a little more reliable (uses vinegar?), so I can't speak to the method written about here. We also served lemon ricotta pancakes with a homemade blackberry syrup, which complimented nicely.

I like all the ingredients so I thought it was good. The flavor wasn't all that exciting though - very plain. Pesto was a kind of interesting addition to ingredients I don't usually put with pesto. A lot of time/work for nothing special. I liked it, but probably won't make it again.

tasted like a low-fat version of a better recipe

Fantastic dish!!! The vegis really cook down, so don't skimp. I used store-bought pesto and it was amazing, I can only imagine how delicious it would have been from scratch. Really really simple, easy, and super flavorful and complex-tasting.

Delicious - simple, easy and tasty. Satisfied the vegetarians and omnivores among us - the pesto is an excellent touch.

This was really good. Yes, it does take lots of "dicing" of the veggies but they make a wonderful combination. I thought there would be heaps of hash, but it does lose volume as it roasts. My pesto was not really liquid enough to drizzle, but I spooned it on. Served with some toasted french bread rounds. Really delish :)

this recipe made for a great brunch! the parsley pesto went very well with all the veggies. i used hard boiled eggs instead of poached eggs, and loved it! cutting the veggies did take a bit of time, but it was worth while.

very very good. I made it for dinner and honestly didn't think it would be as good as it was. I threw in some garlic cloves to roast with the other veg, but otherwise I did everything as written

This dish is awesome! I rarely rate 4 forks but this deserves it. I loved it so much I am emailing it to two people. I made it for dinner because I don't usually do this much work for breakfast but I would definitely serve it for a brunch. I also fried the eggs over easy instead of poaching. The pesto adds just the right balance with the roasted vegetables. I think when I make it again I will add 1/2 cup of Vidalia onion.
