I was actually looking for a "new" hummus recipe (found one here: "Hummus and Vegetable Lahvash Sandwiches" and substituted mint for the parsley, and used home-cooked chickpeas). I made this recipe but I cut everything in half (dunno how much hummus I used though). I only had a quarter-pound eggplant anyway and I was disappointed about that. I used pita as well as I don't usually have baguettes lying around the house. Also, instead of Sriracha I used 1/4 tsp sugar and 1/4 tsp really bitter hot sauce that my dad made out of pure chillis. Couldn't taste it much. Anyway, first bite was wow, my meat-eating husband enjoyed it too, and even my mom, who usually insists on not eating dinner, had some, plus she cleaned the hummus off the bottom of the food processor.

I made this a few days ago and can't get it out of my mind. Absolutely fantastic! I smeared whole wheat pita breads with olive oil and toasted them crisp, then spread the hummus (Trader Joes Mediterranean) and loaded on the eggplant. I didn't have arugula so will use it next time.

I LOVED this appetizer. Definitely don't skip the Sriracha. This app is delicious and very satisfying. We made this for a Moroccan themed dinner that included other recipes from this site: Moroccan Beef Meatball Tagine (YUM!!!), a couscous, a yogurt/cucumber salad, and the Fig & Sesame Tart with Cardamom Orange Cream. Another hit!

wonderful. we used pita instead of baguette, but that was the only alteration. it was quick, tasty, and so satisfying! don't skip the sriracha - it is key.

Delicious! I found myself with leftover hummus and arugula yesterday, and this sounded perfect. I made it exactly as written (but probably used a bit less arugula than called for). Very nice combination of flavors.
