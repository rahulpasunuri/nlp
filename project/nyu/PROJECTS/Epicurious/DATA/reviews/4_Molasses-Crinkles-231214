Excellent! Was trying to duplicate the Dancing Deer cookies, and this came pretty close. A huge family favorite. After dipping the balls in sugar, I flattened slightly and put the cookie sheet in the fridge for about 10 mins. (while the previous batch was cooking).

Wonderful flavor. We used coconut oil to for the shortening and they turned out great with no coconut taste. Also, baked for ten minutes and they turned out softer.

Made these for my annual cookie exchange and they were the favorite of the bunch. I like them chewier and could be just our oven but I only baked each batch for 6-7 minutes. Still great flavor even when crisp - just need a good beverage for dunking.

I had to write a follow up review after I whipped up some of these with a healthy dose of ground black pepper and Aleppo Pepper flakes (purchased from Penzey's)...Wow! If you like sweet and spicy, save some dough and experiment.

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious! I used only butter (no shortening in the pantry) and used dark muscavado sugar instead of dark brown (not sure this is much of a difference). After reading the reviews, I added extra ginger and cinnamon, plus 1/2 tsp Chinese 5 Spice and a big handful of diced candied ginger pieces. After tasting the batter I added about 1 tsp of lemon extract for a brighter bite and it made all the difference. These are perfect cookies for adults with a taste for strongly spiced stuff. Personally I love strong, funky flavors so I might make a batch with ground pepper or some chili paste.

Absolutely delicious! These cookies were a huge hit, even with my family members who normally hate harvest spices. I did use regular brown sugar instead of dark brown sugar, which may have produced a somewhat less complex flavor, but they were amazing nonetheless. These are great to have after a meal and/or with coffee. One of my new go-to recipes! :)

Rating: 4
Absolutely a perfect cookie, both chewy and crunchy! Perfect for fall and the holidays. I used generous amounts of the cinnamon and ginger (probably close to 1 1/2 teaspoons each) and they are deliciously spicy without being overpowering. I also used all butter instead of the shortening- they came out perfectly. Can't recommend these enough. I used turbinando sugar to roll them in but the green and red sprinkles that someone else suggested sounds like a great idea for Christmas.

I made a half batch of these cookies, since the recipe size was 6 dozen. I ended up with a couple dozen, even with small cookie sizes. Anyway, I followed the recipe exactly, and these cookies turned out perfectly. I dipped the tops of the cookies into Sugar in the Raw, and it added the perfect amount of crunch to the cookie. The inside is soft and chewy- overall, the perfect cookie. I will definitely make these again! I put my dough in the fridge for a couple hours before cooking, and having wet hands helped cut down on the residual stickiness.

This cookie is very good with a mild spice flavor, but not quite the spicy, thick molasses cookie I am searching for. The dough was very soft, and moist hands helped, while a cookie scoop made the job easier. The cookie came out very flat. For my 2nd batch, using a different butter (Land O Lakes this time, last time was Trader Joes), the cookies still baked flat. For my 3rd try, I used Trader Joes butter again, and this time I added 1.5 cups more flour, 1 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp allspice. Baked 8 min, not 10, and the cookies had double the height, more spicyness closer to my favorite molasses cookie from Bake Sale Betty's (Oakland, CA). With the additions in my 3rd batch, I would give it 4 stars.

OUTSTANDING RECIPE. I was craving something molasses-y, and reviewed many recipes before settling on this one. Not only do they look beautiful and make the house smell fabulous, they are the new benchmark for a cookie recipe on this site. My husband who was born without a sweet tooth devoured them, and declared them the best cookies he's ever eaten... and I am a true bake-a-holic. Will make again & again. I also added half a lemon's zest which put them over the top- I love lemon and spice together. Try it!

This is my favorite cookie recipe. YUM. Without fail these bring in enormous praise. I make them for Christmas ever year and all my older relatives love them (especially with tea!). I also brought a batch to my boyfriend's dorm and they were DEVOURED. Tips: I prefer the taste with half the ginger. If using an electric mixer, be sure to stir by hand a couple times while adding the flour or it won't disperse properly. Don't cook these too long!! The chewiness is the best part, so they're better under cooked than over cooked!

I was looking for a recipe that would approximate the molasses cookies my grandmother would make every year and I was delighted to find this recipe. The cookies were extremely easy to make (I didn't have a problem with the dough being too sticky) and everyone who tasted these cookies, myself included, really loved them. I highly recommend this recipe.

These cookies were easy and very tasty. I would definitely make them again. The dough is sticky and keeping wet hands sis help. I think next time I will try chilling the dough a bit.

These were great! Made two batches this week. Read the reviews for suggestions. A few deviations that helped: - Reduce molasses to 1/3 cup (the dough is very soft and sticky) - Bump up the spices by about 1/4 tsp each - Add 1/3 cup chopped crystallized ginger - Bake for about 8-9 min on parchment. Too hot or too long and the sugar suddenly melts! - Be sure to chill the dough thoroughly, or it will be too soft and sticky to handle

Brought these to a family get- together this past weekend, and even people that usually aren't that tempted by sweets couldn't stop snacking on them! I added 1/2 cup of candied ginger, and used dark (not blackstrap) molasses. My cookies didn't need to be two inches apart on the baking sheet, more like one inch - next time I'll put more on one sheet for time's sake.

Rating: 4
This recipe came out perfect! The texture was crunchy outside and soft in the middle. I baked at 365-370 deg and was using a timer for 9ish minutes as they can burn in a blink of an eye. I added 1 tsp of fresh (jar) ginger and 1/4 c. wheat germ for texture otherwise used same recipe. I used a small ice cream scooper (from rest supply store) that scrapes out the batter instead of working dough with my hands so fast and no messy hands. I just dipped the tops of the cookies in colored sugared. Not too sweet either. My only complaint is that they get pretty flat but not an issue. looked like the picture.

Rating: 1
I am an experienced baker, followed the recipe to the letter and had a terrible time with these cookies. They tasted just "OK" but in my opinion are too sweet. The cookie dough was soft and gooey and difficult to work with. I also had trouble with some of them burning so reduced baking time to 9 minutes. I threw away one whole pan of burned cookies which is something that's never happened to me. I will never bake these again. A waste of time and ingredients.

Rating: 4
These were the BEST molasses cookies! So easy and they turned out exactly as described; crisp edges with a soft center! My only suggestion: no need to moisten your hands...chill the cookie dough for a bit and they won't stick to your hands! Yummy!

I love these cookies. I have made them as is according to the recipe and I have added bits of crystalized ginger and have used dark richer molasses. I have made these by heating the molasses up in a bowl in the microwave and then added all my spices to that before adding it to the dough. The flavor punch was great I thought by doing that. (Let the molasses cool before using)

Rating: 2
These cookies seemed very gooey after baking, and didn't seem to want to "set up". I had difficulty removing them from the cookie sheet without the bottoms sticking to the spatula and turning into mush. I think perhaps there is too much molasses in the recipe; after making them I compared this recipe to others for molasses cookies, and found that the proportion of molasses here is much higher. And while I love molasses, in this recipe the molasses flavor overwhelms all other flavors. I did add some fresh chopped ginger and fresh ground pepper, which is always a good addition to molasses cookies or gingerbread.

As suggested from a previous reviewer, i added crystallized ginger which gave the cookies an extra snap! I also only had Chinese 5 spice powder and that worked too. Didn't have veg shortening either so just substituted it with butter which was not a problem at all. Doesn't seem like the original recipe anymore, does it? But will definitely will make these again! Really enjoyed the spiciness.

Phenomenal! I followed the recipe exactly, used crystal sugar, baked for 12 mins. Crisp-chewy perfection. Forget the hassle of cut-outs, these are now my go-to Christmas ginger molasses cookie!

While I was out of cloves I added some chopped crystallized ginger and the other spices as called for. I baked for 9 minutes and they were thin, chewy and a tiny bit crispy. Perfect. I used to make another molasses cookie on this site but I think I'll switch to this one. My husband and I have a sailboat on Lake Superior and in the summertime I always have a supply of molassess cookies on hand because people love them. Also, since I load them up with the crystallized ginger, a natrual remedy for seasickness, they are great for queasy stomaches!

These cookies came out great. After baking for 9 minutes they came out flat, chewy and only a tiny bit crispy on the edges. Perfect. I added some crystallized ginger along with the spices although I was out of cloves. I will definately use cloves next time. Yes, roll the cookie in raw sugar. Yum!!!

These tasted ok but were hardly worth the trouble. They came out a gooey mess, and when I didn't transfer them from the cookie sheet almost immediately, they fused to the sheet. It was awful. The ones that made it to the cooling racks in time were chewy, but thin, and looked like they were all mistakes. Ugh.

Outstanding crinkle recipe. I subbed butter less 1 T for the shortening. Baked for 8:30 on parchment lined pan. Chilled dough for 1 hour and kept chilled between batches. Used turbinado for the topping -- dipped to 3/4 of ball so that sugar rolled over the sides. Used a small scoop to make the balls and added a couple drops of H2O on each cookie to encourage deeper cracking. Results were outstanding! Cookies remained chewy. Spices mellowed over time - - I think the cookies were better after a day. However, the cookies were a tad sweet for my taste. Next time I'll cut the brown sugar by about 1/4.

I would give this recipe four forks if it provided an alternative to using shortening. I received countless compliments and requests for the recipe. I added a little over 1/3 cup of crystallized ginger chips (by The Ginger People," bought at Whole Foods). Also, I found that baking the cookies on a heavy-duty cookie sheet with a Silpat produced more chewy/puffy cookies. I alternated this sheet with other batches done a good cookie sheet with parchment paper and they were flatter and not as chewy. Be sure to use large-granule sugar--the largest you can find--for the tops. I used a cookie dough scooper to produce the balls and it worked beautifully.

This is even better made with whole wheat pastry flour (about 11 ounces by weight). I added 1/4 cup chopped candied ginger and 1/2 teaspoon crushed anise seed. with candied ginger and used all butter. Next time I'll cut back to a total of 1/2 cup unsalted butter (with no veg. shortening)

Very good gingerbread cookies! Used homemade allspice mixture (2 parts ground cinn and 1 part each nutmeg and ground cloves) as well as beef suet/pig fat instead of veg shortening (randomly had on hand from a 2006 NYT article for the best types of lard for pie crusts!) Never worked with molasses before, so was nervous about initial smell, but begin to smell wintry, Christmasy and wonderful while baking! Much thinner than those pictured, but still so very chewy and tasty!

I just made these last night. We were strapped for time and I knew that the dough was going to be really messy, so I mixed them up and then put the dough in the refridgerator for a couple of hours while we went to dinner. The texture was perfect for rolling when we returned. I used Sugar In The Raw and the cookies look perfect. I was expecting them to be a little spicier, though....I still have some of the dough left and am going to enhance it with a little chopped fresh ginger and see if that gives them the extra zip that they need.

I think that these are a nice, easy holiday cookie. I am once again wishing that I had re-read the reviews before making an Epicurious recipe, because I overcooked at least half of my cookies. The other reviewers are right that they turn out crunchy if overcooked. Oh, well. It's also true that the recipe makes just about 40 cookies.

These were very easy to make and quite delicious. I recommend using a small ice cream scoop and scooping them onto wax paper, stick them in the freezer for five minutes and then roll in sugar, to avoid a lot of mess. The timing on these cookies were tricky, 10 minutes made them a bit toasty, but 8 minutes a bit raw, next time I'll try 9 minutes! Overall, nice cookie, nice for holiday gifts.

These were good, not outstanding...as someone else mentioned the 6 dozen yield is a typo - I figured as much from the amounts in the recipe, made them exactly as written (1-inch balls) and got 32 average size cookies. Since it does make only two sheets of cookies, if I were to make again, I would bake only one sheet at a time on a middle rack - the sheet that start in the lower third of my oven were much flatter and burnt slightly.

I made these fabulous cookies for a dinner party. Not one left! Friends asking to take more home! Next time I will grate in some fresh ginger as well. I added a good grinding of black pepper, and a pinch of dried chipotle. Took other reviewers suggestions and rolled them in "sugar in the raw". They came out looking exactly like the photo and as my friends have said they are fabulous cookies. Oh btw, I only got 24 rather large ones, not 6 dozen, but these are cookies for adults.

Chewy, spicy, happy goodness! I used robust molasses and a full teaspoon of ginger with no troubles. Use turbinado or demerara sugar for the topping and be sure to NOT overcook them (they'll still look a tad raw when you take them out...just let them cool on the pan for a few minutes before moving them to a rack and they'll firm right up.)

I only had regular granulated sugar but these still turned out really good. I wonder, though, if you could roll the dough into a log and into some waxed paper, then refrigerate and slice into rounds when hardened. Might be easier than doing the whole wet hands thing (which, actually, is just as easy if you wet the spoon you're using before scooping out the dough...saves a bit of a mess in the end, especially when your 4 year old is helping you!!)

Great Christmas cookie. The spice flavour is terrific and the sugar crunch makes the texture interesting. You must use coarse sugar. I love freshly baked cookies so I formed the balls and dipped in the sugar and baked half. Froze the other half (first of a baking sheet then into a freezer bag). Pulled them out a couple of weeks later and baked them up. Couldn't tell they were previously frozen.

This is very similar to a recipe my grandmother used also, except her's used all butter. It is really helpful to chill the dough for at least an hour before rolling it into balls. It cuts down a lot of the mess. Otherwise, the spice mixture is very good. I have also sometimes added chopped pecans for the nutlover in my household with good success.

This turned out to be a wonderful cookie. It did get sticky while handling it because my hands are so hot, but placed batter in frig for 30 minutes and all was well. I used sugar in the raw instead of sanding sugar....turned out great. Teriffic taste and crunch. My family loved it.

AMAZING! These might very well be the perfect cookie, inside and out. They look beautiful with their crinkly tops and they have the perfect, delicate balance of sweet, spicy and buttery flavors.

My husband says this is the best non-chocolate-chip cookie he's ever tasted, a huge compliment coming from him.
