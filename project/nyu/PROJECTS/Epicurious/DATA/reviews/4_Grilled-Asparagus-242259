Great way to do asparagus! Sometimes I wrap two spears with pancetta and toothpick them. Sometimes not....When doing with chicken or beef, it is great to take the main dish off the grill and put the asparagus on the grill while the meat rests. This should be served just after taking off grill. Yum!

Could someone please tell me how to skewer the asparagus on the thick, bottom part? The top one worked fine, but the spears all broke when I tried to insert the second skewer near the bottom. I have no idea what went wrong, especially since none of the other reviewers mentioned this.

This is excellent. My husband, who thinks he needs aioli or plain mayo to eat any vegetable, said "This is so good it doesn't even need mayo!" If you use a grill wok, you will need to add a minute or two to the cooking time, especially if you don't let the wok sit on the grill to preheat before adding the asparagus.

Easiest and best way to have asparagus - the smokey BBQ flavour is awesome. Throw them in some oil and parmesan with pasta and it is delish!!

This is almost exactly like the recipe I've been using for ages - except that you first blanch the asparagus to keep it looking pretty and green. Also, you can use skewers to make asparagus "rafts" so that the spears are a little more manageable on the grill.

OMG who knew that all you need is salt and olive to make the perfect asparagus??? i even added garlic and lemon juice, what isn't good with garlic or lemon juice??? WRONG, just plain salt and olive oil is perfect!!!!!!!

Such a simple recipe, but so much better than sauteed or boiled asparagus! The char marks give so much flavor and the asparagus almost taste sweet because the juices aren't lost in the pan. One note about this recipe which is probably common sense to many people: skip the plastic bag step - it's both wasteful and unnecessary. Just lay out the asparagus on a big baking sheet and drizzle olive oil on them, rolling them around with your hand if you need to. The asparagus come out perfectly every time, just don't overcook them.

I started grilling asparagus several months ago and my wife and I love it. I don't use as much oil as you recommend and also use ground black pepper along with salt. I've being using 5 minutes grilling time which seems to be enough for the crispy results we like. I'll use your recipe next time, I'm sure it will be great.

My husband and I loved this! It was very easy to make and a simple side for grilled salmon. The flavor was smokey and deep, and the asparagus were very forgiving--not too picky!!
