Sensational! Made these for my daughter's Baby Shower on Saturday. Made a double batch and every single one got eaten. I was asked by several of the women for the recipe. They were the favorite of the crowd for sure. I used a touch less honey as I didn't want it to dominate and they were perfect. I've no doubt that I will make these again and again. They go straight to the top of my favorite hors' dourves.

Sweet, savory, crunchy, creamy...and easy! Hard to beat. Lovely to drizzle the warm honey over the toasts right before your guests' eyes as they arrive. Double the recipe and bake in shifts. On with the show!

These were perfect for FIVE MINUTES. Not a good appetizer for entertaining. It became very dry and hard within moments. I have had just a portion of goat cheese studded with spicy pecans and honey that you spread on crackers that was far better.

I've made these many times for parties. Super easy and well-loved! I like to serve them with the smoked trout, cream cheese and dill on endive spears appetizer from Bon Appetit as well.

This recipe is SO easy that it's become our family's go-to recipe when company comes over last minute. They taste fantastic and can be whipped up in no time. Delicious. They taste great without the rosemary too if you don't have it on hand.

Made these for my "Secret Life of Bees" book club meeting. They went perfect with the honey theme. Made up ahead of time by first toasting the bread slices, then spreading the goat cheese. Just before serving, I rewarmed these in the oven and then added the toasted nuts, rosemary and honey. Yummy, yummy, yummy.

What a great appetizer! I have made this a few times and have always received rave reviews. I recommend buying crushed walnuts or diced walnuts as they are easy to sprinkle and are softer on the palate.

Rating: 4
Loved this. I used whatever nuts I have on hand (toasted), & mix with the softened cheese. I heat a sprig of rosemary with the honey & remove before drizzling over toasts. Yum!

Absolutely delicious! And what made them even better was how easy & quick they were to make. The toasts were gone within minutes. I will definitely be making these again!

My mom and I made this for a birthday dinner. People loved them. I kept hearing, "yummmm, this is so good," as they tried it. Followed the recipe exactly as written. My friend asked I make this again for a baby shower we are hosting next month.

DELICIOUS! One of my friends brought this to a Thanksgiving dinner and I had "just step away from the platter" so I would still be able to eat turkey!!

This is a GREAT appetizer - looks fancy but is very easy to make. Two suggestions: try to serve them while still warm, and make sure the walnuts are chopped very fine (they hurt the roof of your mouth when you bite into the toast). The flavors are amazing, and everyone loved them! Dried herbs work fine, but fresh has more impact. Definitely my new favorite app!

i make a simple version of this recipe already myself - just good toast, drizzled with honey and then spread with goat cheese - which in itself is divine simplicity. i didn't think it could get any better, but the the addition of the walnuts and rosemary is amazing. only thing is, i still spread the cheese on after the bread is toasted rather than before. i like the hot toast/cool creamy cheese contrast.

I tested these out for myself for lunch one day before making them for a party. All I can say is Yum! I whipped them up in a few minutes and ate them just as quickly. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a fantastic and easy appetizer. Don't skimp on the honey, because it can become dry in the oven. As the hostess, I turned away for a minute, and almost didn't get to eat any - they went so fast!

Rating: 4
Simple and delicious. It also looks very elegant with the green rosemary, the nuts (I use pecans instead of walnuts), and is nice and shiny due to the honey. They are great warm but are also great if some manage to go cool during the party.

This was very easy and very good. I made them for a friend's holiday party. People were seeking me out to complement this appetizer. It was almost embarassing, considering how simple it is. I give it four forks for the combination of simplicity and taste.

How easy can you get? And yummy, too. I didn't have any fresh rosemary, and used the dried leaves instead, and they still tasted great. I also baked a Pillsbury Pop-'n-fresh French loaf in a Pampered Chef scalloped bread tube, and it worked great! Folks wondered how I managed to get those fancy scalloped edges on my bread!!!

Delicious and easy! I made these to serve with a mixed greens salad with grilled chicken breast, but I will definitely make them again as an appetizer. I didn't have rosemary, so I used dried herbs de provence, which were an excellent substitute for fresh herbs. (the lavender & honey combo was divine!)

so easy and quite delicious!

I thought this was great, and I will make it again. I made it for a wedding shower, everyone seemed to like it, although I was most critical because I had let them stay in the oven the 10 minutes the recipe called for (forgetting my oven runs hot) and the cheese got slightly dry and cracked. I lightly pushed the walnuts into the cheese so they would be less apt to roll off as most people were standing and eating. Also, depending on the goat cheese you use, it could use some softening at room temperature before spreading to make it easier. Very tasty, and different. Also, I garnished the platter with some rosemary sprigs for a nice presentation. (It also helped people identify the herb they were eating!)

This was a simple recipe that was easy to delegate to any helping hand in the middle of Thanksgiving preparations. I cut the bread and spead the cheese earlier in the day, coverd and refrigerated. We put the rest together 15 minutes before guests arrived Everyone loved it.

This was a BIG hit at my cocktail party. People loved it and asked for the recipe. It is not bland at all. Rather, the flavors are subtle and delicious. Use good imported goat cheese and you are all set. Will make again and again. Everyone thought I was a gourmet, and they were as easy as making a PB&J sandwich!!

This dish is fantastic. I took it to a Thanksgiving dinner and it disappeared in moments. You really do need as much honey as the recipe advises. I was hesitant at first but after sampling realized that more honey was required (as per the recipe).

This is really simple, easy, and fast to prepare. The only change I would make is to not let the bread sit in the oven too long, I didn't like these too crunchy. Otherwise these were just great!

These toasts are so delicious. The honey (Only use a little bit!) sets off the saltiness of the goast cheese wonderfully, and the rosemary and walnuts are the perfect additions. There are so few ingredients and the recipe is so easy to make, that you wouldn't believe how good it is, but I reccomend it to everyone.

Made these for a Thanksgiving appetizer and they were out of this world. THE hit of the party among several other apps. You can't beat the ease of preparation and incredible mix of flavors. Be sure to use a good crusty baguette, the freshest rosemary possible and a great honey. I used Vietnamese honey which has a unique wildflower scent/flavor. I will make these again and again. Absolutely delicious!!

I have made this recipe twice, both times to rave reviews. The second time I added some chopped dried figs in the sauce pan with the honey. It makes the recipe a bit sweeter, but I didn't get any complaints.

Served this to friends to accompany their wine before dinner and everyone enjoyed it. I heated a small bowl of honey in the microwave (didn't use the amount called for). Make sure the goat cheese melts easily - the one I got didn't, so I had to turn the broiler on and the bread almost burned. It was really quick and easy to make, so I'll definitely make it again.

I thought these were bland. If you're serving these with cocktails other than wine, the flavor doesn't stand up (which I should have known before I made the menu). They are very light. Maybe more honey?

Absolutely delicious....very easy and very pretty. Made it for a champagne tasting and it was one of the favorites....used sourdough bagettes because the store had no french....stick with french. Sourdough is way too chewy for this wonderful appetizer.

Loved this one. So easy and tastes amazing. A tray filled with these, and a bouquet of rosemary and lavender as a garnish, makes a wonderful presentation. I substituted puff pastry triangles for the toasts because that's what I had on hand. They worked out great.

We served this before our Thanksgiving meal this year and a week later at a wine tasting. For those who don't like the flavor of goat cheese, you might try a triple creme cheese, like Explorateur, which is also really good with this. I found that I needed far less honey than the recipe called for. This one is definitely going in the "keeper" file.

Everybody raved about this recipe and it goes really well with the Curried Parsnip Soup. Will definately make it again. Everyone requested the recipies for both.

The walnuts and honey really cut down on the pungent flavor of the goat cheese and it is good for those who enjoy goat cheese. However, it wasn't a total crowd pleaser.

so easy and so tasty. the honey really cuts the bite of the goat cheese. i found that i only needed a fraction of the honey stated in the recipe to drizzle on the toasts.
