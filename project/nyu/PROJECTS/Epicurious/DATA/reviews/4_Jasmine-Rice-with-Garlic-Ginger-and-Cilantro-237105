Delicious. Made this with the Sea Bass with Curry-Coconut sauce. The rice was delicious with the sauce, but maybe even better without it. I would make this rice again with an thai/asian dinner.

This recipe is extremely easy and tasty. It taste like it requires a LOT more effort to make!! A definite crowd pleaser and my family's favorite way to enjoy rice (excluding risotto). I've made it numerous times to excellent reviews!

Excellent and easy dish. I used brown jasmine rice instead of white jasmine rice. The extra "nutty" flavor blended well with the ginger and garlic.

Quick, tasty and a crowd pleaser. Served marinated grilled chicken tenders on it with mini grilled peppers around it. Great summer dish! I'm not a cilantro lover so I used fresh parsley instead.

It is difficult to rate a simple 'side dish' with 4 stars. But why not. For this category, it truly is what we all yearn: simplicity, tasty, nutritious and a time saver.

I really enjoyed this receipe! I used beef broth instead of chicken brother, then marinated some beef strips in a ginger lime marinade, sauteed the meat separately, then mixed it all together and served. Mmm mmm good!

BEST RICE EVER!! My boyfriend and I LOVED it. It will be a staple in our house from now on. I did what most people mentioned and I added the cilantro at the end and then let it sit for 10 mins. I also didn't rinse the rice and it turned out great. I found using the fine side of my cheese grader for the garlic and ginger was not only easy but it worked perfectly. Enjoy!

Wow, super yummy. My kids (3 & 5) are big rice eaters, but I was worried it would have too much ginger flavor as 1/3 cup is A LOT of ginger, but we all really enjoyed this a lot. I made this with Tequilla Lime Chicken and the flavors paired nicely.

Loved it! Made the recipe as directed except substituted Thai Basil for the Cilantro (my husband hates cilantro). Would do what others suggested and add the basil at the end of the recipe also so it doesn't cook. Ginger is very subtle - but definitely there. Will absolutely make this again!

Good, reliable sidedish.

This was great served with fish. The ginger was subtle and I might add a bit more next time. I did add the cilantro after the rice was cooked as others suggested.

not thrilling, when the cilantro is cooked it loses its flavor and looks unappealing too. might be better to add cilantro closer to end of process?

Amazing rice!! My all-time favorite. The only thing I would do differently the next time I make it is add more liquid/chicken broth. I think the rice could have used a little more moisture. Other than that, perfection!

This recipe will make you addicted to rice. Everyone needs to make it. Served it twice and the people went wild.........

This is wonderful. I follow the recipe exactly to make the rice. I have also made the cilantro/coconut mix as a pesto to serve on sweet potato gnocchi, which is also delicious. Cook the garlic & ginger in oil as directed and then add to the cilantro mix.

Wonderful recipe! The chicken broth seemed to be absorbed much quicker than the 18 minutes listed on the recipe. I also added some Cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp) to give it a little kick. It was a huge hit at my dinner party.

I used regular Riceland rice and it was only so-so. With the sauces from the other dishes, I might as well have just made normal steamed ricre. Maybe using Jasmine rice would make a difference. Ill try it once more.

This rice is so delicious and pairs so wonderfully with Asian dishes. I served with Asian Flank Steak and Slaw. Delicious!

does anyone know if this can be made in a rice cooker?

Very easy and tasty. You need to like ginger for this to work for you, though. I will use this every time i need a side for an asian meal.

A wonderfully fragrant and visually appealing rice. Can see many uses for it in Thai and Indian dishes.

I've made this regularly since originally trying the recipe. Goes great with Thai inspired dishes as well - ease up on the cilantro and add some thai basil Excellent served with any fish wiht a red curry sauce.

This recipe is to die for! I absolutely loved it. My family did not even know what jasmine rice was and are not eager to try new foods. Once they tasted this rice, they were bowled over. I got compliments all night. The ginger and garlic is so flavorful with the rice and the cilantro ties everything together. I bought the jasmine rice and a specialty food store very cheaply. This is definitely a must keep recipe!

One of my favorite rice dishes. I have also made it with Basmati rice instead of Jasmine because it was what I had in the house and it was still excellent.

This is a wonderful rice dish. After reading the reviews I added the cilantro just before serving. Bit hit!

Have made this twice now, so fragrant and delicious both times. The first time I made it, I was distracted and didn't toast the rice with the garlic and ginger, just stirred it in with the broth, and I was actually rather pleased with the softness of the rice. The second time I followed the directions to the letter, and found the pilaf-type texture to be very nice as well. Was great both times. One change, the same thing I do every time: sub Swansons Natural Veggie Broth for any chicken broth. The flavor is MUCH much better.

This was my first time making jasmine rice, and it was delicious. I used leftover garlic cilantro sauce (recipe from this site)this time, but next time I will just use cilantro and add it at the end, and maybe add a squeeze of lime juice to brighten up the flavor. The rice turned out perfectly cooked & so tasty though- I'll never use long-grain again!

Outstanding and easy. As usual, a little more garlic only makes things a bit better.

Delightful! I agree, the cilantro is best added in later. Nice fresh flavor.

I did'nt cook the cilantro with the rice. Instead I sprinkled finely chopped cilantro while fluffing the rice after it was done. Cover the pan & let it rest for 5mins. Fresh cilantro tastes better than cooked cilantro & you might want to reduce the qty. The flavours mix well.

If you complained about bitter rice, you're using parsley instead of cilantro. the cilantro makes this dish savory and a little ginger goes a long way with the garlic in this dish. i agree, using water is fine if you add a a cube or chicken base powder

One of my favorite fried rice recipes! My mom used to make this for the family when I was growing up, but she would saute some onions and cumin with the garlic/ginger to add better flavor. Can easily substitute water for chicken broth. Can do the same with mint if you don't like cilantro.

Two of my favorites combined: cilantro and garlic. Warning: If you don't love cilantro, this is not for you.

Waaaay too much cilantro called for in this recipe literally made the rice a bitter disappointment. Other flavors suggest promise in any future attempts of this recipe.
