Made this for Christmas Eve dinner for the in-laws and it was a huge hit! I could not find kumquats, so I substituted 1 clementine + about 1/4 cup good marmalade, and also put a bit of the simmering liquid into the recipe with the chopped clementine sections. It was delicious! Used Remy Martin VSOP cognac which was also delicious. One note - the armagnac toffee sauce keeps in the fridge, but the alcohol flavor does intensify as it ages. This recipe will be a new holiday tradition!!

This is so good. I made this recipe in bundtlette pans. I cut the prunes in quarters. It made 10 individual cakes and cooked 30 - 35 minutes. I made the cakes the day before and served them sprinkled liberally with more of the sliced kumquats. That gave it the perfect balance of sweet and tart. YUM I garnished the plate with a kumquat cut in half lengthwise and a mint sprig. I wish I could post a picture. This is so yummy everyone flipped over it.

Delicious. Once past the prune and kumquat preparation, simple. Do use real armagnac - it's a classic pairing with prunes. And do not omit the kumquats (which I was lucky to find here at all). Double the sauce for the leftovers. I used vanilla ice cream as I was not into ice cream making.

Excellent recipe! I have been making it for years with invariably good results. The only problem - that kumquats are not available year around - I solved by preparing a large batch when the fruit is in season, freezing it and than using it year around.

Made this 4 days before Christmas and wrapped it and it was moist, and fresh. It really does keep well. So easy, and delicious for "plum pudding" cake lovers. The toffee suace was excellent also.

I served this cake for Christmas dinner and it was universally well-received. I made the cake the day before, and it stayed moist for two days after Christmas. The sauce is truly wonderful.
