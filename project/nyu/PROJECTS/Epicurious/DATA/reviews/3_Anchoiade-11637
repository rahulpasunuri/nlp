Heh my grandmother would faint if she saw that recipe under "anchoiade". Anchoiade is not a spread. It's not meant to be eaten as such. It's an anchovies, capers, garlic paste with olive oil. It's extremely strong and sometimes includes vinegar too and it's used as a hot dip for veggies in bagna cauda or as a warm dressing over a big celery salad.

This is not one of the better variations on this theme. Save time and effort, and obtain a much better result, with James Beard's recipe for Cuisinart from the early 70s.
