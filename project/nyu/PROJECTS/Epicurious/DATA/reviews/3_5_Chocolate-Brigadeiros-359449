Light corn syrup???? Never ever have I heard of brigadeiros made with corn syrup. Skip the corn syrup if you're interested in making authentic delicious brigadeiros.

The original recipe, which works perfectly, is just condensed milk, butter and chocolate. this is a staple in kids' birthday parties

These were... interesting. I cooked mine much longer than indicated and never got to the swirls-in-one-piece stage so mine were soft but still able to roll into balls. I ended up putting them in coffee and oatmeal because nobody else ate them. Would try again but might look for the traditional recipe.

Sorry (desculpas)-- I meant to say that I have made it with the Borden's condensed milk that is low fat and also fat free and found it to be delicious and a success!

I have successfully made this with the low fat AND fat free. I just make certain to let it refrigerate at least 4 hours before making the bolinhas (balls). You need to to this anyway! Delicioso! E bem gostoso! I have to make certain to not eat more then three! Its a treat BUT it is a true sweet!

Of all the recipes I have tried of this Condensed Milk Chocolate Brazilian treat, I like Leticia Moreino Schwartz recipe adaptations the best. I would not modify anything except to try different chocolates. One pan, one wooden spoon, your measured ingredients and stir, stir, stir! You will find that after the boiling the mixture does separate from the pan when you tilt it--this tips you off that you are almost done. If you find the process confusing to understand you can find some examples of this Brazilian treat on YOU TUBE. Everybody in Brazil makes Brigadeiros or knows about it. Enjoy--it is an international treat! I love using the best chocolate I can get my hands on---Ghirardelli works great! Hats off to Leticia--e bem gostoso!!!

My boyfriend told me that you can tell that these are fat-free. He is a very healthy eater! He said that if I make these again, try to make it more rich. According to him, if I just "roll up fat-free fudge, it would taste like this, if not better." I don't think that this recipe is rich in chocolate at all. I actually used 16 oz of the semi-sweets and it still wasn't enough! This is an amazing treat, I enjoyed them alot, but the dear boyfriend said that if he is going to eat a treat, might as well make it worth it!

I meant to write 9 tbsp cocoa powder, not 9 oz on the last review. No extra sugar needed!

Delightful chewy little treats. I didn't have chocolate so I used a substitute of 9 oz unsweetened cocoa powder and 3 tbsp. butter. Be sure to sift the cocoa powder to avoid chunks.

Followed the recipe exactly. Super simple to make and everyone enjoyed them. I rolled them in unsweetened cocoa powder instead of sprinkles and it was elegant and tasty.

I made a couple of substitutions and ended up with a recipe that did not work  so be forewarned! Wanting to cut the sweetness a bit more, I used 1 oz. bittersweet and 2 oz. unsweetened chocolate. Also used honey instead of corn syrup. Finally  and I blame my failure on this  I used one can regular condensed milk and one nonfat. Seeing the two milks in the pot side-by-side made me realize how thin the nonfat is (it has the texture of molasses) beside the full-fat (which has the texture of toothpaste: it doesn't run). As a result, I suppose, my fudge never thickened properly. I found the recipe extremely confusing on this point anyway: "thicky fudgy batter" is hardly precise; and what is "slides as a mass"? Or "residue on the bottom of the pot"? None of this happened for me. After stirring over the hot stove for 20 minutes I gave up and refrigerated the thing. Later, I was able to roll the brigadeiros into balls, but just barely; if left at room temp, they sagged and slowly settled into flatter and flatter discs. So don't do what I did  or do it more competently!
