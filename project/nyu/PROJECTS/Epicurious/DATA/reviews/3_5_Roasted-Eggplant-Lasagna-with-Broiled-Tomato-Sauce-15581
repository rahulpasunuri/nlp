I'm not sure why I review these recipes since I don't make them as directed...but my version turned out to be amazing so I thought I'd share. I broiled the eggplant and tomatoes as directed. I also sauteed one half of a white onion until brown. I mixed the sauteed onion and the roasted tomatoes into a jar of marinara sauce. I used the eggplant as layers as directed. For the ricotta mixture, I added a ton of fresh basil and chopped fresh spinach, one egg, Parmesan cheese, a big handful of feta, one pack of pine nuts (toasted first), salt/pepper. I layered the roasted tomato marinara with the noodles (regular, not those crazy no-boil), then layered the ricotta mixture and eggplant...repeat. What I think made this lasagna so good was the feta, the basil, the roasted pine nuts, and the fact that I used really good tomatoes on the vine for the roasted tomatoes. It took me about an hour to put it all together, but my hubby said it was one of the best lasagna's I've ever made and I think he's probably right. Next time I'll skip the olive oil on the eggplant slices and use pam instead since this dish doesn't need the extra oil and when you combine all the ingredients in the dish, the eggplant is destined to come out soft no matter what.

Easy to make and we both loved it.

I made this recipe for vegetarians Thanksgiving 1998. I did not use noodles, just eggplant. This was the best eggplant parm I've ever had.

Delicious! I used a mixture of plain and smoked mozzarella because I was afraid my "reviewers" would be overwhelmed by the smokey flavor. I also pre- cooked the lasagna noodles as I don't care for the no-boil products. We all loved the final product. I must add that the comment made years back by another New Yorker regarding Wisconsin clearly revealed their ignorance. Just one of NYC's bad apples mouthing off for no good reason.

My family and I love this recipe and I have made it about 6 times. It is the perfect winter Saturday evening meal, but does take planning with respect to time. This is not a meal you can put together quickly, but the results are well worth it. The last time I made it I substituted a can of Muir Glen fire roasted tomatoes instead of making the broiled tomato sauce which worked quite well. The flavor was a little milder, and I think I should have reduced the sauce a little, but it saved me quite a bit of time, and the results were quite good. If you are pushed for time it is a good alternative also using no cook lasagna noodles help.

This recipe can be made even healthier by using spinach lasagna noodles and using high-quality (i.e. flavorful) cheeses so that you don't have to use much. I've also skipped the oil. I've made this recipe at least 3 times (though, I've used nice (not Ragu) sauce from a jar) instead of making the suggested sauce.

I served this lasagna to 6 guests and was disappointed that it wasn't a sit up and take notice main course. There were no "wows." The result didn't justify the amount of work in the recipe. The flavor components of eggplant, garlic and smoked mozarella didn't stand out as I'd hoped. An eggplant lasagna (without pasta) recipe I've used for years from a Rene Darling cookbook is much simpler and just as tasty.

I decided to make this dish after moving into my new apartment and trying to entertain my diverse family. With the challenge of preparing a dinner that everyone would eat instead of something special for the vegetarians, the diabetic, the picky eater and my mom who has to watch her salt, this recipe appealed to me because of all the fresh ingrediants. We all loved it and I have since given the recipe to all of them. I also liked that while things were roasting I had a half hour to do some tidying up. I will definitely make this again!

I liked the recipe for the tomato sauce...very easy and fresh tasting. However the lasagne did nothing for me. I kept on thinking that this recipe would work better with chicken rather than eggplant. I think the zucchini idea would work better than the eggplant also.

This was a hit, and very tasty. The next time I would use less than the called for amount of smoked gouda. It was a little powerful. I would also increase the amount of eggplant by half for a lighter and more subtle tasting dish.

We aren't the best cooks in the world and are still learning... and This was Fabulous! There are only two people in my household so the first time we made it, we took about half of it to my fiance's grandfather - who is accustomed to his late wife's amazing home cooking - and he thought it was delicious! I made the tomato sauce for the first time tonight and if it tastes half as good as it did just out of the blender then I can't wait!

I would make this again, but with changes. For starters, I made 50% more Broiled Tomato Sauce than the recipe called for -- due to other cooks' comments; yet, for my taste, the dish was too soupy. I also would cut in half the amt of smoked mozzarella so it wouldn't overwhelm the other other flavors.

Excellent for garlic lovers. My husband just loved it. I used a little less mozzarella but added a layer of pepperoni. Definitely needs more sauce, but it was worth the litle extra time to make homemade. Bottled sauce would not be nearly as good. I also used basil instead of rosemary. I'll try spinach and/or zucchini next time.

The kitchen garden is overflowing! I used Japanese eggplant and added zucchini, roasted as directed. I added fresh pesto to the ricotta mixture, and added a layer of spinach, slightly wilted in the frying pan, and it needed about 6 cups of tomato sauce. Delicious.

I can understand how the message from NYC could easily be taken as snobbery. With all due respect, I spent time on a remote Native village in Alaska, and I would have loved some vaccum packed or even canned ricotta. I didn't see the comment as a put down on Wisconsin, I saw it as someone simply stating that they were glad the lived in an area where all things were available.

To the cook from NYC - the last thing this website needs is snobbery about where people live. I've seen this time and again on this website. Let's just look for good recipes. :)

I kind of merged two recipes together, using this one as my foundation. I made the roasted tomato sauce as suggested. But then I sliced my eggplant, salted it as directed, then dried, oiled and grilled it for a few minutes per side. To my ricotta, I added about 3/4 of a cup of prepared pesto that I had in the fridge and nothing else. I then layered per the recipe using regular mozarella cheese and adding a little parmesan to the top. If using plain lasagna noodles (without pre-cooking) you must have, I feel, at least 6 cups of sauce. Then bake in a low oven for 90 minutes, giving the noodles a chance to cook thoroughly, and absorb some liquid. Finally, give it a good 10 minutes out of the oven to firm up before slicing. Delicious!

This is my basic lasagna dish. If I don't have time to make the sauce from scratch, I spice up a good jarred tomato sauce with honey, roasted garlic, balsamic vinegar, thyme, and red pepper. I find I need 6 cups of the sauce rather than the 4 it calls for. I never use all mozzerella--just mix that with the gouda, or with fontina if you like. It's a great vegetarian dish for a party, and super easy. If I don't want to fuss with the eggplant (though I love it when I do), I mix two packages of thawed frozen chopped spinach in with the ricotta filling and turn it into a spinach lasagna. Great!

I'm making this recipe for the second time tonight, trying out sauce for the first time... great with layer of onions, broiled maters and garlic

Poor Wisconsin is reduced to using vacuum-packed ricotta - what is that? Thank Goodness I live in New York!

While this recipe is moderately time consuming, it is not too bad if you work efficiently. I don't understand why the recipe calls for no-cook lasagna noodles - to save time? I thought it made a wonderful blend of garlic and smoky flavors - I disagree with those who said it was bland.

I thoroughly enjoyed this "time comsuming" recipe. I prepared the broiled tomato sauce [excellent!] and the cheese mixture the night before - making the day of preparation very easy! I took the advice of the reviewer who suggested adding chopped spinach and onion with the ricotta cheese, as well as adding more garlic to the roasted eggplant! I too, added additional Italian spices and a pinch of red pepper flakes! The smoky flavors in this dish were very ultimately pleasing to my dinner guests. Served w/ a salad of field greens w/ a lite vinegarette dressing and hot bread - we enjoyed a fabulous meal! I will certainly prepare this recipe again!

Although I agree with other reviewers that this is a time-consuming recipe, I thought it was well worth it. I though making the broiled tomatoe sauce was absolutely essential. The wonderful blending of the fresh tomatoes and the roasted garlic was superb. If time is a problem, make the sauce ahead. I would NEVER use a bottled sauce in this recipe, it would ruin it. Fresh rosemary and fresh (not vacuum packed ricotta) really brings out great flavors. Also Romano instead of Parmesan give more "bite."

I have to disagree with some of the negative reviews of this recipe. I changed it a little by mixing a package of chopped spinach and one diced onion with the ricotta cheese, as well as adding some extra garlic to the eggplant-- the results were delicious! As far as the time concern, I used a bottle of premade sauce instead of making the fresh sauce, and the whole recipe took me less than an hour to prepare. (and now I have dinner for a week...)

Agreeing with previous reviews, this recipe takes an immense amount of time. Specifically with the Roasted Garlic and Tomato sauce. I took the initiative to add more spice... lacking a bite, added a touch more of Garlic SALT as well as a few pinches of oregano (typical Italian) which made a world of difference. I had also added Italian stewed tomatoes thereby making this dish FABULOUS. If you have a few hours, go for it.

This recipe is an awful lot of work for not a lot of reward. It's also got a bit too much cheese for my taste, though if you like lots and lots of cheese, you might like this dish. The main problem was that the lasagna was bland; if you make it, I recommend adding some spice. There's a lot of garlic, but eggplant can have so little flavor on its own that the dish needed even more flavor.
