Great recipe & fun to cook. Enough chopping to include a group. Some additions: upped garlic to 6 cloves, added truffle oil to enhance earthy flavor, added 2 tablespoons fresh chopped Basil and one tsp of crushed red pepper. Would definitely brown the meats and drain before adding to the ragu to reduce grease. Had to chill and skim fat because I didn't do that this time. Liked it well enough that we're feeding 24 with it this weekend!

I have to be honest, I was dissappointed in this recipe. I followed it exactly, but found the ragu quite bland.Noticed my guests putting more parmesean on top as they ate. I wouldn't make it again.

We made this using venison sausage. Very tasty. It takes a long time to make. There is a lot of chopping. I think next time I'd actually use the cuisinart for the chopping since it all blends together in the end.

This is an outstanding dish. I used ground beef rather than veal. I don't have much experience cooking with meat so am usually a little nervous about it, but with this recipe you really just do what it says and it turns out superb - the flavours are really fantastic.

This is a hearty and flavorful dish that is perfect for entertaining because all of the prep may be done before. Our guests loved it. I stuck with the recipe but used ground veal as suggested by another reviewer. I also added a shot of umami.

This was a great recipe! The only things we changed were using spicy Italian sausage, adding crushed red pepper and the Better Than Boullion, beef Boullion instead of salt. The only thing different I'll do next time is drain the grease after browning the sausage (we used 3 links). Man, this was such a good, hearty winter meal.

This recipe was excellent, however, it was extremely salty. I cut down on the broth due to the other reviews of it being too salty..definitely does not need additional salt! I also think you don't need to cook the sausage so much at first, with all the simmering you're doing after that step...they will cook plenty!

I had to make several changes and substitutions, but it still turned out amazing, like restaurant-quality. (Whoever the recipe developer was, was a culinary genius!) These are the changes I made- * Dried sage and Italian parsley for fresh (half the amount of parsley and the whole amount of sage, since dried herbs are more pungent) * Sweet Italian sausages that I made based on this recipe because my supermarket didn't have it on hand: http://www.cooks.com/rec/doc/0,1918,147173-247194,00.html * Added two small sweet tomatoes and 3 sun dried tomatoes * Lamb stew meat * And, because my sauce wasn't reducing fast enough, I also added some mochi (glutinous rice) flour in the form of crushed komachi (little "toasts" traditionally used reconstituted in miso soup). Sounds like a strange fusion, but it turned out so well that I didn't want to go out for dinner the next day; I wanted to stay in!

Rating: 4
This was an amazing dinner! Small modifications - my butcher was out of veal so I ended up using some seasoned ground lamb I had frozen from the last time we made lamb burgers. Also made the mistake of not taking cabinet inventory before I went to the market and only had one can of tomato - I threw in three chopped up tomatoes to compensate. To save on time (and because I had used ground meat) I didn't use the processor which worked out just fine. Lastly, used a healthy dash of truffle salt before serving on each dish - made a wonderful addition! Will definitely be making again - especially because the leftovers were even better!

Having relocated from NYC to the UK, I have been craving real rustic italian food so I have had to take matters into my own hands. There are simply not as many Italians in the suburbs of London. This recipe hit the spot! It tastes rich and delicious. Easy to make and worth the extra bit of time to pulse in the food processor. The texture is just as I have tasted in homestyle italian restaurants in NYC. Great with garlic bread and a full bodied glass of red wine. Will definitely make again!

I made this last night, and I must say that this is the best tomato based meat pasta dish I have ever made. The taste of fennel seeds was a very nice enhancement, almost like lemon zest. I did not processed the food as the recipe called, instead, i just make sure that everything was chopped in small chunks. I think that might have made the flavors to penetrates even deeper. This will definitely be cooked again many times through our dinners.

I LOVE this recipe which in our house has been nicknamed "Special Treat." During my pregnancy my husband made this for me almost every week - and I still crave it! He makes a few modifications (as he always does) including keeping it chunkier and not processing it - that way you can either mix up the flavors or taste the veal, sausage etc on its own. Also a little extra garlic and he uses fennel sausage. Another great thing about this recipe is that it is wonderful as leftovers - so Jeff always doubles the recipe. Many family members and guests have enjoyed this at our house and have given out recipe numerous times - a real special treat!

Ever have a mental lapse in the kitchen? Then maybe you'll sympathize. I've never worked with porcini mushrooms before, and just barely averted disaster. Even though they are dried, do RINSE them prior to soaking in the hot water. I had skipped that critical step, and when I tasted a softened mushroom, my mouth was full of grit! A good rinse in the strainer took care of that problem, and then I poured the reserved liquid through a paper towel (as I should have done before) to catch any remaining grit. All the effort was worth it. The porcinis release a gorgeous earthy, foresty aroma that is unlike any other mushroom I've had. The fragrance and flavor of the final ragu was a treat.

Rating: 4
Delicious. I used a couple of turkey sausages and 80/20 ground beef instead of the veal and skipped the processing. If you can help it, I'd suggest not leaving out the mushrooms - they're a key component and add a nice rich, deep flavor to the dish.

Rating: 4
Even though I had to change quite a few ingredients (I live in Spain: couldn't find poricnis so used Spanish dried boletus, used botifarra instead of Italian sausage, and used stew beef instead of veal), this turned out so delicious. It has a deep flavor and was surpisingly easy to prepare. I will make this many, many more times!

I used more garlic and hot sausage for more flavor as suggested by some. I also used ground veal and skipped the food processor step. Served it over malfadine pasta which has great texture. We enjoyed this later that night. However, we had leftover ragu and it had a more intense flavor a few days later. We served it over polenta and found this to be better than serving over pasta. We like thick ragus on polenta...great texture contrast!

I had to do some driving to find all the ingredients. I live in a very small town so when I want to prepare something like this, it means a 60 mile drive to the city. Fortunately, with this recipe, my drive was more than amply rewarded. This is simply divine. We ( my family ) have renamed it "Died and Gone to Heaven Sauce". I made this pretty much as read with the exception of taking another reviewers advice about skipping the pulsing in the food processor. This step would add only a textural difference. The taste is as one would expect with a reduction sauce, well worth the time and effort.

Fantastic ragu - and so much less elaborate than other standout ragu recipes, especially when you realise you can happily skip the processing stage and that the amount of chicken stock needed can probably be backed off a bit. Key probably to have a really good heavyweight pan to start from. Like everyone else has said, this one's a keeper and certain to end up a family standby.

Love this recipe! Homemade taste, comfort food. Double the recipe, one half with pappardelle, the other in a lasagna format as another reviewer suggested. Made sauce day before.

This was pretty salty. I have switched to low salt chicken broth and have added more hot Italian sausage and red pepper flakes. I also used dried spices and bit more to give it more depth. Unless you add the fresh ones at the end, they loose a lot of flavour. Fresh herbs are best used as garnish

I have been making this once a month for about 7 years now and we always have some of it in the freezer and my kids insist on having it every Thursday (my original review appears much earlier on. One thing I would say is do not put this is in the processor - it really does not need that step, and it is no good for the texture. Instead, just buy ground veal (or ground beef) and follow the recipe more or less (there is a lot of flexibility in with the substitutions, as one would expect with ragú) as is. Lastly, I would add that cooking it for a little bit longer on a low heat does nothing but bring out the flavours even more, and in my view this dish is best the following day having been left for an hour or two after cooking with the pan lid on.

This is my all time favorite - we call it "Special Treat."

As others have commented this takes time, but is it ever worth it! No veal stew meat to be found here, used boneless pork, and added a bit of thyme.

very good sauce. here in vancouver we have so many ethnic grocers that it was easy to find all the ingredients. So ...you have to add a little stock every so often. i just popped back into the kitchen while watching the "Brier", since it's been raining night and day anyhow. I reduced the fennel just slightly because if it were to be too strong there's no going back with fennel. Thanks

This is exceptional, with slight modifications. I used only one dried CA bay leaf (I assume that this recipe calls for fresh, which may be why I needed to modify...) and after the sauce simmered for 30 mins I found the bay leaf taste very overpowering. I removed it and let the sauce continue to simmer, added a can of tomato sauce and Marsala wine to cut the bay flavor. I let the sauce simmer for nearly 2 hours. Once the sauce reduced, the bay was no longer the predominant taste. Rather, the ragu turned out to be the best we had ever made. I also doubled the garlic and added dried chili flakes.

This is a wonderful combination of flavors. I have made it several times for dinner parties. Delicious! I think that the trick is to simmer it "softly" for several hours. I always use fresh herbs and the best homemade sausage and veal from the butcher. Fantastic. The pappardelle should be the best...either fresh or the DeCecco brand. The flavors develop very well if you keep it at a low simmer. Great for a hearty fall or winter dinner.

Very good. Not too time consuming compared to lots of recipes from this site. The second day it was way better than the first, but still I was disappointed that it wasn't as good as the Italian restaurant down the street. Somehow the flavors just didn't meld enough or maybe the fennel overwhelmed the other flavors? Also worth noting we had to add a ton of salt before eating.

Rating: 3
This turned out to be quite tasty, but it really did take a lot of time. I didn't have any porcini mushrooms, so I used regular mushrooms which perhaps added too much liquid to the sauce. I doubled the sausage and used ground beef instead of veal, and ended up adding some sugar, too, because the sauce was too tart for me. But overall, quite tasty and fragrant.

I had an excellent pork ragu at a new San Francisco restaurant called Zuppa the other week and was inspired to make something similar, using this recipe as a base. I omitted the porcini and substitutted spinach at the end to make a lighter dish and add some color. After reading the other reviews, I increased the meat to 1lb mild uncased italian sausage and 8oz (for no particular reason) of the cubed veal to make 5 hearty servings for a dinner with friends. Simmering for an hour was worth the wait as the flavors were very well blended and the meat was moist & full of flavor. I thought about skipping the food processor step to make it easier on myself, but glad that I did it b/c the consistency afterwards was more professional and stuck to the pasta nicely. I also added some crushed chili peppers to give it some kick towards the end. This is definitely goign to be a staple recipe. Next time I will try it with Italian white beans.

This recipe is fabulous. I simplified by chopping the veal and sausage into small pieces before browning, and did not use the food processor. Also reduced the chicken broth with the mushroom liquid. Might add more mushrooms next time. I didn't have pappardelle, so I used campanelle pasta and it was a good substitution. We had this for a weekend dinner at home, but it was definitely good enough to make for company.

This is a fabulous recipe. Don't hesitate to experiment. 1st time made with mild Italian sausage & strip loin, with basil as the finishing herb. Second time make with hot Italian sausage & ground beef with the parsley as finishing herb. Both wonderful. I've used red wine 1st time and white second. As I'm imagining different ways to make the recipe my husband said "why try to improve on perfection". Use homemade chicken broth if possible. I did not bother with the processor step, just finely chopped ingredients. The porcini mushrooms gave the dish a smokey, woodsy flavour.

Oh my gosh, this is SO good. I am reading a wonderful book, "Under The Tuscan Sun" with so much wonderful food talk that when I saw I'd get "a real taste of the Tuscan countryside" I couldn't pass it up. I love cooking things that take time, make the house smell wonderful and have us wishing we had room for more - this is one of those recipes. I made only slight changes; I added about 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper and used Orecchiette pasta. Perhaps the shape recommended is more authentic but I wanted something to catch and hold all the little bits of meat and mushrooms in the sauce. I think, too, it would only serve eight as a first course; four to six is more like it. I have only a little bit left (but not for long!) after serving it to four.

A nice ragu that reminded us of the wild boar ragu we had in Tuscany. The recipe takes a while to prepare but none of the steps are difficult or require careful timing. I made it while watching the 1st half of a football game on TV. A tip: if the sausage is to be salty use ow-sodium broth and good quality canned tomatoes that are not high in salt. I used a tad more wine (sangoviese)and also cooked it a bit longer. Another tip: use a slotted spoon to transfer the solids to the food processor.

Wonderful! I let the sauce cook a bit longer than an hour (about half an hour longer), and doubled the amount of sausage and garlic. The last time I made this dish, I couldn't find porcini and so substituted dried morels and it turned out great. A very hearty dish, and well worth the time it takes to make it.

I thought it was good overall, but a lot of work and time for something that wasn't really "over the top" wonderful. My whole family did enjoy it, though, kids included, so I'll probably be looking for ways to simplify it a bit.

Fantastic! This really tastes like a authentic Tuscan country dish - my wife LOVED it, so I'm definitely going to make it again! I think there are a couple of ways of saving time and making it less complicated for the ordinary kitchen. Firstly, while the reduction with wine is necessary, I don't think the reduction with the porcini juice is - it can all be reduced together after the wine has been reduced. Also, if you buy ground veal/beef and tear the sausage meat into little bits before putting it in, it removes the need for the blender. In my opinion, a dish like this should not be smooth anyway, but if you need to, you can grind it down further by turning down the heat and using a potato masher in the pan. We ate this with a thin spaghetti - which was a total mistake - it should certainly be made with a thick large pasta such as penne for the genuine rustic Tuscan ragu. Superb! (By the way, for those of you that travel to Italy from time to time, you can buy porcini stock/broth cubes in any supermarket which can further intensify the porcini taste in dishes like these).

This is such a magnificient recipe! Yes it's a little work to stick around the kitchen and splash some more of the broth in or wait for it to absorb the liquid.. It's well worth it. And the idea of using the porcini liquid in other sauces has gotten my creative juices flowing! Be sure to use the fennel.

This is the most wonderful recipe I've ever gotten from the epicurious site! It has an incredible flavor - rich, deep, light, authentic. Everyone was no less than ecstatic at the table. For me, it was as if I was eating at an tuscan countryside cucina. This recipe was a true gift. Thank you!

This recipe produced a very rich (veal) and wonderfully earthy (porcini) ragu with a great consistency and unique flavor. Goes very well with a slightly chewy semolina pasta. Only negative comments would be 1) I think some might find this too rich, and 2) This recipe requires that you nurse the pan on the stove for a long period of time.. stirring or adding ingredients every 5 to 10 minutes. --- Other notes... Don't omit the fennel seeds, the flavor is subtle in the end and very appropriate for the dish. One reviewer mentioned adding rosemary, which I personally think would be a totally conflicting flavor for this dish. I could see increasing the garlic slightly, but other than that I would leave it alone. Alos, no additional salt is necessary with all of the reduced chicken broth.

I made my first fresh pasta this weekend, and chose this sauce to go with. It was totally worthy. Sadly, my husband doesn't like mushrooms (and saw my shopping list), so I added the chopped mushrooms to my serving at the end. I would have liked to have cooked them in, (but I did add the cooking liquid earlier). In any case, not too difficult, and very tasty!

This dish was awesome! And definitely not glorified spaghetti sauce. The only addition I made to the recipe was to add some chopped rosemary with the onions, carrots and garlic and some chopped fresh basil at the end. I also used 6 cloves of garlic instead of what's called for. A sauce this good deserves to be served with fresh pasta so I whipped up (or cranked out) a batch of tagliatelle. Pass the freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Absolute heaven!

This dish is good. It's not excellent, and definately not worth the effort. I planned a "country Tuscan, home cooked meal" and felt like I was eating spaghetti. It wasn't even really good spaghetti. The sauce is good, it's flavorful and colorful, but not worth all the effort. I've made numerous "red sauces (with meat and meatless) that are just as good if not better with much less work. I'd say, try it, but don't serve it to guests the first time like I did....My guests thought it was kind of ho hum: They are used to more sophisticated cooking coming from our kitchen.

This was superb. I doubled the recipe but only added 2 cans of broth. I did not wait for the sauce to periodically reduce. Rather, I just added everything and let it cook for 3 hours. It was thick, but not too thick. We waited until the next day to eat it (with really high quality imported fettucini) -- worth the wait to let the flavors develop. YUM!!

I love this ragu. I have made it several times and now only double it. It is best a day or so later and freezes well. For casual entertaining with salad, bread and wine, or simply to grab a quick bite. A definite winner for kids and adults which has become a regular dish in our family.

My husband and I made this last weekend and loved it. It as even better two nights later after the flavors blended.

The first time I made this it was excellent with just pasta, but the second time I made it as a sauce with cannelloni. It didn't seem to have quite as much flavor. I would add fresh basil and crushed red peppers again. I used ground veal to save time. Truly terrific.

Easy to make and very enjoyable! The kids gobbled it down and THEN I told them they had just eaten mushrooms... they were shocked!

I just made this for the third time. The first was with veal, the last two with wild boar. Although I rarely follow a recipe exactly, I am afraid to change anything about this, it is that good.

I am a lover of Tuscan food. This would wonderful over polenta. Even though the numerous reduction processes were worth every bit. Especially with the porcini mushrooms I brought home from Italy. It was worth the wait or should I say weight. Num...

Worth the effort- a wonderful dish for entertaining-freezes well

Hardly a "glorified" spaghetti sauce. San Fran obviously doesn't know how to cook. This was an amazing sauce; evocative of tuscan cooking (without the boar!).

We added 1T of chili powder; with leftovers, topped homemade pizza dough. Excellent recipe, worth the effort.

A friend of mine served this at a dinner party and I was so impressed, I had to try it myself. I made it a day ahead and it was really delicious and relatively easy to make, albeit time consuming. A wonderful recipe!

I don't get this one. Expensive ingredients, time consuming and final result is glorified spaghetti sauce.

Delicious! The consistency was just right, I followed the recipe exactly.

Very good, but it took 21/4hrs to thicken per picture, and it was very,very thick - barely any sauce , mostly meat. I didn't use a food processor,because I chopped meat well. I think there is too much stock. If I make it again, I'll use less stock and cook it less

My only complaint was that I had to fight for the leftovers...

This is an awesome dish--people keep begging me to make it again and again--and I do, with great pleasure!!! I wouldn't (and didn't) change a thing but I might try using ground veal next time just to eliminate the step of using the food processor. Last time I made it a day ahead and it was even better after sitting a day--which of course makes it the perfect dish for a dinner party. This is bound to become a family favorite and a lifelong keeper.

We had a five couple Tuscany Dinner using the May 2000 issue recipes. Each couple chose two recipes. While every dish was outstanding, this sauce and the Fisherman's Soup were raved about. The party was so successful, we are planning similar events every three months using different countries or areas of cuisine.

This was terrific! I made it ahead and reduced it quite a bit. Also I added a little tomato paste. Next time, I'll double the recipe!

I doubled this recipe for a Tuscan dinner party (made it ahead and froze it, too). It was incredibly rich and delicious, but, to be fair, I used very rich homemade veal and chicken stock. The porcini flavor didn't come through very much, but it was still a fantastic ragu.
