Not a big fan. We love smoked salmon, but this recipe was just too sweet for us.

This was really good, though a very simple recipe. I followed the brining process, and then did my normal grilling. I only had hickory, so I used that, but at the end of the smoking, the fish had a gorgeous look to it. It had a nice sweet kick to it, and it paired well with wild rice and some baby carrots in a brown sugar sauce. I would absolutely make this again -- simple and fantastic.

Very good. I only brined for 3 hours, and patted dry (as it said not to do) and it still came out good.--- Next time i will plan a head and do it the right way

This is a definite favorite of our family!! Every summer we roll out the smoker and this is the 1st request!! We make it for dinner and then add it to eggs the next morning. YUM!!

I made this for a graduation open house, and it was big hit. I did 10 lbs. of skinless fillets and very little was left over. My fish store let me have the large styrofoam container the salmon was shipped in, which I used to brine and store the fish, saving room in the fridge. I also served gazpacho, orzo with everything (from this site), fruit plate and pitas with hummous. I was an easy menu that required no last minute work and allowed me to enjoy our 80+ guests.

Solid recipe. Removed the skin befor brining and used my electric smoker. 250 degrees for 45 minutes.

We have prepared this recipe several times and it has been fabulous evertime! The only change I made to the recipe was to add 2 tbsp. of freshly ground pepper and 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper. I served this as an appetizer on Christmas along with Sour-Cream Caper Sauce (also from this site) and it was devoured in no time!

Wow! This is GREAT! We aren't even that fond of salmon, and we thoroughly enjoyed it! I added a little soy sauce to the brine for a little flavor depth. Used a disposable aluminum pan which I poked holed in the bottom to let the smoke through. I used hickory chips, as that's all I had. SO SIMPLE! This one will be a regular at our house!

This was very easy, and can easily be made a day ahead. I used my gas grill and it turn out great. All my guest raved, and wanted the receipe. I will make this again soon. Nice cold for a hot summer meal.

This is an excellent brine. It has replaced the one that I had used for years. I do, however, use a Cookshack smoker at 180 degrees for about 75 minutes (with a variety of woods,) instead of a grill. I place the brined salmon on trimmed brown paper, which lets the smoke permeate more, and also aids in the removal of the skin. Simplicity at it's best!

Outstanding!! Some of the best salmon I have ever tasted. I smoked this in a large smoker using mesquite chunks and with indirect heat along with whole chickens (of course the birds took longer to cook). If you don't try this, your really missing out on a great tasting fish.

This is the salmon standard at our house. For the sake of simplicity...I buy a side of salmon...and just put it onthe grill for about an hour. I serve with two sides...depending on guest preference...cucumber dill sauce and a fruit salsa. Perfect for entertaining.

There is no other salmon recipe for me than this. It is a staple, always wins raves and requests for the recipe, and is awesome for leftover uses: salad, frittata, whatever. The smoking routine sounds daunting at the outset but once you've done it, the whole thing's a snap, and once you've tasted it, you'll be hooked for life!

My entire family loves this recipe, especially the kids. I rarely cook salmon any other way anymore!

I smoked this in my kamado, and the results were fabulous. I served it at my Christmas party. Everyone commented on its excellent flavor. Instead of placing the salmon on an aluminum foil tray, I used an airbake (has many holes) pizza pan. Its much sturdier than aluminum, and the fat went right into the drip pan. I will be making this for gift-giving when salmon goes on sale again!

Moist and sweet and flavorful. I'm making it again for chistmas gifts.

One of the best we ever tried for a grill out picnic. Very tasty with rave reviews from our guests.
