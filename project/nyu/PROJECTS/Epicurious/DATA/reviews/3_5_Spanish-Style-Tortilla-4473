This is the perfect simple recipe for spanish tortilla. Want a quick alternative to slicing the potatoes? Use kettle cooked potato chips and soak in egg mixture until soft. Then cook. You get the thinnest layers of potato, just omit the extra salt. Serve cold on hard bread!

This is very similar to the tortilla you find in Spain, I thought. Good for brunch or as an appetizer or for a tapas party. I have made it several times and it always comes out perfect! use a cast iron skillet :)

Next time I'll skip the oregano.

I made the recipe as written. It was cheap, easy and good (but not great). I'll be making it again.

Thanks, Jason! This is amazingly good! I cooked the potatoes a bit before getting them into the pan with onions to save some time. I'm getting more eggs tomorrow and having some more of this!

This was so good! I made the "Quick Chicken and Chorizo Paella" also from this web site, which by the way was great. I wanted to make a side dish to go along and my husband and I loved it. I took the advise from a couple of the other chefs and cooked the potatoes and onions together in a pan with Olive Oil and 1 garlic clove. I cut the recipe in half since it was just 2 of us but did not cut down on the onions because we love them! I also did not put this in the oven, only cooked on the stove top and it was great, a real keeper!

I lived in Mallorca for many years and eating in restaurants was always difficult due to too much oil and too little flavours... like oregano. I made this tortilla as printed and it was great!

I followed Jason's recommendations and finally made a decent tortilla after trying unsuccessfully for years. This time I cooked the potatoes and onions together in a large skillet, transferred them to a big bowl to mix in the eggs, and actually cooked two tortillas in a small skillet in two batches. It was much easier to negotiate.

As Nicholas said, this is not truly authentic.I have family from spain ,and we only use,potato,onion,eggs,and sometimes garlic.we saute the potato onion and garlic very slowly in lots of olive oil,until soft,then strain off the excess oil,for future use,this takes on the flavours so the next one tastes better. Then incorporate the potato with the egg.Put the mixture back into the frying pan the potatoes were in and set.Keep going round the edges with a spatula to thicken.Then place a plate,at least an inch bigger than the pan on top,and even though the top of the tortilla is not set,turn it over onto the plate.Add a little of the reserved oil to the pan and slide the tortilla back in.Keep going round the edges with the spatula,this makes it thicker and lighter.You can keep turning with the plate until golden. (BUENO!)

I have been a fan of spanish tortilla since I was little, and definately enjoyed making/and eating this one. I did add a few capers, and next time I think I will add a couple of more potatoes.

not what i would call an authentic tortilla. the inclusion of red pepper is decidedly not authentic. i have stated before that spanish cooking is quite under spiced for those who believe it to be on the same as mexican cooking. the spaniards are not great fans of firey cooking. furthermore the inclusion of oregano is a little off. this is not a common spice to spanish cooking. one may also note that this recipe greatly downscales the amount of oil that is used.(spaniards would use at least a half cup)tortilla authentically should be very simply, onions,potatoes,oil,eggs,salt and pepper,and a bit of fresh parsley sprinkled on at the end. regionally in spain you'll find very slight variations on this. (what i just described is the classic tortilla) in andalucia you'll occasionally see red or green peppers or possibly artichoke added to these ingredients. cataluna and valencia may serve it with a little romescu sauce. i spent quite a bit of time studying in spain..so i have a first hand account.

The only variation I would suggest would be to include chopped green onions/scallions or bits of red/yellow/orange bell peppers. As my mom would say, "Es excelente!" - being born and raised in Andalucia, Spain...she most definitely would know!!!

This recipe has become a family favourite. Not only is it quick to make, but it is very inexpensive too! Makes for a great brunch. Leftovers can be refrigerated and microwaved later. This seasonings in this recipe can be adjusted for different tastes. Just remember to forgo the capers if you are doing a cajun version!
