i quickly came to take a look at others' comments when i saw the milk vs. water error on the recipie. i did use the milk, following the Sweedish Cook's comment/recipie version. However, I practically used all that yeast and my dough seemed to not rise at all after either or the two resting periods. Flavor was good but dough ended up a little dense.

Perhaps it´s just me, but I am Swedish and I have never eaten Lussekatter (Luciabuns) with raisins inside of them. Here is one of my favourite Lussekatt-recipes. They become golden brown and not dry at all. I have done my best to convert it from metric to us. 1,7 ounces of fresh yeast 2 cups of whole milk (3% fat) 5,3 ounces of butter 8,8 ounces of quark (to make them more juicy) 0,8 cups of granulated(cane) sugar 0,07 ounces (2gram) of saffron 1 teaspoon of salt 6,7 cups of all-purpose flour Decor: raisins and 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of milk for brushing. 1. Melt butter, add milk and heat it in a pot until 37C/98,6F(body temperature). 2. Dissolve yeast in a big bowl. Add some of the lukewarm milkmixture and stir with a fork until yeast is completely dissolved. Add the rest of the milkmixture. 3. Add quark, saffron, sugar and salt. Stir it carefully. 4. Add almost all of the flour, preferrably some at a time and make the dough smooth. Be careful to not make it to dry. 5. Sprinkle a bit of flour on top of the dough and cover it with a cloth. Let dough rise in roomtemperature (do not open any windows during this time) for about 1 hour. 6. Place dough on a floured breadboard and knead the dough for a couple of minutes. 7. Split dough in about 30 pieces. Roll the pieces into lengths, each about 2cm/0,8inch in diameter. 8. Spin the ends in opposite directions and place them on a baking tray, that is either buttered or has a baking paper on it. 9. Press raisins in each ends middle and let them rise again in roomstemperature for 45 minutes. 10. Put oven on 225C/437F. 11. Whip egg with 1 tablespoon of milk and brush buns. 12. Bake in the middle of oven for 5-8 minutes until they are golden brown. 13. Let buns cool on a oven bar. Enjoy! If you want to see a similar recipe in Swedish, look it up at www.recept.nu.

the list of ingredients says warm water, the instructions say milk. it would be nice if the recipe was consistent. I've made "bread" with both, and with everything from buttermilk (skim) to whole milk, skalded and not. the mistake in the recipe is irritating to say the least, which is why it gets one fork. How can you make it the first time, let alone "again" if the ingredients aren't clear?????

I've made this bread before but without the saffron. Although the recipe I use is just slightly different (the bread is a bit sweeter), I'm pretty darn sure that you don't make it with milk and I've read the recipe several times and all I get is Luke warm water. Not sure how some of the responders read "milk" and even if you used milk when you bake bread it always is with whole milk so that you get the fat content but that would also mean you would have to reduce the fat content somewhere else. In addition you would always scalde the milk first IMHO

Let's start with the problems and changes...like the reviewer before me, after reading the recipe I assumed that the water listed was supposed to be milk. I used what I had on hand--1%. I didn't have any saffron around so I threw in one egg yolk to add a bit of color. The amount of yeast seems to be, well, slightly insane. As someone who has baked bread frequently for the past two years, next time I'll reduce it--starting with only using 75% of the recommended amount. Overall the breads were lovely. They held their shape nicely and the egg wash before baking gave them a beautiful shine. The breads are incredibly rich (1 cup of butter!), and it comes through in the flavor. Fresh out of the oven I'd say you have to be crazy to want to put butter on them. And they have a beautiful texture from all the fat. The raisins were a nice touch. I'm looking forward to making them again next year.

I assume the ingredients list is supposed to say 2 cups warm MILK, not water...
