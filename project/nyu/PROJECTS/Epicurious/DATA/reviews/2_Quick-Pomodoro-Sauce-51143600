Extremely bland. Also, 1/2 cup of oil for a 28 oz. can of tomatoes!? This becomes a very greasy sauce that kills any brightness left in the canned tomatoes.

I just made this sauce using crushed tomatoes (saves the puree step), and added oregano and basil (dried herbs were all I had on hand) as well as a bit more salt, which definitely boosted the flavor. I would also pair it with more robustly-seasoned items like meat ravioli, Italian sausage, lasagna, etc.

This was just too bland, especially for the recipe it was originally paired with, which was a ricotta gnudi. If you do make it, use a fair amount of salt.
