Great summer salad! Easy.

This is a great salad. It seems to me that the reviewer who is on 4 times, is simply trying to promote their own recipes, rather than comment as appropriate.

A great recipe. I substituted fresh corn kernals for the lettuce, and added some chopped up cherries for a little added sweetness.

This was nice. I threw in a few slices of hearts of palm, but did not totally revamp the recipe. The person who nixed this salad appears in the review three of four times which skews the rankings of this nice salad.

Don't use the radishes and the bibb lettuce. Great without them.

Delicious, light - great for summertime. Dressing is simple and divine!

Avocado in a lemon vinaigrette is usual. But the radishes are a such a good idea. They add that little bit of sharpness and crunch that avocadoes lack. Simple and so pretty in a plain colourful dish.

Sorry, but this salad is boring to tears. Another very basic, but wonderful use of avocados is the following: 1 1/2 avos cut into chunks, 1/2 - 1 jicama, cut julienne, and 1 can of pickled beets (or homemade jar type is better)with one head of red leaf lettuce, TORN into bite size pieces (don't cut). Dressing is 1/3 C lemon juice, and 3 T Tamari (aged soy sauce...an essential ingredient and priceless in cooking soups, stews, in butter with steamed vegies, etc). THe sweet of the beet, the crunch of the jicema and the smooth creaminess of the avocado is a winner.

Ohhh YES!! really got thumbs up on this one. Hubby never really cared much for avocado but remarked how much he REALLY liked this combination.

Simple and a great way to get some really healthy veggies. My salad did not turn out as pretty as the picture, though.

Super simple and easy to make. I even had everything, except the radishes (so I left the out) on hand to make it. It's a keeper!

Delicious! Don't leave out the radishes in this salad. It gives it that bite that adds to the flavor. There are many uses for radishes, so they won't go to waste.

I have made versions of this for years. It is simple and wonderful. Skip the radishes and add a few leaves of fresh tarragon. Use really good olive oil.

Yummy salad. I didn't bother with the radishes; why bother buying them when you are only going to use three. I added 1 T. chinese chili sauce to the dressing.

Those around the table set it was nice, different. I used grape seed oil and the greens I had in the house - arugula, red lettuce and nappa, mixed.
