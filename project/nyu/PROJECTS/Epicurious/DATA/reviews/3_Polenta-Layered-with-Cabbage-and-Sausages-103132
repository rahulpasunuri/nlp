Thoroughly tasteless despite having sausage as an ingredient. Adding so much liquid to the polenta made this dish way too heavy and gave it the consistency of a soggy rag.

So easy, very tasty. I would definitely make again. This actually takes a bit of time to cook so you might want to make a day ahead (makes great leftovers). If you start dinner prep at 6pm, you won't eat til after 7:30pm for sure, maybe later b/c this is best when it has a few moments (like at least 20 minutes) to settle.

Just made this. First impressions: added three small onions as I was short on tomato (inserted 3 minutes after sausage added), wise move. I like it flavorful, so I added plenty of oregano, and a dash of pepper, to the mix as it cooked. Also threw in a few fresh thyme sprigs during the boil-simmer process (removed the sticks after). Came out excellent! Polenta Protip: add dried rosemary during the cooking. Also, some parm cheese after the cooking smooths the texture out. Sausage Protip: the spicier and more flavorful the better

I tried this recipe because I had the ingredients on hand. I was surprised after the reviews to find that it was good. I substituted hot sausages for sweet and put a thin layer of ricotta between the layers (because I needed to use it up). Delightfully surprised that it was so tasty.

I thought this would be an interesting new way to werve cabbage. The flavors do not compliment each other at all. It's not worth bothering with, if you ask me.

I've made this several times, and my whole family really likes it --my 9-year-old likes to joke, "Yum, plenta of polenta". It is comfort food and has become a staple family recipe, tasty and easy. One of few dishes that completely satisfies grownups' and kids' tastes.

I really enjoyed this recipe, the flavors were very simple and clean. The "basic polenta" recipe is a little boring, I usually add spices or herbs, etc. to my basic polenta.
