I added some salad greens and crabmeat and then it was 4 forks.

I made the dressing, omitted the celery, and put the citrus and fennel on a bed of mixed bitter greens. The grapefruit in particular was a nice touch. Good dressing too.

I used the juice from the oranges, left out the grapefruit, and used fennel, toasted walnuts and shaved asiago cheese. I had an orange flavored vinegar and would use that or sherry vinegar. You really do need a mandolin or some version thereof to slice fennel thinly.
