Also to give a strong italian tilt...dump the swiss (way too mild). swap for a good pecorino romano. A nice old sharp one...

This was a big hit at my Easter dinner for my vegetarian friends. Needs a bit more kick so I should have heeded the earlier comments. I will make again but change to Monterey Jack cheese and add more garlic and red pepper.

I substituted pepper jack cheese, it was great!

Although this recipe came out delicious, I agree with the other reviewers that it was a lot of preperation, so I am not sure if I will make again. I made exactily ss written, and as other reviewers said it could use a little more kick. I should have heeded the other comments and added more garlic or some heat from hot peppers.

I thought this was fabulous. I made it exactly as the recipe stated except that I cut the recipe in half. Unlike other reviewers I thought it was perfectly seasoned and had the appropriate amount of flavor. This recipe will be added to my vegetable repetoire.

Hearty and pleasant, but if I make it again I'll consider throwing in a bit of basil or, at the very least, parsley for a bit more flavor.

Made this for the wifes networking group 35 women they went absolutely ga-ga over it. I added more leaks and garlic and just about doubled the swiss, it was to die for!!!

I hesitate to rate this because I changed the recipe quite a bit, but I thought people might like some alternatives: I halved the recipe, used frozen spinach and a bit of frozen, partially thawed brocoli to add more texture. I loved roasting my own peppers; it was like roasting marshmallows, but healthy! I used yellow, orange and red, because that's what I had, and mine weren't salty, oily or soggy like the jar variety. I skipped the whole step with the leeks, shallots and garlic because onion relatives don't like me. I added nutmeg and lemon peel to the ricotta/egg mixture, because those flavors really perk up spinach. I used part-skim mozarella (not a big fan of swiss) and used melted butter to grease the casserole dish(a small, high one). At the end, I decided I wanted a cheesy crust, so I topped it with some extra sharp cheddar and a bit more parm, then raised the oven temp. and cooked for another 15 minutes. It was so good with the crust - and very good reheated the next day. This is 4 main course servings with a half-recipe, at least for me.

This is a great dish when you want a "substantial" vegetable. I substituted roquefort cheese for the swiss cheese the second time I made it and it made the dish go from "3 forks" to "4 forks".

I would not make this again, I love spinach but it didn't have a lot flavor. I agree with the others that it was a lot of prep for a mediocre recipe, using frozen spinach is fine. Adding crushed red pepper may have helped the recipe.

JUST A QUESTION TO YOU ALL- I actually printed this recipe in hopes of using it as a spinach dip. Has anyone tried it as of yet as a dip? If so, what did you think?

I took this to a Christmas dinner party and it was a huge hit. Even my husband who doesn't care for spinach had seconds. I would recommend making this a day ahead.

Loved this recipe, very easy to make and quite delicious, next time I'll use a little chipolte puree to kick it up

This was quite good. I used bagged spinach and red pepppers from jar. I increased amount of swiss cheese to full cup and added more parm cheese. I cooked for about an hour, to give a nice brown crust. I agree with another reviewer that a few red pepper flakes would be a good addition.

Have made this receipe three times and it was loved by all each time. I use a bag of fresh spinach from Costco which is the perfect amount. I do use roasted peppers in the jar. Make certain to pat them dry. Sometimes I add a little crushed red pepper if I'm having a "spicy crowd".

I found this recipe bland and disappointing. Tasted like a bad omelette.

I want to make this for Christmas dinner but I'm not into the wringing/cost of fresh spinach. Does frozen spinach get matched oz for oz? 10 oz frozen= 10 oz fresh?

This recipe is the best! I use frozen spinach and roasted peppers in a jar to make it easier. I bring this dish to all parties I go to and I have had 8 people request this recipe.

I just made this for a dinner party and everyone raved. You know how there are always some vegetables left over? Not with this dish. There was not a crumb left; it was that good! There is some work involved squeezing the spinach and roasting the red peppers (I should have used only 2 -- I had a lot of peppers left over), but I did it all the day before. That evening, I baked the gratin and put it in a warming drawer while the rest of the dionner cooked. It was so delicious that it will be a fixture at my dinner parties.

This is a fabulous vegetable casserole! I made this for a dinner party and got rave reviews. The men loved it and all had seconds of this dish. I followed the recipe exactly when I made it. I can't wait to make this again, I have a real taste for it now. I agree it is a little labor intensive, next time I will try using frozen spinach (not chopped) and a jar of roasted red peppers to save some of the prep time. I made this in an oval glass dish, comparable to a 9 x 13 pan, with its own wooden holder and I served it in this. It made a nice presentation because it is so pretty and colorful.

I made this dish for our supper club as part of a Mediterranean theme and it was delicious. I used a smaller dish than a 9x13 (more like a 7x11 size) and it turned out great. I had tested it before supper club using the 9x13 and thought it was a little "flat", and not like the picture in the magazine, so I tried a bit smaller casserole. I, too, felt the spinach prep was a hassle, but went ahead and used the fresh spinach rather than frozen. Next time I'll try the frozen kind to cut down on the work.

I made this much simpler by using frozen spinach, preshredded italian cheese, dehydrated onions, a jar of roasted red peppers, preminced garlic and egg beaters. I strained the spinach, and chopped the peppers, then I threw it all together in a bowl, mixed it and put into a casserole dish with some extra cheese sprinkled on top and baked it for 35 minutes. It came out pretty darn good and only took 15 minutes to assemble. I served with it italian sausage with peppers and onions. I'm sure it wasn't as good as if I had followed the recipe exactly, but it was much simpler!

Delicious, even though I mis-read the recipe and put the extra red peppers on top BEFORE baking. Even the spinach haters liked this one, will definitely make again.

Any recipe that requires this much processing of raw spinach can be done just as well substituting chopped frozen with MUCH less work. It still reuires some "hand wringing" after defrosting but is SO much easier.

Rating: 3
Very tasty dish. The only change I made was to use a bunch of roasted garlic instead of sauteeing raw. Husband loved it and wants it again! Nice presentation too. Quite a bit of work, though, nothing worse than squeezing out spinach! (and this was the second time this week I had to squeeze)

I have made this twice already, and it is colorful and delicious, but takes a bit more work than I expected. It involves a mountain of spinach that took me at least a half-hour to pick over and saute, and the wringing it out part is not my idea of fun in the kitchen. The results were worth it, though. I prepared it as a make-ahead dish for a party, and my guests, who typically don't eat much, devoured it. I made it exactly as written, except I used a jar of roasted red peppers and mixed them in, rather than draping them on the top. The second time I made this, I was cooking for two, so I halved the recipe, except I made a mistake, and actually more than halved the spinach, using about 12 ounces instead of 20. It came out better that way, I thought.

This was excellent. Next time I would try variations with sauteed mushrooms and/or artichoke hearts.

Rating: 3
This is a pretty good dish, and it lends itself to alot of variations, like artichoke hearts. BTW, Fat free half & half is pretty good in coffee, but in my experience it separates into water and something when you cook it. I tried to make a cheese sauce with FF 1/2 and lowfat cheese, and I ended up with plastic-like something in a puddle of murky water.

This is an excellent side dish and company worthy plus it can be made ahead. I used a little more red pepper, leeks, shallots, and garlic and the dish was plenty flavorful. Next time I may use fat-free half and half to cut down on the fat.

I added double the ricotta cheese to this recipe and half the called for spinach and it was delicious and my guests loved it! Also used the leftovers plus the roasted potatoes the nect day for breakfast. Yummy!

Followed the recipe exactly...thought it was boring, dry and not worth the work. I made it a few hours in advance and was very happy that our dinner guest canceled at the last minute after I tried it.
