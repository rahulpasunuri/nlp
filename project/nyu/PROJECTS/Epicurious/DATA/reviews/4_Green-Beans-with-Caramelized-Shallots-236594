We had these for Thanksgiving, they are good but not good enough to repeat. We felt it needed some acid to wake it up, just kind of hum drum as is.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were really good. Along with the shallots I fried them with pork salt.

I used a combination of both green and yellow haricot verts because both were available, and for a nice punch of color. The shallots halved lengthwise seemed too big, so I quartered mine (the shallots I had were rather large). I added toasted pignoli, which worked very well. I also blanched the beans the day before and wrapped as suggested. They were just great on Thanksgiving and saved me both time and rangetop space that day. I will make this again indeed.

This is a terrific way to make green beans. I add garam masala instead of thyme; I think that gives it a much more interesting flavor. I also add mixed mushrooms to the shallots while they are cooking. I use fewer shallots.

These are a great do-ahead side dish. I did both the beans and the shallots 1 day ahead and it turned out beautifully. I added just 1/2 tsp of sugar to help the shallots caramelize and I cooked them longer than the recipe called for at med-low heat to get the nice deep brown color I like.

Beautiful, easy, and not too heavy. A perfect addition to our Christmas Day standing rib roast dinner. I loved that you could do most of the actual cooking ahead of time.

A nice basic addition to an array of vegetable offerings at the Xmas buffet. I caramelized onions instead - cooked them for over one hour or more and sprinkled a tablespoon of sugar in the onion mixture to add a little sweetness.

Rating: 3
This was a nice recipe with some tweaks. I cut the shallots into 1/2 inch rings. This allowed them to be spread over top of the haricot verts. Also tossed a little butter, salt and pepper on the haricot verts after hey had cooled. This is a great do-ahead recipe that is very pleasing.

Rating: 2
The texture of the green beans were spot on, but the flavors weren't outstanding. I used fresh thyme so maybe that was my downfall in that the thyme was a little overpowering.

Rating: 3
This recipe is easy and the outcome is delicious. I took the recommendation of another reviewer and sliced the shallots to spread around the caramelized taste. I found this to be a good idea but word to the wise...cutting up that many shallots left me crying. I'll need to invest in some onion-goggles!

Shallots should be cut into smaller pieces than recipe suggest - lacks much flavor

This is my go-to green bean recipe-- whether I use haricot vert or the plain ole variety. I've made these numberous times and it's yummy every time. Really, it's foolproof. It's great because you can do all the prep ahead and just toss the green beans to heat just before serving. They are delicious and an elegant preparation for any dinner party.

made this for first time at Thanksgiving and doing it again for Christmas. This is too easy with advanced prep and no oven time needed. Take your time with the shallots so they carmelize perfectly.

Easy prep in advance and quick to finish at the last minute to serve warm with the meal. Loved the flavors of the carmelized shallots with the green beans.

The best thing about this dish is that it can be made in advance and just warmed at serving time. It is also a great compliment to a very busy dish.

This was easy to make and turned out well. My 5 year old even liked them and he is anti green vegetables.

Excellent and easy. I just made the shallot sauce ahead of time. Right before serving, I put the cleaned and trimmed (bought that way) beans in the serving dish with a bit of water, covered with a towel and microwaved it until almost the desired doneness. Then, I mixed the topping with the beans and microwaved it the rest of the way (like another minute). I'll definitely do this again.

I made this for the first time for Christmas dinner this year and have already made it again at the request of my vegetarian daughter who just wanted it for dinner. It is so easy and delicious. I didn't change a thing about the recipe, which is rare for me!

Always looking for an alternative to the ol' Green Bean Casserole that's a little bit healthier - and this one is great. Easy, tasty and we didn't even miss those fried onion rings. *wink*

For New Year's Eve, I was asked to bring a vegetable. I hate bringing vegetables because I never know what to bring. I picked these green beans because they looked easy and I could make them ahead of time and just heat them up when I got to the party. Well, what a hit they were! I made them exactly as the recipe suggests. They were soooo good and the host kept thanking me for the delicious side dish. This recipe is going in as one of our favorites.

My guests loved this recipe. Next time I'll cut the shallots to a half pound. It was easy to make ahead then quickly reheat. Will make again for guests but we prefer steamed green beans over these.

This was a delicious make ahead side dish. I'd definitely do it again. Carmelized shallots were sweet and accompanied the crisp green beans nicely. It looked attractive too.

Rating: 3
This is a great way to prepare green beans and easily done while cooking the rest of the meal. I did add a fair amount of fresh ground pepper, some fresh ground sea salt, a bit of lemon juice and a sprinkling of lemon pepper. Also, the recipe only says to cut the shallot in half after cutting off the ends. I slivered them.

I'm always looking for a green bean recipe for Thanksgiving. I made this recipe this year and my brother, who when it comes to veggies pretty much only eats green beans, said he really liked the green beans. Big praise from him. I blanched the beans the weekend before and simply caramelized the shallots the day of.

Good but not great. I will keep looking for the best green bean recipe. Until I find it I will go back to the recipe of this site for green beans with balsamic carmelized red onions.

I love this recipe for entertaining. I make the carmelized shallots in advance as well as the beans and then toss them together to warm up at the last minute. So fresh tasting and a great addition to almost any meal.

This was easy to make but I was expecting more out of it. It is missing something but I don't know what

I liked this recipe a lot, but my boyfriend and I both prefer simple (and easier) roasted green beans. I don't know if perhaps I overcooked them at some point, but my boyfriend complained that the green beans were waxy. Also, I used a lot less oil and butter and felt that I could have used even less. I may make this again if my oven is occupied and I cannot make my preferred roasted green beans.

Rating: 4
Easy, fast and elegant. I did dice the shallots just to get some uniformity going, and to speed up cooking time a bit. Nobody was the wiser, and it still came out beautifully. Save yourself some time, and pick up a bag of already trimmed haricot verts from Costco. They come in 2lb quantities.

Love the taste of onions so I am a big fan of this one.

Christmas Eve '07 This is a great way to prepare the green beans in advance without overcooking them. I don't think you need quite so many shallots to get the same effect. There seemed to be a lot of chopped shallots left in the bowl when the beans were gone.

Best haricots verts ever! I skipped the dried thyme and reduced butter/olive oil. Added lemon zest and a squeeze or two from a Meyer Lemon at the end and it was a big hit!

This is super easy and really yummy. I agree - a little less on the butter and oil, but really good also. I forgot to put the thyme in...(oopsie!) but I also added some salt and pepper before putting it into a serving bowl. Yum.

Way, way, way too much butter/oil for the amount of green beans. The taste was great, of course, but the finished product was just too oily for my taste. I would make it again with half the butter and oil and I bet it would be so much better.

This was delicious and very easy. I also sliced the shallots for faster caramelization and more even distribution. I'll be using this as my standby haricots verts/green bean recipe from now on.

Wonderful dish. Served it for a holiday dinner and got rave reviews all around. Used regular green beans, as I got to the market late and couldn't find haricot verts. Will make again and again -- and not just for holiday dinners. A good way to enjoy something green. Enjoy!

I suppose I like my green beans more done than others so I cooked my beans a lot longer than what this recipe called for.......perhaps 10 - 12 minutes rather than the 4 - 6 minutes indicated. Otherwise, these were great! I served these with the Prime Rib with Red Wine Sauce...

Simple to make and elegant to serve. I used haricots verts, so much more tender than regular green beans--worth the hunt. Only minor change I made was to add a splash of white wine to deglaze pan after caramelizing the shallots so as not to lose that flavor. With so few ingredients, all the flavors shine through--even the thyme.
