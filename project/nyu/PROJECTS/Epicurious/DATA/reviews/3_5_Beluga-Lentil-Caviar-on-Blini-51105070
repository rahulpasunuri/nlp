I really wish people would learn what a word means before randomly assigning it to a dish. A blini is a yeasted pancake, often made with buckwheat. Without yeast it can't be blini. Just because you add buckwheat to your pancake recipe doesn't make it blini, it's a buckwheat pancake, people.

Pretty tasty, and a fair facsimile of the real thing. But nothing can substitute for real beluga caviar: http://foodfancy.net/caviar/river-beluga.html
