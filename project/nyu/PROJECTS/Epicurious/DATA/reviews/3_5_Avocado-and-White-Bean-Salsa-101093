This is one of the most delicious recipes on epicurious. It is always a big hit. I agree with a few other reviewers that 1/2 onion would be too overpowering; I only use a few thin slices of the red onion, chopped. Chopped cilantro is a nice addition.

this one shows up at parties without us being asked to bring it (and we still get the credit). add lots of cilantro.

I've made this countless times now for many gatherings and such, and it's always a hit - if anyone can actually get me away from the bowl.

I agree with so many others, the onion was a little too over powering for this recipe and I didn't even use the whole amount suggested. I added cilantro too because I just thought that it was missing something and the lime juice alone just didn't do it for me. The dish itself is very pretty and summer looking but I have to say the taste was just okay. I'll have to doctor up further to fit my liking but it has potential so I would make it again. It's definitely healthy, especially paired with whole grain tostada chips so that makes it a keeper too!!!

This was not spicy enough for me, but everyone else LOVED it. I gave the recipe away to quite a few people. I doubled the lime juice and added some salt, and it got better. Next time I might add cilantro and some heat.

I thought this was good, although my husband really liked it. I added an extra tomato and a few extra beans. I served with pitas baked w/cumin.

Always a hit at a summer party - the fresh ingredients are key. I generally double this recipe. Add a pinch of cayenne if you want to spice it up. You can also let everything sit overnight, with the exception of the avocados, for more flavor.

This was great but the only thing that I would change is cut the red onion amount in half. After making this I put it in the refrigerator and after that all I could taste was red onion. But will deffinitely make again.

Great homemade salsa.

Delicious. Very fresh-tasting. Make sure to use all the ingredients - don't skimp on the red onion or the lime juice.

One other note I forgot to make - many people have mentioned lessening the amount of onion. While I agree the onion is a bit heavy, I go the opposite route and cut up additional tomatoes to cut it, which basically does the same thing but makes the salsa serve more, not less, and makes it much more refreshing. Additional lime juice does not hurt either.

This is an incredibly easy and extremely tasty salsa. If the tomatoes are in season I would say you could omit the olive oil to make it that much more health concious. Kosher or sea salt is klutch here. Every time I serve this I get non stop compliments, if they ever knew it was so easy... Would be a wonderful addition to salmon.

A major favorite at the party I brought it to! I made about 6 other recipes from this site along with it, and this was one of the best. One guy couldn't get enough of it! He kept telling me that he wanted to "try" the salsa one more time. People started taking pictures of him standing over the salsa dish, because he wouldn't go away! I tripled the recipe. I took the advice to add cilantro, but wish I hadn't, because cilantro is in too many recipes in my opinion. It would've been fine without it. And I wish I had sauteed the onions first, maybe with some spices. Lastly, the salsa got kind of mushy/watery towards the end. I don't know how to prevent that.

I did add garlic & cilantro. It was a little boring. Several people had it at the picnic but other things were much more interesting. I'd make several other salas before I would make this again.

An easy, tasty salsa. I'd say it's more like a dip than a salsa (low on the tomatoes) but a huge hit!

Love this stuff!! Will definitely make it again.

Simple and awesome! Served it at a BBQ everyone couldn't stop saying how yummy it was. Serve with lime tortilla chips and add cilantro and tobasco (as suggested by others!)

I served this with Sangria before a Mexican dinner and quadrupled the recipe. I had to use white kidney beans as they were the only canned white bean I could find, so I cut them up a little. I only had 3 tomatos and 4 tbsp. lime juice (turns out one lime gives about 2 tbsp. juice) but even with the changes this was a big hit. There wasn't even a scrap leftover and I'll make this again for sure. next time I'll add a little more salt.

This recipe is such a hit that I make it for every party now. I also make it for dinner on nights when I don't feel like cooking! Reduce the olive oil and pair it with baked tortilla chips and you've got a low-fat meal!

Boo-yah! This was awesome and received many compliments. I subbed butter beans for navy and used only a fourth or so of the red onion. Served with lime-tortilla chips and it disappeared quickly.

WONDERFUL DISH! I HAVE BROUGHT IT TO SEVERAL POTLUCKS AND GET MANY REQUESTS FOR THE RECIPE. I PUT IN CHOPPED CILANTRO WHICH SEEMED TO BE A GOOD ADDITION

This was a huge hit at a summer party. The bowl was literally scraped clean. It was quick to make - highly recommended.

I wound up pureeing the beans because I hadn't read the recipe correctly. It came up like guacamole and my guests loved it.

This recipe was great with just the bare ingredients listed. I can't wait until I make it next time! I just ate the whole thing up when I made it.

I've made this twice so far, both times it was a great success. I took the advice of previous reviewers and added cumin and cilantro. I added the avocado last, which I think helps keep it on the "chunky" side - wonderful summer treat!

I thought this recipe was pretty good, but wasn't overly excited about it. It was easy to make so I might make it again for that reason. And it does go well with a Mexican or Carribean themed meal.

Quick, easy and GREAT flavor! Added spices as others did to give it kick. Adding black beans to the navy gives it a nice color boost and added flavor depth.

YUM! This recipe was great, but it definitely needed a little kick. I added garlic, jalepeno, and cilantro. All my guests raved.

gosh, yor reviews were right, my guests INHALED this! i did add 1 T of crushed garlic, dashes of tabasco, 1/2 c of cilantro, pepper, a jalepeno, lots of lime juice and salt, and only 1/2 of an onion. it's so fresh i just ate it with a spoon. i would add the avocados after i put in all my spices b/c they get mushed.

Used white kidney beans, though they were a bit big. Increased tomatoes, decreased red onion a bit, and increased lime juice! Served on quartered, toasted pita bread as you need something that can hold some weight! Excellent and refreshing change from standard salsa.

This is a great thing to prepare a few hours ahead. I make it for barbeque & casual cocktail parties. People ask for the recipe. I do use less onion, more lime juice and add 2 tbsp. chopped cilantro.

I thought this salsa was great and easy to make. Next time I would play with it a little more and some cider vinegar, cumin, chili powder, tabasco and garlic too to spice it up a little more.

This recipe has become a staple amoung friends and its now part of the party circuit. Everytime I make it, someone always asks for the recipe. One comment is that it makes more than two servings.

I wasn't expecting to like this much when I mixed it up, but after sitting in the fridge, tightly covered, for a few hours it improved a lot. I did need to add more lime juice, chipotle chile powder, salt, and even a little citrus salad dressing to add moisture and improve the flavors. Everyone loved the final product, though--no one touched the purchased salsa sitting next to it. It was a great change from standard guacamole, and I'll definitely make it again.

This salsa has become an easy stand-by when I need a fresh and light appetizer. On special occasions, I add chopped shrimp cooked "seviche" style.

This is a great salsa for a change from the usual. I think I am going to try a little cilantro next time for a little more flavor. I do not think the onion is to much. My husband loves avacado so this was perfect for him.

I really like this and have already made it again. Like another reviewer, I tried it with less onion and liked it better.

Prepared it for a "nacho bar" with Chipotle Dip and Black-eyed Pea Dip. A total hit!

Served this as an appetizer for a Mexican themed party and it was gobbled up! It's really easy to make: I threw everything together about 30 minutes before guests arrive. The only thing I would change is less onion, or mincing the onion in a food processor so that it is very fine.

every time I take this to a party it gets rave reviews. Haven't had a miss yet and it's so easy. A touch of chili powder doesn't hurt too.
