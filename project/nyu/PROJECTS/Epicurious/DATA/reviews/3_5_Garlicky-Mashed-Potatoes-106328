Great potatoes! I served them with a tenderloin that had a demi-glaze sauce, so the potatoes allowed my guests to get every drop. I like that the potatoes are stiffer than usual, but the cream gives richness. (I had roasted garlic from another recipe, so I used that instead of boiling it with the potatoes.)

I can't believe I'm giving a mashed potato recipe only two forks. To be fair, I substituted Yukon Golds for the red skin potatoes. Whipping cream was actually a bit too rich for my taste, and potatoes took more liquid than called for in the recipe. I ended up adding a few slugs of chicken broth to thin them a bit. I have a ton of leftovers, so I will try the mashed potato pancake recipe from this site.

Didn't think these were the best mashed potatoes I've ever made. I really didn't care for the taste the whipping cream added. I'll be substituting for the cream next time.

Delicious, yet so simple to make. This will be a regular at my table.

These were definitely the tastiest mashed potatoes I've had in a long time. Followed the recipe to the letter and served them with veal saltimbocca and sauteed wild mushrooms. I think the red skins add a nice bit of color contrast. A little parsley moght be nice, too.

Great dish. I roasted a whole head of garlic and added it to the mashed potatoes. It adds a caramelized flavor. Yum!

These potato's are the ulitimate comfort food. I added a little extra garlic and butter, as the flavor was a bit too understated for my tastes. Very good texture, I will definitely make this again.

Loved how subtle the garlic was. Delicious!

These were very good but I will try removing the skins as the previous reviewer mentioned since my family didn't care for them. I was surprised at how mellow the garlic was while still adding wonderful flavor. We will have these again.

While roasted garlic adds a nutty flavor to mashed potatoes, this method imparts a mellower,essence of garlic flavor. Very good this way,excellent with peels removed.
