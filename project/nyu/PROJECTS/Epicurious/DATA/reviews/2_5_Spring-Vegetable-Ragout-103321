This is an absolutely wonderful way to cook fresh vegetables. Fanastic! I look forward to a trip to the farmers market when the vegetables stands are bursting with 'Spring' vegetables (thus the name of this recipe). To the other reviewer, the quality of the ingredients make the dish. You need nothing here to cover up tastes.

I was really hopeful about this recipe, because I love Spring vegetables, but it disappointed me. I think the key to making this work is having perfect vegetables that are right out of the ground. The dish really relies on them shining through. So, if your vegetables are at all dull, as mine were, the dish is just plain dull.
