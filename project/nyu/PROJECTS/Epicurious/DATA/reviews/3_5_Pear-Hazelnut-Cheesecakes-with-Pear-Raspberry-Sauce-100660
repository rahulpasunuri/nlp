I made these as dessert for my Valentine's Day dinner. They were delicious. Also liked that they weren't excessively sweet which was nice since our meal contained some wonderful, rich sauces. I made these the night before and kept covered in the refrigerator. After cooking my pears, I hit them with the blender just a bit to break down the chunks before adding to the cream cheese mixture. They turned out perfect!

The crust on this cheesecake was the best part about it---just make sure to bake it completely. Another reader suggested sour cream and lemon zest, which I used, and the lemon overpowered the delicate pear flavor. The sauce is good, not too sweet, but much better when using fresh berries.

These were a lot of work for less than spectacular results. They're very easy to overcook--be careful.

I TRIED THIS RECIPE AS IS AND IT WAS VERY GOOD. BUT TRUST ME IT IS ABSOLUTLY WONDERFUL IF YOU ADD 1/4 CP SOUR CREAM, LEMONZEST AND THE JUICE OF 1/2 LEMON.I MADE THIS WITH 1 10 OUNCE CAN OF PEARS AND SIMMERED THEM FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. USE ONE LARGE CRUST AND INCREASE THE COOKING TIME TO 40 MIN. IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THEN THIS!!!!!!!
