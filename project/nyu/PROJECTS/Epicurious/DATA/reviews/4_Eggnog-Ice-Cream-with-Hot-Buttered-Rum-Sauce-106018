Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm! Delish. I didn't make the ice cream, but I made the rum sauce. I poured it over homemade ice cream that I had in the freezer already. A must try if you haven't already.

The sauce is a keeper. We had it this Christmas with cinnamon pecan cake and vanilla ice cream. Before I put the rum in the sauce, I couldn't stop sampling - so delicious. I hesitated to add the rum, but that really took the sauce over the top with a more elegant flavor. My husband said it tasted like a "restaurant dessert".

I'm commenting on the buttered rum sauce only as I was not ambitious enough to make the ice cream and simply bought Edy's at grocery. I made the sauce exactly per the directions and everyone was licking their plates! Use a good spiced rum.

Absolutely delicious and everyone loved it for Christmas dessert. The only thing I did diffent was add more nutmeg in the icecream.

This is a very nice ice cream, I opted not to go for the egg nog effect after reading the reviews and minced in some crystallized ginger. It was excellent.

Wonderful, but not eggnoggy. It's simply rum ice cream. I may try it again, with 1/2 the amount of rum (or less), and more nutmeg. Maybe a little dried cloves, too. But for rum ice cream, it's yummy.

Did not love this. It didn't taste like eggnog to me.

Think this is my favorite of all the ice creams I have tried from this site and others. Mild flavor and soooo creamy!

Wonderful! The sauce thickens when poured over the cold ice-cream. This will be our new Christmas tradition as it sent everyone at dinner out to find ice-cream makers!

Simply outstanding, and perfect for the holiday season. Do not substitute anything, if you can help it. It's the holidays! Let yourself indulge! I used Captain Morgan spiced rum, and I think that was perfect for it. I'm sure any dark rum will do, but the spiced rum with the nutmeg was just the right blend.

I purchased an ice cream maker several months ago and have been using it on a fairly regular basis. I have followed the recipies as written and have not been satisfied with the ice cream. They tasted like cheap store-bought ice creams. In an effort to improve the quality, I substituted one cup of half and half for the milk in this recipe. It made a fantastic difference. The end result was much creamier and tastier. I highly recommend this to the ice-cream gourmets.

Yum. I'm a big eggnog fan and this ice cream didn't disappoint me. I made the ice cream and the sauce and served it over warm gingerbread. It was so good I'm doing it again this Christmas.

I did not make the ice cream recipe, but served the rum sauce over vanilla icecream next to a French Apple Tart. My guests just raved about the sauce. It is absolutely delicious!

While the ice cream was excellent by itself, the sauce really made this dish. I made this for a dinner party and one of the guests, after eating a bowl of ice cream and sauce, went back for a second bowl of just sauce.

This, with the sauce, was "to die for". I had to give doggie bags.
