Flavor was pretty good, but maybe a little soapy (I used fresh-ground allspice, which may have been stronger than they had in mind). Texture was the problem--a very dense, scone-like crumb, as other reviewers have noted, not bready as I had expected. I used fast-acting yeast, and probably should have skipped the proofing step.

Perfect outcome on the first attempt, and I'm not much of a baker. Turned out just like mom used to make. I went a bit light on the egg glaze. I'd be more generous next time and make sure I use up all the glaze.

Made these today - delicious - Instead of the pastry on top, I used a glaze to make the cross. 1 cup confectioners sugar, 2tsp vanilla,and 4 tsp milk.

Big caveats for this review -- at the end. While I scoffed at the reviewers who'd said this bun was scone-like, I kind of see what they mean, in that the crumb is pretty loose (rather than light and springy) and the base of the bun is crisp and buttery. I didn't have white all-purpose flour so substituted with 3 cups fine wholewheat bread flour and one cup white cake flour. I also substituted one of the teaspoons of allspice for a teaspoon of cardamom. The flavor was just right -- lightly spiced and not too sweet. I messed up by having to break up the rising time. The first rise was fine, then I had to go out so I punched down the dough and put it, covered, in the fridge. Combined with the w/w bread flour, my other mistake was not leaving it enough time to come to room temperature and rise again before shaping into buns and doing the second rise. The last mistake was accidentally making 12 buns instead of 24! They turned out way too dense and heavy. Finally, the crosses turned out fine, but the half-mixture I used (for 12 buns) was way too much and the pastry was yummy but waaay too rich.

Fabulous! These turned out as anticipated, a soft yeast roll, not a scone. Pretty presentation and great flavor the entire family raved. I read most of the reviewers' reviews which were very helpful, most notably the "Cook from Massachusetts" 04/11/09. I used melted butter instead of crumbled. I added candied orange peel (Epicurious recipe) and chopped dried apricots. After mixing the ingredients I used my Kitchenaide dough hook which saved me some of the kneading time. I formed the buns, covered them with plastic wrap and put them in the refridge overnight and let them rise the next morning before baking. As many suggested, I baked them on one large pan so they would be a bit taller and not spread out. I used a silpat to line the bottom of the pan. I followed the recipe and cooked at 400 degrees for the 12 minutes no longer as another reviewer suggested they would become hard. And as other reviewers suggested I skipped the pastry crosses and piped a simple frosting of 1 cup of powered sugar and just enough heavy cream to be able to pipe them. Well worth the effort!

My family really enjoyed these Hot Cross Buns. I too slightly changed the recipe by using cardamon instead of allspice. Cardamon is the flavor I associate with hot cross buns. I also melted the butter and added with the eggs. Some of my buns flattened somewhat and I think that may have been because I only had regular damp dishcloths to cover them with during the final rising. I think the air came out of some when I removed the dishcloth to bake. My mom uses a much lighter cheesecloth for rising her rolls and I think that works better. Making these few changes, I would make these again. They were really wonderful.

This is an excellent recipe for hot cross buns. I substituted miniature chocolate chips for the currents since I'd forgotten to buy them. They worked just fine, but in the future, I would probably add them after the first rise.

I have never made rolls or buns or anything with yeast in my life but I was feeling adventurous and thought I'd give these a try. The first go I killed my yeast and started to lose confidence, but 2nd try was perfect. After reading the reviews I made my own candied orange peel and replaced the zests with that, and then I replaced all the fruit mix-ins with semi sweet chocolate chips (because chocolate makes everything better!) I just made dessert lol these things are AWESOME!!! This recipe gets an A+ for being easy-to-do for an amateur baker and an A++ for being ridiculously tasty!

These are excellent. Most recipes I've tried for hot cross buns produce a bun that's fairly dry and uninteresting. These have a high butter content, which makes them very tender, and the flavors are delicious. I'm not sure how these could be described as scone-like - they are very definitely a sweet yeast bread. This will be my recipe of choice from now on.

I made these for Easter 2009 and they were good, but not what I expected. I changed a few things (melted butter instead of crumbled so they would be more bready, less scony), and used icing sugar crosses after they were baked (1 Cup sugar with 1 Tbsp. milk). I put the buns in the fridge overnight after they were shaped because I didn't have the time to bake them right away, and let them rise for an hour before baking them the next morning. That saved me a lot of time. I baked them on one large pan instead of two so they would rise more. Next time I'll lower the oven temperature to 375 and bake them for 15-17 minutes (they were too dark on the bottom at 400 deg.).

These were delicious and rose well, but seemed to spread out too much - they were much flatter than other recipes I've made. Next time I'll make them all on one baking sheet to get taller buns. I just did a milk-and-powdered-sugar icing for the cross, too.

I did not make the pastry cross but here are some of my tips. Made 'as is' the texture is perfect if you don't leave the buns in the oven for too long. Even a minute more than when they look and feel ready and you'll have very tough buns. Also, when spreading the egg glaze, be sure to do so evenly because it produces a different colour. Finally, when shaping the buns, be sure that there are no seems in the dough: these will unfold when rising for the second time and baking.

These buns aren't too sweet, just the right spices. Made cream cheese icing instead of pastry, again not too sweet.

Made these exactly as written, and they were very similar to scones - but they were delicious, and everyone was having them for breakfast. I just might modify the recipe next time - maybe not cut the butter into the flour and add it melted with the liquids. But they were good!

Well, they're pretty good, but they look nothing like the photos. Definitely on the scone side of the scale, almost like cookies, even. And this is with gayleyap's modification. Dough rose for 45 minutes after forming rolls. Perhaps that was not long enough? Regardless, they taste pretty good.

Not easy, but perfect. There are quite a few steps to these, but they are worth every one. I skipped the pastry-flour crosses and opted for a simple icing instead. Nice bready texture and lovely spring flavor.

Nice recipe. I didn't bother with pastry crosses. Instead I made a thick paste from the equal amount of flour and sugar, and a bit of water. Piped the crosses on the risen buns. I also added chopped candied orange peel to it. You can see the picture of them with my variation of the recipe at http://www.bakingobsession.com/2008/03/21/hot-cross-buns/

Great recipe...will be my hot cross bun recipe from now. Tried this recipe twice...second time around used my breadmaker's "dough" setting...way easier! Also adjusted the recipe to 2 whole eggs and 1/4 cup additional butter to give it a more "bready" than "scone" texture.

I lost my favorite recipe years ago but this is very close. I add 1/4 cup of very finely chopped HOME MADE candied orange peel also and my family prefers crosses made from a confectioners suger glaze.

These were very tasty but to me they didn't taste like bread buns but like scones with cinnamon and raisins in them. I'm looking for more of a hot cross BUN and not a hot cross scone. But still very tasty and I have enjoyed eating them!

Rating: 4
This is absolutely the best cross buns I have ever had and made! The ingredients are simple... the results are "can't stop eating these things!". This is the only recipe I will be using from now on. I made a batch and gave to some of my friends to have for breakfast on Good Friday morning but they ate them all the night before!

Hot Cross Buns aren't a great delicacy, but this is the best recipe I've found. It is actually very similar to several other recipes I have used, but this one contains at least four times the butter as the others. A very easy-to-work-with dough, I'd encourage anyone who hasn't worked with yeast before to try it--it's wonderfully responsive and you'll learn a lot about how a good yeast dough responds to kneading. And if you've been using your Kitchen Aid (like I have) or have used a bread machine for mixing and kneading, this is a great recipe to get your hands on (literally). I used slightly different spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves, ginger, mace) instead of the allspice used here; also, didn't use pastry strips to make the crosses since I always think that a nice fondant frosting (just powdered sugar and cream) is a real treat with the buns. Easy, quick and tasty.

Bottom line: as of now, this has replaced my mother's 20-year favorite! Dough was easy to work with, sweet but not too sweet, rich but not too rich. My only substitutions were 1T Penzeys cake spice (a terrific blend) for spices and lime zest for lemon. Used chopped mixed dried fruit and currants (Bakers Catalog has unsulphured candied fruit if you're inclined.) Can't wait til next year to make again!

I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the white flour, was "generous" with the fruit (I used currants and dried sweetened cranberries). The were wonderful! They freeze beautifully; pop them in the microwave and then make the icing cross on top. Just like out of the oven!

I would give this a top place on the table. Fantastic with homade Muskadine jam on Sundays on the deck!

These take some time and patience to make, but it was my first time making hot cross buns and they were a lot of fun. I made them for Easter and get a lot of requests for the recipe. Even guests who claim to hate raisins came back for more.

My Grandfather is crazy for hot crossed buns, and this is the best recipe he or I have tasted. I use a white fondant to make the cross. Also, since my grandmother doesn't like raisins or citron, I used chopped dried apricots and dried cranberries, plumped in bourbon. I always have to double (or triple) the recipe and they're STILL all gone by Easter.

Well, I tried this recipe after loosing my favorite. It was pretty close and good. My changes: Add 1/3 cup of homemade candied orange peel, finely diced. Don't bother with storebought it is too bitter! I too like the vanilla glaze on top!

I tried this recipe for Easter and I liked it very much, the only thing I didn't do was the pastry dough that goes on top, instead I made the cross using the recipe for vanila frosting: 2 cups powder sugar, 1 tbls. melted butter, 2 tbls. hot milk and 1 tsp. vanilla. Mix it and pipe de cross over the buns.

Very good flavour and texture. Easy to make and relatively quick for bread. I started at 12 noon and took them to a friends at 3.30pm, straight from the oven. Enjoyed by all.
