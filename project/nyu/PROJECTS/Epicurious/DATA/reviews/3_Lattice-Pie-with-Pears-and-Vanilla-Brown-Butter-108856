I made this pie to take to a summer party. I used pears from my own tree too! It was a hit. Worked fine using vanilla extract instead of the bean. Sensational flavor.

This pie looked beautiful, but tasted really bland. I would add more spices beyond the vanilla next time - cinnamon, maybe some nutmeg or allspice. I added some grated fresh ginger when I made it, but not enough, so I might add more of that, too.

This is a wonderful alternative to apple pie in the Fall. I use 2-3 varieties of pears in the recipe to give it greater texture and also add a touch of cinnamon.

A delicious ending to our Thanksgiving 2004 meal. We used a "Tyler Florence" crust recipe, though, and didn't do the lattice top.

Very delicious pie, not too sweet.

I made this pie for thanksgiving instead of my usual apple-cranberry pie. Everyone loved it. I thought its flavor was unique and very good. I used Bosc pears that were just prior to peek ripeness. I think it gave the filling a little more firmness and the extra money on the pears I think added to the flavor. Even with 2 other pies and a cheesecake on the dessert table, it went first. I just made another one for a friend. It may replace the apple-cranberry pie that I have made every thanksgiving for the last 10 years.

While I liked the idea of this pie I have to say I was less than thrilled with the result. Sorry, it was just too bland for me and my family. I've gotten many great recipes from the site over the years but this wasn't one of them.

I made this last night for my office's annual Pie Day celebration and it was a hit. Although I didn't make a lattice top, with 22 pies on the table, this one definitely got noticed and people seemed to enjoy it. You could actually see the vanilla beans in the finished product and the browned butter and vanilla gave it a unique and delightful flavor. I now plan to make it for my family's Thanksgiving.

This was good and everybody ate it and said good things but I thought it really needed a binder of some kind. I would add a couple eggs to the mixture to make it have a better consistency. The taste was good but I would also add some cinnamon and nutmeg as well. A little boring in my opinion.
