It was okay. I had to use a second pan because I didn't want all the burnt scallop fond in the cream sauce. The scallops took longer than 4 minutes to cook. This sauce would be better over something bland like chicken breasts. Scallops are best when grilled with a little oil, salt and pepper.

I love tarragon, and it is my favorite herb to pair with scallops. I serve this over fresh, braised fava beans and the sauce really works beautifully with the meaty beans as well - thevlast time I made this I also added sauteed chanterelles and my husband said it was the best dish he's ever had!

Simple, elegant, delightful! Scallops were tender, sauce was fabulous without being heavy. 1% milk works just fine. I did add a dash of garlic powder and was rather generous with fresh cracked pepper. Highly recommend using fresh tarragon for the distinct and fresh flavor--had to buy it this time but will make again when my herb garden is in season. We served with angel hair pasta and portobella mushrooms stuffed with crab. DO try it!

I stuck to the recipe. After spending $16 a pound for beautiful sea scallops it would have been a travesty to smother them in this version of white gravy. We tossed the sauce and the scallops were well-enjoyed simply seared with a squeeze of lemon.

Delicious! I also use this recipe for wild salmon.

This was a great dish! Not too time consuming and you don't feel guilty eating it! I followed the receipe to a "T" except I added some fresh garlic to the butter before adding the milk. I can't wait to make this again!

I made this amazing delicious and simple dish when I cooked for the first time for my Mother-in-law. We all loved it, and I recieved many raves. I used the fat free half-n-half as another reviewer suggested. I served with herb mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms. I suggest just making the sauce for any veggie sides for any occasion. DEFINITELY TRY THIS RECIPE!

This was absolutely divine. I used fat free half and half instead of the 1% milk, and it was a wonderful sauce -- smooth and creamy and delicious. Definitely a company dish, as well as one of our new favorites.

So easy and delicious - good enough for company! The sauce is so creamy you'd never know it was 1% milk.

This was good, I really liked how creamy the sauce becomes without using cream...I could not find fresh tarragon at the market so I used thyme, it worked just as well, I am guessing that you could use any herb that would not overpower the scallops too much. I agree with the others, drying scallops well is a must for good searing.

Delish! Easy, elegant and delicious. The tarragon enhances the flavor of the scallop. Seared with some garlic it was perfect. Served with steamed rice and sauteed spinach.

I really like this dish; I've made it twice. It is rich comfort food, but the scallops make it seem more upscale than a hunk of meat. I agree with doubling the sauce. I think I might like the mashed potatoes with cream rather than milk, and less butter.

Very, very good! I agree that it's really important to dry the scallops well. I added about 1/4 cup dry white wine to the sauce - it gave it a little lightness. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Definately the best scallop recipe we've found to date.

I found this to be a fabulous dish. Easy to prepare and the tastseI found this to be a fabulous dish. Very easy to prepare as well as delicious. The only problem I had was I did not make enough. I added about 6 scallops more than the recipe called for and it was not quite enough for my dinner guests.

Fast and healthy, not for company but great for at home dinner.

I liked this a lot. I'll do a couple of things differently next time, as a result of my errors, not the recipe's. I didn't dry the scallops enough, so they came out sort of "boiled" rather than seared. Dry them well. Also, the sauce was delicious, but I let it simmer too long and it became a bit thicker than I'd have liked. Again, my fault. Served with asparagus and red potatoes - yummy dinner!

awesome....I sauteed 3 chopped scallions and a little red pepper for colour and a few mushrooms,also a little whipped cream gave a richer flavour...

My wife and I are always looking for good scallops recipes. We did this one a couple of weeks ago and struck gold--one of the best ever--and simple. If you love scallops and tarragon, as we do, this one is hard to beat. So creamy that it's hard to believe you're using 1% milk. No variations; we did it by the book.

Great Dish

This was a very delicious, healthy dish that took under 15 minutes to prepare. I ended up cooking the sauce longer than indicated so that it had a chance to thicken up a little bit. I served the scallops in the middle of the plate with the sauce extended out. I then added asparagus and potatoes around the edges which went well with the tarragon sauce. Great recipe, I would make it again!!!!

I had really high expectations for this as I love scallops, but, I just did not like the tarragon. In fairness to the recipe, I went into this knowing I was not a fan of tarragon. Despite significantly lowering the quantity of tarragon, I still found it to be overpowering.

Very elegant - taste and presentation. A fabulous main course. Perfect for a dinner party.
