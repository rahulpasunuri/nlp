Meringues really do take 2 hrs, even on a cold bone dry day. Traditional Eton Mess folds crumbled meringues with strawberries into the cream. A simple and yummy dessert esp for Anglophiles.

This is a family favorite, particularly of my teenaged granddaughter, and it's served at one of my favorite restaurants in London, the Ebury Wine Bar. Can't imagine how it could ever "weigh 50 lbs." It's light as a feather if made correctly. The trick is to let the meringues bake slowly at low heat so that they dry effectively.

Super simple, light & lovely. The only change I'd make would be to crumble up the meringues and fold the whole thing together so that it's a proper 'mess'. Cook from NY: I'm not sure how you managed to make a dessert of fruit, whipped cream & meringue 'weigh 50 pounds per plate', but I think you may have gone slightly off-course...!

The tirade from A Cook from NYC prompted me to write in, in defense of this simple but delicious British dessert. This recipe is fairly true to the versions that I've had in England, except there the cream, broken-up meringue bits and strawberries are mixed together in a true 'mess'. It tastes even better if you can get hold of clotted (Devonshire) cream - hard to find in the U.S. It's unfortunate that A Cook from NY's guests were unappreciative of his/her efforts. My guests polished off their plates, even though they're unaccustomed to British desserts. Some tips: 1. Try store-bought meringues - Trader Joe's (am I allowed to mention brand/store names on this site?) are good and reasonably priced. 2. Soaking your soiled plates in hot boiling water does wonders for removing food debris. 3. By Net-iquette rules, emailing in capital letters (upper case) is considered impolite.

THIS RECIPE WAS HORRIBLE. NEVER WOULD MAKE IT AGAIN. DISGUSTING. EVERY PLATE WEIGHED ABOUT 50 POUNDS WITH THE STUFF ON IT. IT TOOK NEARLY 2 HOURS TO COOK. I USED STRAWBERRIES PICKED FROM MY VEGETABLE GARDEN. WHERE DID THEY GO? DOWN THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL WITH THE REST OF THE JUNK. NASTY. NEVER AGAIN.
