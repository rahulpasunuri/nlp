Holy geez this crisp is fantastic! I made it for foodies who couldn't stop raving and I don't even like sweets and I had seconds. I ran out of sour cream so I used plain greek yogurt instead. It. Was. So. Good.

Uses lots of bowls, but definitely worth it. I've made it multiple times, and I find that a dash of nutmeg and a sprinkling of cinnamon adds to the flavor.

Really easy to make and quite good. I subbed out peaches from the farmers market for the nectarines and it was awesome. I would recommend adding a little lemon juice to the fruit to add an extra dimension or use not as ripe nectarines/ peaches.

This is a keeper -- easy and wonderful flavor -- even though I changed to the fruit, used fresh peaches and pears, since that's what I. I used sour cream and because of my choice of fruit I used a dash of nutmeg & cinnamon. I don't think my changes detracted from the 'basic' recipe, just shows how great the recipe is.

This was delicious. It's tart and refreshing without the icecream. With the icecream it's delectable. I couldn't make my crumble top look like the one in the pic though. it was flat... Still very tasty though. Be sure to use unsalted butter, the crust was just a little bit too salty, but still yummy. I will make this again soon, for company.

Substituted raspberries for half of the blackberries and added rolled oats to the topping mixture. Sprinkled more rolled oats over the top, plus added another few Tbsp. of butter over the top. Divine! Received the green light from parents and grandpa to be cooked at more family gatherings. Great tartness paired with the sweetness of vanilla bean ice cream. Accidentally put all the flour into the custard mixture...didn't affect it.

This is my first review as most of the time I'm irritated because cooks don't follow the recipe and then give a low rating. This one is so good I see no one changed a thing except maybe the fruit that was available. I agree it's wonderful!

I haven't made this yet, I just had a quick question. The recipe calls for an oval 8 x 10 ceramic dish. I don't have that-- can I use a 9 x 9 square glass pan instead? I'm not sure if the two are equivalent.

Wonderful dessert! I substituted blueberries instead of blackberries and it turned out great. For a dinner party I put into individual creme brule ramekins and served ice cream on the side with rave reviews.

Excellent recipe - the creme fraiche really makes the difference with this.

Beautiful presentation and wonderful for entertaining, however I made this for my husband and me hoping leftovers would be as delicious as when first made. Needless to say, the texture of the crisp was compromised a day/two later. I would certainly make this for entertaining or next time adjust the quantities for us.

Awesome. just made it for some company and everyone loved it. i've never baked with nectarines before and the texture and flavor was really great with the blackberries. the creme fraiche really made the crumble more balanced/less tart than similar recipes. I will definitely make this again.

It's 5:11. Blueberries from the local farmers stand at 2:21 and an excellent dessert that didn't even make it until after dinner was just consumed as we blew on our forks. EXCELLENT!! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

I've made this recipe twice now, once following the instructions, and once substituting strawberries and blueberries for the nectarines. Although the nectarine version was very good, my family's consensus was that the all-berry version was tastier. However, this recipe is terrific, and it might just be our personal tastes that made us prefer the berry version, which is why i gave it 4 forks.

I made this last night for a dinner party and received rave reviews. The only bad thing was that although there were only five at the dinner,they all had seconds and there is barely enough left for my husband and I to have with lunch today! Can you tell that we loved it!

Made this a couple of times already, once for a neighborhood BBQ. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream. Easy, delicious, not overly sweet, and got rave reviews. I'll be making this often, and plan to play around with fruit combinations. Will also be great in the fall with apples or pears.

Delicious... used peaches though. Brought it to a party and got great reviews.

I made this with apricots too, only belatedly realizing my confusion, but it was delicious! I got a chuckle when the first reviewer had done the same (albeit intentionally,and with good reason)...I will try it again with nectarines....

Made this with apricots, as there weren't any nectarines at the market. Yummy!
