Not a fan at all. Very disappointed given all the positive reviews. The crust tasted good and was easy to work with, though I don't think anything was gained from blind-baking it. Even with the all the chilling, mine still shrunk down the inside of the pan. I think baking it briefly at a higher temperature with the filling inside would have worked better. The filling amounts were off since 5 cups of rhubarb is actually 1 1/2 pounds rather than 2 1/2 pounds. Even with just 1 1/2 pounds of rhubarb, my filling boiled all over the place leading to a burnt crust. The streusel was very rich with there being so much butter and I honestly didn't find that browning the butter lended anything to the flavour. After all, the streusel itself browns during the baking process so any of the delicious flavour of the browned butter was completely lost. A nice idea for a tart and could be good with several changes. However, we're rating this recipe, not our modifications...

This is the best rhubarb tart/pie recipe I have come across, and I also took some of the previous recommendations. Use more rhubarb, less sugar & less flour in the filling, and make less streusel. I also cut down on the butter in the crust and used yogurt instead of cream..the juice from the fruit makes the crust so juicy you can save a few calories here. Will def make again and try w some other berries mixed in. Yum.

This was a very good recipe and I would make it again. It was enjoyed by my guests, as well. I took the advice of other reviewers and subtracted 1/2 cup less sugar in both the filling and the streusel, and a tablespoon less butter in the streusel, as well. Next time, I will use more filling and less strusel so that more of the rhubarb flavour comes through, and half the lemon in the filling, as it almost over-balanced the rhubarb taste. I'm glad I found this recipe, though. This is a bit more "fancy" than pie for a dinner party, and actually a bit easier. With a bit of tweaking, I'll be using this recipe for years to come.

I thought the crust was the very best I've ever had - even my young guests raved about the crust. Everyone totally loved it! I didn't have almonds and used chopped walnuts instead. Next time, I might use a little more rhubarb (I love rhubarb) and less streusel. Served with vanilla bean ice. A huge hit. cream.

This is seriously one of the best-tasting pies I've ever made, and I'm not even a huge fan of rhubarb. The only real issue I had is that I didn't have the appropriate tart pan so I tried rolling out the dough like I would for a regular pie dish. This was somewhat problematic as the dough was dense and sticky, and I ended up with a sloppy-looking crust that I had to piece together with my fingers. Still, it did nothing to deter from the taste. Raves all around.

I have made this several times to raves. I never registered with Epicurious before, but this one got me to do so. LOVE this recipe...but two notes: 1) cut the sugar in half especially if using "sweet" berries like raspberries or blueberries and 2) though I love streusel topping, this makes WAY more than needed. I am using extra on a berry crisp. GREAT recipe.

WOW, WOW, WOW. Our favorite rhubarb recipe now. One alteration was that we mixed some marzipan in the steusel instead of almonds. A keeper!

This is wonderful - even wins over the non-rhubarb eaters. You need only 1/2 of the streusel recipe. Also, I use 1/2 cup or less of sugar in the filling and it is PLENTY sweet.

I made this several times last summer and it was a hit every time. A fresh and enjoyable summer dessert.

Thank you to all the previous cooks. Your comments and insights helped create an absolutely beautiful dessert. One reviewer said there was too much dough, so I used an 11 inch tart pan which work perfectly and looked amazing. Another commented that the top got too brown and we loosely draped some aluminum foil for the last 10 - 15 minutes. We also reduced the sugar by a quarter cup as many of the previous cooks had recommended. The crust was fabulous (I will use this again). The tartness and sweetness were perfectly balanced and I loved the struesel topping. My husband really wanted something with Rhubarb and he LOVED this. I am making it again for Father's Day. Really great recipe.

Wonderful recipe! I made 2 of these for our Mother's Day BBQ and the entire family raved about them. I sent leftovers home with several (was afraid I would eat it all myself!) and continued to get calls from the happy recipients 2 days later. Based on other reviews I slightly cut back on the sugar in the filling (1-1/8 c) and would do it again - it was perfect. This is a keeper!

I didn't have as much rhubarb as I thought, so I eked it out with some sour cherries (from a jar, drained). Maybe that's why, even though I followed the recommendations here and used only 1/2 cup sugar in the filling, it was still way on the sweet side. It was very tasty anyway, though, and it looked great. I'll probably make this again, with all rhubarb and maybe with no sugar in the filling or crust at all.

Yum!! Fantastic!! Made with 7T sugar & pinch salt in streusel. The topping & filling were incredibly good, with exactly the right amount of lemon. The crust ended up being slightly too thick - - this doesn't need much, so I'd recommend rolling the dough out & not using whatever won't fit in your pan.

I have to add my voice to the chorus in praise of this very effective and satisfying dessert. Like other reviewers I used only 1/2 cup of sugar in the filling (and could probably have done with even less). I also ended up using just over 4 tbsp of cream for the crust. Rather than pressing the crust into the pan I found it was much easier to roll the dough out - giving a consistent thickness and a better look to the final product. I imagine you could use most any fruit that would work in a crumble - berries, peaches (although they might get too juicy) or apples. Definitely a hit with my guests.

Possibly the best dessert EVER. I had never made anything with rhubarb or with streusel before this was easy and incredibly tasty. I did not take any sugar out, and to my inexperienced taste, the tart was tart enough. I did use lemon sugar in the crust and one quarter cup of the sugar for filling, perhaps this enhanced the tartness.

I agree totally with prev reveiws in that you can cut sugar in filling by 1/2 and it really keeps the tartness of the dessert. I also had used 5-6 T of cream to get my crust good and clumpy and it turned out really well. I also cut the butter in the streusel to 8 T and it still worked great. Served with blackberry chocolate ice cream. Yummy!

Wow, this is a keeper. The crust was incredible and the filling nice and tart. It really wasn't hard to put together. I used frozen because I couldn't find fresh and it still turned out great. It was a great hit with my husband.

This is a wonderful dessert. Mine ended up quite high for a tart (I'm suspecting that I may have used a 9" tart pan instead of 10") and made for a lovely presentation. I reduced the sugar by half a cup - it turned out nice and tart. The topping browned a little too much in one hour, but I think that might have been the fault of the tiny lakeside cabin oven I was using. This is a great use for rhubarb that isn't ruby red since the topping and crust are the most prominent. Very yummy.

This was excellent. I only used about half of the sugar in the filling, and it could have used even less. My rhubarb wasn't quite as tart as I would like. The crust is fairly sweet and the topping is very sweet, so I think its best to leave the filling good and tangy. Overall, this makes a delicious tart. I've been looking for a good press-in tart crust. This is a very simple and tasty one that should work with almost any sweet tart.

This was an easy recipe to prepare (especially since it's pretty hot in Chicago this week and I didn't turn the oven on until 11 pm). The crust worked great and the filling was good, but I found that there was too much streusel and it was too sweet. This week I will try it again without the topping and maybe some berries.

Simply FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!! I cut down on the sugar by 1/4 cup & the sweetness was perfect.....a big hit!!!!!!!

Extremely sweet.. even cut half a cup of the sugar out and still super sweet, maybe cut the sugar in half all together, as well as the streusel part.. too sweet, could see potential in the recipe though

We liked this a lot. It was reasonably easy to prepare. I used a 10" springform pan and it unmolded beautifully. It looks like a large amount of ingredients but they all work well together. The crust is just excellent (I needed more heavy cream than 4 Tbs). A lovely spring treat now that rhubarb is back in the market.

Wonderful. I didn't have enough rhubarb so I also used raspberries. (Both frozen)It turned out very well. I would recommend it to anyone and will try it with rhubarb alone next time.

i really loved this recipe with a few (slight) changes. the crust recipe didn't specify to blind bake the crust, which was a shame, because even after the freezing and baking, it shrunk down to almost nothing. i think next time i'll use my own crust recipe. i used pears instad of rhubarb (because that's all i have) so i reduced the amount of sugar. i also cut down the butter in the streusel topping to just 8 T. but i noticed that the streusel topping (while delicious), didn't have much of the browned butter flavour...and instead was just sweet. it still tasted delicious, but, i felt that the overwhelming amount of brown sugar resulted in a crystalized, grainy mouthfeel.

This is wonderful. I'm not much of a rhubarb eater, but this recipe is delicious. I used a bag of frozen rhubarb and a bag of frozen bing cherries. I just let the rhubarb and cherries thaw and then add the flour and lemon peel. Great! A dish you don't want to be without!!

Since rhubarb has just started coming into season in PA, I tried out this Epicurious "dessert of the year." I would definitly make it again with a few tweaks: 1)add a bit less sugar to the rhubarb (especially if you like it a bit tart); 2)use less butter in the crumble topping, probably 7 instead of 9 Tbl; 3)add a pinch of salt to the crumble topping to enhance the sweetness.

Delicious! I had never tried any recipe with rhubarb before so was not sure how my family would like it. It was a big hit. Reminded my husband of his mother's cooking! A Keeper for my family!

This is also very good when you add fresh strawberries, other berries or apples
