This was great. I agree with others that the filling was perhaps a little too tart, if not served with whipped cream or ice cream. I successfully halved the recipe for a cute four-serving tart (rolled the dough out to 8.5 in. diameter). I'll be keeping this in mind for a summer dinner party dessert.

Super easy and delicious, especially if you add about 1 T more of sugar to the fruit filling. I've made this twice and used slightly more sugar the second time and it was just right. (BTW, I typically don't use as much sugar as most recipes call for, but the rhubarb and raspberries were too tart.) Also, the second time around, I divided the dough in two and made cute little tarts, like you see in the shops, and was still able to bake on the same piece of parchment. Plan to try this with other fruit as the season progresses since the crust is a keeper and it is super easy.

I thought this was just okay. Followed recipe exactly. I was dismayed to see how much the crostata had spread in the pan when I looked half way through - but the borders held. It was too tart for my taste - unless served with whipped or ice cream.

Wow... we aren't even finished eating the one I just made and I'm already thinking about making the next one. This is really a delicious fruit dessert for adults. The one third cup sugar was the perfect amount. Also, I'm a pretty horrible crust maker, but I was able to easily put this one together. I didn't have raw sugar, so I sprinkled the crust with brown sugar, which worked well. I wouldn't recommend leaving the crust plain.

This really is as good as the previous reviewers claim. The dough is really, really short. If you don't have a food processor, it will be very sticky--flour your hands to work the butter in and to form the ball. I may try the crust with a little less butter when I'm in my city kitchen that doesn't have a food processor. The fruit can be frozen so the tart can be made year round: wipe rhubarb with a damp paper towel, dry it, cut into pieces, put in a freezer bag and suck the air out with a straw before sealing. Freeze the berries on a tray and store in freezer boxes. I've frozen enough for six batches. My family likes this so much that I'm sure they will ask for it at Thanksgiving!

excellent recipe- the crust really is amazing - made it a few times as written

I've made this a couple times now, and I love it. I've never ever purchased/used/needed cornstarch before, so I substituted 1/4 cup tapioca plus 3 tbls. water both times, and the filling has been juicy but not runny. I also switched the quantities of the flour the second time around (1 cup WW, only 1/2 cup all-purpose), and I decided I preferred it that way :) I'm planning to make these for an upcoming event because it is so easy to make and can easily be made ahead of time, assembled and baked later. Delicious, easy, seasonal and pretty!

Made this twice, just as written. Very yummy! Second time was for a bake sale and a girl gave me $30 before I even got it in the door. Will make it again now that the rhubarb is coming up.

I love this recipe. I have made it twice and the second time, there was just a little something missing. I thought I would maybe like a sweeter crust, or sweeter filling? But, then I checked the original magazine recipe (which I had used the first time) and saw that in the print version it calls for 2/3 cup sugar instead of 1/3 cup. I think it makes a difference. Just a thought!

I made this unusual dessert on New Year's Eve, and found it quite easy, including the rolling out of the dough on the parchment paper. Although I dislike like rhubarb and strawberry desserts, the combination with raspberries was wonderful. I cut the larger rhubarb stalks in half lengthwise before chopping into 1/2 inch pieces. I used 2 oz. extra raspberries, including 6 or 7 that I put on the crostata just before baking. I added an extra 1/2 Tbs. water to dissolve the cornstarch. Baking took 40 minutes; the crust looked done earlier, but that was because the egg glaze made it appear that way. Even then, the bottom of the crust was slightly underdone. The crust was good, but I might try it with a walnut crust next time. I will definitely make this again!

Great presentation, lots of tasty fruit. A great spring dessert!

Fantastic crostata recipe. I loved the crust-- nutty, flakey and really easy to work with. The filling was flawless too. It's a really awesome recipe that I plan to make again with different fillings.

I thought this recipe was fantastic! I have made this 3x once with cherries and it got rave reviews. Cooking the fruit with the sugar and then adding the c.starch gave the fruit a beautiful glossy look. I made it with whole wheat pastry flour and one time with whole wheat flour. The WW version was a pain to roll out but the texture had more tooth and it tasted nuttier. Keeper.

So easy and SO delicious. I subbed barley flour for whole wheat, it was nutty and in my opinion lighter than it otherwise would have been. I also used strawberries instead of raspberries and followed the rest of the recipe exactly - BUT - mine was done baking in only 35 minutes. Could have possibly been due to the barley flour, I don't know, but it browned quickly on top and underneath, and my oven is usually SLOOOW. I was concerned that this would mean a way-too-soggy middle but the amount of cornstarch was just right for the conditions I guess. Will definitely make again for a special occasion (not just for devouring single handedly on my back porch). And will definitely use the pastry recipe for other tarts and galettes. Mmmm, good times ahead.

Sorry to say that this was a disaster for me. I love rhubarb, and used handpicked from my parents' garden. There were not nearly enough strawberries or sugar to compensate for the rhubarb. Plus the crust pretty much collapsed and I now have a jelly roll pan of baked inedible rhubarb with raspberries.

Hey idlefood, the sugar level is totally correct, although it surprised me as well.

Rhubarb is hard to find around here. I could only get a skimpy pound, so doubled on the rasberries. Should have used more cornstarch to accommodate the extra juice of the rasberries. That made it was too juicy for the crust to look good - - - BUT it was absolutely delicious, although could have looked prettier.

I made this for a party, exactly as written, and everyone raved.

Query: 1/3 of a cup of sugar? For 4 cups of rhubarb? Is that correct? No one seems to have commented on this, but it's much less sugar than you'd usually find in a rhubarb recipe, so I thought I'd check...

I've made this exactly as written, and it was fabulous. I've also tinkered with it a bit, and substituted strawberries for the raspberries once, and another time fitted the crust into a tart pan for a more upscale presentation. It's an incredibly versatile recipe, and each iteration I tried was simply fantastic, and very uncomplicated.

Definitely a huge family hit, will definitely make it again. Great presentation, lots of tasty fruit. A great spring dessert!

This is easy and excellent! I felt like it was a restaurant quality dish. Mine may have looked a bit more rustic (rolling out dough is not my strong point). The whole wheat flour is a must. I bought it just for this recipe and it definitely adds a lot. Will make this over and over again!

Yum...Made this last night. It was great for breakfast, also. The crust was a little difficult, but just pieced it back into the cracks. Used frozen raspberries from my garden. Did not add any more flour and baked the recipe time.

I made this three time now, twice as with the listed fruit, and once with a rhubarb/strawberry mix. This is a great crust that can hold a lot of liquid during cooking, but ensuring you've mixed in enough flour is an absolute must as it softens quickly. My only issue was with the instructions for the rhubarb which wants a stock cut into 1/2" slices, but the picture shows either a different cut (stock halved then sliced) or the rhubarb cooked much longer in the pan than they state. I also reserved half the raspberries until after the cooling period so that some would stay intact during baking.

The filling was fantastic, and the crust, after cooked, was great. I had to add more flour and the dough still didn't come together very well and was a sticky pain to roll out. I'll make this again, but will add another 1/4 cup of flour.

Made this a couple of hours ago, and it's already gone. Fabulous dessert. My raspberries were fresh, but not as ripe or juicy as I would have liked, so I added a couple of tablespoonfuls of raspberry jam to the filling. Heavenly. Crust was great too. I will make this often. As someone else already stated, mine was done about ten minutes early--watch this carefully and check well before 40 minutes.

I made this filling to go in a tart shell I had already made so I can't comment on the pastry. The filling was very tasty but I found that the cornstarch made it too pasty, and didn't blend completely. I usually make fillings with tapioca so I may try that next time instead. I also reduced the sugar. And increased the recipe 50% by adding frozen peaches and more raspberries. And the automatic grocery list overstated how much rhubarb is required - 5 lbs is plenty.

I thought the crust would be too hard or yucky b/c of the whole wheat, but boy did this turn out great! Everything about it was superb. People I served it to didn't even want ice cream on the side. I used frozen raspberries b/c supermarket was out of fresh ones. It was delightful. (but cooked in 10 min less time than recipe calls for, so monitor it bakes.)
