I'm a 90% vegan. My family is not. I wind up cooking a few dishes so that we all have something to eat. This is dish constitutes part of the 10% of the time I'm NOT vegan. It's amazingly good and my kids loved it too.

I'm so glad I tried this recipe. It was the hit of my party! I cooked the pasta and cut the ingredients the day before. Just before serving dinner I put everything together. I also used parmesan instead of the ricotta salata. Try it!

I tripled this recipe for a family gathering. Everyone liked it, including men, women, and children. I am a harsh critic as well as my husband. I gave it 3 forks only because I rate 4 forks as something I can quit eating. I used pre-"chink" pancetta and I used real ricotta. The recipe went together fast. My "bowl" looked different that the picture due the ricotta, but tasted the same and noone knew the difference--I made tiny balls of cheese so it did look presentable. I wish I would have made a bit more of the viniagrette, pasta soaked it up. It was good the next day and daughter asked to take some home with her.

Fantastic mix of tastes: sweetness of the melon, the crunch of the pancetta the white wine vinegar. Like a chorus of angels! My kids and husband loved it. "Better than restaurant" food. Recipe's like this is why my family does not eat out a lot. The food's amazing at home.

Delish! I used fresh grated parmesan cheese because I couldn't find the ricotta salata and my husband just hates feta. This was easy, yummy and the perfect thing to eat on a hot night. I will most definitely make this a few more times before melon is out of season.

Loved it! Didn't have time to cook up the Pancetta, so I just cut up Prosciutto instead. The Ricotta Salata is a must if you can find it as it adds an incredibly creamy, mild flavor.

Very good. Made the poor-man's version, with turkey bacon and feta instead of pancetta and ricotta salata. It was very good the first day, and different but still very good the second day. Husband has requested repeats.
