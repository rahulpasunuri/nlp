When I made the sauce I thought it was too thin but it was so flavorful that it really worked with the fish. I did stick my fish under the broiler for a minute to crisp the skin. I hate wiggly skin. Next time I may add some corn starch to the sauce to thicken it a little. It is nice to have a less fattening option for a sauce that I love. I think as it is 2 1/2 forks but with one or two modifications it gets a 3.

I would have rated this a zero but since that wasn't an option I had to give it a 1. The fish was so bland and the sauce did not taste good at all. It was almost inedible. Probably in my top ten of worst dinners I've ever made.
