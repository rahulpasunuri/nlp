I LOVE this recipe! When I couldn't find any anise liquer in the house, I used 1 1/2 tbsp anise extract instead ('cause that's all I had) and the recipe turned out perfectly! I also tried the same with almond flavoring and got the same great results! My family and friends like this recipe - the cookies never last long in the house!

I was looking for a lighter cookie--one I remember from my childhood. Followed meticulously, but this recipe yielded a rather heavy flavor and dense cookie. Disappointing.

I have tried several biscotti recipes in the past few years looking for the best and now I found it. These are great! Most biscotti recipes require nuts which I am not a big fan of in a cookie. These cookies are not too soft - just enough so that they do not crumble when you bite into it. A very tasty treat. This is a keeper.
