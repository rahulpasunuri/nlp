I have to agree with others who found this pie overly sweet, despite using more apples than called for - 4 very large ones weighing just over 2 lbs - and tossing them with lemon juice. This filled a 9" deep dish pie plate brimming full. The sugar, ginger snaps, and marmalade all contributed to the sweetness; since I did like the combination of ingredients, I would make this again with probably only 1/4 cup sugar in the filling.

Found this recipe for Scottish Apple Pie and my wife said, "What? Orange Marmalade and raisins in Apple Pie?" Bottom line is that it was one of the very best pies (apple or otherwise) that I've ever eaten. We topped it with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Fantastic!

Delicious and a great twist on a more ordinary pie. I made this with a sweeter crust made with butter, flour and powdered sugar instead of one made with shortening. The apples with marmalade, ginger and orange were a wonderful combination. Kids and husband alike loved it. Making a second time for Thanksgiving dinner.

I always go with what seems right, so I added more apples, used a deep dish pan, added some fresh nutmeg and yes, cinnamon and bought the best marmalade I could find. I left out the orange zest. I have made this over and over again, even as a rustic tart and it is always exceptional. I haven't tried serving with whipped cream but bet that is good. Good quality ice cream is good though. Enjoy, we did!

Not bad, but a very strong orange flavor and very little apple. a bit disappointing.

I can't imagine ever going back to a plain apple pie after tasting this! Plus, it's pretty enough to show off to company.

Very good. This is a recipe where you can toss things in as you feel like it or make little substitutions. I used some home-made gingerbread and a few arrowroot cookies for the crumbs, skipped the orange peel, and used ginger marmalade in place of orange. Chopping the apple finely takes less time than slicing it carefully, I think, and it DOES take less time in the oven. However, the filling was too much - needs a deep-dish pan - and it is a bit dry after baking, might want to add some water or fewer crumbs. Very good cold as well, imo better as the flavours combine overnight.

I made this pie exactly as the recipe stated and it was delicious. Everyone that tried it loved it, even picky eaters. I can't wait to make it again. I made a cream cheese crust, also from this site. I can't wait to make it all again!

Not what I was expecting. It was too sweet, and the flavors didn't seem to blend well. Will try another apple pie recipe next time.

Excellent, the best apple pie I've ever eaten. I skipped the raisins and used raspberry marmalade instead as I didn't have orange, and it was delicious. Next time I might add some cinnamon. Extremely easy to make and a great hit with guests.

I concur with the other reviewers. It's a very nice twist on an old standard. I also did not use raisins. I had some Smuckers All Fruit Marmalade on hand so I used it. It isn't as bitter as some others I've had. Skipped the orange zest too. Terrific!

I've made this pie for four gatherings now - all at the request of my friends!! It's a real hit. (I leave out the raisins, though. Dessert w/raisins?? yeck!)

This was a nice twist on apple pie. My friends really liked it but my children and husband thought it was slightly bitter, probably the marmalade.

I was intrigued by this recipe ever since reading the very different ingredients, esp. since I am always looking ways to use our home-grown Winesap apples. I used 3-1/3 cups (14-1/2 oz. by weight) of apples, after prepping and cubing them. Subbed regular raisins for the golden, McCormick dried orange peel for the fresh, and used 1/2 Tbs. of both sugar and half and half (my heavy cream had gone bad) for brushing the crust at the very end. Since this pie did turn out with a very orangey flavor, I would increase the apples slightly next time. Do serve this with vanilla ice cream. VERY, VERY YUMMY & DIFFERENT.

BEST apple pie I've ever had. I did make a change though- vanilla wafers instead of ginger snaps and I used 1 cup of them. Not a bit runny and not dry either. Next time I will use the ginger snaps. I'm sure it will be even better. I am so pleased with this recipe.

This is the best apple pie we have ever had. We made it with my own tart three-fruit Mom-a-lade (pink grapefruit, lemons, and bitter orange) and it was delicious. A bit runny at first, so I would make it with a lattice top next time, in the hope some of the liquid would cook off.

Fixed the pie for a New Years Day party. It was a tremendous hit. I fixed it again for a club meeting which is also a food competition. It won first place in the dessert category. I love it!

I halved the amount of sugar and we loved this pie. When hot, it reminded me of mince pie, but once it was cold, it was just a delicious fruit pie. A definite repeat family desert.

The combination of Ginger Snaps and raisins make it taste rather like mince meat pie. I will make this again. My DH say the recipe and wanted to make it. He liked it which surprised me since he will not go near minced meat pies.
