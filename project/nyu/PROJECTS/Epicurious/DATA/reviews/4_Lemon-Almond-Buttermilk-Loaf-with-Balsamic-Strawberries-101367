Oh yes! Everybody loves this. Sophisticated, but easy to make and spectacular texture and flavor, especially after soaking the warm cake with the lemon juice/sugar mixture. After making this a bunch of times, I don't bother to measure the lemon zest. I just use the zest of two whole lemons, then juice those and add sugar to taste for the warm cake soak. If you don't want to have to grind the almonds, you can buy almond flour in Trader Joes (near the whole almonds in bags and such. I found that adding a Tbsp or two of finely chopped BASIL to the Balsamic Strawberries is fantastic, especially if you let that sit a bit before serving. A really great dessert. You will not be disappointed.

Sounds great, but before I make it ... Does anyone know if/how it can be frozen? thanks!

I made this last night and served it today. It was a breeze, a simple, homey cake, the best kind of cake for close friends and special (but casual) get-togethers. Lemon is the star here, playful and assertive; the balsamic strawberries are a deeply fruity and caramel background. Pop this cake in the oven before you start making dinner and you've done all the hard work--the balsamic strawberries are a snap, so really all that's left to do is to serve it. It would also be nice to serve this at a brunch or tea. I'd say the danger here is overbaking...luckily, I checked the cake early, and it was done. The tester came out clean but it was still perfectly moist in the center. The lemon glaze helps to moisten the drier outer edges of the cake, and it also gives it a sweet, crusty glaze. Some lightly sweetened whipped cream would be nice with this. I'll probably try that next time.

We made three batches of the loaf cake part of this recipe and baked it in small loaf pans. Perfectly delicious.

This was great - definitely a keeper! I made 1/3 of the recipe in a small loaf pan. I started by cooking for 30 minutes then reduced the heat to 325F and probably cooked it another 10-15 minutes (I lost track of time).

This cake came out great. My roommates and I loved it. I didn't have any almond flour so I replaced it with cake flour and used 1 1/2 tsp each of almond and lemon extract. I also had some heavy cream laying around so I replaced 1/4cp of the buttermilk with that.Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

Absolutely scrumptious. I brought it to work and had several requests for the recipe. The balsamic strawberries added a nice tang to the super-sweet loaf.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some left-over buttermilk. Followed the recipe as writen but only needed to bake the "loaf" for 1 hour. The loaf was light and airy, the strawberries were lovely - I cut them the night before and let them sit in the vinegar to enhance the flavor. This made them a bit soggy, but tasty. My BF loved it, and was shagrin for me to take it to work - where they gobbled it up!

My standby recipe especially when strawberries are in season.They really do add alot to the cake-I usually increase the vinegar/sugar to amount of berries.The glaze is delightful.All around yummy.

This was so yummy. I used the juice from 3 Meyer Lemons (reduced the buttermilk so the liquids would balance out). Also used Almond meal/flour combo instead of almond extract, came out moist and flavorful.

Everyone loved it and I am making it again. I used a mini bundt pan to make them, six to a pan. There was a little batter left over. I did not make the strawberries.

An exceptional loaf in both taste and texture. I did not bother with the strawberries, though I doubled the amount of lemon glaze. It was perfect.

I thought this cake was a lot of work but well worth the effort! Delicious, but like other reviewers have said, don't skip the glaze, it is essential! Because I was taking this cake to my birthing class, I upped the healthy factor a bit by using part whole wheat flour and it worked beautifully. I also felt that the balsamic strawberries (which I adore) didn't go well with this cake. Next time, I will serve the cake plain and save the balsamic strawberries for vanilla ice cream. Got rave reviews nonetheless!

This is delightful. I increased the almond extract to 1/2 tsp. per other reviewer's suggestions. I also used white balsamic vinegar for the berries which may not have added the same depth of flavor as the darker balsamic; nonetheless, they were delicious. One caveat: While the berries and the cake are very good together, the berries overpower the delicate flavors of the cake, especially the almond. Think about it: how could almond stand up to the flavor of balsamic vinegar? It really doesn't. Also, do not skip the glaze - it's essential in my opinion!

Rating: 4
Fabulous! Moist and I love that light sugar crunch from the glaze. I lessened the amount of sugar by 1/4 a cup and the amount of butter as well by 1/4 stick. Next time, though, I would increase the zest, I already used 2 tbsp. but my batter didn't turn out that lemony. My boyfriend thought it was perfect, though, and tasted much better than the Dr. Oetker Zitronenkuchen that he grew up with.

As the standard thing to do seemed to be to bake this in a bundt pan, I followed suite and wasn't disappointed. I also used almond paste (about 4oz) but if you're planning on doing this, make sure the paste isn't dried out: I always prefer almond paste in 8oz cans rather than tubes for this reason. I was initially tempted to add the lemon juice to the cake and skip the glazing step - but was glad I didn't. The sweet-tart punch as you bite into a slice is DEFINITELY worth the effort!

Rating: 4
Outstanding. Next time I will increase the almond extract to 1/2 teas. I baked it in a bundt pan because I didn't have a loaf pan big enough, and it was perfect after 1 hour at 350 degrees. Since I had extra lemon juice, I made more glaze and put some on the cake while still in the pan (see Knoxville), but then turned it out of the pan, poked holes in the top and added more glaze. I don't think you can overdo it. Balsamic strawberries are perfect on this (or can be eaten alone): be sure to use GOOD balsamic vinegar.

Wonderful! I made this cake twice, once a test run on my husband, he loved it and then for a party. A huge success. Thanks for the tips on pan sizes, I used a bundt pan and it worked great. I mis-read the recipe when shopping for ingredients and bought almond paste instead of almonds, used half the tube (about 3 1/2 oz) and it worked great. Used the glazing method from my rum cake, leave it in pan and slowly pour glaze over cake and around sides let it rest 5-10 min and then take it from pan, easier than brushing glaze. Strawberries were wonderful!

Rating: 3
I will definitely make it again. I also found it a bit brown on the bottom. I would probably decrease the time 5 minutes. Lemon glaze really enhances it and it was perfect with the strawberries. I didn't find the Balsamic Strawberries to be anything that outstanding. I might of had too many strawberries for the amount of sugar & balsamic.

devine! very light and fluffy with a great delicate flavor. i might double the almond extract next time. also, came out a bit dark on the bottom, but i think that was just my terrible oven. great even without the strawberries (although they really set it over the top).

Wonderful cake. Was a little suspicious of the balsamic strawberries, but they tasted wonderful-great mix of flavors. Will absolutely make this again!

We all loved this cake! Made it exactly as written, & the only change I would make is to add a slight bit more almond flavoring. I should have read more of the reviews, regarding baking time & temperature though, because the edges were a little too dark. I think it's because I used a non-stick pan (quite dark), & next time I'll lower the temperature, or not bake it as long. Try it...you'll like it!

This bread was possibly the best bread I have ever made...and I have made A LOT of various tea breads in my baking life. I didn't have almond extract so i instead used twice as many ground almonds for extra texture and flavor. I love bursts of lemon flavor, so i also added extra lemon zest. The batter was VERY thick, so i added a bit more buttermilk as well. I baked in three small bread pans (rather than one large) for about an hour and it turned out absolutely perfectly. My freinds also RAVED. i didn't have strawberries either, so i left off the sauce. Don't mean to alter the recipe at all, because I'm SURE just doing exactly what the recipe tells you will be just as fabulous. i plan on making again and again....

This was a delicious and moist pound cake! I made it exactly as stated, including baking it for 1 hr. 25 minutes, and it came out fine. However, this was after I had tried the recipe the night before, baking it for only 65 minutes. The dark brown crust had me fooled, and so I took it out too early. What a mistake. The inside collapsed ! I made the balsamic strawberries as well and added some raspberries.

Wonderful!! Served it at a brunch with strawberries and mascarpone whipped cream, a smash sensation. Baked well in a bundt pan.

I put the batter in 4 mini bundt pans and they turned out nicely. Because I was concerned that they might be dry after reading the other reviews, I poked holes in the cakes and put a layer of glazed before I took them out of the pan. After inverting them I repeated the process on the top of the cakes. The flavor was fabulous and I wouldn't change a thing with the ingredients. The combination of lemon and almond flavor was lucious. I only added half the balsamic vinegar to the strawberries and they were perfect. Any more would have overpowered the delightful cake.

Excellent recipe. After reading the other reviews I made this in a bundt pan. It only took an hour to cook. It turned out very moist and flavorful. It didn't serve it with the strawberries my picky husband doesn't like strawberries. My skeptical husband loved this cake. I made it last night and only half of it is left. Great recipe. Yummy!

Very moist and delicious. I added extra zest and (accidentally) put the 5 tbsp of lemon juice into the batter instead of saving it for the "glaze"...made it a little tart, but it still turned out great! Good way to get rid of extra buttermilk too...

We loved the pound cake! The lemon gave it an great fresh-and-not-too-sweet favor. The almonds added a great subtle flavor and texture. I accidently forgot to add in the almond extract to the batter, so I put a tiny bit in the glaze and that worked fine. I listened to the reviews warning about dryness and spooned glaze over four sides, and really let it sink it. It was great, not dry at all. The sugar even added a tiny crunch to the top. The cake puffed up much more than I expected (and consequently spilled all over the oven floor). I really wasn't crazy about the strawberries, though, and I had really been looking forward to them. I might try them one more time with a really good balsamic, or less of it, but I and my husband found the vinegar way too strong for such a nice, mellow dessert. Otherwise I'd just sprinkle them with sugar and let them get nice and syrupy. But, overall, a great recipe.

Rating: 2
This was ok. My syrup didn't sink very far into the cake, so the top third was great, the bottom 2/3, somewhat dry. I started checking it for doneness around 1 hr and every 5 min after, but still took the full time to be done. I got compliments, but I was a little disappointed. Not very lemony except for the part touched by the glaze/syrup. Did not make the strawberries due to logistical problem with transport, etc. Maybe that's why I was disappointed. Won't make again.

I made this in when I had some buttermilk to use up before it went bad. I think it turned out great. It was very moist and the flavor was very delicate. It yielded way to much batter for one loaf pan though, I bet a bundt pan would hold it all perfectly. The only change I made was to use lemon & grapefruit juice in the glaze (my neighbors have a tree) and I loved the results.

I made this recipe for Easter and my husband absolutely loved it. It was quite easy to make and turned out very moist and flavorful. I followed the recipe as written but did use a little extra lemon zest. Will be making it again today for a few friends that are coming over for dinner.

I really liked the flavor of this recipe, but I think I may have over-baked it even though I only baked it for an hour and ten minutes. I only have an 8 inch loaf pan, so I used it, filling it up as much as I could. I figured it might take less time, so originally I only baked it for an hour, but it didn't seem done as the center was not at all solid. It browned VERY quickly. It ended up rather dry--the glaze helped, but only on the top portion of the loaf. I want to try again because it tasted divine. Any suggestions?

Absolutely fantastic!! I followed a reader's suggestion to increase the almond extract to 1/2 tsp. and I also used brown sugar for the strawberries, along with Fig Balsamic Vinegar.

This bread was wonderful. A huge hit at work. Didn't make the strawberries but will this summer when they're in season. I added an extra tbs. of lemon peel and increased the almond extract to 1/2t. Do add the glaze. It makes the bread very moist and lemony!!!!

If you enjoy the refreshing tartness of lemons, this loaf is perfect! It is an easy, do ahead dessert with the perfect amount of sweet and sour.

WOW! This is absolutely delicious. I followed everyone's advice and watched the cooking time carefully, and cooked it at a bit lower temp. Don't skip the lemon/sugar glaze..it's wonderful, and would be great on other sorts of pound cakes or bundt cakes. The balsamic strawberries are a great counterbalance to the sweetness of the pound cake, but the pound cake is certainly delicious enough to stand on its own.

I've served this cake a number of times, and everyone has loved it. It's particularly good for picnics and other outdoor meals, and seems to be just as good if prepared a day in advance and wrapped in foil until serving time. The balsamic strawberries were a revelation ... even typically watery grocery store berries are much improved by the addition of the vinegar.

This is a great lemon-pound cake. I've made it 5 times now. I divide the batter between two loaf pans, so I get to short loafs instead. This helps me avoid the over-cooked edges. Also, this way I get to give one away and keep one to eat!

I took this to a friends house for dessert and it was a hit! Everyone loved it and the flavor was wonderful. I, too, had problems with the cooking time. I checked it 5 minutes early and the outside was cracked and very dark brown but the center was quite wet so I had to continue cooking it. In the end it was a little dry and tough for my tastes. I will try to cook it at a lower temp next time so the outside doesn't harden so much. Still, my friend begged for the recipe.

Made it in a bundt pan, very pretty and festive with garnish of mint & sliced lemons. A guest at the dinner party doesn't like cake, and she enjoyed it.
