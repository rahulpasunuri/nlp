Not very scone-like in texture, but delicious.

This recipe is so simple and the results so rewarding! These scones were a huge hit and I intend to keep them in my regular repitoire.

These scones were delicious! Everyone loved the flavors. I've had several requests to make them again. They were very easy to make as well, perfect in the summer or the winter.

Awful. I had to throw them out.

Really easy and good flavor. My only problem was that the scones went flat after they cooled - they weren't really great as leftovers. I might boost the self-rising flour with a little extra baking powder next time.

DELICIOUS! It is important to use sharp cheddar, it gives the scones an added zing. I made the scones for brunch and served them w/ red pepper jelly and spicy scrambled eggs, they were a huge hit! I used the left over scones to serve with chili... they were perfect! So easy to make. Thank you!

Turned out well and tasted alright, but really not worth the effort.
