added all the chicken and 2 extra 'ribs' of celery. had to use half of veg broth, ran out of chick broth. had to cook at least 2 hrs longer. awesome though, with whole grain bread and butter. a bit light on salt, but maybe that's good. used long grain brown organic rice. excellent. I would TOTALLY make this MY chicken soup. really enjoyed it.

ok here is my confession. Homemade chicken soup was staple at my house growing up. A big pot simmering on the stove brings a smile on my face and I've never done chicken soup well despite the fact that I'm a pretty good cook. This recipe was AWESOME and truth be told better than mom's. I'll definitely make it again. Do we need to tell our guests that it was made with rotisserie? sorry mom...

This is my grandson's favorite dish, but he has Diabetes Type 1. Does anyone know the nutrional information?

This was absolutely delicious, but the key is the chicken and chicken broth/stock that you use. When we made this, we used homemade stock from the carcass of bbq-smoked chicken. We were very happy with the result. Changes: * homemade stock + bbq-smoked chicken * no parsley * 2 bay leaves * 2 cloves of minced garlic * diced onion, cooked down with carrots, garlic, and celery before adding to the stock

This recipe is good if you have a cold. Not too much flavor and it took a lot longer to make than I read.

This is an easy and flavorful soup, although the store-bought chicken does add quite a bit of salt. Very low calorie and filling. I triple the carrots, add frozen petite peas, and use brown rice. I have not had a problem with the rice soaking up the broth overnight.

I substituted the carcass of a chicken that I had baked in an herb butter for the rotisserie chicken that this recipe specifies and ended up with more herb flavor than I would have liked. Other than that, which was clearly my own fault, I thought that there was a bit too much rice in this. I would definitely make this simple soup again but with a few minor tweaks.

Very good "flu food." We made it with homemade chicken broth, shredded meat from half the carcass, and a wild rice blend for rice.

Made this soup last night from a chicken carcass I needed to use up. Definetely our new fave! I made it late at night, hoping to eat it tonight for dinner. The consistency was good last night, but I found the rice had soaked up a lot of the broth overnight. I did use brown rice. Tossed in 4 cloves of garlic as suggested. Our new favorite soup!

Sweetheart and I are both sick, and I was craving a healthy, hearty, budget-friendly soup. I bought my chicken and whatever veggies looked tasty at Whole Foods including: zucchini, squash, sweet potato, potato, cauliflower, broccoli, leeks, garlic, green beans, carrots, celery, and a jalapeno. When simmering the broth, I added some garlic and a bunch of fresh organic poultry herbs. I used a box mix of wild rice (with seasonings) and low sodium chicken broth (365). Delicious, and even better the 2nd day.

This chicken soup recipe is a staple in my house. I've tweaked it a bit and the results are fantastic. To the simmering broth, I add 1 parsnip and celery root and I increase the amount of parsley, carrots, and celery found in the original recipe. I find this makes for a more complex broth. I also use 12 cups rather than 10 cups of broth. The rice tends to soak up the liquid. Sometimes, instead of rice, I use wide egg noodles.

This is a great soup for when you want something basic, yet comforting and delicious. My only suggestion is to add less rice or more broth as the rice absorbed much of the broth and made the soup a little thicker than I'd like. My husband and four year-old both loved it! Great recipe.

Exceptional because it was easy, inexpensive and delicious. I made a larger quantity for a group of 50 children and parents. It was delicious, everyone loved it. Perfect on a cold winter's night.

very simple to make and instead of a rotisserie chicken i used a whole, baby chicken. minimized the broth. i make it all the time and everytime, everyone loves it.

While this recipe is marked "gluten-free", many store bought rotisserie chickens contain gluten. Be aware of the ingredients.

Not bad, but why not make the real thing? With only a small amount of added effort, you'll enjoy a far, far superior broth. Whichever way you go, forget the rice and parsely. Instead, add a few leek slices, three or four sliced garlic cloves, some baby bok choy, 15 or 20 pelmeny, if available, and a dash of cayenne pepper to the final product. That makes a real soup out of it.

Today I'm making this soup for the second time. I like the use of the rotisserie chicken...it's convenient. I did add garlic too, since I add garlic to everything, and it was great.

just a note to people who want to try this recipe. i worked in a butcher shop that made rotiserie chickens, and the amount of salt used to season them is astronomical! i know that the broth called for in this recipe is low sodium, but unless you want to risk making a soup too salty to eat, taste the chicken skin before you add it. and if by chance it is too salty in the end, try adding a potatoe for 1/2 hr then removing it, it will absorb some of the salt.

Hey fakebunny. Lighten up. The Oklahoma cook wasn't criticizing, just recommending. His/her idea about the chicken skin has merit. The one who's too critical is in the mirror. Take a look.

Just a thought 44dotty44........read the recipe and you'll see it it tells you to add the skin and bones. Read it through before you criticize.

Just a thought....when you use meat from a rotiserrie chicken, remove the meat and add the carcass and skin to the broth. It add a nice color and a depth of flavor to the stock.
