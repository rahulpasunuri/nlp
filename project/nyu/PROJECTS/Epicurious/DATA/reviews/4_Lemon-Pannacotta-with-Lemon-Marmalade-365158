Tasty, but a little complicated to make.

So tasty...a perfect ending to a spicy meal. I did rush the marmalade a bit, I should have cooked it a little bit longer. Much better than a chocolate dessert. Having an Italian themed party next month and planning to serve little shot glasses of this and also tiramisu. Yum!

This was incredibly delicious. It's a bit of work but worth it. The marmalade is delicious, it took longer than the recipe said and it made a LOT. I doubled the recipe and unfortunately also doubled the marmalade, which was unnecessary. I have a LOT leftover. I topped the pannacotta with the marmalade and chopped pistachios and it was awesome.

I'm making this again this weekend for the umpteenth time. First, it has two very important advantages. It is not terribly time-consuming to make and it is possible to make it at way ahead of serving. Second, it is light and the marmelade is terrific -- sweet and tart. The pannacotta comes easily out of the ramekins, holds its shape and makes a beautiful presentation.

Oh my! I used meyer lemon & the flavour is incredible but have also made it with regular lemon & it was delicious. With the marmalade it's incredible. My family & guests have raved about it. This recipe is amazing - definitely a keeper!

Delicious! Loved the flavors. The marmalade was amazing. Didn't want to purchase the vanilla bean - so I just used some vanilla extract.

Wonderful. Definitely take the time to make the marmalade - it really makes this amazing.

Easy. I used 1 cup of whipping cream and one cup of half and half, then just plain skim milk when whole milk was called for. The lemon garnish was a big plus--gave distinctive added flavor and great for the appearance. I plan to repeat for guests this weekend. I am still getting compliments on my last attempt. Jeanne

Made panna cotta for the first time with this recipe for my husbands birthday. It was fantastic. Big hit! I halved the recipe since there are only two of us and it turned out perfectly and deliciously. Can't wait to make again for company.

Did the first attempt, it was simple and easy to make, although i supposed to use the heavy cream instead of whipped cream (bought the wrong type), but still, the taste, texture of the pannacotta is good!! it really goes with the lemon marmalade!

Wonderful. Light, clean tasting and the marmalade was GREAT! Highly recommend it.

This was very good. The only change I made was to use 1% milk instead of whole milk, and it was fine. The marmalade is both easy and essential; the tartness and chewy texture is a very nice offset to the creamy panna cotta.

This was my first attempt at making pannacota, and I am so in love with it. I didn't do the marmalade because I was feeling lazy, but the pannacotta itself is just divine! So smooth and creamy, and super easy to make. I cheated and used vanilla extract instead of the real vanilla bean -- but next time I'll try that. I'm sure it's amazing.
