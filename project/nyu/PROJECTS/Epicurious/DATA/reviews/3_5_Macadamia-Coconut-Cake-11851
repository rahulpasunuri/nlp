Thank you for this recipe. The filling and the honey covered macadamia nuts make this recipe exceptional.

I made this recipe for a cooking class in which we sell to customers like in a restaurant. It was a huge hit. I did not, however, use the frosting as it came out more like a glaze. I also left bigger chunks of macadamia nuts so that you could really feel the contrasting textures.

Just finished baking the cake -- it didn't bake up very high, so I cannot imagine cutting it into 3 pieces. I will cut it in half. I didn't mind the extra steps, but I'm bummed that it came out so flat. I'm bringing it to a party tomorrow, so the filling and frosting better make up for the sub-par cake!

I only made the creme. Very delicious on a layer cake. It's great instead of a heavy/greasy cake filling!

I made this with a white cake mix and would actually give it 2 1/2 forks that way. Made as written it should probably be a 3. It is time consuming but easy. It is beautiful to look at. The nuts got soft to the bite, probably because i assembled it ~ 6hrs before serving.

Judging by the other reviews I must have done something really wrong, because I thought that it was really difficult and not too tasty.

I made this for Christmas last year and it was WODERFUL! Next time I may substite pre-baked angel food cake and cheat a little because the whole process is very lengthy. The filling is the best part, absolutely decadent.

This cake was a real trial to make. If I made it again, I would make 2 9" cakes instead of 1, and cut each in half instead of in threes(the filling and frosting recipes yielded enough for 2 cakes, I had tons of each leftover). I would make a simple white cake instead of this complicated cake base; the actual cake didn't taste good enough to warrant the extra steps. The frosting was fairly easy, and good--but I would use simple, chilled whipped cream next time. The real treat was the filling--I would recommend using this filling on any old white or chocolate cake (even from a mix)! It would be a great way to make a fast-but-fancy treat!

This is a wonderful cake! It is very time consuming and will wreck your kitchen QUICK. Due to the price of macadamia nuts, I used pecans instead and they worked well. Make this for a special event or person.

I agree that this cake takes time to prepare, but it is soooo good!

This cake was quite good. Given the great amount of time it took to make, I hoped it would be!
