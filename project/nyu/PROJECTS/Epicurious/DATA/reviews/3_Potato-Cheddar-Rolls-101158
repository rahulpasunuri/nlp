Raw potato? Garlic powder? I was sure that these rolls were going to be a disaster. But I sure am glad I made them as they were the hit of yesterday's buffet. I should have known since mashed potato or potato water is often added to doughs to make a lovely, soft bread. Rather than baking the rolls together in one pan, I spread them out over two sheets so they were "individual". But otherwise, I followed the recipe as written (with the exception that I used instant rise yeast). Even though you see shards of shredded raw potato in the dough, these "disappear" once the rolls are baked. And don't skimp on the kneading - it just makes for a better crumb.

Omit the garlic and use 1-2 tsp Tabasco, put all the cheese into the bread, use water and dried milk and you have fantastic bread. Make an impressive single loaf in a 12 inch pizza pan. It will require longer cooking. I turn the oven to 350 after the 40 minutes at 375, turn the loaf out of the pan and cook for another 10-20 minutes. Everyone loves this. Great toast, too.

The rolls were a little heavy and dense. I substituted fresh milk and garlic. The flavor was good, but I probably won't make them again.

Such an odd recipe (RAW potatoes? THREE CUPS of cheese?) but made it exactly as given and the rolls were delicious. The dough takes a while to come together as you knead, but the effort was worth it, and I will definitely make them again.
