This was delicious. I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted regular paprika and used red pepper flakes and dry oregano. I had no sherry. I also made it in a wok. Delicious! My family really enjoyed it- very tasty and I will definitely try it again like this for a fast dinner and also in the oven with the correct ingredients to see how that works out!

This was great! All the flavors combined perfectly. Using smoked paprika added a nice depth. I've also made this dish substituting boneless chicken thighs for shrimp, which was also very good.

I fell in love with smoked paprika on a visit to Spain. This is a great recipe to use it in. I make it often as a simple stir fry.

The flavors of this dish are excellent, but I recommend preheating the baking pans before adding the shrimp, otherwise, the shrimp steam rather than roast (no matter how much you dry them off) and then are no browned bits, which is crtical to the sauce. If you heat the pans, add the minced garlic when you add the oregano or it will burn if left in the whole time. Next time around, I am going to try a cast iron skillet preheated in the oven. Great flavors, but the technique needs work.

Wanting to save some time standing on a broken ankle, I took the recipe's suggestion to use frozen shrimp, as our specialty market sells very good frozen shrimp... But this is NOT for this recipe, if you want roasting rather than stewing! What "browned bits"? The shrimp are edible, but I would assume they come out much better if you use fresh shrimp or prawns.

I used Hungarian paprika, otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and served it over bulgur for dinner. Delicious!

This is so quick and so good. I made it even easier by using roasted red peppers instead of fresh, and just putting everything, including the Sherry, into the pan all at once. Ten minutes in the oven and done (turning once after 5 minutes). Cold leftovers are even better the next day.

This was very good! I don't like to measure much, so I had more garlic. I also used plain paprika bacause that is what I had on hand. One nice change that I made was I made a rue with flour to thicken the sauce when the sherry was added at the end. I then served it over fettuchine. Delicious!

This is a fun and easy receipe...key ingredient is the quality of the smoked paprika..the hotter the better. After bringing this for Thanksgiving last year for the appetizer buffet had good feedback and several requests for the receipe which is always a good sign !

This recipe is quick and fabulous. And since smoked paprika is my new best friend, it has become a very popular disk in my household. Enjoy!

This recipe is definitely something to try! Extremely simple and fabulous. The recipe states to initially roast for 10 minutes. I decreased the time only long enough to get an opaque color to the shrimp added the oregano, turned, and resumed cooking for a few minutes longer. This kept the shrimp from overcooking (the shrimp retains heat and keeps cooking after removing from the pan). Returned pan and drippings into the oven to caramelize and proceeded with the rest of the recipe. Couldnt find the smoke Paprika at 4 locations (Middle Eastern or Bristol Farms). It was a surprise to find smoke paprika at Costo. The only thing I would do differently is perhaps providing additional color (yellow bell peppers) and additional oregano (to the recipe and for garnish).

My hustand teases me because this is my favorite shrimp recipe ... so when I make it, I'm making it for me (he likes it too). Don't change a thing. It's tasty just as the recipe is written. YUM!

This recipe was failry easy to make and very tasty. Smoked paprika is a bit hard to find but worth the trouble : )

I made this with the following changes. I couldn't afford the large shrimp, so I made it with smaller shrimp, tails off (no tails made it fork friendly). I cut the peppers a little smaller so the cooking times would be more in relationship to the size of the shrimp. I would cut the cayenne in half. We decided we would like it with double the sherry (or maybe add a little chicken broth), not cooked down as much and served over rice or tossed with a little pasta as a main course. Even without pasta or rice, I would make a little more sauce then have some great bread with it to soak up the sauce. The smoked paprika is worth the effort to find. (See the Spanish Table on the internet.) The depth of flavor was excellent.

I used catfish instead of shrimp, because that's what I had. I increased cooking time and threw in some onions. Delicious dish! I have a feeling that the catfish was an even better choice than shrimp!

Very good. Served it with green rice and steamed asparagus. Loved the combination of flavours. Didn't change a thing with the recipe and won't next time, don't see any room for improvement in an excellent recipe.

Wonderful. Maybe too spicy for some, but that can be fixed by decreasing the cayenne. As a main course, this recipe would feed 6 generously. The sweetness of the peppers with the savory shrimp is perfect. With a Spanish dry rose wine, this made an easy, though special, dinner. As part of a tapas menu, it's a standout.

Wow! I actually was looking for a Tequila Shrimp recipe and this one looked interesting as I just purchased smoked paprika on line at laespanolemeats.com so I thought it sounded good. First of all I've not made it yet but plan to this weekend. Second of all I don't believe I've ever read more immature, self absorbed ratings in my life! Get another hobby ladies (term loosely used).

Unlike the preceding St. Paul reviewer, we think this is a very special way to serve zucchini. Fast and easy to prepare, great taste. We'll have this again often, in and our of our zucchini-growing season

Great dish for a buffet! Didn't have smoked paprika so used regular. Very tasty, nice presentation.

Cooking for two, I used one pound of shrimp and one-third of all of the other ingredients. This was easy and very good. Like the Cook from Arizona on 6/28/04, smoked paprika is my new best friend. I did think that at the end the shrimp could have used a bit more acid, like some lemon or lime juice.

What happened? There was an entire weekend's worth of political snarkery here. Must have been deleted by the webmaster. What's the matter? You think we gourmands can't handle a little lively discussion outside of the confines of the kitchen?

I made this recipe for friends two nights ago and we all oved it, even my husband who was quite suspicious of a baked shrimp dish that is not stuffed! I did not have smoked paprika so I used regular paprika and about 1/2 tsp more cayenne than the recipe calls for. I also had no fresh oregano, but did have fresh basil so I used that instead. So I know I made a couple of alterations but it really was outstanding.

Instead of the oven, I made this in a fine-meshed grilling basket, adding oak and hickory chips to the fire. The smoking flavor really added to the spicy flavors of the dish.

I loved this but I did start the shrimp and peppers on the grill for the initial cooking along with thick sliced vidallia onions then finished it on the stove as directed. I can't resist...frozen shrimp contain a preservative called sodium bisulfite. You can taste it and soaking (I'm out of the marinate or marinade debate) them in salt water brine or better yet, buttermilk for several hours removes the flavor of the preservative....There's my two cents.

This sounds like it would be a good tapa dish...Since smoked paprika is my new best friend, I'll try anything that calls for it!

Funny how people are sayimg that if you marinade shrimp theres precaution for food born illness. Does the same go for chicken and beef and pork? Hum.

Rating: 0
hey you guys, marinade is a noun (a thing) and marinate is a verb (an action), so you marinate something in a marinade. Haven't tried the recipe yet, but had to respond to some of the comments.

Ooo la la. Thanks for the laughs. I only checked this link from Yahoo to see what bastardization was being offered re: shrimp. (btw, the suggestion of using the frozen ones is frightening. They are precooked and not fit for the cat.) If you should be so fortunate as to get fresh, head-on shrimp, prepare them that way. As for the debate on marinade/marinate, it's a French vs. Italian thing, all seeming to be derived from the Latin marinus. Both are quite proper. My favorite is marination(n.). If you really want shrimp that TASTE GOOD, I suggest checking gumbopages.com or labelle.com for the barbeque shrimp recipies. In closing, regardless of your food preparation skills, being in a snit can't be good for digestion. Bon Appetit!

It's quite a tasty dish and really ready in a jiffy... and to add my 2 cents to the controversy, marinading is actually the proper term as the root word is French and is marinade, marinating is a bastardization of the word, you can save raw shrimp in the fridge even 24 hours or more if you feel like it, a marinade is an aromatic liquid used to soak food to impart flavor, it's not a salad dressing acidic liquid is not required in a "proper" marinade, that would be a gastrique.

YOU CAN TOO LEAVE SHRIMP IN THE FRIDGE CHILLED FOR 8 HOURS! SINCE WHEN DOES IT HAVE TO BE FROZEN IMMED? YOU CAN PREPARE CERTAIN DISHES SUCH AS CEVICHE IN THE FRIDGE. LAST BUT NOT LEAST...IM GLAD WE ARE ALL SPELLING PROS! I TYPED ALL IN CAPS...HOPE THIS PISSES YOU OFF TOO. ITS PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT THEY MADE WRINKLE CREAM FOR. SMILE...AND RELAX.

Fitst of all, there is no such word as "marinading." Also, in order to have a true marinade, one needs something acidic which this doesn't. It is commom knowledge that any seafood tastes fresher when packed on ice--not to mention the fear of food born illness. But I loved the recipe!

This was a very good dish. I marinated the shrimp in a ziploc bag and turned them over every so often. We will make this again. My husband really enjoyed them.

Re: objection to marinating shrimp in fridge: you can so leave shrimp in the fridge. i've done it many, many times. where did you get that advice? what about ceviche and the preservation effects of marinading?

cooking instructions state that dish may be covered and chilled (uncooked) up to eight hours. No way!! Shrimp should either be stored frozen or on ice. Shrimp should never be just covered and chilled
