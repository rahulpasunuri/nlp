Excellent combo of ingredients. The bacon is a pleasant surprise! Don't overcook the tomatoes and add more greens than you think necessary.

This was good but not much of a wow factor. I did have too much liquid from the tomatoes and I only had regular bread crumbs on hand. Also no lemons so I used some lemon juice which i know isn't as sharp. It good and I enjoyed it but I don't see any reason to do it again. There are lots of other recipes out there I want to try!

This came out delicious though I made it with a few small changes. I didn't use any cumin seeds and had no way to zest the lemon peel so just left those items out. Also I didn't toss the greens in the frying pan so they'd be crisp and not so wilted. As a result it was a great salad with the crispy chicken on top of it and I will definitely be making it again that way.

This was really good, and very easy. I didn't have panko so substituted with cornflakes, and it was still good.

I thought it was just okay. Next time I would discard the tomato seeds prior to chopping b/c they made the sauce too liquidy for my taste.

I thought this sounded great, but after only a minutes, the greens were wilted to the point of being slimy. If I ever made it again (which I probably won't), I would slice the chicken and place it over cold greens and tomatoes tossed with the bacon and vinegar.

This dish was just eh in my opinion. It had great elements and I was really excited about it but the end result just wasn't that great to me. There are so many other great recipes out there, this one wont be repeated in our house.

This was really good. I would definitely make it again! I used balsamic instead of the red wine vinegar, but i dont think either would be necessary.

I made this for the first time last night and followed the recipe except for subbing baby spinach. Tonight I need something quick for myself and had left over chicken. This time I added a sliced banana pepper to the bacon when it was about half done. I did everything else the same but added some diced avocado at the very end. It was great! I love the little extra spice of the pepper. This was terrific as written but has lots of possibilities for variations.

I cook a LOT and love trying new things. We eat a lot of chicken (health) and frankly, we get a little bored. This is TOTALLY different. My husband said it is hands down the best chicken entree I have ever made. The cumin seeds and the rosemary mayo sound a little off the BLT theme, but they add a nice complexity to the dish. I made the chicken a little differently, using the breading technique from "Cooks Country" magazine (added lemon zest, S&P to panko too). Can't wait to make this one again!

Delicious and delightfully simple. I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting grape tomatoes.

This recipe was delicious, I would give it 3 forks for taste, but it gets 4 forks for the ease of making it. The whole dinner was made and on the table in under 30 minutes. The cumin added such an interesting depth to the salad part. We were out of red wine vinegar so we used balsamic, which was still great. And we used cherry tomatoes because of the current issues with tomatoes in the country. It makes a simple, all-in- one weeknight dinner. Would definitely make it again!

This was easy to make, and everyone in the family liked it well enough that I am making it again tonight. A keeper.

Oops, don't make the mistake I did. I used arugula and endive for the greens. Nice raw, but in this wilted prep, their bitterness completely ruined the salad. The chicken and mayo was nice, taking a cue from some of the other reviewers' suggestions. I cut the breast-halves in half and lightly pounded them to make cutlets (our grocery store sells gigantic Carol Doda-sized chicken breasts). Coat in flour, then beaten egg, then the panko, and let rest a few minutes before sauteeing. Add some lemon juice and hot pepper flakes to the mayo---but if you are using Hellman's/Best Foods, no added salt should be needed, even for salt hounds like me.

I (and my wife) really loved this recipe. I followed it almost exactly as written (I had some baby arugula in my 'fridge and some cherry tomatoes on my counter, so I used them instead of the baby mixed greens and plum tomatoes) and thought the dish was excellent. I'm surprised by "Decatur's" review. Although I think that the chicken, by itself, may have been bland, I found that eating it with the blt components and the mayonnaise made for many very flavorful bites. And my chicken was nicely browned on both sides.

I made this today, replacing mayonnaise with plain yogurt, and it was very good. The recipe didn't specify what kind of panko to use, but I used the soft variant, and it worked very well.

I enjoyed this dish. I felt the mayo needed a bit more acidity and heat, so I added lemon juice and a dash of cayenne pepper. I took the other reviewer's advice, and breaded the chicken tenderloins using eggs. I had baby spinach on hand, and thought the side salad was nice. I like the idea of this dish, however the recipe does need a bit of tweaking.

I found this recipe to be horrible. The chicken was bland and the panko ended up burning in places. I would not make the chicken part of this dish again. The side dish was good, cumin seed was a nice addition.

This was really good. I used "thin chicken" and dipped it in flour and egg before the panko for a really crisp crust. I used a combo of arugula and baby spinach instead of the lettuce and I added lemon juice and hot pepper sauce to the mayo - it seemed kind of bland. I would definitely make this again!
