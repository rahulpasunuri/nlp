Mouth is watering, cannot wait to be at home to bake it. I have made this cheesecake recipe and it was also lovely http://imunchie.com/tasty-meals/munchies/chocolate-and-peanut-butter-cheesecake

Despite longer cooking time, middle of brownies still mushy... They taste good, but have an off consistency. I think given all the steps to making these, they would have come out better.

These brownies were fine - not by any means the best thing I've cooked, but not terrible. They were a bit dry and didnt have any stand-out flavors. I will probably just throw away the leftovers, and won't make these again. If you are looking for a brownie recipe you can find much better.

I thought this was quite good! I did do things a bit differently though. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9*13, which I wouldn't do again. The brownies were crazy thick and took forever too cook. So when doubling in the future, I will bake them in two 9*9 pans. Also after reading the reviews I added a bit more (about a quarter of a cup) peanut butter. All in all they were really yummy. Just be sure not to bake them in a 9*13 when doubling.

This was good, I think I over-baked mine a bit. I agree that a stronger peanut butter taste would be fantastic. Overall, a nice change from a plain brownie or cheesecake square.

Very good, and also very rich. Brownie layer was more fudge-like than cake like. I ended up having to cut the pieces smaller because it was so rich. You taste more cheesecake than peanut butter in top layer; I guess I expected it to be more like reeses peanut butter cups meets brownie - it's not. But still good.

The only change I made was to double the amount of peanut butter, which definitely added flavor but also left the cheesecake layer with a rather sticky texture. The brownie layer also was rather wet, which wasn't a bad thing, but not quite as much brownie as chocolate tart. I would make this again as my family liked it but would probably not go as far as doubling the peanut better and maybe would add a bit more cream cheese for a bit of lightness.

Loved this recipe. The only change we would make, more driven by our personal preferences than any fault in the recipe, I would increase the brownie layer by 1/2 and increase the amount of peanut butter in the cheesecake layers...so it has a stronger peanut butter taste

These were good after chilling for one hour and excellent after sitting in the fridge overnight. The peanut butter flavor was less than I had expected but I was still very pleased with this. Very pretty as well!
