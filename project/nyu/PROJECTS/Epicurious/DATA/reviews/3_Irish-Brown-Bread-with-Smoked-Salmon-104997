Brown bread does NOT have caraway seeds it it so do yourself a favor and don't ruin all that expensive salmon and nice butter with the caraway. And use some nice kerrygod butter. When will gourmet learn! Traditional irish brown bread NEVER EVER NEVER EVER has caraway. Or raisins for that matter!

This did not turn out well for me. It was not worth the effort or the ingredients.

I love this bread--it's easy to make and tastes just like the bread in Ireland. I leave out the caraway, and don't usually serve it with salmon, but the one time I did I entered it in the office cooking contest and won!

I've made this bread many times. It has a great texture and it's so easy to make. It's good wih dinner and leftover toasted for breakfast or lunch.

The bread was good- pretty standard for the brown bread recipes I have made. Can't speak to the smoked salmon part, since I don't eat fish, but my husband said it was "ok"

Lovely, perfect brown bread. Great with the salmon and chives and butter, and great, too, with butter and Irish whiskey orange marmalade!

This bread is wonderful: all fibrey-tasting and really easy to make. I bake it regularly, since I prefer it to any brown bread I can buy, even here in Ireland. I always end up cutting off the end and eating it as soon as it comes out of the oven because I can't wait for it to cool. Don't be put off by the negative reviews, maybe this dense and moist bread wasn't to their taste but it might be to yours.

Made this for our dinner club and we all enjoyed. It was easy and looked really nice on the platter.

Just reading review from Jan '04. Don't give up on soda bread! The one you want is "Brown Soda Bread".Listed here from Bon Appetit May '96.

This recipe, as written, is not worth the ingredients or the effort it calls for but might be okay after some serious tinkering. I've been baking bread for 25 years, but had never tried a soda bread until this one. I hoped that I'd found a shortcut to producing the kind of rustic wheaty bread that our whole family loves but instead ended up with something that looked and tasted like the face of Half Dome. Although it was fun to knead for only one minute and to bake immediately, the result illustrated why most breadmakers prefer yeast. My bread had a nasty sawdust flavor and was much too salty. In addition, I heartily agree with the prior reviewer who thought that sweetening was needed to tame the graininess and add some depth. She suggested molasses, but something even sweeter (at least 3 Tbsp. of honey or a combination of honey and sugar in the same amount) might help more. To lighten the rocklike texture, I'd also reduce the amount of both the wheat germ and whole wheat flour and substitute all-purpose or unbleached white bread flour. Finally, I would bake this for less time than the recipe calls for and at a lower temperature (350-375 degrees). Baking at 400 degrees for 40 minutes, as the recipe instructs, gave me an almost impenetrable top crust and an intermittently scorched bottom one, even though my oven is normally reliable and I used an extremely heavy-duty professional baking sheet.

I just made the bread from this recipe. My husband I and I fell in love with all the hearty brown breads while traveling in Ireland, and I wanted to try to recreate them. I was hoping this would compare. It was tasty, but it was missing something. I am not a big fan of caraway seeds to begin with, so I should have left those out. Also, maybe a little sugar, or molasses would have helped. But it smelled heavenly baking, and tasted great smeared with honey butter! Yum!

This was a great recipe, though I think next time I would add some cucumbers to the canapes. I used the left over Bread for BROWN BREAD ICECREAM also on this site. They were both wonderful.

I love this recipe because it's easy, foolproof (once I even turned the oven off by mistake and the bread still responded beautifully to a "second" baking), delicious and very wholesome. I would not leave the caraway seeds out!

Served this at an afternoon tea for 40 people; many asked for the recipe. Let the finished loaf sit overnight - slices thinly and neatly the next day. I left out the caraway seeds.

I have had the opportunity to eat many Irish breakfasts, and have never found an American recipe for brown bread that is closer to the original. It is easy to make and delicious. We skip the salmon and eat it with honey or preserves.
