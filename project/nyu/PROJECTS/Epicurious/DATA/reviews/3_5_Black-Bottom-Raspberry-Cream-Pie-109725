The cookie crust didn't turn out so great and when I served it the pudding and whipped cream mixed together and didn't look very appetizing. I had leftovers of everything, so I ended up putting pudding, whipped cream, raspberries in a desert glass with cookie bits on top. Much better this way! Tastes delicious either way though!

I made this for a fourth of July party. I didn't bake the crust and used a 9x9 pyrex since I didn't have a pie tin. The pudding part was good and would be good on its own. The whipped cream wasn't sweet enough. The pie mostly set but was never firm enough to really be considered a slice of pie (even though I chilled it for twice the recommended time). It was really hard to get out of the pyrex because the crust was hard and the pudding so soft. First Piece ended up a mess but after that they looked a little better. Everyone at the party thought it tasted great but I wish the presentation was a bit neater. I think I will make this in individual dishes from now on but will definitely make again.

Delicious. Everyone from my husband to my five-year-old son, Brian, loved it.

It took a minute for me to realise I was making chocolaqte jello pudding - and I suppose if you were short of time that's exactally what you could use. However, I am just away to make this for the second time in one month and have no plans to reach for the packet mix! This is a lovely recipe and as worth the effort.

This was very tasty - much tastier than it looks. I used a springform pan, which I buttered & lined with with waxed paper. I also placed the pie in the freezer for an hour before cutting - this helped, but it is a soft pie and not easy to serve. All in all, delicious though!

Another total rave for this recipe, I've made it a couple of times and it's great! Looking at other reviews about it being hard to get out of dish, I used a springform pan instead of traditional pie plate and it came out easily and looked great, even after slicing. This is on my go to list of wonderful but easy dessert recipes!

I had some problems finding unsalted butter but it turned out delicious! I love the whip cream!

Such a great find here on epicurious! Not only is it pretty easy to make even for the amatuer baker, it's DELICIOUS! I had a crowd that I knew wasn't real big on raspberries, so I supstituted and used strawberries - still came off great! They cleaned the pie plate completely - always a sign of a good recipe! I'm going to use raspberries next time because I personally love raspberries. The only other change I made was to use cool whip. I'm usually a major advocate of 'it doesn't count if it's not alllll from scratch', but I hate that waxy residue from whipping cream (the fat) as an after taste - espeically considering how much there would have been with this pie. I love the light fresh taste of cool whip though... and it was a great contrast to the rich, rich chocolate of the crust and pudding. But regardless, I'll be making this one again, and again!

Oh my goodness, this pie lived up to it's reputation of deliciousness and then some. I made it for my daughter's 16th birthday and it was a huge hit! I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out perfect, no problems with cutting or serving, used chocolate graham crackers instead of wafers, perfect.

Delicious and so good looking I had no problems with the pudding. The pie came out of the dish perfectly. I did whip the cream to stiff peaks and two packages of raspberries were enough. My guests raved!!! Definitely a keeper.

I liked all the layers of this pie except for the cookie crust. I'm not sure if I overbaked it, but it was way too difficult to get out of the dish when serving (even though I sprayed the dish with nonstick spray). Also, the leftovers didn't taste very good.

I made this pie for the 4 of July and everyone loved it!!! It was gone by next day. The chocolate pudding had such and intense flavor and the rasberries and cream balanced that perfectly. Delicous!

The pie definitely looked better in the pan than out of the pan. I think the only way to get a "pretty" slice would be to freeze it. But as soon as they eat it, no one cares that it looks like a pile.

I made this for a fireworks party and though friends liked the taste, I thought it looked horrible when cut and will not bother again. There was congealed butter around the rim, and though i greased the pie plate, the crust stuck terribly. Overall, the pieces looked horrible.

Turned out beautifully! Followed recipe exactly except only used 2 1/2 pints of raspberries which was plenty as they were large. I also refrigerated the crust for about 1-1/2 hours before putting in the filling. Yummy - my guests raved, and got thumbs up from the kids present.

Delicious! Needed a non-alcoholic frozen chocolate pie recipe, and this surpassed my hopes! Everyone used to love the Brandy Alexandar pie, but this is now the new family favorite--wonderful.

This pie was awesome. Mine looked exactly like the picture. I didn't change anything and I didn't have any of the problems other cooks described. I will definitely be making this again.

I believe I am a pretty experienced cook and have sucessfully made custards before, so when I saw that a few folks had issue with the consistency I was not overly concerned. However, it was a complete and utter disaster. After cooking the pudding it was a nice thick consistency while still warm or even room temp. I even made sure to cook long enough. However, after chilling, it turned into soup. I decided to serve it anyway by scooping it out but you could have used a straw to drink it. The bottom though sprayed liberally with cooking spray was stuck solid, and I had to chip away at it to get any out. End conclusion - inedible. I brought this dessert for Christmas Eve so it was very embarrasing and quite a mess. In addition, a very bad way to waste pricy fresh raspberries.

This pie tasted very good. I accidentally bought "sweet dark" chocolate instead of "semi-sweet"--don't know how that happened--but it still tasted pretty good. I agree that intenser chocolate flavor would come from purer chocolate. Also, in my neck of the woods, I can't seem to locate chocolate wafer cookies on a regular basis--so I used chocolate graham cracker cookies, and they really worked well. I would, however, pull back on the butter a bit next time--maybe just 3/4 stick. I also had the problem with the trifle effect when served out. Perhaps I'll try cooking the pudding a bit longer next time--or adding more cornstarch??? Not sure if this would be the way to thicken that pudding up. Still, all in all, well received by my family.

I've made this pie several times this summer and each time everyone raved about it, especially the crust. I didn't notice congealed fat but, I crushed the cookies very finely and completely melted the butter so it was distributed very evenly. I agree with the cook from Louisiana - I like a more intense chocolate flavor. After adding the bittersweet chocolate, I only had unsweetened chocloate so, I chopped 1 ounce and added it to taste. It was perfect. I chilled the pudding overnight and didn't have problems it setting. Before making the whipped topping, make sure the cream is cold and try chilling the bowl too - putting the bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes before anything goes into it works great and the stiff peaks form quickly.

to the cook from ontario, there is no such thing as a good instant pudding. Or premade crust for that matter.

This pie was easy to make. The butter or margarine does congele on the edge of the crust. I simply used a small offset spatula to remove the congeled fat. If you use oreos instead of chocolate wafers, you would need to cut down on the butter, as the oreo filling is also a fat. I chilled the pie for 12 hours before serving and did not have any trouble with it staying together. The whipped cream needs to hold the berries in the pudding so it shouldn't be too soft. Two half pints of rasberries were more then enough to cover the layer under the whipped cream with plenty left over for decorating the top. I would think you only need three half pints of rasberries if you want to cover the top the whip cream layer.

I only used 1/2 stick of butter for the crust and would probably try just a little more next time. The recipe says to chill the pudding in the crust overnight and I think that helps hold it all together. Overall, it was delicious and everyone loved it.

pie looks easy enough but i see there has been some problems. i wood buy a premade crust and use a good instant choc pudding.

Agree with cook from Richmond--very soft consistency, not pretty on a plate but tasted good. I used less butter in the crust and as a result it did not hold together perfectly. I also forgot to spray the pie plate as instructed and some of the crust stuck to the plate. Totally my fault! I would like more intense chocolate flavor and would use non Dutch process next time. I like bitter, intense chocolate and the addition of the bittersweet was not enough for me!

This tasted so good, but I had a problem with the consistancy of it...my pie would not hold its shape on the plate when I sliced it...it looked like a scoop out of a triffle bowl instead of a piece of pie. The saving grace was that it tasted so good. don't know why it did this?????

I followed the recipe exactly, but I couldn't believe that so much butter was needed in the crust. I asked my husband to see if I misread the recipe and since he confirmed that I had read the amount correctly, put in the butter as listed. Way too much!! My crust would not harden and when it cooled, it looked gross with congealed butter around the edge. I loved the pudding part and it was so easy, I will probably make the chocolate pudding again but if I make the pie again, I will cut the butter for the crust way down!

I thought this was a good pie. It was nothing extra special though, just a chocolate cream pie. I would definately make it again though. I don't think that you need to add all the butter to the crust mixture.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe! I couldn't find chocolate wafers so I used chocolate graham cracker crust and it worked wonderful. The raspberries go very well with the chocolate. My boys have already asked me when will I make this again!

This was very easy to make and very delicious! The raspberries added a nice touch...I did have a hard time with my whip cream setting because I didn't know how long to "whip" it. I think next time I will whip it longer, I only did it until I had "soft peaks". I also "cheated" and used pre-crushed Oreo cookie crumbs you can buy in a box, made it so much easier!
