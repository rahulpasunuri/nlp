I made this for a 4th of July cookout and everyone loved it

a great recipe - but I used about 1/3 of the dressing - I think it would have been overwhelming had I used it all. I also had to stop myself from frying up some bacon and adding it to the salad. But I will probably try that next time.

Wonderfully simple, tangy and fresh. Simple and good. My kind of dish.

I've made this several times with rave reviews! I substitued celery for the snap peas, which weren't available. I love the tangy mustard dressing with the dill! Great with grilled fish and chicken.

We did not care for this at all.
