I used this recipie only for the chicken paring it with turnip greens sauteed with garlic and roasted butternut squash. Also, I sauteed the chicken instead baking. The chicken was wonderful; moist and falvourful

This is a very good recipe with one slight modification. Just pan-fry the chicken instead of messing with it in the oven. It tastes good and takes less time

Yuck! Blegh! Gag! Choke! This was disgusting! The sauce tasted like tomato soup. It was incredibly unappitizing. When I made it like the recipe said, my brother looked at it and said, "That looks nasty." So then I threw it in a blender, and it turned a greenish orange! So then I added a can of tomato sauce, and it still looked gross. The chicken seemed like a good idea at first- It looked really good when I breaded it. But it said to put it on a platter, which I did, thinking it was ok to stack it. Well, half the breading got stuck to the other chicken breasts (which never happens when you bread chicken the "normal" way). Then when I tried to turn them over in the oven, the same thing happened. I tried to save it by shredding the chicken up and putting it in the sauce with a bunch of parmasan cheese, but the breading was really eggy despite being only made of whites. Suddenly plain rice tasted really good . .. .

Nothing special at all - soupy vegetables over pale chicken. I won't make this again.

I really liked this recipe - easy and tasty, yet not too heavy thanks to all the roasted veggies. I wasn't wild about the baked chicken preparation, or maybe I didn't do it properly. After baking, the chicken was done but not browned and the breadcrumbs didn't look very appetizing. I too, sauteed in a little butter and olive oil for a couple of minutes, and I was very happy with the results. I'll also use this recipe for the veggies only as a side dish with other entrees.

This was good & easy! I added quartered redskins, putting them in the oven first for 15 mins. The rest of the veggies only took 1/2 hour. I also added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to the chicken broth first, then stirred it in the pan (used for the veggies) over a low heat until thickened. The potatoes and the thick gravy made it a more complete, hardier meal.

This recipte is great. I baked the chickens for my husband and sauteed them for my skinny kids. Everyone was happy, the dinner was great and it was easy. The best combination!
