Those who commented that the cheese and sauce covered the taste of the roughy are correct but I will make it again with the cheese to get my wife to be ok with it (doesn't like fish particularly but liked this)

This was very disappointing. The sauce may have been okay with chicken, but we didn't think either the flavors or textures of the mushrooms and fish complimented each other. It was really not good.

Ok, so now I get the reviews here: the sauce is definitely delicious but definitely overwhelms the fish. Result tastes a lot like a pizza. My theory is that people who don't really like fish love this recipe because you don't really notice the fish! Personally, I think it's a bit of a waste of a nice piece of cod to bury it under a rich sauce and cheese. I think the cognac makes the sauce, by the way, so don't skip that!

LOVED! I would do it next time without the cheese - it didn't really add anything and made the dish stringy when serving. Added shallots. Used whiskey instead of brandy. YUM!! Will make again and again.

I know it torques some readers for someone to review a recipe though they made changes to it, but, here goes. I did not have cream and used half and half. I did not use the cheese and did not bake the fish. I used frozen albacore from Trader Joes and fresh boletes from my yard. I used Remy Martin Cognac. All in all this is an excellent recipe and I will use again though probably with some other modification. Sorry about that recipe fundamentalists.

We live in a rural area where our selection of ingredients is limited so we often need to substitute. For this recipe we substituted catfish for orange roughy. We could not find Gruyere cheese so resigned ourselves to Sargento packaged grated Swiss - which, when we read the small print, found that it was a blend that included Gruyere. The results were delicious!

Loved this recipe!!! I doubled it and tossed it with linguini, it was amazing. I used fresh tomatoes as suggested in a previous review, and used freshed tomatoes, which I pureed. I ended up adding about 3 cups of the puree. I will definitely make this again!

WOW! This mushroom sauce ROCKS! You could have that in a bowl all by itself! This dish is incredibly easy to prepare and the results are amazing! This is now a weekly dish!!

Rating: 3
I thought this was a really good dish, however, I don't think it complemented the fish at all. You couldn't even taste the fish actually. I will definitely make this sauce again but serve it over linguine and top it off with prawns possibly. I sauteed some shallots with the mushrooms. And I also used fresh cut-up tomatoes instead of canned. I also used the same skillet (oven proof) for everything which worked out great and was easier.

Only change we made to the recipe was adding even more fresh thyme. We paired this tasty dish with a very dry Muscadet. Cheers!

Very fishy with not much complement from the sauce.

Had to laugh at the reviewers that said the sauce would taste great on a bumper, but would definitely agree. Not in the healthy heart or South Beach cookbooks, but a great recipe when you want something decadent! I found it when searching for a recipe for some orange roughy I had in the freezer and I'm happy to add it to the file of great sauces for fish, chicken, steak and bumpers!!!

Fabulous. Skipped the whole broiler and cheese step...it was plenty rich as it was. I put the fish into the sauce after browning and let it simmer for 10 minutes. Wow! My husband loved it and the previous reviewer was right...this sauce would taste good on a bumper!

Rating: 3
I thought this was a delicious dish. I prepared it with Tilapia filets and the wife and I loved it. I made a little additional sauce at the end by adding a 1/4 c more cream to the left over in the pan and mixed it in with egg noodlesand presented the fish over top. A definite add to the box. I may try it with a simple risotto next time!

Rating: 2
I was disappointed - as others have said, the sauce is great, but I don't think it is a good fit for fish at all. I felt like I had put a pizza on top of my fish. Next time I'd try the sauce with pasta or chicken instead.

Rating: 4
I made this dish for dinner tonight with two changes. I used turbot because that's what was available. Also, I baked the fish with the sauce for 15 minutes at 375. Served with baked sweet potatoes and steam asparagus, the sauce was a lovely compliment to both. My fiance said it tasted like a $60 dinner plate at a fancy Philly restaurant.

Rating: 4
One of the earlier reviews said this sauce would be good on a car bumper...I have to agree! Great sauce, made it early in the day and chilled, brought it back to temperature prior to putting on the fish. I skipped the step of sauteeing the fish and just baked it then the quick time under the broiler. So yummy!

This was great. I'm making the sauce again tonight to accompany pork schnitzel.

This recipe is fool proof, easily adaptable and absolutely delicious. I've made this with cod and sole and they were both very good. I saute a few cloves of minced garlic along with the mushrooms, I use whatever wine I have on hand, and I leave off the gruyere to keep the richness from getting out of hand. (I love gruyere, but I'm not accustomed to cooking and eating food with so much butter and cream, so I really needed to find a way to lighten the recipe a bit.) Otherwise I followed the recipe more or less as written, but don't worry, there is no way to mess up this "restaurant style" dish. It is also very easy to time - you can leave the fish in the sauce in a 350 oven for quite some time without detriment, so if you're unsure when company will arrive or when your side dishes will be done, you don't need to worry.

Tasty recipe. I served it on a bed of spinach & mushrooms. Unfortunately, the mushrooms and cream made a mushroom soup-like taste, which I thought somewhat detracted from the fish.

Rating: 4
Exceptional sauce! I added Rotel tomatoes, garlic and concentrated tomato paste (tube); baked tilapia in 400 oven for 10 minutes. The fish, covered with sauce and cheese, was wonderful on a bed of spinach and Texmati white/brown/wild/red rice. I believe the sauce would be fantastic on anything, and will try it on chicken next time.

I just finished making this dish. I used fresh caught sea bass (caught it myself today). The only change I made was to sweat a little onion at the beginning. Excellent sauce!! It tasted terrific on sauteed spinach. Probably terrific on a car bumper too ;o)

I did not have the cheese so I made the recipe just as it says but without the cheese/broil part. It was great. With all that butter and cream, I am not sure how much more richness you would want to add. We loved it without but am sure would love it just as much with the cheese. I am going to use this same sauce on our grilled chicken tonight since we loved it and have both tomatoes and whippping cream left over from the fish dish. Serve with a crisp Sauvignon Blanc...yum, yum.

This was pleasant. Next time, I'd add some kind of allium to the sauce. I'm not sure the sauce is a good fit with fish -- I used catfish.

Rating: 2
This recipe was disappointing to me - not bad, just not fabulous. My main problem with it is that the flavor of the sauce and cheese seems to fight with the flavor of the fish, reducing the appeal of both. The sauce is rather earthy (I prefer brighter flavors for fish), and whereas mushrooms and fish are a fine combination, something about the sum of this dish didn't work quite right. I served the fish alongside noodles, on which I spooned some of the extra sauce (I upped the sauce amount so that I would have extra). I thought the sauce went better with the noodles than with the fish, and if I made this again, it would be as a sauce for pasta.

Absolutely phenominal dish. Best recipe I've gotten from this site, and that's saying something! I did make a few alterations. I used Grand Marnier and diced tomatoes instead of crushed and it turned out beautifully.

Made this numerous times now and it's one of the best I've found on the website-no kidding! I'm rather generous with the brandy and I bake it for almost an hour - the flavors are even better - try it!

This was super easy to prepare and very delicious. I'm pretty new at "real" cooking and I found this super easy to prepare and it was delicious. I omitted the brandy because I didn't have any and it was just fine without it.

I've been making this dish since it was printed in the magazine 10 years ago. We absolutely love this dish-the fish is not too strong (we substitute cod which is the same as orange roughy-just that cod comes from Atlantic waters, and orange roughy from Pacific waters), and the sauce is wonderful. I certainly will try this with scallops and shrimp sometime soon-a very good idea!

This was tasty, but something missing. Could have used a little more zing. Served over rice to soak up the sauce.

Ditto the rave reviews. The combination of mushrooms and fish in a cream sauce is elegant. With few ingredients and ease of preparation, this recipe has made my hall of fame. I've used haddock, tilapia and other fish and liked all the variations. I omitted the brandy. A true winner!

This was great -- used tilapia and it came out perfectly however the sauce did overwhelm the flavour of the fish.

I recently made this recipe as a practice run for a progressive dinner for 10 people. I sauteed the fish and made the sauce earlier in the day and refrigerated separately, with the fish on a cookie sheet. Then I reheated the fish for about five minutes in a 350 degree oven while the sauce reheated on the stove, then assembled and broiled as indicated. I had it plated in less than ten minutes from the start! Yippee. great for a dinner party, all advance and no fuss. That's why I gave it a four. It is a good tasting recipe that is great for a dinner party.

There is a reason that this recipee keeps getting a 4 fork rating. It is awesome. I also added the garlic and onion and I also added 1/2 lb. of shrimp and cilantro near the end and it was excellent!

Just had to revist this one again. It is FABULOUSO! I just received my 6th request for this recipe. I use about 2 tsp. tomato paste instead of the canned tomatoes. This one is also great with a combo of thyme & taragon. (that's what I've always used. I bake this instead of broiling. DON'T SKIP THE GRUYERE, BUT DO BUY A GOOD ONE! This recipe works great with any mild white fish, don't limit yourself to just orange roughy.

Wow, this sauce was amazing! I used tilapia instead of orange roughy because that's what was on sale at the grocery. I did think the cheese detracted a bit from the sauce and wasn't really necessary with the fish so I'll leave it off next time. Other than that, it was suberb.

I made this dish for the first time for Christmas Eve dinner for 17 because of the ease of the recipe and the reviews. I baked the fish with the sauce as previously recommended, and melted the Gruyere on top at the end. It was the hit of the dinner! We had leftovers the day after (with the fish included) over pasta and was fabulous. Will definitely make this easy and versatile sauce again.

I liked this, didn't love it. I think on chicken it would make more sense. With the fish, I found the gruyere superfluous. I added some garlic to the sauce, and would do so again. But I must say that my BF, who always says he hates a cream sauce on fish, absolutely raved about this one. So ... matter of taste.

Loved the dish, although I knew when I'd measured the cream that it would end up being a bit too rich -- we devoured it; it was scrumptious, but felt the heaviness afterward. Would cut the cream a bit next time. Used brandy and lots of fresh thyme. Also, since my broiler's broken I only quickly sauteed the fish and then baked it at 350 for about ten minutes. Gruyere? Why are Americans so in favor of blander cheeses -- don't they ever make real quiche? :) Don't skip the gruyere!!!

I used tomato concasse instead of canned tomatoes which added a nice texture to the sauce. The only problem with this dish was there wasn't enough. Fabulous!

This dish is wonderful - the flavors are mellow and it doesn't taste "fishy". I was short on time so microwaved the fish in a broiler proof dish, and followed the recipe for the sauce. This is going on our regular menu, easy enough for a weekday, and nice enough to serve to guests.

Rating: 4
This recipe is delicious. Any firm white fish will work. In fact, the sauce would also be great on chicken, meat or even pasta. Not to be eaten every day, because it's quite rich, but I had friends over for dinner and they loved it! I'd definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
We loved this. It was surprisingly easy to make. Couldnt get any fresh orange roughy so used Talapia instead and it was great. I used 1/2 the butter and sauteed the fish in olive oil instead of the other 2 tbls of butter. The Talapia was flaky so it fell apart a bit, but once the topping was over it, it was fine. Next time I would use a full lb of mushrooms instead of a half lb. I did 1/2 cremini and 1/2 white button mushrooms. We loved this dish and the presentation was beautiful.

Rating: 4
All I can say is "WOW". We loved it! It was so easy to prepare. Everything went exactly as the recipe directed.

This is one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth! I didn't have the correct liquor, so substituted sherry and used herbes de provence instead of regualr thyme. I will make this as often as possible!

Great weeknight meal. My 4-year old said the cheese was "stinky" too, but it adds a great flavor to the dish - definitely a must. Instead of broiling the fish and using two pans, after reducing the sauce I put it in a small saucepan to keep warm while the fish was cooking and used the same pan for the fish. When the fish was finished, I took the pan off of the heat, spooned the sauce over, sprinkled the cheese on (which i grated finely) and put a lid on for about a minute to let it melt. Turned out great.

I also omitted the pan frying of the fish and just put the fish in a baking dish, spooned over the sauce and sprinkled on the cheese and baked of 25 minutes.

OK, I get many recipies from this site, and usually, when a recipie gets so many rave reviews, it is a sure bet! I made this with scallops (my husband loves them), and he did like the dish (2 forks), even though it comes out like scallop soup, however, the Gruyere cheese is gross! I am a cheese lover, but this stuff stinks!!! I could not get the smell out of my head while eating, even though the pungency does wear off when you broil it. I would suggest any other cheese than the Gruyere...yuck!

This is very similar to another recipe that I had made for years, but the other one added a small onion and cooked it along wih the mushrooms. It does make a difference; would recommend that readers add this to the dish. Even people who do not necessarily care much for fish like this dish....it is a definite keeper. I haven't tried it yet, but would agree with others that this would be an excellent sauce for shrimp or scallops, as well.
