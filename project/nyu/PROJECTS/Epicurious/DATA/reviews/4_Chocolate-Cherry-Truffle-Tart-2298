This is soooo good! I did double the filling and used whole cherries as did another reviewer. It's worth it to use really good chocolate. I served it at a summer dinner party and it was a huge hit.

We went cherry picking last weekend, and this was a delicious way to use up the last of the cherries. I used a regular frozen pie crust (Nancy's, good quality) tho, rather than make the tart crust. Everything else as is. It was beautiful, easy, fun to make, exotic, a nice treat for my family.

Amazing! I love using fresh fruit in season, but I never imagined that it could work so well with chocolate! The flavors work so well together! I made a couple small adjustments - I substituted the crust with 3/4 of the chocolate crust recipe from the "Chocolate Cherry Tart" on this site, I increased the chocolate ganache filling to make a thicker layer, and the first time I made it I actually used whole instead of halved cherries. A mistake that was well worth it! It used more cherries but the flavor of the fruit was in better proportion to the sweetness of the jam - wonderful!!!!

Wow - this made a beautiful, glossy tart. It was fairly easy to make and glaze; if unfamiliar with tart dough it may take a bit longer. I made it while dark, perfectly ripe cherries were in season. Very tasty.
