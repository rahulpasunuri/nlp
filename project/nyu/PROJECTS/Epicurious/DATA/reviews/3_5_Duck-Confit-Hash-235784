coachdave, I assume that is a typo. As far as shredding the duck, you do not use 'raw' duck in this recipe. You use duck confit.

What does 1 3D4 hr mean? Tried it and just OK. Second Gourmet duck recipe that wasn't worth the effort. How can you possibly cook duck sufficiently for shredding after 8 minutes in a pan at moderate heat? And the rest, while still tasty, just doesn't make for memorable cuisine.

I'm not sure who can eat this for breakfast but I actually served it as a main dinner course. It was absolutely stunning and just as good the next day. The prep takes a long time and you have to be very careful shredding the duck since you are using the full leg and not jut the drumstick, A real winning dish

This was really a wondeful dish, i topped the hash with some lightly dressed baby argula and two poached eggs per person.

Loved this-- used slightly less cream (too much of a good thing, I think) and this was amazing!

I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of salting and peppering to my taste and just didn't think it was that great. It was too fatty for me, and I didn't feel that it was that incredible. It definitely made a lot of food though. I cut the recipe by 1/3 to make it for two and found the portions huge (and also wondered what type of a pan even exists to fit portions for 6 people!).The hash part itself (carrots, potatoes, onions) was nice in the duck fat with the skin, but I would reserve the meat for something where it can be appreciated on its own, or at least not so heavily obscured. I also may have a prejudice toward chesse with my hash--I've never had it without until now. Either way, it smelled great cooking, and turned out ok, but is not a keeper for me.
