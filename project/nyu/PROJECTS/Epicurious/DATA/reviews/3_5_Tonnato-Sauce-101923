always a great standby out of the cupboard in a hurry, great over leftover cold pork roast or cold sliced chicken, not to mention over fresh schnitzel

I combined a number of recipes--left out the mayo, added a couple of cooked egg yolks,used only the oil the tuna was packed in. I thought the result was a pretty good, if very pureed, tuna salad, that's all. I used it over pasta. Would never put it on veal or turkey. Disappointing.

Thought the sauce was great over turkey breast. Used tuna in water and upped the olive oil to 1 cup.

Traditional method is superior: omit the mayo (which Italians rarely use). I can tuna, about 1/3 cup olive oil, 3-4 T lemon juice, anchovies (1 large salt-cured or 4-6 flat canned ones), 2 T capers. Blend. Serve on flattened, poached chicken breasts (La Place & Kleiman), or a simple salad of ripe market tomatoes, cucumber, red onion and parsley with good chewy bread.

I've reviewed this before and it's still terrific. If two cups of sauce are too much for you, the sauce freezes well. It will separate when thawed but whisks back together easily.

This is wonderful on breaded turkey cutlets. Refer to "Turkey with tonnato"

tastes good - tuna is not my thing so I imagine if it was then this would get 3 forks.

Except for using low-fat Best Foods mayo and adding an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, I followed the recipe exactly and it's as good as tonnato gets. Tonight it goes over sliced chicken breast, tomorrow over pasta. What a find!

This was absolutely delicious. We served it with turkey cutlets and a tossed salad. We also had some Italian bread to get up every last drop.

Excellent as an hors d'oeuvres!!! Takes under 3 minutes to prepare. Serve as a dip with blanched snow peas and asparagus, you'll love it!

I made the LA reader's low fat version of this Tonnato Sauce last week. Today I made up a double batch. It's absolutely heavenly. I could eat a cup of it plain!

I completely changed the recipe to make it lower in fat and calories with great results. I processed 2 6 oz cans of water packed tuna, a 12 oz package of Mori nu soft tofu (don't worry, you can't taste the tofu), a 6 oz can of anchovies, 3 Tbsp olive oil, 4 Tbsp capers and lemon juice to taste. This is great over sliced tomatoes or as a dressing for bean salad. Hope someone out there who is watching calories enjoys this as much as I do!

I actually though I invented this sauce last year. I used to make vitello tonnato periodically over the years, but since becoming a non-meat eater, it occured to me that the tonnato sauce by itself would be wonderful over pasta.. and it is! If you have a food processor, this recipe is as easy as you can get. You can use half the amount of oil and increase the anchovies to taste. You can serve it over hot pasta or serve it cold.. It's yummy either way.
