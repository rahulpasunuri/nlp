I have made this several times now, bringing it to different parties, and every single time, I get raves from everyone on how delicious it is. It is a bit labor intensive, so the key is to make it a day before, however, it is worth it! Also, I usually tweak recipes to my liking, but I don't change a thing with this one. Enjoy.

I would definitely make the parts ahead and then assemble. I was worried- I love balsamic vinegar but it seemed just too much on the mushrooms and onions. But put the whole ensemble together and voila- it works wonderfully. It comes together great and the vinegar does not overpower. I used half the recipe for an appetizer for 5 and it was perfect. I had 3/4 of the aoili left over, so used it on grilled artichokes. One guest said she could eat just this for dinner and the husband wants it again.

Made this as a slider for a first course of a vegetarian meal. The only thing different that we did was to layer roasted portobellos with the caramelized onions and strips of roasted red pepper on a roll that we lathered with the rosemary aioli. We also put arugula on it as well. We skewered them and topped with a mini pickle. It was a huge hit!

Delicious! Took advice from other reviewers - used roasted peppers from jar, chopped onions before cooking, cooked mushrooms in balsamic on top of stove and chopped arugula. The aoili is incredible. Everyone raved about this!

The amount of work involved in this recipe is not worth it for a simple bruschetta; however the results are pretty good, which made me want to find an easier way to do this. You can use any kind of mushroom you want, the size really doesn't matter, just reduce the cooking time. You only need 1 red onion and 1-2 pieces of baby arugula per slice of baguette, so don't buy the quantity of ingredients this recipe suggests. There is also way too much balsamic used in this recipe. I kept the balsamic reserved for the mushrooms, allowing the natural taste of the red peppers and onions to shine on their own. I also reduced the amount of balsamic in the aioli since I made a homemade mayo that already had a sufficient amount of vinegar.

The dish was beautiful, but it looked better than it tasted. The aioli was great and the arugula was a nice fresh touch. The onions and mushrooms ended up tasting the same because they used the same marinade. Overall, it was all right but it didn't wow me.

To quote Aristotle, "The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts." It's pretty fantastic. I was freaking out that this was one big mess until it's all put together and then everyone goes nuts. Crazy amount of work, BUT the good news is you'll have enough of everything for a second night. Flavors got even better the second day. Absolutely make the aioli, it's amazing, also, make your own red peppers the flavor is worth it. Trust, this will become a favorite.

I will make this over, and over, and over again. It was a relative lot of work, however it was so very worth it. I made this as part of a romantic dinner for two and she was nearly speechless after one bite. Seriously that good. A friend and I had leftovers the next day and he raved some more. Highly, highly recommend. Don't change a thing.

Rating: 4
When I made this I used the balsamic that I cooked the portobellos in to cook the onions so I could save some balsamic. Also I thought the recipe called for way to much onion so I would half the required onion if your not totally nuts about onion.Besides those too notes this is an amazing recipe! WOW! delicious.

Everyone loved. But a ton of work. tons of leftover arugula and onions. I would cut those two ingredients in half. Would make it again, but a day ahead of time.

I made this for a tapas party I hosted over the summer and forgot the recipe came from Epicurious. I nearly had a heart attack when I couldn't find it while preparing for another gathering. It was the absolute, number one most raved about dish served. Yeah, it's labor intensive, but *so* worth it! Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

Rating: 3
These ended up tasting quite good, but I pared down the recipe a bit to make them easier to eat. All the toppings (mushrooms, onions, peppers, arugula) would have resulted in a big pile of food balanced on top of a fairly small slice of bread, so I ended up skipping the arugula altogether and going easy on all the other toppings. That way I actually ended up with more pieces of bruschetta to go around since I had some extra shrooms, onions, and peppers left over. I also used roasted red peppers from a jar, which saved time and still tasted very good.

Rating: 3
I had a deja vu experience when I made these recently - as I remembered how time consuming they were to make the first time and had completely forgotten. So, I was able to skip some steps, like buying roasted red peppers in a jar. Use less vinegar in the onions, or skip them altogether as they are what makes this messy to eat. Do not skip the rosemary aioli - you'll want it for sandwiches the next day - and the arugula (adds a contrasting color). Several guests said they were one of the best apps they'd eer eaten (and "bruschetta" with creative toppings is a big thing around here).

Rating: 2
I thought these were good but not spectacular. I would give it 2 1/2 forks.

This recipe doesn't have to be labor intensive. Purchase roasted red peppers, sliced mushrooms, and sliced baguette. Decrease the balsamic, increase the honey and brown sugar, and cook over the stove. This recipe is one of the best--always receive rave reviews even though a little messy to eat. Definitely make the rosemary aioli, as it blends all the flavors together.

Rating: 4
Spectacular - especially if you can find a guest to help you assemble at the last minute! I reduced the balsamic to 1 cup, sliced onions very thin with mandeline before cooking and chopped them coarsely afterwards, used prepared red peppers, coarsely chopped red pepper mixture in Cuisinart mini-chopper, and found it easier to eat by assembling with onions first, then mushrooms (left the long strips, which stuck well to onions), then red pepper sauce. After baking, added the arugula and aioli (made the latter with low-fat mayo and added one roasted garlic clove)

Rating: 4
This was delicious! It got rave reviews, and two people even thought I'd had the party catered. A few comments--definitely use prepared roasted red peppers. It will really save you time, and takes nothing away from the recipe. Also, next time I make this, I will chop the mushrooms more finely and sautee with the balsamic mixture rather than preparing in the oven. It will present better on the bread that way, and will be a faster prep, but should still highlight the wonderful flavors.

Rating: 3
Great flavor, but the balsamic was a bit strong. Couldn't really taste the mushrooms. Will make next time with less balsamic and more honey. Will cut back a bit on the onion. Believe this will make it a 4 fork appetizer!

I loved it, but I enjoy balsamic. While the balsamic was prominent, the other flavors were subtle & sophisticated. This would be a good choice to serve for those fond of balsamic. If not, it might be a bit overwhelming. I added a little roasted garlic to the mushrooms which worked well.

Rating: 4
This was awesome!!! Made for a family party and it was gone in minutes. No one could stop talking about how great it was. Did things a little different due to a broken oven. Instead I grilled the mushrooms on a stove top grill pan and than put them in a skillet over med. flame with the marinade. I can't imagine this recipe getting any better. Will defenitely make this again.

Without a picture, it's always hard for me to figure out how much to pile on top of the toasted bread. So, be careful of that. Followed the recipe, except, I was short 2 peppers, but I had 2 eggplants that I roasted, de-seeded instead. Have to say, even though I made this in the morning and served it at least 8 hours later, this appetizer is more flavorful the next day. The roasted veggies, onion mix and saucy sauce can safely withstand a day in the fridge before toasting up the bread and assembling.

Rating: 4
I happened to have a portobello in my fridge, so, since I don't like cooked mushrooms, I was trying to hide it. Therefore, I had a bit less mushroom on each piece than called for. Other than that, and contrary to my usual cooking habits, I did everything as written. I could NOT believe how good these are. I mean, truly restaurant quality. I think the arugula goes a long way balancing the vinegar and adding a nuttiness. Really, I wouldn't leave anything out; with all the vinegar you need it all to bring it together. As others have said, it is REDICULOUSLY labor intensive, BUT they were our main course, so it wans't a big deal. If I make for a group, I'll get most of it ready another day. Too much for a "day-of" party.

Rating: 4
Wow, this really is a labor intensive recipe! It's a great appetizer if you're just bringing one thing to someone else's house, however if you're cooking a lot of other dishes definitely make the day ahead!!! We served these at a get together recently and they were gobbled up. Guests actually said things like "best appetizers I've ever had. " If you've got the time, a keeper.

We were so disappointed with this recipe. It was expensive and a lot of work and from the reviews I expected more. I love to cook and don't have a problem with buying expensive ingredients or following detailed recipes. I enjoy all types of food and looked forward to serving this for a party. I made the recipe exactly as written. The mushrooms were way too sweet and the sweetness overpowered every other flavor. Adding the vinegar to the onions did not work either and made them too sweet. Perhaps half the amount would be plenty. Individually, the tastes were okay, with the exception of the mushrooms, but together they did not work. The aoili, however, was delicious. We won't be making this again.

What a phenomenal appetizer!! The unique combination of flavors highlighted by the rosemary aioli really makes this dish! Absolutely beautiful presentation also -- a real winner. Very time consuming (make 1 day in advance) but well worth the final result!

I really am shocked over those who didn't like this dish. I am a HUGE foodie, and love this. The Rosemary Aioli makes this sublime, and the basil really shines. I've taken this to a few parties and it's always a hit. I've even had people say it's the best thing they've ever eaten. So someone must have done something right when they created this. Yum!

I was excited to make this recipe for a recent tapas-themed dinner party, but was underwhelmed with the results. While it required a lot of effort (I followed the recipe exactly), it didn't quite deliver on taste. Not bad, but not a hit, either. The rosemary aioli is definitely a keeper, though!

Rating: 4
These were really yummy. The aioli was the crowning touch to a great combination of ingredients, and is delicious on other foods as well. I can't help but think that "cheating" a little bit (using peppers from a jar, or sauteeing fresh bell peppers w/ the onions) wouldn't hurt. I had to use dried herbs, and the dish was still delicious.

This was the Tapas favorite with our get together. I also made Garlic Shrimp, and peruvian style chicken dishes both served on flat bread, but this was the rave. The Rosemary Aioli sauce countered the tartness quite well.

It was very tasty, I just wish Americans (like myself) would learn the difference between bruschetta and crostini. This is a crostini recipe, basically. Bruschetta is sliced bread brushed with extra-virgin olive oil, grilled, then rubbed with a sliced garlic clove, maybe a little salt if you like, but that is IT!!! Crostini is what this recipe REALLY is :) Ranting over!

This recipe worth the time and effort. I always cook unusual things for my friends, and this one was a hit. It does take time to cook. The good part, though, that i was able to make everything a day before, then arranged it on toasted bread one hour before the guests arrived, and put it in the oven as people were taking their seats at the table. Less balsamic vinegar would be OK.

This is truly a dish for a sophisticated palate. It is labor intensive but well worth the work. I first made it for my family and they all loved it.

This was the most over rated and labor intensive recipe. It was SOOOO mediocre. You spend all kinds of time in preparation. My husband and I love to eat and we threw these away. It was like whoever created these kept adding stuff to the recipe because it was just missing something. It is still missing something and the worst part is when you bit into them, it goes all over the place. Save yourself a lot of time and effort!!!!I would have rated it a big ZERO if possible.

There are many parts to this recipe so it does take some time to prepare. My husband (a chef) insisted I reduce the balsamic by 1/2c and he was right. A reader had mentioned that the end product was messy to eat and so I made sure to chop the caramelized onions up further after cooking. It did help. I think next time I make it I will make it into a delicious pizza and add goat cheese or gorganzola. I missed the cheese. The flavours are excellent.

Don't bother the baking of the mushrooms, I just sauteed them in the pan after I did the onions. I skipped the arugala (spell??) and this recipe was just as good- they always ask me to make it! I have also used some regular white mushrooms when I haven't had enough portabellas.

Oh Myyyyyyy.....this was wonderful!! These disappeared from the plate so fast, I had to come up with a 2nd batch before the night was ended. I am not a big arugula fan, but it provided a wonderful counterpoint to the rest of the sweet/sour in this appetizer. I used a sweet slipper bread sliced horizontally and then toasted, instead of making individual bruschetta.

Rating: 3
The bruschetta is very, very tasty. I followed the recipe closely. However, it is also a lot of work, and a bit messy to eat. The onion slices are long and stringy; it's hard to bite them into bits. The chopped red peppers fall off the top, taking the aioli with them. Despite the effort required, I will make it again. But, I'll either chop the onions into a fine dice or try to make a sort of pureed onion marmalade. I may also try to make a pannini like sandwich. Yummy

YUM! I've made this twice now and all of the guests I've served it to have loved it too. It's an easy appetizer especially if you buy the roasted bell peppers in a jar. I did cut down on the amount of vinegar too...overall one of the best recipies on this site!

This is the best! It was a huge hit at a dinner party I went to. It's certainly worth the time it takes. I too used a jar of Roasted Red Bell Peppers from Trader Joe's. Make sure you slice the baguette thin. Mine was a little to thick and hard to put in your mouth once all the goodies were put on the top, but somehow we managed to consume all of them between six of us. The Rosemary Aioli is so delicious and there is a lot left over. The recipe calls for way to much arugala too. This is going in my Favorite Recipe File!

I join the chorus of praise for this fabulous dish. The rosemary aioli is what takes it from a three to a four fork rating. The coloring of the dish is exceptional.

This was delicious and very impressive. With the four separate toppings, it did feel labor intensive, but end result was worth it. Next time, I'll prepare toppings in advance.

This recipe is really fabulous. It's definitely time-consuming to make, but most of it can be done in advance and it's worth the effort. I made it as an appetizer for Christmas Eve dinner and it got rave reviews. However, I agree with the person who said she would cut the onions up next time. They are difficult to bite through, and since they make the bottom layer, the entire topping of the bruschetta often slides off in the first bite. Despite this, everyone kept going back for more--they are that delicious!

Absolutely wonderful. The aioli makes a great appetizer even more spectacular. Time consuming, but well worth it. Made everything the night before. Layered everything on the lightly toasted baguette the next morning, refrigerated it until serving time. Heated it up for a few minutes. Put on that wonderful aioli and served three to a plate. Could have made an entire meal of just that, but had other things to eat. Make this! It's great.

These are FANASTIC! I made these to take to a dinner at a friends. I prepared everything in advance and assembled them once there. I used roasted red peppers from the jar and they were perfect and easy. They were a huge hit. The only recommendation that I would have is when preparing the red onion slices I would make them somewhat small. I had halved the onions then sliced them but when we took bites into the bruschetta, the onions were a bit long and tangly so it was like eating sushi where it all wanted to drag into the one bite making it a bit messy. I believe if the onions were sliced shorter biting into would be a little neater. Either way, the taste was the perfect combination of flavors.

This recipe is beyond excellent! A terrific combonation of flavors. My dinner club loved them. With an appetizer like this, it was hard to save room for the main course.
