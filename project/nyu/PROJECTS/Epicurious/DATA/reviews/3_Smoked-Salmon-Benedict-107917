I don't eat salmon, but I made this for my wife for Mother's Day. She loved it. It was a bit rich (I tried it on toast/egg). Still it went over well. For a small, tasty, rich dish, it seems to do the trick. I skipped the poaching part and just fried the eggs.

It was nice but I would in the future make a regular hollandaise sauce. This was only ok!!

Fantastic. When tasting from the pan, the sauce seemed a bit strong for my taste but was fantastic on the egg and salmon. I added blanched asparagus to the pile and used english muffin halves instead of bread. I'll definitely repeat this!

Not a big fan of this recipe. Good thing our guests liked it. They love smoked salmon. Too much dilli in the sauce for my liking. It's a lot of work too.

And that potatoes have more carbs than toast...

This recipe was horrible, I will never make it again! Too much work, and it sucked! Dont waste your time!

Since we are trying to cut down on carbs, I served the eggs/salmon directly on the potatoe cakes instead of the toast. It tasted fabulous! I would definitely make this again.

Excellent. Perfect as written. I made toast cups from white bread slices, (flatten slightly, tuck into large muffin tins, brush with melted butter, sprinkle with sea salt and dill, bake at 350 until golden). Then layered the salmon to look like "flower petals", put the egg on top and served the sauce separately (it was a buffet-style brunch). Nice presentation. Excellent taste.
