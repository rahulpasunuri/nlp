These were heavier than white flour scones, as you'd expect -- but I liked them a lot. I ran out of brown sugar and only used about 3/4 c, which turned out to be about right; I think a whole cup would be too sweet. I also subbed soy milk with vinegar for the buttermilk since that's what I had, and that worked out fine. Also, I ended up with about 18 normal-looking-to-me-sized scones instead of 12.
