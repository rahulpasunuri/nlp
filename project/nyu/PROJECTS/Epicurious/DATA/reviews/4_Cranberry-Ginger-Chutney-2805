This is the second or third time I made this and it CONTINUES TO BE A HIT!!! Love the hot pepper and ginger it really adds zip to anything with which it's paired and it totally can be eaten on it's own or with ice cream. Don't just relegate it to thanksgiving!!!!

This recipe has become a family tradition for Christmas and Thanksgiving since it was first published in 1992. I double the recipe and pack the fresh ginger in the measuring cup to give more "kick" to the end result! If any is left, it makes an excellent condiment for turkey sandwiches!

Delicsious. I used this chutney recipe with the stilton tart recipe also on this site as well as to go along side a baked ham. Very good on both. My changes: I diced the appricots (because I wanted them the same size or a bit smaller than the cranberries) and I didn't have any currents. I also added 2 TBS of cider vinegar to give it that chutney tang.

This recipe really is fantastic. I have made it for the past three Thanksgivings and people are already anticipating it for this year. I leave out the currants and cook it a bit longer until the cranberries all pop open. Very easy and delicious!

I started making this 3 yrs. ago. It became such a HUGE hit, that family member's now ask me to make it for them to bring as a gift to other people's houses. I now make at least a double recipe. It is easy to make & looks beautiful on the table. It also tastes better after a few days and makes turkey sandwiches GREAT!

Very easy and VERY delicious. We repeat this almost every time we roast a chicken on the rotisserie.

I have made this during the holidays for a couple of years now. I keep having to make more because my friends like it so much. It has interesting flavor and texture.

All I needed to contribute was the cranberry sauce! I couldn't decide between this and the Cranberry Chipotle Conserve, also on this site, so I made both. Delicious. The ginger one I thought was a little sweeter. Used cider vinegar rather then cranberry juice. Both are very very good. Everyone seemed happy with them.

I love this recipe, and have made it for three years now. It is very adaptable -- I have substituted raisins for currants and added walnuts. Even added onions and garlic once -- I can't seem to fail with it. I give it to friends and they love it, too. So quick to make!

i jarred this for xmas gifts and it was a great hit! awesome color, too. on xmas eve we baked it with brie and it was so good that we did it again on xmas... i followed the recipe as is, but raisins would have been a nice change. i five-timed the recipe and the only difference it made was increasing the boil time (waiting for the cranberries to pop)... everyones been asking for the recipe!

This was delicious! I spread it over a giant wheel of Brie as a holiday appetizer. I did add some chopped cilantro to the fruit at the end of cooking for a beautiful color. YUMMY!

Made this for T-day and unlike past years the cranberry dish did not just sit on the table, but got gobbled up! Was a little too strong for some guests so cut half with fresh cranberry sauce and served both full strength and mild versions. Will be adding this to my menu every year! Great on rolls and with cold turkey!

I was a little worried after I made the chutney beacuse the flavor was very strong. However, once I tasted it with the turkey, it was absolutely incredible. The chutney complemented my Thanksgiving nicely. I will make this every year.

Zowie! Following others' suggestions, I diced the apricots rather than quartering them, left out the currants, substituted cider vinegar for the cranberry juice cocktail (might do 2 T rather than 3 next time) and added an extra pinch of cayenne. Really, really yummy -- guests were happy, it went very well with a pork loin and gratin dauphinois, and I'm eating the leftovers straight out of the fridge. This will star in Turkey Day 2003 ...

Thought this was really good and great for the holidays. Put it hot jars while it was very hot for special Christmas gifts. Tried it with Chicken, Pine Nut & Feta Cheese Pizza, on crackers with cream cheese and on french bread with English Butter. Yummy! And, cannot wait to try it with Pork Tenderloin or on Turkey Sandwiches. As suggested, we cut the apricots smaller and used golden raisins. A great condiment!

Each time I make this dish for a party, it gets rave reviews. Guests return for several servings and ask for the recipe. I chopped the apricots smaller than quarters, added dried cranberries and golden raisins. It is a winner each time.

Wunderbar! I thought it needed a bit more sugar, so I added that and it was perfect. The cayenne is very good in this, not what you'd expect. Make a triple batch and pack hot in cleaned canning jars, then refrigerate for wonderful Christmas gifts. The second time I made this, I used a small package of chopped, mixed and dried fruit instead of the apricots. Also used raisins instead of currants. (-:!!!

This recipe was far too sweet- both cranberries and chutney suggest a little tartness in my book, and this had none. Also, the apricots stood out like sore thumbs. If I had to do it again I would add a splash of cider vinegar and replace the apricots with pecans.

I serve this chutney throughout the holiday season as an appetizer with crackers. It is terrific.

Quick, easy, and very tasty. I loved the spicy, gingery taste. I made a double batch and will use this, like another reviewer said, on turkey sandwiches.

Wow! What a wonderful combination of tart/sweet/spicy flavors! I make a double batch of this, just to go on turkey sandwiches, or so I can gobble it out of the tupperware in the fridge! It's become my favorite. Serve it with a goat-cheese quiche; it's irresistable.

Very nice chutney. I served it for Thanksgiving and it went very well with the rest of the meal. It was more popular than the regular cranberry sauce that I made.

This was a delicious side dish with lamb with raita. We served it for Thanksgiving and it was agreed that it was the best cranberry dish we had eaten.

Excellent alternative to more traditional cranberry sauces. Play with the amount of cayenne to suit your tastes.
