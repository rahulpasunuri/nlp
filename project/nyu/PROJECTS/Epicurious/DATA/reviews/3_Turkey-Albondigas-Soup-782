Excellent soup. Thin broth with lots of substance in the meatballs and vegetables. Doubled the hominy and sautéed the carrots and onions a little beforehand as reviewers suggested. Used 1lb. ground dark meat turkey instead of ¾ lb. That turned out to be a very good thing as it kept the soup from being bland as some reviewers mentioned. Didnt have green chiles so I cut up some sliced jalapenos from a jar. I didnt measure, but it was probably about 1/3 cup. Very easy to make. I like the fact that you can make most of the soup ahead of time and just add the fresh spinach and cilantro for a couple of minutes when you heat it up. Plenty of soup for 4 or 5 people.

Made this with beef instead of turkey meatballs. Used a 7 oz jar of green chilis and doubled the hominy like another reviewer suggested. I sauteed the onion and carrot in a little oil with S&P before adding the broth. It came out with great flavor and didn't even need additional salt!

This is great fall and winter soup. I have made it several times and have served it at one dinner party and was a hit!

I agree that this was bland. Wish I'd read the previous reviewer's suggestions before I'd made it. The meatballs are good - the oregano lends a nice taste - but overall something's lacking.

Turkey is bland. Add tblsp chili powder, garlic,& cumin to albondigas. Don't use tomato sauce, use tomato bullion instead of chicken broth. Double hominy, slice onion don't chop.4 oz. ortega peppers, 1 oz. jalepeno

Wow, we really didn't like this soup. I love spinach, but the broth didn't seem to have enough character on its own to support the ever-so-green taste of the spinach. If I were to make it again, I would probably add some tomatoes and go a little more heavily on the tomato sauce. My boyfriend and I both were underwhelmed. Try the meatball-vegetable soup instead!

Easy to make, but fairly bland.

This is a really good soup! I cut down on the oregano in the meatballs, it took away from the other flavors. I always get alot of compliments when I make this. It also freezes well.
