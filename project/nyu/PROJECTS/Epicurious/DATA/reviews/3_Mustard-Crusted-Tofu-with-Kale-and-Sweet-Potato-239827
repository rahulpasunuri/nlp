Not so much...I guess if you only eat tofu, then this would mix things up a bit.

I liked the idea of the mustard-crusted tofu. Mine did not come out as brown as the one in the picture, but it was good. I did not have a grainy mustard (I used an organic dijon) and I did not measure it (just slathered on as much as I could get from what was left in the bottle). For the vegetables I had more ginger and yam, less onion and potato; otherwise I followed the directions. I loved the flavour but the potato was undercooked and the kale a bit overcooked; wish I had looked at the other reviews first. Overall this was a quick and healthy dish, and my husband the meat lover gobbled up most of the tofu (even though he was slathering it with tons of yellow mustard and ketchup...).

Made this pretty much as written except I drained the tofu for several hours and then marinated it in soy sauce for an hour. Used stone ground coarse mustard and fried in sesame oil, I didn't lose any of the crust. Everything came out perfectly and was very flavorful.

definitely put potatoes in 1st if you don't want your kale overcooked. i found this recipe to be kind of tastelss and boring, even though i love tofu. it could probably use more seasoning. i added s&p to the veggies- red pepper flakes may have helped. overall disappointment.

Since it's the start of summer and bbq season, I used the grill to make this dish and it came out fantastic. I put the tofu (after draining and then coating in a marinade of soy, ginger, and sesame seed oil) on grill and then added some sweet honey dijon mustard to the top. Let that grill to crispy perfection. Then I put on the grill the thinly sliced sweet potatoes and onions that I had let sit with some garlic and ginger. Put them on grillpan and when they got hot, gave them a toss of tamari, and when done pulled them off. Then just stir fried the greens with some garlic and a dash of tamari. It meant very few dishes and really really good flavor that wasn't too soy-saucey as some recipes can get.

Everyone, even non- tofu types, loved it. Only change I made was to bake sweet potato 3/4ths of the way, then quarter and finish cooking with greens.

I made this recently, following the recipe closely, and was indifferent to the end result ("Meh" is the word I can best think to describe it.) The kale was quite flavorful and very easy to prepare--definitely my favorite part of this dish.

to the vegetables I first sweet potato, then added soaked shikate mushrooms and then Kale also a bit of Mirin and pinch of honey. With the tofu I pressed it with a block on top to get out the water as mentioned by another cook I ground mustard seed and some sesame seeds and added it to the mustard - used an organic roasted red pepper mustard that I had on hand. The combination worked really well together - the mushrooms add a very nice flavour and contrast.

oh, and put the potatoes in first, then add the kale about 5 minutes later. Don't add at the same time, the kale will be overcooked.

AWESOME. I was dubious of the mustard tofu but I tried it and loved it. I am a huge fan of tofu and will definitely be making the mustard tofu again (would be good on a salad). The middle of the tofu stays unseasoned, which is fine by me, but people who aren't as crazy about tofu won't like that. I used Maile Dijon mustard and used the back of the spoon to press the seeds into the tofu and lost very few of them while cooking. Easy and ridiculously healthy weeknight meal for a vegetarian household

And I used lemon juice not lime juice.

Yum. On first bite the tofu reminded me of a Fletcher's corny dog from the Texas State Fair. I cooked the onions first, then added potatoes and veg broth. I then sdded portebello mushroom, garlic and ginger. Once all was soft, I added the kale along with left over raw rale with cantelloni beans and finished with sesame oil. The tofu was drained and soaked in soy sauce and I used another's suggestion to coat the other side of the tofu once it is flipped.

Rating: 1
This recipe gets a thumbs down. First off, two minutes per side is nowhere near long enough for the tofu. Plus, you need to press and drain it for more than 10 minutes. Second, 12 minutes isn't long enough for the sweet potatoes and too long for the kale. You end up with crunchy potatoes or brown kale. Finally, the mustard won't stay on the tofu. Basically, you have to adjust all the cooking times/temperatures for this recipe; and the end result just isn't worth it.

Rating: 4
I loved this combination of flavors! A few notes: sub lemon juice for the lime, add salt and pepper, put in the kale after the sweet potatoes have been cooking for a few minutes, and let the tofu drain longer so it gets crispier.

It was good, and the perfect way to use up a few things I happen to have on hand and wanted to use. The lime juice is the surprise ingredients and will either make or break the dish depending on your taste. I liked it on the Kale, enjoyed it a little less on the sweet potatoes. Next time I will start sauteing the sweet potatoes alone and add the kale for the last couple of minutes. 12 minutes of cooking for the kale made it loose all its color. It only needs 3-5minutes. I created a marinade, adding 1TBS olive oil and a tsp of water to the mustard and let the tofu sit in it for 20minutes before sauteing it. We enjoyed the dish.

Rating: 3
it's pretty but not as tasty as you think it will be, although the flavors do add up to more than the sum of their parts. i suggest putting mustard on only one side of the tofu and then coating the other side while it's in the pan.

Despite almost ten years (no longer) of being veggie, we've never been the biggest fans of tofu. This recipe gives it a good consistency and a little taste, but the real star attraction is the vegetables. The sweet potato tasted beautiful. We substituted spinach for kale, which also tasted good but had a slightly slimy texture. Not sure if I'd make it again, but glad we tried it.

The mustard tofu was delicious!! The lime juice was a little overpowering so I think I'll try soy sauce instead next time.

I am not used to cooking tofu and I was a little wary of the flavor combinations, but the flavors were wonderful! The sweet potatoes came out undercooked and the lime juice discolored the kale (I poured it on top). Next time I would let the potatoes and some watered-down lime juice simmer together for a few minutes on medium, and then add the kale on top to steam, then sprinkle with more lime juice to taste after it is done cooking.

Vegegtable part was good; tofu was AWFUL. I cook tofu regularly, and I thought the mustard was overpowering. NOT a good flavor combination. Don't waste your time.

Fantastic! It came out perfectly, including the tofu coating. Delicious. I changed just one thing -- I cooked the potatoes for 6 mins before adding the kale, because the kale would have been overcooked otherwise (to my taste, anyway).

A simple, fast, delicious recipe. If I were to make it again, which I will, I'll put sesame seeds in the mustard and use a mustard with more whole mustard seeds.

I was shocked at how good this was! I had a few random ingredients around and stumbled across this recipe and am so glad I did. I chopped up the sweet potato, used tons of ginger, and also cubed the tofu. I only drained it for about a half hour and just mixed it in a bowl with the mustard and it worked perfectly. Will definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
Thank you to everyone for all for the great advice. Definitely drain the tofu for a few hours replacing the paper towel several times (we did it 3 times and it was still damp). We added some sesame oil (very little) and soy to some grainy mustard (not dijon) to add flavour. We marinated it for an hour before cooking. We also added a little corn and some vegetable stock (1/2 cup) to the vegetable mixture as we found the vegetables were getting a bit dry. A good dose of S+P helped a lot. What a great recipe! Bravo!

Rating: 4
I was very skeptical about this recipe. I am always weary about tofu in general. This was an AMAZING dish. I drained the tofu with many paper towels to make sure it was fully dry. I then poured some soy sauce over them. Instead of using olive oil, I decided to use sesame oil. A wonderful choice. The sweet potatos and kale were amazing. I am a meat and potato guy. I love a bloody slab of meat on my plate, but my finacee got my to make this, and I do not regret it.This will be making its way to my plate many times over!

By the way, I cooked the onion for two minutes, not one, stirred in the sweet potato and gave it a little swirl, then topped with the chard. Pour on the lime and close the lid. Tada. AND...make sure to dry off the tofu with several paper towels. I did it overnight in the fridge. AND...the chicken is also great with the mustard crust.

Rating: 4
Wow. I am very impressed. I used half the oil (EVOO) in each of the applications in nonstick skillet and pan and it came out great. I am no fan of tofu, but I loved this. My family was afraid of it, so I also tried it with chicken. Both were excellent. The lime is fabulous on the veggies - oh, and I used swiss chard because that's what my grocery had and it came out tender and perfect...I never lifted the lid.

Rating: 4
Love this recipe, just a couple of notes: technique for mustard is tricky but flavors the tofu quite well if you get it to work. Normally my best non-stick pan is cast iron, but for some reason my stainless steel calphalon works way better with this; mustard must be whole grain. Also I find that it's better to start the sweet potato before the greens, it takes me more time than recipe states. Swiss chard makes a great substitute.

The flavors were delicious, but I had a lot of trouble getting the mustard to stick to the tofu, so the presentation ended up being less than ideal.

I really hated this recipe. I don't mind bland tofu, I like mustard, and I love the combination of hardy winter greens + sweet potato, but this was really terrible. The mustard was overpowering, it flaked completely off the tofu (admittedly, this may have been a cooking error), and worst of all, none of the flavors melded together. The yam and kale were edible, but would've been much better as a baked yam with a side of sauteed kale seasoned with garlic and rosemary (instead of lime and ginger). I wish I'd read the reviews first!

I took the advice of many of the reviewers and did away with the mustard-crusted tofu. The kale and sweet potatoes were quite delicious. I did want tofu with the meal however, so I pan-fried some and then added a sweet chili lime glaze. It was a big hit. 3 Tbs sugar 3 Tbs soy sauce 1 3/4 Tbs lime juice 1/2 Zest of the lime 1/2 tsp red chili flakes 1/4 tsp Salt

The kale + sweet potato mixture is AWESOME!! The tofu is very bland, but marinating it in a strong bouillon or broth or nutritional yeast/broth mixture before applying the mustard would definitely help!

Great vegan recipe! I dredging the tofu in a mixture of two parts peanut oil and one part tamari before panfrying. Brush on the mustard at the end! If you want that crispy crunch, stick it under the broiler for a couple minutes on each side in a glass baking dish. Yum!

I really enjoyed this dish. It was simple, but unique and was a great way to incorporate tofu into a dinner. The grilled mustard turns sort of sweet and is very delicious. I had some issues with the mustard sticking to the pan, though. I didn't add the sweet potato because I didn't have any on hand. I also added a dash of soy sauce to the kale to add a little saltiness to the dish. Yum!

The sweet potato / kale part of this recipe is absolutely fantastic. I didn't bother to try the tofu, since reviews were mixed, but I wanted to weigh in on the "side dish." SP and Kale are both super powerhouse foods when it comes to vitamins and antioxidants, but I never found a way to prepare either one in a way I or my boyfriend or family actually liked (except for thanksgiving, obviously, but that's not adaptable for everyday meals) until now. The flavors in this recipe are perfect together. The lime, ginger and onions (and I add 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes) marry brilliantly with the kale/sweet potato - changing the flavors completely from what you would expect (bitter kale becomes sweet, sweet potato becomes savory and mellow) It's ABSOLUTELY worth making this even if you skip the tofu part. It's become a once-a-week staple in the rotation at my house. Nutritious and cheap and awesomely delicious.

Used swiss chard, added garlic, and used powdered ginger as the fresh I had was moldy. Very tasty and delicious. For the tofu, I used very high quality country dijon and mixed it with panko bread crumbs and spread that on very well drained tofu, like spreading peanut butter on bread. Covered the bottom of the pan generously with oil and used a fork to flip and did not have any problems with mustard coming off. It actually stayed on and formed a perfectly delicious crust. Very good recipe, but only three forks because the tofu, aside from the crust, was a little tasteless.

This was a great healthy dinner. I had to substitute some due to poor planning (didn't have an onion and used chard instead of Kale) but it was still delicious. I'm not a huge mustard fan on sandwiches, but it tasted great on the tofu. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a healthy, and quick dinner.

Excellent! Fast, healthy and a wonderful balance of flavors. The greens and sweet potato were perfect, just slightly tender. I could not get the mustard to stick, but it was still good. I just scraped up the mustard brown bits and put them right on top of my tofu. I will be making this again.

This was simple, fast and tasted amazing not to mention how healthy it is. I substituted fresh spinach for the kale because I had it on hand.

Very nice touch.I will definitely make this one again!

We cooked this tonight and it turned out WONDERFUL! We had to cook the tofu in two batches because I only have one non-stick skillet, so we were able to experiment a bit. We found that the best way to flip the tofu was with a fork, the spatula scraped the mustard off. A thicker layer of mustard didn't really make it better, as long as it was well coated. And more oil made the mustard a little crispier but wasn't really required if you are careful in the flipping. We found the pan needed to be hot before starting, and that you needed to let the tofu cook in the pan for a good 2 or 3 minutes before even touching it. We actually liked the kale with the lime juice - it gave it an intense flavor, and added a new dimension to the sweet potatoes. Overall our group really enjoyed this tonight!

Rating: 3
I actually liked this. I think one of the keys is to use whole-grain mustard, as called for - not Grey Poupon regular dijon. The seeds are lovely. Using a fork to turn them was good advice. Next time I'd marinate in soy, then use the mustard - while the crust was great, the mustard flavour of course does not permeate. I added garlic in with the onion & ginger, and put in the kale with 2 mins left to go. Didn't have a sweet potato so used white, and it was still great!

This was an odd combo. I liked the kale/onion/sweet potato/lime/ginger melange, but the tofu fell flat. Mustard scraped off, and it just tasted oily after that. I'd do the kale/sweet potato again by itself, but not the tofu.

Just a note to those who have problems with the mustard "sticking" I made it a 2nd time and it worked perfectly. There are 4 keys to this: 1, use a fork to flip the tofu, NOT a spatula. 2, make sure you use enough oil. It doesn't have to be deep but it needs to fully cover the bottom of your pan. 3, Make sure you don't lift up the tofu too soon. I've found that "checking" the underside too soon separates the mustard from the tofu 4, make sure the tofu is drained VERY WELL. I go beyond the 10 min draining, by swapping paper towels, flipping the tofu and pressing it lightly with another paper towel.

Rating: 3
Switched out the mustard tofu for a tofu prepared with toasted sesame oil, lime juice and soy sauce. Marinated it in the oils for 10 minutes, laid it in the pan with oil for a few minutes on each side. Dry toasted sesame seeds in a separate pan to top. This version with the toasted sesame oil had a nice sweetness which contrasted and complemented the strong kale taste. The sweet potato has a similar effect. This was both yummy and healthy. We'd definitely do it again.

Rating: 3
I needed a recipe to use up some tofu in my fridge so did not have all the ingredients, but enough to say I liked this dish and will make again. The mustard I used was a sweet whole grain variety. I think the added sweetness would have been an improvement over the plain dijon. I didn't have kale or sweet potato but found sliced red potato and sliced zucchini to work with the ginger/onion/lime seasoning. Forming the crust was a little hard because my spatula seemed to scrape it off when I flipped it. Next time, I'll use a fork to flip it. Overall it was an easy refreshing dish I will make again

Good ingredients, but really boring. The mustard doesn't stick to the tofu, the veggies are just hanging out in some ginger and lime. The lime is nice, but you can do better. Keep searching for that perfect sweet potato recipe.

Really great! I'd been wanting to make this for awhile but was a little scared by the bad reviews. My boyfriend and I both thought this was excellent. I made it just as described (using olive oil instead of veg oil and adding one extra sweet potato-- which in reflection was probably too much). Anyhow, I used cheap dijon mustard and this was great. I'm having the leftovers right now (at 10:30 a.m.!!) Easy to make and cheap and good for you, too.

After all the mixed reviews, I just had to try this. I really liked it. I added the sweet potato a little early and used pre-cubed extra-firm tofu tossed in Grey Poupon Country Style (only worried about browning the cubes on one side) and served with brown rice. I used a truly nonstick pan and the oil for the tofu, which may be why I did not have too much of a mustard loss problem. My husband thought it was too limey, so next time I will probably cook the veggies, then just deglaze with a little lime so they're not so saturated. Will definitely make this again.

Eh, mediocre. The mixed up flavors weren't as horrible and mismatched as some seem to think they were / would be... it just wasn't anything amazing. However, it was really easy and didn't require that much of my attention to turn out well, so I would probably make it again.

Rating: 3
This was a very pleasant dish. The mustard added really great flavors, but did not stay on tofu that much and caused it to not crisp as much as I'd hoped. Next time, I would not add the mustard until after the first side of tofu has been sauteed and only put it on the second side to get it nice and crispy.

A melange of uncomfortable flavors. The lime poisoned the already weakly seasoned veggies by drowning out their natural flavor. The tofu + mustard proved an uneasy match, and even after pressing the tofu I did not have much luck forming a tasty or firm crust.

Rating: 4
Long story short: it was absolutely wonderful. Tangy flavours - mustard grains, lime juice - infused the earthy sweet potato and the curly kale. The tofu absorbed the mustard just beautifully - and an extra dash of soy sauce carried the savoury flavour through. A few changes: I used groundnut oil instead of vegetable oil and reduced the amount of oil by 1.5 tablespoons. (The tofu needed only 1 tbsp, and the sweet potato/kale mixture 1.5 tbsp). Aside from that and the soy sauce, I pretty much stuck to the recipe. I think the sweet potatoes should go into the pan before the curly kale - it needs a bit longer to cook. And the tofu needs a bit longer than 2 minutes on each side to get that lovely crispiness. Also, the recipe says it serves four, but it really only made two respectable servings for my husband and me. So if you're serving it as a one-course dinner, it really only serves two. http://eatingforonecook ingfortwo.blogspot.com

We are making this tonight, but thought we'd put an idea out there. For those who want their tofu drier, you might try pressing the tofu before drying it with paper towels. We press ours between two plates with heavy books or kitchen equipment on top to squeeze out the water. If you have a screen to put the tofu on even better, because then it doesn't sit in the water that's leaking out. :) Happy cooking!

Thanks to all the previous reviewers for your comments...even the negative ones! I drained the tofu for about 2 hours with multiple paper towel changes, and just spread them with enough mustard to coat. I added the sweet potato and lime juice to the pan, and then cut up the kale and added it a few minutes later, to avoid overcooking. Kale/sweet potato definitely needs some S&P. I cooked the tofu in my cast-iron skillet and didn't have too much trouble with the mustard sticking to the pan after I scraped it up with a spatula. I served it with steamed black rice...hubby said flavors went well together. Easy peasy.
