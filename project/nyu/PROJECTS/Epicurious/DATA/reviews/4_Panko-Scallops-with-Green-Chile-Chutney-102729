I received RAVE reviews on this! As usual, I go with the recommendations of my fellow chefs and made chutney ahead and increased coconut. In the afternoon, I got the scallops ready by breading and refridgerating. (breading stays on better) HOWEVER I ran out of time and baked them a couple minutes in a very HOT oven. They were WONDERFUL!

Great recipe, added some sugar to sweeten it up a little bit, but really great, will definitely make again.

Instead of using scallops, I turned this into a vegetarian dish using cubes of tofu partially sliced and stuffed with pickled ginger. It was great. The chutney, in particular, was excellent!

I made this for a dinner party that I attended and it received rave reviews. I didn't use the jalepeno seeds because I was afraid of too much heat. Making the chutney a day ahead really lets the flavors blend together. It was delicious!

Amazing. Everything about this dish is perfect. I made it exactly as written except for more coconut and lime juice in the chutney. Almost a week after serving it, my guests are still raving about the chutney and guessing what was in in it. One friend went home with the copy of the recipe I had printed out for myself.

This is a fabulous combo of texture and flavour. Be sure the oil is hot enough and the panko crumbs will stay on the scallop when frying. The chutney was incredible and I can't imagine nixing this for a subsitute. I made it without the chillis (as I had enough heat with other tapas I was serving) and it was a nice, clean flavour.

The scallops are delicious and easy but we were not impressed with the chutney given the prep time. I plan on making these for the 2nd time tomorrow night as one of several appetizers for a casual get-together but this time plan on getting jarred pepper chutney from a specialty food store.

I had trouble with the breading staying on as I was frying. So even though they tasted great, I was glad I wasn't hosting a dinner party because they looked terrible. I would rather have a simple sauteed dish of scallops than go through this tedious breading process.

It sounded good, and it tasted good. I found scallops to be very expensive, so I mixed in some shrimp. Both were DELICIOUS with the chutney and it even encouraged my sister to start cooking!! Definitely I recommend it.

I gave this recipe high marks not just because of it's taste, but it's appearance and ease of preparing. Making the chutney a day ahead and frying the scallops a few hours before serving, makes this a great appetizer for parties. I liked the recipe just as it was printed. Just last minute baking and serve...very good!

Good, though it definitely took me more than 1 1/4 hrs! I guessed I would need less than 3c panko, and my estimate of 2c was correct. I also did not quite need as much egg mixture, but it's harder to cut back on an egg :-) And yes, the overall amount of chutney can be reduced somewhat.

I prepared this recipe for a holiday party of 30. My guests loved it! I added extra coconut to the green chile and to the panko. Delicious!

Excellent for entertaining small groups/dinner parties. I've made this recipe three times and all my guests requested a copy of it!

This is a great recipe but I converted it to a 2 person appetizer by using 8 large scallops and made half the amount of Chutney. It's still a lot of Chutney but could be used on any seafood. And, it should indeed be made a day ahead to allow the flavor to develop. I too added a little extra coconut and, in light of the other intense flavors, it was fine. Because of the smaller batch, I just sauteed the scallops over high heat for 3 - 4 minutes a side in a large pan (no crowding)and I was done. It's outstanding and easy - the best combination for any recipe.

One of the hits of my New Year's Eve party

Made this appetizer on New Years Eve '99 to rave reviews. However, it's an absolute must to make the chutney the day before so that the flavors can meld together. I added more coconut than recipe called for to make it a little sweeter. Also, a friend that hates cilantro loved this dish. A definite keeper!
