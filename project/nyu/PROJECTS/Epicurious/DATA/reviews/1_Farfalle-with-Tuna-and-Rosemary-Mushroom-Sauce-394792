We followed the recipe exactly and found it to be relatively flavorless. The base is good, but it definitely needs something to spice it up a little bit.

This was just okay. The sauce was quite dry and didn't make enough for the pasta. But the flavor of the anchovy and tuna was pretty good. Still, I wouldn't make it again.
