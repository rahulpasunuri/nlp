Very easy and very good. Our 11 year old even ate her spinach:)

Easy, colorful and delicious! I prepared the spinach and red bell peppers early in the day and warmed them with butter before serving on the Parmesan Polenta, as pictured in the Bon Appetit, September 1998 issue.

A brilliant recipe. So easy, and so delicious, especially with pre-washed spinach. I substitued hazelnut oil for the olive oil which gave it an interesting flavor.
