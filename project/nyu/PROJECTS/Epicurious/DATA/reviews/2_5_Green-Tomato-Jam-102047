Since green tomatoes serve as a base and don't have too much taste on their own I added six slices of fresh ginger which I removed with the cinnamon sticks at the end and renamed it Green Tomato Ginger Jam. It took a long time to cook down but tasted great! Also 3 lbs green tomatoes are equal to 3 lbs (6 cups of sugar. I processed it in my canner for 15 minutes which seemed about right for a sweet tomato recipe. Ann La Porta

How long can you store this jam for? Can you process it with a regular canning procedure for jams for long term storage? Alternatively, if you use a short term storage method, how long could you keep it?

to the member who found this too sweet.When making jams, make sure your measurements are all in the same denomination.weight versus weight, liquid vol versus liquid volume.Hope this helps thanks

Hi.The only thing wrong with this recipe as i see it is the proportion of sugar.Usually you use equal fresh fruit to sugar in weight. and the juice of one or 2 lemons depending on the amout of fuit you use.So if you found it too sweet it is because you added too much sugar.Its all about measurements.Keep them in the same denomination.wt versus wt is best.not vol versus weight.or vol of dry solids with with vol of wet solids Hope this helps those who had difficulty.

I made this jam according to the recipe, and it was horribly sweet!!!!! There must be a typo or something for the amount of sugar. Anyway, I solved the problem by adding 3 lbs of rhubarb and then about 5 more pounds of green tomatoes and juice from 2 extra lemons. It was still a bit too sweet, but I really liked it. So this recipe is horrible as is, but delicious if you make changes to it. Here is my new recipe: 3 lbs green tomatoes 3 lbs rhubarb,diced 3-4 cups sugar (to taste) grated rind of 2 large lemons juice of 3 large lemons 2 cinnamon sticks The only thing I'm not sure about is the level of acidity needed for safely canning rhubarb, so I added extra lemon juice. Try this!!!
