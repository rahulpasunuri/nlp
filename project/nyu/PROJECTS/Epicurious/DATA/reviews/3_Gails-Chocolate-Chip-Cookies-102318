Glad I wasn't scared off by the reviewsI thought these were great. I don't mind that they are adapted from the Tollhouse recipe, half of that recipe was exactly what I needed for the amount of butter I had in the fridge! I did add 1 tsp of salt, which I think it needs, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. A quick and easy recipe, I will make again.

UGH! These cookies were flat, gross, and all together a waste of time and ingredients! I was very disappointed.

These cookies are weird.

This is essentially the Tollhouse cookie recipe cut in half, minus the salt and nuts. No points for originality.

Followed it exactly. I agree, bland. Will try another recipe next time.

These weren't great. Good consistency, but pretty bland. Try the SPICED CHOCOLATE CHUNK WALNUT COOKIES on this site - best chocolate chip cookie dough ever!

these were great!! i was hesitant to try them, but i gave them a shot, and i personally enjoy this recipe better than the nestle recipe. i used a whole 12 oz bag of semisweet choc chips though, and used margarine instead of butter. i also added 1 tbsp of water after folding in the chips, because the batter was a bit stiff. i did the pan-switching technique, and for my oven, 5 min on top, then 6 min on bottom and let them cool in the pan (i put down parchment paper). they're delicious!!

Needs salt to help the cookies rise a little. Fell flat - the recipe and the cookies.

Here is the Toll House recipe and in my opinion the BEST recipe. 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 3/4 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup packed brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs 2 cups (12 oz pkg) NESTLÉ TOLL HOUSE Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels 1 cup nuts, chopped

I didn't have the size of cookie sheet required so I guessed the size of the cookies on my sheet. As they baked, they spread out very flat- that was unappealing. Maybe my baking soda is old and ineffective. I thought the cookies would rise somewhat. I only ended up with a dozen cookies when I halved the recipe (except the egg. Still used one)

I must say I made these cookies and they were delicious, I would definately make them again and visit epicurious web site again and again, as for who's recipe this is, isn't all recipes handed from one to another? You go Gail! keep up the good work!

The reason I'm rating this recipe so highly is not because I tried Gail's recipe but because the Toll House Cookie recipe deserves those ratings and higher. So, Gail decided to put her name on the Toll House Cookie recipe. Who is Gail? Does Nestle know????

Being a novice cook, this was the first CCC recipe I ever made and... I have no desire to change! Folks, who CARES if it's adapted from something else - aren't all recipes just that? I've made this recipe as is, and in a 9X9 glass pan for bar cookies, which are phenomenal. I've also made this the night before to bring in to school to make w/ students. Always a huge hit. So just enjoy it for what it is...

I was happy the recipe was here as my hard drive crashed with an adulterated version; ie. Subbing white sugar for dark brown and using Callebaut dark choc. chips. And yes it's shameful to steal such a famous recipe.

What a strange recipe. I was not impressed with it and did not like the 6 tablespoon measurement or the mid cooking shake-down. What is that all about?

Er Anyone watch that friend's show when Monica is trying to come up with pheep's grandmother cookie recipe???? Turns out it is the tollhouse cookie recipe??? Yup folks this one is too. Now they are still good and yes I will make them again BUT I did not think I would ever see them on the web site..... I made these way back when I was 7 for crying out loud....

I made these cookies with regular, salted butter and I have to say, they were the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made.......

What a rip-off! If anyone bothered to read the Nestle's Tollhouse Chocolate Chip recipe on the side of the package, you would see that this recipe is a HALF recipe of the Nestle's!! {Gail took out the salt but as another reviewer said, it needs salt, duh!) How epicurious.com let this one slip through is beyond me.

I made these cookies this evening and brought them to a friend's children to sample. They loved them aand so did the adults. I added toasted slivered almonds to the recipe and they were great. This is my new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. I doubled the recipe and it was fine.

Do not make these with unsalted butter! (Or if you do, add 1/2 tsp of salt). I kept thinking they lacked something, then double-checked the recipe: no salt. Chocolate chip cookies need salt.

FYI, don't try chilling the dough for later use...it alters these fabulous cookies for the worse.

This is the Nestle toll house recipe from the bag, just with the quantities halved!

My four year old granddaughter and I made these yesterday. She calls this messy cooking because she does all the stirring. Anyway we both enjoyed these very much and so did granddad. Added some toasted chopped pecans to half of the batch(Madeleine doesn't like nuts) Next time will cook one minute shorter as they were very crisp but not too brown. Yummy!!!

These cookies are no-fail and terrific. I use the best and biggest chocolate chips I can afford. They just don't stay around. I have made a dozen batches of it and I only wish I could eat all of them myself. I made them with vanilla chips for my sister who doesn't like chocolate and she loved them.

I added walnuts to the recipe, as suggested. They added flavor to make the cookies disappear quickly.

It was one of the easiest recipies,it doesn't require much work.It was the first recipe I've ever made that you actually got a good amount of cookies. It was great, I would definitly make them again.I also like the short cooking time, very convinent.

These cookies were so-so. They tasted mainly of butter and sugar, even after I halved the granulated sugar content. The pre-baking mixture was noticeably dry, so I felt I had to add some milk to it. These cookies could be more interesting: what about walnuts or whole-wheat flour or something else?

I loved this recipe. I changed the adding of chocolates chips to a cup of Peanut Butter. It was delicious. My husband and little girl love it when I make these cookies (chocolate chip or peanut butter). And it was so easy to do. I make these all the time whenever my little girl has her friends over. I have to atleast make three dozen because they are gone in no time at all. I would suggest this recipe to everyone who likes easy to make cookies.

It's no wonder this recipe has received such good reviews. Not to discredit Gail, but this recipe is the original Nestles Toll House cookie recipe found on the bag, halved. It's still good, though!
