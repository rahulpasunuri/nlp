This recipe was easy but not very special.

I did not like this recipe at all! The vinaigrette was really strong and had a bad taste. I would definitely not make it again.

Very simple yet delicious. I saved the leftover vinaigrette for next day's salad and it was still very good.

Very tasty! I skipped the herb salad, but added chopped fresh Italian parsley and oregano to the vinaigrette. I also used a bit more lemon juice than called for. I marinated the fish in some of it for 15 or 20 minutes, then drained it and cooked it as directed. Served on a bed of sauteed chard, drizzled with the vinaigrette and surrounded by tiny roasted potatoes. Very pretty and delicious.

This was so easy and quite good, very flavorful. Like another reviewer, we served this over whole wheat couscous- the vinaigrette was great on it. And, also like another reviewer, I used the extra vinaigrette for salad the next day. DeliciouS!

Really nice dish that is super quick and easy. I like to use arugala instead of herbs. Have found the dressing goes a long way and I often make extra to use on salads for the next few days.

Not terrible, but Boring...

I needed to adapt it a little but will say, add a little more salt and consider cooking in some of the marinade as 2 other reviewers state. Also don't substitute the vinegar as other variants don't seem to have the "right" acidity/flavor for this.

Good recipe but I needed to add quite a bit more salt and vinegar... I would definitely make it again though.

This recipe is easy and delicious!! I've made this at least 5 times, and served to guests, always with excellent results. I make the fish and vinaigrette exactly as described, omitting the herb salad. I usually serve the fish over whole wheat couscous, which goes very well with the moisture from the vinaigrette.

Excellent recipe. I served it over Quinoa which is a great option instead of rice. In addition I added a sprinkle (approx 1 tsp) of brown sugar to the sauce to cut some of the harshness. So good!!

This is an easy and delicious recipe. I added some capers to the vinaigrette, I used balsamic vinaigrette instead of the Sherry wine vinegar, and rested the fish on a bed of mashed potatoes. This is a keeper.

My comments are only related to the vinaigrette. I made the vinaigrette, minus the sherry wine vinegar. Used red wine vinegar in its place. The vinaigrette, which I drissled over fresh, pan seared, cod, is fantastic and I will will be making it again. I am looking forward to using this on BBQ chicken. Two reason for 3 vs 4 forks don't have much to with taste of vinaigrette, my wife and I enjoyed it. Its a lot of oil, not the healthiest thing out there and I can't find a key ingredient. Worth trying though for sure.

This recipe is great and I'm beyond inept in the kitchen. I have gluten and dairy allergies and its hard to find good recipes that are healthy and don't compromise anything.

I cooked the fish on the stove top in some of the marinade, and it was simply outstanding!!! One of the most delicious foods I have ever prepared (in many years of cooking.)!!!!! I used wonderful sablefish from VitalChoice for this and will definitely make it again.

Subtle and yummy. I made this for my in-laws who don't like a lot of spice. The fish is so flavourful it keeps the dis interesting and not bland. Very quick to make as well!
