I made this for my family last week, with no substitutions. It was perfect - the apple brandy added just the right amount of depth and the biscuits were subtle, not too flashy. It is beautiful to look at - I used maple leaf shaped cookie cutters instead of circles for the biscuits - and my family raved. It's not too sweet, and appeals to adult tastes... perfect for a dinner party or family meal.

This cobbler is fairly bland as far as my expectations of cobblers and apple desserts are concerned. With the exception of the brandy-soaked raisins, this dish needed some pizzazz! I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar with 1/4 cup of white sugar for the fruit mixture. I also eyeballed additions of nutmeg, cinnamon and about a rounded 1/4 tsp. of cardamom to the fruit. If that doesn't make your tongue wake up and slap the roof of your mouth with joy, nothing will! On to the biscuits. I like a plain biscuit for breakfast, but for dessert, you can't go wrong adding a bit of melted butter, sugar, a dash of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp. vanilla to this recipe. Let's just say there are some happy tongues wagging in my home today!
