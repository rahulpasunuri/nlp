I wanted something special to serve over my delicious lemon/orange cheesecake. This recipe wasn't it. I was expecting a much stronger orange flavor. What I got was a sauce with a burnt sugar, bitter rum flavor. And I'm experienced cook and know I didn't burn the sugar. Much too much rum and not enough fresh orange flavor. Certainly not worth the work.

I made this recently, selecting this recipe based on it's apparent simplicity as I was a first time caramel-maker (although experienced cook). I had no trouble making the caramel, but found the results to be nothig special. I felt the rum flavor was too overpowering, I would have preferred more of the orange flavor (and I like rum).

This was definitely a good recipe, but it's better with coconut rum & nuts (in my case, I added walnuts. And used it to top vanilla ice cream.
