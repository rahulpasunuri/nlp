Made this last night, and really enjoyed it. I love parsnips (and yes, they were a bit stinky while roasting), but didn't have quite enough, so threw in a celery root to top up the veggies. Was trying to decide between this recipe and the Celery and Parsnip soup with dill matzo balls on this website, and opted for this because I had no celery, but liked the idea of the two flavours together. The two roots worked very well, and flavours were mellow. Bacon and sour cream added to it (of course!). Will certainly make again.

Make sure to use "fresh" parsnips; not those that have been sitting on the shelf for long. Friends were salavating just from the smell as they roasted. I added two cloves of garlic with the onion, and added 1/2 tsp of cumin and 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper to the broth before pureeing the broth. Fantastic!

I made this recipe and then lost the clipped-out copy - I was happy to find it again on line. This was a great treat for the vegetarian (and non-vegetarian) family members. I left out the bacon entirely.

This is delicious and easy. I've made this soup many times, though I vary it ever so slightly by cooking the bacon first and sauteeing the onion in the bacon drippings, rather than using butter. I also use chicken stock, and just eveball the quantities. Not necessary to puree the parsnips after roasting. Definitely use a boat rotor (whatever those whizzy things are called) to puree at the end. I'd add a light chopped parsley garnish, too. Have served this to many guests as a first course, to very enthusiastic reviews and requests for the recipe.

I can't say exactly why this soup is a flop, but I guess it is just to parsnippy. And I love parsnips. If you, too, are a parsnip lover, I'd recommend the soup is the carrot, parsnip, and potato soup that can be found on this site. It is fantastic. This one, however, can't be salvaged, and as another reviewer mentioned. The roasting parsnips give off a strong, unpleasant odor. Not worth it at all.

This soup was OK in an odd sort of way. The parsnip flavor was too strong for my family. A word of caution - - if you make this soup for guests, be sure to roast the parsnips well in advance - - the smell of roasting parsnips is awful, like burnt rubber.

This soup is fabulous. I had guests at my home for dinner who loved it so much, they stopped on the way home for parsnips.
