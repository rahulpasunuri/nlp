This salad is very beautiful -- the ribbons of celery (I cheated by using a mandoline) are lovely. The celery seed croutons are amazing -- I've used them on all types of salad. Maybe the dressing needs a bit more work. I tried it again with a lime based dressing and liked it better. Play around with this one and find your favorite flavors -- if you find one you like it is worth the time because the presentation is nice.

this tasted really good. it was a big process to make. i would like to make it again but it seems to leave a lot of dishes. it is amazing how good it is for being celery. the croutons were very good too. i say you should make this, it doesn't take that long to do dishes.

the taste was a little bland, so I added a touch of garlic and chives.
