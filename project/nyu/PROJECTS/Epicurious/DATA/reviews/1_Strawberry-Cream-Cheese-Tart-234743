I made this a few years ago and made one for my neighbor too. When I recently made it again, I remembered why my neighbor got so lucky.... the crust & cream cheese filling easily make enough for TWO tarts, especially if you're using those standard french metal tart pans.

This recipe was an utter disaster for me. I'm not necessarily blaming the recipe--I could have made a mistake somewhere--but I followed the directions very carefully and the filling on the tart never set. A few notes: the crust is more like a shortbread crust than anything else. It's tasty, but heavy. My filling never set, so the tart was a runny mess, but even if it had set, I'm not sure I was thrilled with the taste. I thought it would be more like a cream cheese filling, but I could hardly taste the cream cheese. Finally, be warned that it takes forever to make the tart. I did the dough on Saturday, let it chill overnight, baked the shell Sunday morning, made the filling Sunday night, let it set overnight, and then did the strawberries on Monday night. And then she suggests letting it sit overnight again to set! So it's a slow process.
