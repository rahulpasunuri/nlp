I love this recipe and it a favorite of ours. I gave i three forks because I only love it when I make some modifications. With them, it is four forks. I add corn of one ear. I also triple the seasoning and also add 1-2tsp of dried cilantro.

Me and my husband are wild about this recipe. I have made it three times and it is really delicious. We like thinks more heavily seasoned so I add a lot more seasoning than noted in recipe. I double the spices and also add cilantro. I also double the onion and use red pepper instead of green pepper. This is one of my favorite mexican recipes.

Very easy to throw together for a fast dinner. It just was not as delicious as other chilaquiles that I have made. (Probably because there is less oil)

As written this is 3 forks. I gave it 4 because the changes are easy enough. Follow everyone's review and up spice & zucchini and decrease cheese (I used 6 oz). It's more like sw lasagna than authentic chilaquiles but is really yummy and even tastier the next day. Makes an unbelievable breakfast. Sauteed some chopped onion, heated chunked leftovers and scrambled it into scrambled eggs. Wow!

Definitely tasty and easy when you follow the other reviews. I skipped the cheese (though I'm sure it would be delicious) and topped with fresh guacamole and chopped scallions instead. Like the reviews, I doubled the spices and added a 2nd zucchini and 2nd green pepper to make sure there was enough for the pan.

This is tasty and easy southwestern style comfort food. The recipe seems very adaptable to individual tastes or whatever ingredients you might have on hand. I increased the herbs and spices to my taste (to me it was too bland as written), added two zucchini instead of one, and decreased the cheese a bit.

really good dish. I roasted the vegetables in the oven, adding an extra zucchini, two carrots and a jalapeno for heat - everyone loved it.

This was good - it didn't rock my world, but it was tasty, easy and fast. Recommended for beginner cooks. The amount of cheese to use is just a matter of taste. I used about half the amount called for, next time I will use a little more. I placed the tortillas only on the bottom of the pan, but in the middle layer I added some broken-up blue corn tortilla chips for a little crunch. The morning after I made it, I took a square out of the pan, cut a hole in the middle with a spoon, poached an egg and dropped it into the hole. It made a delicious breakfast.

This is really delicious and I'll be making it again. My modifications were to use 1/2 tbsp oil, 1 tsp chili powder, 2 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp ground cumin, and add green onions on top after baking.

We really enjoyed this and will make again. I used home cooked white beans that I had in the freezer instead of the black beans and used a little less cheese than called for. In the future I think I will omit the tortillas just to reduce the calorie count a bit. While they were tastey I didn't find them to be essential to the flavors of this recipe.

Easy, quick and delicious! I've made it twice now - once with regular cheese, once for vegans with "veggie shreds". Both times were delicious! It is also great cold the next day!

Great! Like a southwestern lasagna. I used a bit more seasoning than called for, but other than that, it was perfect for me. Might try using salsa in place of some of the tomato sauce next time. A good, family friendly, vegetarian meal.

Heathy and delicious! Enjoyed by all. Took me awhile to cut the veggies but I'm not a fast chopper yet.

I made this with canned chopped green chilis and a pretty spicy chili powder. It was pretty good for dinner with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt on top. It was even better the next day for lunch. I used a little less cheese and didn't miss it.

The vegetables are great. You definitely do not need all that cheese. It is still hugely flavorful with out it. FYI, the nutritional info listed does NOT include the tortillas, which pack quite a few more calories in.

FABULOUS! First time, made exactly as is, with 4 more ounces of cheese (used pre shredded jack/cheddar). Second time time changed beans for 3/4 ground beef (pre-cooked). Will be making AGAIN, very soon!

Maybe I was just really hungry, but I couldn't stop eating this. I followed the recipe exactly except spilled the chili powder in it so it got an extra dose. Topped with some lite sour cream it was a very satisfying vegetarian meal. I'm going to check out this cookbook.

Surprisingly tasty! Far surpassed my expectations. I omitted the green bell peppers and subbed in sriracha sauce for the chilis. The zucchini is a nice touch - mine came out nicely al dente and it's great to have a green veggie among all the sauce & tortillas. I'd say add another cup of cheese - 1 cup is not enough! This one is going in to my regular dinner recipe rotation.
