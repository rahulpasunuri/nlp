I doubled the asparagus and morels for six, sautéed them in butter with the shallot, and skipped the rest. I had Roast Pork Loin with Garlic and Rosemary from this site, on what turned out to be the hottest day of the year. Also served fingerling potatoes and a caprese salad--everything at room temperature. After we all went outside to watch a most unusual sunset, I served Meyer Lemon Semifreddo with Summer Berries (from this site). Cool, fresh.

Not bad, but the dish was overpowered by the beef flavor in the consomme

This is my favorite spring recipe...using both of my favorite ingredients. To me it is excellent.
