This was so easy and tasty. Turned tough winter beans into a delicious and attractive vegetable. This will become a family staple recipe for sure.

Iteresting recipe. Did not go well with my palate, but I'm sure others will like so I can't say don't at least try it one time.

Just so-so... not what I expected from the reviews. The onions had a lot of flavor but the beans were very bland. If I make this again, I would skip the steaming of the beans, and just cook them together with the onions and spices.

Good, easy recipe but was not wild about it. There are better recipes on Epicurious.

Just superb! Simple as pie, adaptable, quick to make -- and yet surprisingly complex and sophisticated. I've already made twice this season and figure the dish has already become a new summer standard in my house.

This is a very tasty and simple recipe that proved a perfect complimant to a pork roast. Everyone loved it. I will definitely serve this one again.

Delicious and simple. Just a word of advice; serve beans right away after adding onions. I had an unexpected delay in serving time and 10 minutes after adding the onions the beans had taken on a pasty, grey-green color. Still tasted okay, but not so pretty.

We tried this recipe last night with barbque, it was delightful. It is always a help getting new ways to have veggies. We loved the sweet and sour taste combo. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was straightforward and simple. Not to mention quite tasty. I don't feel it was quite up to a four-fork rating, but I'd make it again.

4 forks because of taste AND simplicity. A great side with a grilled pork chop. Perfect as is; fresh thyme works well also.

used dried rosemary instead of marjoram (it was all I had!) and otherwise, made it to the letter. it came out fabulous -- husband loved it and so did I.

Easy and a great side dish for almost anything.I used filet mignon and also served it with my bourbon salmon...everyone loved it.

I used snow peas instead of green beans because I had some on hand. It was excellent this way as well.

I used frozen green beans and they worked great. Canned might even be used in a pinch. Even my kids liked the green beans!

This is so easy and delicious. You can make the sauce while the beans steam, or even make the sauce ahead of time. I added garlic and rosemary because I don't love marjoram, but I'm sure it would be great either way!
