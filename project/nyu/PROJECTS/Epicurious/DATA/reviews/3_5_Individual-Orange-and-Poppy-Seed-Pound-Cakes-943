Everything a pound cake should be, not too sweet, nice crumb. I used half orange juice, half Contreau and left out the peel. It was baked 63 min in a 5x9 inch loaf pan.

I left out the poppy seeds, used concentrated orange juice, left out the peel and used butter flavored Criso plus 1 tsp butter flavoring. With large eggs it made 5 mini cakes. Better with a glaze. (I also added some food coloring to make it more orange colored.)

Made 5 mini cakes. Left out the poppy seed. No other changes to recipe. Delicious - and good for gift giving.

Wonderful taste and lovely aroma. Much praise. I used a tablespoon of Grand Marnier. Cut down a bit on the peel and added some orange juice concentrate to the juice of one orange. Delicious results. Make one 9 inch loaf and an 8 inch loaf.

I thought this was very good, but nothing to unbelievable or out-of-the-ordinary. I nice, solid recipe to use anytime though. I baked in two 9x5 loaf pans for the same length of time: 55 min. Excellent texture.
