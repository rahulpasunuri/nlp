Great recipe, except for the croutons which came out soft rather than crisp. The second time around, I just pan fried plain bread cubes with a little bit of peanut oil to get them golden brown and crisp.

While my wife appeared to genuinely like the dish, for me this was a little underwhelming. I enjoyed making the bread donuts, like others, but I found the rest of the dish to be not great. First, the quantum of saffron mayonnaise is crazy, unless you plan on heaping a huge amount of mayo on each piece of fish. The sauce looks great on paper but for me, didn't really deliver.

The recipe ingredients call for olive oil and shallots in the fried croutons, but doesn't include those 2 ingredients in the preparation instructions. I'm going to assume it's a typo and leave them out....did anyone else do it differently?

This was truly exceptional. I double the chourico, garlic, pepper ( I used Portuguese paste), and wine. The croutons are amazing. My husband called them "little donuts." I also added a few quarted dutch potatoes. It made a lot. My mussels were frozen in half shell. Totally worth it, restaurant quality!

Being huge fans of Rob Evans, I'd been wanting to try this recipe since it was published last October. As expected, he didn't let us down. My husband and I both agreed it was OVER THE TOP! Since we can only buy mussels in 2# bags I made the recipe as directed and saved half of the mussels and broth. The next night I sauteed some fresh tomatoes and garlic. I added the remainder of the mussels and broth, at the end, and served it over ziti. It was a quick and easy way to serve the leftovers and it tasted great. I'll be making this again very soon! Many thanks, Rob Evans.

This really is an excellent recipe. I made it just about exactly according to directions, except that I cooked the chorizo a bit before adding it to the broth. It is a pretty spicy dish (and I am not afraid of spiciness), but perhaps the chorizo I used was spicier than the norm. The croutons are easy to make and are delicious as they soak up the broth. I found the mayonnaise to be plenty flavorful...Lizbeth, you might try using a bit more saffron next time, or try a different brand.

I have a question for those of you who have made this dish yourselves. I mixed the saffron mayo last night to let it sit for tonight's dinner. Tested it at lunch; it still lacks taste. The saffron is new. The lime juice is fresh. EVOO and hot sauce in the mix. Ideas for improvement? Anybody?

Very nice recipe. I let the mussel broth simmer a little after adding chorizo. The croutons look hard but they ended up being easy and well worth it.

We loved this recipe. We cooked the hole thing in a boat, so it made this wonderful spicy sauce that soaked into all the ingredients - it was divine. The Saffron mayo, wants a little time to blend the flavors.

OMG! I definitely haven't had this at Hugo's but i did make it a few weeks ago and it was truly lovely - so lovely i'm writing a blog post on it (chiknpastry.com). the croutons can NOT be forgotten - they are crunchy on the outside but soft and pillowy on the inside. perfect!!!

I can't say that I've made this recipe but we ate at Hugo's last week and ordered it. Heavenly.

I ate at Hugo's this Summer and was delighted to find a recipe from what is now a favorite restaurant. I made this dish when we had friends over for dinner. What I loved about it is that much can be made in advance including the croutons, mayonnaise and mussels sauce. When it was time to prepare, all you had to do is poach the fish and re-heat the sauce. I love things that can be done in advance. The only modification I would make is to cook the fish longer or turn up the heat when cooking the fish. At 350 degrees, the fish took about 15-20 minutes to cook versus the 8 minutes listed. Also, I had doubled the recipe, but there is no need to double the mayonnaise since you use very little of what you make. It was very delicious and looked impressive. Croutons were softer than I had imagined but were fabulous because they soaked up the mussel sauce. I will make again.
