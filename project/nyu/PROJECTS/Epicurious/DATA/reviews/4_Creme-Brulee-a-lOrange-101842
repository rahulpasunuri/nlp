My first attempt at Creme Brulee, and I have to agree with "A Cook from Terrace, B.C." below on all counts. A flop and I wouldn't try this recipe again. It's probably my inexperience, so I'd say if this is your first try, find a "Creme Brulee 101" first.

I love this dessert! I also took out the orange zest after simmering in the milk/cream because I only wanted a creamy custard in the end and it turned out fantastic. Even with the zest and the grand mariner this creme brulee isn't overpowering with orange flavor. I would absolutely make this again

I made crème brûlée for the first time ever using this recipe - the recipe was easy to follow and got rave reviews! Will definitely make it again. I didn't have any liqueur on hand but found that I didn't need it as the zest created a wonderful flavour that wasn't too overpowering.

Used all cream, strained out the zest, and didn't add any orange liqueur. It was still strongly orange flavored, and delicious.

I think this recipe is great, although i dont use the zest, just use cointreau and a little vanilla.

This was really good. I did follow the advice of straining the orange peel. Just for info, I would bring cream, milk, and orange peel to simmer BEFORE mixing the egg yolks with the sugar. If you mix those two too soon, the sugar can "cook" the eggs and it just won't turn out the same.

I have made this dish several times. Every time it is a big hit. Sometimes, instead of using individual crème brulee ramekins, I use a shallow quiche dish to bake the entire crème brulee in one dish and then decorated it with some berries after caramelizing the sugar. I am not sure if that is recommended by good cooks, but that has also turned out great.

I didn't rate this recipe, because this was my first ever creme brulee and it was a dismal flop. The texture was off, the taste was weird and the top was sunken in the middle and difficult to brulee evenly. What a disaster! I'm sure the fault was mine, not the recipe's, but I think I'll look elsewhere for my next attempt!

Easy to make, recipe was well written and the food turned out perfectly...but I just didn't like the orange flavor with the custard. I know now that I prefer a vanilla creme brulee with fruit on the side.

This recipe was great! Super easy and, aside from the wait time, not time consuming at all. I think next time I'll cut down on the orange zest as the flavor was a little strong. I also used a culinary torch and it carmelized the top perfectly.

This was my first attempt at creme brulee and it turned out great. Folks thought it took much more effort than it actually did. And who doesn't love a dessert recipe that you can prepare the night before?

Unfortunately, the scorching of the sugar didn't work for me using the broiler. The sides were burnt before the interior even started caramelizing. After reading a bit more online seems that the hand torch method offers more control. So...with one day to go before Christmas Eve, I had to throw the batch out and am looking for another dessert message.

I made this for the adults for Halloween and everyone loved it this is a keeper! I used no milk just whipping cream.

This was my first attempt at making creme brulee and I'm pleased at how simple it is and how delicious they are. The orange flavor is a little extra surprise!

This is a great, easy-to-make dessert! I've made this several times and it is always with accolades. Use all cream, definitely strain for a smooth texture and refrigerate overnight. Garnish with fresh mint leaves and berries and you have the perfect finale to a great meal!

Wonderful recipe! I just love this creme brulee. My only criticism is that the orange peel should be strained out - otherwise, it is perfect! Will definitely make again.

Rating: 2
Easy and foolproof but too sweet. Also, the orange flavor was overwhelming even though I used far less zest than the recipe called for. Next time, I would reduce the amount of sugar, use just a splash of orange liquor and a few ribbons of zest for a more delicate flavor. Agree with the reviewer who stated it needed to be strained but disagree with the reviewer who used brown sugar to caramalize the top. Brown sugar does not caramalize well. It goes straight from being moist granular sugar to being little black burnt beads with no caramalization stage in between.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. The boyfriend who has never once said a dish was perfect, gave this one an absolutely perfect review. I made it in a souffle dish because I didn't have individual cups and it was fine with a little extra baking time. Also, I added some Grand Marnier to the top when I was burning the sugar and it created a great flavor on the top layer. Yum! What a fabulous dessert!

This was great and easy to make. I used all whipping creme instead of the whole milk and would definately recommend straining out the orange peel and air bubbles before baking to get a smooth product.

Oh man, this is my secret recipe. I have made this many, many times for family and dinner parties. It is so easy and WONDERFUL. Yummm.

Oh my, possibly my best Creme Brulee EVER...and relatively brainless, too! I made it two days ahead of time by accident, (sampling just one ramekin after the first day,) and I must admit the full flavor takes two days to mature! Forget the recommendation: don't torch the sugar until JUST before serving.

A very flavorful twist to the original creme brulee. I strained the orange zest out to provide a smooth texture. The kids loved it. Simple, fast, easy for the busy times in our lives.

This was a very easy recipe to make. I served at our cooking club dinner and everyone thought it was great. I topped the the creme brulee with rasberries tossed with a little Grand Marnier and sugar. Yum! Would definitely make again.

A lovely creme brulee - not too sweet and a nice, delicate orange flavor. Easy to make and everyone is impressed!

This is the best - throw some fresh berries on the plates. I used brown sugar - and bought a kitchen torch from Home Depot for $20 - and it does great.

Fabulous! A huge hit with our friends! I made it with all cream and strained the rind. A definite keeper.

A very lovely Creme Brulee. Disregard the previous review - maybe if she even remotely followed the recipe she would have had some success!

Instead of an orange flavor, we had lemon liquer from Italy, so decided to use a lemon taste in the creme brulee. i actually used lighter milk, so it didn't turn out as heavy. my family (particularly sister) thoroughly enjoyed it, but i wasn't as impressed.

this was a very good dish however, it did not have a strong enough orange flavor. actually, instead of using orange zest, take the zest from an entire orange and squeeze the oil from the zest and add that instead, that way the brulee isn't gritty with the zest. also don't just use the small amount of grand marnier they suggest. just dump some in and taste it. that's what i did and it came out great.

This is the best Creme Brulee! I did strain it before pouring into ramikins. It was then heavenly smooth! Also, if you put a cloth in the bottom of the pan before you fill it with water, the cups will not slip and slid. I used brown sugar for the tops and put them under the broiler just before serving, so that the top was warm and the inside was cool and smooth. The family raved!

I didn't have any Grand Marnier, and thought the subtle orange flavor from just the orange peel was perfect. I strained the custard before pouring it into custard cups and the texture was so creamy & smooth. A kitchen torch carmelized the sugar with very professional results.

this dessert was light and fresh after a heavy meal. i added extra grand marnier. i also mixed in some orange juice with the cream and milk while it heated. it made the creme brulee bring out a little stronger of an orange flavor.

Excellent taste for a creme brulee! Very easy to make and having a kitchen torch makes it easier to caramelize the sugar! Nice to have when you just want to eat one for yourself!

I made this for my boyfriend for a romantic evening, and was very disappointed. I may have done something wrong (but I've made pastries and other desserts all my life to great success), but it was too coarse for a creme brulee. The taste was okay, but it should be called a custard, not a creme brulee

Very tasty! The only problem with this recipe that I found was the cooking time was a little long. I would reduce it by 10 min.

WE USED ORANGE FLAVORED VODKA INSTEAD OF GRAND MARNIER. IT SEEMED TO WORK JUST AS WELL.

This was surprisingly easy and EXCELLENT! I couldn't find my copy of Bon Appetite, so I tried finding it on this site...Thank goodness I can make this again!
