We eat halibut every week and it was great to have a new version. This is wonderful especially the way we like to eat today,and considering it was published in 2003! I used Cara Cara oranges (the pink flesh ones) bought a bag at Costco. They are sweet and have no seeds and are so pretty. I also seasoned the fish with Trader Joe's 21 salute which I often use on fish. The dish had lots of depth and flavor. You can't get that from canned mandarins, Please use any kind of fresh citrus for the best result. This is worthy of company or for a weeknight meal. My husband who believes tomato based sauce's don't belong with fish LOVED this one!

My crew and I had one reaction I've not seen listed here -- while the oranges were fantastic as a vehicle for imparting flavor to the halibut while steaming (citrus-infused white fish - yum), they were definitely not something you wanted to eat in the finished product (fishy/olive-tasting oranges - yuk). Noting that it's a bit wasteful, I'd take the oranges out for serving the finished product. With that change, my rating would go to 3+ forks.

We loved this recipe. The only thing I forgot was the cilantro since it wasn't listed in the recipe. Will make it again and again!

I have made this dish many times -- both for guests and just for my husband and myself. It's a favorite.

The flavors are all over the place. Makes a light steamed fish but the overall result was disappointing. We do love all the ingredients in the dish, but somehow they didn't have much flavor in the end dish. I would not make it again.

I changed this recipe a lot because I had to use what was available for a later than usual dinner. Substituted olives for large capers (chopped) and chives for minced shallotts. Had to adjust for the amount of halibut but overall this was a really yummy dish and quite quick! Will try this with sea bass since halibut was really expensive!

I really enjoyed this. It was flavorful and fresh-tasting. I liked the kalamata olives and the topping of feta, which really made it work. A couple things I did that you might consider... I added some cayenne pepper for a kick, some fresh cilantro at the very end, some grated orange peel during cooking (as another cook suggested) and I went easy on the orange segments themselves (I was afraid too many would make it too sweet). I don't consider these major changes. It was fast, healthy and delicious.

I have been messing around with this recipe quite a bit. Here is what I do now: I use tailpia instead of halibut, 1 chopped fresh organge, 2 plum tomatoes diced, 1/2 c. fresh OJ, 1/4 c. minced shallot, 3 T fresh lemon juice, 2 1/2 T olive oil, 1/4 c. minced kalmata olives, 2 T capers, 2 t rosemary. I also use cajun seasoning and sprigs of rosemary on the tailapia in addition to the orange pieces. Very refreshing dish!

I used ocean perch. It turned out OK except for the oranges. I would use canned manderian oranges or tangerines next time.

Very simple and healthy...a favorite!

Very good. I used seabass instead because it was fresh, and it was melt-in-your-mouth good.

Ugh. The flavor combinations just did not "work" for me. The light, sophisticated look of the photo did not translate to the real thing...olives tomatoes and garlic are still present, what was I thinking anyway?

I have made this recipe for friends and family a couple times...it is fabulous! Light and healthy and a great mix of flavours. To the cook from South Tampa....canned oranges really don't give the same great flavour as fresh oranges! Next time spent the extra five minutes and segment the fresh, you will really notice the difference.

I'd do this dish again just for the halibut (sorry, old joke). The wife said it's a keeper, and she doesn't like fish. The only modification I made to this recipe was peeling and segmenting the oranges. I'm too lazy for that. I used a 15 ounce can of Mandarin oranges (drained) instead.

excellent and refreshing light dinner in a snap a must try.

I made this for the Family and the kids freaked out. It is great but not real child fare.

This was easy, interesting, and yummy. A great, healthy way to cook fish. I might add a few more olives and some orange zest next time to heighten those flavors. I used a couple of fresh tomatoes rather than canned and they were lovely.

We did not find this bland at all. Loved the tangy taste of the oranges with the sharp taste of the olives, sweet taste of the onion topped off with the cheese. My family continues to enjoy this one!

I made this for my gourmet club. Everybody raved about it. The fish was done to perfection. It is was the best halibut I'd ever had.

I really enjoyed this meal, great taste and a wonderful presentation.

This dish makes a great presentation, It is easy to prepare and has extraordinary flavor. I have prepared this recipe four times and each time it has been a hit.

I picked the recipe because I couldn't imagine tomatoes and oranges together. I made it for company (I seldom test beforehand) and everyone raved over it.

This was ok, but will not make it again. Quite bland, none of my guests would care to eat this again. There are much better ways to prepare halibut! Maybe adding more garlic would help.

This is one of the best dishes I've every prepared! It will definitely be a favorite to serve to guests because it's so good, so easy, and cooks quickly so I won't be a slave to dinner. Very impressive display too. Next time I will buy halibut that is all about the same thickness. The smaller pieces fell apart while I was waiting for the bigger pieces to get done. The only change I made was I added snapped asparagus and I omitted the chives. The asparagus added flavor and color to this dish. Very, very good!

This dish was fantastic. Myhusband loved it. The flavors reminded me of the Mediterranean, the Feta was a great touch. One thing I would ask other readers/reviewers to add is how to slice the oranges in an easier fashion?

This was very bland, I used fresh Alaskan halibut but no one at my table would want to eat this again

This was so great, it will become a family regular. If your spouse doesn't like fish, make this! I used frozen halibut filets, thawed over night, and wouldn't change a thing. Easy!

This had great flavor. I used cod instead of halibut and it came out great. Very easy to make.

This one's a keeper. Healthy, great presentation, easy to prepare and delicious. I served it with a risotto flavored with the zest from the oranges used in the recipe.

This was very tasty- I used mahimahi, which we used to call dolphin when I was growing up at the seashore. I left out the feta and it still had plenty of flavor

I am a cooking instructor and caterer in Portland, Oregon so I am very selective on recipes. I found this to be an outstanding dish -healthy, easy and upscale looking - all things that are important to me. A good weeknight dinner entree. I really appreciate reading reviews so I am trying to offer a few of my own!

Excellent; used Grouper and the flavors seemed to meld. Easy to make and definately would make again.

Fantastic recipe, well worth the effort. The combination of flavors was sophisticated and perfect. Served with a spiced couscous with toasted cashews that I molded in individual ramekins and turned out onto the plate. Oven roasted asparagus looked beautiful. A glass of white wine and my husband couldn't stop raving. This was what I would expect to be served in a fine restaurant. Will make it again...and again...and again.

I had a tough sell convincing my wife I should try this recipe let alone it would be good. Needless to say it was delicious. Definitely will make it again.

This was wonderful. The flavors blended wonderfully. I made a couple of changes, out of necessity and I am looking forward to trying the recipe again, as is. I couldn't get good Halibut, so I used Sea Bass. I quartered fresh grape tomatoes rather than using canned ones. The feta cheese with the sea bass was a wonderful combination, and the orange juice added another level of taste that was out of this world. Definitely a keeper. With the sea bass, you can cut the steaming time to 9 or 10 min. I served it with wilted spinicn with bacon, and that worked very nicely, also.
