Perfect dessert for a warm night! I had leftover ricotta from a plastic tub, and it worked fine. I tweaked this recipe a lot (I think it would be fine the way it is, I just had a lot of stuff laying around). I added a little lemon and orange zest, skipped the sugar and added 4tbls of honey, and sprinkled some lavender in. Also, along with the (tubbed) ricotta, I used marscapone instead of cream cheese, and added a few tbls of greek yogurt. Blended together it made a smooth, creamy, lightly sweet and floral mix.

There is a wonderful farm in my community which makes the best goat cheese and on rare occasions make a ricotta cheese with goats milk. I was looking for a wonderful vehicle for this cheese and I have certainly found it with this recipe!

I followed the recipe except for the fresh ricotta which we can't find here. I must say that the plastic tub ricotta did just fine, No grainy texture at all. I suppose it depends on the quality of the cheese. It was delicious. A bit less sugar next time. I think some grated lemon zest might be good too.

Easy and yummy! Made this with leftover ricotta when my DH needed something sweet on a cold winter night. Used 4 Tbs honey and omitted the sugar. Served it over canned cherry pie filling with 1/4 Tsp almond extract added and topped it off with mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. Will make again!

This was easy and so so delicious. Used regular ricotta from the tub with cream cheese. It did have a bit of a grainy texture to it, but it wasn't unpleasant, and didn't take away from the dish at all.

This made for a lovely dessert that's just a little bit special. Definitely use the fresh ricotta, as the stuff from the tub in the grocery store just will NOT get smooth! All guests liked this dessert...I shaved dark chocolate over the top as well.

This was amazing!!!! I made a blueberry crisp and served this on the side minus the berries. Everyone couldn't stop talking about it. Whole Foods was out of the fresh ricotta so I used a pre packaged one with the cream cheese. So good I made it again the next day!!!

It's a 3.5 forks. I've never had anything like this. It's creamy not too sweet, excellent with fruit.I will definitely make this again. Must use FRESH RICOTTA. I put in the cream cheese as well. I wouldn't change a thing.

Well, made this again with a regular ricotta and it was not nearly as good as when I used really fresh ricotta. This time, not wanting to be tempted by the leftovers, I used it as a base for pancakes. Add an egg, a little baking pwd. and a little bit of flour -they come out super moist, almost like bread pudding, and delicious with pure maple syrup.

Simply delicious. Creamy and not so cloyingly sweet like some desserts. I think I could eat this for breakfast!

If I make this again- and I'm not sure that I will- I'll leave out the sugar and add a little more honey if it's needed. Mine had a gritty, unpleasant texture.

A friend was bringing fruit salad to our bbq. I did not want to make another desert that would compete with it. The Ricotta complimented the fruit salad perfectly, as attested to by fruit salader and other guests.

I've been making this for some time now, and it is always superb. You really must use fresh ricotta, and I think the low-fat variety gives a better, lighter result. Also, try using maple syrup instead of honey.

Very easy to make and a nice change from ice cream and berries, which is one of my favorites. I'll be making this again.

I was surprised that the cheese mixture didn't set up at all. It stayed very runny and I had to serve it as a sauce over the berries. The flavor was good though.

Easy to prepare and everyone loved it.

This was a very light, delicious dessert. If the strawberries are large I would suggest cutting in quarters so they mix better with the smaller berries.

Delicious and so simple!!! It reminded me of the filling used for a cannoli. I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe is amazing! As we ate it, we all just kept staring at each other in amazement that something so simple could be so divine. I plan to make it again for a large family gathering.
