Delicious! Super easy and crisp and a great combination of flavors. I think I might have cooked the eggplant a little too long because it was a bit too soft and difficult to maneuver out of the pan. So maybe watch the heat on it.

I gave this 3 forks partly because this is a unique side dish with a great presentation. Overall it was just okay flavor-wise. I followed reviewers suggestions and didn't half the eggplant of the pepper. I bought a smaller eggplant made 3/4" slices in the smallest diameter part; topped with the pepper ring, etc. A mild dressing would be nice to moistened it up a little AND less feta.

A very nice, tasty, beautiful and easy dish! I made some changes based on the ingredients I had - so instead of butter lettuce I used baby greens and instead of bell pepper rings I finely sliced red, yellow and orange mini bell peppers and covered the top. Great with oregano!

The presentation is really nice and hard to screw up. We also did not cut the rounds in half. One thing to make sure of is to make sure and not use too much oil... those things are like sponges!

This is really yummy. I made it for my in-laws because they love eggplant. I followed the instructions, except I didn't cut the eggplant slices in half, either. I topped them with basil as well as oregano.

We followed the other reviews and did not halve the eggplant rounds. Leaving them intact provided a perfect surface for the peppers and feta. We used prepackaged roasted red peppers...delicious!

This is a great way to prepare eggplant, and the recipe is very easy. No need to cut the rounds in half, and the addition of goat cheese with the feta is nice. I used capers instead of green olives on top.

This was easy and delicious. It also looks great. I made several of the dishes in the menu and it was a great, easy party!

This dish was very good and easy to make, however, I don't think there is any need to cut the rounds in half. By keeping them whole and putting a pepper ring on top intact, it helps keep the feta from falling off into the pan. Also, just before serving I garnished with fresh basil.
