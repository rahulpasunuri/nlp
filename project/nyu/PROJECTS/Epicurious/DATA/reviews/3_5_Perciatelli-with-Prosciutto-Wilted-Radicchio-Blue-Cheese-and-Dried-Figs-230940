I really thought this would be great with all the different flavors going on but nothing about this wow-ed me. Disappointing. Not sure how to make it work.

Great flavors; seemed like more than 2 servings; i will use more pasta next time (there will definitely be a next time - yum!)

My boyfriend and I really liked this. Unfortunately, I couldn't find radicchio anywhere, so I used arugula. I know the texture and flavor is different, but it was still really good. I did add some cooking water, as suggested by others. I also used a really good gorgonzola and homemade linguine. Next time, I would prefer to use less prosciutto, but the BF loved it as is.

I would definitely make this again - BUT - save some pasta cooking water. I used gorganzola cheese instead and was very pleased. My only concern was the dryness. The cooking water will improve this dish greatly.

very delicious and easy to make. complex flavors-- the sweet fig, bitter radicchio and salty proscuitto is a beautiful blend.

I'd give this 4 forks, but my girlfriend, who's sitting behind me didn't care for it. An amazing mix of tastes and textures and didn't take much time at all. I would definitely agree with Pete about using a blue cheese that stands up to the other flavors. One last comment: the recipe says it makes 2 servings... I'm not sure who the authors of this recipe are serving, but you can serve 4 generously with this.

An extremely good, easy meal that I'll certainly make again. I used the spinach that I had instead of buying radicchio; this was a mistake, as the bitterness would have provided a nice balance to the sweetness of the figs and the sour of the cheese. Also, don't skimp on the olive oil, or the pasta will seem too dry.

I thought this was delightful. I did make a few modifications. First, since I have a family of high protein consumers, I sauteed chicken to serve as the main course and pasta as a side. I kept the chicken warm and sauteed the prosciutto to which I added several cloves of minced garlic and then added the other ingredients. I thought the radicchio mix was slightly bitter so I added a touch of balsamic vinegar to the mix which brought it to life and sweetened it up. I served the chicken topped with a balsamic glaze over the pasta.
