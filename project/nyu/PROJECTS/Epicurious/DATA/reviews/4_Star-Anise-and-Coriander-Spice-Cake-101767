This cake smelled and tasted utterly amazing. My guests all loved it. I topped it with vanilla ice cream, and strawberries macerated in cointreau and a bit of Splenda.

This is the most uniquely flavored cake I've ever had. I usually associate star anise and coriander with savory food, but they work remarkably well in this cake. I also agree with other reviewers about the baking time; checking after 40 minutes is a good idea.

This cake is amazing. My in-laws raved about it after I served with a Mediterranean themed meal.

Everyone really liked this. The spices were so interesting and not the usual that you'd expect in a cake like this. Very most and rich, and super easy to make. I served w/strawberries, which was great.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my husband loved it! It was our first Thanksgiving together and my first time making an entire Thanksgiving meal. The cake was a last minute decision and was a huge hit. I couldn't find star anise so used anise seeds instead. Quick and easy. Will definitely make again and again and again.

This is an odd cake and a HUGE hit. I'm making it for the third time - I've stuck to the recipe so far, but if anyone has tried anything different I'd like to read the comments. I've only made it with whole spices - this time I used a bit more of the star anise, but I think it would be possible to make with ground spices if star anise is hard to come by in your area. Next time I might add vanilla or a bit of grated lemon or orange peel. I did cut back a wee bit on the sugar, as we don't like sweets that are overly sweet. All in all a different type of cake that elicits many positive comments.

My mother loves anise, so I'm always looking for interesting recipes in which to incorporate it. This cake was really simple and delicious. Thanks for the tip about not baking too long...It did finish early.

This cake has been a hit every time I have made it (4 times). I served it with vanilla ice cream (the better the quality, the better) and sliced strawberries macerated with a little bit of rum and sugar. The berries bring out the flavor even more, for some reason. Be careful of the baking time. Begin checking after 40 minutes with a cake tester until it comes out clean. Over baking makes it a little dry.
