I made these for a themed party for the Opening Ceremonies of the Vancouver Olympics, and they went over very well. I was surprised at how easy they were to thread on the skewers since I had never done anything like this before. Followed others' advice and used canned coconut milk, actually lite. Since it is winter here in the 'Burgh, and my grill is on the deck covered with 30" of snow, I cooked them on a ridged griddle on my stove. Also, I marinated them for a couple of hours in a plastic baggie before I put them on the skewers.

This one is a keeper.Great use of ingrediants that can be applied to other dishes like a peanut-based, fried rice dish.

Delicious!! The recipe is great--the flavors are perfect together. To simplify things, I used 1/2 cup of coconut milk instead of the water, and I omitted the flaked coconut. It achieved the same results, just more convenient than blending and straining. (And one less dish!) I also loved the peanut sauce, but substituted 1/3 cup coconut milk for the water, since I had some remaining. I think the coconut milk made the sauce delicious, and there was a richness that water wouldn't have provided. And since there was still a little bit of coconut milk left over from the can, I added that to the water when I cooked my jasmine rice. Sure, there was a lot of coconut milk in this meal the way I made it, but it is an understated flavor that doesn't ovewhelm the dishes. I served the chicken skewers with jasmine rice (as previously mentioned), grilled pineapple and grilled asparagus. Yumm!

I have made this probably 12 times and have started to just use a can of coconut milk. works MUCH better than the flakes. I also take out a couple of tablespoons from the can to use in the sauce in place of the water. superb at room temp or hot

Delicious and so easy! I also made the dipping sauce both with the water and without; definitely do not use water! It was way to runny.

Dear Seattle, Yes you missed something. Click on the very small link 'Dipping Sauce' for the other part of this recipe. Excellent recipe, especially served on rice.

Am I missing something... where are the peanuts in the "peanut" dipping sauce?

I thought this was good, and served it to my dinner group. My only complaint was that the chicken didn't brown. Still, they were all gone!

The recipe calls for 2 whole breasts...not 2 half breasts. It shouldn't be too hard to get 8 cuttings out of each of 4 breast sections, unless they are from very skinny chickens. Maybe this was the problem.

I don't understand how this recipe makes 32 skewars- unless they cut the chicken into *slivers*. Also thought the chicken came out dry and the marinade was so-so. I'm sure there are better recipies out there.

This was great and very easy to make. It tastes just like the sate at my favorite Thai restaurant. I would make a few simple changes, though, as mentioned by other reviewers. 1)use coconut milk instead of coconut - the coconut just made a big mess and most of it was thrown away immediately anyway. 2)definitely use less water in the peanut sauce. I ended up making 2 recipes of it, one with no water at all, to make up for the runniness of the first batch. But overall, I would make this again.

This is the appetizer to make for any summer get together. It is so easy to make. Definately make the marinade and peanut dipping sauce a day ahead so you don't have to fuss the day of the party. The flavors are great, just like a Thai restarant. Not a single skewer was left!

A very good recipe! I allowed the chicken to marinate overnight and also made the peanut sauce a day ahead and everyone raved about how fantastic it was.

This was delicious! The sauce was tangy, but not too hot, and had great peanut flavor. Made it as written, but did not strain the marinade, and should have. Next time I think I would either strain the marinade or substitute coconut milk. Might also try rice wine vinegar to see how that works. I think this would make a good entree as well.

I have made this recipe many times, and my guests and co-workers all LOVE it. I just wish I would remember to just use a HIGH QUALITY canned coconut milk, rather then wasting time and energy processing the flaked coconut. The Dipping sauce, I feel, needs a few hours or overnight for the flavors to develop, and it is not a thick sauce, as I like for a sate.

Easy, fabulous, but the success is in the technique of grilling, as usual. We used a grill pan over a gas burner, nice and crisy outer, moist inner. Marinate for 3 hours, and let the peanut sauce meld a few hours before adjusting it's spiciness or lime flavors.

This is a good recipe and it went over with rave reviews during our Christmas celebration. Next time I will not strain the marinade. I thought the Dipping Sauce was a little thin but good flavor.

This recipe was a hit with the whole family. I will definitely make it again! The solid residue from the marinade smelled so delicious after the liquid was pressed out that I couldn't bear to throw it away. I stirred it into the batter of a focaccia, and served the loaf hot. Dipped in olive oil, the bread was as tasty and popular as the chicken.

This was a good recipe. The marinade wasn't too sweet and the chicken came out tender. If I make it again I will try it with more garlic. If it wasn't for the peanut sauce I would have found it too plain for my tastes.

why in the world does the author of this recipe think we are on a tropical island - it is so much easier to use coconult milk rather than the hassle of using shredded coconut - otherwise delicious!

I used about 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut in the marinade. I also pounded my chicken strips before threading them on the skewers. I am not a big coconut fan, but the sates were truly delicious and a big hit at my dinner party. I subsequently made the marinade using powdered ginger and marinated chicken wings before grilling: the marinade is definitely a keeper. Using a good curry powder does make a difference: my favorite is from Dean & Deluca.

I'm a big fan of peanut sauce and this one is really good.... my kids (who have been fussy of late) thought this was GREAT... A definate keeper.

It was better then I thought it was going to be. The garlic in it just hit the spot and not to spicy for my guest. They all thought it was great. Thanks once again when I had no ideas you helped me to find just what I needed.

This is my favorite sate recipe because it is quick, easy and tastes just like a Thai restaurant. For the marinade, I skip the blender part and just mix the ingredients together and put in the chicken. Simple! You can even skip the skewers if you're cooking on top of the stove. You do need to let it marinate for at least 30 minutes for the flavor to come through. For the sauce, I prefer old-fashioned chunky peanut butter for a little more texture and better peanut flavor.
