I made this in the skillet with minimal mess. Not only was it a great recipe, it's easy and quick too. I served it over brown rice.

OK Maybe I misread this but DO NOT microwave the leeks in butter for even 5 minutes at high power. When this was written maybe they had wood powered microwaves but mine totally nuked the leeks. I redid it and only cooked for 2 minutes then continued in the skillet. It turned out fine. Nothing spectacular but a very nice meal.

I think I will make this, as one suggested, in one skillet.Sounds very yummy, with basic ing.

Made it in one skillet as others suggested with no changes to ingredients. Was a good meal. Will play with seasonings more to give it a little something more.

Fabulous sauce. Another variation I made tonight was adding dill to the sauce & serving with salmon, all overtop some wheatberries with portobello mushroom. As others have, I sautee the leeks in butter then add the wine & cream & fish & poach the fish as the sauce reduces. Endless variations are possible with such an excellent foundation.

For some reason it had been years since I'd eaten sole, and the local fish market had some wonderful petrale fillets, so I bought some. This recipe went together in very short order, and like the previous poster I did it on top of the stove. It was delicious. Don't hesitate to try this during the week. I got home at 5:00, and dinner was served at 6:00, and that gave me time to relax with a glass of wine midway through. I added a bit of minced tarragon to the leek sauce, and thought it worked quite well. Next time I might add a handfull of shitakes, but it's great as is. I'm not sure how different petrale sole is from dover, but the petrale fillets were nice and substantial...3/4 lb each...and had a very nice flavor.

I did this all in a skillet, with great success. Sauteed the leeks, added the filets over the leeks to poach while the wine and cream reduced. Very moist and flavorful -- a delicious option for fish. I just don't understand why the original recipe had all that stuff about using the microwave in the first place -- just a waste of effort and extra dishes to clean.

Stupendous. Incredibly easy, fast, and tasty. This is a keeper. I didn't use the microwave either. I melted the butter in a sautee pan and cooked the leeks over medium heat until they were softened. I then added the wine and 1/2 & 1/2 (not cream). I probably should've added the 1/2 & 1/2 first, but it came out just fine. Thanks to a tip from a previous reviewer, I placed my three sole fillets on top of the mixture and let them poach on medium heat for ~15 miutes (until all were flaky). I served this over plain white rice.

I didn't use the microwave at all and I thought this dish was really great. I did this with fluke - first I sauteed the fluke in butter. Then, in the same pan I sauteed the leeks, then added wine and then cream (actually half and half). Very delicious.

This is quick, simple and great tasting IF you do not follow the directions. Why use so many dishes and steps when just sauteing the leeks in a skillet, add wine, then cream and finally poach the sole on top while the sauce is thickening. It is so much simpler this way. My proportions of wine and cream may be different than the recipe called for since I go by my own preferences. Probably less of both. The sauce has a rich, creamy and slightly sweet taste which is a wonderful complement to the delicate sole.

I made the Sause and used it with west coast true cod [ that and ling cod being exceptional this time of year] It was wonderful! Served it with sauted green beans, washed it down with Hogue Fume Blanc. Great meal. Oh yes, I baked the cod and only used the microwave for the leeks.

I liked the sauce, but I was not crazy about sole cooked in the microwave. Such a delicately flavored fish really needs to absorb some seasoning while cooking, in my opinion. I may try the sauce again with something else, such as chicken or salmon perhaps.

in absence of heavy cream, and against my better judgement, used half and half. sauce broke up. still, good flavors and easy. I baked fish and poured off juices as directed for sauce. 2 SMALL leeks only, or 1 large leek. tarragon might be nice addition.

I loved this dish. I served it with orzo and peas. The leek sauce was delicious with this as well. I baked the fish instead of using the microwave.

To: Cook from London, Ontario on 01/18/02: Instead of the "white on white" how about a side of wild rice & rice (brown or white)pilaf that has dried diced fruit, toasted nuts and shallots or chives added in. Gives different texture/color. Just a thought.

A very easy recipe. Foolproof. Sauce is very delicate. A definite keeper. Would like some input from cooks on the best way to present this delicious dish for company. I served it on mashed potatoes with a green vegetable on the side. Not very eye-pleasing.

Super recipe for everyday (or even a dinner party). Will become a standard in my repetoire. Very easy to make and very tasty. Suitable for food-novices and gourmands alike.

Surprisingly quick and easy to make; a definite keeper. My husband (a true meat and potatoes guy) raved - not a small feat. Good enough for a dinner party.

I used John Dory instead of sole and it was still delicious. Amazingly quick and easy as well. Be careful not to overcook the fish. The dish was reminiscent of the food at a fabulous French resturant I would frequent for lunch in Scotland.

My French husband loved this. We are doing Atkins and found the texture of the leeks to be reminiscent of pasta (a nice treat). Very simple and tasty - not outstanding but I prefer recipes with a little more kick.

This is a very elegant recipe that was ready in less than 30 minutes. It was fabulous.
