Had this at a party and had to get the recipe. Amazingly simple in ingredients and preparation, but huge on flavor. I agree with another reviewer, I sometimes crave this dish, especially in the summer. I've made it several times for guests to rave reviews, every time. I've also varied the nuts and cheeses. Yum!

This is the first time I've reviewed a recipe, I must admit. Thank you to all of you who do it regularly- I appreciate it! I'll now add my two cents as I couldn't resist. This is AMAZING! The chicken does need to cook longer as it was raw in parts. I sauted in shallots & oil for a few mins to finish cooking and then combined w/the pan juices (minus some fat, plus a tsp soy). Dressing was perfect as is although added dill instead of thyme, which was great! Can't go wrong w/this recipe!! Used only 2 breasts, halved the dressing ingreds and enough for four.

I have made this salad almost a dozen times, in both large and smaller amounts, and always get rave reviews! I actually crave it, from time to time, and make it just because.

This is tasty and very easy to make. I like that I can prepare each component ahead of time, then assemble the salad when we are ready to eat.

I've made this twice now for shower menus and each time it has earned rave reviews. Very simple ingredients but the textures (velvety chicken, crisp green beans) and flavorful dressing combine to make a truly memorable dish. I use haricots verts for a more sophisticated presentation, toast the walnuts, and use garlic olive oil for the dressing. Really really delicious.

I have made this recipe several times since I first tried it back in 2001. It is delicious and -- in my opinion -- very unique. I love the idea of using green beans as a main ingredient in a salad. I wondered if the salad would be a little bland because the recipe has limited ingredients, but, instead, it is continually rich and interesting. It's also pretty quick to prepare, as well as healthy, so it's great summer dish.

A very versatile recipe. I've made it as described above. I've also switched out cheeses, greens, use pre-marinated chicken, etc. and it always tastes wonderful.

I have made this salad many times. I first made this for a shower luncheon and everyone loved it. I am making it again for my book club and look forward to hearing what everyone has to say about it 13 years later.

Everyone loved this colorful and tasty dish which I served at brunch along with the Angel Hair Frittata.

I've made this a couple of times and have noticed that everyone who's eatten this salad love it. The chicken is moist and flavors wonderful. I've sustituted asparagus when it is in season.

This was good but not the best chicken salad recipe of its type. I believe this is mainly due to the method and ingredients for cooking the chicken. The marinade produced an oily and tasteless chicken, especially with cooking the chicken for so litle time. The chicken needed to be cooked at least another 15 minutes in the oven to be done. Also the dressing needed to be seasoned a bit more. I toasted the walnuts first to make the flavor come out.

I made this as part of the menu for our annual St. Patrick's Day party, and everyone loved it. I cooked the chicken a bit longer than 20 minutes, as it wasn't quite done at that point. I think dried thyme would work as well as fresh, also.

made this salad for a potluck -- it was delicious, and i got lots of compliments. the recipe is huge, and i cut it down to about 1/3 of the size somewhat successfully (the potluck was for 10 people). i gave it 3 rather than 4 forks only because it is slightly bland. if i make it again i might try using more herbs in the dressing and while baking the chicken. also, it's probably better made in the summer, as the original article suggests!

This is a wonderful salad - I have made it with and without the chicken and everyone just raves about it!

This recipe is a classic. I've made it for countless baby & wedding showers and birthday brunches over the last decade. It always gets rave reviews.

I made this 10 years ago for my best friend's shower and made it again this year for my sister's shower. I will not wait 10 years to try it again! I doubled it to serve 35 guests and had little left over. I served it both with and without the nuts (to account for potential allergies) and received rave reviews for both versions.

Made this for a celebration luncheon when the recipe first appeared -- and I return to it at least once ayear. Never fails to surprise and delight.

Very good, I used feta cheese instead of goat cheese and rosemary pecans (made from a Gourmet magazine recipe) instead of walnuts.
