Be aware that 3 dashes of orange bitters is missing from the ingredients list. It was in the original Bon Appétit recipe. Fabulous for entertaining during the holiday season. Cheers!

Very good. Great riff on a negroni.

Very tasty!! I thought it's going to be v strong and alcohol-ly, but the clementines made it sweet but not too much. Thank you Laura in SF for the orange bitter alternative. Will definitely make again very soon.

Yes, I was wondering about the bitters we were supposed to have advance knowledge of in the directions. The Negroni is a favorite of ours and this one is a fantastic twist. Even without the orange bitters, which I will obviously have to go find now. Yet another reminder that it's best to read the reviews before doing the shopping...

this recipe leaves out the 3 dashes of orange bitters called for on the bon appetit site.

We are regular drinkers of the Negroni, our weeknight cocktail of choice. Adding the clementine factor added just the right seasonal touch. Fantastic.

This is a fabulous, complexly flavored cocktail. I had a surplus of Satsuma mandarins, which I juiced instead of muddling. I made this to serve 6 and froze 6 slices of mandarin in advance as garnish. I also made my own orange bitters (vodka + strips of clementine peel + cardamon seeds + coriander seeds) and put a couple of dashes in each martini glass. W-O-W. Will be making this one again!
