I took others' advice and monitored the cooking time. The strusel can be a little wet, but over all still a great pie. I substituted peaches for the apricots and walnuts for the hazelnuts (local grocery can be limited) and it turned out very tasty. A little milk and leftover pie in a bowl the next A.M makes a yummy decadant start to the next day.

I thought this was really delicious. I halved the sugar mixed in with the fruit, put it in a 400 oven but reduced it immediately and cooked it at 350 for 1/2 an hour and 375 for another half an hour after adding the streusel. It was a huge hit. The crust dough was so wet I thought it would be tough, but it wasn't.

Hate to be a naysayer when everyone seems to love it, but I wasn't crazy about this recipe. Thought the crumb topping was way too thick--took forever to become anything other than mushy in the oven and by that time the bottom crust was overcooked and tough. The fruit filling was good but also overcooked using the times in the recipe.

I judge my baking by how many people want the recipe, and this pie prompted approx. 90% of my 'guinea pigs' who tried it to ask for the recipe! However, the cooking time is too long. On my second attempt, I reduced the baking times from 45 minutes and 50 minutes to 35 minutes and 35 minutes respectively and almost no juice boiled over.

I loved this pie. Made it over the summer when apricots were plentiful. The only thing I would change is the cooking time. WAY TOO LONG! The first time many of the juices bubbled over and burned onto the cookie pan I placed it on. The second time I only baked it for 50 mins and it was perfect!

This is the best apricot/raspberry pie combination I've ever made or enjoyed! Its my mom's favorite pie. I've never had trouble with timing or any ingredients. I did not care for the crust though. I prefer to use the cream cheese crust in The Pie and Pastry Bible.

I loved this pie. I've found that the cook time varies from oven to oven so it must be watched. I have a hard time finding hazelnuts so I substitute various nuts from walnuts to macadamia and it comes out fine. I've also found that cherries work well if you can't find raspberries.

Someone really goofed on the cooking times. I wound up with much burned juice on the cookie sheet and on the edges of the pie plate cooking for only 30 minutes. I would estimate 15 minutes for the first and 15 for the second would be plenty.

I'm unable to obtain fresh apricots so I used peaches with the raspberries. I did not cook it as long as the receipe required. I took it out when my instincts said it was done. It was delicious. I will make it again!!

I rarely bake and I never eat apricots...but decided to try this for company. It was delicious. I used a pottery pie dish and covered the crust edge w/alum. Mistake!! Crust was a little weak. Don't worry about the cooking time, but remember the tray under the piedish as the pie oozes as it cooks.

To answer the previous reviewers question: I admit I haven't made this pie, but I did attempt the blueberry pie with lattice crust from this same series of pie recipes. Note I said "attempt"-- you are very right to be wary of this baking temperature and length of time. I wish I had been-- my pie was a disaster! Burned crust, and an oven that had to be cleaned gradually over a matter of weeks were some of the downsides! If you do try this one, follow your gut, and pull it out of the oven when it looks ready.

Want very much to make this pie but am afraid that any fruit pie that is in a 400 oven for 90 minutes will take me four days to clean the oven afterwards. Can this be correct directions?
