I thought this was an ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE recipe!!! It was SO BAD I rinsed off my vegetables. I would give it NO forks if I could.

actually, it is a very bad idea to microwave leafy greens. studies have shown that they lose a great deal of their nutrients that way. even worse is to microwave things covered in plastic, as some of the plastic molecules end up in the food. i'd recommend steaming the broccoli rabe in a double boiler instead. it will still be bright green, but much healthier.

For a girl that normally has to force herself to choke down winter greens, this was great. I didn't do the microwaving, I just started by sauteeing the carrots with 2 cloves of garlic, some olive oil and a little bit of fresh grated ginger until they were close to tender, then added in the chopped raab until it close to wilted, then added all the rest of the ingredients for the sauce. I misread the recipe and used a Tbspn of apple cider instead of apple cider vinegar, but also added in the Tbspn of balsamic for good measure and it was fantastic. Ate it hot, ate it all :-)

Very nice dish that features a nice subtle melding of flavors. Excellent accompaniment to fish. I used the sweet vermouth and cider vinegar version and it worked nicely. Also loved the ease and speed of preparation. The sauce also worked well on the fish when I tryed a little left over on a bite!

I was really surprised at how good this was and easy as well, a definite keeper. I didn't have any sweet sherry so I substituted mirin (a sweet Japanese cooking wine) and used balsamic vinegar instead of the cider vinegar.
