Best raw cranberry recipe I've made. the roasted pineapple makes it. Next time I might try canned pineapple since the pineapple shrinks and caramelizes. I made it a few days in advance and I think I liked it better the first day. Served it with turkey. Everyone loved it.

My family was skeptical of trying the salsa when I told them it was Cranberry Pineapple salsa but everyone loved it. I made the recipe exactly as written and making it again this year.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and I plan to make it again this year. We had family staying with us and they were all very skeptical when I was roasting the pineapple the day before but when we tasted it the next day they definitely approved of the results.

This is a terrific recipe! We used a lot sugar but, it was still delicious.

Much better the next day when the flavors come together. Next time I'll add the cilantro after chilling and before serving.

Very interesting combination. I used less cranberries and less sugar than the recipe asked for and added chopped fresh serrano peppers (my salsas are always very spicy). I had some charcoaled pork slices and I made what I call "almost tacos al pastor" tacos, on corn tortillas. This salsa replaced very nicely the pineapple and cilantro/onion toppings used on the real tacos al pastor in Mexico City.
