The chutney did not gel even after spending the night in the fridge. The thyme is strong. A good pairing with an English Cheddar. I was hoping to serve with Brie but will stick with the jar of mango chutney.

Mine came out soupy -- not like chutney at all. Am I doing something wrong? Probably. But wouldn't make it again nonetheless.
