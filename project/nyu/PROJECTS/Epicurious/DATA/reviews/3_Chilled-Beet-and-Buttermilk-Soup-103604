Really good! I followed the instructions with the alterations suggested by other reviewers--less vinegar, a bit less sour cream, a bit more buttermilk. It turned out perfectly, and it's a knockout color. Try serving it a blue bowl-- gorgeous.

Exceptional. The best advice is to use the vinegar to taste - don't blindly follow the recipe. This should NOT taste vinegary - only acidic enough to bring out the natural flavor of the beets. I used raspberry vinegar, probably a bit less than the recipe dictates, likely more sour cream than the recipe, and a considerable amount of fresh-ground pepper to give it some bite. The result is amazingly smooth and subtle, and the color is absolutely gorgeous, especially for the holiday season.

I did not like this, and I usually like beets. Bland and sour and definitely needed more umph.

I love this soup, although it's best blended in a blender rather than a food processor. I also use all buttermilk and omit the sour cream to make it "lighter" in calories.

I've made this numerous times and my husband and I absolutely love it. Wonderful color and perfect for a hot day. It's one of the only recipes I make again and again.

I am not a fan of "harvard" beets and this soup could simply be a puree out of a sweet-and-sour jar from the supermarket. On the other hand, one guinea pig for this recipe loved it so I guess it's a matter of taste. I would also omit the sour cream - who needs the fat - and instead put a dollop on top of the soup and sprinkle with chopped chives. oh yes. some added salt is needed.

I loved the color (hot pink) of this soup, but it tasted too tart for me. All I tasted was the vinegar and sour cream.

This soup is amazing in every possible way--color, taste, texture. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. A real find.
