I recommend this if you know your crowd enjoys the taste of giblets. Maybe it isn't the best recipe for a large group, though.

Count me as another who has used this recipe since it was first published! It's the best I've ever tasted, and while I often test other recipes, this is the one I always come back to, and I wouldn't consider Thanksgiving complete without it. Thanks for putting it in the data base, BA, because even though I have every copy of BA since about 1972, they are currently packed up, and I was facing a huge task to locate it again!
