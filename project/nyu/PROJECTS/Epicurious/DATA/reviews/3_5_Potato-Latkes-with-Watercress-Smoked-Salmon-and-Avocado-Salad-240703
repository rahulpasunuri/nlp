I have to agree with my sister: this receipe rocks. The ingredients are virtually the same in all latke recipes (I use matzah meal instead of flour, however) but chopping (instead of shredding) and the final baking step were new to me. This technique is a winner!

I made the latkes only- they were delish. I would chop the potatoes in two batches in the food processor to make sure it all gets chopped without getting over pureed. The taste and texture was excellent

I loved it!!! i didn't have watercress and used regular lettuce but the combination of the salmon and the potatoe latkes with the salad were amazing and I was surprised how much I liked it. So healthy and easy to do as well. First timer for the latkes as well. They were so rich and creamy. I fried them the first time but my hey sticked too much to the pan. I will do the whole thing all over again

This was my first attempt at making potato latkes and the result couldn't have been more delicious or novice friendly. Be sure to really squeeze the potato/onion mixture since the recipe calls for very little in the way of binders - one of the reasons I selected this recipe over others. I put the latkes in the oven for about 10 minutes and didn't flip them and they came out beautifully. The salad was also delicious and went perfectly with the latkes. I did, however, add about 1.5 teaspoons of honey to the dressing to sweeten it up (I also added a few quartered cherry tomatoes). I only made half of the salad since I was cooking for two but my husband and I ate every bite and nearly all of the latkes! Enjoy!

This is a great combination. I had most of the ingredients, but I didn't really have time to cook it everything from scratch, and I wanted a nice lunch - I subbed some items and it worked out nicely. Latkes: you could use the pre-made and frozen Ikea potato cakes (Rösti) and fry them in a little oil and then cool them off in the freezer. Powdered mustard: just use Dijon if you only have that. Watercress: mesclun works fine, prob not as spicy, but a nice mixture. I also layered it (rather than tossing it) as follows: Potato Pancakes bottom, then avocado, then greens, then salmon, drizzle a little remaining vinaigrette over the top so it drizzles down over all.

Cool salad! I used lime juice on the salmon and everything was just yummy. Recommend it!

I ignored the latke recipe since I have my own but this watercress salad was a great, refreshing delicious foil for the richness of the pancakes.
