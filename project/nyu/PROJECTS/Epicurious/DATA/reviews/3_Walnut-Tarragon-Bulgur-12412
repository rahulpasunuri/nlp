Simple to make and very flavorful. I don't like raw onions or shallots, so I sauteed the shallot in olive oil first, instead of adding the olive oil later.

Not good. The shallot overpowered everything. After tasting it, I had to saute the whole thing just to make it edible. IF I make it again, I'll use a quarter of the shallot and possibly saute it first!

The recipe is much better if you double everything but the shallot. The shallot is overpowering otherwise. I also added pimentos and it gave the recipe a little extra depth. I will make this again.

excellent flavor. Served with lamb sausage patties with mint and feta, from this site.

I listened to another reviewer and added raisins and cinnamon. Made the salad really fantastic. I can see how it would've been ok without them, but the additions really made this one a 4-forker. It also benefited from sitting overnight. Gave the flavors a chance to really meld.

Make it a 4 fork by adding the following: a dash of cinnamon, 5 chopped pitted dates, and 2 tblspns of raisins. Goes with everything!

I recently had this dish served to me at a friend's dinner party, and thought it was so delicious, I asked her for the recipe. A very pleasant melding of taste and texture, and it was perfect served alongside grilled salmon.

See the reviews for BULGUR AND LENTIL SALAD WITH TARRAGON AND WALNUTS Gourmet July 1994. It is the same recipe.
