I had my doubts about this one, but I've made an impromptu chicken curry and cauliflower curry with it and they were both delicious. My modifications: I used whole mace and I added more turmeric.

This recipe is a very good basic curry blend for western palates. A great start for the curious or novice. For the more adventurous, try adding what many consider the most important ingredient; FENUGREEK SEED, POWDERED. This spice is reponsible for the curry smell some love others hate. The underlying flavour is unmistakable and the bitterness suggests that a little goes a long way. Blended Fenugreek LEAVES (Methi) are also excellent in a 50% blend with Corriander (Dhunia) leaves to add a fresh taste to curries, specially chicken leg/breast bone in quarters. Most bigger Indian stores will have the leafy products as well.
