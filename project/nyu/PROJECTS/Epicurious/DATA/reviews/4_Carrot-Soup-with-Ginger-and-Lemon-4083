I followed the recipe with the exception of using grape tomatoes instead of beefsteak and greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It was delightful! The ginger and lemon make it perky. The carrot and tomato give it body. I made this for a friend recuperating from surgery and it didn't bother her stomach AND provided lots of nutrients. I'm looking forward to eating the leftover for lunch.

A very good soup, but not amazing. Perhaps a little bland? I served it with whole milk yogurt; YUM. I'd make it again, maybe upping the amount of lemon peel? I halved the recipe and that was enough for 3 people.

I made this exactly according to the recipe directions. IT. WAS. AMAZING. I didn't even season it with salt or pepper. From the first spoonful my husband went wide-eyed with joy. It was so bright and fresh. I added freshly ground pepper into my own bowl, just because I thought it was a good dimension to add the the already stellar soup, but it certainly didn't NEED the shot of pepper. Everyone has a different palate, but I'd say this is a crowd-pleaser, in general.

Giving this just 2 forks, not because it isn't good-- it is. It's just not great [which in my books would rate a 3 or 4]. I enjoyed it but probably won't make it again. My Mom, however, loved it and asked for the recipe. I think there must be better carrot/ginger soup recipes out there. If you know of one, do tell!

There are already a lot of reviews for this soup but thought I'd add my two cents. It's a great, easy and fast soup. The swirl of sour cream at the end is a must. I didn't change anything and it was great. Took a longer than suggested for my carrots to cook. Just meant an extra glass of wine to cure the boredom. Enjoy. : )

One of my favorite recipes - I literally feel healthier with every spoonful. But it is also hearty & flavorful enough to sustain. I sub olive oil for butter & use veggie stock... allowing me to justify an extra generous dollop of sour cream!

I quadrupled this for a party and it was fantastic. Just finished the last little cupful. I loved the ginger and used preserved lemons (which I always have in the refrigerator). Delicious. Even people who didn't think they wanted carrot soup loved it.

I had all the ingredients straight from the farmers market--it was delicious as written and my whole picky family ate it! I didn't see the need for sour cream in such a healthy soup so we went without it. If I make again for company, I will probably add some green garnish-cilantro sprig or something-just for the presentation. I can't wait for lunchtime leftovers!

Wow, really? Other reviewers recommended adding extra ginger and I find the ginger already just a little bit too strong. I made the recipe to the letter, and found the layers of tastes really delicious and interesting. The color is beautiful too! I added 2 teaspoons of soy sauce in the end instead of salt to balance the ginger. Really good!

I served this last night as the first course and everyone loved it. I made it just as prescribed, though I didn't really measure the lemon peel and might've added a bit more. I also used ginger from a tube because it was on hand. In any case, absolutely delicious. Also, I doubled the recipe and made a day ahead with no ill effects.

Rating: 4
This soup exceeded my expectations. Delicious. I doubled the ginger and garlic, and I added a quarter cup of orange juice and a sprinkle of cumin. I pureed it in the blender as briefly as possible, so it would be more brothy and less babyfood-ish. Turned out bright and flavorful.

Rating: 2
Too acidic for me!

Rating: 4
I used orange juice and zest as I had those. Eliminated butter and used 1 Tbs extra virgin olive oil. Doubled the ginger AND added 2Tbs fresh pressed ginger juice (I buy this online- worth the shipping cost!). Then I sauteed four links of vegetarian apple/sage sausage (Field Roast brand), sliced them into small pieces and added after pureeing the soup. Fantastic, healthy, and hearty!

Rating: 3
Definitely need to double or even triple the recommended ginger. If ginger is in the name of the recipe, you better taste it. I used my immersion blender and the texture came out thick but smooth. I loved the lemon and thought it was an interesting compliment to the carrot flavor.

Very delicious! When the soup was completed, I passed HALF of it thru my Chinoise to get that super velvety texture! I also served homemade parmesan crisps on top and on the side. I did have to add some salt at the end. A beautiful bowl of soup for sure!

I made this soup for a dinner party. This amount made a perfect demi-tasse first course for 9. Made just as directed, except with a can of rotel (tomatoes are not in season) and without the finish of lemon juice, which I will not omit next time. Fresh and simple with great flavors, I'll definitely make it again!

Rating: 3
I left out the lemon since I didn't have any fresh on hand. Doubled the garlic and ginger and used more onion and canned diced tomatoes since that is what I had on hand. It still needed a little something, so I added 1/2 tsp curry powder and that made the difference for me. Next time I'll be sure to have the lemon on hand.

Rating: 3
Yum! This is a very warming soup, especially when you double the amount of ginger. (I recommend it). Also, I was out of tomatoes but used a small can of fire roasted diced (I drained it for a few minutes first) instead and it added some heat. Easy, delicious & healthy. Not too bad.

Rating: 4
how much recipe tweaking can you do before the recipe is no longer the recipe? this was my dilemma. I doubled the garlic and ginger, but that one change alone made for a pretty bland product. the texture was also weird. It seemed more like baby food than soup. added 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp cardamom, a little more ginger and garlic, and enough additional chicken broth to give it a soupy consistency. the citrus really rounded out the flavors nicely.

Rating: 4
What a fantastic soup. I brought it to a soup party and did not know that the best soup would win a prize. This one came in first place! I did puree it with a hand blender which is easier than pouring into a blender. I used canned crushed and seeded italian tomatoes which worked fine for the acid and was not too strong in taste or color.

This is a marvellous soup. The only slight (and non-essential) variations I have made have been to caramelize the onions for a little longer, and to double the recommended amount of ginger, which gives it that bit more oomph! Also, I have sucessfully used a spoonful of tomato paste as a replacement for the tomatoes.

This soup is really just wonderful! I doubled the garlic and ginger, plus added a little cumin and nutmeg to the onions, which gave this already flavorful soup an extra layer of flavor. Garnished with chopped carrot greens and grated carrots--a real beauty. Am definitely going to make this for Thanksgiving!

This was okay. The flavors were nice, but I wasn't crazy about the pulpy texture. I would strain it & thin it next time. Also, I think it would be nice with a little something, maybe honey or curry powder? I would eat this as a side or an appetizer, it's a a lot of carrot for a main. I would probably try another recipe next time.

This is the best carrot soup I have ever had. I made it with vegetable broth and topped with sour cream. It has a clean citrus flavor that hints of ginger. Beautiful color.

Delicious! The ginger & lemon flavors add the perfect zing to the carrots. Per other reviews, I increased the garlic & ginger and I was very happy with the flavors. Definitely use both the lemon zest & the juice. I also decreased the amount of onions and increased the carrots. For more kick, I added some white pepper & cayenne; also used both fresh tomato & tomato paste. Leftover soup will thicken up, so extra broth is needed to thin it out. Will definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
Agreed that half and half makes it nice and creamy. You will really impress your guests and family if you grate some carrot on top of the soup when you serve it with a dallop of sour cream. The grated carrot on top of the soup gives it a great consistency. I also used an emersion blender to help puree, much easier than a blender.

I was surprisingly underwhelmed by this recipe. The general recipe is OK, but it definitely needs a kick or something extra (I added honey and hot curry mix to mine).

This is a really good soup. Pick fresh sweet carrots and ripe tomatoes to ensure that you get good flavors. I added at least twice the ginger for a stronger ginger taste. At the end, I stirred in some half-and-half and heated again. I also used the immersion blender which made for a slightly chunky version (as opposed to running it though the blender or food processor). YUM! The whole family loved it! We'll make this again (& again!)

I followed the recipe as written, with generous ginger, garlic and lemon zest I used a meyer lemon for the peel and the juice.

I just served this for Easter dinner, making it the day ahead, and it was a hit. I used 2 lb. of carrots and increased the amount of chicken stock to one large can, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. The lemon juice makes all the difference in the flavor (tasing it before and after adding the juice). Would certainly make this again. Instead of using the blender, which can be tricky, I used one of the hand-held blender wands - everyone should have one of these kitchen gadgets!

Rating: 4
This was absolutely delicious. I can't wait to make it again. My revisions: I used 1 cup of caramelized onions that I had on hand and 1/2 cup of chopped yellow onion; I used canned tomatoes, drained; I included the tomato juice with the stock, all together 3 cups; I used meyer lemon peel and juice; I used store bought stock, so I didn't find it needed any salt. This was so great, I didn't try it with the sour cream, even though I bought it to serve as directed.

First carrot soup I've ever made --it was fabulous! I followed the recipe -except:)- used just 2 Tbsp. butter, added 1 tsp. madras curry powder to the sauteeing onions, 2 lbs carrots, 2 Tbsp. tomato paste instead of tomatoes, no lemon peel, 5 cups broth and a little water. The curry gave it a subtle zing. The lemon juice brightened the flavor. Added a dollop of sour cream and chopped chives to the bowls. My husband and 2 daughters (14 & 10) all loved it. Served it with panini sandwiches for an easy weeknight meal.

Oh, so delicious! I had to substitute tomato paste on one occasion, which worked fine, though the original is nicer. The soup is creamy, comforting, yet nice and bright-tasting with the lemon and garlic. If you can, forego the canned broth and make your own. Also, for a heart-healthier option you can substitute a much smaller amount of olive oil for the butter and things turn out just fine. This soup freezes well, though the lemon doesn't hold up as well so you'll want to taste it and possibly add some more to finish it if it's been frozen. A crowd-pleaser.

Overall great flavor. Doubled the ginger, left out lemon juice (kept the zest), added red pepper flakes. The lemon zest gives it a light citrus burst- a surprise flavor. I'm going to keep making adjustments until it becomes a 4 fork recipe. I'd like to achieve a velvety texture. I might use less onions and more carrots to increase the carrot flavor.

Rating: 4
Wow, what a fantastic receipe! Had my doubts at first because it seemed kind of bland, but I was not disappointed in the least. I forgot to buy lemon, so I substituted fresh lemongrass instead. The lemongrass went really, really well with the ginger. I did find that the soup ended up being quite thick, which wasn't what I was looking for - I was hoping for more of an appetizer-type soup. So I thinned it out with some organic carrot juice. I'd recommend using that to thin the soup rather than stock, in order to reduce the salt content and preserve the carroty flavor. Will definitely be making this one again, it was a huge hit!

I will make this soup again, it is a great way to use the carrots from the garden; however, I will be making it correctly the next time. I got carried away with the lemon juice and cut the sweetness that should come from the carrots. Loved the sour cream!

Excellent soup, made it exactly as specified and it didn't need anymore spice (perhaps I did use heaping levels of the spices though!). Came out real thick so I thinned with a bit more broth, as the recipe suggests. No additional salt needed (boxed/canned broths are full of salt).

Yummy yum yum. I thought this would be great food for a head cold and I was right. I made it with homemade vegetable stock so it was vegetarian but it made what would normally be a quick soup take a lot longer. I also stirred in a spicy chile with the onions to give the soup a slight zip. Stirred in cilantro at the end instead of sour cream and it tasted like Thailand! I will definitely make this again.

A wonderful tonic for a fall cold. I used olive oil, doubled the ginger, and left out the sour cream and grated carrot at the end. Served over couscous steamed with sliced fresh ginger. Some parsley or cilantro scattered on top would increase the visual appeal.

This soup is so wonderful! I wanted to do something with the abundance of carrots we had from the garden-this fit perfectly. I used more garlic and ginger, fabulous! Also, we used a stick blender, which worked very well. I am hooked on this recipe and am sharing it with everyone I know!

I was looking for a way to use up a bunch of carrots from my CSA and this recipe was perfect. I had everything to make it in my pantry and it was very easy. This had a nice subtle taste of ginger and the addition of the lemon zest and juice took it to a different level. Swirling in the sour cream upon serving it adds a nice creaminess. We are thinking about roasting the carrots the next time we make it to see if that gives it more of a sweetness or heartiness.

Rating: 4
I made this today in a double batch, and it was utterly delicious. Rich and velvety. I used no tomato, and it still was lovely. I used farmers' market carrots: 80% red-skinned, orange-centred carrots, one large dark purple carrot, and a handful of tiny yellow carrots, and the soup came out a gorgeous deep red, beetlike colour, which was brightened quite a bit by the lemon juice added at the end. Although I doubled everything else, I used only about 1.5 times the fat (rather than 2 times), equal parts butter and olive oil. Overall this was very quick to make except that I didn't have a very efficient method of producing 3 tsp of finely grated lemon peel. I used frozen cubes of minced ginger from my freezer; this saved some labour. Did not serve with sour cream or the grated carrot, but those would be lovely. I did swirl in a bit of 2.5% plain Liberte yogourt, which looked lovely and pinkish in contact with the beet-coloured soup.

Great, cozy soup for a cold night. Modifications were few...did not use the tomatoes because I did not have them. Also, did not use any of the lemon as I used about 1 tsp curry paste and did not think the two would go well together. The soup was amazing. Used a Cusinart SmartStick to puree instead of a blender. Left it on the chunky side opposed to thouroughly blended and smooth as my husband and I prefer it that way. Overall very, very good. Can't wait to taste the leftovers tonight...generally better second day.

I made this soup yesterday, for the first time. I was amazed at how easy and flavorful it was. I did double the amount of butter the recipe called for, and added some cumin spice to the mix--it was excellent. To counter the extra calories and fat added by the extra butter, I garnished with yoghurt instead of sour cream. Other than that, I followed the recipe closely. I found the lemon (which some reviews recommend skipping) suited my taste for tartness, and played nicely off the sweet and creamy richness of the other ingredients.

Rating: 4
Delicious and healthy! I used half olive oil and half butter, for a total of about 3 tablespoons. You can get away with less; next time, I'll just use olive oil for heart-friendliness. I may have been a tad generous with the ginger and garlic (didn't measure) and used the juice of a medium lemon--about 1/2 teaspoon more than called for. There was so much flavor that I skipped the salt completely. With the Brown Soda Bread from this site (Bon Appetit, May 1996), this was a hearty winter meal.

Terrific soup, light and quite savoury. Some of the changes suggested by other reviewers are interesting (as with the use of yoghurt instead of sour cream). As for myself, I've added a hint of dried tarragon with the lemon juice - and served with some minced chives over each bowl.

A really good recipie with some minor changes. Cumin(about a tsp.) and cilantro (a handful) are a must during the cooking part. I added a bit of the lemon zest but left out the lemon juice - found it was not at all necessary. As someone mentioned before, the cumin is a better substitute. Also, as someone mentioned, yogurt worked just as well as sour cream.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe, but it does benefit from tweaking (I agree with many previous reviewers). I made the following changes: use half the butter, and double the ginger. Use half the lemon juice, but add some orange juice (about 1/4 cup). I also added some caynne pepper, and garnished with creme fraiche and fresh cilantro. It's delicious and easy.

Rating: 3
Pretty darn good recipe. A little cayenne seemed more appropriate than black pepper for adding some zip to the soup, and garnishing with cilantro really added some oomph. Trimming the butter down didn't seem to affect the flavor, nor did a yogurt substitution for the sour cream. I followed the other reviewer's recommendations to add cumin and not the extra lemon juice (thank you!).

Rating: 3
I have made this several times and it always comes out wonderful! I have found that for me I have to at least double the amount of ginger to get any ginger flavor, and I usually have to add around 2 more cups of broth/water to get the consistency right after it boils. When the carrots are tender, I blend with the immersion blender until its creamy. Delicious!

I made this as the recipe called for, and adding the lemon juice as another suggested, little by little, to taste at the end. I did add some cayenne pepper for more zing and both my husband and I found this very bland. Not even interesting enough for a base. I can't figure out why mine didn't elicit the 3 and 4 forks given by others. I won't try this one again.

This can be made even easier. Use your food processor to chop up the carrots (pulse until they are small chunks but not miniscule bits), as well as your onions (I even do the ginger and garlic this way). Lazy? Maybe. Less stressed? Absolutely. They will be pureed anyway, so who cares about chopping and making everything uniform? I have used this 'shortcut' countless times when making dishes that require chopping. As for the lemon, agree that it is too much for my taste (adjust to your liking). The earlier suggestions for coconut milk sound great. Use your imagination - this can be a great base to play around with. This has been a Thanksgiving staple on my table (where we have also banned the horrible green beans with french fried onions!).

I made this soup as an appetizer and my boyfriend loved it so much I had to convince him not to have a second helping so he'd have room for the main course! He's already eaten the leftovers and is pleading that I make it again soon. Enough said! But definitely add more ginger and add the lemon juice TO TASTE at the end, as the soup ends up far too lemony (though aforementioned boyfriend obviously had no complaints). Adding a bit of rosemary or thyme would be nice too, and/or a dash of white wine. Serve with a crusty rosemary artisan bread. YUM!

delicious the first night, and even better the second! stuck to the recipe except for adding a shot of white wine to deglaze the onions, and used creme fraiche instead of sour cream. oh, and sauteed a fresh red chile with the garlic - perfect! thick and velvety, with a nice zing from the lemon.

I made this soup the first time for a bridal shower I was hosting. I read the other reviews, and then decided to make it 2 days ahead of time. The day of the shower I stirred in another small can of chicken soup and heated it up. It was a huge success. Everyone wanted seconds and the recipe!

I gave this recipe 4 forks but revised it by using orange juice instead of lemon and by pureeing all the cooked ingredients and putting them through a sieve. Nice velvety texture - will definitely make this again.

Tasty, economical recipe. Added extra ginger and less lemon. Even better as leftovers.

I really enjoyed this soup. I definitely was cautious about my lemon use after reading all the reviews, so I actually only used the lemon rind and skipped the lemon juice. I also doubled the amount of ginger and garlic. It was delicious!

Rating: 3
We enjoyed this, especially the ginger, although I agree with the previous reviewer who thought the lemon was too much. I love lemon, but this amount really did overpower the carrot flavor. I'll make this again and try 1/2 the lemon juice and zest.

Rating: 3
Well, the original recipe IS lacking. I agree that there was too much lemon. I used the recommended amount but doubled everything else and I thought the lemon was still a bit much, which surprised me. I like my soup chunky but I ended up blending more carrots than I otherwise would have to help balance out the lemon. I think some chipotle chilies would be a great addition. I didn't have any, but added a few cumin seeds, some freshly ground peppercorn, some tarragon and garlic salt. I didn't have any sour cream and thankfully so, because when I looked for it, my gaze fell upon the Dofo brand feta that we always have on hand, and... voila! Intuitive improvisation is the hallmark of genius. It was a PERFECT addition. My husband LOVED it and said that people would pay $5 a bowl for it in a restaurant. (Pretty funny because soup IS $5 a bowl in a restaurant... no raving compliment, y'know?) With these mentioned additions, I'd give it 4 forks. But the recipe shown here is merely a good base. Great soup for thanksgiving. We thought it would be well-suited for a roasted chicken with a crabapple glaze/sauce. Try it!

I made this with everything but the sour cream dollop. The first day I was disappointed, too lemony like everyone says, not to mentiona bit bland. However, I ate my next bowl two days later and to my surprise it was amazing. I guess the flavors married in that time and the result was delicious. If I make it again I will use ginger from a jar, possibly add sambal or other chili sauce, and wait a couple of days to eat it. It is difficult to find a non-cream based soup this good. Still: 2 forks!

Fantastic soup - we loved the combo of flavours. I used a little less lemon juice as recommended by some other reviewers and used minced ginger from a jar. I am a ginger fan so would probably a tiny bit more next time, but I will definately make again!

I really enjoyed this soup. The tomatoes are an excellent and unusual addition. Next time I would increase the amout of ginger (it could easily be doubled). I followed other readers' suggestions and was conservative about the amount of lemon juice.

This is the best carrot soup recipe yet! I didn't have quite the 3 cups of chopped carrots, so I made slight adjustments downward in the quantity of ingredients, but I followed the recipe. Because of other cooks' comments, I added the lemon juice by the half teaspoonful until I thought the taste was right on. I ended up using nearly all the lemon juice called for. My wife and family thought it was great (even those that did not like cooked carrots) - good enough for company. Definitely use fresh ginger!

The ginger gave this soup a nice little zing, but it was missing something. I agree with the cook from the Mountain in Canada -- a little white wine, thyme, etc. Be careful with the fresh lemon at the end as too much ruins the soup.

We loved this soup! I sauteed the onions in only one tablespoon of butter and it still tasted delicious. This soup works well within the Weight Watchers program. We did not garnish with sour cream and actually didn't miss it.

I've made this recipe several times and it always gets rave reviews. A great appetizer for a big crowd at Thanksgiving. I add more ginger than the recipe calls for.

Rating: 3
Totally yummy, and validated my "need" for an immersion blender. Thick enough that it didn't need any kind of added starch, mild enough that you taste everything - the buttery carrots, the creaminess of the tomatos, the warmth of the ginger, and the high, bright notes of the lemon. Adding the lemon last is important; taste as you add it to make sure you don't overdo it and overshadow the mellow heartiness of this soup.

Easy to make, great taste, faboulous for entertaining. I would make this again in a second! As a matter of fact I am making it for guests tonight.

This is a very tasty carrot soup. I've made it several times over the past couple years and find that I'm looking for a bit more flavour - to that end I've added some thyme and cayenne, some white wine or sherry, and/or some cumin, taking this basic very good recipe closer to 4 forks for my own tastebuds. It was interesting coming back after a few years to read the reviews that have accumulated since I first copied and made this recipe. I'd like to try this recipe with a little dill next time I dig up some more carrots. Perhaps someone will let us know if they try dill, or any other herb or spice, in this recipe. I find the sour cream to be a positive flavour addition to the soup, but not entirely necessary.

Rating: 4
Delicious! The soup tasted and looked great. The addition of the tomato made for a mango-ish color with flecks of red. I too added the cayenne. I garnished with carrot curls and I didn't add the sour cream (it didn't need it). I may use something else for garnish next time just to off set the orange on orange. Maybe a little lemon zest and black pepper would do it. I halved the recipe and it made two heary main dish size bowls. Recommend for sure.

Thought the soup was lovely - and much better on day two. The first time I made it I didnt change it, but the second time I halved the lemon juice and added a bit of cayenne pepper (as per other readers suggestions). Those minor changes made the soup great.

this soup has a wonderfully sophisticated flavour,but doesn't require remotely troublesome ingredients. i did not have lemon on hand and used orange instead - i increased the ginger and added just a touch of honey to impart a nicely rounded flavour to match the carrots. i left the sour cream out as i prefer the slight bite of the ginger on its own, though i'm sure it is a nice inclusion. i also didn't puree the entire soup, and left the carrots just short of "very tender," so that there was a bit of texture left for the tooth. fun in the mouth!

Amazing! Wouldn't change a thing. Perfect for dinner parties and large groups.

When I made this soup last night I was so exhausted that I just threw those baby peeled small carrots in instead of chopping. It worked wonderfully. Such an easy soup to make, and so delicate a taste...I wouldn't change a thing with the recipe. A definite nice change from my usual favorites of curried carrot and curried squash soups...

This was a very good soup. It seemed like the addition of some spice or herb - and I'm not really sure what - would have made it a four star recipe. It was flavorful but just needed something else. I didn't make any changes in recipe.

Soup is easy and delicious. I also made split-pea soup, and served them together in the same bowl. Since both are fairly thick, you can take a cup of each, pouring at the same time, they stay separated. Garnish as desired. Beautiful presentation!

This is a wonderful, light soup. The gentle interplay between the ginger and lemon bring out the best of the carrot flavor. I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth and it was lovely. We served the soup with a Masi Sauve wine, which went very nicely with it.

Well, I was making cream of carrot soup because my one year old will eat any cream soup with veggies...and I realized I didn't have the spices required in my recipe...so I looked at this recipe for spice ideas and adapted my soup somewhat...added ginger and lemon, but kept it creamy and it was awesome!! I can't wait to make the whole recipe from this one!!

I have made this twice - first time I followed the recipe exactly except that I added 1 tbsp more of ginger. I should have stuck to the recommended amount as the ginger taste was a bit too overwhelming - but other than that it was delicious. 2nd time I got the ginger amount right and also cut back considerabley on the butter and ommitted the sour cream garnish (for calorie/fat reasons) - the soup was still very delicious - the lemon really gives this soup a subtle kick - its yummy, nutritious and very easy! Double the recipe and freeze some!

This was a yummy soup! Very easy to make. I served this as a starter for a meal of Seared Tuna with Shiitake-Ginger Cream Sauce, Wasabi Mashed Potatoes, and some green beans and snow peas. Everything went really well together. It's great for guests because you can make the soup the day before and the potatoes 2 hours before. If you prep the stuff for the sauce ahead of time you can disappear for 10-15 minutes and serve an awesome meal!

A really great soup. My husband loved it and said it was one of the best carrot soups he'd ever had. I was a little skeptical about the tomato, but it was great. I used low-fat sour cream and that really smoothed it out. Not that you need the sour cream in this recipe, but it's a nice addition. Very, Very good!

I made this as an experiment to use up part of a 4-pound bag of Whole Foods' organic carrots, some withering ginger, some leftover tomato paste, an over-supply of Swanson's chicken broth, and to try out my Cuisinart Smartstick. It is almost indecent to report that I was scraping the pot and licking the spoon at 10:15 pm while dressed in "Glamor Don't" sweats. This soup is OUTRAGEOUS! Even with the substitutions (the broth and tomato paste in place of the tomatoes), it's perfect without salt or pepper. If this is a dinner party starter, you'd better come up with a knockout entree and a drop-dead dessert!

This was really a nice carrot soup, especially after having a disappointing experience eating a very bland carrot soup at a pricy high-end restaurant. I used pureed ginger from a jar instead of grating my own (much easier) and added a tad extra along with the lemon juice. Also added a dash of cayenne, which was okay, but could have done without. I'll definately make it again!

I tried this recipe after being at work and smelling a wonderful aroma emanating from our shared microwave. Although I did not receive a specific recipe, my colleague said her daughter found this "on the internet". I referred to this reliable website and found this. I did not have fresh ginger, but powdered ginger lent a nice tone without being too strident. Next time I will try it with fresh ginger. My husband and daughter were delighted with the results.

absolutely a wonderful dish! I served it at a dinner party decorated with little dollops of sour cream+dots of pesto...the texture (used a stick blender) was perfectly velvety...added a bit more ginger to give the palate a more cleansing property before serving a hearty roasted filet

Perfectly balanced flavor, great color. I made the soup the day before, and held back one tablespoon of the lemon juice, just in case the flavor changed overnight. It didn't, added the reserved juice while reheating. Served with dill rolls, it was a wonderful first course for Easter dinner.

I thought this soup was wonderful. A perfect blend of flavors, not too much carrot, not too much lemon, not too much ginger, all perfect together. My boyfriend, who used to think food was fuel only, called it "sublime". I tend to cook very healthily, so I used just enough butter to coat the bottom of the pan, and used non-fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream. Will definitely make again!

I liked, didn't love, this soup. I found that the lemon (and I used less than called for) overpowered the ginger and garlic. Next time, and it was easy enough that there will be a next time, I'd probably go without much, if any, of the lemon juice.

I tripled the recipe for a dinner party, and it worked beautifully. I added a generous splash of coconut milk while I was thinning with the broth, and I used some finely chopped crystalized ginger as a garnish. (I did not use the sour cream.)

This is the soup which converted my non soup-eating daughter to the pleasures of a homemade soup. Absolutely excellent. There certainly is a lot of chopping involved but once that's done, it couldn't be easier to prepare. The quality of the ingredients is vital. I had to discard one batch of carrots which tasted of nothing but soap. I also used a bag of baby carrots - organic - which had a great carroty flavour & were very easy to prepare. A definite do-again.

A sophisticated and delicate soup that seems to be easily adapted. I omitted the ginger because not all my family are keen on it, but I do think it would round the flavour beautifully.
