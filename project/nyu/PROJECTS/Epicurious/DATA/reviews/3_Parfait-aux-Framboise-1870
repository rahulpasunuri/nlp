Alright, this was much better before I froze it. Then it was just okay. Didn't like the macaroons in/on it. Probably better and easier to just buy a good pint of ice cream.

I haven't actually eaten this frozen yet but the "batter" is sooooo good! We'll try it out on the in-laws tomorrow. Also, I used the 1 tblsp size macaroons and that seemed like the right size.

I have made this many times over the years and it is easy, delicious and impressive. The only problem is macaroons can vary wildly in size, so just eyeball it. Wonderful for dinner parties.
