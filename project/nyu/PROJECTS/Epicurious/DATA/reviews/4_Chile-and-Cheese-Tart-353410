Nice tasting but very salty - recommend to reduce by half.

This is a simple recipe from ingredients that are easy to keep on hand. It has a lot of flavor and is a filling vegetarian dish. Great with a salad. I like it because I can't screw it up.

This is so easy to make, I would recommend it to people who claim they can't cook. Very delicious. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

This was one of my boyfriend's favorite things that I've ever made, and that's saying a lot. I didn't love it quite as much, but it was very, very good, and relatively easy. I made my own tart shell since I don't like the store-made ones, so that added on to the workload, but everything else was pretty easy.

This was very easy to make, and even easier to eat! We ate half the pie for dinner and were excited to eat the other half for breakfast. Since there are two pie shells in the batch I bought, I might make two at a time the next time I do it, though I am not sure if it would ok to freeze.

Love this dish, and so do husband and company. Very easy, good vegetarian option, and super tasty. I buy the frozen/rolled crusts, thaw, and refreeze before putting the mixture in. Works just fine!

This was pretty good considering how fast it was to make. I wanted something else in there, like ham. Maybe next time.

This is my fiance's new favorite recipe - easy and flavorful, we'll be making this again. We used low-fat half and half and low-fat cheddar with great results.

Very good and so easy. Louisand....I think the recipe is calling for a frozen pie crust that comes in its own pie pan. If you purchase a frozen packaged crust in a package but no pan, you would need to thaw it but I would recommend once you have it in the pan that you bake it a few minutes, then take it out of the oven, cool and add other ingredients per recipe and bake per the recipe.

Even though it looked like the center of the pie crust didn't cook thoroughly, I ate it. And enjoyed it. Thinking about baking the pie crust a little bit before adding the filling next time.

Excellent weekday dish. Minimal clean up which can be done while the tart is cooking leaving time for table setting and a relaxing beverage before the troops arrive. I only added three ingredients; cayenne to the egg mixture (we like it hot), a sprinkle of paprika on the top for color and some crushed corn chips during the last 5 minutes of baking for some textural contrast. Next time I would think about adding some corn kernels or some diced ham or salami. Just one question; how do you get the frozen pie crust laid into a pie dish?? I had to thaw mine.

Incredibly easy. The flavors blended nicely, and the kick was a crowd pleaser.

Easy to make and VERY tasty. DH wants meat in all dishes, so I shredded a poached chicken breast for the tart. Because I needed to cut mass somewhere, I halved the green chiles and cheese and used pepperjack cheese. Good brunch dish!
