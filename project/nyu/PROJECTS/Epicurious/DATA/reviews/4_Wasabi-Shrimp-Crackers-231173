I am starting my party planning and was looking for this recipe. It is a great cocktail party recipe and have made it at least 3 times. Used advice from others and used both rice crackers and cucumbers. Have tried all varieties of rice crackers as well all work equally. I do recommend a little more wasabi paste and pipe them right before the party. I used a chilled serving platter which kept life longer. They disappear quick though so the soggy cracker problem may not even be a factor:)

I make this recipe with cucumbers instead of crackers - it is nice and refreshing. I also use thawed frozen shrimp but have made a vegetarian version with roasted eggplant and red peppers. You really can really play around and have fun with this recipe.

Forgot to say...I cut up the shrimp into small pieces and added both them and the onions right into the cream cheese so that there was no prep once people arrived.

This was so easy to make and everyone loved it. I added at least 3 TBSP of the wasabi paste, maybe more, and we discovered it was very good with srirachi chili hot sauce added to the top. Some people preferred with srirachi and some without. I used frozen shrimp to save on cost and quick thawed them in water. No one could tell. Served them with pita chips and wheat crackers. No one missed the rice crackers.

Very easy to prepare. Skip the blender & just mix. Used a lot more wasabi-approx 3 TBLS. Served as cheese ball coated with the small bay shrimp. Big hit at party!

I used cucumber slices so as not to have lst minute prep before company. So easy, and so good. I would suggest increasing wasabi a little, and also sprinkling a little salt over them.

So simple, so elegant looking. Great both on rice crackers and on cucumber. If using rice crackers, serve immediately to avoid letting the cracker get soggy.

Perfect, easy, a great hit. Alternating black and sesame (white) rice crackers makes a pretty platter.

These were easy and good, my guests raved about them. I served them on flaky crackers since rice crackers are not my favorite. They were also great w/out the shrimp for my vegetarian son and his girlfriend.

LOVE THESE!! Made last year for my Christmas cocktail party and they were requested for this years. I serve on cucumbers....can be prepared about an hour ahead..best of very cold. Big hit because they are low cal!

Made this for a holiday party. Used other comments and piped the cheese onto both rice crackers and others with just cucumber. Made for a pretty platter and people liked the variety. YUM!

WOW! I had this at a party and couldn't stop eating them. I was lucky enough to help in the kitchen and put these together. We used a pastry bag to pipe the cream cheese onto the cracker. We wanted to extend the amount of shrimp, so we only used one 1/2 shrimp on each one. After a few drinks and a few shrimp crackers, I began to experiment. The crackers are good with a bit of cucumber on them We used whole slices. Also, I was just putting the filling on the cucumbers, no crackers, that was also a hit! Thank you for the great recipe. Note, if using only cucumbers, they can be made in advance since they do not get soggy.

Have made them several times and they are always a hit. And, yes, the crackers get soggy so make them throughout the party, but they go together so easily it's no big deal. Very yummy. In fact, I wish I had some right now...

These are fantastic, everyone was so impressed, but they are so simple to make. I made these as I went along since everyone said the crackers get soggy, but as long as you have your ducks in a row beforehand, you can assemble them in no time.

I made thise for New Year's Eve and everyone raved. Took the advice of the last review and used cucumbers and whole shrimp. Looked fancy but very simple. My guests seemed to like way more wasabi paste than called for.

I made these for a cocktail party along with a few other recipes from this site. I followed other reviewers' advice using cucmbers rather than rice crackers. They were very tasty and looked great on a tray. I didn't bother to slice the shrimp in half, just removed the tails from the medium shrimp and placed on top of the cream cheese mixture. I made them a few hours in advance and kept them refrigerated until ready to serve. Guests seem to like them. There were none left out of a triple recipe!

I am torn between giving 2 or 3 forks because I made half as written, with the rice crackers, and half with the cucumber (as suggested by another reviewer). I MUCH prefer this with the cucumber than with the crackers. It is very easy, though, and quite tasty. I will make it again for parties.

Liked it, but thought it would have been better if shrimp was seasoned. With what I'm not sure.

Yum!! Easy and pretty and a real hit! I used cucumbers and made them ahead. Kept well for several hours pre-party!

Great! It's easy, pretty, and if you use cucumbers instead of crackers it can be made ahead for convenience! I used english cucumbers and made the edges decorative by "peeling" them with a lemon zester. Definately a winner!

These were sooooo good, everyone loved them. I made half with a dill cream cheese for those who thought they didn't care for wasabe, but I needn't have bothered. These are so simple and so delicious they will be a staple in my menus.

Guests grabbed off of the plate. Better if they are made very fresh so the crackers are crisp.

This makes a very easy and delicious appetizer. Served before Easter dinner and everyone in my family loved them. I liked that I could prepare the cream cheese mixture, shrimp and scallions in advance and then put together the last minute. I liked the rice cracker, but it does start to lose it crunch, so make sure you put them together right before serving. Will remember this one for parties!

After reading all the reviews, there seemed to be a problem in keeping the crackers crisp. I had a time/serving problem so I used a thinly sliced English cucumber as the base, piped on the cream cheese/wasabi, and topped that with a small to medium shrimp, butterflied half-way up from the large end and splayed out, and then sprinkled with the scallions. I made them 6 hours ahead and put them on the serving dish, so they went from the frig to the table. Makes an attractive presentation.

What a wonderful "party food". My guests at a recent New Year's Eve cocktail party couldn't stop talking about these. I took other cooks' suggestion and used water crakers as the platform for this appetizer, and the results couldn't have been better - or easier! The presentation was somewhat lacking I thought . . . until the scallion was added. That small touch made all the difference, and I dressed my platter with wasabi by purchasing the wasabi garnishing paste that comes in a squirt bottle. Very easy to make small curlicues and dots that allow guests to add heat if they dip into it! With those two touches the appetizer looked as good as it tasted, and again VERY EASY. I made the cream cheese the evening before and just brought it to room temperature about half an hour before the guest arrived. I gave my shrimp a quick rinse and patted dry, then assembled. We will definitely have these again!

I made this last night for a New Year's Eve party and people loved it. I actually found wasabi flavored rice crackers in the Asian section of my supermarket (Wegmans) which added to the flavor. One half of a shrimp fit perfectly on the cracker and it was enough. I also just spread what looked like the right amount on the cracker, I didn't mound it. One caution - prepare all the components ahead but don't assemble till the last minute. Once the wasabi cream cheese is spread on the the crackers they start to lose their crispness after about an hour. However, they probably won't last that long!

Took this to a luncheon and they were gone in a heatbeat. Great, easy and a pretty presentation. Trader Joe's has wasabi cream cheese in a tub which makes it that much easier.

Will definitely make again. Served at a cocktail party. Not only were they devoured, I had several ask for the recipe. I added a little extra wasabi and served it on a toasted baguette rather than the rice crackers. Made a beautiful presentation and the toasted baguette held up nicely.

Will definitely make again. Served it at a cocktail party and besides being devoured, had several requests for the recipe. I added a little extra wasabi and served it on toasted sliced baguettes instead of the rice crackers. Beautiful presentation and the toasted baguette held up well.

Easy and fast, but I thought they lacked somehow. I didn't like the taste of the rice cracker with the wasabi - they seemed to overwhelm the shrimp entirely. Next time I would use a plainer-tasting cracker or even chilled sticky rice rounds.

This was simple and tasty ...but I made them about an hour ahead of time and to my dismay the cream cheese was a bit dried out and the cracked a bit soggy. It wasn't a disaster - I was the only who probably noticed - I thought I would pass it along. I will definitely make again but not in advance.

I could not believe how easy this recipe was to make and absolutely delicious. I made it for a neighborhood holiday party and received rave reviews.

Will make this over and over again. Extremely easy and fast -- guests loved it & asked for the recipe. Had a few follow me into the kitchen and eat the crackers off the plate before I take more back to the party. I used the small salad sized shrimp cooked by the fish market. Purchased a pound as recipe directed, however only used a 1/2 pound and I was very generous putting shrimp on the cracker.
