I always make things harder than they should be. I made this cake for my Daughters 40th birthday. There were to be 20 some people at the party and I didn't think a 10" cake was big enough. I went to the cake accessory store and bought a 12"x2" round cake pan. I looked on the internet for a way to convert the amounts in this recipe to a 12" pan. Couldn't find any conversion charts that even recognized a 12" pan. So I just doubled it. It turns out that was perfect the Genoise puffed right up in instead of 30 minutes it took 35 minutes. It was so pretty. I did "beat the crap" out of the eggs as suggested. The ganache, the next day, when I took it out of the fridge was way too hard so I put it in a double boiler and softened it a bit. The cake cut easily into three layers and the finished cake is about 4 1/2 inches high. It looked so good. The assembly went smoothly, I had doubled the ganache, raspberry, chambord syrup and glaze as well. No problems with the syrup making the cake soggy. Covered the top with fresh rasberries. Perfect, I will make this again. One thing that really helped me was the rotating cake stand and the cardboard cake rounds.

This cake is so rewarding! But time consuming. This will be the second time I make this cake for my husband's b-day and I have decided to make it in steps over a few days. The cake does taste better if it has time to rest after assembly. A solid recipe, and I had no problems. Just YUM! for serious chocolate lovers.

I made this one for Mother's day and wasn't all that impressed for the amount of work I put it UNTIL the next day. I've never really gotten the whole, "it's better the next day" but this one is amazing. I had sent some home with my Mom and she thought the same thing. I'll definitely make it again but a day or so ahead of time. Worth the effort!

This cake was great, however, there were some issues with it that other people may not have encountered or may know how to fix. I had no problem getting the genoise to rise sufficiently since I did follow people's advice about beating the eggs for a long time. However, I would definitely use a cake pan that is 2 inches deep next time; the one I used this time was 1 1/2 inches deep and the genoise went a bit over on the rim. I think with a deeper pan the genoise would have risen more, which means more substantial layers of genoise in the final cake, which is very important as the ganache part of this cake is quite rich and intense and you don't want it overtaking the whole thing. Somebody told me that if you flour the pan on top of buttering it too, it will give the cake something to grab onto and thus, it will rise more. Of course,you can always use less ganache like some people suggested to get a more even ganache-genoise flavor. Secondly, I would put less syrup on the layer that will be on the bottom of the cake. I am saying that because the bottom layer of my cake nearly disappeared and I assume that happened because of the weight of all the stuff on top of it that pushed it to absorb more of the syrup. Thirdly, I would not chill the ganache as much as it says to do here. I don't know why you're supposed to chill it and then leave it at room temp before using it. In my case as well, the fridge was too cold and I think it froze the ganache: the butter had separated from it and I had to put it in a double boiler and whisk it again...it worked but I am not sure it was the best thing for it. Lastly, the genoise cake was too eggy...if anyone knows a way to make it less so and still keep it risable, please let me know.

I have a warm spot in my heart for this recipe. My daughter (then 13) saw it in Gourmet in 1997 and insisted I make it for her birthday. I have been making it every year since. It is a time consuming labor of love and I have had some of the problems others describe but if you follow the recipe exactly it is quite beautiful and rich.

I thought it was just ok for the amount of work. For the genoise, definitely beat the crap out of it in a mixer until it's almost white and as fluffy as possible. It also becomes the consistency of a sponge cake, but the fragileness of a souffle. First time I tried it and opened the oven to check on it by poking w/ a toothpick, it totally collapsed (picture a crater w/ the sides 3" high but the middle 1/2" high). The air bubbles are what makes it somewhat high enough. I then followed the advice of one of the reviewers and just left it in the oven for an hour to cool and that worked. I should have kept the crater and used it for a layer because the 2nd attempt still cratered by 1/2" so the bottom wasn't even. The cake itself is fairly dry except for the very bottom of it. I'd recommend doubling the syrup to moisten it. The cake seems to act like the lady fingers in tiramisu, so you're trying to soak it w/ the syrup. The ganache on wax paper trick mostly worked, but if you chill it too long, it becomes fragile instead of flexible; the ganache will also be too crumbly if you eat the cake chilled. The glaze makes the cake look better but probably isn't needed. If you're going to spend this much time working on a cake, I'd suggest the "My Favorite Birthday Cake" recipe instead. It tastes better IMHO and looks even better...

Good, not great. A lot of work even though it can be spread over a few days. Problems: 1 )The cake was really not tall enough or dense enough to be cut into 3 layers ... 2) By chilling the ganache it made it impossible to spread... even bringing it back to room temp was not enough.. I had to rewarm it over simmering water in order to make it loose enough to spread.

The guests at my party couldn't believe I baked this at home. It was very beautiful and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. I made the ganache and syrup two days before and assembled the cake without the glaze one day before. It was all very easy. Next time I will distribute the ganache more evenly so the top of the cake doesn't end up with such a thick layer of chocolate. This is a perfect cake for people who love chocolate and raspberry!

This is a lovely recipe. Yes, it's time consuming, but for a special occasion it's worth it. And it is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! Be sure and use an electric mixer (I used a hand-held one) to FULLY beat the heated eggs and sugar. I actually more than doubled mine, being sure to beat the mixture until it was completely cool. This, I think, made for a high cake, thick enough to easily be torted into three layers. I didn't use all the syrup for my cake; it would've been too much, too soggy. With this cake there is as much ganache as there is actual cake, so be forewarned: it is RICH. It's not a very tall cake -- really, it's a torte, and mine was about 2-1/2" to 3" tall. I will definitely add this one to my make-often list. I've never seen a prettier cake anywhere.

This cake is decadent and worth my efforts from the reactions I got from guests! Doing all steps except assembly ahead of time made this low stress (Cake spent three days in the fridge and wasn't stale). I had to make the genoise twice because I didn't let the egg mixture double--the baked cake was flat and rubbery. My second attempt (lots more whisking) was perfect.

Very rich and chocolately...exactly what I was looking for. Not a difficult recipe to make, but it does take time. Take advantage of the make-ahead steps. I used a mixer to whisk the ganache and it worked better than doing it by hand. Give the ganache plenty of time to return to room temperature. A different review referenced spreading the ganache on wax paper first, and then transferring to the cake...very good idea, and saved some frustration.

I made this for a picnic my boss had, and it was a great hit! Instead of the Chambord, I used Bacardi Razz raspberry flavored rum. It was fantastic. I found the genoise to be a bit dry, but I just made sure I used plenty of the syrup. I can't wait to make it again.

Well, it is time consuming. But......the rewards are priceless. Rave reviews from my family. I made this for Mother's Day and Mom is still talking about it. Very rich, very heavy, very good. I had to make make two genoises because the first one was a little thin for needing to cut into three layers. I didn't have Chambord liquer so I used Blackberry Brandy. It worked well I thought. Otherwise, I followed recipe to a tee until I was placing glaze on. I left assembled cake very cool and it helped the glaze stick on faster instead of dripping off so much.

I made this cake when it first came out for my first Valentine's Day with the man who became my husband. We used the recipe as his groom's cake and somehow it got lost in the shuffle. I am so happy to find it again! Time-consuming but well worth it!

I was pretty nervous when I made this, but I am happy to report that the genoise came out just fine. I followed the recipe exactly, so I think if you are willing to do that, you should be OK. I found the cake to be extremely rich. I think that if I do this again, I'll increase the amount of fruit and jam--maybe place some berries in the jam layers. The cake got rave reviews--definitely something for special occasions.

I've been making this recipe since it was first published. I made it three times just this summer. It always comes out fabulous and knocks everyone's socks off! It looks so professional as well. Making it in stages is so wonderful for busy working people. It makes a huge impression and comes out a sure winner everytime!

Since I was concerned, based on other reviews, that the genoise might be flat, I prevented that by baking it for a slightly shorter amount of time and then turning off the oven and letting it cool inside the oven for an hour. The cake stayed high and I was able to cut three layers.

I followed the recipe exactly and the genoise was so flat there would have been no way to get 3 slices out of it. Any suggestions on what I did wrong would be appreciated.

I make this in 4+ jelly roll pans as a grooms cake for up to 150 people. Tastes great as long as all the layers get enough syrup. Cover the top with a stream of strawberries, raspberries and red apples halves. BEAUTIFUL!!!

Easy but somewhat time-consuming. However, each stage can be made in advance and chilled or frozen, which would really make this a snap. Cake was not dry, no problems spreading ganache. Big hit at dinner party on both taste and looks.

I made this recipe exactly as printed and it is wonderful! The caske was NOT dry at all (those who found it dry may have forgotten the simple syrup?). This is truly elegant, scrumptious, rich and not-too-sweet. This one is definitely a keeper!

Well, due to the comments on the cake being dry I tried a different cake recipe. My comments are only on the ganache, syrup and glaze. My feeling was yes it was good, but for the amount of effort, I was expecting something really special. It wasn't due to the other cake recipe, since that was excellent. The ganache was not easy to deal with, even when softened. It didn't spread well and brought up tons of crumbs as I spread it. I decided putting it on top would be a disaster! Instead I spread the syrup and the glazed which turned out very nicely. The cake was stunning! I decorate with raspberries. It just wasn't the cake of my dreams for the amount of effort. With this cake, it's real beauty was on the outside and not on the inside, which is sad....

I made this cake for my boss' birthday at work. Everyone raved. It's VERY rich. I even have requests to make another one. The recipe is a little more involved than a basic cake recipe, but I didn't find it difficult at all.

My husband has been searching for the perfect chocolate raspberry ganache cake for years. I was sure that this would be the one. While, I might make it one more time just to see... I think my search must continue. The cake was a little dry and it seems like a lot of work to acheive only a so-so result.

This is a great cake for birthdays and special ocassions. I have made it many times, once as a three tier cake - it was great. I found the genoise is not so dry when you bake it with a pan of water on the shelf beneath. It is also great as a mousse cake,leaving the corn syrup and butter out of the ganache. Made a day or two in advance allows for the cake to absorb some of the moisture of the ganache making it less dry. Skip the chocolate glaze and it's super easy!

Delicious and very beautiful in appearance.

Waaaay too rich. But I had to increase the ganache by 1/2, so that may have been the problem. The tip about the rasberry being frozen on waxed paper saved my sanity! Next time I'd go easier on the syrup and make the ganache according to the recipe portion. Otherwise, I got raves!

This dessert was wonderful. I wasn't impressed by the cake itself, next time I might use a sponge cake instead. So that I didn't tear the cake when layering the ganache, I spread it on plastic wrap first, froze 5 minutes and pealed it off onto the cake. Worked like magic!

Wonderful! I love chocolate/raspberry combinations, and this one is outstanding. It does take some effort to make, but once you've done it, doing it again is not so bad.

This cake is FABULOUS! A nice presentation with delicious flavors inside (chocolate and raspberry-my favorite combo). I brought this to my fiance's family Christmas party - now I think I will have to prepare it anually for them!

This was soooooooooo good! I just loved it, as did my guests this New Year's. I thought it would be really difficult to assemble - and while spreading the ganache over the jam was trying - it looked great in the end with the cover-all-your-mistakes glaze. I used semi-sweet for the ganache, and bittersweet for the glaze: WONDERFUL! Make sure to serve it with a dollop of whipped cream and fresh raspberries to balance out the chocolatey richness...

This cake was kind of fun to make ... a challenge of sorts. The finished product looked fabulous and very impressive. As for taste ... it was extremely rich (you could serve a ton of people with this heavy number), and was pretty tasty, but I wouldn't make it again. I've had better chocolate desserts that are a lot less time consuming.

This is our most frequenct "special occasion" cake. It always is a crowd favorite. The cake is easier to assemble than I thought. Make sure the ganache is nice and soft when you spread on the layers or it will rip apart the cake.

The cake was VERY rich. The ganache was wonderful. I thought the genoise was a little tough and dry. I whisked the raspberry jam to make it smooth before spreading on the layers. My husband loved it, it was his birthday cake. I had a lot of fun making it, but I'm not sure I'd make it again.

I just made this cake for a group of discriminating bakers. The unanimous verdict is that it is positively wonderful. I used Trader Joe's Pound Plus Bittersweet chocolate (stores in CA) and it turned out fabulous.

The icing and glaze make for a FABULOUS chocolate dream, BUT the cake was dense beyond belief. I made three cakes to have a large layer cake. It was a big hit for my friend's birthday.

Featured in a beautiful cover shot in the Feb 97 issue of Gourmet, this V Day cake is definitely one of my all time favorites. One of the tricks in working with this cake, is that you CANNOT be in a rush - it is critical that the ganache warm up before beating it - other wise it doesn't become light and fluffy and can retain some chunky bits. The syrup, while good need not ALL be used, and not all of the Raspberry preserves need be entirely used, either. This is the one to use that chocolate that you've been saving for the "right cake" for (yes, all 1.5 pounds of it). Absolutely Delicious!
