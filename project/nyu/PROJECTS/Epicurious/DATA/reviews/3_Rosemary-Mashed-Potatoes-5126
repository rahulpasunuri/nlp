A nice change of pace. I added some other fresh herbs (parsley & thyme) from my garden to spice it up with good results.

I love cooking with rosemary unfortunately I cant seem to grow it. This was a very nice alternative to regular mashed potatoes. My guests all seemed to enjoy it. Also different from the traditional rosemary roasted potatoes.

I've been doing this variation of mashed potatoes for years. It's also good if you boil the potatoes with a couple of whole cloves of garlic, then leave those in when you mash.

Good but nothing "to write home about."

This is a tasty variation of plain mashed potatoes. Good with chicken.
