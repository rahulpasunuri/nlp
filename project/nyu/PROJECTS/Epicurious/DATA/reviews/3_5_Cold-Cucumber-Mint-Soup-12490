Added 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp dijon, finished with ground sumac. Added 2.5 more cucumbers becuase the soup was too thin. Skipped the sour cream. Soup definately gets better with age; garlic became spicier the longer it sat. Excellent cool beginning to a meal. Great use for garden cucs. I didn't peel or seed the cucs because I used fresh garden cucs without tough waxy skin. The skin added a beautiful green hue to the soup.

I have to agree with the others who said it was just okay. I made it with greek yogurt, which may have overpowered it. I wound up adding two extra cucumbers to regain balance. My cucumbers were fresh out of the garden, so it wasn't a matter of freshness. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.

Stuck with just one large cucumber I made it anyway, and it was a fantastic mini-starter course for 4 (1/2 cup each). Definitely needs the salt and dry mustard to kick it up.

This was just ok. I am just trying to find things to make with all my cucumbers we have growing right now. I have found some others that were great. I will not make this again.

I thought this was delicious - as did my 6 guests for dinner. Great beginning to a summer meal. I chilled glass bowls and garnished the bowls with a slice of cucumber. I wouldn't change a thing.

I made it as a first course for a dinner party on a very hot and humid night. I got rave reviews. I used Tzatziki instead of plain yogurt and I think it kicked up the flavour quite a bit. I used shrimp cocktail bowls with crushed ice on the bottom, toped each bowl with thinly sliced chilled cumber and slivers of red pepper for colour.

Made this soup as a first course for a dinner party last weekend and it was a huge hit. Just a few alterations: use Greek-style yogurt which has a bit more flavor. Also added a pinch of cayenne pepper at the end which gave the flavor a boost. Served in chilled bowls with a seared scallop in the middle. Paired with a dry riesling. Received rave reviews from everyone. Definitely a keeper and a perfect summer soup!

Very simple and tasty. It was fine without the sour cream (I didn't have any on hand.) We ate it immediately. Still quite good.

Loved this soup. Added a little garlic for some extra kick but otherwise made exactly as is. Light and refreshing, perfect for summer.

Tastes like raita, the Indian mint yogurt dip. Rather unspectacular.

I had too many cucumbers from my garden and needed to use them up. Wow! Is this a great soup for a hot summer dinner!! Excellent starter for salmon. I used dijon mustard and it worked out well.

Great flavor. Goes very well in the summer, on a hot day. Stay with the recipe, and you will be fine. Very easy to make.

I thought this soup was ok; my husband really liked it. In the future, I would skip the finely chopped cucumber added at the end. I think it would taste better if it were just a creamy soup -- rather than a crunchy soup. Also, based on other reviews, I added some hot sauce. I think this was a mistake. It should be a cool soup, and the hot sauce just didn't work for me.

Boy, I hate to be a downer, but I thought the soup was bland. (My allergies have been acting up, so maybe I wasn't tasting all the flavor.) I found another recipe that called for garlic and stirring in more yogurt at the end to make a creamier texture. I did this and made the soup much better, but I think I'll just use the other recipe next time.

I made this for a Thai New Years celebration. It was very refreshing. I added more mint and some garlic-chile paste for some pizzaz.

I love this soup. It embodies coolness, and I was so happy to finally get great weather this week so I could make it. In fact, I am waiting right now to go home over lunch and add the last cup of cucumbers and the mint. Last time I made it I accidentally added the chopped mint with the rest of the ingredients in the blender, and that worked out fine too. I also added just a drop of Tabasco for a kick. So many variations, but it really is a refreshing thing to eat.

Light and refreshing. Made this with broiled spicy lamb chops, so it really added a nice contrast. i added more mint than called for in the recipe. worked great!

Very good recipe that is easy to make. Served with a lamb roast and wow what a great combo. Refridgerated overnight and think that is a big key.

This was a really great, light refreshing soup that got a lot of compliments, AND, it was super easy. I tried it a few ways and think I like it better with less sour cream, and more yogurt. And, it worked well with some dijon mustard instead of the dry mustard. I also put a lot of black pepper in one batch (by accident) but it worked really well in contrast to the coolness of the soup and mint.

So easy to make and very refreshing.

followed the recipe exactly and pleased with results except it was a bit too thick-add some icecubes before serving which makes it very cold as well as diluting it.

The best. Period.
