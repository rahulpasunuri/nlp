These pancakes are amazing! They have a nice consistency and just the right amount of sweetness. I am not a pancake lover but since I found this recipe I find myself craving pancakes. Definitely a keeper

My son's favorite pancake recipe! We use this recipe almost every few weeks. I cut back a little on the sugar and butter (4-5 tablespoons instead of 6). And I substitute the tablespoons of butter with 3 tablespoons of flaxseed meal to thicken the batter a little. To make even healthier pancakes, I use 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup of all purpose flour. I make smaller pancakes to make flipping the pancakes easier and for portion control. I've had no problems with the consistency of the batter with these adjustments. My son made his own suggestion: add 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter. Very yummy!

Great no-buttermilk-in-the-fridge pancake recipe. Use half the sugar though, and don't be so literal about making them so big! When people write 'light', they probably mean that this is not a 'heavy bomb in the stomach' pancake. I have made them 4-5 times and have not faced the consistency issues others have complained about - the problem was probably the cook, not the recipe!

A little too thin for my tastes as well but a nice light pancake. I also halved the sugar as that seemed for too generous.

Just what i was looking for very easy pancakes! And taste good too :)

these really are good, I would use a bit less sugar next time, and they are too rich, something you should probably only have once in a while, I used canola oil instead of butter or margarine. And it is much better than the premixed store version, I make them smaller because it makes it easier to flip, and mine get fluffy too, I dont know how one reader says they came out thin and crepey, maybe its all about technique!

We have been making these pancakes for about 3 years now, and we love them. While we love buttermilk pancakes the best, this is our regular recipe as buttermilk is not a staple I regularly purchase. I love the ease of this recipe - it is easy and fast to make, the pancakes are light and fluffy, and I always have the ingredients. We take these on vacation with us too. I premix the dry ingredients prior to leaving, and then do the wet when we are there. Don't double this recipe if you have more people - it chemically changes the composition and they don't turn out right. These pancakes are on the sweeter side, so you don't need much syrup. These are a really kid hit!

Rating: 4
Every time I make these for family or friends I get RAVES. People love them. They are the fluffiest pancake I've ever made. I usually use 1/2 the sugar, otherwise they are rather sweet. But wow, light, great texture, and great taste. I double it all the time and it works fine.

This was an ok recipe. A little too cakey and sweet for me.

I do not use the sugar they call for in this recipe but this batter makes the most consistently wonderful pancakes. I hate to admit that I ever used boxed pancake mix....but never again, this is far tooeasy and make far superiour pancakes.

I really like this recipe as a standard pancake. I make it for my three young kids so in order to make it a bit healthier I half the amount of sugar, use half whole grain flour to reg. flour and add about a tblspn of flaxseed meal. The batter is thick enough for me to add cut up fruit. Maple syrup is not required! The kids love them.

These pancakes tasted OK and the batter was very easy to work with on the pan. The reason why I am giving only two forks is that their flavour doesn't compare to other pancake recipes on this site (try buttermilk pancakes with Blueberry Compote from Bon Appetit - absolutely delicious!)

This is a great fast-and-easy recipe. I prefer pancakes with buttermilk but didnt have any on hand. This recipe is a terrific stand in.

This recipe is disturbing. The butter, for one thing, doesn't seem to do anything for the batter. Both times I made this--once with the called-for amount of milk, the other a split batch with more milk in one part and less milk in the other--the batter was leaden and un-pancakelike. Keep in mind although I am an experienced and accomplished cook, pancakes have never been my deal (growing up, my family was always running too late to do the whole breakfast thing!)but I have found success with other recipes on epicurous--all of which use the acidity of buttermilk to good effect. This recipe produced pancakes that were so un-pancake-like, I turned them into little wraps for scrambled eggs and cheese. Even there, they weren't great; the batter's not all that. I'll still keep looking for a good non-buttermilk recipe.

Rating: 3
I have been making these since I got the magazine :) A few things that I learned along the way: 1) DO NOT double this recipe. It will give you REALLY REALLY thin pankcakes. I don't know why, but every time I doubled they came out wrong. 2) After mixing flour/milk by alternating, add the baking powder and salt. Let sit for at least 5 minutes. I have found this gives a 'fluffier' pancake. Hope this helps.

Rating: 3
Simple. Easy. Fine. But I don't think I've hit on my all-time favorite pancake recipe here. I wanted something w/o buttermilk since I never have that on hand, and didn't feel like doing anything fussy (like messing with whipped egg whites... good grief). I found these on the VERY sweet and slightly rich side. I'm not sure where people are getting "fluffy and light" from... the batter is thin and spreads by itself (hence "giant" pancakes - whether you want them big or not), and light is not an adjective I would proffer up for pancakes with 6 T. of butter in them. Nevertheless, I can see why this is a popular recipe. I will make them again, but will cut down on the sugar next time.

Rating: 4
Made these this morning for my family (that includes 2 hungry boys) & it was a hit. The pancakes were tasty. We had them plain, but in the future I'll also try adding some blueberries or cherries. The best part: they are so big that I don't have to stand at the stove making pancake after pancake. Also, the pancake ingredients are everything you'd typically have in your fridge. (I don't normally have buttermilk on hand.)

As a basic pancake recipe, which is what I was looking for, this is excellent. I don't have time to go to the store to buy all of the ingredients to make the gourmet recipes on this site. Next time, I will try separating the eggs and whipping the whites as another person suggested, because I did think they cooked a little thin. My wife and kids loved them, though. To the people who are complaining about this recipe, I say go and make a more fancy pancake, but for a basic pancake this was fine.

It's hard to find a simple pancake recipe that doesn't call for buttermilk, but this one is good. It's a little more eggy than most. Quite easy to make. All the stuff about heating the pancakes in the oven can be dispensed with, if you don't insist that the whole batch be ready at the same time. You can just fry the pancakes and give each one to a family member as they are ready.

Before flipping, I sprinkled the pancakes with apple bits that I sauteed in roasted walnut oil, cinnamin and freshly ground nutmeg. Light and fluffy - a great basic recipe.

I looked for a great pancake recipe after my five-year-old daughter told me she'd rather go to IHOP than to have my homemade, all organic, wheat germ enhanced pancakes. Well, I know a challenge when I hear one. We've made this twice now and the second time I actually stooped to new levels while impressing my children when I actually did add chocolate chips. And blueberries for their daddy. In all modesty, I must say that I have reclaimed my rightful place as chief pancake purveyor. This is a great, fluffy, giant pancake. Most impressive, especially to the small set.

I used this recipe, and seperated the eggs, using the egg yolks to whisk together w/flour, milk, baking powder. Then whipping the whites until peaks formed, I folded them in at the end. They came out nice & fluffy!

I've used this recipe for pancakes for the past few years, calling it the Perfect Pancake recipe. Not too long ago, however, in a fit of innovation, I made these with 6 eggs instead of 2, and added about 1/3 cup pumpkin puree that I had left over from making a cheesecake. Oh, WOW! All those eggs added a custardy flavor and texture and we topped the pancakes with apples that had been sauteed in butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. Even my finicky 2-year old wolfed these down. I might add that I dumped in a bit of wheat germ, flax seed meal, and substituted whole wheat flour for half of the white flour for a more nutrient-dense pancake and even these additions did not detract from the yummy, decadent flavor or texture. Good stuff, I tell you.

This is the only pancake recipe we use now, and we love it! It is so easy and tastes great-- we get rave reviews on our pancakes every time.

Itried this recipe but changed it a bit. Only had two eggs, added only 5 tblsps of butter, and didn't have any milk on hand so I used coconut milk instead. The results were good, light and yummy.

I have made this recipe twice and each time they turn out thin. I thought it was because I added a tablespoon of vanilla, but even after adding more flour they were still thin. Even though they did not turn out like I had planned, my kids and the neighborhood kids gobbled them up and wanted more. So, if they like them, I will make this again and again. I just wish they were more fluffy. Maybe I'm stirring them too much? I'll experiment with this recipe ...

I eat pancakes in an unusual way. I like them slightly sweet but undercooked, almost raw in the center (yeah, I know). These were perfect for my strange taste. They were heavy, I thought.

I had a chance to have these for the holiday's. My brother, who is a medical doctor not a chef, made these for his family, myself, wife and 18 yr. old vegetarian daughter. She is the food problem. She now can be quoted as saying,"These are the best pancakes I've ever eaten." I have now found the recipe and have sent it to her @ Rutger University in New Brunswick, NJ. If she doesn't make it now, snowbound in college (we are having a snow emergency with now approx 16" of snow on the ground) or when DAD, who is the chef, can make them at home.

If you want to try a really great pancake recipe, go to the Buttermilk Pancake recipe on this site, and find the recipe that Cook from Toronto posted in the comment section.

Try it - you will not be disappointed!

Boston, I've often wondered the same thing about why the ratings are so high, and I agree with you that this pancake recipe and most of the recipes offered on this site are not as good as they are cracked up to be. I have a feeling that the majority of cooks on Epicurious are novices who have nothing else to compare these dishes to, and they haven't discovered "the real thing" yet. Actually, Bisquick pancakes would be better than these. Why do I come to this site? I do enjoy the reviews, have found several good recipes, and become inspired to cook and bake when I read the reviews of the many cooks.

Excellent pancakes recipe. Simple as pancakes should be. I printed it out and taped it inside my kitchen cabinet, ready to go. A favorite for a Sunday brunch. I used skim milk or 2% without noticing any big difference. If you find this recipe flavorless go back to your Bisquick.

Unlike a cook from Boston, I have found many wondeful recipes here, however this was not one of them. I added a 1/4 tsp of vanilla and yet they were flavorless, well they did have a flavor, of flour.

There only up shot was a light texture but it could not make up for the heavy feeling after eating the flavorless batch

I usually make pancakes from an old Betty Crocker recipe and tried these for a change. I thought they might be a little on the heavy side with 3 eggs but they weren't at all. The 1st pancake I cooked in butter according to rec but it made a crust around the edge so for the remaining I eliminated the butter and they came out fine. We liked them and I will make them again but my standard recipe has a better texture.

Huh? I simply don't get it. I've tried several recipes from this data base that have gotten high raves, and have thought they were terrible. This one is no exception. I followed directions to the point (except for adding a touch of vanilla), and the pancakes were flat and tasteless. I have a reputation as an excellent cook; although that reputation is being tarnished by some of these 3-4 star ratings on recipes. My tastes are normal, as are those of my family and guests. Are these ratings for real, or could it be that some folks just like to join in? Sorry, but these were miserable.

I HATE pancakes, but I wanted to make something special for Easter brunch. Found these to be surprisingly light and tasty, not greasy and heavy like most pancakes are. One word of caution: do not leave them in the oven for too long, as they will become dry and crispy. The first few pancakes I made stayed in the oven too long and tasted like pancake cookies, but the later ones turned out terrific. I will definitely make these again!

THESE PANCAKES HAVE A WONDERFUL TEXTURE...LIGHT AND FLUFFY. I DID FIND THEM A LITTLE TOO SWEET AND CUT THE SUGAR IN HALF...DELICIOUS! I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A GREAT "FROM SCRATCH" RECIPE FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS BY FAR THE WINNER. THE INGREDIENTS ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE AROUND MAKING IT EASY TO BE SPONTANEOUS. SOME TIPS: TEST THE PAN TO SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH BY SPRINKLING A FEW DROPS OF WATER ON IT. IF THE WATER BOUNCES AND SPATTERS IT'S READY. AFTER MELTING THE BUTTER ON THE PAN, WIPE THE SURFACE WITH A PAPER TOWEL, LEAVING A THIN FILM. TOO MUCH BUTTER WILL RESULT IN "FRIED" PANCAKES--CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE AND UNDERCOOKED ON THE INSIDE.

I've made these pancakes many times and they are a frequent request around my house! Very fluffy and easy to flip, even when you make them large. I never thought two people could finish the recipe, but we always do! I always make them with blueberries and serve with real maple syrup.

This recipe made some great pancakes. I added a touch more milk than the recipe called for and I have experimented with substituting maple syrup for some of the sugar and adding vanilla. I think that added a bit more complex flavor...not that pancakes have to be particularly complex. Still, it was a nice touch.

Although my mother feels that the dish is too sweet, I like it that way. I think that the sugar gives the "homemade taste" that makes it oh-so-good. Also, you don't get that lovely powder from the mixes all over the place. It was just as easy to prepare as the mix, but tasted MUCH better!
