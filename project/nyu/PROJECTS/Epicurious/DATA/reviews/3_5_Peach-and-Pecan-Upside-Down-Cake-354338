I'd definitely make it again, but with some changes. I don't mind the heaviness; I agree with the reviewer who said a dense-ish, moist, spicy peach cake is perfect for those first few crisp nights of late summer/early fall. What I'd change: 2/3 C sugar is indeed plenty, and I agree that (while the topping is lovely) the cake itself is a bit bland. Adding blueberries and mashed or finely diced peaches is a good idea, or else add more cinnamon & some ginger for a spicier, more flavorful cake.

Absolutley great! I had 3 eggs left, so I used that plus 2tsp bake powder. I also added mashed peach with 1/2 milk(i used cream)and added pint frozen blueberries. Anyway it was a hit!

this cake was absolutely delicious! i made it exactly as written, except i reduced the sugar in the cake to 2/3 instead of a full cup. next time i would further reduce it to 1/2. everybody loved this cake!

Excellent recipe. I used pears instead of peaches, walnuts instead of pecans, and added a bit of ginger to the mix. Absolutely fantastic! The cake was dense enough to hold its shape, but still nice and light. Good flavor, although it makes a bit too much brown sugar sauce, i'd cut back on that next time.

Bland, not interesting.

This is a good cake, but not great. Despite the fact it features a summer fruit, the spices and heaviness of the cake make it seem more like what I think of as an autumn dessert.

We made this cake this morning to bring to our church coffee hour. It is the last Sunday of summer and the cake seem to taste like the transition from summer to fall! With coffee, it was perfect. Though for my taste, I would definitely ease up on the nutmeg. Overpowered the peach a bit. I think that the peaches need some extra zing- I will squeeze some lemon on them before adding them to the pan. I think as a midsummer desert, I might be inclined to omit the spice and add some lemon zest to the batter. If the peaches weren't as ripe as they were, the lemon might not be necessary. Better as a coffee cake rather than a desert.

First, let me say that I am a HORRIBLE baker. The only reason I decided to make this recipe was because I had left over peaches that were going to go bad if I didn't do something with them. Although a somewhat "involved" recipe for someone who typically considers "baking" mixing batter from a box and throwing it in the oven,it wasn't overly complicated. The best part is that it tastes as good as it looks! Moist and delicious! Definitely something I'll make again!

I made this cake for friends last week, and we ABSOLUTELY loved it! I substituted 1 T ground flax seed and 3 T water for each egg, which worked very well! A moist yet dense result-- It also looked beautiful-- Might be fun to try this recipe with pears or even apples!

Yes, it is easy and presents well. But it's uninspired, a tad too heavy, and much too sweet. More fruit, perhaps some lemon peel?

This cake is delicious. I used a 10 inch pan and there was still plenty of batter to cover the peaches. The spices and ground pecans add nice complexity to the flavor. No problem getting it out of the pan; it looks really impressive. I agree with other reviewers that it would benefit from more peaches.

A wonderful marriage of favors. The spices and pecans in the batter added the special touch of a spice cake that complimented the peaches. I made this cake the two days before a sailing weekend trip. It made a lovely presentation,transported and held up well. It was a big hit. My husband who is not a dessert lover gave it high marks. As suggested by other reviewers I used more peaches. A wonderful use of summertime peaches.

The quality of this cake depends on the quality of your ingredients. I get summer peaches, eggs, and butter from the farmers' market. And I grate the nutmeg and cinnamon from whole spices myself. Delicious! If I had an ice cream maker, I'd top it with homemade bourbon-vanilla ice cream.

This is a tasty and very pretty cake. I think it could use more peaches to really amp up the peach flavor. The pecans are fantastic here. This cake doesn't require a lot of messing around in the kitchen (though it does use a lot of dishes), so it's a good choice for a casual meal. I'll make it again for sure.

Pretty and transports well but rather heavy for a summer cake. Not a whole lot of flavor

I had high hopes for this cake - it sounded really good when I read it and the picture was appealing. The outcome was so-so... not bad but not great. Will I make it again? Maybe, but there have been many cakes that we much better.

This was such a delicious take on what can be a bland dessert (i.e. plain peach upside down cake). The pecans and spice in the better gave the cake terrific depth of flavor and the peach flavor was the perfect complement. The pecans around the edge made the whole thing extra beautiful. Best of all, it was still delicious the next day. Often fruit-topped cakes go soggy and ick. Yum!

Very easy recipe to follow and results were lovely. Great presentation and the taste was fantastic I did cut back on the nutmeg though to about 1/4 tsp. freshly grated.
