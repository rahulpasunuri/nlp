this was a good recipe but instead of sherry or brandy (which I did not use) for the non alcholic version I(for children and pregnate women) used 1/2 cup pureed strawberries. You could also probably subsitute strawberries with : mulberries, blackberries, blueberries, and huckleberries (depending which is in season for maximum freshness)

My husband is English and just loved this dessert. Although rich, it's not too sweet and is a wonderful ending to a meal. Made in a decorative mold it makes a wonderful presentation.
