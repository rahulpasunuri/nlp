Thought I'd found a good use for some frozen zucchini, but will need to try it with fresh to compare. Good, but nothing special. The Cook from Phoenix below has some good recommendations to try...

More work intensive than it seems. Iti is always a pain in the butt to strain these soups, so I might consider belending but not straining it. Otherwise very tasty.

I probably changed this too much to review it fairly but I omitted the food processing step, added shitake mushrooms, chicken breast, and fresh dill then simmered. Before serving I squeezed a wedge of fresh lime in each bowl, finely grated a hard cheese... I think I used romano, added freshly ground pepper and fresh, thinly sliced shallots on top. mmmmmmm..... it's a 4 now.........
