A great choice for a weeknight meal. A little something green and some good buttered bread on the side is all it needs. I substituted cod for the halibut since that what was available, and I bought deveined shrimp which made peeling quick and painless. Leftovers were delicious, too!

this was AMAZING!! I did add hot pepper flakes and garlic (powder). And I used Muir Glen organic diced tomatoes w/ Italian herbs. and I used 2 potatoes. And simmered for a LOT longer than called for. But it was fabulous. Rave!!

We make this a lot. We use whatever white fish is fresh and as well as the shrimp we add clams and mussels. We have also added carrots. We just put the pot on the table with a really good bread and a salad and we have had rave reviews and requests for the recipe.

Dee-licious! I've made this dish 3 times now, and there are never any leftovers. I use good bacon, fresh tomato, and a mix of onion and leek. A great Saturday night dinner on the patio. Goes well with a Chalone Chardonnay. Will make this again and again and again.

Love this recipe and we make it quite often. I like to use salmon instead of halibut (because of $) and peppered bacon. Sometimes I will use leeks and onions. We always serve it with garlic parmesan toasts that we make from a nice crusty baguette. Great for sopping and additional flavor.

This soup drew rave reviews from my dinner guests last night. I followed the recipe exactly, except used 6 ounces of bacon, instead of 8. I prepared the soup in the afternoon and added the halibut and shrimp just before serving. The key is to not let the fish cook too long. It was very flavorful and paired with buttermilk biscuits and a Parsley, Radicchio and Napa Cabbage salad was a perfect informal dinner.

My fish was fresh, the wine a good one, the tomatoes San Marzano... so why was this such a disappointment? Lacked in flavor, and I know it wasn't because of mediocre ingredients... it was the mediocre recipe.

It was OK- but to save money, I'd use smaller shrimp and a less expensive fish. Over the course of a couple days, the flavors did develop some, but overall...just so so.

This recipe is very well-designed. If you work quickly you can prepare each ingredient in the time it takes to cook the previous ingredient, with one exception: peeling the shrimp - you may want to do that beforehand if you don't have someone helping you. But I think it takes longer than 5 min. to "simmer until potato is tender", anyway! A little too "meaty" for my taste (I'm not much of a carnivore). Delicious broth, will make again with half as much bacon & shrimp and adding green beans, maybe zuchini too? Also a few saffron threads. One question: Why "transfer 1/3 of bacon to bowl?" Does that mean the serving bowl? So it stays crispy? I just threw mine back in the pot.

I couldn't get Halibut at the local markets so I used Sea Bass. This recipe was incredible. It was so tasty that my daughter and her boyfriend took home the leftovers for dinner the next night - they added a few scallops to the mix to fill it out and they loved it as much as leftovers.

I made this last night omitting the potato and fish but adding lots of garlic, some red pepper flakes and salt and pepper. Then I strained it and used the broth to steam mussels. It was outstanding! I would recommend this method to use as a soup base or to serve as a clear soup before a formal dinner.

This was wonderful! I had to make a few substitutions: I didn't have fresh fennel so used fennel seed (would have probably been better with fresh fennel bulb). I also used garlic instead of onion (not a huge onion fan). And instead of pork bacon, I used turkey bacon (much healthier, but needed to add some olive oil). Also I added some seasonal squash. Even with all of my crazy substitutions, this was great - I will definitely make it again. One note: If you use frozen shrimp, be sure to add it in BEFORE the halibut, so that the fish doesn't overcook. I served it with crusty Italian garlic bread, and a nice light Sauvignon Blanc.

What's not to love? Very flavorful, fast and easy to make ahead and good enough to serve as a casual meal with guests. Serve it with hearty rolls and a green salad and you have dinner!

Ick. This was awful. Waste of $$$$ and time. I kid you not, we ended up throwing out and ordering Thai food.

THIS IS AN AWESOME RECIPE. IT'S EASY TO MAKE, INCLUDING ON A CAMPFIRE-AS WE DID FOR NEW YEARS EVE, in the dark!! I think we would substitute scallops instead of the halibut next time and you definantly need some rice, cous cous, or rolls.

Thanks for this quick and delicious recipe. We relish this dish with crusty French bread on blustery winter evenings.

Haven't made it but will and I will make these changes. Cook the bacon until dark brown slowly. This keeps it almost crunch even when sitting in liquid and makes the dish much richer in flavour. I'd use red wine instead of white. I'd add only some tomatoe juice with the tomatoes to keep it thicker and simmer for longer. Hold in fridge until the next day as flavours will meld. I'd add some fresh herbs at the end-probably basil and perhaps a splash of pernod or anisette...maybe some scallops yum!

One of the most disappointing recipes I've tried from Epicurious. The stew was positively tasteless, and the crispy fried bacon became a soggy mess sitting in all that broth. Neither my husband nor I liked this one; I'd be interested to hear if anyone has any tips for making this a better recipe, because it sounded like it had so much promise.
