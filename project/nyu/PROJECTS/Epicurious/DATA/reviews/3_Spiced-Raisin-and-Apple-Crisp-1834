Adequate but not great. I had no apple juice and substituted hard cider. I also added 1/2 c walnuts to the topping and that gave it some interest, but not enough to mitigate the ordinary flavor.

Wonderful -- a little more flavor than the standard crisp recipes. Whole family loved it!

Great recipe - I added allspice and oatmeal to the topping-mix as well, and used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Yummy!!!

This recipe was fairly easy to make, I used dried cherries in place of the raisins. I would make it again.
