This is my go-to recipe when I am planning a heavy meal (reductions sauces, 5 courses, etc.). By the time dessert rolls around, people love the light consistency and soft lemon flavor. The caramel sauce is delightful, and again on the lighter side. Serve with a few fresh blueberries and a mint leaf on the top, and at the side of the souffle. Also, use the smaller ramekins.

I just made this for Easter. I loved the consistency of the souffles. I thought the caramel sauce was okay. It seemed to be lacking a bit. There are much better caramel recipes on this website that I have used. I did add extra lemon zest to the caramel and a pinch of salt (which I think caramel always needs yet so often recipes lack). I also hate using corn syrup so perhaps I would try it again with a different caramel or perhaps with a raspberry sauce or wild blueberry one?? Easy enough to make again.

The souffles were wonderful but not especially sweet so the carmel sauce was perfect. They had a great texture, very light. There was extra carmel sauce but in my family, that is a bonus. I will make again but possibly use pasteurized eggs to avoid having to heat the whites (almost scrambled them).

I made this for a dinner party of 4 and we all enoyed both the souffles and the caramel sauce. However, I would warn others that the recipe filled to the brim only 4-6oz custard cups (with a small amunt left over) not 6 as the recipe states.

OOPS, I MEANT TO SAY AFTER STAINING THE CUSTARD THEN I WOULD PUT IN THE LEMON ZEST

For you out there that have not made this recipe a word of advice. 1. After making the custard, and before adding the lemon zest I would strongly advise puttin the custard throug a fine sieve. This way you will remove any of the egg that just might overcook. Then add the lemon juice. I found the recipe had a lovely texture, but I would have to admit the caramel sauce gives this recipe it's flavour. I certainly would make this again..

The lemon souffles were devine. However, I just could not imagine having them with caramel so I substituted a blueberry wine sauce. My guests and I really enjoyed the lemon blueberry combination.

This is an excellent light lemony dessert perfect for a spring dinner. To the reviewer who didn't like the consistancy - the name should have given it away, souffle is supposed to be meringue-like, light and fluffy not dense like a custard.

I agree with Nicole from Danville. I was totally disappointed -- served it for my Easter dessert. Too complicated for the end result which is just so-so. There was not enough lemony tartness either. Way too much carmel sauce.

The lemon souffles were a definite hit. Easy to make and delightful after a feast. However, I couldn't imagine a lemon - caramel combination so I served the souffles with a blueberry wine sauce. Excellent complement of flavours.

This was a little disappointing...liked it, but definitely didn't love it. The caramel and lemon flavors together were good but I didn't care for the consistency of the 'souffle.' The picture makes it appear very creamy and flan-like but it's really quite meringue-ish. Next time will try a lemon creme brulee or flan (though they will be, or course, much richer which some might not want).

This dessert was a great hit at my recent dinner party. One guest in the restaurant business took the recipe to work to see if their chef would make it at their fine dining establishment! I'm making it for Easter dessert.
