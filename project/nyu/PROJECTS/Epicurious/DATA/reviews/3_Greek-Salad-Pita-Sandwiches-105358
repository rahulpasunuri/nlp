Added some cooked chicken and red onion, but would have been fine without. Very glad to know that I always have all the ingredients I need on hand for this (no fresh herbs)

Very good, easy, quick and light. Great for a summer lunch. I only put the feta in the pita and ate the salad separately.

Great light summer dinner. I cut the oil and tad and skipped the salt and pepper, since it was already flavorful enough. Definitely a remake and would recommend it.

I find this a flavourful dish that all guest to my home have enjoyed. With lots of feta and some fresh oregano it hits the spot every time. Even friends that are watching their waist enjoy this dish with little guilt.

Try it with one part white wine vinegar to two parts olive oil and lots of dried basil and oregano.

I have found Epicurious to be responsive to errors on their web site by clicking on "Help" at the bottom of this page and typing them a message under the categories "Technical Difficulties" or "Other Feedback."

A great quick and tasty dish.. By the way, for all who were misdirected, the tuna recipe is at this address: http:www.epicurios.com/run/recipe/view?id=105356.

It is interesting that Epicurious obviously does not read these reviews (and correct the associated errors) before deeming something the most popular. Is there a moderator in the house?

How funny that the reason this is probably making the "most talked about" is because there was some computer error that everyone's upset about. I found it by accident. Light, tasty, very casual for a casul group. Great end-of-summer dinner!

Hey, lighten up on dishfan, who only pointed out the obvious and wasn't nearly as rude as MANY reviewers are on "constant comment". One would presume that someone able to access this site would have a clue re: searching for a recipe (the SEARCH BOX on every page?)....or otherwise bother to read all the reviews before complaining.

This was a perfect meal for a summer evening. I doubled the dressing and marinated peeled shrimp in the extra for 1 hour, then grilled the shrimp for 2" a side.

Let me get this straight. Most of you guys (mainly the reviewers whose posts I can see immediately below the recipe) will take the time to whine that the link was wrong, but you WON'T take the time to click the link to the rest of the reviews and notice that the correct link was posted by another reviewer, and you WON'T do a search on the web site for the correct recipe. Astounding. http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=105356

Did I miss something??? What happened to the tuna and the pasta? Hidden in the Pita maybe?

Yooooo Hoooooo! Anybody home?! I rated this one low because it is not as advertised. What happened to the spaghetti and tuna recipe! But since we are on the topic of tuna fish..... try adding horseradish capers and chopped dill pickles to your normal tuna fish preparation and I bet you'll like it! Even in a pita!!!

Great sandwich and a nice surprise. I can always find the spaghetti recipe. Also good with grilled tuna, grouper or chicken added.

C'mon Mcnair, aren't just a little bit epi-curious to try this one. This is one very fabdelicious site (the best I come across in a while). If ya don't like the heat...

From London, Ontario- This web site is in a class by itself. I think it is very generous for Gourmet and Bon Appetit magazines to grant us this site. Thank you!

Had to chuckle at the while reading the reviews. FYI, I made the REAL tuna with spaghetti recipe last week and it was a 4 star. Now I'll try this one and I'm sure it will be great!

Sounds delicious! I saved it to my recipe box. Just think - another fun, quick recipe while searching for the Tuna Spaghetti recipe I saw in my New Batch E-mail (which I found at "view?id=105356")

All I have to say is that it really isn't that serious. It's a great sandwich. Thanks for the recipe.

Even though I thought I was getting a tuna speg. recipe, I like the sound of this, and gave it a try. We loved it. Really nice for these hot Central Texas days.

To the eastern-seaboarder: Don't take life so seriously. Try this recipe instead ... you just might like it! We;re lucky to have a service like this.

Hi! The Pita sandwich looks terrific and will try it. Instead of complaining guys just do a recipe search and you find the spaghetti with tuna recipe right where it should be.

Very satisfying sandwich. A splash of red wine vinegar is a tasty addition with, or instead of, the lemon juice. To make a more substantial meal out of it, add cooked red kidney beans to the salad mixture.
