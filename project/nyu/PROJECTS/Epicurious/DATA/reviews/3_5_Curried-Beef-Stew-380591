Good dish but the curry paste was very sharp. I had to coconut milk to tone down the sharpness of the curry paste. Really good curry but given the amount of work involved in making this, I probably won't cook it again.

The curry from scratch was great, but if you want to simplify, buy a can of Maesri yellow curry paste. It's a step saver and tastes almost as good after it's all cooked. I agree fresh kaffir leaves are a must though. Very dstinctive flavor. As far as the heat, just like anything else, add or remove to suit your taste.

Made this dish over the weekend and all guests comments where 'wow,fantastic, exceptional, amazing'. Only change was adding julienned red bell pepper, also served over jasmine rice (ginger/garlic added). Caution with the chilis, mine turned out a bit hot, but guests were foodies and enjoyed the heat. Kaffir lime leaves are a must.

The broth was delicious, but a LOT of work. I only used 1/2 the ground dried Thai chiles and it was plenty spicy. Not enough veggies for my liking.
