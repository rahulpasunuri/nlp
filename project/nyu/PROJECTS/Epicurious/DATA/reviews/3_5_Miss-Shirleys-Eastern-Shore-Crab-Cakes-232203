Not crab cakes - more like "crab cake crumbles." The flavor was ok (nothing to get crazy over) My biggest problem with this recipe was that the crab cakes fell apart as they were cooking. I followed the directions exactly but was disappointed about serving "crab cake crumbles" to my family.

Very tasty. I made half a portion (1lb of crab meat) for an appetizer.

I use way more old bay (2-3 tblspoons), substitute quark for mayo/mustard, use italian parsley, and crushed saltines instead of breadcrumbs. Sprinkle crab cakes w/add'l old bay, and then broil.

This recipe is the real deal. I prefer crackers to white bread, but, either way these come out great if not over mixed or over cooked.

GREAT CRAB CAKES. THE PROCESS OF MIXING THE INGREDIENTS AND FOLDING IN CRAB MEAT IS A GREAT IDEA. MADE THESE FOR OUR ANNUAL BEACH WEEK IN NAGS HEAD NC. WOULD ANY ONE HAVE A SUGGESTION OF REMOVING SHELLS FROM CRAB MEAT?

Great recipe with lots of crab taste and very little filler. I broiled mine and was very careful not to break up the crab lumps. I also used a little panko to help bind it together. How could a Maryland person think these are gross when they're the real thing!

What a waste of delicious crab. These were gross.

These crab cakes are very, very good. Note that the recipe here uses the plural word for "mustards" but lists only dry mustard. The recipe on Ms. Shirley's seasonings container purchased at my grocery store calls for regular mustard also. Perhaps the regular mustard was left out in the list of ingredients printed online?

This is my "go to" crab cake recipe....its on the Phillips crab container and have been using it for years. The only things I do differently is use crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs and flour the cakes just before I fry them. Nice balance of flavors, and the emphasis is on the crab not the filling. Do mix all your "other" ingredients first, fold in the crab last so it doen't get broken up to much ...you want those nice big chunks. Lovely recipe.
