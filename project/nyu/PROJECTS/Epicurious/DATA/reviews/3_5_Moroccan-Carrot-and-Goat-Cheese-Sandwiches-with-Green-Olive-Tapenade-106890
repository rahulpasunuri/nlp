The only thing that's Moroccan about this is the cumin. Goat cheese and tapenade?

The carrots are flipping insane!!! You could put them on a lot of different sandwiches - with meat, possibly cheddar, and the list goes on. Fantastico.

I used this tapenade with seared tuna and whole wheat pasta. It was fabulous! I used green olives that were stuffed with garlic, which added depth.

Had a friend's interpretation of this dish at an office party. Loved the flavors. Tried this recipe for New Year's Eve dinner appetizer. It was a hit. I will make my own tweaks, but plan to enjoy this one again and again.

Made this for a 2 year olds birthday party, parents and kids loved it!

I make this all the time for special luncheon events (shower, birthday parties, etc.) as a veggie option and everyone always raves. It's a little work, but the end result is so worth it!

I love the carrots! The sandwich per the recipe is good, but I prefer a different combination - carrots from this recipe, hummus, and slices of cucumber in the middle, on multigrain bread. It tastes great, doesn't fall apart as much, and easy to make in the mornings before work.

When I read this recipe and the reviews, I had to try it. Made it for my husband and myself for a Father's Day picnic while the kids ate fluffernutters. It was in my opinion just ok. I wanted to like it more but it just didn't happen. I'm not a quitter though. I will try it again with a different cheese. Maybe ricotta like another person did. Use a premade tapenade or olive salad, keep carrots the same (as they were the highlight here) and perhaps toast the bread to give the textures a little contrast.

My 4 year-old loves this dish. It makes a great lunch with flatbread too.

These little sandwiches are amazing! The combination of flavors is so unique. I have a friend who cuts them into quarters and removes the crusts for delicious and sophisticated party food.

These sandwiches are very delicious. The lemony tang of the tapenade was a wonderful compliment to the spicy sweetness of the carrots. I couldn't find pumpernickel in my neighborhood bakeries, unfortunately, but substituted a hearty olive bread and that worked well. I will definitely make these again.

I make this recipe all the time. It's a great, no cook summer concoction that's light but satisfying. A few cheats I regularly employ to save time and money are to use premade olive salad (ingredients are essentially the same: lemon peel, etc.)from my local Whole Foods supermarket and hand-dipped ricotta from the same (maybe not as much bite as the goat cheese, but doesn't compete with the other two strongly flavored salads either). The carrots are really the secret ingredient which I make faithfully to the recipe (this time I was out of sugar, so substituted honey - it's even better).

I made the recipe as written and it could not have been any better. Made two sandwiches right after making and enjoyed throughly. A couple of days later made two more sandwiches and the flavor was even better. Yes, this sandwich will be made again.

I didn't make the olive tapenade and simply used a purchased one. The carrot mixture is delicious, and would be great even on its own as a side dish. These are also good made as pressed, grilled panini.

I make this recipe at least once a month for tea at the restaurant I work in. People love it. It is so easy, I love it too.

Fabulous flavor combination. I served the carrots, tapenade and goat cheese in separate bowls for guests to spread atop middle eastern flat bread as an appetizer with cocktails. In retropspect I would have pureed the carrots a bit to make them spreadable.

I had to rerate this recipe since I had it again at a friends house. When I made it I made it exactly as written and thought it was missing something(and I like meatless sandwiches). Well my friend made it with spicy soppresata and it made the whole sandwich. It was amazing! I will definatly make the sandwich again with this addition.

I used this recipe for an upscale 'seminar box lunch' for a group of hard-to-impress female foodies - they simply raved about this sandwich. . .interesting, flavorful, terrific eye-appeal! We used great bread, in addition to good olives.

A not so typical sandwich -- the tapenade and the carrots individually were average, but combining the two along with the goat cheese was wonderful. I also agree with the other reviewer about the need to use the best quality olives available. This does take a little prep time, but the carrots and the tapenade could be prepared a day in advance. Will make again -- very soon.

My guests loved it, but I thought it was barely average...esp. considering all the prep.

I loved this sandwich. Exotic flavors and easy to make. I made it as an appetizer but substituted a lavash bread (very large flour tortilla), spread and rolled up the fillings, cut 2-inch thick slices and placed a toothpick in each. Warn your friends that it's a little spicy (with the cayenne pepper) but for me that's a good thing!

If you're making the tapenade yourself make sure you use good olives because they are very dominant. Mine weren't soo good. But the sandwich nevertheless tasted great. Had it for dinner, openend a bottle of Italian red wine which complimented the sandwich perfectly.

mmmmm! Used already prepped matchstick carrots bought in a bag from the store instead of doing what recipe says. If I was a in a friskier mood, I might try eliminating the sugar and tossing in a handful of white raisins.

Oh My God! This thing took so long to make. I think I spent about 2 hours on this recipe. Not to mention the time it took to find all of these special foods. But it was worth it. I was very happy with the turn out. You could change things in this recipe to your liking. Just play with it. Dont be worried if you cant get the carrots right. Use sweetened or even viniger cucombers.

First of all, and especially if you live in Kentucky, just skip the sugar altogether (there is no acid to be reduced and no lack of sweetness). Also, I would recommend some wheat free bread and maybe fresh corn tortillas. All-in-all, quite a good addition to any set of handing menus. Be sure to plan in advance as carrots need to be gently brought into the fold of bio-availability.

Carrot marinade is phenom. Could just use the marinated carrots with some basmati rice, maybe a rice salad. The combination is interesting and appealing. I'd even do a mini appetizer with a bread square, light spread of tapenade, slice of carrot and a small dollop of goat cheese.

IF you HAPPEN to have the Moroccan Carrots and Green Olive Tapenade already on hand then you might be able to do this in the suggested time, and it be worth it, but otherwise forget it. It was very flavorful and different, but I won't be making it from scratch again.
