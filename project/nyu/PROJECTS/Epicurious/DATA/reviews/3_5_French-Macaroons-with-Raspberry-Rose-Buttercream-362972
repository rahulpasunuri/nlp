My first attempt at macarons. This recipe came out perfect, with feet and all. Other recipes tend to make the whole macarons-making process like mystical alchemy. Try this recipe if you've never made this cookie.

Macaronnage IS an art. These turned out very well- we got 32 out of the recipe making 1 1/2" cookies. I used rose petals from my rose bush to decorate the top skins of the cookies. The raspberry jelly was difficult and my friend had to thicken with cornstarch. The buttercream was too buttery (like flavored butter) so my other friend added some lemon juice, more of the seedless raspberry jelly and more sugar to taste. Big improvement. The end result was as stunning as it was delicious.

Actually now I made the batter and it was delicious, well the macaroon cookie was. The buttercream is very risky, by that I mean it is very easy to ruin it, the first time I made it it was just too buttery and the second time I made it I did it three times just to make it decent. The cookies I would make smaller because mine spread out to about 2 inches wide, but it was much better then other recipes I've tried.

This is the second time I made them, well the jam and buttercream, but this is the first time I made the macaroons, and it went pretty well, it came to about 15 sandwiches, I just guessed on the 1 1/4 in, one of the commenters said they thought it was 11/4 inch, but they spread out more than I thought. Another posted about rest time and burning, my rest took just about 20 minutes, and my cookies browned pretty quickly, so about 12 minutes total instead of 15. The raspberry jam is a little too watery, and has an unusual taste to it, not too similar to jam from a jar, and the buttercream with egg whites was a great innovation, but even though I really haven't tried buttercream that much, it just tasted like butter and had a bare raspberry flavor, I just added more powdered sugar. I gave it two forks because the baking directions were confusing, like if you need to take out the trays while lowering the temp. and if I cool it in the oven, but I left it in for the tamp change and cooled it outside which seemed more realistic and what was meant. The butter cream and raspberry jam is okay, but together they work pretty well, sweet and sour. I would try this more than once to have some practice to perfect macaroons, and this was one of the easiest recipes for me and less risky than other recipes.

Macaroons won't have 'feet' if you don't let them dry out before baking them. You can let the sit for up to an hour or two before baking.

Let's make no mistake. Meringue is an art. The difference between success at this recipe and a total bomb is getting the egg whites to precisely the right amount of peak vs. wetness. If you haven't baked meringues before, you might want to back up and do a dozen batches of those first. I have, and even so, I had to tackle the recipe twice to get actual cookies... and even in the second batch, some of the cookies were a bit TOO meringue (not wet enough), and a few were a little too wet. That being said, the ones that did turn out were delicious and true to the kind of pastry texture and flavor you find in professional bakeries. TIPS & LESSONS LEARNED - make sure the egg whites are room temp - don't add sugar to the egg whites until the meringue is starting to fluff - use fresh eggs - If the batter is dripping from the bag, your meringue isn't stiff enough and you can't "pipe" it - Find almond flour if you can, but don't expect to be able to sift it with a flour sifter. It's just too coarse. Mainly you're trying to eliminate lumps. While the fresh raspberry jam is delicious, it's too wet for a delicate cookie like this. I added raspberry flavoring to the buttercream mixture and that worked better.

Did anyone have issues with the cooking temp? Mine burned after 5minutes, but it might be my oven. Thanks!

I was a little confused by this recipe. I thought, "what moron would write 11/4" and those would be big cookies anyway." I followed the recipe faithfully anyways, and subsequently realized that it should have been 1-1/4" or 1.25" cookies. So my macarons are huge. However, they are delicious! The buttercream is amazing and it would be fantastic with any dessert. I subtracted a fork for the 11/4" incident.

I would give this recipe 3 1/2 if I could...the macarons came out lovely and delicious -- perfect shiny tops, generous feet, crisp and then chewy texture inside -- but the taste was very sweet. 2 cups of confectioners sugar is more than I typically see in a macaron recipe. That said, if you pair the cookies with a bittersweet ganache it takes the edge off the sugar. I would make them again.

I followed the recipe exactly like indicated, and the macarons came without feet! the flavour was very good, but the cookies looked like normal round cookies and had not the look of macaron. Can anyone tell me what went wrong???

This was the perfect recipe for our first try at macaroons. We doubled the recipe and added food coloring to the cookies before baking. We used pink for the Raspberry-Rose Buttercream and substituted a lemon curd for yellow and a pistachio cream for green. We actually ran out of rose water so we used Chambord liquor instead, just as good! Despite the time it takes they are WORTH it. They were gone in minutes and much better than store bought.

Very good, but the filling was far too complicated, though the buttercream was delicious. Use a light touch when folding the meringue into the almond-sugar mixture, but don't be afraid! If you under-mix it, you won't have feet. If you over-mix, though, and you will have hollow, soft, lumpy macarons with cracked tops. When properly mixed, the batter should be barely uniform, flow in a fat ribbon, and very thickly coat the spatula. Several people have commented that 15 minutes in the oven is too long. I think that's just about right, unless your oven runs hot. A good macaron should be slightly dry, and then filled and allowed to mature for a day or two in an airtight container in the fridge. The filling softens and flavors the cookie. However, in this case you could rest the filled cookies to rest just a few hours, as the jam is moist enough to make the cookies gummy if left alone too long.

Fantastic combination of flavors and textures. I ended up pulling the macaroons after only 5 minutes at the lower temp and some of them were a bit too dark. Next time, I will adjust down the cooking time. Otherwise, I will make this over and over for special events!

Amazing! They are very time-consuming so be fully aware of the time it will take. I was told by many people that I could substitute all-purpose flour for the almond flour. Not True!!! All-purpose flour contains gluten which develops a chewy texture. The almond flour makes for a light, melt-in-your-mouth texture. I won't be making these everyday, but will definitely be added to my collection for special occasions!

I love French macarons and buy them whenever I see them. I've tried to make them at home several times before with recipes using marzipan but they never turned out like I wanted. This recipe gives the shape (rounded but flat on the top and the eggy "feet" at the bottom) and texture (crackly top and chewy inside) that I crave. The trick is to fold the egg whites slowly into the flour mixture and letting the cookies sit at room temp before putting them in the oven. The buttercream filling made me a bit nervous as I was making it but I stuck to the instructions and it came out great. I used red currant jam and orange water instead of rose water to delicious results. You can snip off the corner of a ziplock bag if you don't have a pastry bag and be sure to watch the oven. My cookies could have used 2 minutes at 375 and 4 minutes at 325.

Overall, these are delicious - my almond flour was a little too coarse (should've bought it already-made), so my yield was lower and the cookie probably not quite as delicate. Had no problem with the buttercream curdling, and all times in the recipe were accurate for me. This recipe certainly requires planning, but the outcome is delicious- the combination of the light buttercream and tart raspberry "jam" with the airy & chewy cookie is marvelous.
