This was not that great. Followed the recipe and only lessened the amount of oil a bit. Nothing exciting at all and would not make again.

I hated this. I think it was the mayo, which I even cut with prepared horseradish. I made it to its specifications, perhaps adding a bit more salt than the recipe called for. Next time, I'll just use pesto.

Amazing salad dressing for any time of the year. As suggested: blanch basil, dry in paper towels, cut down olive oil to 4 TBL, cut down salt and I used white balsamic vinegar to keep the bright green color.

This is by far my favorite salad dressing. In the summer, I use my own basil, and I always have some of my homemade mayo on hand, so the combo of those two in any recipe is a sure thing. As per other reviewers, I usually reduce the oil a little bit, but overall the flavor is outstanding. It's also good over leftover cold roast chicken or grilled fish.

This is an excellent dressing! I don't care for oily dressings, so I took the advice from others and used only 2 Tbsp. of oil... it was perfect. When preparing dinner parties I like to do as much as possible in advance. I also needed a large amount of dressing. I blanched the basil for 1 minute before I used it and my dressing stayed a beautiful bright green for several days after. I used regular balsamic vinegar and will try Sherry vinegar next time.

i used rice vinegar and found the dressing too sweet so added about 1 tsp of fresh lemon juice. i also cut way down on the oil and added about 1 T of greek yogurt instead. i blended in a braun hand blender. the taste was superb and the color very attractive. this is a lovely dressing to make when basil is plentiful. i am using it for a nice mixed salad. i am very pleased with how this dressing turned out. will test it on my hubby tonite.

Delicious! And good for my husband, who doesn't like mustard-based vinaigrettes. I add a some white wine vinegar as well, to cut the oil/mayo a bit more. It's a regular in the salad dressing repertoire.

Excellent dressing! Bright and fresh tasting. I cut down the olive oil to 4T like other reviewers suggested, but it was too thick and mine never separated at all in the fridge. Will try with 6T next time to thin out and see what happens. Will be making this a whole bunch.

I found this tasty but waaay too oily - I made it a few minutes before I needed it, and by the time I went to use it, there was quite a bit of oil on top which I spooned off before using. Next time I'd reduce the oil to 4 Tbsp and slowly add more if needed. I think it could also use a little more kick - I'd up the pepper a little. (but we like everything spicy here!)

forgot to add that I, too, used white balsamic as previous reviewer suggested.

terrific dressing! Too salty for my taste, though, so decreased salt to 1/4 tsp on subsequent batch. Also, don't double this recipe. It was way too thin, and when left to sit in fridge, the oil separated and I poured off about 1/3 cup. I might have done something wrong when doubling bec I don't know why this wouldn't double. Next time I made 2 batches and combined them (I held back 2 T of EVOO). Worked fine.

I liked this. It helped me use up my basil. I think next time I will add some lemon zest or lemon juice.

Every one really enjoyed this. Simple to make and a nice change from a garlicky dressing. Definitely repeatable!

Tried this with a simple green salad as a side for a veggie quiche - Tasty! I used half balsamic, half apple cider vinegar - good flavor, better appearance than I'd expect full balsamic would be. I'd be interested to see if it would be good with grated parmesan or romano.

This is the time of year in my CSA that we get basil every week- can only make so much pesto (still have some frozen from last year!). This recipe is perfect for dressing all the greens from the farm pick-ups. Can also double as a dip, put over pasta, you name it. I think the color looks like Green Goddess dressing, but with no where near the fat content!!! This is a keeper and I've shared with my CSA members.

this was absolutely delicious and i normally hate mayonnaise! i subbed out the shallot for 1 garlic clove and vidalia onion and it was still delicous.

It looks a little ugly. I'd use white balsamic vinegar next time, or white wine vinegar to correct the color. Tastes good though!

Great! We used this to marinate chicken and then grilled and served over field green salad with the same dressing.

This is the most incredible dressing. I make it all the time and put it on all kinds of salads. It's really good if you add pine nuts to the salad too.

We've been eatting this on everything, cold chicken sandwiches, edame with greens salad. I've even used garlic instead of the shallots and it works. Keeps well too.

I made this for the second time for a dinner party and placed it in the middle of an anitpasto plate of mozzarella, olives, roasted peppers, sopressata and crostini and it was a HUGE hit - eveyone was putting it on everything. It really has a delicious taste......will make again and again.

This was delicious! My boyfriend absolutely loved it. We love fresh basil and have a lot of it. I put this on a mozzarella and tomato salad - I can't really imagine it on a green salad - but might try it, since it was so tasty! will make again this weekend!

Really wonderful and fresh, especially with basil straight from the garden! Combined with ripe juicy tomatoes, this is one of those wonderful summer flavors we crave during the long cold winters here in the north. We also used a cider vinegar to preserve the pristine green color. Didn't miss the balsamic at all. Try this and you won't be disappointed!

I liked this a lot, but didn't find it "creamy". The second time I made it, I increased the mayo by 2 Tbs. and decreased the oil by 2 Tbs. It was creamier, but the flavor was about the same. Mine was kind of olive green (with regular baslsamic) and smooth, not lumpy. Will make this any time I have some fresh basil around

This dressing is so tasty!! Try using white balsamic vinegar to keep it green. Everyone requests this dressing when I'm making salad.

Simple, delicious, great! Tastes of Parmesan even though there is none in it, very good flavor and texture. I think it would be a great dressing for a taco salad as well. I do think the recipe calls for a tiny bit to much salt though, so salt it to taste.

So yummy! Substituted apple cider vinegar for balsalmic to keep the green color and the recipe turned out awesome. Put it over regular salad greens with whatever accessories (fresh peas, tomatoes, etc) you have on hand. Everyone who had this at my lunch party raved. Huge hit.

not much to look at (mine turned brown) and strange texture (lumpy and separated) but it tasted fabulous and once it was on the salad greens itself and covered with other items that wasn't noticeable. I made it with a spring mix salad, julliened jicama and carrots, pine nuts, dried apricot halves, and chicken. it was fabulous and light and even had it the next day just over salad greens with flounder for a light supper.

Mmmm...what a great way to use up my basil. I loved the texture and taste of this dressing. I served it over crisp mesclun greens and sprinkled toasted pecans on top. I know my best friend Barbie will love it too!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I'm always looking for ways to reduce fat and calories without comprimising flavour and texture so I reduced the mayo to 1T (lite) and the oil to 4T (really good Extra Virgin). Served it spooned over tomatoes and fresh mozzerella. It couldn't be better!

Excellent dressing! I served on a salad of Romaine hearts along with the Tomato, Goat Cheese, and Onion Tart recipe from this site! - great summer dinner!
