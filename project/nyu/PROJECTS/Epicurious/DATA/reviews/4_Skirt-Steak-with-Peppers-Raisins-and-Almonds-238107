Easy and good! I left out the raisins knowing my daughter wouldn't like them, and I also cut the steak into strips and stir-fried. Next time I'd use a leaner cut of meat like flat iron, though. The skirt was fattier than we're used to.

No changes needed. I served this with yellow rice for a nice weeknight meal.

This was delicious. The only modification I made was that I used fresh onion, green, red, orange and yellow peppers instead of a bag of frozen stir fry peppers.

Very quick, tasty recipe. The combined flavors of the spices, the raisins, and the garlic were surprising and pleasing, and the almonds lent a satisfying texture. This one was a winner.
