Made polenta only as a side dish. Used 1 c light cream, 1 c 2% milk. Stirred polenta total of 10 minutes- it set up & started pulling away from the sides of the pan. Added 1 T chicken broth while stirring (it seemed like it was getting really dry). Did not have bay leaves- used 2 fresh basil leaves instead (couldnt taste the basil). Did not have Comte- used ¼ c shredded asiago; ¼ c extra sharp Cheddar shredded. Chilled in pan 1.5 hours, was no problem to cut up & pan fry. It was delicious, and so creamy smooth! My favorite polenta by far.

For everyone who had difficulty frying the polenta in this dish: If you make it again, just add a step. When my first 3 polenta squares fell apart in the saute pan, I decided to bake the rest to harden them up a bit before frying. If you allow the chilled squares to spend 15-20 minutes in a 300 degree oven, they'll firm up enough to fry beautifully. And before you ask, yes, I think it's worth the extra work. You really get the flavor of the bay leaf and the comte in the finished dish, and you can't get those with pre-made polenta!

This recipe is so unbelievably delicious. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. Garlic instead of shallots and I put the polenta in a baking pan and baked with olive oil brushed on top instead of frying. I just didn't have the confidence or energy to try and pull it off. I HIGHLY suggest really using fresh parsley instead of dried. It makes a big difference. Enjoy and bon appetit!

The mushroom ragout came out great but I had trouble with the polenta. I used the size pan recommended for chilling but the chilled polenta was too thin. Also, the mixture was too soft and fell apart when frying. Perhaps I didn't cook it long enough to begin with??? Luckily I had time to make another batch so instead made a typical recipe of 8 cups water to 2 cups polenta. This doubled amount filled up the baking sheet to a good 1/2" thickness. Cut in rounds, fried (this time, beautifully) and placed back on baking sheet. Did all this before company came. While I was finishing up the mushrooms, I reheated the polenta rounds in 250 oven. End result was fantastic--everyone raved. As with another reviewer, I used Gruyere as Comte is not available here. Also, I found it necessary to serve this on small plates with forks--not sturdy enough for finger food. Nevertheless, a beautiful first course.

The polenta was fantastic and I made it exactly as described - it IS a great use of Comte. I served the polenta with pan fried scallops and oven roasted tomatoes, but now I'm eager to try the mushroom ragout!

Excellent app! Two bay leaves gave the polenta a little more mouth & made everybody ask "what is that?"! I think deep fryer gave more conformed browning, a definite + +!

I thought these were genuinely excellent, BUT I did pay attention to previous reviewers and bought premade polenta, which i cut into half-moons and toasted in the oven first. This worked out perfectly. I cooked the mushrooms with some onions until nearly carmelized, and then added balsamic and later half & half instead of heavy cream. The half and half comes close to breaking down with the balsamic, but if you continue to add and stir, it usually resolves itself. I prefer this to the heavier taste of cream. I made this same mushroom/onion topping with gruyere for a pizza the other night and it was also delicious.

Tried this as an app for Christmas day and the polenta went straight into the garbage. The polenta was bland, too wet, and would not brown in the pan for the life of me. I think this was due to too much moisture in the polenta cake. Mushrooms were ok so they ended up in a bowl on the table. There are far superior mushroom recipes out there. I would recommend making your own version of this. The concept is great just a bad recipe. Do not bother using good Comte on this.

This is an amazing appetizer!! I have to say I don't agree with some of the past reviews of this ap. I've made this for many occasions and everyone always raves about it. Da-lish!!

I used pre made polenta. I didn't have some of the ingredients (e.g. parsley) and I think the recipe would have been tastier had I included them. I also had to substitute the Comte with Parmesan cheese. All said, it was a tasty dish, especially paired with a salad. The next time I'll make sure I have all of the ingredients. I may also try making the polenta from scratch.

I took to a dinner party and everyone loved this dish. I will make again, but will make some changes. Polenta squares were difficult to fry. I will try to do it in the oven next time: pre-cut, spread out on non- stick pan with butter/olive oil. Brush this mixture on top as well and put in a 450F oven for a few minutes to brown both sides. The ragout needs a little more kick. I will substitute garlic for shallots and add a shot or two of worchestershire sauce - maybe even a little Tabasco. I couldn't find the Comte cheese in my local market so used a high quality gruyere. It worked fine, but I'd like to try the Comte. The bay leaf adds a lovely flavor to the polenta, which was very easy to make. Personally, I've always been very disappointed with the pre-made rolls of polenta. This is easy to make ahead of time and well-worth the effort. The creme fraiche may have actually detracted from the rich mushroom flavor. Next time I'll try the whipping cream. Do try this - it's elegant and delicious - worth experimenting with to make it perfect!

Very yummy but not super quick. I wanted to make this a finger food, so I drained a lot of the liquid off of the mushrooms, spread them across the polenta, melted cheese on all of it, and cut it into squares. I also broiled the polenta, which took a long time; I'd like to gry grilling it in the future.

This was excellent. Made it for a cocktail party and it was enjoyed by all. Served in mini chinese food containers with chopsticks. Easy to do and can prep the day prior!

A real stunner. One of the best appetizers I've ever had. Halved the recipe with great success; made the squares a little smaller and that made them easier to eat.

There wasn't enough flavor to make it really interesting.

This recipe was perfect. I didn't remember to make it in advance, so I put the polenta in the freezer for about 30 minutes, worked perfectly. I also didn't only use wild mushrooms, too pricey. I used about 1/2 regular button mushroom and 1/2 wild. Turned out perfect. Next time we are making it as a main course!

We cooked this recipe 2 times. The flavor is great - but the polenta fell apart when it was fried. It delayed our Christmas dinner by 30 minutes... Not sure I would make this again

Made this for guests last night. Used purchased polenta and cut into rounds. Did everything else the same. Fabulous!!! My guests just raved. Definitely a keeper.

This was super yummy! I was in a time crunch, so I just pan-fried some premade polenta. I loved the mushroom taste - WOW! I wish they had been slightly more creamy - maybe I should use the creme fraiche rather than cream next time. Also, I had to use less than stellar mushrooms - dried shitake and baby portabella (small town, no other choices), but still, it was simply rich and divine. Also, I used gruyere rather than comte. The parsley is badly needed to cut the richness and add brightness, so don't skip that. Also, I might try adding some truffle oil and/or sauteed lobster to make this an over the top dish for a festive holiday!

Made these as a passed Hors d'Ouevres for cocktail hour preceding Thanksgiving dinner. Used a fluted round cutter to cut polenta. Definitly need to chop the mushrooms finer if this is not a served plated. Felt the polenta was "missing something;" perhaps I underseasoned it. I used more balsamic than was called for in the recipe and the outcome was still good. I would use the mushroom ragout recipe again, but not sure if paired with the polenta.
