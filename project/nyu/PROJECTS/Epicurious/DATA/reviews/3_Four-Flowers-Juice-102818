I used a whole pineapple and less water (maybe half a cup) and added ice to everyone's glass. I did not have grenadine so I used blackberry syrup instead. I forgot the garnish! Made enough for six people and with some left over. Everyone liked it.

I would say that if you substituted 1 cup of water for ice and grenadine for agave nectar.It is delicous.

This was a big hit with my guests. I used a whole pineapple and some extra orange juice because the banana flavor was a bit to heavy. I also added vodka and froze the mixture for a refreshing cocktail.
