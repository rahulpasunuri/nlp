This was a HUGE hit. As some other reviewers recommended - I made the cakes and the cocoa /espresso part the day prior and refrigerated all overnight. I also added a few drops of coffee extract. I added the cocoa/espresso mixture to the marscapone the following day, whipped and frosted right away. True - its not a dark brown - looks more like a Pepperidge Farm freezer cake color - but delish none the less. We ate the remainder for 3 days afterward and it was still moist

This cake is so rich and moist. It is one of *the* best recipes I have ever made for cake. I would highly recommend it. And it really was pretty easy to make, despite the lengthy instructions.

The cake was dense and tasty - I always chill chocolate cake in sealed bag overnight to set the moisture. The frosting was delicious...wonderful aftertaste, very creamy. It was, however, pale and not too tempting to look at. I topped it with mini chocolate chips and it got wonderful reviews from my group!

I've just taken the cake out of the pans and my husband and I have tasted the crumbs. They are beyond delicious. I love chocolate but have never been a huge chocolate cake fan. (I decided to make this for my mom's birthday because SHE loves chocolate cake.) This cake may be my new favorite. I can't wait to taste it with the frosting. I've already promised my husband that I'll make it again!

I am only reviewing the frosting. I have not tried the cake so I don't have an opinion either way but I don't know where they got the picture for this one. Don't expect to get that Blackout Cake look with this frosting, the finished look is more like a luxe camel coat. I made only a half recipe of the frosting, expecting to use it for a batch of cupcakes and it should be more than enough. I've got more than 4 cups of finished product to work with. I used Starbucks Via instant coffee, the Mocha variety naturally, and Ghiradelli cocoa powder. I prepared the mocha-cream mixture a day ahead which I think helped the flavor develop, so I didn't have the flavor complaints that some people mentioned. One problem I did have was that the mascarpone and the cream mixture kept trying to separate once it was all together, not a good texture to frost cupcakes or decorate a layer cake with. I added about 4 oz of butter on top of the 8 oz of mascarpone already present, whipping it well to incorporate it, which really helped to bring it all together and give the frosting a nice velvety and smooth texture, more like a traditional buttercream, but with the light mouse-y flavor that you would expect from all that cream and mascarpone cheese. can't wait to get it on some cupcakes!

Not TDF, but good. The cake was chocolat-y and decently moist, but not as much coffee flavor as I would have liked. Same goes for the frosting - good, light flavor, not as much coffee. Based on taste alone, it was OK, good. With the proper presentation (ring of ganache flowers with a ton of dark and white chocolate curls smothering the top), it has potential to be a jaw-dropper.

This is just a review of the frosting - I made my own devil's food to put it on. I was not impressed - I'm surprised by all the fabulous reviews for it. I found that the mascarpone really blanded it up - tasted great before I whipped that into it. And it is a horrible color - looked like it came from the bathroom, not the kitchen, to put it bluntly. It was also a little runny - whipped it for 3 min, ice cold, but I was afraid to go longer due the separation warning in the recipe. Other than the extra minute of beating, I followed the recipe exactly, doubled. And, it made a TON of frosting - I doubled it to frost a 9x13 layer cake, and I could have frosted 2 or 3 of them. One recipe would have been plenty for that size cake. Oh well - will not be making it again.

I loved this cake. anything w/ the combo of coffee and chocolate just gets me. It was fairly easy to make. Made it for a party, everyone was impressed.

I agree with other reviewers that the frosting is delicious on this recipe. However, the cake (as others have said) is rather dry and somewhat dense. The coffee flavor is very subtle. If I were making this again (which I don't think I would), I would include an extra TBS of espresso powder. Also, I did not use all the frosting (as it seemed like a lot) but the cake really needed it. More frosting between the layers would have helped the flavor since the icing carried the recipe. Finally, the cakes were done at 35 minutes, so it would be important to check them at 30 minutes.

Fantastic. I also used 3 pans, with the same amount of batter and frosting, and made a very impressive (and tall!) layer cake. Everyone loved it.

Talk about a delicious cake-- and fairly easy to throw together, too. Most ingredients I already had on hand. Had to substitute instant coffee for the instant espresso, couldn't dig up instant espresso at conventional grocer. Just added a little more instant coffee to try and match the strength I would've gotten with instant espresso. The cake is moist, the bitter savor of the coffee keeps the cake from becoming too sweet. The frosting is bomb. The mascarpone makes it rich but melts away quickly for a clean, coffee-chocolate aftertaste :). Will make again.

We've made this a few times now, and it's amazing. Just one bit of info to pass on: I used three 9-inch pans with 1.5-inch sides and baked for about 30 minutes. The frosting recipe made more than enough to frost the three layers and sides of the cake.

I made this cake for my cousin's birthday and it was a HUGE hit! The frosting was delicious (and the lighter color didn't bother me at all). I used Starbucks Via instant coffee in both the cake and the frosting and I think it tasted great. The cake was really moist and not too rich. Definitely the best cake I've ever made and plan to continue making it for a long time to come!

So first thing to know is your cake will not look like the cake in this photo. I don't know WHAT cake they photographed for this, but it wasn't this recipe! That being said, your cake will look fine. It will be a lighter brown, though the frosting will get darker as you work through it and refrigerate. I thought the cake part was good; next time I would probably substitute one of my favorite devils food recipes cause I like really moist cake. This recipe wasn't dry, but more normal. I'm a gooey type. The frosting is REALLY good. I probably won't make this again because I have other recipes that wow people a bit more. Or, at least, the wow me more. Everyone I served this to loved it.

Yum. This is a fabulous cake, and one of my all time favourites. Moist, tasty and the frosting light with the mascarpone cheese. The addition of espresso adds a wonderful flavour you wouldn't expect for a chocolate cake. The colour of the frosting, as the name implies is mocha in colour and a very nice compliment to the dark cake.

Rating: 4
This came out just perfect! The cake is moist, dense and not overly sweet, just perfect!! The frosting is soft,fluffy, and so delicious. I may add some powdered sugar to the icing recipe next time so that I can do a bit more decorating on the cake. Will make this again and again. I think it is the best chocolate cake I have ever made.

Frosting was much lighter than picture but still equally delicious. I have made the cake twice and have substituted the mascarpone for cream cheese instead. Both times the cake was amazing.

Frosting definitely stood out more than the cake. I didn't have the problem earlier reviewers mentioned about the color. It's a pleasant lighter chocolatey color - I used Ghirardelli cococa powder. Cake was more dense after being in the fridge overnight but still moist. Delicious overall, I got many compliments on it when I brought it into work.

Even though I made a blunder with how much water one dissolves the espresso in, the cake still turned out quite tasty. The color isn't anything like the photograph, a lighter brown for the cake itself, and a warm chocolate for the frosting. The cake has a delicate coffee flavour reminiscent of a good terimisu, and is honestly quite good. Well received by my roommates and co.!

haven't tasted yet but deeply disappointed in that it is light milk chocolate and looks nothing like the picture. The frosting came out very thick and stiff and hard to spread without getting crumbs in it. Not shiny and dark. I am an experienced baker and probably should have known from the ingredients but don't use coco that often. Deeply disappointed. Did taste the frosting and too light and not chocolatey enough.

I read the frosting recipe and the reviews and was AMAZED...but then I tried it. It was a yucky grayish brown color. The taste was outstanding, although the texture kind of scared me. It was perfect as it was, but thin and airy. I wonder how it would be once spread on a cake. Normal butter-based frostings harden but I'm afraid this one would slip and slop. Anyway, I made it and tweaked it by adding more cocoa and cream to try to change the color. It turned out more brown than grey, but still unappetizing. I then refrigerated it, but the consistency was ruined. It was grainy and wet. Perhaps because of the extra cream. I tried a scoop, loved it and tossed the whole thing because of the color (it was for a birthday party and I'm a perfectionist). I then proceeded to whip up a simple butter-powdered sugar chocolate frosting to which I added a tablespoon or so of instant espresso flakes mixed with milk. It was DIVINE and spread and set up beautifully. I used a vegetable peeler to grate curls of dark, white and milk chocolate bars on top. It looks amazing. I would love to try this recipe again, but I'm too scared. Perhaps next time I'll have some black or brown food coloring on hand. I didn't use this cake recipe, by the way, I used HERSHEY'S special dark chocolate cake, which is my favorite recipe in the world. Moist and delicious. Find it on the back of HERSHEY'S special dark cocoa...try it!! The frosting recipe is also there. These recipes DO make a super super dark almost black cake like the picture for this mocha recipe.

I made just the cake part of this recipe and found it extremely easy and tasty. It'll be my basic chocolate cake recipe for awhile I think. My only change was to add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I loved how moist and light it was, and that it was not too sweet. I've made "better" chocolate cakes but they can get so fancy and rich. This was wonderful in its simplicity.

Rating: 3
The frosting for this cake is fantastic and tastes like coffee ice cream (which I am a big fan of) -- the frosting recipe is definitely a keeper. On the other hand, the cake is nothing exceptional. It comes out with a very nice texture -- light and moist -- but the taste is not much different from cake made from a box. I would search out a different chocolate cake recipe to put this delicious frosting on.

I can be extremely picky when it comes to cooking. If a recipe falls below perfect I will definitely notice. This is why I am so happy that this recipe was absolutely great as is!(although I did have to substitute the all natural cocoa powder with half natural and half dutch process powder because I was out of regular) The cake was soft and moist with great mocha flavor. It was lighter than shown in the picture, but still looked great. I added white choc curls along with dark and made this in a square shaped pan, which I think looked better than the rounds.

If there was a 3 1/2, that's what I would give this otherwise superb recipe -- deducting a half fork for one reason, and that is the color of the frosting. It's not that it doesn't match the photo, which it does not, as many other reviewers have pointed out, but rather that it came out a strangely icky color for me. Kind of a light gray-brown. Otherwise, the cake was terrific -- dark, moist, and perfectly yummy. The frosting tasted great and had a wonderful fluffy texture. It was easy to make and made plenty. Everyone was wowed, once they got over the strange color. I wonder how we could fix that problem?

My daughter works at Nieman Marcus and when notified of an employee contest for best dessert, she called me for suggestions. I had just received my latest issue of BA with this recipe, but I've never been too fond of all chocolate, all the time, so a revision was going to be necessary. At my advice, she substituted the cocoa in the frosting with white chocolate (lessened the sugar a bit too) but otherwise made it just as written. The end result made for a prettier cake. I agree with other reviewers that the picture doesn't reflect the warm brown color that our results delivered, but think that having a lighter cafe au lait colored icing was an added bonus with some chocolate curls grated on the top. It was a beautiful finished dessert and no one thought she made it, guessing maybe Whole Foods as her resource. She convinced them otherwise, it was raved upon AND yes, she won something like $250 worth of gifts! I've since made it twice myself as mini cupcakes for a crowd and I don't recall ever having such a demand for a recipe. Would rate this as one of the best cakes ever!

First of all - Thank you to "A cook from Calgary" for the advice on the proper cocoa powder to use, I used Hershey's. The cake was great, very moist (which I demand in my chocolate cakes, hence why I rarely make them). The frosting was also delicious, although it could have been a bit more mocha-y, I didn't taste the coffee flavor as much as the chocolate flavor; also I was expecting it to have more of a tang, due to the mascarpone - but it was great - less sweet (which is a good thing) than the mocha frosting I usually make. I made the cake for Mother's Day, and everyone raved, even the non-chocolate lovers liked it. A definite keeper.

Rating: 4
Fabulous!!!! I used 1/2 regular cocoa and 1/2 Hershey's special dark cocoa. It was to die for! The frosting especially. If refridgerating, I would leave it out for longer than 20 minutes before serving. The cake was really dense, almost like flourless chocolate cake. I think it would have been a little lighter if it was allowed to warm up closer to room temp. In any case, I will be making this again very soon. Everyone asked for the recipe. I didn't have parchment paper and it came out perfectly.

I agree with the other reviewers about the color of the frosting. The cake color was true to the picture. I wonder if they used an archived picture of chocolate cake! My biggest issue was that the batter was too generous and bubbled over the pans as it baked. Still turned out well (able to trim off the drips) I froze the cake layers a week before (wrapped in plastic )and frosted them frozen the night before serving- was perfectly moist and defrosted the next day- I topped with fresh berries-all raved about it!

I am not a very good baker (measurement is my folly) but I really worked at making this cake exactly like the recipe. It was excellent! Probably the best cake I've ever made. I am so glad I did follow the recipe. My only complaint is the cost of the mascarpone cheese. I am going to work on adapting the frosting with some cheaper alternatives like whipping cream and cream cheese.

To answer the previous reviewer: I haven't made this cake either, but when a recipe specifies "natural" cocoa, they are generally referring to a cocoa that is not dutch-processed. It will make some difference because the dutch process changes how alkaline the cocoa is, so the 2 types of cocoa will react differently with the buttermilk and baking soda. They also tend to produce cakes with different colours, so to get the dark brown of the photo you probably want to stick with natural (often an inexpensive supermarket brand is natural). You can always try it with what you have on hand and chances are friends will still help you eat it!

Sorry, I hate to "review" a recipe before actually making it, but I have a question: Did people use Dutch processed cocoa powder or regular? Do you think it makes a difference? Thanks!

This cake is absolutely fantastic - one of the best recipes I've ever found, and baking is my passion. I love the rare occasion when I can find a new cake that is so outstanding it becomes an instant favorite, and this one hit the mark. I had some trouble finding instant espresso, but used Starbuck's Via, Italian roast (instant coffee) for the frosting and simply brewed 3/4 c. of espresso for the cake. For those who have trouble finding/paying for mascarpone, Trader Joe's has it or $2.99 an 8 ounce tub, at least in the Chicago area. I did make the chocolate curls as a garnish and the presentation was glorious, outdone only by the flavor! Moist, rich, and fairly dense, the layers stand on their own. Personally, I liked the contrast of the light brown frosting with the bittersweet chocolate curls, so the color mattered none to me, but I did appreciate other reviewers' comments so I knew what to expect. Make this cake!! You won't be sorry.

Unbelievable. Once you've had this chocolate cake you will forget all others. Mascarpone will run you about 8-10 dollars in this recipe, but it is well worth it. Cream cheese doesn't compare. A couple words in response to other reviewers who posted. 1. I think the reason the cake appeared so dark in the photo was due to lighting by the food stylist. Your frosting will not appear black as in the photo. But you won't be thinking about the color of this cake after you taste it. 2. If you want your ganache to have a high gloss sheen, don't put it on a cool cake and/or hit it with a hair dryer for a second before you serve it. Again my frosting also was not shiny as in the photo but it also isn't a ganache. 3. Instant espresso powder is different than regular espresso powder as it dissolves instantly in water. I've tried both in recipes and it doesn't make a huge difference.

This was an AMAZING cake. I even used special dark cocoa, and the frosting was still too light, but it still tasted great. I used instant coffee powder instead of espresso powder, so the coffee taste was muted a lot, but it was still so delicious. My aunt said it was the best she'd ever had. I substituted 16 oz. cream cheese plus 1/3 c. plain yogurt and 1/4 c. cream (blended until smooth) for the mascarpone and it was great.

Tastes great! My three-year-old said it was the best cake he's had. As others said, the frosting is mocha colored and not dark. Has anyone tried using the dark cocoa powder yet? Not sure it will make the frosting darker, as it is the mascarpone cheese that lightens the color. If the mascarpone was dark or black food coloring added then maybe.

Made this for a group and it was a big hit. Of course, they hadn't seen the picture so they didn't know the icing might have/should have been much darker. It tasted great, but what is it with the stylist? This is not the first time Gourmet shows a picture that bears little resemblance to the real thing. That said, the coffee taste is great and I will make it again.

This cake was super yummy, although it took two takes to come together - I live above 8,000 feet so baking is often trial and error. What worked in the end was adding an extra egg to the cake batter. The cake was moist and rich, and the frosting even better. Many sniveled about the lack of darkness in the color, but taste triumphed in the end.

Fantastic flavor. Not overly sweet. Loved the frosting. Served at a dinner party and it was a hit even among those who are not big sweet-eaters. I agree with another reviewer, however, that the frosting does not turn out like the photo. The frosting in the photo is much darker and shinier, more like a ganache than the cake really is.

Based the other reviews I skipped the whole frosting with mascarpone and made a white mountain frosting. I added that to the layer in-between, placed dollops on the top to create a "pillow" and added chocolate curls to the top. My husband said it was the best chocolate cake I have ever made.

Great, moist cake with a wonderfully subtle coffee flavor. I found the frosting especially delicious (cream cheese frostings are my favorite for their ease and transportability -though this cake does need to remain chilled). I suggest making the frosting first as it requires 2 hours chill time before assembling.

After decades of trying Bon Appetit recipes, this cake was the MOST disappointing. The food stylist took extreme liberties when doing the photo. I chose the recipe because the frosting was so dark. My experience should have told me it wasn't a ganache and would be "mocha" in appearance. One of the layers broke in pieces during assembly but I chalked that up to carelessness. I haven't tasted it yet. I've pieced it together & it's chilling now to take to a potluck luncheon.

I made this cake for a 40th birthday party and it was a smash hit - everyone loved it including the kids. For me too, the frosting was light in color and I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa. But the frosting color is not as issue - the taste was incredible. Like another reviewer, I also baked the cake for 35 minutes instead of 40 and the cake was extremely moist. The party goers suggested that this was best cake they'd ever tasted, I'm not so sure about that, but it was very, very good. I'd make it again in a heartbeat.

Delicious. Served it at a dinner party with my parents and inlaws w/rave reviews. My husband even liked it, and he is not a dessert person. I've been asked to make it for Easter Dinner. I agree w/the review of using the special dark chocolate I did bake it for 35 minutes rather than 40.

The layers were really moist but slightly crumbly. The cake as a whole was wonderful. The cake really mellowed the extreme coffee flavor in the frosting. They paired really well. As the others noted the frosting wasn't the dark black color but next time I'll try the dark chocolate cocoa powder that was recommended by another. Worth making!

I made this for my boss's birthday and everyone loved it. I reduced the sugar in both the cake and the frosting and no one missed it. I loved the frosting but was also disappointed in the color.

It would seem that an ingredient was omitted from the frosting. My frosting didn't even come close to having the almost black chocolate of the picture, but instead was a light milk chocolate color.
