Terrific with lamb. Cheap, pretty and delicious. Thought about adding heavy cream but that is gilding the lily.

I also added lemon juice and minced zest. I have to admit that while my initial tastes weren't particularly exciting, this is definitely the sort of dish you can completely tuck into...it's dead easy and yummy. I'll definitely make this again. Hopefully, it will be a good side dish for the prime rib & yorkshire puddings my friends are serving for NYE dinner.

Fabulous and easy...great way to get a big serving of vegetables in the middle of winter. I did not have fresh mint, so just used parsley-made about half a serving (16 oz of peas, 2 TBS of butter). Very naturally sweet and just delicious. Could actually use less butter..and I rarely say that.

Although tasty, this is NOTHING like mushy peas. Mushy peas are dried green peas rehydrated with baking soda added. The peas are also not food processed. Calling this a variation of mushy peas like saying tater tot cassarole is also a variation just because it has peas in it.

I torn this recipe out of Gourmet Magazine 4 years ago and finally got around trying it last night for a dinner party. We all loved it! The only change I made was I had 2 packages of peas totalling 32 oz. and it was enough to serve 10 persons. Next time, I will add a little fresh lemon juice mentioned by one of the reviewers. I will be making this again and again and also share the recipe with family and friends.

Great and very easy as an accompaniment to lamb. Made it for this past Easter dinner.

This is truly excellent. Made it for our Easter dinner. At first I was leery of mint and peas but the mint is very subtle and quite delightful. The taste screamed Springtime! Even the kids went back for seconds! This quantity really would serve 10-12 but I would want to cut the recipe in half because the taste might not be the same.

Really good! I'm making for Easter dinner. I added a squeeze of lemon juice which brightened it up even more.

Any recipe with mush in the title has an up hill battle, but my friends and I love the British classic mushy peas and when we saw this variation with mint (yum) we knew we had to give it a chance. We weren't disappointed. Although peas aren't everyone's favorite, this will make anyone a convert. I honestly think they might be better than mashed potatoes. Plus they brighten up the plate. We make them every year on St. Patrick's day.

I made this for easter and it was a huge success for an easy fun side dish to go with rack of lamb- so fresh and elegant- for easier preparation I used my boat motor to smash the peas at the end- All guest wanted the recipe! I am making it again for mothers day!
