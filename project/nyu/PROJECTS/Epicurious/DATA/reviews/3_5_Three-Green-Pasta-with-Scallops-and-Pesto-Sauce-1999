I would give my revision 4 forks. As for veggies, I skipped the green beans also preferred slicing asparagus and roasting with a tiny bit of olive oil and made my own pesto. Also bought the fresh pasta combined all in large sauté pan with rest of ingredients. Did the scallops last and seared them in a separate pan and served them on top of the pasta. Why would waste expensive scallops. Unless they were frozen ones. Agree with a previous reviewer if you are going to mix it all in then use chicken. Took more time dirtied more pots but result was awesome and picky veggie eaters ate the green things!

Everyone loved it in our family including two kids under 10. The Anne Boechklin Alsace 2008 Reserve Pinot Gris with this meal is a match made in heaven.

So good and great guest reviews.. BUT I used shrimp instead of scallops and edamame instead of peas... Yum!

Y in the world would anyone use such a sweet subtle flavoured product as a Scallop, not too mention costly, and kill it with an overpowering pesto sauce...regardless of how much u cut its intensity down. Next time use inexpensive chicken....cheap with no flavour loss!

Anyone try this using soy butter for the veggies and leaving out the cream? does it work? too boring? thanks

on a 5 star rating system this would have been 3, it was good, did not blow our minds. wasn't hard and was tasty. the lemon was a nice touch, we put a bit extra.

Fresh and satisfying: the acidity of the lemon, the sweetness of the scallops and the peas, the saltiness of the pesto and the creaminess of the whipping cream and the butter, all make a wonderful combination of flavors. And easy and quick to make!

Really great combination of veg and pesto/pasta. I made this with homemade pesto from my freezer and played with the measurements by ear, as I freeze it with less olive oil for space purposes. However, the combination of cream and pesto always goes together, as in a pesto lasagne using a ricotta blend. The only detraction was the scallops. Not willing to spend a fortune for the really good ones, I find most sea scallops to have little flavor. What resulted probably tasted no better than tofu IMO. In the future, I'm going to leave them out. The pasta with asparagus, haricot vert and peas was wonderful all by itself and didn't need a protein.

this was sooooo delicious! i didn't have asparagus and i didn't use store bought pesto. i made the basil arugula pesto based on the recipe on this site. the pesto was great too! i recommend making your own pesto to go with this recipe.

This recipe was great! I left out the asparagus because my kids don't like it and served it with chicken for my kids and scallops for the rest of us. I left out the lemon based on previous reviews. This is a keeper. I might try it with half and half next time and also try it with shrimp. I also don't think it needs as much butter as it calls for.

This recipe was great for the early summer. I took the other poster's advice and made my own pesto and everything turned out terrific. I was skeptical of 1 lb of pasta serving 8, but it was a huge dish! Everything tasted so fresh and the cream didn't overpower the pesto or the fresh vegetables and scallops. I would make this again in a flash. It was great for a crowd and easy. Shrimp would also be great in there.

AMAZING! And soooo easy. I didn't really use the measurements because I was making it for one, so I just followed the directions in order and guessed, and it turned out really well. I didn't add the lemon because another reviewer said it tasted sour, but next time I might add some lemon rind.

I have made this several times for guests and it is a hit every time. I make my own pesto which makes a difference and pesto is so easy to make.

I hate to disagree with this group but It just wasn't what I expected. The 1 and 1/2 cup pesto; I was unsure and rightfully so. This recipe is very, very sour. My husband and myself both tend to like slightly sweet or spicey dishes. The 2T. lemon juice along with the pesto should have been my clue; but, I was swayed by the 100% approval. Sorry to be the downer but I didn't like it at all and would not make it again. My hubby ended up eating eggs he cooked himself and wanted me to promise to keep it to one new recipe a week. Yeah sure! (ha ha ha)

Very good. I made it without the scallops. Still tasty. I think it would also be good with shrimp.

Whoa, this pasta is pretty groovy. I'm not a big bay scallop fan, so I chose to omit the scallops and served the "sea scallops with cilantro gremolata and ginger beurre blanc" on the side. DUDE, this is a wicked combo. I just had leftovers today for lunch and they're great. I doubt the scallops would have survived well. Go for it!

A very easy and delicious recipe. I added a handful of basil chiffonade at the end for a burst of fresh basil flavor. I highly recommend using homemade pesto. I had some frozen, leftover from the summer, and it worked great. I only used 1lb. of scallops, and found that the amount was fine.

This is one of our favourite recipes. For a weekday supper, I use chicken breasts cut in strips. It's very quick - start the pasta in a large pot, 4 mins to end, add chicken and green beans, 2 mins to end, add asparagus (broccoli is good too). Drain everything and mix with the pesto (made in Sept and stored in the freeezer) cream sauce. I can't believe I've been making this since 1993!

Today I will make this my third time....and it always gets raves! I don't think it is bland at all, but then it could depend on your pesto!

Not bad, but a little bland. Something for when Aunt Edna vists perhaps? Easy to make!
