Delicious. These ingredients really complement each other well.

This is a great recipe. The blini recipe is a perfect all-around recipe. We used half the blinis with a good osetra caviar, sour cream and chives. The other half we had with the egg salad recipe as printed and we loved it! It is very easy to make and seems impossible to screw up. :)

I love the masculine presentation of this dish.Each layer of flavor supported the next very well. It's very clean & hearty without being heavy.

EXCELLENT!! We loved this SO much! I followed recipe exactly-wouldn't make any changes as it's heavenly as is. I'll absolutely be making this again. Quite easy, just a little time involved. But well worth it!

I've made this about 5 times. Everybody loves them and is impressed with my skill and daring. :) Have a little trouble with the cavier, do the best I can without running to 10 different stores. Oh...I do get the eggs ready and then add the sour cream and chives at the last minute. Got quite soggy once, don't want it to happen again. This is a splashy easy A+!!!

I made the blini and served them with creme fraiche and caviar. The blini were excellent and I think I might make pancakes from them once I've recovered from the holidays.

Composition of tastes is very good. How you could get wrong, when you put together caviar, salmon, sour-cream and boiled eggs? The only problem with the recipe is that presentation is messy and difficult to eat. Serve it like classical Russian blini with sour cream, topped with caviar. On the second blini pace egg salad, topped with salmon. Now so fashionable towering this time does not work.

Served this on New Year's Eve as one of several passed appetizers. The egg salad was really terrific - sour cream! - that's a new one for me. Very light and flavorful. No leftovers!

I just used the blini recipe and it was excellent! I topped them with sour cream and home cured salmon eggs. Divine!

Not only is this a pretty dish that presents itself well, but the textures and flavors are fabulous. I made this as a Mother's Day brunch, served with roasted asparagus and homemade breakfast breads, and my mother felt so loved and indulged.

I made this for brunch last week. It's sensational! What could be bad with lox for brunch? I definitely would make it again, only this time no blini just bagels slathered with cream cheese, lox, eegg salad and caviar; yum.
