A MA ZING!!!

I heeded other reviewers' suggestions and reduced the amount of buttermilk to 1c, and still found the dough to be wet and sticky. Perhaps because of that, it spread a lot while baking, and didn't quite form the pretty round loaf as shown in the photo. Nonetheless, the flavour was good. I'd suggest cutting the amount of salt in half if using salted butter, and keeping an eye on the bread for the last 5-10 minutes of baking so that it doesn't become to brown.

I should mention that I've used various amounts of candied orange peel. More is not a bad thing. One time I was low on buttermilk and substituted some sour cream. Awesome as ever. You can't go wrong with this.

YUM! Do not wait for the holidays to make this amazing bread. I've made it several times and have NEVER been disappointed. No one else mentioned it, but my dough is so wet that I find I use up to 1 cup more flour just to get it to hold together, and it's always moist. The bittersweet chocolate is the perfect sweetness. I don't know what fancy store-bought candied citrus peel costs, but it is SO easy and cheap to make the Simple Candied Orange Peel recipe found on this site. Seriously...turn your would-be compost/trash into a seriously good treat. And make this bread. Someone will love you for it.

Made this for the doormen in my building and they all said it never made it home! Didn't have any candied orange peel so I substituted fresh cranberries. Tasted delicious! Will definitely make again.

Great tea or brunch bread, even with all the tweeking I had to do. I didn't have any candied orange zest and didn't have the time to fiddle around making some so I used the zest of one orange and about 3oz. of candied ginger (that's all I had) and an extra bit of Nestle's chocolate chunks to compensate. I also added a healthy dash of cinnamon (1/2 t.?). The dough was very sticky so I added quite a bit more flour while kneading just so I coud handle it, but the finished product was great! Not as dry as other soda breads- this stayed quite moist. Of course how long it retains it's moisture I couldn't tell you as this was devoured upon it's exiting the oven.

I substituted candied ginger and dried apricots for the candied orange peel-- very delicious, especially with the dried-cranberry spread found on this site.

So easy and really delicious. Dries out quickly so eat it fast! I also added a dash of cinnamon which was a great addition. Nutella is also good spread on it.

delicious. I used candied ginger instead of orange peel. It added a nice spice, but was still sweet due to the chocolate.

I absolutely adored this bread, as did everyone I have served it to. A definite winner!

This bread is delicious! I couldn't find orange peel anywhere, so I made it myself from a recipe on this site. (Search for candied orange peel). Makes a great breakfast bread or not-too-sweet dessert. I'll definitely make it again!

I have received excellent reviews for this bread as the chocolate and orange flavors blend marvelously together. Further, given there is no yeast, the time constraints are minimal. I would make the following suggestions: 1.) I prefer using a variety of candied peels rather than solely orange 2.) First soaking the peel in a good-quality rum imparts a wonderful flavor 3.) I would encourage using a high-quality chocolate. Enjoy
