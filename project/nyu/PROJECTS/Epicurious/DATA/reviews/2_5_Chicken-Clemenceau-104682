Easy and delicious. Wouldn't change a thing. It did take a little longer for my potatoes do be tender, though.

This recipe didn't do a thing for me. The sum of the parts amounted to...the sum of the parts. Thought it might be better the second day; it wasn't. I added parmesan cheese, and it was more palatable. Heavy cream might be a good addition, too.

As a chef, I'd put this on any menu and serve it with pride! It was very good as is and I wouldn't change it. An excellent recipe for home and restaurant!
