Wow, made this for an end of summer dinner. Made all the dough (froze half) and then made one 10" tart with fabulous plums from the local farmers' market - bought today. Served it with salted caramel ice cream. Followed the recipe exactly and it was beautiful to behold and the best plum tart I've ever had. I did put foil under - thanks cook from Walnut Creek. Will make again, as long as the plums are available.

Delicious crust - don't omit the lemon zest! Next time I will place foil under the pans as the syrup spilled out and caused a smoking burned sugar nightmare on the oven floor. The plums were still a bit firm, not quite soft enough to cut with a fork - maybe blanch them a bit before assembling the tarts? Big hit at a dinner for 19 nonetheless!

I have made this recipe every fall for the last 5 years and it is always a huge hit. I am able to make one 11 inch tart and one smaller rectangular tart. Both look fabulous. This year I ended up freezing the smaller one and rewarming it before serving and it was still exceptional.

I just made these tarts for the first time. The plum tree in my yard went nuts this year! They tarts tasted very good, but were very tart. I suspect this has mostly to do with the plums from my tree, which are fairly tart. So next time I would add a bit more sugar and perhaps cut back on the lemon juice a little. I'd also up the cornstarch a bit, because the juices didn't solidify as much as I thought they would. Even after a night in the fridge they were still a tiny bit runny. (I baked them for 50 minutes after turning down the temp.) Like some of the other reviewers, I had to add a little cold water to the pastry dough in my food processor to get it to the right consistency. I ended up adding 2 teaspoonfuls. The tart dough is really amazing-- I see what everyone was raving about. Yum!

Delicious! I successfully halved the recipe--I did feel like I could have used more plums, but in the end all the juices filled in the empty spots. I second-guessed myself with the lemon juice--I added more than 1/2 tablespoon because I was worried it would be too sweet, but I think I overdid it a bit--I would stick to the recipe exactly in the future. The crust is delicious and so easy with a food processor--no need for a large counter to roll out the dough.

I just made this last night for a fall-themed party and it was a major hit! The crust was buttery and flaky and the plums were so moist and tender. I halved the ingredients to make just one tart but accidentally bought 2 lbs of plums anyway, which I'm glad I did because I had to use all but one of them. I'm guessing if you're really going to make two tarts, you'll need a lot more plums than indicated. Don't worry about the runny juices. I was pressed for time and stuck the tart in the freezer for 15 minutes and the juices congealed nicely. Received many compliments with this one!

I made this dessert for a holiday dinner and everyone loved it! I used the italian prune plums and the tarts were delicious. The tarts were a little runny when I first took them out of the oven, but I spooned the juice over the baked plums as indicated in the recipe and the juice thickened as the tarts cooled.

excellent, loved the crust. added a little extra lemon juice for tartness. will make again for sure!

In a word, luscious. This tart was my introduction to the world of plums, as my other half brought me the first harvest from his plum trees. I had to find a use for them all, and this tart was their perfect match. I cannot say enough good things about the crust, and must confess, I also use it by itself as shortbread cookie dough. It also makes a lovely housing for leftover homemade jam... As for this tart itself, I recall having read some of the reviews mentioning runniness; I counteracted what runniness there may have been with King Arthur Flour's Pie Filling Enhancer. When you eat this tart, all else in the world (temporarily) disappears... Oh yes -- and it's mighty pretty, too.

I liked this recipe. The crust was easy to make (no rolling) and the recipe was simple and straight-forward. I made both tarts for two occasions. Unfortunately, the tarts didn't get the raves I was hoping for. Everyone liked them, but no one was all that thrilled. I thought they were good, though, and I'll make again. I had a problem with the sauce thickening--I couldn't get it to really bubble in the oven, despite an extra 10 minutes of cooking, so both tarts were pretty runny. BTW, I only have one tart pan, so I made the second tart in a pie plate, and it turned out fine (although it stuck a bit).

My first attempt that this recipe I didn't have enough plums, so I made a smaller single tart with a "Pat in the pan" crust from the Joy of Cooking (adding a little lemon zest and juice to the dough), and altered the other measurements to suit the amount of plums I had. IT WAS AMAZING!!! I bought another full case of plums from Costco only a week later to try the recipe as written here. I can't wait to bite into a slice of plum tart again...and neither can my husband. He claims this is THE BEST tart/pie EVER - outranking his previous favorite Cherry Pie - as the sweet/sour joy of these plums is pure heaven! (We served it with a scoop of Slow Churned Tart Yogurt Honey ice cream and it was a perfect compliment!) Thanks Epicurious and fellow reviewers. I give this one 5 forks!!!

I was looking for something to do with a bunch of Italian plums I picked at a local orchard. This is perfect! It was easy, beautiful, and delicious. If you like this, you'll probably like the Plum-Almond Tart on this site from Bon Appetit Oct 1998. It's similar to this recipe but has a filling made from egg yolks, almonds, sugar, butter, and framboise - and the plums are not tossed in anything. Hooray for plum season!

Rating: 4
I would give this 5 forks if I could. The crust is possibly the best sablé crust I have ever made, and it does not require pre-baking. I will be adding a recurring reminder to my agenda to make this tart come every September month when prune plums are in season. In fact I think its a good idea to make a few extras and freeze them for when winter blues will kick in.

A terrific venue for prune plums. The crust (I made it with a pastry blender, no motors) was one of the best tart crusts I've made: buttery, rich, flavorful, and easy to work with. Although I found the tart does produce a lot of juices (some of which spilled over), they do condense on cooling maybe 3-4 hours. Don't serve straight out of the oven. And definitely use *all* prune plums if you can find them, the flavor is delicious and the color is beautiful.

Very easy with outstanding presentation. I made it in my Kitchen Aid mix master, without incident. I only had 5 plums, so did wedges around outer edge of tart and filled the rest in with blueberries that were kicking around in my fridge. Crust was light and crumbly; next time might add more lemon zest. Fruit was lively and juicy, but didn't get soggy in the crust. I'll make this for company in the near future!

I've made this recipe three times and it is now one of my favorites. The crust is buttery and a bit sweet and the lemon peel is a great complement. The instructions are very good. The tart turned out deliciously! Nice, easy, beautiful dessert.

it was so delicious! I ran out of plums, so i put spme peach slices also. some friends found it quite tart in taste, because of the fruit which i overbaked. I also had to add a few tablespoons of cold water to make the dough.

I've made this for 7 years off and on, whenever I could find my old Gourmet from 2000. So glad to see this favorite on epicuious. I am an abysmal baker, yet with this recipe, I come off as an elegant sophisticated baker.

I make this several times every summer -- it's my go-to summer dessert recipe. I hardly ever use plums, though, since I can hardly ever find the right ones. It works great with blueberries, blackberries, and nectarines. I use a KitchenAid mixer instead of a food processor, and I have to add about 1/4 cup of icewater to make the dough clump.

I baked this for a French friend nostalgic for home. She called it carrément the best fruit tart she'd had on either continent, and requested it for another French dinner tonight.

I made this for a lunch in the fall (along with a Cobb salad, another good recipe from this site) and my friends raved about it. I had never made a pastry crust in a food processor before and it turned out beautifully. The tart (which I served with freshly whipped cream)was the perfect balance of tart and sweet. I will definitely make this recipe again when the little prune plums are back in season next fall. (It had great "oooo / ahhhh" factor, i.e. lots of ooh-ah's, commensurate with the effort involved)

I made this for a dinner party and it was beautiful. Instead of two 9-inch tarts, I did a 14-inch tart and froze a 9-inch one (there was plenty of dough). I used less cornstarch and sprinkled the top with cinnamon, nutmeg and a little lemon juice. The tart looks lovely, although I wish I had buttered the pan; I had some trouble getting pieces out. Overall, though, it was easy and the taste of the plums is fabulous.

This recipe was easy to follow, and was a big hit. The only thing I changed was adding a few tablespoons of icewater to the pastry dough mix because it wasn't clumping together very well on its own. I'll definitely make this again!

A friend in Vail made this for me when the recipe first came out and I was crazy about it. Every year since, I look out for the right plums to come in so I can make it again.

"Nice try!" was the comment I heard after serving this to 5 people. I don't think there was anything wrong with the recipe. The problem was with the plums. The local rural supermarket had plums for the first time in months. They were not the small ones referred to in the recipe, rather they were much larger and tasted like saw dust after they were cooked.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to use the crust (very easy and very good, recommend it for people afraid of pie pastry) and the basic recipe with other fruits. Local Blenheim apricots are in season, so I substituted those for the plums in one tart with no other changes. For the second I used local blackberries and added a little more cornstarch. Both disappeared!

Plum tart was great. The food processor crust saved time over a traditional pie crust and had a lovely crumb. Even better, however, was the tart made with peaches. I kept the crust but increased sugar and cornstarch slightly for the fruit. Didn't even bother to peel the peaches. Just cut in quarters, sixths or eighths (depending on size), and arranged in concentric circles skin side down. The peaches were browned on the top and tender to the fork, sweet and tangy. My father's all time favorite pastry was an open-faced peach tart made by Ebinger's, a bakery name familiar to New Yorkers of a certain era. I'll be making this for him for Father's Day tomorrow; it is more than a fair substitute.

Made it with Red Plums...absolutely delicious, and a beautiful rich red color!

I made one large tart - for me - and four small ones to give away, following the instructions exactly. Aside from the smaller ones taking 10 minutes less baking time, they all were beautiful and delicious. A nice tart/sweet dessert that's even good for breakfast!

I made this tart the other day and found it very easy to do. The tartness of the prune plums and the sweetness of the crust were a perfect match.

This was a winner!!! I used different kinds of plums and arranged them in a circular pattern. I made a country crust (freeform) and topped the finished tart with fresh whipped creme. Definately was a hit at my party this summer!!1
