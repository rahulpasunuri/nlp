This recipe looked great & was so highly reviewed. My result was a disaster! They totally fell apart in the pan, were golden or burned on the outside and raw on the inside. We will be going out tonight, and I'll continue searching for a chickpea burger recipe that holds together. I'd make it again if someone told me the magic secret to making these perfectly!

Loved the garbanzo burgers. Lots of flavor and pretty healthy, too. Instead of the sauce, I mixed 1/4 cup sour cream with 1 teaspoon ground cumin and 1.5 TB of dijon mustard. Was really good on whole wheat pitas with spinach, cucumbers and tomatoes. Would also be delicious with hummus. Yum!

This was good, but not quite as good as a falafel should be (maybe that's why they didn't just come right out and call it that), I ended up having to sprinkle on some cumin and coriander after they were cooked, and used parsley instead of dill due to an unreasonable hatred for the herb. I did enjoy the addition of tahini, making this like a hummus-falafel hybrid.

These burgers are tasty and healthy. I ate a Caesar salad along with it and the dressing actually went well with the burger too. I didn't bother making the yogurt sauce since so many people said it was horrible.

I can't help but call these "falafel." I fried them in a bit of oil rather than using the cooking spray. Pretty good. Serves 4 only if 2 aren't very hungry, though.

i didn't find this recipe very good at all, and was very disappointed considering all the good review it got. they were very boring with a strong dill flavor. i'm a vegetarian and i'm sure there must be better veggie burger recipes out there. the black bean cakes with salsa recipe on this site is excellent.

These are great, but I suggest using less garlic. The guy I was dating, the first time I made these, complained that my garlic smell became stronger with every passing hour. Needless to say that was the last time I saw him. From now on, I'm cutting the garlic in half and only dating fellow garlic lovers.

The flavor of these burgers was great. I didn't have a problem with them falling apart at all. Cooked them on the George Forman grill and they came out great. Due to other's comments, I didn't even try the sauce, but used a basic tahinin/yogurt/garlic sauce and it was wonderful. Nice to have such a healthy alternative to hamburgers.

I liked these. Very tasty, but they do fall apart a bit. I took others' suggestions and added about a 1/4 cup of chopped firm tofu. I also added a tablespoon of low sodium soy sauce to the mixture. I mixed 3 parts plain yogurt with 1 part dijon mustard for the sauce. As my husband isn't a veggie burger person, I froze the other three for the week.

Like others, I too did not care for the sauce, which I chucked, and instead used a spicy dijon mustard. The only other change I made was to cook the burgers (on a flat griddle pan) in about a tablespoon of olive oil per side. I tend to stay away from chemically stuff like non-stick spray, and olive oil is a nice healthy alternative. These are also great the next day, reheated or even straight from the fridge. They are so healthy and easy to prepare, it's a given that these veggie burgers get made every week. As for tips, I'd make sure follow the 1/2 inch recommendation and to err on the side of thinner rather than thicker. Repeated flippings tended to make them fall apart, so I let the burgers cook a little longer, about 5 minutes or so per side, so as not to need to flip more than once. Enjoy!

Good. Did not care for the sauce at all, though. Next time will use a red sauce.

This recipe is good as is, or if you want to go sans animal products drop the egg and change the sauce by using a non-dairy mayo or something similar. It's good with a dijon or other spicy mustard. I also tried it again mixing the patties with finely diced firm tofu. I usually don't like tofu, but in something like this it's really good. You can also do variations on the bread, like a hearty rye is good for this recipe.

Delicious and healthy. I used the tricks given by other reviewers and was very happy with the results. I'll definitely make this part of my regular recipe rotation.

Followed the recipe making no changes. Very different, a nice healthful meal. We'll be having this again.

My husband - a staunch meat lover - loves these. I dust with flour to help hold them together. I agree with the reviewer below that the sauce is key and generally make extra.

I prepared the burgers for a party and everybody (not only the vegetarians) just loved them.

These are quite tasty and they worked just fine on the grill (although they took longer than 3 minutes per side). Some kind of sauce is necessary as they're a little dry on their own, but I'd use a cucumber sauce next time instead of the one included here. We served them on toasted kaiser rolls, burger style rather than in pitas. They taste like dill flavored hummus burgers. Very easy and sooo healthy!

Dill is the key. I made it without egg white and dusted with flour instead. Held together well. Excellent in flour tortilla instead of pita.

These are fast, easy,and delicious. The fresh dill is key...don't use dried!!!

These were tasty, and the yogurt sauce (use lots!) really makes them work. I didn't try them on the grill because I thought they'd fall apart, but they did work just fine in the skillet.

Easy and tasty. We're not vegetarians but meatless meals are worth trying. This one is a sure bet
