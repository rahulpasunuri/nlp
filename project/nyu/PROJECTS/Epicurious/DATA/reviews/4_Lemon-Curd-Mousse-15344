Good but heavy and a bit too sweet for my taste. I would prefer that it be more tart and lighter.

follow-up to my comment yesterday re: using only egg whites: the recipe I have calls for 6 egg yolks, 2 whole eggs, 1c. sugar; 3/4 c. freshly squeezed lemon juice. Whisk all over double boiler until thermometer reaches 160 degrees F. continue as directed to chill. At serving, add 1.5 cups whipped heavy cream. Again, this could not be a "curd" without the yolks! This is not a "heart healthy" recipe, but it is too good not to enjoy in moderation! For fun, serve in martini glasses topped with blueberries.

I cannot imagine this with only egg whites; the yolks are critical. I just received a recipe that called for several yolks in addition to the whole eggs. The mousse was served topped with blueberries and some additional citrus flavored whipped cream. so yummy.

Has anybody made this with egg white only? If so, what is the recipe?

I cut the lemon curd recipe in half and folded it into 2 cups of whipped cream (started with 1 cup unwhipped). I spread it on a pavlova then topped it with blackberries and it was excellent.

Excellent ... served as is, to fill puff pastry shells, layered with berries, etc. Just give it a fresh garnish, and it's a perfect summer or light make-ahead dessert!

Very easy to make. A good accompaniment to Angel Food cake to use up the egg yolks. Just the right amount of lemon flavour.

i used it to fill a wedding cake. i used 2 cups of heavy cream instead of 1 1/4 cup and i came out great. it was like a lemony cloud. the cake was a hit!!

Made 2 batches of this to serve my book group and everyone raved...a perfect and easy confection to serve on a blisteringly hot summer day. It did take my curd longer-- about 15 minutes total -- to come to just below a boil than the recipe indicated. Also, while I did refrigerate the curd itself overnight, I only refrigerated the finished mousses (moussi?) for about 6 hours before serving and they didn't seem to suffer for the shorter time at all.

This was very nice!!! We actually only tasted a little because we were so full from Easter dinner. I will serve tonight when friends come over.

This was excellent! To answer Betsy in Seattle, you probably needed to cook it longer--I did--it took a little longer than I thought to get the right consistency. I used meyer lemons in this for a pavlova. This would also be wonderful just by itself!....(span of time passes) Now a few months later, I'm writing, again--(strange that I have to add on to my old message). Tonight I tried it with blood oranges--AMAZING!! I used the shortbread crust from the "summer berry mint tart" recipe. THIS IS SO GOOD!!

big hit!! its not too lemony and not too sweet. I folded this into fresh whipped cream and angle food cake with layers of fresh stawberries. wow! yummy by itself or in the trifle.

I made this along with the spiced poached pears, and it was delicious. Strong, but not overwhelming, lemon flavor. Lighter than I expected. I think it would go just as well with raspberries and sauce in warmer months.

My mousse did not set up, it was very soupy, perhaps because I did not get it hot enough during the first stage.

Deep, tart but not too tart, lemon flavour. This is a light refreshing dessert after a heavy meal. Can be made ahead, always a plus. Also, the effort required is not excessive.

This was DIVINE! I made it to accompany the poached pears--my husband snubbed the pears and scarfed the mousse.

Not especially difficult and has a deep and rich lemony flavor - great!
