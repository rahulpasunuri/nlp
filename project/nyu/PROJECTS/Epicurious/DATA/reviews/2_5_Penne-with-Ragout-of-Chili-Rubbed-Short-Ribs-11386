I made this recipe because I received 3.5 pounds of short ribs that I was not expecting and did not want to do a traditional braising. I used a 7.5 quart stock pot to make this, but did not have a food mill handy, so used my stick blender. I think this would have worked better if I had skimmed the fat off first and then blended it, because the fat would not really separate once it was blended, so the finished product was a little greasy. The only other change I made was to add a couple of anchovies to the sauce to give it a little more depth (I thought it was somewhat bland without them, even with the addition of salt and pepper.) The dish turned out well, but I think another cut of meat could have been used to make just as good a sauce without the hassle of short ribs.

If I made this again I'd use more tomatoes, and maybe onions and garlic. The flavor was OK, but I have an osso buco recipe using beef shanks that is easier and better.

This is a wonderful recipe - winter time comfort food. I've made it several times. The flavor is rich and deep. Wonderful for leftovers as it improves with a bit of aging. I followed the recipe exactly as written and I used top quality chili powder.

i've made this dish twice - the first time we loved it - very good, lots of intense, varied flavor...it didn't turn out as well the second time but i'm willing to try it again!

This recipe is a little too eclectic for its own good. I made it because I happened to have all the ingredients on hand -- but that's how it ended up tasting, too -- like an ice-box cleaner. Pleasant enough, but muddy, you'd think the chili would give it some bright flavor but it doesn't. You think the ragout would be mellow and stewy, but it isn't.
