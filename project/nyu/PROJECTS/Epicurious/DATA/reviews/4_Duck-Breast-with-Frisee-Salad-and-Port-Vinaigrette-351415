Not that great...quite "simple" as in plain. Sauce was a bit sparse and not embellished enough. Cooking the duck as described worked to perfection, but little else was memorable. We did this on our "test" kitchen night but not add this to our repertoire.

This recipe makes an excellent weeknight meal. It is very fast and easy! The only thing is that I would have preferred more of a 'sauce' than what the recipe is structured for. Next time I will add a touch of stock with the port mixture. In addition, I substituted sliced Tuscan kale as the store didn't have an frisée. Excellent!

I followed a previous poster's advice and used a cast iron pan to both sear and roast the duck breast. It was absolutely perfect. I used the cold left overs in a soba salad.

Delicious! To simplify the cleanup, we used a cast-iron pan for the whole thing, from countertop to oven and back again. Substitutions: Didn't have almonds, so we used hazelnuts--very nice. We used a Peking/Long Island duck breast, not Muscovy. And the store didn't have frisee or escarole, so we used chicory. It was really, really good. And as an added bonus, if you use chicory, you get to say "chicory," which is a funny word.

Delicious and easy to make. We had it with wild rice with dried cherries.

I was afraid this recipe would be too lite and planned to add roasted potatoes and then got delayed and had to abandon them due to limited time ... it was with great pleasure that I found the duck and frisee salad to be a complete and satisfying meal. It is particularly great for those nights when you don't have a lot of time and/or you aren't looking for a large amount of food. Work the recipe as is and you will be happy. I couldn't find frisee and used endive instead and you couldn't tell there was a substitution.

This recipe is fantastic, easy to make but tastes like you worked very hard at it. My husband loved it as well.

WAS EASY AND DELICIOUS. PORT VINAIGRETTE WAS PERFECT
