Chiming in that halving the tarragon vinegar makes these much, much better. Definitely not as tangy, but unless you're a hardcore fan of sour, less vinegar will do you right and the meatballs will still come out pretty tasty (and go easier on your stomach).

The sauce sound similar to one that I make for short ribs. I use the chilli sauce (I jar), but then add cranberry sauce ( 1 can), about half a cup of a reduced beef stock, some hot sauce, a tsp. of brown sugar, and a splash of red wine vinegar. I taste and adjust by adding more sugar and vinegar if needed and some salt and pepper. It is a great sauce over braised meat dish, very homey and wonderful over rice.

This is one my husband's favorite dinners. He always says he wants those tangy meatballs. We have it over rice and with corn. Maybe not gourmet, but an easy tasty dinner.

I wanted to try these mainly because my 2 1/2 year old loves meatballs plus they seemed very easy to make and they were ,however ,this is not a good recipe and the sauce is really kind of gross...the meatballs themselves are okay.

This was quick and easy but just mediocre in taste. I expected more pizazz

Okay, I'm a guy who can't cook well. But trying to learn. I used half the vinegar per one of the suggestions, and used chinese garlic chili sauce. The meatballs came out hot and tasty. Only change I would make is using minced onion in the meatballs themselves and cooking chopped onion in the sauce.

I am just about to make this dish for a second time. The 1st was for a party & it was a big hit. All the meatballs were eaten & people were fishing around in the remaining sauce looking for more. Interesting, unusual flavors. Yummy! Great recipe for the chafing dish.

I was a bit suspicious when I saw the ingredients but I thought I would give it a shot. Very strange is all that I have to say, will not be making this again.

I was a little worried about this recipe. But all went well. I received a lot of compliments from my family on this one, especially my father-in-law, who is hard to please. I will add this recipe to our family's monthly (at least) schedule of meals. Thanks.

I made these for a holiday cocktail party, and they were liked by all. My kids LOVED them, so the recipie is moving from the Hors d"Ouevres section of my recipie file to the main dish section!

I don't get it. I thought I followed this recipe to the letter, but my version was NOT edible. If I was going to make this again--which I'm not--I would try using half of the suggested vinegar.

Yummy- I added fresh minced onion and used the new Lipton's spicy onion soup mix(by accident)and found the results fabulous.

This is a fantastic recipe. I make it with turkey instead of beef.
