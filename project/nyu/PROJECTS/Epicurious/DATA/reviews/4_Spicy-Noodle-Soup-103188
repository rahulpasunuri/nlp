I just got back from Singapore, and this is the real deal. Don't substitute anything. It's worth seeking out all of the ingedients at an Asian market.This is suposed to be a spicy dish, so cut back on the peppers if you need to, but it is perfect as is. Bean curd puffs are also called abura-age, and can be found in any Japanese grocery store. A++++

nice combination of flavors. I modified to match what I had - Saracha instead of chilis, and fish sauce instead of shrimp paste and no puffs. I also used less coconut milk as one reviewer suggested (I added it in parts to taste). But a very nice soup that I will definitely make again.

this dish actually has a name - curry laksa. the fried tofu puffs are actually optional, so you can go ahead and make this without the puffs.

hi missclawdy. haven't made this recipe, but to answer your question, "fried bean curd puffs" are just fried tofu. you can find tofu that's already been fried at any asian market. but these usually have a rubbery texture. just buy some fresh tofu and fry them yourself. goodluck!

Delicious, but I will have to either hire a sous chef or quit my job to find the time for this again. Used 1/4 of the coconut milk (just enough for the creamy texture, if you're not a big fan), added julienned carrots and green onion for color.

Takes a little bit of work but one of THE BEST recipes I've found on this site so far. Wonderful flavors and textures. It tastes very close to laksas I've had at good restaurants.

I am 11 years old and made this recipe with the help of my Aunt. We didn't have fresh blacan or lemongrass, so we had to use dried and hydrated it in the broth, then strained it out. It turned out great. My Aunt and 2 Uncles LOVED it, but my sister and I didn't think it tasted very good. I think it's for adults. My Aunt said she is DEFINATELY making it again. It's a little bit of work, but worth every second of it.
