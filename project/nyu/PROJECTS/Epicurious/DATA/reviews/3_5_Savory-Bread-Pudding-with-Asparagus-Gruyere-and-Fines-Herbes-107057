Made this for a family dinner for 10 today, and I'd say it was solid, but not amazing. I couldn't find fresh marjoram, so used dried, and cut back on the cheese by about 2 cups and added 1 egg and another cup of milk, because, as others suggested, it didn't soak all of the bread without it. Perhaps that was the problem, but it was definitely a pretty dish ans fun to make.

I guess my husband and I are in the minority; we didn't care for this. It is too heavy for our taste. The bread and cheese overwhelms the asparagus.

I adapted this to use up some ingredients from making lasagna the day before. I used 1 cup of milk, 3 eggs, around 2 cups of grated mozzarella, 1/2 cup of grated parmesan, 1/2 a loaf of day-old french bread, cherry tomatoes cut in half, cooked broccoli, and seasoned it with oregano, basil, marjoram and thyme. I cooked it in a casserole dish, and forgot to let it stand for 20 minutes - it came out delicious! This is a great way to use up leftover ingredients and is pretty adaptable as you can see.

This is a fast and easy side dish that went well with roasted chicken. It was a great way to use up odds and ends in the refrigerator. I added prosciutto and some sharp cheddar that I had left over from the holidays. In response to the other reviews, I increased the amount of liquid and used 9 eggs and 3 cups of milk. Next time I will cut the bread pieces a little smaller, perhaps 1" instead of 1 1/2".

I made this recipe for a French theme cooking party and everyone loved it. I went ahead and used the 5 cups of cheese and it was absolutely delish!

Used stale ciabatta and mixture of asiago, provolone, parmesan and american cheese. Guests really liked it!

I have made this dish a number of times now and it is perfect for both brunch and dinner. The last time I made it I added sliced mushrooms to the pudding also. It adds a nice flavor and texture. I have also experimented with using more egg, slightly less cheese. It all works.

Absolutely delicious!!!! Easy to make. The flavors melded so well. My husband couldn't restrain himself from eating mulitple servings and taking the small amount of leftovers to work for lunch. This is the one recipe worth forgetting about fat and cholesterol for one meal. You have to indulge once in a while!

This was very tasty. The husband loved it! I followed the recipe, only using all Greuyere instead of Swiss...and probably a little less than called for, it seemed like a LOT of cheese! I served this with Thomas Keller's Roasted Chicken (yum!) and a simple mache salad. This would make a great brunch dish as well.

Delicious recipe that also passed the "guy" test, and I think lends itself well to experimentation with other roasted veggies, cheeses and flavorings. I would add more egg mixture next time as I really couldn't get all the bread to "submerge.".

This was a really good side dish. Turned out a little dry for me, will just adjust size of bread cubes smaller for more even soaking.

This is a delicious recipe for a cold winter night as a main course or great as a starter. I absolutely love it.

There is a much better recipe for this same dish in Fine Cooking, Issue 26, named Asparagus Bread Pudding. It is absolutely delicious. You do not cook the aspagus first, there are two french cheeses, and fresh leeks.

I have always loved the texture of bread pudding. And I have always loved quiche. This recipe blends the two together into one of my new favorite first course dishes!

This was a different and delicious side dish for turkey and other traditonal side items at Thanksgiving...but this would be good all year round. The 3 cheeses seemed redundant, so just went with Gruyere, and only 2 1/2-3 cups of that (and it was still pretty cheesy !) It was well-received by my French hosts and the other guests.

I served this for a brunch to a French chef and a group of French people. They all had seconds and my American friends all wanted the recipe. I made the recipe as it is except I assemled it the night before and brought it to room temp in the morning before baking, which made the morning very manageable. I can't wait for an excuse to make it again and again. We will have it for Breakfast Christmas morning for certain! (PS. The leftovers were terrific.

I have made similar type overnight souffles which were much better. The dish just lacked taste and was bland.
