Wow. Out of the oven 15 minutes and it's almost gone. Thanks to the reviews I made some adjustments, but this is an excellent, truly quick and easy base recipe. Added: juice & pulp of 1/2 a lg. orange, 2 chopped apples, plenty of nutmeg, ginger, clove, allspice & cinnamon, 1 tbsp of vanilla. Subbed: 2% milk + vinegar instead of buttermilk, 3/4 c packed brown sugar + 1/3 c maple syrup. I reduced the flour, but can't remember by how much - batter was medium-thin. Epically Delicious.

I'm glad I read the reviews for this before I made it. I added an apple and a few splashes of spiced rum. I don't use pumpkin pie spice but I added cinnamon, ground cloves and nutmeg. Very good and moist!

Very frustrating to find a "spice cake" recipe that calls for "pumpkin pie spice." The whole reason I was looking for a spice cake recipe is for a great blend of spices. This recipe might as well be: mix box of yellow cake mix with pumpkin pie spice. Bake as directed.

This definetly has possibilities. First, less flour as it was dry and a little tough. Second, I increased the spice to 1 tablespoon. Third, I mixed my own blend of the usual pumpkin pie spices--cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, allspice. I like certain flavors to be more pronounced. Lastly, some softly whipped cream flavored with a little brandy really enhanced the flavor. Will make this again and continue to tinker with the proportions but definetly easy and the basics are there!

This is a two and a half. The cake it's self is a little dry. I made a powdered sugar glaze for it and served it with pumpkin ice cream and that was a really good combination. I think I will experiment with it though. Maybe add some apple butter next time to give it some moisture.

As per other reviewer's suggestions, I used about 1/4 cup less flour so it didn't turn out dry. I also used skim milk, as that's all I had. This cake has a mild flavor - don't depend on it for desert unless you are going to frost it or serve it with icecream. I thought it was better on the second day, too. But overall, it's a nice snack cake and has a subtle, sweet/spicy flavor. I would make it again if I want to make a light bread. I also think next time I will bake it in a loaf pan instead of in a square pan like it says.

I have to agree with the reviewer from New York: the cake turned out rather dry. It was somewhat flavorful but not as much as I expected. Perhaps mistake I made was making it a day ahead instead of eating it fresh out of the oven.

No question that this was a delicious cake after I ramped up the spices and added apple and rum, but for all that trouble there's a superior recipe in the New Joy of Cooking on page 933 -- Apple Spice Cake -- that's also quick and easy and definitely a 4-star keeper.

Mmmm, this one's definitely going to be part of my baking repertoire. Five people ate the entire thing at my dinner party. Used a mix of cinnamon, fresh-grated nutmeg, and ginger--allspice and cloves would have been good, but I didn't have them on hand .Used 3/4 cup plain yogurt with 1/4 c. milk instead of buttermilk, and toasted the walnuts lightly before adding. Dusted with vanilla-scented powdered sugar and served with whipped cream. Light and moist, with delicious crunchy edges.

This was great! Since it is a quick bread, just barely mix the dry and wet ingredients - anyone who found it flat or too dense in an 8x8 pan overmixed it. I used the pumpkin pie spice, the walnuts, 1/2 cup raisins, 1/8 cup of meyers rum and a peeled small apple. Cooked for 40 minutes. Very good!!!

I've made this several times already and it's one of my husband's favorites--especially with buttercream icing! I used the spice mixture recommended by a previous user, and the cake was wonderfully moist. I'd also love to try adding apples to it sometime. One thing to be careful of is overbaking... I put it in a 9x13 pan, and it only took 20-25 minutes.

This cake turned out to be very dry and it didn't have much flavor. I would not make this again.

The cake was really good, but a bit dry. Next time I will add a little less flour. I also added apples along with the walnuts, and everyone enjoyed it.

Moist, tasty cake and very easy to make! Substituted 1/2 tsp each ginger, allspice, cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, for the pumpkin pie spice. Baking time was under 45 minutes.

You can't ruin this cake. I only had 3/4c brown sugar but made up the difference with white. No pumpkin pie spice Ijust added cinnom, alspice, ginger & nutmeg, didn't have buttermilk I used skim milk w/couple drops of lemon and I added chopped apples. It came out fantistic
