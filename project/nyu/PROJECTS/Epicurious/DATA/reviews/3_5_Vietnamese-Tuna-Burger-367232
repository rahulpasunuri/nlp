Yum! These are really good, and easy, too. Not fishy at all, not that I mind fish. A great way to stretch fresh tuna. When it's on sale, I will make these again.

i chopped the tuna by hand so it wasnt as fine as if i had used a food processor but they held together well and cooked up nicely. i loved the mint and cilantro but i thought the slaw topping could have used more dressing than was called for.

I made these last night for dinner and followed the previous reviewers' advice and used a food processor. The consistency was perfect and they cooked up beautifully. I left out the mint as well, because I'm not a fan of mint, but they really didn't need it. They were absolutely delicious and I'll be making these again.

These burgers are absolutely delicious. I leave out the mint, because I don't really like mint. I recommend putting all the ingredients for the patties together in the food processor and processing until broken up. Then form patties and refrigerate briefly. That way, the burgers hold together beautifully.

This mix of flavors is delicious but kind of sucks as a burger. The patties are on the small side (if you follow the recipe portions) and the bun overwhelms the flavor. I'm definitely making this again, but maybe with the tuna cut into larger chunks and stir-fried into a filling for some pitas.

These turned out excellent! I got lazy, and threw the tuna in the food processor with all the ingredients. The result, once formed into patties, was pretty close to the consistency of a tuna steak, so no problems with them falling apart. I also added shredded fennel to the slaw, and a little sweet chili sauce. I found a miso red pepper - mayonnaise substitute at the store that made for a really good non-dairy dipping sauce.

You may want to try prepping them early so that they have time to set, this should make a big difference. Even if you're short on time, pop them in the freezer for 1/2 hr or so and they'll do great! (Be sure to pank-coat lol after)
