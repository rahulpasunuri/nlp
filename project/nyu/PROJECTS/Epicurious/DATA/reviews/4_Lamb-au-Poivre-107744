This was easy to make and tasty, too. I used 4 boneless lamb leg steaks rather than rib chops. I substituted garlic for shallot and Viognier Port for Cognac. The kids like it (the black pepper was a bit spicy for the 6 year old, but the 9 year old had two helpings!). My husband and the 9 year old guilded the lily by adding jalepeno jelly as a condiment (our new favorite addition to lamb when there is no mint jelly on hand). I was happy with the sauce as is. Served with braised brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes Anna, and baked cipollini onions. A yummy Sunday dinner!

Has become a favourite standby in our house. Instead of rib chops (too expensive), I use shoulder chops or whatever cut looks good. I often serve with bulgar.

Easy, delicious, and the kids loved it. Used lamb loin chops instead of rib chops by mistake, and was still wonderful. Will definitely make this again...and again, and again.

I can't believe I never reviewed this recipe. I've made this a thousand times since it was published in 2003. I love this dish. I've made it for myself and for company and people go crazy over it. It's so simple to make. I make the recipe exactly as written and it comes out fantastic every time.

Good, fast and easy. A bit short of flavor, but overall, rather good.

This dish was great. Used balsamic and followed the recipe exactly...the sauce was AMAZING and would be good on pork or chicken as well. Delicious.

The lamb itself was good - the recipe didn't overpower the delicate cut of meat - however, the sauce to me could have given the dish more to make it stand out - the sauce also didn't reduce to the thickness I'd of preferred. I found too I used cream instead of butter in the sauce. I might make it again but would make the sauce off the top of my head rather than follow this recipe.

Tasty and quick. Definitely worthy of repeat

Great flavor! I made one change and that was to substitute pomegranate molasses for the cognac/balsamic vinegar. I love the way that pomegranate and lamb go together and this dish did not let me down. I served it with the (Braised Eggplant and Peppers) dish that you can find on this site, very tasty.

Sorry to ruin the trend, but my boyfriend and I (who both love lamb) tried this tonight and were not very impressed. It's okay...but just so-so. I won't be making this again.

My dad and I had a "Lamb Off" to see who could make the best lamb--my sister was judging. I used this recipe, and won! It was so simple, and so tasty, and it makes for a lovely presentation!

This dish was quite easy to prepare, the flavor, delicious. We even used some poor cut lamb chops and it tasted good, so it must be exquisite with a good cut of meat.

made this for my in-laws, including two people who aren't big lamb fans, and it came out great and they loved! was quick, easy, and delicous!

Perfect. This was my first forte into preparing lamb and it was easy and delicious. I used brandy instead of cognac and doubled the sauce. I followed the hint below, keeping the chops in a warm oven while I made the sauce and that worked well.

...one more thing to add to the review below: I used cheap brandy in place of the cognac...adding and extra 50%.

YEOWZA! This is a GREAT recipe! I used 12 little loin chops (the T-bone-looking ones...) and 4x the recipe. I lightly coated a 13x9 glass dish with olive oil and then browned the chops 2 mins. per side in a hot skillet (2 batches), put them in the oven at 375° for 10 mins. (PERFECT for med. rare), while I made the sauce. I used the unsalted butter, altho I'd bought cream like another reviewer suggested, but decided the butter was FAB! I added Kitchen Bouquet to make the gravy a richer-brown color. Plopped a big dollop of garlic mashed potatoes, put two chops on top and the sauce over! Served with quick-sauteed yellow and green zucchini, a crusty ciabatta and.....UNBELIEVEABLE! Only my 13-yr. old thought it was too spicy! The four other adults (me included) RAVED that it rivaled any restaurant dish! Can't wait to make again, since we just butchered three lambs and they are tidy & wrapped in white paper in the freezer.....we'll be enjoying this recipe A LOT! Bon Appetit, Foodies!!!

SO EASY AND SO YUMMY!!! The pepper added the zing, and the cognac made the dish a little more special. I made this dish for 6, and everyone loved it.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and would give it 2.5 stars. It was good, but not spectacular. Next time I will use a cheaper cut of lamb, add more cognac and substitute cream in place of the butter.

omigod!! this dish was great. i rarely give 4 forks, but this was easy enough to make after work, and was excellent. I am writing this with shallots & balsamic vinegar dripping down my chin. Marvelous.

This dish was fantastic! So simple, yet so tasty and very impressive. I will definetly make this again! I love lamb and I love this recipe!

My husband and I loved it. We just decided to make lamb in the middle of the week. It is so easy to make. I used lamb sirloin instead of lamb chop,and it still turned out fantastic. I also cooked the lamb a little bit longer than indicated. The sauce makes the dish.

This was the first meal i made for my boyfriend, so the pressure was on. (I'm not a very experienced cook, but he is.) I have to say, it came out amazing! Tender, tasty, and looks like a lot more work than it is. Only problem is, now he thinks i can cook and expects repeat performances!

Because of the simplicity, I thought this dish was going to be okay but not great. What I discovered after making it is quite the contrary. I grilled my lamb chops for 8 minutes (4 each side) and cooked the sauce separately. This really is a quick and surprisingly delicious way to prepare lamb chops.

After countless steaks au poivre, this was a nice change. Used small loin chops instead of rib chops but made no other changes. Served with Spinach Salad with Oranges and Almonds (also on this site). Will do it again.

I've made this twice! I love the ease and flavor, and it holds up just fine on cheaper cuts of lamb, which is no small consideration. A little lemon juice before the chops hit the skillet doesn't hurt.

Major yum! I thought the amount of pepper would be hidious, but it was a delight.

the flavor of the sauce was great, but I wished the meat itself had absorbed more of the flavor-- somehow I was left feeling there must be a better recipe for the wonderful lamp chops we bought...

I tried this recipe on lamb riblets - it was great. I only breaded 1/2 of the riblets - it was good either way.

Rating: 4
I rarely rate recipes 4 forks but this was tres tasty and easy. Only changes I made was to wipe the chops w/fresh lemon juice and added French grey sea salt to les pouvres. Great or a small dinner party as well! I served it with wilted spinach and green salad with baslamic/rice vinegar/ olive oilve dressed salad.

We just moved to Lancaster England from the US (Virginia) and the salt marsh lamb here is fabulous. This was a great way to prepare it. It highlighted the flavor of the lamb without smothering it. Next time we will make it for our local British friends, that is how much we enjoyed it.

I first made this recipe on Valentine's Day for my husband, but I thought it might be better with mustard and cream, so I combined this with Emeril's Steak au Poivre recipe and it turned out well. This weekend, I planned to make the same again, but forgot to buy the cream, so I followed the recipe exactly this time and it was even better than the more caloric version.

This dish was excellent. I actually made it for four people and it worked out beautifully. I did not have Cognac so I substituted Brandy which gave it the same effect. When cooking this for a larger crowd - I recommend preheating your oven to 200 degrees to keep the lamb warm until you sear all of the lamb chops - they will remain medium rare and it will give you time to make the sauce. I'd make it again!
