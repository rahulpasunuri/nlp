Really loved this recipe. The reviews are so spilt I had to try it! I did it the easiest way possible, mircrowaved sweet potatoes, and "mashed" all the ingredients with a handmixer. Different and delish! Very easy to prepare. Used the exact ingredients recommnded. The flavor was complex. The balsamic added a savory sweetness and the cinnamon rounded it out nicely with the right amount of "spicyness". Try it, Do it the easy way. You won't be dissapointed.

My husband and I loved this recipe. The balsamic and cinnamon flavors were not overwhelming at all -- just perfect. I did use creme fraiche though, which is similar but not quite the same as sour cream. I will be making this again.

Balsamic vinegar and sweet potatoes seams like an odd combination but this recipe is great. In the future I will mash the potatoes by hand. Using the food processor made them rather "gluey".

It's amazing how wildly the reviews for this dish vary. I really like it! It's slightly more complex and fancy-tasting than your average mashed sweet potatoes. I agree with the reviewer who said to use full-fat sour cream and with the other reviewer who said to just taste as you go. The cinnamon can be left out if you don't want cinnamon-y sweet potatoes. All around lovely recipe.

If you like sweet potatoes, just say "No" to this recipe. I skipped the cinnamon as suggested by another reviewer. I used a good quality balsamic, and it overpowered the sweet potato taste. Adding the cinnamon in didn't help, the cinnamon then predominated. We rarely waste food in our house, but as my husband had made a delicious stuffed turkey breast, we threw this in the compost, and I made plain mashers instead. If you like sweet potatoes, just stick to the basics: butter, salt, and pepper. That's what I'll do next time. Less is more.

Delicious and sooooo easy! Instead of sour cream I added Total yogurt. Yummmmmmmm.

This was easy to make but not great. I didn't like the combination of balsamic with sweet potatoes. (And yes, I used a very good quality balsamic.) Admittedly I'm more of a brown sugar/pecan kinda sweet potato gal, but made this to try to coax my hubbie to eat sweet potatoes. He liked this more than with brown sugar, but not enough to have seconds. We threw the rest out.

These are wonderful, a great lighter side dish for Thanksgiving or anytime. But please don't destroy your food with fat free dairy products. It uses so little sour cream that I didn't feel any guilt about using regular.

This was really good. I agree with the cook who quit while they were ahead. I used the microwave to cook the potatoes, mashed everything by hand with a ricer and skipped the cinnamon. This was a side dish to the Duck with Sauteed Mushrooms on this site. The subtle sweetness and tang was really nice with the savory flavor of the duck. I can definitely see this with pork. But I don't think I'll stop there - Thanksgiving will be here soon, with a whole lot of "guinea pigs"

YUM! YUM! YUM! Bursting with balsamic vinegar flavor in creamy sweet potatoes. Goes great with pork.

I may or may not make this again. This recipe was a lot of work for flavor that was above average but nothing special. I would save the effort for something else.

Yummy and easy. What's not to like? The balsamic vinegar really brings out the sweetness of the potatoes.

Beyond delicious. The tartness of the balsamic vinegar complemented the sweetness of the potatoes beautifully. In addition this recipe couldn't be easier. I will make this again and again.

Have made this several times. Easy and great tasting. Brings out the flavor of the sweet potatoes without being too sweet.

I took the basic concepts of this dish & made my own creation that turned out quite good. Instead of dragging out the food processor, I baked the sweet potatoes in the oven & mashed them with a hand mixer- a little butter, a little sour cream, a little balsamic vinegar - tasted it & decided to quit while I was ahead. If you like cinnamon in your sweet potatoes, or a more traditional version (brown sugar, pecans, etc.) I wouldn't recommend this dish. P.S. Williams Sonoma carries an excellent balsamic vinegar, I believe the brand is called Fini. The stuff you get at a grocery store won't cut it with this dish.

Can anyone suggest a good balsamic?

Liked the flavors. No complaints from the dinner guests. This is not the most ornate, nor the most intricate recipe, but it gets the job done. The vinegar and sour cream create a unique flavor with the sweet potatoes. Tasty and easy.

I made this based on the reviews and was very disappointed. I even used very good balsamic. It tasted like pumpkin pie. Now I love pumpkin pie, but not as a side dish. There are much better masked sweet potato recipes out there.

This tasted like overcooked apple pie filling. Not horrible, but definitely tasted peculiar.

I tried this as an experiment, because I like balsamic vinegar and I like sweet potatoes, and was pleased with the result. The recipe is simple enough to make again and again. This is a side dish I'll definitely repeat.

I've made these sweet potatoes often, including Thanksgiving. Everyone raved about them and no one missed having a more traditional sweet potato dish

This is a fantastic dish!! I am baffled by all the comments around sour/bitter flavours... What on earth kind of balsamic vinegar are you people using? Try investing in some good quality balsamic and perhaps you will enjoy this dish as it was intended!

What a dynamite combination of flavors. Followed the recipe exactly, it is so simple there is no need to improvise.

I found that the original recipe was bitter, but promising (I'm not a big fan of really sweet sweet potatoes). So I added a bit more sour cream, 2 Tbsp. orange juice and 3 Tbsp. of honey, then topped the potatoes with chopped pecans and baked it to toast the pecans. The honey and OJ took out the bitterness and the pecans added some fullness. Just right.

A very nice and different way of doing sweet potatoes. I can see where the sourness might turn some people off, but I thought it balanced well with the yams' sweetness.

yummers! Goodbye, bland sweet potatoes! Hello, sweet potato heaven!

As I prefer not to add additional sweeteners to an already sweet vegetable such as sweet potato, this dish is very much to my taste. The cinnamon is very subtle, as is the balsamic vinegar. I will definitely prepare this again!

I thought this was just great! I loved the way the sweetness of the potatoes was set off by the balsamic vinegar! My husband prefers french fries, but I will make this again!

I was disappointed in the taste but I did have others tell me they enjoyed it. I took them to a barbeque where the main dish was pork chops. They needed something....butter and brown sugar maybe...I didn't care for the sourness that the vinegar gave to this dish. Maybe i am just a traditionalist when it comes to sweet potatoes.

Extraordinary! I made it several times for us and for guests, we are all in awe. The balsamic vinegar and sour cream nicely cut the sweetness of the potatoes, yet go nicely with pork tenderloin which calls for sweetness in the accompaniment. MERCI, MERCI!
