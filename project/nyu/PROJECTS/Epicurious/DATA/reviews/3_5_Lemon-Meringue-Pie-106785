For crust: I used a frozen Marie Callendars, let it defrost and reformed the fluting to look homemade -- easy! For the filling: I increased the lemon juice to 1/2 cup and didn't skimp on the zest. I cooked it until it was completely thickened and it made a terrific creamy-firm texture after setting. For the meringue: a PINCH of salt is all it needs; and I had too much meringue to pile on, so would only use 4 large egg whites next time. I wasn't careful to spread the meringue to completely touch the crust, so it pulled away after sitting. Tasted zingy-great! In the morning it was weepy, so maybe I'll try the cornstarch tip next time.... or just eat it all and leave no leftovers to get weepy!

The meringue wept real tears. The filling had started to ooze before it was cool enough to refrigerate. We like a tart pie and this one was pretty sweet. Aside from that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?

Incredible Recipe. I used the Graham cracker crust instead but followed everything else exactly. I completly disagree with others comments of the filling being to runny.

OUTSTANDING!!! I used superfine sugar for the meringue and it turned out nicely. Make sure you let pie come to room temperature before placing in refrigerator to avoid weeping and soggy crust.

I made this pie dairy-free by substituting Fleishman's unsalted margarine for the butter, resulting in a delicious firmly set lemon filling. My meringue set nicely too, but when serving, I didnt like the way the meringue slid off the pie too easily when transfering the slice to the plate, I wish it would "bond" aliitle to the lemon part. I am making it again today.

Absolutely fantastic. Worked perfectly, and this was my first time making lemon curd AND meringues. I had to make a few changes to measurements and ingredients (to account for UK equivalents), and used a sweet shortcrust pastry, but had none of the problems with the lemon curd that others here have found (how slowly did you bring the sugar starch mix to the boil? I took almost half an hour, and it thickened perfectly). As for the salty meringue? I just used a few twists from my grinder instead of the full quantity.

I've made this several times and it turned out great everytime. I use a little less sugar and a little more lemon since we like it tart.

this recipe was ok... one thing i would really caution against is the salt in the meringue. my friends immediately noticed the salty taste and when i left leftovers, they mentioned they would probably eat it without the meringue. salty meringue? eew.

Wonderful recipe. I made it for passover and used potato starch instead of cornstarch. For the crust I used the crust recipe from the Hazelnut Macaroon and Strawberry Tart. I can't wait to make this again.

I would never make this pie again. I left it in the fridge over night, but when I tried to serve it the lemon was still soupy.

To the cook from NY: You can keep your meringue from weeping several ways - one, add a teaspoon of cornstarch to the sugar when beating your meringue. Secondly, make sure your filling is HOT before topping with the meringue - if your filling is cool, it will prevent the meringue from setting up properly, causing it to break down. Lastly, most folks don't allow the pie to cool completely before putting it in the fridge - that can cause the pie to sweat, and collapse your meringue as well. Hope this helps!

Starting from the eating and going backwards: This pie was delicious and loved by my guests. It did develop a little runny syrup that I acidentally spilled onto my kitchen floor...whoops! I added a little more lemon juice to make it less sweet. I used a crisco pie crust (ala Betty Crocker's original book), which held up famously to the lemon filling. The meringue did shrink at bit. Why would I make it again: it was so delicious and so much like the lemon meringue pie my grandma made years ago.

I loved the way this pie tastes but I need some help troubleshooting. I made the pie and it was beautiful. I allowed it to cool for quite some time before putting it in the refrigerator. It chilled overnight. When I took it out this afternoon, there was a sugary syrup overflowing the pie and into the tupperware container I had it sealed in. There was a lot of syrup! The meringue also looked as though it had decreased in size. I would love to make this again but without the syrup running all over. Can anyone give me a definative answer as to what happened?

The pie's taste and flavor were great but it was runny. Yes, it was cooked long enough and was thickened when placed in the pie crust. The merinque was thick and rich.

A tremendous lemon meringue pie that sets up beautifully. I added a third tablespoon of lemon zest for a truly tangy lemon taste.

This pie turned out great, with one problem: the filling was runny. Yes, I let it cook long enough to thicken, and I even let it cool a bit to see if it would settle more. But it didn't. So I added some more cornstarch in water, thickened it up on the stove, and in the end, it turned out great. Really nice flavor, lots of compliments from my guests!

Very delicious! My husband the big pie fan was beside himself with yummyness. I like the fact that there is no milk in the filling, and I enjoyed the light marshmallowy texture of the meringue. Remember to test the balance of lemon and sugar since some lemons are sweeter than others. There was very little runniness or seeping of juice. I have also used this pie filling for lemon turnovers with Chef Azul's pie crust (on this web site), and ate the leftovers as a sort of lemon pudding, all yummy.
