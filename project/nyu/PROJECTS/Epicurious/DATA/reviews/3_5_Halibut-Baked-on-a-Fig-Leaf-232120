We had great luck with this method of cooking halibut, using both grape and fig leaves. The fig leaf gives it a very subtle coconut flavor. We broil it on a gas grill on high. Depending on the number of leaves that are used, it takes about 8 to 10 minutes. The fish comes out hot and very moist. It is messy to unwrap, so we do that in the kitchen. It could b served on a slightly steamed leaf for the effect, but the flavor, moisture, and texture are perfect. We served it with a wedge of lemon and a fruit salsa with a jalapeno chile.

I baked the halibut in the oven at 375 but it required 15-20 min. not 10 as stated in the recipe. I had wonderful fig leaves (neighbors tree hangs over on my side of the back yard). Used toothpicks to hold the leaves in place. Presentation looked good but getting the leaves unwrapped and getting to the halibut was messy for my guests. I placed a "debris" plate on the table for the leaves. I would not make it again - just bake the halibut in the oven in a covered dish.
