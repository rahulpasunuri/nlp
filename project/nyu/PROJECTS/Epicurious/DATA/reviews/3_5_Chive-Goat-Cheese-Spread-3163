This one was the most popular of three spreads I served with bagels. I didn't have near enough chives on hand but it was still tasty. I didn't wrap the finish product in whole chives -- too much frou frou for me - - just served it in a bowl.

I would tone down the garlic just a tad. Otherwise this cheese is delicious. My friends asked for the recipe. Should I give it them?

Couldn't be easier to make. I thought the flavors were wonderful - you have to really like goat cheese to find it appealing, though. I doubled the recipe but left the amount of chives at 6 tbsp., which seemed plenty.

If you're a goat cheese fan, then you'll like this recipe. I had chives that needed harvesting, and this was a great way to use them. This spread would be perfect for a wine and cheese picnic.

Very good spread. I served it along with smoked salmon on bread and it was a big hit!

We made it for a cocktail party. Not a big hit. Good presentation. I'm not sure why it wasn't popular. We had many high quality hard cheeses that were very popular, so that may have been a factor. It may also be that my friends don't care for goat cheese.

This was a real hit at my Mother's Day brunch. I served it as a bagel spread instead of the ususal cream cheese. Very intensely flavored--delicious! I used Chevre (another type of goat cheese) with good results, and only used 3 oz of cream cheese (that's all I had on hand) with great results.
