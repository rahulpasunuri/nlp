Delicious and easy to make. My family loves this recipe! I now make it a couple of times a month. I modified the recipe slightly, using low sodium soy sauce instead of tamari, toasted sesame oil instead of safflower oil, one bunch of spinach, 8-10 oz. box of porcini or white mushrooms, and 8-10 oz. box of shitake mushrooms. The shiitakes add a lot of flavor. I highly recommend using them. Since I added more veggies, it can be a lot to handle for a 12 inch iron skillet, so sometimes I will make this in my dutch oven.

Loved this recipe. I'm not Korean but have eaten my share of chap chae. All of the chap chae recipes I've seen were complicated. THis was pretty easy to prepare. Would definitely make this again and serve it for company.

This was an okay recipe. I lived in Korea for three years and ate Chop Chae often, so I have some pretty high standards. I used Tamari and agree that this recipe seems a little salty. I also added some sesame seeds but there was just a little something missing. I would also suggest doubling the veggies- they cook down so much and there were not as many in the finished dish as I expected. I also think this could serve more like 6-8 side dish servings and adding marinated beef definitely helps, as does letting the flavors meld a bit. A good starting off point.

whoever said this dish had no flavor is NUTS!!! my husband is korean and he said it is pretty authentic. I too added some toasted sesame seeds and a bit of hot pepper flakes (and shrimp -- not korean.) I also used more spinach and did not use the safflower oil (used a tad bit of sesame oil.) delicious!

Great flavor! I would give this dish 3.5 stars if I could. I took off the half of a star because of the texture of the noodles, but I don't think that was a recipe issue, they were just different and probably take some getting used to. The flavors in the dish were excellent, and even the leftovers were good. I will make this dish again.

This was an excellent recipe with some minor changes i made. As other reviewers suggested, i used sesame oil instead of safflower oil and instead of mushrooms and spinach which i didn't have on hand, i used broccoli and red bell pepper. Also, while i was stir frying my veggies, i added crushed red pepper to them to make it spicy. I didn't have any bean thread noodles, so i simply used some spaghetti noodles. it was really excellent, and i'd highly recommend it.

This is one of the worst things I have ever made. I imagine I will throw it out rather than eat it. It is a huge gelatinous glop -- maybe it's the noodles? Ugh.

Pretty good. Nothing super exciting, but solid. I think adding some spice, esp. some korean chili paste, makes this better. I also cut down a bit on the tamari, but I didn't need to much. Maybe the cook who said this was to salty used soy instead of tamari? Soy and tamari have a similar flavor, but are brewed differently and thus, regular soy sauce (e.g. kikkoman) has a ton more salt and a less mellow flavor than tamari.

the only thing i would change for this recipe is to ommit the safflower oil. use only sesame oil and add toasted sesame seeds when sauteeing the vegetables. you can't substitute the noodles or add bok choy because it alters the authenticity of the dish. if it's too salty for your palate then cut the soy sauce in half and go from there.

this was way to salty, we didn't enjoy it at all. Will not make this again.

I thought this dish was excellent. I made a few changes to accomodate what I had on hand. I used leftover linguine noodles and baby bok choy (instead of spinach). I added just a touch of chili oil for a bit of heat and the result was awesome. I'll definitely make again.

Delicious.

I know this dish well (having been raised in a Korean household). While this particular recipe is not the best I've ever had, it's still decent and worthwhile. I used dang myun noodles (instead of bean thread), soy sauce (instead of tamari), all sesame oil (instead of safflower oil), used 2 carrots (instead of 3), doubled the mushrooms (a mixture of white, bella, and shitake), doubled the baby spinach, added about 1 teaspoon of roasted sesame seeds, and added a sprinkling of red pepper powder. The sesame oil and roasted sesame seeds are important. The dish tasted better served cold, a day after being prepared. Next time, I'll add some beef slices that are marinated in the sauce.

I'd give this 3.5 forks if I could. Very good and easy to make with ingredients available at most markets these days; no need to make a special trip to an Asian market. I paired it with Trader Joe's prepared Bool Kogi. (It's pretty good for something you just unwrap and grill, although it won't live up to what you get at your favorite Korean BBQ.)

Made this exactly as recipe states and it was wonderful. I will definately make this again. Wonderful flavor!

pretty authentic, although, i do agree with the last reviewer about the noodles. you cannot substitute with mung bean or wheat noodles otherwise it is not authentice korean chap-chae. a few minor adjustments i thought this needed was using sesame oil throughout (no safflower), as well as, adding toasted sesame seeds when sauteing the vegetables. in my opinion, that's really what gives this dish it's flavor. it is, actually, what distinguishes most korean food from other asian cuisines.

This is a great noodle dish. I added tofu and snow peas to make it a meal. I also used reduced sodium tamari (recommended by another reviewer), but next time I might do a combination of regular and reduced sodium. I will also try some shredded cabbage, added at the onion stage. Try stir-frying until some of the noodles brown, adds a little extra flavor and texture.

This was a wonderful, easy dish to make for vegetarian friends. I used wheat pasta, added cabbage, broc, peppers and doubled the sauce. We also added hot chili flakes and subbed peanut oil for the safflower. Yummy!!

Wow, finally a chap chae recipe that rivals that of my mother's. This recipe is actually 3.5 forks-worthy: it's very tasty, easy, and a fantastic vegetarian meal (chap chae usually has thin slices of beef in it). My only complaints are that it's a little too salty, and authentic chap chae uses "dang myun", noodles made out of sweet potato starch. They end up being clear when you cook them, similar to cellophane/mung bean noodles, but the strands are a bit thicker and more resilient. You can generally find these noodles next to mung bean noodles in an Asian grocery store. Next time I'll use either reduced sodium tamari or 75% regular tamari and 25% water. Still, quite good. I also added a bit extra spinach, a blend of exotic mushrooms, and a sliced zucchini with some baby corn since I didn't have enough carrots on hand. The liquid took a LOT longer to evaporate, however, maybe b/c of the extra veggies. I eventually just transferred the noodles and vegetables to a serving plate, leaving the excess liquid behind since I didn't want the food to get too mushy or too absorb too much salt.
