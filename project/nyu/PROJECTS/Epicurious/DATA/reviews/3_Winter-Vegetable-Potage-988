My husband and I loved this soup. Before serving I used my hand blender and blended the soup.

Overcooked veggies with mushy consistency. Icky color. Okay flavor. We used a sweet potato rather than a russet and that was my favorite part.

Was easy enough to make but just tasted like a bunch of vegetables cooked cooked together - the whole wasn't greater than the sum of it's parts.

I did not put rosemary in it...just lots of pepper and the few dashes of ground nutmeg.

I really enjoyed this soup/stew however I made some of my own adjustments. First, I did not have leeks so I used half of a yellow onion. I also used chicken broth..its all I had. After cooking down the onions I added the cabbage and sautéd it in the butter for a bit. Then added broth, potato and veggies (fresh steamed carrots and broccoli). While simmering I also added a few dashes of ground nutmeg (I think cabbage and nutmeg go well together). It turned out delicious! I will definitely make this again...easy, cheap, and good!

agree with others about rosemary, go light. sweet potatoes are a good addition as a substitute to other root veggies

We liked this recipe very much and I'll definitely make it again. I didn't have pre-cooked vegetables so I boiled carrots and used the carrot water for my veg broth plus some chicken broth. It tasted great and was very easy.

I very much enjoyed this recipe. It's also great with a yellow onion instead of leeks.

Good recipe if you don't have a lot of time. I agree with the comment below about the rosemary. Turnips and carrots are good. Would avoid broccoli. Bacon or lardons is also good.

this is a very thick soup, so if you like it less so, cut the veggies small and add extra broth. the amount of rosemary called for is too strong, i would cut it in half and then taste the soup to see if you want more.

As for the previous reviewer from Dallas: consider the source.

This was a good, hearty, winter soup, and received good reviews from friends and spouse. To each bowl of soup, I added a small pat of butter and some pepper. I always serve soup with a good country bread, warmed and soft. You can basically add any left over vegetables to this soup, and in fact, I did add left-over, cooked peas to this soup on day 3. I will make this again.

Perfect for a cold winters dinner. I didn't have any cabbage so I added other veggies to compensate. Didn't miss a thing!

I really liked this dish. Instead of Napa or regular cabbage, I used Bok Choi, which worked fine. For some reason, though, my soup didn't thicken up whatsoever at the end, so I just dumped the whole batch of it into the blender, added a touch more vegetable broth, and turned it into a thick soup. Fabulous. It was so easy to make, I will definitely do it again.
