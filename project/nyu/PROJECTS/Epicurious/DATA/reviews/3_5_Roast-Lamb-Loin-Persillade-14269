I tried this for a special occasion, and everyone said it was great, but I was very disappointed. I'm sure it would have been wonderful if it hadn't been so overcooked. I made the mistake of not checking with a meat thermometer at the half-way point, and at 30 minutes the meat was over 170 degrees. At 425, this amount of meat might have been medium rare at 15 to 20 minutes. I bought a bone-in lamb loin and boned it myself and it was still quite expensive, so I don't think I'd try a whole lamb loin again. The sauce was good, and I might make that again to put on lamb chops.

I belong to a grass-feed co-op so I used the grass fed loin that came with my monthly ration. The recipe was great, I wish that grass-fed beef was as good as grass fed lamb...the world would be a better place. Dug this dish.

Talk about sensory overload. What a lovely, green smelling and tasting dish. I opted to make the persillade in a mortar instead of the blender. Just what I needed in the doldrums of winter.

This was a winner at our event. I admit that I found my New Zealand lamb at Sams club of all places but it was tender and delicious all the same - and the right price. I stuffed the lamb with the persillade for more presentation based upon Seattle's review and made the mushroom sherry cream sauce as suggested by Yen from Singapore (thanks to you both!)

Very amusing previous comments. Anyway, to the reviewer who was having a hard time finding lamb loin, I found it at Trader Joe's and it was about $13 for 1.1 lbs, perfect for two people. Not tied, but it cooked fine without it. This was tasty, but I found it very difficult to make such a small amount of sauce & to get it pureed in the blender. Easier to use a mini food processor (Osterizer accessory). Nice, fresh flavor, and the loin was very tender.

Earl - you must be "drinken" because no wine was used in this recipe. Trolling are you....? - The recipe was terrific, simple and delicious. If you don't like lemon, use a mint jelly/sauce, or sauce of choice.

the reviews were so entertaining (who can resist cooks being catty?) that i was motivated to make this recipe. followed advice for searing first. also made more of the persillade which i used both inside and also put some on before roasting. took out at 118 degrees as suggested. melt in your mouth amazing. served with green beans and feta (tom douglas/big dinners) and cauliflower salad with olives and capers (from epicurious).

Easy and delicious - the perfect combination. I live in a small town, but luckily there is a Publix supermarket which carries a great variety. For those with this dilema try an online store advertised on Epicurious. I have done this and had good luck and the prices are gererally quite reasonable.

One hint, that matters. Sear that baby first before adding your persillade to caramelize the outside and improve your flavour. Then, it's better rare, with that crust and you can take it out at 118 degrees. Let it sit for ten minutes and then carve away. You'll love it, believe me. Forget the cost, you're dead a long time. You're worth it!!

worked out great. I added a little mint to the parsley. I'm having baloney roll-ups dregged in crushed Doritos tommorow, I'll send the recipe to the person from Centerville

This was easy and delicious, and even the most amateur cook can pull this off. Make a sauce with the drippings by frying thickly sliced mushrooms in it with some sherry and cream. sooooo good!

Where the heck did any of you find the hunk of meat required in this recipe? I went to THREE stores and the closest I could get was New Zealand lamb at 13.99/lb - By the time they deboned and got me to 1.5 pounds, I had to pay $41.03 (it took three pounds with the bone in to make 1.5 deboned pounds) However, it was three seperate hunks of meat that I had to piece together. It was a disaster. The butchers all looked at me like i was crazy! Personally, I'd rather go to a restaurant for that kind of money.

Excellent recipe - and a nice alternative to pesto. I actually "stuffed" the loins the night before and let them "marinade" - what a terrific flavor. Definitely a keeper.

I have made this dish four times with great fanfare. The real key is getting a quality lamb loin. It is a beautiful presentation and I reserve this dish for those "must impress" times. I have also made this dish with pork loin, but lamb is better.

Serves great with sun-dried tomato risotto
