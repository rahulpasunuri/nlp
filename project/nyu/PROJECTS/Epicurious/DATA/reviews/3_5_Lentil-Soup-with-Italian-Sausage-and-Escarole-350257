This is really good: nice rich flavor and aroma. Be sure to use a good-quality sausage, as its flavor permeates the rest of the soup. Next time I would drain off some of the fat from browning the sausage. I would recommend chopping the escarole into smallish pieces (say, 1" square). I got lazy and left it in ribbons, which were stringy when cooked.

Really delicious recipe. I used turkey sausage instead of Italian, but that's because it's what I had in the house. I also took half the soup and put it through the blender before adding the sausage and the escarole. It helped thicken the soup and gave it a more velvety feel. It's low in calories, pretty easy to prepare, and a crowd pleaser at a low price. It can be prepared hours ahead, and makes a wonderful Sunday lunch with a great French or sourdough bread, or a hearty, light, weekday dinner you can cook ahead of time. Definitely give this one a try.

Wonderful combo of healthy lentils and 2 of my favorites, sausage and escarole. There is a lot of prep, but the end result is amazing! Well worth the time spent.

This was easy to cook and prep. I use Turkey Italian sausage rather than pork or beef. I also used herb mix salad substituting it for the escarole since our grocer did not have it in. It is a healthy and hearty soup with a great taste

This is certainly a delicious and savory/hearty soup.It's relatively simple;although if you aren't great with a chopping knife,it's a lil tedious to prepare. In terms of mouthfeel, I get why the recipe and people in the review keep the casings on and dice it:you want larger chunks than your veggies so it can contrast.Heck,if I knew how,I would have made some cute and tasty mini croutons to dress it with just for added crunch ( I hate the idea of a completely homemade dish topped off with some Company's generic product on my dish). As an added not,it's surprisingly filling too;which is awesome ,because it's great when your want delicious,nutrient dense and AFFORDABLE:)

SOOO delicious! I made it with a lot of kale instead of the escarole and it was full of flavor. I also sauteed the sausages before putting them in the soup which gave them a nice texture. Instead of using croutons, I made one large oversized, thin crouton with melted parmesean for each guest. Definitly a make-again!

I originally got this recipe from Ruth Reichl's _Gourmet for Today_. Made it back in the winter and then found myself craving it again in August. It is perfect as is - tastes hearty and healthy and delicious - all at the same time.

I made this so I could feel good about eating healthfully and didn't expect it to be so tasty. The escarole at the store looked sad and wilty so I subbed kale into the recipe instead, and added it along with the sausage and lentils because it needs a little longer to cook. Also, didn't have any red-wine vinegar so skipped that. Delicious.

Very tasty and satisfying soup. I used red lentils, red onion, a mixture of half sweet and half spicy sausage, and a handful more escarole. I was a bit too lazy to remove the sausage meat from its casing, and didn't mind the outcome.

Rating: 3
Have made this a couple of times and really like it! Like others, prefer to take caseings off the sausage and find the recipe very easy to accomodate with whatever's in the pantry. Have used frozen chopped spinach as well as fresh kale or chard; usually use the grocery store variety of brown lentils, but can see using the French when available. Makes a lot, but leftovers very tasty; have added can of diced tomato when I needed to stretch the leftovers a little. Looking forward to cooler nights and making this more often in my future.

Delicious. Used chopped kale instead of the escarole due to cost difference. Used french lentils and homemade sweet chicken Italian sausage. My carnivore other half really, REALLY liked it. For the vegetarians in our family: easy. just use Italian sausage herbs and spices without meat. Also very delicious.

I love this recipe, but my boyfriend isn't as hot on it. The sausage adds great flavor to what might otherwise seem like a bland healthy soup. This is easy to make and I always add extra greens - spinach, mustard greens, or whatever else I have lying around. Great for a cold February night!

Husband who says he doesn't like lentil soup gave this good reviews. Made with chorizo instead of Italian sausage because that's what I had. Easy to prep and tastes great too. Making it again tomorrow for a family New Year's meal.

This is a great quick and hearty soup to make anytime. Changes I made: Used chicken sausage from Whole Foods to cut down on the fat; used french lentils (which needed more cooking time, around 30 min); added 1.5 extra cups of liquid broth; replaced 1 cup of water with white wine; added chopped baby spinach at the end instead of escarole. There is NO NEED to add any extra salt; in fact I would cut some of the broth and replace it with water. Other than that, it was amazingly delicious. I can't believe lentils can actually taste GOOD!

Rating: 3
This soup was really tasty. I used a package (12 ounces) of italian chicken sausage to cut down on fat; I'm sure it is not the same richness of pork sausage, but the recipe didn't suffer. I also used only 1 Tbsp. olive oil to cook the sausage and veggies.

I really liked this soup but only gave it 3 stars for 2 reasons. 1. I cooked it about twice as long as directed because, even though the lentils were done already, the soup was very thin after the directed time and benefited from reducing a bit. I think the flavor was better as a result. 2. I don't like way fresh sausages turn out when you leave the casings on and cut them. Instead, I think the presentation (and ease of consumption) is improved by taking the sausages out of the casings and cooking the meat in small pieces.

I loved the soup recipe my wife did not. The soup had a hearty flavor my wife did not find the sausage pieces appetizing with the soup. My nine-year- old daughter enjoyed the soup but would not try the sausage. I did not alter the recipe.

I loved this soup! I used the ingredients as listed but I put it together in different steps as I like my lentils to cook with all the other flavors. First saute the sausage until brown and remove from pan, add onions, carrots and celery and saute until translucent, then add garlic stir for 30 seconds, add tomato paste stir in for 30 seconds. Then add everything else (except the escarole) including reserved sausage and cook until lentils are tender. Finally finish off with the escarole step. I actually used my left-over sauteed spinich in it from dinner the night before!

This was a delicious way to use the escarole given me by a friend from her garden. I did not add celery and I used italian chicken sausage. The family loved it.

Very good, hearty soup! I made this tonight for the family and some company and we really enjoyed it. I had to keep adding more water because it was too thick, but I cooked it longer, too. I added the escarole just a few minutes before serving so that it would still have some color and freshness, and it worked really well.

I must have messed up here. I say this soup is good but not great. I don't like the taste of the browned bits in the soup and the veggies being cooked in the sausage grease.

Really really really fantastic with a few changes. I use beef broth, blasamic vinegar and green lentils. And absolutely you have to let everything simmer for a 20 or 30 minutes minimum. You almost need to ignore the times on this recipe -- use some common sense, adjust the broth/water to your liking, let it simmer for awhile and you will love this!

I made this last night for dinner - I only rated it 3 forks, because I made a few changes. I have to say, it was fantastic. As I did not have chicken broth, I substituted 16oz water and 8oz red wine. I didn't use all the water called for in the soup - probably half of that to make it more of a stew. I liked the idea of browning the sausage, so I did that and caramelized and onion and about 6 cloves of garlic as well, using red wine to saute in instead of butter or oil (Watching cal.intake) We didn't have carrots or celery handy, so I omitted. However, I did add one can of cannelini beans, and 1/2 (dry) orzo to the mix, as well as about 1/4 cup of barley I had floating around the pantry. I doubled the tomato paste, and caramelized it in the beginning as well, as well as one can of diced tomatoes in the soup. I was VERY generous with the red pepper flakes, as well as using thyme, oregano, and sage as my primary seasonings. Using a bouquet garni would also be good. Instead of croutons, I made crostini with some organic wheat bread I'd baked the day before, topped with tomatoes and Parmesan, and broiled.

Excellent, hearty soup. I added some twigs of fresh thyme to the lentils while they simmered and small bits of potato towards the end. For the sausage, I used 1/2" slices of Al Fresco Chicken Sweet Italian sausage - quite good and low-fat.

This dish took longer to cook than the recipe said that it would (I don't think that many soups, except maybe a broth, can be prepared in 45 minutes), but I still thought that it was a delicious and easy recipe. I felt that it was missing something, so I added a tiny bit of coriander (I know that sounds weird, but it worked) and a couple sprigs of fresh thyme, which helped a lot. My boyfriend absolutely hates vinegar, so I wasn't able to add it to the whole pot at the end. I added a few drops to my own bowl, and I thought that it worked nicely. I did, however, add some lemon juice to the whole pot, which also helped to round out the flavor by adding some brightness. I will certainly make this soup again. I might use beef broth next time, though.

Used sweet chicken sausage and puy lentils (which cook much faster than regular lentils) Also added a potatoe, used all chicken broth, and a hand full of Israeli couscous. Everyone liked and said I could make it again. Healthy start to the New Year.

Easy and delicious. Used fennel instead of celery and a mild spicy Itallian sausage out of the casing crumbled. Cut back on lentils and amt of liquid as I cook for two and still had leftovers. I don't see the need to cook the liquid on the side but instead added it to the pot after sauteing the vegetables and added to the final cooking time. I added red wine vinegar and grated parmasean cheese to the individual servings. A definite do again.

This recipe was really good. Like others said the sausage should be broken up more perhaps 1/2 inch pieces. The soup is a little thin but by adding 1/4 potato flour it really made it the perfect consistency (make sure to stir in as you add so you dont get lumps.

This should really be 3.5 forks, actually. Here are a few modifications I made which may be of interest. I used pre-cooked spicy italian sausage links, sliced into pieces. Since that didn't need to cook, I used a couple of slices of bacon and browned them. That became the oil that I used to cook the veggies in. I added the pieces of sausage as directed. The bacon I reserved and used as a garnish on the soup when serving. Since I shopped in a market with a more limited selection, I substituted one 9 oz. bag of pre-washed spinach for the escarole. All-in-all, a very flavorful fall soup that made a for a satisfying dinner.

I made this with turkey Italian sausage..and I don't know. When sipping the broth, I'm left wanting another level of flavor. It's certainly "good enough," but I'm not bowled over by it either. I think you'll find yourself walking over to the pot to add more salt, or more pepper...or more something...

A huge success on a cool fall day! I had Amy's Chicken Italian meatballs in the fridge and used them in place of the sausage. Also substituted leeks for onions (it's that time of year when leeks appear every single week in the CSA box! gotta use 'em!) and it was just delish!!

My mother-in-law (now deceased) used to make a lentil and escarole soup (without the sausage) and my husband enjoyed it very much. I tried this recipe, modifying it to use 1 lb of lentils (full bag), proportionately larger amounts of the other ingredients but 2 lb of Italian sausage. The soup got rave reviews from my husband. He suggests that when I make the soup again I use less sausage (~1 lb) and cut it into smaller pieces. So this recipe is a keeper in our household!

I realized as I began cooking this soup that I didn't know the difference between red and green lentils. I only had red on hand. They practically disintegrated and weren't the beautiful plump ones that I have had in other dishes. So I assume green (nonsplit) lentils is the way to go. As for the taste, I would recommend slightly smaller chunks of sausage. My version also had a lot of broth which made the croutons a soggy mess (perhaps related to using the wrong lentils). I will try again with high hopes!

I'm a big lentil soup lover but my family is not. They loved this receipe, I know the sausage was a big help. I kept the escalore hidden so my 14 yr old would not see it and once in the soup, he didnt notice and I knew that he was getting that extra bit of green!
