I followed the recipe with the exception of tying up the pork and adding more onions as suggested but wasn't that impressed in the end. The sauce was okay, but I found that the orange peel was way too overpowering. If I make this again I will zest the oranges instead of using a peeler and might brown the pork loin before roasting to get a nice crust.

I made this dish months ago and am still recalling it enough that I decided to write a review!!It was fantastic!!I can not say enough good things about it. The only bad thing about it is that blood oranges are not in season so I'll have to wait to make it again(or sub other citrus).

Fantastic! I didn't get as much color on the onions as I had wanted, so I pulled the loin out and roasted them a bit longer. I'm looking forward to adapting this recipe for grilling season.

Superb! I have made this 3 times. Subbed regular oranges, subbed more broth for the wine, used microplane zester to grate peel, used boneless pork loins that come two to a package and roasted them side by side. Increased garlic and onions. Poured reduction over all. Roasted about 25 - 30 minutes. Wonderful.

Excellent dish that I made twice, each time to rave reviews using regular oranges. I used a microplane zester to shred the orange peel and made more sauce than called for. The onions are wonderful in it. I subbed more chicken broth and more orange juice for the wine.

OMG! This was OUTSTANDING! Since I didn't have blood oranges, I substituted Tropicana Grovestand (lots of pulp) and dried orange peel. Because so many reviewers raved about the onions and the sauce, I tripled the onions and sauce ingredients. The pork was soooo moist and the sauce phenomenal. I made it for us and for a friend with a husband & 3 kids, who is incapacitated for 6 weeks due to surgery. She called to say she & her family LOVED the meal. I served it with black beans, rice, and a salad. Dessert - apple crisp. I think this will become a standard in our house.

I didn't have blood oranges, but it turned out very good. Cooked it longer than what it said.

delish and hands off. I would double the amount of onions mixture.

Absolutely WONDERFUL recipe. Definitely do not sub out the blood oranges, they make the dish sing. However, I found that I needed almost 8 oranges to get the full 3/4 cup of juice (although it was well worth the time spent squeezing) and the roast took closer to a full hour to come to temp, rather than the stated half hour. Other then that, this recipe is staying in my file for a good long time.

I kind of "gilded the lily" and used this recipe in combination with the Roast Pork with Apricot Stuffing that's also on this website. My guests absolutely flipped. The oranges and onions give such a wonderful flavor, and it married well with the apriot stuffing. I'm sure it would be delicious as is, though, without the stuffing. Will definitely make again.

I was a little nervous about this dish -- especially after the butcher and I had a long chat about whether or not I really needed to roll and tie the pork loin for this recipe -- but it was wonderful! The pork was flavorful and the onions and sauce are fabulous. I served it with the citrus salad that is mentioned in the same article and a spinach risotto and everyone raved about the entire meal.

Very good and easy. Used tangerines as that was what I has on hand-sauce was delicious and the aromatics cooked with the pork really add flavor.

I was pretty underwhelmed by this dish. I think a classic roast pork loin with garlic & fresh herbs is superior. But my sweetie liked the accompanying onions a lot.

I couldn't wait to try this recipe, and even though I had to use regular oranges, I wasn't disappointed!
