Hmmm, I really wanted to like this recipe, and I think with a few modifications, I would have. However, as is, it's a little strange. Mostly, I found the whole okra to be a little awkward. Next time I would slice them into pieces. Also, I'd use something like kielbasa instead of the turkey leg -- cutting around all the tendon and sinew was time consuming and I think the same smokey result could have been achieved more easily in a different way.

I made this for my family last night (with a side of whole wheat baked mac and cheese) and it was a hit! Not too rich for a SF Bay Area August-- warm days and chilly nights. I would never have thought to make a broth out of corn cobs (I used a smoke pork chop instead) it was delicious! Ditto on the biscuit being bland-- next time I may add a hard cheese to give it some pop. In all this dish was fantastic-- even my two year old enjoyed it).

Stew was absolutely delicious, but shortcakes were flat, dense and incredibly bland- I'm a little annoyed I wasted the last of the fresh chives from my garden on them. Dough was way too wet to knead, let alone roll out. Very unrecommended, but I'll be saving the stew as a standalone; it was the perfect chilly early-fall night's dinner for the three of us.

I really enjoyed this. I roasted a turkey leg and used that instead of a smoked leg. Very tasty, and quite rich - portions should be small!

This recipe has a lot of depth in flavor, but it is a little too rich for a summertime dish. It's a paradox, because August is when these ingredients are at their peak.

This was just too smoky for my taste and I found that the broth had such a strange smell that it made me feel sick to my stomach. Definitely won't be making it again!
