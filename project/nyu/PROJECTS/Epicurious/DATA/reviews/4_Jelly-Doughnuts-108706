Didn't quite work for me, my favourites are the one at http://jellydonut.net especially the filling...

This was my first try at doughnuts - these were the best doughnuts we have ever had. The dough was a breeze to make. I used plain lowfat kefir instead of milk. They were soft and pillowy. We made holes with the scraps and rolled them in cinnamon and sugar.

These were easy and delicious! I brought them to a Chanukah dinner. I'm not Jewish, but my friends said they tasted just like the traditional ones. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and an extra Tb of sugar. The batter was not too sweet, so the jelly filling and toppings round it out well (we topped some with powdered sugar and some with sugar and cinnamon). I first rolled the dough a little thin - probably 1/4" - and then rerolled the scraps around 1/2" thick (as suggested in the recipe). Both batches came out delicious. The thinner dough simply led to smaller, crisper donuts; the thicker dough resulted in larger, doughier donuts. The hardest part was constantly monitoring the oil temperature - as it fluctuated (and as my doughnut size fluctuated), so did cook time. Cook time ranged from 1:15 to 2:00 per doughnut (although 2 minutes was the really the max and only when my oil got too cool). YUM!

These were delicious! We substituted buttermilk for the milk which added some flavor. They were not very sweet so adding a bit more sugar makes them tastier. We also thought that adding some vanilla to the dough next time might be nice. We think 2 tsp of jam is a better amount. Enjoy!

This recipes needs more flavor. Even when i filled them with apple filling, and rolled them in cinnamon & sugar they did not blow me away. The dough should have had some sort of citrus flavor, or even a hint of spice. A plus for this recipe is that they are pretty easy to produce, and have a very soft and fluffy texture. Hence I give it two forks

These were amazing! We made them for Hanukkah and were blown away. I didn't think it was possible to make such good doughnuts at home. The dough was simple and easy to work with. I dipped the doughnuts in a simple powdered sugar glaze after they had cooled a bit instead of dusting with sugar, only because that is what we prefer. Delicious!

Wow! These are fantastic and Krispy Kreme will never EVER compare!!! I served them right out of the oil and topped with a dollop of butter cream icing on each. I recommend cherry jam, it worked for me for excellent flavor. The time it takes to make these is totally worth it.

Awesome. These were the best doughnuts I've ever had. Next time I might try them with buttermilk to make them even better. The were definitely at their peak the day they were made, the leftovers weren't as good as the first day. I made half apricot, half cherry and glazed them with almond flavored icing. Amazing. Best Krapfen ever.

The best homemade doughnuts one can make. I added glazing by mixing icing sugar, vanilla essence, and water. So big, so rich, and so delicious!

This is a GREAT recipie, I call them Fastnachts...for those of you who are too shy to say "Krapfen". These are eaten by Germanic people before Lent begins thus the name "Fastnacht". It is always so difficult to find good recipies on the internet for German and Austrian desserts, if you like Viennese pastry, this is a must!

My mom used to make doughnuts with my sister and I when we were little. It's a challenge to improve on those excellent memories, but these are definitely worth making! Very cute and not as difficult as you'd think. The extra step, cutting twice to trim, is worth it for perfectly formed little doughnuts. I made raspberry ones for a picnic and strawberry for a brunch...everyone loved them (though no one asked for the recipe...most couldn't believe someone would be crazy enough to make jelly doughnuts from scratch.) I didn't have exact cutters, so used a juice glass for the larger rounds; they looked great and rose fine. Best if eaten within a few hours.

Krapfen, were these good! After frying, try rolling them in cinnamon-sugar. They are best eaten right away, while still hot. Worth the effort.

First of all, any excuse to make a dish named "Krapfen" and announce to your guests that "the Krapfen is ready" or "Come and get the Krapfen" is worth it, but besides the name, the recipe is great, such a crowd pleaser, I used two jams, a home made apricot and also a boysenberry then quartered them and dusted heavily, and I mean heavily, it really helps since the dough is not too sweet, to serve...drove people wild, they hovered over the fryer waiting for the next batch to arrive...KRAPFEN!

These were fantastic. I made them for a doughnut and cider party on a Saturday night. I followed the recipe exactly and used homemade raspberry jam, but I did glaze them at the end instead of using a sprinkle of powdered sugar. They were so delicious I only got one because everyone ate them, so I made them again the next day! They aren't as hard as they seem and the instructions were great. Try them!
