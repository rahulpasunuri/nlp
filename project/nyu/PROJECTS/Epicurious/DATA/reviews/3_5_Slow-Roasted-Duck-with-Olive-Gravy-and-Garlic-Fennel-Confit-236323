One reviewer's duck was obviously tooo big, and apparently my duck was tooo small--make sure your duck is juuuust right. I couldn't come close to getting all the veggies in the cavity, there was nothing but fat in the pan (which didn't really bother me--it made a nice sauce in the end), and it seemed a bit overcooked even though my duck was 4 1/2 pounds. But, when all was said and done we enjoyed it, I'm just not sure I want to fiddle with the recipe to get it just right.

We really enjoyed this dish. We took the veggies in the pan and diced them and added them to our side dish of rice. We deglazed the pan with wine which made the gravy thinner. We will definitely make it again with the few modifications mentioned. Very easy and very delicious.

We made this for Thanksgiving 2006 and it was excellent, especially the gravy.

the slow and low cooking technique was fine, but the rest of the recipe was really flawed. I did one large 9 lb duck instead of 2 smaller ducks, and the skin was still crisp and the meat very tender. I did use the convection feature of my oven for the last hour to insure a brown bird. Problems: The fennel, garlic and shallots in the cavities never really cooked and remained pretty crunchy despite 5 hours of cooking. There wasn't much in the way of pan drippings beside grease (which the recipe says to skim off and save for another use) so the "olive gravy" was more like a very thick paste, almost tapanade. I add some chicken stock to thin out, but it was still really thick, and not very appeitizing in texture or appearance, but it did taste nice. This recipe is NOT a keeper.
