I'm somewhat of a novice cook, but managed to follow this recipe as instructed with a pretty good result. The flavors of the base ingredients are good, but I found the dish, overall, rather bland. If you review the ingredients, you'll notice that there are few seasonings. I think simply using regular stock instead of sodium-free, would be a big help.

Very good recipe and lends itself well to modifications. I added green lentils instead of rice. I did have to boil the lentils separately for about 20 minutes to ensure they would be done. Delicious, hearty, comforting. I will be making this again!

This was wonderful - my first try included a few modifications: kale only, combination of sausage and lean ground turkey, penne instead of shells & no rice. I loved the textures of the barley and pasta and will make this again with added spinach.

This is a great recipe, but I made a few changes. I wanted to use only whole grains, so I boiled brown rice and regular pearl barley for approx 25 mins, then drained and used as recipe instructs. Also used whole wheat pasta. Used red chard, spinach and some kale from my garden. Added some sliced mushrooms and shallots to the sausage and splashed some white wine in too. Super yummy, hearty and healthy!

This is what I am calling whole grain comfort food. Prep time was minimal. I used only spinach because that is what I had but think you could use just about any green you like... perfect winter nights.

This is a very forgiving recipe. I used Italian chicken sausage although I'm pretty sure the recipe was written for pork sausage, and had to substitute kale for the escarole. I also added a can of white beans as some versions of this dish call for them. Everyone loved it. The servings are very generous-- this recipe easily serves 6 normal, not overweight eaters.

This sounded a bit different, and the previous favorable reviews were right on: it's great! It is healthy, and reheats well. The only thing I will change for next time is to add the pasta later in the cooking: it got a bit too soggy for my taste by the time the barley and rice were done. I also used red chard instead of spinach, and kept the sausages whole during browning and then cut them into chunks. This helped a bit with the "visually appealing" problem, I think.

Just right for a family dinner on a cold winter night. I used a 6-oz bag of baby spinach and substituted a can of Trader Joe's Tuscan Beans for the sausage. I stirred at 30 min, added about 1/2 cup more broth, baked it for an additional 10 minutes, and served with a choice of parmsesan or feta cheese. Yum - we ate it all!

Wonderful--reminded me of the rustic cooking we encountered in the Italian countryside. My only regret is that it isn't more visually appealing (especially on the second day; it turns pretty gray--but still delicious!)

Great winter food. I cooked this on stove top and it worked out perfect. I used spicy sausage. Very nice dish.

Excellent dish,I served this to guests. I didn't bother with the cheese.

What an easy, tasty dish. I used hot sausage and just spinach sinec I didn't have any escarole. (I used close to a bag and a half of baby spinach and might be tempted to use more next time. I also added a cheese rind and used more broth mixed with water. We left for church and returned to a delicious winter meal. Make sure you have a nice bread to sop up the broth. It's a keeper when we don't have leftovers and my picky 13 year old enjoys it.

This dish was very satisfying -- imagine chicken noodle soup in solid form. I am a vegetarian, and I have been looking for ways to use barley, other than in the usual barley soup. I prepared this recipe with a sausage substitute called Gimme Lean by Litelife and vegetable broth. This also drastically decreases the calories and the fat. (BTW: The nutritional information listed below the recipe seems way off. 2 oz Johnsonville sausage has 14 g fat and 0.5 T oil has 7 g fat. The calories seem too high as well -- seems like it should be closer to 400 w/out cheese.) Of course, the fake sausage isn't quite as good as the real thing -- but this dish is a great comfort food even with my substitutions. The parmesan cheese is a must. I had some trouble getting the rice to cook with the amount of liquid and in the amount of time shown. I needed about 5 c of broth and about 1 h. I just kept a pot of the broth on the stove and added more boiling liquid when neccesary. Next time I will increase the amount of spinach and escarole, as they get wilted down to almost nothing during cooking.

I really liked this dish, it was very tasty and *healthy*, the greens/grains combo was surprisingly delicious. I've been looking for ways to combine veggies with brown rice and whole grains in ways that don't result in bland moosh. I did alter the recipe a bit. I added some crimini mushrooms, white wine and shallots for extra flavor, didn't need the chicken broth.

Very surprised at how delicious this was. It seems like an unlikely mix, but it was a hit. Easy to make, pretty to look at. It's in the permanent file.
