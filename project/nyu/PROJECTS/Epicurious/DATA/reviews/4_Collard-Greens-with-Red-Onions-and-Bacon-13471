I adapted this recipe for one bunch of collards. Used as much bacon as seemed doable for two people, one small onion, 1/2 cup chicken broth, 1T cider vinegar, 1/2T brown sugar. Poured out some of the bacon fat to cook onions. It's hard for me to watch greens go from bright to brownish, and can't imagine cooking them for an hour. Instead I simmered the collards with lid on for maybe 10 minutes, added the onion in, turned up the heat and stirred until the broth had almost completely evaporated, added the bacon back in. It was pretty durn delish.

Made this for the first time on Sunday. I halved the recipe and it was a perfect amount for a family of 4. I also did half collard and half mustard greens, only 1 onion, and 4 cloves of garlic. I needed to boil the greens a while longer, 2 hours total. My wife could taste the sweetness from the brown sugar. It wasn't overwhelming but suggested only 1/2 tbs instead of 1 tbs next time. These are good greens and I will absolutely make them again.

I love this recipe, it is the perfect method for preparing collard greens. I do it this way every year for New Year's Day and they get better every time. My mom is from the south and this is the flavor I remember, and I appreciate it now more than I ever did growing up- I used to think they stunk up the house when I was a kid, but it's the most wonderful smell in the world to me now!

Absolutely delicious! I made this with an assortment of local winter greens, including collards, mustard greens, and swiss chard. Mine were plenty cooked within 10 minutes, but they were younger and probably a bit more tender than the collards in the recipe.

yum! i used more chicken broth respectively and kept adding as it simmered off. delicious!

I have made this recipe many times. I use Turkey bacon instead of full fat bacon and it has great taste. I even have made it without any bacon (I was out at the time) and actually perfer it that way. It's a family favorite for collards.

These collards are no fail. My Southern husband loves them!! I use Neuske bacon only and the taste is outstanding, They are a New Years Day standard.

This recipe is always good. Don't feel like you need to follow it exactly. I've substituted beet greens and kale for collards. I've also worked with less onions, yellow onions, and pancetta rather than bacon. Just keep the method in line with the recipe and you are golden.

Great recipe. I think people should be aware that collard greens have a very strong flavor. I was raised on turnip greens (love 'em!), and still prefer them. But I am sure that this is the best recipe for collard greens. (My advice- don't skimp on the bacon...)

I recently became a fan of cooked greens such as Swiss Chard and Turnip Greens due to our amazing local organic produce stand. This recipe took the full hour as described but was well worth it. I cut the recipe in half and used red wine vinegar. I recommend serving this dish with either sweet barbeque ribs or blackened salmon accompanied by cornbread, of course. Fabulous!

I make collards weekly, but only steamed. This was really good. I couldn't get over the fact these greens simmer for an hour; I was boggled by that. I thought for sure they would be mushy, but they were divine. The greens turned out flavorful and didn't taste like they were overloaded with seasoning. We made this for 13 people today for a dinner with great success.

These were incredibly delicous. I doubled the recipe and also left out the bacon (curse you vegetarian fiance!) but it was really REALLY good. I love collard greens but I had never made them before and these were just as good as any I have ever had in a restaurant (and better than a lot of them!). One thing I would warn you about are the red pepper flakes, i put more in than the recipe called for and I had to add a bit of balsamic vinegar to bring the heat back under control. I also added a bit of fresh garlic at about halfway through and it was delicious! This was an side dish for beer butt chicken and it was a great combination!

(When I said I had, "reduced the recipe," I meant I cut the recipe in half because I didn't have 4 pounds of collard greens!!!)

This recipe is exceptional. I skipped the bacon and reduced the amounts of everything. The sugar really cuts the bitterness without being over powering. I added a little more red pepper flakes. Although a bit time consuming, well worth it.

This recipe is so unbelievably good. I have made this a few times and tried out a few variations: 1. Red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar (I actually prefer this variation, but I'm sure any kind of vinegar will work perfectly well) 2. Reducing the amount of brown sugar (I *do not* recommend this if this is your first time making the recipe: the brown sugar seems to have a tenderizing effect on the collard greens, and when omitted, the coarser stems and ribs are much tougher -- not to mention, the sugar is a great compliment to the acidity of the vinegar) 3. Doubling the chicken broth, vinegar, and pepper flakes with a pinch of extra brown sugar (The more potlikka the better! This does give the collards a slightly more 'stewed' texture, but if you're serving with cornbread you'll want a little more liquid than this recipe will produce) 4. Brown onions when I didn't have the red ones (no significant difference, so no need to make a run to the store if you've already got regular onions in your pantry) But all that said, the recipe as written is fantastic.

Rating: 4
This is delicious. I would recommend reducing the sugar, especially if there's added sugar in your vinegar. Otherwise the sugar dominates. Personally, I used only 1/3 of the sugar called for here. On another note: 8 servings is extremely optimistic; 1/8 of this recipe is really just a taste. I once ate half a recipe of this as an entree size portion (for 1 person). Count on serving four generously or six sparingly with this recipe.

Make sure your pot lid is on very tight, and foil it if you have to--I didn't notice the steam escaping from mine, and the bottom burned in spots. STILL delicious, even then.

This was delicious and buttery. Perfect! I used shallots, because I had them on hand. Much better than ham hock greens. I will make this everytime I cook Southern. I made fried fish and biscuits to go with greens.

We absolutely loved this recipe! I make recipes from this site all the time, and have never gone back to comment on any of them, but this one deserves the time. It is super easy and delicious! My boyfriend is from the south and thinks these are as authentic as it gets. This is a very easy, yummy side for a number of dishes. I only do the recipe by half (for two people) and it works perfect!

I made half the recipe with only a couple of adjustments, finding the instructions useful for someone relatively new to Southern cooking. I would advise a more generous hand with the red chili flakes, though it is easy enough to use hot sauce at the table. I eliminated the brown sugar and instead added 1/2 cup of unfiltered apple cider while also increasing the amount of chicken stock. The extra liquid was not only welcome "pot likker", it seemed necessary even in a heavy enameled cast iron pot. I ended up increasing cooking time, too, though not to the point of dissolving the leaves into a silken dew. If you like truly flavorful dishes, I might amp up the vinegar, too, though just by a little.

Rating: 4
Fantastic. I served this recipe to a hard core Southern collards enthusiast who was astonished. I found just a bit more salt was needed and I agree with another cook about advised a longer cooking time - makes it even more authentic.

Looking for the ultimate "greens" recipe to add to my soul food collection. This was it! I doubled the liquid to make sure there was enough pot liquor to go with the cornbread. I decrease the sugar just a tad but it is still needed to take the bitter taste out of the greens. Wonderful recipe!!! If you've never had or cooked greens before, this is the best representation of if.

I did not have everything needed (the amounts, I did have the essential ingredients) to make this recipe as it is written yet it was still fantastic. It always surprises me how long it takes to cook collard greens but the work was definitely worth it!

Let me start by saying I have never made, nor eaten, collard greens before. My husband, who does not collard greens, thought these were good and thinks I'm crazy, but I actually could not even stay in the kitchen while they cooked because of the stench! I thought they smelled like a farm-ugh! And I LOVE all vegetables--seriously. But these stink so badly, I had to hold my nose to eat to taste them. Never, never again.

Rating: 4
These are some of the best collard greens I have ever eaten! I can barely cook and the recipe was very descriptive. They turned out fantastic! The only problem was that it took longer to cook than I thought. Allow about an hour and a half in all, and start the bacon right away. I can't wait for an excuse to make these again.

Rating: 4
I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it three times, and everyone goes nuts about it every time. It is totally make ahead - it gets better as it sits in the fridge. Just reheat and let it sit on the stove as long as you need it to, it's totally forgiving. I added a little more red pepper flakes, used a little less sugar. I also strongly recommend undercooking the bacon the first go round so that when you add it back in, it doesn't overcook.

Amazing as written - even though I grew up in the very deep south, I had never really loved collards. I prepared this dish as a New Year's buffet with Hoppin' John and rice, country ham, garlic cheese grits and biscuits. All loved it, except for my (very picky and unwilling to try) step-mother-in-law and her daughter. The only slight changes that I made were to eyeball the majority of the ingedients - just my way -, 12 oz. bacon with it all added back in, 1 1\2 really large red onions and fewer collards. Then cooked for the last 15 mins. or so with the lid off and at a higher heat to evaporate some of the liquid. They were amazing - esp. considering that they were the only "veg" at my table and I usually have at least 2 options.

Having never eaten collard greens nor has my family, I made this yesterday, 12-01-2005 and it was a hit. Everyone loved it. I served it along with Hoppin John, cornbread, cottage cheese fixed with red and green peppers and sweet onions. The meal was a huge success.

Tried this recipe after several failed attempts at collards. Nice recipe. Was a little unsure, but after sitting for a day, they were great. Only thing is that it did not produce enough pot likka for my taste. I would increase the amount of broth.

Did a slapdash, on-the-fly adaptation of this -- 2 small mild yellow onions; 1 lb collards/mustard mix; turkey bacon helped along with a bit of olive oil; wine vinegar sted cider; 4 crushed red japanese peppers; best guesses on chicken broth & brown sugar. It was great! Served it with hickory smoked pork chops & was the hero of the hour on the home front.

This is a great dish; I made it for a "southern dinner party" and all my guests loved it. But I put a little twist on it; I'm vegetarian, so are many of my friends (or they don't eat pork)so I substituted "Vegi-bacon". -Not bacos, but rather the Morning Star variety. I sliced the vegi-bacon into 1 inch sections, sauted in butter with a pinch of salt, then added the cooked "bacon" to the dish as directed. It was a huge hit, and I'll make it again. Even the biggest meat-eater in our group loved it --and couldn't tell the difference! :)

Yee-haw! I cut down the sugar a bit (I like my greens with bite) and this was just fabulous. If I were making it for company, I'd probably make it the night before, though, as it's good on the first night but extraordinary after a night in the fridge. Yum!

I've made greens a couple of times, but got luke warm reception from the family. These however, were outstanding. I cut the onions down about half based on other comments, and used 1/4 lb. prosciutto & a couple of tbls. olive oil in place of the bacon. We will be eating greens more often than just New Years, now that I've found this recipe!

Good but not the best greens I've ever eaten. My favorite way to cook them is to saute an onion in a nonstick pan, then add the greens, chicken broth, a can of tomatoes and some chiles. Simmer for 45 minutes or more.

Most yankees don't have the first clue what collards are or how to prepare them. I was at a eating establishment in Georgia once and someone asked me to pass the spinach! DUH!!!I grow my own collards and use this recipe all the time...It also works well with frozen collards. I omit the pepper flakes because I like my collard greens sweet/sour, not hot. This recipe also works well with mustard greens and kale.

This was my first attempt at cooking these frightening-looking greens.

Wow! Had a 1 lb. bag of frozen chopped collards I bought while feeling nutritionally virtuous and was not looking forward to them. Found this recipe and tried it. Originally cut all other ingreds. in half. Ended up using more broth, vinegar, and brown sugar, since the frozen stuff wasn't as "juicy" as fresh would have been. Also used a sweet onion since I didn't have red, and added seasoned Rice Vinegar toward the end when I decided I needed more zing. I can only imagine how good it'll be with fresh, which I plan to do soon. My southern-born and bred husband loved it!

Well! I must say I impressed myself! This transplanted Yankee decided to do the Southern traditions for New Year's Day 2001. I've never made collard greens, and have only eaten them once, at Bacchanalia (which is THE finest restaurant in Atlanta, so there's a lot of expectatation built in!) I made this recipe today, to be served tomorrow over college bowl games with a pork roast, Hoppin' John and sauerkraut. Today's preview taste was wonderful! Can't wait to reheat these greens tomorrow for my Yankee friends!
