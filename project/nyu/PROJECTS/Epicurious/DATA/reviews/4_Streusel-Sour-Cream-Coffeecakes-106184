Holy Cow! these are awesome, easy to make, and have no preservative aftertaste whatsoever! I made them with plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and served them as muffins instead of a large cake. So good!

These were fantastic! Very easy to make. I have to admit, I didn't have pecans, which I'm sure would have been even better. I used almonds in the topping, and they worked really well. And I used plain yogurt because I had no sour cream; no complaints here. My family loved them! They freeze well too! Don't leave out the orange zest; it adds that interesting little "hmm, what's that?" !!

This was a great recipe. I didn't have sour cream, but it's really great with plain yogurt. I also couldn't help adding some nutmeg with the cinnamon. Delicious! It made seventeen for me, not 18, but I filled them a little too full. Definitely a hit with my family. The orange zest was a great touch.

You may think you have too much streusel topping, but definitely use them all. Great recipe. Not too sweet.

These came out "funky". I didn't like the texture of the muffin and the topping was too much pecan and not enough crumble. It is possible that using baking spray on the muffin tins instead of butter was the culprit.

I put streusel in between layers of batter, and ultimately it didn't matter since you couldn't tell...but they were yummy and looked great too- Baked them in my stoneware muffin pan from The Pampered Chef! Love it!

I currently only have a toaster oven and a rectangular pirex that fits into it to do ALL my baking. Thus, I was a bit nervous about this one. It took forever to bake and then bit got a bit too dark so I was really worried... I just woke up to cut myself a piece for breakfast. Amazing!!! SO very good. I rarely rate things as four forks. This one definitely deserves it. I had to use walnuts because I couldn't find pecans and I probably added a bit more orange zest than indicated. Delish!

Easy and very, very good. Freeze well too, in the unlikely event that any are left!

Is this really only 6 servings? I'd like to make for a big brunch, and 24 muffins sounds like 24 servings, not 6. Thanks!

this was a little bit more work than I expected but well worth it. Mixing the dough with bare hands was fun. This would be a fun one to make with older kids, like 12 or so. One of my guests even asked for the recipe.

Excellent! Didn't have an orange to zest so used 1 tsp of orange extract instead and it had a nice subtle flavor. Had several requests for the recipe. Very easy and tasty!

These were really good, especially with the streusel in the middle and on top.

This was so good. Followed recipe exactly except for using bottled orange peel because I did not have any oranges. The coffeecakes were moist and delicious.

This was a great Saturday morning treat! I made it without modification except for substituting chocolate chunks for the chopped nuts. I also made half into mini muffins and the other half into regular size ones and they all disappeared.

These are great! Definitely time consuming and a bit of a pain to make, but they are delicious. I made them for our New Year's Day brunch and they were a hit - definitely a nice holiday treat.

I realize I am in the minority here, but I thought these were awful. They were the greasiest muffins I have ever made - - when I took them out of the muffin tin there were actually puddles of melted butter in the tin! The flavor of the orange zest was overwhelming and oddly out of place.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! I added chopped ripe pears and omitted the orange peel (didn't have any.)I made regular size muffins and mini muffins and had to bake the mini muffins for about 14 minutes. Everyone loves them and they were so moist!

Rating: 3
Used a Cuisinart to cut in the butter and it was so easy. Will use freshly diced pear next time in the batter.

These got rave reviews from all. I followed the recipe with no modifications, It really is great. I like the idea one previous reviewer suggested of putting a layer of streusel in the middle of the cakes, I'll try that next time. This is a keeper.

I made this in the springform pan and baked it for 45 minutes only at 350, and it was definitely done--I will bake it a few minutes less next time. I liked it, but I probably would have loved it if the crust hadn't been dry--the inside was super-moist.

These were the best muffins I've ever made! My dough was a little too stiff so I added just a few tablespoons of buttermilk to thin it a bit. Next time I might put a layer of the streusel topping the the middle of the muffins rather than just on top.

I took these muffins to a family get-together and they were devoured! Everyone loved them. I would make them again in muffin form as well as one large cake using my springform pan.

These are scrumptions! The only pain is blending the cold butter in - - but it's all worth it!

These "muffins" were terrific, and so easy to make. Everyone loved them. I sprinkled a few white chocolate chips in the batter, and it was great. I used sea salt for the salt, which broke up the sweetness with a small salt bit on your tounge. I will make these again.

FANTASTIC! I loved the idea of single serving coffee cakes. I doubled the amount of orange zest. Rave reviews by all.

I made this as a coffecake in a springform pan. I thought it was delicious and it kept very well for several days without drying out. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was DELICIOUS. I had just gotten some fresh peaches, so I cooked and added them to the batter. It was the best coffee cake I had ever had. Very moist and the topping was yummy. I made it in a spring form pan as one big coffee cake rather than mini cakes, and I will definitely make it again.

Delicious! Large cut nuts, cinammon chips inside baked better in a springform pan. I am a professional baker and it was wonderful. Do not use "light ingredients at all." Always can add fruit, etc. to batter and even ice a bit. Thanks.

Has anyone made this recipe a day ahead? I would like to ease preparation Easter morning by making the coffeecakes the night before, but only if they reheat well and taste close to just baked. Thanks!

These muffins are absolutely wonderful. My office went crazy for them! I used a Cuisinart, which cut down on the mess. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is a very good recipe. My husband does not eat sweets and he ate these every morning until they were gone.Easy recipe to make. Using a pastry cutter helps keep the fingers clean.

One word--WOW. I wouldn't change anything about this recipe. Managed to squeak out an extra cupcake. And I wouldn't make a bigger cake--regular cupcake size is just fine. This is SO delicious, and used a mixture of pecans and walnuts--didn't make a difference. Still delicious hours later as well. Fabulous.

These were good but very messy to make.My hands were covered with the dough and goopy mess for most of the time. They tasted good; everyone in my office loved them, but I think I've made better coffeecakes before. I like the fact that they're muffin size; less messy that way! I'd make them again, though.

The reasons I didn't give this recipe four forks are few and small. I would have prefered larger cakes, so I'll be using the previous reviewers suggestions. Also,I would use more and best quality vanilla along with more orange peel, just to enhance the flavor. Just a couple of hints, while the pecan topping was successful, it certainly wasn't crumbly during preparation. I only had 16 muffins and that was stretching the batter, so plan accordingly.

Out of this world. Wow. Talk about an ease recipe and a wonderful taste sensation. The orange zest is a wonderful addition to this recipe. I used broken pecan pieces instead of chopped. The taste of toasted pecans in the topping is truely undescribeable. I used deep muffin tins and made 12 large muffins rather than using the traditional shallow pans. Cooking time was increased by approx. 6 minutes.
