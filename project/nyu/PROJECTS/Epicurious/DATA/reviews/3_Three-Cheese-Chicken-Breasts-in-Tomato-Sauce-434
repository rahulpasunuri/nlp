This recipe is going into my regular rotation. A+ in my book. I didn't have any stewed tomatoes so I made it without and it was delicious. I also added lots of basil and Italian seasoning. Hubby loved it too, which says a lot!

I LOVE this recipe. For my family, this is a treat. We do change it up a bit however by using linguine instead of penne, doubling the ingredients for the sauce, and adding a five cheese blend sprinkled with a little Parmesan. Total crowd pleaser. I have even taken this to work for potlucks and they always request that I make it again.

Been making this for years. It's a light sauce with wondeful flavor. I use tons of fresh herbs and imported aged cheeses (makes a big taste difference)

I made this for 2. After reading reviews I doctored it up a little. I used 2 chicken cutlets (9 ounce total); one 8-ounce can tomato sauce; full can of Italian style tomatoes; 2 tablespoons tomato paste; 4 ounces of whole wheat penne pasta; and a splash of red wine. I omitted the white wine and used the full quantities of the other ingredients except the cheese. I put the cooked penne in the casserole; dipped the sauteed chicken cutlets in the sauce and put on top of the penne; divided the sauce 2/3 and 1/3. I used a little more than half the cheese called for and put half in 2/3 the sauce and poured over the chicken and pasta. I topped with about 1/4 cup of chopped basil and the topped with the remaining cheese. I baked until bubbly, about 20 minutes and served. There was a lot of sauce but had I not used the amount that I did the pasta would have been dry. 1/3 of the sauce was meant to be passed but wasn't needed.

I have made this recipe twice now and I think that if you're an experienced cook, common sense would allow that it does need extra seasoning.That does not make this a terrible recipe though. In fact, we love this dish. It's easy to make. I do use bone in chicken breast and serve the chicken aside the penne with sauce. Bone in just has much better flavor.

I am starting to be concerned that the keywords "kid-friendly" is actually code words for "really quite bland". This is acceptable for what it is, being standard weekday fare, as is indicated by another of the tags. Made largely as written, although I decided to throw caution to the wind and use a full medium onion rather than half a large one, and I added basil. The result was a fairly runny mess with undercooked chicken (had to do a post-cooking nuke - never chic). So, advice is, if you make this, spice it up a bit unless you are dealing with delicate palates, maybe add some tomato paste to thicken it up more, and cook the beast for 30 mins in the oven rather than 20. Or use a different recipe, as I will in the future.

tender and juicy chicken baked with tomatoes and sauce was delicious. never bake chicken like that. but will from now on. hmm hmm

I used Bertolli marinara sauce instead of what was suggested. And I added about a tablespoon of sugar to the sauce while it was simmering to cut the acidity. Try marinating the chicken breasts at least a couple of hours before you cook them. I used some chicken I'd been marinating for about 24 hours w/ cayenne pepper, thyme, lemon pepper, and Tony's seasoning (like Old Bay but much much better). But that's just what I like, use whatever seasonings you want, make it your dish. That's what cooking's all about, right? And instead of cooking the chicken first and putting it to the side, just add the onions and garlic first with the olive oil and cook the chicken with them. Then add everything else. When the sauce simmers, the flavors from the chicken really give it that extra kick. I'd use this recipe as a base again and play with the seasonings each time, maybe add some different meat and/or veggies.

Very easy to make my family love it. all three cheeses definitely make the dish. Consider adding extra seasoning to your chx and the sauce. Overall pretty good w/extra seasoning.

This was just ok. Made a much better chicken parm recipe from the martha stewart site. I did pound the chicken and dredged it in bread crumbs and the taste was fine but not exciting. Won't make again.

This dish was an excellent easy meal. We made it with cheese raviolli. The sauce needed more seasoning so we added fresh rosemary and basil.

Delicious, easy and flavorful. A real winner!

This is better with pounded chicken cutlets (using full-sized breasts are too chewy and more meat than necessary). I used fire roasted stewed tomatoes, added shallots to onions, a little extra wine, fresh mozzarella with the asiago and parmesan - all of this made the dish really flavorful and crowd pleasing even for kids. The dish never bubbled - even after 35 minutes - but it was still moist.

Rating: 1
The children reluctqntly ate this after scraping off as much of the sauce as possible. I think there was too much oregano. The chicken took longer to cook than 20 Min (using a meat thermometer) and ended up tough. Way too much effort to produce this sort of chicken cacciatore.

This was good initially, and even better as leftovers, if that makes sense. My husband just asked for it again. NS

This was super easy and very good. I reduced it to only 2 breasts. It freezes well too. Unless you have a top notch mozerella, don't use it. It was wonderful with just 2 chesses.

I have made this three times now and it is always very popular. It is easy, yet creative. It also travels well. If you have to go to a pot luck, this is a great option. My only suggestion is to cut the Chicken breasts in half as the serving size seemed large. People can always get more--which most do as it is so good!

my wife requested this dish again. that is quite a compliment to the recipe. i use crushed tomatoes since she basically dislikes anything that looks like a real tomato.

I marinated breasts in balsamic vinegar for 6 hours and then flattened and coated breasts in corn flake crumbs; combined penne and flat egg noodles; had no mozzarella, used fresh goat cheese instead; also, used red wine on hand-not white; used marinara sause and cut up on hand tomato. Other than that, I followed the recipe and we really liked it, a lot!

Rating: 3
Very good flavor, and relatively quick. I doubled the quantity of pasta to be sure that everyone had enough. Also, I had to increase the bake time by 30 minutes to thoroughly cook the chicken (that's in addition to the 20 the recipe called for). Even the kids liked it.

Rating: 2
It was good, but I think the oregeno was too over powering. The idea of the dish is great but the sause needs something different. I'd make it again with my own twist.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I actually changed it a little. I put the chicken over Tortolini stuffed with pesto and used an already packaged shredded cheese pack that had 6 cheeses in it.

Since I'm still a "novice" cook, this is an easy, tasty, and good-looking dish I can make for my kids and company, too. I agree that at first it was a bit bland, but in subsequent tries, I have added a bit more oregano as well as salt and pepper.

This is a decent dish. I agree with the other reviewer, pound the chicken out first. I also like to add red pepper flakes and use the best quality cheeses you can to get maximum flavor.

A good basic recipe but nothing special - I'll stick to my Cacciatore from the Betty Crocker International Cookbook when we are hungry for Italian style chicken

This looked delicious but did not taste that great. Overall, the chicken was very bland. It was easy to make so I thought I could try marinating the chicken in Italian dressing next time.

I've made this recipe several times. My husband loves it. Last time I cut up chicken breasts and browned them before adding them to the recipe. I stirred all of it together and topped with fresh parmesan, ricotta and mozzarella. I also don't use the stewed tomatoes, the kids won't eat it if it looks like a tomato. I use tomato puree, and always double the sauce and pasta. It's one recipe that the whole family eats without complaining.

I think it's a great sauce that can be easily spiced up and more made of it to so that more pasta can be added. I made it for a group of 7 and they loved it! I am making it again tonight!

You can't go too wrong with Chicken, Tomato Sauce and Cheese, but this recipe is nothing special. Its a poor man's chicken parm. I completely agree with the reviewer who wrote that the sauce was bland and the portion of pasta a bit skimpy. If you make this recipe, spice it up!

Rating: 1
The recipe was okay, but the tomato sauce is a little bland and the pasta a little skimpy. I'd use my own sauce recipe that has a better flavor. For pasta, chicken and cheese it's okay. I'd definitely use a Tuscan olive oil.

Loved it, and so did everyone in the family, even our children (2 and 6). Used pinot grigio for the wine and it was marvelous.

My wife will definitely make me make this one again.

I loved this recipe. It was so easy and quick. I cut back on the olive oil by 2 Tbsps with no difference, and didn't butter the pan. I thought this would be nice as a pot luck casserole with the chicken cut into stir fry type strips. My husband who is fussy even loved it.

I made this dish last night, and really enjoyed it. I took the advice of some of the other viewers and used the Sargento 6-cheese blend, and it was very good.

First time trying chicken parmesagn. Loved it. Sauce wasn't too complicated, but had a great homemade taste. Loved the idea of the pasta on the bottom- no need for another side dish. Every last piece of this one was eaten. Only suggestion is to make sure the chicken itself is seasoned well, also.
