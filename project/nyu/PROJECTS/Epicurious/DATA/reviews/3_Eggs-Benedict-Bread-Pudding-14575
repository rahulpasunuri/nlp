Great idea....but not worth the effort. It was pretty blah.

Really lovely, light and yummy! Nice to have a recipe that you can prep the night before and pop in the oven in the morning while making time for guests. However, timing wise that is not exactly how it worked out. I only give positive reviews to recipes I make changes to. I love reading the reviews and picking and choosing the alterations. So, here goes. I chose to use sauteed spinach (a 10 oz bag of salad) with garlic and shallots in place of the broccoli and I did this the night before I was to serve. I grated the cheese the night before, too. I did dry out the english muffins but it ended up being almost 24 hours. I did not assemble this the night before as intended. Since the muffins were so dry (and I did not have time for the custard to soak overnight) I cut the bottoms into 1 pieces for the base layer. I chopped the Canadian bacon but did not saute. I did not use hard boiled eggs, I cracked 6 raw eggs over my spinach and poked a knife through the yolk. I doubled the lemon juice in the custard and added a couple of pinches of fresh nutmeg. I chopped the muffin tops into tiny pieces and tossed it with melted butter to sprinkle over the top of the casserole (again, I did not have the time for the custard to soak into the top and thought it would be much easier to cut to serve). I only let it sit in the refrigerator for an hour before baking. I baked covered for 30 minutes, uncovered for 10 minutes (crisped the top a bit - a good thing) for my casserole to be done. Let it sit for 10 minutes before serving. I bet asparagus would be awesome - when it is fresh, in season and affordable. Definitely, saving this one.

I liked the idea, but I didnt like the broiccili with it (and I'm not a broccoli hater). I would make it again, but would do it with spinach or chard, by blanching, squeezing out excess water, coarsely chopping it and then using it as per the recipe in place of broccoli

I have made this quite a few times and have changed it every time. Now, I think I have made it to perfection. I followed the advice of so many before me and did the following: I did NOT use hard boiled eggs; added extra eggs to the custard, I used asparagus instead of broccoli and added extra lemon juice and because I doubled the recipe, baked it 45 min. My friends raved and ate and ate until it was gone!

It's good, but misnamed. Doesn't taste a thing like eggs benedict!!! I doubled the lemon juice and it wasnt' tart at all. I added dijon to the sauce. Used 4 raw eggs rather than the boiled as well. Hard boiled eggs, then baked just don't sound good. Again, it was good for a breakfast casserole but NOTHING like eggs benedict.

Rating: 1
Not very good, bland and unexciting. Broccoli was overcooked and there was all the unnecessary calories from the heavy cream. Ultimately edible but I had such high hopes... Will not make again.

This could possibly be the best thing I've ever eaten (getting super hungry during the time it took to make it probably helped :) I made a few modifications because it was just for my husband and myself: halved the recipe; cracked in 2 raw eggs instead of the hard boiled; used regular bacon instead of Canadian; substituted 1/4 cup thawed frozen spinach for the broccoli. I only let it chill for 30 mins while the oven preheated, and I baked it for the same amount of time and it came out just perfectly. When I make it again (and I will) I might try a touch more lemon juice and some dijon as other users suggested.

Excellent suggestions from the other reviewers. I followed most of the suggestions and ended up with the following: I beat the four eggs (instead of hard boiling them) and poured them over the muffins; I cut 12 oz lean bacon into 1/2" pcs and fried until crispy; I doubled the cheese and the lemon juice; I sprinkled finely chopped green onions over the top before putting muffin tops on. I baked it for 40 minutes. It was fabulous!!

With the suggested modifications from the other users--beaten or simply cracked-right-over-the-muffin eggs rather than hard-boiled, asparagus rather than broccoli, double the lemon juice--this dish is an absolute winner. I made it for my co-workers and they were amazed. I made a vegetarian version (which was eaten up by non-veggies alike) with water plus 1 T butter in place of the broth and no Canadian bacon. Was worried it might suffer from the lack of a salty meat, but it didn't at all. Warning: leave yourself a little more than 30 minutes for cooking.

This is a fantastic recipe, with a couple minor changes... double the lemon juice, skip the saute' step with the canadian bacon, and if you can get nice asparagus, replace the broccoli with fresh asparagus, blanched and cut in 2-inch pieces. Other cheeses work well too - try Gruyere or Fontina.

I found this to be totally yummy and decadant. I left out the broccoli and the hard boiled eggs (they just didn't seem to fit my idea of how this should be) and used six uncooked eggs. I also didn't bother to sautee the canadian bacon or chill the pudding before baking it. Maybe I'll actually try following the recipe sometime to see if it's worth it, but this time-ticker version was all I could have wanted.

Rating: 2
Really not what I was expecting :( The hard boiled egg gave a consistancy that was just awful and didnt match the rest of the dish. I was hoping to use up some of my leftover easter eggs but just ended up wasting more food by throwing this dish away, my fiance wouldn't touch it either. Thought the sauce on top was ok with an additional lemon juiced in and some dijon mustard.

I doubled this recipe and made a vegetarian version. I found that with a little ingrediant prep-work, it was very manageable. I was able to prepare it at night, let it sit, and cook it while I got ready in the morning. And definitely crumble the muffins for the top. Very "sophisticated" tasting brunch casserole!

I didn't love this dish, though in fairness my guests did. I did crumble the muffins on top which I think added a nice crunchy texture. Though overall, I didn't think the flavor or texture was that great. I enjoyed it more as leftovers but don't think I'd make it again. It takes longer then I like. I love eggs benedict and would just make them next time as they're easy to make even if you want to jazz them up with asparagus, etc.

This was good, but I was disappointed. I was expecting something more after reading all the reviews. I made it exactly as is, top was definitley hard. good sauce flavor though.

Fabulous! I have made this dish several times and my guests always rave about it and ask for the recipe. Light cream can be substituted for heavy.

I did this for New Years' Day brunch, and it was a huge hit with my husband and our guests. I only refrigerated it for about 2 hours - this was perfect! Double the lemon juice if you want the sauce to taste like Hollandaise. The second time I used asparagus instead of broccoli - it was even better!

Made this for Xmas day brunch. It is a perfect dish as you can do ahead and it features protein, carbs, veggie and so forth. The kids went back for seconds and there were zero leftovers. Next time I'm going to crumble the muffins on top as others suggested, the tops were too hard. Yum!

I HAVE to make this casserole for Christmas Brunch and Mother's Day brunch or my family swears they won't come. Even my picky adult nephews request it. I love "do ahead preparation" dishes!

I made a fast-track version of this recipe and it turned out very well: toasted the english muffins in the toaster; microwaved the broccoli (4 mins.); used pre-cooked Canadian bacon; didn't soak it as indicated, but rather put it straight in the oven. It still turned out very well -- the bottom was custardy and the flavour was interesting. I concur with a previous reviewer, though -- it would benefit from a spoonful of dijon or regular mustard.

I made this recipe for my picky teenaged daughters, my husband and his elderly (picky) parents. I made it with the alterations suggested by several of you, and cut up the bottom muffins into pieces and crumbled the tops in the food processor. It was marvelous and EVERYONE LOVED IT! A good recipe made better by all of you! Thanks!

While it was easy to make, it was very boring. I expected the flavor to be like eggs benedict. It needed either more lemon or some mustard.

The first time I made this I lowered the fat by using lite Jarlsberg, 2 percent milk and evaporated skim milk instead of cream. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and refrigerated about 12 hours. The result tasted good and the custard set up well but the bottom layer of english muffins turned into soggy mush. I also thought the hard-boiled eggs were too dominant. The next time I used the same lowfat subs but only two hard-boiled eggs, and I only refrigerated for two hours. It was still tasty and this time you could identify the english muffins. I also topped with buttered crumbs rather than quartered muffins and much preferred that. A good brunch or make-ahead breakfast that keeps and reheats well.

I think I must have done something wrong, because I was disappointed in the flavor and texture - my sauce did not really resemble a hollandaise in flavor or texture, and the muffins were just plain wet. NOW - we put everything but the sauce together the night before. We made the sauce in the morning and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours. We had doubled the recipe and so cooked both dishes at the same time for about 45 mins. I will try the recipe again, because I honestly think it was undercooked - we had two large pans in the oven and we live in a high altitude city (3500'). I'll post again when I get a chance to "do-over"!

This is an unusual and impressive brunch dish. I get raves every time I serve it. I make it as written, though the changes suggested by other cooks sound good, too. Incidentally, I found the directions absolutely clear, and I think they would be clear even to an inexperienced cook.

I tried this recipe out on my family and it was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly except I buttered and made a crumb mixture out of the muffin tops using my food processor. I really liked the brocoli and the cheese. It really did have the flavor of eggs benedict. It was a little more time consuming than other egg casseroles, but it is worth the time. It is so much better than the usual stratas. I am going to make this for my (MOPS)Mother of Preschoolers brunch.

A four forker for sure! I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't have been more pleased.

I put all the muffins on the bottom and liked the result. I also used asparagus and American bacon, and Swiss cheese instead of the gruyere. My only reservation is the length of time that it takes to prepare. I prefer breakfast casseroles that are less work, but I did enjoy this as a change of pace. It's definitely out of the ordinary.

This receipe was a hunt with my group. There were no leftovers. I used suggestions from the earlier reviews. I did use asparagus and I buttered and then processed half the muffin halfs to make a crumbly topping. I think this just might be my Christmas morning dish for this holiday.

I've substituted (drained and chopped) canned artichoke hearts for the ham when taking this to pot-lucks where the vegetarians outnumber the carnivores, and it has been as enthusiastically received as the original was by my family. I've made it several times since first seeing it in Gourmet. I'm taking it to a do this weekend again.

This is a very good dish. I used cubed lean ham, left off topping and added sliced tomatoes instead. I think it needs about 45 minutes to set properly. I had no problems following the recipe.

I served this for brunch for my parent's 40th wedding anniversary. I followed review advice and increased the lemon and used asparagus. It is a bit more elegant than other brunch casseroles I've had. Everyone loved it.

I sub'd asparagus (it was on special) for the broc. It was a big hit!

I loved this dish, I would suggest cutting the english muffins that go on top in smaller pieces, and I found that american bacon works just as well as candain bacon, if you don't have any

I tried the recipe before I made it for an Easter Brunch. I used asparagus instead of broccoli and I made bread crumbs with the English Muffins to put on top. But I didn't like the texture of the hard boiled eggs. I served it to my co-workers the next day and they really liked it. It was better after it sat for awhile.

I served this for Christmas brunch and everyone loved it. I broke up the muffins into smaller pieces and also make a topping with muffin crumbs and butter. Asparagus was delicious in it. It's rich and light at the same time.

I served this to 12 people and got rave reviews. I doubled the recipe and put it all together (except for the sauce) the day before and refrigerated it. Then I made and poured the sauce over both dishes about 11 p.m. and served it at 11 a.m. One small change: Instead of quartering the top muffins, I crumbed them in the processor, tossed with some melted butter and sprinkled them on top. I was very satisfied with that result. Definitely would serve again.

We made this recipe for Mother's Day Brunch, & everyone LOVED it, including the kids! We made two, & substituted asparagus for the brocolli in one dish & left it out in the other. As suggested, we also left the "tops" off. I dont understand how anyone could have a problem with this recipe. The instructions were clear, and it was VERY EASY to prepare! Much better than other stradas we've made!

Rating: 3
This is a nice change from the usual egg/cheese/ham make-ahead brunch recipes, a little more sophisticated (and a little bit harder to do, but well worth the extra effort. I turned the buttered muffins for the top into breadcrumbs (via food processer) and it worked well.

I made the dish by the recipe, only I doubled it. Two sets of guests praised the dish and asked for the recipe. I do not agree with the previous negative review, as I saw no hidden pitfalls. Though like hollandaise in flavor, this is NOT a true hollandaise, but I had no problem executing it using the difections given. The first time I refrigerated overnight in the refrigerator then cooked for brunch. The second time I poured the liquid over the muffins, etc. and froze the dish immediately. I thawed in the refrigerator overnight, then cooked 30 minutes. I preferred the consistency of this one to the first, as this one retained more of the muffin texture and was less like a pudding.

I've made this dish twice and it was loved by all both times. I 1-1/2 the dish and baked it in an 11 x 15 pan with great results. It's great for a gathering because all the rep work is done the night before.

What can I say....Gourmet Magazine does it again. This recipe is about as poorly written as they get. I made some substitutions and it turned out pretty darn good...1lb ham for canadian bacon, swiss for Jarlsberg. I Reccomend not even attempting this unless your stove has a very low setting for the sauce(it's hollandaise). Also, read the directions carefully and do all prep work before you start making it because you might run into a surprise or two. Another good theory poorly implemented by Gourmet Magazine.

This is a great recipe. I probably would not bother with the top layer of the english muffins though, they tend to dry out and just get in the way.

I made this in someone else’s kitchen and it still worked fine. It is very tasty, looks like a Bed & Breakfast dish, and is good cold too. I will try it in individual dishes the next time for a special presentation.

Very delicious! Worth the preparation, cook a little longer though to be sure pudding is set. :)
