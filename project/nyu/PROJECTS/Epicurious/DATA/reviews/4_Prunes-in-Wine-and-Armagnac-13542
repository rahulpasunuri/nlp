This is an amazing recipe that I've made many times over the years. I must admit I don't use Armagnac, but I substitute a less expensive brandy. With the red wine and sugar, I believe brandy adds lovely flavor without breaking the bank. Every time I give this as a gift, the recipients mention that they have licked every drop of the sauce and were sad when it was finished.

Fantastic and easy. The only hard part is getting my husband to agree to part with one cup of his beloved Armagnac!

I have been making this recipe for Christmas giving over the last ten years or so. It is a hit with those who appreciate the rich flavors it offers. I panicked when I realized I had misplaced the recipe after a kitchen remodel! Thank goodness I found it on your website; there would have been several very disappointed non-recipients otherwise!
