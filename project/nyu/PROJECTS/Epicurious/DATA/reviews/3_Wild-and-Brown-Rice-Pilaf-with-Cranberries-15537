I love you guys! I have my own version of this and was curious to see what epi had to offer. Laughed out loud at recipes (and comments) I too give the wild rice a jump start with extra liquid and toss in brown later as I love fluffy wild. Happy Thanksgiving to you all :)

I did not cook everything separately as suggested to make it simpler. The results was not bad, but not noteworthy. I really doubt that doing it the long way would improve it enough to make it worth the extra effort.

This recipe took way too long, and the apple cider flavor overpowers all the other flavors. I would not recommend it, and if I were ever to make this recipe again, I would cut out most of the apple cider and cook the wild rice for a fraction of the time recommended here.

What a ridiculous way to describe the steps to make a simple dish. I, too, did it my way and the result was fantastic. I used 2 pots and left them on the stove while I made the main course. Voila.

I agree with one of the previous reviews; this dish is overcomplicated and timely for a side dish. After nearly 2 hours of cooking, I was pretty exhausted to prepare to the entree. Or maybe I just had too many sips of the remaining dry white wine? Thank goodness hubby is on clean up duty, the number of used pots was a bit excessive.

As a long-ago grad of Johnson&Wales (CIA's nemesis), I looked at this, laughed, and did it my way. Over med. high heat, saute the shallots and onions in 1T butter, add the brown/wild rice w/ 2T butter, saute for 3-5 min stirring occasionally. Add the cranberries (dried) and de-glaze w/ white wine. Pour in cider and stock, stir well, cover pot, reduce heat to low and set timer for 30-35 min. (At 6200' where I live, it came out perfect - the wild rice had a bit of texture but not popped.) Add liquid if needed.

Wonderful, right up my alley. NB: it really only requires ONE pan. If you check out the recipe for "Wild Rice Stuffing with Hazelnuts and Dried Cranberries" you can use that as a template for cooking the whole thing together, adding the brown rice 30 minutes after the wild, etc. just adjust your liquids proportionately.

Loved this, it was right up my alley. In re: various pots, it really only needs one. If you check out the recipe for "Wild Rice Stuffing with Cranberries and Hazelnuts," you can use that as a template for cooking both rices together (adding the brown 30 mins after the wild) with the onions, etc. Just be sure and adjust your amounts of liquids accordingly.

This is a comment in reply to all who said it's unnecessary to dirty so many pans, etc. NOTE the recipe is from the CIA(!). While I was at Cordon Bleu, I never washed anything as little "gnomes" miraculously appeared to cart away all my disaster! Now, when considering a recipe, my first thought is, "How much mess will this create for ME to clean up?"

As another reviewer already commented, let's get real here - there is absolutely no need to dirty so many pans to make this delicious rice dish. This recipe is much more complicated than it needs to be! Boil 3c water and 1c apple cider. Add 2c of a brown/wild rice mixture (available in most bulk food sections). Toss in a couple pieces of a cinnamon stick, some veggie bouillion (chicken has too strong a taste) and a handful of chopped pecans, and reduce to a simmer. Put a handful of dried cranberries and an equal amount of chopped dried apricots in a small glass and cover with white wine. Sautee the onion (I used red onion) and some chopped shallot in some olive oil til translucent, add the wine from the fruit mixture, and simmer to reduce the amount of liquid. Add onion/wine mixture and dried fruit to rice and finish simmering til the liquid is absorbed. this makes for a much easier and much more delicious dish!

Okay, let's get serious here. In order to produce this recipe, it is necessary to cook the wild rice in one pot and the brown rice in another pot (both together with various other ingredients), cook the shallots in something else, and then combine all of the above. It's roughly the equivalent of making 3 simple recipes, none of them difficult but each of them requiring separate timing--a pain if you're actually making something else to go with the rice (a good idea, at least in my household). It also produces the equivalent of 3 recipes' worth of pots and other items to fill up your sink and/or dishwasher. While the resulting combination of rice, cranberries, and shallots is pleasant, it would have to be a lot better than pleasant to justify this much trouble.

Instead of roasting and shredding the shallots, I sauteed them and cooked them with the brown rice. Everyone raved about this recipe and since the leftovers were excellent, I think it could be made ahead and reheated with a little stock at the last minute.

ok, i'm feeling pretty dumb here, but i used minute rice for the brown rice. being lazy, i wanted to cook it in the same oven as the wild rice. well, i turned the brown rice to mush. I threw the 2 rices together and (ta-da!) called it risotto! It actually tasted pretty good.

This dish is a wonderful complement to a saucy moisture rich dish such as Coq au Vin.

I made this recipe using a shortcut - I made the brown rice and wild rice in the microwave, rather than baking it for 90+ minutes. There was little flavor to the dish.

8 oz is 1 cup so just figure it out from there. Good luck

Can you tell me the amounts by volume of cranberries, wild rice, brown rice and shallots?

I didn't have any wine so I used white grape juice which gave it a slightly sweet taste. I used an organic brown rice mixture and cooked the chicken stock, some apple cider vinegar, onions, the cranberries and the grape juice all together. It took over an hour, and I had to add about 1/2 cup of water but my husband, who hates brown rice, loved it!

To save oven space and keep a better eye, I cooked the wild rice on the stove rather then baking. Turned out great.

This was a lot of work for what you get. I used the same idea with a wild-brown rice pilaf mix and added the dried cranberries for just about the same result. Also I used unsalted chicken broth so add to add about 1tbs salt.

It needs some toasted walnuts in it-1/2 cup or so-
