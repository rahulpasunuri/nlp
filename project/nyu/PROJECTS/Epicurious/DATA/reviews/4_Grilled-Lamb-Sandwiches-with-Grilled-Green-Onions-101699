This was delicious! The meat was very flavorful and combined very well with the onions and baguette. Excellent meal and one of my favorites!

This was great, and easy, yet elegant enough for a dinner party (a little messy). I made the aioli and the roasted pepper sauce too. I also served it with a garlic olive tapenade. It is very presentable, it looks good even while it's cooking on the grill. You don't have to be really experienced to make this dish. Grilling it was easy, I put the green onions on when the largest peice of meat registered rare on my meat thermometer. It is a pleasing dish for the whole family, but the plain aioli is rather strong. With some grilled vegetables on the side, this dish makes a very satisfying meal. No need for improvements, the garlic didn't stay, but it was fine, because I flipped it anyway. A very good meal!

Just incredible! Be naughty... invite fewer guests to savor leftovers! The lamb is as amazing cold as warm.

This is an easy and absolutely delicious recipe. In addition, creating sandwiches from the roast makes the meat go a long way, making this a tasty and economical choice for casual entertaining or just for weekday lunches.

This was great and most of all there is no gamey taste. I also added yogurt and minced garlic salt and a few twigs of mint. Then it's perfict. This keeps well til the next day. Also try some sliced avacado.
