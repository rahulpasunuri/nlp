My brother and I opted to try this turkey for a change of pace from the traditional. BIG MISTAKE. I was leary of the high temperature, and wondered why the instructions did not recommend turing the oven temperature DOWN after the first 40 minutes. This was the most burned, dry turkey I have ever served (and I've roasted too many to count over the years). The quick cooking time only added to our irritation and bewilderment as we raced to get the other dishes completed 2 hours earlier than planned. Perhaps this recipe works for a 14 lb turkey - but I would not recommend it for a larger bird.

Boring, sweet and tasteless. It looked really great coming out of the oven but I would not make it again.

Turkey came out very moist and cooked quickly. Browned even before brushed with syrup. Had a little trouble deciding whether done because legs cooked more quickly than body. Used more water because first cup quickly boiled out before hour was up. Didn't particularly like flavor of gravy with the malt vinegar. Will make turkey again but will make regular gravy.

This is truly a wonderfully simple and delicious way to make a turkey. And the combined result of the turkey juices and the maple syrup makes for one of the best gravy I have ever had. It was my first time preparing Thanksgiving dinner, and I believe that this particular turkey will become a staple.

For those who had dry turkeys: I've not made this EXACT recipe, but have come extremely close with variants of the Maple Turkey from BA of 1994 (search here for Maple Turkey). That recipe calls for 30 minutes at 425 then back to 375. I've varied the recipes, and sometimes I've just basted with straight Maple Syrup. All turn out fine, but the 1994 recipe is the prototype. 425 the whole time will just dry out the bird! One synthesis is to make the 1994 version, but follow the glazing instructions here. The 1994 version used Maple butter to flavor under and over the skin, but doesn't glaze well. The two combined is ideal!

I made this but added softened with thyme and tarragon between the bird and the skin and the family raved. I needed to add more water during the cooking. Definitely woud make this a tradition. Gravy was fabulous with the addition of malt vinegar!

My 13lb tukey came out wonderfully. It was moist and juicy. I was careful to make sure there was water in the pan and to carefully follow the directions. The gravy was exceptional, but I think it's very important to use real maple syrup. If you are careful about keeping water in the pan, there is no reason this shouldn't come out perfectly.

My 15-lb turkey turned out great using this recipe! I didn't have to brine it to get a moist bird! Use a meat thermometer (like Alton Brown's) as it does cook faster (only 2hrs) because of the high heat. The maple syrup glazed fine, creating an awesome bronzed bird and great gravy. Pls don't let the other reviews keep you from trying this- with a thermometer you are good to go-- don't just blindly cook it for 3 hours like the other reviewers.

The turkey meat was hard and tough from the high-heat cooking. The meat flavor wasn't interesting. I didn't let the pan bottom burn, so I was able to use the drippings, and the gravy was delicious, however.

I roasted a 14-lb turkey using the recipe & glaze. I was very careful to monitor the water in the roasting pan, so didn't have any problems with burned glaze. There was very little taste of the maple glaze with the turkey, but the turkey was fairly juicy & the gravy was very good. The turkey itself was nicey browned but rather bland tasting.

my 16 lb. turkey cooked in 3 hours, or should i say OVERcooked in 3 hours because 425 is too hot and too long for turkey.i assume it was a misprint

I was disappointed - there just seemed to be no point. My maple glaze did not want to stick to the turkey, I am not sure why. Most of it ended up in the pan, then started to burn towards the end when I didn't realize the water had evaporated. It was bad enough that I couldn't use the drippings to make the gravy. The turkey itself was fine, but didn't have much maple flavor and the skin did not crisp up very well.
