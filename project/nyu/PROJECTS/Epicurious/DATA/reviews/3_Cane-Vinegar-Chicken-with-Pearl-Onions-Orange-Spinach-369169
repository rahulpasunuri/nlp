We really enjoyed this dish. We also never had Cane Vinegar so I used 3/4 cup of Rice Wine Vinegar and 1/4 cup of Sherry Cooking Wine and it worked really well with the flavours. The trick is to make enough to reheat it again on the stovetop the next day for seconds. I decided to add a little more liquid to it (1/4cup of OJ and 1/4 of veggie stock) - served over rice it was awesome!

Couldn't find cane vinegar (tried 4 different places), so I used rice vinegar. My husband and his parents loved this! Will enter the meal rotation

We substituted apple cider vinegar for the cane vinegar. That may have proven to be a big mistake. There wasn't much to like about the flavors and/or textures of this dish. I won't be making this again.
