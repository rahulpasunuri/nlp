I loved the flavors of this dish, it was just the right amount of spice, just watch out for the pods and peppercorns. It was easy to make and I would definitely make again. I found the "gravy" to be a bit runny, maybe because I used whole canned tomatoes.

One other tasty suggestion......... I bought all of my required spices from the Indian section at Wegmans. For some reason, they can offer quart size containers for the same price as the generic 2 oz MC.

First, I should admit this was my first time having curry... ever. That being said, I think it's a fantastic dish. Yes, it's a little time intensive. But, what a great weekend project. Next time, I'll probably abandon the chutney and simply serve with sliced green apples. Absolutely serve this with yogurt and homemade garlic naan (I used a recipe from allrecipes.com). YUM!

Wow! What a difference curry from scratch makes! The fresh garlic, ginger, and chiles made such a difference. You may want to add more chiles to both the chutney and the curry depending on how much heat you like; I put an extra jalapeno in each. Try toasting and grinding the cumin seeds and coriander pods for the curry - the flavor is amazing. The chutney reminds me of the coconut chutney you get with dosas and other South Indian dishes. Addictive!

this recipe was an incredible amount of work for such a poor flavorless dish. After spending two hours cooking it, my husband said it was just okay.

Spectacular. Used all the spices called for but substited dried/ground versions for some, and it still turned out perfectly. Yum.

Who says this is an authentic thai dish? Its got too many indian spices for that. You dont use all those spices in thai food.

This was an absolutely fantastic, authentic Thai dish. The smell of the spices throughout the kitchen elicited cries of delight. This dish was very spicy since I used the serranos; but would never change it. The only difference I would make would be to use a thickening agent for the sauce - it's a bit watery, even after simmering for longer than required. The chicken was tender and falling-off-the-bone. I served the chicken curry over rice-stick noodles, I think I will serve it over basmati rice the next time. Definitely a keeper recipe.

This is a great recipe - I have made it several times, despite the fact that it is a lot of work. I recommend the naan recipe in Bon Appetit, 9/1998, to go with the curry sauce. Enjoy!

This was WONDERFUL! Yes it was work, but "fun" work and everyone raved about it. I served it on a bed of basmatti rice on a huge platter and that made for a great presentation. Thanks to Elaine and Lisa (above) for your suggestions! I'll definitely make this dish again.

I thought the chutney was very good. I think it could also be very tasty substituting mangos. As far as the chicken curry, the taste did not measure up to the aroma. I was disappointed with the outcome for all of the work and ingredients involved.

This is a great recipe which we've made many times since it was first published. We've seen very polite guests consume multiple helpings, then apologetically pour extra gravy on their plates to mop up with bread.

I have made this recipe numerous times and absolutely love it! I have made it for at least 10 dinner parties and it is the dish served at an annual get together when a friend of mine arrives here in the summer. I make mounds of basmati rice and serve lots of beer. It is FABULOUS! The chutney is absolutely wonderful!
