I make this dish quite frequently when I get baby bok choy from a favorite grocer. I've used several kinds of mushrooms and shredded sweet potatoes into the mix instead of using the vermicelli with sweet potato starch. You can really add any veggies you have on hand and make it your own. It's even more delicious the next day!

Where are the noodles in the Ingredient list? I would like to make this but I don't know how much or what kind of noodles to buy?

Pretty good, but ultimately not worth the effort. And it yielded a TON. The mountains of leftovers were improved by the addition of a bit more soy sauce & some siracha.

Worth the effort! Tasty. I would definitely make this again. This is as close to restaurant tastiness as one will find. I found some of the recipe info was superfluous and time consuming. Key ... Prep everything. I cooked the noodles to package directions which was twice the time called for here. Al dente, but not overly chewy. I didn't bother cutting the noodles. Easily and more fun twirled on fork. Love these "cellophane" noodles, they soak up the flavorful sauce. Yummy. Asian chef and cookbook writer Mai Pham knows her stuff. If it's got her name on the recipe, it's authentic and good!

This has made it into my regular weeknight dinner list. It was quite time consuming at first, but I cook with my husband so between the two of us we've gotten to be pretty efficient with practice. We take a few shortcuts (e.g., Is it really necessary for a home cook to saute the shallots in two separate batches?) I do use a chinese noodle instead of sweet potato noodles and have decreased the brown sugar a bit. Excellent recipe as witten too.

Might make this again. It was good but not good enough to take so much time to make the dish. Would have given it 3 forks it it took less time.

I just used Thai noodles that had a thickness of linguine (it was the only type of Chinese noodle that they carried in my grocery store). The prep time for this dish was a little long but well worth it. Next time I would probably add chicken. I will definitely make it again.

First, a note to those who are as naive as I was before I made this recipe. Sweet potato noodles don't have a sweet-potato taste. They are clear and tasteless, and have the consistency of gummy worms when cooked. They kept squirming away when I tried to cut them up and were generally not worth the effort. I would make the veggies and sauce again without the noodles.

Made my own pasta and used chili-sesame oil to add some heat.

actually kind of bland, the texture was too sticky. I think I prefer a lighter, spicier sauce
