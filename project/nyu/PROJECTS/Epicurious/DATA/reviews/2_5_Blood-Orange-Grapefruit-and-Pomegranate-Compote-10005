I actually didn't get a chance to try this because my guests sucked it up, so it must have been good. I wound up using only 1 grapefruit--i had extra syrup but spooned the fruit into a seperate bowl. Served it with a bunch of other desserts--some people ate it straight, some added it as topping to a brandy alexander pie.
