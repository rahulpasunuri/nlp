So quick and easy. I can't get enough of the fresh taste of celery root. And no cooking!

I had always cooked celery root (best way: roasted with other vegs like carrots, parsnits...). This was a suprise and a winner every time. The only change we made is to use rice vinegar, because we like its mildness.

I always wondered what to do with celery root! -- this is very good, and easy. Next time I might try adding a few dried cranberries for a chewy/sweet twist.

A nice diversion from typical coleslaw.

I liked this recipe, and it got good reviews. It has a nice texture and richer flavor than most salads.

This salad is fantastic and very easy to prepare. I added more pecans than the recipe called for. My guests also enjoyed this salad.

The key to this recipe is celery root with a pungent, crisp, aroma. You should be able to smell it in the car on the ride home from the grocery.

This was very tasteless. I added blood orange vinegar, a bit of orange zest, a dash of cayenne pepper, and half of a Fuji apple cut in thin pieces to make it palatable. Perhaps celery root has differing flavor strengths...mine had no distinctive flavor so was a poor base for the other ingredients.
