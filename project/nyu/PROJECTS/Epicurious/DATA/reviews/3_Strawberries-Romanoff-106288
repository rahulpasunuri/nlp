This is really simple, but it's very good. We served this after a beef stew with asparagus for friends, and it was just perfect, not too heavy after what had come before. We served it with good vanilla ice cream instead of the whipped cream. Sometimes (maybe always?)a simple recipe is the best way to show off good fruit.

What's not to like!!! So I'm making up for the other negative reviews. Is it a 4 fork-maybe not, but it's a great basic recipe and the suggestion of tghe reviewer to add some softened premium ice cream is a great one.

wow. I was unimpressed. I thought this was a waste of my farmer's market organic strawberries - HOWEVER - the next day we tried the leftovers and it was better? the orange somehow melded with the berries and it was acceptable - I agree with one of the previous reviewers, though, forget this recipe and just go for berries with whipped cream.

Strawberries Romanoff has to be my all time favorite way to serve fresh strawberries for a speacial occasion. However, I add 1/2 c. softened premium vanilla ice cream to the whipped cream and serve over the macerated berries. It adds substance and extra creaminess as well as depth of flavor.

How could anyone NOT like this. I do wish there was a way to get rid of obviously ridiculous reviews.

It was delicious. I substituted Grand Marnier for the Cointreau since Cointreau was too expensive. I made twice the amount of whipped cream and it all went.

Good, but not great. Simple strawberries and cream much more delicious.

Strawberries Romanoff is generally delicious and this recipe is easy to make. I'd definitely make it again, and would recommend ignoring the negative review which seems to have come from someone who either a) used Worstechire sauce instead of Cointreau or b) is a kid writing in a prank review.

I make this quick and easy dish all the time, and it is always delicious!! While the strawberries do look mushy, I wonder if the previous reviewer even bothered to taste it.

Unlike a previous reviewer, who I totally disbelieve, I found it to be fast, easy and a great Spring dessert. How can you go wrong with only four easy ingredients?

I too have used this dessert on several occaisions. The only negative experience I've had is when I mistakenly used salt instead of sugar. Everyone I've served it to has loved it!

I make this recipe frequently during strawberry season because it is quick, easy, and relatively light. I'm not sure what the previous reviewer did wrong - perhaps the Cointreau was bad? This is a lovely, attractive dish. Be sure to taste the strawberries for sweetness and adjust sugar if needed. Those who avoid alcohol can use OJ instead of Cointreau.
