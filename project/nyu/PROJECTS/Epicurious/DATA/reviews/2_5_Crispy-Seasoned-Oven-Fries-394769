This recipe did come out nice and crunchy like restaurant fries, but we weren't fans of the seasoning. i would make this with my own seasonings or simply sea salt and pepper next time. Also, we had to cook the fries about 40 min instead of 20.

Oven fries are hard to get crispy so when I saw the name of the recipe, I thought this would be different. I suspected they would be like any other oven fries. I basically bake them as long as I can without burning. I guess I like the fries without a lot of moisture. Still good!

I made these with sweet potatoes and they were very tasty.

I added a bit of water to a whole beaten egg coated them with whole wheat flour, smoked paprika, finely ground green tea leaves, and ground flack seed, black pepper and sea salt ... light spray of olive oil then cooked them on a Panini Grill on high for about 7-10 minutes.they came out really nice and crispy and tasted great.

I concur with everyone else's review.Oven fries with olive oil, garlic powder, salt and pepper spread on a pan with a 350-400 degree oven (depends on how impatient you are!) and flipped after 15-20 minutes makes great oven fries. Add oregano and they're "greek fries" around here. Also, a minimum of oil goes a long way (like 1 tsp. for 2-3 good size russets). You don't want them oily, you want them crisp!

I also vote for the olive oil instead of egg white..Our discovery has been to coat the potatoes with spice up oil and the heat the pan real hot with a little bit of oil spread in it...toss in the "fries" and watch them crisp up..if you want you can switch out the coating oil for spray & spice and add some romano cheese with your saved calories! We call these Nannie's Taters.

Really..... made this and won't again. Keep it simple when it comes the fries.

Didn't think this was very good at all as written. Drop the breadcrumbs and egg whites. Spray pan or cookie sheet with spray. Then mix in bowl, thick sliced potatoes, the spices, with some olive oil to coat. Cook 20 minutes, flip, cook another 20. Perfect oven fries, cooked to the middle, crispy on the outside.

What a waste of time and ingredients. Ill-conceived recipes like this one give healthy cooking a bad reputation. Roasting with olive oil and your choice of seasoning, as the reviewer below suggests, is the sensible alternative to deep frying.

I think it will be easier and taste better to quarter the potatoes, toss with rosemary and olive oil and salt, and bake. The seasoning did not add anything in particular tastewise and the texture was not great. They got eaten, but I won't make this recipe again either.

My seasoning didn't really coat the fries, it kind of stuck in clumps. Thought it was a really mediocre recipe. Won't make it again.
