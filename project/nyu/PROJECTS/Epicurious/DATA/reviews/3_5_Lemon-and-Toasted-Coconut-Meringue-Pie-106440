This pie turned out excellent, though it needed a few alterations and takes a bit of technique. My crust was perfection, after adding a few things to the basic recipe. Primarily, I doubled the shredded coconut and added about 1/2tsp of coconut extract to bump up the flavor, plus 1/2tsp vanilla and 2 tbs brown sugar. It was fantastic. If you want nice tart filling, cut the sugar to 1/2- 3/4c, and also add 1tbs lemon rind. Above all, be really careful cooking the filling! If you turn the heat too high, you'll get little pieces of cooked egg white (though small ones will disappear after sitting). Finally, I would NOT put coconut in the meringue- I think it would ruin the nice texture. Instead, I stuck with 1c toasted coconut on top, plus extra coconut in the crust.

I am sadly disappointed in this recipe, chosen for my sister's birthday. I used a different crust, but other than adding some lemon zest to the filling, I followed the recipe exactly as written. The filling had outstanding flavor and texture. It was the highlight of the pie, but my meringue flopped. Everything looked good with the meringue through the end of baking with a nice even golden color and excellent loft, but once the pie cooled, the meringue went flat, falling concave into the pie and pulling away from the crust leaving an unattractive limp pie to take to dinner. Certainly I may have made an error to cause this, but I would not be tempted to spend another day trying this pie again.

Delicious pie! Came out great! A few changes: 1 cup of lemon juice. Then added about 1 teaspoon of grated zest to filling. Used 3/4 cup of sugar for filling because I like a more tart filling. (was perfect!). Didn't use coconut at all. Baked only about 30 minutes at 300 degrees then lowered to 275 and baked only about 10 minutes more. No need to over bake this pie. OUTSTANDING AND DELICIOUS!

Either my oven is extremely hot, or all the baking times in this recipe are way too long. I burned one batch of coconut before realizing it only needed a couple of minutes to toast. I had to be careful not to burn the crust and the pie itself: I kept tin foil on the edges the entire time it was baking, and and covered the whole darn pie with tin foil for a good chunk of time. I also moved it to a low shelf in the oven... and I STILL took it out early because the coconut was starting to burn. As a reference, all the other lemon meringue pie recipes I can find online say to bake the pie for about 20 minutes... not an hour and 15 minutes! My crust was beautiful when it came out of the freezer, but got kind of deformed when I baked it. Probably my technique was bad. The lemon filling was yummy, from what I tasted as I put it into the pie. I put the filling through a sieve to get rid of lumps. All that being said, it looks pretty gorgeous there on the cooling rack. I haven't tasted the finished product yet... will update when I do. This is for a pie contest, so wish me luck!

Amazing results! Such a great spin on lemon meringue pie. Here are my results - such a beautiful pie, and definitely worth the effort. If you have the time, definitely let your pie sit for awhile before transporting. Unfortunately we were running late, and had to take the still warm pie in the car, so by the time we ate it the meringue had deflated a bit. That said, still super super tasty.

The result is phenomenal, and so is the energy expenditure. As a dessert, this pie is really tops - but be prepared to start a day or two early, and use about a zillion different kitchen tools.

This is a great lemon pie that I've made several times, and will keep as one of my favorites. I make my own standard crust, though. The meringue is especially nice.

I just recently made this pie for a pie- baking competition, and it got rave reviews! Also, it came in first for the "taster's choice" award. I used my own crust, but followed everything else exactly, and it turned out great. I am definitely going to make this again and again!!!

The filling was outstanding and better than any lemon pie I've had. The meringue was almost like a meringue cookie top which made it a little crumbly. The next time I'd use a standard meringue that's more fluffy and top it w/ coconut. Also, the toasted coconut when put back in the oven gets pretty brown.

This was fantastic! And the crust, though a bit crumbly to work with, made all the difference in the end. It took me 7 small lemons to get the 3/4 cup juice, and I added the zest from 2 of them and used slightly less than the full amount of sugar to make the sour more potent. A+

This is a tried and true keeper for any lemon-aholic. I have probably made this pie 20 times and always love the great results. There is some planning and preperation involved, but if you have the time and patience you will be rewarded with a divine result.

This is an awesome pie. Crust is light and flaky and the filling is luscious. I used some key lime juice and lemon juice and added lemon zest to the filling. The coconut in the crust and the meringue put this pie over the top!

the crust was a bit overwhelming on this pie, too thick and hard and cookie like. I've had better lemon meringue pies. The filling on this one was so-so, a bit more on the sweet as opposed to the tart side.

I´ve made this pie two times already, and will keep doing it. Great flavor and beautiful presentation. My family loved it both times.

I chose this recipe because it had two things I had on hand and needed to use: lemons and coconut. I had neither the time nor the inclination to fool with the crust, so I compromised. I took a Pillsbury crust, spread coconut on the bottom of the pie pan, put down the crust, then brushed it with egg yolk and sprinkled on more coconut. I pricked it all over with a fork and baked it in a 450 oven for 10 minutes. It was delicious. I also ran short of lemon juice, so I made up the difference with lime juice. Amazingly good!

I made this for my mother's birthday and while it was a real labor of love, it was spectacular. I don't have a food processor but my crust turned out just fine. I didn't have the heat high enough on the filling at first, but it too turned out amazing! I got many, many oooohs and aaaahhs over this pie. The filling is much like a lemon curd, very rich but it is one of the best pies I've ever had, if I do say so myself.

I made this pie for Easter dinner, and it was a hit! I had a bit of trouble with the crust, but it was well worth the effort. The filling and meringue were fantastic.

Absolutely wonderful! Our family loves a good, tart lemon pie. This pie is not too sweet and has a true lemon tarty flavor that is complemented by the subtle taste of coconut in the crust. I have made this pie the past two Easters. I don't imagine they would let me in the door now without it!

Well, well worth the time commitment and was accomplished in steps. This recipe will be in my personal archives.

I loved the custardy creaminess of the lemon part of this pie. I don't usually like the gelatinous texture of most lemon pies.

I made this pie for my Mother's birthday and found it to be very time-consuming. The end result was excellent, but the process was difficult. Many of the times allocated were not right for me. For example, the time to bake the crust was was too long, as was the time needed to beat the egg whites.

I made this recipe without the coconut because a guest and my daughter are not fans of coconut. It was great without it. My daughter has requested it for her first communion dinner.

I love coconut and lemon and wanted to try something new. This pie took alot of time and work, used alot of ingredients. It wasn't worth it.
