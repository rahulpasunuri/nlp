YUCK! This is so far real Chinese beef with broccoli that I'm surprised that I found it on this website.Look for another recipe...one with ginger, garlic, oyster sauce...

This recipe was quick I'll give it that, but thanks to reviews I basically tossed out the proposed ingredients and made it to match my own taste. As advertised from other cooks I added double the amount of sauce, beef broth, and lots of cilantro, double garlic and ginger. Additionally, during the broccoli phase of cooking I tossed in some green onions and doused them with medium sherry, which made it spectacular. Definitely use low sodium soy sauce or skip the salting of the meat. I then added minced chili's in a tube (deli section in most US stores)and put it over low carb noodles. That part you can skip. To keep it low carb I cut down the amount of corn starch, which made the sauce a wonderful au juis and just right to eat as a stew. Next time I'm going to flavor with maybe mandarin orange or lime and use sesame/veg oil for more flavor. Play with this, you'll have fun and you'll get fabulous results to your taste. Just keep the heavy items like soy in check and you're good to go.

This was pretty good. Easy and satisfying.

Beef with broccoli is one of my favorites. I really had to doctor this up to get any flavor. I used beef broth instead of plain water, added some extra garlic. It's a good base recipe if anything. Next time I'll add some Ginger and some chili flakes as someone suggested.

Great weeknight family meal. Recommend doubling to feed a family of 2 adults & teen boys. Used fresh broccoli & NY strip steak, sliced.

Soooo easy and very nice flavor. I ended up adding more water to increase the sauce and it was still lovely. I will most certainly make some additions next time (fresh ginger, CRP, green onion...) and try low-sodium soy. but all in all, was thrilled with the ease and easy flavor

The recipe as written came out a rank, salty mess. I mean, how can you screw up beef with broccoli? But, without many additions, this dish is not up to par.

A solid if unspectacular receipe. Probably a lot healthier than take out and pretty darn quick. Next time may consider adding sliced fresh ginger or chili flakes to liven things up.

My husband is very picky when it comes to beef and broccoli. He typically only likes it at Chinese takeout, but he loves this recipe! Even my two little girls eat it up! It is a household favorite now.

This recipe was pretty good, but I think next time I would add a little heat. Maybe a little garlic chili paste. I used peanut oil for my vegetable oil and added a can of sliced water chestnuts which gave it a nice crunch.

This was very tasty and smelled wonderful! I used a little more garlic than the recipe called for, because we are big garlic lovers.

Proved to be quick, easy and great tasting. Would experiment a little the next time for starters with just a tad more sauce.

Great! As with most people I added extra veggies. I used a ton more fresh broccoli. Bamboo shoots and bean sprouts at the end. Also used ginger, the kind in the tube in the refrigerated section. Red pepper flakes. Also made egg drop soup with it and paired iot with Udon Rice noodles instead of rice. Cant wait to make it again!

I prefer more veggies than beef, so I added oyster mushrooms, onions, and snow peas. I also cut back the soy sauce and used some fish sauce and sesame oil, along with chili garlic sauce and ginger. It was delicious, this recipe is a good starting block.

Great quick recipe with a few modifications. Marinated sliced clodhammer beef in soy sauce and mirin. Then coated with cornstarch. As suggested by other reviewers, I added minced ginger and replaced 2tbsp of soy sauce with oyster sauce and used fresh broccoli.

Fabulous!!!!!! I added garlic to the dry mix for he beef and had to add extra water and soy sauce because there was not enough sauce for my liking. I would definitely make it again!

I made this using flank steak (cut against the grain into bite sze pieces) and tons of broccoli since that's my favorite part. I added a bunch more garlic, some ginger and I usually make almost double the sauce. Next time I may add chili paste or red pepper flakes for some heat to try it out.

This was a super easy and delicious dish. I took a note from some of the other comments and added oyster sauce, garlic chili paste (Spicy!) and fresh minced ginger. I even used a cheaper cut of meat and it turned out tender. Will definatley be making this again!

Made it as a quick Sunday night meal. Very easy and tasty. Added a cornstarch slurry to a bit of chicken stock and added when I returned the beef to the mixture. Will add other veggies if I have them. I'd make this for my inlaws...

This was a lot easier to make than I thought! You really have to dredge the meat (I used sirloin tips that I sliced into thin strips) in the cornstarch...almost pressing the meat into the cornstarch to make it stick...after that had no problems at all...adding ginger, red pepper slices for color, some oyster sauce, and a few red pepper flakes helped improve the flavors.

This tasted 10 times better than the Chinese restaurant across the street. I threw a tablespoon of fresh chopped ginger and a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes in with the broccoli and garlic. I also like a thicker sauce, so I mixed 1/2 tsp of cornstarch with the water and poured it on. It took about 15 minutes to make from start to finish.

Loved this! I bought beef cubes for stew and marinated them for about 20 minutes in soy sauce before putting the cornstarch on it. I added a little more soy sauce once I added beef cubes back into the pan. Meat was a little tough though, but I think I just cooked it too long. Put this over white rice and it was excellent!

I loved this. And so did my husband. I will make again.

Not saucy at all. I tripled the water trying to get a little liquid in the sauce, still came out dry. I'll hunt for another B&B recipe.

I've talked to a couple of chef's in Asian restaurants with great beef and broccoli, and their "secret" ingredient is OYSTER SAUCE with the soy, with a little more oyster sauce than soy (you can buy it bottled in the Asian food section, just like soy sauce). It gives the sauce a real savory appeal (but not fishy, even though it sounds that way). Ginger, as several have suggested, is also typically part of the recipe.

Great meal for when I get home at 8:30/ 9:00 from work and want to put something quick on the table. A great alternative to the otherwise tempting chinese place down the street (my jeans appreciate that). The texture of corn starch makes my skin crawl, so I recommend putting the beef - or chicken - in a large ziplock and shaking it together that way. I wouldn't make it for my inlaws, but its a great meal on the fly. Low-sodium soy sauce helps.

While this lived up to the "quick" in it's title, I found it lacked any sort of complexity or interesting flavors. I checked the other reviews, and then added a heaping teaspoon of ginger paste, a dash of thai sauce, and a little chili sauce. I added more salt and pepper too, because the sauce did taste a little watered down. I used dark soy that I had on hand, and it came out a little tar-like in appearance, although the sauce was very smooth. A can of bamboo shoots helped a little with variety. I would make it again, only with a lot of changes.

I'm 16 years old with divorced parents and I am the cook of my dad's house now. I made this for dinner and even though I'm new to cooking, I felt that some things sounded as though they were missing and added them as I went along. I found that ideally, you need a little more corn starch after you've added the water/soy sauce mixture. I noticed that the "sauce" was a tad thin, so I added some as well as some ground ginger because Asian food just doesn't taste right without it! I also added some carrots as well because broccoli just didn't sound like it was enough. It came out quite well if I do say so myself!

Easy, fast, attractive, healthy (which keeps me happy) and a vehicle for rice (which keeps a smile on fiance's face). I've found that the majority of recipes on epi are a lil bit less spicy than we prefer, so I kicked it up a notch with additional cracked pepper and some flaked red chilies. I used fresh brocc, as did most other reviewers. Frozen veggies for stir fry? Yech. We decided that the missing ingredient was grated ginger, and it sounds like other reviewers thought the same. I'll certainly make this again, next time with ginger and/or chili paste.

toMedusae from Auburn, AL..I read the recipe and I do agree with you.I make my version of this all the time, and mine is very tasty.Here it is for you.Cut beef into thin strips,and if it is tenderloin, then you can cube it.Grate 3 cloves of garlic, about 1 tsp ginger,grated,soy sauce to taste,and fresh ground pepper. Mix well then leave it for about 10 or 15 min.In your pan or wok,heat some oil..not too much.I uses sunflower,but you may use peanut if no one is allergic.I saute the meat, then I add the sliced brocolli florets (rinced in very hot water to remove possible mites.)Mix it together,add 1 cup of chicken or vegetable broth.Bring once to the boil.Now in another small bowl,place 1 full tsp of tapioca powder or cornstarch.I use the tapioca cause its lighter,and no gluten.disslove it in cold water,add a few drops of soya sauce, then add it to the beef and broccoli,turn down heat,stir till it thickens and voila, serve it with hot steamed rice.Hope you enjoy my version.

I made this last night, using fresh broccoli as well. I was hoping it would turn out like a Chinese-takeout-place beef and broccoli but it was nowhere close. It basically ended up like beef and broccoli soaked in watered down soy sauce. Not good. The sauce needs other flavors and needs to be thickened. I don't plan to make this ever again.

This was pretty good and so easy that I would make it again. My only modifications were that I added chili pepper flakes to the corn starch and at the end I added sesame seeds and green onion.

I used fresh Broccoli and added a T of minced fresh ginger... much better with the ginger. The sauce was just missing that edge without it.

This recipe needs more than just soy sauce to kick up the flavor.

While this recipe isn't gourmet, it was quick and still extremely tasty. I too used fresh broccoli, and I added 1/4c minced fresh onion to the wok along with the broccoli and garlic. To the sauce I added just a touch of sesame seed oil and a pinch of crushed chili peppers to give it a little bit of zing, but not so much that the heat hides the taste of the sesame oil. Next time I might mix in a tbsp of sesame seeds right at the end of the cooking time for garnish. I'll definitely be making this recipe again. Its nice and quick for a weeknight meal when you want something healthy and yummy, but don't really want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.

I used beef tenderloin,and fresh broccoli (because they were what I had) doubled the soy, water and garlic (to make it a little saucier). I didn't blanch the broccoli first, just threw it in. My 3 year old LOVED it and my husband and I enjoyed it with a squirt of sriracha. YUM!

A great quick meal! I halved the recipe and substituted fresh broccoli florets blanched for two minutes and peanut oil in place of vegetable oil. A definite make again meal, but I may try adding a bit of fresh, chopped ginger along with the garlic.
