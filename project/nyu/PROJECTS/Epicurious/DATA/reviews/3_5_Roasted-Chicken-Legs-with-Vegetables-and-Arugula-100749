I made it with Ras El Hanout and paprika and fresh thyme to spice, and it was excellent. Also did the roasted garlic and added some carrots as well. Yummm!

Delicious and easy to make. I used already packaged chicken thighs and drumsticks. Prepared with a bit of olive oil and seasoning. I cooked everything at the same time and it all came out perfectly cooked. I did turn the heat down after about 10 minutes or so as the meat and veggies were browning quickly. Added garlic cloves as others have suggested. Nice touch. Served over rocket because it was on sale. Will definitely be making this again!

We love "one pot" meals and this one is a keeper. It is so simple, yet it yields fantastic flavor!

This was amazing, so easy and earned rave reviews from my dinner guests. I followed the recipe exactly, and for an (almost) all-in-one dish, the presentation was fantastic and the flavours were incredible. Definitely a keeper!

This was not only easy to make but delicious. I salted the chicken and then browned it an oven proof pan on stove top. Afterwards, I added the rest of the ingredients tossed in olive oil. I also threw in whole cloves of garlic and roasted in the oven as per the recipe. I turned the chicken once so that it was crispy on both sides. The red bell peppers really add a nice touch by adding some color. I would definitel make this again.

this recipe was flavorful and healthful. insofar as time and temperature are concerned, i didn't change a thing. i did, however, add a handful of fresh garlic cloves. the skin of the chicken was pleasantly crispy, while the inside remained moist.

Really awesome and simple recipe. I would recommend cooking the potatoes earlier than the rest of the recipe in order to make sure that they are a little more crispy on the outside. And depending on your oven, you might need to cook it longer to get a crispier exterior for both the potatoes and chicken. I actually ended up having to cook it for an hour instead of 30 minutes.

Loved the dish! Added leeks and used baby spinach instead of arugula and served with a saffron rice! My 6 yr old son gave 2 thumbs up. Chicken is moist and tender. I took all veggies out and broiled chicken to get the skin a bit browner.

Best with lots and lots of greens -- any kind. Fantastic and brutally easy.

PS: Very important to salt & pepper the chicken before you bake it. I left it out by accident once and it *was* bland even with salting after cooking. Making again tonight!

We love this recipe! It's quick, easy, colorful & delicious. I've been making it since it was first published back in '97 & typically serve it over risotto with a bit of parm tossed in. If your chicken skins are not crisping, either your oven is not hot enough (450 is a must), you covered the chicken with the vegetables, or you used too much oil. I don't really stray from the original recipe and it comes out perfectly every time. Good luck!

Very good. I used crushed fennel seed and cumin seed instead of thyme; beet greens (lightly cooked in a skillet) instead of arugula and skipped the wine. Also added zucchini to the roasted vegetables which turned out delicious.

I am a novice cook, so I was looking for an easy main dish for a dinner with guests. I made it once and the result was a bit embarrassing since the chicken was tasteless and the skins did not cook well. I tried it a second time, this time cooking the chicken in a pan for a while as a cook suggessted. Still the result was no more than an ordinary dish. The skins rubbery.

It certainly was easy to throw together, and the kitchen smelled fabulous (fresh thyme from the windowsill a definite plus). I would certainly cook it longer next time (potatoes were NOT done), and other cooks' suggestions of lowering the heat and/or browning the chicken first are also worth considering. Still, it was a snap to prepare, and the husband and teenage boy snarfed it and asked for more.

You will be surprised just how delicious this easy recipe is. I changed nothing but did heat the oil and lightly browned the chicken legs while I chopped the rest of the goodies.

I added an onion and cooked it longer and lower. I did not brown the meat but I had started the chicken for 10 minutes on its own before I found this recipe. Next time no wine (the juices were great on their own) and I will substitute spinach for arrugula as suggested below. We will cook this again. Quick and tasty.

We REALLY enjoyed this dish....I used all of the recommendations from previous cooks...the dish is just great! I doubled the recipe....my husband and I ate nearly all of it.

I add in a few more veggies (cherry tomatos, onions roughly quartered) and a couple of garlic cloves, reduce the heat and lengthen the cooking time slightly so that everything gets brown and very tender inside. Once the chicken and veg is done, try adding a little flour and stock to the liquid in the pan and then some red wine instead of white - it makes a deliciously rich gravy.

We had my parents over for dinner and doubled this recipe. We used one red and one yellow pepper, small red potatoes, browned the chicken first in a hot skillet, and used 3/4 cup white wine. Everyone agreed that it was delicious and it made a beautiful presentation. We will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe--my very meat-and-potatoes boyfriend loves it as well. My local market seems to be perpetually out of arugula so I have also tried it with baby spinach, which is delicious (though certainly different) and potentially a nice alternative for folks who don't like the bite of arugula. I've made it 3 times. A perfect easy, quick meal for 2.
