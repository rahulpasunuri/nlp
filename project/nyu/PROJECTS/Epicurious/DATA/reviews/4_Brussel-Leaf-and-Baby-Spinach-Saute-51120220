My girlfriend made this for me and got me hooked. I made it for myself and followed her advice of adding feta cheese. Now its my favorite way to eat brussel sprouts.

oh yeah, buy shredded brussel sprouts from trader joes, or just cut the brussels in half, then cut out the stem rather than peeling. it's less pretty, but who cares ones it's in your mouth?

i'm diabetic so maple syrup isn't the best option. i substituted 1/2 tablespoon splenda brown sugar and 3 tablespoons white wine for the maple syrup. personally i think it's better. also, you can add caramelized onion, or substitute kale for spinach and it's still awesome! this recipe is endlessly versatile.

Wonderful. Lighter than the roasted sprouts with bacon that I love; perfect with fish. I sliced my very small sprouts instead of separating the leaves--can't imagine it could have been better.

This was quite nice for Thanksgiving. It is time-consuming, though: it took me three-quarters of an hour to peel the brussels sprouts (doubled the recipe). You should definitely go for the larger sprouts with this recipe; I only got 6 -7 leaves off of each one. And don't discard the rest of the sprout-the "tough core" is perfectly edible-just save for another sprout recipe.

Excellent. I like my cooked greens very lightly wilted. These cook super fast once in the skillet, so if you're like me, have everything ready to go when you put the brussels in the pan (including dressing and plates). I have tried them with honey and cider vinegar as well. Very interchangeable. Husband has declared this his #1 fave salad.

This was delicious and very satisfying! I will definitely remember this recipe as my 9 year old daughter loved it. I had to make a second batch, which was fine since it only took five minutes!

I love the tang of the vinegar in this and with the almonds, it is a very satisfying way to eat your greens! I think I'm going to make this all the time. I'm hooked.
