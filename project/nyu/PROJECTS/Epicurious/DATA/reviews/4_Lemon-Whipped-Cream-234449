Perfect fresh and light. I am not really a dessert person but like to give guests something when I have a dinner party. This was perfect served it over fresh blackberries, blueberries and raspberries.

Perfect for a spring/summer dessert. Fresh, cool and light. I combined 3 cartons sliced strawberries, 3 cartons blueberries and 3 cartons blackberries, and then tripled the cream recipe and it was perfect for a large dinner party. (About 12 1c servings fruit with 1/2 c of cream.) Delish!
