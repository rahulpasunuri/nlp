Really good... Made as written except added crab (shells to stock and meaty portions to bowl). I used ouzo and left out the cream-- I had it, but the soup was so rich and velvety that I decided to save the calories for dessert!

This is probably my favorite soup I've ever made. I always use sherry, since I don't have Pernod. I use a stick blender and I don't put it through a sieve because I like the texture.

This was an amazing recipe- a lot of work, but the soup turned out very flavorful and super-silky. It was one of my courses for New Year's Eve. Absolutely don't skip the straining step- it's essential for the luscious final texture of the soup. I used Turkish Raki in place of the Pernod, but did everything else as written.

Made a rich lobster stock the prior weekend, I skipped the pernod, but deglazed the veg with congac. Added sffron threads, lowered the cayenne to 1/8t. Buzzed it with the stick blender. Served the soup with shaved shrimp, dizzled cream sherry on top. You will enjoy this one.

Did this basically as written, except for using a combination of lobster and shrimp and cutting to 1/4 t cayenne as strongly recommended by others - and that was still a little much. Excellent, I'm making it again today - 2 days later as a christmas starter.

This was a wonderful soup. I took the advice of another reader and reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp and only used one carrot. The flavour was amazing and definitely didn't need to be hotter. I used spot prawns and used the head and shells for the stock. Because the heads are included in the weight I had to use more prawns. My blender stick did a great job of processing and I didn't feel it needed to be strained. I put a puddle of unsweetened whipped cream and a little piece of lemon to garnish and it was definitely restaurant quality. I'll be making again for sure.

Excellent soup but a little too much carrot; I would cut back to one or two.

Simply the best. Well worth the time and effort. (I omitted the lemon, personal preference).

Made this for our Christmas eve 1st course. Very happy with the outcome. Used sherry on hand instead of pernod (hate buying bottles for 1/2 cup). Adjusted recipe for 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne and it was just right. Family is already asking when I'll make it again.

I've made variations of this recipe time and agan. I suggest allowing extra time for reduction, to provide a richer bisque. I think there is also a challenge in allowing some of the alcohol to burn or round off and yet still have the essence of the Pernod remaining in perfect balance with the other flavors. The liqeuer is a nice alternative to typical brandy found in other recipes.

I thought this was good--others really liked it, which is why I'm saying I'd make it again. This felt like a lot of labor. The flavor was good. The texture was not as smooth as I'd have liked and was much thicker than I'd expected; I probably should have thinned it a bit.

I made this for a recent "gourmet group" dinner party the other week and it was a big hit. Such rich flavors and just a hint of the Pernod, which gives it an added depth. I decreased the amount of cayenne pepper and was glad I did so. I think it provides a nice counterpoint, but too much of it would just be a distraction. We served it with a beautifully complex pinot gris from Alsace and it was a great pairing. THis is definitely going into the "keeper" pile and I have already received several requests for the recipe.

This was really elegant, a tasty way to begin the Easter meal, and the house smelled great!

Very good and tasty soup-I agree that only a dash of Cayenne is needed to give this recipe a "kick"

The printed recipe in Gourmet April 2001 says, "1/8 teaspoon cayenne".

I've adjusted this recipe over the years. The secret is the stock. I double the amount, and reduce it by half,for a more intense flavor. My family also prefers sautern over pernod.

Too much pepper and not enough flavor. This proved to be a serious disappointment after reading the other reviews.

Very rich and flavorful. I also cut the cayenne by half but added a tblsp more tomato paste and also added two diced roma tomatos. We increased the recipe to serve 12 and everyone loved it.

Bisque is delicious, velvety smooth and a lovely color, too. I only used 1/4 tsp. of cayenne and it was just the right amount -- zippy but not overwhelming. I also think that 3/4 tsp. would have been way too much. I was a bit disappointed that the flavor of the Pernod pretty much disappeared, but the overall taste was very nice. I will be making this as the first course for Christmas dinner.

I made this for my Easter dinner as an appetizer. Everybody loved it!! I might suggest to cut back a little bit on the cayenne pepper. Some found the heat took away from the smooth, delicate taste of the Pernod. I was surpised how easy it was to make! Make sure you get the shrimps with heads still on them. They really add to the flavour.
