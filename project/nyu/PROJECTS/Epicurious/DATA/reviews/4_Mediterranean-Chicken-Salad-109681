I made this recipe to take on a camping trip. It was a big hit with all my family.

I made exactly as written but had to use white wine vinegar as the stores didn't have tarragon vinegar. I emulsified the dressing with an immersible blender and that may be why I didn't experience the oilyness. All in all a great salad. I will try the dried cranberries and add toasted pine nuts next time just to change it up.

This is my favorite chicken salad recipe and I share it with everyone. It's great as a salad supper on HOT summer days. Fresh tarragon is essential and I double the amount of orzo, using whole wheat orzo pasta.

This is one of my favorite spring time meals! I love to have it on hand, walk out to the garden, snip some fresh lettuces and there's lunch! Add some homemade croutons and you have a very hearty dinner! I do cut back on the olive oil as well - about 4TBS and use a mix of white wine vinegar and red wine vinegar and add basil instead of tarragon (just because I never have fresh tarragon on hand)

My husband and I thought this salad was delicious. Like other readers suggested reduced olive oil to 4 Tb. and increased orzo to one cup. Fresh tarragon is a must!

This was very disappointing for a "Blue Ribbon" recipe. When you dig into the comments you see that almost everyone that loved it made lots of changes. First try, I followed it exactly and found it rather bland. Second try, I added extra dijon to the dressing, diced red peppers for some crunch, and feta cheese. It was much better but still not a blue ribbon recipe in my book.

Rating: 2
Kind of a disappointment. The dressing was a little too oily, and with the oil from the kalamata, and artichokes it made the salad a little greasy. The flavor grew on me but at first it was a little funky.

This was pretty good. Kids (3 & 5)ate it, but they weren't crazy about it. Made a few modifications with what I had on hand: Used red wine vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar, omitted tarragon since I didn't have any, used dried cranberries for currants, and sun-dried tomatoes instead of capers. I also added some feta cheese as some other reviewers suggested, but after doing so, wished I hadn't. I would definitely make again without feta and would like to try it with the tarragon vinegar and tarragon.

This really was quite good. I made it with several other salads for a luncheon. Since I'm a vegetarian I used a bag of Morningstar Chix Strips, and it worked beautifully.

I made this for my garden club. I didn't change anything although it was difficult for me to toss the currants in with the olives and capers. One of my friends who is preparing the food for her daughters wedding has decided to use this as her chicken salad recipe

I enjoyed this recipe, even though I had to alter it in a big way because I couldn't find many ingredients (I'm new to living in Buenos Aires). The changes I made were: I used balsamic vinegar, I used herbs de provence, I used a small pasta instead of orzo, I replaced artichoke hearts with garbanzo beans. Even with the adjustments it turned out fantastic! Great flavor.

Rating: 4
This recipe was incredibly easy and incredibly tasty. The biggest change I made was with the chicken. I didn't have pre-cooked chicken so I cut some chicken thighs into small cubes like the recipe called for and stir-fried those in a wok with olive oil and red cooking wine. I then made the liquids and mixed all of them with the orzo, subsituting a little red wine for tarragon vinegar and less olive oil because I cooked the chicken in that. This was instead of mixing part of the sauce with the chicken and part of it with the orzo. I would also recommend using much much more than 1/2 cup of orzo. Definitely more than two cups as the orzo extends the dish and gives it a base.

Rating: 1
The only thing that I liked about this recipe was that it was quick and easy and took less than 1 hour start to cleanup. I wan't crazy about the dijon mustard along with the salty olives. The basic idea was nice but I need a different marinade for my taste.

Rating: 3
I used Balsamic vinegar, 4 tablespoons olive oil instead of 6 and dried cranberries instead of currants and those were my only changes. I served it over baby spinach because it's what I had, but would have liked something crunchy. I thought this was pretty good, but not as great as the other reviews made it seem. I'm betting it will be better tomorrow after having partied in the bowl overnight.

This has been one of our family favorites ever since I first made it a couple of years ago. It's a great pot luck dish. Sometimes I make it as written; sometimes substitute dried cranberries for the currants and add pistachios; when I'm back on Phase I of the South Beach Diet I leave out the orzo. It's good with whole wheat orzo, too.

This recipe was wonderful. So flavourful and easy to make. I did not have tarragon but used herbs provence. I also used balsamic vinegar. For the chicken I just bbq'd chicken breasts, cooled and cubed. L also added sundried tomatoes and feta. Served on butter lettuce with a baguette and roasted garlic. Yum. This is my new signature salad.

I don't understand all of the rave reviews for this recipe. It was edible, but certainly nothing special. I followed the recipe exactly, so I can't blame it on any changes I made. It was just kind of bland and tasteless.

My family all looked at me very skeptically when I told them what I'd made, and very cautiously took their first bites. After that, it was clear sailing and they even ended up having seconds!! Also didn't tell them I'd used Dreamfields low carb pasta penne instead of regular pasta (instead of orzo). Since they are not very adventuresome, even though I doubled the recipe (cutting back on the oil as most have done), I did only use one jar of artichoke hearts (cut up), used 3T capers (cut up), used fewer tomatoes (I am the ONLY one who likes fresh ones), added cubes of mozz (couldn't get to the store for fresh as planned), used craisins (they picked them out mostly), added a little garlic to the dressing. Oh, used fresh basil (lots)and balsamic vinegar since I didn't have tarragon (that's not a fav), fresh oregano, and a little Italian parsely in the dressing and let it sit for about 6 hours before mixing it with the left over grilled (brined) chicken breast and pasta. Not bland (be sure to add salt and pepper to the dressing and then when serving). Very yummy! Will be fighting over the scant leftovers today! Will try with the tarragon vinegar and fresh tarragon next time. They all said it was a keeper!

This recipe is delicious. And it's even better after it sits a day. I used leftover grilled chicken which added to the flavor.

I thought this recipe was good, but not great. I don't know what exactly is "Mediterranean" about it. Way too much olive oil/dressing as the recipe reads. Still this is a good use for leftover chicken (and quick!) so will probably be trying it again.

Yum! Delicious. I substituted sun dried tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes. Would use though in season.

Rating: 4
We LOVE this dish. Typically use much more orzo than called for & a larger jar of artichokes, but whatever the proportions, it is all good! We have used both Tarragon & Balsamic Vinegar. Tarragon is more mild if you are eating right away, but balsamic seems better the next day. More often than not, we throw in Tyson's already cooked diced chicken breast, which means the only thing you're cooking is the orzo! We have frequently increased the quantity for guests & parties. A favorite in our house.

Excellent. I didn't use all the dressing to keep it light. Will use on a salad another day. Didn't have tarragon vinegar, used sherry vinegar; just fine. Big raves from all who enjoyed it. EASY.

This was good. I made the following changes: red wine vinegar in lieu of tarragon, grape tomatoes in lieu of cherry, 2c chicken because I was using leftovers and that's all I had. I used 1c each of roasted chicken and a chicken I had marinated and BBQ'd a few nights earlier. Once the sauce was added, the BBQ chicken was indistinguishable from the roasted. Currents could be left out, but I would encouraage you to try it with them first. Sun-dried tomatoes would also be good. One note, I took the 1/2c orzo to be a pre-cooked measurement and the ratio was fine. Though not necessary, I would also encourage you to serve over butter lettuce as shown in the photo but not listed in the directions. It would add a crispness to the dish.

Rating: 4
I've made this soooo many times - each time a little differently. It's good as written, but my favorite is with white balsamic vinegar and fresh basil. Omit artichokes, add feta and baby spinach, double the dressing and make it the day before, letting it sit in the fridge overnight to soak up the flavors. Add extra dressing and grape tomatoes before serving.

Delicious. I had planned on making the chicken, but ran out of time and picked up a rotisserie chicken at the market. I still enjoyed the recipe with all of the other ingredients. I will keep this on hand for future meals and try it from scratch.

This is an excellent summer go to meal. The dressing is light and tangy but better if you cut the olive oil to 3 tbsp and add 2 tbsp of water and 1 additional tbsp of lemon juice so you have enough to coat the salad. I also added some pepperoncini rings for spice and served on a bed of fresh spinach. Very good.

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious! A great base recipe to substitute whatever sounds good. I made a few changes: red wine vinegar and basil (I didn't have tarragon). I also added feta and sundried tomatoes-yum, and baby spinach. I think this would be great with couscous or bulgar wheat instead of orzo, too. And it would be healthier. Great weekday staple!

I made this for our neighborhood Christmas luncheon and everyone really enjoyed it. Quite a few people asked me for the recipe. The only changes I made were in cutting the amount of oil by 1/2, and because I did not have tarragon vinegar, I used white balsamic instead. I'd make this one again for sure.

Made this for a refreshing and light dinner on a hot summer night in Northern Virginia. My husband and I both liked it and would fix it again. We also used the balsamic vinegar, basil, and lots of garlic. We used 1/2 the oil suggested in the original recipe. I toasted some pine nuts and sprinkled them on top.

I loved this salad as written. After reading the reviews, I decided to try a few new things. I definitely keep the tarragon, the taste is so much better than the other herbs I tried. I tried dried blueberries as one reviewer suggested, and they were good, but currants or unsweetened cranberries are cheaper and just as good. Definitely halve the oil, you just don't need it all. I sometimes add fresh mozzarella balls halved (forget what they're called), and black olives instead of kalamata. The best addition I've made though, and one I will never skip again, is to add a big bunch of chopped fresh spinach. It adds a beautiful color, not to mention the health factor. So good. I urge you to try it.

Love this recipe for a great summer meal or picnic...you can make changes to suit your taste. We took it to a concert in the park the other night and there wasn't a bite left. Following the suggestions of other cooks, I did make a few changes. Used 3/4 cup orzo, white balsamic vinegar instead of tarragon. I have a huge tub of basil in my garden, so substituted that for tarragon and also chopped another handful and added to the salad. Also used dried cranberries, toasted pine nuts and feta cheese. If you have a Trader Joe's available, their Israeli feta is the bomb. It's very creamy rather than dry and crumbly and addicting! This is so yummy and something I'll make often this summer. Add a crunchy baguette, a chilled glass of white wine and go to heaven.

Broke my rule to serve something that I haven't pre-tested. No problem, BF loved it!! I followed the great ideas/advice of other cooks and made some slight changes that worked deliciously. Cooked 3 skinless chicken breasts in small amount of olive oil & butter w/ oregano, sage, garlic- cooled then chopped. Used 4 T. oil, balsamic vinegar, basil, 3/4 C. orzo, grape tomatoes, black olives, dried cranberries, pine nuts and Trader Joe's marinated fresh mozzarella. Chopped the capers (love the flavor but don't like them whole), artichoke hearts, cheese before adding to everything else. Added lots of salt and pepper. Chilled for several hours and served in bowl of romaine leaves. Looked gorgeous and tasted absolutely delicious! Every bite was complex and addictive. Yummy! Next time will serve on a bed of chopped romaine and baby spinach to round out the meal and add "greens". The salad was moist enough w/ the 4T. of oil (even the next day) that it wouldn't need additional dressing. Make it and enjoy!!

The tarragon had a great taste, but otherwise this was a greasy, unappetizing mess. I thought it would improve overnight, but the next day at lunch it was worse.

Rating: 4
I made this with a few changes the other night, mostly because i mistakenly bought bone in chicken breasts, so i didn't cut them up but served them with the orzo. I added a bit of feta, roasted an orange pepper for additional color and added toasted pine nuts. My basil plants haven't produced much, so I didn't have basil, but I did have tarragon. It was good, but much much better the next day for lunch. Will definitely make this all summer.

Made this both ways - as written and with basil and balsamic vinegar. The basil/balsamic version was good, but the tarragon version was so much better - it had a very fresh taste. Like other reviewers, used only 3T of olive oil. Will definitely make again.

This was really good. I grilled three marinated (olive oil and crushed garlic)breast halves, and I used canned artichoke hearts in water. The fresh tarragon made this dish. Maybe shave some parmesan on top?

This turned out very yummy! I only did 1/4 kalamata and then did 1/4 green olives. I added one garlic clove and fresh spinich. I skipped the currents and used pasta instead of orzo. I added some parm cheese and next time will add toasted pine nuts. Good pasta salad.

Made this for a potluck and everyone wanted the recipe. Definately a keeper - simple light and healthy. Great summer salad.

Perfect summer salad, so simple and so good. Just about any fresh herbs will do, although tarragon seems most fitting, and I use balsamic when I don't have tarragon vinegar, and it's just as good. I also use whole black olives which I prefer and dried cranberries (I'm not a huge fan of currants, and crasins are too sweet, methinks). This recipe makes a huge batch, and it's even better as leftovers, although the best thing to do is add the tomatoes when you're serving it, because they lose their great texture in the fridge.

This was just an average vinegar based salad. Nothing wrong, but nothing exciting. I may try grilling chicken breasts marinated in the dressing next time, and serving them warm over the cold orzo salad atop fresh baby spinach.

I made this last night with a few substitutions - had some fresh basil on hand so I substituted that for the tarragon. Added some crumbled feta and steamed green beans. I thought it was delicious and very very easy for a weekenight meal. My husband thought the dish was somewhat bitter - but I think he was reacting to the olives - - which I now know - he detests! Onto the next experiment....

I made this recipe for the first time a couple of years ago, and it is one of my standby recipes. I use a whole box of orzo (about 4 times more than called for), no currants, and serve it on a bed of baby spinach. Love it--the tarragon flavor is fabulous!

I made this salad the night before, which worked out well. The flavors were nicely combined. However, it wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be, maybe because I did not use tarragon vinegar (I substituted white wine vinegar).

Loved it--with the changes suggested by others. Balsamic viniger, basil & craisens. Dried blueberries would have been good, but not at $6.99 for about 8 ounces. Added pinenuts. Can see toasted almonds as well. And green onions. As good as any I've gotten at an up-scale deli. And loved that I could make it the night before. Will cut down a tad on the oil next time.

This was phenomenal. Fresh and light and summery. I couldn't imagine how the disparate flavors would come together, but in taste, texture, color, everything was perfect. I used half the olive oil the recipe called for, had balsamic instead of tarragon, cranberries instead of currents, and I tossed in a handful each of feta and pistachios. Mmm.

This is a great summer salad! The flavors are exceptional. Served this for lunch and got rave reviews. Since my local grocery didn't have their roasted chickens done when I shopped for ingredients, I picked up a package of 3 boneless,skinless chicken breasts and sauteed them in olive oil, tarragon, salt and pepper until cooked through. Couldn't find currants at the store, but will try the dried cranberries next time.

This recipe was great! I followed some earlier suggestions and used basil and balsamic vinegar (what I had in the house) and it ended up being spectacular. To save a bit of money, I used chicken tenderloins (about 7) and marinated them in olive oil, lemon juice and basil for about 45 minutes before broiling/steaming them in a tin foil packet for 25 minutes. It gives a little more flavor to the meat. Also, I tried to do 1.5 times the recipe to stretch it, as some said it wasn't much. I ended up using 2 cups of orzo to stretch it REALLY far, but 1.5 times the dressing was plenty to keep all the chicken and pasta flavorful, even after an overnight in the fridge. I loved this salad!

Rating: 4
I have made this once with some changes. I deleted the olives, currents, and capers (I don't care for these ingredients) and added roasted red peppers. The fresh tarragon is a must (I had some in the garden) although I would be tempted to try fresh basil, too. After I made this salad, I wished I had some feta to throw in it. I also used a roaster chicken from the market to save on prep time. The only complaint is that the servings are scimpy--my husband and daughters were looking for more and were disappointed that there were none. I will probably do 1 1/2 times the recipe next time.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe many times but always left out the currants. I love the taste and mix of ingredients. Since I don't keep tarragon vinegar, I microwave a few shakes of dried tarragon in the white wine vinegar for 10 seconds or so. Works great. Recently, I substituted quinoa for the orzo to add more nutrition. Wonderful! Quinoa never tasted better and you can leave out the chicken for a vegetarian/vegan option.

good summer time dinner, nice and lite. I made it as written and served it over fresh spinach. My husband and I loved it.

Love this! Like most others, I delete ingredients that I am not a fan of (currants) and add those that I am (sliced scallions). In a hurry - canned chicken breast is a time saver. Drain well. I add the tomatoes just before serving because they do drain into the salad if kept overnight - or serve over sliced tomatos, and I top with a bit of crumbled Feta before serving. Great to take for lunch with toasted pita chips. (PS - there is also a wonderful tri-color orzo available - plain, sundried tomato and spinach) that make this even more tasty and pretty.

I would recommend this salad, would be a great entertaining dish or after work (doesn't take long to make).

YUM! so quick, especially if you buy a bbq chicken from the store. Used balsamic vinegar instead of taragon, and basil.

this was really yummy. i only used 4 tablespoons of olive oil and substituted balsamic vinegar and dried sage. i shredded the chicken because cubed seems so processed. Dont use all the dressing right off the bat, add about 1/2 then taste. i made a bowl out of lettuce leaves like in the picture. not only was it prettier, but it made a refreshing crisp at the end of the meal. Also, there were only dried wild blueberries in the cabinet, no currants. this is a very yummy, gourmet-tasting, summer dinner.

No leftovers at my housewarming party! Everyone really like this. I did some changes though and want to share a tip: I used normal chicken on the bone but it took so long. Next time I will use chicken breast/filet without the bone. I used dates instead of currants, warning sweet, use a little less. This really makes the complex flavor of the recipe! Last, I put lots of orzo (had to cook for 50 people and needed more filler.) This means upping the amount of dressing. Yummy yummy!

Have made this a few times. Loved it more each time. What is best about this is the ability to tweak the ingredients towards your preference. For me, I found rotisserie chick a bit greasy, so I add poached chicken breasts. I also do dates instead of currants, and add in chick peas. One tip, though, I add extra dressing. Good cold and warm.

I rated it as two forks because my dinner guest liked it although I did not. I read through the reviews first (one of the BEST things about this site!) so I thought I was prepared for the results. It seemed a bit oily to me, although I did decrease the amount of olive oil a bit. I think it was the tarragon that got to me...I suppose I like the IDEA of tarragon more than the taste itself :-) It really overpowered the salad and left the other ingredients just lurking in the background. I don't expect to make this again and hope to find something else in the Chicken Salad category to try for the future.

It's much better made with balsamic vinegar and fresh basil.

I want to try this for my gourmet/book group but I'm not sure what else to serve with it. I would appreciate any suggestions.

To the tomato allergic cook; if it's only the fresh ones, perhaps try sundried. Otherwise, it seems that a good red pepper might be a good substitute. Be daring and put in the foods you like; a recipe is only a springboard for your imagination!

Skipped the tomatoes and added a jar of Italian marinated vegetables I had on hand. ALso used tapenade instead of olives and artichokes and chopped dates instead of currants. Wonderfully variable.

This recipe really sounds like it's worth trying but I have a problem: I'm allergic to raw tomatoes. Does anyone have any great substitute ideas for that ingredient? Thanks!

I have made this dish several times, served it to my Gourmet Group and have been asked for the recipe many times. It is a wonderfully fresh, easy summer salad and I love all the ingredients ! It is most forgiving in that you can add or subtract items as you wish. The first time I made it, I followed directions. After that, I added whatever I had that was similiar and never had a failure. Love this recipe !!

I followed advice from many other reviewers and LOVED the result, especially after a day or two of letting the flavors come together more. I reduced the oil to 3-4 Tbsp., used white vinegar (all I had) instead of the tarragon vinegar, and added no tarragon or currants. I added toasted pine nuts, feta cheese crumbles, grape tomatoes (instead of cherry), a small can of chopped black olives (much easier), fresh chopped cucumber from our garden, 4 freshly chopped basil leaves, and chopped wilted spinach. The artichoke hearts and capers (as well as lemon juice, mustard, etc.) give the whole dish a wonderful flavor. I also added cold steamed string beans, but that wasn't such a great addition. Thanks for all the tips!

I made this dish as instructed with the exception of Thompson raisins instead of currents. The combination of flavours was wonderful and especially loved the texture of the raisins. If you don't have artichoke hearts, I wouldn't rush to buy them because with all the other flavours going on, they get lost. My only complaint was that I found it had too much dressing (too oily) when I made it, but was great the next day. I don't like too much dressing on salads so next time will make all of the dressing, but will only add enough at the time I eat it. I have made twice in the last week.

I did the exact same thing - used risa instead of the orzo. HEB only had big $6 canisters of orzo. They did have the tarragon vinegar. Marinated some bone-/skinless chicken breasts in olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper for a few hours and baked it. But the rest you just throw together, and it tastes great. Also, i discovered a simple way to pit those Kalamatas. Just smash them with the side of the knife (like how you peel garlic cloves quickly), and then you can just pull the pit out. i intended to serve this on a bed of baby spinach, but didn't have a bag when i was making this. still wanted some greens in the meal though, so used cooked frozen spinach instead which was still good. i would like to try this with the Grilled Pitas with Tomatoes, Olives, and Feta from this site.

Really different! Couldn't find orzo so used risa - same shape, just a smaller pasta. Forgot the Kalamatas and will definitely add them next time. I also think this would be even better adding some oil-packed sun dried tomatoes and a bit more dressing. I used cider vinegar instead of the tarragon, again because I didn't have and couldn't find any. A definite keeper, despite the mess it makes in the kitchen.

I made this a day in advance. The flavors blended wonderfully. I too used dried cranberry instead of current and loved it. I also used plain white vinegar. For the chicken I sauteed boneless/skinless breast meat in a lemon flavor oil. This is a great salad and would definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Exceptional dish - unusual blend of salty, savory and sweet. A bit of a mess to put together - but nothing too difficult. A huge hit with my dinner guests. I also added feta cheese, but probably won't next time. I used golden raisins and will probably do the same next time - perhaps adding a bit more than the recipe. I didn't bother to pit the olives - and this probably cost some flavor. Will buy pitted kalamatas next time. Good good good!

Fantastic and a great summer dish! Sooo easy! I used "Just Chicken" from Trader Joe's (it's boiled chicken, no bones. Just dice and toss into your salad). Forgot to add the currents until we were about 1/3 of the way through and then threw them in. Yummy!

Great recipe. I have made it a couple of times - as is and with some modifications. I used rotini pasta and excluded the chicken to serve as a side salad. The flavours hold overnight - though I kept a bit of dressing in reserve to moisten the salad just before serving.

This was very good. I made a couple minor changes: Used less oil in the dressing, 1 1/2 tsp dried tarragon instead of fresh, raisins instead of currants, and added feta cheese. I will definitely be making this again.

Good to make ahead for a hot summer evening's dinner, although somewhat time consuming to prepare if you cook your own chicken. I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company. I substituted craisins for currants.

I made this exactly as stated, but left out the currants. It was just great! Perfect for a picnic, because the flavors hold together nicely and mellow out over a couple of hours! Wonderful colors and texture and taste!

This is a great summer salad recipe...nice textures, fresh flavor. Served it over chopped romaine. I substituted poached chicken breast, also sub'ed fresh oregano for tarrigon and dried cherries for currents.

used wheat berries,barley & rye as i didn't have orzo on hand-this was delicious and easy; a nice blend of flavors! next time i'll try with orzo.

How harrowing to buy all the ingredients for a "100% would make this again" recipe and then find it down to "94%" on the day you go to make it! But it turned out great, all the thooms in my house loved it (husband, teenager). And then, I went for a long walk, and half way through dreamt about the leftovers......I couldn't find ouzo so I used white rice, and I chopped up some raisins instead of going out again for currants. Thoomalicious!

Rating: 3
Great salad! Very easy and beautiful! I liked that I could use a roasted chicken from the grocery and still have an unusual and great tasting dish. I added extra orzo as well and served the salad over baby spinach and arugula. I want to try with fresh basil next time and add the pine nuts, cucumber and feta. Sounds even better!

This recipe was a marvel. It was ready and on the table in record time. Since I was rushed, I used the homemade vinaigret I already had in the frig and added a bit of the artichoke sauce to taste. Three cheers. "Beyond compare" is a bit hyperbolic I think!

This is a fantastic recipe! My only change was to omit the tarragon (I can't stand it) and replace it with basil, which was perfect. Definitely a keper.

Delicious Salad! I think the addition of currants (or raisins, or cranberries) is a wonderful idea. It adds a little sweetness to offset the rest of the flavors. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
I loved this dish! I made it exactly as written even though I was a bit skeptical about the currants. I think they added just the right amount of sweetness to offset the tang of the vinaigrette. This will definitely go into the keeper file. Next time I will try some of the reader suggestions and add cucumbers and/or feta. Great summer salad.

This was fabulous. I've already made twice this week and passed it on to friends. I followed some of the others suggestions and added feta cheese and fresh herbs from our garden like oregano and basil. Also added fresh cracked pepper and nasturtiums for extra color. Yum!

This was the first recipe from Epicurious that I hated! I ended up throwing this away uneaten. The tarragon flavor was much too strong and I have no idea why I added the currants that were specified -- they did not go with the other flavors at all!

I removed the artichoke hearts and the currants and added thin slices of sweet red peppers. This went over wonderfully for lunch on a lazy, hot Saturday afternoon.

A really great recipe. I tried it on my husband who does not like pasta as a rule, and he still loved it.As one cook said, it's very flexible. Not having tarragon vinegar, I used white wine vinegar, I also added basil, and replaced the currants with canberries, not so sweet.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! Fresh local tomatoes made this really yummy; we mixed yellow and red for more color. Great with or without orzo, and served it on lettuce for a refreshing summer lunch. Didn't have the currants but was great without them. Might also be good with basil or fresh oregano in place of the tarragon.

I love anything Mediterranean, and this will definitely be a regular recipe for the summer. In fact, I'm planning to eat it tonight in the local park with friends. The brilliant thing is its flexibility -- so many things you can add or change. To make the dressing less sour, I added a bit of sugar (just enough to take the edge off, not to make it sweet).

Added some toasted pine nuts. Delicious.

I had to try this recipe because of all the 4 fork reviews and that 100% would make it again. Now I know why! It far exceeded my expectations and my husband loved it. An excellent main-course salad for hot summer nights. I'd definately serve this to company.

Greatly enjoyed this - perfect salad for a summer weeknight - nice blend of sweet, salty and tangy. To answer DC's question - I think a plain white wine vinegar would be a fine substitution - just add a bit more of the fresh tarragon because it does add a nice flavor.

Thanks "A Cook from Kirkland, Washington on 07/29/04!" It really worked! I only thought changing the text size was only for viewing, but it really did print smaller. Not only is it more cost effective on paper, but also cost effective on expensive toner for my laser printer as well. Thank you very much!

If you think you will need two pages because of the top comments, simply go to print-ready, then change the size of your text to "smaller" or "smallest". I just printed this wonderful recipe using "smaller" on one page, made it "as is" and loved every bite.

Looking for something to do with some cold roast chicken, I came upon this dish and made it, though I found to my dismay that I was out of tarragon. I made it anyway, and substituted another Mediterranean flavor, oregano. If I had to substitute again, I would use basil, which has more of tarragon's sweet sort of flavor, but even with the oregano, this salad was delicious. My husband, for whom chicken is little more than a necessary evil, loved it and looked for it again at lunch the next day.

This is absolutely scrumptious. I did omit the cherry tomatoes (because I'm not fond of them). I would definitely make again and again.

My husband is not as much a fan of olives and tomatos as I am, but I prepared this anyway because I know he is a huge fan of tarragon. He loved it and even asked for extra. It is a delicious dish.

Thanks Paulette, for the great recipe, I made it tonight for dinner. I for one am glad you added your comments to the recipe, it's always more interesting to me when someone includes background information. I don't actually use the print function to print or copy recipes, I hit the print button and then copy the recipe and put it into a word processor, that way I can edit out anything I don't want.

The recipie is great, but EPICURIOUS should format these things to save paper. What should print on 1 page (with room to spare) the editors have slopped over onto 2 pages. Let's save some trees!

Hi Marlene- use the Printer Ready Recipe function located in the upper right corner. It doesn't include the 'background' and you won't waste a tree.

Absolutely exceptional!! We just finished it for dinner. I'd serve this to the Queen of England. It's absolutely perfect without any substitutions. My wife made one delicious addition, though: spinach, which was the perfect foil to the slightly tangy dressing. It'd also work great with arugula. Elegant, sophisticated, delicious. Can't recommend it highly enough. It'll be a family favorite for years.
