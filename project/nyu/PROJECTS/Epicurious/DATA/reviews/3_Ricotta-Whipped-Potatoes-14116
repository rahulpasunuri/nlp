I loved these. So did my hubby. HOWEVER, altered them quite a bit. I use 2 c of ricotta, added 1/2t crushed fennel seed, 1t oregano, 1/2T salt, a pinch of nutmeg, 1 clove crushed garlic & Black pepper to taste to the ricotta. Served with butter "patties." Cut milk to 1/3c. Whipped them up & ate every last bite!

I made this because I had a ton of ricotta I needed to use so for that purpose, they were fine. You can barely taste the riccotta and I put a lot more in than the recipe calls for. I almost think it would be better to just serve with the ricotta on top as the heat of the potatoes did go well with the creamy cool of the ricotta. All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to make these but if you need to use up your cheese, it's not a total waste.

Also too the advice of others and used less milk, more ricotta and baked in the oven. Big hit in our house. My kids loved the twist on thier favorite..mashed potatoes.

Took the suggestions of others in mind and used less milk and a bit more ricotta. Also added some chives. While mine didn't end up too runny, I did opt to bake the potatoes while the steak grilled. Baking seemed to actually bring out the flavor a bit more as the dish was somewhat more intense than when I tasted it before putting it in to bake. Forgot about adding some garlic, but will try that next time. My husband especially thought this was very good.

I made this last night, and I have to say I was remarkably unimpressed. It wasn't bad, but there was nothing to recommend it either. I really couldn't taste the ricotta all that much, and it seemed like a waste of an effort to dress up mashed potatoes - they didn't taste like anything special.

I doubled the amount of Ricotta and these were a huge hit - especially with the boys!

Fixed this as a side dish for smoked tenderloins and a spinach salad. Perfect! I used red potatoes and didn't peel them or use a ricer--just mashed 'em. Pressed & mixed in 3 cloves fresh garlic per others' suggestions and then baked covered at 300 degrees while the steaks cooked. Rave reviews! Not watery at all. Next time may try subbing some sour cream for some of the ricotta to reduce the (to-me) slightly too-earthy taste.

Yum. I served for a dinner party with a first course of Garlic Soup and salad. Main course was prime rib, garlic brussel sprouts and potatoes, I wanted something flavorful, but not too much garlic. This was perfect. I added some fresh garlic cloves to the boiling water while potatoes cooked. I also added some grated parmesan cheese and some chives after the potatoes were whipped. I ate the left overs for lunch the next day and liked them even better.

I altered the recipe because it sounded bland. I cut 1 clove of garlic in slices then let that cook in the pot while the potatoes were boiling. Then added the suggested amount of ricotta and butter then added the milk last so they would not be runny (as people mentioned before). For me this was pretty good but needed lots of pepper and salt. More garlic could be used also.

Outstandiing, especially when I added a bulb of roasted garlic to the mix.

I thought this sounded really good, and maybe I did something wrong, but my potatoes came out very liquidy and didn't taste like much of anything but milk. I added lots of salt & pepper, which helped, but the texture was still poor. Less milk would probably help a lot, but I don't think I'll bother again. I was really just trying to use up some leftover ricotta!
