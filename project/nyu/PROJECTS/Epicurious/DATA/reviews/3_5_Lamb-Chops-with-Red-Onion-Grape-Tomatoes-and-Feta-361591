Embarrassed I made this for my fiance. Horridly disgusting, oily, and a awful cut of meat.

Delicious recipe! Tastes like it came right out of a restaurant kitchen. Very impressive and easy to make. A big hit!

Despite having to settle for whatever cuts of lamb I could find, this turned out quite nice. Served over orzo I had tossed with lemon juice and dill. Super easy and looks amazing on the plate.

Really greasy! I'd not use shoulder blade chops if I ever make this again - maybe a loin. Also, I think it needed a bit more lemon juice. As another reviewer said, I added spinach with the tomatoes.

Excellent. Easy. Impressive. I prepared 8 chops, but kept the dressing amount the same to resolve the aforementioned greasiness. After adding the tomatoes to the pan, I also added spinach, wilting slightly. Plated over Lebanese couscous (larger than pearl). Used marinated feta instead. A super easy, beautiful meal worthy of company.

This dish came out rather greasy, perhaps because I over-drizzled the reserved dressing. Otherwise it was good but not spectacular. I'll probably give it another try to see if I can make it less oily, but at this point it's not my favorite.

rated 2 forks for having to use shoulder blade lamb chops. Not much meat, fatty and grizzly. The flavor are a 3 - very tasty. Going to see if I can find another type of chop
