I could only find frozen pearl onions which was fine. I made a side dish of roasted haricot verts with onions and garlic drizzle with olive oil and a side of quinoa. The lamb was so tender and delicious elevated by the flavor of the dates and honey. Easy recipe. Just lovely.

I eliminated the cilantro. We loved the sweetness of the dates. Served with orzo.

An intriguing dish, a great combination of sweet and savory flavors. I did most of the work in the middle of the day, then reheated the lamb in the sauce at dinnertime. The flavor of dates is strong, I was happy I boosted the other spices to balance the flavor. I was also glad I omitted the saffron, as it probably would have gotten lost in the mix. I added some tumeric and cumin, both of which contrasted the dates nicely. I also found I used much more liquid than called for, as the dates soak it up rather quickly. I served it with couscous and a greek salad, a nice pairing.

I really liked this recipe. I added almost double the cilantro and parsley, put 1/2 tablespoon less of honey and a few less dates per reviewer's recommendations. I also substituted beef stew meat for the lamb. Delicious, and not too sweet at all.

I doubled the spiecs as someone suggested but it was not of interest to anyone at my dinner table. I was glad a dinner guest my husband had planned to bring home to dinner was unable to come at the last minute. I will find another recipe for lamb as this one needs to be tossed!

If you love dates as I do, this is deliciously sweet. The honey could be reduced and the cilantro disappeared between all the dates. Maybe leave it out altogether and add a bit more cinnamon.

I've made this recipe 4 times but added lemon juice and slices to the recipe...I have had nothing but rave reviews...even from people who swear they hate lamb.

Fantastic, I made it during the day and just re-heated it when my guests arrived. Doubled up on the spices to give it a better flavour. Served it with curried couscous, and cucumber, tomato & red onion salad with mint. A perfect meal.

I've been making this dish for a few years now. Everyone loves it. I've found if I use leg of lamb instead of shoulder and trim the fat carefully the flavors blend very nicely.

Really tastey. It's a bit too sweet though, so next time I'd cut down on the honey.

We were very unhappy with the results. The flavors were not well balanced. Lamb usually takes up the marinated flavors quite well but in this recipe the sauce was too sweet and the lamb was rather unremarkable. I have travelled in Morocco and found their tagine dishes, which I adored, prepared very differently. Try again!

After reading the other reviews, I was disappointed in the results. We love lamb, enjoy fruited meats, but this just didn't work. The dates dominated and overpowered all other flavors. We followed the recipe, but it seemed as if there were no other dimensions to this dish but the cloying flavor of dates: couldn't detect the cinnamon or ginger, nor the cilantro. With all the other recipes out there, we won't be bothering with this one again.

OK - so it's a lot of work seeding the dates and peeling the pearl onions, but well worth it!!! I made it for a going away party and it was a total hit. Raves and more raves. I did all of the prep work the night before - so I just had to throw the ingrediants together after work and before the party. Served it with lentils and spinach.

I personally think is recipe is excellent, but my wife swears that it was the best thing I ever made. Perhaps even the best thing she ever ate. Something about the sweet and tangy flavors made her ecstatic.

I made this dish for my family but used golden raisins instead of dates which I do not care for. Everyone loved it!! I will make this dish again for company and serve it again with saffron rice as I did today.

I made this for a group of friends and it was delicious but alot of work. It was definitely aromatic (I had to air out my apartment all day) but it was worth it. It wowed. Special dish.
