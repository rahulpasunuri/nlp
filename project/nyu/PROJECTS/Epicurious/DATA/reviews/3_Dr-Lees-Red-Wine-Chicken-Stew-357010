Followed this recipe pretty close to the original as those were the ingredients I had on hand and the reason I chose to try this recipe. In short it should be avoided. The flavor was not too bad after a few tweaks. After finishing off the remainder of the wine I was able to choke a bowl of it down. The chicken took on a comically purple tint, the texture was terrible, I really wish I had that cup of wine back.

Great, simple and easy. I threw in some yukon gold potatoes to thicken it up a bit and also let it simmer about half an hour longer than suggested. Will definitely make this again.

"1 tbsp olive oil "4 cloves of garlic, mashed "1 cup chopped tomatoes "2 boneless chicken breasts cut into 2" cubes "1 sliced onion "1 cup sliced mushrooms "3/4 cup madeira plus 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar "1 cup chicken stock (1 cup water plus 1/2 chicken or vegetable bouillon cube) "1/2 tsp thyme 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes -------------------------------I thought this recipe seemed like it would need more flavor, as did some other reviewers, so I adjusted it as above. The extra garlic and red pepper flakes gave it more pizzaz, and using madeira instead of plain red wine gave it a richer flavor. This would also be great with boneless, skinless thighs.It was a big hit.

I agree with HollyW, its good recipe to play with. I used less wine, added some flour close to end to make it more thick and also used basil. I decided not to use parmesan and was not missing it. Served with homemade crispy bread and got success. Next time i will probably also add shallot to the stew.

Also, you can try cutting the wine a bit and adding balsamic vinegar-a couple tbsps or so to taste, if you like that balsamic-y flavor more

This can be a very tasty recipe, if you play with it a little. I used green onions and used rosemary instead of thyme-though i'm sure it'd be good w/both. Also added lots of freshly ground pepper and some parmesan cheese and fresh torn basil as garnish. I served it with sliced crusty bread, lightly buttered and baked at 350 for 10min, then rubbed with a garlic clove. That REALLY made the dish.

I did not care for this recipe. Tried it exactly as written. For me, it turned out very watery - more like a wine soup. unappealing color - there are much better recipes available.

This was pretty good considering it is very healthy. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I would cut down on the wine to 1/2 cup. I chopped up the chicken before serving to make it easier to eat and served it with some whole grain french bread.
