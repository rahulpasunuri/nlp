Maybe all the raving reviews raised my expectations, but I was a little disappointed in these. They were good, but not amazing. I couldn't find the candied orange peel and didn't have time to make my own, so I left that out and increased the orange zest slightly. The orange flavor was pretty strong. I will probably make these again, but again skip the peel, reduce the zest, and try it with almonds. I think almonds would stand up to the other ingredients better.

OMG! These squares are to die for. Very rich and wonderful. Candied orange peel was a bit hard to source locally but found some at the candy store.

I plan to add this recipe to my Yuletide list for gift giving. Lovely orange flavour (thanks perhaps to the home-make candied orange peel). Mistakenly baked the second layer twice as long and it still worked out well. Since I enjoy a more bite-sized treat, I cut the squares into triangles and dipped the long side of each. Pretty and now, plentiful too!

Very easy to make and delicious every time. If you do not have hazelnuts, it is okay with walnuts and almonds. Hazelnuts are the best but if you need to get rid of nuts, do not hesitate to still try them. This recipe is on our list of keepers. We must have made it four or five times in six weeks. WARNING! These may be listed as low-cal since each square is small. However, they are so addictive that it is really hard to stop at one or two. I am active person but I cannot eat any less than 3-6 of these at a time. When I have nothing else in my stomach, I can easily eat 10. They are just so delicious. My girlfriend loves this recipe and it takes a lot less time and effort than the total time says. It is not as hard or time consuming as other recipes. Four forks all the way.

These came out really good! I didnt use a candy thermometer, i just went by the time suggested. Nor did i add any of the orange flavorings,(I dont really like orange flavors) Also, someone suggested toffee chips, and i think that sounds awesome for the next time I make these!

This one's a keeper. I didn't have the candied orange peel, but it tasted great just the same. HUGE hit at a cookie exchange party. Easier to make than I expected, and it wasn't hard at all to peel the foil off the bottom. The hazelnuts make a nice change from the almonds/walnuts/pecans that grace so many holiday recipes. Since butter figures so heavily in this recipe, I recommend using Plugra--it will make a difference. Also, I made half dipped in chocolate and half without, and it tasted great both ways. However, the bittersweet chocolate does make a nice balance to the quite sweet caramel bars.

Phenomenal! I made this recipe twice in a matter of days. Rather than using candied & grated orange peel I used a few drops of orange extract for a light orange flavor. I cut them into small squares and wrapped them in bags to give to friends. Even left off the chocolate on one batch and they tasted just as amazing. A definite keeper!

I made this recipe today as part of my holiday cookie project and am very glad I did. What I did differently: I made my own candied clementine peel using a recipe I found online, I cut the squares into 1-inch size as they are very rich and a little will go a long way. Rather than dipping them, I melted some chocolate chips in the microwave and used a pastry bag with a fine tip to drizzle chocolate on the squares. These are terrific!

I made these once and took to two different parties. They were a hit at both! I am not a big fan of orange flavoring, so I reduced the grated orange peel to 1 tsp and left out the candied orange peel. It still had a strong orange taste. Next time I will leave out the orange all together.
