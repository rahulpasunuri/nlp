Got rave reviews! Omitted the cinnamon and used regular apple juice. Cooked my turkey upside down(breast on the bottom) and it was very juicy. Used pan juices to make gravy and it was yummy. Will keep this recipe for next year!

This recipe is exceptional. Everyone at Thanksgiving, both my family and guests, kept asking what I did to make the turkey so yummy. One guest was raving over the gravy and said it was pure gourmet. I brined my turkey in a cider brine first for a moist turkey, then did this recipe. But, I blended the apples into the gravy for a thicker, smoother gravy and also added one packed tablespoon of brown sugar to reduce the tartness of the apples. The results? AWESOME! I will make this recipe again for Christmas dinner as it has already been requested. Thanks for this great recipe!

I made it with a large roasting chicken. Just fabulous. The family raved and made sure to remind me to bookmark this recipe!

After reading the reviews, I chose this recipe to make my first turkey. I have eaten many different variations on a turkey dinner, but this turkey was the most delicious and moist/juicy that I have ever tasted. My guests raved about it and said that it was the best they ever had as well. I did reduce the apples in the roasting pan, but found that the gravy complimented the turkey beautifully. Highly recommended, I will make this again.

I made this recipe for my annual ' American Thanksgiving dinner in Holland', for family and friends. Oddly enough I am the only American at the table. My table is multi-cultural, like a United Nations gathering, which is fantastic! This recipe received RAVES from ALL my guest. They thought it was nothing short of fabulous. I made a little extra basting liquid and ended up basting the turkey 3 times, including the initial time before starting to roast. The last baste was when I added the apples. I agree with some reviewers, you may cut the apples down, I did by using only 6 apples for a 14 lb turkey. I did brine my turkey for 24 hours, prior to roasting. I had found an apple cider brine on another site, that went well with this recipe. By doing so it just added an unbelieveable moistness to the turkey. It was so good, I barely had any leftovers, as my guest kept going back for more helpings of turkey. I cannot rave enough (nor can my guest) at how wonderful this recipe turnes out. It deserves a standing ovation!

This is the 4th time I've made this turkey and it's still fantastic. It's always moist and takes great. I use a hand blender to make the gravy smoother and it also gets raves.

I have used this recipe every year since I found it! It is our all time favorite, and everyone who has tried it LOVES it, too!

I've been making this since 2002. It is fantastic. The only things I make sure to do are a) brine the bird (it makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE!) b) use fresh herbs c)I start the bird upside down for the first 1/2 and then flip it. d)Salt and pepper a few times throughout. If you have picky people who say things like "well, I really only like a Traditional Turkey" and they insinuate that you are making some exotic hybrid- bird, tell them that they are a barbarian and they are exiled from the kitchen. Then, after their first bite, as the tears of nirvana roll down their faces, you can simply say "Welcome to Thanksgiving!"

The best turkey ever!! We brined our bird before cooking it, but everything else was done exactly per the recipe. The apples taste great with it - we barely had any leftovers. My Dad usually hates turkey, and he couldn't stop eating this one. Definitely a hit!

Used this recipe four years running - great taste and simple to make! Agree with too many apples, and don't like the gravy so much (too sweet), but had a very, very picky 7 yr. old tell me it was the best meat she ever ate! She asked me to please make it again.

I just followed the basting sauce part of this recipe and used the pan drippings as the foundation for the gravy, and it was delicious. Even my mother-in-law the teetotaler said it the best turkey and gravy she'd ever had. For the stuffing I did a traditional breadcrumb base with sauteed apples, onions, celery, and mushrooms plus dried cranberries and fresh sage, thyme, and parsley.

I have made this recipe for the lsat 2 Thanksgivings and my family loved it. I have made it with dried thyme and sage but not as good as fresh. Can't wait to make it again.

One of the best turkey's I've tasted! We have made it twice and it turned out GREAT each time. This last time I tried the gravy. Well the turkey was GREAT anyway! This is the new traditional family bird.

This has become my standard go to recipe for turkey. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. The gravy was complicated, and not worth it. But the apple sage stuffing is amazing. The turkey is fragrant, well seasoned, and slightly sweet. It gets lots of compliments. I have even used this recipe to roast a small breast, just for a change of pace.

I agreed with the other comment about not needing so many apples. I used about 4 large ones. The meal was good and I used a Kosher turkey, but you will need to account for the time it takes to pluck the thing (1 hour with tweasers!). It wasn't worth the effort to have Kosher, but we did have a nice meal!

Ever since I made this turkey 4 years ago at my first holiday dinner, I have scrambled to cook for my family's Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. It's just incredible!

Excellent moist turkey. Didn't use the booze, just the apple cider and was still wonderful. Made it with "Apple Shallot Stuffing". Don't need to use so many apples 3-5 is plently.

One of the best turkey recipes I've ever tried. The sauce is a deep, rich brown and is wonderful with the turkey and mashed potatoes. It was easier to serve the apple slices with the turkey rather than incorporate it into the sauce.

Juciest turkey yet! Thought gravy might be a little sweet, but used MacIntosh apples and flavor was perfect.

This is SO yummy! Juicy and delicious, with a wonderfully delicate aroma of apples. I didn't even need any extra liquid for the gravy, and the meat just fell off the bones. I can't wait for leftovers (and neither can anyone else - we might have more people for leftovers if word-of-mouth kicks in!)

We had this at my cousin's house for Thanksgiving and it was so good I came here to get the recipe for myself. Everyone loved the gravy!

This was my first time making a turkey(acutally made 2 smaller ones). Living in Greece, we decided to have some friends and family for dinner and make it Thanksgivingesque. I chose this recipe because we did not have a chance to get cranberry sauce - it was extremely easy to make and the gravy was delicious. Everyone loved it.

I made this turkey for Thanksgiving last year, and I had absolutely no leftovers! It was delicious and moist, and was a nice alternative to your typical turkey. The apples gave it a wonderful, but subtle, flavor. The only thing I would have done is made more gravy and taken the apples out of the gravy as it made it difficult to pour. Otherwise a great recipe!

This was a hit! The aroma filled the house with apples and cinnamon. I had never made gravy before and was worried that it would not turn out but it was very easy to prepare and my guests said it was the best part. I did not have apple cider but pure apple juice worked fine. I highly recommend this recipe.

This was my first turkey ever, so I was nervous about it (too many horror stories of other people's spectacular turkey failures), but it was absolutely perfect. Fabulous flavor, very moist. It's a fair amount of work, but I think it's worth the effort. The gravy didn't turn out for me -- the apples never quite "dissolved" the way the recipe suggested they would. If I had it over, I'd probably throw the gravy into a blender to smooth it out before serving it.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the best turkey I have ever had. I am not a big turkey fan, but the flavors in this recipe had such great flavors that I am looking forward to making it again. Everyone raved about it.

This was a pleasant surprise! I used a larger turkey and halved again the recipe for the basting sauce and gravy. No question that the gravy was all the rave at the table! A nice Thanksgiving variance. Very delicious! The roasted apples are incredible!

Delicious. I made two turkeys for a party that I just had. One the traditional way (sage, thyme, and bread stuffing) and this one. This was the hit turkey. The aroma during cooking was heavenly. Eating it was even better. It was moist and very tasty. I served it with the Trio of Roasted Potatoes and Wild Rice Salad with pecans, cranberries and apricots (both recipes from this site) and a green salad with raspberries and oranges. I looked like I fussed even though there was NOT a lot of work involved.

Great Recipe--however living in the islands you sometimes you have to improvise--we have Calvados but no apple cider--so I used orange juice--it worked really well--needed to add a touch of sugar to the gravy--but my guests loved it.--Great dish for entertaining and I'll be sure to add it to my recipe file.

After years and years of Mom's same old boring turkey, I decided to throw a curve at my family when they came for a recent family dinner. There were a lot of turned up noses when they first came in and saw what I was doing (What's that different smell?? APPLES in the gravy??). Well, one bite of this turkey and I converted ALMOST everyone (Mom still likes her old standby recipe). The flavor of this recipe was wonderful, and the turkey couldn't have been more moist). My only suggestion is to add a little more cornstarch. I like my gravy just a little thicker. Otherwise, a great recipe.

This was a great recipe, one that will become a tradition in our home for the holidays. For those who do not use alcohol, I left it out and it still tasted fine. I also took the apple slices out after I made the gravy (my little boys would not eat it otherwise) we used it on our potatoes and on the turkey..it was great (it was a little different tasting but really good).

I made this turkey for Christmas and received rave reviews by all! My entire family stated that it was the best turkey they ever had! It was aromatic, moist and very flavorful. Will definitely make again & again!

This is one of the best turkeys I've ever made - it was moist and juicy, and the aroma while it was roasting was heavenly! The gravy was also delicious, and we didn't even need to add the chicken stock because there was more than enough liquid. The combination of apple flavors and fresh herbs was a perfect blend. I will definitely make this one again, and will maybe even use a proportionately reduced version for a roasted chicken.

Sure to be a Christmas favorite. One of the moistest turkeys I've ever made,and the flavor of the apples permeates the turkey. The apple gravy was a hit with everyone but my husband who does not like cooked apples...too bad...more for us! Will definitely make this recipe again.

This Thanksgiving was the first I ever cooked and I made this turkey dish. It came out moist and tasty, I especially liked the gravy with the apples and normally I dont like gravy at all. A good recipe for a first Thanksgiving dinner.
