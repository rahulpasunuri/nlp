Haven't made it but the vanilla panna cotta with cider on Food and Wine is delicious and doesn't use this much cream. I'll try this next.

Very good, but not mind-blowingly delicious. I added some cardamom to the cider gelee, makes it more interesting. I also added some sugar so it wouldn't contrast too strongly with the sweetness of th panna cotta. The tastes blend really well, and it's not difficult to make.
