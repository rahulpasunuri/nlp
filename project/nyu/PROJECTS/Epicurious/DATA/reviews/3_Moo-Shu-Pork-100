Less than thrilling to say the least. Not bad but I'd not bother.

Made this for Chinese New Year. I accidently forgot to buy bean sprouts and it was just fine without. Don't skimp on the bok choy! I doubled the recipe and had the rest for lunch the next day. This is one of those recipes that gets better with age. A good one for kids.

I was expecting this recipe to come out ok but was surprised at how good it was with a few modifications based on feedback on the site. I served this as part of a Chinese dinner and it disappeared amongst the guests who are total foodies and good cooks. I left out the red pepper as I have never seen this in regular mu shu and added more dried shitakes and wood ear tree fungus. Surprisingly I was able to find this at an asian market in Albuqueque so if it can be found here you should be able to find it anywhere! I added about a half a cup of each of these mushrooms (after being reconstituted - drain well) and also some scrambled eggs. Enjoy - easy to make.

There is nothing special about this recipe.

I enjoyed the combination of flavors--with the ginger/garlic/hoisin/soy combo its hard to strike out. Because I live in eastern Europe now I sometimes have to make a whole load of substitutions, but as I said, I think this is a solid performer even if it isn't "authentic." I kept an eye on the moisture level and added some beef stock when it looked like it might dry out too much.

I lost my favorite, quick recipe for Moo Shu Pork so I came to this site to find something similar. After reading the reviews I almost decided not to try this, but I had the ingredients so I went ahead and made it. I used a 16 oz. package of shredded cabbage/carrots used for coleslaw (I doubled the recipe), didn't have any bean sprouts, and substituted sherry for the sake. I tried to make the Mandarin Pancakes also (the first few didn't turn out too well but after that they were really good). It wasn't the "best" I've ever tasted but the kids and husband really liked it. I will make this again just for a bit of variety every once in awhile. Plus I love hoisin sauce!

Being of Chinese descent, I found this recipe very curious as it lacks the ingredient (wood or tree ear) that distinguishes this dish. Moo Shu which refers to the wood or tree ear fungus and the shredded shapes of the vegetables. Since there is no "moo" in this recipe, it should be called mock moo shu pork. I am no cook, but enjoy eating. However, prior comments about the egg (should have) and the ginger (probably a bit much) are right on the money. Traditionally, the scrambled eggs are made into a crepe which is sliced into shreds after cooling and then added back to the dish. The classic vegetable is everyday cabbage, not bok choy, and the other ingredients are reconstitued shiitake mushrooms and bamboo shoots. I admire the attempt to simulate the textural component with bok choy, peppers and bean sprouts - but this dish is correctly a mixed vegetable shredded pork (if you are using pork). But Chinese cooking is mostly about using the ingredients you have on hand and you can get good results with substitutions. However, you can't call this moo shu pork without the critical ingredient (which by the way is supposed to have anti-cancer properties). Just like making coq au vin without the wine. It might be good, but it cannot be called coq au vin.

This dish was just so-so, although I'm not sure what it was missing. I thought it tasted pretty bland and had no depth, but I haven't found any other Moo Shu recipes to replace this with.

This recipe needed a lot of changing, way to much ginger, it overpowered the dish. There wasn't enough cabbage either. I do not recommend this recipe

Nice idea, but didn't work for me. I found the sauce too sweet, I'd rather add the hoisin or other sweet sauce as condiment with the pancake. I agree, scrambled eggs are an inherent part of this dish. If I could have only one or the other, I'd delete the pork and add scrambled eggs on finish.

Recipe forMandarin Pancakes from 2 Hot Tamales...2 cups sifted flour, 3/4 cup boiling water, 1 to 2 tablespoons sesame oil...place flour in a medium bowl, making a well in the center. Pour in the boiling water, and use a wooden spoon to mix until a soft dough is formed. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough gently until it is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. cover with a damp towel and let rest for 20 minutes. On lightly floured surface, roll dough into a log, 16 inches long. Cut the log crosswise into 1 inch pieces, shape each piece into a ball, then use your hands to flatten each ball into a pancake, brush tops of the pancakes lightly with the sesame oil. Place one pancake on top of a second pancake, oiled sides together, so there are 8 pairs. With a rolling pin, flatten each pair into a 6 inch circle. cover with a damp towel to rest. In a ungreased, nonstick skillet over mediuym het, cook pancakes, one at a time, turning once as they puff and bubbles appear on surface, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes on each side. remove from pan and gently separate the halves into 2 pancakes while still hot. Stack on a plate while cooking the rest. Serve while still warm with Mu Shu Pork. Can be prepared in advance, wrapped in plastic, and refrigerated. May be frozen. Reheat by steaming for 5 minutes or warm in 350 degree oven, wrapped in foil for 10 minutes

as a low-sodium food, this doesn't cut it with more than 1000 mg of sodium. i can't possibly make it, as good as it sounds!

If Kevin the Caterer returns or if anyone else knows, please tell me how to make homemade Chinese crepes! How are they different from regular crepes? Tortillas would just be awful in this recipe and since crepes are easy enough to make, I figure make them homemade. Thanks

We make this dish everyday in Chinatown East (Flushing, NY). This is a very good recipe. **Hoisin Sauce** is easy to make yourself. It is nothing more than making a basic BBQ sauce. Brown sugar, rice vinegar (or white vinegar), soy bean water (or plain water) salt, garlic, pepper with some wheat flour, sesame oil and chile (or crushed red pepper) for the finale. Just cook all ingredients down until thick. A table spoon or 2 of red hot sauce doen't hurt either. It is a good recipe.

I found this lacking something, don't know what. It was a little bland. Maybe it depends on the quality of the hoisin sauce.

This was a great simple dish to make, I added some alternative vegetables such as sliced broccli salad and some water chestnuts to add some more flavor, but it was an awsome recipe.

did not use the pepper and i doubled the ginger and garlic quantities. i used shiitakes as the mushroom and added scrambled egg to the dish (more like an authentic moo shu pork). basicly, i used this recipe as a guideline, i don't follow recipes very well.

This sounded good on paper, and I was expecting great things. But this was just a so-so stir-fry -- nothing to commend it.

Easy to make, tasted very much like restaurant Moo Shu; I made my own Mandarin Pancakes (recipe from another website: chinesefood.about.com)which were fairly simple to make, as I was unable to find the frozen ones and find tortillas too thick.

I've never had this in a restaurant so can't compare it's authenticity. However, the combination of flavours and ingredients was great. It was excellent as a straightforward, easy to prepare weeknight dinner. I also served the pork with rice instead of wrappers and found it worked very well.

Have only made this with skinless chicken breasts (1- 8 oz) so I used two tablespoons of Toasted Sesame Oil to fry the chicken and vegetables. The chicken breast meat releases quite a bit of juice so I use a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with water to thicken the sauce at the end. I have used Bok Choy, Baby Bok Choy, and Napa Cabbage interchangeably. All are delicious. My guests are crazy about this and always ask for the recipe. I have eaten this in great Chinese restaurants and this is as good as any I have ever eaten.

One would be hard pressed to find a dish that tastes so good and is so easy to prepare. I have made it once, and I will most definitely serve it again. The best Moo Shu I have ever had.

I've had much better moo shu. This was dry and not very flavorful. Not worth the time spent chopping the ingredients. Next time I think I'll use the recipe that came on the moo shu wrappers.

This is a great recipe. Wonderful flavour and very quick. It's excellent for a fast meal after work when you're really starving!!

Delicious, since bok choy is hard to find in Denmark, substituted it with Chinese Cabbage, and used Noilly Prat instead of Sake. Also, marinated the pork in soy & hoisin sauces for approx 30 minutes. The pork came out juicy & tender. Make it with rice instead to make the dinner more filling !

This was absolutely the BEST Moo-Shu Pork I've ever had! The recipe was incredibly easy and very flavorful. In the future I would increase the amount of pork. I also left out the Sake ... no one was the wiser! After making this recipe you may never want to order Chinese food at a restaraunt again!
