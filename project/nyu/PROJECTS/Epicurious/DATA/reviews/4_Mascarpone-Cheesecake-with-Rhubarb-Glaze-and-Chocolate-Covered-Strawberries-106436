I've made this three times. The first two times, it was exceptional - creamy, lovely. I can't explain why, but the third time it came out a bit dry and I was disappointed. If I make again, I may shorten the baking time. I agree the glaze needs more corn starch - 2 good Tbs. Be sure to measure your strained liquid. The difficulty is you don't know if you've added enough until you slice the cake and the glaze either holds up or runs down. I've had it both ways, but it was delicious each time.

This is an excellent cheesecake. The rhubarb glaze is fantastic!

You really do have to start a day ahead to make this right. I took the advice from others and upped the cornstarch in the glaze and mine thickened up just fine. This was very rich and tasty. Definitely make again. I skipped the chocolate covered strawberries.

I read in one review that the glaze didn't thicken. After looking up how to work with cornstarch I found this: Problems with working with cornstarch - Too Much Acid: Acid ingredients such as lemon juice, lime juice or vinegar will reduce the thickening ability of the starch or prevent the mixture from thickening. Increase the starch level slightly or stir acid ingredients in after cooking.

This was good- not amazing, but good. It was extremely time-consuming.

I have made this so many times, always with success! Rather than dipping strawberries, I melt dark chocolate and drizzle over the top of cake prior to the glaze for a "stained glass window" effect. Such a good, easy to follow recipe!

This recipe was absoutly amazing! My culinary arts II class made this recipe for a project and it was of utmost sucess. :D We only made a few changes in which we altered the sugar amount to a little less than what the recipe called for. The glaze was fantastic! It was light, fluffy, and of perfect texture! I would most definatly recommend this recipe for anyone!

Time consuming, but well worth it! This is hands down the most delicious cheesecake I have ever made, and the mascarpone is the key ingredient. The glaze is stunning on top of the sour cream, and I used white chocolate to dip the strawberries, as the birthday girl doesn't care for dark chocolate. The room was full of oohs and aahs when I brought the cake out, and no one was disappointed. In fact, when the guest started eating, it became eerily quiet, then I recieved more compliments than I had ever gotten on any dessert I had made...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

ok, i baked this exactly as called for except put less sugar 2/3 cup(I always reduce sugar). according to my husband this is the best chesscake on the planet.

The cheesecake was very classic baked cheesecake. I had the same problem as a previous reviewer that the glaze didn't set (I used arrowroot instead of cornstarch). However, it was beautiful (described as luminescent). Next time I will mix the glaze with some whole strawberries and pile them on top.

I made this for fathers' day and the family loved it. The glaze was literally the icing on the cake! It's a winner.

This was a VERY good recipe--had raves from the family--perfect for rhubarb and strawberry season! Made the recipe as written with some technique adjustments in the baking process: I wrapped 2 layers of extra-wide heavy duty foil around the outside bottom and sides of the pan with the baked crust (this keeps the cheesecake in and the water out), then placed the pan in a large flat-bottom roasting pan. I added the cheesecake batter to the springform. Then filled the roasting pan with boiling water halfway up the side of the springform pan. Bake per the recipe. When taking the pan out of the oven to cool on the wire rack, run a knife around the edge of the cheesecake to release it from side so it doesn't stick and crack when it shrinks. I've never had a cheesecake overbake or crack since I learned these techniques from Cook's Illustrated / America's Test Kitchen. I skipped the chocolate covered strawberrys in the interest of time.

I have a little different point of view. I really like reading how other people modify recipes and how they like the results. Fork ratings are not exact anyway since everyone has different taste in food. So I say, thanks for all the feedback on modifications. That's what makes cooking fun and this site fun.

Rating: 0
I wish people who make changes to a recipe and then rate their own terrible cooking would just refrain from rating the original recipe. It makes it so very difficult for the rest of us to judge a recipe by the number of forks. You have to pull up every recipe and read all the notes to get a feel if it's any good or not.

Very good cheesecake recipe; I've been making it for years, and never had a bad comment on it. I never have time to do the chocolate strawberries and some of my friends are allergic to rhubarh, so instead I just make the glaze from the strawberries and pour it on top. I also add a lot more vanilla (sometimes up to a tablespoon). One of my favorites!

Excellent recipe as the rhubarb glaze is perfect with the creamy sweetness of the cheesecake. I'm not sure why the other reviewers seemed to have problems as mine came out perfect. My only suggestion is for the glaze as even though it thickened, it didn't exactly gel on top and next time I will likely skip the starch and just use a bit of gelatin instead. It's only a minor problem though as I used the excess as a very nice sauce over the cake.

I made this last night thinking that I was going to serve this for our seder today. I used ground almonds for the crust and omitted the flour from the filling. The results were disastrous -- but not, as far as I can tell, from what I did to the recipe. It tasted just awful -- WAY too eggy and spongey and no amount of flour would have taken that egg taste away. It tasted almost like a sweetened omelette, with a different, spongey-cakey texture. Blech. The only nice thing that I could say about it was that it was really very nice and smooth. I would give this recipe zero forks if there was an option.

Mascarpone makes the cheesecake ultra creamy. The glaze is tangy and just the right contrast to the eich cake. Only thing I'd change would be to add a bit of cream or butter to the chocolate to dip the strawberries so it wasn't quite so brittle when biting into the strawberries.

I would rate this recipe a 4 for the cheesecake portion and a 1 for the strawberry-rhubarb glaze. I followed the directions for the glaze and mine turned out terrible. It went on like a lumpy paste and not like a glaze at all. The taste was delicious but the presentation was not nice at all. I have no idea what I did wrong.

A good friend, Joan Fuller, brought this to our dinner party last night and it was fabulous! I ate the leftover for breakfast this morning! It is in my recipe book now!

THis was the best cheesecake i've ever had!! The lemon flavor really shines through! I even got a marriage proposal becuase it was so fabulous! I love the texture that the mascarpone gives the cake! I used the blueberry compote recipe from this site and subbed strawberries, but other than that no changes! THis one's a keeper for sure!

I didn't make this recipe but the e mail newsletter called it a chocolate marscapone cheesecake so i checked it out. it's not a choc. cheesecake. it's a cheesecake with a choc. glaze. :(

Though I haven't yet made this dish, I can't wait to do so, and when I do, I will substitute Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers for the graham crackers. I don't care for graham cracker crusts, and I think the chocolate crust will just add a little more depth to the taste and texture of the dessert.

I made this cheesecake for a birthday party and every person thought it was undebatably AMAZING. I saved the strawberry-rhubarb compote left over from the glaze and made mini pies by taking 2 circular wonton wrappers, pressing them into mini tartlet pans, putting in a couple spoonfuls of compote, and putting on another wrapper for the top crust. It would also be interesting to stuff the compote into the wrappers as if making dumplings or ravioli and boil them.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I just wondered if using Creme Fraiche would improve it or if it would make it too savory and nutty. Thanks.

I've made this recipe tons of times, and everyone has always loved it. My friends will come over and help me make it, and we'll all have it for breakfast the next day. The only moderation I have is that I'm a vanilla freak, so I usually double or tripe the serving of vanilla. If you don't think you have enough time to make it, then cut out the chocolate strawberries. Everyone I've made it for has loved it, though (and there's always a bit of extra filling, so I usually make two). People even like it down here! (It's a definite must for all my dinner functions and whatnot).

I made this cheesecake for Easter Sunday. It was worth every bit of work and expense. It was a huge hit. I'm making it again this weekend for a birthday party, but will omit the chocolate covered strawberries. They are very pretty on top, but didn't really add alot overall. The glaze was fabulous - worth the work and expense, even with rhubarb not in season.

Made this for Easter Sunday dessert.. Wow is all I can say. Everyone loved it! It was beautiful to look at as well as delicious. I'll certainly be making this one again. Thanks for this great recipe!

Haven't made this yet, but wanted to ask a question - is this cheesecake still worth making if you leave out the glaze? If I just put sour cream and strawberries on top, do you think it would still be good?

I made this cheesecake for my husband's birthday this year, and even though the process took me 2 and a half days to make from start to finish, it was SO VERY WORTH IT!!! I brought it to the restaurant we were having his birthday dinner at, and the Pastry Chef and all the employees were so impressed with the beauty of this gorgeous cheesecake. I highly recommend this recipe; it's just the perfect dessert for any special holiday or celebration where "taste and presentation" is your desire. I added two things to the Rhubarb-Strawberry Glaze, and that was 1-2 tablespoons of Cognac for that extra "zing", and a little red food coloring to make the glaze look very bright and festive. "The best cheesecake I've made yet".

Spectacular! I have made it 3 times, great every time. I suggest adding 25-50% more sour cream to the sour cream layer.

This was my first attempt at making cheesecake, and it got great reviews from those who tried it. You do need to plan on making it 2 or even 3 days in advance. The combination of strawberries and rhubarb was terrific. It looked as good as it tasted. Not your average cheesecake!

Absolutely fabulous! There was nary a piece left. Need to watch your time in preparing the chocolate covered strawberries, but it's beautiful and delicious too.
