We are in Spain and had the opportunity to buy all of the ingredients fresh from the local market, including the spanish chorizo and clams. They were not littleneck, but smaller so we bought twice as many...what a great dish!!! We did not do anything different, followed nearly exactly just adding more garlic, this dish is so easy and so delicious with using these simple ingredients - we loved every drop!

This was simple and truly excellent. I had some locally made lamb chorizo from our farmer's market, some fresh littleneck clams and some good Indian cumin. I didn't have yellow bell pepper, so I used green, to no apparent issue. I also used a good California chardonnay for the wine (and drank the rest with the meal). This was restaurant quality - high quality restaurant quality. The best steamed clam dish I've ever made. I will definitely make this again. I was dubious because of how simple it is, but it was delicious!

I haven't read any of the other reviews. I'm surprised this recipe is only 3.5 forks. I made it last evening and it was amazing. I didn't have the chorizo and had to substitute a red bell pepper for yellow...but without a doubt it was the best clam recipe I've ever had. Broth was out of this world. Used beautiful Chesapeake Bay clams that were really sweet. I would encourage anyone to make this...just make sure you have plenty of break to soak up the broth!

First time cooking w/clams OR Spanish chorizo. (Love Mexican chorizo, but the clams were a little intimidating) I feel silly now for waiting so long to try cooking clams. They were so easy! I just scrubbed them well w/a toothbrush I was about to toss and soaked them in water for a bit so they expelled any sand/grit. The flavors were wonderful even though I may have been a little heavy handed with the kosher salt. (No disaster really, but I can just tell I used too much) A very simple, yet impressive 1 pot dish. Will make again.

Why would anyone be scared of chorizo? Delicious and versatile. Try it with seared scallops and risotto!!

What an awesome recipe! I substituted the Aidell's pesto sausage. I think you could substitute most any sausage with a little zip. We served this as an appetizer but by the time we finished it I was barely hungry for dinner (must have been the french bread). Next time I'll make it for a summer dinner with a salad accompaniment.

This recipe is devine. I've used it twice now. Once with the sausage and the other substituted mussels for the sausage. Both times the recipe was fantastic. I believe it is the cumin and the wine used. I used 120 Chilean wine. My company thinks I'm a closet Chef. Thankyou for the recipe.

Used this as my first course for a dinner party and it got rave reviews. For all of you afraid of Chorizo, please note, the recipe calls for a dry cured Chorizo, this is a much higher end Chorizo then you will find in most supermarkets (what with lymph nodes and lips and ears and such) but Chorizo is made with certain spices that impart a distinct flavor to the dish. All the other substituions sound fine, but it will be different. But then, that's what cooking is all about...viva la difference!

Yes, chorizo does scare me. So instead used garlic/artichoke chicken sausage from Costco. Did not have the pepper or cilantro but it was still fantastic, definitely a keeper.

This recipe is not only good, it is fabulous! It is easy, fast...we used Chicken Thai Sausage from Whole Foods...I sauteed the sausage before putting into pot, the sauce is just a real pleasant mixture, not too hot..I used ground cumin...my husband NEVER eats bread...need I say more?

Made this twice-once without pepper & it was still really good. Used Maine mahogony clams & it was great. Friends loved it. Added extra garlic & dunked good Italian bread into sauce

Tasty, but the chorizo toughened up in the cooking. And one clove of garlic is not nearly enough. Added a bit more wine to produce more sauce - it was almost a soup and bread is indeed a must to mop up the liquid.

A perfect appetizer for a summer evening -- the dinner guests are still raving about it. We've made it twice -- once with the chorizo, and once without, but with a dash or two of cayenne pepper and oregano, and finer chopped onion and bell. The second version worked just as well, and the result was a thicker broth that also worked as a dipping sauce for grilled shrimp.
