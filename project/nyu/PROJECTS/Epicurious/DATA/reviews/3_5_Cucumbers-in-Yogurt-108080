I thought this was a little bland until I added some minced mint and the juice of half a lemon - then it was wonderful. A drizzle of olive oil on top was really pretty as well

It's beetter to add a little bit of olive oil, dill or/and parsley, pinch of walnuts. If you add water It's called tarator :). Cook from Washington I can't remember recipe combining vinegar and yogurt - actually we use yogurt in cooking because of the sour refreshing taste.

This came up pretty salty; that might be because I reduced the quantity of yogurt. My husband still thought there was too much of it. I also added a teaspoon of minced fresh dill, which was nice. I would reduce the garlic next time as well, and perhaps stir in some crumbled feta cheese. This is good!

Refreshing dip that goes well with grilled meats or seafood. Greek yogurt is sold at Dean & Deluca's (Total brand). I also use Lebanese yogurt found in Middle Eastern markets. Greeks generally grate the cucumbers and you may even want to add a splash of red wine vinegar. Serving tip: thinly sliced fried zucchini tastes great dipped into this dip. Kali Oreksi (Bon appetit!)
