I liked this a lot, different, but good. A way to make use of all those Hachiya persimmons (if you or a friend has a tree) besides persimmon pudding or cookies. It does have a slightly different texture than most ice cream because of the persimmon puree, but that is part of why we liked it. Some people might want to reduce the peppercorns to 1 tsp, but we enjoyed the spice. I would make as a dessert for guests with a crisp cookie.

This is by far the worst recipe I have tried on epicurious. I still think it's an interesting concept but the proportions are off. The finished product tasted like persimmon puree, not ice cream, and the texture was a bit pasty. Also, I'm not sure how much I like the peppery aftertaste.
