Delicious! The spinich did not wilt, but it was fine. Used chopped hard boiled eggs, a little tomato, goat cheese and threw in some pasta for a satisfying meal. A nice change, and I will make it again.

Very, very good. Out of cider, so substituted 1 C apple juice. This one is a keeper!

I left out the chopped apple because I thought it would be plenty sweet without. Tossed in some golden sweet pepper. Absolutely delicious.

The BEST fall salad - served the crumbled bacon as well as crumbled gorgonzola cheese and toasted pecans (if you can find them, Carolyn's sweet and salty gourmet pecans are perfect) on the side...made for a nice hearty salad - LOVE this one!

I honestly think this is the best salad I've ever had. We were out of apple cider so used apple juice (1 cup instead of 1.5 cups). This salad was so good we all ate several servings of it and very little of the rest of our meal!

This is the most flavorful wilted spinach salad recipe I've found. I've made it many times since it first appeared in 1991. It's my go-to salad. I make it exactly as written for guests and make it with less bacon and oil when it's just me.

This was very delicious. I rated it even though I made a few substitutions. I didn't have any apple juice so I used pineapple juice and I used pancetta instead of bacon. Both of those substitutions were fantastic in this recipe. It an extremely great winter salad. Not hard to make either.

This was a good recipe but nothing too original. I did change it up a bit and used arugala instead of spinach and added a bit more apple for sweetness. Word of caution: serve the salad immediately so the bacon stays crisp. A nice winter salad

This was really delicious - especially in winter when cold salad is just not appealing - I used baby spinach and added "extras" as suggested - caramelized pecans and gorgonzola cheese - both were nice additions but not absolutely necessary. Will definitely make again and again.

I substituted rice wine vinegar, used Maille brand Dijon mustard. I put the bacon bits and some slivered almonds on the side. The result was a milder taste and aroma than the original recipe and the entire family loved it.

Made this last night to go with grilled steak and a baked potato. VERY easy to make. (To those who complain about reducing the apple cider - please, it's not really that hard nor time consuming!) I sprinkled some goat cheese over the wilted spinach, as others have suggested; candied walnuts would also be good. And hey - it's got bacon! What could be so wrong with it if it's got bacon?

Rating: 3
My husband is a vegetarian so I obviously couldn't saute anything in the bacon grease. I oven baked the bacon and set aside and just used a little butter to saute the shallot and onion. It tastes just fine. I'll serve the bacon on the side and both vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike can enjoy. I'm also going to use the hard-boiled egg so thanks to all who made that suggestion!

I LOVE this salad. Great with extras too - try goat cheese, sliced raw apples, mushrooms sauteed in the bacon fat, toasted pecans. Soooooo yummy.

This is definitely a hit. Add seared scallops, as I did, and that puts it over the top.

Made this with sweet vidalia onions instead of apples, and apple juice instead of cider. It was DEE-LISH! My teenage son ate it, and he's a veggie hater.

This is one of the best spinach salads I've ever had...and easy too! The only change I made was adding some chopped boiled eggs before serve. Delicious!

Can I make this 5 forks? A friend who also is an epicurious.com lover made this salad for me while I watched. I plan on making it regularly. Delicious. We added some local flavor - roasted pinon!

While the dressing was reducing, it was on the sour side. Since spinach can be bitter that scared me. I added 1&1/2 Tbs of brown sugar to counteract that which made this recipe a 4 fork.

It took a LOT longer to reduce the liquid than expected, so next time I make it I will plan accordingly. I think I will also add a few raw apples to the salad for texture, and some crumbled cheese.

Rating: 3
I was a little worried about how this dish would turn out, but it was really wonderful! If you reduce the mixture on the stove as directed (it took a little longer for me than stated in the recipe), it looks like there's not much there, but I tossed it well with the spinach and it was just the right amount of dressing and wilted the spinach just slightly. I added gorgonzola and candied pecans as suggested by other reviewers. This was really yummy and I will definately make it again.

This is FAB especially when you add gorgonzola and crushed pecans!

This recipe sounds a lot better than it tastes. I made it exactly as directed, but something is missing, taste-wise. Not a horrible salad, but more prep work than the taste justifies.

To the Cook who gave directions for Sweet Potato Queens - what are they? ( I hope the answer is not so obvious that I will be embarassed).

MADE THIS FOR A WORK CHRISTMAS PARTY AND IT RECIEVED RAVE REVIEWS!!! I DIDN'T ADD THE APPLES TO THE DRESSING TILL IT WAS DONE, THEN JUST TOSSED THEM IN THE DRESSING TO HEAT THROUGH! THEY REMAINED FIRM AND SOAKED UP JUST ENOUGH FLAVOR OF THE DRESSING...I DID ADD MORE VINEGAR AND BACON FAT THAN CALLED FOR AND USED REGULAR APPLE JUICE! SINCE I MADE THESE CHANGES IS WHY I ONLY GAVE IT 3 SPOONS!!!

We added fresh eggs boiled and chopped, and toasted walnuts - wonderful flavor combination. Sweet Potato Queens: double the amount of bacon and add a cup of bourbon.

Excellent! Will make it again.

Delicious! Following another review here, I omitted the apple, and used 1/2 cup apple juice with the apple cider vinegar the recipe calls for. I cannot wait to make this again! In addition, I added 8 thinly sliced white mushrooms, as I was tossing the spinach with the dressing. Heavenly!

the reviews on this web site are very helpful. I enjoy reading them and most people are so kind, unlike the Vermont reviewer who is so mean-spirited. Thank goodness they are few who set out to make someone unhappy.

YUMMY! This salad was really delicious and my guests raved about it! I added some candied pecans which was a great compliment too. I didn't have cider vinegar so I used rice vinegar...still turned out great.

I made this for a dinner party of frineds that I knew didn't like most vegetables - fresh or otherwise. They loved it and were suprised that spinach could be fixed in such an edible way. I took some of the advice from other reviewers and only used one tablespoon of the bacon greese. It seemed to be just right. I will definately make this again.

I found a recipe similar to this on FoodTV.com. Skip the apple and apple cider. Increase the cider vinegar to 1/2 cup. Turned out great.

I made this and thought it was pretty good. I didn't have any apples on hand but used some strawberries. To the cook from Vermont, I don't see any need to be sarcastic when a cook was trying to help. Try being polite. You'll feel better!

quite good, I added mushrooms and walnuts(roasted) and it was superb. For the master culinarian who advised patuerised cider because of e-coli. good thought, the 10 minute boil wouldn't kill the ecoli but a quick pastuerize would??????

My guest and I really liked this salad -- it's wonderful for a fall or winter meal. Next time, however, I think I'd omit the apples and use onions instead.

I have received rave reviews on this dish. I did add candied walnuts to the finished salad which I felt added just a nice added touch.

The apples absorbed all of the liquid...There was nothing remaining to wilt the leaves...I don t know what the answer would be....add more cidar? We would not attempt again.

very rich and delicious, I used turkey bacon and very little fat

I made the dressing the day beforehand and the apples absorbed the sauce and it ended up with an apple sauce consistency. Otherwise it was pretty good, I liked the sweetness of the dressing with the saltiness of the bacon. I also reduced the amount of fat. Next time though I'll prep the dressing just before serving.

I served this alongside the recipe for varkenshaas (weird name, exceptional pork dish) and it was heavenly! However, I raised an eyebrow on the amount of bacon fat used to make the dressing. I heeded my instincts and reduced the amount to 1 tablespoon and it was very good. It may be better with the additonal fat, but what I don't know won't hurt me :-) I imagine this would compliment most pork dishes, and probably any dish that packs a tangy zing. Have fun with this one! -t

Delicious--had this on a soup and salad night--we all cleaned our plates--I went by the recipe--but we did top the salad with Parmigiano-Reggiano--what more could you want?

I thought this recipe was just ok. The apple flavor was sort of bland. The effect of the hot dressing on the spinach did give a perfectly wilted effect.

Very good - We served it to guests the first time we made it, and everyone loved it. Advice: Dice your apples finely. Also, chopped walnuts and sliced hard-boiled egg would be a nice addition.

My spinach-hating husband loves this and often asks me to make it, especially if we have company coming. To save time I use apple sauce now.

My husband and I enjoyed this salad very much. To make it as healthy as possible, I used turkey bacon and halved the dressing (which made plenty). Also, I added the chopped spinach stems to the dressing as it reduced, which added texture and substance.

This is a perfect blend of flavors, especially making it with Hobbs' applewood bacon. My friends loved it and asked for the recipe.

I made this for a family that loves spinach and they ate every bite. I was afraid I made too much but I didnt. The apple gives it a great aroma and helps to cover up the smell of the garlic in the main dish. I'm sure I'll be asked to make this again and again. I'm thinking of adding some raisins to it next time.
