It's a very big lasagne, good for 2 meals. The kids liked it - picky eaters. I used half the ricotta and filled the other "half" with cottage cheese. I used fresh spinach that I had reduced in a frying pan myself. It's tasty, but could use something for a splash - sun dried tomatoes?

Delicious recipe and perfect for meat and veggie eaters. A few comments: As others have said, definitely increase the salt and pepper-don't be shy. I varied the bolognese sauce to add some touches from Marcella Hazan (reduce milk and wine separately, with milk first, simmer at low heat for longer). I used 1 lb. of ground pork and skipped the bacon--still delicious! I used half a can of peeled plum tomoatoes instead of paste, which helped boost the color and flavor and ensured the sauce did not get too dry. I found that I had a lot of extra spinach mixture. Perhaps I could have been more generous, but I really slathered it on and still had leftover. Next time I will cook a little longer with the foil off and will make extra bolognese sauce to use for future pasta.

In a family of 6, this is one of the few things that I have made (the only thing?) that got RAVES from all family members. It's pretty adaptable in that I was able to split the recipe and make half of it vegetarian with "vegetarian crumbles" instead of ground beef. The vegetarians loved it too!

Great recipe but I agree that it could use more salt and more tomato paste. I served it the next day with a topping of Prego sauce and fresh mozzarella and it was great.

Wickedly good lasagna! My sweetie & I both liked it particularly because it didn't have all that cheese that Italian-American lasagnas have. But having said that, I used left-over bolognese (ragu) sauce that I had made a couple of days earlier with roasted tomatoes, Italian sausages, and bottom round, cooked & shredded. I added the milk & cooked it for half an hour or so. Used whole milk ricotta & fresh spinach & real parmesan. After I took off the foil & parchment & think I cooked it a little too long - stay with the 15 minutes recommended. The bechamel sauce (basically) can get a little crusty if you don't watch it. Lighter than many lasagnas, and oh so good!

@graceross- Yes, it freezes quite nicely! Made one last May and served it the beginning of July whilst camping. Heated it up on the grill as opposed to a home oven and it was just as good as I anticipated: no excess liquid. Enjoyed making this recipe and it's a true keeper in my world now.

This is a very nice starting guide for a lasagna Bolognese but I think it needs tweaking to be ideal. First, all mentions of salt quantities need be at least quadrupled. I used pasteurized eggs so had no fear of tasting everything before it went into the oven. And I held back from adding more than 4x the recommended amount of salt only because it just seemed incomprehensibly off fron the recipe. After serving, my guests STILL added a few salt dashes! Same goes for pepper. No need to be stingy with S & P - the dish a high volume recipe.. teaspoon fractions of S & P simply will not do! Next, from my reading of America's Test Kitchen, about Bolognese, I learned that a true ragu execution doesn't include reducing the milk and wine simultaneously. So, I reduced my wine on the side separately, and after the milk reduced in the meat, I added the wine reduction for the final flavor blend half hour of simmering. For color (and in part for flavor) I think that this recipe's volume requires more than 4 Tbls of tomato paste. Without more than that the ragu looks a bit gray. Last, to speed up the mis en place time, spin the veggies on pulse in a processor. Voila!

Before I review this, I must admit that I had to make a lot of changes because of what ingredients I had on hand. So, I'm rating it as I made it, and stating changes in case they could be helpful to others. It was delicious and everyone loved it! 1. I used a 2 lb. chuck pot roast instead of ground beef (just shredded meat up once it cooked), so I had to increase the cooking time for the bolognese sauce up to 3 hours (I did in the oven on 325); I added an extra 1/2 cup white wine, and 1 cup water in order to make up for the liquid that would be lost with 3 hours of cooking time. The sauce turned out delicious, but it was just barely enough to do the lasagna, so I would probably also increase the milk* to 2 cups and tomato paste to 1/3 cup. I made this the day before. *Word of warning when adding the milk: heat it before adding to the sauce to prevent curdling. 2. I substituted bacon for the pancetta. 3. I only had 1 package of spinach on hand, and had to use low fat ricotta (all they had!). I was actually happy with the amount of spinach--it just wasn't as "spinachy" of a flavor, which was ok with my group. The low-fat ricotta was just okay-- definitely find whole milk if you can, as I think it would add a lot more flavor! )The low-fat stuff was very bland, but still okay in a pinch). 4. I used 1% milk mixed with half and half to equal the whole milk. 5. I added the nutmeg, but didn't feel like it added the right flavor.I may leave it out next time. 6. Since the low-fat ricotta was so bland, I added some smoked mozzerella to the top of the lasagna; just a 1/2 Cup was a great additional flavor. 7. I used regular lasagna noodles from a box, and cooked 5 minutes. They cooked the rest of the way in the dish. I baked 50 minutes and the middle was still not hot, so I'd probably give it at least 1 hour in the oven before removing the foil next time...which there will definitely be a next time!

Rating: 4
Great recipe, very good lasagna. We didn't have no-boil noodles in our market, regular egg noodles worked fine. Moisture wasn't a problem, since the spinach wasn't totally wrung dry and no fat was skimmed off the sauce. Using good quality meat and cheeses really seemed to make the difference. Came out very tasty and not as heavy as expected. Yes, a bit time-consuming, but worth it. Great way to get veggies in the diet too.

Excellent recipe. One of the best lasagnes I've ever tasted. This is also a fabulous way to incorporate veggies into a dish to make a complete meal. I usually go strictly by the recipe when I make something the first time, and then tweak it on later occasions. So, I cooked this one exactly as suggested except halved everything. I did find that it needed 25 mins of cooking with the foil off, not 15. I let it sit 20 mins out of the oven. It was perfect!

Rating: 4
This was a great recipe! I did change it a bit, though. I used 2 6- oz cans of tomato paste and added oregano to the bolognese. I used fresh spinach (chopped) along with a bit of fresh basil. I didn't separate the ricotta filling. I also made the noodles from scratch and put a layer of fresh mozzarella on the top (instead of the ricotta filling). It was so good! I will make this again for sure!

I took this lasagne to a group dinner this evening and everyone RAVED about it!! I had never made the recipe before and took a leap of faith after seeing 4 forks and reading some reviews. It turned out just as the other cooks decribed it would. Light, Good tasting and a crowd pleaser. Made it just as the directions said. I did add some extra cheese to each layer. And just as the other cook said, don't be tempted to pour off the juices; they all get incorporated in the final dish. Yum. This recipe will be made again. Thanks, Epicurious!

A real treat. The prep work is the most timely thing about the recipe, and it's all worthwhile when your guest start raving! Unusually balanced for a lasagne. Be sure to get good Parmesan, because it is definitely the star.

I have made this now twice--once exactly as written and once with my own Bolognese sauce recipe (makes about 3 quarts, so using leftovers). I just wanted to comment that Bolognese is supposed to be somewhat dry and thick, mostly meat with a little liquid and tomato paste to make it pasty--that's what keeps the lasagna from falling-apart goopy. I like my sauce recipe a little better, though, as it uses a few spices (nutmeg, black pepper, smoked paprika) and cream, no thyme. Also, I think that this recipe could benefit from a little salt in both the sauce and the ricotta filling. I like the method of short-cutting the bechamel, though. Overall a keeper, if only for that reason.

Rating: 3
This is a really delicious lasagna. The bolognese sauce is rich and flavorful. I didn't find it dry, though I didn't skim any fat off of the bolognese and it was still quite moist when I put it in the lasagna. My only concern is that the light flavor of the ricotta and spinach gets a little bit drowned out by the richness of the bolognese. I couldn't taste the nutmeg at all, either, though that could be the result of my spices being much too aged. Still plenty delicious and we will almost certainly make the bolognese again--probably the whole lasagna too, though I may try and add something more to the spinach ricotta mixture so that it can stand up more to the other tastes in the dish (maybe sub kale or arugula for the spinach?).

Rating: 4
This is the best lasagne I have ever had. I've never cooked one before and although it was time-consuming, it was perfect the first time. Make sure that most of the liquid is evaporated when you make the bolognese so that the ricotta can do its job. It is moist without being wet or greasy. It is light but filling. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Reading others' reviews, I tweaked the recipe a bit to have a saucier tomato component which I think worked out beautifully. To the original recipe I added in one can of tomato sauce and one can of diced tomatoes in juice, and I doubled the amount of tomato paste called for. I also used lean beef as it was all that was available organic along with some ground buffalo and while both of these meats are lean they tasted delicious in the finished product. Used bacon rather than pancetta as it was all I had on hand and heavily seasoned (salt + pepper) the bolognese as it cooked. For those of you claiming the dish is bland, you are likely underseasoning it. For the filling I used 3/4 frozen to 1/4 fresh spinach (the fresh was baby spinach which I finely chopped) and I topped it with breadcrumbs toasted in butter and plenty of cheese. So delicious! In the future I would add the liquid to the bolognese gradually rather than dumping it all in at once and I'd add more shredded cheese to the layers. Highly recommended and well worth the wait--plus it makes an inconceivable amount of leftovers!

This is my go to favorite lasagne recipe. Its not your traditional lasagne, so if thats what youre craving, this is not it. This is something when you want a one-dish meal but still want to impress your friends with something a little different. There are eggs in the cheese which makes them bake up like a souffle, pancetta in the beef which makes it taste like heaven, and nutmeg in the sauce which pulls it all together with a quirk that works. I have made this several times for parties and it has never dissapointed.

Rating: 1
This was not bad but I give it one fork because it truly was just "okay." I did find mine to be a bit dry, as others did, and I was not expecting a saucy, gooey, Americanized lasagne. I just think it should have been a touch saucier and/or cheesier. My bigger problem with this was lack of flavor. Very bland, despite my use of extremely high quality pancetta and beef, an extra clove of garlic, and fresh organic spinach that I cooked, rather than frozen. Although lasagne doesn't need mozzarella, I think this did need a third cheese of some sort to add another flavor dimension, or perhaps a very strongly flavored vegetable. It did freeze and reheat well.

Very good and very filling. I made this with brown rice gluten-free noodles and it worked out very well. I agree with others who found this to be time intensive, so I'm not sure I'd make it again based on that fact alone. If I do make it again, I'll serve some sauce on the side.

This recipe was terrific. Very rich and hearty. I only gave it 3 forks because of the intensive time to prepare. I was not anticipating a full day lasagne. Luckily, I doubled the recipe and made two pans. The second pan I froze. I was thrilled that freezing the second pan didn't detract from the flavor. I did add some extra sauce to the second pan to keep it from drying out.

While a little time-intensive, this was a rich and delicious meal - definitely reserve the recipe for a special occasion. I split the sauce and ricotta filling recipes in half, but I still used a 13 x 9 inch pan and everything fit perfectly. Having seen the comments about dryness, I added a 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce to the bolognese and it seemed to be just right. I also used part-skim ricotta and 2% milk just to cut down on the fat content a bit. The sauce was delicious on its own and I may double the recipe (including the extra can of sauce I added) to serve over rigatoni in the future.

I definitely enjoyed this lasagne though I too found it just the *slightest* bit dry. Next time I will not be so vigilant about squeezing the spinach and will perhaps use a different ricotta. I think either of these things would have solved the dryness problem. While making the bolognese I was worried it was going to be too greasy due to the large amount of oil that kept pooling, but in the end it was just fine. Resist the urge to skim off any fat!

I don't know what people are talking about - this recipe was neither too wet nor too dry - and it was full of flavor. The only trouble I had was the grease in the bolognese, but I was able to take care of it and in the future, will drain it early on in the recipe. Also, you may think you will have extra sauce, but you won't. It's worth it, though, and I will be eating like a king for days.

I thought this was fantastic as written. Halved the recipe and used an 8x8 square Pyrex dish with 2 noodles per layer. It was just lovely and not dry at all. Try soaking your noodles a little longer, maybe don't saute the bolognese to dryness, and don't cut down on the oil.

As long as you understand this isn't a traditional Italian-American lasagna (ie, lots of sauce) you'll enjoy this recipe. The spinach and bolognese sauce play off each other, and don't be afraid of the nutmeg in the ricotta filling. I used part- skim ricotta, as all I had, and lasanga was still rich and I had no problems with dryness.

Very rich and quite good. I made as directed except for using 2% milk and a lot more salt than was called for. I did the parchment treatment, and the lasagne was actually a bit wet on top when I uncovered it. The last 15 minutes browned it to perfection, though, and it was not dry at all, but not soupy either. I did find myself wanting a little more tomato in it (the American in me) and will add more next time I make it. Other than that, it was delicious and I'll make it again as an occasional treat.

holy smokes this is absolutely perfect! you don't think it will be that good because there's almost no tomato in it. i read the other reviews & it seems people claim it is dry. i had NO problem at all. in fact, the oil formed a little puddle. it has plenty of olive oil, the pancetta added more oil & then i bought fatty ground beef (74%) so if this was a dry dish, it HAS to be that cooks are cutting back the almost frightening amount of oil. i followed the recipe exactly but left out the carrot & celery. i also made a half order because i don't have an oven & it would not fit. next time i will add those veggies because it was just meat. they have a purpose. i seriously can not imagine a better lasagna. this will be a new years day recipe for years to come.

Extremely good. I had no problem with dryness. I also: 1) Did not squeeze the spinach because my frozen spinach looked relatively dry and I was lazy. 2) Used semi-fat ricotta, bacon, lean beef, and a lot more Parm-Reg! (contradictory, I know...)

Made it for dinner tonight and loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out excellent. I made extra sure to cover it well with parchment paper, and had no issues with dryness. It isn't your average lasagne, which impressed me. Not quite sure why others might have had problems with moisture content? Quite a depth of flavor to it, though it might be improved by a 33% beef, 33% veal, 33% pork mixture?

The previous reviews were either loved it or hated it - I should have taken that as a warning. The bolognese sounded dry but flavorful - it was dry and flavorless, even with all those vegetables. Where is the salt and pepper? I doubled the veg and garlic per another suggestion, but it was still so bland and dry that I added a can of diced tomatoes plus a can of tomato sauce, more paste, and of course salt and pepper. Strangely nothing seemed to really boost the flavors beyond ok-ish, but I decided to proceed. Into the oven it went and when I took the foil and parchment off for the final browning the top was crusty-dry on the sides and wet (literally) in the center. Keeping faith, against my instincts, that it would turn out it went into the oven to brown. When I checked it the top had puffed like a souffle!! Out it came and I let it sit presuming the top would settle - it didn't until I eventually pierced it and forced the air out. The overall flavor wasn't awful after all the additions, extra time tasting and testing, but my husband described the overall dish as more like a layered manicotti with a crispy top. Don't bother with this recipe - so not worth it - unless a crispy layered manicotti sounds appealing.

My ground beef went bad in the refrigerator, so I used a pound of hot italian sausage and a pound of ground turkey instead. Many have suggested using some italian sausage in this recipe; I wouldn't use the hot variety because it slightly overpowered the other more delicate flavors here. Also, I would use 2.5 pounds of meat; I didn't have enough bolognese for the last layer. The ricotta mixture was delicious and did remind me of bechemel. I forgot to use parchment paper and foil, but surprisingly my lasagne didn't turn out dry at all. Very rich, very satisfying, very hearty.

This did not work for me at ALL! Why? Because it comes out dry, dry, DRY I am afraid!!! Went through every step, did it carefully, individual parts tasted good, i.e. The Bolognaise and The Ricotta and Spinach mix...But in retrospect the Bolognaise is wayyyyyyy tooo dry, has barely any tomato sauce in it and was cooked with 30 minutes as opposed to the 50 minutes suggested, so although I stopped the cooking before it dried out completely, I can see people getting a bone dry mix. The layering is easy to do and is well explained and it looked good at the end. In the oven it went and it came out rubbery, tasteless and DRY! My husband tried to eat it but quickly admitted that it is beyond consumption. It is a shame because it is time consuming and includes very expensive ingredients and it ALL went into the garbage!

good solid recipe! i read all the other reviews and took those comments under consideration. i never cooked w/ the no-boil lasagne noodles before but i was pleasantly surprised. i added a can of whole tomatoes for the sauce bc of the 'dry' comment but just used enough sauce to cover the noodles when assembling the lasagne. i had extra sauce with the meal which made the dish even better. also added ground pork with the ground chuck which also added to the flavor. will make it again and perhaps change my rating to 4 stars.

The meat, the spinach, the cheese: all the flavors and textures were so very satisfying and enjoyable! Next time, following my spouse's advice, I might use less cheese, although personally I thought it was just right. I paid attention to the review that emphasized the importance of parchment paper under the foil, and I had absolutely no stickinng issues. I made sure to avoid trying to get too much browning at the end - - just a hint in a few places -- so that there was nothing like a "hard" topping that some people reported. On the contrary, the whole dish was perfect and beautiful, and served a family of four for three nights (we had a rest for a couple of days after the second night, and the lasagne only improved in the fridge, as these things will). It IS a rich meal, of course, but it ought to be! Best of all, the household's chief cook, who never compliments anything less than excellence, was impressed!

This lasagne was AMAZING! It was easy to make, the recipe is straightforward and it tasted delicious. I used ground Bison instead of ground beef and to address the bison's very low fat content, I combined it (half & half) with Italian sausage. I also used the whole can of tomato paste and substituted 16oz fresh spinach instead of frozen. Based on another reviewer's advice, I steamed the spinach until wilted but still had to wrap it in a tea towel and squeeze out the excess liquid. The only noodles I could find were Catelli No Boil noodles (soaked them as per the recipe) and they were fine. Next time I'll double the veggies in the meat sauce. I will definitely make this again!

Best lasagna of my life. If you are looking for Americanized lasagna, look elsewhere. This dish has about 3 tablespoons of tomato sauce and that's it. On to the actual cooking: I substituted rosemary for the thyme and it was DIVINE. Next time I might add a half a pound more of beef and extra veggies. I also added a little bit of swiss on the top. Also, don't skimp on the salt!

After reading other reviews, I substituted 1 lb of Italian sausage for one of the pounds of beef. I cooked the meat first and drained off the fat, then put the meat aside and cooked the veggies. I also added 1/2 lb of fresh sliced mushrooms, and used a whole small can of tomato paste. I also COVERED the pot that I simmered the sauce in, so it wasn't dry at all! I also used fresh spinach (steamed just until wilted) for the ricotta filling. We liked the results :)

I have made this twice now, and each time it was superb. The first time I used Barilla no-boil noodles; the second time Trader Joe's. The only difference was that you have to soak the TJ's noodles a bit longer, but once they are flexible the result is the same. I think the key here is how dry you make the sauce. I made mine quite thick, but with enough residual moisture so that dryness was not an issue. The noodles will soak up any excess moisture. I would not make a sloppy, wet sauce, but you don't need to cook the daylights out of it either. I used a 16 ounce bag of spinach which seemed ample, instead of two 10 ounce boxes. I also used a full 8 ounce can of tomato paste instead of 3/4 of a can as called for - - what are you going to do with the last two ounces? And this did not hurt the flavor at all. Bland? Not really; it is comfort food, but if all is done right there's an excellent balance between all the elements, and a variety of textures and colors to keep it interesting.

I used the Trader Joes no boil noodles, Hemp milk and fresh spinach, and I added a little sweet italian sausage to the meat mixture. I was a little more liberal with the Thyme. Next time I'll use less nutmeg. This didn't come out dry at all. I think the key is to brown the meat but don't overdo it because you're rendering too much fat out of the meat. I used 15% fat ground beef. I wouldn't go leaner or fattier. It does take a long time to make but my family loved the end result.

This Lasagna is superb. I'm not sure what 'A Cook from Chicago' did incorrectly, but I followed the recipe exactly, and out from the oven emerged the most delicious lasagna my husband and I have ever tasted. Perfect moisture level, it stayed together, and was even better the next day. I did use Trader Joe's no-boil lasagna noodles instead of Barilla and wasn't disappointed at all.

This is a keeper! We had a "Godfather" dinner party--Italian music, food and than the trivia game. I made this lasagna the night before and followed the tips in the perfect lasagna section. It was a huge hit. Next time I might add a little cayanne to the red sauce (because I add it to all of my soups and sauces), but it was delish. The flavors were layered and the finished product was beautiful. The only change I made was using 9 noodles instead of 12, so one less layer. I recommend this for all who are looking for authentic and out of the box--not average lasagna!

You know, I so wanted this to work, but it just didn't. I followed the directions to a "t" and it was dry and crumbly. It definitely didn't look anything like the picture! It seems there is not enough filling for the layers and they end up too thin and they dry out. Perhaps I would try again and double all the filling ingredients. Very disappointed as this is time consuming and the results were poor.

Truly a gourmet dish worthy of any 5 star establishment in Little Italy! Many reviews describe the dish as too dry or lacking flavor. I would suggest these few adjustments to the recipe: Double the garlic. You CAN use lean ground beef and DON'T skimp on the olive oil. I used 1/4C. Simmer the sauce at least 1 hour, more is preferable (you can always add a little more white wine). Use fresh spinach blanched and drained, no need to towel-dry it. Very important, cover with UNBLEACHED PARCHMENT PAPER covered tightly with aluminum foil to prevent moisture loss. Don't just cover with foil when baking. Bake at 375 for just under an hour. The ingredients and their marriage in the dish are authentic. Give it another try! It's worth it!

Rating: 3
I thought this was good, but it's not my favorite lasagna. I was excited, too, because the marriage of lasagna bolognese and spinach lasagna seemed like the best idea I'd heard in ages. Like another poster, mine turned out dry. I've not had that happen before with the no-boil noodles with a pre-soaking, so I'm not sure what happened. I did skim fat off the beef while it cooked because it looked like it was in a lake of grease, but maybe that was a mistake in light of how dry it got. Also, I think it would probably be good for the meat to add the milk much sooner so the texture stays softer. I loved the concept of this recipe, though, and I think I might noodle around (pun intended) with using a bechamel instead of the ricotta and seeing what that does.

The final dish was extremely dry. The no-boil noodles absorbed whatever moisture there was despite the presoaking and there wasn't enough moisture in the sauce to compensate. The flavors were okay but rather bland. Lasagne should be a special treat and this dish simply isn't.

Attempted to double this recipe for a New Years Eve dinner, but a mistake along the way, which turned out to be a good thing. Doubled the milk, but not the ricotta cheese and the sauce was perfect! Everyone raved, and my picky 14 yr old is still asking for leftovers! Yummy and definitely a keeper.

Bland.....double the seasonings (garlic and thyme). The sauce is very greasy. Use lean ground beef and pour off excess oil/fat as it cooks. Ground lamb would be better than the ground beef IMHO. This is a creamy moussaka/lasgane. The bolognese sauce was scant- perhaps make 1 1/2 times the recipe.
