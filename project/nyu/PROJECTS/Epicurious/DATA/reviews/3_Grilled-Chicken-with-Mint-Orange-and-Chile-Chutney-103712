We thought this was good. It was quick to prepare and I thought it had more flavor than I'd expected.

delicious and very quick with a food processor

This was very nice - the chutney flavoured the chicken nicely, and moistened it (I often find boneless, skinless breasts a little dry and flavourless).

I have not tried this recipe but wanted to tell the last person who reviewed the recipe that they have to click on the chutney and the recipe for that will come up!!!

Hello!!!!! Isn't this recipe missing something? Like the directions to make the chutney? Sounds great, but this recipe is missing the recipe!
