I used hot metts, and should have made more. Everyone at my wife's birthday party gobbled them up and asked for more. They were a big hit.

I made these for a Christmas party and then again for a superbowl party. Both times they were a big hit. They are simple and look much fancier than the lil'smokies version. I served them with several different types of mustard to dip with.

This is so easy to make and you can change it in so many ways to fit any type of occasion. Great for summer outdoors..a change from just hamburgers...and easy for the kids to carry around. You can make this for a casual dinner party just by using the smaller sausage types.

These are great for adults, too! My husband loved them and I took them to investment club and all the ladies wanted the recipe. A great add to anyone's appetizer recipe file.
