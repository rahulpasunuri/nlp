Too bitter for me. I used Clementine tangerines and could only taste the peel.

This is a beautiful, light, zesty, easy dish to end a meal. Breezy in summer, but i just made it now (in winter) to end a heavy dinner of beef with bacon and port. It was a perfect finisher. I've never made a souffle before, and this one was so easy i almost couldn't believe it works! You don't even have to make a bain-marie. Lovely.

This was absolutely delicious. I have made many souffles, and this is one of the best ever. I used Clementines with no bitterness. You can make the souffles up to baking and keep them in the fridge for at least 8 hours, maybe more -- they will be just as puffy.

This was my first souffle and it came out perfectly for a dinner party. My guests raved and I felt like a master chef! Making the syrup ahead of time is definitely a good idea. I used Satsuma tangerines and there was no bitter taste. The Grand Marnier whipped cream is a great complement to the tangerine flavor

This was my second attempt at making souffle's and this time around, the results were better than ever expected. This dish is not too sweet and not lacking in taste in any way.(Perfection) I followed the recipe and I used honey tangerines instead of the regular, no bitterness and had no troubles. After making the dish I had a lot of tangerine puree left over, so we used some of it in tangerine mimosa's. Overall an exceptional experience; try it.

The dish came out technically perfect -- light, fluffy, golden brown, melt in your mouth. However, because you use the whole fruit, there was a slight bitterness. Next time I would use only the zest and the cleaned fruit, leaving out the bitter white part of the rind.
