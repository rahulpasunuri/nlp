Excellent recipe and method of ham preparation. Our Easter ham was wonderfully moist and flavorful. Will definitely use this method and recipe for glaze again. Didn't miss the cloves:)

This is a keeper & is now my go-to recipe for ham, I recommend it. I 'used to' make my ham uncovered and studded with cloves and coated with orange marmalade at the end of the cooking. But this Sugar & mustard recipe has a better flavor and the foil really keeps the moisture in the ham. I used 'hard' unsweatened apple cider. The flavor is delicious and mild. The sweet/smokey flavor this brown sugar and mustard recipe has makes using the left overs for other recipes very easy. My old recipe with the 'cloves' in it made using the left overs in other recipes difficult because the strong flavor of 'cloves' can overwhelm other dishes.

I used this recipe last night for the Easter ham I made for my husband and myself. It was my first time ever making a ham (I'm a newlywed, so I'm still learning a lot about cooking), and I just used a digital thermometer and poured everything on at the end and let it melt down in the oven for a few minutes - it was SO delicious! My husband loved it and so did I... this will be a recipe that we will use a lot in my house!!!

I've been making this for a few years and everyone who has some have now adopted this recipe as their favorite as well. My family can't wait for a special occasion for me to make this. It's 100% yummy and has high end taste. I'm actually cooking it again right now and thought, I really should send it out to other cooks out there. This one is a keeper!

Used this on our ham for Christmas dinner. It was delicious. I read several reviews and decided that I would combine the glaze ingredients. The glaze was delicious and the ham was enjoyed by all. Next time I will make sure that my torch has propane as that would have just been a great touch, but it was delicious without.

Makes a cheap ham taste sophisticated. I've made this every holiday season for the past four years and people rave about it. I just mix everything but the honey together and pour it over, baste the ham with it every once in a while, then boil down what's left in the pan at the end until it thickens and drizzle that over.

This is a delicious ham recipe. Made for Christmas dinner and my brother-in-law said he doesn't really like ham but asked for the recipe. Super easy too!

I thought it was pretty good, except I followed the recipe instructions, which ended up being WAY too long to cook the ham. After the first 3 hours, the ham is supposed to be 135 degrees or something like that, but mine was over 190 (my thermometer maxes out at 190). It got kind of dried out, but it still was good. I guess it's true. You really can't screw up a ham. And the flavors here were quite nice.

Made this for Easter dinner last night. Could not have been simpler or more tasty. This will be my go-to ham recipe.

This recipe is so easy and turned out excellent. Everyone at our Easter table raved about it. No more spiral sliced hams for us - this ham and prep was better and a lot more economical. The whole Southern Easter menu was exceptional. I will make it a family tradition.

This sounds good, but I'd like to make it with a pre-cooked ham instead of a fresh ham. Has anyone tried this?

Easy to make and delicious! Served for Christmas dinner and my brother-in-law you "doesn't normally like ham", has asked for the recipe. Very good and I followed the recipe exactly as written

Honestly, I don't get the value of glazing a ham! It might look marginally prettier, but it just isn't worth the hassle/mess to me. Bake the ham and serve it. I've decided after this, no more glazing for me.

This recipe is delicious. We always fight over the leftovers. I've made this three times already and am getting ready to prepare it again!

This was my first time baking a ham that was not pre-cooked. I made it for Easter dinner for the family (8 people also including toddler to teen) and it was a big hit! I did add pineapple rings with maraschino cherries with toothpicks to the ham the last 30 minutes of baking since that's how I remember the ham growing up, and it was a wonderful addition if you like to add a little sweet in your bite. Delicious, delicious ham.

Best Ham Eveah! Should get 5 forks just for being so easy. I'll never buy one of those expensive spiral cut hams again.

This is a terrific recipe and is our go-to recipe for ham. It couldn't be easier and it comes out great every time. I tried some of the suggestions about mixing all the glaze ingredients together but didnt' like the results quite as well. The differences were subtle, but we like them layered better. For the mustard we usually mix half whole grain and creamy mustards--mostly because we never have enough of one or the other. We also baste the ham a couple of times after putting the glaze on and it seems to get down into the ham a little better when we do that. Leftovers from this recipe are heavenly.

This in an excellent recipe and very easy way to make a spectacular ham. I made it twice last Winter and ready to make it again tonight. No more need to buy those expensive spiral hams- this is that good!

Quick and easy! I followed others' recommendations, and cooked down the glaze in a saucepan.

Excellent Old Fashioned Ham... I truly enjoyed it, the mustard glaze and brown sugar gave it such wonderful flavor ... will be repeating this recipe again and again.

I made this yesterday for Easter dinner. It was the first time attempting to cook a ham. This recipe was extremely easy and produced an amazing ham. People were fighting for leftovers! Like some other reviewers, I also bypassed the fussy glaze procedure and opted to mix all the glaze ingredients together in a bowl and spread it over the ham directly.

This was a great recipe for the grill. Placed celery and peeled carrots in the bottom of the pan, put the spiral cut ham on top and then poured in some apple cider. It glazed beautifully and the veges from the pan were deliciously salty.

This was a great recipe. Very easy and it was delicious at the end. Served it for my superbowl party and everyone said it was delicious. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Just made this for New Year's dinner using a Nieman Ranch nitrite free applewood smoked ham. Easy and delicious. As suggested, mixed and boiled the glaze ingredients. It worked well, and seemed less messy. Only needed to bake it with the glaze for about 10 minutes at 350, otherwise it would have burned. Used some of the leftover glaze reduced with some apple juice as a sauce. Thanks for the suggestion. Family loved it. My picky eight year old said it's the best ham she's ever had and ate 3 slices. Will definetly make again. (Followed instructions on ham to bake covered at 325 for 20- 30 min per pound till thermometer read 135 although took about 30 min per pound).

This turned out great, and was very simple. I had a 7.5 lb ham, which got up to temperature faster than I expected. I made a 'boat' out of foil, and put the ham and juice inside this, then sealed that up.

Tried this ham as a substitute to our usual Honey Baked Spiral Ham, and we won't go back. Excelllent flavor and easy to make- our family loved, loved , loved this for our Xmas dinner. I used a Cook's brand smoked Ham ( very inexpensive) and everyone raved.

I went to my boyfriend's parents house for Thanksgiving dinner last night. I made this ham for the first time and it was amazing. I got a naturally smoked shank end cut and it turned out super tender and very flavourful. (I went by the cooking instructions on the ham and cooked it at 350 for 15 min/lb.) The glaze was so easy to make and was a perfect compliment. More than one guest said it was the best ham they ever tasted! I will definitely make this again, couldn't have been easier or tastier!

This ham is awesome! I made this for an anniversary party yesterday and it was a huge hit. I mixed all the glaze ingredients together, it was much easier and it came out perfect. I also made a half recipe of the glaze and added 1/2 cup apple cider and cooked it down for a little sauce on the side. I definitely redeemed myself with this ham after making the ham with mangoes and onions on this site at Easter - this recipe blows that one away by far. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe twice and it was easy to make and very moist. I mixed the glaze together as well and either way you can not go wrong. Although the exterior edge may look dry the meat underneath is tender and delicious.

Great-agree that glaze can be all mixed together (including 1/2 c. bourbon) and melted then applied over ham for last 30 minutes. Very moist and great flavor.

Made this for Easter, it was moist, tender and flavorful! The best ham recipe I've tried, everyone loved it!

This was probably the best, most tender ham with incredible flavor. My husband mixed all of the basting ingredients instead of applying them separately and it still came out of the oven looking beautiful! I will refer to this recipe again!

Fantastic recipe. I used pineapple juice in place of the apple juice and added pineapple rings to the ham for the last 30 minutes of cooking. I made extra glaze to serve on the side and finished it with some bourbon which was amazing.

This was an easy, delicious ham and will be my go to ham recipe (although, admittedly I don't make ham often). Nice, subtle sweetness balanced w/ the bite of the mustard. I used standard dijon mustard. Next time I will leave off the honey as it seemed gratuitous and didn't add much other than calories!

This was great. I had to substitute OJ for the apple and regualar old Dijon for the whole grain but this came out amazing. Rave reviews from the family and I plan on doing it again for Easter dinner.I also thickened up the juice and served it on the side. Amazing!!!

Great staple Southern Easter Dinner. Make some extra glaze for dipping sauce, maybe add a little of your favorite bourbon, just a touch.
