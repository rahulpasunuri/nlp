This dressing is horrible.

This is really delicious! I served it warm (not hot) and used short grain brown rice and semi-dried beans that I had cooked that day.

This is a really great and different salad. I served is as a side dish and everyone asked for the recipe.

I made this with brown basmati (which was all I had) and used a lot less Cajun spice, as 5 teaspoons sounded like a lot. I probably used about 11/2 teaspoons. We both liked the salad a lot--tasty and wholesome and easy to put together. Next time, I will up the spice to 2 teaspoons to see how that is.

This was delicious although I screwed up and used both thyme sprigs when cooking the rice, so the thyme flavor was a little strong. Will do it correctly next time! I also used long-grain brown rice, and made up a batch of Emeril's Essence for the cajun seasoning. This is a great creole/cajun blend and not too salty; the recipe can easily be found online.

A great go-to rice and bean dish. I did substitute some ingredients because I wanted to use what I had on-hand to save money and the dish still turned out great. I used brown rice, red wine vinegar, dried thyme and a yellow bell pepper. I also headed the caution of other people and reduced the amount of cajun seasoning I used (store bought). We like spicy food, so I added some cayenne pepper and hot sauce.

Delicious! I did make a few changes to suit my dietary needs...I used brown rice (which requires more water than what is shown here), and substituted a green bell pepper on hand, as well as plain white vinegar, since I don't like wine vinegars. =( I thought making the rice "the long way" was a pain, as I always have a freshly- cooked rice cooker pot of brown rice in my fridge as a staple. BUT! I must say that it was worth it--the thyme cooked with the rice was a perfect touch. I didn't adjust the amounts of anything, and was lucky to find, in my regular grocer's spice section, a salt- free Cajun seasoning. I will definitely make this again-- I thought the flavors may be bland--it's so simple! But they were very diverse and rich, a simple, delicious recipe for all seasons.

This is a wonderful recipe. To some making the spice mixture may seem prolonged but it is fully worth it. Grilled shrimp can be added but you do not have to. A super easy and superb dish.

definitely one of my favorite recipes for the summer. used A Cook's recipe for cajun spice; used equal amounts of oil and vinegar. paired it with the spinach, corn and roasted peppers with chipotle dressing from this website. will be a regular on the menu.

the cajun seasoning warning was for heat which i love so i put all called for in recipe. i take a bite and realize that my cajun seasoning was basically salt, i noticed that someone else had that same problem. just add one tbls then taste before adding more. i would rather have just added a little salt and some cayenne and black pepper. i had to throw it away, it would have been very good without all that salt, i will make this again the other way.

Super yummy! I thought I got burnt out on beans and rice during college, but this is so simple and refreshing that I make this recipe about twice a month. I use less oil and more vinegar and add whatever veggie is languishing in my fridge. Carrots, celery, mushrooms. They are all good in this salad. I also use brown jasmine rice instead of white for extra nutrients and flavor.

Hubby was having upset stomach, so I left out the cajun seasoning entirely, and this salad still turned out great. Can't wait to try it with some spiciness to it.

Ugh... I think the cajun spice mix I used was primarily salt. Be careful of this, otherwise you will taste little besides salt.

Cheap, easy, delicious - all important things when I'm cooking on a Grad. Student budget/schedule. I craved more vinegary tang so I added additional vinegar (I used red wine vinegar) and some Crytal Hot Sauce. This will become a refrigerator staple!

A great change-of-pace dish that's really easy. I recommend kidney beans rather than cajun traditional red beans. This sweeter bean works well in a salad dish. The recipe begs a standard ingredient list for the cajun spice. I use: 1 Part Garlic Powder, 1 Part ground chili powder, 1 Part Paprika, 1 Part onion powder, 1/2 Part marjoram, and 1/2 Part cayenne Mix ingredients well and store in a sealable container. I also prefer malt vinegar.

This recipe was a blast, it had us all rising out of our seats with tears in our eyes. The sliced green onions brought out my Dad's infamous sour banana essence. We will reserve this recipe for family functions only. It's darn tootin' good!

Delicious and easy to prepare. I added some chicken sausage for my carnivores at home. (BTW - I only used 3 teaspoons of cajun/creole seasoning)
