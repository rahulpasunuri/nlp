I've made this many times. I follow the recipe, but add only milk, no cream. It's still plenty thick. Using dried herbs, I think the amounts are sufficient for flavor. Most recently, however, I also included 1/2 teaspoon each of Old Bay and summer savory. I don't add the shrimp until shortly before serving, just long enough for them to heat through. This was the best batch ever.

followed the advice of reviewer leahdamron.I did add a can of cream corn and used Penzeys seafood base for my stock, removed some of the potatoes before blending so the chowder would have some bite. Turned out wonderful and thick without the cream. Great flavor and low fat too.

I read the reviews and added my own touch. My daughter only wanted steamed shrimp so of course I had to steam the shrimp 1st my way of course. 1 cup water 1 cup apple vinegar Old Bay@. The main changes I made were: 1 table spoon Thyme 1 table spoon of Old Bay@ 3 cups of finished mixture blended in food processor for taste. Other than those three things it was perfect!

I thought this recipe was actually rather gross. Something about the combination of such heavy dairy, creamy corn and shell fish just didn't sit right. I'll never make it again.

My family enjoyed this, and it sure was simple. To reduce fat intake, I used half and half instead of whipping cream, and it was very good and certainly did not taste like a de- fatted recipe.

This chowder was quite tasty with the substitution of seafood stock for water. I used fresh corn and threw the cobs and the shrimp shells in to simmer with the stock for extra flavor before straining. Used sweet onion, red potatoes, half 'n half rather than whipping cream, and a generous amount of fresh thyme. Pureed aprox. 3 cups soup in blender for texture modification. Topped with grated pepper Jack and served with crusty bread. Hearty and savory but not too heavy.

I would make this again, because I took the advice of the other reviewers and modified it quite a bit. First I cooked three slices of bacon (diced first). Then I removed them and sauteed the onion, pepper, and two minced shallots in the drippings. I added 3 T. of flour and cooked for three minutes. Next I added 4 c. of chicken stock and 1 - 8 oz. bottle of clam juice - brought to a boil, then added the potatoes. When the potatoes were done I threw in 3/4 bag frozen corn. Then I pureed most of it with my stick blender, and then threw in FROZEN shrimp that had been p & d'd. Because of the flour step (and the pureeing), this soup was PLENTY thick. So I left out the cream all together, just added about 1/3 c. half and half for the big finish. Somewhere in there (can't remember, I was helping my kids with their homework!!) I also added about 1 t. cumin, 1/2 t. cayenne, 2 t. chili powder, SALT (!!!) and pepper. I served it with minced scallion (didn't have chives) and the bacon. It was great!! Sorry this is so long but this recipe needed major help.

This is a great starting point for a delicious shrimp and corn chowder. The 2-fork rating goes up to 4 for this soup with some adjustments: I heeded the advice from others who suggested to add flour, chicken stock and chili powder. I also added: pancetta, 1 small bottle of clam juice and ancho chili powder. Feel free to add a dash of your favorite seafood spice blend too. I made it a bit less fattening by using milk and skim milk. Yum!

As is, this recipe gets 2 forks, it's pretty bland. However, I made alterations as many have suggested (browning some chopped bacon, sauteeing onions and peppers in the bacon fat, adding a bit of flour for roux, using stock not water, using frozen corn only, not creamed corn, adding cayenne, chili and curry powders, nutmeg, and chopped jalapeno). However, the ingredient that really turned it into a 4 fork recipe was the zest of one lime added at the end of cooking. It gave the chowder a great depth of flavor that was missing even with all those other additions, and contrasted nicely with the spiciness.

I would make it with modifications. The suggestions are all helpful and make for a better recipe. The adding of curry powder, chili, and nutmeg really gave the soup a nice flavor. It needed to be thickened but tasted very good and satisfying.

like a lot of reviewers, i made some changes. i used chicken brother instead of just water, used corn cut of the cob, and threw a couple of jalapenos with the the potatoes. it made the soup just a little bit spicy. really delicious soup!

Great basic recipe. I replaced the water with chicken broth, which gave it a little more depth.

This is a great chowder, if major adjustments are made. I began by browning the chopped onion and red bell pepper, with a bit of finely chopped tasso (could substitute bacon), in 1/4 stick of butter. Then, added 2 tablespoons of whole wheat flour, which provides a much-needed thickening agent and a nice texture. To this mixture, I added 4 cups chicken broth instead of water, 3 large (peeled & coursely chopped) potatoes, and 1 bag of frozen corn (defrosted) instead of the 2 canned versions listed. I used 2 cups of whipping cream and 2 cups of milk with 1 pound of shrimp, adding a bunch of fresh, chopped shallots at the end. May need to use hand blender (but don't overdo it) to get consistency desired. Too thin to serve immediately but perfect after a night in the fridge. Will definitely repeat this version of the recipe.

My family LOVED this soup, and it's the easiest chowder recipe I've ever made. But like the many of the other reviewers, I also did some subtle alterations. I added a small amount of cooked bacon during the simmer step, and I used one and a half cups of cream and only a half cup of milk. I also added salt, fresh ground pepper, and a pinch of curry to taste. I froze the leftover soup, but it didn't even last a week -- and this from a family that detests leftovers!

I agree with the other cooks that this recipe needs some adjustments. It definitely needs a flavor booster so starting with some chopped bacon (like you do with most chowders) is a good suggestion. Cook bacon until crispy, add onions and red bell pepper (roasted red bell pepper would be even better) and saute for a few minutes. Adding a little flour at this point is a also good suggestion, as the cook from Central NY pointed out, because my chowder came out very thin and I had to add a slurry of corn starch and cold water at the end to thicken. Substitute chicken, fish, or vegetable stock for the water for more flavor. I always have a bag of peeled, deveined shrimp in my freezer, so there was no work to be done there! I also agree that some added spices would make this chowder more flavorful. Experiment with what you like. This is a hearty chowder and stands on its own as a satisfying supper meal on a cold winter day.

A few changes yield a great soup for a snowy evening. (Made according to recipe it's weak flavor is a disappointment.) Changes include adding a leek, a bay leaf during the simmer, and cayenne to taste at the end. Used stock for the water ( a mix of lobster and chicken)and corn that had been cut from the cob and frozen since summer, no creamed corn. Most important, start with a few slices of julienned bacon(matchstick size)cook several minutes, add the onion/leek til softened, then a bit(1-2T) of flour and mix well. Cook for 8-10 minutes til nicely browned. Add the stock and scrape the bottom of the pan very well to loosen those flavorful bits. Proceed according to recipe and....voila! You can pretty much toss the shrimp in the pot and take it off the heat to prevent overcooking. Next time I'll add a dash of sherry to each bowl to play up the sweet flavor of the corn.

The following changes made this dish incredibly delicious, earning raves from everyone who tried it. I used one cup of heavy cream and one cup of low-fat milk, two cups of whole kernel corn plus a half a cup (thawed frozen that was lying around in the freezer) but no creamed corn, and most important--added spices. Very carefully, a little at a time until it was well balanced I used curry, nutmeg, chili and cayenne pepper. The results were worthy of any gourmet restaurant; my often critical (when it comes to food, I mean!) husband was raving with praise! Another tip--the shrimp cooked a lot faster than 8 minutes and you don't want them to get dry, so watch them carefully. Oh, I forgot to say, I followed another reviewer's advice about using vegetable broth instead of water and I think that was a factor in the soup's success as well. M. Brandt Brooklyn, NY

Quick, easy, tasty & filling. Used 3 med-lg potatoes; reduced water to 2 cups; used 1 cup light cream, 1 c milk; frozen cooked shrimp; green peppers instead of red gave more colour. Tasty as is or add curry powder for more zip. With fresh bread, a meal on it's own.

Nice and easy. Although I can see where people might think there isn't enough of that corn flavour. Easy fix, add more creamed corn. I used veggie broth instead of plain old water and I threw in some bar clams that I had dug up that morning. It was a good soup that got lots of "mmms" at the supper table

I was not blown away by this recipe....I only used one large potato and cut the water by about half, but was disappointed by the lack on "corn" flavor. Overall, it was a little bland for my taste.

A filling and satisfying soup that is easy to make!

This was a very easy and delicous soup. We don't care for bell peppers, so we left them out. And instead of the shrimp, we used some turkey ham which added a nice salty flavor to the mellow soup. We also put in a few drops of Cholula hot sauce right before we served it. Nice zip!

Great recipe !! I substituted precooked salad shrimp since I had that on hand. It did not detract from the final dish whatsoever.. Everyone raved about it.

This is a deceptively simple recipe that makes your family and guests think you've spent a lot more time in the kitchen than you actually did. It's colorful, delicious and simple. I will make this one often.

I love this recipe! It's so easy, it's delicious and it is very colorful. Serve with a nice crusty bread. I've added this one to my "tried-and-true" recipe book!
