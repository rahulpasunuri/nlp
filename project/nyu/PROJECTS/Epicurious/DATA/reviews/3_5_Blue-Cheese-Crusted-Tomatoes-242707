Liked the topping and the blue cheese and the beefsteak tomatoes were perfect after about 12 minutes, but it's too much tomato and not enough topping. Next time, I'll do halved tomatoes or maybe even smaller portions.

I adore this recipe. I cut out the stem/core and then slice down the center vertically. Then, turn each half on its side add the topping and put into the oven. Cooks quickly, is delicious and just the right texture. I found that the oven at 400F worked best. The broiler just cooked the top and left the tomato still nearly uncooked. Will definitely make again, I've made this more than 10 times so far this summer.

Made with vine-ripened tomatoes, and it was just too runny. When cooked the full 13 minutes, the tomatoes were pretty well disintegrated. The flavors were amazing, so perhaps it would work better with plums, or I would recommend doing a little scooping and juicing if you can, without harming the skin structure that needs to stay intact to hold the entire thing together.

Definitely cut tomatoes in half and use both, no reason to throw away 1/3. We liked, definitely has a stewed tomato feel, but we enjoyed. I think it was partially because we were waiting for the blue cheese topping to melt. possibly a grill-broil method would be better?

Pretty boring side, although quick.

What a find. I will make these often in the future. As the recipe says, cut the top 1/4 off - not 1/2. Then scoop out some of the center but not near the sides. Take off the grill using tongs and a spatula and they will keep their shape.

Out of necessity, my first attempt at this recipe was with roma tomatoes from the garden. I cut them in half and used a melon baller to take out the center. They were delicious! The only reason I am at 3 forks, is b/c when I tried again with larger, store bought tomatoes, they were not nearly as good. I also did add fresh basil and barsley to the breadcrumbs and it added nice taste and color. Will definitely make again with the romas...perfect appetizers and bite size, too!

After reading the reviews I added sauteed chopped onions with the blue cheese. First I scooped out the seeds to make more room for the cheese and onions. I sprinkled the tomatoes with salt and pepper. After filling the tomatoes with the cheese and onion I topped them with panko and then sprinkled with a little olive oil. I baked them at 350/ convection for about 20 minutes. They could have been done more. I didn't want to mess with the grill but I do think that would be a better heating method. I love stuffed tomatoes and am always looking for or creating new recipes.

The flavor of this side dish is delicious. The texture of the tomatoes was somewhat mushy. I will make these again, however, I will try them quickly broiled the next time.

Easy and yummy. I sprinkled the cheese and breadcrumbs over grape tomatoes and set them over the grill on aluminum foil.

Great recipe. We used panko crumbs with seasonings instead of bread crumbs. We used garden tomatoes and halved them to make a great size portion. Will definately make this again!

Ewwww! Please, no more peasant food recipes!

These were just okay for me. I made them in Italy so I had to use gorgonzola. Given the quality of Italian tomatoes, olive oil, breadcrumbs, and gorgonzola, I can't explain why they didn't blow me away! Won't be making them again (unless I add sauteed onions and herbs like a previous review suggested).

Addition to below post: I liked these much better eaten the next day at room temp. They had firmed up a bit and weren't so "stewy".

Hmmm.... Really thought I'd love this, but not so much. I agree with previous reviewer - kind of tasted like stewed tomatoes - not the texture I was expecting - and the blue cheese flavor I thought would really pop kind of melted into obscurity. I used panko and some fresh herbs in the topping as others suggested and halved the tomatoes, cutting out a small cavity for the cheese, but the outcome was disappointing. Nonetheless, I'm not going to give up on this just yet because I can see the potential and I'm assuming I did something wrong (overcooking? I roasted for 13 min @ 375 instead of grilling; or maybe not enough cheese?). I'll play around with this a bit and try it again before I declare defeat.

Flavor was ok, texture was strange. Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of stewed tomatoes.

WOW!!! Great combination of tastes. I cut some of the seeds out so the Blue Cheese stayed inside. Even the kids at our BBQ loved them. 4 forks!!!

I made this last night. It was good -- but definitely make sure to use fairly sturdy tomatoes, so that they hold up on the grill. I also mixed some fresh herbs into the breadcrumbs. Would definitely make it again -- took all of five minutes to prepare, ten to cook, and both picky child and hungry husband liked them.

I agree with orangeloll from Toronto- next time I'll do tomato halves. Nice and rich. Did these in the oven with oven fries. Lovely side dish.

We celebrated the first day of summer with an informal BBQ last night. I used large native tomatoes and Panko bread flakes. These delicious tomatoes were accompanied with boneless rib eye steaks. Perfect.

So easy to prepare and very popular at our bbq. Made with organic heirloom tomatoes, delicious!

Very good! Make sure to use great tomatos - homegrown or Farmer's Market...makes all the difference.

Great with steak or lamb. I used romas and cut a 1/4 wedge out of the side of the tomato for more area to stuff. I also sauteed finely chopped onions, added fresh herbs (Itl. parsley and oregano)to the bread crumbs before stuffing.

Very easy and very good. After slicing off the top of the tomato, I cut out part of the center making a cavity into which I stuffed the blue cheese. This kept the cheese on the tomato.

These were good. I love blue cheese so I enjoyed the topping. Next time I might halve the tomatoes and do it that way because it seemed like a whole lotta tomato for some reason! Definitely simple and party friendly.

I served this at a grill party and it got great kudos from the crowd. Everyone loved it. It's an easy make-ahead dish as well, just assemble and stick in the fridge until you're ready to grill. We used fresh tomatoes from the garden and this was just an outstanding first course for our grill-out. It was rich, though, and one tomato half was good per person.
