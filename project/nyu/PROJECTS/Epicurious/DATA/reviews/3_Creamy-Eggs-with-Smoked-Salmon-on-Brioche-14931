I have several versions of this dish in different cookbooks, using either light cream, sour cream or butter in the eggs. The art of soft, creamy scrambled eggs has eluded me for years, but these were foolproof. I used a whisk, a la Chef Vongrichten, and instead of sliced salmon, added creamed smoked salmon roe in the last minute of cooking. I brushed challah with butter on one side, truffle oil on the other. My guests raved about the perfect "pasty" and rich flavors. 8 eggs was more than enough for brunch for 7, with warm goat cheese salad with port & pancetta dressing (also on this site) and finished with ginger pancakes with warm mango-lime sauce.
