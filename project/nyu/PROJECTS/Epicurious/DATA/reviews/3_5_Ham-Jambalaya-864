Sorry previous review has an error. The corn bread was cooked in the corn cob pan.

Excellent and low calorie. Instead of oil I sprayed pan and decreased cayenne by half and the spice was just right for us. Cooked in cast corn cob pan. Very pretty. Served w/ zucchini corn bread.

Excellent! Cooked rice separately, added frozen peas. Hearty one dish!

Awesome, my husband loved it. It was so good I might serve ham more often in the year to have left overs to make it. I did use 3/4c vegetable broth in place of the wine and used brown jasmine rice. Because of the brown rice I knew it would have to cook a little longer (50 minutes) so I chopped my veggies a little bigger to keep them from getting mushy plus used a little less cayenne as my husband doesn't care for too much heat. The only complaint was that it wasn't enough for 4 people to have seconds.

YES I know I spelled Bon Appetit wrong.... I'm human .. but the adjustments are perfect!!

I have been making this since the recipe first appeared in Bon Appitit in 1995. The only changes I have made are to let the spices bloom in the onion and pepper mixture before adding the wine, let that deglaze the pan and then add the tomatoes and follow the recipe from there. A great touch is to add some peeled and deviened shrimp in the last 5 minutes of cooking. No one has ever been disappointed with this meal!! NO ONE EVER!!!!

I made this recipe with good results. I did not add more liquid or serve it over rice cooked separately, like a gumbo. I wanted jambalaya, not gumbo. Great use for leftover ham from the holidays.

Very good! We enjoyed it with homemade corn muffins. Following the advice of others, I made the rice separately with chicken broth, but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. I did add some Creole seasoning instead of cayenne pepper, and the heat was just right for us. Nice way to use up leftover baked ham.

Good but not excellent. And I added more water to rice cz the water from vegetables was not sufficient.

Made the recipe as shown adding a little more wine. It was so good that there has been a request for it again tonight. We won't even wait for leftover ham in the future. Quick and easy.

This is one of my favorite 1-pot meals. It also freezes well, so I usually put half in the freezer to pull out on nights when I don't feel like cooking.

clearly, the creators of this recipe left out some liquid or had way too much liquid from the veggies....the chicken broth is a must. Easy, hearty, good recycle menu item...we added chicken leftovers as well. Crusty french bread, salad, and dinner is on. Our family needed more spice, not less...but living in Cally does give them a taste for HOT. (can you say TOBASCO). Shake shake shake

I had left-over ham and decided to try this recipe. WOW! What a surprise. The dish was delicious. I also added a cup of frozen green peas. My husband will love to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Four forks and I will do this recipe again and again.

Took many suggestions from previous reviews - cooked the rice separately using chicken broth as liquid, added 3/4 pound cooked shrimp before serving, and added cayenne carefully. Great dish to prepare early in the day!

Very tasty, very easy, quick with little mess. A great way to use any leftover ham. This is a keeper and probably one I'll always pull out when I have some extra ham on my hands. Yum.

This dish was easy to make and I would actually rate it "2.5 forks". Maybe it would be better if I hadn't thrown in some shrimp, a little dry white wine and a splash of clam juice?! I'd make it again when I want a comfort food and have the ingredients on hand. I read other users reviews and was a little surprised that they cut back on the cayenne and still thought it was too spicy. I liked it with the recommended 1/2 tsp. and so did my husband, who doesn't like spicy food. He liked the recipe a lot and didn't even comment on the "heat". To each their own!

Loved it. Thought it looked strange putting it together but well worth it. Great use of leftover ham. I'm from New England so I might cut a little of the red pepper.

Easy and we loved it. I will cut back on the cayenne pepper next time even more than I did the first time. I like things hot, but this was a bit to hot.

Rating: 4
HOOOWHEE! That is good jambalaya! I used one green pepper instead of two and cooked the rice ahead of time. I substituted 1 tsp Balls Cajun seasoning from Louisiana for the cayenne. Let the sauce cook down for the 20 minutes and then added the cooked rice for another 10 min. My husband loved it. Shrimp and/or sausage would be a perfect addition!

This dish was great, even better as leftovers. The only down side was my eight year old would not eat it. Next time I will tone down the chili powder and see if we can compromise on enough heat for the adults but not to much for kids.

Enjoyed the recipe. Made it with brown rice and it turned out great. Will make again when I have left over ham.

Wonderful way to use the last of our Christmas ham. My significant other adored this dish...I made it as instructed with no substitutions...I also cooked the rice with the rest of the ingredients and it turned out just fine. Will make again when leftover ham appears in the fridge!

I made this last week while camping. It was a great one-pot meal, and even better the next morning with scrambled eggs. (Of course, it took a bit longer than 25 minutes on a campstove, in the wind, at a high altitude!) Very tasty and simple to prepare.

Tasty and quite easy to make. I happened to have not had white wine on hand, so I used white port which worked quite well.

excellent use for leftover ham. I add 1 sliced (turkey) chorizo sausage and I increase the rice to 1 c. and add a cup of chicken broth. Lots of slicing and dicing, but you can do that ahead.

So easy! Tastes good even without the wine and peppers.

delicious and easy

This is a great dish. I cooked the rice (we prefer brown rice) separately as advised by some critics. During the last ten minutes, I mixed in the cooked rice to absorb the flavors. During that time I also placed 3/4 pound large raw shrimp on top of the mixture. They were cooked perfectly and made the dish very special. I will certainly make this again.

I have made this recipe several times with several different types of meat, and it has turned out great everytime! I use a 1/2 cup of dry sherry, "Louisiana seasoning" instead of just cayenne, and I lessen the amount of onion. It's become one of my fall-back recipes when I have to feed guests and I don't want to spend the entire time in the kitchen.

What a nice way to use up leftover ham from Easter! Quick, easy and tasty. I cooked the rice separately, added 1/2 cup chicken broth, and some spicy sausage.

This recipe was very good and easy! I took some of the other reviewers' advice and added 1/2 cup chicken broth, and it turned out great. I also cooked the rice in the same pot as well. I also agree with other comments that some shrimp would be great in this dish!!

I took the advice of another and added a 1/2 cup of chicken stock.........fantastic the next day.

For the minimal amount of effort required, this dish is awesome. I substituted kielbasa and cooked rotisserie chicken meet for the ham. I also suspected this was going to be dry, so I added about 1/2 cup chicken stock with the other liquid ingredients. Makes great leftovers too.

This was just great! No. Not authentic jambalaya, but good nonetheless. Easy, quick & filling. I also cooked the rice separately. Not much liquid in the recipe. I used 1 14oz can of diced tomatoes & same size can of stew tomatoes. Perfect way to use left over ham. I can see shrimp, okra & smoked sausage as additions/substitutes!

Cooked rice separately and added shrimp. Spice flavor just a bit off. Good but not a REPEAT.

wonderful recipe for leftover ham. I thoroughly enjoyed it and so did my brother. I also cooked my rice separately and served the Jambalaya over it. I added a pound of cleaned raw shrimp at the very last, I would recommend doing that if possible. This is a fail safe recipe and I will definitely make it again soon.

I am glad I used advice from a few reviews. I also made the rice separately and used a Creole seasoning but added fresh basil. I would add shrimp and okra the next time.

This was great. I cooked the rice separately, tho, so it wouldn't absorb too much liquid. Great leftovers.

Made this for a small New Year's Eve party and it was quite the hit. Used turkey ham and added some chicken linguisa. Outstanding the next day, too.

A good use for leftover Christmas ham. Spices were just right.

A good basic jambalaya recipe. I substituted hot Italian sausage, pre-browned and sliced, for part of the ham. Instead of the herbs and spices called for, I used about 1 1/2 teaspoons Cajun Creole Seasoning, made by The Spice Hunter. Note: they also package pink peppercorns which are hard to find. To the jambalaya, I added 1 can low-sodium chicken broth. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Excellent recipe. Used chicken broth in place of wine.

Very easy and very flavorful! Chicken, sausage, etc. would be tasty substitutions for the ham. I added extra wine and water for more fluid for the rice. I'll definately make this again.

Sensational! Our Christmas ham leftovers became our New Year's Day simple supper. It was wonderful with cornbread muffins. We also served collard greens and blackeyed peas; they were compatible with the jambalaya and are our traditional New Year's Day good luck dishes.

I also substitute a spicy sausage in place of ham.
