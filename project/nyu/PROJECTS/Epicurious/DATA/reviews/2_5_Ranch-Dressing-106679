Didn't have any buttermilk so I "clabbered" the yogurt with a tablespoon of lemon juice. Then added 1 teaspoon turmeric, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon powdered sweetener. Rave reviews!

Little bit less yogurt and little gain mayonnaise and butter milk. Add grated and then dice cucubmer and red onion. Taste like resturant style! MMMM!

I followed the recipe and the result was so thin & bland I almost just dumped it. I thought I could rescue it but after adding more mayo, and herbs it was still just so-so. I'll find another recipe for Ranch.

A little bland. Spice it up with some red pepper flakes and more onion and garlic.
