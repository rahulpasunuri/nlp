The taste was good--very peppery with the basil. However, the salsa is very thin and runny. I didn't think it looked particularly attractive just spooned on the tomato slices, so I would recommend a gentle tossing together of the two. I used both red and yellow heirloom tomatoes so it did make a very attractive side dish for a summer meal, once I spread the sauce around. Really good summer tomatoes is a must for this!
