Delicious and got compliments from my husband. I used whole wheat pasta and added some cream and frozen peas (traded in healthier pasta and peas for some cream). I was nervous about poaching eggs so I used boiled egg. For such an easy dish to make and so few ingredients (which are mostly staples), outcome was great.

This was SO good! I doubled it for 2, and it turned out amazing! I had actually never poached an egg so I was doubtful if it would come out as beautiful as the picture, but, success! The taragon is what made it though, parsley would be ok I guess but if you're going to the store anyways, get the taragon!

A more refined carbonara - I didn't have parsley so I added a bit of thyme on top of the egg, which complemented the dish nicely.

Great recipe! I made it for 4 and should have added the cheese a bit slower as I had to throw out my cheese glob! But it was great. I also added some cream.

I followed the recipe exactly except I crisped pancetta instead of bacon. The pasta was unlike a heavy cream sauce but very complex and satisfying! I've saved it in the recipe box and will be making it again!

Love the poached egg on top!

Yum! Made with leftover pasta, and used a slurry of water and cornstarch in lieu of the pasta water. I also thinly sliced a clove of garlic in the bacon grease, before I tossed in the pasta. Made with parsley, and also added peas. Delicious and easy, and made with staples we always have on hand. Will definitely make again! I loved how this was so much less fussy than traditional caronara.

We sautéed shallots, mushroom, carrots and peas. It made for a lovely and speedy weeknight dinner, and the kids ate the veggies.

Oh wow this was easy and tasted great! I added some mushrooms as well, added the cheese at the end based on other reviews and used parsley and it turned out great!

I was initially won over by the simplicity of this dish, but the combination of flavors and textures made it a 4-star recipe. I doubled the ingredients and had more than enough for my husband and me. I forgot to add either spice (but will next time) and it was still delicious. I'm not a fan of poached eggs so I cooked two eggs over easy with nice, runny yolks. This is not a traditional Carbonara, but it is a wonderful altenative.

yummy & easy weekday meal. I normally am not a huge fan of tarragon (too licorice-y), but all the flavors went really well together. The egg was a nice touch. i agree that the cheese should be added at the end - mine got clumpy.

This tasted even better after we were done eating.. It's comforting but doesn't leave you feeling heavy. We doubled the egg and make sure you have yolk. Add a little bit of heavy cream to the sauce and we used tarragon not parsley. this is going in the rotation

bacon, eggs cheese and pasta...whats not to love?? its awsome comfort food! I did play with the recipe a bit- followed some ones suggestion about adding cream- heavenly! (fattening but yummy- and its only a tablespoon or two of cream). I also added a handful of frozen peas- mostly for color will definately be making this again

sauteed broc after the bacon but otherwise made as called for - wonderful; who cares if it's authentic or not

So delicious and easy! I added peas for a one dish meal. I was nervous about a poached egg on pasta, but it really works.

Authentic Schmauthentic. Who cares? This is delicious, easy, and fast. I confess to modifications. I added fresh chopped Italian parsley and a little half and half to the water/butter/bacon grease. Really, just a little. It was freakin' delish! The only downside is that I ate waaayyy too much of it!

YUM! Yes, I understand that it's not an "authentic" carbonara, but it's pretty darn close and it was ready in a flash. I always have all the ingredients on hand, so it will definitely be a "go to" dish from now on. I prepared the recipe exactly as printed and had no problems. Can't wait to make it again!

Nothing better than a simple recipe with only a handful of ingredients. The poached egg really adds a great layer of flavors to the rest of the dish. Would love to make it again using some higher quality bacon than what I got at the supermarket. I upped the amount of pepper used and would agree with other folks who said to add the cheese as the very end.

Basically this is "bacon and eggs with pasta", a quick and easy comfort food. You want "peppery", add more black pepper. I do agree with another reviewer to add cheese at the end to avoid clumping. Will definitely be making this again.

Linguine alla carbonara is one of my favorite dishes, and absolutely worth the carb and fat-loading. I'm skeptical about the poached egg, though and lack of white wine and garlic, which I use in mine (http://besottedgourmet.com/2009/02/17/pantry-dinner-linguine-alla-carbonara/). I'll try this version, but my instinct tells me that some fantastic dishes shouldn't be amended.

Love this dish! I made it with parsley, 2 eggs, and a little more of everything. It's super-easy, and everything in it is pretty cheap, but it all combines to make a great, savory, very filling meal. Definitely will make again! Only tip is I would add the parm in the last minute on the stove - mine melted too early and tended to stick together in clumps.

Made it vegetarian, which cut out half the hassle, and it was delicious. Instead of bacon just used the fake meat called Celebration Roast found at whole foods. Sliced it up into cubes and tossed in at the end with the pasta and parsley. Filling and tasty. A comfort dish for home.

This recipe is so easy and delicious! I used smoky pork belly instead of bacon and the flavor was fantastic! The poached egg on top looks so muc nicer than your traditional carbonera.

This is a simple "Pasta with a poached egg and tarragon(?) or parsley" NOT a "Carbonara" Not every pasta with an egg is Carbonara

I saw this in my magazine and became obsessed with it and couldn't wait to make it. I used pancetta instead of bacon but did use about 1/2 tsp of bacon fat to get the pancetta brown. My (italian) husband makes the best carbonara and he claimed this was a much better version and asked that we make this going forward. I love carbonara and now I don't feel as guilty eating it since this doesn't call for cream or raw egg. I'm glad I couldn't get the recipe out of my head. My mother made it the other day for my father and both thought it was great!

Great idea poaching the egg is much healthier than pan frying, but why stop there? Why not grill the bacon, and instead of black pepper, use green chilli (really high in Vitamin C to help fight against the flu epidemic), and add that extra punch! my blog

Seems like something's missing here.. I guess I just think it's odd that it's called "Peppery Pasta Carbonara" and the only pepper called for is the standard "season with salt & pepper" You see that in a lot of recipes that dont start with the word Peppery.

Great recipe but instead of frying the bacon, I sprinkle it with black pepper and bake it. Less fattening; great taste. Toss into pasta at the end. Also good with thawed but not cooked green peas!

This recipe was easy enough to make and was "okay," but it wasn't nearly good enough to seem worth the calories, IMO. I'm all for comfort food, but if I'm going to scarf down a plate of nutritionally void carbs covered in cheese & bacon fat, it better be knee-weakeningly delicious. This dish, I felt, was just kind of bland and greasy. I mean it wasn't BAD, but like I said, if I'm eating a fat bomb I want it to be much better than "not terrible." Next time around I'll spend a bit more time in the kitchen & make a really outstanding mac & cheese instead of this dish.

Agree with spicychef. I made this with parsley and it was still delish. Perfect mid-week meal.

Easy and fast. The tarragon and bacon are delicious together, though quite rich. I can see how parsley might lighten the dish with it's fresh flavor. I'll try that next time.

Easy-peasy weeknight meal, but I chose parsley because tarragon seems really out of place for this dish.
