Excellent recipe. I made it as directed and it was great. The white sauce needed quite a bit of salt and pepper, but otherwise was good. I would say that it's even better left over the next day!

Made pretty much as written, exception being I used regular lasagna noodles and boiled them before assembling. Also made sure to drain fat from the ground lamb after browning. Delicious dish and would make it again.

Great recipe! I ended up adding much more cinnamon and allspice to the meat sauce. It was still a little bland so I added some salt and nutmeg- it turned out great! Also, this white/bechamel sauce recipe is the best I have ever had!

Here's a concept. I made this TWICE as written and have found it on both occasions to be perfection. Just TRY it first. The modifications become a nuisance to read.

A truely great recipe. I made this for a pot-luck dinner, and it was devoured while two other lasagne dishes were only half consumed. Following the advice of others, I drained the lamb and onions, more than doubled the spices, and also used about 2½ to 3 times the total amount of cheese. The white sauce tasted bland, so I melted the Greek Kasseri into it. Also used Goat cheese which I mixed with the Feta. Ended up sprinkling parmesan cheese on top since I used up the other cheeses. I used DeCecco lasagne pasta (Lasagne larga doppia riccia), which I cooked for 4 minutes only. It came out perfectly. I wisely also started preparation several days before I finally put the dish together and baked it. It required about 35 minutes after the aluminum foil was removed.

WOW! What a great recipe. Doubled the spices and used goat and Kasseri cheese. Used skim milk for the white sauce so had to add extra flour and whisk for a longer duration. This recipe will be used many times!

Absolutely fantastic! Very authentic - tastes similar to meals I had in Greece! I tweaked the recipie a bit, so here are my suggestions: 1. Hubby likes lots of meat, so I used about 2lbs of lamb. DON'T SUBSTITUTE GROUND BEEF!! Lamb has a very distinct flavor & it wouldn't taste "Greek" w/o it!! 2. I sauteed the onions until they were soft & golden-brown so they don't taste so "onioney". I also used a bit more garlic. 3. After you mix the lamb in w/the onions & brown it, I highly recommed draining it thoroughly b/c lamb is really oily. First time I made this dish, I didn't drain it and although still delicious, it was swimming in oil. 4. I used quite a bit more tomato paste, maybe 5 tablespoons. I also used diced tomatos instead of whole. I put in 28oz, but would have used more if I had them. If you use more meat, I would definitely up the tomatos & paste. 5. I doubled the allspice & was quite liberal with the cinnamon. 6. I would cut the eggplant a little thicker. No need to drain it if you coat both sides of the eggplant slices w/olive oil before you bake it; it browns more evenly. 7. I used a bit more feta, 'cause it's delicious. :) I also used goat cheese crumbles. Goat cheese is a bit creamier and adds a little more cheesy deliciousness. This is a huge recipie, but it re-heats very well and is just as yummy the second time around! I also pre-made a batch and froze it. Just pop it in the oven and bake for pre-scribed time and you have a quick dinner for when you're pressed for time!

It's summer and I have homegrown eggplant and tomatoes - what a marvelous recipe for the veggies! Increased the spices as recommended by the other reviewers with good result. Spices perfumed my kitchen! Everything was delicously savory and mouth watering. This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent! Made this for company and took previous advice adding extra spice. It was a huge hit. I used leftover lamb leg which I ran thru the food processor and it was great. Great use of leftover lamb!

I made this lasagne for a dinner party I was having and prepared and assembled the whole thing the day before. I just popped it in the oven the day of the dinner. Yes, it does take some time to put together, but so do most lasagnes! I made a few changes: used ground beef instead of lamb (the lamb at the market did not seem fresh at all!), doubled the spices, added more tomato paste and a little more garlic. Also, this only really makes 2 layers, not 3, but it was pretty thick, I doubt I would want 3 layers anyway. The end result was fantastic! This was great comfort food and all the flavors came together really well. I can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow and will definitely make this again!

Wow! My Greek husband said this was the best eggplant he ever had - I agree! I doubled the spices, the garlic, and added 1 teas. cayenne, as recommended. I drained my diced tomatoes, and replaced the liquid with red wine. Also, I used 2 lbs. of ground lamb, and added 8 oz. of grated Greek Kasseri cheese to the feta. Used all the feta in the layers - sprinkeled the top with a little parmesan instead. I made a white pepper cream sauce - used 2 whole eggs plus one egg yolk, and added a couple dashes of nutmeg.

A fair amount of work, but worth every minute. Much easier if you prepare in advance. I tried it once as-is, which was good, but doubled the spices the second time and knocked it out of the park!

Double the spices, add some chili pepper flakes and halve the white sauce. Delicious and a huge hit with friends and family. Time consuming but it feeds an army; this is hands down my favorite winter recipe!

Maybe it's because it's the end of summer, and i've had it up to my eyeballs in fresh produce and veg. I wanted something meaty and hearty and baked. This recipe fit the bill perfectly. I had no problem 1/2ing the recipe. To bring out the spices, I used a cinnamon stick and whole allspice in the meat sauce, and then just took them out before assembly. Definitely a subtle recipe.

This recipe confused me. Both my husband and I were quite impressed with it, but found that our friends found it bland. I thought that it was a subtle and intriguing flavor just the way it is....not for the more simplistic palette.

This was tasty, but the lasagna noodles took longer to cook through than the recipe stated. I may well leave them out next time and make this dish as a straightforward moussaka. I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of whole.

Fantastic recipe. If you like lamb and feta, you can't go wrong with this one. Yes, this is a lengthy recipe, but with all the make-ahead options, a very achievable one in my opinion. We had this with Greek roast potatoes and a Greek salad. Didn't need anything more. Our 7-yr old polished off her plate before we did :).

Fabulous and different. I made this for a condo wine dinner and everyone loved it. I followed the suggestion to add more spices to the sauce. Even my husband the eggplant-hater liked it.

Rating: 4
Wonderful and definitely worth the effort! Takes about 1 hour to prepare all ingredients, if not done in advance. I poured the grease off of the lamb as well. I agree with doubling all of the spices. I also added 1 tsp cayenne pepper for a little extra kick, and will add a little more feta next time.

I love pastitsio and prefer it to most other lasagnes, so it was great to find a recipe that incorporates both concepts. I halved the recipe however I used the full amount for the spices. I accidentally added some dried chili flakes which ended up working really well. There were quite a few steps but it was well worth it as the result was delicious. I added white pepper and nutmeg to the bechamel and added some parm along with the feta. Next time I'd like to add some salty, briny olives to balance out the cinnamon.

I double (at least) the dry spices, which makes it much tastier! I've also added a bit of cayenne pepper with good results. I agree with another reviewer that you only need half of the white sauce.

I made and brought this to a neighborhood Greek dinner as a main course. There was so much food that it was hard to tell what was what on your plate. My husband and I thought it was very good but no other comments. When it comes to lamb you can never tell who's going to a fan! I made the recipe as written and if I make it again I would eliminate one layer - it is very thick. It is important to slice the eggplant as called for because you will not have enough slices to cover the layers. Interestingly, the cinnamon/allspice flavors really come through.

This lasagna has very interesting (and yummy) flavours in the meat sauce. It is essentially a moussaka with lasagna noodles in it.A few suggestions: Slice the eggplant more thinly than recommended. Otherwise, it is difficult to cut through (even though I broiled it far longer than recommended, it was tough). Also, you only need about 1/2 of the white sauce recipe. It is still plenty. Lastly, I also don't like the no-boil noodles. Instead, I use fresh lasagna sheets, which don't require boiling but they don't turn out mushy like the no-boil dried lasagna.

A lot of work for something not very special. The eggplant got lost. There are some fabulous lssagne recipes on this site, but IMHO this is not one of them.

This is a delicious recipe. I used goat cheese because i didn't have feta which was a good substitute. I will definately make this again.

Really good, but lose the no-boil noodles. With all the work required, might as well use the regular kind. Everytime time I've used the no-boils, I've been disappointed. Added more of all the spices and put in red pepper flakes. Put in a red jalapeno as well and the nutmeg in the white sauce was a good idea. Serves an army.

I found this rather fiddly to make but definitley worth it. I used diced instead of ground lamb for texture. I also added some black olives and sundried tomates to the meat sauce and a couple of bay leaves while cooking the white sauce. I will certainly be making this again.

Fabulous! I roasted red and yellow peppers for one of the layers. One of the best lasagnas ever.

This is a must!!! I used Jalepeno Feta Cheese instead and it came out absolutely amazing. I will definately be making this again!!

This is a tasty recipe. I would add more herbs & spices to the meat mixture along with more of a tomato note. I added more cinnamon & allspice & also a dash of cayenne. I also added a layer of roasted red bell pepper (jar or self-prepared). It's also nice to garnish with mint or even sprinkle some minced mint over the top. I also ran out of "white sauce" & would suggest making more.

Thanks to previous raters, I was sold on this recipe before I even got to the kitchen! My guests loved it, and it was easy to make! I made a couple of changes that I'd like to pass on the next lucky taster. (1) Season the eggplant - I mixed 1/8 tsp. cayenne and 1/4 paprika with the oil before brushing on the eggplant; then I seasoned w/ fresh ground black pepper and garlic powder before broiling (2) Add more kick to the meat sauce with 1/4 tsp. red pepper and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg (3) Reduce the calories in the white sauce by using 3 cups 2%/1% milk and 1 cup evaporated skim milk; follow the directions exactly as for 4 cups.

I loved all the falvor here but since I tend toward the whole grain and healthy stuff, I used whole wheat lasagne noodles, non-stick pans, made a low fat white sauce and grilled the eggplant rather than broiling it with oil. I would add just a bit of red pepper flakes and some saffron to the meat sauce the next time but overall a great recipe!

This is a great dish! I didn't use no-cook noodles, just reagular noodles and it came out perfect (I just made sure there was plenty of liquid). Its fool-proof.

I did everything I could to mess up this recipe. Overcooked the eggplant (it was very dark & I had to scrap off burnt pieces); I didn't buy enough eggplant; I couldn't find no-cook, so I had to par boil noodles; and I don't think I got the white sauce roux quite cooked enough before I added the milk --- however, in spite of it all, it was absolutely delicious. I tried to cut the recipe in half...and next time, I won't. I'll just make it as written and there will be a next time...it's just yummy.

This was definitely 4 forks when reheated the next day!We made 2 changes - used precooked noodles (didn't use all the juice from the tomatoes)and we added some grated Mizithra cheese to the white sauce.Be sure the eggplant slices are cooked & tender before layering.A hearty and impressive dish for fall & winter.

Absolutely delicious! This recipe didn't seem time-consuming at all since I made the meat sauce one day; the white sauce the next; and cooked the eggplant, assembled, and baked on the following day. Everyone who tasted it said that it's very, very, very, very good.
