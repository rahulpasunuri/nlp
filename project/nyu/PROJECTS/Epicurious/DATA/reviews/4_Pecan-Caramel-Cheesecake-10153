The brown sugar instead of white sugar gives this cheesecake a wonderful flavor. Put your crust all the way up the sides for a cleanest look and be careful when melting the granulated sugar fort he butterscotch. Really low and slow. Awesome cheesecake.

Very fancy looking, yet super easy to make. I took this to a bridal shower and got rave reviews, everyone was asking for the recipe. I thought each component (Cust, filling, topping) was only ok by itself, but the finished product was quite tasty!

I changed the recipe slightly, in that I used gingersnap cookies in the crust instead of graham crackers, and I baked in mini muffin papers to be bite-sized for a party. It worked really well, baked for about 20 minutes. The caramel really is essential - I thought the brown sugar in the cake would give it good flavor, but I actually felt it was a little bland which is probably intentional so it doesn't compete with the caramel. I didn't have any trouble making smooth, beautiful, easy-to-work with caramel following the recipe directions exactly.

I followed others advice and the water bath worked great, The caramel was very tricky and I had to try it twice. I felt 225 degrees was just too high and the caramel was rock hard the first time. I also chopped the pecans to sprinkle on top and I added a chocolate ganache type swirl just before serving to make it even more special. I also used light cream cheese and fat-free sour cream and it was perfectly tasty. I love the upscale character of this cheesecake with just a bit extra work!

Where do I begin? This cheesecake is delicious!! I agree, the caramel is like no other caramel I have ever tasted. I doubled the topping with no trouble. I strongly recommend a water bath. My cake cracked (as I predicted) however, the caramel filled in the cracks and did not cover them. The sugar in the caramel does turn to rock candy, however, don't panic and start over (like I did!), the sugar will dissolve like the directions say. Also, be sure to add the ingredents in order. I made two and forgot to add the flour after the brown sugar. I added it after the eggs and it was a little dull and flat looking. I plan to make this one for times when I want to impress guest.

Beautiful, rich and delicious. The caramel is time consuming to make, and it did clump into a ball and take many minutes to relax. Next time I'll follow advice and add the second infusion of sugar by itself and melt, then add heated cream slowly. If the recipe itself had included these directions results would be uniformly better. Why guess? The caramel really was the best I've ever tasted. The cake did crack some (didn't use a water bath) but the caramel neatly covered the damage. Next time I will coarsely chop the pecans and sprinkle them around the top edge, rather than placing whole pecans on top. Makes for easier cutting. My guests raved about this. And like most cheesecakes, it benefits from a day or two of rest in the refrigerator so it's a perfect make ahead dessert.

A water bath is when you wrap your springform pan with foil and place it into another larger pan. You then fill the larger pan with hot water until it reaches half way up the side of the sprinform pan. You place into the oven and bake the cheesecake. This in called a water bath.

I have made ths recipe twice. The first time the cheesecake cracked, but it was not noticeable when you put the thick caramel sauce on top. The bath does work. To the other cook, you wrap the springform pan in foil and set it in a roaster pan and then pour water in the pan. Water should come up half way to the sides of the springform pan. This really prevented the crackng. The caramel topping takes quite a bit of time, but I do agree it is worth it.

Great tasting cheesecake. I also had a problem with the cheesecake cracking very badly in the middle. I was able to cover it up by grouping some pecans in the center. Being the novice cook I am, I am not familiar with the bath idea that previous users mentioned. Can anyone explain this technique?

Delicious! Very impressive and pretty easy, too - everyone LOVED it. The cheesecake is very rich - I used 1 lb. regular cream cheese and 1 lb. light cream cheese. The caramel sauce is totally worth making. Just make sure you add the cream and extra sugar SLOWLY, or you will have a hardened ball of candy mass on your hands that will take a loooong time to melt.

This was my first cheesecake attempt and it turned out delicious! My youngest daughter who is not a great cheesecake fan even loved it (due to the caramel and pecans). First time making caramel also and while it took quite a while it was well worth the effort. Ended up with a beautiful display of 5lbs of cheesecake! Thanks.

My four (grown) kids loved it and my sister-in law said it was the best cheesecake she ever had! The top cracked badly, but I cut it into slices and covered the top with my own caramel sauce and no one noticed. Definitely a winner!

This was the best cheesecake I have ever tasted! It's the perfect desert for a dinner party - easy and impressive. I had the same problem as some other reviewers with the cake top cracking, even though I baked it in a water bath. (Could be because I have a decrepit electric oven from the 60's)The final presentation was beautiful, however, because the caramel topping covered any problems. I also sprinkled on some roughly chopped pecans for added garnish. I have to have another dinner party soon just to make this again!

Not only would I make this again, but all of my guests begged for the recipe so that THEY can make it, too! I used the Dulce de Leche Sauce recipe on this website instead of the topping called for in this recipe, and it was out-of-this-world, although I'm sure the caramel sauce in the recipe is also outstanding. I can't say anything bad about this. Everyone raved. It's absolutely delicious, or "Totemo oishii desu," as they say in Japan! P.S. If you love cheesecake, try the Coconut-Fudge Cheesecake on this website! It's another no-fail crowd pleaser that has always been a complete success form e.

Love this cheesecake. I leave out the pecans and draw designs in the caramel with chocolate syrup. Looks professional. I've made about 8 cakes and use a water bath and cool in the oven. I've had no problems with cracking. One of my favorites.

This is a great recipe. The first time I made it with the carmel sauce on top. The cheesecake was a little too sweet. The next time I made it, I drizzled the carmel on at the time of serving, then springled with pecans. It was fabulous. I will keep this recipe as one of my favorites.

Absolutely excellent and easy to make. The cheesecake did crack but the caramel covered it up nicely. Not only does it taste good but it came out looking like a pro made it.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving. Not too sweet, but very rich. The caramel on top made the recipe! Cheesecake was easy to make, but it took time in stages.

I LOVED THIS CHEESECAKE!! 1ST TIME I EVER MADE CARAMEL AND IT TRNED OUT PERFECT. YES IT TAKES A WHILE FOR THE SUGAR TO MELT, AND YES IT WILL TURN INTO A SOLID MASS WHEN YOU ADD THE CREAM, BUT IT WILL MELT AND BE PERFECT WHEN IT REACHES 225 DEGREES. TIPS TO PREVENT CRACKS AND MAKE A CREAMY CHEESECAKE: COOK IN WATER BATH, COOK FIRST HOUR @ 300, THEN NEXT HOUR @ 200. DON'T OPEN DOOR DURING COOKING, AND LEAVE IN OVEN UNTIL THE OVEN IS COMPLETELY COOL (EVEN OVERNIGHT). ALSO, MIX AS GENTLY (LOWER SPEED) AND AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. THE MORE YOU MIX, THE MORE THE CAKE WILL RISE THEN FALL AND CRACK.

I'm and American living in Germany. I've been looking for the ultimate cheesecake for a couple of months. To my mind, this is not it, but if you are looking for something decadent and sinful to impress people all over the world, then this is the cheesecake for you! I've never made caramel before, and almost had a nervous break-down doing so. How long is it supposed to take, and is it right that all the sugar gums up together before it melts again. What did I do wrong? I will make this recipe again. I'm passing this recipe on to my German friends, and am sure it will have a long life here, too.

Made this three times for potlucks and have received rave reviews. A number of people said it was the best cheesecake they ever ate. The top has always split but caramel sauce covered it. Mayby my oven is cooling off too soon. I added two tablespoons of grated candied ginger to the crust which gave it added flavor and some mystery.

The cheesecake split on top but it didn't matter; the carmel covered it up. Still, this recipe was a bit too sweet for my tastes, and I prefer cheesecakes with a bit more bite from sour cream or yogurt.

I made this cheesecake for a dinner party, everyone had seconds. I will be remembered for this cheescake

This was incredible- not a single slice was leftover. The caramel is time consuming- but definitely worth it. Texture and flavor- excellent! I made the cheesecake two nights before the party, and did the caramel and finishing touches the next night.

I also had a problem with the cheesecake splitting on the top. Does anyone have a suggestion? I'd like to make it again as I found it flavorful (not bland at all) and pretty to boot!

When I made this cheesecake it was overly fluffy and dry and fell apart. I have a new Kitchen Aid mixer. Did I overbeat it? Never have had this happen before. The caramel topping (which helped hold it together)and the crust were sensational! I want to make it again, but don't want the same thing to happen again.

I make desserts for our restaurant and what a hit this cheesecake is! The sauce is time comsuming, but I've found that if you dissolve the second addition of sugar and add cream after, that is heated to the scalding pt., it is easier to stir and doesn't take as long for the cream to reduce. I agree that the cheesecake itself is a little on the bland side, but the sauce more than makes up for it. Add some chocolate genache, and voila, Turtle Cheesecake, but better!

I'm sorry, but I was a little disappointed with this cheesecake. The topping was good, and the crust suggestion excellent, but I found the cake itself to taste like cream cheese and sour cream. It's just not the "magic" I like to create in my cheesecakes.

If you bake because you love to bake, this is the cheesecake you want to make. Since I discovered this recipe (just two months ago) I've made at least eight of them. These cheesecakes regularly are proclaimed "The best cheesecake I've ever had" by people who consider themselves connaisseurs of cheesecake.

i really give this recipe a 3 and one-half forks rating. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a perfect score is that by the time you are preparing the topping it would be too late for you to cook the main course... Is it worth the process and the wait? You betcha it is...it's fabulous...just remember to make this cake the day before so you can enjoy it too.
