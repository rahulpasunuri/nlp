I love garlic and herbs. I usually bake chicken at 350, but 400 brought out the juices in the chicken and it browned nicely. I just used chicken breasts which I cut in half and poured the juices back over. These will be good for a week of gourmet lunches or a very special dinner. Yumm!

I wanted to like this recipe because it isn't laden with butter, etc., and I have a large herb garden, but I agree with the cook from Michigan. I like garlic. I like herbs. But this recipe didn't do it for me.

I like garlic. I like fresh herbs. But this combination did not meet either with my taste or the taste of much of the family (who probably liked it a little better than I did). Too many other good recipes to try to do this again.

Yummy.. The roasted garlic with the herbs is wonderful. You must really like garlic.. Easy to prepare and impressive to serve. Will make again.

Delicious! Loved the roasted garlic flavor, especially with the herbs (heavy on the thyme; try tarragon as well). Roast for 1.1 hours. Enjoy!
