I've reviewed this recipe before but since making it at least 10 times, I've made some changes that may help. For those of you who thought it was too sweet, cut down on the brown sugar from 2 tablespoons to one, but don't cut it out completely. I've tried this recipe without it and it just doesn't work. Also, add more cilantro and lime at the end. My kids and hubby love crunchy taco shells so I purchase the brand name shells, heat them and fill them. We serve this meal with lettuce, green onions, olives, tomatoes, cheese, etc. All in all, a great recipe!!

Very good, very easy. Used hamburger, and simmered for only 10 minutes to let it meld. A little sweet with the sugar, but good with it. Sugar and tomato salsa are the low notes or base. Needs the lime to give it a high note at the end. I added a little more soy sauce. Reading the reviews, I added some ground cumin, which was good - about 1 tsp to 1 pound of meat (so about 2 tsp for this recipe that calls for 2 lbs meat). I served with fresh tomato chunks and black olives. Really good with crisp taco shells. Spiciness depends on salsa type used.

Ok, after reading the reviews I was sold on this recipe especially since I'm such a sweet eater. I simmered the meat 2 hours as per the other reviews. The meat was fantastic. However, when we made tacos with it, we thought it was way too sweet This might be good over rice like a regular stew, but once you add taco toppings, (avocado, sour cream, fresh tomatoes) it wasn't that good.

Why do the preparation directions begin with eggplant slices?? Too much wine for the chef??

Excellent recipe, easy to make, and always a crowd pleasure. I double the recipe as the meat is even better as leftovers! I, too, cut the meat into smaller pieces and simmer about an hour or two longer than the recipe calls for which makes the meat super-tender! I add a little spice to mine (cumin, chipotle power, etc.) and serve sour cream, pepper jack or cheddar cheese, and shredded lettuce on the side... and I NEVER leave out the lime and cilantro!! So great! Enjoy!

I have never reviewed a recipe on here ( all though we have enjoyed many). I made this tonight and split the recipe. Did half chicken and half steak (ny left over from the grill last night). AMAZING!! Also made the black bean,corn and rice salad and use that as a "base" for the meat in the tacos. RAVE reviews from the family. Will defiantly add this into the rotation. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and cut back the brown sugar to half. Also I seasoned the meat with ground chili pep, cumin, granulated garlic and onion. Really a nice and EASY meal.

Ignore the eggplant part it is a mistake in the recipe. I was a little nervous about this recipe, brown sugar & soy sauce don't seem right in tacos. I tried it anyway and it is great, the sugar cuts the acidity in the tomato salsa. It is a bit bland on spice, I added chipotle powder & ancho chili's for more spice. I cut the beef into small peices 1/2" and cooked it for 2 hours, so the beef isn't chewy. I'm taking it to a Superbowl Pary hopefully everyone will enjoy it!

OK, why does the preparation start off with eggplant but it's not in the ingredients? And since when are eggplants put in beef tacos??

This recipe is so, so good. It makes a delicious alternative to the usual taco fillings. I usually chop the meat pretty small, smaller than 3/4 inch.

I used this recipe for some ground bison I had picked up from the farmers market and it was very good - served on tacos with all the fixings. I used water instead of broth because I didn't have any on hand. This will definitely become my go-to way to prepare taco meat!

Too bad half forks aren't allowed, but the ease of preparation pushes this from a 3 to a 4. Made exactly per the recipe only cut the meat into three large chunks, seared then added remaining ingredients. Cooked for a couple of hours until beef was tender. Cooled the beef and sauce separately which was really not necessary as there was very little fat to remove. Shredded the beef, and reheated in the sauce. Ate the first night with corn tortillas and the second over polenta. This would be a great dish to make in quantity and freeze for a ski outing or other event.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe! My recommendation ... no tweaking!! I prepared it as written even after reading some of the changes recommended by others. We found the addition of the brown sugar a great compliment to the tomatoes ... it adds a richness to and mellows the sauce! This is now a favorite recipe, and the one I will use from now on for our taco nights! In the future I'll double the recipe in order to freeze half for another day!

This was delicious! I think if you tweak this recipe too much, well, then it's just not the same and you should just make your own taco meat. The brown sugar and the soy sauce gives the dish a unique, distinctive taste. I may try switching the soy for worcestershire and add some finely diced jalapenos, but other than that, I say leave as is and enjoy!

This worked out well. I read the reviews and agree that shredding the meat after cooking it quite awhile worked out well. I cut down on the brown sugar and added some different spices after tasting. Otherwise it was perfect for an easy and good recipe and got the thumbs up from my family.

We enjoyed this recipe. Like several of the other reviews, I added chipotle chile pepper, cumin and reduced the brown sugar. I also used ground lean beef because that is all I had on hand, and mixed in red and yellow pepper for colour. It worked very well. An easy mid-week supper.

Rating: 3
I agree with cook from North of Boston; easier to leave roast whole and shred after cooking. I cooked the roast in a pressure cooker for 80 minutes on high and it shredded beautifully. Left out the cilantro and added roasted jalapenos. Excellent dish and better the next day! 80 min

I did not add the sugar and I added chili power, cayenne, crushed red peppers and cumin. I thought it was very good. I kept mine on a low simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Used a fork to break the chunks down. Very good!

Rating: 4
Tried it two ways: small bits as written, and as roast browned then shredded and chopped afterward. I find the latter easier and prefer the texture. As others suggest, simmer longer, less sugar, and healthy shots of cumin and chili powder. Rolled mine w/cheese/chopped blk olive inside. Baked topped w/cheese, served w/chopped tomatoes and shredded lettuce. Awesome! Make a bunch and freeze extra for quick 2nds, nachos!

I was skeptical, but I absolutely loved how tender and flavorful the beef was here after simmering. I would double it next time. Can't go back to the ground beef tacos of my childhood when this is almost just as easy and much, much better.

Wow, this really is good! The slow cooking is the secret- add at least 30 minutes to really tenderize the meat. I made this for a Mexican Night with friends, and it got raves. I orignally doubled the recipe for 8, but thought it wasn't enough so made a second batch. At first I used Pace Salsa, then for the second batch used Pace Picante, and I think the picante is better. Don't skip the cilantro and lime at the end. Served with a mango salsa and a rice/corn/bean salad and margaritas, of course! My husband- a former avid packaged seasoning fan- said this will be our family taco recipe for all time. Enjoy!!!

This is a great recipe for other kinds of meat,also. I have used pork chunks and venison meat, and they were both delicious. I use a spicy peach salsa which gives it a nice flavor.

Inexpensive, easy to prepare, and tasty. I heeded the others advice and reduced the brown sugar by half (good call). I did add 2 heaping tablespoons of chilli powder, and 1 teaspoon of chipotle in adobo sauce and liked the results. Served over a buttermilk-cheddar corn bread, home-made guacamole, and lemon cucumbers sprinkled with chilli powder, and fresh lime juice.

Rating: 3
Apologies for rating when I tinkered with the recipe. It was too bland for me, so I started adding stuff like cumin and chili powder. I was out of chiles in adobo; ended up adding a touch of worcester and red chili garlic paste. Weird, i know, but good. A touch of the sugar might have been good, but my husband is low carb, so no go on that. I was just happy to have a new idea for how to fix beef for tacos (or taco salad!).

I too added a couple of chipotle peppers and sauce. Like other cooks I also let it sit for 1/2 hour longer. Very tender. My teen loved it. Superior leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

This is a great taco. I've made many time since I found the recipe. Cut back on sugar, only used 1 tbsp. More garlic, as always. This recipe would only serve 3 not 4 in our house. I cooked the meat for about 2 1/2 hours. Cut meat into thin strips, 1/2 inch by 1 or 2 inch long. Easier to eat than chunks. I used hard taco shells & make a few "double decker". ALWAYS double recipe, extra for freezer, plus added to pasta sauce makes a quick pasta dinner, too. Wonderful flavor. Use Pace Chipolte salsa, it seems to work the best out of all I've tried.

The best beef tacos I've ever had! I added cumin, cayanne pepper and mushrooms and it was delicious. My step-children called them gourmet tacos. We served it in hard shells, soft shells and my husband and I had it over lettuce since we are on a low-carb diet. Fantastic. I felt like a gourmet chef for a night!

This is a keeper. Of course I think it all depends on the salsa you use. We used Trader Joe's jar salsa and a big nice piece of chuck meat well cut up and trimmed. Used corn tortillas cooked in oil (I know, but they are so good that way!) and my whole family loved it and begged for more. Will for sure double the recipe next time.

Excellent! I already had the ground chuck before I found this recipe, but it worked very well anyway. Sauteed a small sweet onion before I added the ground beef. Since I only had one pound of beef, I used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce. Came out just terrific; next time I will use the chuck cubes. This will now be my standard beef taco recipe. The lime juice at the end really enhances all the flavors. Also served a platter of sliced tomatoes, shredded cheddar and shredded lettuce to top the tacos.

Forget the soy sauce, sugar, and beef broth. All that needs to be done is lightly coat the beef in flour, sear all the meat(high heat) in oil of choice until brown, add chopped onions, garlic and simmer for 2 minutes. Add black pepper, chopped tomatos, cumin then add water until meat is immersed(to deglaze during simmer process). Bring to a boil then lower heat to simmer, stir occasionally until meat is tender(1.5/2hrs) Keep water aside in case gravy thickens too soon(that happens when not enough water was added or too much flour coating was used). Add salt to taste(before meat is done). Then add remaining ingredients when served. Piece o' cake.

This is an amazing alternative to boring soft tacos with ground beef. Very easy to make and guest worthy I think. My husband requests these tacos often so I have the recipe memorized. I prefer to use Pace over a fresher salsa, it seems to cook better. I also like to serve the beef mixture in taco salads served in a fried tortilla shell.

I've made this a couple of times with ground beef and everyone said it was "very good". Last night I tried it as written and got "raves". My husband didn't even recognize it as the same recipee. Next time I'm going to double the recipee as this didn't go quite far enough!

This has become one of my favorite recipes to make! Not only is it delicious but EEEASY. When I first made this I was going to leave out the brown sugar, thinking it would make it too sweet, but it was perfect! The only addition I made to the recipe was more cumin. I've served this with hard taco shells and soft tortillas. Both were great. Another way to serve it is to assemble it with cheese, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes, green onions and olives. Yummy!

This is a delicious filling for tacos, burritos and tostadas! If I want a mild flavor, I use mild salsa; and if I want it spicier, I add medium salsa and add a jalapeno. It is truly better the longer it cooks.

Rating: 4
I doubled this recipe and still barely had any leftovers. My husband and kids all LOVED it. It is a very simple recipe - no need to mess with it. The key is using the best salsa you can find in the heat index that you can stand and plenty of garlic. I used a whole head. I don't think it would be as good if you skipped the browning step either. Make sure to allow plenty of time for it to cook, as the longer it cooks, the more tender it becomes. Only problem is...it smells so good while it's cooking, no one wants to wait!

I thought this was pretty good. I found the spiciness a bit lacking too (taste while you cook!). Added a red pepper I had sitting around, a couple of red chilies, some chili powder and cumin.

My husband and I were a little disappointed with this recipe after all of the rave reviews. We enjoy spicy food and even after adding some Crystal hot sauce we found it somewhat bland. Perhaps "hotter" salsa would have helped. Next time I'll add some cumin. We also thought the soy sauce flavor was too pronounced so will add less next time. I do think with some tweaking this would be a very good recipe.

This one's almost too good -- I made guacamole but the meat was so intensely flavored it overwhelmed the guac. But the flavor's great, so there you go. Also, the liquid dried up early on, so we had to add more and more beef broth.

The first time that we made this recipe we made it as written and we LOVED it. The next time we made it we didn't have beef, so we subsituted chicken breast for the beef and chicken stock for the beef stock and we liked it even more. Also, we found that the slight sweetness of wheat instead of flour tortillas makes an excellent change to this dish.

Very good taco filling, we scooped up the last of the sauce with tortilla chips. Served with sour cream, fresh pico, lettuce and cheese. I was concerned about sodium, used Victoria hot salsa and low-sodium soy sauce. I browned the meat, mixed and then set it in the oven at 275 for about 2 - 2.5 hours, finishing it on the stovetop. I think this would be good with chicken, has anyone tried it?

I used stew meat for almost 3 hours (sometimes the gas on my stove gets too low and slows down my cooking time.) I doubled the beef broth and forgot to add the cilantro and lime, which would have been good. My family wants this, not hamburger with packaged taco seasoning from now on. We like double decker tacos - soft tortilla spread with refried beans then wrapped around a hard taco shell, then fill as desired.

YUMMY! I used a cut-up chuck roast and cooked it in a pressure cooker on high pressure for 10 minutes. When it was finished the flavors didn't seem to quite have melded together. We ended up eating dinner about 2 hours later than planned so the beef sat on low during that time. It tasted MUCH better. My fiance enjoyed it too! I'll definitely make this again!
