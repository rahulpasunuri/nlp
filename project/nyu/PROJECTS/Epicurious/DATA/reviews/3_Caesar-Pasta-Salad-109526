I served this for the first time and enjoyed it; I added chicken (rotisserie chicken from market shredded), did not include croutons, and tossed the pasta in when it was still hot (and drained). Guests enjoyed it and we ate it again the next night. I served it with crusty garlic bread on the side.

I love this recipe. The dressing is perfect. Great for a buffet, great for a side dish, great as an entree.

This was good, but I had to double the lemon juice, dijon, and garlic. I added worcestshire sauce which really made a great difference to the flavor.

This sounded interesting, but 3 of 3 people thought it wasn't worth having again. I think it was because of texture rather than taste. Oh, well, they can't all be winners!

Although I enjoyed the recipe and thought that farfalle and romaine lettuce was a surprisingly good combination, the dressing leaves a lot to be desired. I found that the dressing was quite oily and it did not have enough taste to it to make the recipe really stand-out. I tried this recipe again with a different dressing and it was excellent. If you have a favourite caesar dressing, I highly recommend this.

Not sure if I will make again. Very quick and easy. It's just "ok" for me. The dressing isn't that great. Pasta with romaine is interesting but perhaps a different dressing would make it a definite keeper?

This is a terrific recipe. The dressing is delicious and the combination of romaine and the farfalle is great. It's easy, colorful, and would be a terrific addition to a summer buffet.

I wasn't sure how the lettuce would combine with the pasta and dressing, but wanted to try something different for a Memorial Day party. Everyone raved! They thought it was unique and delicious. Shrimp or chicken would be a nice addition. This salad is definitely in the four fork pasta salad category.
