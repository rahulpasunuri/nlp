I took this to a party the first time I made it, thinking it might not go over too well, but it disappeared in 5 minutes. I barely got any myself. A really delicious recipe.

We loved it! Quick, easy, and tasty. The toasted coriander seeds make the dish. We used just arugula because we had no Romaine.

I'm glad I decided to try this in spite of some of the reviews. Absolutely delicious! Light and refreshing and wonderfully simple to prepare. A must for my recipe box.

Excellent. The toasted coriander seeds add an amazing fragrance and crunch. Use freshly purchased and toast them no more than two hours before serving for maximum flavor. I prefer to use a little less dressing, just until the leaves are very lightly coated after tossing. Then add the the coriander seeds. One of my favorite salads.

I agree that this recipe is boring and in need of help. The dressing is pretty ascidic, so I'm thinking honey might improve that. To perk up the greens, perhaps some orange or grapefruit slices.

Needs fresh shaved Parmesan....IMO

It was alright. Something seems to be missing but can't tell what spice should go in it.
