Tips: salt the potato water. Use uniform size potatoes so it's easier to know when they're cooked - and watch them closely. Tarragon is another idea. This is French-style potato salad and is meant to be simple. Definitely use sea salt and extra virgin olive oil. Let it sit awhile to develop flavors and serve room temperature. It's great on a hot day with grilled marinated meat.

This recipe is definitely better with baby potatoes; I used small Yukon Gold potatoes, but they were still hard to gauge when the potatoes were cooked. I think I overcooked a few of them as they squished as I tried to cut them up. Otherwise, recipe made as is - very tasty! I agree with the reviewer who said to use a high quality extra-virgin olive oil for added flavor. Not sure what everyone's talking about re: a "lot of salt" needed. The amount of salt I added was several heavy-duty pinches, and that seemed to do the trick.

This is smashingly good when served with a very spicy main course. Its simplicity made it the perfect foil to the Island Pork Salad found on this site. On it's own, adding your favorite herb would improve it.

Good alternative to mayo-based salads. As discussed, a lot of salt is necessary. Make sure not to overcook potatoes - my first batch was a little on the mushy side.

I think the key here is to add a vinagrette to the potatoes rather than just olive oil. we used about a pound of baby reds with a 1/4 cup of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar(adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt and the shallots)which seemed to work pretty well. Overall, a pretty solid potatoe recipe that we would make again.

I served this with roast chicken and it was a nice alternative to roasted potatoes as it could be made ahead and just left out until served. It does require quite a bit of salt but most potatoes do so this should be that big of a surprise.

As other reviewers have said, it takes a large quantity of salt to bring up any flavor. I tried a bit of white wine vinegar but that didn't help. With salt the salad is good, but not worth the sodium.

Boring. But, I had also made ARTICHOKE HEART, FENNEL, AND PARMESAN SALAD. We mixed them together with a little more dressing and it was fabulous!

Boring. Fortunately, I had also made ARTICHOKE HEART, FENNEL, AND PARMESAN SALAD, and the two, with more of the dressing from the other, mixed together beautifully!

This was a great alternative to typical potato salad. Lovely fresh taste to it. Wouldn't change anything.

This is a great potato salad recipe for entertaining. Some of my guests don't like mayo, some don't like mustard. But EVERYONE ate this salad. It is easy and quick to make and preparing it ahead gives the herbs a chance to release their flavors. It's also pretty healthy, except for all that salt.

Wow,something this good,and so easy to make. I enjoy it at room temp or from the fridge. The only thing I added to the recipe was a little wine vinegar. Good eating any time of year.

I made the recipe as stated and it came out great. I used new potatoes and using a really good quality olive oil makes all the difference. We found it did need quite a bit of salt for seasoning to really bring out the herb flavors. We originally served this at room temp., but upon eating the leftovers from the fridge, decided we liked it better cold rather than room temp.

Very simple and good, especially if you are like me and have never cared for mayo.

Very good, I cut down on the oil and added a little white vinegar. I mixed the oil, vinegar, herbs, shallots and salt first and then added to the potatoes.

This has become the standard for potato salad in our house. It's a great starch side that will get you through the whole summer. A wonderful alternative to potato salad with mayonnaise.

This dish was delicious, pretty and easy to prepare. The fresh flavor of this simple salad trumps that of versions requiring mayo. Wonderful.

I am a fan of mayo salads, and only tried this recipe because of the reviews. It was really good, flavourful and simple. I am making it again for a party.

I'm not a fan of mayo, so this delicious potato salad is a big treat for me...in fact, I've brought it to every barbecue I've attended this summer and I've been asked for the recipe every time.

Who needs mayo anyway? This is delicious!

Delicious and light--super easy, too. For more flavor, I added about double the shallot this dish calls for.

Great recipe for summertime get togethers where keeping salads cold may be a problem. This is a great alternative to the old standby.

This was a wonderful twist on the generic potato salad that is made with mayo - which I hate. It was clean and light and very refreshing - my husband loved it as well did I.
