This was absolutely wonderful. The sauce was rich and delicious. I will definitely make this again. I used lindt chili dark chocolate, and thought this was great!

I was excited to make this recipe but was sadly disappointed. The stuffing mixture was ok (a bit plain for my liking but still nice), but the sauce ruined the dish for me. I found it too sweet, and the "chocolate-y" taste did not go well with the cheesy peppers at all. The vegetable mixture was nice but a bit bland. I think that if the sauce were left out and the veges perked up, it would be a very nice recipe.

I was looking for a stuffed poblano recipe since I needed to harvest mine. This looked interesting. When I was making it, I really wasn't sure. Well, it was FABULOUS!!! I still don't see where the 4 ounces of red wine come in, but would guess it should be added into the sauce, since I had to add some water to thin it down. I also would suggest roasting the peppers first on the grill or in a high oven to enhance the smoky flavor. I did. This is a definite do-over!
