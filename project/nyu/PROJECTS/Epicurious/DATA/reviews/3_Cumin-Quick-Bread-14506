My family loved this bread. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also went easy on the ground cumin and didn't put in the seeds at all because I didn't have any. My kids loved it. Next time I'll put in the full ground cumin amount or try other spices. My husband suggested olives next time.

I really enjoyed making and now, eating, this bread. I found the recipe very accessible for a novice baker (which I am). I read the reviews and subbed apple sauce for the oil and omitted the crushed cumin seed because I didn't have it. The bread came out moist, flavorful and is more versatile than I thought it would be. So far I've used it as sandwich bread, croutons for soup and have had a slice with some agave nectar as a snack. All good. I'm looking forward to using this recipe as a blank canvass to experiment with other spices/flavors as others did.

Delicious recipe. Subbed half of the veg oil with applesauce and used 1 c whole wheat flour and 2 c all purpose flour. Bread was still moist and light. Cumin flavor is mild and is a perfect accompaniment with chili.

The bread was OK. Good flavor (I subbed good olive oil for veggie oil); nice, moist, slightly eggy texture... But when it came out and cooled, the top was coming off and it was near impossible to cut. Is it the 2 TBSP baking powder? Would be a really good recipe if honed a bit.

As a bread lover, this bread in my opinion was way too dense and did nothing for the incredible chicken salad. I suggest serving the salad with shredded cabbage, or serve with plain wheat bread instead of bothering with this recipe.

This bread perfectly complements the thai-style chicken salad, as previous reviewers have noted. For those made nervous by past comments suggesting it may be overpoweringly cumin-flavored, I suggest substituting 2 tablespoons of whole-grain mustard for both the dry mustard and cumin seeds: it provides similar texture without the added cumin punch. Additionally, using only single-acting baking powder appears to have no effect on its rise or quality. This bread freezes very, very well and makes absolutely transcendent stuffing, substituted into any standard cornbread stuffing recipe for cornbread. It's a great way to deal with the leftovers, if you're not serving the chicken salad to a party of 50.

Very easy and quite good. It complements the Thai-Style Chicken Salad very well. I will definitely make this again!

Very quick and easy, tasty and moist. Made it for a cooking club dinner, and everyone loved it. I've had requests for the recipe. Made it again two days later for a family dinner, and again everyone loved it. Made a few modifications: added 1 cup pumpkin puree. Used cumin powder rather than whole seeds. Recipe calls for 1.5 cups of milk, but I used 3/4 cup evaporated milk and 3/4 cup milk instead.

Wonderfully easy quick bread recipe. Went really well with the Black Bean and Chorizo soup.

This recipe is versatile, quick and tasty. I've used it a half dozen times for company or taking to someone's house. I substitute rosemary, black pepper, and olive oil for the corresponding spices & oil called for the the recipe. With olive oil for dipping, this always gets rave reviews. My husband says it's even better the next day (although I'm not sure if I agree). I bake it in a round cake pan and slice into wedges. Yum.

I didn't have crushed cumin seed, so it was just the powder and I think that was just right. a delicious full flavor, best straight out of the oven :)

We found this recipe to be a very good, high-rising quick bread, with a mild cumin flavor. I do not understand the other reviews that say the flavor is overwhelming, and that the amount of baking powder is wrong. This recipe works for us every time, and is excellent with a hearty vegetable stew or chili.

The cumin in this recipe is great and really complements the chicken salad. Definitely a keeper when you want something quick and don't want to run to the store for a loaf!

I followed the recipe exactly and it wasn't too cumin-y for me. The only thing that ruined this moist bread is the flavor of too much baking powder. Where is Shirley Corriher when you need her? I'm not an expert but 2 Tbsps is too much.

I thought this bread was quite tasty. As suggested, I made it with the Asian Chicken Salad (which is awesome) and like others, I omitted the cumin seeds. But the bread was great. We toasted the leftovers for morning toast with butter. Yum!

Heeding previous reviewers' advice, I omitted the crushed cumin seed and the taste was just right. I also knew, intuitively, that there was no way this batter was not going to overflow in any loaf pan I owned, so I baked it in a 9-inch springform pan. Very good with the chicken salad.

Made this recipe with great anticipation to go with the Asian Chicken Salad (? think that's the name), as suggested..... it was AWFUL!!! Folowed recipe to the letter; have been baking for 25 years. Smelled divine when it came out of the oven, and normally we like seasnings like cumin, but this was a FIASCO. Cumin flavor was simply overwhelming.(Thank heavens for rescue flatbreads in freezer last minute!) Sorry, I don't think anything can rescue this recipe.

As the name implies, this is a simple-to-make quick bread. Although I had some initial doubts, the cumin gave the bread an interesting, but light, flavor. It was also a moist bread. This is a nice addition to my list of quick breads. I will make it again. (My 3-year-old daughter loved helping me make it and then enjoyed eating it also!)
