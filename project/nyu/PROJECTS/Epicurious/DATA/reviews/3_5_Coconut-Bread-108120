This recipe is great! I followed recommendations from other reviews and added 1 cup buttermilk along with 1 cup yogurt. Instead of white sugar I added 1 cup of sucanat, which gave it a darker color and complimented the flavor of the coconut. The bread had a nice heavy, moist texture and tastes like caramel toasted coconut! Definitely making again.

After reading some of the other reviews, I made this using a cup of unsweetened coconut milk instead of water. Yum!

My whole family liked this bread. Just a touch sweet with a light coconut flavor. Due to earlier reviews regarding the consistency I made the following changes: I only had all-purpose flour instead of self-rising as the recipe calls for so I added 1 tsp of baking powder. Also, I used 1/2 cup of my vanilla creamer I use for coffee and 1/2 cup of milk. I added the milk mixture to the egg/butter/sugar mixture instead of adding it to the dry ingredients as called for. I then slowly added the dry to the wet. The bread came out with a great texture. Not to dry/crumbly and not to wet. I did, however, have to cook it 10 additional minutes and I did wait the complete 2 hours cooling time as suggested in the directions.

I have made this bread both ways; according to the recipe and using buttermilk in place of the water. It doesn't make a lot of difference--either way, it is a crumbly bread that slices a lot better the next day. Goes great with the island pork tenderloin.

I made five loaves so I had an opportunity to try it a few different ways. I added more and less coconut. Milk and Butter in place of 1/2 of the water. In the end, I think the original recipe was the best. It was in deed crumbly but still tasted moist. I would recommend chopping the untoasted coconut. Either way, the flavor was fantastic!

Many of the reviews I read before making this bread commented on a dry product. I took the challenge and made the bread anyway. The first discrepancy I encountered was that 4 cups of sweetened coconut weighed 14.8 ounces and not 10 ounces which will yield a drier bread. I decided to follow the recipe and used 4 cups coconut but had to add 1 cup buttermilk to the batter. Instead of one large loaf, I made four mini loaves; then stored loaves in a sealed container overnight. I found the bread dry so sliced the remaining loaves in thin slices and made biscotti which had a nice toasted coconut flavour. I will make this again but as a biscotti.

Excellent, be careful when toasting the coconut, keep checking it, because it burns easily. Try a piece in a toaster, it's great.

I watched my toasting coconut like a hawk and toasted all 4 cups. I also added milk instead of water and 3/4 cup of yoghurt. Instead of making bread, I poured the mix into muffin trays -- the result was amazing -- not crumbly at all, just divine!

After reading all the reviews about crumbliness and people's success with buttermilk added, I made the recipe exactly as it is written but added 3/4 cup of whole plain yogurt (not the lowfat kind) and the bread turned out SCRUMPTIOUS. I did have to bake it longer, though, as it was denser with the added yogurt--figure on approx 20 mins longer than specified in the recipe, but check it often.

Absolutely delicious! Served with Caribbean Chicken Breasts and Mango Salad (both recipes available at this site.) Served to my book club, with enthusiastic reviews. Made the day before, wrapped in plastic wrap, refrigerated overnight, then brought to room temperature the next day. Served with a whipped honey butter. Prepared exactly as recipe specified. Big hit with the book clubbers!

Wow! This is good. Using the one-bowl method, I added 1 cup of coconut (not toasted) and enough buttermilk to form a soft batter. I baked it at 400 for about 25 minutes. My guests loved it and wanted the recipe. The texture was perfect.

Followed the recipe exactly--when bread cooled I wrapped it in clear wrap, refrigerated it and serve it next day after bringing it to room temperature. NO crumbs at all--everyone loved it --served it with the caribbean pork tenderloin--lovely presentation

Made the recipe exactly. Had to laugh at the instruction to "whisk" 1 cup of water with 2 cups flour. Of course it took a spoon. After all ingredients were combined, it just was not mixing well with spoon, so I kneaded it by hand till it was mixed thru. Sliced it right after cooling with a very thin serrated knife. Everyone loved it--and crumb was not a problem. I think the hand kneading helped.

This was really gross. I thought it tasted like it was from a box, a box that had been laying around the pantry for a few years.

I read all the reviews first to know that the bread was crumbly - and infact it was, so I'm thinking maybe extra egg-whites will bind it better next time. I made the recipe work-for-word and aside from being difficult to cut, it was fabulous. Not sweet, lots of good flavor. A "keeer" my husband says.

Easy recipe with great results. After reading all the comments about how dry and crumbly this was, I added a cup of buttermilk in addition to the cup of water when putting the batter together. Baked it to a golden brown on top, and then wrapped it in plastic wrap before it was totally cool to retain just a bit of moisture. I left it to sit for a day, and it was absolutely perfect. I also reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, and it was okay, but I think I'll use the full 1/2 cup next time as it could have been a little sweeter.

A decent, simple, sweet bread. Probably won't make it again since it was a bit too crumby for my taste.

I loved this bread, although I made it less sweet by using 3 cups of unsweetened coconut and 1 cup of sweetened. I also substituted milk for water. I also mistakenly ground all 4 cups of the coconut - but I'm glad I did. One of my dinner guests said it tasted like a rich buttery shortbread and I agreed - I think bigger pieces of coconut might have been distracting. Another guest said she can't stand the taste of coconut but she really liked this. I baked it for an hour, then let it cool on the counter for about 2 hours, then in the fridge for another 2 hours. It sliced up beautifully. A wonderful addition to the Island Pork Tenderloin Salad, but it's going to taste great as a snack, too. Yum!

I probably would not make this again as an addition to the Island pork tenderloin. I thought it was way too sweet for it. On it's own it is okay but I thought it was very heavy too!

Used buttermilk as the liquid, but did everything else to the recipe. Refrigerated overnight and brought it to room temp. to serve. It cut very well. Kept it at room temp another day and it was fine. It was not crumbly when I cut it and everyone thought it was very good.

This is a lovely tea-type bread, and serves the same role in a meal that cornbread does. It has a lovely flavor, and I think it was best TWO DAYS after making it. For ease in slicing next time I make it, I'd add an egg to the batter, a little more butter, and maybe use milk instead of water in the end, just before mixing everything together. Mine took longer to bake than the recipe said. Makes a BIG loaf, too. Great with the Island Pork Tenderloin Salad!

I made this a second time using coconut milk (full fat, not lite) instead of water. All other ingredients/measurements I left the same. It STILL turned out crumbly the next day. I refrigerated it overnight as someone suggested. It sliced nicely the next day. I sliced it cold, placed on a platter and then let it sit at room temp for several hours. It was great with the pork tenderloin salad and held together pretty well for my dinner party. Even though it gets crumbly quick, it is awesome with coffee for breakfast, but I know the calorie count is pretty high. If I made again, I'd probably use 2% milk like I did the first time I made it. The coconut milk did not seen to change the flavor that much.

I made this dish using unsweetened coconut, a bit of extra sugar, and half coconut milk / half whole milk. Ehhhh... It has a nice flavor, and a nice dense consistency, but like everyone said, it's too crumbly. Actually got more crumbly after 24 hours. It's similar in texture and feel to a (sweet) cornbread... but for the very high calorie count (one stick butter in one loaf! four cups coconut!) your calories are better spent elsewhere.

Made this to go with the lucious pork tenderloin salad. I added 3 tablespoons more butter, 2 additional tablespoons of sugar and coconut milk for the water - it was delicious with the salad because it complimented all the great flavors of the salad. If I were making this bread to be served without the salad, I would add dried cranberries or some other tart incredient to offset the sweet of the coconut and chopped toasted pecans. It sliced beautifully after being chilled for 8 hours. Would definitely make again.

I've made this recipe twice so far, once about a month ago and then again yesterday. I don't know why because I don't think I did anything differently, but the first time the bread seemed like real bread, soft but firm, and this time it came out kind of mushy. In fact, some of it stuck to the tinfoil when we unwrapped it. My boyfriend's parents ate it anyway (and recommended that it be served with pineapple chunks) but I'm not sure which way was correct. It's still very good though, and both versions vanished quickly.

Hey if it's so crumbly, why not try making it in mini muffin pans instead of a bread pan?

Didn't love this on its own, but might try again with the Pork Salad that everyone recommends or toasted with ice cream as one reviewer described. I found it dry tasting but not crumbly (although it was much moister and better tasting after refrigeration) so if I make it again, I'll try some of the suggestions (coconut milk, crushed pineapple - and if I go down that road, maybe chopped macadamia nuts??). As many have noted, 20-25 minutes at a true 350 degrees is too much. I followed the coconut package directions for 10-12 minutes.

This bread was really good. I made it to go with a chicken papaya green salad that was served at a luau themed luncheon. I made one substitution which was to add 3/4 cup coconut milk and 1/4 cup water instead of the full cup of water. I also baked it for less time--about 55 minutes.

Rating: 3
I really liked this bread, it was all gone in a matter of minutes. However, it was very crumbly. I even used the buttermilk as someone else suggested. But I think the reason for that was I did not have time to let it cool completely. Next time I will try wraping it like the recipe suggested.

Rating: 3
I also found this bread to be a bit crumbly to slice. I'll try using milk next time. Also I added a cup of crushed pineapple (drained) which was really good, next time I'll increase it to 1 1/2 cups of pineapple and 1 banana for a really tropical taste.

We really enjoyed the refreshingly different taste this bread added to our pork tenderloin meal. The bread was crumbly but after another attempt I substituted buttermilk for the water. I also added about 1/4 cup more buttermilk just for safety sake. It turned out great - not crumbly at all and the flavor was not affected. Hope that you enjoy it, too.!

We enjoyed this very much. After reading the previous reviews, I substituted 2% milk for the water and baked it a few minutes less. I baked the night before serving and wrapped in plastic wrap. Maybe it was the humidity in the house after 5 straight days of rain, but it wasn't too crumbly to slice.

To the cook in AL: I am going to bake this and noticed your comment about it not holding together. I would try adjusting the baking time a bit. Sounds like it might have been a little dried out? Just a guess. Also, I noticed the recipe suggested wrapping in plastic wrap and waiting a day before slicing. I think this could help it hold together better as well. Wish me luck!

I loved the flavor of this bread -- a non-cooking guest told me she'd pay me $20 for a loaf of it! But it was SO crumbly. Any of you big-time bakers out there have any suggestions for getting it to hold together better? Less coconut? (I'm afraid that would hurt the flavor.) More egg? I will definitely be making it again but would really prefer it if I could keep it in one piece as I lifted it to my mouth!

I made this bread to go with the Island Pork Tenderloin Salad. First of all, after processing coconut, I had 2 1/4 cups left so I only added 1 1/4 cups to the mix. I used sweetened coconut and cut back the sugar to 1/3 cup.It only took 1 hour to bake and I used a slightly smaller loaf pan. I wouldn't make just to eat it on it's own but it is EXCELLENT with the Island Pork Salad. A must!

I madde this with unsweetened coconut and it was sweet enough - I think sweetened coconut would have made it cloyingly so. Also, I made this on a Saturday morning, wrapped it, and let it sit for a day as the recipe indicates. It was quite good by Sunday evening, though still a bit crumbly. By Monday, however, my husband polished it all off and said it was much less crumbly.

This was very tasty , but too crumbly for the toaster. Maybe leftovers could be toasted in the oven instead. To the cook that asked about cake flour and self-rising flour, they are not the same. Self-rising flour has leavening already added for convenience. Cake flour(or pastry flour) is softer and lighter, yielding a lighter cake. Do not substitute cake flour for self-rising. Make your own self-rising by adding 1 1/2t baking powder and 1/2 t salt to 1 cup of all-purpose flour.

I made this with the pork tenderloin salad...its really good. Thanks for all the tips about watching the coconut...I didn't grind my coconut and used all purpose flour with the baking powder/salt as suggested below. The kids have warmed the leftovers and buttered them up...delicious! I'm not convinced it was a great match for the salad, but I would absolutely make it again!

The bread is not wonderful on it own--it's too simple and mildly flavored. But--with the pork tenderloin salad it is perfect. An excellent combination of flavors. I did not have any trouble toasting the coconut. Used parchement paper in my pan and stirred often--it browned perfectly. I thought I had to dirty a lot of pans and utensils for a quick bread--my only complaint.

An addendum: check out the coconut bread pudding with apricots, I used the remainder of this for a variation of that (see my comments there). As previously stated, this isn't really great on it's own, but it was a great use for the leftovers. (Original review from 5/20 follows):Perhaps this would be more accurately rated a 2.5, but..... I thought it was easy, and had no problems with the toasting of the coconut (just watch and stir frequently). By itself it seems too dry and crumbly, but when paired with the island pork salad, it became heavenly! What a perfect counterpart to a fabulous salad. I do look forward to toasting the remainder of the bread for breakfast tomorrow, if it holds together! (And yes, I did make the bread a day in advance). Anyone out there with suggestions on making it moister? I thought about substituting something for the water that has a higher fat content (what about milk, or yogurt?)

Good, but not great. I think it would be better with the pork salad. By itself, it was only average...

First-a warning. The directions for toasting the coconut could result in charcoal. Do not take your eyes off it. This is wonderful-flavorful-moist and not as sweet as many other quick breads. For the self-rising flour- I used a substitution from Nick Malgieri's How to Bake: 1 cup cake flour, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

Really tasty! I think that next time, I will toast all the coconut, and grind it all too. I definately didnt have to toast the coconut for anywhere near 20 minutes! (But I did it on a metal jellyroll pan, so that could be the diff.) I think it only took 7-8 minutes on 350. The friends adored this, and ate it as a mid-day snack. I didnt use self-rising flour, but added 1.5 tsp baking powder and .5 tsp salt, as another reviewer suggested. Very good if you like coconut.

Leftovers? No way. We ate it all and I used the crumbles as croutons. Next time I will double the recipe.

To the cook who was wondering if there was a difference between self-rising flour and cake flour: They are not the same. That's why the recipe says specifically not to use cake flour. Haven't made this recipe yet, but I am going to for my grandmother, who counts coconut as one of her favorite things. Can't wait!

Very good with the Island Pork Tenderloin Salad...but there must be a mistake in the recipe - 6 minutes at 350 degrees and the coconut was borderline burnt. Should it be 250? It turned out fine, though - thankfuly, as I was making a double recipe, and that was 6 cups of coconut in the oven! I used unsweetened, and just increased the sugar a little.

The coconut will burn at the edges on the pan if you don't watch it diligently. I made this bread as part of our Easter dinner party side dishes and it did go over well but would be better served for afternoon tea (as suggested) because it turned out a bit dry. However, the flavor and textures are fabulous, would definitely make again.

I haven't finished the recipe because the coconut burned to a crisp after 10 minutes. The recipe calls for you to toast the coconut for 20 to 25 minutes (in the preheated 350 degree oven, I assumed.) If I had been thinking, I probably would have figured out that 20 to 25 minutes at 350 wasn't right. Doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the rest of the recipe--but I'm going ahead with it, based on others' reviews. This time I'm NOT going to toast the coconut!

Made this recipe as 6 jumbo muffins (baked at 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes). They are some of the best muffins I've ever made (and I make tons of muffins). Nice dense, chewy consistency (not cakey) and luscious coconut flavor. Perfect with good orange marmalade.
