It's always amazing to see how different cooks can come to such different results with one same recipe: too thick, too thin, too bland, etc. I thought it was just delicious, wholesome and fresh-tasting. Used home-made chicken broth which might have made a difference. Skipped the celery (didn't have any)and sautéed the veggies in olive oil rather than stewing them in wine. Used Swiss chard instead of spinach and oriental rice noodles instead of pasta. I also followed the suggestions of romidax from the West Coast with cayenne, garlic and 4 diced Italian tomatoes. Maybe not authentically Italian (with the rice noodles) but definitely a keeper.

This recipe is wonderful, with a few tweaks: I added about 4 cloves of chopped garlic and about 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. I added a 28oz can of diced tomatoes (and removed 3 cups of chicken soup). Also, I removed the zucchini and added plenty of salt and pepper. It's fabulous with these changes!

This is a dish I make often for its health component - lots of veggies and very few calories. I love it. I do cut out some of the water though and add a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead. I think this makes a big difference. Also add a ton of marjoram and extra basil (just keep going to your own personal tastes). It also helps to add a good dose of pepper. I don't bother adding the pasta to it. It makes a huge pot, so I immediately put it in several plastic (glad brand type) containers and freeze for convenient workplace lunches. Hope you enjoy!

Man, was this bland - and I like to eat baby food! I had to add a can of whole peeled tomatoes and a lot of pesto to get it near edible. Which of course, made it a different recipe entirely!

This soup is good, like the others, I to added more broth. It's a great soup for dieters!!

I found this soup disappointing. The basil and the parmesan cheese saved it from total blandness -- and I added a lot more basil than called for. Also, I agree with the previous reviewers that it would be best to cook the pasta separately and even then I would add more broth -- there was almost no broth left by the time it was served.

Easy to make, low calory, tasty! One of our winter favourites

I've made this soup several times now only I make a few adjustments. I add at least 3 more cups of broth because the pasta does soak up a lot of soup so you end up with stew instead of minestrone. I also add some corn which not only tastes great but looks good too. My whole family loves this even my 2 1/2 year old because of the pasta and my 9 month old cant seem to get enough.

i think it needs some turnips and also thickening with some tomato paste also i would add some rice in the last 15 minutes of cooking really make a meal of this soup the way minestrone should be

This one filled our dutch oven all the way to the top. Just for taste, because we like chicken a whole lot and it calls for chicken stock, we added chicken the second time around, fat free of course. My 21 year old son liked it so much, he ate all of our leftovers we had saved for the next night, the original recipe that is. We have also added stewed tomatoes. So for those who like fat free meat dishes,or is on a restricted diet this one is easy to make and mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmso delicious. We add no salt or pepper. This recipe is good for those with heart related diet problems. It's great.

I found this soup to be very bland. I ended up adding tons of salt, some marjoram, and finally threw in some homemade pesto for body. A little fresh parmesan on top and we were there!

Very tasty. I think the previous reviewer might be on to something, cooking the pasta separately and adding it when you serve. It tends to soak up all the liquid. I'll try that next time.
