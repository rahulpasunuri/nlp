This recipe intrigued me and it did not disappoint. It was awesome. Great combination of flavors. The only this I changed was used red wine vinegar and Red tomoatoes. Excellent recipe

Excellent for dinner parties. Can be made an hour and half prior to serving. I placed them in Chinese soup spoons and served it as a palette cleanser for my 6 course tasting dinner. I also 2x the amount of jalepeno and lessened the amount of cumin to 3/4 tsp because thought the cumin was a bit overwhelming

i riffed on this majorly: made a dressing of cumin, lime juice, olive oil and a few splashes of tapatio (and salt and pepper). added green tomatoes, honeydew, and one persian cucumber. topped with crumbled feta. yum!

This salad is fantastic! I will definitely be making this again and my family echoed the same. It is light, refreshing, quick and elegant!

This is awesome, but I had one major sub: my husband bought tomatillos instead of green tomatoes. They were delicious! This is a keeper.

I really liked this. A perfect summer dish - the combination of melon and tomato is totally unexpected, but they balance each other out very well. I upped the jalapeno factor here by about 5-fold, to add some extra kick.

I loved this. I made it every day for a few days; I was kind of obsessed with it. I didn't have green tomatoes and red ones looked prettier anyway.

This is a true summertime salad: cool and refreshing. The pepitas are a yummy textural addition (next time, I'll make extra for nibbling with drinks before the meal). I found the jalepenos did not add much to the recipe (perhaps I'll leave some seeds in next time for some heat). Otherwise, an excellent salad for hot weather.
