A great dipping sauce for scallion pancakes is 1/2 to 1 part sugar, 3 parts soy sauce, and 1 part rice vinegar. Sprinkle with chili pepper flakes if desired.

I made this as an appetizer tonight for friends on a spur of the moment dinner and it was scrumptious. I can never leave a recipe alone, which turn out good or bad, but this time when I added matchsticks of carrot and substituted tiny cubes of roasted pork for the shrimp, it worked out well. I look forward to planning better and trying it with shrimp. Does anyone have a great dipping sauce suggestion other than soy sauce?

Tasty, but a bit greasy

very comparable to what i've had in korean restaurants, and an easy way to use leftovers when you just have a little of everything left.

really awesome easy recipe. Great reheats. If your eggs are on a large side, you might need to add an extra quarter cup of flour to the batter. Altogether yum, will make it again.

I've made this recipe as is once and then like a half dozen variations (you can put practically anything in the batter). So easy and just really, really good. They are still just as good leftover and reheated. Making again tonight with veggies to go with a Thai roast chicken.

Delicious and easy. I followed the recipe - but this could easily adapt to other vegetables/seafood.

quick and delicious. i substituted sliced onion for the bell peppers. Incredibly how easy it is to make. I would always order it in Korean restaurants, but now can make it all the time.

Just yummy, and easier to make than you might think.
