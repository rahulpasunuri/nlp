I really liked this "stuffing," although I do agree somewhat with the other reviewer, that it is a bit different than traditional bread stuffings. It seems much healthier, and is full of complex flavors and textures. It re-heats very nicely and could be made ahead of time.

I would not call this a stuffing but closer to a side salad. The combination of wild rice, dried fruit and raw makes it oolorful, tasty, chewy and interesting as well as healthy. I am adding it to my Thankgiving menu as an alternative for those guests who would prefer to avoid the other bread stuffing I will be offering. The beauty of it this recipe is the prep can be done the day before and mixed very quickly..added bonus!
