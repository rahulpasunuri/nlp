This appetizer was the first to disappear at a party. I used boursin cheese instead of goat cheese. Easy to make.

This is the tastiest appetizer we made for a large buffet party and they disappeared very fast. Also, the amount of the sauce left over for other dishes was very good on almost any sandwich. Outstanding!

This is an excellent combination of ingredients. everything just melds together very well. I make this over and over for small gatherings and they fly off the plate. I always salt the roast beef a little too. Excellent.

Forgot to give this its well deserved four fork rating.

The picture looks nothing like what the recipe indicates. This was a wonderful little addition to a spread of finger foods I had at a party-very interesting mix of flavors, people really enjoyed it. It was substantial enough to satisfy those who were hungry, yet still slight enough for a party snack.

perfect & easy little sandwiches. Use the best ingredients you can find/afford. These are delicious and I make them for most of my cocktail parties. They always get gobbled up.

I make this appetizer over and over again. So easy, so tasty. I used a Boursin type cheese in place of the goat cheese. The garlic, herb and cheese mixture really compliments the roast beef and arugula. I've also made it with baby spinach. The arugula is slightly better because of its peppery flavor. Make this for your next app before dinner or for your next cocktail party. You will not be sorry.

This was easy to put together and an absolute favorite appetizer at a dinner party. Make sure to make it right before hand, however, as the roast beef dries out after it has sat out a while.

Great satisfying finger-food for a buffet. I used boursin cheese instead of goat cheese in this recipie as I was using goat cheese in another dish. Not many left on the platter!!

Made this for New Year's Eve party, was the first thing finished. As suggested, I used boursin cheese instead of goat cheese. Also used sliced open faced soft french rolls, easier to eat than crunchy crostini.

I made these for a cocktail party last night and they were gone in seconds. A little time consuming to assemble, but not complicated at all, attractive presentation. I would love to try this with a horseradish sauce instead of the goat cheese, but would probably have to adjust the relish.

This wasn't as good as I had hoped for. I think next time I will eliminate the beef and just use the vegetable topping. I also brushed the bread with garlic oil before toasting which added a nice touch.

I made these for my husband's office party and a family Christmas get together. Absolutely a hit! I used less thyme than called for. I will definitely make again.

I made this for a Holiday cocktail party, and not only were they delicious, they were quite elegant on the platter as well. I added a tsp of balsamic vinegar to the relish for a bit more flavor. Yummy and easy to prepare!

Easy, delicious and a really good flavor combination - I will definitely be making Sunday football sandwiches with goat cheese, roast beef, red roasted capsicums and olives from now on!

I made these for a cocktail party and they were a huge success.Thanks for the recommendation of using boursin since goat cheese can be hard to find. The relish adds so much too these you can't alter that part of the recipe without losing a lot of flavor.

Fabulous for a party, and easy to assemble. I used fresh thyme, not dried. These disappeared quickly at my Ladies Night party -- hungry ladies! I will make again and again and again.

I made this for my book club and everyone loved it! I also used basil instead of thyme as previously suggested, and even made several with no roast beef for the vegetarians in our group. I was very pleased with this recipe!

Very tasty. I added lots of salt and pepper to the beef and sprinkled the finished crostini with vinegar and oil. Looks good for a holiday presentation too.

I made this for a cocktail party and it was a big hit. I substituted sliced beef tenderloin for the roast beef and instead of dried thyme, I added fresh basil. This recipe is a definite keeper.
