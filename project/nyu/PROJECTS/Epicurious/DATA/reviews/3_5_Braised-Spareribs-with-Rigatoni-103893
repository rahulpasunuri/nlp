I've made this several times and my guests devour it! It is so simple to make and is very flavorful. I agree with other chefs' comments regarding skimming the fat. I don't touch the ingredients. Very good as is.

Thank you Epicurious and Lidia. I googled 'ribs: italian-style' and was rewarded with this luscious pairing. The only thing I had to run out for was Vermouth, my favored cooking white wine. I prefer oven braising over the cooktop and that made the browning and stewing fast and unattended. We enjoyed the Ribs and Rigatoni so much that I am making it for my sister and brother- in-law next week. Bravo!

I gave this 2 forks but think it a good base to tweak. First off I would make it a day ahead so I can refrigerate to skim off the fat as the recipe mentions. Just off the stove it was greasy. For the peppers I used mild jarred banana peppers, which I thought were okay, but could see how a hotter pepper may pick it up abit, but my wife doesn't like spicey food, so I will stick with them or another mild pepper. This was more stew like than sauce like, so I think I will try draining one of the cans of tomatoes of the juice before adding the tomatoes. I think this would work with rice to soak up some of the juice.

Was absolutely delicious and had a nice kick to it! My husband continued eating the sauce straight out of the pan, as I was cleaning up after dinner!

I make this dish several times each winter - - my husband absolutely loves it. It is very spicy and extremely flavorful. I am mystified as to how someone could consider this bland. You just have to read the ingredient list to know that it's anything but!

I didn't have all the ingredients for this recipe, so I improvised, which is what using recipes is all about! What I do want to say, is this is a FANTASTIC way to prepare pork ribs. They are tougher than baby back ribs, and braising them made them very tender, and delicious. I only cooked them an hour, as that was all the time I had (!) and while the meat didn't fall off the bone, it was certainly quite tender and moist. I froze what ribs I didn't use for this meal, and for the next time, I'll take the recipe to the store and buy the ingredients. update... well, I bought the ingredients, and made the dish. My family and I were v. disappointed. We found it to be quite bland. It was a lot of preparation for what it turned out to be. And, I ended throwing out the leftovers after a few days - I couldn't get anyone to eat it again. :-(

Lidia's pasta dishes are the BEST! I followed it to the T, but did use some beef ribs. Didn't like the beef ribs, and found the dish very strong and heady the first night cooked. So I cooled it, skimmed the fat and served it a second day. It was UNBELIEVABLE! I added about 1 tbs of brown sugar to take the edge off it (my wine probably wasn't the best), but it was out of this world, as are all her pasta creations. A dish that makes you overeat!

This was so good that we have now made this three times, with and without the cherry peppers. I substituted bell peppers when I didn't have cherry peppers in the pantry (cherry peppers are packed in vinegar, so I added a Tbsp of wine vinegar). I can't understand the mixed reviews - the sauce was wonderful and flavorful, the meat tender. I trimmed the ribs well, and the meat just fell off the bone. The leftovers are great. I saw Lidia make this on TV - and mine came out just like hers.

I really loved this both times I made it, but I actually like it made with meaty beef short ribs, which you often see used in this type of ragu with pasta. Also for additional flavor, while sauteeing the onions, etc., I like to add a couple of carrots and celery, diced, and saute them, too. Great!!

Hearty and delicious. Did not have cherry peppers, but used cayenne pepper and Emeril's Essence. Had one large slab of spareribs so I used only one 28oz can of tomato and also used Marsala wine. Awesome!

Excellent spicey dish. The meat just falls of the bone. I would increase the number of cherry tomatoes next time. I also added a touch of corn starch at the very end to thicken the sauce a bit.

This is a fantastic recipe; the only change I made was to add 1 more can of tomatoes the second time. To reviewers who thought it wasn't spicy enough: cherry peppers ARE hot! This recipe is extremely spicy! Also, the ribs are sauteed initially, not braised. Just brown them & remove. I loved this recipe so much I made it for my dtr. & son-in-law & they couldn't stop raving.

This is a keeper my family and friends love it I always have to double it because my husband loves it again the next day.

Prepared this on Sunday and then reheated it for Monday night. We thought it was delicious. I also used hot cherry peppers (a few more than the recipe called for) and a little extra onion and red pepper flakes. At one point the sauce seemed a little thin, so I added a small can of tomato paste. We both loved it and would definitely make it again.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I played around with it a bit though. I used 1/2 tin less tomatoes, more dried red peppers and more onions and garlic. I also seasoned my ribs beforehand, not just with salt and pepper. I used garlic, worcestershire sauce, a little dried parsley, chopped onion as well as the salt and pepper. The resulting dish was fabulous. Lovely thick sauce with good, spicy flavour. Hubby and kids loved it as well. Definitely a keeper.

What a great recipe. My family loves this dish. The flavors explode in your mouth.

I braised the ribs about 20 minutes. It took several batches so the braising process took about an hour. I used the sweet peppers, as that was all that was available. The dish was not spicy at all with just the crushed red pepper. I recommend going with the hot peppers. I used a tad over 4 lbs of meat and the left-overs lasted forever for a family of two! A little too long. Takes a lot of effort for the return, but overall a decent dish.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. The kids enjoyed the sauce, not the ribs. I used hot peppers as well and thought it came out great. I made the sauce and ribs on Sunday and chilled it as the recipe calls. Then on a work night, I skimmed off the fat, reheated it, cooked the pasta and served it with some garlic bread. My family loved a "home-cooked" meal on a weeknight!

The only thing I did differently to this recipe was to use "hot" peppers since they did not specify. This is definately a "make the day before" recipe - I thought the flavor should have been richer and also had to fork through a lot of bone & gristle even though I bought what I thought were quality pork ribs from a good butcher. The flavor just didn't stand out - although it is good comfort food. For the time spent I would have like more flavor. I can't say I would make this again.

The spareribs were excellent...the sauce...a little disappointing. It lacked something that I can not pin point.

Nice, but no blockbuster. I suggest braising the ribs an extra 30 m or so, especially if you're using the tougher ones (as I am, since the bubble burst). Make sure to use grated parm (reggiano, for our richer friends). And do *not* mix with the rigatoni et al. if you plan to save and reheat; I tried this for lunch a day later, and it was insipid (or was it my microwave?). But otherwise nice, and easy.

I've made this recipe 3X now and has always been meet with wonderful reviews. Tho it takes awhile, it's a great dish to make ahead, and then reheat the day of serving. The house smells like you've been cooking all day. As with many brasied dishes, this definately tastes better on day 2 or 3 after the flavors have had an opportunity to mellow. Serve with a good italian wine, ciabatta bread and salad! Well worth the time. Leftovers freeze well and still taste terrific!

Made this one during a big snowstorm. It was a deliciously satisfying meal after all that shoveling, but beware. . . it's VERY spicy.

The sauce for this dish is outstanding! I've also used beef back ribs when they were on sale and it is equally delicious. I also used hot cherry peppers (3 large ones). I've noticed in the other reviews that the people who have used hot peppers like the flavor of the dish more. I will make this for a casual get-together often!

I followed the recipe as specified and it was good but not great. I was really expecting the sweet cherry peppers to lend a more distinct flavor. I would suggest to use the whole bottle. Oregano would have probably improved the sauce also. The pork spareribs were a nice change. The meat was very tender. Might try to add green olives next time.

Excellent flavor. Didn't have cherry peppers and I substituted a dry red for the dry white wine.

Rating: 3
This was very good, and although it takes a while, it's easy to do. I used the sweet cherry peppers and could've used the entire jar (it would only be about three more peppers). I used dry thyme instead of fresh. It kind of reminded me of a pork cacciatore.

I thought the flavor was pretty average and uninspiring. There are better pasta sauces out there.

This was good. The cooking time was longer than 2 hrs. I probably cooked my 4hrs. Started on a Sunday,refr.it then finished cooking it down Monday.Meat falls off bone. My husband didn't care for the rigatoni. Mash potatoes would be awesome.

Although I have not yet tried this recipe, I see that the term "dry" wine still is unclear to some readers. As virtually all white wine sold in this country is "dry" (as opposed to sweet), almost any white wine will fill the bill. Unless money is not an issue, I would not use a $20 California chardonnay for cooking. In fact, not only will you be spending quite a bit of money for virtually no difference in taste, but many chardonnays are a bit too assertive for general use in cooking.

As a novice cook, I have a question. When a recipe calls for dry white wine, what should I buy? Any suggestions?

Yummmm Yummm, a great recipe for the cold months coming up. I dried some of my own tomatoes, and threw a few in here. The flavours were wonderful.

This is excellent. All of Lidia's recipes are so very good and easy to prepare. I bought the cookbook and I am working my way through it. Watch the show on PBS, it will inspire you.

Very good.SPICY. I a made 1/2 of recipe,but used extra garlic,onions,thyme and ribs(1.5lbspare & 1lbcountry.)used less cherry peppers(only 1) but it was still spicy. I think she means sweet. Took 4hours to thicken(maybe mashed tomatoes too much)and for ribs to cook- they were very meaty. I'll try next time w/different ribs and sweet peppers.

I made this following the recipe exactly, and it turned out very well but it was better the next day and best the day after that. Would definitely make for a crowd or a party.

This was a tasty, but very rich recipe. The instructions never said whether to use sweet or hot peppers. I used hot, but cut down on the amount. It was spicy, but not too hot. This is one recipe that should be refrigerated before reheating so that all the substantial amount of fat can be removed.

It is very tasty, great for cooking ahead. It probably would be great for a crowd. The next time I make this dish, I would definitely increase the amount of garlic and onion.
