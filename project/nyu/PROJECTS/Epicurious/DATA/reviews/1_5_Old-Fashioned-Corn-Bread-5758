I used 1 1/4 baking soda and I could still taste it. It's very dry. I'm afraid I still have to find a good, easy cornbread recipe.

The baking soda taste was dominant and made it quite drying.

I tried this recipe twice and both times it was bitter from the baking soda.

I put the dry ingredients in a air tight jar and took it camping. When we were ready to make the cornbread I just added the wet product and baked it in a dutch oven. It was very tasty!

It would be nice if the quantity of the various ingredients was listed.
