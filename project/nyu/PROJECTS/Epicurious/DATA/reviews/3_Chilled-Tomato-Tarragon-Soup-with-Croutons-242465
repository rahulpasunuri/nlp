We love this recipe and have served it at dinner parties as a first course quite a few times. The fresh tarragon and the quality of the tomatoes are key!

This recipe fell completely flat on its face. As already mentioned that the sieving is a pain--well, I followed the recipe exactly (and I've never had problems before) and got basically NOTHING. There was no soup. There was so little soup obtained from this recipe that my boyfriend and I had to end up ordering take-out because it ended up a lost cause. Putting everything in a blender is probably the only viable option for making this work out well, at least if you have a busy schedule and can't dedicate a huge amount of time to making what is supposed to be a simple recipe.

This soup is just fine, but the sieving process is a colossal pain in the neck. Srsly, don't do it! Seed the tomatoes before cooking, let them cool off once they're done, yank off the skins and throw the whole shebang in the blender. The result is not quite as suave, but requires less profanity and still tastes good.

This soup is great on a hot evening. The key is to use fabulous vine ripe tomatoes. The tarragon adds a great licorice-like flavor, but would also be good with the more traditional basil.
