It's almost unfair to review this recipe, because it ended being more of a base to which I added ingredients others recommended in reviews including chicken, carrot, broccoli, soy sauce and peas. I thought it needed something extra, so I tipped about a tablespoon of oyster sauce into the mix too. Quick and tasty meal!

Nice recipe. I added peas and cashews. I didn't have peanut oil, so I just used Canola oil, I think next time I'll try olive oil.

my chinese cookbook says to push the eggs back with a spatula while tilting the pan forward - a way to solve the egg not cooking properly problem:)

I also found it a little bland, and without much texture--I added broccoli, carrots, and some chicken to it, and sauteed garlic and a little grated ginger in with the peanut oil before adding the eggs. The sesame oil was a lifesaver; it really adds a nice depth to the flavor without overpowering everything else.

Simple, and fresh tasting fried rice. I make this whenever there is leftover basmati rice. I add cilanto and mushrooms to vary it a bit. I think the omission of soy sauce is great; other fried rice recipes taste muddy in comparison.

This is a very easy recipe! I add soy sauce at the end and sometimes baby peas or shredded rotisserie chicken. I just use a non stick frying pan with olive oil. Turns out great every time!

This is a very solid recipe, but it is a little bit bland. I recommend adding peas and diced carrots, as well as soy sauce and more sesame oil. I also added chicken, by dicing one boneless skinless chicken breast, coating the meat with sesame oil and soy sauce, and stir-frying it. I then set aside the chicken and added it along with the green onion later in the recipe.

Scallions are difficult to find in my stores, so I substituted chopped onion. I opted for 2 tsp sesame oil and found it to be way too much--next time will try 1 tsp. Otherwise, pretty good. Make sure the wok is HOT (and preferably seasoned)--the eggs pooled in the bottom of mine and took forever to cook completely.
