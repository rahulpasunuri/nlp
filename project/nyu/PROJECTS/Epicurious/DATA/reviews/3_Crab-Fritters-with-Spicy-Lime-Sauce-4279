The sauce was very interesting. I went easy on the nam pla as suggested and found that 3 T was perfect. The crab fritters were a challenge but two spatulas worked to gently flip them. I would probably make it again, but definitely will use the sauce on other fish.

Would not make this recipe again without major modifications. Way too much sauce for the amount of fritters and way, way, way too much fish sauce!!! Used a good quality nam pla and sauce was so salty it was virtually inedible. Prepared fritters exactly per recipe. When added to hot oil, fritters exploded into thousands of small pieces. Needs some kind of binder to hold fritters together.

Sorry to be the odd man out, but I will not be making this again. Followed the recipe, but got crab mush instead of fritters. Seemed the recipe was missing something to bind the crab mixture together. Dipping sauce was good.

I rarely give 4 forks to anything, but this truly is a dish beyond compare. All of the varying flavors come together in a unique explosion of culinary perfection. Do not leave out anything!! The only note I have - this is a presentation meal, so I would serve it as a first course rather than try to serve it as an appetizer. I was under the impression that I could make these finger food size, like crab cakes. This is definitely *not* finger food.

My second review... my second time making the recipe. This is awesome and so delicious tasting! The salty/sweet/spicy/ blend of the sauce is so good on the lightly crisp crabcakes. The first time I made it was as one of two recipes to use a pound of crabmeat. This one was definitely the better recipe, tonight it stands alone. And the last time, we used the leftover sauce as a marinade for a pork tenderloin the next day (marinated overnight, then smoked/grilled) and that was also very good. I am keeping this recipe in my brain for many future uses. I may never make regular crabcakes again! And I would recommend it HIGHLY to anyone.

They would have been great had I refrigerated them as long as you should have. Was in a hurry and they were not chilled enough and fell apart. Will make again.

Finger-lickin' good! Everybody I've ever made this *begged* for the recipe. It became a favorite among my friends.

Changed the recipe a bit;we like it hot,so I used habaneros instead of jalapenos, my husband won't eat anything with mayo so I just used an egg, it was fine, and instead of grapefruit I used mango and fresh jersey tomatoes as well as oranges and avocados, made the plate look nice. I doubled the recipe and made for an entree. Nice summer dish.

I served this for six last night and everyone absolutely loved it! Some of my guests called today and they were still talking about it! I thought the dish was going to be too spicy, but the jalepenos really mellow overnight and the dish is tangy, but not spicy. One important tip: I had to double the amount of crab to make decent sized appetizers.

Served this appetizer during a 5-course formal seafood dinner for 6. All guests were avid shellfish-eaters and cooks themselves, and all thoroughly enjoyed this dish. However, I did serve the sauce (strained) on the side, since not everyone likes hot peppers. With the exception of one person, everyone thought the sauce "made" the dish. An interesting combination of flavors...

Wonderfully different version of the more traditional crabcake.
