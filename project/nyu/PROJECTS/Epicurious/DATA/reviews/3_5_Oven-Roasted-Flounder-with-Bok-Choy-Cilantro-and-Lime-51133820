Delicious flavors and super fast to prepare. I substituted tilapia filets which worked out just fine - cooked at a slightly lower temperature. I went heavier on the ginger (a personal preference) and added red pepper seeds as another reader suggested. I served the fish with jasmine rice scented with a little bit of tumeric and a bottle of Torrontes. Yummy!

This was a great recipe. My first time with bok choy but will probaby do a better job the next time as this is certainly going to be part of my rotation. As my husband said, such an interesting mix of flavors. I made it pretty much as described and was fast, easy and a hit. We had the perfect amount of liquid but would definitely double the liquid for a making it for even one more person.

I thought this was nice. I subbed sole for flounder, which worked fine. I also halved the amount of fish but kept everything else the same, and the ratio of sauce to fish was good - there was plenty of cooking liquid and sauce to have enough flavor and moisture. I served with quinoa. Overall, would make again.

I am trying to include more fish (other than salmon)in our dinners, and was pleasantly surprised with this. I used frozen hake from TJ's to good success, although it took closer to 12 min to cook through(and the fillets were less than 1/2"), which did overcook the bok choy, so maybe next time, I'll cook the bok choy separately or even use a slightly thicker vegetable, like a zucchini. There was plenty of liquid in the bottom of the pan, more than I wanted, but DH likes soupy, so poured most of it on his portion. Served over brown rice. Loved the soy & lime sauce...think I might put some fish sauce in next time instead of all soy. Very good and simple!

Awful. The sauce was way too tangy. Added hoisin sauce and sesame oil to balance out the flavor. Even after searing and 10 minutes in the oven the bok choy was inedibly undercooked.

We thought this was delicious. Very simple and the flavors are very nice. A new weeknight dinner for us. I agree there was little to no "pan sauce" left at the end, but it didn't really matter. The cilantro-lime sauce is definitely tangy, so I suspect the several very negative reviews just really don't like that flavor profile. Don't let that faze you if these ingredients (including soy sauce and rice vinegar) sound appealing to you. Also, if you like this, you will very likely like the Coriander-Crusted Steak with Miso Butter Sauce on this same site-- similar flavors but with steak. YUM.

I loved this! It was so simple and easy to make. The bok choy turned out lovely, and the fish was delicious. The cilantro lime sauce was a bit like ponzu but better because of the added ginger and cilantro. So yummy over rice!

This looked so appetizing and I had a bok choy and sea bass out in a restaurant that I loved so I tried it. I agree with the reviewer that the sauce was vile and without it the food was bland.

I forgot to add four forks!

I love this recipe because it is very simple and quick to make on a weekday evening. The wine liquid and cilantro/lime sauce keep the fish from being so bland. I made all the cilantro sauce even though I halved the fish for a serving for two. I didn't have sake or white wine so I used sherry cooking wine. I thought it might all evaporate in the oven but it didn't and provided plenty of spoonsful to drizzle over the fish and bok choy. It all was very pretty in the pan and on the table, too. I boiled a couple red potatoes to serve with the dish; the sherry and cilantro sauce went perfectly with them, too. Very nice recipe.

Yummy and easy. I used Tilapia which is cheap and plentiful. The fish baked moist and flakey. I have made this per recipe and also with regular Soy Sauce and powdered ginger and it was still very tasty. This will be added to the dinner "rotation".

Super easy and very flavorful. This one is on the "keep" list. Used haddock and it worked great, also added some water chestnuts for crunch factor. I used a white wine (didn't have sake on hand). Next time around I'll cook some rice noodles for substance and serve this right over the noodles. All in all, quick, easy and scrumptious!

This is a very easy dish, good for busy week nights. I used cod, but tilapia or sole would substitute nicely as well. As for the recipe, the wine/sake doesn't add much to this, though it may help keep the fish from getting dry--but it does not result in any sort of sauce. The cilantro-lime sauce was fabulous, a perfect taste complement to the bok choy, and all the sauce this fish dish needs. If allowed, I would have given this 3-1/2 forks.

I thought it was quite tasty and very easy. Used Tilapia instead of Flounder. Added a pinch of sugar to balance the acidity of the vinaigrette. Threw in a a few handfuls of spinach after I sauteed the bok choy. True, not really any sake sauce, but the vinaigrette tied it all together. Served with a lovely brown rice pilaf. Would definitely make it again. Wonderful easy weeknight dinner.

In a word: vile. I am an accomplished home cook, and I followed this recipe exactly. There is no sake "sauce" -- there is nothing in the pan that cooks, besides the sake, and the cilantro lime sauce is so pungent, it's basically inedible. Yuck!
