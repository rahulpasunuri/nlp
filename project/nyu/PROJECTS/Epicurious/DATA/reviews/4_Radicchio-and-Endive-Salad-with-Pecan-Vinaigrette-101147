I've made this twice in less than a month (per requests from repeat guests). This is a beautiful, bold salad. The color threw some folks, but most gobbled it up once they had a taste. I added crumbled Gorgonzola per the other suggestions - definitely adds depth to the flavor and the sweetness off-sets the radicchio. It quadruples fine. I always use a food processesor to get a thicker consistency - whisking can result in oil/vinegar separation. I used a Cabernet Sav. vinegar. Flavors are too bold for the iceberg lovers of the world, but a fabulous salad nonetheless!

This salad is easy, with great crunchy texture. Walnuts may be used instead of the pecans if that is what you have on hand. I like to sautee a slice of bacon for the vinaigrette, and a good blue cheese such as Maytag or Point Reyes Blue crumbled on top adds depth.

I doubled the recipe and served it to company, who finished the entire salad. It is a little bit different, but a crowd-pleaser, I think. I was very happy with the results.

A cook from Phoenix 02/14/00. We loved this salad and dressing! I also added mandarin segments. A definite keeper!!

I have made this salad numerous times; not only is it beautiful it is also delicious. I've added orange or mandarin orange segments for variety. My friends ask for the recipe over and over again.
