Absolutely lemony and sweet and tart. Great flavor. I loved the final result, but I would not agree that this is an easy recipe for a beginner. Using a candy thermometer is not easy for a beginner, such as making sure its measuring the contents of the pot and not touching the bottom of the pot. It is also not a dessert that you can 'multi task' on since the lemon filling needs constant attention to make sure it doesn't overheat. Other than that - the end result is well worth the effort and time involved.

Excellent recipe, and have been making this for years. I am an experienced baker and this is a go to recipe. And it is very easy for a beginner. The lemon is a great foil for many meal enders and as a part of a dessert grouping. My one hint would be to keep an eye on the shortbread, and take it out before it browns. I also use a hand blender on the curd instead of straining. Fast, easy and no waste. If you love lemon, you won't be disappointed.

Not for the faint of tart!! These are for sure the ultimate lemon bars. This was the first time I ever made these cookies and included them in my holiday cookie exchange. I followed the recipe as stated. The shortbread when baked to a golden brown around the edges,was nice and tender to the touch. After adding the lemon curd and putting it into the oven for the final bake, what resulted was my most requested cookie recipe. I made them the night before serving. The lemon held together so nicely I was able to cut them into roughly 2in x 2in pieces without any of the cookie falling apart. I am going to make another batch to bring when I go and visit friends over the holiday. These cookies will make everyone pucker up and say "mmmmm""

I made these for a Halloween party last night and they were a huge hit. People raved--and it was a crowd with high standards! As other reviewers advised, I added a little salt to the shortbread and a little extra lemon zest. I strained the lemon curd, but it wasn't absolutely necessary.

made these for a BBQ today, and they were a big hit with all the adults. They were "just tart enough" according to the hostess. I made them in a 9x9 pan, using the crust recipe as written, but I made 1.5x the curd recipe, and was glad I did. Since the crust was thinner (since it was a larger pan), I only baked it for 25 minutes, but the curd needed about 12 minutes in my oven to seem like it was set. Like others, I did add a bit of salt to the crust, and I was glad I did. The only other "change" I made to the crust was to make sure that I beat the butter & sugar together for about 5 minutes (as per my Grandmother's shortbread recipe). The crust held together well. I didn't make any changes to the curd recipe, except to add a bit more lemon zest. Will be making these again.

I decided to make 2 batches and add more curd to each. Problem is I had no idea how long to bake it...took forever for them to "set"..I fear they both may be ruined..will test tomorrow after they have been refrigerated...curd was delicious..did not strain..but I did put the egg yolks through a strainer..

These are the most stunning lemon bars I've ever seen. The curd is a rich golden lemon color. It was tangy enough for my taste just following the recipe- and I've been craving acidity and putting lemon juice on EVERYTHING during this pregnancy. The shortbread base is perfectly crispy and holds together very well. I also skipped the straining step since there didn't seem to be many solids in the lemon curd. Absolutely delicious, as are all of Rose's recipes.

Rarely do I comment but I just had to for these! Everyone in my family is mad for lemon and we all agree these are the best lemon bars we have ever eaten! The directions we easy to follow and the only thing I did was add the zest of two lemons. I also skipped the straining step. They were incredible and will become a family favourite!

These were scrumptious. I appreciate all the tips and information on the side as well. I used a square glass pan so I baked at 300 for 40 minutes and it never got quite golden on the edges but it was done to perfection. I will make again and shorten the baking time because I like when the crust and topping form a sort of gooey middle layer :)

I made these for my sister's holiday party last year and she requested them again. I found the recipe to be simple and the bars very, very good. The shortbread crust was perfect and the curd the perfect blend of sweet and tart! I am drooling thinking about them and can't wait to bake tonight!

Really, I would give this 3 1/2 stars, because I had a little problem getting the bars out of the pan in one piece. Although that may be my own fault, because I quadrupled the recipe and put it in two 9x13 glass pans. The lemon curd is so perfect, I don't think I will ever use another recipe. Take note of the comment from Boston on 9/24/03--turn the heat up on the lemon curd, and watch and stir vigilantly. I made quadruple the recipe's amount and it only took around 12 minutes to get up to temp. Also, if you don't have an instant-read thermometer, get one. You can get a cheap bi-metal one for around $10 and it will be invaluable for custards, sugar syrups, and meat roasts. Even better, get a $20-$30 digital one. You won't regret the purchase. It's a lot easier to know when your curd is at 196 degrees when the dial tells you so than just by judging the viscosity, especially if you don't make lemon curd on a weekly basis.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe and I don't think it's that labor intensive at all. I do skip the straining of the curd step. I add a little more lemon for a little more tang and it doesn't affect the consistency of the curd at all. They don't need the sugar on top. Super delicious!

These were good but not fantastic, although that may just be that I'm not the hugest lemon bar fan. I would still make them again if I wanted lemon bars. A couple of comments: ~Straining is a waste of time. You've got lemon peel making lumps in the curd anyway, so why bother? ~This is one of the few lemon bar recipes where you can TASTE THE CURD before you bake it! So do it! I added more lemon juice to mine because I wanted it more tart. This is the perfect way to adapt the tart/sweet ratio, as that is such a personal taste issue and one recipe could never please them all. ~My shortbread was crumbly, but this wasn't a deal breaker. I may still look for an alternative shortbread recipe if I make it again. Curd was fantastic, though.

Rating: 4
I did not get my curd to 196 degrees, however, it still turned out gorgeous. And once I got home with all the ingredients, I remembered I didn't have a microplane amidst my arsenal. Peeling the lemons, then throwing the lemon peel pieces in a coffee grinder worked out perfectly. I will make these again and again!

Ultimate? Hardly. This recipe is simply not worth the time and expense involved to make it. I have successfully made shortbread and lemon curd in the past. I threw experience to the wind and followed this recipe exactly. The shortcake in not crunchy, but rather crumbly. The lemon curd is hardly silky, rather sticky. I had hoped for another Christmas cookie to add to my collection. Glad I was not depending on this recipe.

This is truly the ultimate lemon butter bar. For the past 35 years I've been making the recipe I got from the back of Minute Maid Frozen Lemon Juice. It's fabulous and quite similar to this one. However, having tried this for the first time I will not be using my old recipe any more, this is far superior. Thank you Rose for once again sharing your talents with the rest of the baking world!!

I ADORED this recipe - as did my entire family. It was the perfect amount of lemon flavor combined with a beautiful, thin layer of shortbread. When I first read some of the comments and reviews, I was worried that I would need to make alterations. However, I made a batch following the recipe and then just had to make a second batch because it was so good. The way I did it that might make a difference for those of you having issues with runny topping or whatnot is I used a pyrex dish. I did not attempt doubling of any sort. I hand mixed the batter (which was super fun!) and cooked the shortbrea for close to 40 minutes. That left me enough time to prepare the curd. I didn't exactly watch the clock when making this, I just kept stirring until it steamed and then stirred it for about 5 minutes after. It was mildly thick when I poured it onto the shortbread, so I cooked it for another 12-15 minutes instead of the recommended 10. When I took it out, it was just about firm everywhere except in the very middle, where it was the tiniest bit wiggly. However, after cooling for about 45 minutes, it had set perfectly. I stuck it in the fridge, brought it out 3 hours later and had no issue taking it out and cutting it up. I didn't bother with the sugar on top. Simply amazing! For lemon lovers everywhere - this is what you've been looking for.

I found the metric conversions spot on for Australia. I loved the taste & presentation. Shortbread was crisp. The curd came up with a chewy caramel like consistency & retained the tart lemon taste. Not sure if the chewy consistency is because I left the curd/shortbread in the oven for 20 minutes rather than 10 minutes. The curd was bubbling evenly when I removed it from the oven. Also the metric quantity worked well in a long rectangular pan 14 inches x 5 inches x 1 inch. My mother in law loved it & has asked for the recipe :-)))

I don't know what happened, but the shortbread base just completely crumbled. It was really weird. And I followed the directions exactly. That said, I really enjoyed the lemon curd topping. I made it once with fresh yuzu and it was AMAZING! I was dipping store bought shortbread into the curd. So I suppose I'll try this again with a yuzu curd topping and hope that it was some freak accident with the shortbread.

These lemon bars are the best! I have made this several times, always to rave reviews. I brought these to a bake sale at work and two of my co-workers literally stalked me afterwards- they called me everyday asking when I would make them again. The recipe as written doesn't make very much, so I usually double it. Actually, I double the shortbread and triple the lemon curd. The curd is definitely tart and very lemony, but I love it!

This the absolely the BEST lemon bar recipe I have ever made. They are to die for!! I do not think they were too tart and I do not think the curd needs to be doubled. I used the processor to make the shortbread and it was perfect. Will make them again next week `cause I had to take these to a friend`s BD party and I made a double batch for her and snuck 3 of them for hubby and I to try.

Rating: 4
I thought these were perfect! The thin layer of lemon curd was just right because it has such a strong lemon flavor. I thought the sweetness was just right (I like desserts on the less sweet side). Also, the crust stayed cruchy even after freezing and thawing--much better than the gooey crust of some lemon bars! I think these will be a staple at our coffee shop!

Rating: 3
Ha! I didn't follow the recipe to a "t," but I followed to about an "m!" I went by the recipe for the shortbread and used the processor method, using a larger pan (9x11?) and spread the shortbread mixture thinner. (When emptying the mixture into the plastic bag you must dump part of it into the sink. With what's left, or if you can retrieve some, pat into the pan.) Doubled the curd recipe and I added a 2T of cornstarch just for drill. Cooled both curd and shortbread and then baked them for ten minutes as directed. It is tart, but I like things that way -- Loved the bars!

I am a lover of lemon bars and always looking for the perfect one. Made this according to the recipe. The cookie base was good, but the lemon curd was a little disappointing-biting and just a little too tart. My hunch is, considering all of the reviews, it will be up to the individual as to whether this is OK or great. Again- not bad-but not great

I love lemons, and so I found this curd just lemony enough, but my boyfriend called it "too intense". It is very lemony. Also didn't sieve, found it wasn't necessary, and used half brown flour because I ran out of white which was nice actually.

Used limes in this recipe and the bars were amazing! I did not strain the curd (not necessary and messy) and it was perfect. Read the reviews about X2 curd but made a single layer and the thin layer of curd was just the right amount. You might spray the sides of the foil with non-stick spray. The shortbread is wonderful...add a dash of salt to bring out the buttery flavor. This recipe is a winner...great for cookie exchanges or holiday parties when lemons and limes are in season.

These are very good. I doubled the topping as suggested by other reviews, but wished I hadn't as it was much to sweet for me. Everyone else loved them though. The shortbread is delicious. I used salted butter with no problems. The lemon curd recipe would be great for various uses, including filling a cake .

I wasn't impressed with these lemon bars. The curd is absolutely delicious, tangy and not too sweet. The shortbread base was terrible, though, flavorless and not at all rich like a shortbread. I would consider making regular shortbread with the curd topping but would not make this version again.

I took the suggestion of the other reviewers and increased the quantity of lemon curd. However, the mixture is quite tart, so maybe the original quantity in the recipe would have been sufficient.

Amazing recipe. I think the lemon curd to shortbread ratio was perfect. So good that I ate half the pan by self. Mildly labor intensive even though I used the food processor to make the dough. Lemon curd took twice amount of time as stated in recipe to come together, but I wanted to make sure it didn't boil. A definite keeper!

Everyone loves this lemon bar when I make it and I get lots of requests to make it. However I agree the lemon curd is not enough. I always double the recipe of curd otherwise the proportion of shortbread and curd is imbalanced. If you like the curd more tart (like I do!), add more lemon zest. Candy thermometer is pretty important if you want to get the curd at the right consistency.

This is the first lemon bar recipe that I've ever tried. But I've baked quite a bit and I have many years experience in eating. : ) I agree with other reviewers in that the lemon curd was not enough. I would double the ingrediants for the curd. Also, I used salted butter and I could really tell - in not a good way. It was just too salty that way and I'm not one to complain about something being too salty. Otherwise it was delicious and fun to make. The lemon curd is so tasty, I think it would be nice to have some and put on scones.

At the request of my husband, I'm on the quest for the perfect lemon bar. This is not it. The shortbread, though thin, is lovely. The lemon curd - and that's what it is - is not a sufficient topping for a lemon bar. It's more like tasty lemon jam spread over a shortbread cookie. And the curd was a pain to make. It was tasty, but not "the ultimate," and is not like a "traditional" lemon bar.

To the reviewer below - I later tried this as a lime bar, using key limes for juice, and regular limes for zest, in the same quantities. This was even more popular than the lemon version, if you can believe it.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe. Although it can seem daunting to read this long, seemingly involved, recipe, it really wasn't hard to make. I followed the recipe exactly (used food processor method for base), and the results were perfect. Perfect buttery base, firm, tart/sweet, wonderful topping. I took this to work and got huge raves - not one single crumb was left. Requests for the recipe all day. These cut neatly and beautifully into squares and looked totally professional. I want to try this same recipe with lime or tangerine and see if it comes out as well. In any case, I will definitely keep this in my "wow" file for future use!

Just wanted to add one more thing after reading some of the reviews: The lemon zest is added AFTER you strain the curd!!! Please don't skip this step because the zest is crucial in achieving the perfect flavor! (Oh, and I spelled definitely wrong. Me and my damned obsessive complusiveness!)

These were delicious. The crust was perfect...buttery, easy to remove, and complimented the curd well. I ended up using a total of 3 lemons for both the zest and the juice, not to waste any. It was perfectly sweet and tart. I was afraid there might not be enough lemon curd, from the previous reviews, but it was a good amount. Next time I might increase it by 1.5 just for my taste but it isn't absolutely necessary. Excellent summer bars....will definetely make again!

WOW! I have been looking for a lemon bar recipe for years that balances the sweet and sour flavors well, and all I can say this is perfect! My shortbread cooked fast. I took the advice of one of the suggestions (from the chef) and turned the heat up while making the curd being extremely careful not to boil it and I was done right on time in 6 Min. I didn't have a candy thermometer so the hollandaise suggestion was a great measure of knowing when it was done. The recipe is a little complicated and I can tell from some of the previous comments people didn't follow the method properly and that's why it failed for them. I cooked about 2 tsp of zest in the curd and strained it, then added 2 more tsp of zest to bump up the lemon flavor.

Rating: 4
These bars are magnificent. Wonderfully tart, and the shortbread base compliments the lemon curd nicely. There are only 2 small changes I have made: 1. double the lemon curd recipe for a 1" curd top 2. Whisk yolks with sugar to "ribbon" stage before adding lemon juice, it makes a lighter texture and a little more volume.

Rating: 3
This will be my standard recipe. I did add one extra egg yolk to counter the fact that I made the lemon juice total 5 ounces. The cooking of the curd did take longer than the recipe says; use a wooden spoon, and when you can draw a line in the mixture on the back of the spoon, it is ready. As for the baking time, I read a hint on another recipe; bake the bars until the curd topping wobbles just the very slightest bit in the dead center. Too long and it will become grainy. I don't see the point of adding in grated zest for flavor when you're only going to strain it out a few minutes later anyway, so I used a scant 1/2 tsp (probably more like 1/3 tsp) of 100% pure lemon oil, available in gourmet stores or on line.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times and it always turns out perfect!! Absolutely delicious with a nicely flavoured shortbread crust and just the right proportion of lemon curd topping.

This lemon bar is great, as far as the taste, color of the topping, and the shortbread. I found that the topping was runny, as other reviewers have stated; once you remove it from the fridge, it will run. I wonder if I tried baking it longer than 10 minutes, if it will be a bit firmer, without altering the taste. The color is beautiful though. I will keep the shortbread recipe, and will experiment with other toppings. Others really liked it, I had to save a little for myself to take home!

This is truely the best lemon bar I have had. It was very easy too. I did the whole shortbread by hand no food processor necessary. The proportion of curd to shortbread is perfect.

What makes this recipe a four-fork for me is the lemon curd, which is truly delectable. The punch of lemon flavour with the buttery shortbread is lovely. I made the recipe exactly as written. It was my first time making shortbread completely by hand (worked butter in the sugar with a pastry blender until fluffy, then used my fingers to toss the flour with the mixture), as well as my first try at making lemon curd. I did have to cook the curd a longer period of time than six minutes, but it turned out beautifully. I had no problems getting the shortbread out of the pan at all, and I had no problems with crumbling when I cut the bars (I baked my shortbread 30 minutes). I will definitely make this again...

I already had a recipe for lemon bars that I'd used in the past, but when I saw the rave reviews on this one, I thought I'd try it. What a mistake. I followed the directions as precisely as if I'd been performing brain surgery. The darn thing looked beautiful, but then I tried to get it out of the pan and it was stuck like glue despite the foil and all. The crust fell to pieces and everything was a scrambled mess. If I could give zero forks I would.

I made this for a baby shower and everyone was raving about them and asking for the recipe. The taste of the shortbread was wonderful and the lemon was refreshingly tangy (my husband thought they were too intense and too sweet, but I've never been able to interest him in lemon bars anyway). By way of comparison, I made another Lemon Bars recipe from this site (Gourmet 1999) last year -- I liked the crust of the Ultimate Lemon Butter Bars better but the lemon topping from the Gourmet 1999 recipe, as it set up just a little firmer (the Ultimate Lemon Butter Bar topping tended to melt at room temp) and had a little more balance between sweet and tart--but that may have just been my lemons! Will definitely make this again but maybe play a little with the sugar-lemon balance.

Well this was my first time venturing from the basic cookies and brownies and cheesecakes etc, so I was a tad nervous. So nervous that I read the line saying do NOT use an aluminium pan and proceeded to take out my aluminium pan. It all went downhill from there, there were black bits in the curd (from using aluminium I suppose), and it started boiling. Had run out of lemons so I stuck to it, and still managed to turn out a batch of decent bars. Reduced the lemon juice and upped the sugar but it was still slightly too tart for my tastes. The shortbread was a dream. Friends and family raved. Will def make it again, properly. Great afternoon snacks with hot tea.

Excellent!!! Yum!!! My first lemon bar recipe, and it was the perfect combination of tart and flakey. Making the curd was a little vague-- I found it difficult to determine when it was done because it was pretty thin even after 15 minutes. I ended up pulling it off the burner and pouring and it firmd up perfectly. I didn't strain it, and it was fine. I like things very tart, so increased the lemon juice 25% and sprinkled 2tbsp zest on top of the curd just before the cooking. Definitely will make this again (and will double it!). Lots of powered sugar over everything at the end.

I followed this recipe to the T, and loved weighing instead of measuring-much more accurate. Each part came out perfectly and as I expected from the reviews. The shortbread was tender and flaky (mixed the flour in by hand) the lemon curd was picture perfect yellow, set well and tasted terrific. But I felt that the two did not complement each other. The buttery crust was too over powering for the lemon. I would use each separately but not together again.

Awesome recipe! I have every necessary kitchen gadget except for a candy thermometer, so I haven't been able to check precisely whether the curd was done the two times I've made this recipe. I've noticed though that at around 6 minutes, as prescribed in the recipe, the curd would begin to steam, and there would be an adequate coating on my spoon. That's when I figured the curd was done and ready to be poured. Twice now, the bars have come out magnificently to rave reviews. Mmmmm, so good!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, These were a great lemon bar, but felt that they needed just a little extra something..

This recipe is excellent. Making the lemon curd on the stovetop is time consuming, but well worth the extra effort. I tried a lemon bar recipe where the lemon layer was poured on top of the shortbread uncooked, and the crust became soggy. The shortbread base is amazing too. It is very flaky and tender. Making the dough in the food processor prevents overhandling. These were perfect on my first attempt. I tried this recipe with limes too, however they were more tart than the lemon bars.

These are fabulous. (As soon as I realized I was basically making hollandaise, I was fine with it). I used a whisk, never strained anything at any point, and next time will make the lemon curd first. I'm a really picky reviewer. This, the Ginger spice cookies, and Butter Cookies are the only things I've given 4 forks. I'm already wondering how key limes would taste in this, and tarts or tartlets would be amazing. Thanks Rose, and epicurious.

Hands down, this is my favorite recipe for lemon bars. The shortbread base makes all the difference. And the curd is perfect - not too sweet, not too tart. I also tried this recipe with limes and the result was wonderful.

I reviewed this recipe previously and tackled the recipe for a second time tonight. I took Boston's hint and turned the heat up on my electric stove...worked great! Much quicker results, just keep it moving, especially on the bottom of the pan, and don't worry about steam. Something else I noticed...I reduced oven temp by 25 degrees as specified for a glass pan (which I forgot to do last time) and it browned too slowly. So, I don't really know if reducing the temp is necessary. Otherwise, turned out great AGAIN. This is a GREAT RECIPE!!

Wow!!!! What a delight for the taste buds. I would make this again, and have the very next day. Everyone raved about this winner

To those whose curd took much more than 6 minutes to cook, I'm a chef and will attempt to answer your questions. I've made lemon and citrus curds many times and it has never taken more than 5 - 10 minutes. I think the key may be that when people are unsure, they tend to keep the heat on the low side. If the heat is too low, it will take forever for your curd to get up to temp. This problem is exacerbated when cooking on an electric range - they just don't have the juice that gas does. Here's the deal - the longer it takes for your curd to get to 190, the more moisture will evaporate out, which leaves you w/ a gummy curd! It's ok to start over medium heat to get going, but as long as you stir constantly, crank it to medium high and watch your thermometer. As long as it doesn't boil, and doesn't stick to the pan in any one place (thus the constant stirring), you are golden. It should happen MUCH more quickly for you the next time! Always strain the curd after, this gets rid of any egg yolk that may have coagulated during the cooking process. You don't need to strain it before cooking, just once after. Also, you can make the curd by itself and it's great on toast, or mixed w/ heavy cream and used as a mousse or frozen into ice cream (another of Rose's recipes). it's fabulous stuff! This was long but hope it helps~!

Actually, I was just looking for a recipe for lemon curd, so I've only made that part of this so far. I doubled this and used 4 yolks, and 2 whole eggs. I think the tartness is just perfect. As others mentioned, there is no way this takes 6 minutes. I have Rose's book that this came from and thought maybe the real time was supposed to 60 minutes, but it said the same thing there. I was determined to get it up to 196, but I gave up at 185. This has great flavor, and I will definitely use it again, but I would be very interested in Rose, or someone of that experience level, explaining such a discrepancy on the time and finish temperature.

This was my first attempt at lemon bars, and they turned out great! Like previous reviewers said, don't be intimidated by the directions, it's really pretty simple.

This is a good recipe although the directions are needlessly long and arduous. I found some discrepancies: one was that the curd took around 40 minutes to cook and take on the consistency of proper lemon curd. In the directions it says 6 minutes. I'm not sure what type of stove was used for the recipe, but on my electric stove it took 40 minutes on medium heat and the temperature on a candy thermometer read 190F - although it could have been cooked to perhaps 180F as the result was a rather gummy curd. The other problem with the directions was the 2 shortbread methods: the hand method states: "for either method, ... be sure to soften the butter." It goes on to "cream the butter with the sugar until light and fluffy". However in the food processor method it clearly states to start with cold butter that is straight from the fridge and no creaming or softening of butter is mentioned. Overall, the taste was good - I made mine by the food processor method. Be well prepared beforehand: have your mise-en-place ready to go, as cooking the curd may take you longer than you expected.

First off-- to "A Cook from San Francisco, CA on 5/10/03" -- thanks so much for your tip for mixing the curd ingredients first! I followed it and produced a silky smooth curd that needed no straining. These bars were fantastic and I had a hard time holding myself back from eating them up before the guests arrived. I thought they were the perfect ratio of curd to cookie and saw no need to double the curd recipe in the future. Too much would be overpowering. Also, I ran out of lemons and used about an ounce of lime juice, so it was more of a "citrus" bar, but still delicious.

Perfection!

Yep they are the ultimate. The curd never hit the temp indicated, just like another reviewer said. DEFINATELY double the recipe. Why bother with an 8X8?

I just had to chime in. I was looking for the "ultimate" recipe since this is my husband's favorite cookie. I have found it! He had a couple bars for breakfast today! I am sorry I did not take the advice and double the recipe. I am not convinced there will be any left when I get home. This is what we want in a recipe: straight forward directions and stellar results. I am simply thrilled with this one.

Easy and delicious. Multiplied recipe by 6 to fill a full sheet pan with a pan extender. Curd topping was kinda thin, which made cutting easier...up the curd recipe to 7 or 8 times for a thicker topping.

I found a way to make lemon curd without straining in Fine Cooking, May 1998, page 53, by Elinor Klivans. She says to use an electric mixer to cream the butter and sugar together for about 2 minutes. Then add the egg yolks and beat for 1 minute. Add the lemon juice and beat for another minute. Then you can cook the lemon curd according to the recipe, stirring constantly. It comes out absolutely smooth. These bar cookies are delicious - I made them for a potluck, but my boyfriend wants me to keep them at home for him and take something else to the potluck.

Delicious! Next time I would double the recipe in order to make 2 batches! They flew off the plate and I was longing for more!! :)

When I make lemon curd, I always strain the eggs in a strainer first. This gets rid of that white stringy stuff that attaches the yolk to the shell. It seems a hassle, but the final mouth feel is much better. Even my English granny would approve.

Absoulutely delicious! I've been obsessed with the search for the perfect lemon bar and I believe I've found it here. The lemon curd is wonderful. Full of tastebud tingling mouth puckering refreshing lemon flavor and not achingly sweet. The shortbread is terrific as well. I add a healthy pinch of salt to it and brown it a little more than suggested. It really enhances the buttery flavor of the crust. This is an utterly perfect dessert for a summer barbecue. I put a little whipped cream on top and garnish it with a sprig of mint. Heaven!

I made this recipe yesterday and was very satisfied with the results. Don't be intimidated by the directions; they went quite smoothly and quickly. The crust was perfect, not at all soggy. However, next time I'll definitely decrease the amount of lemon juice called for in the topping by just a little bit since I like my desserts a little on the sweet side. Otherwise this is a great recipe.

I have Rose"s cake bible and everything in it is wonderful. These are without a doubt the best lemon bars ever. I used 3/4 cups of fresh lemon juice (I like really tangy my sons, eat lemons slices)One reveiwer wrote that she was going to double the curd and turn it into a tart with whipped cream, that sounds heavenly I am going to try that also Thanks

I followed the recipe exactly and the bars were great. They stayed crunchy/flaky. My only comment is that I would keep them refrigerated. I actually liked them better cold.

Wow! I thought I'd mucked it up - shortbread looked too brown after only 30 minutes - but it's gorgeous. Will definitely make this again. Much easier than the length of the recipe suggests. By the way, I tested the curd with a candy thermometer and it never got as high as 196, as the recipe states - only around 170. But it still worked.

If you love lemon desserts this is the ultimate! I increased the lemon juice to almost 2/3c and YEOW was it tarty, it makes my taste buds scream as I write this! It reminded me of the lemon tart I had Francesca's on Taylor in Chicago! The next time I will double the lemon the curd topping and make this into tart, with fresh whipped cream.

Absolutely amazing! I made a batch of these squares and another batch using lime juice and zest for a Christmas party and all my guests raved about them. I love how the recipe is so precise and that the reasons why certain things are done (eg: the coagulation of the yolks and warning about using aluminium) were explained. But the taste of these squares are heavenly...my boyfriend, the "I never eat dessert" person even loved them!

I made these cookies last Christmas and everyone went nuts over them. They were the first to disappear from the cookie tray. I even sent some via 2-day mail to my out-of-state mom and they made it without crumbling. (She loved them, too. Declared them the best lemon bars ever!)

These are by far the best lemon bar's I've ever had. I made these for a barbecue, and my husband and I ate almost the whole batch on the way there! This will be my standard lemon bar recipe from now on.

Wow! This is truly the best lemon bar out there! I made some changes the second time I made these. I added Lime zest to the shortbread ( just cut it in with the flour and butter). Also, I skipped the part of wrapping the crust and refridgerating it. Instead, I took the crust mixture straight from my Cuisinart and poured it into the pan. Then, I pressed it down firmly. There seemed to be no difference in quality or taste, and it certainly is faster and easier. Second batch, I used all lime juice from fresh limes -- got even more rave reviews than with lemons.

Wonderful and delectible! Do not be turned off by the long recipe- really very easy. I left out the straining step entirely and they still turned out perfect. The shortbread mixture was very sticky and pasty as I tried to press it into the pan which made me a little nervous but was perfect looking once it came out of the oven.

I agree! Much easier than the lengthy recipe would lead you to believe and delicious results. I added poppy seeds to the pastry and topped the squares with fresh raspberries. Quite tart, but refreshingly so. Definitely part of my permanent recipe collection.

These bars are fantastic! I made them to give away and once they were done, I regretted not doubling the recipe. DOn't be deterred by the lengthy recipe directions, the prep time went pretty quickly. If you're short on time, I think you can certainly skip straining the lemon curd. I went ahead and strained it, but might skip that next time. I think you can scoop out all the "residue" with a spoon while stirring. Try these!!

At last - a recipe that gives quantities in grams! No "real" cook measures butter in cups or tablespoons, for heaven's sake! The fact that this recipe acknowledges that not all subscribers to this site are American, makes it one of my favourites.

I loved the base of these lemon bars,and the lemon curd is nice and tangy,but I cheated and did not put it thru a strainer seemed like a wasted step to me. They were really good cold. I will do them again and again.
