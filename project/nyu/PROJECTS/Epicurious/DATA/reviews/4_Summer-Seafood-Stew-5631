We love this recipe! I first made this recipe in 1999. The next time I made it I added lemon juice instead of orange juice we thought it tasted fresher. Now I make it all the time.

I added a fennel bulb and used striped sea bass instead of cod. Boiled the head and bones of bass in the broth. Came out great! I will make this again soon.

I made this last Friday, halved the recipe, used the snapper as some had suggested. The flavor was unique, and we enjoyed it. However, we wouldn't make it again. Interesting, but no thanks was the general sentiment. My boyfriend had leftovers for lunch the next day and said that orange was overwhelming. It's worth trying only if you want something different.

Absolutely delicious and very easy. Here's my two-person version: 2 small-med onions; 2 cloves of garlic; 1 28-oz. can of tomatoes; 2 cp. wine; 1 pint of fish stock (or 1/2 the clam juice); 1 heaping T of paste; 1 bay leaf; 2 T fresh thyme; 2 T orange peel; 1/2 tsp fennel; 1/4 tsp red pepper. For the seafood, I defrosted a bag of "Seafood Medley" (shrimp, mussles, squid, clams) and added a can of crabmeat (will use half next time, if at all). Served over brown rice.

Delicious. Very interesting undertones in the tomato sauce with the fennel and orange zest. I followed the recipe closely, only substituting mussels for the clams. Once the tomato sauce is done, the rest of the recipe is a snap.

This stew was excellent. Just as the recipe indicated, it serves exactly 12 people. As suggested by other reviewers, I added more thyme and orange peel which certainly enhanced the flavor. Also, I substituted Snapper for the Cod.

Fantastic. Follow the broth recipe exactly and you can, with success alter the types of fish and seafood. Have made this several times with cod, salmon, king crab etc. A truly delicious recipe, and very impressive to server to guests.

This is a good recipe for seafood lovers. I substituted tilapia for the cod and used fennel instead of fennel seed. Slight orange flavor is very nice. Mildly spicy. Served over pasta.

I really don't know what all the fuss is about. I followed this recipe to a T and found it to be so-so at best. Quite bland. I won't bother with it again.

easy recipe to make, all the flavors gel so nicely together. I ladled this on top of steamed white rice, my kids loved it, both of them are finicky eaters when it comes to sea food. Have made it on different occasions and will definitely show up on my table again

Made this dinner for 25 people. Kids and adults loved it. Thought the fennel and orange added such a unique flavor. Added mussels,squid and king crab legs. Will definatley make this many times.

This dish is wonderful. It's flavorful, easy, and hearty without being heavy. You also don't need super culinary skills to pull it off. I added mussels, squid, and a dash of Pernod towards the end for added anise flavour. Excellent for a dinner party. By the way, if you're looking for clam juice in a supermarket you probably won't find it with the canned clams. Go to the beverage section and look for it near the Clamato juice!

Thought this was very good. Used prawns, king crab legs and clams. We did have some left over- everything but the prawns reheated nicely. I will be making this again for sure.

A fabulous dinner...I used chopped fennel instead of the seeds and it was delicious

The combination of fennel and orange gave this recipe a delicate yet distinct flavour. It is something worthy of being served at one of the top resteraunts in the city! A winner in my opinion!

I cut ingredients precisely in half to serve six. The flavors blend so well together. I recommend adding more orange rind and thyme. Serve with the suggested basil and LEMON to give the stew an extra zing. I also added some oyster mushrooms which worked really well overall. In fact next time I think I'll add a couple varieties of mushrooms to make things more interesting.

Made this for our monthly game night with friends...we halved the recipe...it was very tasty...served it with a loaf of homemade french bread and marinated fruit w/sorbet for dessert. The stew had wonderful flavors.

I will make this again and again....very impressive. I made it for my family but would make it for company in a minute. It was so easy, I made the stew the day before, brought it to our vacation home and then added the seafood just before serving. Took just 10 minutes! Alot of great flavors, I wouldn't change a thing!

Fantastic recipe for a cool spring night. I used canned clams in their broth and all ready cooked frozen shrimp. I know it was cheating, but made for a much easier fantastic meal! Crusty bread and Italian salad a must.

It was delicous, We had it with pasta, but it would of been great just in a bowl with some crust Italian bread

The fennel and orange taste are a fabulous take on this Cioppino style dish. Though this recipe serves 12, I've easily converted it to serve just 2 for a romantic, quiet, Saturday night dinner.
