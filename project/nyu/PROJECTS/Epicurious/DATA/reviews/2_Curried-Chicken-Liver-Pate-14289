My sentiment with the previous review. It was extraordinarily bland to the point of flavorless. If you are going to submit a recipe, please don't do this ad lib suff of second guessing what you orignally tasted without ever having asked the cook/chef the proper ingredients. Luckily, I sauted the liver in the curry powder and folded in the garlic to secure taste. A little sea salt was in order necessary in enhancing the liver. Over all, it could be a repeatable recipe, if I didn't have to play the game of estimation.

Blech. This did not taste good. I halved the recipe to decide if it would go over with guests. First you need to peel the thin membrane from the livers otherwise it is just not smooth. People do not want to stumble over unidentified pieces in pate. YUCK! The curry powder and the liquor clashed. Even my garbage disposal husband turned up his nose to this.
