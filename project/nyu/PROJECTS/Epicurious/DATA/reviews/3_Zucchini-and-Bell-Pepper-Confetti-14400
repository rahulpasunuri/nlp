I served this with beluga lentils and some goat cheese. Tasty, filling, and awesome.

It's a keeper -- simple, colorful, and delicious.

I have been making this for years, and it's always a hit, colorful and fresh-tasting, with a nice texture. Sometimes I vary it a bit, using only one pepper and then adding a can of corn and/or diced fresh cherry tomatoes when the zucchini and pepper are almost done.

Serve this with the Seared Scallops with Lemon and Dill (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=107269). The sauce combines wonderfully with the vegetables!

I have made this several times and will continue to make it as zucchini seems to be in abundance all year round here. It is a really easy and tasty side dish with lots of color as well!
