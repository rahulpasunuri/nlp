I made this and thought it was good - but not terrific. I probably won't make it again....

I made this on a cold and foggy SF Saturday this past weekend and...WOW! Very easy to make and really tasty. However I used 1 split ham hock and black beans instead of hominy, because like many of us it's what I had on hand. No added oil as I just tossed all of it in my slow cooker for the afternoon. I can see how with the oil and hocks this might become a bit too oily for most people. Truly a great soup recipe that's very adaptable!

Addendum:In place of a true dutch oven, I sauteed the vegetables & spices in a wok on high for 5 minutes. Then placed everything (but the hominy) in a Crock-Pot on high for 1.5 hours (with fresh, not frozen, ham hocks). - Perfect results.

Spicy warmth with comfort food substance, a perfect winter evening meal (served with a french baguette and fromage cheese). We enjoyed the recomendation of adding a bell pepper. I also took the precaution of keeping out 1/4 of the chicken broth (& never needed to add it back in.)Next time I'll stay well under 2 lbs. on the ham hocks. The flavor is so nice, I am just as happy to taste a bit less meat. I will make this again and again. It may be my new comfort food craving. Enjoy!

First, a warning. 90 minutes is not nearly enough time for the hocks. More like 3 hrs. Changes: use celery and Gr. Bell Pepper with the onion, add a tsp of ancho chile powder for a little warm zip--and don't be stingy with the cumin. Tasty and filling!

Made as written with slightly less crushed red pepper. Next time I'm putting in the full amount. I thought it was terrific. Low maintenance and flavorful. Next time I'm going to add some collard greens and maybe some turnips to fill it out a little.

I've made this three times in the course of a few weeks. I used 1.5 lbs. smoked ham shanks, 2 lbs. of ham hocks is a bit fatty and salty. Once it was a bit too spicy so I added one extra can of broth and it still came out wonderful--more like a soup. Do not substitute corn for the hominy--it's just not the same at all.

My mother fills our freezer each year with fresh, smoked pork from the local 4-H livestock shows! The only problem - finding something to do with a whole hog! We used a smoked ham, chopped into chunks in place of the ham hock. Based on other suggestions, I ALMOST traded out the hominy for corn, but am glad I did not. This turned out wonderful! We put out hot sauce, salt and pepper, expecting to need extra seasoning, but even our 4-year old slurped this one down! Will save for next year's 4-H hog show!!

Loved it. Only change was to back off on the chicken broth a bit to thicken it up. Kept great over a week and tasted great ever time I got it out of the refrigerator.

As suggested by another reviewer, I used a ham bone from a Honey Baked Ham in place of the ham hock. Otherwise, I prepared this dish following the recipe. I thought it was hearty with lots of smokey flavor, but also a little too oily for my taste, most likely from the meat and fat still on the ham bone. My boyfriend, however, loved it. It hit the spot, too, after a day of below-freezing temperatures and the first snow day of the season.

Great recipe. Easy to prepare and tasty. No modifications needed.

This was horrid. We love ham hocks but obviously one in a soup/stew is enough. Just tasted like salt.

This exceeded my expectation in depth of flavor. I also added some black beans - a colorful contrast to the yellow hominy. I decreased the stock to make a thicker "soup". This will be part of my regular winter family meals.

This dish was excellent. Instead of a ham hock I used a ham bone from our Christmas dinner ham. Since it was already cooked it did not require the full 1 1/2 hours of simmering. I did simmer it for about an hour though to flavor the broth. I also had meat left on the ham to remove and add after simmering. I garnished it with some grated cheddar cheese and even my 5 and 7 year old loved it!

This is a keeper. However, I did not add any salt, and I recommend that all others do likewise. I added some navy beans along with hominy.

This was wonderful. A hearty meal for cold weather.

I have to tell you that I adapt most recipes to suit my family and my time needs. All I did to this one was to add some presoaked small navy beans. It was so delicious!
