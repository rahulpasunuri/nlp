Very good! I used fresh chopped spinach and radicchio and added near the end of cooking. I also used a dash of nutmeg. Would be great with mushrooms too.

Simple and delicious using ingredients that are staples in the kitchen. Next time I'm going to add sauteed shrimp--YUM! Thanks, Epicurious, for another winner!!!

I thought this was a delicious risotto. Like other reviewers I used garlic with the onion. I didn't use wine, vermouth or the pernod, but I did blanch 3 big handfuls of fresh spinach and add it in at the end. Other changes, to make it creamier, I used an egg yolk beat with 4 Tbsp half and half with 4 Tbsp grated parmesean, and added some more parmesean and a few pats of unsalted butter at the end. My very picky 22 month old ate this!

Nothing left in the pot! Used a rotisserie chicken to make the broth and added 1 1/2 cups of chopped chicken breast at the end. Had some fresh spinach so I cooked and chopped it before adding.Didn't have Pernod - is this something folks commonly have on hand? Even my picky teenager enjoyed this.

Spinach risotto is extremely tasty. Here is the version of my recipe: http://eatmania.com/2010/10/18/risotto-with-spinach/

This was delicious. Used seasonal spring vegetables from my CSA - green garlic (sauteed with the onions) and fresh chopped spinach, added just before the rice was done. Added extra parmesan too. Tasted great.

This was amazing! I added fresh garlic to the onion before adding the rice in, just b/c I love garlic! And, I also added in some sun dried tomatoes in the end (b/c I love the combo of spinach and sun dried tomatoes). Delicious!

This was a great risotto recipie that made good use of ingredients I had on hand. I did make a few modifications; substituting shallots for onion, vegetable broth for chicken, omitted the Pernod (did not have in the house) and added a healthy handful of chantrelle mushrooms. Delicious, got rave reviews and will definitely make (and serve) again!

This was the easiest risotto I've ever made. It obviously takes time - it is risotto after all - but it comes together quickly and you probably have everything you need on hand already. I skipped the Pernod only because we were out, used vegetable broth in place of chicken since I'm a vegetarian, arborio rice and a mix of frozen and fresh spinach. I also drizzled truffle oil over each dish before serving...yum... It serves two well but it's not an overwhelming amount of food. enjoy!

This was really tasty, it was my first attempt at making risotto (ate it a plenty)and it was easy --as long as you have the patience to stir for 20 minutes. I used Basamati and it was still yummy and I loved the idea of using the spinach water so did that. Highly recommend.

YUM! Tweaked this one by adding prosciutto and nutmeg, and used vermouth but no Pernod. Otherwise, followed the recipe. I make risotto in a pressure cooker because it comes out creamy and perfectly cooked.. and it only takes seven minutes.

First time risotto maker here and I'm pretty pleased with how it came out. Half of this recipe is enough for two, in my opinion. I steamed my spinach first then pureed it a little of the steaming water. I simmered the spinach mush over med-low to get some of the water out. I added it at the end with the parmesan and it came out smooth and silky! The type of cheese you use is very important because it caps the flavor, I think. The particular blend I used didn't jive with the spinach as well as I had hoped.

I used frozen spinach & steamed and pureed it before adding, veg stock rather than chicken, arborio rather than long grain, omitted the alcohol & used marscapone & a mild cheddar instead of the parmesan (as they're what we had in!) - was lovely & would definitely make it again. Does make an enormous quantity though so might half it in future - as a main this served two adults, two kids & there was still a portion left in the pan!

Made this last night for a potluck - only changes were I didn't use Pernod and did use canned vegetable broth. Was the hit of the get-together.

I like this basic Risotto recipe a lot. I used arborio rice, fresh baby spinach, and added a tablespoon of butter for extra creaminess. A pinch of fresh grated nutmeg gives it a great taste too.

Made this tonight without the mushrooms, as it was a last minute prep. Had farmers' market fresh corn, roasted it in the oven. I'll try frozen another time to see if there's a difference. Also used a Maui onion, adding more sweetness to the dish. I never steam spinach prior to adding to a dish to retain nutrients, flavor, and save time and pots - just stirred the raw baby spinach in with the other final adds and it was perfect. Overall result was a very fresh, delicately flavored risotto.

I liked this recipe a lot, and I liked some people's idea of using fresh spinach, although the packaged spinach made it really easy. Next time I might cut down on the onion, because the onion was very noticeable, but it's supposed to blend into the rice and be almost imperceptible. I also had to use about a cup more liquid than was called for. Overall, this is an easy risotto. Everyone who mentioned that it was time consuming and that you had to stir it a lot--well, that's the essence of risotto! If you don't like it, don't make it!

I loved this and with the spinach scare substituted peas and it was yummy!

We really liked this recipe. I used Riso rice and it turned out great. I didn't use the full amount of broth called for, only about 2 cups. This was a big hit for my 2 1/2 year old who is not a big eater. She cleared her dish. Will definitely make it again and use the spinach water also.

This was good, but it wasn't what I was hoping for. I had eaten some spinach risotto at a restaurant that was to die for, and I was hoping this recipe would taste similar to it. The primary difference between the two versions was that the restaurant version was very smooth. Maybe I'll try this recipe again and puree the spinach.

This was quite good! I used vermouth instead of white wine, and skipped Pernod since I didn't have it in house. Also, I used brown rice instead of white, so it took longer to cook and needed extra liquid--I just put in the squeezings from my spinach so I wouldn't lose those nutrients, and that was about 3/4 c additional liquid. I stirred "frequently" since I didn't want to stir "constantly" and that worked just fine. I definitely recommend this recipe.

I love this. It is simple and delicious. When I was pregnant, this was my craving, and I couldn't get enough of it! Now that the hormones have leveled off, it is still wonderful, and has become a staple in my house.

This is a good, basic risotto recipe. I used fresh baby spinach, arborio rice and added some fontina cheese. I will make it again, but not in the summer - too much time over the hot stove.

I rarely give four stars, but this recipe was a winner with my entire family, and it was fairly simple to make. I don't like spinach much and was looking for a somewhat healthy and tasty way to prepare it. I used fresh steamed spinach, jasmine rice, good quality Parmesan cheese, vermouth rather than white wine, and no Pernod. I used a nonstick pan and had to stir it only every few minutes, so I didn't have to hover over the stove all night. It took about 20 minutes to cook using the 3 cups of chicken broth the recipe calls for. Even my uber-picky 12-year old loved it--this recipe is definitly a keeper for our family!

I have made risotto numerous times and find this recipe incredibly boring. It was too bland! Spending the time and attention for risotto needs to be worth it. Even the parm-reggiano didn't make it better!

i will definitely make this dish again,except,i modified it by accident,and it was still excellent,so i saved it to my computer and modified it that way. i thought the recipe called for already cooked rice,which i used(i was specifially looking for a recipe for leftover steamed rice).and i only used 2 cups of chicken broth mixed with 1 cup of water(and i still had some left over),and i didnt use and vermouth(i dont even know what that is)and this turned out excellent. halfway through when i realized that i was not supposed to use cooked rice, i thought for sure it would end up soggy.but it wasnt!it was sooooo good!frozen spinach alone is not very tasty,but mixed in the rice was just the perfect flavor.

Quick, easy, and good--all of the things I look for in a weeknight meal. I used this as a side dish with beef tenderloin, and it made about four servings. I'd make this again in a heartbeat--all of the ingredients are standard pantry items, and it turns out great!

I would actually give this 2.5 forks! I have made and eaten risotto before and this was by far not the best one. I ended up doctoring it up with a few sun dried tomatoes and some toasted pine nuts which helped. I think the best risotto ever is one with mixed mushrooms and a shot of cream in addition to the parmesan. But, my family did eat it and seemed to enjoy it.

I used this recipe to make risotto for the first time...now I'm hooked! Very tasty and easy!

Very good healthy risotto (seems like lots of other dishes this size want 5-6 tablespoons of oil or butter instead of 2). I also skipped the Pernod but did use spinach water in addition to homemade chix stock. Great side dish with grilled steak or salmon.

I make this dish as often as I can! Use vegatable broth instead of chicken. It adds more flavor. Don't need the pernod. If being used as a side dish you can feed as many as six with this recipe.

There's nothing tricky about this risotto - just the constant stirring and attention it requires. But my recipe cooked in less than 30 minutes, even though I doubled the proportions to serve 9 for dinner. Pernod is a licorice-flavored liquer, and I left it out - the vermouth flavor was enough on it's own. Also, unless this really was going to be the main course, I got 5-6 servings out of this recipe - not two.

Rating: 4
Great dish to serve under grilled fish. I used homemade chicken stock - little less than 4 cups and I used the water I squeezed out of the spinach since that is the good stuff with all the nutrients. Definitely a good side dish.

This was very tasty with some leftover turkey tossed in! I used about half of the spinach, and no pernod. Delicious!

Wow! I used arborio, fresh spinach and vegetable broth and a little chopped red bell pepper as suggested by another review. My husband and both I thought this was one of the best risottos we'd ever had. It took a lot more liquid (5 cups) than the recipe suggested, though. I made up the volume with a little more broth and a lot more wine. So easy to make, though it did require constant vigilance.

Excellent and easy to make. I used half roasted garlic chicken broth and half no-fat/low salt.

I puree steamed fresh spinach, artichoke hearts and a little butter. I've made it untold times but the most appreciated was when I dehydrated it to take on a strenuous backpacking trip...re-hydrate and backwoods campers (and bears) for miles were salivating.

If you can stir, you can make this recipe. I might opt for fresh spinach, or perhaps reduce the amount of frozen spinach used as it is a touch overwhelming. Nonetheless, it was yummy-even my 18 month old gobbled it up! I will definitely make it again.

FantastiC! Just the recipe I was looking for. Except that I used fresh spinach which I lightly cooked, cooled and pureed with a little bit of butter. Then I stirred it in with Manchego (Spanish) cheese because that is what I had on hand. Just fab!!! My italian-origen hubbie loved it and smiled with green specks everywhere!

This is delicious AND easy. The only drawback is the attention it requires; I definitely couldn't get the rest of my dinner ready without some assistance. I skipped the Pernod (since I didn't have it in the house & didn't know what to substitute), and would probably do so again.

I had done this risotto before, but the pernod adds a really nice touch. I've done it with chick peas, which I throw half-way in. (you can use the liquid you cooked them in if they are not canned). My torinese husband loves it because it is a comfy,"feel-good" food.
