This cranberry sauce was really something special. I would give it four stars as written. David Lebovitz has a great recipe for crystallizing ginger, and I did use homemade rather than store-bought. I used a mixture of navel, tangerine, and juice oranges for the cup of orange juice.

A perfect second cranberry sauce for folks who make one traditional batch plus something a bit more daring. You might have some unexpected converts to the new recipe!

Increased sugar a bit, used cran juice rather than water and strained out a lot of excess liquid. Increase crystallized ginger and add as suggested after cooling. Very delicious!

This is a delicious cran sauce. The orange zest and ginger are a nice combo. I made the mistake of adding the ginger at the beginning instead of toward the end, but it still came out great. I think the ginger would be more distinctive if added later.

I have made this every time I haves hosted Thanksgiving for the past 10 years. It is excellent and great to eat later on sandwiches or toast.

I have made this for two years in a row and it is amazing every year. In fact, this year over Thanksgiving, I even served it on top of a pumpkin cheesecake I made-it was great!!!

Wow! My new favorite cranberry sauce recipe! I cut it in half and it still fed a party of 10 with lots of leftovers. The balance of ginger with orange is just right. I would definitely add more sugar. Served it with the roasted cornish game hens and sweet potato risotto from this site. It's also delicious atop english muffins with mascarpone cheese.

Excellent! Served this with Thanksgiving dinner, ate leftovers tonight with smoked chicken. Will definitely make again.

I've tried at least a dozen of the 4-fork cranberry sauce recipes from epicurious, and this one is in my top three. It's delicious, has a wonderful consistency (thick, but not gloppy - easy to dollop), and the ingredients are all things I keep on hand. I didn't use the ground ginger, just the crystallized.

Rating: 4
Crystalized ginger seems to be the magic ingredient in so many dishes, and certainly in this one. I followed other cooks' advice and upped the sugar a tiny bit, but otherwise made as directed. Perfect.

I have made this recipe for several years and it is a family favorite. If you are having difficulty locating the crystalized ginger, check your local health food store, where it should be readily available and much cheaper than the grocery store.

I made it for the first time, last year, to rave reviews. I will be making it again this year.

My favorite cranberry sauce recipe. I make it every Thanksgiving. If you have any left over it's good over vanilla ice cream.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. I decreased the sugar slightly and was generous with the ginger. Served it over grilled mahi-mahi (who said you should only eat cranberry sauce with the Thanksgiving turkey?) and it was perfect, tangy and sweet at the same time.

Rating: 3
Agree with the last reviewer in that the recipe, as written, was a bit bitter, but that was easily remedied with a 1/4 cup additional sugar. I also substituted cran-raspberry juice for the water and added in a few thinly sliced kumquats for additional color and texture. A real crowd pleaser, even for those who typically passed over the cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving dinner. Would definitely make again.

I've had better cranberry recipes. I found this one a bit bitter, which was a surprise.

I skipped the parsley and added some fresh grated ginger - so good - but no leftovers!!!

Rating: 3
My husband and I really liked this cranberry sauce. (In fact, I had to remind him that we were going to have dessert so he wouldn't keep eating the cranberry sauce after the meal was done)! I also thought it was too "saucy" and I would cut back the sugar.

Rating: 4
Dead easy and absolutely wonderful! It will be part of the Thanksgiving feast from here on out!!

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone really liked it. This replaced my original choice of Cranberry Sauce with Marmalade and Cinnamon (from this site) which I ended up throwing out because it was gross. This has just the right balance of sweet and tart. Will make again!

Rating: 4
This was a big hit at Thanksgiving. Just on a whim I added orange marmalade and honey and it was really great. It's sweet but it's still got a kick to it. So easy to make!

Rating: 4
This was amazing. I always make a cranberry orange relish for Thanksgiving, and this topped it by a mile. I used all the recommended crystalized ginger and then a little extra, and didn't worry about mincing it too finely. It was wonderful. My telve year old loved it, and so did everyone else!

This is as good as cranberries get. Delicious.

Just made it for Thanksgiving and it smells delicious and tastes great warm. To czancol from NY, always use freshly grated peel. The dried peel doesn't have the same great flavor and strength.

QUESTION PLEASE ? Do you use fresh grated orange peel in this or the dried stuff in the jar ? THANKS

This is really delicious! You can eat it by the spoonfull. The longer it simmers, the better the flavor

I generally don't like cranberry sauce and I was eating this with a spoon straight from the container! I used lime zest and juice because that was what I had on hand and really enjoyed the extra zip.

I made this as an accompaniment for sauteed venison. It is delish.... I can't wait to have it next year for Thanksgiving.... and on sandwiches... with roast chicken......

I loved this recipe! The ginger added a little extra oomph to this Thanksgiving tradition. I also used a little bit of lemon zest along with the orange zest, but otherwise made the recipe as it is written. It does make quite alot, so unless you have a huge crowd who loves cranberry sauce, I'd cut this recipe in half.

I've been making this cranberry sauce to acclaim since the recipe published in 1990. I can't imagine a Thanksgiving without it. Everyone I've ever given it to raves about the snappy taste and the easy preparation.

Rating: 4
This is my favorite cranberry sauce recipe. I love the addition of the orange juice and the ginger. Come to think of it, I might add a tablespoon or two of Grand Marnier to it. In the future, though, I shall halve the recipe. It does make quite a bit of cranberry sauce.

Really great, simple recipe.

I made this two years ago to great reviews. Last year I made a different cranberry sauce recipe from BA and people missed the sauce from the year before. I'm now going back to this one again as demanded. This is becoming a Thanksgiving staple.

Cranberry sauce couldn't be any easier! The ginger really adds an extra zip to the usual cranberry/orange combination. This is sure to be a holiday staple.

My aunt brought this to Thanksgiving years ago, except she added toasted slivered almonds for texture, FABULOUS! Everyone demands we have it every year!

I love the ginger in this recipe. Made for last three Thanksgivings and everyone raves. For a yummy change of pace, add a bag of frozen raspberries and substitute cranberry juice for the water.

Rating: 3
This is very good - the flavors are delicious together. My only complaint is that the crystalized ginger melted completely rather than staying in chewy bits. When I make it again I'll let the sauce cool before stirring in the ginger.

Rating: 4
I too have made this since I discovered it in '90. I give it away as gifts now and everyone loves it. It's great on toast and scones for a few days after - if there's any left over from Thanksgiving. YUM!

Rating: 2
This is very tasty, but too sweet for my taste, even with cutting back 1/4 c. of sugar. Very "saucy" too. Next time I'll back even more sugar and use 1/2 the water...

Rating: 2
I was in a holiday rush and accidentally added the crystallized ginger at the beginning so it cooked with the cranberries. The end result was that the sauce tasted chalky or powdery - almost like powdered ginger gone bad - it was strange. But i have cooked crystallized ginger before with no strange aftertaste. So, ??? Not much got eaten unfortunately, but my mom turned the sauce into great cranberry muffins the day after, so all was not lost.

Rating: 4
Great recipe, tastes better when made one or two days ahead and flavors have blended well.

Rating: 3
decent recipe. i think i should have minced the ginger to finer pieces. although i enjoy the tangy taste of ginger, i don't enjoy eating pieces. maybe i'll try finely crushing it to let the flavor really come out next time.

This will be our 7th year making this recipe. It's a staple on our table every year. It is especially good with leftovers, ona turkey sandwich. I've never made it with the chrystallized ginger, and it's been great anyway.

WOW! The ginger was a new, exciting taste sensation! I admit that I didn't use all the ginger that the recipe called for and I'm glad that I didn't! I like ginger but it may have been overkill. Next time I'll add orange rind pieces as well as the zest.

This is a great recipe. I never knew that fresh cranberry sauce was easy. Tasty and good for you!

Instead of sugar I add maple syrpe (B)grade. I also add approx. 1/2 cup pineapple bits. Everyone has asked for my reciepe. You can also cook the leafovers down into a spread for you english muffins or toast. I never lasts long!!!

I made this last Thanksgiving for my housemates and was everybody's favorute for weeks. It's just wonderful!

How can you go wrong with the simplicity of this recipe and the excellent results every time? My family loves it and our guests look forward to it whenever we serve any kind of poultry. I even add it to the pot to help flavor the "usual" brisket adding a little red wine for a beautiful gravy. Couldn't be better!

Used half of all ingredients, but otherwise followed the recipe faithfully and it was the best cranberry sauce I have had in a long time. Took all of 5 minutes to make and was too tasty for words. Make this!

An annual favorite at our house. Delicious tart flavor with just the right sweetness from the ginger. Great with turkey.

We've been making this sauce to accompany our Thanksgiving meal for eight years. It's a fabulous sauce for the untraditional turkey preparation my wife favors (her turkey seasoning is heavy with garlic and cilantro -- very Caribbean!). Never a boring Thanksgiving meal with this sauce!
