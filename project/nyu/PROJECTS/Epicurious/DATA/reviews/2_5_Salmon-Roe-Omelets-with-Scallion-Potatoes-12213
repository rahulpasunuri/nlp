THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. Using frozen Ikura (salmon roe) that I let defrost in the fridge overnight, I rinsed them quickly under water. I used non-fat yogurt and fresh scallions. The omelette-- while very fluffy, was almost cake like and THE FLAVORS DID NOT COMPLIMENT AT ALL. The ikura was much too fishy which could not be compensated by the yogurt and scallions. In fact it has a fruity sweet flavor which was incredibly off-putting. The potatoes were a MESS. The yogurt and steam from the potatoes created some kind of separation and weird sweetness to it. YUCK. Perhaps the other person liked it b/c of all the substitutions. Doing this right = DISGUSTING!
