A definite hit at the office today! I rushed it a bit and didn't let the honey and creme fraich soak in long enough before throwing it back in the oven, but it still turned out great. I spooned all the caramelized honey and cream back on top; such interesting flavors it made!

I thought this was good, but it needs modifications to make it great. I followed the recipe and bought sourdough and I wish I hadn't; it's got too much of a twang. Next time I'll use a plain country loaf or challah. If using a more rustic bread, I'd say that leaving it 2" high is too much bread (the bread to topping ratio is too high). Per other reviewer's suggestions I also flipped it and used the bottom as the top (and poked it all over) with good results. Because I made it for a dinner party, I cut, buttered, toasted and spread the honey on it in advance then spread it w/ the creme fraiche and let it set for about an hour or two before baking and it worked out fine.

Liked it very much, but wish I'd read all the reviews before making it. Next time I'll butter and toast it, then slice some wedges part way thru, then pour the honey/lemon combo and spread the creme fraiche. I didn't use quite all of the honey/lemon or creme fraiche, because my boule was smallish. If I'd sliced wedges beforehand, I would have used it all. The flavor was still amazing. And I normally can't stand honey! I'm going back for another piece now. :)

My partner absolutely loved this - I would however use a little less creme fraiche next time

This was tasty, although I would change a few things. I would reduce the honey by half - I found it too sweet. I would also reduce the creme fraiche by half - too much pooling on top. I left mine in for about 45 mins, waiting for it to get "golden," and should have left it in longer. I used a fork to poke holes and speed up the soaking in, as another reviewer mentioned - it still took 20 mins and I had a layer of the creme fraiche on top. When finished, it didn't look like the picture but was still good. I much prefer it cold.

I loved this bread, but my family thought it was only so so. I cut the bread into wedges but not all the way through, then poured the 2 tbsp of butter which I melted first, over the top. When I poured the creme I attempted to get it into the wedges. I then topped it with a dusting of cinnamon for some color.

Mmm mmm mmm. I used a round challah loaf, which was excellent for the recipe. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer, and I used the bottom as the (larger) surface for adding the honey and cream. I used a fork to poke holes in the bread to help the honey and cream soak in-that helped a lot. A cold leftover piece was DIVINE for breakfast the next morning-almost better!

It means that after cutting off top and bottom crusts (as directed) you spread the softened butter on those surfaces.

What does it mean, "butter cut sides of bread?"

This dessert is DELICIOUS! I only have trouble getting all of the spread to soak in. But I find letting it soak for longer helps. It is super super tasty and EASY, try it if you haven't already!!

Question: Is the bread supposed to soak up all the creme fraiche? When I made this the creme just sat on top. It tastes yummy but a little dry since its just basically bread with the ingredients on top. I do like the idea and the flavors.

I made this last week for my family and they loved it! I made my own creme fraiche(I got the recipe from the Learn section of this website)and it was a hit! It was very unique, yet absolutely delicious! I will be making this again for a brunch that I am having soon!

Wonderful! I used leftover challah scraps and baked them in individual serving dishes. I also topped them with honey butter before baking and served them with a cinnamon Anglaise. I am definately making this again.

Simple, delicious and different. Great with tea or coffee for a snack or brunch.

I gave this recipe a 4 fork rating because it really is beyond compare. Delicious yet simple, it's perfect with a cup of coffee. It was so easy to make that I actually found the time spent very relaxing. The only thing I will do differently next time is to use the bottom of the boule as the top of the dessert. This way more of the honey-lemon-cream mixture can soak in.
