Wow! Great recipe! The people who are complaining about it being too salty did not read the recipe. It clearly states "Add 2 to 3 tablespoons salt and the spaghetti". To the water...not the sauce! So if you're saying you followed the recipe EXACTLY, you didn't. It's not fair to say it's a bad recipe if you prepared it incorrectly. I've screwed up myself lots of times by not reading it clearly enough. Try it again. I'd bet you like it. And so easy!

Really, too salty. If you read the instructions, you will realize the 2 - 3 Tbsp.salt is for the pasta water. If you do not know how to boil water, you should check this out. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/foo d/reviews/Salted-Water-for-Boiling- 105591 ~Inez

One of the most disappointing recipes I have ever tasted. When my boyfriend told me he put 3 TABLESPOONS of salt in it, I thought he read it wrong....but sure enough, he followed the recipe exactly. The amount of salt in this is enough to gag you...

I'm appalled that nobody commented on the amount of salt in this recipe. If that isn't an error it's a recipe for high blood pressure and a heart attack.

The beauty of this recipe lies in its simplicity. It allows you to add almost any ingredient you want without the flavors competing with each other. I admit I was afraid it would be bland but it turned out to be just exceptional.For reference, I added some red wine, onions, a little oregano and some red pepper flakes for a little heat and I made turkey meatballs to go with it. Three 26 year old men said it was the best red sauce they have ever had. And with this group, I consider that a very high compliment.

This recipe was fantastic! I read the reviews prior and sauteed some onion to add in. I also added portabello mushrooms, some ground sirloin, and extra diced tomatoes.

Loved it! used tomatoes from our yard, added a shallot to garlic, also added a couple spoonfuls of tomato paste, and about a cup of chicken stock. Probably could have used more tomatoes, hence the additions. Per one viewer below, I added about 2 TBS cold unsalted butter after I pureed sauce. Heavenly!! Butter makes just about everything better:)

I had been searching for an easy and delicious red sauce, and this is it. I've used Pomi boxed tomatoes every time I've made it, which makes it even easier. Perfect use for my immersion blender.

I used fresh tomatoes and grated them. It's messy but gets the job done quickly. There's a lot you can add to this but we liked it as is. Use both garlic cloves. It's a light sauce & would be good cold. Great everyday fast recipe!

The easiest sauce I have made...and frankly one of the best. I used canned tomato pulp and it worked great!

This is so simple and delicious! Once I added an entire stick of unsalted butter to the sauce after it was finished for added richness. The "wow" factor hit the ozone levels of YUM! I have come to rely on this recipe for our basic tomato sauce for pasta and other things, like use it over seared or grilled fish, grilled poultry, and truly delicious with veal chops!

I used angel hair instead and found the sauce to only be enough for 8 ounces of pasta. Definately use all the garlic and season with plenty of salt & pepper. Easy enough to make again.

I didn't taste the basil, I didn't taste the garlic, and I didn't really taste tomato either. I seriously thought that maybe I was catching a cold and that's why I couldn't taste anything, but I could taste other things, so it's just this unbelievably bland recipe. I'm a real tomato lover, and this was a huge disappointment. Luckily it was as effortless as it was tasteless.

Finally weaned my husband off of Prego with this lovely blend of flavors! I add more garlic, a dash of red pepper flakes, and use canned tomatoes. I am looking forward to making this with fresh tomatoes. The first time I made it, I didn't think it was going to be enough sauce for a box of sphagetti, but it really is. Just remember to reserve some of the pasta water because you will need to use some of it.

As others said, surprisingly good for how simple! I didn't add anything else, and it was still tasty. I can see this going well with olives or anchovies added.

This was really simple and delicious. I used canned tomatoes because fresh are so expensive right now. I will make it again.

This dish had delicious flavors that all came together and was a wonderful way to use my fresh garden tomatoes. I added black olives and extra basil and oregano for additional flavor!

here's my spin on this dish: i sauteed two cloves of garlic in oil and added carrots and a bit of water. then i added sliced zuccini and yellow squash. while the veggies were still crisp, i put in the tomatoes and added a pinch of cinnamon, a dried bay leaf, fresh oregano and basil, roasted red pepper strips, and small amounts of three different kinds of chili powder for flavor and heat. then i added another clove of garlic toward the end of cooking. my boyfriend and i loved it(but then, we love garlic!).

Yummy! Excellent sauce and easy to prepare. This is the first time I've made sauce from fresh tomatoes (I usually use canned). The flavour was very good - two thumbs up!

When you look at the recipe, it doesn't look like it will be all of that. Don't believe it, this is delicious. Add the crushed red peppers for sure and then watch their faces light up. I could survive a long time on this alone.

This is face-in-the-plate, lick the plate clean damn good sauce! It does taste very fresh. I used plump tomatoes from my garden and I added 4 cloves of garlic. I added extra pepper and then let it sit for about 15 minutes then slightly reheated it and served it over pasta. YUM-YUM! I also tried this with yellow tear drop tomatoes and added a pinch of sugar, it's a good milder version.

Great food! I resisted my usual urge to add a couple of pinches of sugar, at the advice of other reviewers. Sauce was delicious. I served it over gemelli instead of spaghetti. Great recipe find. Thanks so much, Epicurious.

Perfect recipe as is. As for the sugar thing---I was told many years ago that and old Italian cook in our town always added a pinch of sugar to take away the acidity. Her son told me that when he became diabetic, she added a few raisins instead. I have also come to appreciate the value of San Marzano canned tomatoes. Tough getting good fresh ones year round. The canned San Marzano are always sweet.

I made this tonight using a 28 ounce can of San Marzano tomatoes by Simpson Imports. They were domestic tomatoes and the recipe came out so good! I happened to have them in my cupboard and it came out very sweet and delicious without using any sugar or balsamic vinegar. I hope I can find them again when I can't get good fresh tomatoes--in fact I'm not sure it would have been any better. I got them in a nice grocery store here in Palo Alto

One of the chefs on FoodTV added a pinch of baking soda to tomato sauce to counter act the acidity. Has anyone ever heard of that?

This is absolutely authentic. The tomatoes keep their fresh taste. This is how momma does it. And just to add my two cents on the sugar thing--forget the sugar. Only a gavone (sp?)would put sugar in their sauce.

I loved this recipe, but this is really about the sugar. Why are people infatuated with sugaring the sauce? I find that it taints the flavor of the sauce. I agree with the methods of sweetening that A Cook on 06/09/02 recommended: Chopped carrots or a sweet wine. I personally prefer the flavor that wine lends to a good sauce, myself...

nice and simple. as to the sugar discussion, I was taught to add sugar. But I forgot it once and it tasted so much better. I asked my mother and she said her mother told her. We all quit using sugar!

To answer A Cook on 10/26/01 Mario Battali was born in Seattle, Washington. And I too cannot understand the public's obsession with adding sugar to tomatoe sauce. Fresh tomatoes are already sweet and if using canned tomatoes I would recommend finding an Italian market that stocks San Marzano tomatoes. That is not a brand name, it is a style of tomatoe, sweet, rich and low in acid. Both of my parents came from Italy and my mom (and every other Italian cook I know) added sweetness to the sauce by adding chopped carrots. Adding a sweet wine, such as Marsala or even domestic Reisling will also "sweeten" the sauce. Me? I like the acidic taste. To Corrinne, who wondered why all the salt: The salt goes into the pot of boiling water to season the pasta. It is NOT added to the sauce.

We could not understand all that salt. I used only l tbls. and still was too salty for us. I used fresh herbs to add; however, my husband thought very bland...did not use the red pepper as recomended.

For the life of me, I can't understand why people pour sugar into tomato sauce? Anyone who has ever eaten a vine ripened tomato knows how sweet they are. I was raised in America, but my family is from Sicily. Even if you buy good canned plum tomatoes, they are canned vine ripened. Southern Italians were imported spices centuries ago and tend to go more spicy than Northern Italy, so I too would add hot red pepper flakes. I am not a pretentious person who is saying pleeeeze don't do this or that, it's just a sharing to you from my heritage, and sugar is never added. Tomatoes are used fresh from the vine or canned fresh from the vine. Mario Batali from FTV adds small diced carrots to his basic sauce. Though he is obviously Italian, I'm not sure what region of Italy he comes from, though that bright orange hair is telling! If you feel you must 'sweeten' your sauce, try his way before you pour in sugar. Bottom line is that if you feel you must add sugar then please do so, just please know that it really isn't necessary. Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out where that fallacy came from? Seems people add sugar because they think that is what they are supposed to do, or because someone told them that is what they are supposed to do. I guess we all get stuck in that revolving door! Just try it without one time so you at least can have a comparison...you just might be surprised! How many people do you know who pours sugar into a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice? Think about it?

I took the advice of the other reviewers and added sugar and crushed red pepper. However, I also added fennel seed while sautéing the tomatoes. The result was great.

great dish for the days when you've had it rough and want to eat well and then relax. I added red pepper flakes, toasted walnuts (chopped) along with some spinach. Tasty!

Very tasty- but be sure to taste and fight the acid with sugar and salt. Also, I find some crushed red pepper really perks the sauce up.
