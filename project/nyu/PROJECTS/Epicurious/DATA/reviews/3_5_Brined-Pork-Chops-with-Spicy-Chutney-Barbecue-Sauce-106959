Great hint of 'bbq' flavor and brining the pork makes it moist & tender. Used thick boneless pork chops & brined for about 24 hours. Didn't make the chutney, but did serve with watermelon rind chutney from this site (great use of watermelon rinds -- outstanding flavor).

My family RAVED about this chops. They were not to salty at all. Followed the brine recipe exactly. Didn't use the bbq sauce.

Too salty. It's pretty good as a super quick brine to put together, but I would use less salt next time.

I love pork chops, and my husband hates them - but he'll eat these. I think they're fabulous. I have never bothered with the chutney - we usually have plenty of our own homemade stuff lying around - and just follow the brining and grilling directions. The chops are tender, juicy and flavourful - none of that nasty dry texture. I've also used 1/8 cup of chipotle instead of chili powder, and they turned out even more delicious. You MUST use coarse salt for the brining, as table salt will be way to salty (both due to flavour and quantity - 1/2 cup of table salt is a lot more than 1/2 cup of crystals). Even though it feels a little sinful to "waste" on brining, I use Maldon.

I also found these chops way too salty. Perhaps I should have patted them REALLY dry? Not impressed.

Definitely not good. The porkchops came out far too salty and lacked any real flavor. The porkchops were certainly moist but that did not compensate for their blandness (all I tasted was the spice from the chile powder). Will not be making again.

I doubled the amount of water and brined for ~8 hours and i thought it was the perfect amount. Either that or half the amount of salt/sugar, otherwise I think might be too salty.

Like many other reviewers I only used the brine and grilled the chops. They were tender and flavorful. They went from the brine to the grill. Super easy and delicious!

OUTSTANDING!!!! My first experience with brining and I'm hooked! These chops were tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned - without the sauce. I live in a condo and can only have an electric grill so I usually add a bit of Liquid Smoke to any sauce/marinade/brine for anything going on the grill. Here I added 1/2 as much Liquid Smoke as brown sugar and salt to the brine which turned out perfectly - just the right amount of smokiness. I served the chops (no BBQ sauce) on a bacon & date puree with honey glazed carrots along side for a fabulous meal. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Adjusted the brining solution for two extra thick chops, and used a spicy/peachy Q sauce. The chops were exquisite - wonderful flavor and texture.

I made as directed and brined 1" thick chops about 3.5 hours, rinsed and dried, and they were moist and well seasoned.I shortened the brining time because of the reviews of too salty. I usually use the cider brined chop recipe in this site, but I will use this brine recipe from now on.

These were the juiciest, most flavorful pork chops I have ever had. I brined them for about 10 hours and they were delicious. I used Kosher salt and grilled them for 17 minutes and they were a good medium-well, but still juicy and not dry. I didn't have the ingredients to make the sauce, but these were great without it.

My 7 year old took one bite of her pork chop and said YUMMY! Easy, quick to make. I didn't have enough chili powder in house first time and used some Paul Prudomme's Pork & Veal Magic seasoning. Turned out great.

Fantastic! My family really enjoyed this recipie. Very simple yet tasted like it was prepared in a five star establishment. I was hesitant to try brinning but glad I did.

I used boneless chops because that's what I had on hand and they were great. I used course salt for the brine, but they seemed just a smidge too salty. I'll probably experiment with a bit less salt. Still, it was a big hit and really easy to make! Loved the sauce too.

This was my first brining experience and I was delighted with the results. Make sure you use a COARSE salt - I used a extra-coarse Brittany sea salt. The BBQ chutney with the recipe is outstanding.

I'll never grill pork chops again without first brining them. They were amazingly tender and juicy, with just a hint of the chili flavor from the brine. And the sauce - to die for.

WOW, this was awesome. Bought thick bonless loin chops and brined for 7 hours. The BBQ sauce was a hit. Make this......you won't be disappointed.

This is one of the best pork chop recipes around, as the brining produces tender, juicy chops despite today's painfully lean and dry pork. The cook from Maryland must have done something wrong; perhaps she used regular table salt instead of kosher salt, which makes a big difference. Don't even think about using table salt for this!

Rating: 4
I don't know what is wrong with the previous reviewer. These were the moistest,most flavor chops I've ever made. I was leary of all the salt but the chops didn't taste salty at all. Marinating at least 6 hours is a must. The meat need time to absorb the flavors and moisture of the brine. This recipe is a keeper!!

I'm so upset about this recipe. I brined the pork chops for the recommended amount of time (overnight--about 9 hours) and they came out tasting even saltier than country ham! They were completely inedible and so 35$$ of superior chops went into the garbage (didn't even want to give them to the dog--afraid she'd die of high blood pressure!) I had to run out right as my company was arriving and get something else to throw on the grill. On the plus side, the mango chutney BBQ sauce was delicious--but nothing could save those chops! If I ever dare to try brining again--it will only be for 1 hour!!! Please--correct the directions to this recipe!

This was wonderful! I will always make my chops this way. I only marinated them for about 5 hours and they came out wonderful. I've made them twice already. Thank you for this great recipe!

The moistest, tastiest chops I have ever made -- brined 1" chops only 4 hours in a Vac-u-vin marinator, and they were fabulous. I had to use just ketchup instead of the chili sauce, but it is really the mango chutney that makes the bbq sauce so delicious. RAVE reviews, and all plates were licked clean. Enjoy!

Honestly, the most delicious pork I've ever made. Easy to make and quite versatile. I substituted mexican seasoning for chili powder and it tasted great. Also, for the sauce I used Sriracha sauce. You can find it in any asian foods mart and the occasional super market. I'm never cooking pork any other way. Ha, actually that's a lie. Enjoy.

Wow! My family has never been a big fan of pork chops because they are generally rather dry.....until now. The brining made these unbelievably moist. Easy to make and a huge neighborhood hit. Even our kids are requesting this dish over and over.

This was the first time I've tried brining pork chops and what an excellent outcome. They were moist and delicious. The bbq sauce is also excellent. I used Tabasco because I didn't have habanero sauce. Next time I will look for habanero sauce though, because I like things spicy. But I highly recommend this recipe!

A word of caution: When I was making the brine, I decided I didn't need all 6 cups of cold water - it was enough to cover the chops with just an extra two cups. Result: very salty chops. They tasted like ham. Guess you need all that water to cut down the salt. Then again, why not cut down the amount of liquid you boil? Confusing to me, but everyone else got good results.

Think this might be my first "four-fork" on epicurious ... but the brined chops are delicious! For a last-minute gathering, they were in the brine for only 5 hours but were as juicy as good steaks. Inch-and-a-half chops BTW are called "Iowa chops" in the Midwest. In Iowa, they're sold cut thick in every grocery, here in St. Louis, any butcher will cut them like this. Another BTW: for food safety, don't think the prior reviewer's use of the sauce is a good practice unless the sauce is boiled well first. Don't skimp on the chili powder, it provides flavor without heat.

This is now my absolute favorite summer pork recipe!!! The pork chops are the best I've ever had, and the sauce is SO addictive. The first time I made this, I had enough of the sauce leftover for the next day & it went fantastically with a beer can chicken done on the grill. I always get raves whenever I make this for someone.

these were the best pork chops i've ever had - i brined them for 10 hrs & they came out perfectly seasoned, moist & tender. i had the chops cut to 1-1/2" by the butcher, & for dinner parties, it really makes a great presentation, but i'd think that regular-thickness chops would work as well. the chutney bbq sauce is out of sight & well worth making on its own to use w/ any meat!

Rating: 4
I used boneless porkloin cut into chops because it was on sale at a great price....and it worked very well...made a nice presentation with the yummy sauce in a bowl at the center of a round platter. Brining made the texture of the meat very pleasing, and no one flavor (chili, brown sugar) really "stood out"...just a pleasing blend.

What a GREAT find! Rave reviews from friends. Will definately be making many times in the future grilling season.

Outstanding Recipe! I have always had a problem grilling chops and keeping them moist and juicy. These were absolutely delicious. And the sauce was great too! I didn't have mango chutney, so I substituted apricot preserves instead with terrific results. My husband said that they could possibly be the BEST CHOPS he's ever had! I take that compliment very seriously considering we've been married almost 20 years and he's a partner in one of NYC's premier steakhouses!

These were by far the best pork chops I have ever eaten. I used a vacuum sealer so the brining was complete it one hour. I am not a big barbecue fan with pork chops so I just seasoned and grilled them. They were juicy, tender and flavorful. They tasted like a really good steak, but better. These are quite impressive for such little effort.

I was in a rush and could not brine the chops for the recommended 6 hrs to 1 day. Still, this dish was incredible!! The chops were still very moist and the sauce was absolutely unbelieveable. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.

I've made this several times now. My whole family loves it. The brining really makes the pork stay moist. I serve it with a similar sweet chunky barbeque sauce as as mango chutney is not something you always have around.

Like another reviewer, we just brined the chops and barbecued them (we were on vacation and couldn't find all the chutney ingredients at the store). They were delicious. I'd definitely do this again.

The pork chops come out great. Very tender and juicy. I will always brine for now on. We did like the sauce. It was different, not just the same old BBQ sauce. I used rice vinger instead of apple cinder vinger, so mine could have been milder than the others.

The pork chops themselves tasted great; the brining really did keep them moist. But I was really disappointed in the sauce. We served the chops at a BBQ, and people ate a lot and seemed to really like the dish, but next time I'll try a different sauce.

Brine the chops, by all means. But we scraped the sauce off the meat and threw it on the compost pile.

These are the best! They are very moist and full of flavor. I made these twice, the first time with 1/4 cup coarse salt and the second time with 1/2 cup salt per the recipe. It was much too salty with 1/2 cup. The chutney was fabulous and a must to compliment the pork chops.
