Very good. I doubled the sauce as recommended by others. I also could not find turnips so I used parsnips instead. These were great in the recipe. I only wish that I had taken more effort to trim the fat from the ribs. It was a little greasy for my tastes, but that was definitely my fault.

Surprisingly good. I had never cooked with turnips and didn't know quite what to expect. I substituted with bone-in pork chops, sriracha sauce and approximately 1-1/2 tsp of anise seed since I had these items on hand. It had a nice spicy/sweet flavor, next time I will try using quinoa instead of the rice.

I was really disappointed with how this recipe turned out. I made the recipe as-is with the addition of extra broth as recommended by other reviewers. It smelled fantastic, but both my husband and I were disappointed with how bland it tasted. It wasn't bad, and was certainly edible, but for all that fat it should have tasted divine, and it didn't. It did not improve much in the fridge, either. When you got a bite with orange peel, it tasted great, so maybe it would be better to zest a whole orange instead of just adding a few strips of peel.

Like the other reviewers, I added about 3 times as much stock and cooked it longer. I actually most often make this as a crock-pot dish. In the morning, I brown the ribs while my husband makes the marinade broth. We drop the whole business in a crock pot. The carrots and turnips we prep and leave in water for the nanny to throw in an hour or so before we get home. I only use 1 star anise, because I think it is too strong with the longer cooking otherwise. Anyway, I love this recipe and make it all the time.

I had scads of turnips from the garden, hence this recipe. Really satisfying! Changes: doubled the sauce (and added additional chicken broth while it was cooking), cooked the ribs for 1 hour before adding the veggies. Used Sriracha in lieu of paste (too hot for me, but fine for sweetie). Made sure the turnips were just a tad crunchy - not so overcooked that they were mushy. Will make again.

I made this last night and I did not like it at all. I followed the suggestions: adding more broth mixture, cooking a little longer, little more garlic. I did not like the flavor combination. My husband thought it was ok. I tried it again today,hoping the flavorw would develop, and still didn't like it.

Had all ingredients on hand and this recipe did a wonderful job in bringing everything together. I used more chicken stock by 3 times to end up with a good and flavorful gravy. Served over smashed red skin potatoes. Cut most fat off of pork and browned nicely in hot pan. Recipe is a keeper.

Heavenly! This dish is DROP DEAD DELISH. Actually 4 forks isn't enough. I did double the gravy, but it still wasn't enough to cover the next night's dinner. I added a pan of pork bones (necks, etc) which only added to the flavors. I had to make it a little less spicey, because it would have been to hot for husband. Otherwise it is yummy. What a pleasure to make it and eat it. P.S. I also threw in some little potatoes. Yes, I'll make it again and again.

This was extremely tasty. After reading a few reviews, I cooked the pork slightly longer than the recipe called for both before and after adding the vegetables, and added about twice the chicken stock. The meat was falling-apart tender. I did not have any star anise, but the other flavors stood well on their own.

I was torn between this recipe and the Orange-Soy Braised Pork Ribs on this site. . . so I sort of combined them! Basically I just left out the chili paste, increased the garlic and added orange juice to the sauce mixture. I cooked about 7 lb of country style ribs in a HUGE electric skillet and fed 12 people to rave reviews! It simmered for about 2 hours and was delicious.

This was awesome, great flavor! I agree with the other reviews, you need to make more of the sauce. I didn't double the recipe, I just added a cup of water. You can reduce it at the end by taking off the lid and turning up the heat. The star anise really gives this recipe its flavor.

I used boneless country-style pork ribs and cut off all the fat on the outside. I didn't see any fat floating on top and the dish seemed to be leaner than I thought it was going to be but still left a bit of fat for savory flavor and moistness. I recommend turning over the meat halfway during cooking so any pieces on top get a chance to braise in the liquid. I didn't do this. I found the dish to be tasty and delicious. In fact, the flavor combo is so good I might try this recipe with chicken breast.

I have not made these but to answer the too much fat comment I usually low boil the ribs in water for 20-30 minutes. This will melt out a lot of the fat. Remove pork from water and pat dry with paper towels before proceeding with the recipe. Going to make this tomorrow.

Very good, the star anise adds a unique flavor. I added the carrots and turnips 15minutes earlier than the recipe suggests and added an additional 1.5c of water so all the vegetables were submerged. It worked great

I am giving this 4* before even trying it, based on the complexity of flavor suggested by the wonderful turnips and carrots and spices it's braised in. However, before I try this, I need to know what happens to all the fat in the country style ribs, as far as I know, the very highest fat content cut of the pig, after bacon. Having cooked these ribs, I can say there's WAY more fat rendered than I'd care to have in that sauce. Answer here?

Oh My! This was exceptional--especially the next day. I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the sauce ingredients, and increased the cook time to 1 1/2 hours total. I didn't have sambal oelek, so I just used sriracha sauce and red pepper flakes. I also subbed sweet potatoes for the carrots and turnips because I like them in Asian flavors. Sweet, hot, and very complex flavors without too much effort. I served with Texmati blend rice and multigrain garlic bread.

I'll make this again but with some minor modifications. I doubled the sauce mixture, skipped the sambal oelek (kids don't like spicy) and the turnips (blech) but doubled up on the carrots. I added a pinch of anise (didn't have whole star anise). I added the carrots when adding the pork, as I'd cut the carrots fairly large; I cooked the stew for the full hour and the pork was still tough. I had some brown rice in the oven that still had an additional 25 minutes to cook (Alton Brown's Baked Brown Rice absolutely rocks -- it's the only way to make rice) so I just left the pork on low for those 25 min. It totally transformed into meltingly tender chunks! Had I served this at the one hour mark it would've been nearly inedible; the additional time made all the difference. Next time I'll pull out some of the sauce, cool it, make a slurry w/ cornstarch, then add back in and bring to a quick boil for a sec to thicken things up a tiny bit. This had great flavor and I'll happily make it again -- maybe even trying it in the crock pot...

This just did NOT do it for us. The pork was not nearly as tender as I would have liked it and it was afraid of flavor.

Fall has arrived in Connecticut and this was a nice dish to counter the early chill. I agree with others that the flavors are multi-layered. The star anis really shines through. Had friends over for dinner and they left happy!

One fork means "OK" but I think this recipe is awful. After reading the two 4-fork reviews, I checked the recipe again to see if I did anything wrong. Can't find anything. To me, it was bland and inedible. I ended up tossing the whole thing in the trash and ate something else. This is a first for me when it comes to Bon Appetit!

This recipe provides complex and rich flavors: anise, orange, ginger and more. Pork shoulder is inexpensive and can be tough but not with this recipe. Pork was exceptionally tender. Also, I kept adding chicken broth to the pan to generate more sauce. I used black soy sauce - which I don't recommend and won't do again. It is too intense. Use a light soy sauce. Even the teenager cleaned his plate. I will certainly make it again.

Our leftovers from this dish just ran out today, and my husband is already requesting that I make it again! The pork turns out incredibly tender in a relatively short cooking period (I'm thinking about the long hours I spend roasting a Boston butt). The only thing I did differently was I doubled the broth mixture since I had double the amount of pork, but kept everything else the same. The flavors were absolutely delicious!
