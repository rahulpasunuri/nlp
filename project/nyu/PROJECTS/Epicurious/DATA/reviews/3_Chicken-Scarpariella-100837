I've made this several times, it's a family favorite. I rated the recipe 3 forks rather than 4, only because I think the sauce should be reduced at the end and then poured over the chicken - very flavorful.

Based on the reviews, I was surprised by how tasty the sauce was! Tangy and flavorful, with a good balance of sweet and salty. The rosemary and parsley were a good combination. Note: this was made without garlic and was still delicious. A good meal with rice.

maybe i didn't follow the direction correctly ...tasted good but not as expected. the bird never really browned enough as I think the low temp was not appropriate. my dinner had lots of liquid and i thought it should have been dryer with a more powerful taste. i'm going to give it a go again and try some alternatives to the recipe as given. did anyone else have issues during the browning process? I served mine with pasta and the sauce was delicious. It was the chicken that some to be desired. i'm making a soup, right now, from the leftovers.

The dish was very flavourfull, though the browning took quite a while so I think that needs to be done on high heat. Also, the sauce came out a bit thin, but the overall taste was very good.

This dish was very flavorful. Chicken turned out a little dry. Next time, I think I will reduce the wine vinegar to 1/4 cup, omit the brining, and use regular chicken parts, probably whole legs. It was just yummy!

This recipe is bombastic and the preparation is pretty easy. The one alteration that I made is the omission of butter, and it was fantastic (although, admittedly, I don't know how it tastes with the butter, so I have no basis for comparison). Next time I plan to use much more garlic than the recipe calls for. D-spankin' lish!

I love the sauce. My family made it without red wine vinegar, I'm not sure that it needs it. Also, the full chicken is not so much needed. Chicken parts would do nicely, and would be easier too!

Delicious and easy to make. I didnt have wine handy so I used (arrgh) cranberry juice instead. I also used skinless boneless chicken breasts. So I can imagine that it would taste even better if I used all the ingredients called for. The lemon, rosemary and oregano were the dominant flavors. Yummy!

Not worth the effort. Will not make this again.

Incredible!! My husband (a really picky eater) said, "This is great!". I think the brining did make a difference because I used less oil then the recipe called for and the chicken was very moist and juicy.

This chicken reminds me of an old family recipe. Everyone really enjoyed it!

I am a 13-year-old cook, and I made this dish for Mother's Day dinner. My mother helped some, but I found it pretty easy to make this dish. It turned out very good, with the chicken falling off the bone. I served it with Roasted Garlic Orzo, and the sauce from the chicken was very good on top

Very good light chicken dish. I don't know if the brining for only an hour makes a difference, but the dish is good none the less.

This was delicious -- I give my approval as an Italian! The rosemary flavor is definitely the dominant one. Some suggestions: I rubbed the spices into the chicken breasts directly to enhance the flavor, added a little extra butter and more garlic (there is no such thing as too much).

I used four breasts instead of a whole chicken and cut most of the ingredients in half, except for the garlic. I also used just a little thyme instead of the oregano. This dish has an outstanding flavor and aroma. I can't wait to make it again!
