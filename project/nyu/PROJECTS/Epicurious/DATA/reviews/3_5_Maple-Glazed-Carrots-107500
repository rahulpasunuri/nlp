I've been making these for the past 8 years and it is always a requested dish. If you are making these for a Thanksgiving Feast it will serve 20 people. Making it for a regular dinner I would cut the recipe in half for 8. I use fat carrots and cut them in chunks, rolling on the diagonal. You must use Grade B pure maple syrup for more of a maple taste.

Great flavor! I wish the sauce was a little thicker.

I halved the recipe and used baby cut carrots that I cut in half diagonally, which worked out fine. We did not find them overly sweet at all - everyone loved this dish. Very pretty & delicious.

We enjoyed this v.much. Having read some of the reviews which mentioned how sweet the carrots were, I halved the butter and sugar quantity in the glaze, but kept maple syrup quantity the same.

was really hoping these would be a step beyond your typical glazed carrots - they were not. i was disappointed as I followed it exactly - i have true PURE maple syrup and the flavor just didn't *pop* like I was expecting. The ginger carrots i made last christmas were much better.

made these for thanksgiving 2008 and was underwhelmed. they were okay, but i was expecting the maple to add a note beyond the regular sugar-glazed carrots and it didn't. I would go back to the carrots with ginger (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Carrots-with-Ginger-102449) i made off this site last year instead - those were much better.

Delicious carrots. I made them as written but would try to cut down on the butter next time to reduce the fat content. Makes enough for a crowd.

These were an excellent addition to our Thanksgiving feast. Somehow they can be easily forgotten but the truth is that people (and especially kids!) really love carrots! Plus they rounded out the presentation with their bright color. But beware of cooking time...mine got a bit over-cooked while I was busy making the gravy.

Even my picky family that "doesn't like carrots" ate this and loved it. Ours served more than 8 because they took small servings. Would definitely make again.

I don't normally like cooked carrots, but these were fantastic. They were more like candy than a veggie though and not exactly health food. But for a special dinner, these are great. I prepared the carrots and the glaze seperately in advance so once dinner was ready, just a quick reheat and we were good to go.

These were great and easy to prepare. Though I have to admit I would not make them all that often considering how much butter went into the recipe!

This was very good. The only thing I added was a squeeze of lemon and some flour to thicken the glaze just a little. Served it with pot roast and mashed potatoes.

I don't like cooked carrots, yet this was really good & I definately will make it again. My husband thought it could have more flavor.

I made this for a potluck Christmas party. Someone forgot to put it out with the other food, but the carrots were found and devoured later in the evening. They were fantastic cold, warm, as a snack or with a meal. (And I hate boiled carrots!!)

Delicious carrot dish. Needs something of a sour or spicy component to add depth and balance the sweetness but I am not sure what.

Rating: 4
These were a very nice side-dish for Thanksgiving. Easy to make ahead, they only required minimal work at the time of serving, and they had really good flavour. Probably one of the better carrot recipes I've made. I made it as written, but halfed the recipe.

I made only 1 lb of carrots but only cut the sauce by half and it was delicious. I thought with all of the sugars and the syrup it would be overly sweet but it was perfect. I also didn't have any fresh parsley but it was fine without.

Great carrot dish. I only made 1/2lb of carrots and used the peeled baby carrots from the salad aisle. They were very tasty.

This is a very simple to make and exceptional dish. My family loved it. I didn't change anything about the recipe, except I left off the parsley. I will definately be making this dish again.

Really great. Made this to bring to a Thanksgiving dinner and will make it to bring to a Christmas Eve dinner this week. Travels well, just bring cooked carrots and sauce in separate dishes and combine and heat to serve. Not too sweet at all-and I hate overly sweet dishes. Great for families, kids will eat it too.

I tried this dish last night, because I am going to prepare it for my family for christmas. It was outstanding.

These were great, loved by all, not too sweet. Made the carrots the day before and reheated with sauce. Can't go wrong - great for pleasing a crowd.

Made these for Thanksgiving and they were delicious. I cooked the carrots the day before and rewarmed them before glazing. It worked out fine.

My husband cooked this dish for Thanksgiving one year. When we were asked by one of my uncles to bring a vegetable relish tray, my other uncle and cousin called with a special request that my husband bring this dish.

This turned out exactly as you'd expect. A perfect recipe for maple carrots. No tweakage needed whatsoever.

We made this for Christmas dinner and it was delicious. We followed the recipe as written and didn't find it too sweet. We did cook the carrots the night before and then just fixed the sauce the next day, which made it very easy. We will definitely make this again.

I have made this three times and it is delicious, not over sweet at all!

Previously, I had never eaten or made this type of dish. I prepared this for Thanksgiving b/c of the positive reviews. As the recipe suggests, the dish is incredibly sweet. Overall impression: reminicent of yams w/marshmellows.

My daughter-in-law brought this to our Thanksgiving dinner and everyone raved about it. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Delicious and easy to make! Definately use pure maple syrup...

Rating: 3
An outstanding veggie, esp. for kids and at holidays; it got raves even from a friend who hates cooked carrots. My only caution: This dish doesn't refrigerate well (no leftovers), as the butter hardens around the carrots. Also, use real maple syrup -- it's the best!

A lovely way to prepare fresh carrots. I will definitely be making this again.

I made these for Christmas and the Maple and Tangerine Glazed Carrots for Thanksgiving. This one was much better - very easy to make and not too sweet contrary to popular belief!

Rating: 4
Very good but agree quite sweet. To compare, try the Gingered Candied Carrots recipe in the original Silver Palate cookbook. They are the best I've ever tried and always get rave reviews. Just about anything I've ever cooked from Silver Palate gets rave reviews! Another good one is the Balsamic Carrots from this site, also very good.

Didn't find these too sweet as did some of the other reviewers. Not too difficult to make and good.

Waaaay too sweet! The good thing about that is...the kids and hubby (with the etreme sweet tooth) devoured them.

Rating: 3
Wasn't as sweet as I thought but YUM! The next day it was even better. We did a taste test and make a different batch using oj instead of water and only brown sugar w/salt and pepper. Reviews were mixed but overall, the maple carrots had a smoother flavor, the oj ones were sweeter.

Made these for Christmas and my brother told me they were the best carrots he had ever eaten! I might not go that far, but I (along with everone else) went back for seconds!

My kids didn't want to try it as they "don't like carrots." Once they did, they asked for seconds. Of course skipped the parsley for the kids. Great recipe!!!

These were a great and colorful addition to our prime rib dinner for Christmas. Yum!

I cook for fellowship meals at our church every week and finding vegetables that kids like is tough but this was a hit! I did, however, alert our diabetic members NOT to eat and had just lightly butter carrots for them.

My husband didn't want me to make this because he doesn't like glazed carrots. I made it for me and he even liked it. I took the advise to cook carrots in advance , forgot to set the timer and over cooked the carrots but they were still delicious.

ha! had to page down to find the "Cat" review that caused such furor. :) we like vegetables, plain and fancy, and both thought this one was a keeper for company... a special treat.

Folks, an absolutely delightful side dish! To Cat, my 29 yr old sister is diabetic (since she was 6) she has a son and is extrely healthy occasionally even she tries dishes like these and she loved it. My advice to you is, since you feel so strongly about the fat content in food: the next time you see maple or glazed in a recipe DO NOT CLICK ON IT. Why be a sourpuss when there are so many recipes for people like yourself. Just let those of us who did click on this for the pleasure of the recipe enjoy and try to make your contributions positive, perhaps about healthy substitutions. Instead of non-constructive criticisms because it's not your cup of tea.

WOW...Loved it. The perfect side dish. Listen Cat in Canada. It isn't something you eat every meal or every day or every week and you don't have to eat the entire thing by yourself. Everything in moderation, including criticism.

This recipe is very easy for such a delicious side dish. I have made it twice and had rave reviews

I made this exact type of carrots on christmas day (yesterday) but I only made about 1 pound of carrots so there was proportionally less butter and maplesyrup (I didn't use brown sugar at all) but the combination of maple and carrots is quite pleasing - and isn't everything better with butter?

Haven't tried it yet; it sounds absolutely delicious! Note for Cat from Canada. If you haven't anything positive to say - say nothing!!! No one is forcing this recipe on you!!!!!!!

I'm sure this recipe is delicious but look how much fat and sugar is involved! Maple syrup is sweet by itself. Why include brown sugar? Do you really need that much butter? By adding all this butter and sugar you have turned what should be a healthy side dish into something that could kill a diabetic just by reading the recipe.

They were delicious, perfectly seasoned. Would definitely prepare these again.
