I used this recipe mainly just for the sauce that I planned to use with something else and I made a few tweeks. Instead of water I used coconut milk and I cut back a little on the lime juice. I also used a half cup of peanut butter, adding more to taste, and didn't use any oil. And since I was using it for a different course I mixed all of this in a sauce pan over low heat. Definitely recommend it done this way.

As a base for a sandwich/wrap, it was pretty good. The sauce was too thin so added more peanut butter. Mixed roasted chicken breast and napa cabbage w/ dressing and rolled in a tortilla. It was good, not great, and would probably make it again.

Overall, this was a decent base recipe. The sauce is a bit bland, so I highly recommend adding more of your favorites. I added more hot sauce, but the extra peanut butter idea sounds good as well. I ended up with leftovers after all the toasted pita was gone, and I used it to make a stuffed pita sandwich and topped it with a little hot sauce. It was excellent! Also, I prefer white meat (tastier and healthier), so I used chicken breast that I poached in a skillet with fresh sliced ginger root. I'll make it again, for sure, even if it's just as a chicken salad base for sandwiches.

Made this dish for a dinner party. I'm a peanut freak, so I about doubled the amount of peanut butter and it was outstanding!

I thought this dish was very good and easy to make. I thought unlike others that the peanut sauce was quite tasty. I also dipped vietnamese spring rolls in the sauce as well.

Definite winner! Instead of pita, served it in mini-phyllo cups. Don't know what's wrong with the other reviewers because this appy was LOVED by my guests. Maybe mid-westerners can't handle a lot of flavor.

I think chicken satay BITES says it all. This was so unappetizing I threw it out rather than serve it to friends.

Fast and easy. The peanut sauce is good, but not outstanding. Added extra chopped dry roasted peanuts and salt. Served it to a group of 20 and while it didn't fly off the table like the wasabi shrimp rice crackers did from the same story, it eventually disappeared. Didn't make a pretty appetizer even with the cilantro leaf -- using dark meat as the recipe suggests made the chicken just look like a dark brown blob.
