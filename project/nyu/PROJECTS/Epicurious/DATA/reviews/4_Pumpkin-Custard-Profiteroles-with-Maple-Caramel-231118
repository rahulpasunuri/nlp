Really really good and a lighter and more unexpected alternative to pumpkin pie. Thanks to everyone who commented below, the replacement for maple sugar works great (1c brwn sugar + 1/4c real maple syrup), and agree with 1.5x the spices.

Made these as my non-traditional Thanksgiving dessert. I'm very happy that we other desserts and these were not the sole offering. I have made profiteroles several times in the past. I made these the first time from this recipe. The dough came together fine but the cook time/temperature were way off. I burned the first batch (and my oven is calibrated). The second batch I went with my tried-and-true recipe and they came out fine. The custard came together easily but water baths are a pain. It cooked an additional 15-20 minutes to reach done (and probably could have gone longer). The custard was unappealing to look at. It tasted overly allspiced, weak on the pumpkin, and generally kinda nasty. I did not make the caramel sauce so cannot review it. I will not make these again.

These were indeed tasty, but the pumpkin custard, in my opinion, is far too rich and lacked substantial pumpkin flavor. As others have mentioned, the recipe makes way more custard than is needed. We ended up throwing the remainders out because we didn't really care for the taste of it (which says a lot since we are pumpkin and dessert lovers!) If I were to make it again, I would make a standard pumpkin pie filling and use that to fill the profiteroles.

Made this for our dinner club with a Canadian Thanksgiving theme and it was well received. Made following adjustments. 1) Definitely only need to make 1/2 of the custard. Agree with doubling spices as it would have been bland. Disagree with previous review that this is just like pumpkin pie; it's much creamier due to the heavy cream. 2) Used the Maple sugar recipe as suggested and had a mild maple flavor. Used Grand Marnier instead of bourbon. Would use salted butter or add some sea salt to seson the caramel as this was definitely lacking. Skipped the whipped cream as I felt there were enough elements already. Overall this is was a nice alternative to pumpkin pie and much more elegant. Will make again.

This ALWAYS gets raves, and someone always asks for the recipe. I love that it can be made ahead in the busy holiday framework. It is a showy and elegant, texturally interesting, spectacularly tasty end to Thanksgiving dinner.

Puffs turned out well, I watched them as other reviewers suggested. Had some major problems with the custard. In spite of the water bath, it dried and cracked in less than the full amount of time. Figured it was already a bit of a lost cause, and tried adding some whippped cream as some other reviewers suggested. It was not salvaged. Ended up filling with some store-bought pudding instead. So disappointing!

Delicious and pretty. Followed the recipe to a "T" and made everything the day before, except for the whipped cream topping. For a party, when you are short on time, you can fill the profiteroles just before guests arrive, refrigerate them, and then at dessert time drizzle the caramel sauce and top with the whipped cream and pecans.

Oh my dear god, these are amazing! Very time consuming but so, so worth it. The only issue I had is that the oven time on the profiteroles was too long. They ended up way too dark, but they taste fine. It could be an oven specific issue...convection oven might have helped.

This recipe is just obviously not for everyone. My family did not like it. My guests were polite but I noticed they didnt clean their plates and the biggest hit of Thanksgiving were the pavlovas I made with the left over egg whites from the custard! The pumpkin custard tasted exactly like pumpkin pie filling, was dense, a little grainy and not the light custard I thought it would / should be. My 1st batch of profiteroles burned on the bottom a little after 25mins at 375 so I would reduce the time somewhat, or I would revert back to my tried and tested choux recipe which uses less eggs anyway. I did not buy maple sugar so used brown sugar with maple syrup and changed the bourbon to brandy. My final take on this is use a patisserie cream or plain whipped cream filling, easier, less expensive and a better, more popular result.

I wanted something a little different for Thanksgiving dessert and these were fantastic! The pastry comes out light and buttery and as many others have said, the custard is wonderful on its own. I had to make just a few changes though. Like many other reviewers, I didn't want to buy maple sugar so I followed the suggestion from the Joy of Baking and just used 3/4 cup granulated white sugar plus 1 teaspoon pure maple extract for every 1/2 cup of maple sugar needed. I just whisked it together and made the recipe for the syrup as written and it came out really well. Although I thought the bourbon flavor was a bit too strong for my taste so I ended up making another batch and just used 1 tsp. of maple extract and it had a great flavor. I also used a piping bag to pipe out the pastry and it saved me tons of time since the dough is quite sticky. I actually completely underestimated how much these things grow in the oven! So I doubled the recipe and came out with about 25 extra large pastries, but I'm going to freeze the extras and i'll have them on hand for another time. I also suggest using a pastry bag to add the filling to the pastries. It saves time and its easy since they are so light and airy, there is plenty of room to fill them. I just used the back of my honey dropper (or a chop stick, straw, etc would work) to make a hole large enough for the tip of my pastry bag and it went much quicker than slicing them all and spooning in the filling. Plus it makes them easier to eat. Overall a really easy recipe, just plan ahead and make it in steps to save time.

I made these for Fat Tuesday and they were awesome. The pumpkin custard is excellent with the caramel. The custard recipe definitely makes more filling than you'll be able to use with the profiteroles. I made double the profiteroles, but ran out of custard filling with the second batch so I just made a cream filling (heavy cream, confectioners sugar, vanilla extract whipped together) for the remainder.

I wanted to make Pate a Choux with a really light custard filling. I still haven't found one that I like yet, but I stumble upon this recipe and thought I'd try it out. I personally do not really sweet desserts...I made the Pumpkin custard as it calls, but I whipped additional whip cream and folded it in after. It made it so light and I think it's how its suppose to taste. If you plan to just use the custard alone, I think its just pumpkin pie filling. I did double the Profiteroles, but I think I need to make a third batch to use the rest of the filling. I will definitely make this again. I recommend you try this out.

OK, coming from a tried and true pumpkin lover, this was absolutely phenomenal!!! I agree, there was too much custard to fill all the puffs, but believe me, it didn't go to waste!!! Would absolutely make this 1000 times over!!

Made these for a new year's party and they turned out great. I made the following adjustments... Profiteroles: I used a pastry bag and piped out small ones since I wanted to make them one-two bites large. Custard: Doubled the allspice, ginger, and cinnamon. Tasted good, but I'd back off from doubling next time, maybe 1.5 and up the sugar just a tad Sauce: Because of the reviews I didn't attempt to mess with the maple sugar. Instead substituted for 1cup brown sugar, and 1/4cup REAL maple syrup. Worked well and taste was there. I also was very liberal with the bourbon. :) Make sure no water gets into the sauce other wise it will seize and the texture will be thrown off. Instead of cutting the profiteroles in half I poked the bottom with a chop stick and wiggled it around to break up the structure inside. I then used a decorating pastry bag and piped in the custard. Unlike the other reviews I only ended up with about 2 extra ounces of custard, I'm guessing it has to do with the fact I piped in the custard instead of cutting the profiterole and spooning the custard in. I also skipped the whipped cream because it seemed excessive and also skipped the nuts due to an allergy. I also doubled the batch of pate a choux and made a batch of pastry cream and made mini-cream puffs. O topped them with powdered sugar and mixed them with the caramel topped ones which made for a good presentation. The taste was great with the bland pate a choux and the sweet custard inside and the gooey caramel tied everything together to make a perfect bite size morsel.

Received phenomenal reviews! I followed the directions exactly, but after filling the 16 profiteroles I found I still had more than half of the custard left, so I just made another batch of profiteroles. Mmm... :-)

Amazing! If I were to do these again, I'd make half the amount of pumpkin custard. I made a full recipe doubling up on spices (necessary!) and it was way too much. I made 1 1/2 times the profiterole recipe and think I'd double it next time. I would also spoon slightly less than an egg-sized amount of dough as my puffs were too big. Use the maple sugar - the caramel is amazing!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious... the biggest hit to our Thanksgiving dinner. The maple caramel sauce makes the dish. After searching everywhere for maple sugar, we finally found it at Wegman's. $30 for a 25 oz container!!! My husband refused to buy it so I used the substitution mentioned by some reviewers: 1 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup maple syrup and 1/2 cup cream. It was watery so I just boiled it for an hour and put it in the fridge overnight- it thickened and was perfect. I also doubled the dough recipe as suggested by others and there was still custard left but we ate the custard the next day, out of the bowl like pudding. We found the spices to be perfect, not bland at all. Everyone raved about this dessert. It tastes better than pumpkin pie. I will definitely make it again.

Wonderfully impressive and very tasty. I would agree too much custard, although I have no other quibble with the custard. Next time, I'll make 8 large profiteroles and halve the custard. My caramel might have been a bit thin. How to make it thicker?

Great recipe, wonderful winter dessert. Didn't have access to maple sugar, used 1/2 real maple syrup with 1/2 brown sugar. Syrup was too liquidy and didn't have right texture or color. Remade plain caramel sauce. Rather than make 16 little profiteroles, made 8 large ones. Used up a little more custard, but still plenty left over.

Rating: 4
This reciped is delish. I would suggest doubling the dough as I had lots of custard and sauce, but nothing to put it on. I also think the custard could use some improvement and would add extra spice to it. Maple sugar is $$$! So I substituted dark brown molasses sugar and it turned out perfectly. I will be making this again, it got rave reviews at the party. It is like your own little personal pumpkin pie.

I printed this recipe a year ago and finally got around to making these. They are really delicious and were a big hit with everyone who tasted them. Like other reviewers, I made smaller profiteroles and ended up making a second batch. The profiteroles freeze wonderfully and thaw quickly. The second time I made them, I dumped all the dough into a 12" pastry bag (with no tip) and piped mounds of dough onto the sheets. Then with a wettened finger, gently smoothed the tops. It was so much faster (and less messy) than dropping them by hand, and they came out much better looking and more uniform. The caramel sauce is a real winner. These make a smashing presentation.

Rating: 2
The profiterole recipe was quick, easy and tasty. The caramel was oh-so-good with the brown sugar/maple syrup sub that was suggested (I will be using this as my caramel recipe from now on). As other reviewers have said, the custard is not worth your time. After being completely disappointed with how it turned out, I had to turn around and make a quick chocolate filling to feel okay about serving them. The chocolate/caramel combo turned out to be very tasty. I'm not sure what I did wrong with the custard, but it isn't worth my time to try it again to see where I went wrong.

Rating: 2
First, the profiterole recipe was easy to make and freeze. The pumpkin filling is way too full of fatty eggs, cream, etc to justify the bland taste. I think it would taste better if I just used a pumpkin pie filling recipe and baked according to the water bath here. This filling was super bland for all that it was. I did the brown sugar/maple syrup sub suggested a few pages back. I am sure it would taste much better with maple sugar, but at $9/ 8 oz. it wasn't worth it esp. after I tasted the filling. It was a lot of work for an okay dessert. I think I will try a custard filling substituting maple syrup for the sweetener instead. ... What really cracked me up was the suggestion to add whipped cream on top because 4 cups of it wasn't enough in the filling... never mind a total of 14 eggs and how much butter, total??? Has anyone tried lightening this up???

Rating: 4
overall, this recipe was amazing. i'm not sure where to find maple sugar, so i used a combination of maple syrup, splenda brown sugar blend and brown sugar. the caramel was a bit runny after reheating, but tasted fantastic anyway. next time i'll probably use a similar caramel that had better consistency from a southern living recipe. as for the custard, i halved the whipping cream and pumpkin but kept the spices the same per other reader reviews, and still had some left over after filling the profiteroles. i think the custard would taste great on it's own, too, maybe with a brulee topping. a superb new pumpkin recipe for fall!

Didn't like this recipe. The filling was too greasy and did not have enough flavor, especially considering how fattening this dessert is - it should have tasted better! The profiterole dough was good though, I might make them again with a different filling.

Wow! Wonderful dessert. Almost too pretty to eat. Having never made Profiteroles before, I beat the dough too much. And, even with the rolls being a little tough, I would give this 4 1/2 forks. I made the recipe with no substitutions, and it was perfect. Suggestion: double the dough recipe. Even though the custard is good enough to eat by itself, it does make quite a bit. Everyone raved at thanksgiving. Nice change from pumpkin pie.

A new Thanksgiving tradition!! I goofed and used part of a can of Libby's "pumpkin pie filling" rather than ordinary pumpkin (I had no idea they'd gone to the trouble of packaging a "filling" for pumpkin pie!). It turned out great! I ordinarily double pumpkin pie recipe spices, but I wanted to make this to a "t" the first time, so I played it straight. However, since the pumpkin pie filling was was already sweetened and spiced, it ended up being perfect (for my taste). The caramel could have been more "mapley", but I had to use maple syrup instead of the sugar...I'm sure it lost something in the translation and I could probably have boiled it down a bit more. I didn't use bourbon (kids were eating it, and I didn't think the alcohol would "burn off" enough as it does in other dishes where I use wine to deglaze, etc.), but the maple syrup took up the 1/4c of fluid that the bourbon would have contributed. A little fresh-whipped cinnamon whipped cream and they were talking about it for days :)

Oh my god, these were delicious. Very easy pastry recipe that came out perfectly. I thought the spice ratio in the custard was spot on and the maple bourbon caramel sauce was absolutely amazing. Other reviewers have mentioned finicky pastry and pale custard... I didn't have any such trouble. I had no previous experience with puff pastry and I (and the gourmands in my family) thought they were perfect. The custard took a little less than an hour in the oven to set, perhaps because i used a le creuset cast iron/ enamel dish instead of glass, but this worked marvelously. It cooked very evenly and the texture was deliciously smooth. I did end up with almost twice as much custard and sauce as I needed for the pastries, but I'm not really complaining. I found my friends sneaking spoonfuls of the custard from the kitchen, and I plan on drizzling the sauce on everything I eat for the next week from french toast to ice cream... maybe even a glaze for some salty pork or duck... who knows?? but $%*&, it's good.

I used the maple sugar substitute several pages back, but otherwise made this according to the recipe. Very easy since all the pieces are made ahead. I used my Tablespoon ice cream type scoop as suggested for the custard -- that was pretty! Everyone loved these as a nice change from pumpkin pie. Sauce was lovely, custard really quite good, little puffs easy to make and store.

This was pretty good. I thought the custard was a tad pale but after putting it inside the puff, I didn't even notice. The sauce is really excellent and would be great to serve over fresh apple pie and/or ice cream. I found the dough fussy during the baking process and will probably just use my own recipe for cream puff pastry.

Totally disappointing. After reading the reviews I had such high hopes! I followed the recipe to a T, and the custard came out completely bland and too heavy and didn't really add to the dish at all. The presentation of this is beautiful, and it looked like I went to a lot of trouble. I think that is really the only reason I got so many complements from my guests (although no one really raved). I'll still make this again only because its great to make in advance. I think next time I will try custard that is lighter (more similar to pumkin pie filling) and double the spices.

Great Thanksgiving dessert!! Everyone loved it! I used my own pate a choux recipe, which does require lengthy cooking time. The reason why your profiteroles may fall is because you did not dry them out. After 30 or so minutes, take them out of the oven, reduce temp to 325 and prick each puff with a toothpick. Bake for an additional 15 minutes. I always eat one to see if the insides are wet. I did easily find maple sugar at Whole Foods. I also cooked my caramel longer for a thicker consistency. I also did find that my custard was rather bland at first. I used extra spices, like cardamom. But as soon as I tasted the finished product the next day, I realized that the flavors did marry nicely! Also,I made every component to this recipe ahead of time, making this recipe sooooo easy!

This was such a HUGE hit this past thanksgiving. Everything came out beatifully. I added cinnamon flavored whipped cream and I think this really took the dessert to the next level. Also, for those that keep asking about replacing maple sugar with maple syrup, I would highly reccomend NOT doing this as maple syrup is a liquid and maple sugar is not (and for this particular recipe you need to the sugar to make the caramel sauce). I would suggest (although I have never tried this) using an regular sugar and mixing with a few tsp or a tablespoon of maple extract. This dessert is top notch . . .and the profiteroles freeze beautifully.

Excellent dessert! Thankfully, you can make everything ahead of time and put it together that day. It is time consuming, but simple enough for my 12 yr. old to make it all (with a little help). She did prefer the maple caramel without the bourbon. The recipe makes more than enough to leave some caramel plain for the kids and have bourbon caramel for the adults.

I am giving this a 4-fork for potential because it was a 3-forker on my first execution. I did not read far enough down in the reviews to see the maple syrup/brown sugar substitution (which I will try next time as I see no point in the effort/expense for the maple sugar) and came up with a less successful improvisation that was still pretty good. I did think the custard was going to be a bit creamier/fluffier than it turned out -- not sure if that was my error in expectation or execution. Mine was more like a light fluffy pumpkin pie but definitely not toward the pudding or mousse end of the scale as I pictured. Nonetheless, got raves all around and it is definitely a keeper.

THis is now my best from this site. Served for Thanksgiving and everyone loved these! Fun to make. Make all the pieces ahead of time for easy assembly at serving time.

Although this dessert required plenty of preparation time, the effects were worth it. OOs and Ahs accompanied the sinful bites of this decadence. In the future, I would make half of the pumpkin custard and double the caramel sauce--as it was truly outstanding. To find the maple sugar, I had to contact Parker's Maple Syrup Barn in NH but I also found supplies at King Arthur's catalogue.

A show stopper! My batch easily made 24 profiteroles and I had custard & sauce to spare. I used fresh pumpkin and as a result had to strain the custard, puree the strained bit & pour it back into the mix, but it was totally worth it! This type of recipe is what makes me come back to this site time & again. In a word....irresistible!

I was a little intimidated, but decided to make this dish. It was much easier than expected! The dough was no problem. The custard is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Sauce was easy. My guests loved it. I had much more filling than I needed - so next time I will make several batches of the dough cream puffs. A wonderful, exotic dessert to serve.

I brought this dish to a Thanksgiving dinner and watched the jaws drop in amazement when the profiteroles were assembled and served. They are a lovely dish - I loved the richness the bourbon added. The shells did cook too fast (I took them out about 5 minutes early) but I had no trouble with them falling. I found no maple sugar but found maple butter and let it cook down a bit. The sauce was a little thinner than I think it should have been but no one but me knew. Without the maple glaze, these would have been just "good" but with it, they were divine. Worth the work to create the sensation.

Made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone was very impressed, including me! I made the cream puffs and the custard on Sunday, the maple caramel on Monday, and assembled them Thursday morning, drizzled with the caramel right before serving. Worked great. I was a little concerned about the amount of spices in the custard, the pumpkin flavor didn't come through when I tasted it before cooking, but once it was cooked, the pumpkin and the spices married nicely. The changes I made: I scooped the cream puff dough with my mini ice cream scoop (1 TBS), so each cream puff was 1 large bite (baked for 30 minutes). Made about 3 dozen. I split the cream puffs and scooped 2 scoops (same ice cream scoop) into each cream puff, and wound up with almost half the custard left. I didn't have maple sugar, and didn't feel like going and buying it, so I just boiled down 1 c of maple syrup to caramel stage, added a little bit of butter and some cream. Since I was only drizzling with it, and not serving each guest a "pool" of it, the decreased amount was fine (it only made about 1/2 a cup). Really though, the maple caramel sauce made the whole dessert. We tasted the stuffed cream puffs while making them and they were good, but nothing spectacular... the addition of the caramel sauce made them fabulous. We will definitely be making this again. For those of you whose cream puffs fell, it is usually because they were undercooked. If they never rose, that's another problem alltogether.

Surprising how such an easy, advance preparation recipe could delight the masses! The combination of mapley goodness with crispy profiteroles and creamy pumpkin custard in a modest serving is, may I assert, even better than pumpkin pie. The days of soggy-crusted, leftover pie are gone. Your printer will be working overtime to accommodate the recipe requests. A new favourite to add to the repertoire. *Note*: Successfully stretched recipe from 16 to 20 profiteroles, just decreased bake time a smidge. Thanks for the maple sugar substitution, it worked a treat.

I have made this dessert twice now -excellent both times. Burned the profiteroles bottoms both times (didn't have parchment paper) but just cut the bottoms off. The first time I made it with just maple syrup - which was awesome. the 2nd time I made it with maple sugar, and preferred the maple taste I got when I used the syrup instead!! Not as time consuming as it seems, and such a suprising twist on pumpkin!!

I only made the profiteroles and had to take it out of the oven 10 minutes earlier. It was starting to brown (aka burn!) and didn't want to ruin them. Per comments from previous bakers, I did make them smaller but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time I won't but the egg wash on it because I don't think that added anything.

This dessert was very easy to make and what a presentation! The maple sugar was pretty hard to find as other reviewers had noted, and it IS expensive! I got mine for $10.00/lb. (vermont country store-on line, has the lowest shipping rates, too) Be careful to make sure your oven is running the correct temp. the first batch of cream puffs came out nearly black because mine ran too hot. I have a little oven thermometer I used and the next batch came out wonderfully. I made sure also that the maple sugar dissolved comlpletely before I added the remaining ingredients so that it was nice and smooth. I took them to a Christmas party and everyone loved them... I tried to get the dieters to eat some by saying "it's okay, pumpkin is a vegetable!" They split one. :))

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I think the cooking time for the profiteroles is too long- you can cut it down by at least 15 minutes. I did use maple sugar the first time but it is very expensive. You can substitute dark or even light brown sugar and it comes out pretty much the same. Overall a great dessert to impress friends and the flavor is fantastic too.

An added note regarding presentation; serve on dishes small enough to allow a pool of sauce around the bottom of the profiteroles. I grated fresh nutmeg atop the whipped cream and used candied pecans as well( go lightly on both; it's just for presentation). As for the maple sugar- I found mine in the bulk section of the local Co-op (I know not everyone is this blessed but just a heads-up).

We, too, loved this dessert, which I made for Thanksgiving. I made the profiteroles 2 days in advance and froze them (they defrosted beautifully, still moist), and I made the custard and caramel sauce (with the maple sugar; I had to ask for help to find it at Whole Foods because it doesn't come in the sort of package you'd expect) the evening before. One of the better desserts I've made (and I make a lot of desserts) and a great change from the usual Thanksgiving desserts, but with the sort of flavors you'd expect for the holiday.

Couldn't fine maple sugar in my area, so found a website that suggested substituting 1 cup light brown sugar and 1/4 cup pure maple syrup for the maple sugar, and to then cut another liquid in the recipe by 1/4 cup, so I cut the cream down to 1/2 cup.

I made these for a Thanksgiving bash at work...they couldn't get enough! I folded some sweetened whipped cream into the custard to give a lighter texture to the custard, and to sweeten it some, as this is definately not as sweet as your typical pumpkin pie. Will be adding this one as a new Thanksgiving "tradition".

Incredible!! It was one of those dishes that received a chorus of moans as the guests bit into their first bite. A beautiful presentation. I baked the custard the day before in a round 8" pirex. I also made the sauce the day before substituting good dark rum for the bourban. I made the profiteroles the day of; very easy. Watch as they bake but don't be fooled by the early browning, mine took about the entire required baking time. Too bad epicurious' rating system isn't displaying the scoring properly. These are truly wonderful.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was the hit of the day! Agree with the previous review.. I would make the profiteroles smaller otherwise follow the recipe and you too will have the best of deserts. I did make the rolls and froze them, took them out of freezer Thanksgiving morning and they were just perfect. You could also assemble the day before as the one profiterole that was left over was just as good as the day it was made.

Perfect combination of pumpkin and spice. It wasn't too sweet at all. The recipe was extremely easy, however, I would recommend making each piece a day ahead of time for easy preparation the day you're going to serve. I couldn't find maple sugar so just subsituted maple syrup and it was great. I would also recommend making much smaller profiteroles.

Yumm. The maple sugar is expansive but it is worth it. I skipped the bourbon and just added more vanilla. The profiteroles are delicious, did not puff out as much as I would hope. The ones that were smaller did though, so maybe keep them small? Cut the amount of cloves in half and it was just perfect for my taste. Will make again for sure.

Delicious and simple. I was scandalized at the expense of Maple Sugar in Texas (nearly eight dollars!) but felt vindicated because it was so delicious and made a TON. It's truly the high point of this dessert. The caramel did have a strong bourbon flavor, but it accented, not disguised the maple. I might replace 1/3 of the whipped cream with evaporated milk next time, but only to experiment.

A wonderful twist on the tradition of Pumpkin Pie. Profiterole "dough" (or choux paste)was very easy to make. Could not taste the maple flavor in the sauce at all, which was disappointing considering the effort my husband spent in obtaining it Will not use the Bourbon next time. Overall, a fairly easy and impressive dessert!

This was a great alternative to the usual Thanksgiving pumpkin pie. I got rave reviews! I agree with the reviewer who commented that it was easy to do ahead. I didn't have time to find the maple sugar so used plain sugar and substituted maple syrup for the bourbon which gave it a nice maple flavor. I baked the profiteroles in my convection oven and they came out great at the bake time indicated. I did leave the pumpkin custard in longer because the middle hadn't set. I'm thinking of repeating at Christmas.

A guest's daughter brought this for thanksgiving. She's a fairly new chef, and most of the guests were accomplished cooks and bakers. Rave reviews, and the maple sugar makes a fantastic sauce which would also be a keeper for other desserts. Easy and fabulous. She was justifiably proud.

i made this with brown sugar and a teaspoon of maple syrup for flavor. it was delcious. but since it is the sauce that really makes this dish, next time i will try to find maple sugar. very easy to make in advance and refrigerate as the recipe recommends.

Was not sure I wanted to pay big bucks for the maple sugar, but am not one to stray from recipes. Turns out it was well worth the price!! The sauce makes the dish. Thought the baking time for the profiteroles was too much, next time will reduce. All in all, I found this dessert incredible. Not too much trouble, but quite impressive! Much better than pumpkin pie.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, it was a hit! The profiteroles were easy to make, and the custard was delicious. For the caramel sauce, I used brown sugar instead of maple sugar, and it tasted good (perhaps a bit heavy on the bourbon) but was a bit thinner than I would have liked. I might try a different sauce next time I make this dessert.

I made this today for a pre-Thanksgiving luncheon, and it was outstanding. My kids even liked it (with plain caramel). Highly recommended.

So far I've only made the profiteroles. I want to mention that the baking time seems w-a-y too long. I cut the time by 20 min. and my profiteroles were just right. Has anyone else had this problem?

Delicious! I found maple sugar (dry, not a syrup) at Whole Foods. The profiteroles are easy to make, so I recommend baking them the same day they are to be used. The custard sets up more as it cools, so don't leave it in past the 1h 15m. A fun twist on pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving!

Maple sugar is not the same as maple syrup. It is maple syrup that has been reduced and the sugar has crystalized. It's dry, like sugar.

maple sugar is distilled from the sap of maple trees. You may be more familiar with its more common form, maple syrup.
