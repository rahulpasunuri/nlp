Very good alternative when you are tired of the same old....it was easy to make and you can add/change to your liking.

The 3 forks is for the dressing otherwise the salad (romaine) is pretty boring. The dressing is quick, easy and has great flavor. You could add a squirt of anchovy paste (to the dressing) to spark it up a notch. I added croutons to the salad. Shaved parmesan would also be a nice touvh.

Good new dressing to add to the files. Tastes different from your average balsamic or whatever dressing you usually make at home. The worcestershire really makes the dressing. Definitely worth trying!

I made this a few nights ago and we just loved it. Tonight my husband asked me to make it again. Easy and delicious!

Many people do not tolerate Ceasar very well---this gives you all the good flavor without the indigestion. I also added parmesan crips.

We thought this was a nice light alternative to Caesar.

Delicious! Definitely improves with standing a couple of hours before use.

My husband & I liked this simple vinegarette over romaine. We halved the recipe for the two of us, and served additional grated parmesan at the table. We'll store this recipe away for future uses.

My family loved this recipe! I doubled it for a large dinner party. It was the hit of the party. I also served it with parmesan crisps. The kids even couldn't get enough. I will definitely file this in my "keeper" file.

This is the laziest excuse for a Caesar style salad I've ever seen. I've made a better dressing by adding a tablespoon of anchovy paste to Newman's Own Caesar dressing. Not worth the time to make.
