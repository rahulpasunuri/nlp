I agree with many of the other reviews, the bacon did not all cook thoroughly and I should have squeezed some lemon over it to make more lemon-y. But we still enjoyed them, and with a few tweaks this could be an awesome recipe.

I added cauliflower to brussel sprouts and then followed recipe exactly. To make bacon crisp, I think it may be important to make sure that bacon is in contact with bottom of pan. It was outstanding. Everyone in our family loved it!

Loved this. I had a hard time getting the bacon to crisp too, so I moved it from a glass pan to a metal sheet and it was perfect within 5 minutes. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of these sprouts. Will absolutely make them again, might toss in some capers or butternut squash, too.

I agree with simpitt from LA... big waste of time. The bacon never crisped and the lemons were... were... flavorless by the time they were done.

Big waste of time. I love brussel sprouts, but this recipe really adds nothing. How about just steaming brussel sprouts, and if you want to add flavors, toss in what you want after they are steamed? I found these sprouts to be dry and flavorless; the bacon does NOT cook properly in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes. AND they cool off too soon. My advice: look elsewhere if you are trying to make your sprouts something unusual!

I used turkey bacon which I chopped up and sauteed in olive oil while the brussel sprouts were boiling- the result was delicious and a little healthier than the original.

I got a little carried away with a holiday theme when making this recipe, but it turned out great. I added slivered almonds to a bit of the bacon drippings, and toasted them lightly. Then I added a bad of cranberries that was in my fridge, then tossed all of that with the b'sprouts. Roasted in a 400 oven for 45 min. or so, tossing often, added some sea salt and pepper. It's very tasty and ever-so-lovely. I had no idea that the c'berries and b'sprouts would taste so good together, but they caramelize a bit and are excellent with the bacon flavor to bind them.

This recipe is simple and delicious. It turned out great, and it will be a regular at our house. I added a sprinkle of dried thyme (fresh would be good, too), and it was fantastic over garlic mashed potatoes.

This dish was SO gross. Based on the other reviews here I think perhaps I did something wrong, but the lemon made the whole thing taste weird. Luckily there was a vegetarian in my group so I made 1/2 my brussel sprouts this way and the other 1/2 another way, which everyone ate. This dish was barely touched. If I could give it negative one fork, I would. blech.

I cooked the bacon separately to make sure it was crispy, and used preserved lemon instead of fresh.

Made this last night with pretzel crusted pork chops and it was excellent. One mistake that I made was using a ceramic casserole dish instead of a metal roasting pan. The bacon never crisped up as I would have liked it to, but the flavor was still there. I will definitely make this recipe again!

This recipe was outstanding. I didn't have lemons so just used some lemon juice instead. It was delightful. My 13-year-old son said, "Mom, I think I like brussel sprouts now..."

I also pan roasted vs. oven roasted....delicious results. Browned the bacon while the sprouts were in the boiler water. Removed the bacon pieces, then added the sprouts into the grease with lemons, salt and pepper. When the veg was done, I added back the bacon (roughly diced) tossed everything to make sure it was all mixed and covered and served. I thought it was a little under-seasoned and added salt at the table--maybe it depends on how salty the bacon is to start.

Can't rate this, because I didn't make it as written. Instead of parboiling and roasting for such a long time (how do they not get overcooked?), I pan-browned the sprouts in the bacon grease after frying (and removing) a few slices of bacon. Let the sprouts cook over med-high for about 5 minutes, cut side down, then toss and stir for a minute or two, adding back the chopped bacon. Finish w/ a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and pepper before serving.

This was the favorite part of our dinner tonight, among several who said things like, "I thought I didn't like brussels sprouts!" I cooked this in a skillet with the raw bacon on the bottom, brussels sprouts on top, and then sprinkled with lemon juice.

tasty and simple. make sure to slice the lemon very thin. Otherwise, the rind and pith don't break down enough and taste bitter.

I've prepared this dish several times and everyone loves it--even those who profess not to like Brussels Sprouts! I partially cook the bacon so that it is crisp in the thirty minute time limit. Try substituting pancetta in this recipe, wonderful...

You can't put the bacon on the sprouts raw, sprouts are done and bacon still rubbery at the end of the cooking time. I'll try par cooking the bacon next time with the sprouts as suggested. Lemon slices a nice touch and provide the right amount of flavor.

Based on other comments about bitter lemons and overcooked bacon, I experimented. I parboiled the bacon pieces in the same water while boiling the sprouts. The bacon crisped-up perfectly when roasted. For the lemon, I bought the smallest I could find. I quartered the lemon lengthwise. My slices were as thin as I could easily cut with a very sharp knife - but not paper thin. They cooked perfectly, though I think a Meyers lemon might be better with less pith beneath the skin. Overall, this recipe was a breeze and very tasty. Perhaps because I parboiled the bacon, I thought the dish required more salt than one might imagine.

Ok....I've made this recipe using two different methods now and both yield different results, but great flavors. The first time I made this dish, I blanched the sprouts, sliced and sauted raw bacon, fresh mushrooms, and the sprouts in a large, uncovered, flat pan, omitting the lemon till the end, and everything cooked in bacon fat. This allowed the sprouts to remain more intact and brighter in color. Plus, it is faster. It turned out great. Then I made it per orig. recipe and had to roast 50+ min. at 450+ degrees to get the bacon even close to being crispy enough. Consequently, with all the turning of the dish during the roasting process, the sprouts are roasted perhaps too much and fell apart more easily. Both times though, I squeezed lemon juice over dish right after cooking so the lemon is fresher tasting. Overall, I prefer the saute method in appearance and taste, but both methods will result in a really tasty dish that many will love. Next time, I'm going to try semi-cooking the bacon first, then adding it to the sprouts once it has shriveled a bit so the sprouts don't get overcooked. The mushrooms gave some really great flavor also.

Great recipe. Because we keep a kosher home, we substituted these great dried turkey sausages (diced) for the bacon, and it was great. Our guests all loved the lemon zing contrasted with the saltiness of the sausages.

I am making this for the second time tonight. It is so good and I didn't even know I liked brussel sprouts before this recipe. Bacon makes everything better.

I made this for Thanksgiving and will make it again with grilled turkey for New Year's day. I used a Meyer lemon. We all loved it.

Really good and really easy. I would consider using orange instead of lemon so it's not quite as tart.

This recipe was easy and delicious! Crispy bacon, tender sprouts with just a hint of lemon. After the left overs cooled I made a salad by adding chopped walnuts and dried cranberries... WOW was it tasty!

Easy and quite good. I thought the lemon was perfect to cut through the cabbage-y taste of brussel spouts. I'm not a sprout lover, but will definitely make this again.

Don't let the previous recipes throw you off. I used RAW bacon, a squeeze of lemon (just juice -- my lemon had already been zested) and it turned out great. Perfectly done bacon, cripsy-on-the-outside, done-on-the-inside sprouts. Great.

i love brussel sprouts, I love bacon and I love lemons but this recipe turned out to be a disaster. I have the same question as another reviewer - is the bacon supposed to be raw or cooked?? I cooked the bacon perfectly but when added to the brussel sprouts, then put in the oven, it burned and added a horrible bitter flavour. The lemon just added another element of bitterness and this Brussel Sprout recipe turned out to be a disaster! Good luck trying to perfect this one!!

Wonderful fresh flavor!

Is the bacon supposed to be pre-cooked, prior to adding to the Brussels sprouts? My diced RAW bacon did not get thoroughly cooked after 30 minutes at 400 degrees. I had to separate the bacon out and put it under the broiler. Feedback?

I used pancetta instead of bacon, and also included cauliflower and golden turnips as I only had .5 lb of brussels sprouts. It was delicious. Use a meyer lemon if you can find one, and you won't have any problem with bitterness.

Would make this again, since even my 3 year old ate it (but then, she begs bits of raw cauliflower when I'm cooking), but I agree that the lemon rind was too bitter and did not blend in well to the dish. It was also somewhat tough, though I sliced it with the 2mm Cuisinart blade. Added julienned red bell pepper, and that was nice for flavor and color.

I liked the dish but didn't like the bitter finish from the pith of the lemon peel. I followed the recipe to the letter. I will try it again but I may just sprinkle lemon juice over the vegetables a short time before they come out of the oven.

This was EXCELLENT, and the best recipe I've ever found for Brussels sprouts! Sooo easy too. Sprayed the pan with just a bit of Pam, and the sprouts turned out brown and beautiful, and the lemons were yummy chewy... crisp bacon... what more could you want?? This is a KEEPER!
