I really liked the cardamom flavor in this pie and thought it was delicious. It was just the right amount of sweetness - not too much sugar to be overly sweet. Some of my crust did sink into the pie, but I think the areas that stayed put were where I had laid the outside pieces resting on the rim.

Awesome. As others have suggested, definitely double the cardamom.

I just made this pie for the second time. It is amazingly easy and comes out perfectly. Instead of cardamon, I used 1/4 teasp of ginger and a bit of nutmeg and it was perfect. I made the dough in the processor the night before in about 2 minutes, and the next day, left it out for an hour, and it rolled perfectly and used heart shaped cookie cutters. Once the peach filling was done, it was easy to put the cutouts on top, and then sprinkle with the egg and sparkling sugar. I served with whipped cream but vanilla ice cream would work well. I don't know why anyone would have trouble making this recipe!

To add to my previous review: Last week we had a peach pie contest at work and I used this filling recipe with my regular crust. Guess who won?

I loved this pie. The changes that I made was doubling the cardamom and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I made a cobbler crust instead of the recipe crust and was very happy with the results. Everyone that tasted it loved it as well.

I made this with a regular top and bottom crust and it was absolutely delicious. Used tapioca instead of cornstarch in the filling, which made for a great texture. Everyone at work loved it.

Parts of my crust fellin as well but I don't think it affected the overall dessert. I doubled the cardamom and added about 1/2 tsp each of fresh nutmeg and cinnamon. I didn't use the yogurt but it tasted good without it.

I recommend Greek Gods Honey Yogurt. It's delicious & not too smacky-tangy like other greek yogurt.

Made it with frozen pie crusts (thawed of course). Did not make special shapes just bottom and top crusts. Delicious pie!

My crust melted into the pie too, so weird. The flavor was great. Tried again with leftover crust and same thing happened.

Fabulous with nectarines. Used a dash of vodka for additional moisture to make crust dough hold together. Bought fresh bottle of ground cardamon and used twice as much as recipe called for. Raw sugar a must to finish crust.

Can't imagine what I did wrong - checked ingredients twice - my crust (which I did make - cookie cutters and all) melted into the pie! Any suggestions? The flavor was great!

Absolute snap to make - and is a great crowd pleaser. I only did it as a pie once, and found it easier and more attractive to instead divide the fruit into ramekins, and use a smaller cutter to create the crust on each.

Very easy to make! I didn't have a cookie cutter nor the time to make the home made pie crust, so I used frozen store bought crust, rolled it out and used a pizza cutter to cut the crust into squares. Yum!

Made this last night for some friends. It was easy, wonderful and so tasty. I didn't do the yogourt, instead I served it with vanilla ice cream. I will definitely make this again, and again.

Tasty, rather rustic. Company worthy. Easy to make. The accompanying Honey Yogurt was wonderful. The yogurt recipe is not included in this online version but it's easy: Stir 3 Tbsp honey and 1/4 tsp orange flower water into a 16 - 17 oz. carton of Greek yogurt.
