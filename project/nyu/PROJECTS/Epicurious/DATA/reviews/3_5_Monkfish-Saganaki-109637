I forgot the chiles and used Basa, and it was still excellent!

We used onions instead of scallions and skipped the fennel altogether and it was fantastic! Served with rice and broccoli. A very delicious and nice light meal.

Delicious recipe, and so quick and easy to make. I doubled everything except for the fish, and served it with garlic mashed potatoes to soak up the creamy sauce. The local store didn't have monkfish or sea bass, so I used shark instead, which worked great. This is a very tasty date night dish that is sure to impress.

Fabulous recipe - make sure you include the whole chile for the right amount of kick. Also, - crucial - ignore the instructions for cooking the fish. Monkfish is buttery (like Chilean sea bass) and too delicious to be cooked in liquid. Broil it until lightly brown and crispy on top, sprinkle with lemon and then drizzle a small amount of sauce over the fish, but serve most of it on the side, as it can be overwhelming. Also, add the wine slowly to the sauce - I think the recipe calls for a bit too much, which can cause things to separate. Serve with a white burgundy or a peppery California chardonnay - you will need a strong white to stand up to spice and to cleanse your palate after the buttery meat.

I would double the vegetables, definitely double the feta and serve with feta on the table. Next time, I will add garlic and possibly oregeno. Hopefully that is not changing the intent of this recipe too much. Also, I struggled over what to serve it with - I chose orzo, but think it would be equally good served over fresh baby spinach (the heat from the veggies will "cook" the spinach enough)

This dish was just bland and unimpressive. I was disappointed.

this dish was easy and delicious. i haven't been able to get monkfish, but have used both cod and halibut cheeks with success. i made the mistake of using reduced fat feta cheese with the cod and the sauce was just not creamy enough. so, the second time around, i used regular feta and it was incredible.

Quick, easy and delicious. Looks impressive too!

I was a bit skeptical about the whole fish and cheese thing, but decided to try it. Unfortunately I couldn't find monkfish at the grocery store, so had to do it with cod. Still, it was really very tasty. I likely would try a different fish next time, but it was so easy, and really surprisingly tasty, so there will be a next time.

I made this on a Sunday night and it was so quick and absolutely delicious! I did not find chile peppers, so I added a dash of paprika and cayenne pepper, which gave the broth a nice coloring. I also sliced some baguette to dip in the sauce. I plan to add more feta next time for a creamier consistency.

I made this for my husband and I and it was great. I used the full recipe of sauce for 2 which was a little too much but better than half. I served this with Provencal Tomato Potato Gratin from the same issue.

Very delicate recipe although I changed a few things. I couldn't find any monkfish so I used bergylt instead, which also has firm flesh. And I substituted Retsina wine for the Chardonnay to give it an extra Greek twist. Next time I will use some more feta to create a richer sauce. And I was thinking of substituting Chinese five-spice powder for the fennel in case there isn't any.

I followed the spirit of the recipe rather than the letter - bronze fennel for fennel bulb, onion for scallions, fresh stock for wine. Nevertheless it was delicious. Monkfish has a rich flavour and firm, almost chewy texture which it would be a shame to spoil by over-flavouring or overcooking. This nicely supports the fish rather than overpowers it.

This was very good, sauce is tasty (confess, I did add a tad more feta) Its very easy to make.

This was excellent! We followed recipe exactly. Only comment for improvement would be to saute the fennel for a few minutes by itself, and then later add the chiles and scallions. Served with garlicy steamed spinach and thin slices of andouille sausgage on the side. Might also be good with some orzo on the side to soak up some of the sauce.
