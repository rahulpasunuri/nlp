Great depth of flavor. I also pureed the squash and some of the carrots because I don't care for the texture of squash. I have also made it with and without the beans. Though the beans make a heartier soup, the flavor isn't lost without them.

Delicious, but a bit time consuming (not difficult though!) If I could find someone to make this for me, I would eat it once a week.

Really excellent. The roasting gives the soup great flavor. A meal in a bowl. And vegetarian besides!

Loved this soup the first time I made it-- I added cayenne pepper and accidentally pureed the carrots & squash with the tomatoes & onions. That was the most delicious part & gave it such depth. The second time I made it I left out the cayenne, which is why I only gave it 3 stars.

A good friend of mine made this last night for a large pot-luck and it was AWESOME!!! I am not a great fan of any bean/veggie soup and this one was SO enjoyable and savory, I ate 2 servings! My entire family loved it & I hope to make it in the next day or two! LOVE IT!!!

This was fantastic! I used red chard instead of kale and chopped the squash prior to roasting. I only had dried thyme so used about 1/2 teaspoon of that and added a dash of dried red pepper.I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes since the fresh ones were not looking great. Super easy and tasty!

This was a great soup! I actually made it for Easter dinner and all of my veggie guests were very pleased with the hearty vegetarian option. I decided to write this review (my first!) because I was unable to find butternut squash or kale at my grocer. I substituted sweet potato and chard and it turned out just fine :) I will definitely make this soup again!

This soup was amazing! Super hearty and really tasty. Pureeing the roasted onions gave it a great base. I can't believe how good it turned out. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable. Will totally make again!

Great flavor! I like the suggestions for using fire-roasted canned tomatoes for ease, though I feel like the flavor might be somewhat compromised. I also like the idea of pre-dicing the squash. Hate zucchini, though, so would never sub that. Gross! I did add a shot of hot pepper sauce, as well as a healthy pinch of red pepper flakes. Would def make this again!!

Flavor needed brightening - added 2 tsp kosher salt and about 2-3T lemon juice. Not crazy about the carrots - sub zucchini? Used 2 cans cannellini beans and 2 cans petite diced tomatoes - it's January - no good tomatoes to be found!

One of the best recipes Ive tried and so healthy on top of it. I added more garlic as I always do but I pretty much stuck to the recipe. Oh, I needed more olive oil on my vegies as they roasted....seriously one of my all time fovorites...go figure, its healthy.

Rating: 4
This soup is incredible! After making it I realized that I'd made it in 2000 when it was first published. This time it was really, really delicious and I think the difference is I peeled and cubed the squash before roasting, used fire roasted diced canned tomatoes with adobo seasoning (no need to roast) and organic vegetable broth, I thinly sliced the kale like a chiffonade of basil and popped it in the oven to wilt with a drizzle of olive oil, salt and cracked pepper. That really made a difference for me because depending on the variety of kale it can be like a rubber bathmat!! Husband was moaning while devouring it!!

Very good. I used baby carrots and pre-cut squash to save time, and I subbed in cherry tomatoes since that's what I had. And I used about 8 cups broth/water. Was delicious the next day also--it makes a LOT!

I loved this soup. It was hearty and filling with great flavor and completely guilt-free. I did need a good amount of extra broth though -- it reduced a lot during the cooking time with the kale. I'll definitely be making this again.

What a delicious and beautiful soup! Didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used a can of diced, drained them then sauteed the solids to get that roasted flavor and added the juice with the broth. I added some spicy Italian sausage and that really put it over the top! The orange of the veggies with the beautiful green of the kale makes this soup as lovely as it is delicious. This one is definitely a winner!! Perfect for a cold winter night.

Loved this soup! I used extra squash and roasted the wedges until they were a dark golden brown. They are extra flavorful this way and hold their shape better. I added some cayenne pepper for some zing, and finished it with shredded parmesan. Very healthy and satisfying!

my meat-eater partner loved this soup. i used a whole kabocha squash, halved and then each half cut into thirds, about 3 fresh carrots, 4 small kohlrabi bulbs, one onion cut up in wedges. roasted a whole bulb of garlic to the side for same amount of time and just squeezed the garlic out into the broth. roasted 8- 10 serrano chilies separately for about 10 mins, chopped and added to broth. used diced canned tomatoes with jalapenos in place of the fresh tomatoes, and used my immersion blender rather than food processor. i didn't even have to use broth (just used water) or add salt as the chilies gave so much flavor. as another reviewer recommended, i used a kale chiffonade rather than chopped it, and was pleased with the results.

Rating: 3
I had my doubts about this soup all through the cooking process, but once all the ingredients came together at the end (and sat overnight), I thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't care for cooked carrots, so I left those out, and in retrospect I should've added more butternut squash (which was delicious roasted). I also found the base to taste a bit "muddy," so I added about 3 oz. of tomato paste, which brightened it up a bit. I like a little kick, so I also added cayenne and crushed red pepper, and lots of freshly ground black pepper and sea salt. It's definitely a "winter" soup, which is ideally made on a cold winter day when you've got nothing else to do but cook and eat.

Rating: 4
I often add sweet Italian sausage to this soup (a la tuscan white bean and kale soup). The soup is equally great with and without the sausage, but becomes a full meal with the addition of sausage and crusty bread.

This was yummy. I also used Better Than Bouillion vegetable base (which I had not used before but followed the advice of another reviewer). Otherwise I followed the recipe as written (except for leaving out the thyme which I didn't miss). My 10 year old son even liked it, saying "hey, I like kale."

This is a great winter soup! I substituted sweet potato for the carrot, cannellini for the beans, and a can of tomatoes (including their juice). Roasting the veg makes this soup tastier than similar recipes I've experimented with.

Made as directed with good quality vegetable broth (Better Than Bouillon). A pretty fall soup. The cubes of squash and carrots contrast nicely with the white beans and broth. Tastes good, but noone really cared for this.

I did not have any beans or butternut squash on hand so instead I added sweet potatoes and new potatoes. Pureeing the onions, garlic and tomatoes is a must they really added a nice thickness to the soup. I made the soup a day ahead and it really added to it the extra time it sat to let everything blend. We will be making it again soon. Great soup for cold winter nights.

Rating: 4
Outstanding. Rich, flavorful, versatile. I also made a brown rice medley, and after trying a little mixed with the soup, added about 1/2 cup of the rice to each bowl of soup. I used one 32 oz carton of veg broth, and 2 cups of water with about 2 tsp of chicken base for flavor. Next time, I will use an immersion blender for the puree, instead of the food processor or regular blender.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I was looking for something to do with some vegies, primarily the butternut squash, I got from our CSA. I was looking for something other than the usual roasted butternut squash bisque type, and this was the perfect recipe. I used rainbow swiss chard instead of kale. Roasting the vegies is the way to go, it gives the soup such a rich flavor.

This is a great recipe that can stand up to a lot of variations. Used pork stock and added leftover roast pork, didn't have beans, and used sweet potato instead of squash. Also, added some aleppo peppers for a touch of heat. The roasting for the base is key.

This was perfect. Even my vegetable-hating husband(who hates beans and greens) loved it. I replaced the kale with swiss chard because the stores near me do not carry kale. I reduced the time that the greens cooked in the soup as a result, but I let it sit together on the stove for many hours so it blended well anyway. Wouldn't change a thing.

I pride myself on eating anything and everything, so I hate to admit that I sometimes do not like roasted vegetables. I was not a huge fan of this soup, but I can see why most other people liked it. Some people complained that it was time-consuming, but it really wasn't active time. It came together easily after the veggies were roasted. And I like the trick of just throwing in the thyme instead of picking off those pesky leaves.

This was SO good! Added parsnips (because I had them) and sauted pork sausage out of their casings (because I'm not a vegetarian) and it was amazing! Used chicken stock also, since I had it.

OK soup. The roasted vegs were a nice addition, but the overall impression was that there was something missing. I may have used too much kale...it was alot of work for a soup I had little interest in. Gave three forks b/c I can see how it could be appreciated, but not by me.

I seem to be the odd woman out here, but for the amount of time this soup took to make, it wasn't worth it for me. Start to finish, it took me 2 hours to prepare. It was good, but 2 hours worth of work good? I didn't think so.

I used the vegetable stock recipe on epi for the stock. I thought it was really great. I would only change one thing...I would process the kale a little bit, or just chop it finer. It was a bit overwhelming in mine. I found myself eating around much of it. I am making this again for Thanksgiving. Double it.

Rating: 4
This soup is fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly and froze the entire batch. Each time I take a serving out of the freezer I am reminded how tasty this soup is! The roasting gives the soup such depth. The only change- roast the tomatoes on a separate pan - all their juices made it hard for the rest of the veggies to get that nice browning you want from roasting. A+++ Soup!!!

Rating: 3
got the organic box delivered to the door with lots of kale and squash. kale usually sits around a week in the fridge till it rots and i can throw it aways with a tiny bit less guilt. what to do? this recipe pretty much covered the box and was good. hid the squash a bit and my husband ate without complaint. no need to do the "scrape down the bits deal." save yourself the time and use foil on the pan, pull it up when done and throw it away. a good fall soupie stew and a great use for the organic box.

Rating: 3
Both my husband and I thought this soup was wonderful. I also had to replace the butternut squash with an acorn squash (our store didn't have any). Except for the squash, I pretty much followed the recipe exactly. This recipe makes enough for about 3 average eaters so you may want to double it.

Rating: 4
Truly a great soup recipe. I didn't have tomatoes, so I used a can of organic fire roasted tomatoes from Trader Joe's, which worked very well. I also added bay leaf and thyme to the vegetables as I roasted them to help infuse the flavor even further. I used half chicken stock, half vegetable stock because I had some homemade chicken stock on hand but not enough. I think I'd do one or the other next time. But really great.

This tecipe was a surprise to me! I loved it-- loved how healthy and nutritious it is. I didn't read the recipe all the way through before making it, so I was surprised that it wasn't a pureed soup, but that the squash remains in chunks. Yum. I LOVED the roasted flavor of the veggies.

i'm pregnant and looking for different ways to eat kale and squash, so this recipe was just perfect. this soup was a little time consuming because i made stock from scratch, but overall it was worth it. the recipe said finely chopped kale, so i put it in the food processor but my soup doesn't look like the picture. it still tastes great, but i think they did more of a chiffonade with the kale.

This soup tasted better the next day. Last weekend I made this and the escarole with garbanzo bean soup. This one took much more time, yet I prefered the escarole soup, which was far simpler and quicker to make. If you don't mind the extra time spent on preparing soup, the barley and roasted vegetable soup (also on this site) is much tastier and about the same amount of work.

Rating: 3
I made 2 other soups for guests, and added this one because I had the ingredients. This turned out to be the runaway winner (although White Bean and Chicken Chili is awesome). Excellent flavor, maybe because I roasted the heck out of the vegetables. I'm willing to peel another danged squash just to have it again.

I make a pot of vegetable soup once a week to use up whatever vegetables I have left over from other dishes. But I make it mainly because my husband has high cholestrol. I searched this site for some ideas on vegetable dishes. My husband loves kale and squash. So when I saw this recipe I just have to make it that day even though we didn't eat it until the next day (soup tastes better the next day anyway). I agree with the other readers that my house smelled wonderful with the garlic roasting in the oven. This recipe is a definite keeper!! The extra step to roast the vegetables was well worth the effort. I did add zucchini because it was one of the left over vegetables I had. I do like to follow the original recipe so I can judge it fairly. Now I have the other half of the squash. I guess I could make another batch!!! For those who likes alot of spice, I do recommend adding more seasoning to give it a little kick since this was a little flat. My husband usually add hot sauce to my soups anyway since I don't make spicy foods for my children.

Rating: 3
This soup took more time to prepare that I would like. I thought it tasted a lot like simple Minestrone soup, nothing very spectacular. My husband thought the soup was average. I had actually made 3 of the recipes from Epicurious last night & added some of the broth from the "WHITE BEANS WITH SAGE AND OLIVE OIL" recipe into this soup. THis gave it a little kick. Next time, I would add some potatoes to make it a little thicker. I brought the soup w/me for lunch and it tasted better the next day.

Well, I have way too much time on my hands. I made the vegetable stock from scratch where I roasted the vegetables for it first. Nothing like the smell of roasting mushrooms. I used the whole squash and added sweet Italian sasuage. The neighbors came over and asked what I was cooking. Yum!

Outstanding!! Made this soup to enjoy as blizzard conditions raged outside. It could not have been a better choice under the circumstances. Roasted veggies filled the house with a delicious aroma as the snow swirled outside. Substituted escarole for the kale, since that was what we had on hand and we weren't about to run to the market under the circumstances. The end result was a huge hit and prompted an unsolicited A+ comment from my husband. We'll look forward to having the leftovers warmed up when we come in from shoveling all that snow!!

I don't usually give 4 forks, but this recipe deserves it! I used 4 or 5 tomatoes, 5 big carrots, a whole squash, a whole head of garlic, more broth than called for (about 8 c.) and 30 oz. of beans. I didn't find it bitter last night and I can't wait to eat it today.

Super soup! Followed the advice of several reviewers and made it the night before I served it so it could sit overnight & added a whole head of roasted garlic, 2 C of beans, a little marjoram, thyme, crushed red pepper and a splash of tabasco. My husband loved it! We had people stop by while the veggies were roasting and the aroma was so incredible I had to give my copy of the recipe out before they left. Also, we only put about half in the blender and left half as big chunks of veggies, more like a stew. Actually just finished the leftovers tonight with a big salad and crusty bread.

This is a soup that definately benefits from some resting time after being completely assembled. It was initially bitter tasting, probably as a result of the cooked kale, but by the next day was actually almost sweet in flavor once the roasted squash, onions and carrots had a chance to release their sugars. I had thrown this recipe out, as a result of the bitterness of the first tastes and then had to retreive the recipe the next day!

It's been really cold the last few days (by Northern California standards, anyway!), and this soup was perfect. Took the suggestion of adding cooked pasta, which made this a great main course. I pre-cooked 1 cup of small shell pasta and added it at the end, with the squash and carrots. The veggies took a while to prep, but now that I've done it once, the next time should be faster. I will DEFINITELY make this again.

Delicious and satisfying. I added one whole head of roasted garlic, marjoram, extra thyme, a dash of crused red peppers and tobasco. I did not puree the vegetable. The sweetness of the squash contrasted nicely with the little bit of heat fromm the crushed red peppers. A new favorite!!

Stacy Schmetterer ( swindlei@aol.com ) from New York City on 10/16/01 A fabulous start to Autumn cooking. Delicious and hearty, this "soup" uses the best of the farms fall produce. I substituted low sodium chicken broth for the vegetable broth. Then i added 1" cut pieces of sweet Italian turkey sausage (or any Italian sausage would do if you're not watching those calories)to the initial 30 minute simmer. It transformed the "soup" into one even more hearty and fabulous, keeping it healthy and low fat. If you're not watching the starches, I would add a small pasta--Ditalini. Cooking it seperatly and adding it at the end would be best so the pasta does not absorb the soup liquid. With a loaf of crusty bread and a glass of red wine, all that is missing is the roaring fireplace!

This was a great Sunday night supper, perfect with some garlic bread and a simple salad. Roasting the vegetables gave it a very mellow flavor. I used acorn squash, which was a a bit tiresome to prepare, but it added a sweet,nutty edge. I also cooked up some chopped pancetta and sprinkled it over the soup as a garnish. If you have time to plan ahead, you can roast the vegetables the day before.

Soup sound delicious and I will make it in the future. This is to COOK FROM OLYMPIA, WA. Gently tossing vegetables in a plastic bag with oil to coat is a GREAT idea. THANK YOU!

found this soup too sweet, although the flavour was good it wasn't to my taste.

This is a good recipe, however, I found that the vegetables are not distinguishable in the soup at all. I added between 1/8 and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper about 5 minutes before it was done and it made a big difference. Also, this tastes much much better the second day when the flavors have had a chance to blend.

It's a fantastic flavorful soup and didn't need any additional seasonings. Chop the kale into very small pieces.

Nice mellow flavored soup. Very healthy. The whold family from 3yrs old to 30 something liked it. Not very filling, however. Before roasting, I put all the vegetables in a plastic bag with some olive oil and gently tossed them. This coats the vegetables very well. This soup would be good with pumpkin bread.

This is a delicious soup. We added hot italian sausage which gave it some kick but it would have been good without it too.

Yum! Loved this soup! Delicious and healthy. Shared it with friends at work and they loved it too.

In over ten years of making different types of vegetable soups, this is one of the best! My husband who is a meat man loved it, too. The wintery ingredients create a warming effect on those chilly nights. Do yourself a favor!

I used fresh tomatoes, but don't know why a good canned tomato wouldn't do. Used Chard instead of Kale and acorn squash instead of butternut. Also added raw tiger shrimp at the end with the carrots and squash. Very good and very easy. Have added this to my recipe file.

I made this dish last night for dinner. Yummy! And the extra calcium is a plus for us ladies! I served it with "Angel Biscuits." Since my new husband was 3 hours late for dinner, (had to work over-time) and this was very easy to re-heat. I'd never eaten Kale before (thought it was a garnish only!) It was good. Sort of like a bland spinach. I don't like winter squashes, so I substituted zuchinni instead. Next time I'll use black beans instead. Since we love soup at our house, this is a keeper for us.

I'll admit I haven't yet tried this recipe. However, it seems like a wintertime dish, so I was a little surprised to see fresh tomatoes called for. Perhaps good-quality canned tomatoes would work as well, or one of those little cans of tomato paste. Anyone?
