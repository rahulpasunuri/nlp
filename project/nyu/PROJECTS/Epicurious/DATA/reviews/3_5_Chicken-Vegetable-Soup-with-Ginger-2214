I loved this!! We have a beer can chicken cooker - If you don't have one, you have to try it! It cooks a whole chicken on the grill to perfection. I save the carcass and when I had 4 of them, I boiled them to make the broth, with some carrots, onion, celery, thyme and rosemary. I strained this and chilled the broth, then skimmed the fat. I picked all the meat off the bones, and came up with plenty to add to the soup at the end. Other than this, I followed the recipe pretty closely, leaving the soup in the blender until it was nearly smooth.

Very good soup. Followed the recipe with ground ginger (1 1/2 tsp) and pureed with hand held blender. Had no chicken so I put in a rinsed can of cannelini beans, no corn. It was very, very tasty. I would definitely do this again chicken or no chicken.

I wouldn't call it bland. I may have used twice the ginger but I didn't measure. It has a bright ginger flavor. I used homemade chicken broth that I had just prepared. My yam was giant and my russet potato was small. I used frozen broccoli but fresh corn. I only had about 3/4 cup of corn kernels from one ear. I added a parsnip for one of the carrots.

I agree, I used this recipe mostly as a base- I think chicken soup is kind of a personal thing so I prefer to doctor it to my taste. I was drawn to the recipe because of the use of ginger- a nice idea, especially if you're under the weather. But for me the corn flavor was too strong, so I have since made it with squash and liked the flavor better. Also I like some substance in my chicken soup, so I turned it into a chicken noodle soup by adding wide egg noodles.

This is a nice soup. I wouldn't follow the recipe though. It's more of a guide, IMO. First off, I wouldn't throw raw onions into a simmering broth and expect too much flavor.

really boring soup. even with extra ginger it's very one-dimensional, and the color is unappetizing. the plus is that it was very easy, and used up a lot of veggies

I followed other reviewers' suggestions to use more ginger & some cumin & still found the soup to be rather bland. I don't think I'll be trying this one again.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe, don't think changes are needed. My husband and I like this and will have it again.

I did not puree this soup. I changed a few things, I added 2 potatoes, 1 large white onion, half a red onion 3tbs of ginger, and 1 tbs of cumin for bite. Scratch the broccoli if you don't intend on making a puree, and throw in a handful of frozen peas for color. It is fabulous this way!

I loved this soup. Very little fat, yet it tasted creamy, due to the blending of the veggies. I ate the entire batch over a week's period. I found it filling & comforting on cold days. Does need a bit of salt.

This is comfort food to me; nothing wild and exciting. I make this whenever I feel like I haven't been getting my fill of veggies. I usually shred grilled chicken breasts into each bowl. This freezes like a dream!!

I was very disappointed in this soup. While the ginger flavor was great (I doubled the ginger on the advice of other reviewers), I thought the broccoli overpowered the dish. Plus, I decided to only blend half the soup b/c I don't really like pureed soups. Maybe that was a mistake b/c the consistency was weird. So, between the yucky consistency and the not- quite- pleasant smell, the end result was overall really disappointing.

I did not find the soup to be that interesting. Even though I did double the ginger, I felt that it was very thin and bland. It is a healthy recipe, but that should not mean that it has to be its sole redeeming quality! I doubt that I'll make it again.

We doubled the ginger and I loved it, but my boyfriend is not a huge ginger lover and he didn't like it as much as I did. If I were making it for a non-ginger lover I'd only use the suggested amount. It is nice and flavorful and a very pretty dish.

Tasty, but not that exciting. Maybe I needed more ginger or another spice added to it.

I think it was a delicious, delicately flavoured soup, however, I doubled the ginger, and it still tasted great!

This soup was a wonderful change to the norm - it was light, flavorful, and delicious. I will make this again and again!

I am not very good in the kitchen and when a dear friend of mine became ill, I wanted to try to make soup. This recipe was not only fast, but simple to make.

Excellent without the chicken and with vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. Added no salt. Fantastic!!
