Wow. This recipe far exceeded our expectations. The sauce and the spice rub really make for a superb combination... you can't just do the rub, trust me. Both together and you've got a taste explosion! My husband who is very picky loved this, his eyes totally lit up when he took a bite of it. My even pickier 5 year old loved it so much he told me it was his favorite meal and proceeded to lick the sauce off the plate :)

The taste of this dish was somewhat surprising and ultra christmassy due to the anise. We just couldn't believe how crazy potent the spice explosion was, until we realized that the spice load was meant for 4-6 servings - not 2. ("I just ate half a cinnamon stick!") The sauce is delicious, and the meat was super interesting.. Can't wait to try this with less spice mix. Can recommend this with simple Rosemary roasted potatoes.

I used a pre-made Chinese 12 spice rub a day before and a nice grass-fed strip of hanger steak and came out nicely with a broil time of 10 minutes for med-rare. i can't say this tastes authentically chinese but was a nice dish with baby bok choy and rice. would make again.

I tried the recipe as written and I was impressed with the richness of the meat and loved the easy broiling method. I believe that broiling a bit longer is necessary for medium-rare. I did not like the rub, but that's my personal taste. I recommend the recipe because the cut of meat is great, the method of broiling is easy and you can always put your own rub on the meat if you don't like the six spice flavor.

I forgot to say, the sauce is terrific but a bit on the thin side, I added in a half teaspoon of cornstarch just before serving it and it thickened up perfectly.

I've no idea what a hanger steak is but it sounds kinda good. I used strip loins, cut them up into 1 inch wide strips and baked them at 500 F. for 7 minutes. The only things I changed were the anise, I had none so I used chinese 5 spice instead and the cilantro, which tastes like soap to me, subbed fresh parrsley. This was stellar, absolutley fabulous. I served it with a strawberry spinach salad and apple feta rissotto. We'll have this again and again.

One of the best recipes I've ever made. All my guests raved about it. I used strip steaks and put the rub on several hours ahead. The sauce is fabulous.

Fabulous flavor! We could not get hangar steak, so we used skirt steak and grilled it per the instructions for skirt steak with tomatillos (http://www.epicurio us.com/recipes/food/ views/Grilled-Skirt- Steaks-with- Tomatillos-Two-Ways- 350249).

I thought the flavor of this was delicious. But, it did need more salt and I would not suggest a hanger steak for the cut of meat. It was tougher than I expected and I cooked it to medium rare. The pan sauce on the side, however, made the whole dish! That is a keeper. http://tinyurl.com/4rpr2k
