Simply amazing! It came together so quickly, and satisfied my need for Indian food. What a cinch!

This was very good. I dried rubbed the Lamb for a number of hours and then grilled to medium rare. Made the cauliflower without the cream (doubled the broth and boiled for longer so it thickened). The cauliflower was even better the next day cold with quinoa. Will definitely make again!

Amazing! I have made it once with ground veal and once just vegetarian (adding mushrooms and sweet potatoes) to the cauliflower. Just like another reviewer said - my husband kept going for leftovers and was upset that there wasn't more sauce.

Excellent! Very tasty!

I made this with ground lamb. Followed the directions exactly except that I stirred the lamb and sauce and cauliflower together at the end. Was very nice alone--and I'm sure the leftovers will be tasty over rice.

Loved this recipe - made exactly as written, except I used Balti seasoning (from penzey spices, a little different from the typical curry powder) in place of the curry powder. My husband had to eat it as leftovers and he loved it too. I can see why some people don't like lamb shoulder chops - they do tend to be chewy, but I think they're yummy. I'm sure cubed lamb would be just as good.

This is an easy flavorful recipe. I modified to grill the lamb and make the curry sauce as a standalone. I added the flour and curry powder (without any oil) to a dry skillet and let it toast a bit, then whisked the whipping cream and broth - once smooth I added the chutney. My husband's only complaint - isn't there any more sauce???

I made this per recipe and thought it was too sweet and bland. I added chopped pistachios, garlic,salt, and red peper. I up the cream and curry powder. Made with ghee instead of oil. Then it was yummy! Served with tandoori leg of lamb and rice.

Simple and delicious week-night dinner.

I made this for a friend at his house because I love curry dishes but don't cook them in my own house because of the pervasive aroma that lingers for days sometimes. So i ambush unsuspecting friends with the offer to cook dinner for them when I want a curry. Thanks to all the reviewer comments about lamb shoulder. I copped out and used lamb stew meat which i sauteed in hot fat, and then added back to the curry for a final simmering. It was a phenomenal success.

I made this last night and we practically licked our fingers. I used chops instead if shoulder blade. I am going to try and grill them next time. This is company worthy!

Excellent recipe, the sauce was impeccable! I added a bit of curry pastel hot, to the mix and it gave the recipe a little extra kick, without the curry paste the dish is still perfect! Even my 9 year old son loved it! Curry anything is a hit in this house!

Loved this recipe. It was quick and easy. I followed the recipe to the T except that I doubled the cauliflower and sauce only because I had extra cauliflower and I had no other idea/use for it that week. It was delicious and my husband loved it too.

This was excellent! The only reason I gave it a 3-fork rating is because of the AWFUL cut of meat! Who likes lamb shoulder?!? There was so little meat and so much gristle and fat. I'll definitely make this again, but use a different cut of lamb. I doubled the sauce (per other reviews) but I'm not sure it was necessary.

Very good. I followed many of the changes listed here -- broiled the chops (I stripped the meat off the cooked chops, cut it into bite sized pieces and added it to the sauce for less fat), doubled the sauce, used yogurt with some half and half, and, since we like spicy, used Major Grey's mango chutney and spicy mango pickle.

So quick and easy! I made double the cauliflower and sauce and was glad I did. I broiled the lamb-can't stand having to clean up the spatters from pan frying and it was delicious with the light curry flavor.

The sauce was a good mask for cauliflower, which I don't like (but eat every now and then out of, I don't know, guilt) and it has a nice heat when you use hot mango chutney instead of regular. What I don't get are shoulder lamb chops, I've always found them nasty to eat, what with all the gristle and little bones just waiting to break a tooth!

Rating: 4
Yum!! I recommend making a little more of the sauce and cauliflower than the recipe calls for just to ensure you have enough.

This was delicious - my husband LOVED IT. I didn't have the mango chutney, but it was really good. I will definitely make it again - maybe try with Chicken next time.

One word... fabulous. Ridiculously easy to prepare and absolutely delicious!

This was totally awesome! I used thick lamb chops and let the S/P and curry powder soak into the chops for a couple of hours. I did cook them on the stove. I think next time I will thicken the sauce a little bit more. I served this with Dal and bread. Definitely a keeper.

Made this last night and it turned out well. Subbed plain yogurt for cream and white onions for green. Super easy and a quick Sunday meal.

Hello India! This was my first adventure in the kitchen with curry and a great success. Easy to do, and quick to the table. Great flavor. A terrific change of pace. Everyone loved it. What a great idea!

I have never been a fan of curry and this recipe absolutely changed my mind. What a delicious meal. Easy to fix, great weeknight meal since it only took 25 minutes to make. Think next time I will make a wonder aromatic rice, maybe basmati to go with it. Wonderful flavors.

This is a fabulous dish, my whole family enjoyed it. Made exactly per recipe and served it with the cous cous recipe from same issue of magazine, though plain cous cous would also be fine. I used a whole head of cauliflower and 5 small lamb chops (about 1 pound). So satisfying, we will be making this again very soon.

This was very easy to make and quite tasty. I will definitely make it again, but I'll probably double the cauliflower since it needs just a bit more to go with it. Perhaps I'll add some quinoa or couscous as a side.

Well...my husband who is an enthusiastic but not terribly experienced cook, made this for us tonight...excellent! He served diced caramelized sweet potatoes also, served over a few greens. He added a spritz of Sriracha hot sauce. I'll be asking for this again. I am the cook in the family...but he's coming on!
