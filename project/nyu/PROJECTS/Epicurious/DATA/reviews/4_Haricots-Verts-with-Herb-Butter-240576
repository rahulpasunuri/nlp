I made this recipe as written, but made extra herb butter to use on a couple of filets. I seared the filets then topped with the herb butter and finished in the oven. I'm smitten! This one's a winner.

Definitely a "quick & easy" winner, tasteful, and versatile - you can use this herbed butter on many things. LOVE it!

This is a wonderful recipe that I will make again and again. The butter is simply delicious and very quick to make! A perfect accompaniment to the green beans, but I believe it would also work quite well in many other dishes.

Such a simple little thing to do, and such a fabulous result. This herb butter added a delicate and tasty accent to the beans. I think the tarragon and lemon zest really did the job. My Thanksgiving guests loved it. I'll definitely make this again and consider applying the butter to other simple greens.

Simple and delicious. I initially made it with the herb butter, but over time I got lazy and I just throw in the herbs and olive oil instead of butter - to me, it tastes as good as with butter.

Delicious, and easy to make. The Herb Butter was such a hit, that everybody started using it on their dinner rolls too. Fresh Haricots Verts are the way to go; nice color on the plate. Great holiday side dish.

Not only is this recipe good, but we keep a roll of this fantastic herb butter in the fridge all the time. (Roll it up in saran wrap and it keeps a long time. The herbs don't even turn brown!) Then just cut a small piece off and toss it with your favorite veggie.

The nasty school cafeteria green beans forever ruined the vegetable for me. Still, as my co-op gave me a bag, I had to do something with them. I tried this recipe because so many people raved about it. Although I don't usually like green beans, I liked these. I completely forgot to add the tarragon, and it was still really good. I cut the receipe in half, but next time I'll make a little more butter sauce, it was tasty.

I have used this recipe several times for various dinner parties and it is always a big hit. Getting the herb butter ready is a bit of a chore, but the results are great. I especially like the use of tarragon which our friends have found unexpected but delicious!

This was the number one vegetable dish at our Thanksgiving table this year. It was easy to make and delicious. We would make it again without hesitation.

I tried this with frozen haricots verts from Trader Joes to test the recipe for Thanksgiving. I can't wait to serve it to my guests with fresh beans.

I made a much smaller batch of this than the 2# the recipe called for, which may explain why my cooking time was much shorter. My beans were perfectly ready at about 3 minutes. So pull one out every now and then so you don't overcook them. This is not a recipe I would make over and over again verbatim, but it's pretty good way starting point.

Very simple and flavorful. I usually dislike green beans, but I loved this recipe, and had to get seconds. The only change I made was that I used olive oil instead of butter.

Made these for thanksgiving and they were delish, only complaint too much shallot, would cut in half if did again, otherwise great. Dont understand the other reviewer I did a large batch and it took exactly 6 minutes for perfect beans!

Made for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. For me personally there was a bit too much lemon flavor, but that didn't bother anyone else...so who am I to complain. Very simple to make too.

Great flavor and nice change from usual green bean recipes. Only complaint - haricot verts should only take 1-2 minutes MAX to cook and rgular green beans need only 3 minutes. 6 minutes is way too long!
