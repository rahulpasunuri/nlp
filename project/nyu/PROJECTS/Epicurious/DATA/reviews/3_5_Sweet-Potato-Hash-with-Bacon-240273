Maybe it's just not my taste, but I really didn't like this recipe. It looked absolutely delicious to me on paper. But the recipe comes out way too sweet. Between the sweet potatoes, sauteed onions, and sauteed red pepper, the sweetness completely overwhelms the other flavors. Maybe if you added more meat, or switched out half the sweet potato for normal potato, it'd taste good. (My one caveat is that I didn't have fresh or dried thyme, so I had to used dried tarragon...but I don't think that made a huge difference.)

I found this recipe to be way to greasy and a little bland.

Good recipe, but for ease of use, prepare the whole thing in a dutch oven. Cook the bacon, remove the meat, add the onions, peppers, etc., and soften on the stove. Add the potatoes and toss the whole thing in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes (plus or minus, depending on how firm you like your sweet taters). This should help the veggies absorb all the bacon grease and taste. Plus: only one pan to clean.

I used only 5 strips of bacon but even so there was too much grease for me. I did like the sweet potato and red pepper together, which surprised me, and probably used twice as much fresh thyme, but ultimately it was just too greasy. If I make it again I'll drain at least half the bacon fat.

Almost a mesquite flavour; very smoky but not at all harsh. Better than I expected - the other reviews are correct! Very, very simple; just make sure to use nonstick pan.

This is super. I used turkey bacon and it worked fine--I just added some olive oil when cooking the onions to make up for the dearth of grease. It's best with fresh thyme, but this time I didn't have any and tossed in some dried thyme while the mixture cooked--still gives it a good flavor. Great with a fried egg on top!

This is the best sweet potato hash I've ever had. Throw 2 over easy eggs on top and you've got a delicious Sunday breakfast. Use plenty of bacon grease to cook the onions, etc.

I made this, without changing a thing, for a family dinner. The main dish, done by my sister, was baked salmon wth a marmalade/ginger glaze. This was a very easy, very tasty dish. It may show up on the Thanksgiving table this year.

I modified this recipe using what I had on hand and sounded good.. I know it's not the same concept as the recipe but my results were incredible! I didn't have any bell pepper and wanted something a bit spicy so I subbed a quarter of a habanero pepper, used ~1 T garlic powder instead of thyme, and added ~ 2 cups fresh spinach 2-3 mins before taking it off the heat. Added a dash of salt and it was incredible!

My husband summed things up when he said that he liked all of the flavors of this recipe individually, but not together somehow. I agree with him  it was ok but will probably not make it again.

I made this for dinner the other night and topped it with an over- easy egg and served it with a salad--very good! Would be nice for brunch...

Made a double batch in lieu of a sweet yam casserole for Thanksgiving. I used half jersey yams and half sweet potatoes for a more colorful medley. The bacon was made the night before, so the drippings were unavailable. Instead, I sauteed the onions and peppers in a little oil and added the bacon halfway through cooking the potatoes. Ingredients permeated together spledidly. Everyone kept asking what was in it and were so surprised by the simplicity of the dish! One skillet cooking was great for when everything else in the kitchen is otherwise being used elsewhere.

Simple, quick, delicious.

Delicious change to sweet potatoes. It was good hot and cold. I had some left over, reheated it and added a fair amount of chicken stock for a creamy sauce over stuffed ravioli.

The bacon and red pepper make this dish very special. Wonderful side dish for sausage, substantial enough for a light meal on it's own, simple and savory enough for Thanksgiving.

I made this for dinner with pork and sauerkraut. The combination of sweet, salty, and peppery was great. Very easy to make, and I would agree that it makes great left-overs for breakfast the next day!

I've got no skills in the kitchen and this was quite easy to make and really good.
