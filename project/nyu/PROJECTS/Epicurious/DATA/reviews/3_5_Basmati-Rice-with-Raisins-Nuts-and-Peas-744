very tasty, i used chicken broth instead of water, couldn't find saffron, cardamon pods, or cumin seeds. omitted saffron, used 1ts of garam masala, and 1 ts of ground cumin. whole family loved it.

Prepared this excluding the peas, raisins and almonds. Substituted fresh diced mango and roasted cashews. The vote was it was fabulous and a "keeper".

I adapted this for a rice cooker and it worked great as a side with a curry dish. The only substitution I made was half n half for the cream and it had plenty of flavor.

Potentially a great recipe! Try using chicken stock (broth) or a vegetable broth instead of just water. To eliminate the problems of fishing out the peppercorns and bayleaf, create a sachet by placing these spices in cheesecloth (or heavy gauze) and tie with 6 inches of string. It should resemble a sachel or tea bag. Tie the other end to the handle on the pot. When the rice is cooked you can fish out the sachel whenever you like. Enjoy the flavor without the hassle :)

Indian restaurants in the US have gotten into a very nasty habit of using heavy cream in everything, it makes the dish rich with minimum effort. The added calories are the diner's problem. This is a new one I've seen....heavy cream in a rice pulav!! For the real deal....make this whole recipe as described and leave out the cream. And for the best flavor use pure ghee (clarified butter) instead of oil to fry the seasonings and toast the washed basmati rice. A basmati pulav is delicately flavored with whole spices and its nuttiness is accentuated with the use of pure ghee.

Excellent Indian rice dish and quite easy to make(it was every man for himself when it came to removing spices in our house). Very good for a vegetarian meal. I served it with a big bowl of leftover dal (left out the peas) from an Indian restaurant, mango chutney and raita. Next time I will use more onions.

be carefull when using pre-cooked rice, Do not rinse it, nor soak it. flavor was great. Difficult to take out the spices.

Very traditional Indian dish. We served this with other traditional cuisine: Naan and Chole. It was big hit.

Really a very uninteresting dish, no flavor despite all the spices. It was so bad, we threw the left-overs away, and there was a LOT left over after the first serving. Our attempt was closer to really bad rice pudding, with onion.

Nice accompanyment with Lamb. I used 1/2 cup whipping cream and left the peas out. Delish!

The flavor was excellent. Made double the recipe but it was a hassle removing the spices from the big mound of rice.

This was a big hit as a bedding for a main dish (a centercut pork chop baked in a papaya-curry sauce). I used golden raisins and actually put a little more whipping cream than the recipie called for- and it turned out fabulous.

Much blander than expected. The only item I missed was saffron (very expensive) which I don't think would have made much difference. I would try it again adding curry and apple.

very long preparation, would prefer more straightforward basmati rice to complement the other dishes, this would be better if it were not an accompanying dish.

I haven't tried this specific recipie (not off this site) but have made it with the exact same ingredients and procedure. I personally like this dish better without the cashews and would toast the almonds and mix them and the raisins in with the rest of the ingredients at the end.
