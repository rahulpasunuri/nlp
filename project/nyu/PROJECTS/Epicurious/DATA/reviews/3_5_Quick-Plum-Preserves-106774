Kind of Boring and bland

I received a free 2lb bag of plums from a friend. They weren't sweet at all so I used the full amount of sugar in the recipe. It came out PERFECT! My kids want to eat it on everything!

Wow. So easy and just delish!

I made this because I had a recipe that called for plum preserves and I couldn't find them at the grocery stores. Very EASY to make but to get to the desired consistency it took longer than 1 hour.

I made these preserves exactly as written with plums from my own trees. It was wonderful! Everyone I shared it with raved. I kept the sugar in the recipe because I processed the preserves in a canning bath so I could keep it more than 1 month.

Unfortunately I had to use store-bought plums which were not as sweet as tree-ripened. So I used the sugar called for, and they were perfect! What a flavor, and yet containing much less sugar than normal preserves. So even with the sugar, they still contain far fewer calories and are healthier!

Used the plums from my plum tree in the back yard, added about 1/4 cup finely chopped candied crystallized ginger. The result was a wonderful preserve that has a little extra zing from the ginger and isn't too sweet. I omitted the sugar completely and would probably do so again. Can't wait to try this over vanilla ice cream or cantaloupe.

Very easy and a pretty little gift for neighbors. I made three small batches: with sugar, with half the sugar, and with no sugar. My verdict: don't add any sugar.

These preserves are perfect for the fried plum ravioli. Which is what they were intended for. They're also good as a component for other dishes like easy tarts, it's a good addition into ginger icecream, tastes great on pepper icecream topped with candied orange zest. Tons of stuff. But it's not too sweet.

I agree with the cook from Seattle, Wa. Do not add sugar. Perfect !

Maybe I just had super-sweet plums, but the recipe turned out too sweet the first time (but still yummy). For my second batch, I eliminated the sugar, and the results were scrumptious!
