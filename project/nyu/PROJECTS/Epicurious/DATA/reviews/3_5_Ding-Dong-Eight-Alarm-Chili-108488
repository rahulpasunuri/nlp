I have made this chili several times....while it is more work than traditional chilis it is well worth it. Absolutely delicious, always gets rave reviews from everyone I've made it for. Definitely heed the recipe's advice and let the soup rest for a day or so to allow the flavors to settle (and the heat!). It is worth the effort and the wait!

Maybe I don't know good chili, but this seemed like an awful lot of work for only ok results. Kept hoping that by day 4 it would somehow majically change to something better than I have ever had. Glad I tried it but I think I will just stick to my mum's old chili recipe!

I was worried about the heat level on this one, so I used only 1 serrano partially seeded. Also, do to my access to various game meats, I used deer cut into very small cubes and browned it with bacon. Delicious! I have also, let this chili sit a few days to meld flavor then put a portion in a 8x8 baking dish with a layer of grated sharp cheddar and a layer of cornbread. Bake and serve with a dab of sour cream. Killer game day food.

MUCH too hot. I made it with 2 serranos and it was too hot. I can't imagine it with 4! I did like the flavors and made it again using 1 small serrano partially seeded, 1 jalepeno and 1 poblano and it was fabulous. I also recommend adding unsweetened chocolate as I do with all my chilis. For those who found it too hot, do try it again omitting the serano seeds. It MUST sit for 2-3 days so the flavors can meld.

Rating: 1
I was disappointed with how hot this chili is. After reading the reviews I see many people left out the serrano peppers due to how hot they are and I wish the recipe explained that the heat in each serrano pepper can vary. I would have definately left out the serranos all together. ISince I didn't know anything about hot peppers, I added one and the chili is too hot to eat. Even my husband can't eat it and he eats anything....I will make this again but no serranos!!!

I very rarely post reviews even though I am a huge Epicurious fan, but I just had to pipe up about this recipe, since I've made it about 8 times over the past couple of years. I've won two chili contests, and have hosted two chili parties with this recipe. I've made many chilis over the years, but this is hands down the best. Since I usually make it for a large crowd (and double the recipe), I always leave out the serranos. In my opinion the chipotles add plenty of heat. I usually serve the chili with chopped chilis for a topping anyways. It freezes very well, and since the recipe is a lot of work, I recommend doing the same.

Rating: 4
Really time consuming but SO worth it! I've been testing recipes for years waiting for this one to come into my life! I used the beef chuck but I couldn't find the dried chilis so just left those out. I used a bit less than 1/4 cup of canned chipotle chilis and was glad I did - just the right amount of smokiness. Also I used just one large serrano and that was plenty heat. Definitely start there and work your way up because if I would have spent that much time on this and then made it too hot I would have had a meltdown. Delish recipe! Oh and I used Negra Modelo beer. I plan on having another 1 (or 3) with my chili tonight. Can't wait!

I've made this many times for New Years apres ski party. It does require a bit more work and time commitment than your average ground meat-type chili, but it is worth a try at least once. Great flavor on many levels.

Since there have been no reviews for almost 3/4 of a year we must jump in. Made for Super Bowl Sunday. This is now the family best beef chili. Followed recipe exactly. Made one day ahead then enjoyed on day two. Nothing left to try on day three. Hard to believe we missed this recipe. A winner.

Rating: 4
This is the chili my family ask for every month. I follow the recipe except for the addition of serranos. I omit them. I also cool the chili before shredding the meat. I use a cereal bowl, add some meat, shred it and then transfer to a clean pot before storing in the fridge for a couple of days.This makes it an easier task and I know I have shredded all the meat. For other Aussies, the dried anchos, etc. are available through Monterey Mexican foods in Sydney, via mail order.

This was the best chili I have ever had. Ever. My boy friend made it and I don't know what he did but it was incredible. Very hot, and very delicious. He said he substituted dried habeneros for the anchos, which may have made it more spicy. We ate it the same night and it was so good, not even that much better the second night, still amazing, but not a huge difference.

It is so true, sooo much better on the 3rd day. delicious! will make again.

This chili was just OK. Definitely not worth the effort and hours of cooking. Followed directions exactly and waited until day 3 to eat. A bit greasy. Will not make it again.

Worth the work. Shredding the chuck was tiring, but the end result is really satisfying. I used 2 serranos and the chipotles, but no dried anchos (could not get any). The result was hotter the first night than at lunch the next day, when the flavors had mellowed into a perfect balance. I used kidney beans and topped with all the goodies. Friends loved it.

Rating: 4
This chili is amazing. The three day wait was completely worth it. I turned down the heat a little, using 2 jalapeno peppers instead of serrano (grocery store had none) and it was still satisfyingly spicy. Also, I used a belgian ale and kidney beans instead of pinto. Served over some brown rice with some sour cream, cheese, and fresh cilantro. This recipe nicely filled up me and my housemates, 7 very hungry college students. The ingredients for the recipe cost, in total, around 40 dollars (for anyone who's interested).

I used this recipe (as I tend to make chili with lots of vegetables and beans) for a chili competition at work. Everyone but one co-worker (who is a jerk anyway) thought it was the best and I won! The heat was perfect for my taste, and although other people were sweating they still ate it all. It is labor intensive, and don't even try to eat any on the first day, but by day 3 it is wonderful. I added all 4 serranos, and it had a nice smokey flavor and a slow building heat. For anyone in the Seattle area, the only place I found the anchos were at Metropolitan Market (I tried 4 others first...). This is a nice addition to my chili repetoire and definitely different from what I am used to. If you like spicy food try this!

I love this chili!! I made it the night before a big snowstorm and nobody minded being snowed in since we had such great chili to eat! I usually make it with turkey instead of beef and don't notice the difference. It works well frozen but only gets spicier!

Rating: 4
This chili is great and makes enough to feed a crowd. I used one serrano to start, and tasted as the chili cooked. Remember every serrano chili will vary A LOT in heat, so less is more until you taste. Never leave out the anchos or the chilis in adobo as they form the base for the smoky flavor of the chili. this is really a pretty easy recipe but people will think you slaved for hours.

Second time making this Chilli - I love it, as long as I have a day to relax and spend cooking. I use Chuck Stew Meat, one whole can of Chipotles in Adobo (seeded) with sauce, one whole bunch of cilantro, Red Strip Beer, 2 Serranos (seeded) 4 Dried Red Chilies (seeded)and am very liberal with the garlic and use heaping measurements for the oregano cumin chili powder. Turns out just mildly spicy with a little bit of kick. (I like spicy food). 4 Serranos would probably be about right for spicy. I don't really bother shredding the meat, just take a wooden spatuala and stir/turn - the meat is so tender after 4 hours (simmered on about 3 on my electric stove) it just breaks apart. I definately let is set for 2+ days. First time I tried with Pinto beans, but thought it distracted from the flavors - I like it better without beans. I Serve with SourCream, Lime, Avocado, Cilantro, Sharp Cheddar, and Fritos/Ritz (ugh...my husband) so everyone can add what they like.

Very good chili. Nothing unique/unusual about this chili, except that it is an excellent all-american chili. rich, meaty, wonderful flavors. i, too, added a dark chocolate bar. i only added one serrano, and we like spicy, but that was plenty. It does take a half-day to make, but two days later when all you do is heat it up, it's worth it.

Rating: 3
I forgot to seed the ancho chiles, so my boyfriend deemed this a 7 alarm chili without the addition of any serrano peppers. Still, a very tasty recipe that will be a keeper when I have the time for it. I used a beef brisket which even after simmering for 4 hours was difficult to shred. Made the chili on Friday and served on Sunday - with a LOT of sour cream.

Rating: 4
This is absolutely one of the best chili recipes we have ever made.. It rivals our award winning family chili. Real chili doesn't have beans. We axed the beans and added a Ghirardelli Milk Chocolate Baking Bar, but any type of cocoa bar will work. We also add 4-6oz of aged Tequila. The type is not important and the alcohol will all burn off.

Rating: 4
I made this chili several times while I was living in Europe. I learned to double the recipe because people went back for second, thirds and even fourths. In fact, its fame garnered a winning bid of 300 euros during a charity auction. Not having cilantro available, I brought seeds from Texas and grew it on my balcony. Good stuff, people. Trust me.

I hadn't made chili in a while for lack of inspiration, then along came this recipe! It takes a while to prepare, but is worth the time. I brought it to a superbowl party and had many compliments, ranging from, "Awesome!" to, "The best chili I've had in a looong time!" My secret additive: a couple of squares of unsweetened chocolate. For maximum impact, don't dilute the flavorfulness of this chili with beans. Wow!

Rating: 4
this chili is FANTASTIC. really packs a punch. I served it to a party of pretty picky palates, and everyone raved. I did add an additional can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes after the puree, just to give some additional chunkiness, and the result exceeded my expectations. I let it rest for 3-4 days, the taste was everything you want from a good, spicy chili. Highly recommended.

Rating: 4
Very good! Went with three seranos and was plenty hot. We like spicy for sure, but I think four would have overwhelmed the other flavors (for our liking). I had no problem shredding the meat as other reviewers mentioned. Followed directions to a T and used a bottle of Red Stripe for my beer. VERY meaty chili!

We loved this chili recipe! The crowd that I was making it for shies away from spicier food so I left out the ancho chiles and serrano chiles. It still turned out wonderfully.

Best chili I've had by far. Plan on letting it sit for at least two days to meld flavor. Do NOT take liberties with the chilis/seasoning. I used chuck and it shredded with ease. It was a huge hit & will be a staple. The price you pay is that it takes most of an evening to pull together.

I agree with Ladera Ranch. I too used ground chuck - too much moisture and the wow factor was missing. I end up using the chili in a 7-layer dip.

Rating: 2
For convenience, I had the butcher coarse grind a 4 lb chuck roast. I think the coarse ground beef released too much moisture during cooking, because the chili seemed a little watery. Next time I'll cube the beef instead of grinding it. Used two serrano chilis yet could barely sense the heat after sitting in the fridge for two days. Not the knock-your-socks- off chili I had expected from the description!

Great Flavor. When the meat is soft enough to shred I use a large, strong wire whisk. Of course do this before adding beans.

Awesome chili - I used TVP (texturized vegetable protein) and the pinto beans, and you really couldn't tell it was meatless. I'm not vegetarian but i would definitely recommend this as a great vegan recipe with these adjustments. And felt like the recipe was actually really easy - maybe because i didn't have to cook the meat? Used all 4 serranos - we'll see if that knocks my socks off on the third day!

Rating: 0
This is a fabulous recipe. I used dried anaheim instead of ancho and didn't add any serrano's at all because my guests are not into spicy. It had a pleasant little tingle on the back end and a real depth of flavor from the dried anaheims. Tried the potato masher trick on the beef and it didn't work. There's got to be an easier way than shredding with forks! This is my new house chili recipe. Will try the serrano's when it's just the family eating.

This was a pretty good chili. I cut the recipe in half, as there are only two of us. It was nice and thick and i loved the aroma of the chipotle and ancho chilies. I couldn't find whole ancho's so i just used the equivalent in powder. I used all 4 serrano and added two dried red chilies and it still wasn't all that spicy. I think I'm going to have to step up to the habenero's next time! All in all, a good chili. Hearty, meaty, and filling. And it tastes fine on the first day, but is def awesome on the third.

Fantastic, rich flavor. I have always loved the Chili Con Carne with Chili Cheddar Shortcakes (Gourmet 2/90), but I think this is better. I used ground beef as my family prefers it to cubed/shredded beef in chili, and it was still amazing.

I have made this recipe and invited friends over for a Mexican Night dinner...awesome! I think I set up the standard so high because it's the first time I cook Chile con Carne!!! And yes, I cooked it on Wednesday and we enjoyed it on Friday...so much flavour!! I have to say I couldn't find here where I live the chiplote and the other chilis, but I successfully replace them with some chilis that they sell here and...WOW! We loved it!! I do remember that episode from The Cosby Show!!! Definitively I will prepare it again, it's a keeper!

I made this for a Superbowl party, and thought it was excellent. I didn't add any of the serrano peppers, but it was plenty spicy for my taste buds. Shredding the beef was a pain - I've seen recipes that call for starting with shredded meat and may try that next time.

for people who can't stand the task of shredding, make sure your beef is super tender and use a potato masher; it wont be quite as shredded but it still works well and is faster

I've made this recipe several times in the last year and a half. I often use leftover rare steak pieces. It's great with anaheim chilies roasted and added too. Also, we add black beans and kidney beans to make it a bigger batch, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. yum!

This is some great chili. Like other cooks, I was disappointed in the flavor at the time, but after a couple of days it was divine. However, it does take almost a whole day to put together; I wouldn't make it very often. And if, like me, you accidentally undercook the meat for an hour, you end up with paralysed fingers and meat all over the walls when the time comes to shred it. If the meat doesn't come apart easily, let it cook longer!

This is a great recipe if you really want to go to impress and have a lot of time on your hands. I recommend mesquite smoking the brisket whole on the grill and cooling before slicing into chunks, for added flavor..

This is the best chili I have ever had. I made it for a neighborhood chili cookoff, and won. I followed the recipe exactly, and was really disappointed with it right after putting it together. After 24 hours, though, the flavors really come together. At that point, I crushed all of the beef cubes, so the meat was more shredded than cubed. My neighbors are asking for me to make it again.

It's Friday night - I made the chili Wednesday night and I am sitting here eating a bowl and it is SO good! I had to take minor liberties with the recipe (didn't have brisket, used arm roast; no whole tomatoes, used puree -- that sort of thing). I used two serranos and at first taste this stuff was nasty. Now, however, it just leaves a pleasant tingle in your throat and lips. Unfortunately, it didn't win the cook-off at work, but that's only because it was a bunch of lefse-eating, Norwegian Minnesotans doing the judging. I'm sorry, but if it's got celery or carrots in it, it ain't chili.

Everybody loved this chili. It does need to mellow out a couple of days and is fine with 1 serrano pepper, just enough bite! I added bulk sausage(cheese and garlic flavor) and was great! Great recipe.

I've made this recipe a half dozen times, and it never fails to impress. The combination of peppers yields a complex, rich flavor that really does improve over time. One serrano is more than adequate for heat. Sometimes I use half beef and half pork -- equally tasty!

I have made this recipie twice already and am about to make it again (upon request!) tomorrow. I've made it once with shredded beef and once with ground beef. The key with the chilis is watching the green chilis if you don't want it mouth-burningly spicy. The chipotles in adobo are super-spicy too, and 1/4 cup may be a lot for some people. Enjoy it. This is a great recipie. Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, chopped onion, and avocados on the side.

Very good and not your usual chili. I like things spicy but this is really spicy. Taste it before you add the additional peppers, it might not need it. Also, this doesn't look like the usual chili you get in a restaurant (its much darker), so if you are worried about presentation, you might consider another recipe.

Absolutely incredible! We made this on a snowy weekend and loved how it made the house smell and loved the chili! Make sure to add the advocados.

This is one of the best Chili's I've ever had. Used only 1 Serrano(large)pepper but put in extra chipotle & adobe sauce. I also had only had a 3lb brisket (didn't have a shopping list with me). Had a piece of boneless chuck in the freezer so I also used some of it. Turned out well. The key is waiting the three days, though two was tempting, it definately improves as the flavors meld. This will be a great/hardy dish at tailgates!

This was a really great chili - I amped up the heat on it because I like everything realllly hot - I think I doubled the chilies. It was good the first day but the third day was definitely best. My husband said it was the best chili I've made yet.

This recipe won a chili contest... You do need to take the time and shred the meat. I really suggest following the recipe to the letter. Only add one serrano and taste the next day and see if the heat is ok if not add more. The third day was perfect! with only two serranos (seeded for less heat)will add more chili powder next time for a little more of the chili taste others say it was lacking.

I have to disagree with the other reviews...this was terrible. Maybe because it was my first time making chili but my guests felt that it lacked that "chili" flavor if that makes any sense. All the people who ate this like hot food but we all felt that all you tasted was heat.

yeezus, this was hot! i didn't even use the serranos. next time i'll use less of the canned adobo chiles and add serranoes for that nice green flavor. i like the lime juice--sour cream idea. thanks for the tip. i was a little surprised at the consistency--the collagen in the brisket really made this clumpy, maybe more appropriate for the aforementioned burritoes or a snazzy nachoes plate. but the overall flavor was terrfic.

I made this for a bunch of guys watching football, had 3 requests for the recipe. They di request spicy so 1 habenero, 4 jalapenos, and 2 thai chili peppers in my batch. These were growing in my garden so skipped the serranos. Also substituted kidney beans since I had them in the pantry. One note, I found the shredding step to be quite a pain. Maybe cut meat smaller and skip? I don't know. It is a bit greasy but overall a hit.

This dish was fantastic. Entirely from scratch, which took a while, but was well worth it. I only used 2 of the possible 4 peppers and it was nicely spiced. We ate it on the second day and on day three I used flour tortillas and made Ding Dong chili cheese burrittos which were a huge hit as well!

My husband is on the Dr. Atkin's diet, and it's really hard to find low carb recipes that are interesting. I made this chili, leaving out the beans and using low-carb beer, and it was really good, though time consuming. I ate mine with taco chips and it was a good solution to our diet dilemma.
