cornbread was moist but eggy tasting and a bit sour in taste. Perhaps the buttermilk made it so.

This was bland and very ordinary. Looks lovely, but was not tasty.

I've tried several corn bread recipes from this site, and this was by far the best! I used half coarse cornmeal and half fine. I also added dried dill. Great!

I like how moist this corn bread turns out. Made this with the Vegetarian tortilla soup, they really complimented one another. I'm always looking for new twists on "same ol" corn bread. Really liked this one!

I made this with ham and black-eyed peas for the New Year. My Mom said this was the best cornbread she had ever eaten - a true compliment! One hint, double the recipe for thick slices and add a side of honey-butter - YUM!
