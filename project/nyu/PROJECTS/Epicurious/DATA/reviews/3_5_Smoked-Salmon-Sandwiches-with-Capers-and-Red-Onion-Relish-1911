The spread is a fabuous combination of flavors. When I served these sandwiches, people at the buffet practically fought over them! I had noticed the complaints about the bread choice, so I did change that. I made the sandwiches with Pepperidge Farm Very Thin whole wheat. This was a perfect bread and stayed fresh nicely. Also, not wanting lots of bread, I used only two slices, not three, per sandwich. The first time I made these, several of us said we could barely taste the capers (who in the world complained about too salty with the capers??), so for the second occasion, I added the capers on top of the spread before adding the chopped onion and used more capers than the recipe called for. PERFECTION! This is now a frequent dish for family and friends. I typically serve the sandwiches with a celery soup. Great combination. The only reason I gave this less than 4 forks was the hard bread called for.

I have to agree with the reviewers who said that packaged, grocery-store pumpernickel has an awful texture. This would be much better on mini-bagels or crackers. The smoked salmon, onion, cream cheese, dill, caper combo is a classic and always works.

Using the cocktail bread (referred to as cardboard by one reviewer) was definitely a mistake but my grocery store didn't have another alternative. I definitely prefer the Smoked Salmon & Wasabi sandwiches as a tea sandwich.

This is the ultimate! Instead of the standard tray of "do it yourself" salmon, capers, onion spread, (while trying to hold a cocktail -- impossible!) this is the same great taste if not better (due to the onion relish) in a easy to pass or pickup appetizer! BRAVO!! The only change I would suggest is to only cut the sando's once (into 2 triangles). If you cut them again they are so small and look kind of silly.

With the small party rye I would give this a 2, but with a fresh pumpernickel bread served open face (it's very pretty) my family preferred this appetizer over the rest of the meal.

These were great. Instead of the cardboard like loaf of cocktail pumpernickel, I bought a good quality loaf and froze it and cut cucumer size circles in it while partially frozen with a round cookie cutter and then sliced the circle in half horizontally with a serrated blade. More work but I really dislike the texture and taste of those mini-loaves. Served circles without slicing them. The cream cheese mixture will be great on bagels too.

All I can say is this is a perfect appetizer for a Christmas party - it was the thing most eaten out of all the appetizers there. My friends loved it and so did their husbands. The only thing that was a little hard was cutting them into quarters, so I ended up just cutting them in half. This is a keeper for sure!

The capers made this otherwise yummy dish TOO SALTY! Skip the capers for a fresher, lighter taste.

I loved this recipe,(so did my husband). Served this for a Friday night "light" dinner with a bottle of savignon blanc. I didn't stack the sandwiches,just left them open faced and added a few extra capers on top with the onion relish. DELICIOUS!! Will make this again and probably have to break down and share it with company!!

I've noticed that those cocktail rye breads are pretty dry to begin with. One trick I have seen is to layer the sandwiches in a hollowed-out loaf of bread, which makes a nice presentation and keeps the sandwiches moist. However, I think you would have to have a top crust for the sandwiches in order to do this.

We have made this several times, and it's always a huge hit, however we dislike how quickly the bread dries out; if you serve this on a platter at a party, the corners of each sandwich piece will start to curl up, looking not-too-fab. Anyone else had this, and any solutions, aside from the obvious ones of changing the bread or not serving larger quantities?

I made these as sandwiches for dinner and they were great. Fast and tasty. Might add sliced tomato or cucumber next time.

Made these for a party and they were a huge hit! I didn't alter the recipe at all (and that's not like me!!!). Will definitely make again.

This is always a good appetizer - I used a toasted thin Boboli crust, rather than the Rye, spread with the cream cheese, layered all the toppings, and added paper thin lemon slices and arugula - they really add to the flavor and presentation!. Cut into squares with a pizza cutter. Wonderful, fresh and FAST.

made a nice presentation but was a little clumsy putting it onto a platter(fell apart).I suggest adding roasted black-walnuts coated with a bacon pesto for a contrasting but also complimenting color and flavor "rocket".
