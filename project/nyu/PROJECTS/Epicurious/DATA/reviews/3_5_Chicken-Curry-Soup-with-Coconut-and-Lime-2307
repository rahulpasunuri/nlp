I loved this recipe exactly as written as did my family. I liked the delicacy of the flavors and thought they were fine as presented. I did have some extra lime around and fiddled a bit with the curry- I used a lovely paste. It has a sort of French/Asian fusion subtlety that I think is magnificent.

It was definalty good, but I made some changes after reading the previous notes which I think made a HUGE help with the recipe. I sauted the chicken with the curry & coconut oil before adding it to the soup. ( I also sauted.. mushrooms, onions, red peppers, squash ) Then added some ginger and soy sauce for extra flavor. Also.. I went ahead towards the end of the simmer time and added the chopped up green onion and cilantro. I definantly rec. doing that. It gives it more flavor.

My husband went head over heels for this soup! But like the rest of the reviewers, I changed up some things. First, I used left over chicken breast from the night before and had 2 instead of the 4 this recipe calls for (which I think is too much). I used green curry powder, same amount but if yours is really fresh I would add 1/2 the amount then taste, then add more to your taste. You don't want the soup to be too strong curry. I also added 1 tea. garam masala. I had lemongrass in the tube already so added some to the chicken along with fresh ginger as I stir fried it briefly instead of cooking the chicken in the broth. I used the lime juice but had bottled. If I had fresh I would have used some zest too. I sauteed 1/4 of an onion separately and added it to the soup. I used dried red chili pepper instead of jalapeno. I also added some red chili oil for extra heat. I had a left over cooked sweet potato in the fridge so chopped it up a bit and added it for slight sweetness and color. Serve with brown rice which I also had left over. Add to your soup bowl pour soup over. Don't add directly to the soup it makes it too starchy. I skipped the cilantro but didn't miss it. This soup has many complex flavors and I felt cilantro would overpower them. I didn't have green onions so used dried chives instead for garnish. This soup is very filling. I served with naan bread and a light vinegar and oil toss salad. You will wow your guests with this recipe.

I made my own edits to this recipe. I used chicken thighs - richer flavor. I forgot to buy curry powder, so I didn't add it. I used fish sauce and sriachia to season. I decided to add fresh ginger as well. When I spooned the soup over the rice, I also added fried shallots for texture. As a soup, it's wonderful. But if you are going to pour it on rice, I would add a few drops of fish sauce to the final product.

I made lots of edits and I loved it- I only wish I had doubled it so I could have some for lunch today! Like others, I sauteed the chicken with the curry powder (1 tbls) and added 1/2 cup of veggies (chopped scallion whites, red peppers and eggplant, green chilis), then added the liquid and let it simmer for about 20 min. Great over brown rice and/or with pappadum!

Granted, I didn't have lime wedges or green onion, but I thought this looked beyond BLAH BORING... That said, I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor but I think I'll try adding more curry powder next time and perhaps sauteed onions or other veggies...

This is one of the easiest, fastest tasty recipes I've made, and with ingredients I always have on hand (unless the cilantro has wilted!). If you have leftover rice, it takes around 20 minutes.

For a quick soup with few ingredients that still tastes a little exotic or out of the usual menu repertoire, this is a great 'cheat' recipe if I can call it that! But it's not a PATCH on the Thai Chicken-Coconut Soup. I made these only 2 days apart so I could really compare and this recipe lost out to the other one.

Fast, easy, flavorful. I used roast chicken from night before. Instead of curry powder, used curry paste - go easy, it can contain the chili. Perfect Sunday night meal.

This soup was great! Very warming in the middle of winter. Added lemongrass and ginger to the mix. Followed others' recommendations to saute the chicken in the pan first--good advice. Followed the recipe for spice and thought the heat was just right. Would definitely make this again!

I can't even count how many times I have made this recipe since I found it here. I often sub shrimp for the chicken and NEVER cook either in the broth but rather sautee them on the side and add in at the end. I have made it for many guests and everyone has asked for the recipe. Instead of curry powder I use curry paste and sometimes throw in some extra fresh ginger if I have it on hand. I also lighten it up by using 1/2 regular and 1/2 lite coconut milk. One of my favorite fast meals.

Great starter soup!! I doubled the recipe, added 1 tbs fresh ginger, turmeric (1 tbs.) doubled the curry and used spicy curry, added garlic (2 cloves minced) fish sauce (2 tbs) and seasoning salt (1 tsp). After cooking the chicken in the broth I wasn't happy with the consistency so I mixed up a small bit of flour and water for thickener, then added mushrooms, red pepper, carrots, and zucchini. In the last two minutes I added fresh mango cut in 1 chunks. It was a marvelous meal, delicious, colorful, and the flavors were strong, but not over powering. I would rate this at 98% perfect.

This soup was so easy to make and very delicious. I also added about a teaspoon extra of curry powder and also substituted the jalepeno for cayenne pepper since that is all I had on hand. I also went heavy on the cilantro and green onions, but they are my favorite. For me the soup seemed to need a lot of salt, but with the extra additions of spices I thought it was wonderful. My boyfriend, who isn't fond of Asian food, ate two huge bowls-which makes this dish a success in my book! Very Good!!

This soup has become the traditional first dinner of every vacation with my family. I add way more curry-Probably triple or quadruple what the recipe calls for. I serve it with lime wedges, plain yogurt, and chopped pistachios for everyone to add themselves at the table. Absolutely delicious!

Yum. Quick and easy to pull together. You could easily use leftover chicken and leftover rice for a super-quick supper. No jalepeno on hand..substitued red pepper flakes which gave ample heat.

Delicious and cinchy to prepare. I did not seed the jalapeno and thought the amount of heat was just right. I cooked the liquid down and served the curry over the rice; I doubled the lime juice and added the green onions and cilantro to the broth and let it sit awhile before serving it. A definite keeper! I think doubling the curry would be a mistake.

After reading all the reviews, I nearly doubled the amount of curry, and added a few shakes each of turmeric and crushed red pepper. Whew! That definitely dashed all my worries about the dish being too bland! I really liked it. Very simple, a nice meal to prepare after work on a weekday.

I agree it was a bit bland, however, if you substitute a teaspoon of Thai Curry Paste for the pepper, it will add a lot of flavor and still be spicy. Try 1/2 tsp at first and add to it. Don't overcook the chicken.

I thought this was quite good - extra points for being really, really easy. It definitely has an ethnic flavor which might not go over well with large dinner parties, but for a casual gathering it's a winner.

Yuck! Although my family thought this recipe was fairly good, I thought it was disgustingly bland. I followed other's suggestions and added twice the curry, cayenne pepper, and let it sit for an hour. I also added a teaspoon of honey. It WAS quick and easy, but I didn't like it.

This comes together in about 10 effortless minutes. It was a bit bland, though, and I will add more curry powder next time.

This is incredibly bland even with the curry and pepper doubled. Yes, it's easy but there are lots of curry dishes out there that require as much effort but taste much, much better. I wouldn't bother with this one again.

this was such a simple recipe...and it smelled wonderful cooking but it was a bit bland for my taste. i even used homemade stock...i will try it again though and perhaps start experimenting to liven up the taste.

We love this recipe--it's quick and oh-so versatile! A recent "tweak" included a little extra curry, the addition of a couple of sliced shiitakes at the same time as the chicken, and the replacement of the jalapeno with crushed red pepper. I like it better with light coconut milk than regular, as the flavor can get a bit heavy otherwise. This will be a frequently performed piece in our kitchen repertoire!

This is so easy and turned out really well. I agree that you should let it sit for a while. It was prettier at first but it tasted a lot better and the chicken became much more tender after an hour or more. The rice must be sticky or don't even use it at all.

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful. Easy and top notch flavor. Left out the cilantro since I'm not a fan, and added a bit of cayenne pepper. Used a huge jalapeno and was happy about it. As the other reviewers have said, this would also be great with shrimp. Delicious meal on a cold night.

This really rates 3.5 forks...just yummy. I made it with 1/2 pound shrimp instead of chicken and thought it was great. Also, my version ended up simmering about a half hour or so longer (my dinner guest was late), and it really helped bring out the flavor of the jalapeno. (Make sure you use a large jalapeno.) Served it with jasmine rice, and just had the leftovers for lunch. Terrific!

a versatile recipe - I used homemade chicken broth and finding I didn't have a lime, substituted the juice of one lemon and a dash of finely grated peel. I also added a tsp. of sesame oil and l tbsp. of light soy and ladled it over some rice as suggested in the recipe. Hearty!

this was good, very quick and easy to make. for more flavor, i increased proportion of curry and lime juice and also added shrimp, cayenne, and thai basil. lastly, i used noodles instead of rice (just felt like noodles that day; sure it's good w/ rice).

Very good and very easy to make! We tried using Basmati rice and found the nutty flavour very suitable. The smell of coconut is wonderful.

add a little cayenne pepper and throw in jumbo shrimp to make this a full meal. i added a few more indian spices to give this a richer spicier flavor.

I was plesantly surprised to find your site and this recipe. I had made it years ago and I misplaced it. I have since been making my own variation. I generally use up 3 tablespoons of Curry an the Juice of four limes and one chopped red pepper, very intense.

This is a very good soup. For Thai authenticity, I increase the spice content a bit and sprinkle basil leaves on top.

Not too spicy--but a very filling winter dinner. Cilantro added at the end made a big difference in giving the soup flavor.
