This was great and very easy. I made a few changes. First, I subbed a large onion for the leeks since the ones at the market did not look good. Also, I used a rotisserie chicken and just tore it up and added it at the end, same time as the cream. This made it a little quicker and easier for a weeknight dinner. I'll definitely make it again this fall and winter.

Made this with what I had on hand on a cold rainy night ~ yum! Used a small onion and a few stalks of celery instead of the parsnips and leeks. Fresh thyme instead of tarragon and no cream. DELISH! Easy to embellish however you like... perfect for a cold winter night, savory and comforting.

This stew was excellent. I replaced one of the parsnips with a turnip, just because I like them. The end result was a beautiful sweet sauce that tastes something like coconut, although it is not; great with the chicken. I shared this recipe around. It's a great way to introduce new vegetables to your family and guests. Fabulous with a hearty bread.

Yummy. Perfect for cold winter nights. It only took about an hour from start to finish, but it tasted like it had been simmering all day. It even looked good before I added the cream. I might not add it next time.

I made this for my Boomer parents, 30 year old brother and his Japanese girlfriend to their delight. The sauce was wonderfully savory and the chicken was tender and flavorful. Highly recommended!

My husband has been making this for us for years. We love it. The only change we make is to use all organic ingredients. Real food tastes fantastic! I would rename it though; maybe Cuddle up with me Chicken Stew.

Roasting the parsnips, potatoes and carrots first added a great deal of flavor. Sautee leeks, then add roasted vegetables. Substituted thyme for taragon. Great meal!

Rating: 2
I omitted the potatoes, added a can of sweetcorn at the end and used soya yogurt instead of the whipping cream. Oh and olive oil instead of butter. It was tasty although I was full of it by cooking it for 2 hours (prep & cooking time). It just proved to me that I love my parsnips roasted with honey. No other way.

This dish is four forks with my revisions because I couldn't find a recipe that I liked on the website. I subbed thyme & rosemary for tarragon. I also roasted the vegetables first (with the addition of garlic, red pepper and some green beans- no leeks) in the oven with olive oil, rosemary & thyme. Then basically followed the recipe- added some fresh italian parsley at the end. AND only if you want to take it over the top...I made the dumplings from the Beef Stew recipe on epicurious (with parsley instead of other herbs) and this was THE most amazing stew I've ever made!!! Prepare to wow your friends & family!

Your opinion of this recipe will be in direct proportion to your feelings about tarragon and parsnips, since those are the predominant flavors here. I used fresh tarragon rather than dried. I'm kind of neutral on tarragon, so I thought this was good but not great.

Rating: 3
Overall, a good staple recipe. I would cut the chicken in much smaller pieces, however. Possibly, cook them shredded. Also a very good addition to the recipe are sweet corn kernels and peas. I used the frozen kind and they worked out great. I added them right before the heavy whipping cream. Serving this stew over egg noodles makes for a really good cold winter day dish.

Excellent cold winter meal. Do not like parsnips, so used green beans instead, also added a splash of fresh squeezed lemon juice.

A basic meal that invites personal flare! I added mild Italian saucage that I sliced and pan seared before adding to the dish just before serving. I also added diced red potatoes, even the kids went back for seconds.

I made this recipe for a group of friends one of whom is allergic to onions. It's so hard to find good recipes without them! I added the garlic and peas as per previous suggestions. This one was a real hit. Simple, delicious, comfort food.

Might have well have bought a potpie. Even with all the tarragon, this needed something (I added garlic, however still boring). If I were to do it again I would have shredded the chicken, added sausage, and put a crust on it. Also the vegetables were overdone. The eight-minute stir-fry made them mushy.

Rating: 2
I had really high hopes, but I was unimpressed. It wasn't bad, just very average. I read all the reviews and took a few of the hints (added mushrooms, etc.). I followed the tarragon amount from the recipe, and it did not overpower. When I saw all the browned bits stuck to the bottom from the chicken I was sure it was a winner (they got incorporated w/ the veggies). Oh well. I used the freshest of ingredients, and it looked great - I served it over rice. The rice soaked up the sauce nicely.

This really is delicious. Made it according to the recipe except added garlic to the veggies per a previous review.

I also made this without the cream and it turned out scrumptious. I added dumplings with 15 minutes left in cooking time and they were great with this dish. Everyone really enjoyed the mixture of flavors in this one.

After working six days a week for the last ten years now have time to play on the computer. This is the 1st recipe I have tried on this site. Made double to freeze half [ex. potatoes] Used chicken thighs with thigh bone in and skin removed and legs. Cut down on butter then strained off liquid and clarified the French way which removed most of the butter but still left the butter flavour. Still added the cream. Didn't get to freeze the remainder. Took the meat off the bones in big chunks and served it with some bought organic butter puff pastry on top. What you call a Pot Pie [for unexpected guests] the next night. Love the rating system - gives me more confidence to try new recipes. The result DELICIOUS!!! This site is now on my favouries list.

Leslie, I have only ever made this without the cream...I tried it and loved it that way. You can see my original review 2/8/01 when I lived in Beverly Hills, MI. I love this in the winter, and have also successfully frozen leftovers for a quick meal another night. Enjoy!

The whole family really loved this. Husband and son don't usually like things with cooked root veggies, but they loved this! I added fresh thyme, and only used a little tarragon at the end, as it is not one of my favorites. Used a lot of fresh ground pepper. Removed skin from chicken breasts (only used breasts. Next time, I will try with boneless skinless breasts and thighs.

Marvelous. I added mushrooms and peas like other readers suggested. However, I doubled the amount of tarragon and loved it. Other readers suggested halving it - to each his own.

This is very tasty comfort food - it is very similar to a chicken pot pie filling except that the pieces of chicken are whole and not diced. I added frozen peas in the last ten minutes of cooking time and served it with biscuits. It was a big hit!

Leslie, I know nothing about kosher restrictions, but would it be allowed to use soy products? If so, there is soy creamer available, that would probably work very nicely in this. If not, perhaps just using a thickening agent (flour, arrowroot, cornstarch, etc.) would be somewhat comparable. Hope this helps.

I have not yet made this recipe, although it sounds wonderful. For the respect of keeping kosher, is there a way to prepare it without dairy (ex. cream) and still achieve a great result?

Oh so good! Used boneless breasts (snowstorm prevented trip to the store; added garlic after butter melted; added 8 ozs quartered mushrooms with potatoes; added frozen peas at end. Served with seeds and grains bread and everyone thought they'd died and gone to heaven! Delicious!!!

Hmmm. This might rate three forks with a few changes. I dropped fat way back, 1 T for the chicken, 1 T for the veggies. I used 4 cups chicken broth, 8 oz quartered mushrooms and added a cup of frozen peas at the end. Also used H&H which did separate and so didn't look so hot, think heat was too high at the end. My BIG problem however was that there were WAY too many potatoes. And not enough punch. I used 2 t of dried tarragon vs the fresh, that might be it. I also made bite-size pieces of the chicken and wouldn't do that again. This has potential but isn't there yet ... for us at least.

A real family pleaser! My 7 and 4 yr. olds loved the chicken, my husband loved the whole thing, and even though I'm not a big chicken eater I loved this recipe. The veggies and sauce were outstanding! I added mushrooms (suggested by other reviewers), and used some drumsticks, thighs and boneless breasts. All the chicken turned out perfectly tender. Plus, it was pretty easy and quick. This will be added to our regular repetoire.

added 6 sliced mushrooms, 1/2 cup frozen green peas for added colour......fantastic flavour! I dropped some dumpling mixture in the broth and had a complete dinner..............great raves!

Made this with half and half instead of cream, and half the amount of tarragon as suggested by others. It was wonderful as a stew. I think it would be fabulous as chicken pot pie, under puff pastry or even homemade biscuit crust. Probably would also be a good way to use up Thanksgiving turkey.

Rating: 4
Excellent stew for a cool autumn day. I used low fat/low sodium canned chidken broth and only 1/2 the fresh tarragon. I also doubled the recipe and cooked much longer than the recipe called for. Easy for entertaining because you can enjoy your guests and until it's time to ladle the stew into your dishes! Also tastes great the second day!

I made this for my family tonight and no one said a single word during dinner -- absolutely delicious! I served with cracked wheat sunflower seed bread and a field green salad. The bread made a great complement because you sop up the sauce with it. For whatever reason, I could not find baby new potatoes, so I substituted small Yukon potatoes, which I forgot to add until I put the chicken back into the broth -- worked out perfectly, though. I also took a previous cook's suggestion and used half and half instead of whipping cream. (For dessert, I served baked pears glazed with cardomon and brown sugar, topped with sour cream-brown sugar.) I will definitely make this again.

My husband said this was the best thing he has ever eaten. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and took them out a little sooner than if I'd used bone-in chicken. Served it in big pasta bowls with crusty bread and a green salad. Fresh tarragon really lifts this dish out of the ordinary. If you're concerned about the fat content (and I was a bit horrified by all that butter) I think you could cut down on the butter a bit without sacrificing too much flavour. I wouldn't skimp on the whipping cream though. A winner.

Rating: 3
Great recipe! It's an easy dish to put together and no matter who I make it for; guests or just my husband and myself, we never get bored with it. If I tweek it at all, it's just adjusting the seasonings to suit our tastes but reall this dish needs no major work.

Rating: 4
The combination of parsnips, leeks and taragon made for a very aromatic dish. I followed the recipe exactly (except for adding a few cloves of garlic in with the vegetables). The whipping cream makes it a little rich, but I rationalized its only a small amount! I might switch to all white meat next time. The dark meat adds a lot of flavor but wasn't a big hit at my house. Great winter party dish.

Rating: 3
This stew was very good. I used boneless chicken breasts instead of a cut up chicken and added frozen green peas right before serving. The tarragon and leeks gave it a very nice flavor. However, the "chicken with tomatoes and white bean stew" (Bon Appetit, Dec 1999) is still our all time favorite.

Rating: 3
I really fiddled with this recipe since my husband campaigned for beef stew instead of chicken, but I wanted to try the great veggie ingredients! So, I substituted 2 1/2 lbs of tenderized stew meat and oniony beef broth for the chicken and chicken broth, and used 1/2 thyme and 1/2 marjoram since I didn't have tarragon handy. All gave a very nice flavor. I would avoid the heavy cream and use half-and-half since the cream made the stew a bit too heavy tasting - with the combination of other ingredients, you don't need the extra weightiness. But overall a nice blend of flavors and a great meal.

This was wonderful! One of the best recipes I've ever had. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and added three cloves of minced garlic to the vegetables, and I only used three parsnips because the store had a lousy supply. I think it was a good thing, though, because there was plenty of broth. It was fabulous! I'm all ready planning two dinner parties just so I can make this!

I certinaly will make this dish again, if my 3 year old (who is extremely fussy on all foods) will have two helpings then it is well worth the time & effort, also we (adults) enjoyed it too. Thumbs up for this one.

yum! used boneless skinless breast, and fat free half and half. It took longer than 10 minutes to thicken to stew consistency, and in that time I decided to cut breast into bite size chunks,that gave me the perfect chicken stew! I would NOT serve this with another startch {rice or noodles} just a good earthy bread and you have a wonderful dinner.

Surprisingly tasty. The fresh tarragon gives this dish a nice balance of flavors, as does the sweetness of the parsnip. I made loads of gravy and vegetables which can be reheated and served on toast or timbales for a vegetarian-like lunch.

Yum! This is really good. It's going to be a new cold weather staple at our house. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, and half & half instead of the whipping cream. Served it over biscuits.

First made this stew in Paris on a typical cold and rainy fall night. Double the recipe because you'll want leftovers. Couldn't find parsnips so used radishes instead, ends trimmed but unpeeled, about 2 cups. Served with crusty baguettes from our local boulangerie (Maison Keyser on Rue Monge in the 5th - one of the best in Paris). Made it again the next week for a dinner party for Parisian foodie friends. They were so impressed! We started with a seasonal rustic rabbit terrine from our local charcuterie (on Place Maubert), then the stew and baguettes, Comte for the cheese course, and finished with a seasonal fig tarte (again Maison Keyser). I don't remember the wines because we tried so many good ones and they were never more than 35 francs (less than 5 dollars) a bottle! I look forward to making this dish again, this time with the parsips, one of my favourite winter vegetables.

This was a delicious, comfy dish. I used chicken thighs (skin off) and some drumsticks instead and added an extra carrot. Since baby potatoes were not available, I added chunks of white potatoes. I accidentally added extra dried tarragon and we really liked the flavour. If you use the thighs and drumsticks, you can easily serve more than 4.

Pure comfort food! I did not use the parsnips, but doubled up on carrots, added a bit more cracked pepper. Some crusty rolls and butter on the side, that's all you need.
