Made this to go along with chicken toastadas. Smelled amazing as it roasted. I didn't have jalapeño so I subbed cayenne pepper, mild jarred yellow peppers and added some fresh chopped cilantro at the end with the fresh apples. It was a perfect compliment to the toastadas - chicken, refrained beans, and avocado. I will definitely make again and definitely use the jalapeño next time....without it (or my swaps) all the flavor is in front and so it's not very interesting. In the end...there was two tablespoons left....and only because everyone was full to the max.
