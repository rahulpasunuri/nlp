These were extremely delicious. We used hearts instead of circles for the shapes (because why not have fun with it!). Only thing we wanted to do next time was use Hazan's simple pasta sauce as a side to it for full blown game night happiness.

These are as close to the real thing that you will find unless you go to Rome. I had some last night at the home of a Roman friend and believe it or not, she says these are often recommended for sick people, to help them recover their strength (and she is an MD!) What better recommendation for one of the ultimate comfort foods?!

With a potato gnocchi disaster (at a dinner party, no less) in my past, these gems have redeemed the little dumpling's name. Ethereal not only for their lightness, but also in their marriage of butter and parmigiano-reggiano. You really can't go wrong with this recipe - just don't skimp! My kids and husband adore this one.

Very rich! This was my first time making gnocchi of any sort, and I thought the flavor was excellent. I think the mixture could use a little less milk in order to make firmer discs, and could be brushed with slightly less butter, but over all it was a wonderful side dish. A nice change from potatoes or rice, etc. for a starch.

I've never liked the standard potato gnocchi. Always has little flavor and feels like lead balls in my stomach. But this was a totally different dish. Absolutely delicious. It's decadently rich with butter and parmesan. But it's worth every calorie. Doesn't need any sauce or anything. It was a pain cutting that sticky dough into rounds, but the the taste made it worth it.
