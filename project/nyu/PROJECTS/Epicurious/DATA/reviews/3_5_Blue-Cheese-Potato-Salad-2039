This is a family favorite because it is different, tasty, and we like moist potato salads. You can add diced red/green peppers, hard boiled eggs, green beans if you wish for additional color and texture. A keeper! B.J. Harrick

I've been making this since I saw the recipe in the original issue of Bon Appetit. Has it really been 21 years? This is easily one of the best tasting, easiest to prepare potato salads ever. It's elegant, has few ingredients and does extremely well at picnics, family reunions, etc. When I was married the second time, my husband and I opted to host the reception in our home instead of a formal sit-down meal. I made ten pounds of this for 50 people, thinking I'd have extra for myself. I was so wrong. It was gone in the first hour. I strongly suggest this for a bit of a twist that people will enjoy. I usually make the recipe exactly but will sometimes put the celery on the side since I'm not a celery lover at all. Once for a 4th of July picnic, I sliced radishes into this for the color of Red, White & Blue... Wish I could give this 4 spoons.

I was afraid to make this after reading the reviews. So, I made the dressing in a seperate bowl. Added only 1/4 cup of wine. Put 5 oz of blue cheese in with the potatoes. Mixed in only 1/2 the dressing. It's great. I think it will go well with my the poblano chili hamburgers tonight. Not serving it for 5 hours, will do a taste test and maybe need to add more of the dressing & sprinkle on some more blue cheese. crumbles if needed.But so far really good.Like the idea of adding the bacon will try that next time.

Since I like blue cheese and potato salad I thought I'd give it a try. Bad idea! It was horrible. I served it with BBQ brisket at my super bowl gathering. I thought the flavor was off, but my sister tasted and said it was fine. When I noticed that my sister was the only one who ate any of the salad, I announced "this just isn't that good, is it?" and my relieved guests admitted that they were glad I said something because none of them wanted to eat it. Then my sister sheepishly admitted she only ate her small portion to be polite. This was a very bad idea.

This potato salad is certainly a keeper. I added bacon and also didn't want to open a bottle of wine, so I tossed the potatoes with about a tablespoon of Champagne vinegar. I used a little extra blue cheese as well and didn't peel the potatoes.

Thanks to the other reviewers I cut the dressing in 1/2 and it was still too much. I used light sour cream and still tasted rich. Delicious w/ grilled steak. Don't skip the wine!

Made this for a BBQ tonight and it was perfect for the event. Everyone loved the salad. The wine is crucial. Could be good with gorgonzola as well.

I too added bacon to the salad. I agree that there is just a bit too much dressing but hey, I like it saucey! Got good reviews from the potluck I took it to. Will make again.

My favorite potato salad recipe

Good salad. I took advice from the reviewers and only added enough dressing to moisten. I added more green onions and blue cheese than called for and garnished with a chopped hard boiled egg.

Way, way, way, way too much mayo and sour cream. I cut it by 20 percent and it was still very gloopy. By cutting that back it would be pretty good.

I, too, took this salad to a party. Everyone went crazy for it. I took it the very first time I made it and I was so glad I did!

I have been making this recipe for years. I get requests to bring very often. However, when I tell people where the recipe is, they always say it didn't turn out the same. Well I finally came back to look at the recipe. These are my modifications. Cut sour cream in half &add a couple of TBL's of mayo. I increase the blue cheese to taste. I also add crumbled bacon. I never realized the original didn't have it in the recipe.

Not bad but better if you halve the sour cream and mayo.

I made this potato salad for a summer party and it was a big hit. It is a nice potato salad with a twist.

I liked the flavor at first, as I was mixing it, but should have heeded warnings that it is too saucy - I would call it soupy! With less sauce and maybe some chives to brighten it up, it would be better. But good old regular style is lower fat, easier and in my opinion, better.

Love this salad. It goes perfectly with a good Cabernet or Bordeau.

This potato salad was a little too creamy and saucy for my taste although the blue cheese added a nice flavor. I liked it, didn't love it.

Very disappointing, especially considering the rave reviews this recipe got. It was pretty bland and blah and had that sweetness one sometimes finds with commerically-prepared potato salads. I've been making the Potato and Pea Salad with Chive Aoli from the July 2001 Bon Appetit most of the summer and thought to try something a little different. I should have stuck with the other; it's a much better dish.

I have made this recipe also since it was first published and have always gotten compliments on it. I have changed nothing in the original and everyone finds it to be just perfect. Everyone looks forward to it at various gatherings-year after year! I now bring copies of it with me to hand out.

Like many of the other reviewers, I have been making this recipe since it was first published. I am pleased to see that it is included in this collection. This is the ultimate potato salad!! I have taken it to many barbecues and company luncheons and have always been asked for the recipe by someone. Don't be afraid to try it. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!

This salad is spectacular! I took it to a family gathering where it disappeared rather quickly. My father, notorious for his life-long hatred of blue cheese, not only tasted it but even went back for seconds. It's a refreshing change from your everyday potato salad!

Very nice. I used gorgonzola since it's a little milder a true blue. Also, the dressing measurements are definitely too much. I used just less than a cup of the mayo and sour cream and it was still quite creamy.

Delightful.

This is the best potato salad I've ever had. It's perfect just as it is, no additions or substitutions (although a friend did add diced bacon and said it was even better). Every time I've served it I've gotten rave reviews, even from non-blue cheese fans.

This is a great potato salad. Too bad for the "I don't like blue cheese" people who do not try this salad.

I went looking for a recipe for a "good" potato salad to serve at a service club luncheon. Imagine my surprise finding this recipe, as it has been sitting in my recipe limbo file for a longgggg time (I had cut out the original from 1990). I was counting on your readers ratings to select a "good" one, and that they did. What a GREAT recipe. Everyone loved it and the President of the club wanted to pay me to take home the leftovers!! Thanks everyone...my luncheon was a sucess!(I also did not peel the potatoes, and I doubled the recipe and then added more potatos as a little too "goopy" for my tastes). A keeper for sure !!

I made this for a cookout this weekend, and received many compliments. I did not bother to peel the red potatoes, it adds color and I don't think detracts from the recipe. I would also cut back a bit on the dressing, it is a little on the goopy side.

I made it for a family gathering, based on the reviews. Even those who claim they do not like blue cheese loved it! It is requested at all family gatherings, now. At least everyone knows what I will be bringing.

I used about 1/4 more blue cheese and did not put in the green onions or celery. For the mustard I used 1/2 Dijon and 1/2 hot Chinese which gave it a nice tang. Might reduce the mayo/sour cream as it was kind of goopy.

I used a little less blue cheese than the recipe called for and I still thought it was too much. I will definately make this again but with even less blue cheese.

This is a fantastic potato salad. I use more blue cheese than required and maytag blue is my choice. I omit the celery and add additional green onions. Great with burgers and grilled pork

I loved this potato salad. I have made it more than once and everyone enjoyed. I do use a bit more blue cheese than it calls for.

I hate to be the heavy, but I didn't love this recipe. I expected a little more bite, with the blue cheese and vinegar. I used a really nice, strong blue which knocked my socks off when nibbled with a slice of pear and a good, dry Chardonnay. (If you've never experienced that particulary culinary heaven, try it soon - you'll be very happy!) But I found this potato salad bland, and goopy. If I were to make it again, I would probably just use Marie's or Marzetti's blue cheese vegetable dip instead of the mayo and sour cream, and would add extra blue cheese to it, along with the scallions and celery.

It was heavenly. Even my 15 yr. old loved it and he doesn't like anything except burgers and pizza. I can't wait to make it for others. Thank you.

I've been making this recipe since it was first published. I use less celery but have kept the rest of it as is. It is fantastic with Maytag Blue - I always receive nothing but positive comments. Recently I served it to a local chef who duplicated it and added it to his restaurant's menu.

I have been making this recipe since I saw it in the original magazine. I make this potato salad for family reunions, my own wedding reception, office parties and immediate family get togethers. It always gets compliments and at least one person asks me for the recipe.
