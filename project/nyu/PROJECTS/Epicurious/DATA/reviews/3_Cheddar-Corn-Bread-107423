Added the extra sugar and a can of creamed corn and it was delicious! Makes two breads instead of one and moister and denser.

I understand about this being a savory cornbread but I didn't find it all that savory, rather more salty, due to the amount of cheddar and other ingredients. I decided to add a bit more sugar (2T) into the batter and also sprinkled some on top for a nice caramelization which adds a little balance to the bread. Also didn't seem to have enough corn so I added some creamed corn in a can this time around. Will see how it turns out.

This is a great "savory" cornbread recipe--if you want the sweet corn muffin taste, it's not for you. I recommend using a high quality sharp cheddar for best results.

This was so moist! My Cinco de Mayo crowd loved it with chili.

I made this to go with chili tonight and was very disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used stone-ground cornmeal b/c that's what I have in the house. It took more like 25 minutes to cook and was very bland. I was expecting an interesting corn bread with the cheddar and scallions but it barely tasted like anything. Not worth making.

I have made many different corn bread recipes and this was the best beyond compare! Another reviewer said it was bland, but I found the delicacy of the flavors delicious. It was moist and held together very well. I used canned chiles instead of the scallions and also used the stone ground cornmeal since it was all I had. This is my only cornbread recipe from now on.

This is an average corn bread. We have other recipes that I like better.

The scallions really gave the corn bread a nice flavor. It really reminded us how much we enjoy corn bread. I would definitely make it again.

Dry and very bland despite the scallions and cheddar cheese.

I don't have any cornmeal other than stone ground. It worked fine. I was serving it with white bean chili, and used Kraft Mexican Blend grated cheese. It was excellent.
