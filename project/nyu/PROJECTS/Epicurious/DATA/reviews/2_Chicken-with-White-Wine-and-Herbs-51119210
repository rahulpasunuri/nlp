We had this recipe for dinner, I found it to be fun to make but when it came to the meal we were disappointed. I do not think I will make it again, but I did find some of the steps might be useful when I make other recipes. The stock was very tasty and with the wine it added another element to the stock which we all liked.

Delicious and easy to make. I put in a little extra wine near the end because the flavour got lost and it is in the title.
