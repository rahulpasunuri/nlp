I thought these were great. I agree they weren't too pretty, but they were delicious. I thought the pita was a little flimsy; I might try to come up with something else to use next time. I used pecans instead of walnuts; I don't think it made much difference.

Delicious! I cut my pitas into 6ths before toasting them. The combination of flavors is wonderful.

I made this recipe for a cocktail party and it was barely touched. The look of it alone was enough to turn most people off. The mixture was this odd greenish-yellow, that I really hoped would look better as it cooked, but it did not. The taste was tangy and not at all interesting. I don't understand all the rave reviews.

Made this for my first cocktail party and have to admit - was a little leary of it. I wanted to try something different and amazingly enough - the crowd loved this recipe. It was gone two minutes after I putting the serving plate out! Based on the below reviews, omitted the apricot preserves and not having tried it with - it tasted just fine. If you do not have the preserves on hand, don't make the effort to buy some - omit it.

I liked these only a little bit, but all the people I made them for LOVED these and wanted the recipe. I will make them again if only because they were so popular.

Delicious and unusual! The fact that we can make the curry cheese mixture a day ahead and then just assemble everything before serving makes this a keeper!

I spread this mix on a large piece of Kabul bread, then cut it into bite size pieces before broiling. My guests loved the crunchy/sweet combination. Mix holds up if you prepare it one day in advance.

I made it using the 3 inch pitas and after splitting them I cut them in half before broiling. Think that the half moon shape was easier to handle than a wedge. My guests loved them and asked for the recipe.

Wonderful the first time;the second time,I skipped the curry powder, added some port and used it for a puff pasrty filling! Fantastic dessert.

i made this as an hors d'oeuvre for a casual cocktail party and it was all gone in one passing -- maybe because i cut it in quarters instead of sixths, which seemed too small. next time, i'll double the recipe. everyone loved it.

Outstanding. I have made it using both 3 and 4 pita breads, and stretching it out over 4 gives you more for your money and they are just as fabulous!

I made this when my parents came over for dinner and it was the biggest hit of the night.
