This was a delicious and unique dessert. I did find the mint a bit overpowering--next time I will use half the amount. I couldn't find apricots so I used peaches instead, which turned out to be a good substitute.

Ambrosial. I used raspberries and pears and served the brulee with lightly whipped cream flavoured with a few drops of Grand Marnier. I highly recommend using a chef's blowtorch, which is much easier to control than a broiler and a lot more fun!

Oh, my... This sounds so decadent and delicious! I can't wait to get my hands on some figs (which should be available for a little while soon) and make this!

My husband and I cannot wait for the white figs in our area to ripen so we can make this dessert again

Sounds good, but how long do you bake and at what temp?
