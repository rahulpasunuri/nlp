Used Russian kale, and with that green, I like it, don't love it. Maybe I would dry-cook it next time, and add the cilantro from the start to mellow it. Maybe I would move on to another recipe. Do wish my CSA would give me some Black Kale so I could see what the fuss was about.

This is an outstanding way to cook kale -- I was also able to boil the kale then saute the onions and kale in the same pan. It does need some salt. Easy and delicious. My husband also loved it.

I've only recently discovered Dinosaur Kale - it has a wonderful, unusual taste. Cilanto is a perfect complement. This is a quick, easy way to prepare any kind of kale, but if you can find Dinosaur Kale, definitely use it. We served it with "Trout with Pecan and Pine Nut Crust" and "Orzo with Everything", both recipes on this site on a week night to guests!
