What am I missing with the raves for this dish? Granted, I didn't have the fresh herbs on hand...maybe they would add more pep. But I did get the recommended (pretty pricey) greek cheeses, and was totally not impressed. It was okay...but the sun-dried tomato flavor didn't come through, they were very labor intensive considering the end result, and the directions about how to make each roll were very confusing. Definitely not a keeper. And I agree with another reviewer -- seems like a dipping sauce would add a lot.

These were really simple and really tasty. I only used feta cheese as that was what I had but I will definitely be making these again.

Excellent! Great for appetizer or even a meal. The roll broke while baking, don't know why, so filling oozed onto baking pan.

This was a simple, but sophisticated appetizer and very good. I was able to make about 25 rolls that were about 3/4 inch thick and 2 inches long. This was a good size because they are a bit rich. I will surely make them again.

I found all the cheeses at a local cheese shop. For the amount of filling, I only got 10 rolls, not 16 as the recipe indicates. I thought this was good, but could have used some more filling (lots of empty phyllo pastry on each end). I'm sure a dipping sauce would be delicious with it too. It was quite good, but didn't absolutely wow me.

I made these using the suggested substitutions for the cheeses. They turned out great. Everyone raved. I made them and then froze them and cooked from frozen. I doubled the filling ingredients but when I rolled them, it only made about 1 1/2 times as much as the recipe says. I guess I put too much filling in them but it didn't taste like too much. These were very popular with everyone who tried them and not too fiddly to make.
