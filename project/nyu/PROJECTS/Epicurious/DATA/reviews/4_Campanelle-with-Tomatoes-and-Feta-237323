Simple and delicious! Much more than the sum of it's parts. Made 1/2 for 2, used grape tomatoes and sauteed with garlic and onions and added spring mix at end. Mixed feta into pasta with a bit of low fat italian cheese mix. Will become a frequent part of our menus.

Excellent! I added walnuts and sweet italian sausage and was delicious! Fast and easy, would make it again for sure.

Fast, easy, and delicious recipe. It could use some deeper flavors, might experiment a bit more on the next go-around. Sauteing the tomatoes was genius, they are delicious in that way.

Really good recipe. I made this for a party and everyone loved it... all asked for the recipe. And previous recommendations were right on. I used arugula and spinach. Also, sprinkled pine nuts on top. mmm mmm!

This is a wonderful recipe and so quick to prepare. I substitute sliced shallots for the green onions because I prefer them. As well, I stir the feta into the pasta so it melts a bit. Delicious.

So easy and so delicious - of course quality feta and tomatoes in season make a difference!

Agree with others, very easy and tasty for so few ingredients, as long as they are at their very freshest! Subbed a "sassy" mix that included arugula & spinach, but thought it needed just a bit more heat,so added dash of red pepper flakes. Like the idea of pine nuts too, as well as adding mozzerella to feta.

this was ridiculously easy and so fresh tasting. my bf said it was the best i've ever made (and im known for my pasta dishes). only thing i did different was add a sprinkle of herbes de provence and a splash or two of wine to the tomatoes as they cooked over hight heat, which caramelized them a bit. absolutely yummy

Simple and fantastic. Can't wait to try this again in the summer with fresh tomatoes!

Great recipe. I made as written except I wasn't able to get arugula in my store this time of year, so I used spinach. I'm diabetic and can't have the pasta, so I fixed my husband's with pasta, and I just had the veggies and the feta. Delicious! I used this as a side dish to baked halibut and a Cole slaw recipe (cabbage, savoy cabbage, jullien carrots, grape tomatoes, a little mayo mixed with a little olive oil, salt and pepper). Dinner was a huge success.

Easy, relatively quick, and tasty. I used mache instead of arugula (since that was all I had) and halved the feta. I would advise putting in the scallions and garlic later on in the process because they are overcooked by the time the dish is finished.

Loved it ! The salty feta and peppery arugula were a nice balance to the sweet tomatoes . I did have to add a dash of hot pepper flakes.I will pass it on . This ones a keeper.

Super recipe! For best results, make sure that tomatoes are sweet, arugala is bitter and use lots of olive oil. Green onions really add a nice touch too.

Made this for the first time w/ spinach last night and agree it's a keeper for how simple it is!

I have made this several times now and it is one of my weeknight staples. It's very quick and easy to prepare and has great flavor. I've used spinach when the store was out of arugula and found that either is very good in this recipe.

Fabulous. The sweetness of the tomatoes balances nicely with the bitterness of the arugula. You could double the feta cheese for a little more richness.

very rich flavors and so easy to make.

Delicious. I took another reviewers advice and added toasted pine nuts- yum! Also, instead of drizzling the cheese on top, add it to the pot and stir around before serving so it gets nice and melty. Keeper

I have made this recipe 4 times in about 3 months. The flavors are delicious. I made mine with whole wheat pasta and have made using arugala, mache' and spinach. I think I prefer the arugala, although the others are good as well. I have also substituted goat cheese for the feta, ummmm. I think an addition of roasted pine nuts would complement this dish as well.. I highly recommend this dish for a quick, healthy side dish.

Easy and fresh, a good weeknight recipe. I used both arugula and spinach and only grape tomatoes- 2 pints. Next time, I will tweak this recipe by adding basil and some Greek olives...

P.S. I forgot to add that the mozzerella melds beautifully with the feta. It's warm and slightly melty. Yum.

This is fabulous! I've made it once and can't wait to make it again after Passover. I also added garlic and added anchovies at the end. I also threw in some buffalo mozzerella. Drop Dead Delish! If there were 5 forks, I would award them to this recipe.

I wasn't really expecting much from this recipe. I thought it would be just another pasta recipe. I made it for my husband, my son and his wife for dinner on a regular weeknight, and it was a big hit. We had no leftovers. The combination of ingredients was wonderful... loved it!

Delicious- a keeper in this household, particularly for a quick weeknight dinner. Don't replace the arugula if you don't have to- the spicy peppery flavor really does well with the sweetness of the tomatoes. I'd also add the garlic to the tomato mixture a bit later- it gets very cooked, almost caramelized. Next time I think I'll also throw in some defrosted shrimp. Yum!

I substituted fresh spinach for the arugula. It was really flavorful, and my family enjoyed it. I will make this quick, simple recipe again. Cindy/Pottawattamie Park, IN

I thought the flavors of this recipe worked well for a vegetarian pasta dish. And it was simple to make as well.

Tasty and easy meal to throw together on a weeknight. The tomatoes made this dish special. I substituted dandelion greens for the arugula and that worked well.
