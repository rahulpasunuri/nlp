Fantastic- tried it for a weekend dinner with my husband. Will definitely elevate this to dinner party status soon. Followed the recipe except that I used boneless breasts and thighs (the thighs were better), and cooked it at 400 for about an hour.

Excellent! My husband and I both loved it. Will feed leftovers to the kids today. Simple and flavorful. Good enough for company. My oil wasn't that hot so there was very little splatter - still came out very flavorful. Will go into my regular rotation.

This is overhyped here. Not much flavor and as others said, it's NOT Mojito, it's mojo. I used the freshest ingredients possible and was not impressed. It's actually bland. This recipe is a waste of garlic and whole chicken.

Yum! Easy....... delicious. Served it with black beans and brown rice. Good enough for guests.

Really enjoyed this dish. The oil wasn't as hot as warned so there was no splatter, but the marinade was still full of flavour. Easy and tasty.

I made this recipe as a test for a party I am having this weekend. I am a fan of Dinosaur's as I am originally from Upstate NY. I wasn't too impressed by the flavor. I live in Chile and limes are impossible to get, so I substituted for fresh, tart lemons (which are incredible here...maybe limes make a huge difference). I am cooking for 30 so I needed a kick...I made up a gravy with the marinade from the pan... Just made a roux, then the pan juices. The flavor was nice w/ the gravy. I plan to serve it with tortillas and coconut rice. Hope everyone enjoys it!

Another one for the files. The most work heavy part of this is prepping the mojo, but if you have a food processor (sadly, I do not), you'll find it very easy. Great flavor!

Rating: 4
This was absolutely delicious. ALTHOUGH, I proceeded without reading the recipe completely and failed to cook anything in the marinade, rather blending everything fresh in the blender. I poured over chicken and sealed in large Ziploc bags for 2 hours. It was SO tasty. I made it for my in-laws and my father-in-law who never gets seconds, went back for thirds. Enjoy!

This is a great recipe! Easy for the fabulous results. Served with limes on the side & added 1/2 serrano pepper to the mojito marinade. Served Epi Cuban Black beans & Perfect Rice with it. Shorted the marinade time greatly (only 2 hours for 6 split chicken breasts) yet, it was still fabulous. My dinner party for six was wowed!

A big hit with us and our neighbors! Goes great with black beans & rice and some fried plantains. So easy!

A real hit here. The flavour is unique and squeezing the quartered limes over the chicken when eating really enhances the flavour.

I took the following shortcut and it turned out great. I did not cook the marinade. I just put everything together in the blender and used the entire batch of marinade on the chicken. Next time I will use only dark meat and more sliced onions under the chicken.

This dish was so easy to and tasted great. The marinade was delicious and the chicken came out juicy, tender and packed with flavor. My whole family enjoyed it! This will definitely be a keeper for a quick easy meal with limited prep time.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I made a mistake and poured the whole batch (instead of the 1 cup called for)of marinade over the chicken. It turned out great - plenty of flavor, and plenty of sauce! Next time, I'll make a larger batch, and save some for pork or fish.

Rating: 4
Wow! This is by far the best marinade I've ever tasted, but I wanted a little heat. The second time I made this I used a few chipotle chiles and a couple of tablespoons of the adobo sauce. I omitted the cumin and oregano and put the remaining chipotle chiles from the can in the marinade after cooking and chopping in the blender.

I came across this recipe by accident and I am so glad I did! I made this for dinner guests and my family raved about the chicken for two days. They already told me that I would be making this dish again and they want to try it on pork and beef. One note, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a small serrano chile (without the seeds) and it added a nice little kick to the marinade. This is one for my personal recipe book.

Rating: 3
All I can say is "WOW" I made this thinking it might be good but the results were beyond my expectations. Confesion time: I only had enough fresh oranges for 1 cup of juice. I added another cup of high-quality grocery store OJ. Results were still outstanding. It s great hot and I ll bet the leftovers will be divine cold!! Do add the hot pepper to the marinade...it improves the end results.

Rating: 4
I made this dish for a casual dinner for 8 people. I doubled the marinade and cooked chicken breasts, legs, and thighs. The thighs were the best as far as flavor and moistness. Everyone raved about it and said they want it again. The only variation from the recipe I made was to add a couple of serrano peppers to the blend to give it a bit of a kick.

Rating: 3
I used the marinade on cornish hens. My husband and one son loved it, I thought it was ok, but after squeezing all those oranges and limes, and pressing tons of garlic, I had expected a stronger flavor. It's not bad. If I make it again I will marinate it overnight. (3 hrs this time)

Rating: 4
We will definitely make this again.

Made this recipe this weekend, looking for something different. Marinated the chicken for two hours then slow cooked it on the grill. After the chicken was done, I followed the suggestion of some other reviews and reduced the sauce and then poured it over the chicken. Let it sit for 15 minutes. Very different but good dish. Served it with rice, black beans and a latin inspired corn bread. Nice change of pace. I froze the left over marinade. Hope it freezes well.

Rating: 4
Just terrific. Was generous with spices, and it came out nice and zippy. Used boneless skinless breasts and roasted for 55 minutes -- too long! but my fault. Still, the marinade was excellent, and thickened nicely w/cornstarch and water slurry. Can't wait to try again and do better next time!

Rating: 4
Incredibly easy and delicious recipe. The most cumbersome task was peeling and pressing 1/2 cup of garlic. The sauce is truly outstanding with a definite kick of lime. I used bone-in chicken thighs since we are dark meat fans served over brown rice. This dish is really beautiful to serve!

Good stuff, but without the zing I was expecting. Yummy just the same.

Great meal for a group. I made the cuban-style black beans and served them over rice. I used all bone in chicken thighs. Nothing could have been easier. I would cut the onions into about 1/4th inch rounds to be sure they cook soft enough. Not one thigh or drop of the sauce was left. They put the sauce on what rice was left and ate it all.

I served this dish with white rice and red beans, as well as fish croquettes (cuban style croquetas). I also sprinkled the chicken with adobo before putting in the oven. My family's rating: Delicous or Delicioso!

mojitos are never too much reverend although they might go better with a nice grilled shrimp cocktail (just like the cold one except use large grilled shrimp and place some guac and salsa on the lettuce for dipping)and i am here to tell you that shrimp and mojitos are divine! i like a nice syrah or zinfandel with this chicken but of course variety is the spice!

This was an unbelievably delicious chicken recipe due to the very flavorful marinade. All three of my kids wolfed this down and one begged me to make it again the next day (luckily I made more chicken than I needed and had leftovers the following night). A definite keeper!

The mojito marinade is out of this world! I marinated my chicken for 24 hours and it was tender, juicy and delicious! I served it to a party of 10 and a definate crowd pleaser. I'm making it again this weekend for a beach party.

Rating: 3
Good chicken dish. The chicken was very moist, it's either because of all the juice I had in the pan while it was oven roasting or it was because I marinated it for two days. If you want extra sauce on the side I recommend keeping all of the marinade that you didn't add to the pan and boil it while the chicken is cooking. If you want to thicken the sauce you can mix warm water and 1/2 teaspoon of corn starch in a cup and add it to the sauce tward the end of cooking it.

I have been looking for a recipe that tastes like our local cuban restaurant and this is very close! I also made this with pork in the crock pot and it was wonderful. The mojito is good over yucca too. I added some more garlic.

One word in sum: Fantastic. I used the entire marinade to pour over the chicken and only let it marinate 3 1/2 hours. Plenty of time. Excellent and I made it with the Cuban black beans (on this site) served with white rice. Try it!

I have made this twice and it was absolutely wonderful. Easy too! Great flavors. Perfect for a summer barbecue. I once lived in Rochester, NY and was blessed to be able to frequent Dinosaur BBQ. Worth a trip!

I thought this was an easy, quick, and delicious recipe. I only made half the marinade, didn't have cumin, and I used 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts. The onions were melted and delicious! I also didn't have time to marinate the chicken at all - it came out great, but I imagine it would have been really fabulous if I had let it marinate. Try this one!

Rating: 4
This is a really nice recipe. I added sliced serranos to the Mojito Marinade to give it some extra kick. After marinading 24 hours, try grilling over pecan or even mesquite to really boost the flavor. The end result makes for great chicken fajitas. Use some of the remaining sauce to mix with pico de gallo or guacamole. Muy delicioso!

This is a beautiful marinade! It has a little work but worth it. One time, I was low on fresh orange juice, so I replaced half of it with juices from bottle. Worked just great. I made this a couple of times already. My husband and I thought this recipe is a keeper. Good call!

Rating: 3
This was a wonderful recipe! Highly recommend that the chicken marinates overnight. I used skinless, boneless breasts instead of the 8 pieces of chicken. I also "forked" the chicken before leaving it overnight in the fridge so that the flavours seep into the meat. My friends LOVED this dish!

Great chicken, the whole family agrees -- even my picky, ahem ... discerning husband. I used boneless skinless breasts and reduced the cooking time by 20 min. A couple of additions to the marinade: a dash of red pepper flakes and a packet of Sazon with achiote (a Latino thing, widely available now). Mmmmmm.

Excellent stuff. Worth the hassle preparing the marinade. Be sure to rub the marinade under the chicken's skin (get personal indeed) and to roast atop the onions.

Rating: 0
Really great and different. Would add more garlic and, as suggested, something like a habanero. Also cut the salt in half. Definitely double the amount of onions that go in with the chicken (sliced very thin)--yum, yum!! As for the prep, I'm not one for a lot of do-dads and gizmos in the kitchen, but buying a cuisinart mini-prep is the best investment I've made ($30): cutting and chopping are a breeze for recipes like these where the quality of the cut doesn't really matter. (Also used it to blend ingredients.) Regarding the spattering, not a big deal. Just use some common sense, and it's fine. And to the the cook from "sw fla" who suggested buying the sauce: this is a RECIPE website. Why don't you just stick to the backs of cans and jars, and leave your comments about recipes to others who actually use them. Or, better yet, go to KFC or Boston Chicken and be done with it.

This is a great recipe.It took a little time to put toghter and cook. I found out u can do the same thing with any marinade.I just put the chicken in a 13x9 pan and add the marinade the night before put in the fridge.When ready to cook heat the oven and put the chicken in and family has love every one I have done and I done lot.With a lot of diffrent kinds of marinade.

marinade is terrific -- well worth the squeezing and spattering -- and the preparation couldn't be easier. I use chicken thighs and I slice the onions very thin so they really just melt. My picky kids scarfed it up. Served it with Tommy's Rice & Beans for a perfect match.

This is a great recipe for big parties, very good taste. I used chicken breasts just to make it easier, and it cooks in under an hour. Mojito cocktails are of course a naturally refreshing compliment.

Being Cuban myself I can say that this was a very good result. Very tasty and rather easy to make. PLEASE WATCH OUT FOR THE OIL SPALTERING - IT CAN BE QUITE DANGEROUS. I wish that I could see many more Cuban dishes on this website. I think that alot of people would really enjoy the uniqueness of Cuban food.

I use this recipe quite frequently when recommending dishes to my clients who self-cater their function. I arrange the food presentation and oversee the event - this dish gets RAVES from the guests. It works well in large quantities and holds well in a chafing dish. I do recommend cutting back on the salt - it seemed to overwhelm the other flavors. Some clients have substituted table salt, again decreasing quantity, with good results.

I was looking for an easy chicken recipe with a good marinade... while my guests liked this dish and the chicken was tender, I thought the marinade was a lot of work for a so-so product. Also too oily for my tastes. I didn't think the flavors were distinct enough - I didn't really taste the garlic or the citrus, and that's what had attracted me to the marinade in the first place.

Rating: 4
VERY Good!!! Made it for my in-laws today, and they really enjoyed it. A delicious marinade. I also put it on a piece of salmon and broiled it in foil for my Aunt (who does not eat chicken) and it was delicious! My husband thinks this was the best meal I've made. He couldn't stop raving about it. Warning-Be careful with the blender part. I would highly recommend blending 1/4 at a time (because it shoots out of the blender and it's very hot.

This recipe was wonderful. I generally do not make any meal with citrus in it. But all the great reviews got me to try it. The only thing I did different was use cayenne pepper instead of black pepper because I was out of it. My neighbor in back of us smelled it cooking from his backyard. I gave his family some and they loved it. My picky seven year old like it too. I do not like onions but these onions were good. I'm very happy I didn't go by the reviews of those who did not like it. I would have missed out on a wonderful dish.

We loved the wonderfully tangy marinade, used the leftover on a pork tenderloin, which was also great. Since we both love spicy I added a habanero which really kicked it up a notch. It will definately be done again.

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site. I put my oven on convection roast and turn the pieces half way through for the best beautifully roasted result. There is enough marinade for two chickens here! I put the drippings (fat removed) and left over marinade (cooked) over basmati rice. Delicious.

A very good dish< I will make it again. However, I feel a warning is order about the blending of ingredients. Use extreme caution during this step - my blender overflowed and the very hot liquid burned my hand.

I've made this recipe 3 times and we love it. I usually marinate it overnight. We have yet to serve it to guests because it's so easy to do on a week night. Be aware that the marinade recipe makes a lot more than stated (add up the quantities!), although extra marinade is not a bad thing. To lower fat, we have been removing the chicken skin before marinating and reducing the olive oil in the marinade. Excellent!

Rating: 2
I was excited to try this recipe based on the great reviews, but I don't agree that this was anything special. Squeezing all the fresh juice and chopping all the garlic was not worth the result. The chicken wasn't all that moist, and it tasted ok,...but for all that work making the marinade, it should've been phenomenal. I can get much better flavor more simply, by marinating some brined chicken in olive oil, lemon juice and smashed garlic cloves. Or by making a marinade of equal parts honey, soy sauce, white vinegar, and olive oil, with some allspice, thyme and lots of fresh ground pepper. Also, the cooking time was too long here. If I'd cooked it for 75 minutes, it would have dried out. If you're looking for the onions to "melt" into the sauce, you'll have to slice them very thin (not 1/2", as the recipe suggests).

I live two blocks from this restaurant and love every item on the menu. This marinade is available at local stores, but tastes even better when you make it yourself. Try this with Basmati rice --> It absorbed the sauce nicely. Do try this tangy treat!

save yourself the time, and buy "MOJO" in the bottle at the grocery store! I did this the other night w/ a small whole chicken, marinated in the bottled mojo, baked the chix. Next time I would also add a little salt,pepper & garlic(keep basting). Yummy
