I have been hunting for a scallion cake recipe that would be fabulous enough to make again - this is it. Absolutely delicious and just like the homemade cakes I remember eating from the China pavilion at Heritage Days. I will NEVER lose this recipe.

This is the third Chinese scallion bread recipe I've tried-- and it's a keeper! The subtle onion flavor and crispiness won us over. My only suggestion would be to sprinkle some sesame seeds on top of the pancakes at the same time as the scallions and salt. And, yes, the recipe does take a bit of time.

I won't bash this recipe because the folding technique is right. I've been looking for a method that results in subtle swirls in the finished scallion pancakes, and if you rip away at it, it naturally unravels in concentric circles (call me detail-oriented... or anal). This recipe does just that. But the taste? Ick. Maybe, MAYBE fresh dripped pork lard would add flavor, but the store-bought lard just makes it taste greasy. Stick with grandma's recipe - brush it with sesame oil and salt and fry it in vegetable oil.

Very very bland. I love scallions, but the dough makes them taste like a fish pretzyl.

It's a great dish i learned to love while living with my dad in China. I would usually spread a little margarine onto the dough before scattering the scallions on and brush some light soy sauce on while frying for taste, then i dip them in more soy sauce...

Yummy and easy!

This is the same way we make them in CHINATOWN EAST (Flushing, Queens). This recipe does take a little time, but it is worth it. Serve this with Diluted Red Wine Vinegar for light dipping and you have a real, authentic, winner.

Though a little time consuming, I found this recipe easy and delicious! I served them with soy ginger dipping sauce. A new family favourite!

I have been searching for a recipe that captured the flavor of these "scallion pancakes" a local restaurant served. This is it! I made them and served them with a dipping sauce of soy, sugar and sesame oil. YUM YUM. A new family favorite.
