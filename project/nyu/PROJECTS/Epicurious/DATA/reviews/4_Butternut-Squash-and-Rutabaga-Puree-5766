This dish got rave reviews from my Thanksgiving guests last year and will become a regular part of my holiday menu. Peeling the squash is tedious, but it can be done the day before so there is no last minute prep other than warming it up.

This was an interesting complement to the menu. It was different and very good. Only cooking issue is that I couldn't get it all in the food processor. Once I realized that, I had to do it in shifts and never got it all smooth. Start in small batches and it will be perfect! Doing the prep ahead was essential and helped tremendously for a stress free Christmas Day.

This was wonderful, and got rave reviews from our holiday dinner crowd. The only difficult part was, of course, chopping the 3+ pound rutabaga! A great make-ahead dish, as well.

This was a big hit for a dinner party, serving it with spaetzle and pork cutlets. So simple! I added fresh sage and maple syrup to the food processor.

I reduced the butter for my husband and me, and it was still delicious. With the full amount of butter it would be even better. Even froze and reheated it.The proportions of squash and rutabaga could be played with as well. Easy, healthful, and tasty.

Served as an intermediate dish, used chinese bowls and spoons, presented it with seaweed on top having par-boiled it in ginger and cinamon.

We made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner. It was easy, very tasty and was an excellent change of pace from the normal vegetable side dish. The recipe is so basic that it provides a number of opportunities for variation. We will definitely make it again.
