Did not have any peppercini, but I had just picked up a batch of freshley roasted "Hatch" green chilis at the farmers market. Let the scallops sit in the lime juice overnight then I wrapped a small piece of scallop in a piece of fresh green chile. I added some minced cilantro to the reserved lime juice which I put in a small dish in the center of the serving platter for a dip. Served with small pieces of homemade toast brushed with melted garlic/cilantro butter. It was very tasty. Spicey but not hot. The hit of the party. Easy to make ahead. I will definitly use it again.
