Easy and delicious! Yes, it's very rich and very chocolatey, but that didn't stop me making custard to go with it. It took longer than stated to bake though.

very rich. only used 1/2 cup cocoa in sauce. this is a typical australian recipe - and needs to be served with same quantity of icecream as pudding!

The recipe and reviews made this "sticky" pudding out to be better than it actually turned out. It is VERY rich and has some potential. The hazelnut is extremely overpowering (and I love hazelnut). We did use very good chocolate as well.

This recipe is very similar to one I found in a Kiwi cookbook, based on an English pudding. This has now become my husband's favorite dessert. It's a bit like a large-scale chocolate molten cake and EXTREMELY rich. The quality of the chopped chocolate and cocoa make a huge difference, though I have successfully used milk chocolate in place of the dark - it changes the nature of the end product but as there were few complaints - or leftovers - when I made it this way I consider it a good alternative when you find yourself without dark chocolate. A must for the chocoholic near you.

Absolutely delicious, my boyfriend - a serious chocoholic- simply loved it. Using Toblerone dark instead of regular dark chocolate makes it even tastier. Also very easy to make

I was disappointed but mine was overcooked. I kept waiting for the sauce to go underneath which it never did. But I'm not sure if it was less cooked that I would have liked the flavor anyway. It was pretty chocolatey without enough sugar for my taste or salt or butter for that matter. It was somewhat redeemed when we put it with vanilla ice cream and that helped a lot.

I have made this several times and it always turned out good. But last night I made it with Toblerone dark chocolate and it turned out fantastic. The melting nougat pieces were soo goood.

This was very good and very easy to prepare. Had to substitute almonds for hazelnuts because of an allergy. The nuts give it a very interesting texture. Used equal parts of sugar and cocoa for the sauce for fear that it would be too bitter-- glad that I did. Yes, pudding does form on the top, but you can still insert a knife into the center to check if the cake on the bottom has stiffened up. Easily feeds 8 and is suprisingly filling for such a small fat content. Used whipped cream on top, but both husband and I agree that ice cream would have been the way to go.

I loved this recipe (and so did my boyfriend and mother)! It was very easy to make and absolutely delicious - very chocolately. Nigella neglects to include in her instructions that the pudding forms on TOP of the cake. I checked the pudding after 40 minutes and thought it was going to have to bake for at least another 20 minutes when I saw what I thought was uncooked batter (it was actually the pudding). If you are using a souffle dish, the pudding will definitely be done in 45-50 minutes. A keeper!

This has become a standby for when I've people coming over and I want to offer a homey, comforting dessert that packs a serious chocolate punch. I use ground almonds or hazelnuts in it, and serve it with either double cream or thick, strained yogurt. A fabulous winter treat...and the rest of the cookbook this comes from is pretty great, too!

Everything about this was dish was overpowering. I have used a similar recipe in the past where the "sauce" ingrediants are 2/3 cups granulated sugar and 2 Tbs of cocoa. This recipe calling for 1 1/4 CUPS of cocoa powder was way over the edge. I did not use hazelnuts and increased the flour as suggested. The basic recipe for the cake seemed fine but the sauce ruined it. I will stick to my old recipe. Ms. Lawsons book sound interesting though and I will give it a look.
