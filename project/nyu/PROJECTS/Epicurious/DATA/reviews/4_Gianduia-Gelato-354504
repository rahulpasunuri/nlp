Silky and light without being thin in flavour. The hazelnut came through beautifully.

The base is simple to make (even if it makes a few dishes), and even though it's only 1/2 frozen (I snuck a taste), I can tell it's going to be spectacular! My boyfriend tasted the mix before I froze it and said it was heavenly, high praise from a man who doesn't eat sweets.

Another tip: After rubbing the skins off the toasted hazelnuts, remember to shake the nuts in a fine metal sieve to remove even more of the skins. It works!

Fabulous! I accidentally burnt the nuts when toasting, but was able to salvage a little over 1 cup. Took off most of skins, but not all before putting in the food processor and it was still fantastic and had plenty of hazelnut taste. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and everyone loved it. I saved the strained hazelnuts and sprinkled on top. Delicious, restaurant quality.

This one is a winner! I've made it with all whole milk and also with 1/2 skim milk (all I had on hand) and 1/2 heavy cream. Both were equally great. Use as fine of a mesh as you can to filter out the hazelnuts. It can be a bit grainy if fines slip through, but still fantastic none the less. Keeps well too. We've had it in the freezer for up to a month & it was perfect; did not get icy at all when stored in air-tight containers.

this is tasty but a bit more of an ice cream recipe than a true gelato. Gelato has far less fat than American ice cream so if you want a truer gelato taste, don't be tempted to substitute heavy cream. It's also important to chill the mixture at least over night The mixture for gelato is typically made using a hot process, which includes pasteurization. Heating the mix to 90°C is essential for chocolate gelato, which is traditionally flavored with cocoa powder. The gelato mix needs to age for several hours after pasteurization is complete in order for the milk proteins to hydrate or bind with the mixture.

I followed the Julia Child advice on removing the skins from the nuts and it worked fabulous. I think next time I make this I will use less cornstarch though, as the consistency of my mixture was too pudding-like. I also replaced a portion of the milk with heavy cream, but I think next time I will try with just the whole milk. Overall an excellent recipe and reminds me of the Gianduja chocolates of Italy (so tasty!!!!).

My family and guests raved about it, but I felt like I may have scorched the hazlenuts a bit. So 3 forks because I took my fork away. I skinned them using the Julia Child method mentioned by a reader below. I will actually make this again without the nuts because I thought the chocolate flavor was yum. I also appreciated using milk instead of cream for less fat.

A pleasure to make!! Tastes very nice too - fantastic if you eat it right away... after a couple days, not so much (I think the hazlenuts overpower it once it sits too long).

Sorry gang, I am going to be a party-pooper. I looked at the recipe and thought-a base of warm milk? Only? I substituted a cup of cream, but even so - blah. Taste, fine; texture - eh. If you are going to bother making ice cream, start with a custard base.

It turns out that gelato made using hazelnuts tastes better if you leave the skins on the nuts. If you do not process the nuts finely enough, or do not strain out the pieces of skin, they will be visible, but it will taste better. And, it is so much more convenient to make the hazelnut paste.

This was absolutely luscious, and incredibly easy! I rated it only 3 forks simply because I have never made anything like this, and so have nothing to compare it to. I made a couple of minor changes to the recipe: 1) I substituted a pint of natural (no carrageenan or other thickners) heavy cream for that much of the whole milk, and 2) I used a 70:30 (nothing magical about the ratio, it just worked out that way) mix of a couple of chocolates I had on hand (a 60% cacao bar that's spiced with pasilla and cayenne peppers and a touch of cinnamon, and a 54% bittersweet bar. The result was surprisingly subtle added dimension (I had worried that using only the spiced chocolate would be too much). This was my first time using my new Cuisinart ICE-20 ice cream machine, and I'm very pleased with the result: the gelato was quite firm (though it melts quite rapidly since it has no stabilizers in it). Because I was in no hurry, I refrigerated the mix overnight, and put it in the ice cream machine the next day for a 30 minute churning... no problems! By the way: thanks for posting the Julia Child technique for skinning the hazelnuts; it worked like a charm!

This recipe is delicious! My daughter made it yesterday. She had trouble with the skins so we appreciate everyone's suggestions. We'll try them next time. One tip of our own: make sure the mixture is very cold before you put it in your ice cream maker otherwise it won't become thick.

freeze after it's chilled...

Question: Where and when does the ice cream maker come into play here - all I have read refers to putting ingrediants in bowls, and pans - but there is NO insttruction as to when to put anything into the ice cream maker - please, someone help out - I would like to make this but am really confused here.

To skin hazelnuts, as seen on "Baking with Julia": For every 2 cups of water, add 3 Tablespoons of baking soda. Boil nuts until water is black and a foam is on surface. Drain nuts and rinse in cold water. Allow to cool before slipping off skins. Toast and use.

This is so amazing and easy. It had a fantastic hazelnut flavor. I will definitely make it again.

WOW!! So delicious!! I toasted the hazelnuts in the oven for 10 min on 350, then put all the nuts on a towel and then rubbed the skins off with the towel. Much easier! You're obviously not going to get all the skins off, but it does take a lot of it off. It's a very rich gelato but it definately reminded me of the gelato I had in Italy!!

I tasted the hazelnuts after I strained them and they were way too good to throw out... so I've been sprinkling them back on as a topping. Next time I'll just leave them in - I would imagine it should work fine.

This was delicious! Many of my hazelnuts still had skins remaining on them after roasting as well. It's difficult to impossible to remove them all. Just go ahead with the recipe...it did NOT affect the outcome of the gelato. Just make sure that you strain it well through a fine sieve before putting it in your ice cream maker. I did it a couple times and used cheesecloth. You have to work it a little to get it to strain. Also, all ice cream makers are a little different, so times in a maker may vary. I put the gelato in the freezer when the texture was like thick soft serve ice cream and it was perfect. This is a must try.

so far so good...but not clear on how long it should be in the ice cream maker before putting in the freezer. What texture should it have after the ice cream maker step?

I want to make this, but having trouble getting the skins off the hazelnuts. Have roasted them in a 350degree oven for 15 minutes, rolled them in a towel. Still on. Any suggestions? Does it make a difference for the gelato?

This is the best ice cream I've ever made- it's rich without being too heavy (I think that sometimes premium-style homemade chocolate ice cream can be too rich.) I used bittersweet Ghirardelli chocolate. I had a bit of a problem with the cornstarch clumping, but it didn't make a difference in the end- I don't think the clumps went away but they don't interfere with the taste. Really great recipe.

Wonderful, great flavor. I used a chocolate with 71% cacao because I had lots on hand, it was grand. It is like a rich pudding that you put into the ice cream maker. Definitely a keeper.

Absolutely delicious! We will be making this again and again. A definate keeper!
